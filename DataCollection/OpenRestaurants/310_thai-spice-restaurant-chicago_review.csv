Food was lackluster, even after an hour wait (we were the only table waiting on food, mind you), we got a papaya salad with no papaya in it! Just a plain salad I could've gotten from a bag at my local grocery store. Next came the curry, I had the Kang Dang and the boyfriend got the Panang. Both with chicken. The curry sauce was quite oily and tasted heavily of salt and msg. In my honest opinion I would not recommend this place. I still have an upset stomach, after an hour since eating.

My biggest mistake was assuming that an order of pad thai would put me in the $8-10 range, instead it was $17.95! A single item order cost me $20 in total. The only justifiable part was that the order was close to 5 lbs, but there are other Thai places that will pack on 3 lbs of noodles for $8. Most importantly the taste wasn't amazing. I grew up eating Thai take-out and in my tastebuds there's a sensation of flavor that hits my palate when I think of pad thai, unfortunately Thai Spicy's pad thai did not meet my expectations. The pad thai wasn't as savory as I personally would've liked it to be, all I could taste were the peanuts. Peanuts in pad thai are only to complement, not overpower the dish. I could hardly taste the savory combination of soy sauce, brown sugar, and fish sauce that I crave for in my pad thai. What was most disappointing was the authenticity of this place. A friend of mine told me that the owner's wife is Thai and cooks the food. For the price and mediocre palate I wouldn't recommend this place.",-0.7364,0.866,0.049,0.085,0.7029761904761904

2017-04-17,5.0,"I have been coming here for 6 years, and this is by far my favorite Thai spot in Chicago. I still remember the first time I met Anthony, the owner. I'm a spicy eater and it took me a while to convince him to let me try Level 5 (out of 10). When I was done making a fool of myself and was burning my tongue off, Anthony made sure I had an unlimited supply of Thai Iced Tea to ease the pain. First of all, let's be very clear. The spice level here is no joke. I am the person who orders ""Very Spicy"" at most thai places. I do not venture above a 4 here. The highest I got to was a 6 - but that was due to a dare and was a meal I did not enjoy at all. The food here is cooked with a level of attention that I have yet to experience anywhere else. Anthony will sometimes bring around a sample of some spices that he has recently acquired, and get your opinion on whether you want it in your food or not. Food takes anywhere between 30 minutes and an hour to prepare, since literally every dish is prepared from scratch (including grinding the spices). Get ready to have some long conversations at this establishment. The taste is incredible, provided that you didn't mess up by ordering a spice level out of your league (you can always ask Anthony for recommended spice). I usually get either the Gaprow Kai (level 3) or the Mussamun Curry (level 2) with chicken. Both of these dishes are the best versions that I've had anywhere. Keep in mind that currys in general tend to be a bit spicier than dry food (such as the Gaprow Kai). I would suggest ordering a Thai Iced Tea to go with your meal - that concoction has the magical property of instantly dousing a mouth-fire.  The prices here are high - between $13-$18 per dish. The good news is that the portions are quite large and I usually have leftovers to take home. The dishes that I get here make excellent second meals once heated up!

We were seated right away but the restaurant was empty which I attributed to the fact they opened an hour earlier but I'm probably wrong as to that being the reason.  After the initial sticker shock of the menu, many plates were $17.95 we were ready to order but ended up waiting nearly 15 minutes before, I'm guessing it was the owner, brought us water and took our order.  He had been busy chatting with someone at the front of the restaurant and taking phone orders, more on that in a second. We were just getting ready to leave at that point but I insisted on staying.  I had decided on the beef Mussaman curry since it's one of my favorites when I go for Thai. We were informed that the beef was ""special"" or something and came with rice...  ummm alright.  Always find it to be a red flag when someone insists on telling you what is great about the food. Let me decided that please.  While we had been waiting the owner would take phone orders on speaker phone. I was able to hear everything, including name, address, credit card number including CVC and zip code. Luckily for those ordering I'm not an identity thief but I would be wary of placing a phone order here.  Also there's a $30 credit card minimum, the owner informed someone on the phone and proceeded to say I can let it go this time if you have no other means to pay. Seemed a little condescending if you ask me. But also, $30 minimum? The most I have ever come across is like $15.  Anyways. So there was a waitress there who was nice but again service was lacking; We were the only ones there and had to keep asking for water.  So the food came out and mine was ok, not the best Mussaman I've had but it was good. My friend said his green curry was a bit on the greasy side and the bamboo shoots and peas didn't taste very fresh.  The special beef was just like any other beef I've tasted so I'm not sure what was supposed to be so great.  When I went to pay the check I was told to write the tip amount that I would be leaving so they could run it all as one (odd) because the final receipt had a place for the tip so not sure what that was about. Maybe to guilt you into leaving a better tip but I went with the bare minimum.  So for two people who drank water and ate Mussaman and Green curry dishes the total bill wad $49.00!  Sorry but that was extremely pricy for service that is lacking and food that was just ok, although the portions were pretty large.  Overall impressions did not match some of these four and five star reviews, I just left underwhelmed because I've honestly had better elsewhere.",0.9964,0.78,0.161,0.059,0.5416990605766115

There was something lacking in the green curry, most probably a spice and it lack any fragrant of lemongrass. Assuming the owner's claim that everything is fresh, they need to better process their coconut juice as it was barely there. The pad Thai was again lacking something.

Anthony and his wife make spicy, and not-spicy dishes that are better than any I've had elsewhere in the genre around the US and other countries I've visted. That says a lot - because I eat Thai food in almost every place I go. There is a hidden heat-scale here for those who love super-hot peppers, and trust me, it goes all the way to the top! (Carolina Reapers, Ghosts, Scorpions, oh my!) For those who have not been indoctrinated: order a heat level of 1 or 2. If you don't like spicy food, I'd recommend the Pad Thai without spice. I always get a second order of it myself. It's that good! First - Thai Spice is European in style. If it isn't busy, you may have to ask for the check. For instance: it is considered rude in France for a server to bring your bill without you asking first. So, ask for your bill if you need to pay. Second - expect a wait. After all, good food isn't fast. Third - order the Pad Thai - no spice. It is, to date, still the best I've ever had - ever. Get it with Tofu and you'll find it is veggie-friendly. Also, you cannot go wrong with almost any other dish - though I particularly like the Pad Kee Mao, the Supreme Vegetable, and the Mongolian Beef. Don't overlook the wasabi-garlic-mashed-potatoes, hidden on the back of the menu, and remember - Thai Spice is BYOB - so bring your favorite libation with some friends!

Accompanying the entrée was a gargantuan bowl of steamed white rice, and if you are somehow able to finish all of it, additional bowls of rice are complimentary.  My girlfriend and I both ordered Thai iced tea, and I was surprised to find that the lovely people of Thai Spice freshly brew their Thai tea in house, and use only a dash or two of half and half poured over the tea, exactly the way the beverage is traditionally prepared (and the best tasting way too). The atmosphere of the restaurant is traditional, adorned with Thai artwork and statues.  Not exactly Mastro's, but definitely not McDonalds either.  Our waitress was very sweet and helpful, and even offered us complimentary refills on our Thai iced teas to ""help us stay cool"" on the 94° summer day!

The restaurant is run by a husband and wife team and the food is AMAZING! So fresh and high quality ingredients! The food is as authentic as it gets!  I particularly recommend the Pad Thai and the Papaya Salad! The service can get slow during busy days, but the waitress is amazing and always smiling!  I am giving a four star instead of five because their spice levels can be misleading, and it would be nice if they let us know as we are ordering. The spice levels range from 0-5. Anything beyond a 3 is CRAZY SPICY. We recommend ordering a 0.5 (equivalent to ""medium spicy"").",0.9728,0.764,0.191,0.045,0.6233333333333334

On the menu, the prices seem steeper than what I was used to at Thai restaurants. But, it was so worth it. The flavors were fresh and complex. It was clear that the ingredients were carefully chosen. The owner, who is friendly and charming, told us that they choose fresh, organic non-GMO foods. The beef for the Beef Pepper dish is quality Black Angus. According to the menu, the restaurant opened in 1993. At that time, tons of other Thai restaurants were opening offering cheap, mediocre food.

2016-01-01,5.0,"I went to Thai Spice on New Year's Eve. A couple had canceled their reservation for the night and we were able to get a spot. When we got there, Anthony (the owner) was extremely warm and inviting and accompanied us to our seats. I'm not sure if this is the norm (Anthony had told us that his staff was on Christmas break and that he, his wife, and a few others were the only ones there to run the business over the holiday break), however, it was very nice to have the owner so engaged with the customers throughout the time that we were there. He was incredibly informative when it came to questions about the food that they served (from ingredients to the various levels of spice (1-5)), and also had a very warm and genuine candor about him that was a pleasure to be around, especially on New Year's Eve. The limited wait staff that was there was always very attentive in making sure that our glasses of water were filled and that we had everything that we needed throughout the meal. Service was an easy 5 stars. In terms of the food: Food Price: It was a little pricier than what we're used to for Thai food, both in the city and in the suburbs, however, there were two things that I felt justified the prices after going through the experience of eating there: 1) The serving sizes were quite generous. My girlfriend and I were not able to eat even half of our meals. And even the next day when I ate my leftovers, I still had some left. 2) The quality of ingredients and execution of cooking the meal were both very good. 3) As a bonus that night, the level of service was top notch. So ya, the food was more than worth it for the aforementioned reasons. Food Quality: As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the food quality was excellent. The depth of flavor in my dish (Pad Thai) was phenomenal. I had initially asked for the highest level of spice that they had, but Anthony talked me off of the ledge and recommended I start with a Level 1 so that I could taste the quality of the food. I have never been talked down from eating a high spice level from any Thai restaurant that I've been to so that I could ""enjoy the flavor of the food"". He was right though - the 1 still had sufficient heat yet I was able to enjoy the food without sweating and begging for more water. This spoke to the pride that the owner had in the quality and flavor of his food. Many Thai restaurants, especially ones with subpar quality ingredients and a modest flavor profile, would relish in the opportunity of being able to smother a dish with max spice so that the inferiority of the meal's ingredients and flavor could be masked. Anthony was the opposite - he wanted me to taste the many nuances of my meal.  In terms of ambience and environment, the lightning was inviting and warm, the restaurant looked relatively clean (our table was clean and prepared when we arrived), and the background music was at a comfortable level for this type of restaurant. They had pillows on the floor to sit on next to the windows for those who like to enjoy Thai food in that fashion. Aside from that, there was nothing that stood out to me as positive or negative here. To sum it up, their service was excellent, their food was excellent, and the restaurant itself was clean and comfortable. Anthony is a fantastic owner and a pleasure to be around. Whoever is cooking in the back (I believe his wife was on NYE but I'm not sure if this is the norm) knows exactly what they are doing. Congratulations to Anthony and his family for building such a nice business. We'll be back again to try spice Level 2 - 5.",0.9984,0.813,0.162,0.026,0.5634356962481961

2015-10-02,1.0,"I have never been so badly misled by Yelp!  I do not understand what any of these great reviews are talking about, and I would be hard pressed to wonder if the restaurant hasn't fudged the data a bit.  The place was busy-ish for a moderately-sized thai place in the city.  My husband and I decided to check it out on a Friday night (only b/c Thai Aree is currently closed).  There are so many things that are impossible to account for in the food industry - people calling off, an unexpected super-busy night, running out of certain dishes, etc.  My review will reflect the MASSIVE DEFICITS that are under the restaurant's control.   Service:  horrendous.  When I walked in, I stood in front of the manager/guy who appeared to be running this show for at least a minute before he looked up from the receipt he was running to acknowledge me.  I don't need immediate seating - but reasonable acknowledgement yes.  We were seated, and then waited at least 15 min before any further communication - including water or wine glasses.  There was only one waitress working.  When she finally came to our table, she had horrible sniffles and proceeded to sneeze a few times while taking our order.  We blessed her and she complained about how bad her allergies have been.  As a fellow allergy sufferer, you take a Zyrtec or two to keep the sniffles in check.  This was pretty gross.  The wait time for food to come out was nuts; but I imagine this was due to short-staffed kitchen, which is sometimes hard to control.  Even after our first entrée came out, they had only brought us a single pack for silverware.  It was impossible to flag them down for anything - even w/ that annoying/hate to say it ""EXCUSE ME!"" that I was forced to call out; so my husband ate the pad thai w/ the massive serving spoon.  We again waited what felt like an eternity for the check; as Waitress Sniffles brought it to us, she dropped one of our fortune cookies on floor in front of us.  She picked it right up and put it on our table.  Yes, I know they are wrapped, and I'm sure the food we had just consumed was riddled w/ much more disgusting things than the outside wrapper of that cookie...BUT IT'S THE PRINCIPAL OF PUTTING FOOD THAT FELL ON THE FLOOR ONTO A GUEST'S TABLE Prices:  I was shocked.  Shocked, I tell you.  Never in my thai-loving days have I ever seen pad thai for $17.  This is not Arun's Thai, guys.  Yelp has the ""$$"" rating absolutely incorrect.  Most thai places have entrees that could serve 2 people easily, and the quantity here was not anything different from the norm.  The food itself was not bad.  It was fine.  But that leaves a huge mismatch between the price and the taste.  We ordered pad thai tofu; not very flavorful or spiced at all, and there were at best 5 pieces of tofu in the entire entrée.  And we ordered basil fried rice; again, not super flavorful but better than the pad thai due to the basil.   Cleanliness:  Overall fine for a thai place when you walk in and get seated.  If you want to go the restroom, you walk behind a small curtain into what appears to be their ""overflow stock"" area.  Was a huge mess that you would assume they would not want on display.  But the really horrible part was the lack of paper towels and toilet paper in the single bathroom.  Eww. This place was just something else.  The whole evening, my husband and I were waiting for Aston Kutcher to jump out from behind the odd décor and Punk us all.  We just kept waiting...

2015-06-09,3.0,"This place was bookmarked for a while. We got to sit on floor with pillows next to the window. we forgot it was BYOB but oh well. We didn't seem to have huge issues with the wait or service, however, we were only the 2nd group of diners at 6:30pm on Sunday. it was evident that they were short staffed as more customers came in. There was only 1 waitress who was in training and the owner. the owner was friendly and passionate. We went with his recommendations.  I love Thai cuisine but I was expecting something like a usual Thai spot like Opart or Royal. The food was certainly tasty but dishes are prepared differently and pricier. I was expecting something more authentic. We 1st ordered what was labeled as crab puffs. I was expecting some sort of stuffed pastry. This was just fried crab rangoon with a lot of flavorless cream cheese with tiny bits of imitation crab. this was the most disappointing part of the dinner. This had me confused on how the rest of the meal was going to be.    My go-to dish to test a place is the ground chicken and basil (pad kra prow). They had some sort of version was this which tasted amazing with the flavors soaking the rice into a soggy goodness. It made for tasty leftovers too.  We also got the Penang curry noodles with chicken as well. the owner suggested/assumed chicken to us. I figured to go with what he said as it's a small operation and it may be best to go with what they have on hand or what they may be good at. I liked that parts of the rice noodle was charred crisp while still semi soft but the middle clump of boiled noodles was left unaltered by the chef. it wasn't mixed into the curry or stirred in the pan. I wasn't sure if it intentional or they forgot to mix in the curry. Other than that it tasted fine.  Overall, the entrees were good. I think there are other more authentic places without the high price tag to try.",0.9959,0.804,0.17,0.025,0.5201624215577705
2015-05-09,3.0,"If I could leave two different reviews based upon the service vs. the food, I would. Let me start with the food. The food is superb. It is some of the best Thai food I've had in Chicago, and the quality is consistent. One of my favorites is the Crispy Basket, which is delicious. We live a couple blocks away, so it's an easy walk over. Now for the service. It is appallingly, inexcusably, unprofessionally SLOW. If you come on a weeknight, at an off time, you may be OK if you're willing to wait at least a half hour for your food, but our average wait time during off times is 45 minutes. We will no longer go on a weekend night as the last three times we've gone, we have waited between an hour to an hour and a half for our food. I will order delivery, as I live a couple blocks away, but my last delivery order took one hour and fifty minutes to arrive. Granted, that was a Saturday night, but still far too long to wait. As I said, we like the food, and Anthony, the owner, is a great guy and manages to put out exceedingly good Thai food. But this place seriously understaffed, and needs to rethink its approach to dealing with busy time periods, and do something to get food out in a reasonable amount of time.

2014-09-30,3.0,"This is a restaurant that I must have walked by a hundred times. I wasn't ever even sure it was open. And then I see here that the reviews are mostly positive -- overwhelmingly so. My experience was quite different. Let me start by saying that the food is very, very good. I'll get back to the food in a minute. Anthony greeted me at the door - I had made a reservation and he seemed to know it was me. I liked him right away -- friendly, gregarious, welcoming. I chose one of the traditional seats by the window, the kind where you take your shoes off and sit on a pillow. The rest of my party -- my partner and daughter -- arrived at 6pm. We ordered at 6:10 -- appetizer, soup, and two mains. The pot stickers were extraordinary -- fresh, delicious. The problem was they took 50 minutes. That was disappointing. While the waitstaff was running around like crazy, the restaurant was only about 30% full. The problem, it seemed, where the takeaway orders. Repeatedly, people were walking up to the counter only to be told that their order was going to be another 20 minutes. Some waited, some left and came back. Sometimes when they left and came back they were told it was going to be another 10 minutes. Most of the takeaway customers seemed to take it in stride. At 7:15 (over an hour after we ordered it), our Tom Kha Gai arrived. It was a generous bowl for $10 -- we barely made a dent in it. My daughter absolutely loved it -- it was her first experience with it. Tom Kha Gai in a Thai restaurant is kind of like Chili Rellenos at a Mexican restaurant for me; it's really how I judge the overall quality. This soup (this 65 minute soup) was outstanding. The chicken and the mushrooms were simply divine and the broth had a little heat but did not overwhelm the flavor. Meanwhile I was listening to Anthony taking a phone order -- an hour-and-a-half for delivery. Given that our main dishes hadn't arrived yet, I thought that was a little ambitious. At 7:45 our main dishes arrived. They were a mixed bag: the squid in black ink was amazing but the curry was weak both in flavor and ingredients.  Now here's the kicker -- once we signaled that we were finished and ready to go, it was another 25 minutes before they returned with our food (which we had asked to be packed up) and the bill. That was extremely aggravating. The next day, when I opened up what I confidently thought might be a significant portion of the Tom Kha Gai for lunch, I found barely a 1/2 cup. I don't know if they spilled the rest or mixed my leftovers with someone else's, but that really pissed me off.  While I don't want to discount all the glowing reviews I think there are some things going on at Thai Spice that need correcting. For starters, the kitchen is clearly understaffed (which happens in restaurants for lots of valid reasons). However, the front of the house needs to make this clear to customers. To be fair, the menu does state clearly that the food is cooked to order and, so, takes time. but over 45 minutes for pot stickers? Whatever the process is working in the kitchen should not bleed over into the relatively simple task of clearing dishes and totaling a bill. The prices, by the way, are reasonable. So we will be back but we'll probably order ahead or just do takeout. And if I order my favorite soup ever again I certainly won't trust them to transfer what I can't finish -- I'll do it myself. Finally, the entire front of the house needs to be (re)trained on two timeless service strategies: 1) never go back to the kitchen empty handed, clear finished plates away, especially when you've just been to the table to bring the next course, and 2) communicate with your customers. Let them know what's going on. I wanted so badly to really love this place. Clearly it deserves a second chance. But, at the same time, I think future customers need to be aware of the general confusion that my experience seemed to consist of.",0.9929,0.832,0.117,0.051,0.505588071188071

2014-05-23,3.0,"This restaurant is overrated. I regret going there... First of all, if you are a constant Asian food lover, you know their Pad Thai is not authentic. In Thai cooking there are four flavors sour, sweet, creamy and salty. Nothing is really presented in their Pad Thai dish I ordered. The Pad Thai I had was basically just noodles in A LOT of crunchy peanut butter - if you like peanut butter of course you will think the pad thai is tasty. Second, their price is really expensive. This restaurant is not in a prime location (5-10 minutes from the north end of Lakeshore Drive), while you can find a really good pad thai dish in LP/LV neighborhood for under $10. In Thai Spice they charge you $15+. Their calamari is $10 where I can taste it's mostly frozen squid that was really mushy/spongy, and you can tell there is no way it is fresh. My friend ordered a fish dish which was actually made of frozen pomfret fish (ocean fish), and the dish was $20+. This type of fish is super cheap in a grocery store's frozen aisle. (Yes, we trusted all the good reviews, thinking the pricy dishes may be worth it.) Third, we waited 20-30 minutes for our food to arrive when only there were a few customers in the restaurant. Longer than waiting in a michelin-star restaurant. Overall, I would really give 2 stars but the owner seems friendly. My recommendation to the owner: the low quality food materials you use do not actually cost you much money.

2014-03-11,4.0,"It's a little shameful that I don't eat here as much as I do. Why? Because I am literally neighbors with this fine restaurant. (As in, I've heard the owner shoveling the sidewalks at 3:30 in the morning while trying to sleep...) The only thing that tends to hold me back from ordering regularly is the price... if you've read any other review on yelp, you'll know that this Thai food is on the pricey side. As with most things, however, you get what you pay for - and in this case, it is delicious food.  I just finished devouring the Panang Noodles with pork and it was phenomenal. I was feeling indecisive, so I walked over to the restaurant and talked with the owner (Yes, he is as wonderful and friendly as everyone says). I told him what I was craving (which, at the time, was wide, crispy rice noodles and something spicy) and he offered a few different choices, carefully explaining each one. I ended up choosing the Panang noodles off of the owners excitement alone... He was passionate about the food and it was addicting to listen to. I chose it without question. (I should note at this point, that I was getting this meal as a carryout and told him I was the only one eating, but the Panang Noodle dish, with nothing else, ended up costing around $20.00. The portion size was huge and I could have easily split it up into two separate meals but I didn't... I am in a heavenly Thai food coma because I ate it all.) #noregrets I have been here before and have gotten the Pad Thai (off of recommendations from other reviews - it was delicious, but I wouldn't go out of my way to order it again). There is obvious care and attention in the final product of each dish I've tried, and in the end, that makes the price worth it for me. Also, it is important to note: If you've never been to this place before and are looking for the entrance... look to the right of the 'open' sign for a large, solid wooden door that is closed, then push it to enter. This door can be open in nicer weather, but during the colder times, it tends to be closed. I've personally seen it confuse people.",0.9787,0.869,0.102,0.028,0.5104039479039479

I don't actually eat fish so that's as much as I can tell you (my friend ordered it.) The owner came out and explained the recipe to us...he's incredibly nice and helpful. What a lovely man!  I had the cashew chicken. Nothing special, and not the best I've ever had (that honor still goes to Star of Siam!)  Crab puffs (rangoons) were really yummy and crispy. Thai iced tea was also very good and sweet. They even gave us a complimentary refill on those! Definitely order it if you've never tried it.  Atmosphere: kind of dark with soft lovely music playing. Gorgeous table cloths but they cover them with white paper...although I see the necessity for doing so.  All in all, I would come back (I want to try the Tom Kha soup!) but it is pretty highly priced for Thai food and definitely not my go-to place in the neighborhood (shout out to SushiThai III).

To start out, it has a cozy atmosphere with gentle music playing in the background. You are almost always greeted by the owner when you walk in, unless he is with a table. These are the unimportant things, the real reason is the food. Firstly, Thai Spice does it right when it comes to hot food. They have a hotness scale that ranges from 1-5 (or if you have been there enough, going above 5 is allowed, but usually with a warning). As a spicy food lover, I have only been able to make it to 8. But the spice is not just an addition or more spicy ingredient, but rather a different blend of peppers. So you do not sacrifice taste for spice. Even without spice, their entrees are amazing. Their Pad Thai will always be my favorite dish (add a little spice), but they also make a great Pad Gaprow Kai (I believe) and many other dishes. I have eaten my way through about half of the lunch/dinner options and have yet to be disappointed. Four stars because the price of Pad Thai rose, but that's understandable.

(be warned- ""very hot"" is VERY hot) 3.  cozy, friendly atmosphere, plenty of space and clean The price scale is a little bit higher than most other thai places, but well worth it.  The food may take anywhere between 15-20 min to be ready, so if you visit, give yourself time.  Again, all well worth it.  Very special care and attention is given to each dish to ensure ultimate taste bud satisfaction.  Plus you can enjoy a nice glass of wine or a cold beer while you wait.   I had the Green Curry, being Mexican, I love my food spicy and thought I'd go the extra mile and get this dish VERY HOT.  In turn, I received some very delicious green curry with plenty of heat packed into it.  The texture and combination of heat, spice, and chicken was perfect.  My friend ordered the Spicy Pomfret fish but as it turns out they were out (it is probably their best and most popular dish).  So to compensate, the owner offered to replace the Pomfret with the Red Snapper which normally costs more but gave to us at the Pomfret price.  The fish was perfectly cooked and coated with this red delicious pasty sauce which perfectly paired up with the fresh white rice.   All in all, I was very impressed, and this will be my new ""special"" thai place to go to when I have friends visiting or for those that are tired of the same old offerings from your typical thai restaurant.",0.9986,0.704,0.278,0.018,0.5801980723678837
2012-09-04,3.0,"Honestly, the food is the only saving grace for this restaurant. The service, on many occasions, is very unattentive and slow - even on nights when there's only 4-5 tables...not at all crowded. You can expect to spend close to 4 hours from the moment you sit down to when you finish your food and receive your bill. It's excruciating to see the owner, who is supposed to be serving you, sit down with another table for a chat (a very long chat)! We had to beg the other server to get him to take our orders...instead, she took our orders after a good hour and a half of neglect. So, just a tip: Since it is BYOB, drink up! It'll help you get through the wait...slightly. NOW, moving away from the service (or lack thereof)...the food is fantastic! And spicy! This place has the best Lad Nar Noodles in all the land of Chicago. also, their Pad Woon Sen is great. My boyfriend always gets the Panang Curry with beef (with a level 1 added spice)...next time, we are leaving out any additional heat, it's spicy enough on its own. Delicious though!

We swapped tons of stories about motorcycles and he even provides some life maxims to help out us young folk. So already, service is definitely deserving of 5 stars! As for the food, Thai Spice features usual Thai fare that you can find similiarly at a number of other Edge Water and Rogers Park establishments such as Summer or Thai Grill. The menu is spartan, but its simplicity as as-well as Anthony will help you find just exactly what you're craving.  I ordered the Pad Sew Ewe and my friend the Lad Nar. Both came out piping hot temperature wise, but pleasantly spicy to taste. Portions are generous, and the only complaints I have about Thai Spice are that it's hours are subject to its owners' whims. (In the 2 years I have lived in this neighborhood, I have tried on at least 6 different occasions to eat here, only to find it closed.)

Dish seemed to be unique and was spicy. Cons: 1) Service took forever. We actually went to Uncommon Ground initially but the wait was 25 minutes. So my friend saw Thai Spice and said, ""Let's just go there!"" Thai food is pretty fast, right? It took an hour to get our food. We were dying of starvation! We ordered the Panang Curry which the owner explained is their signature dish. It was good....but...and that leads me to.... 2) it was a bit pricy. My fault for not looking at the menu. My friend suggested it and I wanted to go out of my comfort zone so I was like, ""OK me too."" It was $17. My issue with that is, to me, it was like any other order such as Pad Thai or Pad See Ew. With all due respect to how tasty it was, I really don't think the portion or what it was (noodles and tofu) justified $17. Overall, a good restaurant, good experience. I will just be smarter about ordering something that takes less time to cook *AND* that is a little less expensive.  I'll take responsibility for not asking how long the dish takes to cook and the fact that I didn't pay attention to the price.

I still have yet to find my ""perfect"" Thai restaurant.  Yelp led me to try Thai Spice after reading very positive reviews. I was meeting a friend who was coming from Evanston and meeting in Rogers Park was equidistant for both of us. In fact, said friend was the person who first introduced me to Thai food some 25+ years ago. We looked over the menu, which is different than the standards you'd find on most Thai menus. Sure they have Pad Thai and the like, but also some interesting curries and seafood dishes. She and I were both intrigued by the basil squid but wanted to ask what else was in it before we decided. We hadn't been approached by our server yet but we finally flagged down a young, petite blonde. When asked about the basil squid, she said ""I know there's squid and basil in it."" Thanks, Captain Obvious. When we pressed for more info (we wanted to know if there were any vegetables in it), she really couldn't answer. Thankfully the owner came over to assist. We asked him for recommendations and he steered us toward the Panang noodles with Indonesian shrimp and the Mongolian beef.  We also started with chicken satay, which was very good, but there was no cucumber salad served with it. Isn't that a standard accompaniment?  Our entreés arrived and while not small portions by any means, I didn't find them to be as enormous as I was expecting. The noodles were slightly caramelized and there was plenty of shrimp, but the sauce wasn't very curry-like; it was more peanut-y. Still, we both enjoyed them.  The Mongolian beef was better than average. The quality was there, but I was hoping for spicier than I got.  The service was not the best but we were reminded several times by our server that she was ""new"" and it was a busy night. We had to flag her down to get the check and again had to find her to settle up. She looked like she wanted to cry when we put two credit cards down and asked to split the bill evenly. The bill was $48.40, which is easy enough to divide, but we had to tell her exactly what to run on each card. I felt kind of bad for her as she seemed very overwhelmed. We tipped her generously because she did her best under the circumstances.  It's true the owner is a very pleasant fellow and the food was very good. Prices are much higher than standard Thai restaurants but I only found the portion sizes to be only somewhat larger than is customary, but not commensurate with what we paid.

He will seat you and then give you a well rounded Thai menu. If you are unsure of what to order just say so and he will ask you a few questions about your preferences and make suggestions. If your still not sure he will make you a dish that is totally made to your preferences! I have never met an owner that cares more about the quality of his food and patrons as much as Anthony.  When I went, my girlfriend and I sat in the low table window seat which is very quaint. Anthony sat down at the end of the table to take our order and made sure he understood that I can't take spicy food and what would be satisfying for me in a dish. They make everything from scratch and fresh. How cool is that? They were out of chopped potatoes so they actually peeled and chopped new ones for my dish...what restaurant does that? It was like a home made meal. So delish.  The decor is traditional with a few low tabled window seats that include pillows and you take off your shoes for these. I'm sure if you have funky feet you could avoid this but why ruin the nice pillows? There are tables with white paper available. Yes the walls are a little bare, but with such attention to detail in the food why care? The front of the building is quiet so if driving you have to make sure you don't miss it. Metered parking is available or you can usually find a spot on the non-permit street.

2011-02-21,5.0,"This is by far still my Favorite Thai Restaurant of all time.  I used to come here with my College friends 14 years ago when I attended Loyola University (a short walking distance).  I remember the place being really small, but intimate.  The owner, host and waiter, Anthony was always very friendly and gracious, and I always remember how great the food tasted; so rich with flavor.  The cook is the owner's wife so much care was given to the quality and preparation of the food.  I haven't been back for many years now as  I had moved to the suburbs for work. This past Saturday weekend I had the opportunity to come back to my old college hangout with a group of friends that have never been here before.  One of them suggested a Thai restaurant and he lived in the area, so I quickly jumped on the opportunity to suggest this place.  I have to admit, I was a bit concerned not knowing if this place was going to be under new management or if the food was going to be as good as I remembered back when I was in College. Upon arrival, I was surprised to see the outside of the restaurant had not changed at all.  In fact it brought back a rush of memories from my College Days gone by.  Stepping inside, I was surprised to see the restaurant had expanded and doubled in size.  No longer were there the cramped small tables and everyone seated so tightly together; instead, there were now plenty of room and enough room for everyone to comfortably seat together.  I was also very happy to see Anthony who is still greeting and seating people to their tables.  After all these years, he still remembered me and said I have not changed.  I was so delighted not allot has changed. I was a bit concerned still as there were only two full tables in the restaurant, but as soon as we got our order, the whole place filled up, and I mean fast and we were lucky to beat the Saturday night crowd.  We had ordered the Thai Sampler which came with a variety of Thai egg rolls, fried tofu, chicken Satay, and crab Rangoon with 2 different types of sauces.  The appetizer sampler was a big hit as it came with 4 servings of each and everyone at the table had their share of the appetizers.  The Thai fried eggroll with the glass noodles was simply the best and exploded with so much flavor, while the crab Rangoon was very good and filled with the best tasting crab filling; it was simply fantastic.  But the chicken satay, I have to admit I've had better at other Thai restaurants. Our entrees though brought back memories.  We had ordered the Pad Thai, Beef with green pepper, Spicy Basil Beef and Chicken Cashew nuts. Everything was prepared fresh and exploded with so much flavors....It was still as good as I remembered 14 years agol   But I will always remember their Pad Thai.  I have not encountered any other place that served the best Pad Thai as this restaurant.  It was so rich and bold and just the right amount of spices and a hint of sweetness.  Honestly the BEST Pad Thai in the city.   There is plenty of parking on the streets even on a Saturday night, and they do except reservations.  Did I mention the place is BYOB.  They do not charge extra if you bring your own alcohol.

Not sure if it's like this every weekend but do me a favor... don't tell anyone about this place so we can keep it a secret, OK? Got it? Good. Let's pinky swear on that.  Anyhoo, we entered and were greeted by very friendly people. We got to sit on pillows in a window table. Very comfy.

It helps when you want to nap between courses, or hide under the table and surprise your server when they come back. Always hilarious!  Anyhoo pt. 2, Electric Boogaloo.  I was super-hungry and just wanted to get food into my munching cave, and the service didn't disappoint. They were quick and courteous in taking our order, but also gave us some breathing room while we ate. I hate when servers are all over you while you eat, checking in too much.

The flavors were savory, spicy and super tasty.

2009-05-15,5.0,"First off, we must address the complaints about this place being ""overpriced"". Nonsense. This place is slightly more expensive, however, one must keep in mind the old adage: you pay for what you get.  All of Thai Spice's food is excellent, homemade deliciousness. The eggrolls are handmade and quite frankly the best I've ever had -- and they're served with homemade sweet and sour sauce. Yes, even the sauce was homemade. Despite the fact that this place is seriously out of the way for me, I plan on eating there frequently because food of this quality and caliber is not easy to come by (unless you happen to be Thai and your mom is a rockin' Thai Chef). I'll also jump on the bandwagon and mention that Anthony, the owner, is incredibly warm, friendly, helpful, and ever-present. Don't be put off by the big German dude that owns a Thai restaurant -- I have it on good authority that his wife is Thai, and that she (along with her mother) are the chefs that are responsible for the parade of deliciousness that will be making its way across your table. Nutshell: if you appreciate the quality of a home cooked, highly authentic, and absolutely delicious Thai meal, then make your way here. If you're more interested in a gargantuan menu that will save you $3 per entree... then by all means, make your way to a different establishment.",0.9888,0.782,0.177,0.041,0.5131944444444444

My Shrimp Pad Thai was no more generous than any other portion I've received at other restaurants, but was 5 dollars more.  It was inedible because it had wayy too much peanut sauce and was extremely salty.  The noodles and shrimp were overcooked.  The lime that was included for flavoring was dry and sort of crumbled when I tried to use it.  I counted a grand total of 5 ""jumbo shrimp"". (Which they charged me 3.95 for.  I didn't specify jumbo shrimp, and a regular addition of shrimp read 1.95 on the menu.) My Tom Kha soup was a complete failure.  It lacked any other ingredients other than the rubbery chicken, TONS of old looking white mushrooms and two large pieces of ginger root.  It had almost no flavor and seemed to separate before my very eyes.  Needless to say, that followed the pad thai into the garbage as well. All in all, I wasted 30 dollars (just for the pad thai and soup) on a meal I didn't even eat.  If you're looking for a quality Thai restaurant, this isn't the place.",-0.5204,0.87,0.056,0.073,0.47566839290977225

This place is local to me, but not so good that I'd order take-out, and the space is not so nice as to make it worth the trip.
