Highly recommend the Crab Rangoon, Szechuan Chicken, and Sesame Chicken. Yum.  Order for delivery or pickup though - the place itself (if going there in person) has kinda a strange decor and vibe (and most people are usually doing delivery/pickup).",0.9238,0.758,0.196,0.045,0.44571428571428573

However I had to drive home to the West Loop from here but my crab rangoons were warm and my egg roll was hot even when I got home. The egg roll was tasty, but a bit on the greasy side. I also ordered the dinner sweet and sour chicken. (~$10 with chicken fried rice and an egg roll included) I would advise you to order the sweet and sour sauce on the side because it became very gelatin like by the time I got home. The chicken was no longer crispy and was soggy. Gross. It was edible but not that great. I would advise the business to also include the sauce on the side to avoid this because it really ruins the meal. I do think there prices are a little high for the quality.

2017-04-11,1.0,"Wow, Lee's quality has dropped off immensely since my last review. Only a handful items (potstickers, wonton soup) from the menu is ok but, much like their other dishes it's starting to slip in quality.  I dont know if its a whole new cook or the cook just doesnt give a shit anymore. For example, they had great eggrolls where you can taste every individual ingredient inside. Now it's glop whch looks like peanut paste inside the eggroll which makes it taste like it's unfinished.  General Tsos chicken came out too sweet even after I ordered it extra spicy. Its wasnt even mildly spicy. Nor was our Szechwan shrimp. Whats the point of having an indicator on their menu showing that certain dishes are spicy hot when theyre not. If anything, its barely mild. Chicken chow mein has always come in a light sauce but here it comes out watery and dark. Even when they were good they had some of these issues but it was minor at the moment. But now they let these problems grow and its out of hand. It shows they no longer care. You pay more for bad quality now. I know this is Americanized Chinese food but that doesnt mean they should drop in quality in making delicious food.

The lady on the phone asks for my number, address, then puts me on hold to answer another food-related call. It was so bizarre because I heard her talking to another customer with the same problem. She asked what time they ordered (which was 6:30 btw) and asked for her number and address. So, basically I got the other person's phone number -- that's how careless these people are. I hung up and called back because I was sitting there listening to her help someone else on the phone when I called first.  When I called back, she said they don't have my order (I ordered from eat24) and asked what address I ordered from. I told her the address SHE was at, and she preceded to rant about how there are other locations and maybe I ordered from another location.. right after I told her it was the location she's at! Then, in the middle of the conversation, the driver CALLED. She was hung up on, and the driver said he was a few minutes away. SO, basically, the lady bullshitted and we had to wait 2 hours for some cheap ass Chinese food.  UPDATE: The food wasn't good. And I'm not bias because the service was so horrible.  Hot & Sour Soup. This was edible, but it tasted like watered down Tabasco. 1.5/5. Orange chicken - it was soooo soggy. And gloopy. And it had a slight taste of orange, but not really. It was weird. 1/5 Kung Pao Chicken - my boyfriend absolutely hated it. More than I hated mine. The sauce was literally the consistency of water. Brownish red water. He took one bite and threw it away. 0/5 The egg roll - again, one bite and he threw it away. I took a bite and agreed. It had a chemical taste.

She threw menus on the table and came back with waters.  MY GOD  - I was already pissed off!  She instantly ruined my mood; like she is doing me a favor for me being there...  HORRIBLE!!!  Who the heck let HER deal with the customers.  The only thing that came out of her mouth was: ""You ready to order?""   For a Chinese ""hole in a wall"" restaurant, the prices were THROUGH THE ROOF! Completely UNREASONABLE!  They do not offer Lunch Specials on Sundays and they definitely should consider since it was DEAD in there - we were the only table in the entire restaurant.  I was still willing to give it a try since I heard they had really good eggrolls.  There was no ambiance; there was absolutely nothing special about this place.  If anything, they should close it for a week (AT LEAST) and clean the entire place from top to bottom. We ordered Eggrolls, Crab Rangoon for appetizer and for entrées some noodle dish, Mongolian Beef, Egg Foo Young and shrimp fried rice. The appetizers weren't too bad, but NOTHING special!  When the food came out, it immediately looked depressing.  There was hardly ANY vegetables, even though the noodle dish was supposed to come with plenty of veggies.  Instead it had 2-3 pea pods, DROWNED with the sprouts, and barely any meat; but they weren't cheap with the noodles... Hmmmmm... I wonder why....  I ordered Mongolian Beef because I thought to myself: ""How could anyone mess up Mongolian Beef?!?!?""  Oh, how wrong I was....    Since it was mostly a meat dish - the serving size was HALF of the other dishes. Ok, whatever... But once again, they are SUPER cheap with the vegetables - there was barely any green onion in it.  When I tried it - OH MY GOD; my mouth was ON FIRE!  I could not even taste the food.  I tried drowning it in Sweet and Sour Sauce, but nothing helped.  Don't get me wrong, I love spicy food and have some sort of spicy sauce or salsa, or peppers with almost every meal, but I draw the line when I cannot taste the food.  Shrimp fried rice was nothing special at all and shrimp was a little undercooked. THE FOOD WAS NOT GOOD AT ALL!!!  Not to mention, the ""Ray Of Sunshine"" lady server never came back and some other man took over.   The bill came... $80.00 for 2 appetizers and 3 dishes - that is INSANE!  We just literally paid almost $100 for CRAP food in a nasty dirty place.  GROSS!!!!!   I do not know HOW this place has 3.5 stars  Did the good reviews come from family and friends?  My GOD!  NEVER AGAIN!",-0.9387,0.731,0.123,0.146,0.5568836405529956

The service is always friendly and on the spot when dining in. The food, although some of the dishes are greasy like the chicken fingers it's very good.

The Lee's combo fried rice is very good the egg rolls are large and crispy but it seems to have changed a bit in the past 2 years.

Order the wonton soup, it may not be your typical wonton soup but it definitely has a light broth with tasty flat noodles. The menu reads out like your typical non seated pick up joint but unlike those restaurants (looking at you rude ass Choi's) they actually put the effort in making it taste in every dish.

I'm very very very picky when it comes to Chinese food. Being from NYC, they have an array of fantastic Chinese food, and I was quite disappointed when I moved to Chicago that there really isn't any good Chinese places, especially in the North Side (Chinatown is good, but so far away).  Lee's Chop Suey is the closest to what Chinese food SHOULD taste like. You can usually tell when their Lo Mein Noodles are used with dark sauce, instead of light sauce. Lee's has great lo mein (which is hard to find in Chicago). They are also moderately priced, and have bubble tea! The people are nice, they're never running too late, and you can understand them when you call on the phone. Overall, I would recommend this place to everyone in the northwest side who hasn't found their #1 Chinese place yet.

2010-05-26,5.0,"I've been the biggest critic of Chinese restaurants in my decades living in Chicago. I'll be the first to tell you that most Chinese restaurants all taste the same and all dishes taste like either meat and brocolli or a deep-fried, sweet & sour dish. In fact, most of these small, hole-in-the-wall locations all buy their food precooked and frozen from large distributors. Lee's Chop Suey was the first time in years that I was pleasantly surprised by the Chinese food! It was not pretentious, plentiful and delicious. This review is written after possibly,15 times now that I have ordered from them. I have yet to ever get a negative tasting dish or a negative experience from the staff. In fact, even the owner came by our table once to check up on us and make sure we were OK. In no way attempting to be generalizational, it seems that most Asian restaurants have (what appears to be) cold and indifferent staff and actually I have come to expect that. Lee's truly was the exception. Of the breaded dishes (sesame,  general tso's, empress, sweet and sour)...my favourite is the Empress Chicken because it's spicy followed by the Chicken Oriental which is a breaded chicken patty sliced into sliver placed over a bed of broccolli. Of their vegetable oriented dishes, I really enjoyed the Chicken Kow (which also comes in beef). Their appetizers all taste different and delicious, something that also lacks from many Chinese takeout joints where everything tastes like oily crud. Their pot stickers are humungous and plentiful (although oily) and their eggrolls have so much flavour to them. Their won ton soup is great too. It took me a few years of living in the area to finally find a good place to get delivery from and I finally found it! Thank you Lee's!",0.9879,0.812,0.147,0.04,0.5289781746031746
2010-04-15,2.0,"Reviews have failed me yet again.  The only item worth mention and different to any other Chinese restaurant in the city is their egg roll. They took the egg roll contents and tossed it with a Thai peanut sauce then fried it and the result is a piping hot egg roll with significant taste. The taste is mildly peanutty, some would easily think the egg roll had a bit of peanut butter inside. Does peanut butter or peanut satay sauce appeal to you? I used a combination of sweet and sour sauce and sriracha to balance the flavor for my taste buds. I had one egg roll I took to go which I reheated the next day. Warmed in the toaster oven and the taste had changed. That day the contents tasted hella salty, what happened??  One thing that bothered me about the meal overall was the feel of oil. Everything was oily. The shrimp toast appetizer was like a sponge for oil, not something I want to ever eat again. All of our dishes had an oily feel to them which left us feeling gross. A full night planned stopped short soon after dinner. An appetizer plate for two, General Tso's chicken and Orange beef. Cost $42 dollars with tax and tip. Twenty dollars per person seemed too high a burden for bad food and no free hot tea! Everything tasted the same, especially the entrees. The only difference, orange zest in the sauce for the beef dish and crushed red pepper flakes in the sauce of the General Tso's. The Tso's chicken tasted overcooked or pre-made and then applied to sauce. It had that consistency for me and did not win either of us over. I still have a full order of it, hate to throw it out, but I'm not going to eat it. Orange beef I won't even bother, it wasn't good, more average really.  The draw for me was the restaurant. Reminded me of Chinese restaurants I frequented as a kid with my folks. Fanciful, lit, paper lantern chandeliers with colors of red and green. Red tassels hanging down from the lanterns. Old school Asian inscribed chairs and some tables. Cloudy windows from years of keeping in the smells of prepared foods. The name Lee's Chop Suey, I don't ever eat chop Suey. Wikipedia it if you don't know. In the 80's there were many ""chop Suey"" named Chinese restaurants that were decent. This was just average and grossly overrated.  If I ever happen back, I have to give them the spicy taste testing. An order of shrimp fried rice and some kind of meat in garlic spice, both made spicy. If it comes out with flavor and a good amount of spice, I'd redo the review.",-0.8703,0.898,0.039,0.062,0.42302935010482173

We tried a couple different dishes - the beef and broccoli had a nice mix of beef, broccoli, and carrots with a tasty brown sauce that wasn't too salty.  The beef was tender and had good flavor.

Never again.  From now on, I'll be far more careful when weighing Yelpers' reviews.  A bad $30 spent for sure.",0.7863,0.706,0.173,0.121,0.5507777777777778
2008-09-22,5.0,"This is our Chinese place; our one and only.   I have never actually been into Lee's, but we get their delivery a lot.  It's actually my favorite Chinese delivery in the city!   Their food is great.  It's a higher quality than most other Chinese restaurants I've been to and it's cooked to perfection.  I used to only get sweet and sour chicken from most restaurants, knowing that it probably wouldn't be really bad.  However, I've found that many of the entrees at Lee's are really good so I've branched out and tried new things. They have the greatest egg rolls ever.  I just wanted to throw that out there.  Veggie or with meat, does not matter - best ever.  They also make excellent almond cookies (I guess most Chinese places do) and always give you extra fortune cookies with your order.   I definitely will have to give the restaurant itself a try since they advertise good lunch specials and are BYOB!",0.9931,0.73,0.24,0.029,0.5054152637485971

2008-08-14,4.0,"Somewhere between 3 & 4 stars, but I'm bumping them up because they were fast and accurate.  So many times you order chinese and they get it wrong and you're screwed.  The egg rolls are really really rich and pretty greasy and not in a good way. It was almost as if they had rolled them too thick and they couldn't fry them solid.  But the crab rangoon were fantastic.  We also got the general tso's chicken which was wonderful, could have used a little more white rice with the order, I'll probably order an extra side of rice in the future.  The Lee family fried rice is very tasty.  Like most chinese places in chicago they seem to think that the rice needs to be completely coated in soy sauce which makes it really salty, but if you like it like that you'll love it.  I used GrubHub to order online and it was really easy.",0.9854,0.719,0.212,0.069,0.49871794871794867
2008-04-18,4.0,"AVOID THE COOKIES. Otherwise we had a good meal at Lee's Chop Suey and it was only $15 for two people. As everyone else has said, their potstickers are delicious and top quality. I was amazed at their construction and how tightly the wonton was wrapped up around the delicious meat inside.  We also shared an order of Kung Pao chicken and I am so glad we did because a single order was ENORMOUS. Tasty and fresh, we really enjoyed our main dish. The kid  who was our waiter was attentive with the water and more rice, and the owner/manager was also friendly and helpful.  Now the decor is total old school wood paneling and feels like you are in somebody's basement den ready to listen to some old Led Zeppelin records. So it's April and there are still Valentine's Day decorations as well as... is that Christmas tinsel? It has that hole in the wall charm, if you're into that sort of thing. Word of advice, stick with the packaged fortune cookies and avoid the large almond cookies they bring to you. They are not good and probably came out of some box they've had since the 1970s.",0.9899,0.775,0.202,0.022,0.6164502164502165

But I was skeptical. I didn't try it until one day I saw THREE of their delivery vehicles - IN ONE DAY. Finally, I called in an order, and God was I satisfied. The egg rolls are amazing. I could eat about twelve of them Harry-Carrey-Hot-Dog-style. I also ordered the sesame chicken. Dare I say that they have the best fake American Chinese food in the city? When my order came, it had a menu on it. It stated that Lee's was celebrating its 40th anniversary. If I could go back in time to my freshman year of college, I'd replace all those orders from ""Chinese Kitchen"" or ""China Chef"" or ""Chinese Chef"" or ""China Kitchen"" with trips to Lee's.

2008-01-26,3.0,"This is going to take some explanation so try and keep up... On a quest to find a watering hole near the movie theater (p.s. haven't found one because they boarded up and closed Humberto's across the street) we ventured to Lee's. The reason being, it clearly states ""Cocktails"" on the giant sign. We walk in and come to find out that it was all a scam! The place is a BYOB and there is a shady liquor store next store. Luckily we came prepared and were able to summon some manly brew from our coat pockets.  We ordered some appetizers because we felt bad just sitting there drinking our own beer...Eggrolls, Crab Rangoon, Potstickers, and Chicken Fingers. The consensus was that it was all pretty disgusting, however, it does earn 3 stars because of the insane amount of comedic value of the place to us personally, so please take that into consideration before looking at this place seriously.",0.5398,0.803,0.111,0.085,0.659375
2007-12-29,5.0,"Holy east-coast style Chinese take-out Batman! No seriously, everything from the amount of ginger and green onions in their soy sauce for dipping potstickers to the bits of freshly minced garlic you'll find in their white sauces along with a slight white wine taste - this is my jam right here. Funny thing is that their eggrolls are much better leftover and cold (they're standard size Chinese eggrolls to me).  Usually I don't order General Tso's, Orange, or Sesame anything because at most take-out places, it mights no fricking difference. It's the same damn food-coloring infused corn syrup on chicken nuggets as Panda Express, but not here. Check this out, the Sesame Chicken tastes of sesame oil, the General Tso's chicken comes with chile peppers and green onions, and the Orange chicken tastes of actual oranges! That alone gets my mouth watering. It's also a bit heart-warming that they stock both RC Cola and Coca-Cola.  The inside is kind of funny to me because it's all that old red-mahogany furniture that almost every Chinese family I knew had in their fine-dining room and the seats are covered in the same plastic. I've never been seated in one of those chairs at the beautiful tables, just like growing up.",0.9126,0.875,0.085,0.041,0.4656349206349206

I don't even know if there was a Bucktown at the time. It was just straight-up Avondale (according to Illinois Bell, anyway). I guess Diversey is the dividing line between Bucktown and Avondale.
