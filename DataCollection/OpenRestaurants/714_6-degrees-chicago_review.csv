Seriously, if you have not tried it yet, do yourself a favor and get your happy arse to 6 Degrees (there's a $10 special on Wednesdays). Imagine your choice of 2 open face sandwiches with mix-and-match meats (there's a tasty veg option too), under a heap of crispy fries, doused in the most sensational white cheese sauce. It's magic. I have yet to try anything else on the menu so I cannot speak for it but I've had their cocktails and draft beers. Great specials, decent prices on mixed drinks and good beer selection. The service can be a bit slow only because this is truly a small, neighborhood with one person behind the bar running the show.

Almost 40 min later, what do we see?  Two taco salads coming our way!  So, like anyone, I asked what happened to our chips and guac?  The servers response was....oh, they're still making it.  REALLY?  It took longer to make the guac than the entire taco salad?  I'm thinking she forgot to place our order correctly.  But whatever.  At that point we just cancelled the order. It's too bad that the taco salad left something to be desired.  The shell had no real flavor, the filling quite stingy and something I could have prepared better myself at home (this says something since I consider myself to be a terrible cook).

I was intrigued when I heard a Chicago pub served horseshoes, a long time college favorite dish. I went to Western in Macomb and there I fell in love with the random slice of bread, topped with a burger patty, waffle fried, neon yellow cheese, (and a choice of) grilled onions, and chili. AMAZING. I tried to find some pictures on their web page, but could not seem to get a close shot of the actual horseshoe. When my burger pony came (pony has one meat and horseshoe has two servings) I couldn't help but be disappointed with a burger, plain unseasoned shoestring fries, and melted white cheese. I suppose I was expecting something else and that is what got me. The burger itself was good and when the fries and cheese were warm, it was quite good. In the future I will not go there to scratch my 'pony itch', but will instead know what I am going to get and that's a good burger in a warm and friendly space.",0.9692,0.81,0.155,0.035,0.4691071428571427

I did end up eating pretty much the whole thing, and was quite full afterwards - but it was totally worth it.  The whole smothering in delicious cheese thing kind of overwhelms how well the meat was cooked, but I think the hamburger had pretty good flavor.  The french fries were great when hot, but didn't have any seasoning, so ended up being kind of bland - which was really the only negative of the meal. There was only one server, and she was quite busy, however she provided great service, making sure that we had everything we needed without being too nosy.

Turns out, it basically translates to cheese on toast.  Cool with me.  And add to that, your choice of hamburger, chicken(regular or buffalo), ham, pulled pork, etc.; and hot, tasty fries, and you've got a great plate of hangover helper.  Or comfort food.  Or, exactly what you need on a rainy November night. Cheese sauce was smooth and delicious.  Hamburger was cooked perfectly.  I wish I had noticed I could've gotten the chicken grilled, but the buffalo was plenty spicy, and when coupled with the rich cheese sauce, made my Buddah belly happy.

It's a bar, so I was expecting bar food for dinner. Of course my guy is drawn to the biggest thing on the menu, their specialty called the Horseshoe. It is two open-faced sandwiches with whatever meat you want on it. Then it's covered in fries and a cheese sauce (like mornay, not nacho cheese). I don't know why I agreed to split this with him in the first place, but I have regrets. The Italian beef is pretty good, but the fries aren't anything special and the cheese sauce isn't flavorful enough to be worth what I imagine is zillions of calories. My friend's build-your-own melt looked a little bit better than what I was eating. We also got the nachos for the table, which were OK but the pulled pork is actually BBQ pulled pork (with BBQ sauce on it) and there's very little guacamole. In fact, we chided and booed my fiance for a good 10 minutes after he ate THE chip that had all the guac on it. It fit on one chip. It comes with the same cheese sauce.

Enter your choice of meat atop texas toast, covered with cheese sauce and french fries. I've watched men work themselves into a bevy of stomach cramps as a result of this dish...evidently, nothing is more emasculating than not finishing all of your shoe in The Field. What's fabulous about Six Degrees is that you get to choose two meats (if you're getting the horse, that is..only one if you get its smaller equine equivalent, the ponyshoe). My usual order is BBQ pulled pork and ham. Last time, they were out of the pulled pork, so I opted for crispy buffalo chicken. I always have to get the full size, so Scott gets my leftovers. There are vegetarian options, too, granted, they are veggie burger or mixed vegetables. The cheese sauce is not your run-of-the-mill sharp cheddar-a'-la'-nasty-nacho-cheese sauce, either...it's special, delicate, absolutely homemade.  Six Degrees usually has drink specials when we're there, which is often the poison we pick. On a weekend morning, I got a bloody mary, which was nice and spicy and served with a baby-sized Corona backer. Loved it.  The owner, Ann, is often there, and has taken excellent care of us. if you are there more than once, she will remember you (especially if you have a Springfield boy who is soon to induce torture upon his intestinal system in tow), which is a sweet little touch that I really adore about a locally-owned business. On another time we went, there was only one poor guy working out front on a pretty busy night and he could have used some backup...other than slightly slower service and forgetting a drink I ordered (I offer, though, I ordered two at once, which is a bit atypical), everything came out as we wanted.

Obviously I don't need to waste time talking about the Horseshoe, as the other reviews have stated, its awesome, don't think about it, just order it.  My girlfriend I like like the Turkey Burger/Pulled Pork combo.   They have amazing Bloody Marys which even come with a Coronita beer back.   They have a great beer selection and the beers are very reasonably priced.  $6 for a Mad Hatter IPA?  I'll take 6.   They always have great music playing, whether it is someone's IPod or Pandora (These days, Ann is all about the Arcade Fire Pandora channel).

2010-12-14,3.0,"There are a lot of bars in Chicago with really obvious names.  The seeming set their name by location (like Bucktown Pub), by which team the bar's patrons support (like the Cubby Bear), and there even a ton of them named after their owners (like Cole's).  Some nomenclature, however, is not self-evident at first blush, so half the fun of the name is figuring it out.   This was what I was doing while waiting for the 50 bus on Damen to go and watch football at this place - wondering what on Earth 6 Degrees meant.  Were they a bar that showed nothing but Kevin Bacon movies?   Once inside the bar, I quickly discovered a possible explaination.  Sitting by the door, the group I went with found ourselves engaged in a shellacking by the wind similar to the shellacking the Bears were taking by the Patriots on the television.  Did the moniker refer to the fact that it was Six Degrees inside the place during the winter?   While we were ill-positioned, there didn't seem to be a place in the bar that was any better.  The entire bar area is in a long wind tunnel facing the door.  The server actually told us that they ""ran out of space heaters"" so they couldn't get us one.  Climate control to match your silly setup, please?  Oh and said server, she gave us 6 Degrees worth of cold shoulder.   I can't totally blame her for not wanting to go near the door, but we were left seriously wanting in the service department.    On the plus side, the beer was cold and there were some diverse kinds to choose from.  I got a $6.00 Guinness, but they also had an alternate, microbrew, stout for the same price.  And the nachos were warm.  Made with real cheese, they were *six* fresh ingredients (including slightly cilantro flavored chips) of delicious.  Unfortunately they were $7.50 instead of the $6 the size would probably denote.  The plate is big but the density of the pile of chips is not.   It turns out (thank you interwebs) that this bar's ""6 Degrees"" actually refers to the theory that everyone is connected by no more than six degrees of separation.  Photos line the walls so you can find your friends in different groups of people.  The next time I'm in here, one thing is sure.   I'll be sure to check them out to see how many groups in the pictures are bundled up in thick coats.",0.9871,0.881,0.101,0.018,0.47947530864197524

She even shouted out a good-bye to me, by name, as I left the bar - in the midst of a huge crowd of people, and a good hour after we chatted. It's a small thing, but she's obviously a smart businesswoman who knows how to keep customers coming back.

It wasn't like when I went into Durkin's and the sign said they had horseshoes... but it turned out to be the game, not the food. That, by the way, finished placing that bar into the completely useless category in my book... but I digress: Coming here was such an internal, emotional struggle. Why? Well, on the one hand I really, really wanted to eat a horseshoe without having to drive 200 miles to do so. On the other hand, I was worried it wouldn't taste any good and I'd break down crying. Thankfully, this was not the case :) woo! The cheese sauce was the key. It was a great sauce, and that really makes or breaks any horseshoe. They also have the option of having one half be one kind of meat and the other be another kind. This is really nice if you can't decide. It's like you're getting two horseshoes in one. WOO! I had half with burger and the other half was buffalo chicken. I almost went into a pleasure coma... as well as a diabetic coma. haha Ok, that was an exaggeration, but seriously. This dish is not for the faint of heart... or health. I'm so glad I went here and I will definitely be back. I also liked how the owner was really friendly and a great hostess.  6 Stars for 6 Degrees!!",0.995,0.665,0.247,0.089,0.5223015873015873

I graduated from WIU, and have been missing a place called the Jackson Street Pub where they make something called a Horseshoe.  The Horseshoe's home base is in Springfield IL.  However, while they are not overly complicated, I can't tell you any place that makes them other than Jackson St Pub and then restaurants in Springfield, until now. 6 Degrees has delivered one of my college comfort food/hangover remedy staples.  Their hamburger horseshoe was fantastic, and their Bloody Mary was excellent as well.  I'm so glad I have a place to go when I'm craving a Horseshoe that is not 4 + hours away.   The service was fantastic.  The women there were very friendly. I could make this a regular occurrence, but my waistline wouldn't appreciate it, since I'd never order off the salad menu (no self control, I'm sure it's delicious.)   Great place, try the horseshoe (or pony)",0.9504,0.8,0.159,0.041,0.7527207977207978

First, I will say that the horseshoes were perfect. Just like I remember when I went to school at U of I down in Champaign. My only problem with the place (and the reason they lose a star) was the service. They totally forgot about us and we could see our horseshoes sitting and waiting for someone to bring them over to us.

2009-08-09,3.0,"*EDIT* I went to 6 degrees last night to watch the Bears game and was pretty disappointed with how it was. The horseshoes were great, but I took off a star because the TV viewing was terrible. The TVs are not placed properly for everyone to be watching AND there is no HD, which made it look pretty bad. Definitely not a place to go and watch a game or anything really on TV. *ORIGINAL* I went to 6 degrees on a weekday at about 5pm looking for something to eat and was unbelievably excited to see a horseshoe on the menu. For those who do not know what that is, it is two pieces of Texas toast covered with meat (beef, chicken, buffalo chicken strips, veggies, and others I can't remember), covered in fries and surrounded with liquid cheese. That might sound like way too much but it only is if you are counting calories because it is delicious! 6 degrees uses white cheddar cheese sauce which is different but still very good and also offers a pony shoe for those wanting a ""lighter"" shoe. The price of the food is good, but the booze is nothing different or special. I wish they would have had some kind of happy hour special, but they did not. The owner was there and working and she was super nice and wanting to talk to all of the customers.  Today, we walked by looking to eat there at lunch, but from across the street it looked closed, so we kept on walking.

2009-07-10,4.0,"Two words: vegetarian horseshoe. Yes, I was told this was a contradiction in terms, an abomination; I was asked why I hated America. But I had always been curious about the fabled horseshoe, heralded by my Springfieldian colleagues and launched into infamy by  thisiswhyyourefat.com But as the resident non-meat-eater, I figured I would never have my chance. Until 6 Degrees. Alongside buffalo, hamburger, turkey burger, chicken, and ham, they offer a slightly less coronary-inducing Horseshoe option filled with grilled zucchini, onion, and tomatoes. Same Texas toast underneath, same cheese sauce (here, put under the fries instead of on top) and same haystack of french fries. Horseshoes are $12, which carries your choice of two meats; the less ambitious can get a half-portion Ponyshoe with one meat for $8.  As a wet bread averter, I was pleased that the Texas toast didn't get soggy. The cheese sauce wasn't the dayglow orange stuff from the nacho machine and was tasty as cheese sauces go. The grilled veggie combination was well chosen. And the carnivores raved about their carnivory as well. And no, I could not finish the whole thing. Their signature 6 Degrees cocktail is a pineapple-grapefruit blend, very smooth and tasty. The pico de gallo that comes with the tortilla chip appetizer isn't too great, but the guacamole is excellent. There was plenty more on their food menu that I remain eager to try, such as a vegetarian avocado burger for $8--if this is bar food, it's my kind of bar food.
