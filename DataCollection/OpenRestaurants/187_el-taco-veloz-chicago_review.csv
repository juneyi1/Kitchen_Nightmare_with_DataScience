2017-08-19,4.0,"A friend lives in the area and suggested this place for some late-night Mexican food. The inside is interesting, its kind of narrow and long, there's quite a few tables, and they even had a karaoke/DJ music going while we were there. Decorated nicely with murals and a taqueria type theme, there were several other people there at about midnight on a Friday. The free chips, bottled salsa as well as pickled vegetables were very good. I really like how they put the whole container of them on the table. Chips were warm, crispy and didn't taste like they were out of a bag. I had 4 tacos, but went out on a whim and ordered 3 meats I've never had before, plus a chili relleno. I had lengua, cecina, and suadero. They were all very good but unfortunately I was unable to confirm which taco was Cecina and suadero. I liked the darker of the two and it reminded me of barbacoa.  All the tacos except the chili relleno were under $2 each, which I would consider cheap. The meat seemed to be of decent quality and each was pretty flavorful.  Great option for cheap, late night, authentic Mexican food.",0.9811,0.816,0.168,0.017,0.5654487179487179
2017-08-05,1.0,"This place used to be My favorite Mexican joint  but  now it sucks. Back in the day they used to hook it up and serve you well, but now they skimp you on tortilla chips and napkins. It sucks. Not trying to bash but it really does. I came in here with my SO for breakfast before lollapalooza but was completely unsatisfied with the service provided (the food was great) For example, we placed our order (as normal) but were told that their square scanner wasnt working after our order was placed in (20 min ago).  THERE IS NO SIGN IN FRONT OF THE RESTAURANT that says there is is no cards accepted and the waiter made me go across the street to the pharmacy store to takeout cash in order to pay my breakfast. That was the last straw. The food was good but the service freaking sucked!!!!! Please take out for your sake.

She had more energy than I did and was fun to watch the singing and dancing while enjoying our food. My favorites were the lengua and tripitas.

2017-04-18,1.0,"I have to start off by saying, as a business owner Im not really a fan of writing bad reviews. This place however is the exception. So, My husband and I were searching for a good taco joint near my studio. We stumbled upon this place and although it was crowded and loud ( we were there on ( kareoke  night) we initially thought we found a decent place. Service was ok. We waited for a while to be given menus and get our order taken. The waitress was juggling about 6 tables full of drunken kareoke goers. I chocked it up to a crazy busy night. We still enjoyed what we had ordered. First visit was good enough that I even referred a few of my clients to the ""restaurant.""  Tonight was a HORRIBLE  experience. My husband decided that we should return with a friend of ours since the food was good the first time. I have NEVER in my 37 years of life have EVER, EVERRRRR been discriminated against by my own race.We waited 30 minutes for the waitress to come take our order. There was a couple who came in right after us. They received their menus with water and chips. They were given a few minutes (like 5 minutes) to place their order. They even got their food BEFORE us. When they got their food, we had to flag down the waitress to place our order. We finally got our food and she never came to check on us to see if we needed anything. My husband had to flag her down to ask for limes. We finished our food. (It was ok) My friend asked for the check and the waitress told him he had to get up and pay at the counter. Immediately after, the white gentleman sitting behind us had also ordered a taco in the time we were waiting for our food, finished it and asked for the check. She graciously went got the check, took his car and charged him for his tab. I initally thought that maybe I was imagining things, but after my friend got up to pay we walked out and I shared with my husband and him what I thought had just happened. I decided to walk back in and ask for the person in charge. The waitress who served us got the other woman who served us the first time. I explained to how we were being serviced and asked if our money was good enough to pay for the food. The waitress who was serving us said that the reason she told my friend to pay for the check up front was because it was busy. There was only 4 tables occupied at the time. It was not busy at all. I also noticed there was a white bucket of green and red salsa that were uncovered sitting at a booth the entire time we were there. I didnt think much at first because I thought that maybe they were filling the jars with salsa. I pointed it out to her and asked her what she thought would happen if the board of health walked in at that very moment. She responded with "" Theyd probably shut us down.""    If you are not hispanic you'll be served quickly and efficiently. If there is anyone who has been seated before you and theyre hispanic they will have theyre order taken after you and get to eat last.. (Im really not trying to be racist. Im just merely explaining my experience.) If you're hispanic, or look hispanic be prepared to have to wait to be attended to. You will not be seated, you will be given chips and salsa with no water or anything to drink. You will be given menus to look at for a minimum of 30 minutes. Then you will have to wait for your food to be served yup you guessed it, AFTER all the nonhispanic customers are taken care of. Oh and if you ask for the check, be prepared to get your butt up to pay at the counter. But if you don't look hispanic, youll be waited on hand and foot. You'll get your food to you in a jiffy. Youll even get checked on and asked if you need anything else.",0.9783,0.899,0.066,0.034,0.4401215805471125

2017-02-20,1.0,"Came in here 2 nights ago for take out & had a pretty terrible experience. As soon as I entered through the front door, one of the cooks slams his spatula on the flat top grill yelling ""no more orders! I'm tired!"". Well, that was pretty odd considering the restaurant wasn't even very busy and it was only around 7:00pm. I then proceeded to put my order in with one of the waitresses, who was very polite. I ordered a flauta dinner, an avocado tostada, and veggie burrito. As soon as the ticket made its way to the kitchen, the same cook yells ""pinchis flautas!"" (which means f***ing flautas) directed towards me as I was sitting on the bench waiting for the order. He then proceeds to slam refrigerator doors, stomping around pissed off that he had to continue working & making the order. I've been to this restaurant a number of times and have never been made to feel bad for ordering their food. It's such a shame that I have to write a negative review because of one cook and the whole restaurant has to suffer. Chances are I won't ever go back to this place because of the incident. I don't think anyone should have to go through such hostility for ordering food at any restaurant. No one working in the restaurant was standing up to him and was just going on with their evening, laughing at whatever he was saying.

It's cheap, for sure, which is definitely a point in its favor, and I really love the pickled vegetables they put out with chips and salsa on your table. I also love their salsa delivery method, via bottle with nozzle. Everything here is fine, even verging on good, but I haven't had anything great.

2014-10-28,5.0,"What other bar in the city has Mexican karaoke, potent-azz El Zombies, and offers the best views of elder gentleman casually wearing all white tuxedos, studded cowboy hats with matching boots, crooning while haggard grandmothers breast-feed infants in a sticky booth at 4am?  I, personally, love this place, but out of pure weirdness alone I'd be compelled to give Taco Veloz 5 stars... despite there being oh-so-many reasons that it could easily be a 2... of which I will outline below even though I threw all those reasons to the wind when deciding on my rating... because again, I love this place. 1. I don't want to play the race card or anything, but I'm definitely pretty white and if you come with a bunch of white people, you will likely be ripped off. That's just how it is. Everyone knows it so just accept it and move on. It's not right, but their prices are already so cheap and chances are that at least one member of your group is embarrassingly drunk and you probably should pay extra to make up for their likely lewd behavior, so just let it slide. And good luck disputing it because it will all be lost in translation and you will be the crazy one, FYI. 2. If you or members of your group are drunk, you will be ripped off exponentially more. And good luck trying to decipher that bill because it would take a miracle of god to get separate checks and most of their drinks have no prices on the menu and the receipts are all made up by hand and list no menu items, just a long list of random prices (that may or may not actually add up) and likely 2-3 extra drinks/tacos added on by the staff per person in your group. Consider it a drunk tax because theres no point in arguing unless everyone in your group kept a personal tally sheet of everything they ordered as they ordered it and someone in your group speaks really convincing Spanish.  3. Sober: The tacos are just ok. Drunk: Still just kind of ok.  Luckily, their chips and salsa are where it's at and that ish is free** 4. You know that pickled stuff in bins on the tables? You probably shouldn't eat it. You will, because it's there and you're hungry and the booze probably doesn't have you thinking clearly, but you will eat it despite my warnings. It's all congealed, people put their freshly licked fingers right into the tub, and I've seen little kids sneeze into it with my own eyes and then have another table sit down and start eating out of the same unchanged tub of pickled ish. Do I still eat it? Hell yes. It's so good.  5. DO NOT TRY TO SING A SELENA SONG IN SPANISH IF YOU DO NOT KNOW THE SONG OR SPANISH. And if you don't believe me, just ask Danny W, whose special lady friend basically got him banned from ever showing his face there ever again.  Even with all that, this place is the tops for a late-late night Friday or Saturday karaoke session. Bring a good group of friends who've got some real stage presence and the crowd will not only accept you, but start requesting songs to sing on your behalf. Definitely come with a good attitude, know that there will probably be numerous service hiccups but that the people who work here put up with A LOT of sh*t and even when they're overcharging you, they still probably qualify for sainthood given some of the sad, drunkeness I've seen act up in here. If you drink 3 or more of the El Zombie drinks, there is an 80% chance that you'll come very close and possibly even succeed in passing out and/or peeing your pants involuntarily that evening.

Should I start with: the fact that there was no service of which to speak. ""Do I bus my own table? Am I supposed to make my own margarita? Oh? What's that? I need to kill my own chickens and make my meal? No? Well, then, what the $&^# is taking so long? There's a table of six people in front of you and there's no one else in this hell hole. Oh? We have to ask four times for salsa? Aha. I see. That must be the magic number. Got it."" Should I talk about: the food. Perhaps I should have been in the kitchen because I know my Iron Cook (Jack Lalanne power juicer winner, hello!) skills would have availed my crew better than whatever was happening in the kitchen. My pastor taco was nauseatingly greasy and my chicken enchilada was dry -- even when coated in red sauce. My strawberry margarita was gritty and poorly mixed. Needing booze to help dull my pain, I ordered a beer. Out. I tried another one. Don't have it. I grit my teeth and ask for one more. ""Let me check."" (turtle shuffle) ""Out."" Should I bring up: how you continued to serve the belligerent drunks who sat behind my table? That's right, they came in stinking (literally) drunk and you continued to serve them. By your familiarity with them, I assume you knew them. You laughed, giggled and flirted. They got louder and more belligerent, yet you kept the beers coming (funny how they were missing for my table). It was only when they got so loud that they started shouting obscenities at each other, throwing food (which hit members of my party) and shoving each other in a prelude to a fight did a glimmer of ""uh oh"" run across your face. They soon left (without paying) into the night to, undoubtedly, prove which one had the smaller male sex organ. Should I recall: how we were overcharged. Somehow, for a meal that added up to $98, pre-tax, we were charged $137. Somehow, we were charged tax on the auto-gratuity that you included. Somehow, when we asked for an itemization of the bill, you were unable to provide it. You could ""only"" give us a final number. Somehow, when we said we wouldn't pay the bill, the bill managed to get redone. Somehow magic is happening at ETV.

They wrapped up some limes and dried hot peppers to garnish. A bit too much ground beef for my meatless-leaning tastes, but it was a very good soup.

Well-aware that you're about to witness a train wreck of bad Mexican soap opera-ish proportions, you shut up and take a seat.

A non-hopped up me would've probably turned up my nose at the slightly overdone pork but the drunk version of me found it to be quite good.

You have to throw it in the garbage can that sits on top of the back of the toilet.  Since I arrived in need of using the restroom, I went there before sitting down. And throwing your toilet paper into an uncovered garbage can with other people's toilet paper is not the way to start a meal.  Ordered the guac to start, which was okay, but I have had and made better. I want to be wowed by guac at a Mexican joint, not meh-ed. I then ordered the steak burrito. I rarely eat meat, but I was craving delicious flank steak or carne asada. As a non-regular meat eater, I didn't realize my mistake as I ordered: the steak burrito didn't specify what kind of steak it was. I thought since there was also a beef burrito that the steak would be different from the ground beef. It was not. The S.O. ordered the beef burrito, I ordered the steak burrito, I tasted both and they were not exactly the same but eerily similar.  Overall, the food was average. If I'm going to have average Mexican, I would like a clean table and the ability to flush my toilet paper. I did not get that here, and will not be back.  I didn't even mention the bizarre karaoke with two young boys leading the singing, but I'll avoid details-- it wasn't for me, but seemed to make the family at the head table happy, so as long as someone dug it....",0.9823,0.829,0.132,0.04,0.3890522875816994

In much of Europe Mexican food amounts to little more than Chile con carne or really expensive ""fancy"" food. No thanks.  Ok, well, I had never been here myself, and I am half-Mexican American! Well, we ordered the ""Carne in su Jugo"" as well as the carne cesina (dried beef). The soup was amazing. It was a beef stew with diced onion, beans, bacon, and avocado. It felt like a bottomless stew bowl. The cilantro and onions on top only made this fine stew better. It came with corn tortillas and we spooned out little soupy tacos on the tortillas. My grandmother made menudo, and other soups, but never this! It really is worth visiting.  The dried beef (not dry when you get it) was also amazing. I also thought the guacamole that came with this dish was stellar. The rest of the menu was typical Mexican food. I saw a Goat Stew that I want to try now, and the tacos were super cheap at less than $2 a pop.  We came in about 9 pm and I suggest that if you want to avoid the funny and loud Karaoke guy come about 7 for dinner.

Tried to get a guacamole torta instead - told no can do by waitress. Burrito? Nope. Taco? No way. Tortillas instead of chips? No, senorita. The ONLY way they'll serve their delicious guac is accompanied by those dreadful chips, and that's NOT acceptable.

Okay, insert your jab here about how a burrito is not Mexican, but rather a Tex-Mex concoction.  Fair enough.  Don't get me wrong; I love real Mexican cuisine, but the balance of everything in the beef burrito here is amazing.  And at ~$4, it's a great deal. Nothing I've had is bad here.  And if you get food to go, it's ready in about two minutes.  Sometimes they charge you $.50 carry-out charge, sometimes not.  I don't really get that since, if you eat in, you get free chips & salsa.  So, they should have an ""eat-in"" charge to cover that, right?

Ten minutes went by, and we finally got someone to come to our table because of our flying arms trying to attract attention.  We ordered, then waited. Our mouths were on fire because of the yummy salsa, but no water to drown down the fire pits on our tongue. After ten more minutes we finally got our water, and our food.  Don't get me wrong El Taco Veloz, you are fresh, flavorful, and super delicious...your service just sucks, apparently.  We went to pay, and then were told that the credit card machine was down. WTF? No sign? Just a smile and a nod. Were told to go to an ATM that charged $2.00 fee, come back, and then pay. I paid first, my friend paid second...and then we thought we were done right? Right? Wrong. It was then her turn to wave her hands around to get attention. Apparently she forgot I paid. WTF x2. I told her I already paid, and we just left.  I am super sad about this.

You can always count on El Taco Veloz to be open late; and it's even better when you are drunk. 3) You never know what to expect. I'd say for awhile I was coming here about 3-4 days a week for a few months. I honestly never really knew what to expect in there.
