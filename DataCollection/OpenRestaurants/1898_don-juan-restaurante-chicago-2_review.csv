The bartender who is probably co-owner or something was not very friendly, everything he said felt forced. He only made eye contact with me, never looked at my boyfriend and only spoke to me. It was offensive and rude. The food and drinks are overpriced and the margarita was weak considering the place was dead on a popular day for the restaurant. I can see why it was dead.

2017-07-20,2.0,"On the night that my fiance and I wandered into Don Juan Restaurant there was a sign hanging above the entry way saying, ""In a taco emergency, Dial 9-Juan-Juan"".  I have to give them mad props for that clever little sign of theirs, but if I were in a taco emergency, I would definitely be going down the street to Hay Caramba or a different Mexican Restaurant.  I didn't have tacos here, but if they're anything like the food I did have, then I have no intent or desire to ever eat them.   Whilst here, we ordered the chorizo quesadillas as well as the macaroni and cheese with chorizo...it was a light dinner for us that night.  Though, I'm sure glad that we didn't waste our money on anything else as it would have been a complete rip-off.  We ordered apprehensively, seeing that the prices of the items seemed to be a little high - and for the portions and quality, the prices were absolutely too high.  You must be mad at your money if you waste it here. As the quesadillas were coming to the table, I could see right through them...that wasn't a good indicator. Quesadillas should be filled with cheese, right?  These weren't...there was hardly any cheese and I think the chorizo must have been a figment of my imagination - I maybe found 2 tiny pieces of chorizo in there.  The quesadillas looked like they'd been store-bought from the freezer section...not good, my friends.  And the macaroni and cheese?  Well it was a little better, but it was nothing memorable.  It had some more chorizo in it, and it was a cheesier mac n' cheese...but still. Perhaps the drinks are better than the food, you might be asking.  Ehhh, that's a longshot.  The margarita was okay, but I've had way better ones at rinky dink dive bars.  My fiance ordered the sangria and though he drank it all, he didn't necessarily like it.  I surely didn't - it didn't taste like any sangria I'd ever had.  The best part of the meal was the flan, but it was so tiny that I barely got to enjoy it.  If only it had been a little bit bigger... Now, the service wasn't that great either - our waiter looked like he was just floating through the restaurant without any sense of direction, leaving me to wonder if he was going to get our order correct.  He did get our order correct, thankfully...he just moved at such a slow pace, though - it made me want to scream.  At the end of the day, Don Juan is a no-go for me - I would rather get greasy Mexican food down the street...at least I know  it'll be stuffed with caloric goodness.",0.9941,0.781,0.159,0.06,0.5435098801425332

When we ordered the guacamole for the table and needed additional chips, about 10 minutes they came with the main meal.  Mexican restaurants are a dime a dozen.  They proportioned very little meat and most of the taco was lettuce.  Spoke with the manager and told him of my disappointment and told him I would never be back again.  Very Overpriced for the small portions received.

The actual main entrance is on Oshkosh avenue. They also have a valet service, but there was definitely plenty of street parking around. The dining area was rather spacious. There's the bar area, which is near the main entrance, and then the main dining area in the back with regular tables and chairs and booths as well. Apparently they have live music on certain days of the week. Service was fast. Upon dining in, you get some salsa (not too spicy) and warm chips. I ordered the guacamole. Guacamole -- it was bland. Although the guac was nice and chunky, the way I like it, the seasoning was just lacking.  For the entree, I ordered 3 tacos -- two chicken tacos and a ground beef taco. The chicken taco was pretty good, but the ground beef taco was bland as well. It just didn't have much seasoning on it. The tacos came with rice and refried beans, but alas, the rice was rather bland. Just a disclaimer, I generally don't need a lot of salt added to my food... I would get slapped by my mom for adding any salt to my food. Apparently salt was the devil, according to her, so needless to say, I got use to not really needing any salt with my food. I found I had to add salt to the chips, guac, and salsa on my tacos for flavor. All food came out super quick and again, the service was good as well.

When we arrived the young man came up too us 2 minutes later and asked if we were ready to order, we said we needed a few minutes..... but not 30! My boyfriend had to go find him to tell him we were ready to order when he found him sitting there watching the game. The waiter was completely rude to us the rest of our time there. He went up to the 2 other tables there asking if everything was okay while we got completely ignored the whole time after we got our food. Now when the food came to our table the food looked pretty good but don't let that fool you. My Pina colada was pretty good but half of it was still ice I didn't know it was that hard to press the blend button for 30 more seconds and the glass was very small definitely not worth 8.50. My burrito suizo tasted like it had pasta sauce on top of it and I got about 1 spoon full of beans and it was cold. My boyfriend got the Carne Asada with enchilada and the enchilada was cold and our food was flavorless but it's funny because our plates were really hot which makes me believe our food was microwaved.

Appetizer:  the ceviche is really good, and so are the oysters of the half shell a la mexican.  I typically get the chicken enchilala suiza, and end up eating about half because of the drink, chips and appetizer... and the other half I eat for lunch the next day and I swear it tastes even better as a left over nuked in the microwave( but that could be the mild hangover talking).   My wife typically gets the chicken fajitas and likes to only eat about half and eat the other half for lunch at work the next day.  Lately I've been ordering off the weekly seasonal menu and they just came out with a Filet Mignon which is a quality 8oz Filet and for $35 includes the potato and asparagus (which in Chicago is a pretty decent deal for a real Filet ....believe it or not)...

Our main courses were the Flautas de Camaron and Beef Brisket (not sure what it is called on the menu). Both were nicely prepared, and very well presented. The Flautas were very good, and the chile habanero salsa was nice, but maybe only medium heat. The brisket was very tender, but lacking much flavor. The habanero BBQ sauce was fair, and also only medium heat. Corn was nice, but only a sauce drizzled over it, and the potatoes were decently prepared 'au gratin', but nothing special.

My order was screwed up. In the meantime, our Server was ""MIA"" and it was about 15 minutes before she stopped by to ask ""how is everything."" I informed her that my order was incorrect. I ordered the enchiladas roja con pollo. The Server was very confrontational and argumentative, and insisted that I had ordered the ""cheese"" not the chicken."" My friend stuck up for me saying ""I heard her say chicken, not once, but twice."" My friend was very firm with the Server, because the Server had a nasty attitude. At that point ,our Server walked away in a huff (and I was thinking ""take the stick out of your ass, lady""). Her attitude was really unacceptable. By the time my order finally arrived at the table my friend was almost done with her dinner. I didn't eat the food. I asked the Server for a ""to go"" container. I am a generous person when it comes to tipping. Of course, it helps to receive great service which really does determine how much of a tip I will leave. Not in this case. I ended up leaving a one-cent tip on the table. I didn't feel horrible either. I have never done that before -- ever. In fact, my friend said she wasn't going to leave a tip because of the way I was treated. She didn't. Also, I didn't even eat my food when I got home -- I scraped off the cheese; I scraped off the red salsa; I opened it up and took all the chicken out. I gave it to my dog Annie. This place has gone down the shit-hole since the last time I was here. I am not sure if it is under new management or new ownership. The bottom line is: We will not be returning.

Juan's has fixed the issues but it just keeps getting worse.  The empty tables all around us on a Saturday night in a place that use to have a 45 minute wait is a good indication that I'm not the only one that feels this way.  To top it all off, it feels like Maria and her son just don't care anymore.  I have been eating at don Juan's for over 25 years and I'm really sad to have to write this review.  I'm hoping Maria will read this and make the changes needed to bring the restaurant back to the wonderful food experience it use to be.",0.8902,0.815,0.116,0.07,0.503864734299517

The salsa was runny and almost flavorless. 3. The chille relleno arrived only lukewarm.  Because the breading was soft and very spongy, I think it may have been microwaved.  The chicken in the BF's fajitas looked like a boneless chicken breast that had been wrestled from a hungry dog's mouth. 4. Did I mention it doesn't smell very good in there? 5. The menu says they offer Coke products, but the waiter confirmed that they serve RC.  $2.95 for a glass of flat RC? Okay, whatever.

2013-03-22,1.0,"First time checking out this restaurant and, subsequently, the last time too. Don Juan's gets 1 star from me, only because Yelp will not allow me to give it zero. After my girlfriend's brother graduated from police academy, the family was hoping to find a restaurant that could accommodate a large group for dinner. We had found a few that could, but Don Juan's was recommended by a family member who works for the Skokie PD and said that this location always accommodated her and her colleagues when they came for a bite to eat.  So, taking the recommendation, a reservation was booked for almost 30 people, which the staff at Don Juan's said would not be a problem at all. The day before the dinner, the reservation was confirmed. Come the Friday of the dinner, family members were making their way to the restaurant only to be told that the reservation was cancelled and we no longer had a table or area booked. The staff gave us no information of who cancelled it, or a reason why.  Realising that finding another location at 7pm on a Friday would be near impossible for a group of 30, we decided to tough it out and wait for them to make an area in the already fairly empty restaurant ready. By the time 8 o'clock rolled around, and we were not seated, things were appearing to be going from bad to worse. They had us huddled off to the side by the already small bar, where locals and regulars took up all the seating. When we tried to bring chairs for the children and my girlfriend's 85 year old grandmother to sit on, the staff told us we could not. They said we would be seated soon enough, and that they only had to put the childrens' highchairs at our table. Its really surprising to me that Don Juan's also employs artisan craftsmen as well, since I can only assume that the hour we waited for them to ""put the highchairs at the tables"" meant that they were in fact being built in a workshop attached to the kitchen. By this time, some family members who had small children and babies, and had driven a rather long time to come to dinner, had to say their goodbyes without a bite to eat due to the horrendous wait and it being their kids' bed-time. When we finally were led to our tables at 9pm, two hours after our reservation was for, and 3 hours after some of the group had arrived, we were brought awkwardly through the kitchen as if we were in some Hollywood chase scene -- the kitchen staff looking at us with dumbfounded stares. The room we were transplanted in was a cold, cramped closet of a room with a drafty door bolted shut. We had 3 tables spaced out across this room, so that the group was split up. There was a young couple also in the room eating, but they were whisked out rather quickly, transplanted into the main dining room. The aloof manager apologized for the long wait, the canceled reservation and said that he would absolutely make it up to us -- by giving us six free beers and six scoops of guacamole... SIX BEERS?! SIX SCOOPS OF GUACAMOLE?! Really?! That is how you take care of a group of people who were bound to spend at least $500 in your restaurant AND were willing to wait 3 hours to be seated AFTER you screwed up their reservation? As pissed as everyone was, the hunger was overtaking us, so we perused the menu and ordered, much to our chagrin. I had the Picadillo, a personal favourite dish of mine whenever I am eating Cuban, so I was very excited to see how a Mexican twist on this dish would be. Picadillo, a rather exclusively Cuban dish, mind you, entails potatoes cut into rice with beef and raisins, olives and black beans. Don Juan's was a rather small helping of litterally ground hamburger beef and some beans. I could not be more disappointed with my meal! The flavours were forgettable, and the portions were a joke. Others ordered the burritos, of which the restaurant had may choices of fillings, but the general consensus was the same as mine for my meal. One likened their burrito to be sub-par in comparison to Taco Bell's, only quadruple the price! When we left this hell-hole, an exit that could not have come sooner, the manager was seated at the bar, drink in hand. He saw us leaving, and didn't even have the decency to stand up and say goodbye to us. A wave and a rather flat ""Thanks guys"" was all we received. I cannot express my disappointment at this establishment. Its galls me that places like this get constant business while mistreating those that come to patronize it. Will I ever again set foot in this lackluster establishment? Absolutely not. Would I feel bad if tomorrow it went out of business? Absolutely not.  Step up your game, Don Juan Restaurante.

Located in Edison Park so lots of venues to choose from. Meter parking or train.  First walking in, the place has a funky smell that does not go away so that may be enough to turn some folks away. I suspect that it has to do with the bathrooms being located up front across from the bar but who can be sure.  The menu has standard mex fare on it to choose from, but also some surprising twists that I was not able to indulge in this time around because I was splitting a meal of her choice with my date. We split the dinner portion of the steak burrito, it was tasty and I would say better than your average steak burrito. Chips, salsa and guac were adequate. The more exotic choices were intriguing enough to bring me back to check them out. In my opinion just from the menu read through, these same exotic choices looked like they had the potential to distinguish this place from the usual expected mex fare. Hopefully next visit will tell.  Like most places, they have happy hour and daily drink specials. Margarita Monday $4, not a bad margarita but a little on the small side.

Absolutely scrumptious! Wasn't spicy at all, but extremely messy. We also had steak tacos for dinner.  The steak tacos came with a small dish of beans and rice for $11.  All in all with 2 soft drinks, 1 pitcher of margaritas, 1 corona, 5 elote's, 4 steak taco dinners, and 1 chicken taco dinner our total was $99.  Which is a very great deal in my opinion.   Service was excellent.

We were taken to our table through the front area, then through the kitchen (wtf?), past an office area, and then into a small room that had a a few tables in it with another very large party. There were about 20 of us so we decided to start with some guacamole, chips and salsa.  We were brought 2 small plates of guacamole which were placed at both ends of the long table arrangement.  The middle folks got nada.  We decided to order to speed up the feeding frenzy...we were starving.  We sat there for an hour after we ordered with nothing in front of us except for stale chips.  Drinks were few and far between and the table completely ran out of water.  We flagged someone down for water.  The guy who came over walked over, glanced through our glasses, shrugged his shoulders (I sh*t you not), and then proceeded to walk away.  Oh NO!  ""Excuse me, sir.  We ALL need refills of water!""  After all of our waters were filled we asked for him to check on our drink order with the waiter.  Our drinks eventually arrived.   Many of us ordered fajitas.  These  were served to us in a bowl (chicken, a couple of peppers, tomatoes, and onions) and a plate containing 3 shells was placed between 4 fajita orderers to share.  ""Nope, not gonna work, sir.  May we please have a plate of shells per person?"".  Oh...and we were then notified that the restaurant had ran out of rice and beans.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Our waiter was extremely nice, though and could tell we were irritated throughout the evening (I think his name was Gustavo).  He bought us all a round of drinks and a desert for the table.  However, the dessert arrived while I was in line for the bathroom and when I got back it was devoured.  I was told it was only 2 plates of some dessert...again, placed at both ends of the long seating arrangement with the middle folks getting nada. The best part, I guess, was the bill...just over $400 for 20 people.  Not bad at all.   I do believe it is safe to say that I will NEVER be returning to this restaurant. ****Almost forgot...the bathroom was insanely disgusting.  We were told to use the bathroom near the back office by our ""room"".  This bathroom was being used by our table, the other large table in our room and the parties at the smaller tables in our room.  There was one stall, a latch that didn't quite work, no toilet paper, trash all over the floor and urine all over the seat and floor.  I know it wasn't the restaurant who created this mess...it was the clientele, however, it is the responsibility of the restaurant to make an effort to keep the bathroom clean for its clientele throughout the evening!!!",0.8935,0.897,0.064,0.039,0.4748710317460317

2011-08-07,3.0,"A friend wanted to go for her birthday to Don Juan last night for a 'just girls' night. I'm down for Mexican anytime, so I really didn't need a reason.  Parking was pretty easy, there is street and a few lots around the area. With lots of bars and restaurants, Edison Park is a decent area to hang on a Saturday night.  Now, back to Don Juan. I had rock star parking right outside. Problem was finding the entrance to this restaurant. It was a little confusing. I walked practically around the block looking for the entrance. With a messed up knee, it was a little frustrating. The entrance was in between the outside dinning area. It may have been the drugs, making me not see the entrance. Who knows.  The ladies had already ordered a pitcher of strawberry margaritas. I did not have any being that I'm on meds for my knee but the comments from my dinner companions was that it was sweet and tasty and you couldn't taste the alcohol. Not sure if that's good or bad. I like the taste of alcohol so I'm glad I didn't try the drink.  The menu wasn't extremely extensive and not many vegetarian choices. Being on a vegetarian kick, I can't really judge Mexican food when I am avoiding MEAT! What I did order though was fine. It was a cheese and veggie modified combo plate of taco, tostada and something wrapped in paper/foil which I thought was suppose to be a burrito but it may also have been a taco just smaller. I was satisfied with the meal although it was pretty greasy. The side of rice and beans was tiny but I now why, it tasted awful! I don't know how rice and refried beans can taste so horrible but it did. Glad the chips filled me up.  Service, strange. The food was served all at once which was fine, the weird part was that I felt that they were stalking my plate. I eat slowly, I mean, it's not a competition, but I had about one more bite left of my taco and the guy was standing to my right waiting! I could see him from my peripheral! So as I inserted that last bite into my mouth, he reached out and says, ""you done?"" Mouthful of food I nodded my head and he took the plate. Not so cool. My water glass is sitting there empty, no refill yet you'll take the plate while I'm still chewing. OK.  Desserts were ordered and everyone seemed happy with their choices. I passed since the only authentic Mexican choice was flan, everything else was just not calling my name.  Finally, the bill came out, and we had a couple of credit cards and the rest was in cash. They charged the cards but never came back to get the cash. I mean we were chatting up a storm so we didn't mind but then we noticed that they were closed and we still needed to give them the cash and get some back. Eventually we called to them and one of the guys came by.  Would I come back here, probably not unless my friends drag me and then I would go kicking and screaming. Hopefully I'll be eating meat again and then I can really review the food.

2011-05-20,1.0,"I have lived in Edison Park for 10 years and used to eat at Don Juan very frequently.  I always enjoyed it and thought it was a decent value. For whatever reason, I stopped going about 4 years ago and just went back for the first time last week.  This place has CHANGED in a HORRIBLE way.   We had a party of 5 on a Saturday night and had about an an hour and a half before we had to be at another function.  1.5 hours is surely enough time to comfortably order, eat and talk for a bit....or so we thought. The front of the restaurant was only about 60% full, however the grumpy old lady who owns the place insisted that we had to take a table in the ""back room"".  I never knew such room existed and quickly found out why.  We had to walk THROUGH the kitchen.  Not a walkway like you would find at Buca, but literally around the chefs and cooks and food to get to the back room.  Surely this establishment is paying off the health inspector because there is NO way that it is acceptable for patrons to walk through a kitchen and literally be able to touch the food they are preparing for other customers. So we were sat in the crappy back room which presumably used to be an Italian Restaurant.  No Mexican theme like the front of the restaurant, but there were about 6 other tables of patrons sitting around us.  Knowing we we only had 1.5 hours to get our food and get out, we all ordered our food when the server came to take our drink order.  15 minutes later our drinks arrive.  30 minutes after the drinks arrive (45 minutes since ordering) I ask the server why it's taking so long.  He says ""the kitchen is busy but you should have your food soon"".  30 minutes later, the food arrives.  At this time we were supposed to be leaving, instead we had to scarf down our food.  I asked to speak to the owner, and she came over and told me ""Its a busy night and we prepare everything from scratch, this is normal"",  I told her that I dine at various restaurants 5 nights a week and NEVER wait more than 30 minutes for food.  She tries to tell me that her quality is better than anywhere I have ever eaten and starts yelling at me at the top of her lungs that she owns the business and makes the rules, and it is not a problem the food took 1:30 to get...rather it is ""a sign of how great my quality is"". I know it's a long review but here's the cliffs:  The back room is a dump, you have to violate health code to get to it, there is no hot water in the back room, the food took FOREVER, the owner is a completely disrespectful woman who believes she has the best product of any restaurant ever. My advice: travel about a mile away in Park Ridge to Hay Caramba! The food is as good, if not better than Don Juan and they are always extremely courteous and happy to have their customer's business.",0.9873,0.849,0.105,0.046,0.4328356481481483
2011-04-05,3.0,"Have I had a million times better Mexican food, yes!! Is it eatable, yes. Was it strange being in Edison Park, double yes. Edison Park has come a long way and I believe in a year or two it might actually become a happening spot. With it's two Irish pubs, a french inspired cafe,  and fancy restaurants opening left and right, it's easy to see. Also, parking is fairly easy and there is the Metra station for you suburb folks.    From my understanding Don Juan has had a couple identity crises, struggling to get it just right. They were an amazing authentic Mexican restaurant back in the day, then decided to become an upscale Mexican fusion with small plates and large prices, and finally they went back to their standard Mexican style food. Although, they aren't quite up to par with flavor, there is potential. They also need a little help with service. Just a tip servers, don't hand your customers hot plates, you set it in front of them. In my opinion the food was lacking flavor, missing that lovely Mexican spice. Just a little heat would have gone a long way. Then there were the little things like they skimped on the cheese or you had to pay extra for sour cream. How about some hot sauce for the table?!

2011-03-28,1.0,About 4 years I lived in Edison Park and would frequent Don Juan's Restaurant as I could walk there and we had several family gatherings.  At the time the food was good and large portions.  I have been there 4 times in the  last month and found every visit unsatisfactory.  The service is poor...even at off hours (I can only imagine how it would be at a busy time); the food portions are smaller and the overall taste of the food is not that great.  My friend ordered a plate of shrimp and steak at a price of $23 and asked if they could put a small portion of guacamole on the side of the plate.  The portion was very small and they made a charge of $1.75 for it.  I will not return.

We were greeted upon arrival by the owners mother.  If you are looking for a good Mexican meal and happen to be on the northwest side of Chicago, give Don Juan's a try.  You won't be disappointed.",0.9863,0.838,0.145,0.016,0.4724666666666667

In fact, one of us grew up in a small town in Michigan and one in the Chicago suburbs. The thing about Don Juan's is that it is a family run restaurant.  They don't take their patrons for granted. The mother of the chef grants each patron at the door. The food is consistently good, although we aren't that interesting in our choices, which are the same time after time. We stick with the traditional menu and typically get fish tacos, guacamole and a chicken taco with the salad that goes with the fish taco (for some reason, it's just better). In the fall, I get the pumpkin enchiladas, but I think they serve them all year. (If you are a fan of the succulent pumpkin ravioli you will love these!)  Also worth noting that Don Juan's is actually two restaurants in one. The chef is extremely adventuresome without the yahoo of Rick Bayless. He has a traditional mexican menu and a more upscale nuevo latin menu that is a bit more money and a bit more precious. We have had a number of the fish dishes off that menu and they have all been wonderful. But, as I mentioned about the ""going home"" thing, when you go back home, you want your mom to cook your very favorites and for us it's the tacos and guac. The drinks are generous. We have been to more than one Margarita Monday where those little yummies are 1/2 price. The decor is roomy and unpretentious. The wait staff are very attentive without being overly obnoxious.

Unless during prime hours on the weekends, the wait is never very long. They have a separate bar area to wait or to eat in as well while you wait.  The food has been consistently good since I was in kindergarten. I rememeber going here once with my Dad after an injury to cheer me up, so I can back up that statement. The chicken tacos are still what they were back then- great. The prices can be somewhat high for some of the entrees, but I'm not sure many people go to Don Juan's for their killer Chilean Sea Bass (or is it snapper?). Not only is that a bad choice for environmental and health reasons, I wouldn't go with that upon your next visit. Besides the other reasons I listed, they just have great Mexican food.

They do have your tacos and burritos but they also have a more complex flavor of Mexico with moles and such. I was in the mood for your typical burrito which is what I ordered. I also had the tortilla soup, which had a nice broth, lots of tortilla strips, queso fresco and some avocado and that is it, it was good, but I figured for $6 there would be more to it. The salsa was more of a sauce with a smokey flavor to it, not what I typically prefer. The burrito came out and looked like it was fried... hmm disappointing since I've never had a fried burrito and I didn't want it fried.... oh well glad they didn't list that on the menu, but I didn't ask either. It was good, not great. Everyone seemed to love their food. I was okay with mine.

While I was overly thrilled with what I ordered, I was pleased with the amount of flavor that was in the food.  My daughter and I had enchiladas, which for my daughter (5) were wonderful but lacked the little kick I was hoping there would be in the red sauce.  My husband had a burrito which he said was good, and my son (3) had quesadillas which he always loves.  We also had an appetizer of cheese and tortillas (I cannot remember what it's called) it normally has mushrooms, peppers and chorizo in it, we got it without the shrooms and loved every bite!  The peppers were so sweet and the chorizo was very mild, I'd love to know what brand they use. All in all, we'll be back again and we'll be sampling other food on the menu. I completely recommend for families.",0.9966,0.737,0.256,0.006,0.5738636363636365

2007-10-19,3.0,"I was slightly surprised at how quiet the place was at lunch or else people just don't eat lunch a little after 1pm on a weekday.  The salsa was very unique.  It has a nice tangy flavor to it.  I had the combination plate that included a fish taco, chicken enchilada, and beef burrito.  It also came with rice and beans, and I also got a side of guacamole.  The guac was pretty different.  I was disappointed that the taco and burrito basically just had the meat or the fish.  I never had such a bland burrito that just had beef and beans.  There weren't even any onions or cilantro.  My favorite thing was the chicken enchilada.  It was delicious!  I would not mind coming back for more of those!",0.8955,0.862,0.115,0.024,0.7385416666666667
2007-10-15,4.0,"Great Mexican food! I had the steak fajitas-loved them! Filled with all kinds of veggies-zucchini, mushrooms, onions, peppers. The guacamole is really good just a bit much cilantro for me. Their margaritas do the job as well. Fresh chips immediately.

2007-10-12,4.0,"Met some suburban contingent of Yelpers here for dinner last night. I had been here before, but not for a good many years. I remembered the sangria as very good and was surprised that it was still very good! I had a few of the chips, but tried to stay away from them, so I did not try the smoky salsa, that would have only encouraged me to eat more. I ordered the Baja Tacos. They were very good. The fish was Tilapia, breaded and lightly fried,served with some nice shredded cabbage slaw and a slightly spicy sauce,in a fresh soft flour taco. The tacos came wrapped in a sheet of foil, giving the impression of fast food, but do not let that fool you, this was good stuff! The tacos came with a small side of rice and was plenty for me. I too was full enough without dessert, maybe next time! Worth the trip!! Judging by the silence and clean plates during our meal, the others enjoyed theirs as well! The crab cake looked very tasty, so that may be something I try at next visit, along with some guac! It was very good to see the owner making the rounds. She was pleasant and welcoming, something that always makes me want to return!!",0.9831,0.731,0.195,0.075,0.5173333333333333
2007-10-12,4.0,"I've passed by Don Juan's daily for a few years and admired their cleverly worded signs like Have a Juanderful Day Cubs are Number Juan You Don Juan to pass it by Have a Juanderful New Year... among others.  I finally got to dine there with the NW Burbs Yelp group. We even had the privilege of meeting the owner responsible for the creative play on words, as she made her rounds from table to table and checked on the guests on what seemed like a quiet Thursday night here. Since they offer complimentary valet parking, I pulled up in the valet spot and he was confused whether I was coming in to eat or just pick up food. Minutes later, I saw him walking around the place asking for the owner of a Ford Crown Victoria. It got me nervous knowing I left my car with the guy, but he turned out to be OK. That aside, let's get to the food part that really matters. We got 2 bowls of tortilla chips - fair amount considering there's 6 of us at the table. The chips were rather plain and unsalted, but a dip in the dark red salsa made them come to life with flavor. The salsa itself had a rich flavor, not spicy or hot, just good-tasting. As my drink, I chose the sangria, recommended by everyone who got there before me. Now I drink alcohol about as often as a morally loose Puritan, usually on holidays only. I won't even go for a margarita most of the time. However, this drink was flavorful and not too boozy, though you could taste the alcohol overcoming some of the drink's inherent sweetness, but not excessive. Their menu offered lots of seafood items, but I chose to stick with my benchmark steak burrito test. Don Juan's Carne Asada burrito comes with a dollop of sour cream and guacamole on top. Inside, it's packed full and the meat is well-salted and tasty. The tortilla wrapping is lightly fried for additional flavor. A side of rice and beans accompanied the dish. Just on the burrito, I was pretty full that I didn't venture to try their desserts.  Though it doesn't seem so big on the outside, the place has a spacious home-like interior with a curved wood ceiling. Clay masks of devils and odd creatures adorn the walls, along with some Mexican art. The dining area is separate from the bar, which also has a large waiting area. We came on a light evening where it was pretty empty which gave it an even more spacious feel. Overall, I'm pleased with the place, the speed of the service and the convenience of the valet parking in an otherwise crowded Edison Park food & commuter train district. While I saw people with kids here, I'd best come back here on a date without the kids for a nice Mexican dinner... and maybe try the fried tilapia next time.",0.9933,0.837,0.131,0.032,0.47241994116994124
2007-08-03,4.0,"Tucked away on the northwest side in Edison Park, this is a great place for an authentic Mexican meal. They offer standard fare (tacos, burritos, enchiladas) as well as more contemporary dishes (venison fajitas, chili & chipotle barbequed lamb shank, pan-fried oysters as a starter). Even the traditional stuff has something of a twist to it, it seems. Like the chips & salsa - here, the salsa is a smoked chipotle.  It was strangely addictive, as my friend & I polished off two baskets of chips. My steak tacos were fresh & tasty.   My friend loved her Baja fish tacos.  Neither came with sour cream, so we requested some.  Delicious.   And the portions are hearty; I couldn't finish my 3 generously filled tacos. Magaritas-on-the-rocks were the perfect accompaniment - they have a variety of 'ritas to choose from.  We were too full for dessert (I did eye another diner's chocolate cake-y concoction carefully), we opted for coffee.  It had a cinnamon taste to it, which I loved.  The wood-paneled dining room is homey; almost sparse in its simplicity.  You have to pass through a smoke-filled bar, but the dining room was thankfully smoke-free.  Prices are reasonable (around $15/avg. for most dinner entrees). If you're in the neighborhood, it's a must-try.",0.9567,0.864,0.121,0.016,0.6087719298245615
2007-04-09,5.0,"When does a Chicago restaurante' get written up in the New York Times? When it has a chef / owner who knows what they are doing. Such the case with Don Juans. Patrick, or 'Patricio' as he his affectionaly known, is of Irish / Mexican descent and trained globally before settling in Chicagos'  NW side and opening the Edison Park mainstay known as Don Juans. The food here is superb and the atmoshphere is just the right mix of nuevo Mexico meets local establishment. There is the traditional Mexican food menu which includes enchilladas, tacos, etc. The molle sauce is great. Included in the menu is a section with dishes of Mexican-French-Continental fusion(Actually, it is billed as two places in one. Don Juans off the standard menu, Patricios off the 'special' menu). We ordered from both. Scallops were awesome. Believe it or not, I also recommend the Ceaser salad with Chicken. I know, sounds like standard fare, but damn it was good. Everyone at our table raved about the food. The drinks are great. Staff is freindly and courteous. Free valet parking rules. If you train it, catch the Metra at Jefferson Park, get off at the Edison Park station, walk one block (around the corner from Morettis) and there you are.  Lucky for us it is right down the street from our quaint little bunglaow.  Worth the trip if you are not local.

2006-10-24,5.0,"This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants.  It's a cute neighborhood place, the servers are so friendly, and the food is good.  One of my favorite things about this place is they basically offer two menus: a traditional Mexican food menu featuring the basic burritos, tacos, etc. and a finer dining menu featuring the owner's son's more experimental cooking.  He will feature specials such as venison tacos, raw oysters with a spicy garnish, always a great fish special, etc.  I like that we can come here and satisfy two different types of taste, since my husband will eat burritos all the time and I prefer something a little fancier!  One tidbit of information about this place:  I grew up in Park Ridge, which is right next door to the area, and I remember when the owner first opened this place as a stand, where you would just go to get takeout tacos and burritos.  She has come a long way since then, and I love success stories like that!",0.9901,0.787,0.213,0.0,0.4837832457397675
2006-10-01,4.0,"There are places I go to for burritos and places I go to for tacos, but for some reason I haven't found a place that has good burritos AND good tacos. Don Juan may have good burritos but I wouldn't know since I haven't tried them. I HAVE tried their tacos and they are fantastic! The great selection includes poblano chile, shrimp, and fish of the day. Generally, the food is very good, but if you're looking for traditional Mexican food (and prices) this isn't it. It's not ""Tex-Mex"" either, but more a reflection of the chef's international training. Great service, although it can be a little slow.",0.9881,0.743,0.257,0.0,0.545
2006-04-22,3.0,"First of all this isn't real Mexican food. It is Tex-Mex. And since I'm from Texas and have eaten at a ton of real Tex-Mex places, I know Tex-Mex.  This place is very medicore. The chips they serve seem to taste as if they are from a bag. The salsa they serve with the chips is some kind of dark chipotle pasty like substance instead of a true salsa. (I believe it is from a salsa can I've tried before.)  I had the chicken enchilada suizas (corn tortillas with chicken inside topped with green salsa verde topped with sour cream) -- my favorite dish in Tex-Mex restaurants. The chicken was pretty good; however, the tortilla tasted just ok and the green salsa verde was extremely weak and watery. My only guess is that is designed for Midwesterner palates.  Hey, they did give me a free desert for my birthday so I will give them props for that. Even though I'm giving them 3 stars, I'm guessing this is one of the better places to get  ""Mexican"" food up here. I will probably continue to visit so I can get my fix.",0.9638,0.857,0.127,0.016,0.5662878787878788
