2017-08-29,5.0,"An excellent bar and eatery all around. Listen if you are a whiskey enthusiast this is the spot for you hands down. More whisky than I can count and not to mention extensive beer selection: drafts, cans and bottles. Loved it from the moment i walked in. Punk rock in the background, cartoons on the TV and wonderful service. Our bartender was very courteous and answered all my questions. Went with the fried egg sandwich and Stonerkillas- which is basically Fritos, chili, cheese, chorizo and veggies made like a nachos dish. Amazing, definitely hangover cure or guilty pleasure. Will attach pictures. If I didn't live so far away this would be a regular spot for me. Prices are quite reasonable for what's offered, FYI all whiskeys are half off on Wednesdays. Whatever you want to consider this place, biker bar, hipster joint or just awesome bar it is 100% worth checking out.

The bar tenders are super nice and will give you great suggestions or make you an off the menu cocktail.  If you are in the area, try this biker bar.

I only heard good things about Twisted Spoke and was eagerly looking forward to eventually trying the Food!  This past weekend, after basically walking around the whole city, my fiancée and I decided it was a great time to go to Twisted Spoke as the sun was shining and we could sit on the rooftop. Brilliant idea as we got to enjoy some sunshine paired with a delicious meal. I will admit it, that I am a chicken wing connoisseur! If the wings look decent on Yelp, I am likely ordering them. Given I knew I was going with the Shrimp Po Boy, I was questioning if the 12-piece wing would be too much Food. Concurring food expectations is no problem for me and I said bring it on! Thus, I ordered the buffalo wings with the Shrimp Po Boy which also comes with fries. Get the ventilator ready as my meal was fully fried and I nearly took down both plates of food. This meal definitely left me happy and in a food coma. I definitely gave myself a pat on my back and was saying way to go Blake.. paired with my meal I ordered a cold draft beer that hit the spot on this warm and humid summer day.

They were so nice and on the spot to help keep us hydrated.  One of our groups wanted a Margarita and they actually asked if they could serve them last so that they could make a fresh batch of sour mix.  They not only mixed some nice drinks, the presentation of the margarita and mules were very nice.  I judge a bar based on their vodka and wine selection.  I can't say they have a great wine selection but they impressed me that they had Deep Eddy Vodka.

I perked up so much once I sunk my teeth into those cheese curds, and I continued to perk up as I ate more and more of their food.  Everything that my fiancé and I ate while draping our tired selves over the bar was amazing!  We shared the cheese curds, followed then by banana fritters and the breakfast burrito, but my eyes were being drawn to so many other items too!  I could barely decide.  Anyways, the cheese curds were perfect - the batter wasn't too thick and the cheese melted as it should.  The fritters were out-of-this-world!    They were like pancakes, but with the density of flan...weird, but awesome!  And the burrito, as simple as it may sound, was great and it came with fresh fruit!   Now I'm not the biggest fan of bloody mary's, but I had heard from my fiancé that these were some pretty rockin' ones.  I took a leap of faith and ordered the Great Lakes Tattooed Mary (???) Aka the one with pineapple and pork butt garnishing it (completed by a sidekick of lite beer); I actually did like this bloody mary, but I'd probably stick with my beer next time...real biker chicks drink beer anyway...I may has fit the part if I want to be one someday.   My fiancé got the envied Zombie Dust which he enjoyed as always.  They don't only have the precious Three Floyds on tap, but there's a huge selection of other draft beers on tap...and good draft beers at that.  While we're on the topic of alcohol, you gotta go here if you're any type of whiskey or scotch lover.  I mean, c'mon, they have got the hook up.  It's one of the of the biggest whiskey bars in Chicago and accordingly, it will make your eyes dazzle in complete envy.  It's kind of expensive for one glass of scotch, and perhaps a little more affordable to get the bourbon.  Still, you can come here and get your pick of liquors...aka, it's paradise. My fiancé had arrived soon after they'd opened on a Saturday morning and it was perfectly quiet, though it became more crowded as our time there progressed.  It's an easy place to relax, especially after midnight ON Saturdays as I hear they play porn on tv's at that time.  Some people may say ""gross"" but I say ""why not?  Bring on the boobs!"".  I will have to make it here on a Saturday night..like I said, bikers, boobs, booze and bloody good food all the way.",0.9988,0.726,0.219,0.056,0.671619769119769

Wifey ordered three eggs, sausage and potatoes.  Once again the sausages were charred beyond recognition and luke warm at best.   Judging by the amount of food the table next to us left and their facial expressions, they shared our disappointment with the food.  Service was normal but never did they ask if we liked our meal.  I suspect they knew the answer.

However, the food was a total let down for me, and the Bloody Mary was completely un-drinkable despite the cool garnish. Scotch should never ever be in a Bloody Mary. I should have known, but I learned that for good this past Sunday. Also, the massive fatty burger was so charred on the outside that despite being a perfect medium rare on the inside, I got a bits-of-glass crunch in my mouth while eating it. The seasoning was also uneven since one bite of my patty was all green parsley, and the next a barren, grey/pink wasteland. There are much better places in the city for a good, giant burger. Oh, and whatever you do, don't get the side salad instead of fries. It's just a bunch of leftover burger ingredients (iceberg lettuce, wilted tomatoes, weeds from the alley for foodie flare, and horribly sad, shriveled mushrooms).  My party of 7 waited about 45 mins to eat at around 1pm on a Sunday, just to give you a wait time idea, so I wouldn't peg it as a good place for hungover and hungry groups.

2016-04-18,1.0,"I've lived down the street from this place for about a year, and since the weather was nice last night decided to go check it out. The Good: BBQ Nachos - I mean...yeah, really, really good.  Super happy we order these. The Bad: Service - grabbed our own table, then waited a good 15 minutes before anyone came to give us menus.  This was a theme throughout the meal: long stretches of no one coming by to check on us, with random rapid-fire check ins while we were still eating.  Its not like it was super busy either, so that was strange/disappointing.  Of course, when we were done eating it took forever to get the check.  We were sitting in a corner and it really felt like the server kept forgetting we were there. Drinks - my girlfriend got the magic root beer, which she says taste ok, but was pretty watered down, and definitely not worth $10.  I got a draft Brooklyn Lager, which was flat.  I've been told by neighbors that the bloodys here are pretty great, so if you're into that this might be a solid place to check out for brunch - except that... Food - ...the food was really bad.  Girlfriend got a salad, lettuce was wilted, veggies didn't seem fresh, kitchen forgot dressing (normally not a big deal, but after requesting a side order during a rapid-fire check-in with our waitress, she didn't come back with it until we were really done eating what we ordered).  I got the shrimp Po-Boy, more or less the same deal: shrimp didn't taste right (you can read this as fresh/cooked correctly/good) and I just picked at my fries instead of finishing my sandwich, because I'm not messing with weird seafood.  What made this soooo much worse is that the nachos were so good, we had real high hopes for the rest of the food.  Bummer. Setting - Also terrible; they have this real nice patio with a cool view down Grand, and they are blasting this screamo heavy metal bullshit music while you're eating up there.  Just....why?  It was so annoying, and killed the vibe being on this real nice rooftop - ruined the whole point of being up there on a nice day.  Now, I know what yuo're thinking - biker bar theme, that should be expected, right?  Not quite, because as we're finally leaving, walking through the inside bar, they were playing some decidedly non heavy metal at a reasonable volume.  It was legitametly nice inside with multiple servers and bartenders keeping everybody happy - I honestly feel like if we had eaten downstairs I would have given this review 2 extra stars - whats the point of having a rooftop if you're going to make it miserable to sit up there? So, now I can say I've been here, but I'll probably never go back - a TON of better bars and food in the neighborhood, can't see a reason to go back here if I'm just going to sit inside anyway. TL;DR: Food bad and kind of overpriced (except Nachos), drinks bad and definitely overpriced, loud heavy metal makes rooftop unusable (unless you're in to that, I guess), service not great, way better options well within walking distance.",0.9848,0.734,0.16,0.106,0.5668775510204079

In this instance, judging a book by its cover is the last thing you would want to do with the Twisted Spoke. I had heard great reviews about the food at the Twisted Spoke and wanted to see what they were all about! The Twisted Spoke happened to be a short walk from my friend's apartment and one afternoon we decided to take the quick trek. When we approached the corner where the Spoke is located, it appeared to be a very dark and dreary place that would be associated with bikers. There is a rotating motorcycle topped off with a skeleton rider. Upon walking in, the inside was much warmer than the outside portrayed.  During my stay in Chicago I was able to make it to the Spoke twice. Each time I enjoyed a different spirit and food item. On my first visit I chose to have one of their many craft brews selections and the grilled cheese. I am a sucker for gourmet grilled cheeses and the different varieties out there. I was intrigued by the combinations of flavors and cheeses that were used in the making of the sandwich. I was very happy with my selection while at the Spoke. While waiting for my drink to be made, the bartender poured my friends and myself a small cup of Genny cream ale. For those of you who have not ever heard of Gennesee, it is a good sized brewery in upstate New York, located outside of Syracuse. I loved the little pick me up that the bartender gave all of us.  The food was very good, the drinks were awesome, and the beer list is impressive. A really cool neighborhood spot to grab a bite or a drink. I heard that in the summer time the Spoke is a lot more fun with their rooftop and outdoor patio seating.

The place is pretty cool everything else just kindof fell a little short. I came in for dinner by recommendation with my BF and two of his buddies. One of the guys and my BF have eaten here on numerous occasions and vouched for the place. Needless to say I was expecting to be blown away. The moment we were handed our menus I thought to myself ""wow there is a ton to choose from"". I was a little ahead of myself, it was only the drink menu. Great for the guys but I'm more interested in the food and specifically what I was going to order! I should mention that I do have certain food restrictions being a strict vegetarian. That said, the menu is pretty limited. I honestly thought my menu was missing a page or two. Not much to choose from, everything looked great but there wasn't much for me to eat...  The guys decided on a Burger, Chicken sandwich, and the Buffalo Chicken tenders. They loved their dishes and overall they were pretty satisfied! I on the other hand got shafted and ordered an Egg Sandwich (it was all I could actually eat) -- not exactly something I would order myself for dinner but when in Rome, right? The sandwich was ok, I'll give them that, but I was hoping for something more than just a Grilled Cheese (so boring!). It was good but I was not impressed, I wanted the experience the guys were having with their meals. oh well.  One thing I have to commend the Twisted Spoke for is how fast our food came out. I'm not entirely sure if it was do to the fact that it wasn't as busy or these cooks really know what they're doing! As far as the service is concerned I found it to be somewhat awkward and a little cold. Our waiter was very quiet, I honestly did not understand or hear a single word he said the entire time. I can't really say that he was attentive to our table or any other within our vicinity.  Overall I'd come back only if my boyfriend wanted to go, I personally wouldn't come back on my own unless they expanded their menu... The website was down at the time and is still down today.

We headed to Twisted Spoke after Pitchfork to grab a drinks and bite to eat with some friends we met up with after the show. It was around 11pm, and there was an insane wait. We were attempting to order drinks at the bar while waiting, but the bartender ignoring us and cleaning glasses that she didn't need at the moment instead. They somehow were able to seat us right away, which we were relieved about. The server warned us that the bar was a bit backed up when we sat down. We had just come from the bar and didn't think it should be that bad. We ended up waiting about forty-five minutes for four beers and one neat pour of whiskey. We placed an order for cheese curds, guacamole and BBQ nachos, which took just as long as the drinks. I don't know if they were slammed from Pitchfork or what, but the amount of time it took to get drinks was ridiculous.

The BBQ Nachos were killer. Definitely a must have.  Now, let's talk about the bad: 1. The burger was greasy. I mean really greasy. As in greasy enough to turn a toasted bun into something soggy.  2. The po boy was not fresh. A basic rule of ""fish"" is, it shouldn't smell fishy. My po boy did. Not good. Also, similar to the burger, a toasted roll was rendered soggy. In this case, it wasn't because of grease, but because the slaw was so plentiful. 3. The bathroom was disgusting. It's a health hazard waiting to happen. I get that it's a ""biker bar"", but cmon, the bathroom can't be a toxic war zone.  4. Service was meh. I'd put it on the slow side, not the worst, but worth mentioning.

2015-07-14,2.0,"My husband and I have lived in this neighborhood for 5 years and have frequented the Twisted Spoke fairly often.  As another customer posted it is the Broken Spoke now.  We haven't been for a few months, but this was our experience Friday evening, 10 July. We had a group of 7 and were seated fairly quickly. We received water a few minutes after being seated, but never received refills for the rest of our meal and there were several empty water glasses waiting for refills throughout our evening which were never refilled. When we received our menus we were confused.  My husband grabbed my clipboard saying that his was short a few pages (which happened often in the past) and he wanted the full menu.  Much to his dismay and mine, as well as the rest in our group, the menu was a single page.  No more fish tacos, no more grilled cheese.... NO GRILLED CHEESE? Everyone in our group has been a customer of the Twisted Spoke in the past and I can easily say that we were each VERY disappointed in this shortened menu. We had a discussion with our waiter who said that the menu had been shortened and the wait staff were hearing that many customers were disappointed.  I would say this was an understatement. We placed our orders after we studied the very shortened menu and had to find alternatives to what we would have normally ordered.  For me this was really sad as the fish tacos and grilled cheese were always my go to choices?  NO GRILLED CHEESE! The food was OK.  I had the perch sandwich, which would have been GREAT in a taco with jalepeno slaw.  My husband had a Fatboy, which he said was OK.  The rest of the group were satisfied with what they were able to order from the shortened menu. I don't know the reason for the shortened menu, but since the items I always choose are no longer offered, I see no reason to return.",-0.9654,0.797,0.075,0.128,0.530568356374808

We called 30 minutes before arrival, and the person on the phone confirmed that we'd have a table for ten on the roof. When we arrived, the roof was full, but we didn't think that was a big deal. They placed us in the back. No one came for ten minutes, and when Sarah, our waitress, arrived, she left immediately to get us waters (which she would not be back with for another ten minutes). We finally ordered, and they brought out everyone's food but ONE person in our party. The waitress asked if she took his order. He said yes. She then said, ""Well, then I swear I put it in. I put it in!"" Okay, Sarah. We don't care if you put it in or not...just go get the burger. Five minutes later, they arrived with the wrong burger. The man in our group politely let the server know it was incorrect. He took it back. He returned, ten minutes later, with another burger with the wrong toppings. The man didn't want to cause a fuss, so he took the burger and started removing the onions with his hands. The waiter (in a red ball cap) then came up and said he needed to take the burger back because it was meant for someone else. The man in our group said, ""But I just took the onions off WITH MY FINGERS."" And the waiter goes, ""That's okay."" He turns around and takes the plate to another table. We were so in shock that, unfortunately, we didn't say anything in the moment.  Sarah then returned to say that they DID bring his burger out, and that someone else in our party ate it. We were confused. The man then simply asked to have his burger made to go, because by now an hour had passed and everyone was finished eating. We set up our cards - writing our names on the receipt and putting them in order - to give them to Sarah to charge. NOTHING was offered for all of the horribly service. I personally do not think the man who never got his food should have had to pay. We did not even get an apology.  Lastly, it took Sarah THIRTY MINUTES to charge our cards. I will never be returning to this restaurant and I am sure no one else in my group will as well. Their standards and service are horrific, and Sarah was beyond incompetent.

2015-05-21,1.0,"""Broken Spoke"" After coming here almost weekly for years, I was surprised on a recent visit to find a drastically cut down menu.  The staff explained that the kitchen was abruptly closed for three days last month and upon reopening that this is what they are now serving.  Gone are most of the signature Mexican dishes that held up one side of the old menu - no more tacos or burritos - sadly, even the remaining standards have been thoroughly mangled. My typical order used to be chicken tacos or a burrito, but left to the limited options, I went back to an old favorite - the BBQ chicken sandwich.  The breast itself was dry and about a half the size of the prior offering and inexplicably they have abandoned their delicious brioche bun for an oversized dry, almost stale style of bread - maybe to compensate for the smaller chicken breast.  Either way, it was terrible. This was all heartbreaking and I left wondering if this was just a bad day, a change in owner, manager, chef or all of the above.  With a sunny spring day at hand, my wife wanted to go for lunch outside the following week and suggested the Spoke for some fish tacos.  I explained that they were no longer on the menu and tried to describe my experience from earlier this week and she scoffed at the possibility it could really be that bad.  So we gave it another try... Shockingly, the second experience was even worse. We tried a burger and against hope it showed up on that same inedible bun the chicken sandwich arrived on during my prior visit.  Instead of a regular sliced tomato it came with a pile of grape tomatoes that spilled off the patty like a fistful of marbles. The salad which used to be a generous portion of crisp greens was an undersized and wilted mess.  At $8 it is the certainly the worst value in salads in the city. I took notice at the tables around us and the amount of uneaten food on peoples plates is notable, typically sandwiches and burgers picked apart, to eat around the dry, oversized buns.   Read other recent reviews - post May 1 - and they are all on this same theme.  The staff are polite and apologetic about the changes and customer disappointment.  I know most of them from my literally hundreds of visits to the Spoke.  They reported that there has been no change of ownership or chef, just a willful act of abuse on a very loyal customer base.   As we were leaving, there was a table full of police officers eating lunch and it was all I could do to not stop and report a crime. I caught myself, because at heart I am a capitalist and respect a business owner's right to change the product as they see fit - whether to cut quality, reduce portions or raise prices.  I do however also believe in freedom of choice, and like many other regulars will be choosing to not return to this shell of a once great establishment.",-0.0717,0.77,0.112,0.118,0.4644397702991453

Food is so so. Average. Nothing to write home about. But what I do believe is worth writing about, is the consistently awful service. The servers and bartenders both, just out and out rude. The first few times I came in I thought it was like some sort of ""Ed Debevics"" thing like the staff is supposed to be rude on purpose. After asking, and finding out that the rude attitudes are not a ""staged"" thing, it just made me think, why is EVERY staff member so miserable. The only explanation I can come up with is the ownership and management.  Usually when there's a consistent problem, it starts from the top and trickles down. It's just a shame that our amazing neighborhood of West Town can't be home to a welcoming and friendly eatery.

We went on a Sunday afternoon and were seated right away. This place just has the right feel of divey that me and my wife like in a bar/restaurant feel. But other than that feeling the food and beer/drink selection is top notch. We started out with the cheese curds. Some of the best that I've ever had, done extremely well just the right amount of breading plus they give you a cheese dipping sauce lol some cheese for your cheese why not!!! We both went with sandwiches one of us having the pulled pork and the other having the shrimp po'boy. The pork arrives with a tremendous amount of pork that my wife was able to scrape off some from her sandwich and pour it over her fries(hand cut fries btw) with the left over cheese sauce and make a version of pork poutine fries(Twisted Spoke if you would like to put that on the menu as a app just put her name on it that's all :) ) the pork was very good my wife liked the fact that the bun did not get soggy at all, Seriously there is enough pork on there to make 2 sandwiches very good sauce and pork would definitely get again. I had the shrimp po' boy and it was very good also. The shrimp tasted so fresh, all the ingredients blended seamlessly together to make a great tasting sandwich. The bread was slightly toasted and crispy which again held up throughout the sandwich. We also got the boneless wings to go and the word on those were that they were some of the best tasting wings.

In my defense, I haven't been to any restaurants with a skeleton riding a motorcycle spinning on top of the roof (not your typical weather vane). Either way, I regret letting my prejudice keep me from one of the best brunches I've experienced in the city. Twisted Spoke is comfy in its own, very rock and roll skin. They put their own spin on traditional brunch items, which really sets them apart in my opinion. I ordered the Chila-Killas. One of the best chilaquiles I've had outside of Mexico. The tortillas weren't soggy and overpowered by the ingredients on top. There was the perfect amount of heat so the additional hot sauces that came out with the dish weren't even necessary.  My friends and I shared the fried cheese curds...D-LICIOUS! We also shared the banana fritters, which were thin banana pancakes as is the traditional Jamaican way.

2015-01-26,4.0,"Went to the Twisted Spoke with my wife and father-in-law for Sunday morning brunch. This place has a pretty cool biker bar vibe and their menu has a ""cure your hangover"" theme that is pretty funny, with a variety of Bloody Mary selections to back it up. I went with the classic, extra spicy, which was a fine drink, although I was too full to sample the meaty & pickle-bristled garnish that accompanied it.  We arrived around noon and found that the restaurant was busy, but not to the point where we had to wait long for a table. It's not a huge venue in winter. In the summer months they have a roof-top patio, so I'm sure there will be a lot more elbow room when the weather warms up. It does get fairly crowded, though, so I would recommend against bringing large groups without reservations, small kids, claustrophobes, or chainsaws.  The food is good. It won't take you on a mystical journey or anything, but the items we ordered were solid, tasty, and hit the spot. I went for the much-lauded fried egg sandwich, and I wasn't disappointed. It's messy, so I wouldn't recommend ordering it if you're on a first date, wearing a tuxedo, or both. My wife did the same, but on a pretzel bun. I have to admit that she won brunch that day, and I will probably do the pretzel bun thing the next time I'm there. My father-in-law had the steak and eggs and loved them. The steak was flavorful and well cooked...which is to say they did a good job cooking it (he ordered it medium). We also had the banana fritters, which are more pancakey than frittery, but still very tasty. Our server was professional and attentive. As I said, it was busy, but we were frequently visited for coffee & water re-fills. My one complaint is that whoever was in charge of the music that day didn't seem to get the theme. Whenever something like Hendrix, Zeppelin, or Sabbath made an appearance, the channel was quickly changed to something decidedly more wimpy. At one point they played R. Kelly. R KELLY?!? This is supposed to be a BIKER JOINT! Take that ""I Believe I Can Fly"" crap somewhere else! Whatever...I still had a terrific meal.

If I could eat this every day all day without getting fat I really would. I've also tried the buffalo chicken sandwich. The chicken had the perfect amount of batter and was extra crisp after being deep-fried. I prefer a little more kick than others-- there was the perfect amount in this sandwich. The fries were just okay, a little soggy for my taste.  Check out the amazing rooftop!",0.9828,0.778,0.183,0.039,0.6288793103448275

More than likely because it was on the way to the Pitchfork festival that I attended, but mostly because it's an awesome bar and restaurant with a pretty dope rooftop. The roof is prime for a sunny brunch. With killer chilequiles and a really good bloody mary complete with a beer back, it's the perfect way to start off any weekend day in the city. Downstairs, the decor is littered with motorcycle paraphernalia (hence the name) and the bartenders were all quick and talented. Oh, and they definitely carry Malört.

We had our orders ready b/c we'd been sitting there so long. However, it turns out that for brunch, only one page of the menu is actually available. Would have been nice if someone had explained that to us when we sat down. The food took forever to come out and was mediocre.

The waiter literally came to our table a total of three times both occasions. I want to like this place because they have a great beer menu but that doesn't matter when your server only comes enough to be able to order one. Both times my gf and I got seated in the back just behind the hostess stand and got the same server. He acted like he didn't give two shits either time. On our second visit, our potatoes came out cold and the egg sandwich was barely warm. Not sure if it was the kitchen fault or our server let our plates sit there forever. I could tell the food would have been good if it was warm. Also on our second visit we sat right across from the waitress area from the bar. Each bloody mary is made by the bartenders but the waiters use their hands to place the meat, cheese and etc on top of the bloody. I'm not a germaphobe, but you can't help to think where their hands have been while serving. Use some utensils!!

2014-07-29,1.0,"If you love bad service, mediocre food, has a funky whiz/beer odor, and won't sell a plain grilled cheese to a Mom, then this is the place for you. If any a place is in need of an appearance on Bar Rescue, the Twisted Spoke is it. I have been there a ton of times over the years and have always had a great experience until last Sunday. Stopped in w/my wife and teenage son. Typical dive bar which I love,  but that funky dive bar smell of beer and whiz permeated throughout was the first time I'd experienced this at the Spoke. It was slow and there were plenty of staff just stading around talking to each other. It took a while for our server to get to us.  My son and I ordered the burgers and my wife wanted a simple grilled cheese and that was on the menu but under the 'KIDDIES' section. The waiter explained that he would have to charge her $5 more for the grilled cheese because she's an adult. She said she didn't want anything then and I mentioned that charging $5 more for a menu item because someone is not a kid is a bit strange. He agreed and went to get the manager.  It was evident that the Manager has really never had any experience in customer service experience. He said that my wife could order the adult grilled cheese on the menu which had thicker bread, 3 types of cheese and a lot more fries. She said she just wanted an old fashioned grilled cheese with just American cheese. He said he couldn't do that for her. Huh? We even offered to throw in a few more bucks (not $5, though) and he said he still couldn't do it because if he did all of Chicago would be in the place ordering grilled cheese cuz it's such a great deal.  Even the table across from us were in disbelief. Our burger and fries were good. They could definitely have used a bit of seasoning. Overall, it was really weird and I have been telling everyone about this experience.  Needless to say we won't be returning and from the recent reviews I've read, this place won't be around long unless they make some major changes that get them back to the great place they used to be. One place to start is to take advice from legendary Chicagoan Marshall Field. He coined the phrase ""Give the lady what she wants."" And in this case, the lady was asking for a grilled cheese and that simply couldn't be done.

2014-07-23,3.0,"So I have to start this review by saying that I love this place. I got there a lot, and its casual, laid back, the liquor selection can not be beat anywhere in the city, and they have amazing food and bloody marys that make me come here about 3-4 times a month.  Usually the service is fine, if a bit slow, but I have never cared since its not fine dining, its a bar... and so I've never had a bad experience, at least until this past Saturday at brunch.  Ok, I used to wait tables and I know what an absolute horror brunch can be for servers... but on this occasion I really felt like our waiter couldn't wait until we left. We sat on the patio (which I love) and we received menus, and water right away. Great. We sat there for at least 25 minutes (was watching my watch because I had an appointment later) and the waitress who was also working out there went and took two other tables orders before anyone had even approached us. I didn't realize there was another server out there since I hadn't seen anyone else so I asked her and she said she'd send out server over. It appeared to me that he was new at serving since he didn't greet us at all, apologize for the wait, but rather launched into what do you want.... not good. I ordered coffee and a bloody mary and every time he put a drink on the table, he put it on the very edge of the table closest to him rather than putting it in front of me. I waited tables for years and this was so irritating I couldn't stand it. I asked for more coffee and he picked up the cup from in front of me, filled it, and then set it again on the very edge of the table closest to where he was standing so I had to then reach over to pick it up. Its a small thing but it is just bad service.  Food was great as always, but I noticed that he was much nicer to other tables that us. My girlfriend and I were just out for brunch, we weren't begin bitchy or rude thought I was a bit annoyed at having to wait so long to be acknowledged, but I guess since we were bothered he stayed away from us as much as possible instead of apologizing which goes a long way with me.  I'll definitely come back... like I said I love this place, but I feel like this service was too bad to not mention. :/",0.9853,0.781,0.144,0.075,0.5245983645983648

2014-07-15,1.0,"Super disappointing. I came in to look at the menu one day and got super excited to try this place out. When I came here, it was unorganized, which ended up messing up our whole meal. We were told there was a 15 minute wait for the patio upstairs, so we decided to wait. We were told we could wait in another dining section and order drinks and whatnot. We decided to order some appetizers, but this turned out to be a horrible mistake. We told our server that we were still waiting to move upstairs and we wanted to make sure that if we moved before we got our appetizers that they would go to the same place. Our waiter told us that it'd be fine, so we went ahead and ordered. We ended up moving a few minutes after that, and once again told multiple people (the host who was reseating us and our waiter) that we had ordered appetizers and we wanted to make sure they would be sent to the right place. I'm not sure what ended up happening, but after the host re-sat us, we never got a new waitress or any silverware. The only reason we had water was because we brought it from downstairs. After waiting a good 10-15 minutes of no one coming over, we called over a random server and told her that we were ready to order and we wanted to know where our appetizers were. She took our order and said she'd check on our appetizers. Our food ended up coming before our appetizers did, but we still didn't have any silverware. The food was mediocre at best and I ended up sending mine back, because it was really overcooked (I ordered the seared tuna sandwich -- it even says on the menu that it's supposed to be very rare). Our appetizers tasted like microwaved crappy college junk food. When I was initially trying to send back my food, I had to flag down a different waitress, because I had no idea where our waitress went and WOW, she was a mean b***h!! She was super rude and obviously annoyed that I had tried to ask her about my food. I tried to see her name tag, but I didn't catch it. She had dark hair, tan skin and looked maybe Filipino or maybe hispanic. This waitress alone is the reason I've dropped this review from 2 stars to 1. There's no need to be so utterly mean! Anyway, she sent over our waitress and I showed her that my food was overcooked and I asked to not have them make a new one. I ended up splitting my boyfriend's burger with him and that was one of the few redeeming qualities of this restaurant. Our waitress seemed busy, but she tried to be attentive and friendly and she took off my sandwich off of our bill, which was nice. She was blonde, but I don't remember her name either. I think overall a lot of what happened was a misunderstanding and miscommunication, which sucks, but nothing could change my mind about this place after that one rude waitress. Oh also, the seating outside upstairs is strange. The tables are very small and I guess you're supposed to sit with a bar in between your legs? TL;DR: Rude waitress and bleh food. I won't be coming back. If you're forced to come, get a burger and try to get the blonde waitress.",0.256,0.828,0.085,0.087,0.48245963679925946

It was fairly nice out and I suggested we do the rooftop every chicago mag raves about.  Our server was cool and the biker vibe was strong. We ordered drinks, the jalapeño poppers, cheese curds, seared tuna sandwich, couple fat boy burgers with egg and bacon, wings, and a shrimp po boy.  My friend asked if her po boy could be on another type of bread and the server was hesitant, saying she wouldn't get the full experience with less shrimp. Umm, how does a diff bread = less portion of food? Just put the rest on the side or something.  When our food came, poppers tasted just like the frozen ones you get at target, cheese curds were barely cheesy and had the grossest salad dressing as a dipping sauce. My tuna 'wich tasted exactly like the tuna steaks I buy @ Trader Joes (2 for $7) that I make with with way more seasonings. Her po boy was blah. I had a bite and felt like the shrimp was 99% breading with dried out lettuce. My hubby and his friend loved their burgers, so I guess this is a strictly burger and beer place. That's cool.  Over the course of our meal, we asked for extra utensils, glasses and finally the bill. Each time we needed something, our server was missing and another server with a pretty stank attitude assisted us but took an eternity.  I get it. Bikers are badasses and the vibe is supposed to cater to beer, burgers, machoness, etc. But if you're gonna have 20 other menu items, make them a little better, ok?

2014-06-24,5.0,"So, after years of fruitless searching I've finally discovered a legitimate reason for the continued existence of brunch: to subsidize things such as half-off whiskey Wednesdays, which is basically what it sounds like (it sounds like angels).   They don't fuck around either: the selection covers bourbon to scotch to Japanese to more obscure types, and includes bottles at every price point, from Ten High to both flavors of Gentleman (Kentucky and Virginia) to Black Maple Hill to the legendary and rarely-spotted Pappy Van Winkle (4 different vintages, even).  There's another thing called ""the Butch"" where you can pay $2 and receive a randomly selected shitty beer from their cooler; think somewhere between off-brand Schlitz and Steel Reserve.  At some point, these two ""shot girls"" from Jim Beam made the rounds to offer samples of their new honey whiskey mixed with pink lemonade.  It was uncomfortably sweet, but I also got a free beehive-shaped shot glass and an eyeful of cleavage, so it wasn't a total loss.       My friend ordered nachos with what appeared to be pulled pork piled on top.  It didn't look great.  There's apparently other food here during non-brunch, after-work hours, but those details fade quickly into irrelevancy.  There is a $4 glass of Weller Special Reserve with your name on it, and you have a job to do.       Recommend if: you feel compelled to sample the entire family of whiskeys that start with ""Old...""

Since my friend and I knew we were gonna be there for a bit, it was time to order up some rye. My eyes darted around at what was up there, so naturally I went for the more rare ryes. The best part was that the prices were extremely reasonable considering I wasn't messing around with what I got. When the rooftop table was ready, it was beer time. I loved the range of beers on their list. They still had some hard to find stouts on tap along with having a good range of styles.  Twisted Spoke is a massive win in my books.

The burger like others said is very greasy. You may want to ask for extra napkins. I liked the cheese curds but wish they came with marinara sauce.

2014-03-21,3.0,"This place is for sure a winner for drinks more than the food - specially brunch where their Bloody Mary's and drink specials every night shine. Went here for late brunch, more like late lunch than brunch. You can tell it was busy earlier but the crowd has died. Ordered up my usual bacon and eggs to recover from a late night of fun. Must be a hidden Denny's in the area since I didn't know the West Loop had one. Eggs done right as I ordered them but with the grease from Denny's. The bacon wasn't crispy at all ether as if they did go to Denny's to get my order. Bloody Mary done right though and you can tell this is what they are good at. If there was alcoholic drink, they can pour it. Their Blood Mary comes with a nice beer chaser as well as a nicely dressed Blood Mary should. You can order your standard Bloody Mary or several other variations. Service was okay. Not sure if it was because it was after a morning rush but there were not many people in the place. Like all places, I'll give the food a shot again. Next time maybe ordering something off their secret menu like their McGangBang which is a massive sandwich with a fried chicken breast, two hamburger patties, three slices of cheese, tomato, lettuce, pickles and a few secret sauces for good measure to add a ""Mc(name your sandwich)"" to the name. The place has a biker bar feel and the looks plays the part. If drinks are your goal, come here but I would consider Haymarket Brewery which is close by. For brunch, I'd suggest Little Goat Dinner as a consideration which is also close by. Bloody Mary on your mind then come here for sure.

2014-01-25,4.0,"I recently visited Twisted Spoke for a friend's birthday dinner. The first thing that struck me was the decor. They've really run with the biker theme and it kinda felt like I was stepping onto the set of Mad Max...in a good way. The staff was a wonderfully pleasant group of black-haired hipsters who gracefully accommodated our large group of hungry revellers.  First, I must say I enjoyed my food and especially my drinks, but I want to return for brunch as it seemed like more of a brunch place. Then again, isn't everything in Chicago? So, I'll withhold a fifth star until I'm able to sample their fare in the light of day. However, the food was really good. I split an order of the spoked mussels and a shrimp po' boy with my friend. I usually wouldn't order a po' boy this far north but was encouraged to do so by a native New Orleanian. The mussels were excellent. They're steamed in bloody mary and it was so good. I wanted more bread to soak up all the sweet juices. The sandwich was pretty good. Not the best po' boy I've eaten. The batter on the shrimp was a little off. Too crispy. Also, I didn't really like the fries.  The best thing I had was the Naked Bloody Mary. It's a deconstructed bloody mary made with heirloom tomato juice. It was so good. I can't describe how good it was. It was like biting into a fresh tomato at a farmer's market. I also had a Bloody Franco and it was good although I'm still on the fence about cold chorizo as a garnish. I tried sips of the Road Rash and Delivrance. Both were very good, too. You get a beer chaser with each bloody which I absolutely love.  In short: I'd love to go back again. I'd order different food...or maybe just a double order of the mussels and probably as many bloodies as I could drink.",0.9954,0.655,0.242,0.102,0.5993925577968132

2014-01-11,3.0,"I was so ready to be madly, head-over-heels in love with Twisted Spoke. Id heard for ages that it is the best brunch EVER with amazing bloody marys and a fun, weird vibe. I had been trying to get there for ages, but schedules never worked out. Finally today, after all the anticipation, waiting, and downright jonesin for a Bloody Mary, we went. WE WENT. ...and I didn't love it. I HATE WHEN THAT HAPPENS.  We got there around 11:00am on a Saturday and didn't have to wait - in fact, the place was kinda emptyish. Which was fine by me, because we were starved. A server swung by right away, and my friend ordered a plain old Bloody Mary, but I wanted to peruse the options prior to ordering. When he returned, I ended up just getting coffee, because all of their zany Bloody Marys are made with liquor other than vodka, which makes me want to throw up (tequila + tomato juice?! Get out of my FACE). So we went on to order our food, and because I had heard such AMAZING things, we tried a bunch of stuff. Pre-meal, we got the deep fried bacon. Oh yeah, you read that right. And it is EXACTLY what you're thinking. Tempura battered, deep fried slices of delicious bacon, served with a sort of Asian dipping sauce, and a tangy radish-based slaw. This is a 5-star plate of heaven. Being tempura battered, it doesn't feel greasy or disgusting, which is bizarre, because you're eating DEEP FRIED BACON. The sauce was delightful, and the slaw was the perfect, palette cleansing accompaniment. It was perfect.  Then I ordered chilaquiles, and my friend got the biscuits with heart attack gravy. The dishes looked lovely, but the flavor was just so/so. My chilaquiles had a red sauce without a ton of spice in it, and I felt myself reaching for the salt more than once. The biscuits and gravy were pretty standard, but my friend added Sriracha sauce to make it worthwhile. Then we split the banana fritters, which were PARADISE - deep fried pancakes PACKED with banana goodness and a sweet, fluffy texture, accompanied by butter and syrup. I coulda eaten a mountain of those. In fact, maybe that's the way to go - order lots of their small plate items and share - since that's what we loved the most. From the drinks to the service to the food to the decor, most everything was just fine here. Maybe my anticipation had set the bar too high. Maybe my brunch palette has officially moved into snob territory. Maybe the Twisted Spoke is just ok. I probably won't be back to find out, but if you're in the area and jonesin for brunch, you wouldn't be doing yourself a disservice to check it out. Oh also, if you write an honest, 3-star review about the service and experience here, you get a nasty message from presumably the owner, not sure who, insulting you and your review.

This place is right down the street from my friend's apartment, so we decided to eat here before I headed back to Indianapolis. The place is really interesting--it has a dive bar feel, but also a restaurant-like atmosphere. There were people drinking downstairs at the bar, and we opted to sit outside on the upstairs patio. It was a little chilly/windy, but nice when the sun came out. The easiest way to warm up is with alcohol. I ordered a fine craft beer, an IPA if memory recalls, though I can't think of the name, and enjoyed the overlook of the westside while we looked through the menu. I ordered the meatloaf sandwich, which consisted of tangy meatloaf on garlic buttered Texas toast covered in spicy mustard. The sandwich was out of this world. I enjoyed every single bite of it. The meatloaf sandwich was accompanied by coleslaw, a load of fries, and a pickle. Arguably, and technically, it was a perfect meal. I loved everything about it.

2014-01-08,5.0,"I've been here numerous times, and it's amazing every time! It's typically a Sunday for a Bloody Mary and brunch, so my review is based on Brunch alone. FOOD: I love that they have a specific brunch menu; they have some very inventive items with a mixture of flavors, but there's not really anything here that's not good. I've had the shrimp po-boy (great shrimp, fixings and bread), but ever since trying the burger, can't stray from from that. If I so much as mention this restaurant to my husband, he drools thinking of the burger - lots of toppings, and he highly recommends an egg on top! They do it best here. The fries are delish, and the ranch dressing (request it on the side) is homemade and awesome.  DRINK: Bloody mary's are incredible here. They use sriracha, so it has a good, bold spice to it. Lots of salami, cheese and veggies! PRICE: Totally reasonable, and you'll have leftovers. Or at least you should...portions are huge. If you're hungover like many of my trips, you may not have much to bring home! LOCATION: Kind of a goofy spot, but there's definitely nothing competing near-by.

While I enjoyed myself here, burger-wise, I was not missing very much.  Burger ($11 base, $12 with fried egg) is in the ""build your own burger"" style. I went with lettuce, tomatoes, bacon (not an extra charge, which was a pleasant surprise), raw onion, and a fried egg, on a pretzel bun. So much about this burger was so very mediocre. Most egregiously, the patty, which I ordered medium rare, was medium well at least, with rare flecks of pink peppering an otherwise grey mass of beef. It had a decent flavor, however, despite the crumbly, overcooked consistency of the patty. The pretzel roll was very bready and at times overpowered the burger. Otherwise, the bacon was crispy, the egg was not overcooked, and the fries were pretty good, but on the whole, this burger was solidly below average and not really worth trying. Service was also consistently off; I erroneously got cheddar on my burger despite not asking for it, it took us 20-30 minutes to get waters, and we were brought honey mustard after asking for dijon. However, the waitress was attentive and pleasant enough that these misses did not disturb me.  After a pretty uniformly panned review of the burger, why does Twisted Spoke earn three stars, which I usually reserve for restaurants that at least give me something good to say about their food? It has a great beer list (including Half Acre Akari Shogun), and the roof deck is awesome. Seriously, I could have eaten a hockey puck on a bun up there on a nice day and still enjoyed it. These factors alone make the Spoke a worthwhile experience. I'll be back to drink and probably to try the wings, but I'll skip the burger.",0.9929,0.797,0.167,0.036,0.5628696126568468

But I have been impressed with every item I've had on this menu, so much so that I'm able to branch out often and try new things, instead of relying on stand-bys and favorites like I do with other restaurants.  I have had, and rate 5 stars, to the following menu items: - Jumbo Steak Burrito          Not quite as big as Ty Domi's head, but the perfectly cooked steak and the great ingredients make up for quantity with quality. - FatBoy Burger         You can add grilled onions, barbecue, lettuce, tomato, BACON, cheese. You can choose the bun. You have the option for fried egg and avocado. It's all gold. This is the cure for the hangover before it starts.  - French Fries        Cut and seasoned perfectly, a great compliment to their homemade barbecue sauce, which I would drink on its own.  - Fried Egg Sandwich       I order this the most, because if anyone else in the restaurant orders it, I get food envy. It's beautiful, it's huge, and it's delicious. - Bloody Mary w/ Scotch       It's like drinking a campfire. A delicious, smokey, bacon filled camp fire.  I highly recommend this place...it's worth traveling to if you're not in the neighborhood. I can't wait for summer and the roof deck.",0.9949,0.714,0.239,0.046,0.6106324110671937

The bloody marys are really good. Not the best in this world, but really good. I like the flavor of parm cheese in it, but sometimes it becomes really annoying to try and fit the shredded cheese through the straw.  The brunch is great...usually potatoes are served with breakfast food as a cheap filler but have zero flavor. Not here! They were one of the best parts of the meal!  The corned beef hash is a perfect hangover remedy. Basically, I mix the hash, the potatoes, and the poached eggs together for one big breakfast mess. The blood mary washes it down, and I'm cured! The only complaint is that this place could stand to expand, especially in the bar area. It gets very, very cramped. This place is always busy, too. There is NEVER any good parking, prepare to walk or park illegally.

French toast that had been sitting in the warming tray or on the counter for at least 10 minutes before it was served. Bacon was microwaved and hard and could have taken out a steel filling in a tooth if you bit down too hard. Waitress claimed juice was fresh squeezed but was clearly concentrate.

They showed the deep fried goodness items I knew I had to try plus various Bloody Marys I knew my friend would appreciate. I finally went a couple weeks ago and am really glad I did. Street parking is a bit rough to find but that's the parking option. The atmosphere is super chill and kind of biker meets metal. We had no issue getting seats for a late weekday lunch. I was happy to see they had 5 Rabbit on tap but only Vida Muerte which is not my favorite from the brewer. $6 for a bottle and I guzzled it right down! I tried a bit of my friend's Road Rash Bloody Mary that they are famous for - oOoO spicy! Going here, I had a goal to try all the deep fried items I had seen on Chicago's Best so we had a feast of appetizers! Tempura bacon $5 - Amazeballs. I've had deep fried bacon before but having it in tempura batter is what makes this the best deep fried bacon I've tried. It melted in my mouth and was a fantastic spin on the swine candy. Fried cheese curds $6 - Delicious! They use Wisconsin cheddar cheese which is a bit different than the usual cheese curds. They were very deep fried, maybe a tad too much, but man were they good. Ooey, gooey, yum. Wild Ones $8 - Loved this. Deep frying + Mushrooms = Healthy, right? Deep fried mushrooms in 4 varieties, I believe it was. One of those varieties was portobello which are a personal favorite of mine! Yum! All three of these deep fried goodnesses were served with at least one dipping sauce. I'd get any of these apps again, but I have my eye on the grilled cheese for the next time I stop in. And yes, there will definitely be a next time!",0.9933,0.76,0.179,0.06,0.580880574452003

The plate came back to our table with the same temperature....not sure what happened here...   The salad I ordered was pretty mediocore..Just letuce, 2 tomato wedges and 2 cucumber wedges drenched in dressing and a rock hard crouton. When we asked for our check, we spoke up and told him we were unhappy about the plate coming out cold and it was pretty bad. He said he couldn't do anything about it and became defensive and explained if we had eaten less, he could have done something about it earlier. I was actually shocked at this remark and told him that we had been sitting waiting for him to come back---he never came to check on us once after he brought back the cold plate of rice. Even if this server would have apologized or something, I could have been ok with this..but the fact of the matter is, you just don't treat customers like this.

Then he asks me if I want them to heat it up for me. I agree and he takes it and a few minutes later he returns with the food the same tempeture. Did he rest it under the heat lamps? I tell him I dont think I should be paying for this and he replies ""Well you already ate some of it."" and we tell him' That was due to the fact we were sitting around waiting, wondering when and if he'd return to check up on us.

Our server (not sure of his name, but I'll just refer to him as Handlebar Mustache Man with the glazed over look in his eye) was by far the worst server I've ever had. He was rude to me right off the bat after he carded me for my Diet Coke because ""Ummm.. this is a BAR, not a restaurant..."" OK, fine. All he had to say was that we had to be 21 or over to be in there since no one carded us at the door. After his attitude, I decided I didn't even want to order food from them since their server was rude to me and probably would have spit in whatever I ordered. Most of the other people at the table ordered food and most of them were not satisfied with their food. My friend ordered a basket of fries, which she shared with the rest of the table. I find it difficult to refer to them as ""fries,"" however, as they were really more like burnt potato nuggets. Not very appetizing. My other friend ordered a grilled cheese and some burnt potato nuggets, but between the server spilling drinks over her food and the low quality, she left the bar less than satisfied. When coming back to the table to ""check if we needed anything else,"" he would stand at the end of our table and just hold his arms out waiting for someone to ask him for something. And when he came back to deliver drinks, he would never remember who ordered what and would just hold the drink out for someone to grab, meanwhile spilling drinks on whoever was in his path. Obviously, Handlebar Mustache Man was the main problem at this establishment, but I would not recommend going here if you are looking for good food or good service with a friendly atmosphere.

First off, there is an entire wall of the restaurant devoted to all types of spirits, focusing on whiskey. You'll find anything you want, from Jack Daniels to 20 year aged Scotch. The best day of the week is Whiskey Wednesday, when all their whiskey offerings are 1/2 off.  Their drink menu is truly impressive, putting their biker ""spin"" on a number of classic cocktails. Their beer menu is fantastic, keeping at least 10 varieties on tap at any time (changing by taste to account for the season) with at least a hundred more offerings on their bottle and their bottle reserve list. Being a carnivore, I'm very pleased by their bloody mary's, all of which feature some type of meat in them.  The food goes well beyond standard pub fare ranging from giant burgers cooked to perfection (fat boys) to seared tuna sandwiches to fish tacos. I've never been disappointed by a dish I've had there. Make sure you get an order of their barbecue sauce on the side for your fries - it's fantastic.  All this good food and drink is accentuated by some bitchin' posters, motorcycle parts, and a spinning motorcycle on the outside of the building with a skeleton riding it.

Oh Twisted Spoke, I heard so many good things about you so I was dying to try you and finally I was going to eat bad on a Sunday after doing so well for about a week and a half. Sunday afternoon, no line, perfect.  Walk in and no one pays a bit of attention to us.  Maybe we were to preppy or maybe they were just busy.  After a couple of minutes a guy that was sitting on the stairs gets up and gets us menus and then shows us to a little table right in the front.  Fine with us.  It was too hot to sit outside.  He proceeds to rattle off something about a limited brunch menu, but they have some sandwiches.  I distinctly remember hearing him say portobello mushroom sandwich.   Anyway, we sit and wait and wait.  No one comes.  Finally water comes out.  We wait and wait and wait.  Finally our server with hot red lips comes over.   The weird thing was that she must have walked by us at least 5 times before stopping.  WE ARE STARVING!  Please, help us get some food! We order up the Bloodies!  I have to say 5 stars on the delicious bloodies.  They really were a great TREAT!  YUMMY!  Not to mention, spicy and loaded with cheese, meat and all the fixings.  This would be worth coming back for.  All for $8! So I was kind of confused about the menu because they have limited lunch menu on Sundays.  However, the server stated different things were available than the guy that sat us.  So that was annoying.  Just make a printed menu of whats available on Sundays...is it that hard?  Its not like their menu is this extravagant thing.  Instead, one person is telling us one thing and then the server is saying, 'oh no, thats not available today.'  Get your shit straight.   We decided on the shrimp po'boy and the bbq chicken sandwich.  The po'boy was FISHY!  It was like I had a bite of the shrimp and seriously tasted it in my mouth until after we left the restaurant.  GROSS!  Out of the places that I have recently went for po'boys, this was by far, my least favorite.  The chicken was good, however, I wouldnt go out of my way for it.  I also found it interesting that they dont have ranch here.  They serve wings, etc.  No ranch.  Just Green Goddess, which is good, however, its not ranch??! Overall, I was disappointed in Twisted Spoke.  I get the grungy, biker look, however, I still expect good service and people that know what they are talking about.  Also, if you are going on a Sunday and looking for a healthy option, this is NOT the place for you.  Everything was like a heart attack waiting to happen.  Where I also was kind of disappointed about.",-0.7672,0.755,0.112,0.133,0.5668964076858813

Not to mention some of the best damn bread & toffee down the street.  When I was living near here as a very young man with a baby, I remember walking across Grand ave very late, holding my infant daughter. There were 2 bikers outside of twisted spoke. This guy revved his engine super loud, unnecessarily loud, then ROARED an inch or two from me and my baby. I never wanted to strike someone so badly, thankfully my baby is ok but she could have seriously been injured from some prick on a harley. Kind of had a grudge against this place ever since.  Enough prequel, here it is: The good:  They expanded their menu, they used to have these AMAZING corn fries for like a year that were great and came with a strange dipping sauce.   Now they have like 35 different kinds of burgers, sandwiches & salads. The menu is very large, the drinks are all different also. They have fish tacos for us trying to squeeze into a size 18.  Their rooftop is one of the best in the city IMO. Love the spinning freaky ass skeleton. Service seems to have really picked up. Scruffy looking dudes but they live to serve you. I left a 25% tip. Smut and eggs: do they still do this? I hope so, it was so weird and radical. You get to watch 70s porn and eat eggs at like 3am. This was my "" I am too drunk to go home"" spot.  Tons of bikers. The harley kind. The bad: Fish tacos are kinda bleh.  The Smokin Salma bloody mary was really gross, the cold cheese pieces were all I remember, and they were awful. I want to try some others though.  The scruffy dude waiter forgot I asked for another tortilla, but they were kinda dry and hard so whatever.  Tons of bikers. The harley kind. Worth trying if you have never been here, and I will hit it up on occasion, but they need to tighten the bootstraps a bit more and I will be in here puking up eggs at 3am on the regs.

We walked in, not really sure what to expect and sat at the bar.  There were a few different bloody mary's to choose from.  He of course had the one with bacon in it and I thought I would regret my decision of not ordering the same but mine was just as delish!  (However every time I go, I now get the one with bacon and hickory vodka.)  I'm pretty sure I was hangin' a little bit and that's always makes it hard to pick food when you're feeling like that.  As soon as I saw corned beef hash and poached eggs, it was the easiest and best decision I've ever made.  The corned beef has was NOT out of a can or anywhere near that.  REAL corned beef! SHREEDED! REAL! with decent sized potatoes as well.  it was AMAZING! Also a pretty good portion including 3 poached eggs with toast and a side of their potatoes.   Our bartender was so nice! After our bloody mary's my man tried walbanger, and i tried a cock smasher.  She had served one to someone next to me and it looked amazing, and with a name like that how could I pass it up? It was great! And loaded with alcohol.  Let me remind you this is around noon.  With so many good drinks being served up we couldn't stop trying them! My boyfriend walked down the street to get some cigarettes and I had let her know that we were actually celebrating our ""anniversary"" as well that and I ordered us some very small glasses of champagne with strawberries.  Not the place you'd normally get this but she was so accommodating.  After that we ordered their wings that were literally on fire.  AWesome!

The sandwich was pretty good until I bit down on a plastic tie closure that you would see on a loaf of bread! The waiter said he was sorry and ordered me a fresh sandwich. As I waited he brought me out some more very salty French fries. The other sandwich was just as good as the first minus the plastic in it. When the bill came they did not take my meal off or discount it. When I brought it to the attention of the waiter he said let me see what he could do. He returned with my sandwich at half price. The sandwich should have been free and the manager should have come over to check on the problem. Would not go back to this place to eat.,0.9324,0.86,0.115,0.025,0.4206597222222222

But this one... this one stuck. I've had some stellar New Year's Day experiences but this one takes it. Hungover, we were worried bars would be closed (a massive difference b/t Indy & Chicago). Twisted Spoke came to the rescue.  To mash our hangovers to a pulp, we needed a raucous packed house of hooligans that all agree that the best thing for this situation and to celebrate New Year's is the perfect bloody mary & quality brunching. Twisted Spoke raised the bar with salami, onions, shrimp, pickles, olives and celery salt in their Bloody. A meal in itself, indeed. It came -- no questions -- with a lager back. It was truly a five star Bloody experience.  The buckwheat pancakes and poached eggs were perfect. The gumbo with a poached egg was perfect, too.  The bartenders were holding down the crowd, and all the while able to answer (note: pre Shazam era) my question of what exact song was on the speakers (Velvet Underground's ""Success."" Please forgive my missing of this song in my upbringing.)

2011-11-11,5.0,"Ok, I will state this up front: I live in DC where gastropubs are everywhere but all of which are a) overpriced compared to the rest of America b) have average at best food. So perhaps I got a little too excited about this place because: 1. Beer prices are reasonable. 5 to 6 bucks for a pint. Anywhere outside San Diego I can get a Stone beer for that price makes me a very happy man.  2. The beer selection is excellent. I admit my West Coast bias might be popping up since they had a lot of West Coat beers (such as the aforementioned Stone).  3. They have a good selection of whiskeys. Plus half off whiskey on Wednesdays?? Makers Mark for $3 on Monday evenings? That alone makes me have to give this place at least 4 stars. If any bar in DC had those kind of deals, it would be a complete and total shitshow.  4. Maybe we chose the right dishes, but the food we had was very good too. I had a pulled pork sandwich and my companion had a spicy fried catfish sandwich. The latter was legitimately spicy and the bread it came on was top notch. I have a hunch North Carolinians wouldn't find the bbq sauce on the pulled pork to be legit (probably a little too sweet and not enough vinegar for them), but I found it to be pretty tasty.  5. Friendly, prompt service. No, it isn't a legit biker bar. Yeah, the staff might not know shit about the beers (I honestly don't know since I didn't have to ask about them), but they will give you a free sample of a draft if you want, and do people really expect a bartender to know about every single beer the place serves? When the beer list is longer than the food menu? I have to say some Chicago yelpers have some very high standards! But anyhoo...

2011-06-12,3.0,"Like the Chicago naked bike ride last night, this place is mostly hit or miss.  The thing Twisted Spoke has going for it is a great roof top patio. In the summer I don't know if you can find a better patio. In fact, for my money, I could spend all Sunday afternoon up there and be perfectly content. For all the flack they catch for being a biker bar, which you would think would result in bad service, I've found it to be the opposite. On my two visits, the staff has been friendly and the service attentive, especially considering that they have to walk up those stairs to deliver drinks on the roof. On the miss side, I think the food (other than the burgers) leaves something to be desired. The sandwich was dry, salads boring, and I just can't get my head around why there are Mexican dishes on this menu? They do have a solid beer list. Some great microbrews that are generally hard to find like Stone, Tyranena, Dogfish Head, and a reasonable selection of Belgians. The beer list is much, much better than one would expect from a biker bar, where Budweiser is likely the best seller. I actually ordered a whiskey sour, which was surprisingly good. A strong drink, but well made albeit a bit on the pricey side at $10. With that said, if you're looking for a good summer rooftop patio scene with a good beer list and burgers then Twisted Spoke is for you.",0.9783,0.822,0.149,0.029,0.5575268817204301

Came in here with few of my friends for a late lunch randomly, only because the resteraunt we were going to a block down was closed.  We were very surprised how good The Twisted Spoke was! This place seemed to be set up as a biker bar, but it was also set up as family friendly.  With rooftop and back room seating you can bring your family to seperate from the bar. Overall, staff was very friendly and helpful when it was time to choose a beer and food.  Service was very quickly, it probably only took 10 minutes or so from the time we order to the time our food came out. Normally, ""bar"" food like this, is normally greasy and sits in your stomach. I was shocked how it didn't!  I highly reconmend pretty much anything on the menu, but especially the burgers and slice homemade fries. They are to die for! Also, the meatloaf sandwhich and shrimp sandwhich were also a tasty treat!  The only con that I have was that the menu was kind of confusing. Set up on a clipboard the papers were mixed up between food and drinks. A little bit more organization is need.  Pricing is fair. Not too exspensive. And nosie level was average.. Wasn't too loud!

2011-05-31,3.0,"Rode up on my bicycle with a friend and saw the prettiest girl in Chicago standing out front in an amazing blue dress. So far so good, but she hopped in a cab and was off to someplace better than the Twisted Spoke I bet.  What I found: A fairly run of the mill bar with typical but overpriced bar food on a good but pretty remote corner. They charge extra if you are going to split a burger! Now, that seems just mean! (Note: I stand corrected here. It is $5 to share a ""double"" burger because I was informed that Fonda and Nicholson came in one day and ordered the double then hustled the server for free buns to make a second burger! Easy Riders or Free Riders?) Cool: The rooftop picnic table seating is good and might be worth doing if you are visiting a friend around the corner, and the beer list is long,  Not so cool: The server did not know much about the beer at all. I ordered a mint julep and it came up and was not made right. It was more like a mint gimlet. I sent it back for some sugar, and it was ok, but if the servers don't know the beer and the bartender can't make a drink unless the instructions are written on the bar, how did they get a permit to serve booze? Just wondering.  Not so yummy: The food was pretty basic and uninspired from what I ordered - quesadillas -- and the options for vegetarians was pretty bad. They call Chickpeas here ""Woman peas"" -- how macho -- well it is a biker bar. All the Honda and Kawasaki junk parts make the point that this place is for tough guys in pink polo shirts and boat shoes!  My suggestion, is that you should keep riding PAST the Twisted Spoke even if you find yourself on a Harley Davidson Fat Boy at the corner of Ogden and Grand, but if you see a pretty girl in an amazing blue dress wearing a pair of pretty wedges, pick her up if you can get her to talk to you. If you are visiting someone who lives here and all the little Italian places or nearby cafes are closed, and you must have a roof, well, the breeze was nice.",0.9986,0.75,0.236,0.014,0.562373353596758

The place was absolutely roaring when I arrived around 6:30pm for the event, and why wouldnt it be for such a great tasting event. I never actually even made it around the bar area as it was 5-6 deep, but I used my inspector gadget skills and safely secured a two person table that was overlooked in the back dining area next to some really kind folks (scored my first sailing invite ever!). I didnt eat anything, but all of the food looked and smelled delicious, and the people I asked said the burgers and fries they had were outstanding bar fare. I came for the brew and they certainly delivered. This has to be one of the finest beer collections in Chicago hands-down.

There is even a $125 Manhattan that is supposedly the best you can find (I would hope so at that price).

The deal - Half off all whiskeys on Wednesdays. Maybe it's just because I hail for a ridiculously expensive town, but $3.25 for a Maker's Mark on the rocks (and they definitely don't skimp on the whiskey) seems pretty freaking incredible.  The food - To call this a burger bar definitely doesn't do it justice because everything is pretty amazing. I had such a hard time deciding what to eat here because the menu is so different and innovative that everything looked great. First off, BACON TEMPURA!!!! You have to get it.

It was a nice cooler Thursday evening and we sat on the rooftop and sipped on the drink special of the day, a $5 Gutter Slut Margarita. Heck yes. Tequila was plentiful in that one drink. I ordered the chicken tacos - but really had a hard time deciding because everything on the menu sounded kind of awesome. I chose wisely - they were delicious. A slightly twisted take on your typical Mexican restaurant tacos because the tortilla was slightly crispy. The waiter laughed at me when I overzealously said ""YES"" when he asked I'd need sour cream.  Their menu is sheets of paper attached to a clipboard. Oh simplicity, I adore thee.

Even after we got our drinks it still took a little bit to place our food order, yet she was patient and genuinely pleasant the whole while.  The names of some the menu items may have you cracking up a bit. Like my drink, which was the Gutterslut. It had sass (sauza gold), was dirty (martini type dirty), and had some pucker (triple sec; sweet & sour mix).

I have eaten here over a dozen times but just returned, after a five year hiatus due to my move to Miami, and was glad to find the Spoke just as good as when I left her.  First off the beer selection is incredibly extensive (as an out of town-er I always start with some type of Goose Island) and there is a type and flavor for every beer drinker. However if beer isn't your bag they have a HUGE list of whiskeys, full bar and one of the best Bloody Marys in the city...

The Boss Hog (pulled pork sando), Giant Steak Burrito and the Meatloaf are three that immediately stand out as front runners. The Meatloaf is better than any of your Mom's meatloaf which is served on light, yet not soggy, garlic bread and the Boss Hog's sauce is sweet and savory. Did I mention that the fries that come with each sandwich are cut from fresh potatoes that day?

Everything from top to bottom was fantastic. The bloody mary was one of the best I've ever had!! They also had an impressive beer list and food menu. While the service was excellent, the food definitely stole the show - not what I expected at all. Everything that we ordered was delectable and next time we return I'll definitely have a tough time ordering knowing how good everything was. Between the 3 of us, I got a chance to taste the following:  -Pulled Pork Sandwich - Delicious, not too sweet.  -Steak Burrito - Recommended by our waiter and it was perfection on a plate. Very tasty.  -Meatloaf Sandwich - AMAZING!! The meatloaf was so light and it was served in between 2 thick slices of garlic bread. Who does that????

2009-11-16,5.0,"This review starts with a simple story.  I used to hate bloody marys.  I hated them.  I found them detestable, just the smell of the tomato juice would make me want to hurl.  Now keep in mind that I am not a picky eater.  I'll eat anything, I'll try anything, very little grosses me out, but there was something about the consistency/smell of bloody mary mix that I just couldn't stand. Over the years I tried to like bloody mary's just because they seemed like something that I should probably acquire a taste for (I like brunch, I like drinking, I like drinking for brunch, etc.)  so I kept trying.  Choking down a bloody mary here and there, I'd always try to get one down at least a few times a year, occassionally having one that was palatable but still kind of gross. Then, I had a Twisted Spoke bloody mary.  And I didn't just choke it down, I actually sort of liked it.  I went back a week later, and I tried another one, went down smoother this time, and I didn't feel like puking at all.  Another week, another bloody, this time I actually kind of enjoyed it.  The next week I was actually looking forward to it, and now I absolutely love them.  To the point that it cured my aversion to other bloody marys, I can even put down an airport bloody mary now.  But the best one I've ever had is at the Twisted Spoke, (incidentally the only one I ever had that came close was at the Palazzo in Las Vegas). So there's the Bloody Mary, that in and of itself would cause me to recommend the Spoke, but add in the awesome beer, and completely unique and most extensive whiskey selection I've ever seen, not to mention the food is great , and it really takes the Spoke over the top. Also a point about the waitstaff.  When I first moved to the neighborhood (about 5 years ago) I went to the Spoke a few times, and kind of hated it.  The waitstaff was indifferent at best, and mostly rude and too cool for school.  Since the renovation (where they smartly moved the bar to the front of the house) there seemed to also be a personality makeover with the staff.  Everyone there is super nice and friendly, and I always feel welcome going in there, and really enjoy my time there.",0.991,0.665,0.205,0.13,0.5804067460317459

2009-09-05,1.0,There is a reason why they need to use porn to get you in on a Saturday night.  We walked in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and no one was by the door and they didn't have a sign as to whether you wait or seat yourselves. The bartender seemed to ignore us as did the other workers. It seemed apparent that is it wasn't their job then they weren't going to assist the patrons. A woman came from the back up front and literally looked around us to look outside and look for someone. She completely behaved like we were invisible. So we decided to seat ourselves. The picnic tables on the roof are uncomfortable and hard to eat at. I'm sure they are fine since for boozing. We get our menus and I'm pretty excited about the selection. After deciding between a few selections and waiting a long time the waitress comes and apologizes  that she was sorry and she didn't know anyone was at her table. Which I guess is understandable since we sat ourselves. She then tells us that the items we want to order off the menus (which were given to us just 10 minutes wrong) were not available. We could only get the brunch/breakfast items. It was 1:10 in the afternoon! She said we could also get the fat boy hamburger (thought the menu says it is only available M-F and it is Saturday) or the BBQ or grilled cheese. The kicker is that the menu is a series of pages printed off a printer and put in a clip board--not a laminated professional made one. Why not pull the 6 pages of the menu out that we can't order from? Or why not have the person who gives the menus say to wait for the waitress to explain or that we can only get brunch? It seemed again like no one waned to do anything that wasn't their specific job title. Since I had to look at my menu longer she took my husband's order and then came back for mine. Instead of waiting for my order she put in his and so his food came super fast and to be polite he waited for my meal. The waitress again apologized that she had instructed them to wait for order. During this time a group sat down next to us. I could overhear them talking about how slow the service was and after they all decided which appetizers they wanted the waitress informed them they could not order them. The group (rightly so) was confused as to why they couldn't order appetizers in the afternoon.  My food came and I ended up ordering something I wasn't excited about because I didn't want eggs and don't like breakfast food so my choices were slim. I didn't finish my burger or fries. The food was better than average but not worth any special effort to go out of my way for--especially considering everything else. I have no interest to see what else they have to offer.  If you want to waste your money on waitresses with pink or overly blonde hair and tattoos and a skeleton spinning on a motorcycle out front then go ahead. But that's all you're paying for.   P.S.

2009-07-14,3.0,"I was brought here by a new friend for a few drinks and eats mid-afternoon on a Saturday after my massage, so I was wonderfully mellow and in a great mood. Street parking was available, but it was $2 for 2 hours and that was the max you could choose, which sucked. However, the fact that parking existed was a nice surprise. We started at the bar downstairs, which was sparkling with alcohol choices, thinking it would be cooler than sitting outside. The bartender was nice and gave me a beer suggestion (which I honestly can't remember) that ended up being a very yummy stout as well as a few suggestions to my drinking companion. After sitting inside for a few minutes we realized that the air conditioning wasn't on and the wall of windows at our back wasn't really helping with the muggy closed feeling at the bar. We decided to move upstairs to the outside deck and within a few minutes they'd found us a table with an umbrella as I am terribly pasty and unable to stand direct sunlight for very long.  The upstairs deck was cute and we were given a table (picnic like) in the corner to ourselves. The menu selection was pretty decent and although we considered ordering one of their giant burgers we never did get around to it. Instead, we ordered appetizers and ordered the Portabella mushrooms and cheese poppers. The food arrived promptly and although it wasn't bad, it was pretty bland. The breaded mushroom poppers really just tasted like fry grease and the cheese poppers weren't really any better. However, they had an amazing beer selection listed (although I was unable to partake of more than a few as I was going to be driving after lunch) which I'm sure makes up for the lackluster food.  A few other things: Our waitress, the poor dear, appeared rather wilted from having to run up and down the stairs in the heat without even the respite of air conditioning inside. However, even being close to collapse from heat exhaustion, she was friendly and sweet for which I give her huge props. The bathroom was clean and well stocked with toilet paper, which is a huge deal for us ladies. Overall the place appeared well kept and well run.

2009-05-06,1.0,"I have been to the Twisted Spoke probably 25-30 times in my life.  I went there well before a lot of the gentrification took place in the area, and continued to go every now and then for the good beer selection and daily specials.  I have never been a big fan of anything in particular that they had on their menu to eat, the food is just okay.   My reason for the one star, and reason that I will never go there again mostly has to do with my last experience.  I took a seat near the bar with my soon to be brother-in-law, and his brother.  We were planning on a couple of beers and a bite to eat before the Blackhawks play-off game.  We got there at about 4:30, with the game starting at 7pm the Blackhawks crowd was not overwhelming.  Shortly after we sat down we were approached by a waiter.  We ordered beers and had not yet committed to ordering food.  I had a couple of questions about beers on the menu that I wasn't completely familiar with.  The fauxhawk, aging hipster waiter, who's knowledge is likely steeped in PBR and cocaine told me that one beer I asked about was somewhere between my brother-in-law's beer (Stiegl Pils) and my beer (Dark Horse- Smoked Stout).  Okay, maybe this guy is not an expert, but we had polar opposite beers, could he be a little more specific?  I asked if the beer in question was hoppy?  ""yeah, it has hops"".  That really didn't bother me that much, I just thought it was funny that a beercentric place like Twisted Spoke doesn't require some sort of beer knowledge from their wait staff.   So... our beers are empty for 20 minutes.  We see our waiter walking around, chatting up regulars, talking to other staff, we try to make eye contact, tried to wave him down.   It almost seemed like we were being purposely ignored.  I finally told my brother-in-law who's back was facing the bar to just order another round from the bar tender.  He get's her attention and the bartender asks if we have a server.  He says ""yeah, but we have had empty beers for 20 minutes and have not been approached.""  Our waiter overhears the conversation from the back of the bar and sticks out his head, looks at my B.I.L. and says ""Dude!""  The bartender tells him that our server will be right with us.  A few minutes later ""Dude"" shows up and takes our beer order.  I watch him then to see if he puts it in to the bartender.  I could not tell for sure, but I didn't see her pour our beers.  ""Dude"" continues to chat up regulars, talk to the bartender about something... 10 more minutes go by, no beers...  I look for $5 out of my wallet, don't have it, my B.I.L. slaps it down ($2.50 beer special x2)  We get our jackets together and head for the door.  All of a sudden we have ""Dude's"" attention.  ""Dude, hey guys, dude, where are you going?  I tell him the money is on the table, later.  What a fuck face!  If you want to look at tattoos and ironic facial hair on a disinterested staff,  come here!",0.6318,0.912,0.048,0.04,0.4190145502645503

2008-04-23,5.0,"I am going to slide into first person plural here, people. Your mileage may vary, but it probably will not. Our beers at the Twisted Spoke on Ogden run the gamut. Our draft handles change occasionally. One Saturday, I noticed He'brew Origin Ale on for the first time. We recently put on Flossmoor Station's Gandy Dancer Honey Ale. The beers on draft are craft brews. If you must have the behemoths, they're available in bottles. I posted a recent directory of our beers on  beermapping.com  's forum. What I typically have at the Spoke is the 'pot-luck' (or elsewhere as the 'mystery beer') known here as the ""Butch's Beer Special"". The language describing it is such: ""We carry 56 good beers and one that really sucks. It's usually best not to ask too many questions like 'What is it?'. What it is is only two bucks."" But this is hyperbole. Except for one beer which was, in my estimation, unquestionably stale and must have been bought by the Einhorn Bros. from the distributor which was allowing it to go away [and if you have read about Larry Bell's situation - you *know* how rarely this happens] to another distributor. Because the other beers that have turned up in this special have been great beers from Lakefront, Victory, Left Hand, Mac Tarnahan's, Anchor, *New Belgium*, and once [I do not have to make this up.] even Affligem Abbey Ale. Food: Our hamburgers (Fatboys) are really, really good. I noticed we have begun serving them on a pretzel roll. Despite that, I have tried some of the other items on our menu. The Kobe Steak burrito, and the BBQ chicken sandwich (available with the BBQ sauce developed when the Bros. had the lawsuit-attracting 'Bone Daddy' restaurant up the street [It is now a plebian sports bar called 'Mahoney's'.]) are very good. The French Fries are superb. I've been detected scarfing the remains from other diners' plates. And at 11:59 pm on Saturday, you can again order from the breakfast menu. I think the Wisconsin Scramble is the best option there. Bring the kids. What I show is better than anything they'll find on the Internet.  O.K. That was a wisecrack. Bring the kids some other time. Transit: We're 3 blocks away from the Blue Line ""L""'s ""Chicago"" station. (Walk south-southwest down Ogden Ave. It would be a five block walk if you exited at ""Grand"".) Parking is available on the side streets south and east of Grand & Ogden. If you're exiting the Kennedy at Ogden, continue the additional block south of Grand and turn left [east] on Fulton. There should be spots on Fulton, Elizabeth (a one-way northbound street between Fulton & Ogden), or Racine. This is a great place. We have migrated over to the new area facing the southwest corner. The old bar area will become a dining room. We now have Dish Network dbs as well as cable (for the tube televisions). The two Pioneer DV-400V DVD players can provide separate programs on each of the large flat-screen TVs.

Having said that the Spoke's menu offers a total of 15 Brunch entrees of which 9 are meat based.  That's a lot of meat!  As a matter of fact if you calculate the percentage we are talking 60% meat.  Just to give you some perspective the Bongo Room's menu is roughly 5% meat based (Fuck'n Weak!). I'm not going to let myself get into another Chicago brunch rant, but seriously Chicago Brunch Places hike up your skirts and put some meat on the menu! And I'm not asking for asiago shitake chicken sausage! I want chicken fried steak, corned beef hash, steak & eggs.......... (Deep Breath....Find your center....Ahhhhh) Ok, back to Twisted Spoke.  The menu is great. For those of you who like sweet vs savory the Elvis French Toast is silly good, the buckwheat pancakes are solid, and the oatmeal is yummy. For those of you who like to put the lunch in brunch, the corned beef hash is one of the best in the city and the burgers are can't miss.  Twisted Spoke also offers scrambles that include Polish Sausage, Italian Sausage, or Bratwurst.  In my opinion they have one of the best brunches in the city and we haven't even talked about the Bloody Mary's or the porn yet. You may have picked up that I have affinity for meat and this also applies to my breakfast drinks.  Twisted Spoke loads their bloodies with cheese, pepperoncinis, olives, and yep you guessed it salami.  They are spiced just right and pair well with the corned beef hash. Good food: Check. Good drinks: Check. Hardcore porn from the early 70's: Check Yep, that right! On Saturday nights starting at midnight and running through around 3:00am the Spoke serves up their amazing breakfast delicacies with a side of nasty sweaty hardcore mostly old school porn.  Amazing. The service blows. 1 Elvis Toast 1 Corned Beef Hash 2 Bloodies ------------------------------ $30 PS...

2007-07-19,4.0,"I'll say this much: The Twisted Spoke isn't for everybody. Fortunately, it is for me, kinda. I've gone quite a few times knowing that we would be served the greasy fried food most reviewers before me have noted. Overall, the food is not bad. My favorite items of all are the chicken wings. I don't know what my obsession is with these fatty bird limbs, but dang it, I love 'em chicken wangs! I am especially enamored with the lemon ones, and though taste-wise they aren't mind-blowing, they set them on fire right in front of your eyes. Pyromaniacs, unite! The place itself isn't, well, it isn't ""pretty"", and I understand why people would feel that it is dirty - it's not though, the illusion of grunginess is part of the ambiance. So, if your scene includes martini bars or ultra hip lounges, this may not be the place for you. But, if you are open-minded, crave greasy (but good) food (especially flambed chicken wangs) and are willing to give a place a chance (like yours truly, as long as there aren't obvious signs of serious health code violations), I say go check it out. With the right group of people, and knowing that it just ain't fancy, you too might enjoy it. Fortunately, I've never been treated badly, and hopefully you won't be either.  As a side-note, I'll be completely honest and say that the main reason I went the first time was because of the Smut 'n Eggs. Now, I'm no porno fiend or anything like that, but I never heard of such a thing and just *had* to see it for myself! Of course, one thing was what I *imagined* it would be like, and quite another was what it actually was. Unlike what took place in my overactive imagination, in reality it was pretty much people sitting at a bar with a couple of TVs showing a bad 70s naughty adult film. The kicker is that I don't think anyone was even looking at the screens! Would I do the Smut 'n Eggs thing again? Probably not, but it makes a great tale for my non-Midwestern friends about the craaaaaaaazy things that people do around here =)",0.994,0.811,0.148,0.042,0.6338690476190475

I truly honestly want to return here and have them prove me wrong. I doubt that I will though. We went here on the recommendation of a friend. It was after a playing a game of soccer, it was a beautiful Sunday morning still and we were all day dreaming of going to a place that would welcome a sweaty group out to eat food and have a few pints. We walk in and are told the wait would be 45 minutes. (Fair enough for a party of a dozen) Since some of us were real hungry we walked about the neighborhood looking for second options. As soon as one of us found one (a restaurant) a table miraculously appeared. This should have been a harbinger of things to come but sometimes it is best to retain a sunny disposition. This was followed by prompt water service and the nightmare began. I initially didn't want to blame our server, after all when you have over 30 beers on your menu it will be difficult to keep track of all of them. It would ALSO be nice while we were sipping our water if we were provided with a beer menu. We were still game at this point so we all hastily started picking our drinks. Of the 12 of us ONLY 3 were able to get the drinks that they wanted immediately. We weren't ordering obscure beers. Corona, Amstel Light and Miller Lite are as mainstream as you get, but none of these were available. Still fair enough, we persevered.  When we finally were able to settle enough to get our drinks, after 3 or 4 tries in some cases our server disappeared. At this point we notice one in our party didn't get their drink. WHISKEY! TANGO! FOXTROT!  Our server finally returns and yet again dismissively answers that, they were out of the drink.  We still gamed on. -Like I said I REALLY let places treat me like crap before I blow them off. At this point some in our party have just about had enough. My breaking point came when FINALLY our server remembers that the reason people come to restaurants is to eat. She stopped by to inquire what we would be dining and it is at this point that I gave up. We were now close to 45 minutes but it felt like an eternity. When one of us attempts to order a meal on their menu she declares that the only meals served were from the brunch menu. Hello!?

2006-11-15,3.0,"This place has cheap drinks: $2 whiskey & coke (Early Times).  Fun during baseball season, they usually have the Cubbies on one TV and the Sox on another.  Also awesome: the rooftop!  I'm a huge fan of the neighborhood (the restaurant sits on the intersection of Grand and Ogden).  Cool views.  They also get props for the cool motorbike props and pictures of badass Brando. Two things I don't like: 1) The interior feels very stark (yes, I know it's a biker bar, but sitting in a restaurant/bar shouldn't feel like you're at the garage waiting for your mechanic to fix your Indian).  The dining room is too spread out and the metal/grey decoration is cold and uninviting.  2) The bruch was a massive dissapointment.  I love breakfast and bloody marys on Sunday, but the breakfast burrito was average and my partner's Wisconsin breakfast was mediocre too.  Plus babies screaming and being placed in the smoking section wasn't too much fun for me either. Twisted Spoke's much-hyped bloody marys?  Try Silver Cloud for EXCELLENT bloody marys -- even with the ham and cheese, the bloodys here were just about average.  I would give it 4 stars if it wasn't for the last time being so blah.",-0.3324,0.774,0.11,0.116,0.6868115942028986

But then one day my boyfriend and I were starving and wanted instant gratification, so crossed the street we did.  I recommend the Portabella Mushroom Burger it's vegetarian friendly and extremely delicious. The waiters are nice and friendly, but not overfriendly, they let you be while you're enjoying your meal. And if you just want to get a drink they're one of my favorite places to get a gin & tonic.  I don't recommend coming on a weekend day though, it's overcrowded with tourist-types and families.

If you have a taste for a Corona they don't have it but you'll be pleasantly surprised to have a Sol which is a beer very similar to Corona. The Fatboy Burgers  are a burger person's dream. They come prepared with several types of cheese and maan are they great. The Bloody Eggs are also excellent. They are eggs mixed with all kinds of bloody meat fixins'. That might sound disturbing but it's delicious.  The Portobello Mushroom Burgers and pretty awesome too. Their fries are not the regular kind, they are the better kind, sort of like Rally's fries.
