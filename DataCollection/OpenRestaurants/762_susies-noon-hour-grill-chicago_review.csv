We sat down at a small two top table. Susie asked us to move so a single person could sit there and motioned for us to move to a bigger table. No big deal. I had the Bulgogi omelette and my friend had the Bulgogi and Kimchi omelette. Have to say for a one woman operation, the food came timely and Susie knows how to plate a meal. The food is very good. The only problem with the place is the size. I saw people look in and because it was full, they walked away. We were lucky in that theee was an open table when we got there.

I loved the omelette - the amount of bulgogi is generous, and the eggs are so soft and silky. Probably one of my favorite omelettes I've had.

2017-04-30,5.0,"FOOD: Great Bulgogi steak Omelette. My first time tasting bulgogi steak. It was a tender and thin cut of meat very well marinated with an ever so slight sweetness. Still dreaming of it. The rice was a great consistency. I can never seem to get my rice that way unless I use a microwaveable rice cooker, which--by the way-- is an invention that has changed my life.  SERVICE: I had to come check out this one-woman show myself after reading the reviews. It's legit. Miss Susie is the chef, waitress, busgirl, and cashier. She was very fast, attentive, and had everyone covered. The place is small, so she has the ability to keep an eye on everything at all times and make sure you have what you need.  LOCATION: Great location, right of the Morse Red Line stop. ATMOSPHERE: No nonsense. Pink pleather chairs and easily wipeable tables. Pretty small place, you couldn't do a cartwheel without knocking something over. But why are you doing cartwheels anyways, weirdo?

Susie runs this place like her own home kitchen, which just so happens to have tables in it for you to stop by and get some korean breakfast comfort food. She runs everything herself, so there might be a bit of time to get your food, but a little bit of waiting will provide you with large filled omelets, hash browns, rice, and toast, all for super cheap prices. We got here and got a tofu, veggie, and cheese omelet, and a bulgogi omelet, for $7 and $8 respectively. There were enough for leftovers too.  Two points of surprise when coming here are that one, the menu prices are a little outdated and so the dishes may be a dollar higher than listed(meaning that instead of $5-7 for most things they'll be $6-8, not a large deal). Second is that this place is cash-only, but is also untaxed, which almost balances out the outdated prices.

Three other customers came in about 10 minutes later. She took their order and they were served literally within minutes. I felt confused but I was enjoying my company and again let it go.

I ended up having to call 3 times because the woman had difficulty hearing my order and  brusquely hung up on me, no apologies. After getting my food, I don't feel it was worth the ordeal. The meal was all around pretty tasteless , and the tofu they added was on the creepier side of that which I've encountered , being bland , slimy, and rubbery all at the same time. Additionally , rather than give you a full order of your requested dish, over half the box was gill with just plain rice. There was barely any chop chae in there had I wanted it.

When I had the bi bim bop, she walked by and saw me prodding at it and just chimed in, ""Mix it, mix it."" It was disarming how genuine and familiar she treated me, which added to the homemade quality of the experience. I always get the bulgogi omelette with kimchi and hash browns. The meat is so flavorful and tender, Guy Fieri would be speechless. Three fluffy eggs and melted cheese complete the yumminess of this huge omelette. I can't get enough and crave it every weekend. The bi bim bop is really tasty too, with fresh ingredients and the same bulgogi as an option.  All this delicious food is prepared by one person.

We took a walk around the block and came back after 9 and Suzy was there, but the door wasn't open. It was clear that she was prepping for the day, but let us in since we were standing outside the shop. I almost felt guilty being there - like I'd dropped in unannounced and it was an inconvenience...but we pressed on. Fella ordered the bibimbap and I had the yukejang. Since Suzy runs a solo shop, she was judge, jury and executioner for our meal. The bibimbap was lovely - with lots of good fixins, including perfectly marinated bulgogi and an over easy egg. The brown rice was a hearty foundation for the rest of the bowl. The yukejang, while not the most traditional (there was celery in there...) was still tasty. Not too spicy with lots of shredded beef and veggies. The portions were not lacking in the least. A couple things to be aware of: 1. this place is cash only. 2. the pricing is a bit imprecise. Meaning: the entrees we ordered were one price on the menu (say $8.85 and $7.85 or something to that effect...) and the bill was two entrees for $9/pop. Not breaking the bank for sure, and the breakfast was most certainly worth $9 - but I could see how this kind of thing might irk more particular customers.",0.9821,0.845,0.124,0.03,0.5495169082125604

On the plus side, the portions are big, and the bulgogi was pretty well marinated with a nice flavor. I also liked the homey feel of the restaurant...although I was the only customer and even then Susie was a little slow, so I can only imagine what the service is like on a busy day.

The restaurant is located right across the street from the L tracks. My girlfriend ordered the bibimbop with bulgolgi, which she thought was really good, but not as good as Yeowoosai. Susie also doesn't serve the bibimbop in a stone bowl to keep it warm sadly. I ordered the kimchi omelette, of which I was not a huge fan. Normally I really like cheese and egg, kimchi and egg, or any of these items separately, but I just was not digging them together for some reason. The cheese and kimchi combo just didn't jive with me. I give Susie mad props for running this place by herself and doing everything from cooking to cleaning to bussing by herself. However, I've heard this place can be slow when busy for the aforementioned reasons. I also think she really needs to accept credit cards because almost every restaurant accepts them and we had to go find an ATM to pay.

My last few visits have been a little bit spotty--I've become a huge devotee of the spicy ramen noodles--my buddy Whit told me she saw the seasoning come out of a Maruchan packet.  When I ordered it today, the beef tasted like a MISTAKE--it tasted like I should be afraid of eating it.  I'm sure I'll still return, but the next time I'm going to order hesitantly, no meat darker than a chicken.  Which hurts, because the bulgogi/kimchee omelet is ridiculously good.  The last few visits, the music has also been pretty off the wall--it was opera, then John Williams movie soundtracks, and today it was some hillbilly country that made the questionable meat that much harder to digest.  Also, a friend of mine's boyfriend who is kind of a tool blanked me while we sat a table apart, and he was noticeably rude to Susie while ordering. Not cool, guy.

And then came Bonnie! I wanted to introduce my friend to both her first Korean food experience, and hopefully to Bi Bim Bop ($8.50). That's what we ordered. And it was a hit. The menu has a nice limited choice of breakfast and lunch items, and some creative omelets. I would definitely like to sample breakfast sometime. Breakfast at a price breakfast should be. Omelets are all priced around $5-6.00.  The vegetables in the Bi Bim Bop were very fresh. I loved the zucchini. I don't think I've ever had Zucc in my Bi Bim Bop (now there's a good book title!) The Bulgogi was tender and delicious, and the rice at the bottom was brown-nice and nutty.

Be prepared to wait a while, as Susie runs the whole place by herself and, if you go on a Sunday, the place is packed. My girlfriend tends to go for the omelets. Susie's happier if you choose rice over hash browns, but choose the hash browns anyway - they're delicious. As are her omelets. Somehow, cheese works with bulgogi and kimchee - I would have never guessed! The veggie omelet has every veggie you could possibly want: broccoli, celery, onion, mushroom, maybe some spinach? I don't know, but it's paired with cheese and it's the best thing. I always go for the bibimbap with bulgogi. It's pretty much everything I'd want over rice - carrots, spinach, zucchini, bean sprouts, a nice stack of bulgogi, and a always perfectly fried egg. The rice might be white or brown depending on Susie's mood, and the chili sauce might be in the bowl or served on the side, but I'm not picky. Maybe I've never come to the shop on one of her bad days, but Susie is delightful.

2012-08-18,2.0,"I really wanted to like this place. With all my heart. It seemed like the last bastion of my second half in this windy city. As a Korean-American recently wandering Chicago from Los Angeles (the Mecca of all that is good Korean food, with the exception of Korea), I have been on a desperate search for anything that reminds me a piece of home. Perhaps I just need to stick with what Chicago does best, and for now (although premature) Korean food is not one of them. Don't get me wrong, the Halmonee (grandma) was warm, welcoming and she even let me eat there when it was closing. There really isn't anything wrong about the atmosphere and the homely kitchen look to the place. What I did have a problem with however was the food. I had the Yeukeh Jang and I'm not sure what everyone else has been eating but whatever I ate was not Yeukeh Jang.  By no means is this saying don't go here for food (then again my rating says otherwise), regardless my review probably will have very little effect anyways. To break down the soup... the ingredients in there,I have never seen in my life after a lifetime of eating yeukeh jang. Celery, bell peppers, bulgogi meat? Perhaps I am a bit too harsh, this is not authentic Korean food in the slightest but the rest of the menu did seem a bit promising. She did offer me some bulgogi and kimchi (perhaps she wanted to get rid of it) at no charge and I have to say her bulgogi wasn't too bad. It isn't anything I would kill for but putting myself in the shoes of a hungry lunch hour person, the lunch special would be quite a deal.  The place earns 2 stars solely on the halmonee (grandma) and how warm she made me feel coming to this new town. I would like to give more but honestly...the food is lacking: bland, not spicy, and random ingredients that should not be in traditional dishes. So to sum it up, if you are looking for a good deal on some bulgogi I would recommend the place but if you are looking for authentic Korean food, keep searching.

The food is cheap and plentiful. There's a full breakfast menu of American standards like omelets and pancakes, plus a whole menu of Korean things like bi bim bop and bulgogi. Of course, I ignored the breakfast section and went straight for the bulgogi with kimchi fried rice for $5.95. This is excellent and---I repeat---ONLY $5.95.

I'd have to order a side of kimchi with it and mix it all up... so it would almost be the same. And my meal was about $1.50 less.

My go-to dish is the Bi Bim Bop with Bulgogi, and it never disappoints. The dish consists of Bulgogi, fried egg, carrots, rice, and an assortment of other vegetables. It is quite salty, but that's to be expected with this dish in general. I can't really elaborate much on the dish besides the fact that it is delicious. I went with a group of three friends this last Sunday and we all got the Bi Bim Bop except for one who got the Kimchee omelette. This also looked delicious and was polished off, which I feel is a strong indicator of how good the food actually is. The only reason that I don't give Noon Hour Grill four stars is due to a few things. Granted, Susie is a great host/cook/waitress, but due to the fact that it is a one man (woman) show, it can get a little slow at times. Upon arriving at the restaurant it can take about 10 minutes for her to give you a menu, and then another 10 until she takes your order. It'll be another 10-20 minutes for the food to be prepared, so you're in for quite a wait. There's only about 7-10 tables in the entire restaurant, so seating can be scarce to come by.

2012-04-18,5.0,"Noon Hour Grill's 100th review! (Take that, Helen S! :P) This place serves some pretty tasty KBBQ for a steal. It will be a staple in my go-to places in Chicago for cheap meals. The ambiance: It's a dive with some of the kitsch-iest art pieces on the wall! Come see for yourself. This is an awesome place for take-out ... for a date? Look elsewhere! The food: I ordered the Bulgogi Rice Plate for $7 or so. I got a Styrofoam box-full of food in return. It was so much that my jaw literally hung in amazement. It wasn't all rice, either! Half of the massive box was beef. It's quite an impressive feat. How was it, you may ask? It competes with some of the trendier more-expensive places like Jinju in the city. Chicago is not known for Korean BBQ, so it's actually not a big surprise to me that this hole in the wall can produce some of the city's better dishes. The service: Susie (the darling Korean owner/chef) took my order and plated my Bulgogi up in the matter of a couple of minutes. She's really sweet and looks after you. She also seems to have a sense of humor--she looked at me and figured out I wasn't a true Asian and said, ""Chopsticks? Or would that be a waste?!?"" Haha. That's the hook that will keep me coming back for years (4.5 or so to be exact) to come! TL;DR. Great, CHEAP food. Owner is an asset to the appeal of the restaurant.

2012-04-08,3.0,"Came here for brunch with my bf on Sunday. We split the Korean pancakes, and I got the bulgogi/kimchi omelet while he ordered the bibimbap with bulgogi. I thought the Korean pancakes weren't the best, as they were underseasoned and a bit undercooked. Korean pancakes should ideally be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, but these were soft all the way through. My omelet was pretty good although the flavor combo was strange and unexpected. It did look impressive - when it arrived, the girls at the table next to me were like, ""Wow look at her omelet!"" The cheese complemented the sweetness of the bulgogi pretty well, so I have to give her props. My bf's bibimbap was also okay, but not the best I've ever had (and it wasn't served in a stone bowl to keep it warm).  Service is good, considering there was only one woman who was both cooking and serving. I think she's the owner and she seemed like a sweetie. This is about as close to homestyle Korean food as you can get, ambiance and all. Overall, 3.5 stars rounding down.

2011-04-12,3.0,"Note: My review is based upon trying the Hot Peppered Chicken and not the more traditional Korean dishes.  Also I was mistold by a friend that there would be Soon Doo Boo here so there is a possibility of bias upon the disappointment of not getting Soon Doo Boo.  It could also be possibly that for some reason I am not as big of a fan on certain types of my own ethnicity's foods... kind of sad. The first feel you get right off the bat from this place is: run down diner.  There's nothing wrong with that in my books (these type of places a lot of times are gems).  They have a breakfast menu (similar to the foods you would find at an American diner along with some fusion styles I am tempted to both pass and try on (Kimchee Omelet... Ooo & uhhh at the same time) ) which they serve all day & a menu with Korean dishes (you can see the choices of the menu in the pics section).  The place was sparsely lit, and had classical music (cool).  The only person working there was a tiny old Korean lady.  My company selected the bi bim bap and the bulgogi & kimchee fried rice.  I went with the hot peppered chicken.   When the lady served me the hot peppered chicken she warned me: be careful it's hot.  I took one bite and said... eh no it isn't, just a little spicy.  Then I realize I didn't try it with the jalapeno pepper that was on top of the whole dish sliced in half.  I took a portion of that and ate it with the rest and yeah... now I got the warning.  The vegetables (cabbage, celery, onions, carrots) were crisp and not overcooked.  The chicken was well cooked.  The spices and marinade complimented the dish overall. The dish overall felt like I dish I could get made for me at home (I realize maybe that's the reason why it gets such the great ratings compared to my subaverage rating).  Btw, yes they make Korean food, but no they will not give you banchan (extra dishes of food to compliment your meal).  The food is served in more the diner style. The Korean dishes my friends bought were very legitimate Korean dishes (What's that suppose to mean?!  I'll explain.)  The bi bim bap... it's served the way it should be in my opinion.  Not bashing Crisp, Gyu Kaku, or Del Seoul, but the large amounts of vegetables and meat they serve with the rice is exactly how bi bim bap should be served and this place does that... yeah the old Korean lady who cooks all the food herself gets it!  I tried a bite of my other friend's bulgogi and kimchee fried rice... same thing.  Generous ratio of meat to the rice and the rice has a great crispiness to it (Like the type of kimchee fried rice you make after eating a Korean BBQ).  The two dishes were made just the way I always remember them to be back home when my mom, grandma, or some other female relative made them (I'm not being sexist, just the old patriarchal mindset of my previous family generations setting into play).      If you're Korean (or Asian... ah hells every ethnicity why not), the food you eat here will definitely have the ""it was made like you are use to have it at home"" feel.  And considering the area (right by Loyola University) surrounded by students, this is great comfort food that's easy and cheap to obtain.  Check it out-",0.9934,0.881,0.098,0.021,0.4991583461341526

2009-03-18,4.0,"Susie! Can I put you in my pocket and take you home?!?! You're soOOo adorable! Thank you so much for making me such a tasty Bulgogi and Kimchee Omelet. It was definitely a nice change from the standard meat, cheese, and veggie omelet. It came with hash browns, a side of toast, and tea which was really nice since I was hanging out for a while reading my book.  Susie is such a sweetheart. The omelet was huge and I ate most of it, but it looked like I hurt her feelings when I told her I didn't want to take it home. (I thought it wouldn't make good leftovers). I felt like a bad kid that didn't 'clean' her plate! But I vehemently told her everything was great and that I will surely come back. I almost wanted to hug her. =) The place is cute as well. It's small with an open kitchen and it almost feels like you are sitting in her kitchen at home. Susie is amazing! She does everything from taking orders, to cooking the food, and clearing the table... by herself! Pretty nimble for an older lady!  Good food, great prices and amazing service! Definitely a must try.",0.9962,0.642,0.303,0.055,0.6572649572649574

2008-12-08,5.0,"Bulgogi in my omelet?  Yes sireee! This quirky diner serves up Korean and American fare for breakfast, and mostly Korean fare for lunch.  They (by ""they"" it's Susie) have a Wednesday lunch special as well.   Cool thing on their menu?  ""Anything you want"" ... ""market price"" ... If she has the ingredients, she'll make it.  I assume. ? :] There's also ""to go"" specials on a morning breakfast sandwich and coffee ($5ish). Their hours change seasonally:  in the summer they're open until 8, in the Winter until 4pm, but there's a note on the menu that you can ""call ahead"" for to go dinner?   My bulgogi omelet (I added mushrooms as well) was quite fantastic....  perfect in fact.  I'm not into really eggy omelets, and this wasn't.  Everything we had was good... As far as cleanliness goes, you'd have a hard time finding diner-ish place that's as clean as this.  I imagine Susie goes through and cleans the place every night...  And no Yelpers, they do NOT take credit cards...so ignore that at the top (unless this review swings the field to be ""no"" where it should be)!!  I trusted other yelpers and showed up with no cash, only to find I had to take a 10 minute roundtrip to the nearest ATM in 12 degree weather... Not fun Yelpers.  Reasonable prices though.

2008-05-03,5.0,"This cafe seems to be run by one woman named Susie who cooks and takes your order. I will have to try the Korean food next time I go here. I got the 2 eggs, toast and hash browns and there was some lovely hot sauce.  I hear that the bacon was a bit to fatty.   The experience we had here was sort of bizarre because there was an old very drunk man who Susie was trying to shoo out but ended up serving. In case we doubted that the Doors were playing on the radio, he announced it to everyone in the tiny restaurant. He pulled out all the groceries from his bag and put them on he table, including a bag with a carton of cracked eggs that were sort of gathering at the bottom. They argued about whether he was drunk for a while. He maintained that he wasn't, until he pulled out a bottle of gin from his bag and tried to drink it. But by the time he came up and told me I had exquisite ankles and my girlfriend had a magnificent ass, a guy who was dining there helped with his removal. Susie finally locked the door because he kept trying to come back to his table. I will definitely be back to try the Korean pancakes or omelet with garlic, ginger and carrot.
