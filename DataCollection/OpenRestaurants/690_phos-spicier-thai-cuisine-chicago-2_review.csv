2017-08-29,2.0,"Needed a quick Thai fix and didn't know what to get so I browsed Yelp. Pho's Spicier Thai Cuisine had very high ratings so I went with it. I was very disappointed with my experience.  Service - We waited for a table to clear off and no one seated us. A few moments later I just sat down on an uncleaned table and the cashier came over to clear it off. We had to get our own menu's and ask for utensils.  Food - I went with a Tom Yum Soup and a Basil Chicken fried rice. The Tom Yum soup was sub-par soup was luke warm but very flavorful so that's a plus. Basil chicken fried rice was probably one of the worst I've had. No basil flavor, very oily, and an overload of over sized carrot slices.  Interior - Very small interior, not too well lit, seems more like a take-out restaurant.  Parking - Meter parking on the streets  Overall - Had high expectations based off the reviews, didn't get what I expected. Do not recommend, I will not be back again.",-0.9126,0.841,0.048,0.111,0.49488359788359787

2017-08-20,4.0,"I had a craving for spicy basil fried rice, and since this was the nearest spot with online ordering--and the reviews were decent--I chose this place as my first Thai restaurant experience in Chicago. It's a bit of a hole in the wall, but nicely furnished and the waitress was friendly. My food wasn't ready when I arrived, but I could watch the preparation from over the counter, which is always great in my book.  I ordered the spicy basil fried rice with chicken at the ""Thai hot"" level, since so many Thai places skimp out on the heat even when you order the hottest level--this ""Thai hot"" was HOT. Almost a little too spicy for me, but once the dish cooled a bit, it was manageable. I wasn't too fond of the carrots in the dish, and I was disappointed that it lacked the usual side of cucumber and tomato, but it was good. The portions for the lunch special were also generous.  I also ordered some crab rangoon, which were crunchy and light, though I tasted more cream cheese than crab.  But the price for all of this was a bit under $12 and I had enough food left over for lunch the following day!",0.9585,0.836,0.119,0.045,0.577738095238095

Seriously though, Pho's was some of the best Thai food I've had in the city. And it's spicy. Real spicy. My dish was only a level 3 (medium hot I believe) and it was all I could handle, and I normally do pretty well with spicy food for an average guy from the Midwest. The food still had great taste though, which I feel a lot of places sacrifice for super duper XXXXX hot. Pho's strikes a great balance.  Staff was also really friendly!

We ordered the panang curry, pad see yew, and pad kee mao.  The panang curry was extremely nutty. I realize this curry should have a peanut flavor but it was very overpowering. They also serve the rice and the curry together in one container, which I though was weird. The pad see yew was quite flavorless. Usually the brown sauce in this dish is delicious, but this version tasted like cardboard. The pad kee mao was the redeeming dish. It was spicy and flavorful. I would definitely order this again.

They were all amazing! We decided to go all out and got ourselves the Extra Spicy level for the dishes we ordered! Man, they weren't kidding. It's probably one of the spiciest foods I've tried so far in Chicago! You know, sometimes when you eat spicy food, the hotness can completely overwhelm the taste of the food, but that's not the case here. It's super spicy yet you could still enjoy the food and taste the great flavor. The Pad Thai was a bit soggy, in a good way. It's just delicious. It's not dry. It was just goooood! The Panang Curry too was scrumptious! The curry was thick and so flavorful. It was peanut-y, which I really liked. Last but not least, the crab rangoons. They were crispy and hot on the outside, and soft and full of flavor on the inside. Overall it was a really satisfying visit. This probably will be another one of my go-to restaurants. Oh and they have all different levels of Spiciness. And even for Extra Spicy, you can further specify the Multiplier, from 1x to whatever number it is you desire. The record holder got the 25x Extra Spicy and I was told that he had to go to the hospital right after he finished his meal!

Now when I order, if I specify mild plus--it might as well be classified as super spicy, and if I order mild--there's no spice at all. I can't seem to strike an in between, so unfortunately I'm looking for a new Thai place to order from. It's a bummer because I loved this place for awhile! Oh well. Previous review: Best Thai I've ever had. Get the red curry with chicken--MILD PLUS if you like a little spice. I usually love tofu in my curry but they use silky tofu here instead of the firm, so I'm not as big of a fan of that (hence why I prefer the chicken). Great spring rolls, free crab Rangoon if your delivery exceeds $20, no delivery minimum on GrubHub, and just all around really delicious.",0.9688,0.757,0.168,0.076,0.5286616161616161

The rolls were a little dry for my liking. For our entrees, my date ordered the Musman curry and I went with the Pad Woon Sen noodles, both with tofu, and both which we shared.  The Musman Curry was awesome! Seriously flavorful. My Pad Woon Sen noodles were also pretty good, but nothing amazing.  The service was great. The staff were all super nice.

(That's how it was explained to me by my sister)  The pad Thai was decent, I wish it had more veggies than bean sprouts and carrots. Otherwise, it was tasty and more on the saucy side.  What draws me to panang curry is the way the curry taste is subtle and the coconut milk mellows out the spice and the spicy-ness builds as you eat the fish. The panang curry here was more curry than coconut milk-y, I guess you can indicate how spicy you'd like your dish, it was a bit spicy but for me not too bad.

I will say that one time I ordered the 1 and it was too hot for me to finish, so if you don't like any spice, go with the mild.  The ingredients in everything they make taste fresh, unlike many other stale Restaurants in the city. I typically order the chicken pad Thai which my boyfriend and I both love. Their shrimp tom yum soup is also to die for...the perfect amount of spice and acid to balance it out. I have also tried a few curries and other noodle dishes, and honestly it's all delicious. The best part about ordering takeout from here is that they give you a free order of crab Rangoon! And let me tell you....it's all about their crab rangoons. One of the best I've ever had, you can tell their homemade.",0.9825,0.788,0.179,0.032,0.6138888888888889
2016-01-26,5.0,Best Thai in the city no joke !  I'm super picky about food almost to a unhealthy ocd level so  If I say something is good it really is. The place is clean thank god because we all know Chicago restaurants have an issue with that. The food is sooo good and you can watch them prepare it the ingridenets you can taste are super fresh and the meat they use is not some cheap crap its very lean and high quality. They even make their own crab Rangoon by hand with stuffing they make not the crap you get at every other place that's already premade and frozen. Anyway we get delivery from here at least once or twice a week pad Thai and pineapple fried rice are killer,0.9772,0.7,0.238,0.061,0.5793137254901961

2016-01-03,4.0,"Can't believe I didn't find this place until two nights ago, I am in love with the concept. They offer various levels of spice and they abide by the level you order (e.g., low, medium, medium-spicy, spicy, 1X spicy, 2X through 16X). And if you order 5X or higher, you get to have your picture taken and posted on the restaurant's wall. I started with a small order of the Tom Yum Soup (vegan) and was pleased with it overall. My spouse ordered the Papaya Salad (vegan) and that was surprisingly good as well. Since this was my first time at this restaurant, I ordered my entree, Panang Curry (vegan), with 1X spice. My dish was great, but I felt there was too much peanut butter in the curry and I also didn't care for the imitation meat (I am not a vegan who eats fake meat often).  I did love the spice level, which was super hot, so I will experiment with higher levels and other dishes when I visit again.",0.9218,0.822,0.128,0.05,0.5097222222222223

With all the Thai restaurants in Chicago proper, it can be the (first) world's biggest pain in the ass/stress-inducing feat to pick which Thai restaurant to order from. Which will make your rice the perfect ratio of fluffy to sticky? Which panang curry with have just enough peanut flavor without being overly sweet, or runny? Which Drunken Noodle entrée will fill your maintenance belly without giving you wallet a coronary occlusion? Well, look no further my friend. You have arrived. The spice factor, though, is really what places Pho's above all others who try and live up to its intensity. I am the kind of gal who wants my food to be so spicy that I drip sweat and maybe even shed a tear. Pho's is the only place that can satisfy this (twisted) desire. I know I'm not the only spice junkie out there. C'mon people, raise your hands. HIGH, so I can see 'em!

There didn't seem to be any place for me to customize the order to make sure there were no eggs and no fish sauce in it. I ended up having to call to get the order just as I wanted it.  The food was good, the noodles and the sauce were tasty. The tofu was a little on the soft end of the spectrum. I prefer it to be firmer and more fried.

This place probably has only 5 different types, and I usually desire my noodles other than the typical pad thai affair. I got the basil noodle. It was okay, but dang. So much spice, i could barely enjoy the dish. Other appetizers we got included chicken satay, which was a little different than anywhere else I had it. IT came with a little fiery grill to heat your skewer, which was appreciated. It kept that nice little grilled heat. The sauce was more peanuty than creamy. I do like creamier better. Came with complimentary cucumber salad. Meh.  Shrimp shumai. Standard, but no wows here. The sauce was more sweet and sour-like than it was hoisin or soy saucey. Meh. Thai iced tea. weird after flavor. more bitter than i'd like. Thai iced coffee: it was okay. i also could have done with more sweetness or cream. Here's my one gripe. CARROTS! CARROTS EVERYWHERE! stringed carrots. flowered carrots. overdosed on carrots. If you like carrots, and spice, this is definitely your spot.

Instead of the traditional cut small piece cooked in curry sauce... this was tasteless and a plate of peanut sauce that was thick and chunky.. awful. The Tom yum soup was clear... not the traditional cloud seasoned on... this is just water with vinegar and veggies. The pad see eww... is the worst.

2015-02-07,4.0,"Eating at this place feels like you're in on a special secret club. It's kind of like Friday Night Lights-- not enough people knew about it, but the ones who did were totally obsessed. This hole-in-the-wall place could easily be passed up, but it is hands down the best Thai food in Chicago. Don't like spicy food? This place is not for you. The menu looks simple enough- familiar Thai dishes, nothing crazy- but the real fun begins when they ask if you want your dish mild, medium or hot. Allow me to define: Mild: Everyone else's medium. Noticeable spice. Nothing crazy, but there's some heat.  Medium: Eyes water, nose starts to run. Definitely enjoyable, but please get yourself some white rice on the side.  Hot: I actually haven't tried anything hot but judging from fellow diners, this is pretty scary and should only be ordered by someone who has an insane tolerance for heat or lives on the edge.  You can even order 2x, 3x, even 10x the heat and get your photo on the wall if you finish it.

I am a spice wimp but my boyfriend and other friends have been impressed that they can find Thai food that is spicy enough for them here. I also like the Pad Kee Mao, which is the great dish I have had here. Lots of veggies, thick noodles, and a sauce that was mild but full of flavor for my admittedly wimpy Irish palate. It was delicious.  What I did NOT like was the Pad Thai, which was the worst I have ever had. It was watery, flavorless, and horrible. Also it was mostly sprouts, skimpy on the chicken and carrots, and no other veggies (not even a green onion) or egg/peanuts/etc to be seen!  This Pad Thai was Sad Thai.

I love Thai food, but to me, it can really be a hit or miss. ESPECIALLY pad thai (IMHO overrated). Anyways, it's around 7, me and the boo decide to go on a lil date. I turned to yelp as my sidekick, filtered using the parameters: Cheap As Sh*t & Good As F#_k. The results gave me Pho. The Location: Great! We walked over from the cribbo on Belmont/ Sheffield so it was a mile away and built the appetite. It was pouring on the way back so we walked a block to the EL (Brown-line Paulina stop). Ambiance: The place is intimate, a.k.a small. However, they don't try to stuff 50-'leven tables in there. The exposed brick that looked like wood was cute, the colors on the tables were adorable and happened to match my outfit, and the music sounded like you were either in an elevator, or on the gandula*.  Service: Our waitress was named Koy (I believe, according to the receipt). She was a sweetheart and though her English was limited to server-speak, she knew all the right things to say, understood well enough, and always had a smile on her face. Good enough for me since a smile is universal language. I would love to add that she was very attentive. Maybe a bit too attentive. Every few minutes she came over and asked if everything was okay and I kid you not, our glasses were never more that 3inches unfull. Did that make sense?  Food: Spicy as heck. I'm Jamaican and I know spice when I have it. I had medium and my nose had a lil drip. Thankfully, our waitress was always quick on the water refill cuz I sure needed it. As far as the taste. Another smack-yo-mama restaurant. My friend had the Pad-see-ew* with imitation meat and I had green curry on noodles with shrimp. We ended up splitting it and saving most of the Pad-see-ew* for takeout. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. The coconut in my curry reminded me of Jamaica and was just scrumptious. The noodles were cooked to the perfect bite and I think it was all made to order as it took a while for the food to cool down. oh yeah, we got shrimp dumpling appetizer... bomb I would have given it 5, but 1. I am a NYer and 2. I may have seen, but ignored a lil critter on the table cuz the food was so damn good. EAT HERE. Especially if you're a broke college kid.

Maybe the pho is good if you order it spicy which they are known for but, it seems like the spiciness is masking the blandness. I ordered it mild because that's the point to taste all the flavors.  I would say skip the pho and try something else I've learned my lesson. BTW: I asked for Hoisin sauce and was giving salt and soy sauce!

Since being pregnant the whole spicy idea was not a good thing for me. They accommodated me and made a delicious Basil Chicken entree, with just luscious flavor and not spicy! It melted in my mouth. My son really enjoyed their potstickers and it's nice when a Thai place cooks their rice the correct way (not too mushy, not too dry). When I come back after the baby I'll be able to indulge in their delicious food and bring my favorite wine. Very cozy atmosphere and excellent service and food, at a reasonable price!

This restaurant has a lot of potential but, unfortunately, they take the ""spicy"" idea way too far. Trust me-- I enjoy spicy. I love jalapeños; I love hot sauce; I crave the heat. But this place takes it too far.  I started with the Tom Kha soup. I requested that the spice level be ""medium."" It was way too spicy and my mouth was quickly on fire-- not even in the enjoyable way. Since the medium was way too hot for me, I requested that my entree be served ""mild."" When my noodle dish came out, I ate a few bites and it was so hot that it was INEDIBLE. My mouth felt in flames and I honesty had a moment of concern that my throat would close up. Very uncomfortable and not enjoyable at all. And this was their ""mild"" option? I swear, I can handle spice. So I feel really bad for the poor people who come here and can't handle spicy food at all.  I am very disappointed. I love heat and spice and flavor. But this place takes it too far to the extreme and destroys any chance it has at creating good, edible food.  Again, I think this place has potential. Maybe someday they'll figure it out.

The wine glasses they gave us looked more like goblets, and it was so hipster that I was completely on board with it. 3. The menu is huge and offers options mostly under $10.

Knowing this, my boyfriend took me to Pho's.  Prior to eating here, I was exclusively loyal to my favorite place, even afraid to try my favorite dishes elsewhere, sure that no one could come close. I was very, very wrong.  The first dish I tried here was the Red Curry Noodles, 1x Hot. When I indicated my preferred spice level, the hospitable woman taking our order asked, with a skeptically raised eyebrow, ""Have you been here before?"" Based on the reviews, we knew that they were going to bring the heat, but never before had I been defeated by a bowl of curry noodles. THIS WAS THE SPICIEST FOOD I HAD EVER EATEN, but more importantly, IT STILL TASTED AMAZING. How?! So many times I have opted (settled) for less spicy fare in order to actually enjoy the flavor. There was no compromise needed here.  I have since relocated to Chicago, and I eat at Pho's as often as I can.  Lhad Nha, is my go-to, and recently, I've been asking for extra mixed vegetables to round it out (I recommend doing the same). The gravy is so, so flavorful. Depending on how I'm feeling that day, I'll order it Hot or 1x Hot.  My boyfriend goes with the peanutty Panang Noodles quite often (Hot), and they are game-changing as well.  We've also tried the Pad Thai, which was good, but there are better options, and the Pad See Ew, which was really, really good, and I will absolutely order again.  The dining area is small and modest, but that's not what keeps bringing us back. There is a wall-of-fame of people who have ordered and successfully finished dishes over 5x Hot. God knows how. There is a bathroom available for use, but it's difficult to get to through the small kitchen, so try to come on an empty bladder.  A little thing that I get to enjoy after my visit is that they come up as ""POOS"" on my bank statement.  Just go here.",0.9904,0.811,0.144,0.045,0.5865633074935399

Walking on a bitter cold menopausal Chicago winter with a friend to not only catch up but fix our spicy Thai craving, I yelped (the usual) my way to this place. When entering, I was greeted by a kind faced old Asian lady and her husband who were sitting and sipping on some tea while reading a newspaper. The space was small, most likely could only fit at max, 15 people, but it was cozy for our party of two. We were seated and looked over our menu. Now, the menu is the standard 100 different Thai and Americanized Thai food that over whelm us with too many choices. There laid just a grand handful. I quickly picked the vermicelli noodle dish with vegetables and when the lady asked me how hot, I said medium. She said to me in her sweetest old lady voice, ""Medium is weaaaally spicy, you okay?"" I said, ""Yeah I'll be okay! I grew up on Siracha, Kimchi and red pepper paste, I'll take it! "" My friend, being the ballsy one asked for hot pad see-ew (GOD, I sweat remembering that moment)! And for clarification, I'm the girl at the restaurant asking for Siracha and red pepper flake oil and sauces, using half the container for just half my food. I love it spicy. But people, it was SPICY (as everyone here kindly wrote, and I underestimated). My (what I thought was a) clever and right response got thrown down my throat when I got my food, 10 bites in, finished my glass of water and embarrassingly  had to ask for two more. Probably let my country men down. My friend, on the other hand, never touched her glass of water, even though it was way spicier than mine, as we both polished off our meal and felt weighed down by the quantity of food I had (I knew I should have doggie bagged half way through but I didn't want to carry left overs. Lazy fatty at your finest). Thai food, tastes the same to me in Chicago, mostly the noodle dishes. Same, noodles, sauces and vegetable combos. Only the curries can be distinct.

I had musmun curry with beef as my main dish, and when my food was (finally, more on that in a minute) delivered, it was a huge bowl of curry, with coconut milk and sweet potatoes. Awesome, and incredibly spicy, even though I only ordered it medium. The medium at Pho's is definitely not for the faint of heart, most people should probably order the mild, and only the brave and experienced should order their food hot. Unfortunately, not every part of the experience at Pho's was good. The service was fairly poor, though it was friendly. I waited a fair bit of time for my pot stickers, and waited an unreasonable amount of time for my main dish. Others in the dining room experienced the same kind of wait, and some were not as patient, so perhaps Pho's was having an off night. Don't get me wrong, I liked my overall experience quite a bit, and the wait was mitigated somewhat by the relatively reasonable prices, huge portions, and tasty, hotter than hell food, but in the future, I will plan my trips to Pho's accordingly, and probably consider getting takeout or delivery instead of dining in.",0.9026,0.871,0.098,0.031,0.6430555555555554

2012-03-16,5.0,"I am extremely biased when it comes to this place. I am an unabashed fan, and have been happily coming to and recommending Pho's to anyone interested in authentic Thai in Chicago for 3 full years.   Bare in mind, I like the charms of a place like this. A place that needs some patience for reward, where you won't find tablecloths, front waiters, or pretense. Pho's is like a second home. They remember when the lady and I are gone for a while. This past year, when we left Chicago potentially for good to travel, we came to visit and they remembered exactly how long it had been since we had last seen each other. They are like family.   With that being said, we didn't inherit this family. We happily chose it. We choose it almost every Monday for our low-key catching-up-over-wine time, because it is exactly that: low-key. Now, this means you must relax, too. They do a tremendous carry-out and delivery business. Sometimes this even means- wait for it- you have to wait a little longer than you might want. But, it'll be okay. Start with a papaya salad or shrimp shumai. Or a Tom Yum. Or just wait patiently. Everything is delicious and rewarding. Consider it a meditation on what's important. Certainly a couple of hours a week will be better spent chatting with someone you love, over wine or beer or simple conversation, than complaining about how long something wonderful and spicy and balanced that has been created with love takes in a restaurant run only occasionally by more than 2 people. Relax, it will be worth it.  The real prize here is the way that Poo- he's the owner and chef- balances flavor and piquancy, adjusting the profiles of every dish to match the intensity of spice desired. Whatever your preference, it's always delicious. My personal favorite is the Pad Khee Mao with tofu extra extra spicy. There is something magical about the flavor of basil peeking through blazingly hot and seeringly spicy wide noodles. Yum.  And yes, it's spicier than your average Thai spot, because it's authentic. If you are willing and able to suffer through a curry with 5 extra scoops of ground thai chiles, you get your picture on the wall. Paul, who first took us here, is forever emblazoned on the wall.

At night, it's dimly lit and the exposed brick makes it feel like you're eating in a nice loft. Like the name implies, there are a lot of spicy options on the menu. I had the Pad Cashew. It was a one-note dish, and that note is salt. Everything in it was too salty, and I just didn't enjoy it very much. The boyfriend wasn't a huge fan of his dish either (can't remember what he had). The service was very friendly and there was no corkage fee. As far as decor and service, it was a nice date night. We went in late and they didn't hassle us when it hit closing time. Maybe it was an off night, or we should have just played it safe and ordered the pad thai. But as far as the food goes, it just didn't do it for me.",0.9478,0.812,0.124,0.064,0.6673333333333333

I ordered the red curry, my friend the pad thai, and both were about as good as you can get.  I asked for the curry medium to spicy, and I'm glad I reduced my initial enthusiasm for full on spicy when I found that mine was packed with red pepper.  The curry came out in a hearty bowl, a stew of delicious vegetables and tofu which still had plenty of texture, not too soft.  My friend's pad thai came with a significant helping of crushed peanuts and plenty of chicken.   The service was excellent and I didn't really believe we paid under $20 for some of the best not just Thai, but Asian food that I've had since moving to Chicago.  Highly recommended no matter where you live.",0.9373,0.832,0.141,0.027,0.4432499999999999

One downfall of the place is the bathroom- it's in the back so you have to trek through the kitchen (which seemed very clean-reassuring) to get there.  I was underwhelmed by the cleanliness of the bathroom.

It's really quaint and cozy with soft Thai music playing in the background. The Thai lady who may have been the owner was as nice as could be. Wonderful service.  My issues lie in the prep of the food. I ordered the chicken with onions and bell pepper dish. There were 4 times I had to fish out grizzle from the chicken. The vegetables were cut so incredibly large the bell peppers were raw in the middle. Not a lot of love going on with the prep chef or maybe they have tendonitis??? Mushrooms were simply just cut in half and watery when you bit into them.  So dissapointing.

Like the crap from the ground--all over the broccoli like it hadn't even seen a sink and subsequently all over everything else. From my best guesses it was either deep in the recesses of the broccoli or all over the basil. It looked like one side of my meal had been dropped in the dirt and then placed in the box. My meal was ruined. Mf to the rescue--he called Pho's and was met with less than pleasant customer service.  The person on the phone more or less called us liars and asked us to bring the food back for proof that there was in fact dirt in it.

As I left the restaurant with my order, I noticed pictures of customers with their names and numbers like  ""Joe 6x""  ""Dave 4x"" ""Wendy 10x!!""  That all made sense after dinner.  That's how spicy those customers like their food.  A restaurant where you can customize your Scoville index?  I'm in love!",0.9738,0.858,0.106,0.036,0.5289957264957266

There was no discernable damage to the building, but a quartet of mouths and stomachs was badly burned.   I came in with three brown dudes, who asked for everything spicy.  Feeling adventurous, I asked for medium.  After the first few bites, we agreed that we had all been too ambitious by at least one notch.   Even the Indian guys were throwing out superlatives and lamentations regarding the level of heat.  For myself, I alternated between crying for my mother and contemplating religion. Actually, we started with some benign appetizers.  I tasted the spring rolls, which were totally flavorless.  I ordered the ""sweet corn cake"" which was served aside a small cucumber salad, so you got to try two dishes at once.  Corn cake = pleasant to eat but sort of bland, considering the range of ingredients listed; this dish needs a dipping sauce badly.  Cucumber salad = tangy, thumbs up.  I didn't try any of the chicken wings, but my tablemates noted that they were just plain wings and were pointless without the sweet chili sauce. But the entrees--hot damn!  (Pun intended.)  Everybody liked theirs but we were constantly groaning and laughing about the heat.  At a Thai joint for the first time, I have to order pad thai.  This version had less peanuts than I prefer (and it definitely could have used them to balance out the spiciness) but overall it was a really good dish.  I wonder how much of the flavor was masked by the heat though:  it could have been even better.  For maybe the first time in my life, I ate LESS than HALF of my food; I just couldn't stand any more because my mouth was on fire.  I would have sold my soul to the devil to piss in my mouth and stop the pain, that's how bad it was.

It's the same light brown sauce: sweet, spicy and without the ketchup or tomato base that kills all store-bought pad thai sauce. The small Tom Yum soup was full of flavor and fresh ingredients (we ordered it mild and it still came fairly spicy) and also nicely sized for its price ($2.95). The to-go order came to $12 which was enough food for two people with reasonable-sized appetites. Really one of the better Thai experiences I've had in the city, which says alot, it being Chicago. Oh, and they gave us a very tasty free crab rangoon even though your order is supposed to be over $15 to receive this. And the lady up front was all smiles and friendly as could be. The dining room wasn't upscale, but looked quaint and comfy. I think it is BYOB as well. i'll be here many times to come! One last thing: I have to agree with other Yelpers who talked about how spicy this place can be (granted, it is in the title). I am used to the standard mild, medium, spicy scale at most thai joints. For Pho's I would compensate by ordering one degree of heat below what you normally would want in a dish (i.e, if you want spicy, order medium).

2009-12-15,4.0,"My go-to delivery Thai food place.... Better than Duck Walk (just terrible), better than Thai Classic (average).... Always fantastic. I order from here at least once every two weeks. I get one of two items--either the chicken pad Thai or the fried rice. Both are great and have a different flavor than most Thai places I have tried. Somewhat importantly, I have yet to get sick from a meal here.... in stark contrast to Duck Walk.... Apparently, you can order it very very spicy, but I always request it very very mild and they are great about making sure that it is actually mild. My roommates, do however, appreciate the spice. They both put Tabasco sauce on almost everything, and they have even claimed that this can be too spicy for them before.  When ordering delivery these entrees always come with a complimentary side of crab wonton-like appetizers with dipping sauce. Typically my meal of one entree ends up costing $14.00-16.00 after tax, delivery fee, and tip.  Ordering on the phone can be somewhat challenging. The language barrier always makes giving street names (No, F as in Frank!) and credit card numbers annoyingly difficult--especially when I'm hungry. So, I suggest paying cash when you can, and making the call in an area where you have clear reception. Though, after you order from them a few times, they remember you and it gets much easier. Delivery takes about 30-45 minutes, and yes, the receipt does say ""Poo's"" Hot and & Spicy.  Good luck and enjoy! You won't be disappointed.",0.995,0.78,0.207,0.014,0.6108397337429596

If a Thai place passes the initial test, then I go back and sample their other dishes.  From the results above, I'm definitely coming back to this place.  They were a bit slow on bringing out the food, but it was worth the wait, especially with #1 to keep me preoccupied.  I did venture outside my normal protocol and tried their papaya salad. Waitress:  How spicy would you like your dishes? Me:  Medium please (I figured you can't go wrong with medium). HOLY MOTHER OF ALL THINGS GOOD... Medium was waaaaay too spicy.  My poor Caucasian companion across from me was crying his eyes out.  Now, being half Thai, I'd like to think I have the tolerance to handle ""medium"" any where in America.  I was so hungry, though, and the salad was delicious despite the spiciness, that I kept eating the salad.  It was good going in...but you have to think about the consequences in these circumstances.  This is where slower service comes in handy.  I managed to tackle the waitress down after putting the fire in my mouth out and casually asked her to change the rest of the order to ""mild.""

Not very much chicken, but it was served on a small flaming grill. I liked this, as i got to blacken my chicken a bit. The cucumber salad that came with it was very good. The peanut dipping sauce was good too. The tom yum was some of the best ive had. I got mine hot, and it was definately spicy. There was plenty of chicken in there, and the flavors were very good. The only gripe i had with the soup was the fact that they did not use straw mushrooms, which i like alot better. But overall great soup. The basil rice was good too. Plenty of basil in there, and it was ordered medium. It was slightly spicy. I was impressed that each different heat level oredered really was different. Sometimes the mild tastes the same as hot.  My pad prik was great. The sauce was definately the best ive had since Thai Cuisine in Palatine shut down years ago. No fillers like most places put in(huge amounts of cheap frozen vegetables usually). Just beef, jalapenos, onions, and some green pepper. Again, the sauce was great. I poured it all over my rice and devored it all. Both of us were VERY pleased with our expeience. Will definately be going back every time i can.

All in all it was a great value and the dish itself was tasty and basic, like a home-cooked stir-fry. I only wish they had brown rice as an option.

The decor is interesting, but not exactly my taste. Don't get me wrong, it's not that they're not trying. It's just that I'm not really getting what they're going for. One wall is brick with framed pictures on it, and the opposite is bright red with corrugated steel... Regardless, the food was still delicious.

2009-07-30,4.0,"I spent my afternoon reading all the reviews of Pho's Hot & Spicy.... and drooling. One MAJOR common theme in the Yelp reviews , if you haven't noticed, is that their food will melt your face off apparently. Bring it on!!      I had an evening of laundry and packing to do so it was a perfect time to order some good take out. I printed out the menu (mid day mind you), circled all the items I wanted to try and headed home after work, ready and anxious to try something new! I ended up running into a friend on the train and mentioned my PLAN of domesticity and dumplings. She said she was starving and we wanted to catch up anyway, so she came over and we sat out on my porch, drinking wine & salivating over the menu. We ordered different things so we could try everything. OMG. I am sooooo happy to have found this place (only thru Yelp!). I feel a wee bit guilty because I have been a very loyal Pennys Noodles customer for years and years and now know this will be my go-to Thai place. People are not kidding when they talk about the Sweet Corn Cakes being heavenly. They are very unusual for a Thai place. A nice change from the more common pot stickers and chicken satay. They are sort of like little corn pancakes, and stuffed with big juicy pieces of sweet sweet corn and green onions and spicy goodness. Just wonderful. I also had the Tom Yum soup which is the best I've ever had. It was loaded with huge shrimp and had the perfect blend of veggies and spice. I asked for the ""medium"" spice for everything and it was undoubtedly hot, but not too much for me. I'd like to try the next level of heat for kicks. Not for everybody though~    If you're not sure, I would definitely go with the ""mild"" version because even the medium was up there , heat wise. I chose the Red Curry Pork for my entree. There were so many veggies and lots of pork, basil and jalenpenos. I could only finish about half. I would absolutely order this again. One thing to beware of! You'll end up drinking twice as much wine just to cool down your mouth, which is not a great thing when you still have laundry and packing to do!!   So watch out. I can't wait to get back home from my weekend getaway so I can eat here agin next week. It is a fabulous new find! Thanks, Yelpers!",0.9873,0.838,0.124,0.039,0.584683372183372

Boy, was I wrong, and thankfully so. I am addicted to extremely spicy food.  I like sauces that are so hot they could burn the paint off of your car.  I haven't found anything in a Chicago restaurant that I can't tolerate yet, but Pho's is one of the few places I've found that actually satisfies my craving for true heat. After reading on Yelp a while back that someone had ordered ""triple-hot"" for the first time, I figured I had to belly-up and order ""quadruple-hot.""  It was daaaaamn tasty.   The owner has told me several times since that if I order anything 5x hot or above (which apparently others have done since, as evidenced by their photo's hanging on the wall) and finished my meal in front of him, that I could eat for free.  The only reason I haven't done so (as of yet) is not due to the heat, it's because the portions are too much for me to eat in one sitting (plus, I love leftover Thai). The Pad Khee Mao is the best I've had, but last time I decided to try the Red Curry (5x hot, of course).  TO.  DIE.  FOR. On top of the excellent food and the fact that they will actually serve legitimately spicy food to non-natives, the couple that runs Pho's are some of the nicest, most cheerful proprieter's in the city.  You can tell that they truly love what they do, and so do their loyal customers.

Yes, we sat for awhile before anyone came over to give us water or menus, but there was a big 8 person party seated just before we got there and numerous take-out orders. Still, there were two other empty tables that still had dirty plates and dishes on them that remained that way throughout our meal.  We weren't in a hurry though, and once the service eventually came, it was friendly and efficient.  The ambiance is cluttered and a bit crowded, with two glass cases of ""gifts for sale"" up by the door. Very weird.  We ordered the spring rolls and the Tom Kha Soup to start. Both were good, but the soup was unlike any others I've tried in Chicago. It was amazingly fresh and the ""medium spicy"" we ordered was perfect for two spicy food lovers. We shared the duck curry and pad thai with tofu for our entrees. The smoked duck curry was phenomenal. The pad thai was also very good, but I couldn't keep my chopsticks away from that curry. Again, we ordered medium spicy and I'm glad we did. Just enough to make you sweat, but not kill the tastebuds entirely. It also went really well with the Hitachino Nest White Ale we brought along.

I ordered the rice soup with shrimp made to a mild degree of spiciness.  The portion was huge, but just because I wanted it mild did not mean I did not expect flavor.  My expectations were not met--I found the soup kind of bland, the shrimp overcooked, and it just did not impress me much.  I tasted the corn cakes appetizer and those also did not work for me.  However, I really liked the cucumber salad that came with it.

After a crash course on navigating the CTA (Chicago's public transit) system, I clawed my way here after taking 3 segments of the rail system. Gotta echo Sally H's review that the lunch specials rock - in terms of price, for sure.  For $6.50, you get a small bowl of consomme-like soup, a piping hot eggroll with a small side dish of dipping sauce, and your choice of meat (pork, chicken, or beef) on the lunch special.  The soup was nothing special but I was ravenous and wolfed it down; hours later, I have regained perspective. I chose the Massaman Curry with chicken as my lunch entree:  laden with bits of onion, carrots, peanuts,and chunks of sweet potato, it was surrounded by a freshly-made sauce for the large scoop of rice to sop up.  Delicious if not a bit wimpy on the spice level - but this is no fault of Pho's.  I asked for it mild.  Sally said her ""medium spicy"" kicked her mouth and I didn't want that taste ambush after my long trek from Houston.  The listing's photos are right on in terms of what you're getting. Service was unobtrusive and timely by the wife of the husband-and-wife owner team.  Decor was a fascinating blend of painted tin ceiling, weathered wood floors, and exposed brick walls, which harkens to the building's past life when it was not a Thai restaurant.

Mommy Pho was awesome as usual.  A trip to Pho's like visiting home and having the best home-cooked meal you could ever ask for.  The food is fresh, served hot and will satisfy your Thai food craving. Do yourself a favor and visit this gem of a mom & pop eatery.  We do not want to see them close and only be left with shit chain Thai like Penny's.  Two entrees, Pad Khee Mao and Pad Thai, with plenty of leftovers for lunch, under $20.  You cannot beat it taste and pricewise, and you will be treated like family.

The place is tiny and probably wasn't meant to be a sit down restaurant. The food was pretty good - the Pad Thai was interesting because it was savory instead of the usual sweetish kind at other places. The Pad Phed was spicy (I ordered it Thai spicy) and tasty. The spring rolls were okay but the rice wrap they come in was dry and thus not the best. It is BYOB which we didn't know so had to settle for water.  So.. not spectacular food but for the price we paid it was good, fast and tasty.  Decent place at a decent price with friendly service.",0.8792,0.842,0.125,0.032,0.5974867724867724

2009-01-25,5.0,"One of my very favorite restaurants in the city, my wife and I love everything about this place.  The couple that runs it are really nice, and it's clear that the husband is an actual chef, and not just some guy who immigrated here and didn't have anything else to do.  We haven't loved everything we've ordered, but the pad thai is hands down the best we've had anywhere (I like that the noodles aren't all stuck together like in a lot of pad thai's I've had).  And the soups are phenomenal.  We usually mix it up between eating in and taking out, depending on mood.  But there's always street parking available right by the restaurant, which is a big plus. Let me give a brief example of what separates this place from your typical take-out asian restaurant:  One freezing night I ordered take out, including the tom yum soup with shrimp.  It took me longer to get their than I thought, so my food was definitely already ready.  I walked in (they knew who I was), and at that point, they told me to wait a couple minutes longer as they put the shrimp in my soup (that had been sauteeing separately) and took all the other food off the heat and packaged it.   That's sort of a roundabout way of saying that they took the care to make sure my food was still simmering until I got there, and that the shrimp weren't soaking in the soup and thus ruining their firmness--whereas a typical take-out restaurant would have packaged up my food the instant it was ready and had it wating in a bag for me when I arrived, getting cold and losing its texture the whole time. This place is a real gem.  I went from not even being a huge fan of thai food to having this be one of my top 2-3 favorite restaurants in the city.",0.9891,0.823,0.142,0.035,0.5214422550629447

The odor was very strong but I ate anyways. The noodles were great. They were perfect because I always tend to get overcooked noodles which really pisses me off and these were just right.  There were peas, carrots, EXTRA FRESH MUSHROOMS, broccoli and tofu mixed in with the noodles. The veggies were all fresh and the tofu was OK. I was more into the noodles then the tofu really. There was a great flavor to everything and I was surprised the coconut milk didn't overpower the dish. It was all yummers!!  Later when the bill arrived I was excited. Not expensive at all!

So many places, Chinese, Thai, Indian, Mexican, I say give me what you got. I think I get scoffed at and given half the heat or they are worried about a lawsuit. I have found some places, that can give it to me good, I have found another. I have seen the popularity of this place on here. I have heard the intensity of ten cities of the heat here. I even came to do some investigative work for a possible upcoming Sunday dinner. (Note to all... they are closed on Sunday). When I came in, the place is tiny small. Maybe about 9 small four tops. The menu, concise, but with some good favorites and choices. The staff, a single couple. The husband in the back cooking, the wife in front helping customers out. Super nice, super friendly and just so adorable you want to give them a great big hug.  I got some Tom Yum soup with chicken, (hot), shu mai and basil noodles with chicken, (hot). When I said hot, (not the hottest they have), she looked at me and asked if I have been here before, *sigh*, no... but I have heard you can make it really spicy. Off she went, asked to sit down and they would start right away. Freshness... you gotta love it. (Kinda like ""I shall serve no fries before their time..."" Fast Times at Ridgemont High? Anyone? Bah.. it was Sean Penn's finest work) I left after paying just over $20, plus I got a free order of crab rangoon because I'm cool like that... or maybe I just spent over $15 on my order. I got home, poured my soup out and started to munch on my shu mai. My shrimp dumplings were good, the crab rangoon, wasn't bad, the soup was pretty damn good and had some great heat to it. Certainly flavorful and yet made me break out in a sweat. Seeds of peppers floating, tasty lemongrass filled broth, oh... it was good. Real good. By this time I had put aside my basil noodles, but... I wanted to try them a little before I did and my ever filling stomach. Really, really good. Fragrant basil, some really good heat. When I actually ate it hours later, I was happy with the portion size, but also how fresh the veggies seemed and how well balanced the flavor and the growing heat in my mouth.  I was happy to have finally met this place and I look forward to going back and giving it the X-tra hot challenge.

To those people shocked by the heat of the food, the place is called Pho's Hot and Spicy...it's pretty obvious what you're getting into.

It was all there, the great reviews, the amazing service, the awesome prices. I even found parking a block away! It seemed like the planets were finally aligning to bring me a great Thai food experience. Boy, was I wrong. I went in for take out and took my little brown bag home waiting for my heavenly delight. I ordered the lunch special which they graciously gave me even though it was about 15 minutes after it was over. It included pad thai tofu( that I ordered medium based on other reviews), soup and an egg roll.  I also got the dumplings just because they were vegetarian.  So, I get home and unpack my little bag and start to get really excited. I took a moment to take in my spread of containers and then I start to dig in. I put the soup aside because I just cant roll with soup, any soup, no offense. Then, I open my sweet container filled with Pad Thai, my favorite. I plunge my fork in and take a big bite...of gross, bland, gooey noodles. They were way over cooked. Like, I stuck my fork in them and picked up about half of the container because they had sort of congealed. Really gross. So I dumped some hot sauce I had from some other take out and stirred. It tasted weird and then it hit me...the heat. It was sort of a heat in the back of your mouth. I wasn't expecting it and it threw me off. I was turned off and decided to eat my egg roll.One word...disgusting. I have no idea what was inside of that bad boy but it was horrendous. It was not sweet or savory or any pleasant adjective. It was odd and when I squeezed it some dark stuff oozed out. Omg. By this time I was starving, and I think dumplings. Yes, the dumplings. I take a bite into them and they're good. Yes, thank you God, they're good. Then I dunked it in the sauce..holy hell. It tasted like zoo. Yes my friends, zoo. Do you remember what it smelled like when you went to the zoo?

She served a cup of a pleasant enough veggie soup and a fried egg roll. The Pad Thai was amazing. Full of flavor and spice but not to the point where you don't enjoy the flavors.

2008-06-28,3.0,"Searching to fill the void that I was left with when I moved out of Siam Noodle's delivery area, I decided to order from Pho's, given all the good reviews on Yelp for them, and because I'm a fan of all things ridiculously spicy. I ordered the pad thai (medium spicy), a cucumber salad, and the veggie egg rolls. The veggie egg rolls were very good, and they had sweetcorn in them, which I thought was sort of unusual, but they were tasty, and perfectly fried and crispy. They were small, but the perfect amount for one person. The cucumber salad was good, it had lettuce in it, though, which got very soggy in the dressing, but overall the taste was good and the cucumber was very fresh. The pad thai had a very strong roasted garlic smell (yum!) and the tofu was cooked well, but the flavor was lacking. I didn't taste even a hint of tamarind, and although I could tell it was probably spicy by most people's tastes, it wasn't spicy enough for me (in the future, I'd probably order the hot, rather than the medium). The portion size was big, I barely finished half. I also noticed barely any peanuts or beansprouts, and there was no cabbage (which I really like with my pad thai). Just noodles and tofu. The delivery guy was friendly, and the food arrived after about an hour, but it just wasn't anything special. I'm not sure I'd be compelled to order again, as I'm sure there's better Thai food to be found within delivery distance to my apartment.",0.99,0.794,0.164,0.042,0.5312216553287982
2008-06-26,5.0,"3 ways I was able to tell that I absolutely fell in love with Pho's Hot & Spicy: 1. With just the first bite of the pad khe mao (#23, ordered medium), I INSTANTLY knew that Pho's Hot & Spicy was now my favorite Thai restaurant. It completely blew me away with its delicious spiciness and the noodles were so very tender.  Best pad khe mao EVER.  And I do not say these kinds of things lightly. 2. I was honestly tempted to go give the lady who gave us our food a big hug and shower her with praise in regards to the yumminess.   3. I couldn't stop talking to myself throughout the meal in short fragmented sentence such as ""wow, so good"" and ""omg, amazing.""   3 ways I was able to tell my FPIC (Food Partner in Crime) fell in love with Pho's as well: 1. He completely agreed that I should go give the lady a hug too when I told him about it and did not think it would be weird at all. 2. He kept shaking his head throughout the meal in disbelief at how good everything was (FYI, we also had the #29 basil chicken ordered spicy which was delicious as well, especially as leftovers! and the spring rolls which were deliciously unique and refreshing).   3. On the way back when we were in the car and Chris Brown's With You came on the radio, he said ""You know...now every time I hear a love song, I'm going to be thinking of Pho's"" And I fully concur.",0.9957,0.775,0.214,0.012,0.675

You see, ordering any dish ""spicy"" here will net you a fair warning from the proprietor of the establishment that ""spicy"" is REALLY SPICY and you are well advised to keep that in mind.  But hey, you're here for heat and HEAT is what you will be served - and look, if you're not into spicy foods, perhaps you completely missed the name of the place - Pho's [STRONG]HOT & SPICY[/STRONG] Thai Cuisine.  *hint hint* The food is hot!  Whoo!  My crew and I can put away some spicy food and it was refreshing to see and hear the entire table trying to get through the meal.  I had the Tom Yum (SPICY) and we shared the Pad Thai (Medium), Green Curry (SPICY) and Basil Fried Rice (Medium). The spice level can be calculated as such: Your ""normal"" place's Spicy = Pho's Mild Your ""normal"" place's EXTRA Spicy (as applicable) = Pho's Medium Your ""normal"" place can't even touch Pho's SPICY.  You know what I'm sayin'?! Outside of the extra punch for spice, the food is excellent and very VERY tasty (but then again, I'm seriously biased towards spicy foods so buyer beware).  My friends (who aren't Thai) all commented that the food tasted very ""authentic"" which I found puzzling as none of them have ever visited Thailand or know much about the country to my knowledge.
