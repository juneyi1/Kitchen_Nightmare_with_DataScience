Having worked for two decades in restaurants, I can tell you that if the bathroom (especially for woman) is totally nasty (floor to ceiling) the kitchen cooler is generally going to be really dirty too.

The Mozart was tasty and split between the 3 of us, and it was also just the right amount of sweetness with the nuttiness balancing out the chocolate. Our server, Xavier, was the best.

2016-10-29,1.0,"TERRIBLE time.  My daughter and her friends went for a quick brunch.  They were all aware that large parties are hard for servers and knew it would take a bit longer for food to come and that they should give a large tip.  However, when even one girl's yogurt parfait and water hadn't come, they began to get a bit worried.  When all of their meals came (each spaced 10-15 minutes apart and cold, mind you) and they asked for individualized checks, they were told by their waiter that he would try but it probably wouldn't happen.  A different man (identified as Christopher) came back with their check, the waiter nowhere to be found. Christopher told them that if anyone had a credit card they had to give it to him and he would split the bill evenly and then they could work out who owed who money on their own time.  This would have been fine had he not said it in such a patronizing, rude, and condescending tone, and if the girls, many of whom came here frequently with their parents, hadn't seen individualized checks often given to adults with no complaint. The girls didn't know what else they could do, so everyone that had a credit card (most of which were for emergencies only) gave it to Christopher.  He came back with individual checks (which obviously could have been given from the beginning but had been withheld because the extra effort just wasn't worth it for mere children) and slammed them down on the table, rudely rolling his eyes and snorting when the girls said thank you.  My daughter tipped 20%, as she had been taught that that was the appropriate amount, even for service as awful as this.  However, when the checks had been taken away she and the others realized that $5 (about 35% of the meal cost) had been added without being listed as a service charge, so she and others had in fact tipped 20% on the cost of 135% of their meal for terrible service.  Another mom who was in the area heard what happened and went in after the girls left to see if she could clarify the story.  She was met with an inexpressibly rude Christopher, who rolled his eyes, snorted, and generally gave the impression that he couldn't care less about his job.  Would NOT recommend to anyone, and would give 0/5 stars if possible.",-0.9428,0.866,0.05,0.084,0.5001283846872082

Although I have never felt real welcome by the staff here, this last visit really left me feeling like their staff really doesn't care much.  I ordered a spinach and cheese croissant (great, BTW) and asked if it could be warmed up. The girl at the counter said, ""it's still warm."" Which I took as a ""no."" I didn't press the issue, but found out when I got to the car that it was not warm at all. I put it in the oven when I got home and it was very tasty though! Anyway, I felt it was lazy and showed a lack of service to tell me it was still warm when it surely was not.  Anyway, speaking of warm, or cold, whatever, I also ordered an apple strudel which I noticed was actually frozen in the center! Really? I know it's early, but at least defrost your frozen pastries before offering them for sale! I had always assumed that their pastries were at least fresh baked, if not even on premise! I guess you have no way to know when or where your Julius Meinl pastry was baked, which I found very disappointing. But they should at least fully defrost these things before selling them in a cafe. And didn't this lazy counter worker realize that it was cold as an ice cube?? Maybe my request to warm the other item might have triggered the thought to warm this up too? No, cold croissant and frozen strudel were served instead.  On top of this, the atmosphere here feels quite stuffy to me. Lots of self-important types that wear admiral's caps and crap like that. Pretty much every time I walk by there are people with snooty looks on their faces and weird outfits on. I don't think I'll be back, it's just not my type of place.

Whatever your taste buds linger for, this quaint spot in the heart of Wrigleyville is sure to please.

No worries, these guys are on the ball and they will help make your wait that much smoother, or grab your items to-go like some busy locals choose to do.

As soon as we walked in, I found this place to be just like a mini bistro out of a movie, with classic decor and all the smells of a a coffee connoisseurs dream come true. Not only do they have their own amazing blend, but it is available for purchase. I ordered a simple breakfast of eggs and bacon with their french press while my guest had french toast. All the items were on par and perfect treat on the rainy day. Our server, even though he had quite a few tables and was super busy making sure everyone was happy, was still very much attentive to our needs, often looking at our table to see if we needed water, condiments or anything else. While our stop was quick, since we had other plans for the day, it was quite easy to get in, sit down to eat and leave.

The Meinl Baked Eggs with avocado, cilantro, etc. were incredible and perfectly seasoned. I seriously add hot sauce to EVERYTHING, but the herbs and onions added a freshness and crunch that didn't deserve to be drowned in bottled spice & saltiness. The baked eggs are served with two slices of toast (choice of Ciabatta, sourdough, pumpernickel) and butter & jam. I basically licked the plate clean. My sis got the Austrian Breakfast, which may be authentic but didn't warrant the price tag. A soft-boiled egg (served in the shell) with slices of toast, salmon, and Swiss cheese...didn't quite satiate. My friend's Brioche Sandwich was a bit dry and small - could have used a side of sauce.

I thought this was a bit steep, but I did get a lot of fruit. A good variety too with banana, strawberries, apples, blueberries, and pineapple.  The quiche itself was delish. The perfect veggie to cheese and egg ratio. I also thought the crust was the perfect density - not super crispy or mushy, just right. My favorite part of this breakfast experience were the beverages. So cute! I ordered the blue sky iced green tea which was phenomenal. I so appreciated that it was unsweetened. My tea was served on a silver platter with a straw, sugar, spoon, and cookie.

The staff all have really poor attitudes. It's a seat yourself joint but none of the staff greet you upon arrival and it isn't uncommon for them to not even realize you've arrived which brings me to my next point. The wait time to even get a menu can be upwards of 10 minutes. Today I decided to ask for one and was given MAJOR ATTITUDE by the staff. We arrived at 11:15 and did not get served lunch until after 12. We had a toddler in tow. This neighborhood is full of kids.

One of the staff was even on their cell phone while we sat waiting for 15 minutes for a cup of coffee. This is so infuriating!!!! Third, I ordered a kids OJ and they brought out something that was about 12 oz for a 3 year old. When I asked if there was something smaller the staff were furious with me. An older blond with curly hair who I am convinced escaped from a mental hospital was especially rude and called me her ""lovely"" in a very sarcastic tone. Yikes!!!!

Beneath the eggs, there was some kind of creamy egg white mixture. What it was, I couldn't tell you. But it tasted magical. The veggies on top were delicious and sautéed to perfection. The toast comes dry, thin, and a long piece. I put butter and fresh blueberry preserves (I think made in house) on top. LOVED everything about this dish. The service this time was slow.

Didn't catch his name. Nice man, but we were in the back and he rarely came around.  I came here a few days ago, too. We sat right by the counter at a two top booth. We ordered everything at once. Our server was super kind. We had a man, maybe mid to late thirties, as our server. Our coffee came right to us - I ordered an iced coffee.

So I try to be understanding. after a bit, our server returned and said he would get me another cold brew and a coffee for my brother, both free of charge, since the food was taking so long to come out. Although hangry, we were extremely understanding. Things happen. It was nice that he acknowledged, apologized, and offered us more beverages.

Ok great~ thanks for letting me so soon.  Sat down- no one comes by~ so now I'm confused if we order up at the counter...nope finally see a waiter who passes the table about three times before coming over with a menu. Mind you it's not busy and there are many empty tables.  Again the food and drinks are great but the servers were all slow, borderline rude- the bus boys were sweet (sorry I had to ask them to get our waiters twice)!

We sat and we sat and we sat. I went up and got my own coffee and was almost not served because I was told to wait for our waiter. Needless to say I didn't wait. I paid for a to go coffee ( I'm fairly certain it was decaf, I didn't order that ). I went back to my table and waited with my coffee. I started to look around while we waited. The place was dirty. The seats we severely stained and they are all ripped on the seat. The menus were disgusting. There were at least 6-7 staff all behind the counter talking to each other. They never came to us. We got up and left. This is basic stuff people. CLEAN STUFF, FIX YOUR SEATS, GREET YOUR CUSTOMERS and ACT LIKE YOU CARE AT ALL! I'd like to point out that they were not that busy. Anyone at anytime (including the person that sat us) could have offered us coffee or water or even a hello would have been nice. It's a very sad state of affairs there.

We ordered Café au lait, regular coffee, and a Vienna torte.  The first warning sign that things were not going to go well was that everything came out hyper-fast. The cafe au lait had virtually no milk in it, the regular coffee was beyond bitter and tasted as if it had been made earlier in the day, and the Vienna torte was uninspired. Their once awesome selection of pastries has been reduced to a case full of dull-looking cakes that look they came out of Costco and were slapped on a plate. Food & beverage? Poor. We counted at least 7 employees on staff who mostly stood behind the counter and chatted each other up for a floor that was virtually empty (8 tables total).  You had to work to get their attention. Service? Poor. When the table next to us got up to leave, we noticed huge gaping gashes in the chairs. After noticing this, we started looking more closely at other tables around us. Sure enough, same. This is something that the Julius Meinl of old would have never let happen. You used to walk into Julius Meinl and be reminded of the best European cafes. Not anymore.

I mean, yes, it was Sunday brunch, I'm always aware of the wait that is involved. It was just two of us, and we had to wait about a half hour before we could even get a table - that is acceptable.  But once we were seated, it became abundantly clear we were barely going to be able to order let alone be served. It took about 20 minutes for our server to stop by, after we had been seated. My hungry, pregnant friend was not pleased. We wanted to share a baked egg dish, understanding that it would probably be a 30 minute wait. So we asked the server to put that order in, but that in the mean time we wanted to also order some tea and pastries to nibble on while we waited. In about 10 minutes, our teas came out, but no pastries to be seen. We kept trying to make eye contact with a server, ANY server, to no avail. Another 10 minutes passed. We finally made eye contact with our original server and asked him about our pastries. He made an ""Oh crap"" facial expression, meaning he totally forgot about it and basically ran away to go get them. Another 10 minutes passed, and a server different from the original one came to our table with our egg dish. At this point, my politeness went out the window and I informed her that we had ordered pastries a half hour ago and that we were overall displeased. At that moment, our pastries suddenly appeared from a busboy. The server who brought our eggs was apologetic and said that she would comp the pastries, so that made it more forgivable. At this point, we were starved, so we just gobbled down our food. Which was all delicious. The monkey bread was eh, but the baked egg with feta, spinach, and mushroom was delish.  In the end, it was great food, awful service, but nice that they comp'ed the pastries due to their mistake. What it comes down to is not having enough servers.

It's been years since I've dropped by and was super excited to sit and have a dessert nosh and a cup...like the good old days. A true coffee house experience. Hmmm...not what I remember. I still give the vibe of this place a solid 5 stars, but what about the price of the desserts and the service? Not so much. Excited to check out the specialty desserts, I wanted to first see if they had anything that would make it worth my while to sit. Whoa! What happened to the cakes and the torte? Everything's about half the size and double the price and looks like it belongs in a museum. Pass! Sure, it's special upscale and chocolaty rich (I'm sure), but that's okay. For $6 and a couple of bites, I passed and ended up with just a large vanilla latte instead.

Mind you, the restaurant was empty so I didn't think it would be a big deal. Nope, that was not an option in my favor. If I wanted to park myself there I'd have to be served my to-go cup and tip somebody just to bring it to me. So, I moved to the front where the cold wind blowed every time the door opened and felt banished to this most uncomfortable seating option ever. Definitely a pay to stay kind of place.

2014-02-27,5.0,"My best friend and I, along with our significant others, awoke this past Sunday morning in hot pursuit of a perfect little Sunday brunch.  We wove through the streets down Southport Avenue and were dropped off to snag a reservation while the boys looked for parking.  They found it quite quickly - where I'm note sure...- and we didn't stand there for more than 20-25 minutes before being brought to our window table.   Apparently this place has a reputation for having the best coffee and is an ideal place for a first or second date.  We all sat down and mulled over the menus whilst ordering water, lattes and coffee. Our plan was to chat while we greatly sipped our hot drinks in effort to warm up from the frigid Chicago weather, order our brunch and finish with a pastry as dessert. Our coffee and lattes were very well presented: each had it's own plate, two packets of sugars and a tiny cookie wrapped separately in  Julius Meinl packaging, a tiny bowl for my whipped cream and pumpkin spice since I did not specify if I wanted it on top of my pumpkin spice latte, and a small glass of water for our spoons to sit in.  The glass of water was brilliant, much nicer to clean it off each time we stirred it - a bit unnecessary, maybe, but very thoughtful.  Shortly after, our food came.  My friend had a colorful ham & brie crepe, her fiance the chicken salad with fruit (on the side) with a croissant ordered separately in order to avoid an extra cost for having this as a sandwich, my love enjoyed the stuffed french toast (brioche, topfen cheese, streusel, cranberry-orange compote, brown sugar, walnuts, whipped cream) and I had the baked banana french toast (brioche, cinnamon-scented vanilla custard, bananas in a sweet sauce). I sampled their plates - except the chicken salad because, well, it's chicken salad - and they were all spectacular.  Their meals were exploding with flavor and I specifically said,""The next time I visit you in Chicago and we come here, I'm ordering this."" This is in reference to the ham & brie crepe but oh my brunch, that stuffed french toast was amazing. We were left satisfied and full but we had one last round to go: the pastry.  Pastry of choice was the side of monkey bread which sounds odd or sounds like there would obviously be banana in it. No. It was a fluffy, flaky lightly sweet pastry that was delightful.  It was perfect to share as we all had enough room for about 1/4 of the monkey bread. Over all the service was on point, the decor very European and noise level was wonderful.  Seriously looking forward to coming back here and wish that there was a location here in New York City.",0.9973,0.812,0.167,0.021,0.5217365967365966

It's not so Old World inside like some of the Viennese coffee houses I've been to, or even compared to some New Yorker coffee houses... but they brought in the Old World traditions which is what I really swoon over. Coffee served in a silver tray - just like in Vienna. I feel spoiled - but it MUST be this way, to enjoy the quintessential coffee that is looked upon in a similar fashion as high tea among the Brits. But good coffee is my vice. Not tea. And they've got a wide assortment of coffee styles, in whole beans and grounded. And couple that with authentic Austrian menu items that were filling, tasty, and affordable, and with delectable sweets - and this place hits a home-run to the nearby Wrigley Park. The simple Austrian breakfast ($7.50) was just that - simple, but in every good way. Plenty of bread to eat with the cheese and black forest ham - or to dip in the runny yolk of the soft-boiled egg. Or to smother in real butter and delicious homemade (YES, homemade!) peach preserves. You could go any way you want with your breakfast with this simple plate - and that's how I like it. With specialty Viennese coffee (Franziskaner, $2.70), of course.

In a world of the big coffeehouse chains, Julius Meinl turns that world on it's ear and offers visitors a taste of old world Europe with outstanding coffees and food along with a wonderful interior, relaxing music on a bright and cheery corner of Southport.  Here are the standouts that I've enjoyed in my trips to JM. I'm sure anything you order will be amazing so go with an open mind and empty stomach as you'll want to keep eating. The baked egg on a brioche bun with bacon (amazing take on a simple egg sandwich), was quite filling and reasonably priced. Enjoy as a breakfast treat or mid morning snack! Baked Banana French Toast (Brioche soaked in cinnamon-scented vanilla custard, topped with caramelized banana sauce) was so amazing that I nearly cried while eating it.  It is super dense so go hungry as if you can actually finish this thing, you'll be stuffed. Pair it with a side of housemade sausage for real treat. My wife had the croque mademoiselle which was paired with a spring mix salad. And while she had it for breakfast and it was delicious, it could also serve as a light lunch. For coffee she had a filter coffee which was quite bold and not that watered down stuff you usually get and I had the French Press of the Day which consisted of blend of earthy coffees which were so dark, the coffee laughed when I poured cream in it. Just like I like it. There are a number of places to sit depending on your mood. You can get a stool at the high counter, a small table for a few friends or even a small booth like seat if you intend on being in there a long time.  The place is on a corner so it gets a lot of natural light and with classical music playing in the background, it's a nice change of pace from that singer-songwriter coffeehouse guitar music you seem to hear every where you go. Not that I'm a hater of singer-songwriters but this is a nice change of pace. And if this review wasn't enough, Chicagoist recently names it one of the best brunch places in Chicago.

2013-10-04,5.0,"Julius Meinl (pronounced You-lee-us Mine-el, for proper Deutsch speakers) is my favorite authentic Viennese Kaffeehaus in the city. Well, this may be the ONLY Viennese Kaffeehaus in Chicago. It feels like a bit of old Wien in the place, with the warm wood paneling on the walls, marble countertops and early 1900's style decor. The newspapers on spindles for public reading and coat hooks on the walls add to the authenticity. There's quite a difference between the to go service, which for all intents and purposes, is like other coffee shops. They do a brisk takeout business with plenty of different types of imported coffees and teas available in various sizes. My mother-in-law wanted a real breakfast tea and loved my choice from this establishment. The table service, however, is quite special. The uniformed waitstaff take your order and deliver your handcrafted beverages on little stainless platters with paper doilies, a short glass of water and a packaged sweet biscuit cookie. The coffee is absolutely delicious: rich, dense, carmelly sweet and smoky. They have many of the standard kinds of coffee we've come to love or you can order with ""schlag"" with real whipped cream. The types with Schlag are myriad, so it's best to look at the menu or ask because I've never heard of them before. In addition to amazing fancy pastries which you really don't find in other coffee shops like Linzer Torts, they have a full sandwich and breakfast menu. Food is very good and made on premises. Weekend evenings might bring some live jazz music or an ensemble for entertainment.  It's such a gem of a place, I'll often stop by on a late evening for an Amerikaner mit Eis to go to keep me alert on my drive back to the northern burbs.

The best part of the decor is they have tons of coat hooks along the walls so you can ditch the purse, the coats, the winter accessories elsewhere. So smart! More places should think to do this. I love my espresso and this place has one of the better espressos in the city. A creamy start with notes of cloves and vanilla. Try any one of their pastries! I had the lemon cheesecake and loved it.

We Americans and other people who have lived here for a while have been spoiled by the rampant availability of good coffee at Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks and other chains I have failed to mention.  What is lost is the originality of a coffee shop that has that vibe like I just stepped into a cafe in Venice or Vienna ( I have been to Venice and not Venice Beach). I think this place provides that old world feel as you are ingesting your caffeine. If you are looking for quiet time come here before 7pm on Saturday.  When I come here, I have hot chocholate. I know that sometimes I am given to hyperbole. However if you spend a few hours here with people you know or just by yourself with your drink a book or a newspaper; you will discover one thing: no other coffee shop besides for a certain coffee shop on Sunnyside near wrigleyville can come close on delivering a certain coffee house  vibe that you have been craving :) I apologize in advance if you have a diet that precludes you from eating house made Topfenstrudel .

This is a refined version and not the shortbread/berry/whipped cream heap from the recipe maagzines. I had the key lime tart. It was just okay. Choose something else.

You can sit around as long as you want sipping on your tea or coffee, which by the way is delicious. I know it's kind of an international chain, but it's not Starbucks. I'd much rather support Julius than Starbucks. Not to say Starbucks is bad, but the service is more about the coffee/tea drinking experience.  If you sit inside, your drink is brought to you on a silver platter - that's right folks! Only the best at Julius! I'm a tea drinker, so here's the skinny: the silver platter has an individual tea pot, a decent sized cup and saucer, a spoon, a small glass of water, a packet of sugar and a cookie. Yay! The pot allows for about 3 cups of tea. I always ask for extra sugar and sub regular cream for soy milk. But anyway you pour it, it's lovely. I wind up coming in about twice a month. One of the visits is for a German conversation group. We overtake the SoPo-Addison location so be warned - first Monday of the month you might not get a seat! The barista Pete is awesome!

2013-01-05,5.0,"A love letter to Julius Meinl: Dear Julius Meinl, Such an asset your store is to the Lakeview neighbourhood that it's my first point of call on a five hour pilgrimage from the border of Canada. That's the devotion which your beautifully prepared desserts and delectable egg dishes, authentically prepared true to the Austrian standards of your original location, inspires in me. The equivalent of driving non-stop from Munich or Prague to Vienna for an hour to ninety minutes of quiet enjoyment in these rarefied settings.  Where else can a cafe be full to the rafters and still maintain an elusive air of refinement and tranquility? Go to any Starbucks, coffee house or bar in this city, you'll discover loud conversations, the shriek of children cutting through the atonal hum like knives. Here the little ones sit  still longer, attended by parents or caregivers who include them in conversation or arrest the outbursts somehow. Your Opera Torte may be involved, for what stop by that extraordinary pastry case does not invite salivation and quiet appreciation for the artistry in composing so many simple ingredients into a slab of creamy or chocolate perfection? I have yet to find a comparable place without a liquor license. You who invites harpists to serenade your dinner crowds one night and manages soul or jazz ensembles the next, please realize the inherent value and civility in such places. They are a rarity in many parts of the United States and Canada; having visited 40+ states and 5+ provinces in search of a lovely cup of tea, I should know. I revere atmospheres that mix culture with culinary heights and intellectual stimulation. The soft scent of melting cheese and the clink of small spoons in your trademark cups is soothing and melodious to all the senses. The rushed North American society vanishes once we walk through your doors. I could wage a death-defying struggle against my income taxes or a transatlantic flight after your mac and cheese spaetzel. The decadence of your almond inflected pastries on a delicate sponge is mouthwatering. The baked eggs are worth every moment of the wait, but the kind request that patrons add a little time to their dining experience is another genteel gesture in an age which rarely recognizes their value. I could wax poetic on the pleasure of the baked eggs and the balance of flavours offered, or the sustaining strength of the hot goulash prepared in a manageable portion instead of grossly oversized Americanized ones which lead to so much waste and excess. A bowl of goulash on spaetzle is like a hug from Grandma.  Taking away an extra box of your torte for the long drive home is not the same as the romantic, intimate ambiance I find in your shop. I miss the attentive, discreet service that never comes as intrusive, but welcome. The moment I walk in, I'm seated by someone happy to inform me of seasonal offerings and let me find my bearings, but never more than a few footsteps away. When a gentleman dropped a glass of water on the floor and promptly doused himself, three of your staff appeared in an instant with a fresh newspaper, real towels, another glass, and all the cleaning supplies necessary. The concern was for the guest as much as the area. He was freshened up and put to rights immediately. For that, I ask you to please consider expanding. I realize another outpost may diminish your ability to keep these high standards but certainly you can exist outside Chicagoland. I have no doubts that you would thrive in other cities: Detroit could use your old world charm. I'd even take one of the southern Ontarian cities like Kitchener-Waterloo or, if I  must, Toronto (though it's no closer) to add to the landscape of revered institutions who bring a taste of Europe to us.

When in doubt, get the goulash!!! If you're not full after all that - the strudel is some of the best in the city. There are several Julius Meinl's all over town, and they own a bakery that used to be on Irving Park but has since changed location. The strudel is made there and then shipped to the different locations.  The only thing that I will mention is expect to run into screaming children at this location. This Julius Meinl's is on Southport, which is home to 1000's of pregnant women and their obnoxious strollers full of too many poorly behaving children.  I've had a couple of breakfasts ruined at this location by a 3 year old asshole because it decided to have a melt down and it's hipster parents just ignored it. Parents - when your child can't sit quietly in a restaurant, you remove them. Its not rocket science. You are ruining other peoples' meals that they are paying good money for.

Also, I thought the poach on the pears was off.  Like maybe not quite poached, but cooked and then finished with red food dye.  The chicken salad sandwich was a complete throw away.  The bread that it was on was slightly stale and burned at one end.  The salad itself was something out of a 50's kitchen:  a globby white mess of mayo.   Resuling opinion (again):  Why the hell didn't I take my own damn advice from my last review and stick to this as a place for a cuppa -whether tea or coffee- and a quiet place to hang?  I don't know, but maybe I'll get it this time...",0.9775,0.769,0.159,0.072,0.511952380952381

I mean, the place always has customers, so the wait staff has the opportunity to make some serious tip money. The people working at the counter are pleasant. But the servers? Cold, cold, cold.  The Purple Grandma and I stopped in on a recent weekday, around 11:30am. The full lunch crowd hadn't arrived yet. We chose a table in the front half of the restaurant. Our server was a robot who had not received his personality chip yet. Data on Star Trek:The Next Generation was an android who had no capacity for emotion, and he was more pleasant. We got our food, our waters, our coffee drinks in good order. The mechanics of service were there. Good customer service also includes saying ""hello"", or some kind of pleasant greeting. We got none of that. It was so noticeably absent, we even discussed it. It's part of table service at this location. Along with your coffee, you get frost. Doesn't Julius Meinl do any kind of training at all? Or all these servers all relatives of some big shot? It really detracts from the experience. At 11:30am, something else detracted from the experience. They were completely out of scones. Purple Grandma asked for the highlighted hot tea. They were out of that, too.  Isn't 11:30am a little early to be running out of menu items? I had a croissant sandwich with egg and bacon. It arrived piping hot. It was good. I think I may be going on an egg sandwich tour of Chicago. Purple Grandma liked her second choice of hot tea, though she didn't order any other food after she found out they were completely out of scones. In case you're wondering, I still tipped Mr. Frost 20%. I suppose that won't encourage him to develop some people skills. If Julius Meinl doesn't get this service issue addressed, it is really going to start hurting their business.",0.9712,0.861,0.096,0.042,0.6123842592592594

The tea came out piping hot in a glass Bodum tea press and was enough for about three full cups. It was presented on a little tray with a cute cup, sugar, and a little cup of creamer which was a nice touch. We sat at a little table by the window and their chairs were nice and comfy. The only downside is that I do agree with other reviewers who said that their server seemed a little annoyed if they didn't order food.

And, as it turns out, if you're not doing sit-down service, there is no where to sit! Not cool to boot out paying customers on a rainy day, buck-o. Uh, as I said, coffee is wonderful. The beans are roasted perfectly. Espresso drinks are not overly sweetened. To-go breakfast items are incredibly delicious-- I cannot say enough good things about their buttery, flaky croissants filled with Swiss or Gruyere and sauteed spinach.

Let us continue on our Sunday Funday adventures and find this delicious coffee that I MUST make mine! Googled and found and miraculously it was just one train stop away. We set out with the sun shining on our faces, the nice breeze cooling us down and stumbled upon a larger than expected cafe with a large patio... perfect for relaxing and enjoying some of this delicious coffee.  We grab a seat outside and enjoy the weather until we were greeted with a (i'm not gonna lie) not so friendly waitress... but I didn't care! Give me sun... give me coffee!... Give me... that awesome lemon lavender cake I saw in the window! We got our coffee on a little tray with a saucer of cream, glass of water, and a little biscuit... enjoyed it and then later dove into the lemon lavender amazing layered cake with a butter cream frosting. Oh my! A perfect Sunday afternoon. I would never go here if I was in a hurry because this embraces European culture - slow and steady.

Kuma's is at the top of that list, but I am now adding Julius Meinl.  I stopped in today early afternoon because I was craving breakfast, but I needed something fast and thought this would be a perfect choice. I ordered one of their baked egg dishes to go and then sat down in their waiting area. As soon as I sat down, I sent a text to a friend. The reason why this is important is because it allowed me to know exactly when my wait started. After sitting there for almost 30 minutes, I asked behind the counter if it usually took this long for what I ordered. I was told ""Yeah, baked eggs generally take 30 minutes."" So, I sat down and waited some more. I finally received my order 42 minutes later.  WWWWWWWWWWTTTTTTTTTTTTFFFFFFFFFFFFF If something usually takes 30 minutes to make, why does it not have that printed on the menu? And why did the girl at the cash register not tell me this when I ordered it? Obviously, when people are ordering things to-go, they are not trying to sit around your restaurant all afternoon. I mentioned to the employee that finally gave me my order that this really needs to be printed on the menu or at the very least, mentioned when ordering, and I received an extremely fake ""Ooopss...sorry.""    Yes, I am sorry. I am sorry that I wasted an hour waiting on a decent (but not amazing) egg dish that is extremely small portioned for the price.  Maybe the next time a customer approaches you in a non-confrontational manner with a legitimate complaint, at the very least you could offer a free pastry or a card for a free drink the next time around. But, you are obviously doing enough business that one person complaining doesn't matter. Well, good luck with that. I am glad all the stroller mommies are keeping you afloat.

And yes, there is a wait on weekends--as brunch is the second most-popular activity in this city (after drinking heavily), it's pretty much unavoidable. If you don't want to wait in line and come into contact with people with strollers (many of them with actual babies inside!), then I'm going to gently suggest weekend brunch in Chicago just isn't for you. Everything else here works--I -like- that it's a bit dainty, with really excellent coffee served on a silver platter with water and a tiny cookie. I like that we're somehow the only place outside of Vienna with a Julius Meinl--come on, people, this place has been around since the Hapsburg days! I like that they have pictures of real Julius Meinl outlets back in the day from every corner of the empire, with signs in Hungarian, Czech, German and everything else. It plays up the whole Central European thing pretty hard, and I like that.  And the food's good, too--standard brunch fare, but done in a different way--the baked eggs -are- really good. And the coffee seems to be a different roast than you see at other coffee shops--just a different flavour than you'll find elsewhere.  The waitstaff is, admittedly, a touch snooty.

Their brie and ham crepes (my boyfriend's favorite) are huge, delicious, warm, and savory as all get out.   The Austrian breakfast, a soft boiled egg, 4 slices of Emmental cheese (Swiss cheese), and in our case - 4 slices of cold ham, with your choice of toast - is just a great, well-rounded, and yummy way to start the day :) The first few times I went I was determined to try a new pastry in their pastry case each time.  Is it my fault my heart kept bringing me back to the seasonal fruit tart? Delicate, subtly sweet, and you can pretend it's healthy because it has fruit on it! On the other side of the spectrum - go straight for the ""Käsespätzle""  Which is basically mac and cheese with Emmentaler cheese, onions, and if you want - bacon. So, so good.  The Turkey and Avocado sandwich is also wonderful, with huge pieces of both of the key ingredients, as well as ample tomato and cucumber. It also comes with their delicious salad. On the other end of the sandwich spectrum, do not hesitate to snatch up a Truffled Croque Madame.  Yes, Truffled. It comes with black Forest ham, Emmentaler cheese, over-hard egg, truffle oil and of course is topped with the cheese.  I split this with my cousin, because otherwise I think we would have been weighted to our chairs all day. I love this place for their berry teas also - both hot and cold, and of course their complimentary gingersnap cookies!!  MMM MMM!   Uptown Chicago is the only place thus far to have a Julius Meinl outside of Austria, and I'm darn proud of that :)",0.9943,0.757,0.206,0.037,0.691800356506239

The coffees are all fantastic and served on an individual silver platter with a small glass of water and Julius biscuit cookie.  The breakfasts at Meinl are heaven and my favorite is the Nutella banana crepes - creamy and scrumptious. The baked eggs are excellent and I'm salivating right now thinking of their incredible treats. The roast beef on a pretzel roll is just heavenly and the salads are all fantastic. Save room for the indulgent pastries!  It is soooo worth the calories and makes the entire Julius Meinl experience.

It is a tiny place, though, and the tables are small, so don't expect  Much, if not all, of the staff is from Austria.  If you dine in, they deliver your coffee on a silver tray with a glass of tap water, and a cracker.  This is the way they do it back in Wien, so just enjoy it!  The crackers, by the way, or cookies, or however you want to classify them, are yummy.  It's almost worth buying a coffee or tea just for the cookies. They have sandwiches, pastries, coffee, tea, and a lovely, lovely atmosphere.  I think  they also have crepes.  Weekends get very crowded here - you may wait 20-30 minutes just to sit.  Yes, just to sit in a cafe.  Can you believe it?  I don't mind, but I do usually try to come here at an 'off'' time.  Mid-day, mid week, etc.   They have also been known to have musicians perform there, violinists and such.  I am not sure if they still do this, as it's been awhile since I've been here on a weekend or evening.   This is the place to while away the hours, let me tell you.  Highly, highly recommended to all coffee lovers, tea lovers, pastry lovers, sandwich lovers, couch lovers, and lovers!  It's very romantic. ;-)",0.9981,0.754,0.22,0.027,0.5140501792114696
2010-04-12,5.0,"For the longest time, I just walked past this place. I didn't really even notice it, it was just another building on my way to CVS. My roommate was the same way, and one day she announced that she was going to stop in and try it. Her review: ""They have good coffee, and the pastries are pretty good too."" So I continued to live my life, thinking of Julius Meinl as only a coffee shop. I don't particularly care for coffee, so I had no need to go in. Until one day. A friend wanted to hang out at a coffee shop for some reason. I try not to participate in Starbucks, and every table in Safari was booked, so I suggest Julius Meinl. Oh. My. God.  This place is so much more than a run-of-the-mill coffee shop. Yes, they have coffee, but they have many varieties of teas, as well as a full menu. It's a little Austrian cafe, and they serve brunch, lunch, and dinner. I don't normally get brunch here, but one time I ordered crepes. I don't normally eat crepes and I'm normally very wary of jam (I don't care for the seeds), but I decided to just go for it. So glad I did. The jam was spectacular. For some odd reason, I wasn't full, so I ordered a chocolate pastry. So good. I'm a huge fan of the half-sandwich and half-salad. I love goat cheese, so of course I had to get the goat cheese salad. It's perfect. I've had several sandwiches (all amazing), and my favorite has to be the pear and brie sandwich. The first time I ordered it, I wasn't sure if I could wholeheartedly support it, but I kept thinking about it for awhile. I ordered it again, spread the brie around, and absolutely loved it. They have a smaller selection for standard Austrian entrees. I forget the name of the 2 dishes I ordered, but one was similar to a pasta dish with bacon and cheese. It was good, but very heavy. The other was a pasta dish with some kind of meat on it. Very delicious. And clearly I know nothing about traditional Austrian fare because I'm sure I'm simplifying this. I've never actually had the coffee here because I'm a tea person. They have several pages of teas, all listed out by type (black, green, etc). I tried to get something new every time I went. Plus, what's the point of going to a place like this and ordering the standard English Breakfast tea? Boring. The best part of the teas is that you get your own press, which makes about 3 cups of tea. If you ask for more hot water, they'll gladly refill it. And finally, we come to the desserts. Absolutely phenomenal. I confess to coming in sometimes for only dessert and tea. I've tried most of the chocolate ones (which are all prominently displayed in a glass case), and the only one that didn't wow me was the brandied one. Perhaps too much brandy? I also tried the apple strudel, and while I don't normally like that, I thought it was very tasty. So if you're looking for greasy bar food, go down the street; there are plenty of options. But if you're looking for something tasty and on the healthy side, I'd definitely recommend coming here.

(No one told me there was an Einstein bros. half a block further south.) Flash forward to 2010.  A new year.  A new me.   I wake up at 8am, do my standard 500 crunches and half hour of yoga, then have sex with my girlfriend for twenty-eight minutes (30 counting cuddle time).  It's Valentine's Day, so I let her ride on my broad, muscular shoulders rather than slinging her fireman style over my back.  I carry her eastward in search of a café.  She requires food to replenish the vital nutrients, minerals and glycogen strenuous and acrobatic physical exertion can deplete if you do it first thing in the morning after a night spent in deep slumber, your head resting atop a firm but strangely yielding pectoral, legs tangled languidly together while your lover stares off into the darkness, contemplating the dwindling utility of man in the age of mechanical reproduction, or possibly the BK Value Menu or Goya or something. So again I come to the same Julius Meinl, only this time I WANT to be there.  I pull out my golden money clip and examine the way it barely contains the wad of $100 bills I have unceremoniously crammed into it.  I tap the menu in the window with one fingertip, right on the $11 salmon sandwich and go, ""Aha.  Here we are."" ""What is this place?"" asks my lover, as I deposit her in one fluid motion upon the sidewalk.   ""It is paradise,"" I reply.  ""Follow me."" Then we totally had the salmon sandwich, a truffled egg and ham sandwich, a gallon of delicious coffee and a caramel and apple mousse for dessert which I fed to her with a small fork, occasionally brushing loose strands of her beautiful hair back from her forehead. The staff was pleasant.  The waiter was attentive, and when I flexed for him he was like, ""Damn."" And I was all like, ""Mm hm.  Bet on it."" While pricey for the layman, Julius Meinl is nonetheless a fine place for a moneyed living statue to enjoy several cups of coffee with his girlfriend on a contrived holiday meant to instill shame and loneliness in the unfortunate masses, and I recommend it highly. ... although technically the lox bagel at Einstein Bros. is better than the lox sandwich at J.M.  Just sayin'.",0.9868,0.812,0.123,0.065,0.47230053959645796

I decided to eat the other half of my sandwich open-faced so I removed the bread and laying right in the middle of the lettuce was a giant black hair. I kid you not. I immediately called our waiter over and ended up not paying for the sandwich. It was revolting.  It took about two months for me to give it another chance, I wish I hadn't.

Fine, no big deal. We sat RIGHT next to (I'm talking 1-2 feet away) the hostess that entire time.  I noticed another couple who came in after us and she called them first to be seated. I knew something was up so I asked her if she had our name. In a rude, unpleasant, and agitated voice she said, ""I don't know if I wrote you're name down, did you SEE me write it?"" I don't have it here. I told her that yes, absolutely I gave her our name and I'd clearly been sitting next to her for 25 minutes. I asked if we could please be seated next because she was seating people who came in after us and we were really hungry. She was rude and said she would try. Finally, after a few more minutes, and much to her displeasure, she sat us.

2010-01-26,5.0,"There is a phrase that is going to show up a lot in this review, which will explain why it is one of the only 5 star reviews I've given. That phrase is, ""best I've ever had.""  My girlfriend and I came here for breakfast one morning, not really knowing what to expect from it. We found a table right away and we had menus in our hands almost immediately. The service was very attentive, and our waitress came almost as soon as we were both ready to order. I got the ginger snap latte and the Meinl Baked Eggs with spinach, mushroom and feta. Diana got the Drei Maderl Haus and the Nutella Crepes.  I don't know what more there is to say than that everything was amazing. My eggs were cooked perfectly, fluffy and smooth and delicious. The spinach was a bright fresh green, the mushrooms were full of flavor and the feta? The best feta I have ever had. I like feta a lot and I have never had it taste so amazingly wonderful. I could put that feta on every dish I ever ate and it would still be fantastic. I had a bite of Diana's crepes, and what can I say? Best crepes I have ever had.  The drei maderl haus was very good, but kind of too strong for my taste. That has nothing to do with the quality of the drink, because it was very good, assuming you like espresso. My latte? Not the best I have ever had. It WAS the best I'd ever had, but we came back two days later and I got the eggnog latte, which knocked the ginger snap latte to second best ever. Both of these were amazing and needed nothing added to them at all. They were perfect as they came to me, and would make me a regular coffee drinker if I lived in the area.  When we came back later, we were on the go, so I got a ham and cheese croissant with my eggnog latte and Diana got a spinach and cheese croissant. Both of the sandwiches? You guessed it, best ham, best croissant, best breakfast sandwiches I have ever had.  Also, the waitress we had the first day was incredibly nice and helpful, and always showed up just at the right times. No showing up when we had a mouthful of food to ask how things were, no showing up as soon as we opened the menu then disappearing for ten minutes. She was great.  I did feel a bit under dressed here, but was not treated as such. I felt a little weird as I sat there in my Threadless T and jeans, and looked over to realize that the baby sitting next to me was dressed better than I was. I was put more at ease, though, when I noticed that the waitress, otherwise in the same all-black outfit that all the waitresses were sporting, had a camouflage belt hiding under her apron and a wrist tattoo. Not a big thing, but it made me feel better about shabbier garb.  Also, the thing that makes me want to come here enough to be a regular is that a lot of the other people here seem to do the same thing. When our waitress wasn't at our table, she was having familiar conversations with customers she knew around the restaurant, hugging their kids, and just generally making it feel like a very kind, comfortable place that I would love to be able to come to all the time.  So this place had already earned an easy 5 stars, when on the way out, it suddenly jumped to a theoretical 5 1/2 stars. That's because, as we were bundling up to go outside, we ran into Tim Meadows, who was just coming in, and that alone was worth the theoretical extra 1/2 star.",0.9991,0.79,0.193,0.018,0.4659599224305109

Inside, the decor is very cozy but sophisticated, with some plush armchairs serving as seats in some cases.  In my most recent trip to Julius Meinl, I had a pairing of half a roasted vegetable sandwich on homemade focaccia bread, a cup of beer cheese soup with herbed croutons and a nice light side salad. The portion sizes are always just right. If you order coffee (which I recommend) or another beverage, it's served on a cute individual silver platter with a small spoon, sugar packet and gingersnap cookie.  For dessert, I opted to get a pastry to go -- one of the specials of the day, a pear-almond torte. Delicious.  One thing to note is that this place can get pretty busy, and you're lucky if you don't have to wait (especially on the weekends, since they are also known for their great breakfast/brunch menu). If you're not up for a wait, I'd recommend getting some coffee and a pastry to go (you can walk up to the counter and order without being seated in the dining area).",0.9918,0.815,0.185,0.0,0.7071239606953894

After you have been here, and tasted the pastries, sipped the teas or coffees, enjoyed the refinement and the service, all for a price margin barely higher than your franchise and indie coffee shops, you will be a convert. My only, minor complaint, is that sometimes the tables are bit wobbly, feel less than solid and stable. There was a 'jazz' duo the last time we dropped by, and they were pretty lame, but at least it was subdued, and did not interfere with the conversation. This strikes me as the sort of coffee shop one patronizes with a friend for conversation and not one to retreat to in order to stick a couple of ear buds in your ears and sit hunched over one's laptop, appearing as though you are writing the 'Great American Novel' in an almost autistic solitude.",0.9086,0.813,0.133,0.054,0.38958333333333345

Okay, anyway...  Julius Meinl really is one of my favorite spots on Southport, perhaps in Chicago.  I daresay their coffee might be better than Intelligentsia, or at least comparable.  I also greatly enjoy their sweets counter; each item was everything I want in a dessert:  beautiful, delicate and delicious.   Other notes: this is not really a coffee shop for studying, as you can pay for wi-fi on the weekdays and there is no wi-fi on the weekends, which makes sense, considering how busy they can get and the more formal atmosphere.",0.9862,0.73,0.247,0.023,0.58875

Add to that some salads and sandwiches, plus some authentic Austrian main dishes, such as goulash and spaetzle, and you're good to go. I love Julius in the summertime, when you can sit outside with a good book and a soup and sandwich combo. At the same time, it's a great breakfast/brunch spot. They have a daily selection of croissants, both sweet and savory scones, and a bunch of baked egg dishes. Plus something called the Imperial Fruhstuck, which sounds a lot naughtier than it is. I've also been known to stop here for dessert after having dinner at another restaurant. Because face it, a lot of places have great food, but their dessert menu leaves something to be desired. And with JM up the street, why should you suffer? Julius also sells jars of preserves and tins of cookies and coffee and tea and other goodies. The prices are a bit rich for my blood, but I do love to browse. I'm sure they're worth every penny! I'll admit that sometimes Julius makes me feel like a giant.

I tried the cider, it was quite tasty. All the drinks came on the silver tray with water backs and a yummy ginger cookie.  I went with the baked eggs with the parmesan and truffle oil potato rosti. The parmesan overpowered the truffle oil, but it was good nonetheless. Mom went with the cream of chicken soup and loved it, and she's a soup connoisseur. Sis got the croque monsieur. It looked amazing, all melty and crispy and stuffed with black forest ham. I may give that a go next time around.  All in all, everything was good. The service left a bit to be desired.

I took two friends here this past weekend at 8:30 am to beat the mass of weekend stroller-moms who clog this place with $1000 strollers after 10:30 am. I do love kids, but those monster strollers are not cafe friendly!  Now, the breakfasts are quite nice. They have a traditional soft-boiled egg breakfast (very typical in German cafes and B&Bs) and a mind blowing truffle oil baked egg dish. The egg sandwich was also good., My Austrian girlfriend used to make Kaiserschmarren pancakes (oh the nostalgia) and they make them here so you better try them!  I always order the Grosser Brauner since this is the typical coffee in Austria and it should be a 30 second pull on a manual espresso machine (typical pull is 15 seconds), but here it is automated so I wondered about this since it seems stronger here than in Austria. The Austrian girlfriend's brother ran a Cafe/Konditorei . It comes on a silver tray with a small water and a side of cream (in Austria this is heavy cream or evaporated milk), but here it is half-half I think. Anyhow, this is the coffee to order on your first visit. This said the french press pot is wonderful as is the tea press. So, as much as Franz Josef might roll in his grave, I might start drinking French press here!  Oh, and while Meinl does not have cafes in Austria (I think they now have one in Vienna) they have long been a primary wholesaler and grocer so much of the coffee in Vienna that does not come from Italian roasters comes from Meinl and this is as good a representation of the Vienna Cafe as you can find here.

Our first visit was sort of ironic - it was the day before the first day of CPS (and my wife's first workday since having the summer off) and we were looking to stop someplace *quick* before heading to the music box to see a movie. We had a friend in tow as well. We walked in, were seated and were given menus (?) What the? I didn't expect that, nor did I expect the cozy sit-down atmosphere, and the mint hot chocolate I ordered was tasty, and my wife and friend both had good coffee drinks, and the pastry was good but ... oh no - the movie! We totally missed it. It was fun to hang out though Since that day, we've popped in and had varying levels of good and strange experiences. Once, we stopped in 30 minutes before the kitchen was to close, and were completely ignored by the waitstaff after being seated. We left and went to El Presidente :-)  Another time, we were smashed onto the tiniest table and could barely make room to eat. Something very strange is happening as well - Julius Meinl has turned into a double-wide stroller truck stop! I couldn't believe what I witnessed this past Saturday. A woman walked in with one of those annoying Volkswagen sized strollers, blocked everyone from even moving in the entrance area, then sort of moved over to the side. She didn't get a table - didn't even ask. After about 10 minutes (my wife and I were waiting for a friend to show up), *another* giant stroller mommy showed up, and both of them chatted in the entrance, effectively blocking all movement (and possibly the sun) for about 10 minutes. Then, out of the blue, they both wheeled their gargantuan sized baby wagons out of the restaurant and proceeded down Southport to where ever they'd planned on actually going. So, in conclusion, Julius is alright, but don't pop in on the way to anywhere, and don't be too upset if you feel like you're having tea in a dollhouse.  Avanti is a better bet if you just want a quick cup of joe.",0.976,0.789,0.13,0.081,0.501026936026936

We said ""no thanks,"" and kept talking and sitting on the patio. A snobby, bitchy waitress comes by a few minutes later and asks if we'll be dining there. We say no...we just brought our drinks out here to hang out...both of us very confused.  The snobby ass waitress then says, ""Well, next time, you're going to have to ORDER something to sit here. That's how it works here.""  ......Oh, I'm sorry. Maybe it was poor etiquette on our parts for assuming that Julius Meinl would allow us wretched people with TO-GO cups to sit on the patio.

Smooth coffee, good foam, and a dusting of cocoa to top it off.   My grandmother had a cafe mocha which may have been the best I've ever tasted - a good chocolate taste without being too sweet, and without completely masking the taste of the coffee, either.  After seeing the myriad desserts at the counter, we couldn't help ordering something sweet, so we chose a slice of opera cake to share.  Yum.  I will be back this Friday for breakfast!",0.9868,0.734,0.218,0.048,0.5880952380952381

2009-06-30,4.0,"I've been running this through my head since I went to Julius Meinl for the first time last evening - what is it about a chain restaurant that's instantly identifiable and all wrong? I avoid chains whenever I can unless it's local.  But all I can come up with is that it just means polished - the furniture is worn but doesn't show it, the lighting is designed and staged, the chocolate medallion on my tart has the store logo on it, the presentation is too perfect and thoughtful, the dishes match too well, the flatware is too heavy. So I'd have expected the menu to be less satisfying, or the food less fresh or tasty, or desirable. But - it was all great!  I had a turkey salad with just the right amount of everything, including dressing, it was a perfect light meal. They have a plate of four finger sandwiches that can be ordered individually, so I had a truffled bacon, leek, and goat cheese open face on a perfectly toasted slice of brioche.

2009-06-15,4.0,"A group of us (five total) went here for a post-dinner dessert and coffee on a Saturday night.  It was pretty late, and I was surprised to find it packed and loud.  And it wasn't because of the live music (a cellist and a violinist).  There were families with hyper kids (it's 10PM, shouldn't they be in bed??).   I've been here for brunch during the week and weekend, and it's the same.   Anyways, back to the food.  I got a small melange (from the menu description, it is basically a wet capuccino with dark cocoa sprinkled on top) with the esterhazy.  The esterhazy was a small rectangle shaped piece of cake the size of a deck of cards with dacquoise (a nut meringue in this case hazelnuts) layered with hazelnut cream and chocolate ganache.  If you like French macaroons or meringue cookies, you'd like this cake.  It's kinda hard to eat with just a fork, because the layers are very crunchy.  I felt torn.  For the same $6, I could've had a slice twice the size at Taste of Heaven.  At the same time, the cake was good and it had premium ingredients and damnit it's European so it's automatically more pricey. The drink was delicious that night, but I find the espresso drinks are a hit or a miss.  It's more of a bakery/food place than a cafe, as everyone is not skilled with the espresso machine.

The other great thing about Meinl is that they have live music many (if not all) nights of the week.  This part I have yet to experience, but I am looking forward to coming here and get a post dinner dessert-and-coffee.

2009-03-03,4.0,"Although many visit Julius Meinl for a mere cup of caffeine, the food here is also delectable. I've been on two separate occasions, sampling different dishes and been pleased both times. First, I had the Chicken and Fontina Crepes which were straightforward and delicious. Served with a small mixed green salad, it hit the spot without obliterating my appetite. For a finish, I has a modest Oatmeal-Chocolate-Coconut cookie, which was good, but not amazing. On my second visit, I choose the more hearty Austrian Goulash. While delicious and comforting during a cold, blustery, Chicago winter, I felt the beef sauce was much too salty for my liking, but other opinions may diverge on this particular point. The spaetzle was a bit mushy from sitting in the sauce, but an overall nice reminder of my vacation in Bravaria. The coffee here is also delectable. Trying what seemed to be a specialty - the Melange - proved to be a wise decision. The balance of espresso, milk and foam was spot-on. While a packet of sugar is offered, I preferred the more bitter taste and the dusting of cocoa was just enough sweetness. The dessert case holds a whole variety of delicious cakes, of which I've not had an opportunity to try - but am anxious to. Most look large enough to share, so bring a friend and partake all that Julius Meinl has to offer.",0.9897,0.754,0.193,0.053,0.5831890331890333

2009-01-12,4.0,"This is my go-to dessert place for when I am too lazy to figure out a new place to go. The thing is, I can be a pretty lazy guy- so I happen to fall back on JM quite a bit- and am never disappointed in doing so.  Meinl is one of those classic places that holds true to its origins. Based out of Vienna- the parent company has been known for quite a long time for its coffee. When they decided to branch into America with a coffee house, Chicago (specifically the one here on Southport) was luckily the final site chosen.  As for their coffee- I like it. It is not my favorite cup of coffee, but the simple fact that they offer it in French-press form is a great thing! Probably better than their coffee though in my estimation is their amazing tea varieties. I have fallen in love with a few of their teas (specifically, I really like their ""Nutcracker"" blend) and you really can't go wrong ordering that in-house. They bring it out to you in a loose-leaf tea pot so you get a couple of cups out of each serving.  The main attractions for me though (other than the classic, and stylish interior) are the desserts. Wonderful little torts and cakes and pastries abound here, all of which are beautifully presented, and fairly reasonable when you consider the quality you are getting. I tend to fall back on a really simple dessert- the Nutella crepes with bananas- which while is pretty easy to do (even at home), I find it a terrific compliment to my French-press coffee.  Meinl does a decent weekend brunch too- but get there early- it can get quite busy and wait times can be excessive (for reasons listed below).  Possibly the best part of the entire experience goes back to what Meinl does best- which is representing itself as a European coffee shop. In Europe, a typical coffee shop/cafe is a place to relax and enjoy. It is to be expected for people to get their drinks and maybe a bite to eat and to stay for sometimes hours, reading the paper, chatting with old friends, or even just sitting back and watching people go by. This place is a great one for doing all of that- and the staff there is not only patient and friendly, but completely understanding and willing to accept this.  Thank you Julius Meinl for giving me that place to ""escape"" to Europe for even just a short while. May you never run out of Nutella (or crepes for that matter!) and may you always have hot water for my tea or coffee!!!",0.9989,0.76,0.223,0.017,0.5703423848878395

There seriously was zero room for our drinks and food. Anyway, our waitress was nice, nothing outstanding, but nice. The spiced apple cider chai was heaven in a mug! I'll be making a few stops here just for the apple cider chai. They ran out of the cookies that they bring with your drink which made us a little sad. Actually one out of four people got a cookie...so she was nice and shared. We all enjoyed our food. Two of us had nutella crepes...really good, pretty much dessert for breakfast. My friend had some sort of egg and feta cheese thing and the other member of our group had the banana french toast. Overall, we liked our food and drinks, but didn't think it was exceptional. A few of us were given dirty silverware, which definitely knocks a star off. I liked that we didn't feel rushed even though the place was packed.",0.9894,0.756,0.191,0.052,0.5638888888888889

2008-09-01,2.0,"I have extremely mixed feelings about this place. And unfortunately, my most recent experience (today) has tainted my general opinion even more so. I'd like to separate this review into two parts, well three parts actually:  1) coffee 2) food 3) service Coffee: The coffee here is fab. I love it and usually when I come here I come here only for the coffee. The service is always fast and they've not screwed up my drink once. My favorite is the Frappe. Similar to a frappachino at Starbucks except a million times better. So, if this review were based solely on coffee, hands down I would give them five stars. Food: Food has always been really great as well. I always get the baked egg (goat cheese, tomato, basil) which is what they're known for and I love it. Every time it's been cooked to perfection. They have a variety of sandwiches to choose from as well as crepes and salads. Basically, there is something here for everybody and the presentation as well as the quality is quite superb. Service: This is where i have a huge problem. The service here, to put it bluntly, SUCKS so unbelievably bad. I mean, it is AWFUL. I've had multiple bad experiences here quite honestly, I don't plan on ever coming back and sitting down to eat. Ever. The wait staff is never too friendly and although I understand it's not the waiter's problem that the kitchen staff is slow and/or screws up the order, it is her job to liaise with the customer and apologize on behalf of her moronic co-workers. Which she never did. Anyway, my main issue here is that they are slow. Very slow. And even though we waited and waited and waited for our food today, and when it finally arrived my friend's order was incorrect, and then we waited and waited even longer for her to get the correct order, and no apology, no offer to compensate us for our inconvenience and incredibly awful experience at their institution. Julius Meinl just has really bad customer service. And for that, I won't come here again to eat nor will I recommend it to anyone else. I am not even quite sure why I gave it three stars. I guess because I love their coffee so much. Actually, screw that. I'm changing it to two.  Come here for coffee and that's it. Trust me.",0.844,0.757,0.13,0.113,0.5501973684210528

They brought me the wrong sandwich, it took forever to get the right one and whoever delivered it (the manager?) plunked it down on the table in front of me without a word of apology ot mention of comp-ing it. I am really disappointed in this place.

Second, the service.  While the waiter clearly had a crowd to deal with and dealt with it well for the most part, the snooty attitude was hard to ignore.  When asked if it was possible to get something like a chocolate shake, the look on the waiter's face said 'How pedestrian.'  A similar haughty air was evident when someone asked for the 'grilled chicken sandwich' and was met with ""We don't have that... oh you must mean the ROASTED chicken sandwich.""   Definitely a blah experience.  I'll spend my money at some other overpriced (air conditioned) place.",-0.6712,0.815,0.075,0.11,0.6020833333333332

The counter service is always prompt and would leave me plenty of time to enjoy my breakfast while waiting for my bus to work.

Due to this I was slightly thrown off when it was the suggested venue of a first date, but being an agreeable person, I consented to the location. When I arrived, I found the room dimly lit with a quiet sophisticate in the air that seemed about right for the situation.

My date had already eaten (where do I find these guys) and so I made my way to the counter to order a pastry and a cup of coffee (I hadn't eaten, but I'm a girl and I didn't want to woof down a meal as he sipped water) only to discover there was table service. I enjoyed an deliciously light (yet rich) apple turnover and a cup of coffee. I've always found their coffee to be so so, and their pastries to be phenomenal. Our waitress was very sweet despite the fact that between two people, there were only only two cups of coffee and a pastry on the bill. She recognized that we were there for conversation more than the food items and quickly gave us our bill to pay at our leisure. I imagine they must get this often as they are a coffeehouse first and a restaurant second. At no point did we feel rushed and because our bill was so small we tipped her 100% for taking up her table for so long.

Julius Meinl is a Belgian coffee company. Pretty cool. And the coffee's really good. If you are in and out, or just stopping in for a light lunch, you're set. But if you plan on dwelling here for awhile, doing some kind of work, you might want to rethink your choice. It's busy and not what I thought it would be.  This place makes me think about how well things go over in different places.

What does ""Belgian coffeehouse"" conjure up in this American's mind? Let's see, old bearded socialists lazily sipping coffee from tiny glass cups with saucers discussing the actual birthplace of french fries while nibbling on some waffles topped with succulent chocolate.  What is actually happening at Julius Meinl is far less appealing, in my book. It is very busy, to the point of distraction. Everyone who comes in here does not respect ""coffee shop culture"" - which in my mind is close to ""bookstore culture"". You come in, you do your thing, you be quiet, and look intelligent. Here, people come in and start doing crafts with their toddlers, staging multiple job interviews, and generally just being obnoxious Lakeview a-holes. Plus, the atmosphere here reminds me of Bath and Body Works of all places.

Pricing okay on the food, too high on the drinks.  BUT when comparing the drink prices to, say, Starbucks, they're normal.  I just can't help wondering about all the net gain...

The food is served in small quantities, so this might not be the best place for you if you have a large appetite--the menu isn't terribly expensive, but it's not cheap either.

It was the coldest day of winter when I first set foot inside this trove of central-european pleasures.  I had come to meet my dear brother before going down the street to see a film at the Music Box Theatre (David Lynch's Inland Empire, if memory serves).  How my glasses fogged over when I walked in! Blind as I am without glasses, I couldn't see a thing.  I recall standing in the entry for a moment, strategically ignoring an employee's attention as I stared into space through my steamy lenses.  Nervous laughter ensued until I heard my name called from a distant table.  Hesitantly making my way, I must admit I passed the table of my own brother, his visage foreign to me in my myopic stumbling. Once I regained my bearings, I was verily overwhelmed by the novelty of my immediate environment.  The menu brought even deeper satisfaction, though it gave way to desperation as I realized the decision would not be an easy one.  In need of suggestions, I had barely raised my head before our waitress was at my side.  When she mentioned the possibility of ordering a half-salad and half-entree, a veritable Pandora's box was opened.  As if it were a dream, I remember enjoying some type of pastries of bleu cheese. . . Our experience was so good, we returned after the movie for coffee and dessert.  I remember that night because it was so cold.  One's lungs felt like ice as one's sinuses froze in a crystalline fashion.  We ran the two blocks from the theatre in order to keep ourselves warm.  We weren't the only ones running from the cold that night! While I don't know the story behind the presence of this Julius Meinl in Chicago (besides the fact that I'm very glad it's here) I do understand it is a chain.  In fact the first one I visited was in Budapest.  It was there I enjoyed a fine cup of european coffee one rainy pannonian morning until interrupted by an entourage of elderly american tourists.  A member of said entourage slipped on the sidewalk, creating a scene replete with ambulance and doddering elders. I seldom return to this cafe that I hold so dear, but it is hardly convenient in relation to my apartment in Wicker Park.  Perhaps I will remember it better than it is in reality, and leave it at that.",0.9571,0.869,0.093,0.038,0.5553418803418803

Anyway, once I get my head wrapped around the table service, I always enjoy myself.   The linzertorte latte is my favorite, with its luscious mix of hazelnut and raspberry flavors.  I caved and got a chocolate-filled croissant on my last visit, which was good, but didn't totally rock my world.  I wouldn't let that stop me from sampling any of their other delicious looking pastries or trying some of their quiche (or, shoot, even their oatmeal!)... Service was friendly and relaxed, although maybe what bugs me about the whole table service business is I can't just get up and leave when I feel like it.  I have to wait for someone to bring me a check and then bring me change, if needed...

It's nice when you're into full-on brunch gossip, but clearly not when you're in need of something. Still, I find that just taking a moment to make eye contact with a server will get pretty quick attention and you won't be waiting long.

You're not entirely wrong, but at Addison and Southport, the third base corner of the neighbourhood, there are some refreshing scenery changes -- you must be mistaking us for Lincoln Park. If all the world's a stage, then the Julius Meinl patio is your loge box. And the large selection of fresh tea leaves, brewed hot in a teapot or iced cool in a tall glass, is refreshing, too, as today's first semblance of summer weather. That's my cue to trot down the street and park myself at a table on the Meinl patio with a pile of reading material, and iced tea (today's special was exotic mango) and a bowl of fresh fruit. In the 90 minutes I lounged out there, I saw a woman saunter by, chattering with a parrot on her shoulder and another perched on a finger. The group of Austrians next to me chattered away excitedly in maniacal Germanic hyperbole; maybe the schnitzel was really good. A group of chorale singers strolled by in humming haze, doing their best Polyponic Spree in motion. Not so vanilla cookie-cutter, huh? My point is, if you don't have a deck, balcony or yard in your house, the Meinl patio is the best place to get some serious sun, particularly if you get there after noon (sun headed west, you're on the east side of the street). I often wish they would expand their food menu or at least have specials -- being a regular, you run out of sandwiches to order (although they're all very good). And it's a little pricey for a coffee shop, but you are paying for quality and sun time.  Just a word of advice: be Chicago smart, because you know our weather can be moody sometimes. An hour in sunshine can quickly turn to a storm in a tea cup or you might see clouds in your coffee -- but good thing the inside of Meinl is cosy and warm, and being inside also means you're closer to the pastry case.",0.9942,0.836,0.142,0.022,0.5457334147334146

I like to try something new everytime I come here.  I've only had their tea so far but have heard good things about their coffee.  The China Jasmine Pearl and Monchs-tee are my favorites so far.   The Turkey on Brioche is AMAZING.  It contains a couple yummy slices of turkey, fresh pieces of lettuce and fontina cheese with cherry jam and garlic mayo.

Maybe it's the fact I compose my reviews in my head during meals now or the fact that I have told every person I know how much I love Julius Meinl, but I could have sworn I already yelped it. Julius Meinl is one of the places I have waited over 30 minutes for a seat at. It was so good that after Kris, Joe, myself and Z ate a late dinner and dessert there one night that Kris, Joe, and myself went back the next morning for breakfast. We had the same server both of those times and he was so amiable you just could tell that he really liked his job. When I was here last week, the server, Jesse, was so helpful in finding the perfect tea for sicky me to drink. First she suggested chamomile and then, as an afterthought, she came back to add that if I was feeling stomach sick as well that she could blend in peppermint. Places like this are RARE!  This place is unfathomably cheap for the service and goods it provides. They offer a choose 2: soup, salad, or sandwich for $7. Yes, $7.50 for a fancy salad and sandwich. JM was one of the few reasons I considered living in this neighborhood and now I'm just a bit sad that I won't be. I adore the pear with blue cheese strudel salad. It's a flavor combo that is unparalleled. We went here again last week and I got the turkey and avocado sandwich with the salad and this is one hearty and delicious sandwich. They're not talking lunchmeat. This is a big piece of roased turkey on multigrain.

2007-01-09,4.0,"In Austria, Julius Meinl is known as an upscale gourmet grocery store, rather than a chain of cafes.  Just like Intelligentsia, however, their roast is served almost everywhere in Vienna, so the trademark of the little black boy with the hat is ubiquitous in Viennese coffee houses.  I stopped by several different coffee houses (including Julius Meinl cafe) when I visited Vienna last summer, and they all serviced either Julius Meinl or Illy. The atmosphere here is more in line with Viennese coffee houses than an American coffee shop; it's more a bistro setting with a touch of civility, as opposed to the casual coziness of Starbucks or Intelligentisia.  There are hosts seating you on weekends (yes, it gets very busy on weekends, and just as any other busy, popular places, you need to put up with the wait and the drop in service quality), and there's the menu boasts an extensive list of cold/hot drinks, desserts, salads, and sandwiches.  Coffee arrives on a separate silvery platter for each guest, served on ceremic cup with a piece of chocolate and a glass of water, with milk and condiements on the side.  They also host live classical music performances, and it's a lovely setting befitting the musical genre.  Their desserts are usually of rich Austrian/German fare, my favorites being Mohr Im Hemd (chocolate cake with molten core) and Apfelstrudel/Topfenstrudel.  Their salads and sandwiches are the gourmet types (very good, definitely no comparison to pre-packaged Starbucks kind), served just as thoughtfully as their coffees.  While Intelligentsia might arguably brew better coffee (as they're almost single-mindedly coffee-focused), I come to Julius Meinl for the overall experience. Weekends -- especially Saturday afternoons -- are not the right times to visit Julius Meinl for a sleepy-cozy reading and lounging experiences, but it's also a great time to enjoy a bustling, lively atmosphere; I don't avoid it.  Yes, the service becomes a bit sporatic and slightly rushed, but it's understandable.  Plus, of the dozens of times I've been here on weekends, I've never been as grossly neglected as a previous reviewer has been, so I'm pretty sure that it was an anomalie.  The servers actually tend to be very attentive, courteous and patient, so please cut them a little slack when things get hectic.  Also, while they're cool about people lounging around (non-peak times, not on weekends), the wait staff works on tip, so please be mindful to leave a bit extra tip if you linger a while... and it's definitely a very nice place to linger, and they'll gladly refill your tea-water (or in occasions, asked nicely, non-espresso coffee). I've been a long-time patron at Julius Meinl, and while I enjoy my Intelligentsia, Caribou, and other coffee shops, if I need to take my friends to a unique coffee house experience, I bring them to Julius Meinl; I never fail to impress.",0.997,0.781,0.179,0.04,0.5015281668222844

2006-07-20,5.0,"Far and away my favorite place to spend a Sat. morning in Chicago!  Hang on for this review, because I'm emotional about this place, love it, but when it comes to traditional things about which I'm emotional, the crotchety old German part of me is bound to show himself! First, Meinl is the big coffee from Austria, the land that invented the cafe- and many would agree that their coffee is perhaps the finest in the world.  They've served it to discriminating Viennese coffee drinkers for over 100 years and have cafes all over central Europe.  Then, Starbucks invaded Vienna!  The business that had preserved its history for so many years faced a new challenge, and it would seem that the Meinl mgmt recognized that part of meeting that challenge involved an American experiment- Meinl Cafe in Chicago!!! When it first opened I was convinced nobody would 'get' the Austrian Cafe concept, and Meinl would either compromise for Americans and act like Starbucks, or fail.  Thankfully, neither happened- this place hits the mark. The coffee is obviously delicious- after 140 years Meinl knows a bit more than those hippies in Seattle about such things.  I do wish they'd used all the standard Austrian terms for the coffee drinks here, I mean if we can handle ordering a 'Mlange,"" why can't I order a Brauner?  Alright- that's picking nits. They've added more true Austrian dishes on the menu slowly since it opened, and created them in a damn authentic way.  Frittaten soup is just as it should be, fried pancake strips that are light, and in a reasonably salty broth.  Soft boiled eggs are prepared just right- I'd love to see them offer 'two eggs in a glass,' that would be cool!  The pastry chef knows her stuff- even the Gugelhupf (it's a bundt cake) is good, and I don't normally care for plain old Gugelhupf!  Mohr im Hemd is something special- if you like chocolate, this is what to order.   They have lots of non-Austrian stuff on the menu too- the sandwiches are each awesome.  Yeah, the roast beef on the pretzel roll is my favorite- if only for that incredible roll! The servers are polite, quick, efficient, and friendly.  Exactly as how it would be in Vienna- except for the friendly part where we've outdone 'em! All of the Meinl brand stuff is shipped over for sale here too- coffee, jelly, tea, etc...  They even sell Powidl (Po-viddle)- spiced plum compote used in classic Austrian desserts- try it on a Belgian waffle- mmmmm.  Am I the only person getting this stuff?  I hope not.   Etiquette time- You'll note that your coffee comes served on a small silver tray with a glass of water (as it should).  As an edgumacated coffee drinker you should know that this serves two purposes- the obvious help it provides the server to carry those glasses to you, but perhaps more importantly, it keeps your wet water glass off of the often marble table top.  Be a good patron and leave your water on the tray where it belongs, a Viennese waiter would scold you for leaving water rings! So enough ranting, the place has great food, great drinks, and is a true Viennese cafe stuck in middle America.  We're really lucky to have it in Chicago. If I could change one thing, they'd have one weekend a month where the locals leave their ""adorable"" little fashion accessory kids at home so I can read my newspaper in peace and quiet, but I suppose for that I need to go to Austria where kids don't run 100% of their parents', and everyone around their parents' lives.",0.9987,0.783,0.185,0.033,0.5469258915687487

Stupendous coffee, tasteful gifts of coffee and jams and tea for the caffeinated snobs in your life, and a lovely space (inside and out). I wanna stay here for hours, and I wish I could eat their bakery treats. They look like heaven. I dare say my favorite coffee spot in town.",0.9169,0.739,0.226,0.035,0.875
