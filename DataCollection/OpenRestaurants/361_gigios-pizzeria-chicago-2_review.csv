Order any other type of food and your risk factor for dissapointment goes up significantly.  I have seen and heard through the grapevine that Gigio's is pretty bomb. I used to eat there back in the day and I do not remember it being so great. Did they change? So I decided to head there and check it out. Yeah it is the same crummy pizza that I remember. Nothing seems fresh, the Tomato Sauce has no punch, the Sausage is forgettable. It's not Sarpino's bad but it's just not good pizza.  Yet what's really bad is it could still be the best pizza in Uptown. Rosati's Pizza I don't even acknowledge as pizza, Godfather Pizza is rather vomit inducing. Can my fellow yelpers please name a decent pizza spot in Uptown?   Oh and for those claiming it's the best NY Style Pizza in Chicago I say Bullarky! That distinction belongs to Jimmy's Pizza Cafe. In addition to all this unpleasant crummy pizza talk a couple of the guys in the back were arguing/threatening each other about tips I think. Ehhh, the neighborhood is still not so great, the pizza is not so great so I shouldn't expect more among worker attitudes. If the pizza was great I wouldn't care but it wasnt.

The taste reminded me of Papa John's pizza, which led me to ordering another huge slice of it. Gigio's isn't a fancy pizza place, but it does do the job, and the place is decent enough to dine in at, but not big enough for big groups. I'm assuming most that order from Gigio's Pizzeria live in the Uptown neighborhood, and are long time customers. Most I'm assuming order takeout, or stop in while in the area, but for the looks of it; I don't think it gets very crowded.  As for pizza; Gigio's Pizzeria is one of the gems in the Uptown neighborhood, and looks like it has been around for years.  As for location, it sits within 200 meters from CTA Wilson, Harry S Truman College, and right on the strip next to Uptown Bikes.

However, the customer service sometimes is a bit rough around the edges and for some reason they always try to upsell me to a medium pie. I have to point out that a small Gigio's special is $16 and change and that I don't want to pay $20 for a medium just for myself. It means I can't really order on the phone because they just charge me for a medium. What leaves me truly incredulous is that in the end I get a medium sized pie anyways, even if I only paid for a small. I can't tell if they're hustling me or just have a good reason for refusing to make small pies. It is quite frankly frustrating, and gives me a bad feeling about the two guys who cook the pies.

This is not a place that cares about customer service - they tell it like it is and we deal with it - the pizza is that good. In 30 plus years I have never had anything but pizza there so cannot comment on anything else. Sausage is the best. Great prices and real cheese! This is not a first date place- your lucky to find a clean table, and it is usually filled with some scary people but overall worth it for the pizza. Its Chicago at its best and Uptown at its core.  We are worried with all the changes in the area, we hope it does not mean the end of Gigio's. I am in Real Estate and love change for the better, but I love to see history and landmarks keep their spot on our row of legendary streets. Fight to keep some of our spots by being good patrons and shopping/dining locally. Gigio's is a great start - do not be frightened by the outside or the less than clean floors (never use their bathroom), the kitchen is where the magic happens and you can see it is clean and the same people have been making the pies for literally decades - quality quality quality!

I've been eating pizza there since childhood (like my parents) and it looks exactly the same and the slices taste the same. the big MISTAKE that people make is ordering the whole pizzas, like the large, during certain times when certain guys aren't working. or when u see mostly females working.

I actually had to throw most of it out cause even my friend who's a bigger eater than me couldn't finish his portion. yep, that bad. so I talked to the big guy that's always sitting when running the register because I know him from constantly frequenting gigio's. and was told like I heard a long time ago the same thing: if he ain't here or so and so ain't running this or that it might be 'hummmm a little different'. the last part said with a wink and a laugh. it's the kind of place that if u haven't been there before and are going past it maybe to go to the army surplus store or the bike shop u might be scared away by the kinda run down decor. but you'll always see a good amount of people in it most of the time crowds. even in the blistering heat of the summer with only some old rusty shop fans blowing. the SLICES are that good",0.9877,0.825,0.126,0.049,0.42647415715597536

Not your processed brown balls like the ones you see on Little Ceasar's or Domino's slices. Pepperoni never has an aftertaste. They really do it right. The pizza's the main thing. If you ever want to branch out, the breaded mushrooms are yummy too.  In all the years I've frequented Gigio's service was great and we've always gotten our pizza steamy and hot. I miss those brown paper bags and the pizza/pop combo. It's true that it's not in the best neighborhood but like any place, you have to be aware of your surroundings.

It was crisp, but not all that tasty.  Third (and the worst), the mushrooms were canned. If you want to piss me off, throw some canned mushrooms on my pizza. I dare you.

2008-10-21,5.0,"Living in Lincoln Park and therefore usually broke, I discovered Gigio's Pizzeria when I went to register for school.  The pizza is cheap and amazing, perfect for someone like me, who likes a big greasy slice that tastes fantastic.  For cheese it's $2.60 and sausage or pepperoni a little more than that.  Sodas are 80 cents and the appetizers are also super cheap... my boyfriend and I had cheese sticks, garlic bread, and two enormous slices of pizza for $12, which would have been the cost of one entree at many other pizza places. The part of town is pretty sketchy, and I got hit up three times for dough by the same woman (the first time IN the pizza place, which I found a little odd, but hey, it's Chicago.)  There seemed to be a lot of crackheads around, but it is always worth the long bus ride north for me.  The Broadway bus will take you straight there (get off at Wilson) or you can get off the Howard red line stop. Oh- and if you're super hungry, no need to fret- the pizza, in my experience, has always been made very quickly.",0.9245,0.837,0.119,0.044,0.5173611111111112

2008-08-16,5.0,"This place gets accolades from my pizza-eating friends so I'm writing a review. My former coworker from New York said it was the closest thing to NY style he has found in the city. One time we stopped there in the company car so he could get some lunch to go, and the smell when I was driving back...omg did it smell good. He ordered garlic on his pizza. It was a rainy, cold day and the cheese and garlic and breadiness smell...I just reveled in it.  So you know how I try to be a vegan? I've been thinking about Gigios pizza since that day when he ordered it, probably about 5 months ago. I don't think about it everyday, but frequently, maybe once a week? Today I was in the neighborhood with one of my favorite people in the world. I swear I didn't even look at the place, and he said something like, ""oooh, pizza place."" After running our errands, and several diversionary tactics to preserve my vegan-ness, including trying to walk a different route back to the car that didn't pass the pizza place, his desire prevailed and I ended up in there. He somehow knew what I was going through and said, ""I'll order cheese"" (rather than his usual sausage). I more than willingly took a few bites of the pizza. He was so excited to eat the slice he almost burned his mouth. I watched him rapidly shift the bite in his mouth so he wouldn't get burned. This is the power of Gigio's pizza, some people risk injury in all of the excitement. The restaurant is pretty dirty but really I didn't care. The crust quality makes up for the appearance. If I were to suggest any improvement maybe a sweeter sauce but I am old enough to know I have strange taste, so 5 stars, for at least meeting high expectations.",0.9411,0.843,0.096,0.061,0.46498023715415016

My pizza arrived promptly and when the delivery guy handed me the box I was pretty sure they screwed up my order. There is no way that a small pizza could be this heavy. It felt like there was a rock in there and I figured they must have given me stuffed on accident. When I opened it I realized that the order was in fact correct. They just put about 2 lbs of cheese on it. OH HOLY HEAVEN, GIVE MAMA THE CHEESE! I sat down and enjoyed my cheesy goodness. The crisp on the bottom, chewy on top crust was good too but who cares about the crust when we have all this glorious cheese! Yeah I'd order from them again... and again... and again... ...but next time I'd skip the toppings because the flavor of the cheese comes out much more when there is nothing distracting you from it.",0.9835,0.781,0.182,0.038,0.5357638888888888

Rave reviews. Pizza. Perfect.  I put in my little order, and it arrived about 45 minutes later. (under the quoted time, apparently lots of peeps crave pizza on boring Sunday nights).  And I opened the box to a beautiful pie. A Gigio's special topped with mushrooms, sliced tomatoes, sausage and green peppers. Lovely. Just lovely...just what I needed to cap off the weekend and serve as my final bout of calorie-laden, carb-infested food. Definitely could've used a bit more cheese (of course, this is true even when a pizza is PILED with cheese, so hey), and a little more sauce (not much on there), but overall a grade A pizza pie that made me smile.
