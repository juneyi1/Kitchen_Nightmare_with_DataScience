Maybe next time I'll just ask them to go light on the batter, not sure if that would be a problem for them to make it that way but I sure will ask next time. The cole slaw was off from what we are used to, it tasted a little on the expired side (or maybe they just changed the recipe) one or the two. The French fries  were excellent and just the way we like them (not over cooked and just the right amount of salt).  We come here often but it had been a while since we last ordered the fish and chips. We do like the fact that they give us a 10%discount with the neighborhood discount card from Golub Connect.

I said, ""Where shall our third person sit if they come?"" She seemed genuinely perplexed so I said, ""We'll sit here"" motioning to the four top.  Our server was nice while taking our drink order which consisted of one mock tail.  As we sat for about 10 minutes without the drink or without placing our order, I waved to her as she was at the bar talking with the bartender and another employee. She turned away from me. When another waitress came out to join the employee conversation at the bar I waved again, she tapped our waitress and spoke to her trying to get her to turn towards our table and our waitress resisted?! I really couldn't believe my eyes, so I got up and went to their group and said we needed to order as it had been a while and I got a patronizing reply that she was waiting for the drink to be made.  Out third person did show up and we got the D4 burger, chicken salad and turkey pastrami sandwich. The turkey pastrami was more like something you'd get at a fast food restaurant with a pile of processed lunch meat on it and an overwhelmingly mustard based coleslaw.   With so many great restaurants in the area this will be my last time here.",0.8483,0.915,0.059,0.026,0.4458333333333333

2016-08-03,5.0,"This review is long over due as I've been coming to D4 for a few years now and it's one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago!  So many things to talk about but first things first... the food!  I've never been disappointed by a meal at D4.  I'm a former (long time) vegetarian recently turned meat eater and so I've enjoyed everything from the veggie omelette to the steak salad.  My absolute favorites are the grilled cheese bites (with fontina, smoked gouda, havarti, caramelized onion on sourdough), the french opinion soup, and the D4 Eggs Benedict which comes with corn beef hash (I was skeptical of this at first but after turning back into a carnivore after 16 years and taking my first bite of this benedict, there was no turning back... I order it every time I'm there for brunch now and it's amazing!).  And the breakfast potatoes are awesome, too!  If you're there for brunch and order something with toast, you won't want to miss their homemade jam. As for ambiance, it's one of my favorite things about D4.  The restaurant is very large and spacious and even though it's a casual and relaxed atmosphere, the decor is sophisticated and lovely- very visually pleasing.  They have a fireplace in the back room, which looks like a historic library/study and you can also rent this space out for private parties/events.  They even have flat screen tv's for the sports fans (although the place does not resemble a sports bar) and they are not overbearing for those who aren't interested in looking up at a tv screen.      The staff here is great.  Friendly, fast service.  Excellent drinks and in the winter they have an awesome variety of seasonal drinks.  If you like a good bloody mary, definitely don't pass that up... and you'll get all the works with it (almost a meal in itself)!  And speaking of brunch, on the weekends (when you can't get in anywhere else because it's so crowded) D4 will most likely have less of a wait time.  People wait in a huge line for Yolk across the street and I think most don't realize that only a few steps away is an even better and less genaric brunch.  Lastly, they have outdoor seating in the spring/summer which is always a plus in Chicago!",0.9978,0.769,0.2,0.031,0.49664285714285716

During the summer, it has a cute little outdoor patio where you can enjoy drinks and delicious food. My favorite item on the menu are the fish and chips. The portion is generous and the fish is on par. A lot of times when you order fish and chip, the fish is basically are batter. At D4 the batter is amazing, but there is plenty of fish! I also like to order the bread pudding. I usually have to get that to go because I'm so full by the end of the meal. The brunch is awesome too! I've had a few of their ciders, although I'm not a huge beer drinker. I'm a fan of their specialty cocktails though.

2016-06-11,5.0,"Been here twice so far (maybe a year apart?) and I loved it both times.  First time was dinner; this time, brunch with the Eating Machine (18yo son) on a gorgeous Saturday in June. We live down the street from Wildberry on Randolph, so that was our original destination.  9am on BluesFest/America'sCup weekend, so.... wait time was 1.5 hrs.  No thanks.  Walked up Michigan & then east on Ohio (&south on whatever [McClurg Ct?] cuz entrance is actually on Grand) to hit Yolk (one of their 6 gabillion Chicago locations) and knew in an instant the wait would be just as long.  (Neither place, while fine establishments, are worth a 1.5 hr wait in 90degree heat.  Trust me, I've eaten at both plenty of times.) Heading back towards Michigan, we saw D4 & their brunch sign.  The son was ready to chew off his arm, so he quickly agreed to D4 without even checking the menu. Hash & 2 Eggs for me; D4 burger w/fries for him.  OMG, the homemade hash!!! Corned beef hash, but not that mushy nightmare-in-a-can from my childhood.  This is yummy, tender, made-with-love REAL corned beef (that they also serve as a sandwich) mixed with diced potatoes ... as my son said, ""This is my new favorite restaurant!"" Really a great place. Although Yolk and (to a lesser extent) Wildberry are good places -- Wildberry's service has been less than cordial *every* visit ... and I'm ridiculously cheerful to waitstaff cuz I've been one -- from now on D4 will be our target destination, with Yolk as a backup.",0.9883,0.834,0.149,0.017,0.5344040404040404

Both the manager and even the owner were *really rude* (it was embarrassing!!): they were not happy enough to have all those people periodically but they expected them to order immediately (without even giving time to greet and introduce each other, and without making sure that somebody brought menus). Everybody ordered in average a full meal and a beer. After that, they started to demand money for the reservation and a minimum order per person (maybe 30$ or more...I don't remember...). The waiter the first time complained that she was not able to give individual bills. The overall feeling was just that we were clearly not welcome! Apparently the don't value or need loyal customers who periodically bring groups of people. So we found a better restaurant first and a more appropriate location later. I have never personally been there again...and never will be...! There are many other places that are less arrogant with better quality / price ratio.

2016-04-30,5.0,"My aunt and uncle have held a few celebratory events here: most recently a cousin's First Communion this afternoon. This time they had a reserved space in a separate room. The owner came by and checked on us, even before my aunt or uncle made it back from the ceremony. I thought that was a nice touch. He seems like a very nice man who is dedicated to his business and to his clients. The brogue doesn't hurt. ;) We had a party of 20-25, including children. ""Reserved"" placards and menus were already set out for us, as were cutlery, water, and water glasses. Waitstaff was attentive and service was on point. Our entire party (minus the kids, of course) was brought champagne to toast my second youngest cousin on her first communion. I'm not sure if my uncle set this up, but it was a great touch.

2016-04-24,5.0,"My lady and I were staying at the Hotel InterContinental Magnificent Mile up the street and were looking for a uncrowded upscale brunch spot after attending church at Holy Name Cathedral. We realized this might be challenging on Sunday downtown with nice weather. This proved correct as Yolk on East Ohio Street was a loud chaotic scene with a 45-minute wait, so we walked around the corner only to discover D4, which promptly became our new favorite brunch spot. They are billed as an Irish Pub & Cafe, but exceed that description. Here's why: We were greeted immediately at the door by a friendly host who found us a quiet table for two in a perfect spot out of direct sunlight overlooking the flowered landscaping. He seated us promptly and brought two glasses for chilled water, which came in a clear glass bottle with stopper, a classy touch. Our server quickly brought menus, which were clean, uncomplicated and organized, another classy touch. Clean tables, comfortable chairs with white linen napkins, yet more classiness. We ordered and our food arrived promptly despite the venue being busy, about two-thirds full. My lady had the vegetarian omelet with goat cheese and spinach, which came with home-style baked potato rounds and sliced avacado. All the ingredients were fresh and tasty, and she remarked that it was the best omelet she had ever had. I tried a few fork-fulls and would agree, it was excellent. I had the salmon eggs benedict, which was equally fresh and delicious, not fishy tasting and the English muffins were not Thomas store bought like at so many other restaurants. The hollandaise sauce was appropriate for salmon, creamy but not heavy, a balanced taste and not too much of it. The eggs were large cage free fresh and perfectly poached. I could easily cut through all the different layers which made eating it a pleasure rather than a chore. I've eaten a lot of eggs benedict and this is the best one I've had with salmon. We also enjoyed cups of coffee, a good quality brew that is not trying too hard by attempting to compete with the chic coffee house brands, which too many other breakfast places make the mistake of, not perceiving that you're there for the food and ambience. The coffee mugs were large white porcelain with indented middles that made them easier to hold, another thoughtful touch. My lady was impressed that they offered Pure Via natural sweetener on the table, and our server attentively refilled our cups twice. We never felt rushed, crowded, hassled or ignored as can so easily happen during peak service periods in downtown venues. The check was brought out promptly and the total bill was surprisingly reasonable for an expensive town like Chicago at about $36; we left a 25% tip, which we felt was well deserved by their whole team. I lived in the Chicago area for 20 years before relocating back to Buffalo NY and wish I had found this place sooner, which opened in 2007. Their chef is clearly talented, management knows what they are doing, and the staff is superbly trained. The setting is away from the crowded intersection and traffic noise, so you can have a pleasant conversation without shouting. D4 was nothing but excellent. For this experience, they earned a rare 5 stars from us and we will be back for breakfast as well as lunch. I would give D4's people a 6th star for their great attitude if I could.

We asked what the best thing on the menu was, and our server told us it was the chicken pot pie. We ordered a chicken salad, a chicken pot pie, a shepard's pie, some kids menu items, and drinks.  The salad came out first, and my friends noticed that the chicken tasted funny. They described it as old left-over rotisserie chicken on a salad. Seemed strange. Then we got the chicken pot pie, and it was horrible! It had this strange awful sour/metallic taste. We told our waitress and she simply said she would notify the chef. No apology for serving us a really bad dinner which was expensive; not an offer of anything else; and didn't take it off our bill! Granted, we ate half the pie, because we were hungry, and we weren't sure what the best course of action was, and we were slowly getting more disgusted with each passing bite. Finally we just decided to stop forcing ourselves to eat it, and when she came to take it we explained what was wrong. We felt certain that it was really old chicken in both the pot pie and on the salad. It's not like the server made the personal decision to serve old gross chicken, but as the face between the front/back house, she should have tried to make us have a good experience for a $100+ bill. The shepard's pie was fine, and so were the kids menu items (not too difficult there).  I have to give 1 star because we won't be going back. We had to pay $100+ to have a really bad meal with either old or rancid chicken, and we told them about it, and they basically acted like they didn't care. We went home worried about getting sick.

He did such a fantastic job of making sure our kids were happy. And when kids are happy, the parents are too ;).  Food is fantastic. The kids had chicken fingers, Mac and cheese bites And Tator tots with bacon and cheese. All came out hot and fresh. The fingers have to be the best in the city. My husband and a friend had the burgers and both loved them. I had a chicken chipped salad and it was also delicious. If you're the type who likes a lot of dressing, I recommend asking for more on the side. I found my salad a little lacking of the dressing but it's about personal preference. And I do recommend their ranch. It's delicious! My other friend had the pork sandwich and it was different and delicious. Different in a good way. The bbq was rich and flavorful. My husband got a beer with Left hand milk stout with chambord. That drink was so good. It was like a party in your mouth! I recommend ordering it!  And our waiter then brought out ice cream for the kids so the adults could have another beverage. This place gets it.

The smoked salmon caught my eye as it is difficult for my to turn down. It was served as three large swirls atop cream cheese and (here's the weird part) toast. I supposed this was an Irish twist but it was good nonetheless. Plenty of capers, tomatoes, onions and a hard boiled egg made this the perfect breakfast.

My mom was visiting town last weekend and since it was nice out, and would probably be one of the last nice weekends, we headed over to Streeterville Social just to be reminded they are not open during lunch time. Since we were in the area I recommended we go to D4.  Food: -I ordered, as I always do, the chicken tenders which are one the best I've ever had...granted I don't order them very often. The batter is a light beer batter, the chicken pieces large and juicy and they come with three dipping sauces which are delicious. For a side I ordered the roasted corn which was amazing. There is parmesan, paprika, green onion and other spices. Definitely something I plan to make at home now.  -My mom ordered the corned beef sandwich since the one at the table next to us looked great. You receive a TON of meat, I believe he said it is a pound. This was great but the real star was the side of brussel sprouts. The sprouts were tender and had brie and bacon mixed in.  Beer: -Good selection but nothing special. Did have a few Irish beers I haven't seen elsewhere.  Service: -Pretty good.

The meal choices were standard Irish comfort foods and were delivered with no great expectations.   Our assumptions were met and the meals were heavy on plain tasting fare. The negative in this situation was that the Main meals we ordered were delivered 1 minute after we received our starters!    I asked the server to return them as we were not even close to ready for them.      We then completed our starters all the while thinking that our Fish and Chips and Steak frites were sitting under a hot light deteriorating by the second.     The server during this upset was no where to be seen and no apology or excuse was offered.      All the while we were awaiting a duly requested glass of water again. The main meals were brought out again even though we still had our starter plates on the table and all hands were to the pumps to clear enough space to pack them onto the table.    Eventually someone did come and remove our completed dishes. Again, our mains were plain and simple comfort type foods that neither of us were able to complete. Our server was seen infrequently and the manager was seen once from a distance.   I don't know whether delivering all food as close as possible together is normal in Chicago pubs, but it was not our last experience of it to the point where we asked if we needed to do something differently. I am firmly of the opinion after this experience that these waitress/waiter staff are not formally trained and have no compulsion to secure customer loyalty.   The managers are oblivious to the needs of customers and disinterested in securing any level of satisfaction where a failure has occurred.

The food was nicely prepared, and along with it, I ordered a beer. There was little sign of the female waitress while I ate, which itself is unusual for bars/restaurants in the U.S.  She did on one occasion ask how was everything but only as she walked by my table at speed, which in itself showed that she had little interest in my answer. Prior to finishing my beer, she asked if I wanted coffee, or dessert. I asked for a second beer, to which she replied, that she'd get it and bring the check also. Is there a limit on 2 beers or is it just this particular waitress that  decides on what quantity of beer a customer  can purchase before being made feel they are unwelcome. Only for this bar has been highly recommended by colleagues, I wouldn't bother returning in the future.

2014-12-29,1.0,"It appears as though from reading other reviews that this place is a better night spot and I will concede that point. This is brunch related only.  **NOTE: I am writing this review after I've given myself since the 4th of July to digest the experience.  I often have a difficult time separating horrible service and an overall bad experience with the food served.** First the food: I had an Irish breakfast and it was about as standard an Irish breakfast can be with the white and black pudding and the eggs and the rest were done nicely with no real issues.  It came out fairly swiftly.  The Bloody Mary's were also tasty and I appreciate the hustle on the part of the bartender after seeing the back up of drink orders in his queue.  Now the service: the hostess was so bad and grating that I still remember her name: Elizabeth ... a barely 17 year old female with a power trip reserved for the VIP bouncer launching undesirables from his line.  From what I could assess, much of the morning business that day was Yolk spillover which is a few feet away and I can understand the want of control over the crowd ... but there was no crowd and plenty of space in the restaurant.  I'm usually a very pleasant person and I completely understand the challenges of working in the food service industry and I also know when someone is behaving inappropriately.  As we walked into the patio area and towards the hostess desk, we noticed two people leaving with odd looks on their face.  I walked up to the hostess (Elizabeth) and greeted her with a cheery, ""Good morning!"" .. as it was a pleasant morning with a nice leisurely stroll to Yolk only to find all of Chicago in line for a table.  Not wanting to wait, we decided to keep walking and find something else and we quickly stumbled upon D4. Her response was a curt,""Hi."" I then said, ""Uhm .. well, I'd like a table for two and since it's so pretty outside we'd like any one of the tables outside."" (There were exactly five tables open) She responded as if I kicked her puppy, ""Sir, THOSE are RESERVED for parties of 4 or MORE.  You cant HAVE those."" ""Woa - easy .. yikes .. not a problem - we can go sit at the bar area with tables .. do those have any minimum?"" She then shot back: ""No. Go ahead."" We then sat at a table, facing her and watched for about an hour how she greeted and spewed her venom to every couple that came through the door. At one point, I remember her launching this to a prospective customer, ""No sir, you can't sit out there, I'd LIKE to keep my JOB"" in the most sassy, vitriolic way. No one was spared her disrespect and hyper sense of power.  It was truly disappointing to see someone so young and so filled with  loathing for patrons.  I can't ever remember experiencing someone and some place with such an uninviting feel.  I would have liked to have stayed longer but we couldn't watch her behavior any more so we quickly finished our meals and thankfully headed out. Our actual server was nice enough but at that point any subpar service performance would be magnified by the fire-breathing gate keeper.  Our server was overwhelmed, harried and just not focused - I felt bad for her since it seemed they were short-handed yet, as I said, the restaurant was fairly empty at the time.  I was going to speak to the manager but felt that no amount of complaining at the time would have done much good because I didnt want money off the check nor did I want a complimentary anything ... I just wanted her gone.  But before I get someone fired, just like sending out an angry email, you need some time before you click send.  Six months is long enough. For the sake of D4 I hope she's been let go and if she happens to be the devil spawn of the owner, I pray that they take a more active role in her upbringing because she's down right awful and that kind of negativity hurts the synergy in all workplaces. I love Chicago and I hope to go back soon but I certainly will not go back there ... and if I can't get table at Yolk again, then I'll just keep walking.  We discussed writing a review early but it was much too fresh so I waited and gave myself 6 months to finally put this in.",0.983,0.755,0.14,0.105,0.509518447018447

2014-12-19,2.0,"So.  I won't deny that the food is delicious - especially their chicken tenders (though there are only 5 on a plate and it's $11.00) and curry chips, those are fantastic.  I do, however, have a bone to pick with their pricing and their service. The service has always been slow there.  I only forgive this because their food is usually on point. As for the pricing - A few weeks ago, my fiance and I went for dinner.  They used to have a Hanger Steak Salad on the menu, and recently took it off.  When my fiance asked about it, they said that they had ""replaced it"" with the House Salad, but that he could add steak to it for $6.00 and it would essentially be the same.  The House Salad, which is listed with the other entree-sized salads, is $10.00 without the steak.  So, my fiance opted to order it with the steak added. When the salad arrived, it was on an appetizer sized plate, and only had 5-6 slices of steak on it.  For $16.00, it was a textbook rip-off.  First of all, to say that the House Salad ""replaced"" the Hanger Steak Salad is incorrect.  The Hanger Steak Salad was entree-sized in the past, not served on the tiniest plate in the restaurant, and it had what looked to be 8 ounces of steak with it.  The waiter should have explained this when my fiance ordered it.  Even if he hadn't ordered steak with it, $10.00 for a side salad is absurd, to say the least.  Also, the service on this particular occasion was, as per usual, slow. I will credit them for allowing us to send the salad back.  My fiance ended up ordering something else to go, which is fine, but it would have been nice to have had a drink on the house or something, if for nothing else than the inconvenience.  At the very least, the manager could have come over to apologize or find a solution other than still charging us full price for everything, even though my fiance didn't get to eat his meal in the restaurant and had to bring it home.  We had already spent over an hour there, and had other plans for the evening that couldn't wait. Moral of the story, they could do with a customer service lesson.  We're not likely to return here, which is unfortunate because we live right around the corner.  Paying top dollar for slow service and tiny plates just doesn't seem worth it anymore.",0.8686,0.922,0.057,0.022,0.5210866910866911

2014-11-24,1.0,"We stopped in for a quick drink and bowl of soup during the Festival of Lights this past weekend. While the place was clean, and nice, most people were at the parade so it was relatively slow. Our waitress took 20 minutes to get our drink order - and that was after we walked to the bar to see 2 other servers just standing around - to ask for service. It was almost 30 minutes before we got served our drinks. When the orders came, the server didn't know who things to (there were 6 of us, but only 4 adults drinking). She was a very nice lady, but she had to be ""on"" something. She was so out of it. She kept pointing to the ONE other table she had as though that explained the horrible service, making off the wall comments, and generally seemed drugged. We were with friends who were also ordering for their children, so we asked for two separate checks BEFORE ordering. When the checks finally did arrive, they were mixed up, and there were additional items on the bill that we did not order. We asked for her to correct the items. After two tries, and nearly 90 minutes (I had one beer and a bowl of soup), the checks were still mixed up. We did actually want to seem some of the parade, so we were happy to pay the $70 bill just to get out of the restaurant. I'm pretty chill, but this was an absolute nightmare.

Mom ordered the same but ordered her eggs over medium--she prefers her eggs over easy as well, but gets nervous because most places send out over easy eggs super runny.

This establishment is pretty unique; it's got the allure of something out of River North (upscale, dark with oak furnishings) but with a cozy fireplace and far less twenty and thirtysomethings ripping shots. It's open late, which is wonderful for people who live in the area and need to get out of their own place to some work done (why does Dollop close so early?). While I normally wouldn't head to a full-service restaurant with a laptop, D4 isn't crazy busy on weeknights and they've welcomed me twice in the past week with no weird looks (thus far). Just note that there aren't many outlets available.  The service is wonderful - Zsolt is hilarious and super hospitable. Wifi works great. So far I've tried the grilled cheese triangles (nothing special), fries (delicious but not anything unique besides the enormous portion I received for a mere $3) and chicken fingers (yum!)(yes I am on a strict diet).

2014-08-30,2.0,"Sigh. If I wrote this review in 2010/2011 it'd easily get at least four stars but I think there was some kind of management and menu change and it hasn't been the same since. I'm only giving it two stars because it USED to be amazing.  I moved to the area in 2010 and my boyfriend and I would always grab dinner here and loved it. They used to have a type of pan pizza that would take about 20 mins to make and it was totally worth the wait but that's no longer available. They also took the sloppy joe sandwich off the menu which was stellar. Why fix a menu that was already on point?  We loved this place so much and didn't want to give up on it as our neighborhood spot but it's gone downhill, fast. The flatbread pizzas don't taste good. Ordered the fish tacos one time and there was a hair in it. They gave me a new one but still charged me for it, excuse me? Also didn't get any apologies, the waitress just said ""oh, let me get you a new one."" Also tried the grilled cheese with bacon and a side of tomato soup -- good lawd, they need to ease up on the salt in that kitchen. It was SO salty I felt like I was retaining water for days. The only okay things on the menu are the shepherds pie and the fish and chips. Now the change in management happened maybe 2 years ago along with the change in menu..theres a tall, blonde man that stands in the front by the hostess who not only dresses like a douche but is one. He runs around like there's a fire that he must contain but I just don't understand his purpose? We've gone in on several occasions where he was up front and we'd ask for a table for two and he'd put us on hold even though we look around and the place is more than half empty? The snarky attitude and arrogance I can do without. He is a total turnoff to the place and final reason we stopped giving this place our money. You're money is better spent next door at dollop where you can get a delicious sandwich, great service and a better atmosphere.",0.9925,0.779,0.156,0.065,0.5281168831168831

I decided on the veggie burger which came on a brioche roll and was served with shoestring fries.  It was really delicious and a perfect ending to a long day of being a tourist.  My friend ordered the bourbon glazed salmon, which came with quinoa.  We also had a side of mac and cheese.  Everything was very good, fresh, and cooked well.  For dessert, we shared the skillet ice cream sundae, which came with a warm chocolate chip cookie... so good!  Prices were pretty typical- definitely not inexpensive, but not overpriced for what you get.  If I was ever in the area again, I would definitely head back.",0.9956,0.733,0.261,0.006,0.5373611111111111

We were surprised at the sheer size of the entire restaurant/bar, and were quickly seated by a very friendly hostess. The restaurant had a very large seating area and looked very clean and modern. We were still reeling from the weekend, so we abstained from drinking, but it seemed like most people around us were ordering bloody marys that looked great. I ordered the hash and eggs, which was great. The corned beef hash looked and tasted fresh and wasn't too salty, the eggs were cooked perfectly, and it came with a further side of potatoes and a nice thick slice of toast with butter and jam on the side.  The service was actually very quick and efficient but very cold. I asked our waitress to see if they could change one of the TVs to the Wimbledon final on ESPN, which I hate doing, but our waitress said she would do it right away, and then totally forgot. Which is fine. I just took matters into my own hands and went up to the bartender, and he quickly changed it without a hitch. After that, however, our waitress was extremely inattentive and literally dropped off the check and didn't say goodbye or anything. She wasn't the friendliest waitress to begin with either, so I guess it wasn't totally unexpected.

I was there for a work event and the food took forever to arrive.  The food was sub-par at best. The sliders are mostly the bun while the meat is very minimal. The sliders didn't have much flavor either - presumably the buns covered up whatever flavor there was supposed to be. We also had some chicken tenders which were very very greasy. Thankfully the tenders came with actually a rather tasty sauce, almost like a chipotle ranch type sauce (I'm guessing) but it was pretty good. The drink menu was certainly overpriced and I wouldn't order drinks here on my own, but it was also pretty standard. Not a lot of Irish influence. The one drink that was superb and I HIGHLY recommend, the only reason worth even considering D4 is the grapefruit old fashion. The grapefruit is very subtle but they add a bit of peppercorn and it is a brilliant twist on an old fashion. Honestly, I may try making such a drink on my own now.

Lunch time, many open tables, around 11:30.  We were greeted by a warm, friendly hostess who left us with what was one fot he most uncomfortable, unenthusiastic wait staff I've ever had the misfortune of dealing with.  The waitress was short, older, and spoke with what was at first a pleasent accent, but later became a running gag as we realized how unhelpful and discourteous she was.  The first issue came from when we took our drink orders. I asked for a flight but indicated I would like the bartender, or herself to surprise me with the selection so I could try things I wouldnt normally order. I can see how this can be an annoyance, but this was the first time I've had someone flat out refuse. The answer was short, and curt, ""Here is the menu, you can pick your own if you want a flight"". Ok, not the end of the world.  Next, before we finished the drink order, we mentioned upfront that we would be needing separate cheques, they having previously done this for us before, we expected no resistance, but mentioned it nonetheless, to save surprise at the end of the meal.  ""No, we dont do that, store policy"". wut... We've eaten here 3-4 times, as a group, and never had this issue.  ""Well we can split the bill four ways, thats the best we can do."" 4 ways? Why not 2? Why not 3? 4 seems so arbitrary.. At this point I held back my order and just stuck with the single beer I had taken after I was put off to the idea of ordering a flight. Enjoyed each others company, enjoyed the food, but then when it came time to pay, and we provided the cards, the waitress had one of our party come over so they could ""Do the math together""  This isn't eh first time I've had this happen, so it wasn't a big deal until we checked our watches and noticed that our co-worker had been at the till, helping the waitress for more than 10 minutes.  Look.  I can understand being waitstaff or kitchen staff and having some issue with annoying customers. I've worked in kitchens. I've worked as wait staff.  What I dont understand is providing poor service in response to annoyance with customer requests. The environments in which I have worked have a higher standard than this, and choose their employees on both patience, and customer service. I empathize with this terrible waitress in having to deal with splitting a check, and having to take a few seconds to randomly select 5 beers rather than being able to select them from a preordained list.  What I dont understand and will provide negative feedback on EVERYTIME is her making her discomfit blatantly obvious, and making an unpleasant experience for paying repeat business.  Just a poor choice, and has prompted me to not only strike this establishment from my list of go tos for out of towners and visitors.",0.7599,0.825,0.097,0.078,0.48165266106442584

The food has always been good, but their losing major points with me based on the way me and my coworkers have been treated. Today we had a waitress with zero personality. I would have rather we had been serviced by a robot. She couldn't answer questions about the food, when my coworker asked for her to just have the bartender choose what beers would go into his flight she essentially said no, and to top that all off I had to spend 10 minutes walking her through how to split the check.  We went to this restaurants a few months back for another coworker's birthday lunch and they split the check across 12 cards. Today they said they could only split it between 4 cards. Ridiculous. I had to sit there with the waitress and calculate the amount to go on each card. She screwed one of the totals up and then told me that it had already run so it was too late to change the amount. Then she needed cash to split a $20 bill. The manager came over and I told him that we'd been able to split a check 12 ways last time we had visited. His response, ""Yeah...ok...""  No, not ok. If I'm standing there telling you that something is ruining our lunch experience at your restaurant, maybe try to fix the problem.  Rude service. Rude manager. I didn't leave much of a tip because, honestly, I did a good chunk of the waitresses job for her. It takes a LOT for me to not tip properly, but this experience was so bad...I couldn't support it with much of a tip. We won't be going back.",-0.9799,0.825,0.046,0.128,0.4876666666666666

They are also only $10. -SHEPHERD'S PIE: comes in a cute little pan, but the portion size is still generous! While this is a hard dish to mess up, thus version is still yummy. -CHICKEN SANDWICH: I'm not sure what this is actually called, but it's the chicken sandwich with bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato, & avocado on a cibatta roll. Yum! It's the perfect sandwich for when you're hungry but don't want to feel sleepy after eating. Comes with fries (the shoestring ones, which aren't that thin) and a pickle. At lunchtime (11-2 pm) they offer a half soup half sandwich option, and this is one of the sandwiches. You still get fries with them. -D4 BURGER: very satisfying! A good go-to item if you don't know what to order. -THAI SALAD: includes shrimp, huge portion sizes, loaded with delicious veggies. -FRENCH ONION SOUP: this one doesn't skimp on the cheese!!  Well-made, with the usual cheese layer baked on top of the large ramekin.  Yum!

On the not as good side was their brunch.  It's not bad, just not nearly as good as a bunch of nearby places.  Lamb stew was not good, but it may not be on the menu anymore.  Additionally, their cocktails are mostly not great (tried 3, liked 0), but I don't go to a pub looking for cocktails.

2012-06-30,5.0,"I happened across this place because the restaurant I was headed to, Yolk, was really busy and I wasn't in the mood to wait. Lucky for me.  D4 was just what I needed and the food was so much better, too. It was so pleasant to be in a well-run restaurant. The service was excellent and, having worked in restaurants for years, I picked up on the small details.  First of all, the greeter said hello as soon as I walked in.  The server promptly came over to the table with a smile and conveyed a sense of gratitude that I was there instead of, ""oh great, another one-top"" that I sometimes get in touristy areas.  He maintained his smile and made eye contact throughout his service. The woman at the next table over was a very picky orderer and a complainer, but I overheard her server handle it appropriately and with class while maintaining control of the service.  I could tell the staff was well-trained. Again, things you pick on when you've worked in a good restaurant. A large glass of ice water was served promptly and without asking on a hot sticky day, and refilled throughout.  Coffee was hot and fresh and refilled regularly, again without having to beg.  Although not needed, it was served with a teaspoon.  Beverage naps were used.  More details continued.  A choice of hot sauces were available.  The container and top were clean instead of nasty like they usually are in restaurants.  The salt and pepper shakers were full and clean.  I watched some drinks being served from the bar and they looked appropriately poured and dressed.  As for the bathroom, it was very clean, music playing gently but not blasting you out.   Then I saw the manager walking the floor keeping and eye on things and interacting with the front of house staff.  This guy clearly knows how to run a restaurant and it shows.  It has been a long time nice I've been this impressed with a restaurant all the way around. I haven't even gotten to the food.  This was late morning and I ordered an omelette and side of pancakes. The veggie omelette was fresh, moist but not runny, had the right amount of fresh tasting ingredients and melted cheese, and was very good.  It was served with a wedge of fresh avocado which was an appreciated nice touch.  The pancakes were pretty good but what impressed me was the large size of the side order and the fact that they were served with fresh blueberries and strawberries.  Again, it's the attention to details. I can't forget to mention that they have Carlsberg (and some other good ones) on tap.  That pretty much adds a star to any restaurant in my book. I will most likely be back next time I'm in the area and already had the opportunity to recommend D4 to someone else.",0.9986,0.773,0.215,0.013,0.5634186944008372

2012-02-26,2.0,"I had been looking for a nice upscale and authentic irish pub in the area for quite some time. I looked at reviews locations ratings and decided that D4 was someplace that I wanted to give a shot. My friend and her fiance had come to the city from out of town for the weekend and had decided to go to dinner together. Since I was the native I suggested D4 since I had not yet had the opportunity to experience it and her and I are both full blooded irish it seemed like a good fit. Upon finding the entrance located on Grand we entered to what seemed like a fairly popular saturday night pup with upscale decor aside from the odor which smelled of a stale bar (bleach water and spilled drinks). We were seated at a hightop and greeted by our server in a questionable uniform. He almost looked more like a conductor. We each ordered a beer (it is after all a pub) and started out with an intriguing Appetizer, Buffalo Calamari. Now let me just say that it was cooked perfectly and was a very unique and delectable approach to a common dish. However if you do not like the tentacles DO NOT order this dish there was only about 5 rings the other calamari mounded on the plate was all tentacles (Luckily I happen to love the tentacles). After scouring the menu and enjoying our spicy buffalo calamari we decided to order Fish and Chips, Shepard's Pie, and upon the servers recommendation I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie.  The Fish and chips were terrific (aside from the plating which could have been executed with much more finesse in my opinion when paying $16 for cod and french fries but that could be me) the fish was buttery and flakey, battered and cooked with perfection. The Shepard's Pie on the other hand was an ABSOLUTE abomination it was a cast iron dish full on a chunky gray soupy brown mush, there were however a few peas floating it. I have to say it was the most un appetizing thing I have ever had the displeasure to lay my eyes on and I'm certain Chef Ramsay would agree. My pot pie, though impressive in its stature fell short rather quickly. Beneath the beautiful and flakey delicious puff pastry was a gummy, gelatinous, bland muck. It was like eating dumpling batter but with less flavor. All of the portion sizes were ENORMOUS and none of us could finish our plates. The bus boys were ten times more attentive than our server who made us wait nearly 20 minutes after our plates were long gone and our drinks had gone dry. To my true disappointment I will not be returning here, all in all the most ""upscale"" thing about this establishment is it's the prices.

I tried their Fish and Chips and it was very good. Their hand cut fries are good but not worth the extra charge. Service was good throughout but the decor of the place doesn't do much for me. A lot of blank walls and on a quiet Monday it can feel kind of erie.  We didn't want dessert but our server did a great job of upselling us 2 desserts.

I love their $1 sliders - go with the angus beef with a nice selection of cheese (pepperjack, bleu, cheddar, etc.). For most people, 3-4 sliders is fine especially if you add the $5 appetizers like the curry chips or the tempura chicken tenders. Also, on Mondays after 5pm, you can get a full rack of ribs for $12 (come with cole slaw and fries). It usually takes a while to cook (30-40min after ordering), and it is dine-in only. But hey, if you're craving ribs, this is a great option - the ribs are very tender, though the sauce is slightly generic and sometimes heavy on the pepper. Overall, nothing too outstanding, but still a nice place to eat if you're nearby.  PS: Most of the time the service is great - they are usually very accommodating and prompt.

We were looking for a place not too far from Navy Pier, and stumbled across this restaurant while walking. We were seated quickly and had some really wonderful cocktails. Even though our table was a little secluded (behind a column outside) our server never forgot about us--he was around to check on us just often enough. We had some wonderful food--I had a portobella mushroom sandwich, I don't remember what others had--that came with great sides. Curry fries! yum! The bread that came out while we were waiting was also delicious, not the usual boring bread. Two nights later we were back, with a larger group of friends. They easily seated all 12 or so of us at a large round/square table, instead of the usual looooong table where you can't talk to everyone. We also happened to be there just late enough that they had a late night menu, which included flatbread pizzas, sandwiches, and other delicious looking things for only a few dollars each. Again we had delicious cocktails and several people enjoyed the beer list. Everyone enjoyed their meals (we were able to order from both the late night and regular menus) and we had wonderful service for the whole 3 or 4 hours we were there.

So when I did I must say it was not nearly as bad as I thought. As a seafood fanatic, I must say they have some pretty good beer broth mussels here. The beer they use is the Hoegaarden pale ale, in which they throw garlic, rosemary  and other spices. If your not into seafood the late night $1 sliders are a must. But what I really loved at this place was the mixed draft cocktails. My favorite is the Guinness and Champagne known as a Black Mimosa. OMG I love this. It's like drinking sweet Guinness with a little punch at the end. Also the cider with Jameson is a personal fav. There are a few other cocktails worth trying such as the Starry Night with the St. Germain and ginger beer, yum! The atmosphere is still kind of strange and confusing, giant elegant chandeliers hang above, but below on the floor are little black and white tiles. The bar is super old brown wood and nicely shined, yet the glass exterior is all modern. The place design wise doesn't really know how much it wants to be authentic Irish, or modern fusion Downtown Chicago. At least it's not super crowded with sports fan or downtown business types, luckily the seating is spread out enough so you don't notice even if it is.

The staff is friendly, they have great food, there are great happy hour and late night specials, the beer list is fantastic (draft or bottle), and the ambiance is great. We go here at least once a week and have for the last couple of years. They've had some turnover on some of our favorite staff members, but we haven't seen much, if any, difference in service or quality which we can't say for some of our other favorite places. Not everyone recognizes us anymore, just the few who've stuck around (mainly the bartenders). We never have to wait long, though I'll admit we don't go at peak times a lot. Even when it seems really busy, they're pretty good about getting you to a table quickly and you can always get great service at the bar if there's an open seat or two. Hands-down they have the best Irish food of any of the places around Streeterville. Better than Elephant and Castle, PJ Clarks and (especially) Timothy O'Tooles by far. But they have a lot of American favorites too including a great burger, tender ribs (only on Mondays now, which is sad) and surprisingly decent pizza. They've recently slimmed down and added a couple of things to their menu, which I've heard is because they're getting too busy (good and bad!). Some of the new stuff is really good, and we didn't really see anything missing that we really liked anyway. Basically, the place is always consistently good food-wise. I'm not sure what people are complaining about regarding the prices here. For what you get, this place is a really great value. It's $40-50 for 2 beers, two entrees and tip. I dare you to find anything comparable or better than that in River North/Streeterville. Beers are $6 ish, entrees run $10-15 unless you're getting steaks or fish, which is very fair in my book. Rockit? More expensive. Rock Bottom? Just as pricey, but not as good. Same with PJs, Timmy's and Elephant. Quay? More expensive and poor value for what you get, though they're working out the kinks. One of our favorite things about this place is that we frequently see the owner running around and chatting with guests. He really seems like he takes pride in the place and it shows. Semi-unrelated, we actually love this place so much that we had some of our engagement photos taken here.

The MAC AND CHEESE had great flavor and the perfect amount of bread crumbs.   The SIDE SALAD is the way to go with anything that comes with it.  Lots of different vegi's in it and great dressing options.  I got a mango vinegrette that was very yummy.   SLOPPY JOE was HUGE and tasty, but we saved it for lunch the next day.  After the BBQ RIBS that were more spicey than bbq sauce flavored, so I wasn't the biggest fan, despite the meat perfectly falling off the bone when you poke it with a fork. The BASKET of bread was a nice surprise too.  It came with a delicious honey butter and the brown rye bread wasn't overwhelmingly rye-ish (I don't like rye) and had raisins.  I loved it. HOUSE CABERNET is quite good. I'm not picky with wine, but I think they did well with that. The restaurant/bar is pretty impressive.  I would bring friends here on the weekend.  We were there on a Tuesday so it was pretty empty.  We sat in a cozy area near a fire place, but the high ceilings, endlessly huge bar and high top tables, and nice flat screen tv's everywhere make it a great place to hang. OH!  and the music  was good too.  Interesting mix of 80's favorites and chill contemporary stuff.  Also not too loud, but loud enough to enjoy.

Was drawn to the seemingly low open bar cost per person and no room/party fee.  Was annoyingly disappointed when our party arrived & the manager asked me to hand out the wrist bands and collect the money myself.  Seriously?   Then for our group of about 30 people they expected us to wait for one very slow working waitress to take our drink orders and bring them back herself.  At that rate everyone would have only gotten one or two drinks during our 3 hour open bar.  So I had to ask the manager again to at least get us another server or let us go to the bar. I did like the huge space and fireplace in our little corner and the owner did come by before leaving to make sure everything was in place (unfortuantely this was before all the problems arose).  Probably would be a good place to grab a beer, but service and organization is lacking here if you're trying to put together a party.",0.8316,0.852,0.101,0.047,0.5661111111111111

Their pizza is yummy.  Deep dish style with a crust and sauce and it's delicious.   Try the mixed berry cobbler for desert, it's amazing.  I've tried several of their more ""irish"" type of menu items and honestly didn't care for them.  Guess I'm not an Irish food type of guy and should stick to the more traditional stuff.  Portions are ample and the pricing is very reasonable give its location downtown.  Great beer and wine selections as well.  The service is almost always terrible here though.  To be specific, it's just very slow.  I can't say they mess up my order or anything but you'll wait forever for them to visit your table and refill drinks, ask if everything is OK, etc. And at the bar, forget about it, service can be painfully slow.  So bad in fact that I'm pretty much just getting the pizza to go now and skipping the whole dining in experience all together.    Honestly, there's nothing special about this place that would make me go out of my way to come here.  But it's a nice place to try if you live in or are visiting this part of the city.",0.801,0.779,0.129,0.093,0.602063492063492

It's always cold and fresh which you beer geeks will appreciate.  Last time in I had the Tetleys - I enjoy the smoothness and creamy head. I also like the crisp Trumer Pils (I like the glass it comes in too) ha..  Now for the food.  I typically go for appetizers and salads because it's an after work thing and we like to share. You can say chicken fingers are chicken fingers and I don't think I would ever order them anywhere else but I tried a companions once and they are really good here! Strips of tender white meat which are not greasy and have a really delightful, super crunchy & light tempura batter. Other nice  options include coconut shrimp, tasty mini pulled pork sandwiches and burgers.  There are more than several salads to choose from. I have enjoyed the blackened salmon a few times. It's pretty spicy so if you don't like it that way you can ask for it grilled too. They had a special salad in the summer which was my absolute fave - spinach, strawberries, goat cheese and candied walnuts.  YUM! Service can be spotty at times. I've had more good than bad. If the owner's there, he's an excellent host and makes sure things are running smoothly.  Enjoy al fresco dining & imbibing in the warmer months on their outdoor patio!

The weird brie and apple tart thing was kinda gooey and bland. The ""black and bleu"" sliders were pretty well-done, which just isn't really necessary, given how small they are.  The service was...decent. I had arrived first out of my group of 4 friends and I sat at the table for a good 10-15 minutes before anyone asked me if I'd like anything to drink. However, when we gained another person our server easily transferred us to a larger table, so that was cool.  The only thing that turned me off about this place - and turned me off in a BIG way - was that when I arrived at about 5:45-6pm on a Friday night and got seated...the place was CRAWLING with strollers and small children. I get that it's Streeterville and there are families everywhere. I understand it was still sorta early (even though Happy Hour is from 4-6 and I've never really thought 3-year olds and Happy Hours went together, by any stretch of semantics or the imagination), but...damn. I'm at a bar, I'm going to drink. There will most likely be foul language and inappropriate conversation for certain types of adults, much less little ears. So when I asked the hostess if there would be another table away from small ones, it wasn't because I don't like kids or that I was planning on table-top dancing; it was just because I figured that in a bar (in the US, anyway; I know things are different in the UK and Europe, but this place is in Chicago), with my group of friends, maybe sitting directly next to a toddler and a baby out with Mom and Grandma wouldn't be the happiest place for anyone involved. As it turns out, there were no other tables available at the time, so I accepted the table and got the stink eye from Grandma as she burped Little Junior for 20 minutes while I waited an eternity for some blessed alcohol. So, if you're in the area and you'd like a pretty good pint, head on in. If you're there during Happy Hour, be prepared to share it with the kiddies. If not, I'm sure a little table-top dancing never hurt anyone...seriously...",0.9934,0.825,0.144,0.031,0.5722360649686231

This place isn't all that bad.  The atmosphere isn't bad and more importantly the beer selection is above average -- but pricey in my opinion.  The one redeeming quality of this D4 is definitely their burgers, and for those of us that love sliders it's is excellent.  I recommend going to D4 for their happy hour (4-6pm) when they have dollar sliders and mini pulled pork sandwiches -- you shouldn't be disappointed.  Oh and their food is quite good, and especially their Shepherd's pie.",0.9918,0.746,0.254,0.0,0.5651515151515152

The Mud Slide and Black Russian were stiff shots but the Buttery Nipple was just way too sweet and I felt like I was drinking butterscotch.

The drink menu is decent and competitively priced --they have the standard macro brew swill but also some domestic and imported craft beers. The food is really hit-or-miss.  Before 6pm, they have $1 pulled-pork sandwiches that were surprisingly good, especially since pulled-pork isn't traditional fare at an ""Irish"" cafe. The menu didn't mention the happy-hour special, and unfortunately the server didn't either, so there another strike against the service here.  The only reason we found out about the special is that we ordered a serving of the pulled-pork, which was three sandwiches, and asked if we could add a fourth for an extra charge.  At this point the server said the burgers were a dollar each as long as it was before 6pm. For main courses, we ordered bangers & mash and chicken pot pie.  The bangers were decent, mashed potatoes & gravy was good, but the chicken pot pie tasted like it came out of your grocer's freezer.  On a positive note, the entrees were moderately priced at around $14 This place is decent for happy-hour appetizers and drinks, but I recommend staying away from the entrees, and I hope the serving staff and management can print up extra menus and greet guests more expediently.",0.9917,0.839,0.145,0.016,0.4935623516268676

I know places like to make things their own, and add a little zing...but usually they make that clear on the menu...and usually it's an attempt at making a classic more interesting, not just a really poor attempt like they don't know what they're doing.  My last order was indeed the Sheppard's pie and it was basically a bland wet stew of hamburger and veg with a dollup of unbrowned and unappetizing mashed potatoes in the middle. That's kind of typical of what I've eaten there thus far, and I'm disappointed.  It's an Irish pub, and I'd like some decent Irish pub fare.  Otherwise, the place is alright, and I will continue to go there for a beer and a burger before my movies...I'll simply ignore their attempt at the whole ethnic cuisine thing and concentrate more on the beer...and it'll do just fine.",0.9697,0.778,0.158,0.064,0.5380952380952381

But, I have to say I didn't learn any lessons the hard way, as the party was a huge hit. I really have to thank D4 and its amazing staff for everything. From the first conversation with Debbie at D4, I felt comfortable that they would be accommodating with all my requests and would make every effort to ensure a good time. Debbie made the planning aspect very easy. And, on the day of the party, when I was stopping by delivering cake, decorations, etc., everyone at D4 made sure that I felt comfortable that things would go smoothly. Of the 50 or so people that showed, not one had any complaint. In fact, everyone had only the best things to say: the food was great, the service was great, the atmosphere was great, everything was great. And, I have to second those compliments. Rarely am I impressed with bar food. The food there was delicious: chicken fingers, sliders, spinach dip, shrimp skewers, crabcakes. We have some picky eaters in our crew, and not one person didn't love the food. It was quality. The drinks were good, no skimping on booze. And, our waitress (Marsha, I believe) was a saint. She was like Urlacher on the football field. I mean, whenever you needed a drink, there she was. She must have a twin! No one had to wait long for anything. What great service. As opposed to at least one review on yelp, I thought the music was fine. Most of us are over 30... so, we liked some of the throwbacks. But, there were some in the group younger, and no one had any problems with the music. As far as atmosphere, I also saw on yelp an issue with it being stale according to a yelper or two. Really, again, no one had any issue here. I actually was thankful that the space was clean, new, open, and felt that despite the newness, there was a charm to it. I have taken issue in the past to some sterile spaces, as a lot of new places in the city lack the charm of some of the older establishments. But, I don't believe that D4 fits into any staleness category whatsoever. I think it is quite telling that 3 weeks after the fact I still have people saying how good the food was, how nice the people were, and that overall, they had a great time. That says a lot.

2008-04-02,4.0,"Ok, maybe it isn't authentic, but if I just think of it as a neighborhood bar that serves food, I like it. My wife and I have a place nearby and we finally wandered over for a late weekend dinner. The bar area was pretty full but the rest of the place was pretty empty. We sat at a table next to the famous fireplace. The draft beer selection was good and all the food we ordered was perfectly servicable. We tried an apple brie appetizer which was heart attack inducing but solid. My wife's french onion soup was acceptable. Her pear salad was on a tiny plate, but seemed fine. My cheeseburger with mushroom was fantastic. The burger was really the medium rare I ordered. Service was good, but then again there were only two other tables in our area for one waitress. I wouldn't venture across town for this place, but if you live in the area, check it out.",0.9861,0.757,0.209,0.035,0.6119565217391304
2008-04-02,3.0,"When I think of an Irish Pub, I think of small spaces, dark brown wooden walls, clusters of tables, and dimly lit lights.  When I stopped in yesterday to meet my friends for happy hour, I felt like I was walking into a galleria mall that was a tad bit too modern.  The ceilings must have been 30 feet high and the population density of tables to space was pretty low.  Based on first impressions, I don't know if I could see this as my Irish let-it-all-out-and-go-crazy type of drinking establishment.  Maybe I will have to try it another time. One advantages is that the beer list was excellent and the prices were not over the top.",0.9433,0.787,0.167,0.045,0.44809523809523805

I guess if you're a suburban transplant, or tourist - it will hold some appeal.  Otherwise, it's only good for a quick after work drink.

2008-01-29,1.0,"No, no, no, no. This place is no good.  I went to an event here for the holidays (actually after-but it was supposed to be a holiday party). It was very poorly executed. When I arrived I was ushered into a line for food. The food was set up at the door. So, you walked in from the cold and stood at the end of the line, right by the door and the food. The line went all the way to back of the bar and looped around. While in line people came around with appetizers, which turned out to be the same stuff on the table that we were waiting in line for. The food was not good. Chicken tenders loaded with grease, mini veggie sandwiches soo bland they were uneatable and mini burgers (which I didnt try as they came on rye bread, they ran out of buns). The event was not successful. Some people stood in line for over an hour, they ran out of food and it was impossible to get a drink while waiting in line.  I don't think I will be taking my business back here. I felt the food was awful and the lack of planning for an event with over 400 people was not a good reflection of the establishment.",-0.5881,0.847,0.061,0.091,0.6049365079365079
2008-01-19,3.0,"I finally made my way over to this upscale Irish pub last night. It was a little more than half full on a Friday at 10ish. I had read the previous Yelper's reviews and knew I wanted a spot by the fireplace on such a treacherously cold night. Surpisingly the whole area was free and we were seated there immediately! With this, my cold tush is already impressed.  I had also read about all of the nice beer selections, so I let the waitress offer some suggestions. I decided upon the Chimay Red. Tasty beer! Plus it came with it's own glass. (Yes, I am easily impressed.)  The service was ok. We never had an empty glass, but then again the bar was empty(ish). It just seemed indifferent, which I have been experiencing a lot these days. Granted, she did chat it up with me while my friend was in the washroom, but I still wasn't wowed.  The atmosphere is nice enough. I like the chandeliers and the large booths. Clearly, the fireplace won me over as well. One big detraction from the setting was the lighting. It was so bright that I was practically squinting. I think this was caused by the large floor to ceiling windows that open onto Grand Ave. They need to either turn down the lights or cover the top section of windows, which were filthy anyway, with window valences.  I will probably come again and even recommend it to my guests. I wish I could give it 3.5 stars, but maybe I can bump it up to a 4 when I actually come to eat and not just drink.  IMPORTANT: Remember, the entrance is on Grand Ave, not Ohio like the address would suggest!",0.9943,0.775,0.197,0.028,0.5908390022675737
2008-01-17,3.0,"I would give it more like a 3.5 stars.  A couple of my friends and I went there after a late afternoon/early evening movie at AMC River East 21.  What is nice about this place is that it gives you another option than PJ's Clark.  So kudos for more options!  They have a GREAT beer selection and the menu is typical of Irish grub.  I did have a pulled pork sandwich ( I don't think you find too many of these in Ireland, but oh well...) It was fare...Not over the top fabulous, but good.  The space is nice and airy and of course like good ol' Chicago fashion..plenty of Tv's!  The best thing about this place is that another option in this area!",0.9903,0.72,0.28,0.0,0.5964285714285714
2007-12-17,3.0,"Pretty good for what it is. The food was better than standard bar food.  I had an excellent fish and chips, my bf had a cheese burger.   The cheese burger was a little dry, but my fish and chips was excellent.  Hand battered.  Not the frozen kind that's mushy inside.  They had different fries for each of our dishes.  My fish and chips got hand cut chunkier fries.  His burger got skinnier crispy fries. Beer lovers would really like the choices available.   Since I am not really a beer drinker, I cheated and had a beer that practically tasted like blackberry juice.  The decor is Irish pub like, but very new, spacious and clean.  I would go there again, definitely for the fish and chips.  It's in my neighborhood and so far the other places that I can get a burger is Charlie's at Navy Pier or Timmy O' Toole, neither is that nice.",0.9905,0.68,0.264,0.056,0.5832954545454545
2007-12-09,1.0,"We went there a couple days after it opened - it was full but not crowded.  Our waiter clearly did not know the food menu, did not know the beer/alcohol menu, and was poorly trained to say the least.  We waited 20 minutes for him to take our drink menu.  He couldn't answer any of our questions about the beer and then went on to say they had no more glasses for water so we would have to buy bottled water if we wanted water.  (we saw glasses of water being served at other tables all through the night.)  He would not take our food order even though we were more than ready to order at that point.  Another 15minutes before we got our drinks and he finally took our food order (again, couldn't answer questions about basic stuff - portion size, etc.)  They brought out my dessert first - the trifle - which was just cubed pound cake, berries, and cream.  Another 45minutes before we finally got our food.  The table next to us gave up and left.  The waiter apologized and said they were having issues all night because the kitchen was too small for the size of the menu and they only had two computers for the whole restaurant so the wait staff had to wait for a computer to open up to place orders.  My drink, one of the special mixed drinks (cranberry juice based) was bitter and disgusting - the whole table thought it was the worst drink they've ever drank.  I got some extra cranberry juice (which he charged me for) which helped decrease the bitterness.  The food - I got the wings, my companions got the chicken sandwich x 2 - was OK.  The wings were oily, chewy, and not very flavorful.  The chicken sandwich was good but cold by the time it came out. We were there for over two and a half hours - for mediocre food and terrible service.  No apologies from managers (as a matter of fact, no mangers were seen on the floor - the person at the front door said he had less power than a wait staff).  No offer to take things off our check, nothing.  Just excuses and annoyance from the clearly frustrated waiter. A few days later, another friend went there and reported back that their menu had been slashed - they got rid of most of the stuff on the food menu and now only a page of stuff remain.  That's probably for the better because people should go there for the drinks - not for the food.   Pros:  ambiance, location, big selection of beer Con:  undertrained staff, poor management, long wait time for food, mediocre food, bad service",-0.9663,0.823,0.069,0.108,0.5103850050658562
2007-12-01,4.0,"I was utterly impressed by the coziness of this upscale Irish pub. The initial impression of a library is not necessarily a bad thing. Grab a booth by the window for people watching or stake out a booth by the fireplace for a more intimate setting. BTW, you can actually hear the person across from you. I visited D4 on a first date- and we both enjoyed it. And I agree with Vidya, this place doesn't feel like the standard smokey pub. The attentive service was a little touchy-feely but always ensured my pints were full. The menu really stresses the mixed beer varieties (black & tan, snake bite, etc.) but the bar ""ran out"" of Dunkelweizen on opening weekend! And you can check out the decent selection of Irish whiskeys and single malts if that's your flavor. The food menu adds a bit more flair than run of the mill bar food. FYI the Brie and amaretto-infused Apple ""kettle"" is uh-may-zing! The personal deep dish pizzas are also good, well perfect for me since I prefer a little less crust than Gino's or Lou's. Think more cheese instead of sauce for this variety. Also, the street address is deceptive. The entrance to D4 is actually off Grand even though the address is Ohio.",0.9708,0.836,0.137,0.027,0.4338259441707718
2007-11-21,4.0,"I'm really glad this place just opened, because this neighborhood generally lacks comfortable pubs that are not filled with tourists.  I don't know if it will stay that way, but so far I'm glad there is a place just across the street from home that has a comfortable pub atmoshphere and a very good beer selection. Other than the fries (which are really good - nice and crispy) I haven't had the food here so this review is more about the pub.  The bar feels cozy and personal, even though it is big and open and inside a modern glass highrise building.  There is a fireplace, the music is not too loud, and the service has been very good so far.  It has a high potential of becoming my standard neighborhood pub where I can go after work or hang out with friends on a quiet evening over a couple of nicely poured beers.. So far so good, I hope it doesn't turn into a big tourist stop for people going to Navy Pier.",0.9932,0.748,0.238,0.014,0.6623563218390806
2007-11-15,4.0,"Well, this was probably one of my most anticipated restaurant openings since Alinea.  Part of this is because every single day I walk by this place and I waited with baited breath for it to be open and me to have one more place closer to my house to reduce the drunken commute I often run into.   That being said- my expectations were high.  Very high. The service was really, really good.  But we were the only people in the place and there was a front and back waiter and a bus person.  It was such good service it was almost like we were in a fishbowl and they were watching us eat. Kind of creepy. The onion soup was possibly the best I have ever had(sorry mom) but my salad was small and kind of sad looking.  It made me wish i had ordered a side of fries instead.  The boyfriend had the D4 sandwich and he loved it.  Banger, kraut and Swiss cheese on bread.  A hungry man's delight. It is a really nice, clean looking place that is still putting the finishing touches on everything.  Definitely more of a pub atmosphere then a restaurant, the tables are not set up for long term dining. just long term drinking so you don't notice the discomfort factors.  And vegetarian's beware- this is a meat heavy menu and the salads are not really entree sized.  I will be interested in giving it a go for brunch.  They have a bunch of things that sound so fun that I have been raving about them pre opening for weeks.   Pigs in a blanket- two bangers wrapped in Swedish pancakes.  Love it.  Even if i will never eat it due to the bangers- it still makes me giggle. This is a great addition to the neighborhood and will definitely be a nice stomping ground for a drinking brunch or a Friday after work.  Just probably not for a lot of actual meals.  But who needs food with all the stout beers they have on tap!",0.9973,0.784,0.204,0.012,0.5759201680672269
