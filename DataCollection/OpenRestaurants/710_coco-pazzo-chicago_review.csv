The menu is quite broad and there is certainly enough options for any palate.   COZZE - the mussels were fresh, large and plump.  The broth was so good we had to get every drop.   BARBABIETOLE - My husband loves beets and his salad was so fresh and the presentation was very nice.  He kept raving about how good it was.  CACIUCCO - We had not seen this on CP's menu before so this was a very nice addition.  The seafood was fresh, plentiful and the fairly spicy broth was delicious!  My husband said it was the best he has had in a long time.   FRUTTI DI MARE with squid ink spaghetti.  Again, the shrimp was very fresh but the pasta was actually under cooked and a little hard.  It also lacked much flavor.  I asked the waiter about the entree and he said it was actually different from the recipe from the original CP.  I mentioned a tomato sauce and he offered to bring a some which was delicious.  I ended up adding it to the entree and it made it taste so much better.  I really hope they bring the other recipe back.  I seem to recall the other recipe had linguine noodles too.   Tiramasu - We were going to decline any additional food but the restaurant graciously provided a surprise dessert which my husband loved.  A great way to end the meal.   Overall, we are thrilled to see Coco Pazzo back up and running.  We missed them during the remodel.",0.9988,0.71,0.267,0.022,0.5396164021164022

I started off with the crudo, which was refreshing although the sweetness from the fruit and sauce were overwhelming. My friend started with the diavola pizza which once again was good but not outstanding. I ordered the duck for my entree. I order duck anytime I see it on a menu and this dish was well composed, but nothing memorable. The duck was succulent, but that might've been the only stand out part of that dish. For desert we finished off with the cheese plate and the panna cotta. The cheese plate was just as good as any other cheese plate i've had in the past year, but the panda cotta was incredible.

Service was fantastic although the waiters went through the specials very quickly haha.  My friends and I split: - Mozzarella di Bufala: so yummy, especially with the fresh tomatoes and arugula. Only thing I would have changed was to have it less salty; it wasn't overly salted, I just like things less salty. - Crudo di Salmone: my favorite! Loved the combination of the sweetness and tanginess of the orange with the smokiness of the salmon and the fresh crunch of the fennel.  - Guazzetto di Cozze: what's not to love about steamed mussels? The tomato sauce is amazing, super savory, and great to dip your bread in! For my entree, I got a swordfish special. Perfectly sized portion that came with grilled onions and lentils, and probably other things that I'm forgetting. I'm a sucker for lentils, and absolutely loved this dish! I also got to try my friend's malfatti fiorentina. Super rich and delicious! I would recommend getting the appetizer portion (3 dumplings) because I think this would get pretty heavy after a while.

Everything from the hostess to the waiter to the busser. Plates are always cleared, drinks are always refilled, they really make you feel like they are serving you. It's really great. As far as food goes, we (as in a group of ladies) ordered two different appetizers, tried many drinks, and many different entrees. We all were very pleased. The portions are perfect, the pasta is clearly made fresh, nothing is over seasoned or not made to perfection. It's the real deal. The desserts were equally as good. I recommend the tiramisu. Also, before the meal they come around with a bread basket (literally, a huge basket filled with all different kinds of bread) and ask each person what kind of bread they want.

The manager walked to every table around us spending half an hour (not exaggerating) each talking and laughing, and then as he come to our table we smile and look at him and he awkwardly makes eye contact says hello and walks away. Now, are we spending as much as the table of ten or the table of two who bought three bottles of wine, no, but to not even ask how is everything, or hows your night been...not a good way to save face.

I went with a friend and we didn't know there was a dress code so he was very underdressed and I was a bit underdressed.  Nonetheless, we were treated very amicably by the host and were seated immediately. I ordered the antipasti and the squid ink pasta fruti di mare.  Both were absolutely fantastic.  The antipasti was very traditional and had a great variety of different meats, veges, and cheeses.  The squid ink pasta was also very flavorful and the seafood in it was cooked to perfection.  My buddy had the gnocchi with red sauce and he also said his was great.  All the food was very fresh and cooked, seasoned to perfection. This is a pretty classy place so I'd suggest dressing accordingly.  Most of the people looked like they had come from the office in blazers and ties/dresses, etc. I was so close to giving this a 5 but I have to stick with a 4..

I was headed to drop her off at the airport after lunch so we were not dressed appropriately. We were surrounded by business suits and nice dresses and BAM.. me with jeans and large piece of luggage. Strike 1. The restaurant is beautiful and you can tell everyone involved with the food does not view this as just a meal, but an entire dining experience. They want you to savor every minute and every bite. I love this! I belong in Europe. Our waiter gave us a breakdown of the menu and we started with the Mozzarella di Bufala appetizer. This was simply just fresh cheese, roasted tomatoes and arugula but this came from the GODS! But let me mention. So many people at my table. Someone serving bread, someone serving the dish, one actually plating the dishes for us, our waiter, someone for water. What is happening? Am I royalty? Did I miss this memo? Confusion galore. Strike 2.  So many pieces of silverware on the table. Which do I use? Naturally, the one closest to the food = instant gratification. Strike 3 for me.  My mom and I split the Pici ai Funghi e Asparagi with forest mushrooms, green asparagus and basil pesto. The pasta was perfectly cooked, a little al dente which is exactly how I like it. More people at the table. More confusion. We also shared the Ravioli di Zucca. There were only 4 small pieces of ravioli but they were pillows of delight. Stuffed with butternut squash puree filling with sage in a brown butter sauce, this was easily the best pasta dish I've ever had. My mom and I even made attempts to lick up the remaining sauce with our spoons. I would have poured this into my mouth from the bowl if I didn't have so many strikes already against me.  Our waiter overheard that it was my birthday and brought us a cookie plate with a candle! So cute and very thoughtful. I devoured the biscotti within seconds and packed up for my lengthy train ride to the airport. Easily one of my favorite dining experiences in Chicago.",0.9943,0.809,0.149,0.042,0.579679802955665

2014-04-10,3.0,"I hold them to a much higher standard than I would an 'ordinary' Italian restaurant, given the prices and presentation. OK here we go: Overall it was good but some glaring, non-authetic faux pas were: 1) the waiter pronounced ""bruschetta"" as ""brushetta"". Hello, this is not Olive Garden. I corrected him (it is pronounced ""brusketta"") and this pezzo di merda insisted on continuing to call it ""brushetta"". Fortunately I was not paying for the meal or I would have cut several bucks off his tip just for being a cazzo about it. 2) I was also offered grated cheese on my seafood dish. I'm willing to forgive this a little, as perhaps the clientele doesn't know any better. But you NEVER put cheese on your seafood. Not if it is authentic Italian food. 3) What the menu sold as ""pappardelle al cinghiale"" was NOT wild boar sauce; it was surely made with short ribs. I effing know my cinghiale and that sauce was not made with boar meat. A more honest menu would have added the word 'style' somewhere. Ok it wasn't all bad. The antipasto was excellent, all of it. I liked my black squid ink pasta. My steak was good. The espresso was very good (many American Italian-style restaurants fall down on the espresso when the rest of the meal is acceptable). The wine choices were very good, though I'm not from Chicago so paying nearly $20 for a glass of wine that's not even a reserve gave me a bit of sticker shock. Would I return? Probably not at these prices. When I go to an expensive Italian restaurant that puts on airs like being the authentic thing, it better be authentic. By that standard, Coco Pazzo is hit-and-miss. If you don't mind dropping a few bucks in a nice joint and don't particularly care how authentic it is, then... sure why not.",0.9891,0.803,0.151,0.046,0.4888636363636364

But, there were plenty more. The menu is extensive and has lots of variety, meats, fish, poultry (even Quail) and several vegetarian options. Their minestrone soup was wonderful, and different than I'd ever had. It had a greenish tinge which I believe was due to the addition of fresh spinach and no tomatoes. It needed a little salt and that made it perfect. The bread was wonderful - crusty and freshly baked.  For the main course, I had a spicy seafood stew. Calamari, shrimp, scallops, clams, vegetables and a poached white fish in a fish broth. The broth was a little salty, but the rest was outstanding. The desert menu looked fabulous.

I can dig both and there's a time and place for each type of food.. When we first arrived to Coco Pazzo, the waiters were rushed and and they even rushed us to order.

Our Italian server was very knowledgeable and made good wine recommendations, and the busboys were very courteous and attentive. The owner or manager, who was also Italian and very friendly, was on the floor and checked up on all the tables more than once.  I was, of course, absolutely happy with the food. I love the way the busboys come around with a basket of three different bread options; we selected the focaccia, which was good on its own.  We had the appetizer portion of the Tagliolini Neri, which we definitely enjoyed. If we didn't have a large entree coming, I would have loved a full portion.  The centerpiece of the meal was the Fiorentina, which I had been craving occasionally since I went to Florence last year. They do the Tuscan thing and slice it tableside for you. It is, of course, not chianina beef, but it was still absolutely divine. They serve it with arugula, which is a great palate cleanser in between bites, and we also got a side of wood-roasted mushrooms, which was the perfect choice. For dessert, we had the Crostata (chocolate caramel tart) and the Fondente (flourless chocolate cake).  They were both good, but we both preferred the latter.  We also had cappuccinos, and I will say that their cappuccino was the best I've had in the city.  Even my man, who is not normally a fan, thoroughly enjoyed his cup.  We left very full and very happy.  I am so happy to have found an authentic Tuscan restaurant in the city, and we will definitely be back to try their other dishes.",0.997,0.775,0.218,0.007,0.5857326007326008

We started off with two appetizers, the chicken liver and the mozzarella with tomatoes. The chicken liver was pretty good, very rich and creamy, though not the best I've ever had. I really liked the mozzarella which was super fresh. The entrees were solid but not amazing. I had the squid ink pasta. The pasta was firm and cooked well, and the seafood in the dish was tasty though a little salty. Some of us had the Tuscan seafood stew, which tasted pretty much the same as the squid ink pasta. The ravioli was also very rich and buttery, though the meat inside was slightly dry. Dessert was one of the highlights of the meal - we had the flourless chocolate cake which was amazing!

But if I'm going to pay as much as I paid at Coco Pazzo, I expect some deliciousness. My boyfriend got the pizza, which actually was pretty good, if not very authentic. I got a pasta, orecchiette with sun dried tomatoes, asparagus, prosciutto, and a touch of cream... can't go wrong, right? Wrong. It was not a touch of cream, it was a ton of cream; and I had to pull out the pound or so of sun dried tomatoes that was in there.

2012-06-21,4.0,"I'm a fan who will only treat myself to this place for special reasons.  A little pricey but very very good. My husband took us here for our 1 year anniversary dinner.  And a good choice it was.  We dressed the part since it stated dressy on the reviews but I assure you if you dont show up dressed up you will still fit in.  Most people just wearing a sports coat or button down shirt.  But we still fit in and looked very good.  Kind of felt like I was sitting in a room of people who are somebody that I had no clue of.  Or I should be bumping elbows with someone who is a celebrity or something.  But no celeb when we were there, I wouldnt doubt that they know about the place. I was a bit disaapointed that they sat us at a 2 person table in the middle of the room, mainly because this is where all the servers are getting in and out to the other tables in all directions.  So it was distracted to always have someone whipping right behind me with dishes and carts dashing by.  I was afraid to wear something or get knocked in the head since it was tight.  Luckily it didnt happen but I kept eye balling the open 4 person table on the window wall.  WIsh I just asked for it.  So if you never been and you go, make sure to request a table anywhere else other than the middle of the room.   Once seated our server came up right away.  I had two drinks for the night, both were martini's which I dont normally drink but they sounded so good.  Dont remember what the first one was, maybe pear....maybe not....but the second was watermelon.  They were both very very good. They come up with a bread basket and you choose out of 3 or 4 styles of bread.  I took one of each because thats how I roll and I had it twice.  Mmm MMMm good.  For a appetizer I ordered off the dinner menu for pasta and braised rabbit.  Never had rabbit but though since it's small portion inside the pasta why not try it, besides it came as a appetizer.  It was sooooooo good.  My husband got a salad, which I normally would say for on the boring side but this salad was very tastey!  I also ordered a risotto.  They didnt have mushroom risotto on the menu but made it for me anyway.   I never had a risotto, I know what rock had I been hiding under?  It was soooooooooooo good too.  Both these dishes I should have ordered for the dinner itself because I just wanted more of both.   For the dinner, my husband always laughs at me.  Because I can be at a restaurant that is known for one thing and I just always order something there not known for.  Now I am a huge fan for real good Italian food but here I go and order the steak.  My server convinced me with his good words.  Why did I listen.  It was a great steak sure, but 1) I am a 5'10 in 5' heels 135 in a tight red dress trying to fit this giant steak in my belly.  I got so much attention not only because of my dress but because of my size trying to eat this steak.  I probably would have had a better chance if I didnt order a pasta dish and risotto for a appetizer and have a second order of bread.  So I was full quicker.  I was trying to impress but I was making myself miserable trying to finish it.  My husband just convinced me to stop eating so we can enjoy the rest of the night.  So I did.  It hurt so good though :) To full for dessert, bummer.  But I would love to go back there again.",0.9989,0.765,0.193,0.042,0.5461178369652946

2012-02-27,3.0,"Coco Pazzo is an upper scale Chicago experience, catering to the theater crowds with the earthy flavors of Tuscan Italian food. What do I mean by ""earthy""? Lots of rosemary, thyme, bay and other traditional herbs, and food infused with vegetables like celery, carrot, onion, and leek. Tuscan is less pasta, more fish, meat, and potato. True to that style, this restaurant was spot on. Read on for details. ATMOSPHERE: Buzzing. We were among the first to arrive around 5:15 p.m. or so, but by the time we'd ordered our main courses (around 6:00 pm) the place was packed with diners. The lights are dim, and the dining area minimalist in decor, allowing you to focus on the food and each other rather. Bonus points for the almost intoxicating wood burning stove that the pizzas are baked in, which is fully visible from the dining room. TIP - dress up, this is not the place to come in jeans or casual wear. I recommend business casual at a minimum. FOOD: Most of our experience was reallygood. It was restaurant week (see ""value"" for more on this bit of a let down), so we had: BONUS PERK - Fresh made bread and a complimentary starter which consisted of a ""sandwich"" made from flat bread, fresh mozzerella, a bit of spinach, tomato, and a bit of parmesan. A lovely way to kick of a dinner. 1st course: caprese-type salad to start (mozzerella, basil, heirloom tomatoes) and Polpette in Umido (lamb meatballs). The caprese was as expected, fresh, tasty, but not a work of art - it's hard to make such a ""common"" dish special, so no points of for lack of originality. Polpette was surprisingly GOOD - I am not a lamb fan, I don't like the flavor of the meat, but these meatballs could make me a believer. Less gamey than traditional lamb cuts, and thoughtfully seasoned,  2nd course: Rigatoni alla Butera and an ""off menu"" item my husband ordered consisting of an artic char fish filet that was sauteed in tomatos, capers, red pepper, and spices. The rigatoni, honestly, was very boring. It was something I could easily have done at home, and probably better tasting for far less money. It lacked flavor and originality. The artic char dish was so much better (coming from someone who does not care for fish, this is saying something). It was cooked to perfection, flaky, and well done. While the fish itself lacked any real flavor, the juices / saute bed it was served in made up for it, and the dish was a winner. 3rd course: Panna Cotta and Bombolini. While the panna cotta was good, I wouldn't agree with other reviews that rate it outstanding, or unforgettable. It was definately one of the meal's highlights flavor wise, but mine was a little too warm and gelatinous, and the caramel was on the flavorless side. I didn't get any of the pink peppercorn flavor that was promised. The Bombolini were okay, but not great. The donuts were warm, heavenly goodies, but the marmalade took the bitterness of the blood orange and none of the sweet, ruining the effect. The hot chocolate was not hot, and a bit on the watery side. SERVICE: Overall, impeccable. The server was courteous, the bus staff very attentive - no sooner had we finished a dish than the bus staff was there to take it away (without the effect of hovering!). Perhaps its the way of fine dining,  but throughout the course of the meal I found myself wondering why we saw the bus staff more than we did our server, I though this was strange. Nonetheless, the service is exactly what you'd expect dining in a restaurant of this caliber. VALUE: Not great. Ordinarily I might not say this, if it hadn't been restaurant week. The idea of this week is to entice diners to try different, featured items at a ""bargain"" price. The select menu at Coco Pazzo was priced at $33.00 for 3 courses (of limited items). While I opted this route, my husband went to the full menu for his courses, and ended up paying only a few dollars more than I did, leaving me to feel somehow cheated on the experience. Expect to pay around $11.00 for most firsts, $30.00 for most mains (seconds), and somewhere around $10.00 for desserts (third). Wines are bordering ridiculous, with even a modest bottle costing around $70.00, with the top end well in to the hundreds. Overall, it was a good experience. While I'm not sure I would return, given the fact that I wasn't blown away (and that there are better experiences in the immediate area), this was a nice dinner, and I enjoyed the evening.",0.9981,0.768,0.163,0.069,0.5232889822595705

We went with the restaurant week dinner menu.

Our dinner there puts this place easily in my current top 3 restaurants that I've eaten at.  Not sure that I can add much on top of all of the other detailed reviews.  I can add that service was fantastic.  We had a waiter AND a server, and they kept very busy running to make sure everything was taken care of. The only reason why I'm not giving them 5 stars is because when my wife and I ate dinner there we were seated at a table by the bar, but it felt like it was a little too close, and seemed like we were sitting in traffic.  It was uncomfortable.",0.9191,0.828,0.142,0.03,0.5119005847953216
2012-01-17,4.0,"Brace yourself. This is what we ordered. For the two of us. 1. Baccala (salt cod & potato puree, garlic crostini) 2. Rucola Salad (arugula, parmesan potato thing, honey, preserved lemon) 3. Cappellaci di Patate (potato filled pasta, roasted root veg, butter, parm, black truffles) 4. Spaghetti Chitarra (squid ink pasta, crab, leeks, cherry tomatoes, bread crumbs, chili oil) 5. Tagliatelle ai Funghi (roasted mushrooms, brussel sprout leaves, pancetta, chestnuts) 6. Risotto of the day (peas, pancetta) 7. Ossobuco 8. Panna Cotta (vanilla custard, pineapple, pink peppercorns, caramel) 9. Bombolini (donuts, blood orange marmalade, fennel orange hot chocolate) Yes, you read that right, this was for the TWO of us. You know you have an over-ordering problem when the waiter actually says ""Uh, I think that's enough.""  True story. With that said, we did actually go with the half portions of the pastas and risotto, but keep in mind they're not actually half portions, more like 3/4 -- therefore not half the price either.  I think we were both kind of floored when we saw the bill at the end of the night.  Then again we did order NINE things for 2 people. So really, there's no one to blame but us. Anyway, everything was really, really good. The only thing I probably wouldn't order again would be the salt cod spread (and that actually came on high recommendation from our waiter, so HMPH for telling us we ordered too much!).  Other than that, I'm a big fan of handmade pastas and they did not disappoint. My fave was probably the tagliatelle as far as flavor profile.  And if you like arugula salad like I do, try theirs, it's excellent (I'm a sucker for candied citrus). The Panna Cotta was FANTASTIC. I totally killed that dessert even after eating 7 other dishes and I'm not afraid to admit it. The donuts themselves were also fantastic, but the dips that came with were not -- marmalade was too sweet, hot chocolate shoulda been a ganache for dipping instead. The epic win of the night was probably when my eating buddy turned over one of the bones of the ossobuco and found mouth-watering, gelatinous, BONE MARROW all ready to scoop out and devour. I don't know if it was meant to be there, or if it was a fluke in cooking, but as a wise man once said, ""A fluke is one of the most common fish in the sea, so if you go fishing for a fluke, chances are you just might catch one."" My only regret was not saving some bread to smear it on. FUN TIDBIT: There was a special fish of the night (grilled wild striped sea bass I think) that we saw lots of tables ordering. The servers wheeled out this beautifully grilled WHOLE fish on a cart but then, since you silly Americans despise dealing with bones, they filet it for you at the table. When I say filet, I actually mean butcher.  I watched in horror as I saw the server scrape away all the good parts of the belly, and it took everything I had to restrain myself from jumping across the room and taking off with this free treasure.  I could hear my Chinese mother screaming in my head ""Tee-fah-niiiii! Think of all those starving children in Africa!!"" or perhaps my favorite, ""If you don't finish everything on that plate, you're going to end up with an ugly husband!"" I shook it off and told my eating buddy not to look, because I'm pretty sure he would have tried to negotiate a nightly deal with the restaurant to give him all their discarded fish belly and heads.",0.9944,0.773,0.147,0.08,0.5857752792475014

I dined at Coco Pazzo this past weekend with some friends and left unimpressed.  Everything about this place just seems slightly generic...nothing really catches your eye as far as the decor and I had about the same feeling in regards to their food. We arrived ahead of everyone in our party and headed to the bar.  The bar is in the back of the restaurant so you walk past all of the tables to get to the bar...kinda odd.  The bartender was friendly enough, but again, kind of a generic friendly.  While waiting for our party to arrive I kind of looked around and noticed the crowd was a bit older.  I thought, at first, this could be due to our early dinner reservations, but the later it got and the more filled in the restaurant got, the more I noticed the same age range of clientele.  Absolutely nothing wrong with that...just stating a fact. We shared a couple of the pizzas as appetizers.  Good, but nothing amazing.  I ordered the cod special which was in a red sauce with capers, spinach, and roasted potatoes.  My fish was actually pretty good.  Potatoes, eh, not so much.  Spinach, eh, not so much.  I split a Crostata dessert with my husBAND.  It almost seemed like a frozen dessert...didn't look or taste ""homemade"".  The only fantastic thing was the coffee ice cream.  SOOO good.   See, I almost forgot to mention our waitress.  That's because the service was even generic.  Most of our party had some issue with her because she made a couple of snips at some of them and was a little unresponsive at times.  However, I had no issue with her, other than the fact that she was almost unmemorable.

2011-09-17,3.0,"Let's start with the good news. The decor at Coco Pazzo is beautiful; the exposed wooden beams on the ceiling, classy white tablecloths, sleek bar, and open kitchen all make for a very nice ambiance. The food is also uniformly awesome. The bread is fresh, and not served to you in baskets on the table, which adds to the ethos of the establishment in my humble opinion. Our appetizers (heirloom tomato and mozzarella di bufala, fried zucchini florets) were both delicious; the florets were fried crisp without being greasy, the heirloom tomatoes were perectly right, and the mozzarella was delectably gooey while still holding its shape. The artichoke salad and cauliflower potato soup (on special) were both very well-balanced dishes; the soup in particular was smooth without being heinously creamy, and packed a subtle peppery bite. Main courses (skate wing, pancetta-wrapped quail with grilled radicchio, lamb chops with grilled polenta, and saffron risotto with veal and pork bolognese, also on special) were all excellent; the standouts were the skate wing, very delicate and cooked to perfection, and the risotto, which is bursting with saffron flavor that pairs surprisingly well with the hearty bolognese. Desserts are only pretty good, although they have many components, one of which tends to be stellar . I'd say this is solid 4-4.5 star food. Now for the bad: I feel obligated to knock a star off for the service. It took us 20 minutes after ordering our pre-dinner drinks to arrive, and an analogously long time to get our food orders in after that. The meal took over two hours, which I am fine with - personally, I like eating dinner at a relaxed European pace. However, at Coco Pazzo, this pacing was unintentional and due to a lack of attention. Upon ordering entrees, out waiter asked us if we wanted soup or salad in a tone that implied it was included, which even though we knew they weren't, was just weird.  We also had a strange visit from the proprietor, who told us to ""enjoy life while we can, because you never know when it's gonna go all downhill"". It was a morbid and unsettling note that sullied an otherwise nice evening. I should note that the service had some nice notes - we were comped a somewhat mediocre appetizer unsolicited, and they had our car waiting for us when we left the restaurant.  One final comment on the pricing, which was uniformly fairly steep for the portions served - no entrees come in under $24. Still, the food was excellent, and if the service was impeccable, I likely wouldn't have even mentioned it.

For dinner I went with the risotto and it was delicious. Firm, flavorful, and cheesy.  Other entrees included crab, red snapper and pasta.  All companions went ay happy and just the right level of full. Extensive wine list was not fully explored but appeared comprehensive if a tad Italian heavy (but duh it is an Italian place) Perfect double espresso to finish the night and before I forget a unique method (heavy curtains) of closing off areas in the large open room for smaller groups.

The milanese was huge!! It took over the whole plate. For desert I had the flourless chocolate cake and it was yummy. It would be nice if it was a bigger portion.

But shit for a $150 meal for three, standards shouldn't be lowered because its lunch.  The service, to start off, was more than anything almost annoying.  We had a 1pm reservation, which is clearly towards the end of the lunch shift, but that does not grant servers to act bothered by our presence.  If thats how you feel, you're in the wrong industry.  Our server told us the specials at about 100 miles an hour and ran away.  This coming from a server who at times does speak probably too fast, but understands rapid speech.  What came out his mouth was like Twista talking Italian with an awful Anglo accent. Half-way through the meal the server actually decided to leave. And leave us with another server, who was probably a busser.  He had no idea what he was doing. The timing of the service, ect was decent.  They did their job, but just the bare minimum and left us feeling annoyed with their poor attitude and professionalism.   The food wasn't anything to talk about either.  The Antipasti was good; grilled vegetables, meats, ect.  Tasty, nothing original or edgy.  I ordered the Gorgonzola-filled Mezzalune. When you hear gorgonzola, you think a bold, but very tasty cheese.  Bold, mostly.  I was excited! I love gorgonzola, was thinking this would be like the average ricotta-filled pasta but with a kick and a half.  But nope.  The mezzalune came and were such a let down.  In the pasta, the filling contained probably 10% gorgonzola, and maybe, I don't know, bread crumbs? They lacked any hint of flavor, could barely taste the cheese.  And the sauce they were served in was very buttery.  Everything about that plate was, sigh, blah. My grandfather thoroughly enjoyed the duck, was happy the skin was left on.  Grandmother liked the soft shell crab, but was let down with the quantity served.  The only really great dish brought to the table was the Mascarpone Cheesecake, garnished with pistachio crumbs and drizzle.  This was probably the best cheesecake I've had.  The other desserts looked really great, as well.   The environment of the restaurant was kinda blah too. All in all, all this restaurant has got going for itself is the pastry chef.  The service, food, ect, all particularly for the price point, is just not there.  If a fine-dining, white table cloth Italian dinner (with good foood and good service) is what you're looking for, try Piccolo Sogno.  There is nothing here for you.",0.9936,0.776,0.152,0.071,0.4971618357487923

Our server was ok, and helpful with the menu.  I'm not sure if it was just a really busy night, or if it was our server, but after dinner was completed, we waited quite a long time for our bill (our server was nowhere to be found) and when it came, someone else took care of running it.   The restaurant is normally quite pricey - when there are special deals is the time to go. The food itself was exceptional.  Before the first course, we were given a small mozarella, basil and tomato flatbread piece....unbelievably delicious.  The octopus starter was spicey and tasty (the bread underneath was nicely full of deliciousness).  I had the pork chop for dinner - wow - huge and tasty!  The tomato arugula salad on top was nice and fresh and cut the more heavy pork chop. Dessert was good, but small.  I didn't love the combination of pomegranate and chocolate, but it was nicely presented.   The loudness of the restaurant left more possibility to people watch than to talk, so that's what I did.  The table next to us did take at least 30 min to pick a wine - which was moderately amusing. Lastly, the bathrooms....they were clean, but could use updating.  At 6:30pm, the garbage can was already overflowing, which was a bit of a turn off. While the food was delicious, for the price, I would have expected better service and atmosphere.  This would be a nice spot for a group dinner, but for a relaxing night, you may want to try something else.",0.9975,0.771,0.186,0.042,0.5262896825396826

2011-01-10,1.0,"Very disappointing experience.  It was my first time dining at Coco Pazzo.  I had heard great things about the restaurant and food.  So we decided to take my friend there for her birthday.  We had an 8 pm reservation, but were not seated until 8:30, even though the hostess kept telling us from the moment we checked in at 7:45 that our table was minutes from being ready.  I understand that sometimes these things happen, but I'd rather the hostess be honest and tell me that the table won't be ready for another 30 minutes.  That way we'll get a drink at the bar. However, that was just the beginning.  Our waiter never introduced himself, never went over the specials with us, and wasn't very friendly or helpful.  The food was decent, but not something I'd rave about.   Since it was my friend's birthday, we brought a cake and agreed to the $3/person cake cutting fee.  I was told in making the reservation that this fee includes a side of gelato with each slice.  We did not receive any gelato with the cake, but were still charges the $3/person fee.  Pretty expensive for a small cake and party of 13.     Additionally, I had inquired about splitting the bill in 3 or 4, to make it easier for the table and each guest to figure out what he/she owed.  I was told beforehand that they would be able to accomodate this request.  However, when I asked the waiter, he said he'd be unable to do this for us.  So instead, it took us over 30 minutes (and after the rest of the restaurant had left) to figure out the bill.  And it didn't help that when each of us went through our charges, we discovered that we were overcharged for a number of our meals.  Apparently, the prices on the menu mean nothing.  They'll charge whatever they want, and if you're not attentive, you'll overpay without even realizing it.  We had to send the bill back for revisions three times.  I guess with a party that size, the assume nobody will notice.  But I would recommend anyone dining there to be aware of this.",0.9789,0.848,0.11,0.041,0.576125

Needless to say, it was crowded and we had to wait at the bar for 15-20 minutes before the host could seat us. But I was dressed up and donning my lucky red pumps and I wasn't going to let anything ruin my Prosecco-filled evening.  Once we were seated and greeted by our waiter, we had to ask for the pre-fixe five-course NYE tasting menu. I decided right away to indulge. It's the last night of they year so... why not, right?  Our first course was a seafood misto. Not bad. I loved the shrimp, but the oyster and salmon cake were nothing to write home about. Since my fiance and I don't eat beef or pork, they offered to substitute the second course - Contechino e Lenticchie (spiced sausage) - with the Mozzarella di Bufala, which was also pretty good. But it was your standard buffalo mozzarella.  Our pasta course was a fettucini with asparagus. Awful. If I'm going to carbo load, at least give me a good reason to eat pasta. But it was watery and lacking salt. Yes, I do love my food on the salty side, but if you're going to go light on it, at least keep a salt shaker at the table and don't make me feel like an ass by asking for one.  Our fourth course - Scottadito d'Agnello (grilled lambchops) - was the most worthwhile dish in the tasting menu. I love me some lamb but please give me something sharper than a butter knife to cut through it?  Ten minutes before Midnight, we got a new waiter who handed us the dessert menu. I guess he didn't realize we did the tasting menu so we had to ask him to bring us our chocolate cake when he asked us whether we wanted dessert. Frozen. The chocolate cake was frozen and hard as a rock.  For $105 per person, I definitely didn't think the tasting menu was worth it.

Overall, I was happy with my meal, and my lunch companions also seemed quite pleased.  I had the Finocchio e Arancia (a salad of shaved fennel, blood orange, pomegranate seeds, pecorino & lemon oil) minus the pecorino, and it was a surprisingly wonderful blend of tangy and savory.  The pomegranate seeds provided surprising interludes of sweetness.  For my main course, the Verdure in Cartoccio could not have been a better choice.  Everyone else at the table had pasta, beautifully presented, however, the presentation and opening of my parchment-wrapped steamed vegetables was the real show stopper.  Not to mention that the dish, steamed in olive oil and accented with fennel, rosemary, and sea salt, was unbelievably fresh.  I found myself almost purring with happiness between bites.  I also had a bite of the Polenta con Funghi (not as good as Bistro Campagne's polenta, unfortunately), and an incredibly well-made double espresso. I look forward to going back.  If the service, food, and atmosphere of today are any indication, it seems Coco Pazzo would definitely be a 5-star experience with fewer dining companions and a little bit more personalized service than was possible today.",0.9957,0.807,0.18,0.013,0.5256302521008404

2010-11-13,4.0,"Seated promptly by a courteous and observant server (he noted my SOFA bag and inquired about the show) I was glad I'd worn a leather blazer - even at lunch Coco Pazzo is packed and has a lot of style with well-heeled clientele talking about the stock market over cocktails and plates of charcuterie, vegetables, and pasta.  Offered tap vs. bottled water I selected tap and Joel named off approximately 8 daily specials all of which sounded quite good before presenting me with the menu displaying another twenty or so choices.  With a focus on local/seasonal produce, pastas and breads handmade in house daily and ""every stock, sauce, pastry, and dessert prepared by our passionate and creative staff"" it is hard to find any fault in Coco Pazzo's business model. With multiple awards including a Mobile Travel Guide 4-Star rating lining the back walls, a wood burning stove featured prominently in the kitchen, and heavy curtains, white table cloths, exposed brick walls, and Vetri-esque centerpieces adorning the dining room the feel of Cocco Pazzo was rustic yet refined.  With water poured and never reaching half-empty my request from the dinner menu was confirmed and I selected two ""appetizer-portion"" menu items to compliment that choice.  I will note here that I rather wish I'd have been told that half-portions were not half price (closer to 3/4 price, actually) but I must admit I love the ability to order smaller portions to taste more options. With my orders en route for the kitchen I was next met by the bread server - a delightful young woman who, despite poor grasp of English, managed to keep my bread plate full throughout the meal.  Served with an intensely grassy olive oil the daily selections included cheesy bread sticks, rustic white sourdough, and rosemary sea salt laden foccaccia.  I could lie and say I took it easy on the bread, but let's just say I have trouble turning down fantastic bread and the Foccaccia was just that. Beginning my meal proper was the appetizer I'd requested from the dinner menu - I'd heard on good word that it was stunning.  Titled Terrina di Fegato with Duck Liver Terrine, Fig Mostarda, Heirloom Apple, endive, and grilled foccaccia I was first surprised by the portion size - for a mere $10 this was a lot of liver.  Airy and whipped - not dissimilar to The French Laundry in texture - the liver was one of the more potent flavored terrine's I've had - not ""gamey"" but not as refined as most Foie Gras preps.  What made the dish truly shine was actually the manner in which it was paired - the heavy handedness of the terrine nicely balanced with bitter endive, mild apples, a drizzle of olive oil, and sugary sweet figs.  Both on its own and spread on the grilled bread I liked the dish but was not ""wowed"" in the same manner as by the version at Henri the day before (or Everest the day after.) For my main courses I began with the Ravioli di Zucca with butternut squash filled pasta, brown butter, sage, and amaretti I couldn't help but make comparison to Batali's famous Pumpkin Lune's at Babbo.  With parmesan grated tableside the four small packets were light and textural, but unfortunately somewhat more al dente than I prefer for filled pastas.  Pasta ""done-ness"" preferences aside, the textural contrast lent by the grated cookie and intense sweetness smoothed by the nutty brown butter the flavor of the dish was spot on. Pasta number two fared much better than the Ravioli in terms of texture and was perhaps one of the best pasta's I've had this year.  Titled Tagliatelle Castagne with Chestnut noodles, mushrooms, leeks, pumpkin, and speck the flat ribbons of pasta were flawlessly al dente and tasted like smoky chestnuts through and through.  Paired with melting leaks and mushrooms which added further earthiness, baked pumpkin for sweetness, and shreds of house cured speck the entirely of the plate was smoky, sweet, and savory - from what the waiter said it is one of their most popular seasonal recipes and returns for a few months each year. For dessert I settled on Tavoletta with Gianduja mousse, flourless chocolate cake, chocolate hazelnut crunch, and raspberry coulis.  Served as a four-layer dessert approximately the size of a pager and topped with two plump raspberries the flavors melded well, but the raspberry gelee atop was nonadherent and fell off with each attempt to cut with a fork.  A good dessert, but not a great dessert. When the meal was over I was again satiated and quite happy with the manner in which I was taken care of.  While minor issues with the food were noted they certainly weren't glaring errors and the service was exemplary.  Overall I'd say Coco Pazzo compares favorably to Café Spiaggia in terms of cuisine and service, but I personally found the experience, setting, and flavors at Café Spiaggia superior - either way, in many US cities Coco Pazzo would be the best Italian in town.",0.999,0.813,0.157,0.03,0.5288391661885636

2010-10-26,4.0,"Wow this place is like the ""happening"" place to come if you're on a date. I, sadly, was not on a date but it seemed that practically ever other table was consumed by pairs of lovey dovey types. Good for them. And now at least I know of a place I can suggest for future dates for myself. Always trying to see the glass half full over here. So anyway, I did like the atmosphere of this restaurant although maybe a bit formal, with the white tablecloths and all, but added a nice touch of elegance. Our waiter was very knowledgeable, and a nice guy at first but perhaps a tad annoying later in the evening (more on this in a minute). He was very well read on his wine list, suggesting a unique dry white that was neither sauvignon, chardonny, or pinot grigio but a fabulous blend of white grapes from...lord knows where, but the wine was pretty bomb. The food, also bomb. The portions aren't too large which I appreciate. America is obese so glad they are serving regular sized portions. I ordered the special which was a combination of seafood in linguine and a spicy sauce. It wasn't something I would typically order, as I'm not much of a tomato sauce girl, but the pasta had a bit of a kick to it which I rather enjoyed.  Also, the bread here is fabulous. They have a little bread man that comes around and puts just one slice on your plate. You can pick from a variety of three different breads; I picked the focaccia. To me this is a nice perk, because I typically like to stuff my face with bread and butter before my entree even arrives. This isn't good for two reasons: 1) the figure and 2) I end up being stuffed before the main dish! Not cool. So the waiter only got a tad annoying when he came by what seemed like every few minutes to check on our interest in dessert. We passed, and I think he was just being tenacious and wanting to ensure we weren't neglected, but I did almost feel like he was trying to rush us out. Maybe he was, maybe he wasn't, but I would still give this waiter an A- in service for the evening. They don't have a HUGE selection. They only have a few vegetarian options so keep this in mind if you're a picky eater and don't eat things with faces. One last little secret I'd like to let you in on...there is a Coco Pazzo CAFE not that far away. It's basically the same food, but cheaper prices. Both excellent choices for an evening out to dinner.",0.9971,0.769,0.184,0.048,0.5640384615384615

2010-10-23,3.0,"I really love the food at Coco Pazzo. The mushroom risotto, the rigotoni, and the panna cotta are among my favorites. The first time I came to Coco Pazzo, it was an intimate dinner with two of my closest friends. We had great food, caught up on life, and it was an amazing time. However, I would definitely not recommend coming here for a larger party. Recently I organized a reunion dinner for 20 people. After I made the reservation, the manager contacted me and suggested fixing up a custom three-course menu for $65 a person. It was a bit pricey but wasn't bad and we decided to go for it. The manager responded quickly to my emails and was open to answering all questions that I had. Everything up until the actual moment that we arrived at the restaurant was fine. The food itself was good and my friends and I did have a good time, but the whole night, the manager was honestly pretty rude. Although they had informed me over the phone about separating our party into two round tables, some of my friends really wanted the tables to be combined in some way because we were all supposed to be spending time with one another. However, the manager only curtly informed us over and over that they couldn't do that because the tables couldn't fit that many people and if we combined the tables, it would waste floor space in which other customers could be dining. At the end of our dinner, I had to speak to him really quickly about the $500 deposit that the restaurant asked me to put down for the reservation. The manager again seemed kind of snappy and very distracted. I understand that the restaurant was busy and we were dining at the peak of their rush, but really, he could have been a little more courteous. He appeared very focused on the other customers and making sure he could fill the restaurant to maximum capacity. I'd go back, but only with a few friends next time.",0.9936,0.792,0.168,0.04,0.4860433604336045

2010-09-20,4.0,"Yummy yummy yummy in my tummy tummy tummy!  This place had some of the best Italian food I have ever eaten!  I'm not even a huge fan of Italian in general (besides pizza...duh...) and don't eat pasta often, but if I could have it like Coco Pazzo makes it, I would be eating it a whole lot more!   I had the Tortelli con Melanzane ($18) that is a round-shaped pasta filled with eggplant and marinated w/tomatoes, mint and pesto.  It seriously was one of the most memorable pasta dishes of my life (I exaggerate not)!  My bf had the Branzino al Forno ($38) which is a whole sea bass that they prepared on a cart right next to the table!  I had never seen this done before...the fish was brought out whole, the server removed the head, tail, and bones, marinated it with oil and then served the dish.  Talk about fresh!  It was really great tasting sea bass.  We also enjoyed several appetizers, the Funghi Arrosto ($11) was my fave - oyster mushrooms served with pancetta, radicchio and aged balsamic.  My only complaint about this dish is that it was not nearly enough!  We also had the Sapori Toscani ($10) which was 3 spreads served with focaccia - a pate, a white bean puree and something else.  I didn't much care for this dish - especially the pate. ICK!  I enjoyed a very yummy Barbera red wine with my dinner, and then fab hazelnut gelato for dessert.  It was such a great meal! I do not prefer the atmosphere of this restaurant since it is a bit stodgey with a lot of older people and business associates (which this place caters toward), but for a fancy dinner w/the fam, it works out well.  It wouldn't be my first recommendation to anyone for a nice date unless you are over the age of 40 or really just don't care about atmosphere.",0.9933,0.784,0.169,0.048,0.46943371943371937
2010-08-02,2.0,"Visited this place on Saturday, July 31. 9:00 reservation, had a slight wait. Not a problem except there is not really any place to wait at the front of the house. Once seated, took awhile before a server came by for our drink order. Then it took awhile to get the drinks. Not the best signs. When we went to order appetizers, I then told our server that we still needed some time to decide entree's. She commented that if we ordered now, it would be better timed with our appetizers. At this point, I think, better timed for who? I told her we needed more time. Anyway here is everythin we ordered. Appetizers: Bufala mozzarella with tomatoes. Squash blossoms, Grilled octopus. Entrees: Spicey seafood stew, Rigatoni with sausage and peas, and the Steak Fiorentina for two, ordered medium rare. Here is the lowdown on the taste. All of the appetizers were fairly good but not anything special, especially at their prices. Seafood stew was nice, not really spicey but had a nice flavor. The rigatoni pasta dish was OK, but not really anything that you could not get at the other thousand Italian restaurants available in our city. AS for the Fiorentina, it is a hefty steak for two and it is sliced tableside. When delivered to the table and the slicing process started, we noticed that the steak was very, very rare. I like my steak on the rare side of medium rare but this looked raw. I stopped the server and said that needs additional cooking. He wanted to finish slicing before bringing it back for further time in the oven. No way! He should know better than that. Especially since that was a $68 steak. Long story short. Returned with the steak, sliced it up and plated it for us. It was quite good, nice flavor. We all skipped dessert, just had coffee. Overall.............I wanted to like this place, I really did.. However, the service was just not there. If I pay these high end prices I want high end service and it did not happen. The food was alright but not spectacular.  It is also too noisy. Way too noisy.

Coco Pazzo is fine dining without the attitude, and they get you in and out in about one hour without compromising service or making you feel rushed.  The cuisine is upscale Italian and the price point is high. Expect to spend $30-40 a person without drinks but including tax and tip. The food is worth the cost, at least when work is paying. My group of six went for salads and pasta, generally. The portions were large but not overwhelming, which is a plus because no one walks out of a work lunch with leftovers (as much as I might want to).  I liked but didn't love my risotto. I could tell the dish was well made and the flavors were bold, but they were not suited to my particular preferences. If you are a fan of dill and garbanzo beans, this is your go-to. Unfortunately, there were not a lot of (or any) other vegetarian options. I'm guessing this is the kind of place where the kitchen would whip you up something if you asked, but I would not have been comfortable doing that under the circumstances. I try to avoid seeming fussy about my diet with coworkers, a trait which I generally appreciate in others but admittedly don't always practice myself. The arugula salad was better. Lightly dressed and hearty enough to be a (small) meal on its own. We skipped dessert, which is sad because everything sounded great (it always does).  I can't praise the service enough. Efficient without being rushed, friendly without being annoying or contrite. I've found that servers at nicer places tend to treat me with some amount of attitude because I look young and not to be taken seriously. None of that here. The courses were perfectly timed so that as soon as we put our forks down, the plates were picked up and the next course was put out. The bill came promptly and our water glasses were filled before they ever got to halfway. After my two-hour ordeal at La Madia, this was extremely appreciated. Thumbs up.

2009-07-18,3.0,"I ate here once a few years ago when I worked at the Merchandise Mart.  I really enjoyed it that time, but this return visit was rather disappointing. I started with the Funghi Arrosto, which is mushrooms, pancetta and radicchio.  It was actually the reason I came in, because last time I'd LOVED it.  This time, though, it was lacking in seasoning and was just ... boring.  I couldn't taste the mushrooms or the pancetta and radicchio flavor by itself doesn't really do it for me. Next I had their Risotto, which changes daily.  When risotto is cooked properly, I LOVE it. This one came out as a huge pile on a plate.  I have to say that the degree to which I think risotto is well-executed seems to be inversely proportional to how much is given in the serving.  The two places I've had the best risottos in Chicago - Naha and Prosecco - both serve small amounts.  At Naha it's in a small bowl, at Prosecco it's spread on a medium-sized plate.  At Coco Pazzo it was served heaping on large soup plate.  There was so much risotto I could barely finish it, and it was overcooked and mushy.  Having figured out how to cook risotto at home, I think the reason large servings of it don't work is that it's just hard to control the ingredients when you have a lot of rice.  It needs to be hot when you sautee the rice to start and you need to control the input of the stock as the rice cooks - both of those are much harder to do if you have a lot of rice in the pan. Overall, the service was still good and I like the atmosphere.  The food, though, seems to have gone downhill since my original visit.  The food quality now seems more like typical business-oriented food instead of true crafted Italian food.",0.9887,0.85,0.124,0.026,0.40051587301587305

We took our time ordering and eating, which made for a very relaxing experience. The service was a bit disjointed, however. I couldn't really tell which server was ours (if we even had one). We had a bunch of similar-looking men approach us and speak informally and timidly, without introduction or explanation. It felt a bit impersonal.  We ordered a nice bottle of wine, a blend of whites, and then moved on to the food. Our fritto misto di mare appetizer was surprisingly tasty - it was basically fried calimari and shrimp, but I enjoyed it much more than I expected. Sure, it wasn't authentic Italian, and I wouldn't have ordered it if Taylor wasn't there, but the food came out hot and crispy. The breading was delicate and flavorful, without overpowering the seafood. There were also tasty fried lemon slices mixed in - who would have ever thought that they would be so yummy?  The torteli di carciofi pasta was my favorite part. It was hot and delicate, with fresh tasting ingredients. A bit overpriced, possibly, but nice lush filled pasta nonetheless.  Then came the breaded veal chop, and this is where things went wrong. As Tay and I recall, veal is supposed to be exceedingly tender and flavorful. This chop couldn't have been farther from that description. The breading and the meat were bland - definitely underseasoned. The meat also didn't cut smoothly - it was gray and tough compared to the succulent veal that I have enjoyed at other restaurants. It was very confusing. We still ate most of it, but then did tell our server about our disappointment. He brought the maitre'd over, and he apologized, which made me feel better about the whole thing.  We still decided to have dessert, which was three creamy and delicious sorbets.  We couldn't tell which one was which, since nobody explained it to us.  A good waiter would have told us what the flavors were, but you don't get service like that here, sadly. Nonetheless, I enjoyed our dessert, and I was even happier when we got our bill and saw that we hadn't been charged for the veal. That's the way to do business right - but I guess it would have been preferable to have better food and service to begin with! I almost never write ""complaining"" reviews - and I'm certainly not the type to give a place one star because I disliked the main course.  The pasta was delicious, the atmosphere was elegant and classy, and the maitre'd had a very professional response to our complaint.  I do have to say that I was really, truly disappointed in their veal chop.  I am not a picky eater by any means, and I try my best to look for the good points in all dishes - but this main course was really unacceptable.  Still, I hear that most people have a very positive experience there, so I hope this review won't completely dissuade anyone from going.",0.9979,0.735,0.2,0.065,0.6154823048890846

My in-laws were in town and our party of 4 was one of only a few full tables in the restaurant.  Like i said- most stay home in such awful weather conditions.  Once we sat down we were greeted by the bread man- being a carb lover this may just be my favorite employee of any restaurant.  We all pretty much went for a piece of delicious foccacia bread, while my husband chose a piece of french bread.  He later came back and this time I opted for a very thin breadstick.   As for appetizers my husband and father-in-law both chose salads, while I had a bowl of minestrone soup to help with my sore throat.  I'm actually not really a fan of minestrone soup, but this was pretty good and soothing.  They also brought out some complimentary bruchetta with white bean dip, which I liked...especially cause it was a lot softer than most of the bruchettas I've had. And then on to the main entree... I took advice from an old colleague who once told me ""always order the special because there's a reason why it's special.""  There was lots on the daily special menu to choose from, but I went for the bass.  Husband and father-in-law followed in my lead and ordered the bass as well, while my mother-in-law chose the salmon from the regular menu.  The bass was cooked to perfection- very fresh and flavorful! I think we all liked our meals because we were soon 4 members of the clean plate club. Too full for dessert, but if they'd had tiramisu on the menu (my husband's favorite) I'm sure we could have found some room in our bellies.   All in all, a very nice way to spend a blizzardy Monday evening.",0.9975,0.768,0.207,0.025,0.5267206178834086

I had a pasta dish that was served with a wild boar sauce. My god, it was phenomenal.  I'd also point out that the portions and the prices were pretty fair. My dish was $15, although I think I had the cheapest item on the menu. A lot the other selections looked great and were somewhat expensive dishes.

2008-08-15,4.0,"Can't miss I love it at Coco Pazzo. I love the room, the service and most decidedly the food. It's hard to go wrong with Italian food unless you're doing it really cheaply, but Coco Pazzo hits all the right notes. I'm a big proponent of trying a new restaurant at lunch before securing a reservation at dinner. The room might be a little brighter; but, in general, you can get a good read on how the place operates, how much you like the food, and what you can expect from service all while saving some coin. I also think it's worth going to the main restaurant for this experiment even when said restaurant has a more casual dining venue, as Coco Pazzo does with their River East Coco Pazzo Café. I don't throw down old school at Coco Pazzo when I'm there for lunch. One of my favorite Antipasti is their Carpaccio di Polp, thinly sliced and perfectly cooked octopus with haricot verts, tender new potatoes, rich Italian olives and oregano. The perfect combination of tastes and texture. The second course offers some wonderful fish and proteins and you should try at least one, or order 3 if you're dining with a friend and share the experience. The wood roasted vegetables over baked polenta are perfectly seasoned and cooked to bring out the best in a seasonal selection of vegetables. The pricier Involtini di Torta should not be missed. Rainbow trout is rolled with spinach over ""beluga"" lentils and served with the most flavorful herb vinaigrette. My favorite, however, is the Anatra Arrosto, wood roasted breast of duck with radicchio, pancetta and oyster mushrooms dressed with a balsamic glaze.  Coco does a really nice classic Pizza Margherita, from their wood burning oven, but I prefer their own version with arugula, mozzarella and oven roasted grape tomatoes. If you like the slightly bitter tang of arugula, you can't miss. The crust is thin and crispy, lightly charred, while still maintaining some of that chew. If you go for dinner, ask about their whole roasted fish of the day. These guys know how to roast a fish and the presentation will knock your Italian silk socks off. As far as their pasta goes, it's hard to go wrong, but my absolute favorite is the Parmesan Gnocchi. Soft pillows of potato pasta is a light but highly flavored tomato Parmesan sauce. I don't go for desserts at restaurants, mostly because I think they aren't usually very good and expensive for what they are. Besides, I bake at home and am a snob about desserts. Having said that, I'm always open to the idea of having cheese for dessert and Coco serves up some familiar and perfectly approachable Italian cheeses with homemade rye/currant bread and seasonal fresh fruit as an alternative to tiramisu or gelato. Get thee to Coco Pazzo. I'll see you there.",0.9977,0.787,0.175,0.038,0.5517575268422726
2008-07-01,2.0,"I was looking forward to trying this restaurant for my birthday with my parents who were in town visiting from NY. I had heard great things about it, but was surprised that the menu was not very enticing. There were also no reasonably priced bottles of wine on the wine list. Essentially, we all had to look at it for quite a while before finding something we wanted to order. The fresh tomato and cheese salad was good. My mom ordered the lamb chops and they were good. We shared an asparagus ravioli that was extremely salty. A veal milanese was a bland breaded cutlet, and the seafood stew was, tasty, yet extremely salty. (A lot of green olives in the tomato sauce). Dinner was mediocre, and when the busboy cleared the table he poured the sauce from my mom's lambchops all over her white jacket. After about 10 min, the host came over and offered to pay for the dry cleaning. Which would have entailed my mom sending him the bill from NY, and waiting for a return back. They should have comped something. Perhaps offered a free dessert, or a round of drinks on the house. We left without having dessert.",0.9652,0.864,0.115,0.021,0.5517543859649123

My companion (very well known and recognizable in name and in face in the Chicago area) and I were here last night and one of the hosts came to our table, indicated that he was happy to have her back in the restaurant (ok, perfectly acceptable greeting), BUT... that was immediately followed by a comment so offensive that I could or would not have believed that such words were uttered if I had not been sitting right there.  This host had the nerve to inquire as to the status and whereabouts of her ""husband!"" who by the way is and has been for as long as I can and everyone else in this city can remember, her EX-husband... No joke... Now, I'll give you this - mistakes happen and we all say moronic things, but this host KNEW her, KNEW her ex, KNEW the ex's curent wife and had knowledge of the fact that the current wife looked nothing like my friend.  How humiliating - not only for my friend, but for the host as well.   Well, the friend replied very politely that he must be mistaken because she was the first wife, that her husband had left her 25+ years ago and further reminded the host that the current wife and her could not have been confused because they look nothing alike!  At which point, I politely advised him that he should be careful of what he says in public, to a client and especially to someone who is well recognized by surrounding tables... the host apologized profusely, but there was nothing else that could be done.  Unbelievable.   Well, besides that mishap, our server was very gracious, attentive enough (from time to time, he would disappear and we would need to track him down).  The food was, again, not improved and at is standard mediocre quality (for context sake, I started with the stuffed zucchini flowers (meh) and moved on to a tortelli dish with fava beans which needed additional flavor).  I must say though that the roasted mushroom app my friend had was tasty.   If the food was better, I'd forgive the mishap my friend endured.  But it wasn't... so, I say go elsewhere - or go to Italy.",0.2674,0.787,0.109,0.103,0.4697057684862562

Right before our wine came our table the wait staff led us to our table and arranged for our wine to be delivered to our table. Once we got to our table we ordered some amazing appetizers. We got the bruscetta and the calamari. They also recommended the oyesters but they weren't anything special.

I like the decor, the servce very professional.  I went for lunch.  I liked the food but noticed the lack of garlic in the food, I love garlic but not everyone does so I understand but felt the food was sort of bland.  Heard the deserts were not great and agree.   My review seems netive but it is rather neutral.  I dont want to say it but I do prefer Maggianos even if it is part of a chain.",-0.1484,0.787,0.104,0.109,0.6226666666666667
2007-03-04,4.0,"We ate at coco pazzo recently, and were quite pleased. Good service, good food (especially the fritto misto and the bistecca toscana) and loved the cozy, elegant ambience. One weird thing - their ""coat check"" is essentially a preteen boy and middle aged woman who mill about behind the hostess stand seemingly without purpose. I only realized they were the coat check when I saw someone hand them a coat, and they disappeared into the back for a minute. Very odd.",0.9358,0.72,0.212,0.068,0.6078125

The fries are cooked with fresh herbs and olive oil, they will be the best part of the meal. The mushroom pasta is wonderful. In fact, if I were not stuck in class I would go there right now. My friend ordered the duck and she thought it was great. We split the tiramisu and it was good, nothing to write home about though. The food is worth the trek.

2007-01-26,4.0,"Went here for a work lunch. Very upscale interior, can get little stuffy in there and the clientele tends to be 30+ and probably talking shop.     The menu is short and straightforward; I had a fabulous risotto du jour and sampled my neighbor's trout dish which was perfection. Clean presentation and healthy-sized protions. They have a very large antipasto buffet  in the front which was a big plus since rich cured meats, cheese, fresh bread and olives are all I ever need.       Our nerdy American waiter was nervous and overly attentive, and kept hissing ""pronto, pronto"" at the MEXICAN busboy who really did all the work. Busboys in general here get 5 stars for dishing out the delicous warm bread by piece, and never leaving a glass half-empty.",0.936,0.843,0.132,0.025,0.4551339285714286
2007-01-25,3.0,"Coco Pazzo had been my most frequented stop for Italian food in Chicago for several years, up until recently. The service has always been hit or miss, and the entrees marginal for the price, but previously you were guaranteed excellent homemade pasta at a reasonable price everytime you went to Coco Pazzo. Lately, it seems that portions have shrunk quite a bit, making pasta somewhat impractical as a main course while prices have risen at the same time. Unfortunately, this has changed Coco Pazzo from a place you could go to for a reasonable and delicious pasta dinner to a much pricier multi-course affair, and Coco Pazzo doesn't measure up to a lot of the myriad other options in that market. Instead, try Coco Pazzo Cafe in Streeterville which still delivers a high-quality value.",0.8768,0.861,0.095,0.044,0.45
2006-12-23,4.0,"i've been to this restaurant a few times and have always had a positive experience. this is a fantastic restaurant that brings an air of sophistication to italian cuisine. the risotto special is always incredible, so i recommend trying that. i also love the rigatoni. my date really enjoyed his gniocchi as well. a few minor complaints...the tomato in my buffalo mozzerella antipasti was sundried. i prefer normal, non-sun exposed tomatos. also, their desserts are delicious but small and this always upsets me. i want big desserts!!!! is that too much to ask?!?! judas. anyway......besides those things, the service is delicious, the waiter did a great job of keeping my wine glass filled, and i love the atmosphere. so thumbs up pretty much all around. it is a nice restaurant so i recommend dressing up a little! i definitely look forward to coming back here soon.",0.9937,0.666,0.308,0.026,0.5366753246753246

2006-10-23,3.0,"Pretty good. I'd like to give Coco Pazzo 3.5 stars.  Went here for dinner on a Friday night-- My boyfriend and I were the youngest people in the restaurant by at least 10 years! We def stood out, but the service we received was polite and warm. Our server was a bit absent; we got to know the busboy very well! But I wish our server would have taken the time to talk to us about the restaurant and the menu. He just announced the specials w/ little description, and when I asked him to help me choose between the pumpkin ravioli and the duck pasta, he admitted to never having tried them!  The pumpkin ravioli was very subtle and delicately delicious. The bf raved about his pork chops and the potatoes that came with. The dessert was maybe the best part-- very inventive, flavorful, and beautifully presented. I was initially brought the wrong order, but they brought me the correct dessert when I mentioned the error, and I got to indulge in both!  If you're looking for a nice, fairly quiet fine dining experience, I would def suggest Coco Pazzo. It would be the perfect place for a business dinner, or to bring a client. Or if you are out to impress a gal who doesn't wine&dine often, or doesn't like the typical trendy choices. Personally, I'm glad I went, but I wasn't amazed so I probs won't go back.",0.9943,0.735,0.225,0.04,0.6420634920634921
