Not to confuse this with Twin Peaks, as I had originally thought it was called (which is a completely different atmosphere and perhaps not appropriate for a coworker dinner),  I do LOVE the atmosphere of Twin Anchors though. This restaurant has been around since the 1940s and they have kept the old-school, retro decor. It's very charming and cozy and you can just breathe in the history.  The ribs are pretty good, a little on the smaller side and not a lot of meat on the bones, so if you are feeling hungry you should opt for the full rack. Not to worry though, if you get the half and want to add on, they will do that for you and you can just pay the price of the full rack (instead of two half racks, which will cost you much more). Admittedly, this is not the BEST ribs I've had, but they are decent. The meat falls easily off the bones and with the sauce it is perfect. The spinach side was also great, but very heavy on its own.  It kind of reminds me of a spinach dip appetizer that you would normally eat with pita chips or bread.  I think what pushes this place to four stars is the ambiance. It's worth a visit if you are ever around old town!",0.9497,0.84,0.113,0.046,0.6070512820512821

2017-01-01,4.0,"I came here for dinner around 6:30 on a Wednesday night and the wait quoted to me was 2 HOURS. On a Wednesday? I figured it had to be good. So I put my name in, and luckily only had to wait about an hour fifteen.  The place is kinda divey, but I think that's part of appeal. However, because it's so popular, it's also very crowded...even once seated, the tables seemed super close together and it was hard to make it to the bathroom through the people. Besides that, the service was great and despite the crowd, our waitress was very attentive.  The food - out of this world. I ordered the ribs (get a full rack. I don't care if you're on a diet or whatever. Get the damn full rack. I don't judge). Coupled with the prohibition sauce, which definitely has a kick to it but isn't unbearable, these ribs were amazing. The meat was tender and they were cooked to perfection. I ordered onion rings as a side, and they might be the best damn onion rings I've ever had. You know when you bite an onion ring and all the onion comes out and you're just left with breading and it's the worst? Not the case with these bad boys. You bite in and they're cooked perfectly and the onion stays in so you can finish the whole ring.  This place is definitely worth the wait.

My husband had ribs and I had the half chicken. Chicken was super juicy and an excellent portion. Onion rings were really great too. The only thing I didn't like was the croutons on the ceasar salad. For BBQ the food came out incredibly fast. We had our salad like 5 min after ordering. It's a nice little divey bar/restaurant.,0.971,0.733,0.229,0.039,0.6608974358974359
2016-10-21,4.0,When someone tells you this spot is Frank Sinatra's favorite rib spot you listen.  I never really got a chance to eat in the restaurant as it is much easier to order for pickup and just eat it at the confines of your own home. But whenever I go inside I feel like I am in the dark knight movie with 2 face.  The ribs with the prohibition sauce is . Pulls apart by fork or hand. Nice bark on the outside but soft on the inside. The ribs are kind of small so if I must say just order the full slab. The fries are good but by the time i get home with them they are a little soggy but i am sure its better in the restaurant.  The jumbo shrimps are quite jumbo! They are like little lobster tails. Only comes in 4 pieces but you get like 3 bites from each one. The garlic butter is delish with it.  Rotisserie chicken is the typical rotisserie except you can add their amazing sauces to it making it that much better. Not dry at all btw.

2016-10-20,4.0,"If someone asked me for a perfect example of an All-American diner this place would be it - simple yet cozy atmosphere, a wide selection of beer (especially happy with them carrying 3 diff brews from 3 Floyds), gigantic portions at reasonable prices, screens featuring baseball games, and serving all sorts of popular classics like wings, ribs, and burgers with sides such as fries, onion rings and slaws....  We tried the wings in both zesty and prohibition sauce, and both were very good but on the sweeter side of the BBQ spectrum (another sign of being super American? =P). At first we were wondering if the prohibition sauce would be really spicy considering it contains ghost peppers, but in reality it's merely a hint of fire. The ribs also live up to the hype. So tender they fall of the bone! Only complaint is the fries it came with were very coarsely cut so it's not very crispy, but I suppose some people prefer it this way so to each their own.

Everyone else at my table ordered the ribs, and they were all very satisfied and had nothing but good things to say about it. Beer - Good selection on tap, and plenty of quality options in can & bottle form as well.  Ambience - Old-School Chicago. Welcoming but not trying too hard. Service - Good.

2016-04-04,3.0,"So....I think this may be the only semi-negative review I've ever written, but I'm more hoping to help the place out rather than be negative. Hindsight's 20/20, and I should have just said something while I actually there. We got there at 7pm on a Saturday, and totally expected to wait for some time to get a table. No complaints there. This was our first experience at Twin Anchors, and we'd heard nothing but great things, so were excited to finally be trying it. We were actually pleasantly surprised when it was only an hour and 15 minute wait for two....no biggie, we can handle that. So we were standing around the front bar area just waiting, which gets pretty crowded during busy times, but again, totally to be expected! We were lucky enough to snag two bar stools at the end of the bar by the hostess stand while waiting for our table to wait it out while enjoying some cocktails, out of the way of the masses. Bad move. Those last two bar seats are RIGHT by the sink. And I dont know what they use to clean or how much of it, but the bleach smell was pretty.....overwhelming. Seriously.....it was really, really bad! I could smell it when I walked in the front door, but sitting right there by it was a whole different ball game. Just to be clear, I am not bothered by smells whatsoever, however gross or not gross that may be. I'm pretty tolerant to them, but for some reason this horrific bleach smell was making me queasy! We finally got called to our table, after waiting for an hour and 15 minutes,  I sat down and told my husband we had to get our food to go before we even saw our waitress. I broke out in some sort of weird fever or hot sweats or something, nausea, like I was succumbing to the flu, or something. And this has never happened before, but whatever they were using to clean in that sink just did me in! And I know that's what it was....I wasn't sick prior to getting there, and felt better that night after getting home. And I know what you're thinking ""why didn't they just move away from the sink if it was so awful?""....well,I told you, smells don't usually bother me so i thought it would be fine. And I feel like such a high-maintenance, never-satisfied complainer even airing this out on the internet, but.....it was not a fun thing. And not to be overdramtic, but its been 2 days and I still feel like all I can smell at all times is bleach. Regardless, we ate our food at home. The ribs were seriously delicious, my burger was great, chili was amazing. But experience.....sub par. Had we not had this bleach experience, Id probably have much more positive memories of the evening. Its just unfortunate, because now I'm always going to be weary of going back here, even though the know the food is great. Its just weird how one small, rather insignificant thing can really throw a wrench in your outlook on a place. My advise to Twin Anchors.....your food is GREAT! But, the place is small and people get crammed together (which is totally what makes it charming) but the last thing you want is for something like bad smells to send people right back out the door. Cool it on the cleaning solutions during busy time! Or maybe use a slightly less ""odorized"" solution? But hey, at least we know its impeccably clean.",0.9693,0.724,0.155,0.121,0.5637482485308573

2015-10-05,2.0,"I don't get it. Hearing this was a Chicago staple and had amazing ribs I made my girl accompany me to Twin Anchors on a recent Chicago trip. We arrived and had to wait 40 minutes for a table on a Monday night, the place was packed, and as a BBQ fiend was I was really excited thinking about what a great experience this could be. Then I sat down and got some food. First off, the cafeteria style seating always annoys me in these older places. I know it's just how things are, but sitting a few inches from other people (who usually are half-drunk and yelling) just hurts the dining experience. That plus the wait would have me ordering to-go if I loved the food and lived in the area. Incidentally though, neither of those things ended up being the case. I'm from the South. We love our BBQ. One of the key things with BBQ is getting the flavor into the meat. The meat at Twin Anchors is completely flavorless and bland. It is very tender, which seems to be all most reviewers focus on, but tended isn't all there is to ribs. Ribs should be tender without falling completely off the bone, for one thing, but also they should be smoked or otherwise cooked slow and long with a proper rub or seasonings so the meat has a great BBQ flavor all it's own. THEN you add sauce to taste. Unfortunately the ribs at Twin Anchors had no flavor, fell completely off the bone in a boiled kind of way and just did nothing in my mouth at all. They honestly tasted like late-night diner ribs. The sauces were at least good. The ""prohibition"" sauce was a brown sugar sauce with a kick and ""zesty"" was your standard tangy sauce well done. Still, when the meat is worthless the sauce is no savior. Also the fries were standard frozen corporate mail-ins, and my root beer was half-flat. My girl loved the baked beans though, so I guess that's something. Twin Anchors is filled with framed signatures from ""famous"" people who loved the ribs, but my tourist self can't agree. Perhaps Chicago has a different goal with ribs like they do with pizza, but I'll take flavorful meat properly prepared over bland meat you eat with a fork.

I had to pull the Sweet Baby Rays out of the fridge.  I would have been better off driving through Portillos. Never again.

2015-06-20,2.0,"I have to admit, I was pretty disappointed with my experience at Twin Anchors.  The ribs were excellent.  They fell off the bone, but it would be nice if they had a normal BBQ sauce.  Of our party of four we all ordered different sauces so I had the opportunity to try every sauce they offer.  I see where the sauce has its charm, but you need to have a pallet designed for the unique to really appreciate it. The big downfall, though, was the service.  Not only did our server come to our table last each time she visited the patio, despite being sat prior to either of the tables we were next to, but we ended up waiting twenty minutes after we were done eating to finally be able to leave because the check was so slow.  I know we're college-aged kids, but we make good money, we know how to tip, we shouldn't be designated the lowest priority just because we are young.  We were sat outside (which is no big deal since we said we were willing to eat outside), and when the food runner chose to fill my already full water cup, she spilled the ice cold water (on top of an already chilly night) all over my pants.  This was greeted with a very curt ""sorry,"" after which I was given a clean towel and nothing more was said on the matter.  There was a very obvious lack of training.  I spent the rest of my night shivering. To top it off, the beers are exorbitantly expensive.  $7.50 for a white ale?  Absurd.  I don't expect to dine here again, which is too bad, with the atmosphere and the way they cook their ribs this restaurant has so much potential.",0.9616,0.822,0.123,0.055,0.5515765765765767

2015-03-26,5.0,"Twin Anchors is an unassuming little place from the outside. But it's popular for a reason, as I quickly found out yesterday. I went there for dinner with a family member. We both got the ribs with zesty sauce, and a bowl of prohibition sauce on the side. (Yes, this is the sauce-heavy style of bbq, not the dry rub. I don't mind it, but I know some people do.) Both sauces were great. The prohibition was smokier and spicier, although it's not THAT spicy. The zesty was a bit sweeter but still tangy. The ribs themselves were delicious. Very tender. By the end of the rack I was having trouble getting the meat to stay on the bones when I separated the next bone, but that's what forks are for. We both got full racks of ribs, and were glad we did - even if it seems like too much food, it's so good you're going to eat it all. Trust me. As for the service, I'll note for fairness that we got there right at opening. So we got seated immediately in an almost-empty room, and our food was apparently the first dish out of the kitchen that night. But by the time we left an hour later, the restaurant was almost full. Our waitress checked on us about once every ten minutes, and was very friendly and helpful. The restaurant was clean, including the bathrooms.

2015-01-20,5.0,"Yes, Twin Anchors ribs ARE as good as it gets. Me, the Chicago-loving, meat-eating gal that I am, am a little embarassed that last week was my first visit to Twin Anchors. The BF and I had the pleasure of dining here with a great couple (wink, wink shoutout to Caren and Joe) after my girl brought up ribs one night. We both decided, this would be the place where we can feed our rib craving! They do not take reservations, but walking in around 7pm on a weeknight, we had no problem getting a table. The restaurant itself is very casual and you will find all kinds dining/drinking here from families, couples, businessmen, etc. Twin Anchors has an old ecletic/nautical feel which makes for a very fun and easy-breezy dining expierence.  We were seated in the dining room shortly after we walked in. I am still wondering, why though, there is no dancing in the dining room. (I guess we will have to come back again and be sure to ask). Our waitress was a doll, she was very sweet and helpful as two of us were newbies to the joint. Out of character, we decided to skip the apps as the options were more like small meals, rather than a couple bite appetizers. All of us went with the natural choice of RIBS for our main. I went ahead and ordered the full slab, thinking I could have some leftovers. NO CHANCE. It's not that they were small, they were just that great that I couldn't stop once I started in on them. Bascially any delicious adjective to describe ribs here would work: juicy, succulent, fall-off-the-bone, mouthwatering, heavenly, moist (yes I went there), to-die, can't get enough....OK you get the point. In short, if you are coming to Twin Anchors, you must order the ribs, they are life-changing. We ordered the prohibition and the mild sauce. The mild was a nice classic BBQ sauce and the prohibition was good, but a bit hot. I am a coward at times when it comes to heat so I might be slightly exaggerating. The two mixed together were a perfect combo, a match made in heaven some would say. The side dishes were good...pretty typical fare here of beans, creamed spinach, fries, baked potato, and the list goes on... the one item that made me very sad to NOT see was MAC N' CHEESE. In my opinion, nothing goes better with some BBQ than a side of classic mac. (wah) Oh well, it still doesn't take away from the fabulous-ness of our meal. Despite all better judgement, and as if we weren't already filled to the brim, we went ahead and ordered the cheesecake for dessert. The four of us split one piece and it proved to be the perfect amount to satify an after dinner sweet tooth.  All in all, Twin Anchors is a classic Chicago spot where they serve no-nonsense food. The service, ambiance, and food are all 5-star, A+ and I can't wait to be back once another meat craving hits;) oh, and there's valet parking right in front as everything else is mostly permit around there.

I don't love their sides but they are appropriately tasty.  I tend to lean toward the onion rings, the caesar salad and the creamed spinach.  Nothing is going to blow your mind.

The ribs were cooked perfectly, fell right off the bone, and the Zesty sauce on top added the right amount of flavor.

Folks, please do NOT use the term 'barbecue' to describe the ribs at Twin Anchor.  They are super-meaty ribs that either have been par-boiled, baked, or nuked but there wasn't even a hint of smoke, pink rings, or even one burnt end.  This is NOT, I repeat NOT, barbecue.  I won't mention the other places in the city where you can get authentic barbecue (as evidence that I'm not trolling here on their behalf) but you can do much, much better in Chicago when it comes to real, authentic barbecue than Twin Anchors. ""Other than that Mrs. Lincoln, how did you enjoy the play?"" - The appetizer, salads, and crinkle-cut fries were ok.  The limited draft beer selection?

We still bust his chops on that 30 years later. I continued to go there when I lived in Old Town which is still one of the best areas in Chicago IMHO and I continued to go there on my birthday - which being the day after Christmas is one of the worst days to have a birthday and yes, there is a support group for us - but great because it's the only time of the year where places like this aren't wall to wall jammed. The place still looks exactly the same as the 40 years that I have been going and one of the reasons I love it.  I typically eat at the bar - easier to get a seat, excellent service and enjoy meeting/talking to the people next to me. They've really kicked up their beer selection over the years and carry an awesome selection of local craft brews.  Being a huge craft beer fan, having one of my favorite places do this brought a tear to my eye. Not really, but you know what I mean. The food? It's good, not great, but always consistent with decent portions. Fair prices, always excellent service and always either order the ribs, burger or BBQ pork sandwich. Bottom line just a great hidden away local little gem of a spot in a great area of Chicago that hasn't change in like 50+ years - if I were to have someone experience ""Chicago"" I would send them here.   I'm looking forward to taking the kids with me along the wife now on my birthday ritual.

We sat at the bar and ordered drinks while we waited for our table. Others were eating at the bar right away instead of waiting, so if you have a smaller group this might be a good option on a busy night. They call your party over a speaker when your table is ready, so you definitely won't miss your table! I really liked that our server brought us the 3 sauces to try and did not tell us what they were until after we picked our favorite. Of the 3 of us who ordered ribs- we all picked a different sauce. I went with the prohibition sauce and wow it is good! It is spicy and sweet and very sticky. I have to say that after 2 ribs I was thinking ""this is so delicious"" , after 3 ""hmm a bit of a kick to it"", and after 4 ribs my mouth was on fire! Prohibition has a gradual heat that really surprises you. But I can say this- I'm excited for leftovers (I have half a slab in the fridge!) and next time I will still order the prohibition sauce.

Because it sure as hell ain't the meat! Now, I understand that for whatever reason, y'all think this place is AMAZING. Well, it's not. I bet most of you guys haven't been south of the Mason/Dixon, and it's fucking obvious. Y'all may be able to fool each other up here in the north what the fuck BBQ is, but you can't fool a Texan. Let me tell you what...  1. Fall off the bone means BAD BBQ! BBQ should have a slight pull off the bone. Otherwise, fall off the bone means it was OVERCOOKED, BROILED, and that the cook has no idea what BBQ means. That's basic BBQ 101. And all y'all fucking flunked that lesson. 2. There was no smoke in the meat. NO SMOKE. Umm, what the fuck? Barbecue means to cook/grill over a fire and to smoke the meat. No smoke ring. No smoke flavor. Just bland meat that... fell off the bone. What's wrong with you people. Rhetorical. Don't answer. 3. No smoke means y'all rely on the sauce. Sauce is to complement the flavor of the meat. Not be the main focus and the only reason why the meat has flavor. UGH. I drenched that meat in the sauce. 4. The sauce... Jesus. You guys don't know good sauce at all. Tried all three. The ""zesty"" was the only palatable flavor. I, I just can't go on complaining. This place sucked, and sucked all the hope out of me. 5. Where were the ribs? Where was the meat!

I totally understand why some would not enjoy the food or (lack of) ambiance.  But for me, it was just PERFECT. We arrived at about 8:30 on a Saturday night.  The place was just jammed full of people, even at the bar.  They told us the wait would be about an hour.  Crap.  The bartender told us she'd help us find a spot at the bar and it was OK to eat at the bar.  Fine with us!  Sure enough, she alerted us to a couple of spots just before the occupants left.  10 minute wait, max.   We ordered the creamed spinach as an appetizer.  It was OK.  Shoulda had the onion rings, oh well.   By 9:00, the bar was pretty quiet and the restaurant was starting to quiet down.  Chicago is a big city, but it's STILL in the Midwest, after all.  :)  We could've just waited and got a spot in the restaurant. Couple of guys from Tennessee plopped down next to us and chatted us up.  One of them had lived in the area and knew the manager.  They ordered a bunch of appetizers and sides.  They each ordered a basket of french fries, two bowls of cole slaw, and an order of pork sliders.  Took the server two trips to bring all that food.  Funny shit.  We chatted with them until they left...nice fellows. My dining companion ordered a 1/2 slab and I got the full slab and we ordered a bottle of wine.  The ribs.  FABULOUS.  Our bartender brought a extra little bowl of Prohibition sauce without prompting, which made the ribs taste even better, if that's possible. To summarize: This is an old-school restaurant with no pretenses and fabulous food.  You should try it! TIPS: ---  Come here early or after 9:00 PM or be prepared for a wait ---  It's not so bad to eat at the bar, everyone we encountered was very friendly, and the bartender was great. ---  Order the Prohibition sauce ---  DON'T ORDER A BOWL OF COLE SLAW.  I like their slaw, but you'll get a big ol' soup bowl heaping full of the stuff.",0.9966,0.798,0.177,0.026,0.5240816326530614

One of these is fall-off-the-bone ribs, which are so tender that you can hardly grab the bones without the meat slipping out. Twin Anchors specializes in this, and judging by the constant sea of humanity waiting outside, they do it relatively well. I was not that impressed; the ribs are not substantial, don't have a strong pork flavor and are not smoked, and the baked beans are sweet and taste canned.

Can you just imagine?  We went on Sunday around 12:30pm and were seated immediately. The server was no-nonsense, but still friendly. We both ordered burgers, medium well. My burger was a bit undercooked but not a big deal. The fries were nothing to write home about, and neither was the burger. The prohibition sauce was good, but I wasn't blown away. Burgers were around $11 per person.  The place smells like old beer and hangovers, but in a good way. It's nostalgic and full of history. The bartender pointed out the shot glass marks on the bar where a scene from the Dark Knight was filmed, which this wife-of-a-comic-book-nerd thought was quite cool.

We would marinate them in beer, and then boil them for hours in the oven til they were falling off the bone, then sauce up to order. The prohibition sauce here was my favorite. Over the past couple years I've come to view any means of cooking ribs other than slow smoking to be sacrilege, but there's something to be said for this old school Chicago style of rib preparation. The meat is tender and falling off the bone, and for me a comforting nostalgic experience. As Chicago continues to expand it's culinary boarders perhaps we should take a pause to remember our past wasn't all that bad either. Since it wasn't offered I came up with my own rib combo.

Very bad. The ribs are just plain awful.  It would take a couple of episodes of ""CSI: Meat Mayhem"" to figure out what they did to the poor ribs they served me, but they looked - and tasted - as though they had been boiled, freezer-burned and subsequently reheated under a broiler, acetylene torch or idling CTA bus. Utterly lacking in taste and texture, the ribs were sickly gray, dry to the point of crunchiness, fused to the bone and plated with mealy, pre-frozen french fries and gloppy, soggy, fake-mayo cole slaw. In all fairness, the slender pickle slice was good.   Twin Anchors features three sauces, which are a necessary evil if you want to prevent the desiccated ribs from sticking to the roof of your mouth.  Each of the slathers was harsh and raw, evidently concocted with zero attention to refinement and subtlety. One sauce, which can best be likened to thickened tomato juice, was too bland. The second effort,  which is a vinegar-forward dip, was punishingly sharp and remarkably unflavorful. The third sauce, which costs 50 cents extra, was the most palatable of the group, even though it started out too sweet and finished too spicy.   Adding insult to injury, the pricing is egregious.  The so-called ""full slab"" of ribs, which runs $22, is actually half a slab of baby backs, thus making a so-called ""half slab"" actually a quarter slab.  Thus, we have the perfect storm of dreadful food and exploitive pricing.   Back in the day, according to the family that owns the restaurant, Twin Anchors was Frank Sinatra's favorite place for ribs.  If he dined there today, Chicago would cease to be his kind of town.",0.7808,0.807,0.106,0.087,0.5394366894366893

The meat literally fall off those wonderful bones.  They have a mild and zesty sauce. Get the zesty sauce -- it's not hot and adds just the right spices. Besides, you can dip your French fries in the zesty sauce.  A group of friends often make a night of it. Drinks at the bar while we're waiting. And then pure indulgence.

It was a Thursday night and at 6:30, a table would have been hard to come by. We started with the chips (and yummy dipping sauce) along with onion rings. Pretty standard pub fare. We did get some of the Prohibition sauce, along with the zesty sauce, for our onion rings. The Prohibition sauce is delicious! Kind of a slow burn where you don't feel the heat right away. For dinner, my husband and I split a full slab of ribs. Yes, we were charged the extra $4 to share a plate, but we did each get our own sides (he got the beans, I got the fries), plus a pickle and cole slaw each. There really was a ton of food. And for $26 total, that was a deal in my book. They have monthly bear specials. This month is some kind of autumn ale, and I really liked it. Our waitress was attentive, even though it was really busy, and she knew both the food and drink menus well. She brought my husband the wrong beer, and even though he was fine with the switch, she still took it off our bill. Extra point from me for that. Really the only knock against this place is the sandwiches/burgers are a tad overpriced. Oh, and there is absolutely nothing you can eat if you want to go healthy, but, I guess you wouldn't be heading to a tavern if that was your plan.

(especially when we may have been a bit overserved) After your first trip you will never need a menu again. Ribs are a no brainer. The only decision to make is what sauce and what side. If you like a kick go with prohibition. If you don't then go zesty. You really can''t go wrong with sides. Fries, onion rings, creamed spinich, and baked beans are amazing, but I prefer the baked tater. If you are lucky like The Animal, I may just prepare it for you. If you are like Frosty you will even enjoy a nice dinner salad with blue cheese. Still hoping to get our picture on the wall someday, but in the meantime it would be nice for Tim Meadows to join our table for one dinner, as he is a frequent visitor for carry-out.

The service was prompt and friendly, and our waitress told us that she's been there for 32 years. There are lots of fun beers on tap, and I asked the waitress for a suggestion. After her initial suggestion of Amstel (I was hoping for something a little more exotic that that), I got a nice wheat beer. I ordered the ribs and chicken, and BF got the full slab, along with a side of the Pepper Jack creamed spinach. The food came out very quickly, and I ate a rib first....it was very good, and the meat fell off the bone. The chicken was another story...it was barely warm, and so dry I couldn't eat it! Ok, now ""Pepper Jack creamed spinach"" sounds pretty damn good, right? Wrong! BF and I both took a bite and thought it was totally gross! It kinda tasted like bad spinach, cottage cheese, and a ton of garlic....ew. So half my entree and a large side portion went uneaten, but my ribs and baked potato were very good.  I don't remember the waitress checking to see if everything was ok, and the bus person whisked away our uneaten food without inquiry.

I'd pound some shots with friends, drink as many $.25 beers I could, and then like any other normal college girl, I'd head to the open till 4am BBQ joint. Okay.

That being said, I was pretty pumped to discover I lived so close to Twin Anchors. I had passed by this corner joint pretty much every day but to me, it looked like another hole in the wall bar that for some reason, valeted cars. Odd, but nothing I focused on. When a coworker raved about Twin Anchors being the best BBQ in Chicago, I kinda did a double take.  So it's a Wednesday night and the fiance and I are off for some yummy BBQ. It's a beautiful day out and we hope to sit inside to no avail. When we're confronted with either a 30 minute wait for outside seating or immediate seating inside, we chose inside. However, from what I've read online, immediate seating is hard to come by and impossible on the weekend nights.  The decor is really welcoming and comfy. Like you've been there before and everyone knows your name. While we waited, we were served some bread and crackers- totally reminded me of a small town cafe. I tried to order off the kids menu (I was daunted by the 1/2 rack of ribs) but was shut down. So I grew up, order the adult sized version, and didn't regret it. Yep, I ate all the meat off every little bone. I got it with the mildest sauce and it was yummy yummy yuuuuuhhhhhmy.

Service started well with a Carol Brady-esque server.  We ordered a full slab to share, and she told us they could split the rack in the kitchen and we could each have our own side dish.  Great idea, but next time let us know that you're going to charge us for doing so.  As we waited, we snacked on the crackers that arrived in a basket just like they do at a family restaurant - which had me slightly worried about the quality of the food to come.  I had the creamed spinach and my friend had the fries.  The creamed spinach came out spongy and tasted as if it had been sitting around for at least a few hours.  The fries were reminiscent of Ore-Ida's oven fries, except I could get them crispier at home and would have seasoned them more.  The ribs were good, tender with a zesty sauce and ready within a few minutes.   The atmosphere is outdated, dark and had a hint of sleaze as we watched a single girl at the bar desperately trying to flirt with the bartender who seemed bored by the conversation.   Bottom line - ribs are good but don't expect much more than that.",0.9783,0.831,0.126,0.043,0.47747252747252744

We started with pulled pork sliders.  Which were fine - nothing special, and the bread seemed a little stale.  Then we had the ribs, with both the original and spicy sauce.  The meat fell off the bone (almost too much, if that's possible), but didn't have a lot of standalone flavor.  And the sauces, to me, were no better than what'd you get in a store.  Again, they were ok, but it didn't equal legendary BBQ in my mind.

I knew that Twin Anchors is renowned for its pork, so I figured I'd have to ask for some BBQ sauce on the side because no matter how much sauce is on a rack of ribs, I always want more. But, the thing is, I didn't have to ask because Twin Anchors reached into the depths of my soul, saw my extraordinary desire for sauce, and brought out A POT OF BBQ SAUCE with my food!!! A POT OF SAUCE! And the sauce - oh, the sauce! - is the kind of sauce that dreams are made of. Sticky, sweet, wet dreams. I almost drank it. I may or may not have had a spoonful or two of straight sauce. (What? They gave it to me with a spoon in it!) I had the zesty sauce, but the Prohibition is awesome, too, if you like an extra kick. Not only do they serve you a pot of sauce with your meal, but if you order a basket of onion rings to start, you get a pot of sauce with those, too! So. Much. Sauce!

2010-12-12,4.0,"People are very finicky about their ribs, which accounts for the range of opinion about this place.  The ribs at Twin Anchors are not the southern-style, smoked kind, so if that's what you're used to you probably won't enjoy the ribs here. They are slow-cooked (not boiled, as many of the complainers claim) for six hours before grilling, so they do literally fall off the bone. People are also very finicky about the kind of sauce they like on their ribs. I've only had the zesty sauce at Twin Anchors, which is spicy without being overwhelming, with a sweet under-taste. If that's the kind of ribs and sauce you like, you'll love this place. If not, then you won't. We all have our own particular tastes.  Even if the ribs aren't the kind you prefer , it's worth paying a visit to this place just for the historic atmosphere; the funky nautically-themed decorations; the occasional glimpse of celebrities (if you're into that); and the beer selection (25 micro brews on tap). But make sure you go early, since seating is limited and the waits can be long. Also, you might want to take public transportation or walk it since there's only valet parking available here and legal street parking can be hard to find.

It seems that I've grown accustomed to the smokin' way and prefer a St. Louis spare rib over a baby back.   It is not the end of the world or wrong if they are not smoked. I'll eat these ribs without the sauce, just the basting that was put on them before they came out is enough. Generally, a decent rub suits me fine.  The onion rings look so appealing, but they are nothing compared to the other sides. The beans, spinach and chili all do it for me. Honestly, I kinda gravitate to a side after a few ribs, shame on me for saying that.  This place has been around for years doing the rib thang and lately some young whipper snappers around the city have gotten into the act. People are starting to think that this place is overrated, true, more than just a little. Still, the majority can't get enough of this place, majority wins.  I look at this way, if the neighborhood didn't change for the better over the decades, this place would have been long gone. I'm glad they still exist, not the typical modern day restaurant prepared ribs, not done with liquid smoke and definitely no pinkie rings. The meat completely falls off the bone and some of you know what that means. Chicago old school ribs, I wouldn't go that far. Think of these ribs as low and slow without the wood.",0.9864,0.851,0.122,0.027,0.4266666666666666

We went on a Saturday afternoon so it wasn't too crowded or busy. There were people but it was very pleasant. We ate in the outdoor covered patio and it was lovely. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful since it was our first visit. My dining companion and I split the full slab and added another side (which we really didn't need). We ordered the fries, onion rings and the order came with cole slaw and a large pickle slice (which was yummy). We had more than enough food for the two of us. We chose the zesty sauce after learning that it wasn't spicy just more tangy and not as tomatoey as the original sauce.  We ended up trying them both and the zesty was definitely the way to go. The ribs were fall off the bone tender and not charred like some rib joints. Very juicy and delicious. The sides were also awesome. Not greasy at all - the onion rings were perfect and the fries crinkle cut my favorite. The cole slaw was also right on target.  The only difficulty is choosing a beer from the really long list of bottles and drafts. Lots of locals to pick from - you really can't go wrong. I would definitely go back the food was good, great beer selection, staff friendly and the ambiance relaxing.  I'm not sure it would be at a more crowded time of day but we lucked out.

The italian salad dressing is good too, also zesty! The mild sauce is good too, but only for dipping fries etc. like a cross between ketchup and marinara. Our server was fast and attentive. What I didn't like so much - the iceberg lettuce in the salad, so blah. I personally don't like my ribs so overcooked that they fall off the bone, but that is a personal preference. I enjoy a little bone-knawing here and there. I also wished there were some crispy, charred bits on the ribs, my favorite part, here there were none to speak of. I miss you crispys!

Well, I prefaced this review with that confession because I think this restaurant gives me everything I need.  While I'm always down for trying new restaurants and fancy foods, at the end of the day the type of place that truly satisfies me is one that provides great comfort food and has an unpretentious staff that makes me feel like I'm sitting at the dinner table at home.    I came on a Saturday evening with a large group for my birthday, and having read descriptions about connections to Sinatra,The Dark Knight and Return to Me, I was sort of expecting TA to be overhyped and underperforming.  The decor was a little cheesy, and the aquatic theme made me a little wary that this place was known for its uh, ribs.  The smell of onion rings, however, instructed me to sit down and give the place a shot.  Thank goodness I listened to my nose.   What started out as a rather ordinary meal slowly became one of the best birthday meals I've ever had - not because it was some knockout gourmet meal with equally knockout prices, but rather because I was genuinely happy with the entire experience.  First of all, the server approached with a sincere smile and was patient in answering all of our large table's questions.  She even gave me her honest opinion on the sauces and sides, so I was guided towards the rib and chicken combo with creamed spinach on the side.   While the ribs weren't the absolute best I've ever had, they were perfectly cooked and flavorful, and the zesty sauce hit the right balance between hot and sweet.  The chicken was wonderfully juicy, and the creamed spinach - which some of my friends commented they didn't like - was, for me, excellent.  I loved the selection of beers on the well-laid out menu, as well as the Golden Monkey Belgian Ale I had.  For me, five hundred sexy points to the Twin Anchors for getting everything right in the food department (What, you guys don't do that too? Liars, all of you) Thanks to the Twin Anchors for a wonderful birthday (though much of that thanks has to go to my friends for the full day of fun that had this place as one of the stops).  I'll definitely come back again for a great casual meal - this place is sort of like a culinary hug that you just want to relive regularly.  Be warned that the TA gets EXTREMELY busy - right at about 5:30, half the city seemed to be waiting in the front half of the restaurant (yet I never once felt rushed).  Prices seemed to be about on-par with its rib peers.   Chicago's the best city in the world because we're both a global metropolis and neighborhood town at the same time - come here for our world-class downtown in the day, then head to the Twin Anchors for a fine meal and friendly people in the evening.",0.9992,0.766,0.22,0.014,0.516196977625549

The glean and glam of the 50-60's is off of TA, the food like many of its patrons on its last leg.  The reason boomers like this place is because the meat tears off the bone without any pulling at your teeth, so leave the sea-bond at home (hip hip, broken hip hooray). There was no flavor whatsoever on the ribs.  No caramelized sauce/ ""bark"", or any detectable dry rub.  Simply put they boiled these ribs for about an hour and then wrapped them in tin foil to bake at 325 for 4 hours brushed with a bit of sauce and served.  Thats what happens when you get old, you stop trying or you are so ingrained in the past you just cannot change.  A diner will need to order 3 extra ""zesty"" (and they use that word loosely) sauces to get any semblance of flavor from the ribs. The original sauce needs to be renamed ""something between ketchup and marinara"" because that is really what it tastes like, the zesty just has less ketchup and more pepper.   I would not return to TA, but with the 2 hour waits it will not be fading away anytime soon, and that's a real shame as they are 40 years past their prime.  Nothing here is worth noting, it was as bland as food can be, which I guess is why the average 'tre spohisticate' likes it so much.

2009-10-21,2.0,"I have been hearing about Twin Anchors ribs for years and finally, I decided to try them, but on a take out basis.  Keep in mind that sometimes when food is taken out, it doesn't quite taste the same as it might be designed for in the serving location.  So you may want to take my review with a grain of salt. I was looking forward to the ribs and couldn't wait to taste them.  I found the ribs themselves lackluster.  In fact, I found the rib meat itself, in my opinion, marginal.  Add the zesty sauce and it helps a bit, but I still didn't think the taste was all that great.  I thought to myself, am I missing something here?  So I also tried the chicken - which I actually found better than the ribs.  The sauce complimented the chicken well, but it made for an interesting contrast with the ribs. I also tried the sides of creamed spinach and baked beans.  The beans were adequate, but I have to say I was disappointed in the creamed spinach -- and I really like creamed spinach.  I have a strong feeling the spinach is better when it is eaten on site since it has cheese in it.  My take home spinach tasted much like a quiche. I may try Twin Anchors again later and see if eating in makes a difference, but I regret to say that if I need to be taking ribs home again, I will probably try some other place.  I was just so disappointed in the ribs.

It was right before dinner time so they weren't too busy. We liked that they give you a bread basket with rye bread and onion, garlic and plain breadsticks (those were a hit). The waiter was nice and we ordered the ribs right away (we shared) with creamed spinach and I had a salad with fat free honey mustard. So....they used iceberg lettuce for the salad...it tasted like nothing and was boring to say the least.  I had hoped for mixed greens...but that's ok. The ribs were fine...they were NOTHING special at all and If people are saying they are the best they've have had....I feel bad for them.  This place has been around since the 30's they should have this stuff perfected!  We couldn't stand the BBQ sauce that came with the ribs and luckily they were lightly basted, so it was cooked into the ribs.  We didn't use the bowl of BBQ sauce they put on the table.  The coleslaw was yummy and I liked the creamed spinach, but my BF was not impressed. Boston Market's creamed spinach is much better. This place is ok, and perhaps the other items on the menu are better...

A real iconic and nostalgic Chicago institution that looks like it hasn't changed a thing since it was opened.  The atmosphere is great. Old looking bar area with booths and coat racks for each table. Small dining room in the back that was busy and casual. Everyone from large families to couples were enjoying themselves. The waitstaff is casual and friendly. There's a nautical theme to the place, hence Twin Anchors. And this was a reported favorite haunt of Sinatra back in the day. So I was sold. We had a short wait, while we sat at the bar, and I was surprised to see the great selection of beer they had. I expected your typical Miller and Amstel type list, but they had a good cross section of microbrews as well. I knew what I was getting before we even saw the menus. The RIBS. I had heard and read a lot of good things about them. And It's listed as the house specialty. I was a little skeptical though, because I love ribs, and if they were in fact that good, I'm sure I would have had them by now. But I had high expectations. Let me  just say that the ribs were the only disappointment about the place. And they were a total disappointment. I found them to be bland, and yes, they were of the ""fall right off the bone"" variety. Literally. You couldn't pick up a bone without the meat falling right off. And that in my book is not how true BBQ ribs are supposed to be. The meat is supposed to be tender and flavorful, but there should be a slight tug to the meat. My suspicion is that they boil the ribs first and then grill them. Unlike real deal BBQ places that hickory smoke the meat for hours under low heat. And the sauce itself should be something secondary entirely. If the meat is that good, you really shouldn't even require much sauce. I have to agree with some of the more negative reviews about this place with regard to the ribs. If anyone claims these are the best ribs in Chicago, then I seriously have to question their judgement, including Frank Sinatra. ( though I'll let it slide since Fat Willey's and Smoque did not exist back then.)  I don't think it's even fair to mention Twin Anchors ribs in the same sentence as  Fat Willey's and Smoque. Those places are the best I've had in town so far. And TA's rib plate is $20 with one side. For shame. However, I really did like almost everything else about the place, and I would come back in a second with the caveat that I will try anything else except the ribs.",0.9878,0.797,0.14,0.064,0.4896934865900382

If you have eaten real bbq, avoid at all costs. That being said, I enjoy everything else about this place.  The service is great, the drinks are great, the sides and any food that is NOT bbq, great.

The only thing I've learned after 7+ years of Twin Anchors dining experiences is that I've (sort of) learned the virtue of patience between these four walls... some things are just worth waiting for. However, I've also learned the virtue of too many cocktails waiting out rib love delight at the bar. Do I taste floor? Yes, Messy Brett, you do.  2. If you are waiting, you're in luck! TA has a hefty tap selection... My fav happens to be the Shiner Bock, although you're certainly not limited to that, grab yourself something foamy and check out the hot memorabilia. The feature films Return to Me and Dark Knight (yes, that Dark Knight) both feature the Deuce Anchors in cameo!  3. Zesty. That's all you need to know. You get the slab of ribs and you get the zesty sauce. It doesn't mean spicy, you Namby Sissy Puss, it means ZESTY (adjective. Pronunciation: \zes-t\ : having or characterized by zest : appealingly piquant or lively)... see, appealing! It's so tangy tasteriffic you'll want to dip everything in it... and go right ahead. The crispy onion rings and crinkle fries make great sauce-to-mouth vessels.  4. Ribs that fall off the bone are utterly fabulous, but quite messy.

The ribs were far from the meatiest I have ever tried, though they had a nice overall texture - lightly crunchy on the surface & fairly delicate inside, and they fell off the bone pretty easily.  I'd say that they were more than acceptable but not spectacular. Fortunately I was with two other diners so we had other dishes to share.  I'd rank the onion rings about the same as the ribs - good but not great.  The Pepper jack creamed spinach was interesting if you have a taste for hot stuff.  Surprisingly, my favorite dish ended up being their cheeseburger, the meat was tender & juicy without being sloppy, and tasted great with grilled onions.

We ordered some drinks but were very weak.  I could not taste any vodka with my cranberry juice, so that sucked.  But the staff were fast and nice.  Finally when we got a table in the back, the waitress came by quickly to see what we wanted.  We ordered the vegetarian sloppy joes w/beans, cheeseburger w/fries and a basket of fries.  I wasn't that hungry and was craving fries ; )  The food came quickly and it was soo good.  The fries were so hot that it burned the top of my mouth =P  I dipped them in bbq sauce and were really tasty.  The sloppy joe was good but VERY spicy!  My other friend like the cheeseburger and said it was really soft and juicy.

The Twin Anchors claim to fame is their ribs. I, being a pollotarian (I think I just made that up), do not eat ribs. The crowd here is a mix of tourists and locals. We had a long wait at the bar before we were called, but we made do with mixed drinks and people watching. This place is loud and I can imagine that it gets even louder as the night progresses. After we were sat, I skimmed the menu thinking that there would be nothing I could order, but I was pleasantly surprised to see a sandwich called the Soynatra. The menu boasts that Frank Sinatra used to drop by and have his bodyguards block the payphone so that people couldn't call their friends over. My dad joked that Ol' Blue Eyes wouldn't have been too happy to know that there was a soy-based sandwich bearing his name on the menu. I ordered this sandwich and fries. Both the sandwich and the fries were huge orders. I had to cut the sandwich in half to even attempt to hold it up. Compared to many veggie bbq sandwiches I have eaten, this stacked up. The fries were plentiful and hearty. I didn't finish the sandwich or the fries, but Zachary had the sandwich a couple of days later for lunch and was impressed at its' meatiness. I have to add a star since I would have given this place a 2, but the other three people in my party loved it.
