The okra wasn't what I was expecting, being a stew. This was an umami bomb!!!! The flavor was amazing, and the okra was beautifully cooked. They kinda seemed like little tortellinis, exploding with flavor as they were bitten.  The bread that came with the order was also amazing, making a perfect vehicle for the okra broth and the leftover crumbly bits of the liver! Overall I'm super happy with my order. My only piece of advice is to be more descriptive on the online menus, but I'm totally nitpicking.  I should mention that my 4 year old daughter inhaled the livers and the okra, and she's going through a picky food phase. She almost cried when the food was gone and asked me to order more!

2017-04-25,2.0,"The food is great, I've been to Turkey a few times and this stuff comes pretty damn close to what I've eaten in Turkey. That being said, their staff/customer service leaves a lot to be desired. A few weeks ago, I called in to order and I was thinking about getting the lentil soup. I have a mild sensitivity to some types of lentils so I asked what type they used in the soup. The person I spoke to didn't know, which is fine, but also didn't want to go through the effort of finding out, which was a bit of a letdown. Then today I put in an order online for lunch and got the falafil special. On their online menu, it's clearly listed under the category of veggie meals which states a choice of rice or bulgur. I specified bulgur in the order, picked it up, and noticed there was no bulgur when I got home. So I called them and they said the falafil special doesn't come with bulgur. I said their online menu shows it comes with rice or bulgur and they said that the other ones come with it but the falafil one doesn't, despite the fact that their menu states items in the veggie meal category come with a choice of rice or bulgur and in no way specifies the falafil special as an exclusion to that. In the end, they didn't offer to give me the bulgur that, according to their menu, I was suppose to receive. Heck, they didn't even do the absolute bare minimum of apologizing for the confusion which is completely due to the menu they wrote up.  I love their food, and I eat here a couple of times a month.

My only frustration is that I can't remember the name of anything to order it again, so I order the same thing  pretty much whenever I visit the restaurant! Luckily, the hubs always orders pide, so at least I get a taste of that delightfulness. I do have one small concern with the restaurant, and that's cleanliness/hygiene.

For a light appetizer, we ordered the fried cream cheese and spinach rolls. They were crispy on the outside and soft and creamy Inside. The inside was very hot. It seemed like they were just out of the fryer. The veggie stew was awesome - very rich and tasty with some fresh herbs as garnishes on top. It had so many vegetables, such as squash, green beans, potatoes, carrot, okras, and many others. Also, there were many cloves of garlic, which absorbed the flavor of the stew. They were soft and flavorful, not garlicky at all. Even if you don't like garlic, you'll like it. I highly recommend the stew. We also got the kofte kebab. There were four lamb patties.

It is homemade dough with peppers, mozzarella cheese, zucchini, and tomatoes. The dough is soft and chewy while the flavors are slightly similar to pizza except there is no tomato paste. The kibbe resembles a fried dumpling but is stuffed with ground beef and onions. Both were very good choices.  For entrees, we had the iskenderw ith lamb, lamb shank, vegetable stew, and baked eggplant. We're obviously huge fans of lamb and vegetable. The iskender came in a platter that was evenly divided by lamb cubes and a thick yogurt sauce. There were also cubes of pan-fried bread that did a swell job of soaking up the lamb essence. The flavors are quite bold with this one. The lamb shank was particularly juicy and tender in which the meat easily came off the bone. The vegetable stew consisted of baked eggplant, zucchini, carrot, potatoes, mushroom, green beans, okra, green and red peppers, onions, and tomatoes. It was definitely a mix of everything which is great considering how we had so much meat and carbs with the other items on the table. The baked eggplant resembled a lasagna in which there were layers of tomatoes, onion, green and red peppers, parsely, and pine nut.

The waiting service was stellar as when we weren't particularly satisfied with the fried liver, they returned with a fresh dish which were 10-folds better. I especially love their complimentary warm basket of pide bread. Cafe Orchid located just east of the Addison Brown Line makes it ultra easy to get to. The line up of our dinner was extravagant to say the least: (1) Babaganoush. Grilled eggplant purée with tahini, fresh lemon juice, garlic and olive oil for a silky smooth consistency similar to texture of oatmeal. Very addictive, especially paired with their freshly baked bread.  (2) Arnavut Cigeri. Fried beef liver cut into cubes mixed with potato fries and a large side of onions, lemon zest and paprika. Trying this dish was quite the brave stride towards tasting authentic Turkish cuisine, but that's what I'm all about - trying new exotic things. (3) Hunkar begendi. Sultan delight. Eggplant purée sautéed in mozzarella cheese with lamb, onions, bell peppers, olive oil and bulgar. A Turkish twist along the same vein of hummus and polenta, a cheesy eggplant paste served with a plate of grains. Pairs well with practically any thing from bulgar, rice to bread.  (4) Kebab combo.

Not really a descriptive answer, so I  ordered the lamb kabab and it came with bulgur wheat. Excellent. I had to ask for some yogurt sauce to go with. The yogurt tzaziki was really good as was the hot pepper sauce. The price point was very good. I would probably order take out from here. I sat on the patio and it was nice weather, but the floor had not been swept from the dinner service from the night before. The door from the kitchen opens to the patio.  The food is tasty, but the restaurant's appearance needs a little work. There was no salt or pepper on the patio tables. Service was as needed.

I only cared about the fact that they serve turkish food because let's face it, it is the best food around. This cuisine breathes years of tradition and culture and there should be more restaurants around that serve it.  On to cafe orchid. The food does not match the decor, but for those that have been here know that. Its has a very run down, low budget patio that is more of an eye sore but if you can surpass that little issue than your visit will be pleasant because the food is amazing.

Thank goodness my son asked if we can order out of the diner menu.  We did. The waiter made a few mistakes and brought the wrong order.  We did not complained because we were all hungry. There was another customer in the whole restaurant so there is no need for confusion nor mistakes unless your cell phone is more important .  And your customer are not that important.  I think the food had too much raw garlic and excessive amounts of cumin on all the food.  Most dishes tasted the same.  Except for the fried chicken livers. Nope not coming back here 1  for bad service.  The food too similar nothing special.  Nothing had the wow factor.  I don't understand why the commission with the ratings.  Perhaps people do not cook much or not at all to say the food is good.  My taste buds did not like it sorry,-0.3151,0.81,0.09,0.1,0.6031097374847374

Nothing pisses me off  more than going to a restaurant expecting it to be good (after seeing it on Check Please) and then being royally letdown.  In this case, it was with the food, not the service!   Ordered the falafil special ($8.50), falafil, hummus, babaganoush, green salad.....and according to the menu was suppose to come with rice or bulgar.  According to the order taker this was a mistake on the menu.  What???  Then why not block it out?  I'm sure if there was a increase in the prices it would been dutifully noted.  In all my years of going to a restaurants, I've never ever experienced this!!! And while I'm at it, their carry-outs section is odd.  C O has the strangest set-up for ordering and picking up carry-outs.  There's no sign or anything, you have to inquire where it's at, in this case it's by the kitchen where the swinging doors are?  They don't even have a waiting area, you have to sit on one of their folding chairs. Huh? To make matters worse inside the kitchen is where they have the cash register and the server does double duty answering the phone and serving the food.!  This is weird, not to mention unsanitary. Food, a disaster too.  My falafil was cleverly refried, not fresh and not cooked in the middle. Hummus, bland, bread not pita, nothing to write home about, salad just meh, along with the babaganoush.  No lunch specials either.

They have an outdoor patio seating area that is enclosed and can be dined at, it's well insulated. Ordered drinks and took forever for them to arrive.  The zucchini pancakes were not worth it, $7.95 for 3 cakes and they definitely have fillers. Also not very good, super greasy and burnt. Came with yogurt sauce and some parsley mixed into the sauce. The white beans salad was great, also $7.95, but I could easily make it at home. Regardless, it was a large size. Then we also got the meat pies, they really are meat dumplings. They were good but for $8 4 pieces, super thin, also seems a bit of a rip off. Also came with yogurt sauce. Lastly we got the fried liver, it says on the menu best fried liver in Chicago. They were nice, the liver were well breaded, came with shredded pieces of french fries. Also came with an onion and tomato salad on the side. However, if eating liver is not something you do often, you may find the taste of liver offensive. The restaurant was busy, that probably explains why the service was lacking. My water was only refilled once during my entire meal. However, for what it's worth, I'd definitely come back. they have a lot of different varieties.

They were perfectly fried supper tender not dry not greasy at all. The liver was so flavorful not bland at all. Then theres these lil fries that add another crunch element to the dish. The onion salad was amaizin! It cut through the richness of the liver. Then the lemon added a nice note of acidity this is a must order if u love liver n if u dont this will turn u into a lover $6.50 Falafel: best falafel i ever had because it was so flavorful. I never them with so much seasoning in them. Then there is a delish salad on the side i love Mediterranean food cause theirs always a salad on the side. the falafel is so crunchy and not greasy at all. It comes with two sauces. I didnt like the tahini sauce the other one is delish the perfect dipping sauce 6 come in an order $ 7.95 Zucchini pancake: omg so good! I would just come back for these! Their so rich i never thought vegetables could taste so good. Their really big n not greasy! These are tje best fritters i ever had their so good! Theirs feta cheese in it that adds a nice rich creamy salty flavor! The dippin sauce is really rich and pairs perfectly with the fritter.  21.95 Kebab mix combo: omg if u love kababs u will love this! My least favorite was the gyro meat. Not saying that it was grows it was just meh every other thing on the dish was way more flavorful. However, it was tender and not ur typical frozen nasty gyro meat that u get at chicago stands. The chicken was amaizing! Supper tender and so flavorful i couldnt stop eating it. I was really surprised on how good it was! There is this really long sausage idk what it was called but it was phenomenal it was the best thing of the meal it was so tender! The other sausage patty was really delish! The pita was really flavorful n their homemade! The sauce was really good really fresh Iskender: omg this was phenomenal. The sauce is so rich and so full of flavor.

Although I was glad to try Turkish food for the first time, I wasn't wowed enough for a repeat visit. To my untrained palate, Turkish food seems similar to Greek food. (The menu included hummus, dolma, musakka, gyro, baclava and other familiar favorites.) According to rudimentary research, Turkish food tends to be a little more flavorful, seasoned with warm allspice or bay leaves and seasoned with a heavier hand. You'll often see yogurt on the side. More than anything, I remember my meal as oily. To be a little healthier, I ordered the Sahanda Kebab, lamb meatballs (""kofte"") sauteed with red and green pepper, tomato and potato; although I liked the flavor, the entire dish was blanketed in a thin layer of shining olive oil. (I preferred my leftovers, because after refrigerating overnight, I could skim some of the excess oil from the top.) The service was a little spotty--a new waitress at every turn. On the bright side, I would recommend our dessert to anyone with a sweet tooth. At the waitress' suggestion, my friend and I split künefe, a bufala cheese-stuffed phyllo pastry soaked in honey.

It comes with bulgur (or rice) and a salad.  We have also had the Sultan Delight and Uskudar.  Although they are traditional dishes and are both fine, I pretty much just go straight for the Adana or Lamb kebabs each time.  Overall we have probably dined at Cafe Orchid 10-15 times and I think we were only disappointed one time (the lamb kebabs were over cooked). The service is perfect for us as they tend to check in 2-3 times during the course of the evening always in a passive/relaxed manner.  So many servers seem to either forget you still exist after the food is brought to the table or, worse, stop by and ask how the food tastes every 6 minutes.  The servers seem to have found a nearly perfect balance of attending to your needs without being an annoying pain in the backside. And, of course, Cafe Orchid is BYOB.  Always a plus.  In addition, while the weather is nice, we like to eat outside.  The seating is on Addison and not far from the street, but it adds an element of energy and city living that we enjoy.",0.9911,0.791,0.158,0.051,0.6403645833333333

The location is very convinient, the place and staff was warm and welcoming but the food was terrible. We ordered ""eggplant musakka, Iskender, manti and Adana kebab"".   I know how a Turkish food should taste. Besides I cook almost all of the dishes listed in the menu at home! Eggplant musakka was very good if it was less salty. It took us a long time to have the musakka gone although we die for it.  The yogurt used in Manti and Iskender was a cheap store bought variety and was diluted with water.  I would expect them to make their own yogurt or at least buy Greek yogurt like Chobani! Manti was overcooked. The meat was almost out of the dough! A good manti must be cooked little more than al dente. Also they used too much cumin in the tomato sauce.  Gyro meat tasted good although it was not a pure beef leaves. But how it was cut was a no no. If you go to Turkey you should have seen how cooks treat this delicious gyro meat: Cut as thin as a paper. Mine was like a chucks of ground beef. As to the sauce, again so much cumin and salt! Adana kebab was the best of all. The spiciness and how it was cooked was great. But the rice came with it was so dry and tasteless. They should learn how to cook basmati rice. The salad was no where close to a real turkish salad! At the end we asked for tea, expecting this would be good.

My favorite thing to eat in Turkey was manti (Turkish ravioli) so I was relieved to see Cafe Orchid offered it (and they have a vegetarian version too!) The manti, while tasty, are way bigger than authentic manti. Manti in Turkey are tiny- almost like spaetzle. These were like tortellini. But very tasty. I'd get it again. Husband got some kind of kabob, maybe kofte? He was happy with it. We also tried the icli kofte and they were pretty tasty (tasted like what we ate on our trip). The only thing that was actually not good that we ended up tossing was the mucver- zucchini pancakes. These were really gross. Huge and SO GREASY. Like a big greasy sponge. I think they just hadn't been fried in hot-enough oil. They were oozing oil even in the box, and we each tried a bite and just couldn't stomach them. I was sad because they're usually great.

When we arrived at the restaurant, we were disappointed to find no parking in the lot; however there were numerous quick spots to the left of the restaurant; great, problem solved!  We get seated quickly in the indoor/outdoor makeshift portion of the restaurant. It wasn't fancy date worthy, but definitely a fine ambience for Thursday evening.  We received warm Turkish break with olive oil and butter. We had the sigara borek as the appetizer and it was delicious! It was just how I remember it as a child. This is a crispy cigar shaped phyllo dough and cheese vehicle of deliciousness. In addition to this, I ordered the Iskender and my husband ordered the manti. These were both the most authentic Turkish food that I have had outside of Turkey! The Iskender was very filling and both had an option of tomato or butter sauce. The icing on the cake came when we asked for the check, and our wonderful Turkish waitress apologized for any wait we experienced and gave us the most delicious baklavah. We were in heaven. This baklavah wasn't too syrup-y or dry, it was perfect. She was so polite and apologetic, despite the fact that everything came out on time! We appreciated her making that extra effort!

We had to ask for extra bread few times, we had to get up and remind the waiters for things ourselves..so pretty much it was an awful experience! And then I understood why: the waiter charges 20% of tip included in the bill ( not even 18%!!) because we were a large party not caring of course if we were upset or not about the service! And the to top it off..the waiter overcharged us, charging more a credit card stating that they forgot to include the desserts we ordered! What?? How can 3 desserts be over 50$?

My friend and I ordered the Chicken shish with bulgar and shared a lentil soup and green salad.  This was for a delivery service. Estimated wait time of 50 minutes. Actual time took was a lot faster than estimated, I believe it was somewhere around 30 minutes.  Lentil soup was very delicious. Smokey, thick and had really well developed flavor. The salad was perfectly dressed, the greens and veggies were crisp and tasty. Surprising considering the fact that it had to be delivered and generally salads are soggy messes. The dressing had perfect acidity and fruity notes of the olive oil really came out and complimented the salad well.  Finally onto the chicken shish. Cubes of chicken charred to juicy perfection. Upon initial glance, it looked as though the chicken would be dry cause of the appearance but boy it was JUICY! The bulgar that came with it was red and cooked in tomato paste. Paired very well with the succulent chicken. The meals usually come with a jajik? I believe, and a spicy red pepper paste that resembles sambal. I dipped the bread that they gave us in both sauces and scarfed it down with my meal, it was delicious.

2014-08-24,5.0,"Cafe Orchid is an awesome Turkish restaurant that is easy to miss, nestled in the corner of Lincoln and Addison by the el. Everything I've tried here is great: kabobs, shawarma, falafel- which is some of the best in the city. My personal favorite is the kefta kabob, probably the best kefta I've had- ground meat mixed with spices and onions for a wonderful tender explosion of flavor. It comes with bulgur or basmati rice, but I prefer the bulgur, a grain that is amazingly seasoned here, rich and a bit greasy, that blends with the meat so well. Really good food, and the (presumably Turkish) waitresses are pretty smokin', which doesn't hurt either. I'd like to bang a Turkish woman. They are really sexy, with their sultry almond skin and exotic, smoke-filled, Arabian mystique. But I digress. The point is, come here with friends and a bottle of wine and enjoy the pleasant ambiance and delicious food while you fantasize about your steamy encounter with a beautiful Turkish woman, hear your friends' laughter dimly in the background while you smile distantly, feeling warm but far away due to the wine, your thoughts really focused on your night of passion, this mysterious creature shifting in and out of layers of flowing fabric as she dances sensually around you, your drunken reverie exploding into a passionate exploration of untold lands, united in a state of foreign and illicit bliss, until you are brought back to reality by the somber stacking of chairs behind you and the check being passed around the table, because you were too shy to say anything, even though you swear she smiled only at you when you walked in. There's no point, she's out of your league, and it could never be as good as your fantasy anyway. At least that's what you tell yourself, to justify your inaction, the never ending stream of empty booze filled nights and broken dreams. So go home and drink another bottle of Jack, and wake up tomorrow for another day of good food, wine, friends, and the promise of something- your fantasy, your princess, who will carry you away to a world of adventure and endless possibility.

2014-08-23,5.0,"We came here after a Cub game. Yes, we were sober. It was a Cubs/Cardinals game, and, as it turns out, it was the Cub game with highest attendance of the season. Lucky us. Love crowds. Who doesn't? Meanwhile, let me go off on a tangent for a moment: We sat next to Cards fans, and, to add to the fun, about 97 percent of the crowd was wearing red. Thus, the Cubs lost, as is expected in these circumstances. I had high hopes, but my North Side Nine let me down, like bad boyfriends. You love them, and they crush your soul. So it goes. To add insult to injury, I missed the Ernie Banks plastic statue giveaway by minutes. My Cards fan neighbor got one, having entered the field 75 seconds before I did, and offered it to my husband for 20 bucks. (Really?) He wanted to buy a Wrigley Field t-shirt across the street, on his way back to Peoria, and the gist of this deal was that he could not afford that piece of cloth otherwise. Apparently, 20 bucks (for FREE plastic Ernie) stood between him (and us) and the ridiculously overpriced T shirt.  Here's the thing. If I happened to find myself at Busch Stadium, and was handed, say, an Albert Pujols plastic thing, 1. Aside from Plastic Albert, I could probably afford a stupid, overpriced T-shirt; having had enough money to travel a good distance (gas, food, time off work, etc.)  to get there,  and 2. I'd give the damned thing to a fan, regardless of my situation. (Give. Meaning 'for free.') Anyway. So Cubs lost, which to a Cub fan,  is neither here nor there. Once free of the field, we wandered down Addison, having avoided Cubby Bear, Sluggers, Blah Blah Tool Frat Fool Bar...only to find Cafe Orchid. It's BYOB, as a friendly waitress/greeter told us, so we headed down Lincoln toward a liquor store. Because at this point, life without liquor seemed bleak. By the way, (as my story becomes increasingly tangential) this  area looks like it's seen better days. Funny how that happens. Give it a block, and the real estate prices would soar, and the hipsters would probably open coffee shops and/or distilleries, and sniff at your lower class lower classiness. And so it goes. Anyway, we found one. (not a hipster. A liquor store.)  To my delight, a sign on the door said, ""No cell phones. They are insolent and vexing."" How I love thee. Meanwhile, the woman behind the counter scowled at us --can't blame her, given the long gone, last chance, Mad Max block she worked in--but once we settled on our libation and appeared able to pay (again, can't blame her) she softened. And smiled. So we ambled back to Orchid. You're waiting for my review, aren't you? ...and you are saying, ""Jesus, woman! Make your point!"" Ok, here it is. I love this place. First, soft lighting, sit where you want. Then, ""Would you like some ice for your BYOB?"" Then, ""Would you like appetizers?"" Then...here's the ""then""...they don't rush you. If you want to hang out and work your way through your BYOB, so be it. Want to linger over your appetizer? Go right  ahead.care  to stare at other tables for a bit? You got it. They don't push. (But, hey, don't take advantage of their kindness. They might need the table, so be cool.)   And then, the food. It was all so good. The spinach pie, the feta plate, the kibbeh, the iskendar, the mantar sote...oh, and the Turkish coffee may be the best we've ever had this side of Istanbul. The staff is kind, courteous, knowledgeable, and efficient.

2014-08-12,4.0,"It took me a long time to get back to Cafe Orchid.  I am going to bump them to 3.5 stars based on the food, but the service still needs some work, at least up front.  After we sat down, the wait and bus staff were great.  But upon entering, a gruff woman serving as hostess (but later waiting tables), inquired whether we had a reservation.  Upon finding out that we did not, she sort of exasperatedly cast about the patio area and then brusquely indicated a two-top for us to occupy.  I really hate it when places make walk-in parties feel like a burden compared to reservation parties.  Two aspects of this really chapped my hide in this case:  1.) when we came in at 6:30, only half a dozen tables in the entire place were occupied; then, when we left at 7:30, about two-thirds of them were.  Clearly they were not lacking for space.  And 2.) we were not offered a choice of indoors or outdoors.  I strongly preferred to sit inside, but instead we ""enjoyed"" the hot patio, where the westering sun shone directly into my left eyeball for twenty straight minutes.  It didn't dispose me positively towards the meal. Thank heavens that the food was great.  My wife and I split a nice babaganoush served with their excellent house bread.  I stole a few bites of her ala turca entree (chicken breast stuffed with spinach and cheese), which was tasty but no match for mine, the sahanda kebab.  It was just pieces of chicken cooked with green and red peppers and a tomato sauce, but sometimes simplicity can be brilliant.  I would definitely order that dish again.  It was all filling, too:  I took home at least half of my entree and rice. There are several other enticing house specialties that I'd like to try, so I think that we will be back.  But a word of advice to Cafe Orchid:  keep churning out great food and don't make your walk-in business feel like second-class citizens.  You clearly are not that dependent upon reservations if your restaurant was one-third empty at 7:30 on a Saturday night.",0.9948,0.777,0.173,0.05,0.4812224812224811
2014-08-10,2.0,"I came here on a Saturday evening at 7. They have cute outdoor seating areas, which was our preference because it was a gorgeous Chicago summer night, but when asked if we had a reservation (we didn't), the hostess seemed annoyed that we asked to sit outside. She put us in a tiny corner, handed us menus and then neglected to return for at least 10 minutes. We got bread about 15 minutes into the experience. Service was definitely weak throughout the meal, except for the girl who kept refilling our water glasses...she was like a ninja - sneaking up out of the shadows the instant your water glass got lower than half full! They also got a star for honoring my request for lemon and cucumber for my water.  I had the chicken kabobs and asked to substitute hummus for the rice/bulgar option. Not allowed. (I find that seriously annoying! Hummus is just as cheap to make as rice/bulgar, so it doesn't cost that much more to substitute it, and I would've paid extra if she would've let me!) The waitress added extra salad, since I didn't want rice/bulgar. The salad (lettuce, tomato, red onion, vinaigrette) was bland and I only ate a few bites. It took up over half of my plate. There were about 6 or 7 cubes of chicken, which were cooked to perfection and delicious. They were served on top of half a pita, which did not appear (or taste) to be freshly made. For the price (around $14) it wasn't a great value or that tasty.  Overall the place is fine I guess, but there are much better options around the city, and for less money!

Second we were seated by our server who never said hi or even made eye contact, just threw us on the table and never cared to come back to ask  if i wanted something to drink or if i needed assistance with the menu. He deliberately waited until we put the menus down to just come and take our orders. No eye contact, no smile, no  caring for his customers. When we did order it was so hard for him to understand how i wanted my dish and was bothered because i asked a question, even if your English is not good, you can always make an effort.  After the food came of course he didn't check on us despite having only 2 more tables. The food saves this place. Everything we tried was great.  I hope they train their servers better and teach them that in a city like this with so many options, it is not enough to have order takers, good hospitality goes beyond that.",0.4185,0.729,0.135,0.136,0.4792328042328042

The kebabs were also good.

We were given food, but no silverware - clear oversight on the part of the gentleman. Upon calling him, he gave me the 'look' as though I had done something horribly wrong.

Our food came within 15 minutes and we quickly scarfed it down as we could tell the staff was antsy to close (as they kept staring at us).  Suggestions for the restaurant's staff and manager:  1.  Stop accepting dine-in customers at least an hour before closing time (so your customers won't feel rushed), 2.  Please get some space heaters and/or offer indoor seating when there is freezing temps outside, 3.  Please learn some basic customer service skills (i.e., don't stare at the guests, don't rush their experience, make them feel comfortable, etc.).   The food was okay, however the coldness in the porch and rushed feeling put a complete damper on the entire experience.  If we weren't visiting from out of town and staying at a hotel downtown, we would've probably taken our food to-go.  To conclude, we walked out of the restaurant at 10:58pm, we didn't want to take up any more of their time than necessary.",0.9528,0.913,0.07,0.017,0.5155982905982907

Getting here is pretty easy, it's a block from the Brown line and there's street parking in addition to their free parking lot. The servers are friendly and aim to please, but getting your food can be a little slow when it's busy.  So what makes this a 5 star restaurant? BYOB + excellent food = great value.

2013-06-03,1.0,"I frequently trust the Yelp aggregate score, especially with a restaurant like this where 252 reviews are on the books. Unfortunately, I beg to differ in this case. This was quite possibly the most disappointing meal my girlfriend and I confronted in the last three years. I speculate that on the night we ate, the cook called in sick and the employees were on food preparation duty, which probably ticked them off. Atmosphere:  We were the only two at the establishment on a Monday night. The servers, who appeared quite bitter throughout the night, sat in the server area, watching us eat our entire meal. Incredibly uncomfortable. We thought we had showed up right before they were closing, but a quite check on the cell phone showed they were seating until 10pm. So why the attitude? I asked my server what was different between ""Adana"" and ""Kofte"" and he had the nerve to grab my menu, turn the page to the index, and coldly suggest that I read the descriptions. It was almost enough for me to stand up and walk out right then and there. The servers continued to watch us throughout the night, so my girlfriend and I had to whisper about how bizarre and awkward the whole situation was. Food Quality:  Terrible. Disgusting, even. My kofte (ground lamb, thx guyz!!) was rare as can be. It sat on a bed of croutons drenched in oil (mild spicy butter sauce...hahahhahaha). The yogurt was straight out of the bottle and ran like a white river. My girlfriend's falafel was even worse. It seemed as though the falafels were frozen, and the cook simply dropped them into hot oil, burnt the outside, but the heat did not penetrate to the middle. In other words, the middle of the falafels was completely uncooked, and the outside was burnt. She was spared the bed of oil-drenched croutons and instead received a pretty good onion and tomato salad. Service:  Rude and slow. I especially disliked the server who grabbed my menu from me and turned the pages instead of answering my question. Nobody was particularly friendly. We nearly laughed when they asked us if ""we would be having dessert this evening?"" Later that Evening:  We both felt sick and bloated after this meal. I do not usually leave such negative comments--feel free to check my other reviews if you would like--but this experience was so terrible that it was worth my time and effort.  Overall:  There is no way a restaurant like this can survive in the competitive Chicago market....I don't know how it still exists. Please do not head to Cafe Orchid on a Monday night. If you do, watch out for the medium-built, long-haired server who doesn't smile.",-0.9286,0.791,0.091,0.118,0.5393306379155438

We came at 7 PM and had to wait for a couple of minutes for a table as a large party was being held. This was our first time eating at the restaurant but had had food catered through our church at a recent luncheon. We had the shepherd salad with feta which was light and refreshing. I made a special request for vegetables to come alongside the baba ganoush and our server was very accommodating and suggested they could serve it with cut up cucumber slices (instead of the delicious pita bread they offer as I am attempting to adhere to a gluten free diet). For our entrees, my fiance had the chicken kabobs with bulgar which he said was great and the chicken was flavorful and moist. I had the Orchid's favorite - chicken drum sticks marinated in olive oil, lemon and herbs. The chicken drum sticks were aaaaamazing! And I never ever ever get excited about chicken. In fact, I think it's the most boring thing to order and rarely ever order it when out to eat.

My boyfriend and I have gone here several times for dinner and I've brought clients here for lunch - the food has been excellent, the service was spotty - sometimes really nice, sometimes a little confused and sometimes we were made to feel as if we were intruding. But I always came back, recommended it to friends and family alike, etc... However, tonight - we were treated like lepers.  It was about 8:30, maybe closer to 9 and the place was busy, I'll give them that, but when I asked if we could have coffee and dessert (we had already dined at the place we had our first date but I was craving Turkish coffee - and this was the place we had another one of our first dates and probably a 5th and a 10th, lol. Like I said, I was a fan) we were told that they are not a ""coffee house"" and we would not be seated.  So we took our business elsewhere - found delicious Bosnian coffee, which is very similar. The waiter at Restaurant Sarajevo welcomed us graciously, even though they were close to closing - he said it was fine for us to have a coffee and dessert. We spent all of 20 minutes, and tipped him 100% of our bill (which wasn't much, admittedly).  Now, had Cafe Orchid told us they had no open tables I would have been completely understanding. But to have gone out of our way to go there for their dessert and coffee and told that they wouldn't serve us was really irksome.

To start, we had the zucchini pancakes. They were OK, but I wouldn't order them again with so many appetizers to try. For dinner, I had the chicken shish, my husband had the sultan special. Both were excellent. My chicken was juicy, tender, and had the most amazing spices on it. Add some rice and a little side salad and I was set.

I used to be a waitress so I know there are just those days where you either just don't feel like being at work that day or personal stuff gets carried over into your work, so I get it!

In short, the only time we actually seen our waitress is when she was dishing out attitude and giving us blank stares as if she didn't understand English or though the glass in the back of the house talking amongst her co-workers. Pretty sure she was talking about us to, since there were looks at our table from her co-workers. A good hint to remember when serving, don't talk about your customers when they can see you...just saying! The busser ended up, in our eyes, becoming our server. I wish I would have got her name to give her the proper credit deserved. She checked on us constantly and got us anything we asked for (which was not a lot). Unfortunately for the waitress, the busser got our tip (65.00) in cash personally handed to her and the waitress received nothing.

We had a party of 3, with a reservation and even though the place was pretty empty the staff seemed to be extremely confused about the concept of ""reservation"". We were eventually sat at a table meant for 2, but a chair was added so that I could sit down. This is normally fine, but my chair was right in the middle of the walking path from the kitchen the back dining area.  Seating aside we sat down to order. I'm a big fan of gyro meat, so the gyro meat plate sounded delicious with it's turkish spices and all. I think the other people in our party got Chicken Kabobs and Lamb Kabobs, which would have normally been my choice, but the gyro meat sounded delicious. The other 2 ordered without any issues, but when it came time for me to order it's as if the waitress all of a sudden didn't speak english. The gyro plate came with a side, so I asked for rice, which is clearly labeled as a side on the menu, but she looked extremely confused. She questioned my choice of rice and I repeated myself, not a big deal, but then she asked me if I wanted the butter sauce... Ok, this is odd I thought. There was no mention of any sauce on the menu next to that item, so I wasn't sure what she was asking. When I questioned it she really had no clue, so I said sure... butter sauce sounds delicious anyways. I thought it would just be a light coating of butter on the rice.... wow was I wrong.  Our food came and the kabobs w/ rice looked amazing so I couldn't wait to try my gyro meat with rice and buttery sauce, but that excitement was soon smashed into pieces. It was as if a mirror shattered in my head as the plate was set in front of me. The gyro meat itself looked amazing and I imagine the rice would have too, if there were any on my plate, but I couldn't tell because half of my plate was covered with a thick, creamy looking white sauce. Cream and I don't get along so I couldn't really eat it, and since it was touching some of the gyro meat it inherently killed any chance of eating all the gyro meat. And of course, there was no rice.  I didn't want to complain because I knew this was the butter sauce that I had ""ordered"", so it wasn't a mistake on their part. And if I had asked about the rice they either would have said I asked for butter sauce or just have brought it on a separate plate. I just decided to eat around the sauce and get as much meat into my face hole as I could, but that doesn't mean I can't still be bitter about it. The meat itself was delicious and I would go back again, but I will absolutely remember not to order the butter sauce again.",0.9878,0.801,0.126,0.073,0.5085908476865922

Upon entering we were asked if we had a reservation.  We did not, and were told to wait.  Fortunately we got what I think was the last unreserved table in the restaurant (subsequent diners who came in without reservations were told to return in 30-45 minutes).  We started with the babaganoush, which was fantastic.  It was wonderfully garlicky (lots of times restaurants use way too light  a hand with the garlic).  For mains I got the uskudar (lamb cubes sauteed with veggies) and my friends got the vegetable stew and the vegetable combination.  My uskudar was okay, but way, way too salty (and I LOVE salt, if I think something's too salty it's actually inedible for most of the population).  One of my friends reported the stew was excellent but the friend with the vegetable combination plate said it was just average. Up to this point I probably would have given Cafe Orchid 3 stars, but from here things got weird.  The servers had been sort of stand offish up to this point - we'd even joked that our waiter clearly hated us - but we were willing to overlook it.  We still had about a half bottle of wine left and were enjoying sitting and chatting.  At this time it was 9:15 - 45 minutes before the restaurant closed.  There were empty tables, other diners had just received their entrees, and there was no one waiting.  It became very clear the restaurant staff wanted us to leave.  They ceased refilling our water and didn't ask us if we wanted dessert or coffee.  We actually felt so much hostility that we decided to order dessert to ""justify"" our continued lingering.  We had to flag a member of the wait staff down to ask for a dessert menu.  We ordered dessert (we still weren't offered coffee and our water glasses were never again refilled).  I will say the rice pudding I ordered was delicious. When the time came to pay the bill we asked to split it between three credit cards.  Look, I know this is annoying.  Either do it or just say you can't.  What you should NOT do is literally roll your eyes at us as our waiter did.  He took our checks and credit cards, ran them, and returned to the table where he literally threw the receipt down without a word.  No ""thank you for coming."" No ""have a good night."" If you're going to have a BYOB restaurant, you have to expect people will linger.  My friends and I try really hard not to be obnoxious diners.  We weren't the last ones left in the restaurant by a long shot and we ordered appetizers, mains, and dessert.  The hostile attitudes we received from the waitstaff were unjustified and made us extremely uncomfortable.  No matter how good the food may (or may not) be, I'm never returning to this restaurant.",0.9966,0.781,0.16,0.06,0.5043019943019943

My women fighting days are long behind me -- especially after that ass-whopping I received in 2008. Incredible friends (old and new). Great food. And a Turkish drink I'm still not sold on -- it's BYOB, we brought bourbon and Raki. That pretty much encompasses my dining experience at this Lakeview gem. The next time -- or perhaps the first and only time -- you're invited out for an evening of Raki and fish, you best jump at the opportunity.  My friend and his wife brought me here, claiming it was ""the best Turkish food in all of Chicago."" I'll go a step further, and put it as one of the best restaurants in Chicago. Fun, fresh and a great place to socialize with your crew. The Turkish pizza was a sensational appetizer -- bread topped with lamb and assorted vegetables. I crammed three slices into my mouth and followed it with a few sips of Raki. Is this heaven? The shepherd's salad was light, crisp and refreshing. I also like that you can use your hands to pile it onto your plate, and no one will judge.  The main course was fish, a Chilean sea bass -- head and eyes still intact, which might be off-putting to some, but not me. I like to stare my meal in the face, show it who's boss as I delicately cut into its flesh and subtly laugh. If that's not your cup of tea, or if you aren't that sadistic, I suggest ordering one of the lamb dishes. I don't remember the names of the lamb dishes I sampled, but they were both delicious. One comes with pita bread and veggies -- like a Turkish gyro. The other is served in a spicy red sauce.  We ended the evening with a nightcap, drinking Raki -- I opted for the bourbon -- with the owner and our new friends at the adjacent table.  Cafe Orchid and Raki definitely helps bring people together.",0.9927,0.819,0.152,0.029,0.5046022727272726

It was pleasant in spite of the westerly sun and the din from Addison, Lincoln, and the Ravenswood trains. Staff members were polite, though a little aloof, and there seemed to be a small language barrier at one point. The menu has many tempting Turkish choices for both omnivores and herbivores. We started with fried feta wraps -- they were tasty & crispy, not greasy at all. Entrées are served with a salad and a choice of rice or bulgur. I tried doner kebab -- it had wonderful flavor, and the salad and bulgur were both much better than I had expected. My companion's lamb ""skewers kebab"" was quite good, as well -- everything was flavorful and cooked just right. I attempted to order an especially appealing dessert from the menu (I cannot remember the name), but got rice pudding instead. When I inquired, I was told that the dessert I wanted is seasonal not available right now. Apparently, the server tried to tell me this, but I did not understand what she was getting at. The rice pudding was, however, enjoyable. Prices are reasonable and it's BYO, so we had an affordable good time. There's also limited parking in an adjacent free lot.

I have driven by this place for many a year until one day I noticed it and thought ehhh.. then I read a review saying it was BYOB looked at the menu and went hmmmm. If you have been driving by with out a glace take a peek at the corner of Lincoln and Addison and you will find a great meal at a reasonable price. What is Turkish food its feta its stuffed grape leaves its lamb its yogurt sauce its good. Let me tell you what we had we started with the feta plate a nice selection of fresh crisp cucumbers tomatoes olives and feta it was light and fresh perfect for a summer night. And if it is a nice summer night eat out side they have a covered patio so if it does rain it will just add atmosphere. Next we had the stuffed grape leaves that come on a bed of lettuce with a great dressing on it. The grape leaves where so good we used restraint so we could bring 2 home and eat them later they where creamy and flavorful a real treat not a hard dense  glop of rice like so many are also served cold and yummy. For entrees we had the lamb shish kebabs with bulgar wheat juice moist meat and a nice serving size the wheat was creamy and delicious  very good if you crave lamb this is the place. Last we had Kiymali Pide  a thin dough like pizza they place the filling which is ground lamb mozzarella cheese and Turkish spices in the middle keeping the perimeter like a big crust then they roll the side over the filling and its kept flat like a pizza. It comes out piping hot and they cut it in slices it come with hot sauce and yogurt sauce its crispy dough not like a pizza could be a great appetizer for 2 or more people. Staff is very friendly and place is cute BYOB is perfect. Take my advice and open your eyes on the corner of Lincoln and Addison and stop in for a bite.,0.9965,0.811,0.179,0.01,0.591111111111111

2012-06-19,4.0,"After a trip to Istanbul and Izmir earlier this year, I had to try some Turkish Cuisine in Chicago.  I was excited to come too because maybe it meant I could speak some Turkish to the wait staff too. We came a little late without reservation, and for some reason I looked confused. I think I said something funny as one of the waitresses said they didn't have any tables available.  I was semi let down, but 3 seconds later she said they had one outside.  Pretty good.  The good thing was the outside reminded me partially of a place I ate at in a village near the Black Sea (i.e. Rustic). Since I had grown accustomed to drinking some amazing Elma Cay (Apple Tea) in Nargile gardens and on the street, I wanted some of that badly and hoped this place would have some great stuff.  We ordered some Mucver (Zuchini Fritters), Lentil Soup, and the Lamb Iskender (TOMATO SAUCE). First, the Mucver were larger than I expected, but still very good and piping hot.  The dill/yogurt/garlic/Feta dipping sauce could have been better, but no complaints.  The lentil soup was a standard lentil. Not amazing, but not bad by any means.  My Lamb Iskender was very, very good and actually better than the few I had tried in Turkey.  I would recommend this dish (and please, get it with Tomato Sauce).  The only let down was the tea since it was bagged tea. It was decent, but I was somehow hoping for the real deal and to be taken back to what I deemed ""The Opium Den"" in Sultanahmet.  For dessert, I had the kazandibi, which again, was very good. Funniest thing was I had ordered in Turkish to my waitress, but I thought she didn't understand what I was ordering. At the end, she did notice my ""tesekkurler"" and got excited.  I guess not many guests speak Turkish there and she wasn't used to it! Overall, what I had was very good as a whole and I will be back shortly to have more of the menu. I would recommend to anyone who likes Turkish cuisine.",0.9976,0.751,0.218,0.03,0.501400966183575
2012-06-17,4.0,"After a recent two week vaction in Turkey, we were anxious to see what a Turkish restaurant at home would be like.  We especially wanted to have kunefe for dessert, because we never were able to find it during our travels.   We started with an appetizer of fried mussels.  Mussels are a big item in Turkey, but we were warned that it was easy to get sick from them while we were there, and we weren't in an Anthony Bourdain frame of mind during our trip.  We never saw any fried mussels while there.  Very solid appetizer.  The other appetizer we got was the spinach pie, which we ate a lot of while we were there.  It was no different at Cafe Orchid. My entree was the lamb Iskender with a nice spicy butter sauce, accompanied with bulgur.  That was pretty much how I remembered this dish when I was there.  Well done, Cafe Orchid.  My wife enjoyed the Imam Firin, which is an eggplant dish.   Dessert was kunefe, which I hadn't had since Anatoli Kabob was open in Lincoln Square quite a few years ago.  I'm going to let the reader google this, because I'm not going to do the dish justice with a description here.  Suffice it to say, this is a great dessert, and our undying quest for kunefe had finally come to an end.  My wife liked the Turkish coffee, but I think my Turkish tea wasn't quite as strong here.  That stuff kept me awake for those two weeks for sure.  We had fun discussing our trip with our waiter, who hailed from Ankara.   We got to sit out on the patio, and the weather couldn't have been better.  The pace was very relaxed, and the atmosphere was inviting.  Parking was tricky, but we found plenty of spaces south of the intersection on Lincoln, though we had to pay.  It is BYOB for those who are so inclined.

I like spicy but I have had Turkish dishes where the garlic is overpowering--not here. For desert we had baklava (with pistachios) and revani (same as Greek).  Both very good.  Only (minor) complaints--they were out of 2 of the better looking deserts--the pumpkin one and the vanilla pudding (with figs & cherries).  Other small complaint--I like to try new stuff & the waitress highly recommended ayran.  It's a yogurt drink and it was very salty.  I guess if you were raised with stuff maybe.  That said, when I asked for a gazoz (think cream soda) instead, the waitress unhesitatingly made the switch.   There's not much specially for kids but I thought it was plenty kid friendly.  We ate outside--you are basically in a parking lot but the many flowers hide you from that fact quite well.   We will definitely return--good food, good service and very reasonable prices.",0.9922,0.82,0.156,0.023,0.4968722943722944

The menu is very extensive including mezes (tapas), salads, meat dishes, kebabs, vegetarian dishes while you are getting very good size portions. What i really loved about the menu is that it had a lot of ""home food"" dishes. Like the stuff my mom cooks when I am back home. Definitely, do pay attention and order the items labeled ""Recommended"" on the menu. If you have any questions ask for Mr. Kurtulus. He is the chef and owner of Cafe Orchid and best of all he is a very delightful person to speak to. He explains the dishes and help you to choose and answer the questions you may have.  Service was also amazing. I have not had a minute without the water or bread and the servers were all very nice and polite.  The prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of the food you are getting. Although it is a BYOB restaurant, I strongly suggest you try Raki (much better than your grandma's Ouzo).

Then, to finish, a dessert plate with some strawberry, a jello heart, and a nice sized piece of very moist cake. I read a couple of the 'bad reviews' and was pretty surprised.

The second time I called-I wanted the Feta Wraps and a couple falafels, since it was just me for lunch. They WOULDN'T do it. They would only sell me 5  falafels. They only have one size hummus. They don't have combination plates. So I would have ended up with food for 5 people if I ordered what I wanted for over $25. They just flat out REFUSED to give me what I wanted. If they had just charged me for 2 falafels and the feta wraps, I'd give them my money and have food in my belly, instead they lost my business forever.",-0.5993,0.902,0.04,0.058,0.5316239316239315

Indecisive but in search of some salad with a little protein on the side, I ordered the mixed kebab platter sans rice and with yogurt sauce. Although a bit pricey at nearly $20, it came with a wealth of meat (steak, chicken, gyro, and kibbe) and a giant salad with a grilled tomato and pepper dressed in a simple oil and vinegar dressing. The light salad completely hit the spot on a warm August afternoon, and the grilled tomato was the proverbial cherry on the sundae. Not to be outdone, the chicken came out grilled, juicy, and flavorful as did the gyro. My friend couldn't keep his mitts off the steak chunks, and I absolutely loved the kibbe. It ate like hamburger with a Greek accent and a healthy levity. I took enough meat home for two more meals, but I could not resist consuming all the kibbe with my salad and bread at the table. I also could not resist asking for a little more yogurt sauce to go. I wish everything in life could be as simple and delicious as Cafe Orchid's kebab platter on a sunny Summer day.",0.9894,0.829,0.164,0.007,0.5682142857142857

2011-04-17,5.0,"Café Orchid is an excellent authentic Turkish restaurant! My first visit there was about a year ago when a group of Turkish and American friends organized a fun evening at Café Orchid's patio. We were all impressed by the quality of food and the friendly service who had no problem handling a large crowd like ours (we were about 12).  Then, this year I went back with three other moms from my son's school, who had never had a taste of Turkish cuisine before. We had the most amazing lunch that included: kofte (meatballs), chicken shish kebob, rice pilaf, piyaz (white bean salad), sigara borek (rolled pastry stuffed with feta cheese), mercimek kofte (red lentil fingers), turlu (mixed veggies), Turkish flat bread, ayran (yogurt drink) and to top it all, the most delicious revani (semolina sponge cake in syrup, served with fresh strawberries and whipped cream). We were all drooling over every single dish. My friends were very impressed with the variety, the flavors and the quality of everything. The meat (both kofte and chicken shish kebob) could not be any juicier and more flavorful. All of us said we would definitely come back with our families! Finally, last Friday, Café Orchid catered a superb lunch at my son's elementary school in the North Shore. We repeated the same menu that we tasted earlier; this time for over 80 kids, teachers and parents. It was a feast to all my senses as well as to my heart! It was amazing to see how many kids came back to get their second serving! My special thanks to Kurtulus Serpin, the owner and master chef of Café Orchid, and his team for far exceeding my expectations! Café Orchid will definitely be a regular stop for my family.

The bread that came with everything we ordered was hot from the oven and replenished throughout our meal.  It was thicker than pita, crisp on the outside and soft in the middle - a true pleasure to pull apart. The baba ganoush was good, but the serving was scant for six bucks.   The Sultan's Delight was the star of our meal.  Slow-cooked lamb served with char-grilled eggplant purée and sautéed with just a hint of mozzarella cheese...it was fit for a sultan indeed.   The service was sweet as sugar, and may even have out-shined the food, in a good way. BYOB? You bet I will.  Hint: Trader Joe's is just a stone's throw up Lincoln, and I don't know a better place to get good wine for cheap. Cafe Orchid maintains a warm, quaint feeling despite its size.  You'd never believe how big it is!  From the outside it looks tiny.

2011-02-08,5.0,"Full disclosure - I have plenty of reasons to be biased for/against this place. I myself am Turkish, and my father was raised in Adana - the same town the chef here is from. Cafe Orchid's recipes are extremely similar to what I grew up with. This is definitely comfort food to me - that said, the service and quality of food here are unparalleled, and this is (for my money) the best, most authentic Turkish dining experience available in Chicago. Every time I dine here, I bring a friend or family, and whether or not they grew up with Turkish food, they agree it's a fantastic dining experience. Truth told, I (almost literally) stumbled on this place. Last summer, I went to a friend-of-a-friend's housewarming party. It had been just a bit awkward until a couple passes at the IPA kegs. After a couple hours, I had made friends with most of the people there. Then I got The Feeling, the one you get when you realize you got a lot drunker than intended, and you'd better escape before the ready supply of alcohol causes a messy faux pas. With a vague understanding of my surroundings, I decided to amble down Addison, looking to catch the Damen back to my neck of the woods. Besotted and hungry, I smelled something delicious as I approached the El lines at Wood. At first glance, Cafe Orchid was like a mirage to me. The food smelled heavenly, the outdoor seating (simple patio tables with canopies and strung lights) was a dead ringer for many of the restaurants I remembered visiting when I was a kid on vacation in Turkey, and the menu was filled with food I forgot existed. Dazed, I took a seat in the takeout area, ordering an Adana kebob and Turkish soda. The friendly and efficient waitstaff were kind enough not to pay too much attention to a visibly drunk, awed man. After a brief 15 minute wait or so, I received the food and made for the bus home. The total time to get home was about 30 minutes - and even after 30 minutes for the food to cool down (I ate it out of the take-out box, out of excitement as much as necessity) the meal was fantastic. I swore to myself that I would start bringing friends there. The BYOB policy makes it an easier sell, and my friends and I (who have tried a wide array of meals, including most kebabs, the iskender, manti, taze fasulye, and falafel special) swear by it as one of the best restaurants in the city. It's hard for me to advocate too hard for this restaurant. I would absolutely recommend this to just about anybody. There are plenty of options for adventurous diners, but if you're concerned about the exoticness of Turkish food, rest assured that they have ample kebab options with familiar foods. The BYOB makes this a cheaper dinner than the entree prices would make you think. The service is fantastic (I've spoken to the owner a couple times and he's extremely friendly). The outdoor patio is also a wonderful place for a date when it's warm out. Give this place a shot - even if it's a little out of the way, you don't get an opportunity to visit a restaurant like this often in Chicago.",0.9927,0.837,0.131,0.032,0.5469603174603175

It's in a strange spot that used to be a diner a while ago. I am happy to see the space transformed but it is a disjointed space. The old diner barely had enough room for 10 people.

We were seated right away but it took a little time to get served. On recommendation we did the cold and hot appetizer plates. For mains, we had a chicken kebob and chicken iskender. For my taste, the kebob was just as it should be: flavorful and moist. With all the other fixings and our lingering apps, we made many tasty options on pita. The iskender, on the other hand, was strange. That might be the best word for it. It was tasty in the same way experimental dishes I make at home for myself only is tasty. It was very rich, buttery, salty... And that was the bread. The chicken was made with the same care as was the kebob dish. Mixed on this one. To finish we had some turkish coffee (excellent) and attempted a flan which was the perfect amount of sweetness. Overall, this place is quite good.

Our adorable server asks if we want to sit on the patio.  While this isn't as insane as it sounds (said patio is covered with a winter-tent-thing), I was still worried it would be cold.  It's December, people.  This ended up being the best seat in the house - I could feel the sun on my face without the winter chill.  Perfect. Aforementioned Adorable Server answers many questions about the menu: What is Adana?  What comes with the falafel special?  What are feta wraps? (Answers: Spicy lamb. Hummus, Baba ghanoush, and a green salad.  Turkish ""eggrolls"").  Frankly, she was so cheery and helpful she could have brought me a plate of sticks and rocks and I would have enjoyed myself. Our feta wraps came first, and they were exactly as described.  Thin ""eggrolls"" minus ""eggroll innards"" plus feta.  I had a great time mixing sauces and scraping up every little bit.  Next, the falafel special.  Boyfriend had the adana special.  Both of us were completely overwhelmed with the amount of food we'd gotten for almost no money.  Seriously, my plate (about $8) was filled to overflowing.  Yes, I ate every last bit.   Adorable Server encouraged us to come back for dinner sometime.  No worries, lady, I already have my next meal planned (the leek & olive oil special).",0.9933,0.763,0.196,0.042,0.5611772486772487

When we arrived the owner and his wife greeted us because they recognized us from when we celebrated my partners 30th birthday there.  I knew the dinner was going to be spectacular when the owners wife brought a complimentary Turkish drink to the table in the first 5 minutes. We got 2 appetizers and 3 entrees to share between the 4 of us and every aspect of the dinner was top notch.  Our reconnected friends loved it and without a doubt realized why we choose Cafe Orchid.  The food is fantastic and the service is even better.

Yup Yup Yup. The hummus was fresh and very tasty, nice and smooth. For dinner I ended up having the Appetizer sampler cause I was in the mood to try a bunch of things. My other table mates tried a wide array of menu items. Our waiter was really helpful in suggesting dishes and took lots of time with each person that ordered.

I can't wait to go back and try more food.

We figured we'd have to go early since we didn't reserve a table and the patio was about 1/4 full when we got there. They asked us if we had a reservation, and since we didn't, we agreed to sit inside.  It was about 12,000 degrees in there. My husband was sweating almost immediately. Not only that, but their boombox stereo was so loud (I'm assuming so the patio guests could hear it) that most of my conversation was ""what was that?"" ""I'm sorry, could you repeat that?"" and pointing to my ear and shrugging.  Our waitress was not very attentive. Our water glasses were not refilled and with how much we were sweating, this was somewhat of a big deal. We brought a bottle of wine, which we almost completely finished before our meal arrived because we were so hot and therefore thirsty. So we're half in the tank, starving (Because the food took a long time to come out) and dehydrated. Not comfortable at all. The nail in the coffin was the food. It just wasn't good. We had the stuffed grape leaves as an appetizer. Neither of us have ever had this dish anywhere, so maybe we just didn't like it, but I couldn't even finish one.  He had the Uskudar. I had the Sultan's Delight or Hunkar Begendi, which are both ""Highly recommended."" Both have lamb in them, and the lamb was gristly and did not have a good flavor to it. After trying to choke down a few bites of mine, my husband graciously agreed to switch dinners with me, since he can pretty much eat anything (though he was not impressed either). So we switched, and while the flavor of the Uskudar was much more appealing to me thanks to the eggplant, the lamb was still not very good. I thought it may be just because I don't eat lamb often, so maybe I don't like it in general, but I had a lamb chop later that same week at another restaurant and scarfed the thing.  So, we finally finish our meal and have to walk through the patio to leave. Half the tables are still empty and haven't been seated since we got there. It was really disappointing.  I have been here to pick up lunch before, and I really enjoyed their grilled veggie with hummus. I would think about picking this up again in the future, but I'll never go back for a sit-down meal ever again.",-0.8411,0.852,0.058,0.09,0.4837561853351326

There is a lunch menu and a dinner menu. I always get the Gyros hummus plate and it is about the best thing you would ever want to put in your mouth outside a bedroom. Be sure you ask for a side of the hot sauce as it just makes the dish. The hummus is perfect!

We each had one of the spinach salads - mine with steak - which were the perfect warm weather meal. A heaping plate full of spinach, topped with a light, lemony, olive oil dressing, buffalo mozzarella cheese, and tender, perfectly cooked, smokey grilled steak.  The bread, and the small brownie the waiter insisted Amy try also looked great, but I refrained from trying any.

The place was hopping on Saturday night. I should have made a reservation. We waited for about twenty minutes for a table. The hummus was delicious. At first, I was disappointed to see it wasn't served with pita, but quickly changed my mind when I tried the thick, slightly salty bread.  I had the Turkish ravioli, which was really good. Little pockets filled with ground lamb served in a garlic-y sauce. My friend had the gyro dinner, which looked like it could feed at least two people. Service was prompt...no complaints there. Go! Order the hummus. You won't be disappointed.",0.8894,0.763,0.159,0.079,0.6397058823529411
2010-03-27,3.0,"I visited Cafe Orchid with great expectations after reading the comments here. Although my friend has warned me that ""do not expect a lot of things"" ... First things first, they didn't serve anything (like appetizer) while waiting for the main course. Negative point! While I was checking the menu, I realized that they indicated ""Iskender"" as ""highly recommended"", and the waiter adviced me to order it made by Doner (Gyros) as the original one. I had Iskender lots of times in my life, even in the city of Bursa, where the original Iskender was made first. But, whatever I had in Cafe Orchid was not Iskender, sorry. Negative point! After that I tried Baklava, and I need to say that their baklava is pretty good. I recommend you to try it, if you have a chance go there. Positive! All Turkish restaurant (both in Turkey and USA, as well) serve traditional Turkish tea and it's complimentary. But they didn't!! Shame on you Cafe Orchid, it's written ""Authentic Turkish Cuisine"" in your outdoor signboard, where is your Turkish hospitality? The only hospitable person was the waitress and she was Asian.

I went with a party of 8 and they sat us in the covered patio.  There were multiple heaters around the patio which made it extra toasty.  Our server was a very nice although slightly but not offensively pushy guy. He told us the special of the night 3x and I felt so bad that no one ordered it.  Most of the people in my party had either the Iskador or the Uskadar.  I tried both and they were both fabulous! Both the hot and regular appetizer samples are also good.  For 8 people we shared 2 samplers and each got an entree and was more than satisfied with the amount of food given.  Both the service and the food was above my expectations for such a small, unpretentious restaurant.  The 8 of us sat and ate and drank for about 3 hours, and the staff never rushed us.  Thank you for such a great time.   I'll DEFINITELY be back!!!!!!!!",0.9938,0.688,0.259,0.053,0.5113154960981048

Service - Excellent service throughout the night. We arrived on a busy Friday night and they accommodated us best as possible without a reservation. I'd recommend a reservation on a weekend night. The place is pretty small.  2. Food - Oh my, I was delightfully surprised by all the goodness. We ordered the grape leaves, the sultan delight, the yogurt kabob and split the baklava. Everything we had was excellent and possibly the best version of the dish we have tried in ages.  3. Ambiance - very cute, warm and quaint. It has a very welcoming feel to it.  4. BYOB  Now to the funny story. Upon walking in the door we were told to wait for a moment. We did so by leaning up on this fixture until the hostess came back. While waiting we both commented on the nice little portable fireplaces they had scattered in the front. They looked nice and added some great warmth and ambiance. The front also had this wonderful aroma, almost smelled like burning firewood. The hostess came back and kindly asked to sit in a different area for a few moments. Then once they had the tabled cleared, we were picked up by a staff member and escorted to our seat. As we're walking a big cloud of feathers explodes around us. It looked like as if a bird just exploded. It turns out my wife's coat was completely burnt through at the bottom while we were leaning on the fixture in the front. We didn't notice it was actually one of those portable fireplaces.  Throughout the night the staff continually apologized and asked if we were okay. They threw some free bee's at us as well. We probably could of argued more and asked for them to pay for our meal (or coat). But honestly, we felt partially responsible for not recognizing our surroundings better.

Solo diner, greeted kinda friendly, sat quickly and then the clock slowed to the point of going backwards. The other two tables on the enclosed patio got friendly and attentive service while I sat with my menu pushed away from me, ready to order, for at least five minutes. Did I mention there were only two other tables at the time?  Anyway, one gyro sandwich please, hold the onions. A sufficient time later, my gyro arrived... only it didn't look like much of a gyro. The pita bread was very thin and huge, the stuffins were bland, chopped romaine lettuce, some diced tomatoes and the gyro meat. I'm sure there was seasoning involved somewhere, but it wasn't on my plate. The tzakziki sauce was lacking the texture or tang to help the cause (it was more like ranch dressing consistency but without the taste). Unsalted, boring fries.  Man, a letdown indeed considering my last visit was way more tasty.

2010-02-10,1.0,"I had high hopes after hearing from a couple gal pals about their amazing experience here, but I was disappointed. I'm a fairly low-maintenance diner I believe and if I have the basics (good service, good food, fair price) I am usually happy and will spread the word. But this just wasn't the case here. The fold up metal chairs in the tiny little front dining area didn't help the cause. Not sure what the second room is like, maybe that's where they have the ""cozy and comfortable inside dining area,"" they speak of on their website. I was sort of stiff from the get go.  It took too long for anyone to come over to even say hello and when they did, I wondered if we were in trouble here because of the language barrier. I feel bad for saying this, since I was the one going into a Turkish restaurant, expecting them to cater more to me, but, I just wondered how well we would fare with this communication problem.  I ordered some pretty basic items and ended up having to point to the menu to tell our server what we wanted. Even then, he brought us the wrong appetizer. I hate feeling like, 'Oh, I don't want to cause a scene and send this back' so I just eat it, even though it's not what I wanted.  Always bums me out. The bread he brought over to our table was hot and very good. The hummus, even though very oily, tasted pretty good. I couldn't get past the mushiness of the babaganush he brought instead of grilled eggplant salad which I asked for. So I'm not too sure about that. I thought falafels would be done well here, but was mistaken. Way too over fried with no flavor. I didn't get past the first bite.  There were a couple older women next to us who had ordered a meat platter that smelled wonderful. So I made sure to get what they had, the lamb, plus a few other things in the combo platter. I will say, all of the meats were very good. Grilled and well seasoned. As I was finishing dinner and beginning to contemplate something sweet and maybe a coffee, another guy- bus boy? - came over and started hurriedly taking our plates and cleaning the table while we sat there. He was acting a bit frantic and saying something about our server talking to another table when it was time to close. He kept repeating that they closed at 10:00 and said that server had better get to work because there was a lot to do still.  I didn't feel like we had time for dessert at this point and knew we had better get going. It was 10:00 on the dot afterall! So, the check comes and I'm splitting it 50/50. My half should have been about $26.  Instead, we each get charged $47- what the heck? Who is doing the math here?? I was so annoyed. And I'm STILL annoyed because it's 4 days later and this voided charge has yet to appear back in my bank account. I have called twice to tell them they charged me $26 plus the $47 and they have said both times that it will take a few days to correct.  Annoyed. Like I said, friends have told me of their wonderful experiences here. Unfortunately, I had just the opposite.

We shared a dessert that was like a mix between tiramisu and creme brulee, which are the two desserts guaranteed to make my eyes roll back in my head, and it was incredible.  There's no other word for it.  We just gaped at each other when it was over.

Food wise I wanted to taste more and I will on my future visits.   We started with the meat pie,  the filling was tasty but served on a mushy salad,  the dough was a bit greasy,  I still enjoyed it though.  My other app.  was  ""skewered mussels""  a very strange preparation.  Described as  ""skewered""  and ""pan fried""  this oxymoron made us curious enough,  what we received were 5 large green lipped mussels,  in a batter,  not unlike a fish and chips batter,  served with an  American style cocktail sauce and some lemony sauce that may have contained garlic and tahini.   At this point we were concerned about the other things we ordered,  but I have to say,  beer battered mussels are pretty damn tasty,  except for the shell that was in one. The entrees  is where this meal came together,  my date had the Eskender,  kind of a Gyro style lamb,  served over fried bread cubes with yogurt and tomato sauce,  the meat was truly amazing,  tender,  juicy,  it tasted nothing like a mass produced gyro.  This was one of my favorite meats ever.  For my meal I had a ground lamb k bob,  served with flat bread and rice,  the meat was delicious,  moist with grill marks, and perfectly seasoned. There was only one other table in the restaurant,  when they were seated they were offered a Sea Bass special,  we were not,  I believe they were training a new wait and letting me be the guinea pig,  the other guests had impeccable service,  to the point they were really annoying me.  Our wait did not take our empty plates,  didn't offer us a special,  and didn't know the menu very well.  I can see this place really struggling when they are busy. Order the meat stuff,  I over heard a regular say that is what they do best,  and from my experience I would have to agree. It is BYOB,  we had an open bottle of Syrah we dragged in,  I would not recomend a good red for this trip,  the spices will confuse your palate,  stick with a European lager or a crisp white for this meal,  good wine will get lost in translation.",0.9922,0.796,0.136,0.068,0.4737507135721422

2009-08-22,3.0,"Well last night I went to Cafe Orchid for the second time.  My first time was not the best experience, but last night was definitely a lot better.  I am a vegetarian who eats fish (pesco-veg to be more exact), but if you serve me a fish with fins and head, I have a VERY hard time eating it because. . . . .  .well it's like looking at me and is like, ""Why are you doing this to me?!?!?!""  Anywho, when I went the first time I ordered this bass dish that is a regular on the menu. It was basically baked (I believe) and had mozz melted all over it and I am a KEEN LOVER of the cheese.  Anywho, as it is usually served with bass, they usually give you the entire thing, so I SPECIFICALLY asked the waitress ""Wil this be served whole?!""  She said no.  One of the things that is cool, but also results in sometimes. . . . . .miscommunication, most of the wait staff are foreign.  Well needless to say my fish came with head and fins and I just stared.  VERY luckily, my very nice friend took it apart for me and hid the parts behind his little lettuce portion.  I had some issues eating it still, but luckily I had consumed enough wine that I was able to choke it down =) So last night the very nice man that I am seeing suggested this as the place to go.  I'm always willing to give places a second go -- I did with Ethiopian the other night and that wound up fantastic.  Everything deserves a second chance.  So I willingly said yes.  We brought, well he brough white wine and went. It was rainy but since the summer seems to be dwindling here in Chicago and I hadn't the last time we were there, we ate outside and it was perfect.   I didn't realize it, but I guess Ezme is a regular Mid-Eastern app.  So we got that, but it was much spicier than I had had at Efe's. It wasn't bad, but I'm just not a real spicey kinda gal, so I actually preferred Efe's to Cafe Orchid's.  As well, I guess maybe it isn't that odd to serve bread rather than pita at a Mid-Eastern restaurant because Cafe Orchid did too. I prefer the pita, but the bread is good too.  To cool off from the Ezme we got baba ganoj, which was absoolutely delicious!  Everybody always goes with the hommus, but honestly I sorta like the baba ganoj better -- it has more flavor I suppose. So for the entree I was going to go with this eggplant dish because I was a little weary about ordering a fish dish again; however, the waitress was really pushing this sea bass special on me.  It's grilled and cooked with dill.  She said it could be de-boned, which I also secretly was like, ""Uh. . . . . yeah, that's what they said last time.""  So I took the risk and ordered it!  It was absolutely fabulous.  There were still some little bones it in, but it was phenomenal.  It came with the white rice that I believe is cooked with coconut and a salad.  The man I was with =) had gotten this yogurt sauce with his lamb chops and I was using that to dip as well and it was just absolutely delicious. As always I had to get dessert.  She recommended this like flan/custard, chocolate/cinnamon topped thing, and it was delicious.  I split it with my man friend =) and I probably coulda eaten one all by myself as it was delicious.  I'm a lover of the chocolate, but this still managed to the trick; however, i was also at the end of 2 bottles of wine.  Oh yes, it's also BYOB which is always fabulous. Totally recommend Cafe Orchid.  It's sorta out there, but luckily it's just off the brown line Addison stop, so if you can take public transit, you're good to go, otherwise cab is fabulous!  Falafel!",0.9995,0.704,0.252,0.043,0.5115777370777371

I am originally from Turkey and tried all the Turkish restaurants in the city and finally found happiness in this cute little restaurant. I met the chef and the owner thanks to my yet unforgotten Turkish and i should say he is amazingly friendly apart from being a great chef, same for the waiters and waitresses! I was skeptical about the success of this place in Chicago since it is a little more traditional compared to Turquoise, for example, which has a more diverse menu and better furniture! I was happy to be wrong though as it is packed whenever I go there these days, so reservation is a must starting from Thursday!

I dont understand why someone would go to a Turkish restaurant to order sword fish! So here are my picks: - sardines stuffed in grape leaves (ask your server not to overcook it so that the smoke does not kill the sardine flavor) - liver - all eggplant dishes (at any Turkish  restaurant) - lentil soup - grilled sea bass (if you are not grossed out by the head that comes with the fish, it is as good as the ones that are freshly caught from the Bosphorus! can be overcooked sometimes so warn you server) - lamb kebab - adana kebab (ask for bulgur rice) - spinach with yougurt  If you like Turkish food, this is really the place to try!

2009-08-06,2.0,"2.5 Stars. I really, really wanted to like this place since it is a BYOB with reasonable prices and a nice covered patio. We went there on a spontaneous dinner date... not having any cravings for any type of food in particular or any idea on where to go. Drove by Cafe Orchid, and made a quick decision! Unfortunately, since it was so spontaneous we did not have any alcohol with us. Maybe that would have made the experience better.  We got to sit in the outdoor patio, which was covered but still had the outdoor breeze coming in. I did notice that the patio furniture was a little mismatched, having metal chairs with cushions on some tables and plain folding chairs on others. Odd, but not a huge deal. I also did notice that my water cup, which was turned upside down when I sat down, was all dusty on the bottom. Not sanitary, but not enough so to drive me away.  Now let's get to the food. Appetizer: Falafel. I hate to compare, but I rarely ever eat Falafels except from Sultan's Market. And, man... is Sultan's Market's falafel way better! Cafe Orchid's falafel was way too fried, which made it hard and it was also kind of flavorless. Granted, the hummus that we dipped it in was good... but I felt like it could have had a little salt or garlic or something. For my entree, I got the beef kabob. It was a skewer of beef over rice with a salad on the side. The portion was perfect! I almost finished the whole thing... although I probably shouldn't have. The beef was flavorful and tasty, but I had to compare it to my favorite kabob place: Noon O'Kabob. Cafe Orchid is more of a turkish feel so had different seasonings (maybe paprika?) but overall the Noon O'Kabob's beef was SO much more tender and flavorful. I would rather spend a little more and drive a little further to go there.  Now, onto the service. It sucked. We felt like we were waiting forever for our food. BOTH the appetizer AND the entrees. We were kind of in a rush and wanted to go in-and-out but we ended up being there for probably 1.5 hours. We even asked for the check and the waiter nodded, but then proceeded to serve another table and then wait on another table first. We then asked someone else to get the check and THEN our waiter brought it over. I am not that picky about service but when it is bad, I don't like it.  This experience was really a mediocre one. I do not need to go back when there are other restaurants with a similar style of food but with better quality and service. Too bad it is a BYOB.

Everything I have ever ordered has been plain ol' yummy. But the standout dishes- must-have recommendations- are their dresserts. The kazandibi- (which is somewhere between flan and creme brulee) is to die for and I have never in my life had baklava this they make it here. It's crazy good.  The service is a bit lacking and not very attentive. It's a BYOB, so we brought a bottle of wine and a big bottle of beer to split. The server opened the bottle of beer instead of putting it on ice like we asked, which is not a big deal but sort of annoying when it was warm and open, sitting in front of us.

2009-06-12,4.0,"This was the latest pick for my dinner club. Its on a corner that you pass by but never realize there is a restaurant there. Such a great find though. We were seated in the covered outdoor area. It was a gorgeous night so it was perfect to be seated outside. Its a busy corner traffic wise so I was worried it might be noisy but it wasn't at all. In fact there was just the right amount of noise, not to quiet where you felt like the table next to you was in on your conversation, but not to loud that it was distracting.  We started out with the stuffed grape leaves, hummus, and falafel as appetizers. As many others have said, the stuffed grape leaves were amazing. The hummus was so-so, kind of bland to be honest. And the falafel was pretty good as well, not as good as a couple of other places I've been, but definitely worthy of getting again. I had the sea bass special and was a little disappointed. I thought it could have used a little more seasoning. And to be honest I don't love when fish is served whole and I have to  eat it with the head staring at me and pick out the bones. That's just me though, not a knock on the restaurant. The bulgar was really good though, I ate a huge helping. I would have probably been happy just getting the grape leaves and a bulgar!! Two of my dinner companions loved their meals, one was chicken and the other beef. I wish I could remember exactly what htey were but they both said they were fantastic. And the fourth in our group got the turkish ravioli. She said it was good but she ordered it in the butter sauce instead of tomato sauce and said it was just too rich.

She was very apologetic, so I thought, OK, that was a fluke, and our server will actually come serve. Wrong! Another 15 minutes went by as we looked at our menus of delicious sounding Turkish food. Again, I had to go up to the hostess and ask for someone to come to our table. Really? It wasn't THAT cold out there, and other tables were getting service. So it looked. Finally someone came over, took our order, and we received our appetizer, and entrees all at the same time. LOL! I was just happy to get something at that point. Couple things redeeming. The food was excellent. Ordered the appetizer sampler and the chicken kabobs. Amazing fresh ingredients, and the bread was warm and amazing. The baklava was very good also, but I have had better.

I usually think that. And yet...this place really should have 2.5 stars. I've decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. The food was good, if a little oily. The tea was delicious and the baklava was amazing; flaky, honeyed, crunchy bits of pistachios... By far, the most distracting thing about this place is the service. It is S  L  O  W. Oh, my God, it's slow. I'm between acknowledging its slowness as a cultural thing or just bad service, but generally if you're getting bad service, you at least have the sense that the servers know they're slow and just don't care, or they know and they're apologetic; none such vibe here. This is apparently how it's ""supposed"" to be done at this place. We were promptly sat directly inside the door (cold). Fifteen minutes went by before the server came to take our order. The food came out in good time, but we had to ask for our drinks (iced tea and hot tea, respectively) after the food came, and the guy acted all weird, like that was so out of the ordinary to have our drinks WITH our meal. After our plates were cleared, we sat another 15 minutes before our server came out and we asked for the check, which took another 10 minutes to bring out.  So, if I were living in the area, I would most likely get take-out over dining in. I won't be hurrying back here, but my dining companion said his previous experience there was good and he works closeby, so he probably will.  *shrug*",0.7623,0.872,0.078,0.051,0.5255050505050506

I'd recommend reservations on weekends. We started with a few appetizers and also had some honeydew and feta cheese which seems like a strange combination but was oddly addicting. The orchid special appetizer - sardine-stuffed grape leaves - was great. I had a beef ka bob which I liked.  My friend had this huge fish - sea bass - that was actually delicious even though it came with the head still attached.

Usually Mr. Man is not very excited about my constant need to try EVERY place within the Chicago city limits. However, since he got on his kefta kick, he has been more than willing to try any Middle Eastern or Mediterranean place I suggest!  When I arrived to pick up my order, the restaurant was PACKED! I was very surprised to see how popular this place is! I'd be sure to make a reservation if I ever come back to eat in.  We ordered the hummus as an appetizer. It was a very generous portion, and came with pitas. It was very good - nice and smooth - but not my favorite hummus in the city.  Mr. Man of course had a kefta sandwich, which he said was good, but he likes the one from Salaam better. I ordered a falafel sandwich (my barometer for Middle Eastern food) and it was OK. The falafels were a bit salty. I wanted the yogurt sauce to be awesome, but I thought it was very watery and bland. In addition to the yogurt sauce, we also got hot sauce, which was definitely SPICY! The sandwiches also came with a side of fries, which were totally unremarkable. I ordered the sandwiches with pita, but next time I would like to try the lavosh.  I was so completely RAVENOUS by the time I got home with the food, I totally forgot to take food pics! Sorry!  I actually tried to call for delivery once a few months ago, but I think it may have been too close to closing time, because they said they couldn't do it. So if you don't feel like leaving the house, make sure to double-check that they are still delivering before getting your heart set on some Turkish food!

Icli kofte was hard on the shell and it was ""ok"" inside. Fried mussels were also ok. However Iskender was unacceptable. It came with some kind of tomato puree on top that looks like a pasta sauce. The meat was cut pretty thick and some were burnt and blended with lots of cumin that was too strong. The pita underneath was seared in a pan and they were pretty hard. None of us were able to finish our kebaps. When we mentioned that we were not satisfied, the owner came out to speak with us.

It came fairly quickly and everything was correct in the order. They didn't include any utensils or napkins, which was fine since we were at my place, but could be a problem if you ordered for lunch. The hummus was okay, nothing spectacular but good; it came with some cucumber and tomato slices tucked along the sides. My Uskadar was really good, although watery, probably from condensation during delivery. The lamb was cooked really perfectly; tender and flavorful. The Manti was... not exactly what we were expecting. The ""ravioli"" themselves looked more like gnocchi or pelmeni, little dumplings... when you fished them out of the TONS of sauce they were covered in. The garlic yogurt tasted a lot like sour cream. It was interesting... not necessarily in a good way, but definitely unique. I have tried the manti at Cousins and don't remember it being anything like that.

This is now one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.  The menu has a lot of items that you will commonly see at generic ""Middle Eastern"" spots (hummus, falafel, kebobs)  but with a fresh and distinctive flavor. Those who love eggplant will be in *heaven* with the marinated eggplant salad (my favorite dish on the menu)  and moussaka which in Turkey is served as a sauteed melange of eggplant and tomato, unlike the layered and baked Greek version.  Those who don't usually dig on aubergines may seriously reconsider when at Cafe Orchid. When I go I generally split multiple appetizers and sometimes an entree, along with the sliced loaves of breads that are brought to the table, warm and with a saltiness that hits the spot . So for me it ends up being a small plates experience, without the pretension.  The lentil soup is pureed to a velvety consistency, sans rice, and has a distinctive herbal accent (marjoram...still trying to figure that out?). The Ezme, a combination of roasted peppers, onion, tomatoes, garlic, parsley and walnut, challenges the concept of salad as glorified lettuce. Be warned this is some spicy stuff, so I recommend mixing it with some Jajik, plain yogurt with dill and cucumber. I mostly stick vegetarian here but have tried the sardines wrapped in grape leaves which were delicious (and rare to find fresh) and a few bites of a lamb dish--not sure which one, which was well prepared but a little fatty for me.

When I got home, I sampled all of the side items before eating my entree, doner kebob.  Based on the sides - a small salad, seasoned rice, and bread - I didn't understand why Cafe Orchid has received raves from so many sources (Yelp, the Reader, Time Out Chicago).  Each was decent - the salad fresh (albeit simple) and flavorful - but I found the bread average and no sides outstanding. Then I tried the doner kebob, and my world changed.  This doner (lamb shavings that Cafe Orchid describes aptly as the turkish version of gyros) had it all: The garlic and seasonings exploded in my mouth, the meat was crispy on the edges and tender in the middle.  I love gyros, yet I can't recall ever having enjoyed gyros this much.  I didn't tire of them as I kept eating; in fact, although their entree included a tremendous amount of food, I nearly ate it all right there, against my better judgment.  Each bite was as good as the last. I did save a little bit of the doner for the next night, and it didn't lose a thing in refrigeration: It rated among the best leftover dishes I've had this year. Overall, I'd want to try more dishes at Cafe Orchid to give a more thorough review, but my experience with the doner will keep me coming back.  Also, I thought when ordering that the price was high for a corner kebob place, but considering how much food they gave me (and how fantastic the doner was), I think the price (about $13 for the dinner entree portion) is reasonable.",0.9927,0.837,0.149,0.014,0.4545545314900153

Feasting was on its way.  We started off with hummus, taboule and falafel. A nice way to start a summer lunch, light on the stomach and for sure tasty. We then actually all got kabobs, the girls went with lamb, I went for the chicken and again we all chose the side of bulgar. A huge portion? No, but certainly filling especially with all the appetizers we got. The chicken is tasty, definitely grilled, the bulgar was seasoned just right and the salad was cool and had a peppery vinaigrette. What wasn't cool was their hot sauce, a little too much and you might regret it. All in all, a great outdoor lunch at a very family run and owned restaurant for not very much money.

I hope they do a brisk takeout business, and judging from the other reviews here, that is probably the case. While the atmosphere is not much to write home about, the food and service were fantastic. The staff was very friendly (got to know them by name with no other customers there.) We had several appetizers. The dolmas or stuffed grape leaves were the best I have ever had. The sauteed spinach with the white sauce was delicious and offered a nice complexity of flavors and textures. The ""skewered"" mussels were kind of a surprise, since I associate skewered with kebabs. These mussels arrived deep-fried on a salad plate with a nicely spicy hummous-type dipping sauce. There was a generous amount, unlike the dolmas. Doug and I both would have preferred that the plate of fried mussels, which were really good, had maybe four pieces, and the dolma plate had eight. It was the opposite. The Turkish bread which accompanied everything was nicely chewy and fresh.  We also opted for a plate of doner meat (gyros) on a bed of hummous.  That did the trick in filling us up. The staff treated us to aromatic and piping hot little glasses of Turkish tea after our meal. A nice gracious touch, I thought.
