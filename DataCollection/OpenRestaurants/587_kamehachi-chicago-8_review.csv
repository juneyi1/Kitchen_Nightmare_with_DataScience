A few years ago when they moved up the street, the food remained the same but the restaurant design became more upscale, trendy and exclusive. (See my pictures) They have a fancy bar. They have Asian antiques. They have live music. And, oh yeah, it became more expensive as well.  So, the food is good but not nearly as good as the decor. It's probably a good place to impress a date if they are not foodies. At Kamehachi prices, the sushi should be top notch.  Instead, it's just solid and simple.

However, yesterday was probably the worst service we have ever received anywhere. I knew what I wanted when the waitress came to take our order. My husband hesitated briefly and in those moments, the waitress displayed impatience. My food was brought out and we were told my husband's would be out in a moment.

The atmosphere was very hip and modern, and I loved the ambience. We just looked a little lost entering the restaurant because there was no host around, which was a little odd. The bartender and our server welcomed us in very nicely! Since it was dead, they let us picked a random table and we were attended to very quickly. We ordered the spicy edamame, nabeyaki udon, chirashi, and the spicy scallop deluxe (weird to call it that lol, deluxe). I also ordered a tequila sour, but received an amaretto sour - definitely because our server lacked some knowledge and it sounded unfamiliar to her. I overheard her asking the bartender for an amaretto sour - next time double check because not everyone will be as forgiving as me lol. The spicy edamame was really good! Very flavorful and probably my favorite dish of the night. I like that it wasn't just a spicy salt that is usually used for spicy edamame. Be aware that it can get messy and all over your figures. The nabeyaki udon was a bit smaller than I was expected. I didn't personally eat it but my friend said it was decent, maybe a little bland. I noticed that it didn't really come with much. I had the chirashi. Compared to all the ones I have had before, this is probably the smallest portion ever. But, the fish was really good and I liked that they were not skimpy on the types of fish used. I think it was maguro, sake, hamachi, saba, and tako on there. The rice was sprinkled with oshinko and something I can't remember but it was good. Spicy scallop was okay. Overall, if I lived in Chicago, I would definitely come back to reassure myself that I like it haha. Food: 3.75, I'm not sure how I feel about portions and price that you pay for it.

The second floor is probably more quiet for those that don't like too much noise while they are having dinner. But this is just what i felt when I first stepped it.

Positives were the atmostphere - really lovely new location and a front section that opens to the sidewalk - and presentation. All the plates were beautiful. For the prices, I'd rather go elsewhere for good Japanese. The service was just okay. We wandered around the front of the restaurant for almost 5 minutes before someone approached us and told us it was fine to sit at one of the front tables. It was almost another 10 before the waitress came to even take drink orders. Service was intermittent throughout; however, the server did quickly change out my cold sake when I said I didn't care for her original recommendation.  For appetizers we had beef asparagus rolls and chicken yakitori. The beef rolls were bland with too much sauce. The chicken yakitori was probably the best dish of the evening - great flavor and the cuts of chicken were good. The veggies on the skewers seemed fresh.  My boyfrind had the gyoza. He said they were as good as he could get at a Japanese grocery store. For dinner, I ordered the spicy salmon deluxe, the tasmanian salmon and a sushi toro trio special - over $40 in sushi. Literally every piece of fish I put in my mouth was sinewy and I had to pick the parts that I couldn't chew out of my mouth and leave them on my plate. This almost never happens with fresh salmon. I didn't find the quality of the fish great and the spicy salmon deluxe was bland. My boyfriend had the ton katsu - he said the panko crumbs were just like heavy breading...not light and crispy the way they are supposed to be, and the cutlet itself was not pounded thin enough.  Even though the presentation looked nice, we decided that overall, the ingredients did not seem particularly fresh - from my fish to the cabbage on the side of the his plate.

Second, after I got my food, she never once came back to ask me anything, I even had to flag her down and ask for more water.  Third, I ordered the spicy tuna roll and the sunset roll.

Not worth it - spicy salmon deluxe was tasty - the 1st one on the specialty rolls were was pretty good. Not sure if it was worth the price - summer roll - best roll of the night.

2014-11-29,5.0,"i have read a few reviews on this restaurant (and other japanese restaurants in chicago). it's so aggravating that most people in chicago think japanese food is dragon rolls and such. my goodness, people, japanese food is so widely diverse, and sushi is no different. i finally decided on this one for a special 20th anniversary dinner. i talked that afternoon with the head sushi chef about what he did and what he could offer. when he heard my list of interests with sushi, he mentioned that he could do those things. i was still a little wary because of the kind sushi crowd that populates chicago. to be completely honest, if i were alone, when we got to the address, i would have just walked by and looked for a steak house. the front is a sports bar, for goodness sakes. ugh. *not* the impression i had from people that had recommended it. but with my wife in hand, i braved it out. it was my good fortune. we walked past the sports part of the pub and sat back at the sushi bar. the chef came over and we talked a bit about what he would be doing for omakase (google it). i started having hope. we started with a sashimi platter. it was decent and the fish was tasty, but i was not overly excited about the sashimi 'shooters'. tried two anyways, just for kicks. it was ok. i thought the platter was trying to be too 'cute' or trendy.  but then he started the sushi portion of the meal, and i have to say it ranks as probably one of the top 5 sushi dinners i have ever had. simply outstanding fish, preparation and variety. they even had a few types of fish i had never had as sushi before. most notably, mahi mahi. awesome fish. turns out, after my call, he got his whole staff working on various different types of sushi that i had mentioned. one of them is 'dzuke' which has many varieties, some of which actually requires a few days to prepare, but the shorter varieties are also quite nice. the konbu was stellar. every one of the prep people were taking a special interest in our meal, indicating what they had worked on. i think the experience was enhanced by the fact that these people were normally used to preparing rolls for the normal customer, that they were excited to have the opportunity to do what they had been trained to do. and serving people with a wider taste in sushi. we thoroughly enjoyed our time there and would go back again any time. the bill was $300, but considering what we had just experienced, was in keeping with the quality and variety. this is a definite go-to place for us. next time we're in town, we'll be back at the sushi bar.",0.9954,0.841,0.135,0.024,0.4866567460317461

We moved to a 4-top to have more room, and our server informed us that table was not in her section, so we moved further back (away from the fresh air we were trying to enjoy).  We proceeded to watch a group pull the 2-top and 4-top at the very front together, and suddenly, it was now in our server's section. Amazing! Go figure. We received our maki rolls and were told our Nigiri would be out shortly... except that we ordered sashimi, NOT Nigiri. Our server seemed confused and convinced that we ordered Nigiri. Clearly she was not paying attention when taking our order. We ran out of soy sauce before our sashimi arrived and requested more. Our server pretended to hear us and acknowledged our request, but no soy sauce was delivered, even after our sashimi arrived. We waited until we could wait no more, and we were finally able to flag down another server/runner to get more soy sauce. We finished our wine well before the end of the meal, but our server never checked on our table or asked if we'd like another drink. ***You're losing money due to Hyona, Kamehachi.*** We did have another drink, we just left to get it elsewhere.

Given this, why not opt for less fashionable, as-good or almost-as-good sushi, at lower prices in a more pleasant setting? For the size of the tab here they really should treat you better: although they were perhaps only two-thirds full on a Friday night, we were seated upstairs, where the claustrophobic space was dominated by a large, drunk party who were so loud and obnoxious that we could barely focus on the menu, much less have a conversation. The table next to ours actually asked to be reseated downstairs, but this seemed to fluster the staff so badly that we opted to stay put. Servers were friendly but seemed harried and overextended. I can corroborate other reviewers on the glacially slow service (we thought it was just that we'd been stuck upstairs and forgotten about, but this seems to be the norm here). I usually don't complain about things like service and atmosphere, as for me the food is the point. But at these prices, at the very least the environment should not detract from the meal.

2014-01-18,3.0,"This place is fine. It's okay. Nothing to write home about. Being that it's 2014 and good food in the city of Chicago has EXPLODED in taste and atmosphere to nationally recognized levels, Kamehachi has lagged behind.  Unless this restaurant wants to only attract patrons (from the suburbs) on their way to Second City, don't change. If they'd like to appeal to the Chicago masses who have hundreds of different options within a 5 miles radius, step it up. There are much better sushi restaurants to spend your hard earned money on in neighborhoods to the west side and north side. Since I can't give half stars, I've rounded up to three stars. The restaurant is large and each floor has a different feel. If you want to feel like you are part of the restaurant, then the downstairs is great. There seems to be hustle and bustle of patrons, the bar and feel of a a lively fun dining experience. If you feel like you should be banished to the attic like the forgotten relative who moved away and only in town for the holidays or did not have a reservation at 6:45pm (at a mostly empty restaurant), then enjoy your table upstairs as much as possible. It's vast, cavernous, and spacious with early 2000s decor complete with plastic flowers and plants along with a poor selection of  smooth jazz saxophone muzak to complete your Saturday evening. The food is ""safe"".  Their big plate entrees have been Americanized on your plate to consist of the three traditional categories you find on any midwestern dinner plate: meat (fish), vegetables (asparagus/broccoli/carrots) and starch (rice). Specialty seasonal fish (priced at $6-9 a piece) with elaborate descriptions could've been bigger portioned or presented in a different manner than put in corner of the more elaborate looking regular maki sushi roll that is of equivalent pricing.

The bar is located upon entrance and plentiful tables extend all the way to the back with plenty of intimate room for each table. Had the uni and oyster shooter to start along with the mushroom tobanyaki. The mushrooms were delicious and featured a variety of mushrooms (about 3). They were very tasty without being too salty. The uni shooter was overly acidic while the oyster shooter tasted much better. While I'm glad I tried these, I will not be having them again as the uni and oyster got stuck at the bottom of the glass and was somewhat hard to digest. Also, did not think that the flavors of the shooters complemented the uni and oyster that well.  Had the crouching tuna hidden crab signature maki, which definitely was the best out of the other rolls I had...as it is signature for a reason. Also had the rainbow, summer, and sunset rolls, which were all pretty good, but not mind-blowing. I enjoyed the summer roll because of its spiciness and the sunset roll did have a nice sweetness to it that I do not often find in sushi. Overall, the rolls weren't filled with too much rice and were made very well, as they did not fall apart. Also tried my sister's yasaiya veggie roll, and it was really intriguing. It was nice to see other veggie options, instead of the usual avocado or shiitake roll. However, she did feel that her veggie rolls were made with a tad too much rice, relative to my non-veggie rolls. Service was pretty good. Our waitress was very nice. The busboys were really on their game, as my water was constantly refilled.  Definitely wouldn't mind returning.

I'm a bit of a sashimi nut so I usually go for those. Quality is average but servings are small for the price. I can get the same quality and more generous servings for cheaper if I just take a step beyond the border of Old Town to Lincoln Park. I've also tried the Bento Box for lunch. Again, it's okay. At first taste, I liked the Pork Katsu but on the second, I realized that it was lacking in crunch and flavor. The rest of the bento box consisted of sushi, edamame, and some salad. Again, it was average... not something I would crave and come back for. On the bright side, I would say that Kamehachi is great for groups. Dinner service has always been good for me but lunch service is pretty slow (considering that there are usually only 4 tables when I come in for lunch).

2013-10-11,3.0,"I haven't been to Kamehachi in a while, and the last time I went, it was the Gold Coast location.  What made me want to come back to Kamehachi was the Shrimp Yaki Soba and the maki rolls I had previously.  They had left a strong impression on me and I have been waiting to go back.  Well, the opportunity finally presented itself a few days ago.  Of course, my friends trust my opinion and were more than amenable to my suggestion. Since particular things had brought me back to Kamehachi, that's what I thought we should order. Well, I was disappointed.  The food was good, but it was not as great as I remember.  First of all, the shrimp in the Yaki Soba were those teeny tiny, generic shrimp that the hole in the wall Chinese restaurants use.  The last time I was at Kamehachi, the shrimp were large. almost prawn size, succulent and tasted of perfection.  Also, the flavor of the Yaki Soba was different.  There was something in this Yaki Soba that was just...eh.   Also, I judge sushi places by their spicy tuna.  It's a basic roll, but so easy to mess up.  If a restaurant can handle the spicy tuna, then it tells me whether or not they can execute the more complicated rolls.  When our maki platter came out, the spicy tuna were these itty, bitty rolls, the spicy tuna filling on the sparse side, and what was the offical deal breaker: it was NOT spicy.  Sigh.  Why call it spicy tuna, if you're not going to make it spicy? We also ordered the shrimp tempura maki.  It was good, but without the soy sauce, there was no real flavor. Boo! Finally, we ordered what was the sunset maki.  This was the highlight of the meal. The flavors were fresh, and balanced.  You could taste each individual ingredient but the flavors were harmonious.  This roll alone is why I am giving Kamehachi 3 stars instead of two. I'm not sure if the menus vary by location of if the items have just ""evolved"" since my last visit.  Either way, I don't think I am ever going to return to Kamehachi because this past experience burst the bubble of my first time here.  Cest la vie!",0.9716,0.844,0.112,0.045,0.402799823633157

2013-08-02,1.0,"Title: Bug In Sake!!! I'm writing this review based on the experience and professionalism received after encountering the infamous 'bug-in-food' experience rarely heard about in nice restaurants. After ordering items that added up to almost $100 (before tip), we poured the last of our hot sake to find a pest inside of the container. Although I've never worked in a sushi restaurant, it's hard to say whether this type of occurrence is avoidable, or if it's primarily up to the sake provided to ensure a bug free product... In any case, this review isn't so much about the bug-in-the-sake as it is the response received from the management during this night. After informing the acting manager of the bug, and providing a picture (posted with the review), she claimed that she would look into the matter and would check the water and thoroughly clean the plates (why the water, or cleaning the plates would matter for what's in the sake is beyond me). So we left unsatisfied with the action promised by upper management. We didn't request any items removed from our bill though common sense dictates that this should have been one of the first things promised after such an event occurs.  Less than an hour later we called to check the status of our do-gooder manager with inspecting cleaned plates and looking into the water (not the sake). She informed us that they are still looking into it. She also said she would reimburse the drinks only if we returned to the restaurant. Seeing as this didn't come up until after we left, we were a little taken back, now we have to go back to the scene of the crime if we want to be offered what should have been offered in the first place?  The only other option provided was to receive a gift card for the restaurant. Even looking over the fact that our experience would give anyone an adequate reason not to ever step foot in this establishment again, we are out-of-towners that will have as little of need for this gift card as giving Anthony Weiner advice on sexting.  Bottom-line: I won't guarantee the same experience that we received with the bug-in-sake, but I can most certainly guarantee an unprofessional manager on staff that throws ridiculous quality prevention suggestions (thoroughly checking the water..) or even more ridiculous damage control  options (gift card for out-of-towners...).

I've never been let down by any of the rolls. I really prefer to sit downstairs, especially if the weather is nice or the sun is out, because upstairs is really dark and sort of bleak. Service has always been sort of spotty; each time I've been here there is something that just doesn't come out. It won't be on the receipt either, so it just was never entered in. Then mentioning it to the waiter/waitress is a lost cause because they are nowhere to be found. This was disappointing last time because I was really up for trying some new things and my order ended up incomplete. If you are rushed at all, do not dine here.

Low and behold, it ""couldn't be found"" even though there was no one in there except for the small wait staff and two other small tables. Even after I came back and tracked the phone to the restaurant, the manager insisted that they had done everything possible noting that they'd look further when they closed at midnight and call me the following day.  Alas, no one called - or called me back - after multiple messages.  The saddest part of all is that was my husband's go-to for pricey business dinners but after our latest experience, he won't be back.

She ate the Chicken Teriyaki (with a house salad) that I had a bit of, and I had a Tuna D'Lux D'Lux roll with miso soup and spicy edamame. We didn't do anything else the entire night. The next day we woke up and both felt like we had been hit by a truck. She was violently vomiting, severely dehydrated (her brother, a physician, gave her an IV), feverish, and dizzy. If it wasn't for her being a nurse and her brother being a physician, we would have taken her to the ER. I had similar, but not as severe, side effects from the food. My guess is it was the chicken teriyaki. When I spoke with the manager, Lateef, he told me to have her brother, the doctor, call him that night and explain the symptoms. When he called 10-15 minutes later, Lateef had left. The doctor explained that this must have been food poisoning and all the symptoms that were related all led him to believe that it came from Kamehachi. I called in today and Lateef explained that he needs to obtain a stool sample before they can do anything about it (they also wouldn't contact the doctor and said he would have to contact them if anything was to be done). The service, while there, was good, decor was great, but the management and food are far below average. Will be reporting them elsewhere as well. AGAIN, BE WARNED!

I immediately entered the restaurant with my friend, and Kamehachi did not defy my expectations.  Juicy, crunchy and flavorful. Tofu dengaku (tofu skewers with miso sauce) is the best in Chicago. It has three flavors - yuzu miso, aka miso and matcha miso, which is quite rare in the States. In particular, I like the yuzu miso skewer that is quite refreshing.  I also enjoyed eating the spicy renkon (lotus root). Very few Japanese restaurants prepare renkon because it takes time to marinate it well. I applaud Kamehachi for putting it on the menu.

I don't quite get it, but based on events as of late, Kamehachi has been shuffled down much lower in my stack of take-out menus.  Let me make it very clear that the quality of the sushi is still very good, fresh, and tasty. However, in the last few weeks I've dealt with really rude delivery drivers twice, delivery times taking the FULL estimated time (~1hr+) when they used to estimate an hour and provide delivery within 35 min, and an incorrect order. All I wanted was my beloved Sunset roll, and I was given a Rainbow roll. I just sucked it up and ate it; I like Rainbow rolls just fine, but it was a huge disappointment. I ordered from Kamehachi that night specifically for a Sunset roll.  Maybe I'm being overly critical, but I'm going elsewhere for sushi delivery for a while. I hope to go dine in soon to finally get my hands on some Sunset roll goodness. The actual sushi at Kamehachi is easily 4 stars, so if you're looking for some rice + fish goodness in Old Town, I'd absolutely recommend dining in.

I've been a few times now and it seems like the crowds and madness that was present when they first opened has tempered a bit which was a welcome change.  We started our evening with some sake at the bar and then were escorted to a cozy table for two upstairs for dinner.  I like the way they staggered the placement of the tables for even though there may be someone next to you, they are not right next to you. Our server, Laura, was great, explaining the menu (very well organized and easy to find favorites) to going over the specials of the day.  And while their specialty cocktail list is nice- they also have a good selection of wines, and sakes. While I won't go through everything we had, there are a few things worth a special call out.  First, we went with the mussels steamed in sake as our first course- delicious!  And their maki rolls are always good- try the rainbow, the spicy tuna deluxe or our server's favorite, the Summer roll with Tuna, Yellowtail, Green Pepper, Avocado, Masago, Cilantro . . . . . .it tasted like Summer feels! My friend also ordered a wide array of sashimi and the presentation was lovely- almost too pretty to eat! I was a little underwhelmed by a couple of things.  First- my fatty tuna (toro) tasted fishy to me which made me question if it was as fresh as it could be.  Also- skip the chocolate cake for dessert- it is just so so and certainly not ""calorie worthy""! Dinner for two with plenty of drinks, appetizers and dessert ran about $150.  Valet parking is available out front for $12 (a life saver in the Winter months).  And they are open until 2am so it's a great place to stop in for a drink anytime.

The bento contained miso soup, side of rice, tempura combination w/ dipping sauce, california roll, some pickled sides, and the salmon. Everything was fine, except! the salmon.  The salmon was completely raw in the middle, only the outside was lightly cooked. It had a nice grill taste on the outside, but the inside was just all raw. I don't have a problem with raw fish, just salmon in a bento should be fully cooked. Since it was undercooked, it felt like I was eating mush.

That's a plus - good to know for future planning outings in the area. Parking was easy to find on the street. We sat upstairs in the loungey area. The seats were very uncomfortable and odd. But the whole atmosphere of the place was enjoyable, low-key, and intimate. Our waitress was friendly and nice. She was responding in a professional manner to my obnoxious friend that kept asking her strange questions and tried flirting with her. I was pleasantly surprised how well she handled him, while I was sitting there embarrased for him. Anyway, I ordered Vegetable Spring roll as a side dish, which came with a delicious sauce. The spring rolls were delicious, although different than I expected. It must have been the tofu that was inside that was different from spring rolls I am used to. Nevertheless, it was tasty. We also ordered California Roll, Alaskan Rolls, Futomaki roll, and Spider Roll. All were tasty and filling. I tried the rolls with the rest of the Spring roll sauce that was left over, and I must admit it tasted pretty damn good too! So yeah, try that ;) Much better than eating it with soy sauce actually. Overall the place is rated 3 stars simply because there wasn't much of a WOW factor. Although, I am willing to go back there when I'm actually hungry next time and trying one of their noodle dishes (I heard they were prettty good).

The real deal for me was when I asked for an alternative, non-soy based dipping sauce... and they provided! This is a BIG DEAL if you have soy allergies. They were super accommodating, whereas most restaurants scratch their head and say ""teriyaki"" which is basically souped-up soy. I want to say it was a sesame ginger sauce, but that may just be in my head.

For three of us, we asked for the chef's recommendations, mostly sashimi and stay away from the saucier stuff. Some of the fish that came out was excellent, but about half was gamey or flavorless, and a few pieces were inedible gristle. Conclusion: Kamehachi does not in fact find better fish than the sushi hoi polloi, and therefore should be drizzling everything with wasabi mustard and olive oil like the sushi joints that have DJ nights.

The miso soup was good, better than most Japanese restaurants I've tried here in Chicago. It wasn't grainy, and you can tell they didn't just serve us a bowl of instant miso soup.  I enjoyed the oyster shooter. It was a little too vinegar-y but the quail egg and the oyster went down smoothly.

2010-07-17,5.0,"I lived in south Florida for 10 years, and you could go to any hole-in-the-wall sushi restaurant on any corner and get solid, fresh sushi. Here in Chicago? Not so much. After searching around and trying almost every place mentioned in every magazine and food rating site/book, I finally found Kamehachi. Long story short: The sushi is very good here. It isn't cheap, but it's not absurdly expensive like some of the other allegedly ""top-notch"" sushi offerings in Chicago (eh hem, Japonais). The fish is always fresh and they have some very nice ""special"" rolls. They also have a rotating list of daily specials - usually exotic, original, interesting rolls. The summer roll is excellent and has a great kick to it, and the standard rolls are great. Of note: I keep going to sushi places in Chicago that are performing botched surgery on the standard ""spicy tuna roll"". Thankfully, Kamehachi does NOT do this. They serve it correctly. I do not know why these places think you are supposed to chiffonade the sushi, mutilate it, and integrate it with the spicy mayonnaise sauce. Places do this and it is like a bizarro tuna tartare, but done wrong. But like I said, Kamehachi does not do this. They give you a nice big chunk of fresh tuna and put a little spicy sauce in the roll. Thank you, Kamehachi! Lastly, Kamehachi is kind of like two restaurants in one. The downstairs is the more ""traditional"" looking sushi restaurant (equipped with the sushi bar and sushi chefs visible). The upstairs is a more ""Japonais""-y type lounge. It is darker, sexier, and ""cooler"". So, depending on what kind of mood you are trying to set, plan accordingly and request which room you want. In the summer months, they also have a really nice little patio in the back that is covered and has a cool little waterfall-type thing. Kamehachi is solid and unpretentious.

My sister decided to get the Dynamite starter seafood in masago in spicy mayo, it was a little odd, a mishmash of different pieces in spicy sauce, it was a little disconcerting to see a big oily mess at the bottom of the plate but I guess that's the price for baking mayo. The Martinis were a little on the small side but not too bad. One of our friends ordered a Sapporo and the can was covered in some weird crust. I ordered the sushi deluxe plate and it was okay, sampler wise but for the price I was expecting more. I also ordered two pieces of the white tuna and it was pretty good. The sushi here is good, it's just price wise I think it's a little lopsided. The service was...I don't want to say bad but we did have to flag her down more than once, she wasn't pleasant and I ordered the strawberry mochi ice cream and she brought me the mango. When I mentioned it to her she just said she would get me the strawberry without aplogizing and then came back a few minutes later saying they were out of the strawberry. Did she think that I wouldn't notice? I'm not color blind or anything, give me the option of choosing instead of making the choice for me. I don't think I'll come back, I will go for my sushi needs elsewhere.",0.9912,0.8,0.161,0.04,0.5133487654320987

We ordered 4 rolls to share: sunset, dragon, spicy tuna and rainbow. It was hard to pick a favorite but I really enjoyed the sunset roll. There were huge orange fish eggs on top. If you can get past the fish eggs, you will love this roll! The presentation is beautiful and we were very full on the four rolls we ordered.

2010-03-15,2.0,"Let's start off with the bad to explain the 2 star rating. Bad: - Dragon roll: I always get a dragon roll to evaluate how good a sushi joint is, and I'm sad to say that Kamehachi's dragon roll isn't up to snuff. The roll was so tiny I probably could have fit the whole thing in my mouth had I tried, and it was flavorless - how did they manage to make my favorite roll *ever* flavorless?! To add insult to injury, the roll cost $12.95. Disaster. - Sukiyaki (thin slices of beef simmering in broth with napa cabbage, tofu, onions, mushrooms and clear): It just didn't taste great. Tofu had no texture and tasted like it had been soaking in tap water all day. Mushrooms tasted gross. Just a mess. - Service: The waitress was a bit air-headed. I think she may have had the whole upstairs dining area to cover, though, so I forgive her, but it cannot be denied that it was a bit silly of her to serve the dinner entrees and not ensure that we had forks and knives - heck, we didn't even have chopsticks! Good:  -  Miso soup: It's hard to mess up, but I've had worse elsewhere. - Asian Lamb Chops (grilled Frend-cut lamb chops, marinated in garlic-sesame soy sauce): Chops were marinated well and perfectly grilled to medium. It wouldn't have hurt if the portion had been bigger, though. - Upstairs dining: The upstairs lounge-themed dining area is very cute, cozy and romantic. Overall, it was a disappointing experience. I don't understand the 4+ star ratings from other reviewers, though. Perhaps, it's just a sad case of people settling for mediocre food because it's close to their homes.",-0.2439,0.75,0.119,0.131,0.5802777777777777
2010-03-11,4.0,"This Peas & Carrots date brought to you by the awesome folks at Groupon. Thanks, Groupon! Now back to your regularly scheduled review.  Spring rolls. Not much to speak of generally. Maybe some decent tofu, some crispy sprouts, an herb or two... but usually, spring rolls rely on a good hoisin or eel sauce to make them come alive. The spring rolls at Kamehachi were easily some of the Best I Have Ever Had. Light, papery wrapping, abundant, delicious noodles and the best use of cilantro maybe ever in the history of sushi. The salty sauce was perfect. Perfect!  We gorged a bit, fair to say. The dragon roll and crazy Chicago rolls were great, but the sunset and summer rolls were the best. The spicy tuna roll was indeed nicely spicy but still tasty, and the salmon and tuna sushi pieces were fantastic (not too much rice).    My Tokyo-tini (ginger, cucumber, acai booze and sake) was absolutely delightful and has inspired my new summer drink. Carrot's green tea martini was flavorful and interesting.  Unfortunately, the one drawback, is that their drink prices border on extortion. For instance, a bottle of wine is usually a savings of a glass or so but not here - Four glasses of wine in a bottle means you're paying four times the glass price for one bottle, with some bottles adding a buck or two. The martinis are four ounce glasses (most specialty martinis are closer to five) and they're $11 a pop. Not a cheap date. Unless you have a Groupon.  Since the demise of Kaze, I think it's fair to say that Kamehachi will be one of my very top sushi go-to's. I've needed one of those, too.",0.9979,0.734,0.248,0.018,0.6051848151848152

Kamehachi is great for a standard, average-yet-good experience. The most memorable dish I order every time is their steamed dumplings, the shumai appetizer. They have inspired me to start making them because I cannot get enough! I have been at this location a few times, because I live in the area and twice because of Groupons. It sometimes takes a while to get a table, but most nights are very low key and you'll have a lot of space to yourself. It just depends. Call ahead. As for their sushi, it has always been fair-to-good quailty, but nothing that I remember. My husband raves about the green turtle roll, while I typically go for one special roll and a few nigiri. No outright complaints, other than the decor feels outdated and cheap. They have beautiful custom wood panels in the stairwell and second floor walls, but they lined them with visible rope lighting. For the money, I have had stellar experiences at Mizu Sushi (right around the corner from Kamehachi on North Ave.) and Oysy. The decor and interesting special roll presentations delight me at those places. Now for a much less stellar review for the downtown Kamehachi.....heads up for this location, there is a HUGE difference between raw salmon and raw tuna.

The food is always consistently between good and excellent - no matter what you order. I've ordered the regular items and the special menu items and most of the time lick the last bits off my plate (metaphorically speaking).  And the 'namesake' is the best I've tasted. I don't know who their fish dealer is, but the namesake melts like butter every time you put it in your mouth - soft, smooth, totally creamy.  EVERY TIME. I've eaten sushi in several big cities in america at posh restaurants, and small holes and in Chicago, but this place is my home. I'll always keep coming back. And happily - not because there's no competition.  Shame on you for still reading this, you should be calling them right now :) The service staff are always friendly, helpful and courteous. I'm a down-to-earth kind of person and have no patience for snootiness.  Example of good servicemanship: One time we ordered for delivery, there were 2 pieces namesake missing from our order. I called them soon as I'd realized (the delivery man had left by then) and asked them what they could do. I realized it was a saturday night, that they were must be busy on deliveries and that they probably wouldn't have time to redeliver, so I suggested they could give me a discount for the 2 namesakes the next time I visited. Instead the manager immediately apologized, said the namesakes would be on their way to me right away, thanked me for being so considerate to pardon their error. 15 minutes later, the delivery man rang my doorbell, apologized, refused a (second) tip and gave me the namesake and left. If that isn't excellent service, I don't know what is. That's why I'll keep going back. You get (more than) what you pay for in this place. For my husband and me, its a refuge.

Aside from that, I've tried other things here and there, but those are the staples I have to have everytime. The prices are comparable to other sushi joints. The only con here is that the service can be slow at times (as this place is ALWAYS packed), but the quality of food makes it tolerable.

Not everywhere has the natto, and this natto maki melted in my mouth. Mmm... The ume shiso maki tasted quite balanced as well.

Some of the must try is the Chicago Crazy Roll (tuna, salmon, crab, yellowtail, cucumber, and masago) and  the green turtle roll (eel, Cucumber, tempura pieces and Avocado with eel sauce). For the dessert, they had ice cream mochi and tiramisu?! I know there's a prominent Italian heritage in Chicago, ok sure. The mochi ice cream was good but of course it was the frozen kind. The tiramisu actually tasted pretty good. The service was friendly and efficient. The rolls range from $5 to $12 and appetizers are $6-10.

2008-08-27,1.0,"Been here once and will not return. We came here at around 2:30 pm on a Tuesday, certainly not prime time, but still... $10 Martini that was drinkable, nothing special, though slightly watery. Fried oyster appetizer. This was OK although served with dijon mustard and sweet/sour sauce, which makes you feel as though you're eating spring rolls (not to mention there was no meaningful flavor synergy). Then sushi: spicy tuna maki, new york maki, and sunset maki. First of all, the wasabi they gave us was seriously weak. The sushi itself was simply underachieving in every aspect. The seaweed was dry, the rice was too starchy and layered way too thickly around the rolls (this should be obvious even from the couple pictures posted here on yelp), and the added condiments such as spiced aioli and roe were simply flavorless. The fish was fresh enough, but everything else was supermarket quality.  Service was also bad. Maybe since the place was empty the servers were taking things easy, but our sushi arrived on the table several minutes before the appetizer, and we had to ask for the check twice. They also almost took down the wrong order but when she was reading through everything at the end we noticed the mistake. Maki rolls at sushi samba (where I usually go) are only like a dollar/roll more expensive than they are here, and they're made 100 times better. Cocktails at sushi samba are $1 more and also 100 times better. Should have just stuck with the tried and true.",0.4044,0.802,0.102,0.096,0.51001924001924

Dessert was a momentous occasion, as it was the first time that Mr Man ever had mochi!  Thank goodness I came along to broaden his horizons.

While I definitely like Kamehachi's hot dishes (boyfriend ordered a pretty fabulous yaki soba) and their tsukemono (Japanese pickles) are relatively good, I was really unimpressed with their sushi- both the maki (I'm not a huge fan of maki, but am easing the boyfriend into sushi) and the nigiri were terrible. First, the sushi was tiny, hardly worth the price unless the quality of fish was decent- which it wasn't. The ikura tasted really old and disgusting, and the nori on the maki was very tough and stale. There was little rice on any of the maki, and the spicy mayonaise was almost non-present on any of those rolls. Second, the texture of the (minimal amounts of) fish was gummy and not fresh. The only sushi I ordered that was any good was the natto maki (which I was very excited about because few American sushi joints serve the stuff). Third, the delivery took over an hour and a half on a Wednesday night, which is utterly ridiculous given the fact that the sushi looked and tasted like it'd been made by a five-year-old. If you're a serious sushi eater (lived in Japan, order uni and wouldn't dream of ordering a 'California roll', et cetera, et cetera) DO NOT BOTHER. You'll be severely disappointed. I spent almost sixty dollars and ended up throwing out sushi, because it was that bad. I seriously could have gone to Jewel and purchased fresher sushi, which is really sad.

The sauce is much thicker than dishes offered by other places, and the hefty slab of meat  is far and away the best offering I've found in the entire city.

2006-12-20,5.0,"Seriously, this is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.  I can't say I'm one of the die-hard sushi fans, although I do enjoy GOOD sushi.  And it really has to be good.  Can't tolerate the crap - and I've never had crap here.   This is also the place where I tried sake for the very first time - yes that's right, I was once a sake virgin, too.  It wasn't bad, but I think I'll stick to wine.  But I digress... The service has always been great and the ambience is fantastic , especially if you dine upstairs.  If you haven't been to this place yet, then be sure to put it at/near the top of your list!",0.9801,0.745,0.244,0.01,0.6775793650793651
2006-11-20,5.0,This is one of the first places I went to for sushi when I moved here. It has been here a really long time and for good reason! The sushi is very tasty and fresh. They have a good selection of speciality maki as well. I usually eat at the sushi bar which is fun. The service is great as well!,0.9615,0.705,0.295,0.0,0.4370370370370371
2006-11-18,5.0,"Ok so I'm stuck at home working on a Saturday night (don't worry, I plan on being absolutely useless during the few days of work next week to make up for it!) - but I figure I should treat myself to some take out sushi so I'd feel better I love the Kamehachi on Ontario, and since Sushi X seemed to be going downhill each time I tried it, I thought I'd give Kamehachi a try for delivery.  First time I ordered from this location and was told it would be an 1-1 1/4 hour till it got here - it was here in less than 40 minutes, probably closer to 30.  Nice surprise! I couldn't believe it got here from such a busy area so quickly on a Saturday evening Also its just so damned good, and so reasonably priced! They have the best spicy tuna (well Katachi is just as good but too far away sadly) - I also tried the green turtle which was definitely interesting in a good way :) Summer roll is also excellent. Really I haven't had anything here yet I haven't really liked! This is now where I just go for sushi for takeout, its so dependable and I hate taking chance on takeout sushi!!! I would highly recommend Kamehachi! Especially if you are a lazy ass like me and like your sushi brought to you! Kamehachi, I love you for satisfying my sushi fix without requiring me to even step out my door!",0.9959,0.65,0.268,0.082,0.5851612903225807

Though the service has sometimes been hit or miss (I waited far too long for just simple tuna rolls the last time I went) they usually are fast and it's not too pricey. They have other entrees on the menu that are good, which is nice for people who aren't huge sushi people. This is usually my fall-back spot for a last minute sushi reservation. I like how this location has a more intimiate setting upstairs, while the other location on Ontario is much larger and spacious.   After reading other Yelp reviews, it sounds like I need to try this Salmon Teriyaki!",0.8757,0.847,0.121,0.032,0.48620448179271714
2006-04-18,4.0,"You'll find trendier sushi spots in town, but Kamehachi is one of the better ones in my opinion because their fish truly is fresh. The decor varies - upstairs is more dimly lit and 'funkier', compared to the downstairs which is a bit crowded and a bit lacking in atmosphere. However, my favorite spot is their outdoor patio in the summer. I guess I've grown to love this place so mush as it's a regular standyby being a few doors down from my apartment.  Now for the food...as others have mentioned, I'm obsessed with the Green Turtle Roll! They stuff the rice with eel and its sweet brown sauce along with crunchy tempura flakes. On the outside, they lay a piece of ebi (shrimp) over the rice and drizzle the whole thing with a creamy wasabi sauce (to die for!) and green tobiko. It somehow combines every taste combination in one go - sweet, spicy, creamy, crunchy - it's a must!",0.9748,0.793,0.165,0.042,0.46348824786324794
