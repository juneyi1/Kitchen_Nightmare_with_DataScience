2017-07-01,2.0,"Stopped here today while visiting my sister. I got the chicken flautas which were actually cheaper than at most other places ($6 compared to $10). They tasted like they were dipped in wet towels and put on my plate. They were also small and the chicken scarce. Hubby got the huevos con chorizo and his was just so so but then he was feeling sick some time later. We got a chicken torta for my son who normally loves them but not this one. He did not want it at all and spit it out as soon as it went in his mouth. Service was a bit slow and we had to keep getting the waitress for different things because she just kept walking to other tables to take orders. The place is small and with 2 servers, I don't see why this would be so slow. Not to mention, the one who took our order didn't write it down and then forgot to bring out the torta so my son waited a bit longer for his food. We wouldn't return.",0.3219,0.915,0.046,0.039,0.5056489262371615

2017-01-30,4.0,"I usually have camarones a la diabla, but they have raised their prices. Today I ordered the enchiladas verdes de pollo. The tortillas are handmade and are very filling. The order comes with 3 enchiladas, rice and beans for $6.99. That's a hell of a deal.  The salsa is bomb!  The only reason why I knocked off a star was because the place is extremely cold and uncomfortable. I had to keep on my jacket.",-0.95,0.81,0.0,0.19,0.71
2015-07-03,1.0,"I always place my order over the phone and every time they got it wrong!!! The worst thing is that if u call to complain the rude waitress start swearing and complaining in Spanish with someone else, the last time I ordered was the Huevos rancheros and I guess the food was too hot when they put it on the container that when I took the plate out of the plastic all the food fell underneath, so I called to let them know and the rude waitress had the guts to tell me it was my fault!!! YES my fault! I went there for my money back and she told me not to ever placed an order again on the phone again with them!!  I told her not to worry I will never placed an order again at all with them!!! Wish there was a none star option.",-0.9479,0.785,0.053,0.162,0.5020833333333333

2013-09-11,5.0,"Having lived in the Humboldt Park for sometime, I'd have to say this is one true authentic Mexican restaurants in the area.  I love ""La Quebrada"" for multiple reasons:   Let me state again the fact on how authentic this restaurant is. Being and having a Mexican background I can assure you this fact.  There aren't many places in the Chicago area which offer handmade pressed tortillas, and you can have them here. Their tortillas taste and are as great as their food.  I tend to switch the kind of dishes I order every time I'm here, although I always seem to go back to the "" cecina albañil"". This dish comes with- cecina, which is the type of steak, much thinner but has a great flavor, they add salsa albañil and it's divine- perhaps on the spicier side for some.  I myself love a kick to my food.  But if you're not into spicy type of dishes they can always add your salsas on the side for your own taste.  Restaurant wise they're very clean which is primary to a good restaurant.  Food and service is great. I have been a customer for over 6 years and always keep coming back.",0.9926,0.805,0.195,0.0,0.529047619047619
2010-12-12,5.0,"Oh man, so good.   First time here.  Wow, large portions much bigger than expected.  Honestly the nachos plate, or any of the combination plates is well enough for two people.  You will get filled up.  Tasty too.  But know what to expect and you should be happy.  Good fried norteno type food.  We got an order of nachos, a combinacion azteca, and a combinacion campesina.  OH MAN, the Campesina was by far my favorite.  oh man, so tasty, good meats, and sides of rice and beans.  MAN!  I know if i went to a place that I normally do in my neighborhood, it'd cost nearly twice as much for what i got.  We had to take most of the food home, honestly we didn't expect how much it was.  Still tastes good a few days later.  We'll drop by whenever we're in the neighborhood.",0.9847,0.781,0.206,0.013,0.5787784679089026
2010-10-21,4.0,"Very good food.  Very nice service.  Very clean space.  All around, La Quebrada is a great little place. Save the junkie who twice hit up the people dining at each table during the time that I spent there (no one gave him any money, thank God; I gave him a taco -- you can't shoot up a taco), my meal at La Quebrada was great.",0.9777,0.654,0.346,0.0,0.6842857142857143
2010-08-19,5.0,"I stumbled in here one day, starving after a long thrifting session. I was surprised by the excellent, fresh hot salsa. I was even more surprised by the handmade tortillas, and succulent, non-greasy cecina (which I had never had before and now love). I don't speak Spanish so there was some confusion and they brought me a whole dinner plate of cecina tacos, but they took it back and gave me the one taco I ordered. (I was less pleased with my other taco, a shrimp taco).  I was truly regretting this by the end - the cecina tacos were so good I wanted more!  For this reason alone (I still feel a bit bad) I will be going back soon to order the dinner plate. This place is a bit out of the way but it's so worth a visit.  Nothing compares.  I've since been disappointed by cecina elsewhere.",0.8443,0.768,0.145,0.087,0.5054166666666666
2010-01-02,5.0,"On a cold December evening we randomly stumbled upon this place while waiting for my wife's battery to be charged at the nearest Autozone.  The atmosphere seemed drab but the staff was all smiles.  The service was intelligent and attentive.  The food however, was very very delicious.  Our order was about as simple as it gets - just some tacos and a few sides - but something about them warmed up our bodies and our souls.  Every bite tasted uber-fresh and tasty.  We weren't choking on salt and lard.  The fresh herbs in the tacos made a huge difference.  The cecina was lean, succulent and tender (not leathery or fatty), and flavorful.  The marinated pork was warm-spicy and almost crunchy with bbq goodness.  Of course fresh banana-chocolate licuados, carrot juice and wonderful warm roasted salsa added to the overall surprise and delight we felt eating here.  I told my wife when we were driving around looking for food, ""I just want to find a taqueria.""  This certainly was the tastiest, most enjoyable 'taqueria' I've ever eaten at.",0.9955,0.724,0.27,0.007,0.607563025210084
2007-07-10,4.0,"On a slow Monday night Seth and I headed to La Quebrada 3, a restaurant I had heard about for a long time but had never visited. There are 8 La Quebradas around Chicago, each offering something slightly different - Mariachis at one, more diner style at another. The restaurant was started by a serial entrepreneur originally from Mexico. The food is delicious, or so I had heard.  After a short drive we found parking in the lot next to the restaurant, and were greeted by a young woman who was uncomfortably bi-lingual.  The menu, fortunately for me, was in both Spanish and English, although I ordered in Spanish and our servers spoke to us mostly in Spanish, using English only when we looked at them confused when they spoke too fast. There's the usual breakfast items, Mexican restaurant items, etc that are anything but usual. Flavors are bright, forward, and delicious. Our salsa was one of the best I've had in a long time. And the dishes we ordered - variants of pounded chicken breast with toppings -- were incredible. The tortillas were also delicious and tasted home made.  Our bill for two, gorging on enormous dishes of chicken, beans, and rice was $25. It is BYO, but both of us were happy with non-alcoholic beverages. Not too many anglos dine here...but if you do go, it is well worth the trip. And check this out for the menu:  laquebrada.net/Quebrada%…",0.9872,0.831,0.144,0.025,0.5191176470588236
