The food wasn't that good and considering the location (literally right next to the train) it was a bummer I hadn't eaten all day and was looking for something tasteful/memorable and I got the complete opposite. On the plus side, they have pretty good salsa, though the chips seemed a bit greasy. There was an off taste to their salsa verde and you know the rest... I won't be coming back here. 1/4 of my friends enjoyed the food and on top of all negative, my friend did not enjoy her food and when she asked if she could order something else, they said she would have to pay for a whole separate order.

After striking out by a few minutes up near Irving Park (it was a Wednesday night, I'm sure these folks thought -- who is OUT right now!?), I resigned myself that no burritos were going to be in our future. Luckily, our Uber driver rolled in a mini-van and had some serious chops for late night eats on the Northside. He zipped us over to the Addison el stop pronto and 10 minutes and $55 later I had a bag o' burritos weighing in at around 10lbs. We delayed instant gratification in respect for our revered tour guide -- no burritos open in an Uber or Taxi, that's just not cool, particularly if you are lacking coordination. They are messy to eat if sober, disastrous while potentially slightly 17 sheets to the wind.  Suffice it to say -- these burritos were wolfed down unceremoniously in the lobby of our hotel, and everyone in the crew thanked the burrito gods the next morning (and right then, too -- really).  Most all of us had the carne asada -- a solid choice. These burritos aren't haute cuisine but after you've made some poor decisions it'll seem like the best thing that's every crossed your lips. The guys at the shop were nice (but I'm sure thankful we were not eating in as they'd already stacked the chairs up). I wouldn't make a habit of using the bathroom but it would do in an real emergency.  Cash only.  Carne Asada.  Salvation.

2015-07-27,5.0,"I had never been to Chicago before this past weekend (besides a flight transfer) and having a very small amount of ""good mexican"" to my native Southern Californian palette, I was definitely searching for a good mexican place to satiate my enormous burrito appetite. See, the problem with most mexican food in the midwest is that while it may be good in it's own fashion, it does not replicate the mexican food I grew up with in San Diego. So after much research looking over the city of Chicago for a good place, I decided to try this place since it is right off the red line. And by right off the red line, I mean literally right off the line: you get off at Wrigley and turn to the opposite side and it's there. It was wonderful. The menu is written in both English and Spanish and the chefs are unequivocally of mexican descent. These things I thought were typical of all mexican food taco shops but I'm finding out here in the Midwest it is not the norm. Finding this to be true was a great start. I ordered a carne asada burrito without beans, a carne asada taco, and an al pastor taco. My wife ordered a bean and cheese burrito with sour cream. I was hungry and excited, ok?? It was pretty hot in the taco shop so the wife and I walked down Addison to the lake for some relief. Great spot if you are thinking about it, just 12 minutes or so to walk there. The carne asada was cooked perfectly and the seasoning on it was delicious. The red salsa is also the perfect amount of kick to it for me as well. I couldn't get over the fact that I was eating the best food I had since moving out to the Midwest (Cleveland) in over a year. It was incredible. The Al Pastor taco was even better than the burrito. Literally no complaints about the Al Pastor. If I had one suggestion about the burrito it was that there wasn't enough cheese (I like cheese) and the tortilla was more on the uncooked texture (still cooked but had that more uncooked flour taste to it). My wife loved the tortilla as a side note. If I ever end up in Chicago again, I will absolutely go back to El Burrito Mexicana without question.

Wonderful meat to cheese to lettuce ratio with just enough tortilla to keep it all wrapped up. The meat was seasoned perfectly and I found it difficult to stop eating that delicious burrito.  I also ordered a small horchata. For a whole-in-the-wall restaurant, it was pretty good. It wasn't the best horchata, but it was far from the worst I've ever had.

The burrito was pretty good. The steak in it was juicy, and I liked that they put avocado in it too. YUMMY! The tongue tacos were very good too. I like the simplicity of the tongue taco: corn tortilla, tongue, onion, and cilantro. You can't go wrong with that. The best part about their tongue tacos is that the meat is tender and isn't overcooked like at many other taquerias. Oh, and the horchata... it's the same everywhere, but I LOVE it.

Round #2 - Burrito Asada (Steak) con Aquacate (Avocado) 3:30AM rolls around and I'm starving.  Thank you El Burrito Mexciano for being approximately 1.3 blocks away from my house.  I bring along my best friends (and 9 cans of assorted 12 oz. beers for leverage ""wink wink"").   We roll in at a fairly busy hour, and I suggest a trade ""Beer for Food"".  All the faces in the restaurant look new (from the hours previous), so I'm wondering how this will work.  ""None of us drink amigo"" says the guy at the register.  I'm shocked, and I decide to take my leverage material off the table to keep out of plain sight.  Oh well, I'm a little buzzed and sure as hell not going to Bacci under any condition, so I decide to go with the burrito. Good surprises all around with that choice.  I was very surprised by the extra kick in my burrito which seemed like it had a sliced jalepeno or serrano thrown in.  Good surprise, especially in such cold conditions.  I polished off that burrito like it was my business, and I proceed to spread the love by handing out the remaining cans of beer to the patrons eagerly waiting to order.  Salud!

The bread is amazing, and it's a great way to experience the mexican meal.

But I digress.  The food here is great.  But the restaurant itself is scary.   Dirt everywhere.  Downright frightening bathroom.  Horrific clientele.  But hey, you're not seeking out Frontera Grill.  If you want a cheap, tasty taco, and happen to like spending your evenings at (God forbid) Moe's Cantina, this is the place for you.",0.9382,0.763,0.153,0.084,0.5691919191919191

This is pretty much the only occasion for which Burrito Mexicano should be on your radar. No, really.
