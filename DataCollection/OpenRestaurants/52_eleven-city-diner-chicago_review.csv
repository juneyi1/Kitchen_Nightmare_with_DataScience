A manager/owner that treats their employees without respect is disgusting. I was amazed that he behaved that way in front of a customer, I wonder how he treats his staff when customers are not around to witness his behavior. I dont like supporting businesses that don't treat their customers fairly, therefore I won't be back.",-0.6853,0.815,0.059,0.125,0.375

Once we were seated by the door it took a long time for the waitress to come over we ordered our drinks and food which was fine, but the waitress was not friendly at all. She didn't have a name tag or else I would name her, every interaction was like a ""drive-by"" she would say something to us as she walked by and continue on.

I explained to her we wanted to sit outside and she said ""We do not allow children under 10 years of age to sit on the patio for safety reasons"". I was very confused never in my life had i heard that from any restaurant but said ok, we moved to our table inside.

When we call in they take other phone calls while on the phone with us mid order and make us wait while they are on the phone with someone else for five minutes. I believe the proper thing is to make the customer who called after us wait by saying ""please hold"" not telling us to hold and making us listen to your conversation with the other customer. They also always say ten minute wait and when we show up in ten minutes the food is never ready. We have always had to wait an extra 20 plus minutes when we come pickup our takeout.

It was good but nothing I would come back for. I also had some of my wfie's omelette. All and all a solid spot. The food isn't ground breaking or unique...pretty standard. But decent food with fast service makes for a great experience. And yes, they do manage to decorate their blood mary's with plenty of goodies.",0.9754,0.773,0.19,0.037,0.5365546218487395

My husband enjoyed the French toast with berries (non-GF)and I selected a traditional lox platter (with Udi's bread). Suggestions for improvement: 1) buy fresher tomatoes (see pictures) ... with everything else at high quality why not find another vendor to deliver succulent tomatoes for the lox dish, 2) invest in Canyon Bakehouse bread ....this company will ship GF breads and with a nicer variety of options (white, multigrain and rye substitute) the deli options and toast options could have made this a 5 vs 4 star.  Jessica gets 5 stars hand down!

2017-03-18,1.0,"I reopened my Yelp account after not writing a review for 7 years, just to tell you about the terrible service I had.  The food at this place is fine. However, I encountered one of the rudest men I've ever dealt with. I've been a few times before and never had an issue. I came again to treat my parents to lunch. The waiting area was so packed this time. My dad who just survived lung cancer was feeling clostrpohobic in their crevice of a waiting area and needed fresh air, so he stood RIGHT OUTSIDE the door. I mean RIGHT OUTSIDE. Plus, he also exited because every 2 minutes you're being shuffled around by employees to not block the door or hallway (which is almost impossible).  I went to take my dad a menu to peruse and I was firmly stopped by a flamboyant, man wearing glasses. I believe this man to be the owner (Brad Rubin) after reading other reviews about a man with the same arrogant and condescending manner. He informed me I couldn't take a menu outside. Which is no big deal to me. However, this guy said it with such an attitude, it was as if I was a criminal walking out with the cash register. It wasn't WHAT he said, but HOW he said it. He was so curt and smug. I explained to him our extenuating circumstance and he rolled his eyes and snobbishly shimmied away. He was beyond rude I was actually taken aback. I then told him that I would be taking my business elsewhere. He tried to patronize me by telling me I was ""obviously under a lot of stress."" Nothing better than someone just being a flat out dick and then having them try to project it on to you. I'm not stressed, you're just an ass. It was his transparent attempt to be passive aggressive and say ""F-you"" to me and get away with it. He wasn't the least bit concerned with our medical needs, but feigned it with his patronizing comment. I have never had such an incident as a customer in all of my adult life. And I have been a city dweller for 15 years. I dine out a lot. I work in customer service. This man just is, as another yelper put it - an ego maniac. I am not a tourist. I'm a Chicago LOCAL. Do NOT give this man your business. Especially, when there are other businesses trying to make it that actually treat you like a human being.  Their waiting area must be on the cusp of violating fire code. If it wasn't so awful, nobody would be compelled to wait outside in first place. They even installed a loud speaker outside so you can hear your name being called. So, I don't know why they'd freak out over walking 2 feet outside the door with a menu for a little 75 year old man when their bad design is creating the issue. It's a menu, not a gold bar.

It holds a special place in my heart because my bf and I found it wandering through downtown Chicago years ago, and we've made a point to come here every time we visit Chicago since then. I make all of my friends and family-whoever I'm with in Chicago-come here.  I love the Jewish deli meets classic diner atmosphere. My family members get a kick out of all the little accents in the Diner that remind us of our own family, like the wall menu boasting ""a nice piece of fish."" I've been 100% satisfied with all of the food I've tried here, which ranges from burgers, to scramblers, to chopped liver and latkes. I noticed on my last visit that they have a ton of shmears that look fantastic, and now I know my next visit will definitely involve a bagel.  Want to indulge in some carbs and dairy after you've done so well on your diet, but you really need a cheat day? Look no farther than the Eleven City Diner mac and cheese. Try it, I'm not kidding. And if you still have any doubts, I can at least promise that you won't be disappointed ordering their root beer or bloody mary.

2017-02-12,4.0,"tl;dr: But for a couple non-food faults would be five stars. Experience would probably be better for a party less than 5-7.   We waited only a couple of minutes for a table for 8 with 3 kids on a Sunday around 3PM.  Sat near the kitchen which wasn't so bad as everything smells amazing. Learned later that there was more seating upstairs not in use. Don't know why. Forgot to ask.  Menu isn't extensive but lots of house made standard diner options (challah french toast, corned beef, etc.) that are quite attractive.   Server took our orders as swiftly as 5 adults and 3 kids allows and got every order on the first try. Starter and soup came out soon but salad wasn't out until just as mains arrived which took a while. Demerits for incorrect and slow pacing a big group.  Otherwise, server was attentive to clearing, refills, and other requests.  I ordered a burger medium rare with Swiss and bacon on brioche with fries. Juicy and cooked as requested with crispy bacon and melted cheese.  Fries were done slightly crispy and well seasoned.  Everyone else was very happy with their corned beef, pastrami and burgers, etc.  Kids seems a bit underwhelmed, but I'll chalk that up to several hours car riding and walking around McCormick Place.  Overall excellent but just a little off on a couple of details. For a big group the pacing needs to be a better and group seating should be more available especially on a weekend off peak.",0.9837,0.867,0.125,0.008,0.4597222222222222

Delicious Bloody Mary - flavorful mix and yummy, hearty garnishes to hold you over before your brunch/lunch comes. While this place is definitely very influenced by it's presumably Jewish roots, there is a wide variety of menu items that you won't find at other comparable places. I.E. Chilaquiles and spiked mint chocolate chip milk shakes among other things - how amazing does the latter sound?! MUST go back to try! Service was fantastic. Very informative, fun, and personable. I asked our waitress about the chilaquiles, as the menu is not very descriptive, and she recommended I try them by adding chorizo and avocado to them. I did. And they were awesome. Only complaint is there was very little chorizo, which may have been a blessing in disguise, because the more there was the more I was guaranteed to eat.  Beware that they can only split the check two ways and no more. Whatever, everyone's got Venmo these days, right?

2017-01-16,2.0,"I know it sounds cliche, but I really wanted to love this place. It's a few blocks away from home, and we've gone several times as a family and with out of town guests. The food is pretty decent - who can turn down challah French toast? Bloody Marys are good and tried the lox and potato pancakes ... I've had better. I digress.  Two stars seems a bit harsh, but I give one for the service we've received from the wait staff, and one for the slightly above average food. I would also give one for the aesthetics of the place but the last couple experiences we had completely turned us off to the place and we will never be back.  We came here early on Black Friday when they barely had any customers yet. They had no table ready for a group of our size (four adults and four children under 8) so we had to wait. The upstairs section was completely empty and apparently none of the tables were set up. Fair enough. We waited about 10-15 minutes for a table upstairs. The 2nd level is ridiculously hot, and I get it, heat rises ... but I've been in other restaurants with the lofted set-up that did not feel that uncomfortably hot. Ceiling fans or better HVAC balancing would help, perhaps? None of these are deal breakers yet in my book as long as I can get good meal and good service.  We visited once more with this same group at the end of December. This time we met my brother in law there as he was getting his car out of the parking garage and finding parking while the rest of us Ubered over as the kids were starving and we figured he could join us later, especially since we expected we'd be waiting a little bit like last time.  We arrived and there was a guy and 2 or 3 hostesses up front and a line was forming in their tiny waiting area. My sister in law let them know there were 8 of us, but that there were 4 adults and 4 children, as most places want to know if they need to offer high chairs and children's menus, etc. The guy taking down her name cut her off and said ""I don't need to know how many children, how many HUMANS are in your group."" She was caught off guard and replied that she had 8. Apparently the guy was not in the mood for simple arithmetic? He then pre-emptively lectured us on how we should keep the kids out of the revolving doors. Thanks for the tip, I guess? We all crunched up In the area by the candy shop (what kind of restaurant has a candy shop and is not kid friendly, right?) and I had my 7 month old infant in a carrier, and my 8 and 5 year old nephew were pretty quiet, while my 5 year old was becoming a little restless. Same issue as last time with the no tables set on the 1st floor, but the entire 2nd floor was completely empty again. Why they made us wait downstairs standing up with 4 small children is beyond me. Would it really have been that hard for them to set up a table in an otherwise empty section and just give the kids some water and put in an order for them? I get it, there's a flow and there may not have been a waiter/waitress immediately available. A hostess kept offering them crackers, which was nice at first, but got a little irritating when what we all really needed was to just sit down.  We finally got seated and within minutes my BIL showed up. We'd already ordered him a drink, so he certainly didn't hold anything up. Up until this point, I would have no qualms continuing to frequent this restaurant. Until ... the guy at the front walked up to our table with a hostess. At first I thought they had just stopped to chat in front of our table, but then the guy started talking to us. He very passive aggressively asked ""Hi, we just wanted to check, will you have any other late comers in your group?"" He then started scolding us about how they don't allow late comers and they wouldn't seat us if our whole group was not there. The hostess was standing next to him smugly, looking like an older sibling who just tattled on us. I was completely bewildered and speechless at how he spoke to our group. He might as well have been lecturing his children with his tone and attitude. When he walked away, we all looked at each other in disbelief. We asked the waitress if we could talk to someone about how incredibly condescending and disrespectful the guy had been and lo and behold ... the guy was the OWNER. An owner who clearly does not care about treating his customers with dignity. Yes, I guess we are now aware of the no seating partial groups (even 7/8 of a group is ""partial"", thank you very much) but after being talked down to and sneered at by the restaurant owner and his minion hostess, we have zero interest in returning.  TL;DR: the owner is an arrogant jerk, food is slightly above average, plenty of better dining experiences in the city. Also if I had to sit and listen to him call out names on the loud speaker booming over the entire restaurant (is that really necessary when everyone is standing in the same tiny waiting area RIGHT in front of the host stand?)

It was BEYOND. So good! It had salami, cheese, 2 big juicy olives, a huge celery stalk, spices, it was absolutely BEYOND. We were seated at the bar that day and we watched the bartender at work as we sat there chatting. I would say that 70% of the drinks he made in the space of the hour or so we sat there were Bloody Mary's, so clearly this is one of their more popular drinks. On this first visit I tried the corned beef/pastrami hash with 3 eggs over easy. I have to say: the corned beef/pastrami number was super meh, but I ate it nonetheless. The main attraction on my plate was the potatoes. Heavenly father those potatoes were AMAZING. Eating them was low key orgasmic.  The second visit was even better. I had their pastrami burger on a brioche bun; add bacon and avocado (I should've added cheese, but I naively thought it would come on the burger by default). The burger was good though. It came with fries, which were delicious, also. I asked for a side cup of their spicy ketchup, which I was surprised did not accompany the burger and fries number by default. The spicy ketchup was a nice touch for the fries and everything else I had going on. This time, instead of the Bloody Mary, I had a vodka lemonade. It was ok; I think my friend oversold it a bit, as it was just ok. It's basically frozen lemonade with vodka in it. The Bloody Mary was better.

At all. You have to have one person pay for it all and pay them back. Which is just extremely inconvenient and incredibly stupid.

We got there around 11 and had to wait 20 minutes for a table for four. I was expecting a worse wait as Eleven City is highly popular especially on the weekend. Our table was strangely placed in the kitchen area, which made it hella hot the entire time but can't knock their ability to add extra seats. We all ordered Bloody Marys to start which were okay, but not the best I've had. Lacked spice but you could taste to booze...a lot. I love the olives and meats and cheese you get, delicious!  For breakfast I had the black and white french toast, which is their lovely french toast with the best bread ever topped with white chocolate, milk chocolate and pretzel pieces. Holy moly. I was in heaven as a chocolate lover. It was piping hot and oh so good. Portion size was huge but that didn't stop me from eating most of it. We had the liver appetizer to share, which we specified was an appetizer, but it came out with the rest of the food. Not what we wanted, but no big deal. We all loved the liver; it was liver for sure, but had a subtle sweetness. Come to find out it was actually beef liver and not chicken liver, but I think I found my new favorite kind!  Dining partners had the berry french toast (which my mom ate all of it, so it was good) and the others one of their huge breakfast sandwiches and more of their phenomenal bread.

Here I have this great idea in my head, thinking there's some kind of historical significance to the history of a culture and the number 11. No dice. Really. It's near 11th street in Chicago. That's it. I did, however, discover that supposedly the concept of the classic diner, once found in abundance on Chicago street corners, are now dwindling and Brad Rubin wanted to keep the diner dream alive. Mission accomplished. Only my idea of a diner doesn't come with vaulted ceilings.  I went with breakfast for dinner. First time. I felt the need to deviate in some way. The moon was in Pisces. Living on the edge, right? The traditional stacked deli sandwiches were too complicated for eating in front of someone I didn't know. I almost pulled the trigger on a salad, but landed on a pesto omelet with feta and tomatoes. The eggs were too silky and I think that had to do with the amount of milk mixed in. My friend had French Toast with enough icing on it to compete with a roach-motel bedspread illuminated under a black light. I kind of enjoyed watching him eat it for that reason. I was glad he ordered it too. Our waitress was trying too hard to be friendly, but I think she was training a new hire. When she came back around to ask if we wanted dessert, I became the focus of her sales pitch, due to the fact that I had something closer to an actual meal. I was able to shut her down with a little white lie about sampling his icing-covered, batter-saturated pieces of bread. Too bad they aren't open 24 hours.",0.9555,0.879,0.094,0.027,0.4880045039135947

I had the orange sueno Belgian waffle, which had cranberries baked into the waffle and a sauce made with fresh-squeeze orange juice over top.  It was delicious, but the topping was almost like a syrup, which made it quite sweet.   The one downside was that the service was pretty slow.  We waited a while after we got seated to even get waters, then waited more to take our orders, and 'check-ins' in between were pretty sparse.  We definitely gave off a relaxed vibe with our group, we weren't in a hurry, but that still doesn't excuse slow/inattentive service.  Overall, great food and a unique atmosphere, and I'd definitely go back to try something else!",0.9945,0.746,0.224,0.03,0.48990476190476195

However, while I'm waiting to be seated right now, I'm oddly finding this classic Jewish Delicatessen to feel a bit like Nuremberg 1939. You can't take menus outside on the patio. You can't order a root beer mug while you wait. You can't stand next to the door even if you're not blocking it. I noticed on the menu that there are two types of lox but you can't have a small sample from the counter to discern which one you'd rather order (normal deli de riguer).

2016-04-27,2.0,"I ate at Eleven-City Diner on April 24th, 2016 (a Sunday). First off, this place doesn't do reservations, which makes it difficult for a party of 7 (why they wouldn't want to help out a nice large party makes me scratch my head, but either way, it's their policy) When we arrived, we were seated at a table smashed up against the front window - the seats were very uncomfortable and we were all crammed against each other.  This is all while the hostess seated a couple of two in a ""reserved"" booth that would have easily been a better spot for our party. Our server, Amy, shouldn't have been tasked with taking care of us.  I don't entirely blame her, she was also taking care of the bar, but this led to many mistakes and things being forgotten. Most of what we ordered was good, including the burgers, Woody Allen sandwich, milkshakes, and the broccoli/potato soup. The sweet & sour cabbage soup was disgustingly thick and improperly seasoned.  For a great sweet & sour cabbage soup, go to the Bagel restaurant in Lakeview. Our waitress forgot many things, including extra sauces when ordered, extra pickles, boxes to go, etc. We had to constantly remind her before getting them, and we never got the extra order of pickles even though she added it to the bill (was taken off at the end). Also, the hostess was dressed inappropriately for the job, she had no uniform on whatsoever.

As a large group (15 people) we called the restaurant to give them a heads up because we know that can be tough. They told us they didn't take reservations, which is fine, but reassured us that they would be able to seat us in two groups at most.  When we arrived it was clear that they were unprepared and service and food suffered. I probably won't be back, but I would say this place is worth a try if you want to have a dinner experience with more upscale but decently priced food.  Best Items on the menu: Crispy onion straws, open faced turkey sandwich, turkey burger, breakfast sandwich, reuben, and challah french toast. Worst Items: Brisket Sandwich and french fries are just meh.  Food/Service: The majority of the dishes that arrived at the table were delicious and wonderful. However, one dish, the brisket sandwich arrived that was just absolutely disgusting. It had obviously been sitting around, was cold, and soggy from the juices. My friend was starving so he ate about a quarter of it, but just couldn't eat the rest it was so bad. Usually, I would let the waitress know this, but there had been so many things wrong with our order and our waitress looked so stressed and harried that neither my friend nor I could bring ourselves to speak up about it. They had obviously not given the wait staff a heads up that a large group would be coming. The waitress was nice, but we couldn't help but feel like we were just a hassle at the end of the day.

My boyfriend ordered The Leo Scramble (Lox, Eggs, & Onions) with a toasted bagel. It came with house potatoes. This was excellent especially the potatoes which were well done. I hate when a restaurant serves nearly raw potatoes or has browns for breakfast. I ordered the Rubin's Little Reubens appetizer and the Bubbie's Chicken Soup with Matzoh Ball.  The portions here are LARGE. The Rubin's Little Reubens (3 mini Reuben open faced sandwiches) were not my favorite. The sauerkraut, 1000 island, and cheese were fine. I felt the rye bread and corned beef were lacking.  The rye didn't hold up to everything on top of it and needed more toasting or grilling. The corned beef was tough.  Let's move on to Bubbie's Chicken Soup with Matzoh Ball though. This was so A-Mazing.  Not only was it the biggest matzoh ball I've ever seen but it was flavorful and delicious. (Please don't tell my Bubbie because this was way way better than hers!).  I'll be back just for the soup.  Fast and friendly service and loved the nostalgic candy counter with bulk candy and old fashioned sodas.  When is the last time you saw glass bottles of Faygo?

A couple things I've ordered in the past were a little bland and flavorless (open faced turkey sandwich for example), but for the most part the servings are more than generous, slightly over priced (my opinion) but not overly disappointing.

2016-01-01,2.0,"At best an mediocre interpretation of a diner. As a person who's lived in NYC and NJ, I know diners. This is a classic Midwest attempt at being a diner. Let's start with the outliers, a trained eye would know: 1. Bar seating is reserved. In what world is bar seating reserved? Anywhere. Anyplace. Let alone, a diner. A general rule of diners is booths and tables are hostess seated, but the bar is first come first serve. Even at Lou Mitchell's this isn't the case.  2. The ""deli"" is the same come cuts you can find at Jewel. They aren't making their own pastrami, corned beef, etc. Why pay the price that makes it seem like they are? 3. The cheesecake is clearly (as prominently displayed) from Juniors, a Brooklyn, NY institution. Yes, you're paying for them to import cheesecake from NYC.  Beyond that, let's discuss the other problems: 1. A horrible entry area. If you have to wait for a table you'll be constantly bounced around, being told to move from one location to the other. But, in reality, you'll just keep getting yelled at for blocking the door (impossible to avoid) or blocking a ""hallway"" (also impossible to avoid). Frankly, given their crappy attitude, I almost called them in for a probable fire code violation.  2. There's no reservations. None. This is a ridiculous issue, when you consider the waiting situation and reserved bar seating.  3. The food is meh. Good, but not great. Certainly not worth the wait, the surly service or price. It's meh, mostly because of all the above. The system for seating, stresses the kitchen, forcing them to rush. Which means you get a non-toasted, but toasted English muffin or raw, yes raw onions and peppers in the Rito's.  You can do better. Simple as that. Bongo Room and Yolk are nearby.

Unfortunately, I never had the opportunity to experience the food due to extremely poor customer service. I arrived to the restaurant with a large group, however not all members of the group accompanied the eight of us that were in the restaurant. The OWNER greeted us with the immediate response that all members of our party needed to be present and told our entire party to stand to the side, as not to startle the incoming customers. We obliged. We understood that all members needed to be with us, but asked if there were any accommodations that could be made. The OWNER, came back and told us that he could accommodate ten people, but reiterated that the other two people, upon arrival would not be able to sit with us. Which we understood. However, this point he presumed was not clear because he re-stated it another two times, with the unnecessary presumption that we would proceed to ""get in his face"" if they were to arrive and not be seated with us, this which he based on his ""30 years of restaurant experience."" Each member of our party assured him that that would be fine. As we waited, the hostess assured us that the OWNER does not usually behave in this way and that he may have been overwhelmed. However it was 2pm on Christmas Eve and there were only a handful of customers. The OWNER, came back and angrily asked us where the ""other two members of our party were."" At that point, having been harassed by the OWNER of the establishment, it was pretty clear to our large party that the OWNER did not want to accommodate a group of young professionals. We promptly took our business elsewhere. This was the worst customer service my party and I have ever experienced, especially by the OWNER of an establishment.

Sandwiches were maybe a little dry and could have been a bit more flavorful, but were huge and on good solid bread. Ketchup bottle on our table was empty but we scrounged one from another table.  Like others, I don't get the sea of 'reserved' signs when they don't take reservations! Just don't get it. Also, I get the whole party must be present thing, but we were left standing in the front at a time when the place was pretty much empty. Maybe be a little flexible? The only napkins present were the little ones wrapped around the flatware. If you serve giant sandwiches filled with gloppy stuff you need more napkins! Yes, they brought some when asked, but most similar places just put some on the table when your food comes. The float, which was OK but far from the best I've had, could only be served in a single glass and the request to bring a 2nd glass, please, was greeted with an attitude of ""now you want an extra glass?""  Bar service was horrific, but the people we were with said it was usually better. Couldn't make a drink properly and couldn't bring what we'd ordered, and the stock wasn't great. No Bombay Sapphire? The server said something about ""bar service isn't our thing."" The previous reviews are spot on. OK food, but served with an attitude and aloofness, and many inexplicable things like the reserved signs on the tables.

Like I said I don't mind paying for good food. Wasjust a little more than average.

I started to ask for my money back because I didn't appreciate the tone or demeanor of the butt hole that asked me to stand in another place but I did as I should. The food was just okay definitely not worth $17 I took one bite of my sandwich and gave it to the homeless guy on the corner. I hope it made his day?

They have the best bloody marys, quick service, and very nice wait staff. About a year ago I was dining here with three other family members when the cute older lady owner asked us to move because there was a larger party coming in and wanted to sit together...without being offered a free round of drinks or complimentary slice of cake...we happily agreed and moved. Fast forward to this afternoon, my fiancé and I were brunching here and before we could even finish our frozen lemonades we were approached by a bald guy (no idea if he is the manager or owner, the white guy. The black host/manager is very pleasant) who didnt ask us---he TOLD US---to move to the bar stools to free up the table we were sitting at. I agreed to move and honestly was familiar with this happening before but his approach didnt sit well with fiancé. He went up to the NICE manager and said ""we dont mind moving but we feel as though it could be done a little bit more gracefully""...the nice manager apologized and even said that he has seen us here all the time. The bald guy then overheard my fiancés conversation and asked if there was a problem. We told him he could have asked us in a different way and he flipped out. He then got completely condescending saying ""What would you of liked me to do since you're the professionals?"" At this point my fiancé told him there is no need to be an asshole about it and at that point he kicked us out and said if we didnt leave right away that he would call the cops on us.  I was completely in shock and almost thought it was something I did wrong...until I read Kevin's review and saw that it was almost the exact same review. This manager or owner, whoever he is, is a very rude and unprofessional person. Why become sarcastic and irate when a customer is giving constructive criticism?

One thing you can't say about Eleven City is that it lacks personality. From the candy stand out front to the busy look and feel, you can tell this isn't your regular brunch stop. We both ordered the Tom Waits, and there was so much food that we barely had room on the table! The spread was amazing, although the hash browns were oversalted. Midway through our meal, we were asked by an older lady (I presume she's the owner) to move tables so they could sit a large party. We obliged and were met with after-breakfast ice cream and a hearty thank you- that is an amazing customer experience.

2015-09-07,3.0,"It pains me to give this place less than 5 stars...here's the story - I live in the neighborhood and have been going here for years. The food is beyond phenomenal and the staff are great. The owner's mom, who on occasion works at the diner, reminds me so much of my own mom, and the food definitely makes me nostalgic for home. All of that has made this place my favorite in town, which says a lot if you know me.  That said, one of the managers very rudely and consistently tells diners to get a move-on after they've been seated at their table over a certain period of time. I can understand [kindly] asking people to wrap things up if it's very crowded and/or there is a line of diners waiting to be seated. However, every time me and/or my friends and neighbors have been asked to leave, there were several open tables available and it was always completely unprofessional behavior.  It's not enough for your restaurant to have great food along with a clean and creative appearance - it's also about how you make your customers feel. I have held this place in high regard as a regular customer for many years since it reminds me so much of home, but I have now left with a bad and frankly angry feeling and don't really want to go back because of this experience. Eleven City Diner Management - think about how you make people feel because that will impact whether you continue to gain their business or not. It's cheaper for you to hang on to repeat customers than to fight for new ones, and there's plenty of competition in the neighborhood with more added every few months.",-0.2735,0.853,0.075,0.072,0.5032191041281949

The restaurant has bar service to the sidewalk where people are allowed to drink while they wait. Pretty awesome right? It's only awesome if you want alcohol, because they won't give you water, which was all I wanted after a workout. Instead, we were ""encouraged"" to buy $2 bottled water from the cooler.  I was very confused, but my thirst won out. After 40 minutes I finally went inside and asked how much longer the wait would be. The hostess said ""I called you like three times."" And I said we wouldn't have heard you because we were standing outside. That was her opportunity to say, I'm sorry, let me get you seated right away.  Instead, she replied ""I sent someone outside."" They did seat us right away, but the interaction left a bad taste in my mouth. Our waitress was really nice, but our food was delivered with only one set of silverware. Once I finally had food and silverware, I found that the food was pretty good for a diner.

The Bloodies were far too ice-heavy, but tasted nice with a pleasant peppery kick (garnished with olives, ham/cheese, and a sad-looking celery stalk). Despite a sudden odd craving for soup, I went with breakfast: I got the Tom Waits 2am, which included hashbrowns and 2 of each: eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, and pancakes. Loved the option of marble rye toast!  Prices are on the steep side for what I consider pretty standard fare. I wasn't really impressed by the coffee, either, but it was a step above standard diner sludge and was refilled before my cup was empty.

Of course being a Jewish deli they also have perfected the art of making amazing sandwiches such as a heaping pile of pastrami and turkey on fresh challah bread. Their French toast made with the same bread is also a show stopper. Look up pictures of their black and white French toast too. Drool inducing right?!

This place is really festive inside with all kinds of decorations and things, they have big booths and then bar seating and they also have a to go counter as well. This is one of those places that makes their own corned beef hash in house, they fly in lox and bagels from NYC every day, amazing matzoh ball soup, challah bread french toast, and their lox and latkes!!! I could go on and on an on and on. You will always leave here super full so be prepared for that and/or wear stretchy pants. Their bloody mary's are also pretty awesome and they make their own mix and it is served with a little Eleven City Diner flag in it and a little meat trio. And then if brunch isn't your deal then a) we can't be friends but b) like I said their menu is huge. And their sandwiches are also so incredibly filling and huge and tasty with every bite. Their reuben in particular is awesome and they also make their own root beer too! I know right? You didn't think this place could get better, but it can! Both a dark and light rootbeer and both are very tasty.

2015-07-07,1.0,"Single women beware of going to this restaurant. Before my recent experience with the horrific owner Brad Rubin, I'd eaten at this restaurant and thought the food was extremely mediocre. So if you're visiting Chicago or are from here and looking for a restaurant to try definitely skip this place. You'll save yourself from extremely mediocre and overpriced food. Before writing this review I checked out Eleven City Diner on Yelp and there is review after review highlighting this restaurant's mediocre food and terrible service which now makes complete sense based on the crazed behavior I experienced with Brad Rubin, the owner. Today as I attempted to park my car across the street from Eleven City Diner the owner ran from his restaurant on the other side of the street and laid down in the parking space to save it for someone else and prohibit me from parking my car. No matter how many times I asked him to move so that I could park my car in the open space in front of a friend's apartment building adjacent to Eleven City Diner he wouldn't move. People stopped on the street to ask if he was ok assuming Brad Rubin's reason for laying down in the street was a medical emergency, but as he told them the reason, that he was there only to prevent me from parking, they also suggested that he get out of the street to let me park. As cars drove past they even stopped and told Rubin, the owner, to ""stop being a jerk and let the lady park her car."" I was finally forced to call the police as I had no idea who this crazed man was or why he would do such a thing. An Eleven City Diner employee came outside and told Rubin to get up because I might be calling the police, but before Rubin retreated back inside his restaurant he slapped the hood of my car several times. Once I was finally able to park, I walked over to the restaurant to see if I should direct the police there to find the man who'd been lying in the street and hit the hood of my car. As soon as I walked through the revolving doors Rubin saw me and charged at me while screaming that I wasn't allowed in the restaurant. I jumped back inside the revolving doors and Rubin grabbed the handle of the door attempting to hit me with the door. I was able to get out of the doors but this didn't stop Rubin, next he came outside and stood approximately an inch from my face continuing to scream at me. Everyone including the other Eleven City Diner staff were stunned and asked what was going on, I told them I had no idea who the man (Rubin) was or why he was acting like a crazy person all I had been trying to do was park my car. I asked the staff outside if he was a diner because in his screaming at me he told me he was a friend of the owner and that's when one of them told me he was the owner. I wholeheartedly believe if I hadn't been a woman by myself that this entire scenario would have never taken place and I would suggest that Brad Rubin put less energy into attempting to scare and attack women and more into the quality of his customer service and food!",-0.9874,0.866,0.038,0.096,0.4350981620718464

We mentioned to the hostess and manager that we were aware of their no late join policy, however, our additional guest was not going to eat, only sit with us when he arrived. They agreed it was fine given the restaurant was thinning out and the late arrival wouldn't eat. When our late arrival came in, the assistant general manager changed her mind on letting our guest join despite her superior's approval. When we tried to explain the situation, she was immediately confrontational with our entire group, starting to freak out about the policy and losing her cool in what I would consider an incredibly easy situation. The 5 foot nothing candy man immediately promoted himself to a bouncer, essentially pushing our guest out the door and telling the rest of us to leave.

But after coming here nearly a half dozen times I can say confidentially the service is objectively terrible.  The wait staff routinely takes far too long to take orders, refill drinks and bring checks and boxes.

Most recently our server, Jill, made us feel more like a chore and a burden than the paying, polite customers we were. She would take half our order then run away. We had to ask multiple times for water, napkins, refills, and the check. All she would have to do is be patient and not rush through every interaction. To be fair, every server there acts this way (and we've never been there when the diner was ""busy"" by any standard). The cherry on top of our latest experience was being berated and scolded by the floor manager. We were given a flimsy box for our leftovers. No bag. On our way out, we asked the manager up from for a bag to carry out our food. The young man, turned to us and said ""Well, we like to be green here, apparently thats not important to you."" Perhaps this explains why they limit each customer to one napkin each. Makes me wonder how much soap they use when they clean the dishes....  As for the food, its good - not great.

2015-05-03,4.0,"Eleven City's excellent atmosphere will remind you of an old fashioned diner. Its prices will not. Come here if you're looking for a casual option near the Loop. This place feels big -- big windows, big menus, big milkshakes, and big matzo balls. I love the decor and atmosphere, including the candy shop in the front, the deli meats, the barrel of pickles, and the menu on the wall. This is one of the best places in town for old fashioned sodas. We're talking phosphates with a sidecar, blonde root beer on tap, and fantastic root beer floats. I also like their bloody mary, which is almost a meal in itself. The menu is pretty big, with lots of breakfast options, sandwiches, and salads. My go-to is a pastrami sandwich on challah -- and it's one of the best pastrami sandwiches I've ever had. The turkey burger is quite delicious as well. Breakfast is fairly average and I'm pretty surprised by how long the lines are during brunch time; you can get more creative dishes at Bongo Room and better standard fare at Yolk, both about a block away.   Overall, things are a tad pricey for what you're getting at a casual diner.

2015-04-25,1.0,"So, I had a bad experience with this place, but it may have just been a product of circumstance. TL;DR: expensive root beer and condescending staff. Read on for more.  My girlfriend and I were going to meet a group of friends in the area and arrived a little early. 11 looked nice and inviting, so we stopped in for a drink to pass the time. We sat at the bar and both got a root beer (nursing a hangover), which was pretty alright. We talk with our friends and decide that we should all have dinner here, so my girlfriend goes to the hostess and lets her know that we will have a group of 7 for dinner. The hostess says okay and we sit back at the bar to wait (7:45). Now, at this time, the hostess didn't tell us that we cannot get a both until the whole group is there.  A few minutes go by and one of our friends joins us at the bar, the first in the group to arrive. She was never asked if she wanted anything to drink. Another friend arrives and also sits at the bar. She is also ignored by the staff. After talking to each other, we decide to ask the hostess how much longer it will be until we get seated (8:10). This time she takes a name down and says we can wait at the bar.  More time passes, and no one waiting with us has been served (8:30). We go up to the hostess a third time to get an estimate on how much longer it will be. The front house staff is incredibly condescending and seems annoyed that we are asking how the table is coming. Only now do they tell us that we can't put a name down for a table until EVERYONE in the group is there.  Not wanting to wait forever, we ask for the check for our two for beers and are surprised that the total is $13.10! Nowhere on any of the advertisements for the root beer did it day it was so expensive, we could have bought a few packs of Sprecher for that price.  At this point, we are quite upset at how this whole event turned out. Had the hostess told us their policy, this would be a different review. As a final kicker, as we're leaving, the female hostess and some man at the front ask in an annoyed tone ""are you leaving??""  Maybe this place is great for small groups, and I'm sure things would have been better if our group had just met at the L stop and then walked over, but I found it really disappointing how things went. We left and went to burger bar down the street and were seated immediately, even though we didn't have the entire group yet (darn stragglers).

2015-03-30,5.0,"Eleven City Diner My first experience with this diner happened more than a year ago.  I can't answer why it has taken so long to review this gem, but hibernation, insanity or possibly a good old-fashioned food coma could all be valid excuses, nonetheless; here it is in all of its buttery, eggy, doughy, meaty glory.   Atmosphere I am a lover, not a fighter.  The way to my heart is through food, and I'm pretty sure Eleven City has the perfect roadmap.  Having eaten here over a handful of times, with numerous, different menu selections, I can honestly say they do not serve a bad meal.  I'm getting ahead of myself, though.  The food may be the driving factor as to why anyone goes out to eat, but without good atmosphere the food may as well stay in the kitchen.  Luckily, this place nails it with atmosphere as well.  Imagine the perfect old-school diner and proper Jewish Delicatessen combining forces, but not before the classic ice cream parlor friend crashes the party with her somewhat low key, but equally cool bar mate.  How did they pull that off?  Perfectly.  The combination of neon, stainless steel, mirrors and the honorable rabbi illustration will comfort you just as easily as the food.  Did someone say the F-word?  Heck yeah, I did!  As it is normally best to start at the beginning with most stories that is where I shall begin.   Nosh Omelettes and I go way back, so my first choice, of course, was an omelette that I custom requested on their Name your Omelette option.  Oh, and what a glorious choice it was, my friend.  The eggs were light and fluffy, but also buttery and massive!  My go-to ingredients typically involve something resembling a western omelette, so it included fresh peppers and onions.  I didn't want any of the cheese options to start feeling left out, so I included a little cheddar action for good measure while I was throwing a ham in the mix.  That omelette would have been enough, but it also came with toast and house potatoes.  I chose the wheat toast, and it was fresh and perfectly toasted with butter.  The house potatoes were substantial, seasoned nicely and cooked just right.  I'm more of a hash brown guy, but won't turn these away any tine of the day!  That first experience won't ever be forgotten, but subsequent visits have been equally memorable.  Which other ridiculously delicious dishes have I eaten on their ALL-DAY breakfast menu, you ask?  Fantastic question.  The Kapalua Omelette (Green Peppers, Onions, Ham, Pineapple and Swiss Cheese) will cast a spell on you to order it every time you eat here.  Be strong.  The pancakes won't just fill you; they will set the bar that much higher for other pancakes and make you question life just a little deeper.  The Tom Waits 2am Breakfast Special will leave your belly and heart full and the Challah French Toast will make you weep tears of joy.  The breakfast menu is extensive, so if you can't choose, by all means, order it all.  I won't judge. Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, hands down.  How could I ever go without ordering something from that devilish lunch menu, though?  I couldn't, it wouldn't have been right of me.  The first stop, on my quest to do right, came in the form of the Woody Allen.  What a fitting name for a sandwich modeled after a famous Carnegie Deli sandwich in New York.  Triple layers of pastrami and corned beef on some very legit rye bread; I may go through withdrawal as I talk about it.  This sandwich is big, quite possible the size of Mr. Allen himself.  The meat is some of the most tender I have ever eaten.  One of those descriptions was an exaggeration; I'll let you choose which one.  After I finished I needed the waitress to console me; it was such a sad sight to no longer have any to eat.  I wish I could say the sandwich alone made for a great experience that day, but that would be too easy.  The other mind blower has a light and dark side, never runs out and will make you feel all bubbly inside.  Yeah, it's the bottomless, locally sourced, year-aged, Root Beer on tap.  Like I said, it's bottomless, so you don't even have to worry about choosing the classic or blonde, you can have both.  Which other lunch items?  I love your curiosity.  The Moshe Cristo is like all of your hopes and dreams in one sandwich.  The Schwartzy's flavors are so deep you may feel like you just fell down the rabbit hole and Rubin's Reuben may make you pass out.  In all seriousness, bring a friend for support.   Noteworthy Points: Be prepared to wait on the weekends during typical breakfast/brunch times Takes cards Parking is close Serves alcohol (you will not be disappointed in the Bloody Mary) Friendly staff",0.9995,0.733,0.219,0.049,0.5175800390086105

Well today, I couldn't find anyone to accompany me so I came to one of my favorite places and discovered the art of dining alone. Let me tell you dining at the diner or bar, is far from dining alone especially at Eleventh City diner. Everyone is welcoming and willing to talk about the weekend. Including the staff! You can even order a Bloody Mary or Mimosa while you wait to be sorted.  So, let's move on to why you're all looking for, the food. I usually chose the eleventh City diner french toast, one of the delectable Omelette or I get with one of their pastrami and corn beef open faced sandwiches.... Can you say, c-est-magnifique!!  Yet, today I figured I'd continue to push my luck, I mean I'm dining alone right; try something different. I went with the pastrami and corn beef hash. I hate to report this, but, I was so disappointed in this dish. I'm going to blame my distaste on it to being a dish that I'm unfamiliar with. Seriously, I could barely eat a forth of it. Now, if you are a ""hash"" connoisseur of sorts, then have at it!! This unfortunate occurrence is not To deter you from this place because it's much more than its hash!

2015-02-19,4.0,"Today I ate at Eleven, a Jewish themed diner. When I walked in the door I was taken by all the pictures, and nic nacs on the walls. The bar table area was really nice because it felt like a more old fashioned diner. It was a little loud and I didn't agree with the seating policy. There wasn't any organization line wise and the only place to stand and wait was right in front of the door so it was difficult for people to come and go. We had to wait forty minutes instead of the twenty five we were told because another person decided to join our party and their policy is that before you can be seated everyone has to be there. I can understand this policy but at the same time seating us and serving us and just sending that person to our table when they arrived isn't a difficult task especially when you are so busy you should want to get people in and out as fast as possible while still showing them an enjoyable meal and time.  On to the service. My waitress was exceptionally nice. It was all smiles and I felt very comfortable there. She was polite and didn't rush anyone. Waters were brought right away and she didn't hover over us which when other waiters do it gets annoying. We ordered and as we waited I saw some food come out to a table and thought to myself ""oh my god that looks phenomenal!"" That got me really excited, the food arrived fast no longer than 15-20 minutes which I was impressed by since they were packed and there were five at our table. Now it was time to eat.  My immediate thought was this is a beautiful plate. Not because of platting or being fancy, but because it was simple and classic. A perfectly cooked patty melt, with a pickle, and delicious seasoned fries. All very hot still. Those fries very great, they were crisp and tasty. Next the pickle. I love pickles so I was really glad it came with my food. And finally the patty melt. It was cooked medium like I requested, it was gooey, seasoned well and the sauce was great. The best part was definitely the grilled onions I'm a big fan and I'd say they nailed it!  All in all I'd rate out of 10 Eleven as an 8.5 which is respectable.

Whenever I order food, at ANY restaurant, and the food comes out 5 minutes after I place my order. Repeat after me: RED FLAG!!!!!! Is the food here fresh? Did the chef just slop things together?  Can I trust this hasn't been sitting out for hours?? This happened and turned me off immediately. Strike 1! Furthermore, my date and I decided after we spent over $60 dollars on rushed and ill prepared food accompanied with a couple of poorly mixed cocktails, why not just enjoy ourselves and converse to make this situation a little better.  An hour goes by, and we are interrupted in mid-conversation by the manager (who's name is BEN). He tells my date and I that the restaurant was going into their ""Dinner Rush Hour"" and that we had to move from our booth into the other side of the restaurant - Now keep in mind, if you have been to this establishment the other side of the restaurant looks like a Steak and Shake kitchen...with no seating comparable to what we were sitting I became...Repeat after me: LIVID!!!! Stike 2. I was angry and expressed to him that he should NEVER tell a customer to get out of their seats, especially when there is no one remotely lined up waiting to be seated (AND TRUST ME THERE WASN'T ONE PERSON WAITING). It made no sense. Nonetheless, THIS topped the cake. As we were leaving, BEN (the manager at Eleven City Diner) told me if I would had I spent MORE money....it wouldn't have been a problem. Strike 3! You will NEVER receive business from me again and I plan to take this to the Better Business Bureau because NO CUSTOMER should have to be treated in that manner, especially when we spent a decent amount of money for CRAPPY FOOD and DRINKS! Never EVER EVER EVER again. I strongly recommend you seek out another diner than this one. Five Guys next door will treat you better than these guys.

The restaurant has a policy about only seating complete parties, which I understand. When the remaining 2 of us arrived at 6:30, we were ""allowed"" to join our friends at their booth, but each of us received a lengthy, rude lecture about how this would never happen again, and that we were only being seated because our friends had just gotten their food. The host actually berated me the entire way to the table, and came back more than once to continue his explanation of the policy. Mind you, the two early arrivals were still eating when I sat down.

This place puts a great Chicago spin on a New York classic.  The food is very good and the ambiance is great.  Last year for Passover, all of the grocery stores around our apartment ran out of Matzah. Both South Loop Jewels, both Mariano's, Trader Joe's, and the small grocery stores up and down Michigan Avenue. My wife wanted to celebrate Passover and we were unable to find Matzah, except for the kindness of the people at Eleven City who sold us two huge boxes at their cost.",0.9828,0.782,0.218,0.0,0.4153039321789322
2014-09-08,3.0,"We usually stop in here for a meal or drink if we have time before the Bears games. It's an old-fashioned diner/bar/deli, with sandwiches where they pile on the meat, hand-sliced Nova lox bagels, and grilled Vienna beef hot dogs (served Chicago style of course).  It's kind of crowded and noisy, but that's what diners are usually like. Service has always been excellent whenever we've been there (although you can expect about a 15-minute wait for a table if it's busy). The host and the guy who handles take-out orders at the booth are especially attentive. They also have a small outdoor area where they'll serve you a drink while you wait for a table.  We once saw Jennifer Hudson and her entourage in here, so it seems like celebrities stop in every once in a while, too. The only drawback to Eleven is that it's located in a touristy area (when is the last time you saw a deli in the south Loop?), so prices are accordingly marked-up. On our last visit, two Bloody Marys cost us $25. On the good side, they were tall drinks, and they came loaded with so many celery sticks, olives, and cheese-and-salami skewers that we didn't need to eat any lunch that day!

The money we saved on parking fees was spent on really good food. Once inside, there isn't much room for people to stand and wait. The restaurant is nostalgic. It includes a candy store. It is narrow, congested, almost claustrophobic, noisy but fast-paced and friendly under pressure. Despite how busy they were, we were seated and served rather quickly. The portions of fresh meat they stuff between two slices of bread is mouthwatering and out of control generous. If I were to order one, I'd have a hard time finishing half a sandwich. I asked about their soup of the day. As soon as our server said it was vegetable with kale, I knew I had to have it. For a bowl of soup, it was delicious and filling, thanks to the amount of vegetables soaking and swimming in the warm broth.

Took us a good minute before we realized she put in an order for a root beer float instead and I was a bit confused because it was mostly ice cream and barely any root beer. Bf thought why not and took a few sips anyway but ended up not liking it, and at this point, it was already too late to ask the waitress to correct the order.  As for the food, we each ordered a soup and a melt. Bf had the tomato basil soup and said he could barely taste any basil. I had the matzo ball soup and the matzo ball was HUGE. It took up most of the bowl and was pretty good, but I didn't finish it for fear of getting too full before my main course arrived.

It basically looked like they buttered up some slices of toast and threw a bunch of turkey and cheese on it. I practically had to assemble the turkey melt myself and couldn't decide if I was supposed to eat the end product with my hands or with a knife and fork. I ended up doing a little bit of both because some parts of the bread were way too soggy to pick up. The parts that had sauce and cheese on it tasted good, but the turkey itself was pretty dry. The fries it came with were also just meh to me. It was too much food for me to finish so I packed some to bring home, though I was unsure if I would even want to eat it later. Prices also aren't cheap, but with the large portions and it's location, I guess it's understandable. Although the food wasn't BAD, nothing during my experience impressed me enough to warrant a return.",0.9577,0.819,0.112,0.069,0.5444700460829492

Dad ordered 2 Corned Beef Sandwiches, I added ""large ones"" to the order so the waitress (with braided pigtails)  nodded with acknowledgement. She repeated back the order after 2 more orders were given, then must have written the order down while walking away because she did not write it down while talking to us.. 12 15 minutes later, two rubens come out. We tell the guys that bring the order to us that we ordered corned beef sandwiches. They take them away. 10 minutes later 2 new rubens come out w/o cabbage... Really?..... REALLY? The waitress brought these over and I told her we told the 2 guys we ordered corned beef. ""YOU SAID RUBEN"" My dad, being polite said I apologize if I said that (even though he did not, he never orders that, every time it is corned beef.) YOU SAID 2 RUBENS, I WROTE IT DOWN. Dad, not wanting to get yelled at anymore by a stupid rude waitress said he would eat his, but the other needs to be a corned beef. It was for my brother, who can not have cheese. Another reason we would NEVER order rubens. About 6 minutes later a small corned beef sandwich comes out. Seriously. I think it was intentional that it was small, and not large. Also, rubens don't come in large. So I reeeealy do not understand how she messed that up. Many times. And yelled at us. Then proceeded to bitch to the manager/host right in front of us. He then came over after the, kind of, correct sandwich was brought out. And asked where the 4th person was. (We ordered so it would be ready when he joined us) We said he hadn't made it yet, but we'd take it to go if needed. This pleased him (I guess) because he was trying to rush us out.

2014-05-12,3.0,"Eleven CIty Diner is not so much a diner, as a restaurant branded to BE a diner.  From the clever graphic design of the menus, both on the wall and in your hands, to the branding of the placards on your table to the uniformity of the server's uniforms to the blues music emanating from the speakers, all the non-edible accoutrements are a bit too on point for this to be a neighborhood deli.  There is a massive marketing blitz here which makes you feel like you are at a high end Steak'n'Shake.  To paraphrase and rotate the Simpsons, this is not a deli, it's a faux-deli. So should the TGIF Deli vibe and its flair bar your patronage?  On the one hand, you are in the South Loop, so are chains all that surprising?  On the other hand, you just want some breakfast, and options for breakfast in the Sloop are thin. Fortunately, the breakfasts are superb.  I cannot recommend the breakfast sandwich enough.  TWO of bacon, sausage, or ham, three eggs, and a delicious cheddar cheese sauce with jalapenos - a great, great sandwich.  And the potato hash manages to be at once fluffy AND crispy.  Wash it down with the Bloody Mary. What impressed me the most, however, was that while I was eating breakfast I kept thinking of how much I wanted a burger - they just seemed like they would be good here - as well as fries and a giant chocolate shake.  And bourbon.  Lots of bourbon.  They have Weller and Bulliet, so I would not suffer from quality. So, should you eat here?  If you are in the South Loop, sure.  There are few other options, if Yelp is any indication, and you'll get stuffed here while drinking a spicy Bloody Mary.  If you'd rather have lunch order a burger and shake and bourbon; its your birthright as an American.  Get here early, though, the lines can be crazy.",0.9902,0.81,0.151,0.04,0.6121072796934866

So I traveled from the Gold Coast down to South Loop (I know right about 15 minutes) and the restaurant is walking distance from the Red line making it very convenience to hop back on the train should a sighting occur.  Eleven City diner is a Jewish family owned restaurant that has two locations. We were greeted by the mother of the owner and she was such a sweet lady. She pointed out I believe 3 or 4 jars full of change that lined the wall. She explained to us she presented the jar to her son upon the anniversary of each year they have been open. She fills the jars with loose change she finds around the restaurant and has always been able to fill the jar. After hearing that story I held tightly to the change in my purse and felt a little greedy afterwards  The service and the family atmosphere stood out to me most. Our visit here was on a Saturday around 11:00 and most of the patrons were there with kids. I ordered the Mexican Scramble and it was really good.

This made the breakfast go by fast because it was so entertaining. That or the food wasn't that memorable. Oh, and we couldn't get a drink before 10AM.

We both chose to go with sandwiches.  She went with the turkey melt, and I went with the french dip.  Portions are very plentiful, and both came with fries.  Huge plus - they serve intelligentsia coffee.  Food is a solid four stars. The key with this place is the atmosphere.  Definitely a 50's diner feel.  The atmosphere is fun and leaves you wanting to come back for me.  Five star atmosphere no doubt. This place is really just a good brunch spot.  Always a nice buzz.  My only negative is that they do not like to split the check more than two ways, which can be challenging with a group.  Still worth the visit, though!",0.7477,0.78,0.132,0.088,0.5

I went with the 11 City French Toast (fresh baked challah, strawberries, bananas & toasted coconut) and a side of link sausage. The our order was ready very quickly, like under 5 minutes (that might be an exaggeration, but I can say under 10 minutes is accurate). The 11 City French Toast was the BEST French toast I have ever had! There were plenty of strawberries and bananas. The toasted coconut was a very tasty addition. The serving was enough for two. The sausage was also very good! In fact, we ended up ordering another side of sausage before we left.  The service was fast! The food was delicious! The staff was very friendly and helpful!

The large front windows and high ceiling provide a lot of light (when Chicago's weather cooperates). The décor is retro in a pleasing way: framed vinyl records and vintage items all around. And the soundtrack makes everything all the more enjoyable. The breakfast menu has all the options you'd want from an ""old school"" diner, and the lunch menu is pretty extensive too. I particularly like the Challah bread French Toast with strawberries, bananas and toasted coconut; which, if you get another breakfast item, is big enough for two people to share. As expected, the coffee by local roaster Intelligentsia is great. There are many items, especially on the Soda Jerk menu, I always mean to try, but I never seem to get around to; perhaps in the future. The portions are generous and the price is perfectly reasonable considering the downtown Chicago location. Yes, as mentioned in other reviews, customer service is where Eleven City Diner has the most room for improvement. I've never seen anything uncouth from the owner or managers, but the service is frequently just short of great. If this were to change in the future, I'd be happy to add an extra star or two.

We understood the ""whole party must be there"" policy and were happy to wait  to get seated (at separate tables). This is a consequence of coming to a busy brunch restaurant on a Sunday morning. They told us it would be 35 minutes-- it was. And they let you sit outside with a bloody mary (yum!) I did really like my homefries. But the people working here were so, so rude (and we're from Boston-- we don't expect sugarcoated attitudes!) The host spoke condescendingly to our group and then I watched him bitch at one of the waitresses! I couldn't believe it-- not only was it odd that the guy was condescending to us, but he was also nasty to his staff (she asked him a question, and he said something like ""how am I supposed to know?"" in a nasty voice. Felt worse for her than for me). Our actual server was nice. One of the members of our party was a vegetarian and the server was patient and kind as she answered my friend's questions. The icing on the cake was AFTER brunch--I went to talk to one of the other tables to solidify our plans for the day. One of the girls-- I believe she was a hostess--- walked past me, and spoke to me in a bitchy way that I wish I could duplicate in this Yelp review (this wasn't even like she pulled me aside...it was SNIDE, like a teenager). This was complete with a glare and an eye-roll: ""I know you want to talk to your friends, but can you just get get out of the way?"" I'm not sure she even finished her sentence before I walked away. I was SO APPALLED by this attitude and service--- SO SO SO SO SO RUDE. It's fine if you need me to get out of the way, but how about a smile? Isn't this the Midwest? There are so many ways to politely tell me to finish it up (but...why? isn't this a restaurant?) There is absolutely no reason to talk to anyone with such disrespect ever-- no matter the circumstances. I complained to the guy who seemed like the manager, who tried to tell me I was in the wrong for being in the way. Um, hello?

I KNOW that I am not a jerk when I go in to this type of place...(I always look for the good in my experiences. seriously, just look at my other Yelp reviews!)

She puts us in this tiny corner spot when there were a couple other tables (for 4 people) but the restaurant was pretty empty since we got there around 9pm. We decided to move to one of the 4 seater tables since it was kind of claustrophobic in our corner.

The entire restaurant inside was empty, save one table. Outdoor tables were mostly filled, but we sat there eating til the restaurant closed and only had one other group of people come sit outside to dine. I understand if it was earlier in the day and there were more customers but she had no reason to be so snide with us. Our server, Teodoro, definitely made up for her awful service. He was friendly and attentive. I ordered the Rubin's Ruben, my friend got the Moshe Cristo, and we shared the latkes. The latkes order came with 2 old school and 2 new school style latkes. I really enjoyed both...they may be my fave latkes to date. Both our sandwiches were delish as well. I had the pomegranate ale which you definitely should share (like they suggest in the menu).

Getting drinks while we waited was also an awkward process- there is a small counter where you could order, but then we were all asked for our IDs. I can barely move at this point, but we produce them and eventually get handed drinks by servers running through yelling, ""hot soup!"" no matter what they were carrying. Yes, we know your place is kitchy, thanks. The waiting list is effectively and very efficiently run, and we are upstairs in the 70's loft area in no time.

2013-03-11,2.0,"I was visiting the city when this place originally opened back in 2006. We were in town for about ten days, so we dined here almost every morning. Why, other than it being close to our hotel? We saw its potential, the service was great and attentive, and the overall experience was one where it was easy to get the impression they valued their guests. I thought to myself back then that this place had the potential to be something special if it kept up its attentiveness. We visited about three years later, and much to our happiness, the place was still here and booming, and we loved it. Needless to say, I've been rooting for this place since its opening. Food was inventive and great, service was attentive and great, everything really stood out back then about this place. Now that we live here, particularly up in Lakeview, we had the chance to get down for brunch yesterday. My, how it's changed. First point is that when the server wants you out of there, she wants you out of there. Our server, Tiffany P., was ample, but when we had finished, it's like a timer had gone off and we needed to get our bill paid and be bungee-shot from our seats. For the record, we were seated at 10:40 and paid our bill at 11:36, and, as all four of us at the table worked at some point in the service industry, we understand the value of turning tables, but what we experienced was just downright rude. They apparently employ some older gentleman whose job is nothing more than to remove setups and glasses from seated tables when the server wants to try to send the message to the table that they ""gotta go."" While our food arrived quickly, we were not lingering; if we had been there for 30 minutes after we finished, perhaps I could understand their frustration, but we were there less than an hour, so make the guests feel welcome, folks. It might even increase your tip. The food here has changed as well. Four years ago I got the hash and it was phenomenal. I asked Tiffany about it this time and she said again that it was ""great."" Um, no. It looked like canned wet cat food and tasted somewhat like Hormel. If they have changed the recipe, they need to go back. I ate it, because we didn't see Tiffany P. at our table until our plates were empty, at which point she grabbed the plates and dropped our check, a maneuver to which she made no indication, because when we finally saw it, we were like ""oh, here's the check."" (Another note: if you let your table know the check is there, especially if they are conversing among themselves, perhaps they will pay quicker next time, Tiff.) I had a bloody mary, and despite the indications that they were spicy, I wasn't impressed, and neither was another member of my party who also ordered one. (I like spicy, he does not, so when both ends of the spectrum think it's bland, that's probably an indication.) My husband had an orange juice, or I should call it a shot of orange juice for the size of the gulp glass in which it was served (probably about 4 ounces, max.)  While the food did arrive promptly, everyone at the table thought it was mediocre at best, probably worth about three stars, but the rudeness of the service and the table police dropped the overall experience. What sets a dining experience apart often can be the server, like I've said in previous reviews where the food is not the best but the server acts like she's genuinely glad you're there and not just another fistful of dollar bills. For what's it worth, the experience around the corner at Yolk is better. They're just as busy, but they don't rush you. Perhaps Eleven has lost sight of what made it so popular initially. That is really sad, because I really have wanted to like this place and be proud of it. I once was. I can't say that now.",0.9953,0.829,0.124,0.046,0.49430183531746036

Came here in the middle of the summer on a rainy day.  It was an odd hour for lunch (I think it was around 2PM?), so there was no line and we pretty much had the place to ourselves. It's a big, New York-style kosher deli, and beats the hell out of what I have available back home.  I was really hungry from schlepping around the streets all day with the kids, so I went a little out of control. I started off with the Wisconsin Cheddar Cheese fries, easily the best cheese fries I've ever had.  The fries were perfect and fresh, and the cheese sauce... I didn't know whether or not to eat it or rub it on my body.  It was so good, and I could feel my arteries clogging with each yummy bite. Also, on the scale of going a little crazy, I chose a draft beer and a chocolate malt.  Because this is America, and I can.  Great chocolate malt, didn't even have to tell them I wanted it with vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup, they already knew! For my entree, I went with the ""Number 24"", the most decadent sandwich humanity has ever conceived.  A corned beef and pastrami sandwich with chopped liver as a condiment (that really happened) and swiss cheese.  I couldn't eat enough of that sandwich.  I considered leaving my wife and kids for that sandwich.  I started to lose sensation in my extremities while I was eating that sandwich.  When I woke up from my daze, everyone was just sort of staring at me. Really vast menu, lots to choose from for both deli, lunch, etc.  And they serve beer and liquor.  If I lived near this joint, I'd probably weigh 500 pounds.",0.965,0.83,0.115,0.056,0.5036616161616162

Others ordered an omelet with lox, lox platter, another type of omelet, and matzo ball soup. We had a plate of corned beef hash for the table to share. My latke was more like a mashed potato cake vs coarse grated potato which threw me off. Plus it was dry. I would try something else next time. Their Bloody Mary is good - very spicy.

If they knocked a couple of dollars off each item, it'd be three stars here, but in truth, the prices are too high for what you get. A BLT with two small, paper thin  slices of not especially good bacon is $8.50. An omelette with any meat, potatoes and toast comes in at over $12.  The hot dog with fries is more than $9.

The most recent breakfast...we were speaking to one of the owner's parents - impressed that that individual is out on the floor on a Sunday morning. If I want to nitpick, one hostess was a little snarky so that blemishes an otherwise perfect memory of all visits here.

On the plus side, it's one of the coolest & most comfortable dining establishments in our 'hood. The servers are consistently pleasant & hard-working, and the food's delicious. With regard to areas of improvement, the kitchen has accidentally included toppings on my sandwich that I did not order in about 1/3 of my visits.

For example, I requested no tomatoes on my turkey burger last night, and they accidentally included tomatoes anyway. I've never had to return any of the dishes, but I don't like to see a business wasting food during times like these.

The menu didn't appear to have anything out of the ordinary. It was the usual breakfast dishes from pancakes to waffles as well as burgers and sandwiches.  We ordered the fresh squeezed orange juice, Eleven City Diner French toast, Belgian waffles, and Reuben sandwich.  The French toast was superb. I especially liked how it was toasted challah and not just some white or wheat bread. It was also topped with strawberries, bananas, and toasted coconut. ECD is very generous with the fruit toppings compared to most places. That's a definite plus! The waffle, on the other hand, was forgettable. It was also generously topped with bananas and pecans but nothing particular to bring home about. I didn't get a chance to try the Reuben but it looked devilishly good.

Now the good news. The food is great, and breakfast is served all day.   I ordered the Eleven City Diner French toast, made from challah bread, with strawberries, bananas, and toasted coconut.  It was delicious, and I didn't even use the syrup; it was unnecessary with all that sweet goodness.  My friend ordered the corned beef & pastrami hash.  The hash was about 80% meat and  the best hash I've ever tasted in a restaurant.  We also split a side order of the apple & gouda sausage. Another excellent choice...not too fatty, nice oozing cheese,  with the richness tempered by the apple.   They have phosphates, egg creams,  and Green River floats!  Unfortunately, I didn't order these but if I ever go back to this place, I may skip dinner and order dessert first.

Well, I clearly hear the message and I will simplify your problem by taking my business elsewhere. I only patronized Eleven City because it is a short walk.  The food is ""just ok"" - not great and the prices are expensive for the average food you get.  The cutesie decorations don't make up for what we really want - great food and good service. If you want the best corned beef, pastrami, chicken soup, latkes, you go to Manny's - hands down (6-7 blocks west). If you want burgers, sandwiches, salads - why would you go to Eleven City? There are so many better choices. Some other reviewer said the owner has a business to run and ""it's got to be tough.""  Well Brad... business is a lot tougher when customers think you and the atmosphere you're offering are distasteful.  I am not alone in my opinion, similar reviews are plentiful here.

2012-08-24,4.0,"Once again, I'm guilty of visiting a place because of Food Network. I heard about how great the French toast is here via Food Network and Yelp (of course). I'm typically not a huge fan of French toast, but since my hotel was only a few blocks away I had to try it out for myself. My love for eggs couldn't keep from ordering an egg dish... so I ordered a Frittata along with a half-order of their popular Challah Bread French Toast. The frittata was quite good, though a bit underseasoned. It had asparagus, ham, and swiss cheese. The eggs were light and the asparagus was crisp while the ham added a subtle smokiness and cheese just makes everything great. I could have done without the side of potatoes that came with the frittata. They were bland and did not have crispy edges. They were more like boiled potatoes. Only one word can describe the Challah Bread French Toast... FOOD-GASM! I'm often unimpressed with french toast, but this was unlike any I've ever had and I have no doubts that it has everything to do with the bread they use -- Thick cut slices of challah bread fried, a nice crispiness from the griddle while simultaneously super soft and airy. It was loaded with fresh strawberries and bananas and topped liberally with perfectly toasted coconut bits. Naturally, the warm syrup brought everything together like an artist finishing a masterpiece. Overall, it was a great dining experience with excellent service and awesome food. I look forward to the next time I'm in Chicago to try out some more of their house favorites.

2012-08-10,3.0,"My friend and I went to Eleven City after looking at their menu online. They had some great reviews so that helped tip us toward them. We went inside, gave the host our name and waited for our name to be called. After about a 15 minute wait, my friend wanted something to drink. She stood at the deli/bar and waited for someone to acknowledge her. It didn't happen. She flagged down a manager and the manager was rude. She was more interested in telling my friend that she was standing in the wrong place for a drink rather than helping her get a drink. The drink was obtained but we felt the attitude of the manager was uncalled for. We stuck around though. We had already waited this long and all the other restaurants along this street were busy as well. Finally, our name was called after about a 40 minute wait (which is the amount of time the host said we would wait). We were about to go inside the non-revolving door, which a manager was sticking out of. The manager barked at us to go to the revolving door. It was totally uncalled for. My friend came inside and asked the hosts why the managers at Eleven City were so rude. He asked which managers in question were rude. Rather than handling our complaint, he said, ""That's just diner culture."" I beg to differ. When I think diner, I think friendly staff. On to the food: the food was great. I ordered pancakes and ""The Tower."" My friend ordered the protein scramble. The pancakes were delicious and The Tower was as well.

2012-08-06,1.0,"My experience here was terrible. I paid a lot of money (a bit over $30 after tip) for a crappy dinner for one, and the service was terrible. Here's a bit of the back story that led up to this fiasco of a meal: I had waited a bit too long to eat, and I was famished. I went to a place near my apartment, only to find that it was closed, ditto with my second choice. I hopped on the el and got off at Roosevelt, assuming that I would easily find something decent nearby. The first place I found that was open was Eleven City Diner, so I went for it. I vaguely remembered that I had had an unsuccessful dining experience there some years back, but by that point I was feeling the effects of low blood sugar, and I wasn't picky. I walked in and said ""Dinner for one,"" and I immediately regretted choosing this place. The hostess gave me that look that I hate, ""Oh, dinner for one? We're not going to make much off you at all, so don't even think about taking up a whole table."" She took me to the counter. Truth is, I'm not a big fan of eating at counters, but, whatever, fine. I was more interested in getting food in me than comfortable seating. At some places, counter seating is perfectly respectable. This is not one of those places. There didn't seem to be anyone assigned to the counter, and there was confusion over who was going to serve me. Initially a young waitress came over and took my drink order (a soda). And then I waited for over ten minutes for that soda as I watched her run around taking orders from -- and food to -- her other tables. Being a little snippy by that point, I called over a male server and asked about my drink. He brought my drink and, seeing that my waitress wasn't really interested in waiting on a single diner, took my order. I re-ordered that soda, the chili cheese fries, and the ""devil chicken."" Synopsis: The soda was a brand I will make sure to avoid going forward (Faygo). The chili cheese fries were the lamest possible interpretation of that item. The fries had that ""right out of a big bag in the walk-in freezer"" taste, the cheese sauce was the crappy day-glo orange that 7-11 puts on nachos, and the chili was one stingy ladle of thin, weak chili (which I would guess came out of an industrial-sized steel can). For that alone I paid $8.00. I think a fair price for that interpretation of that dish would be more like $4.00 or $5.00 if you really want to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt. I wish I'd known that before I'd ordered. But it gets... I won't say better.  It gets more horrible. They bring the devil chicken, which turns out to be a dry, leathery piece of ""spicy"" (not) Buffalo chicken on a plain bun. Okay, seriously, I don't think it said anywhere that the devil chicken was a sandwich, but I'm not willing to say that for certain or hold them accountable for what might have been my inattention to detail. That being said, that sandwich was horrible. I seriously thought about just leaving after my first two bites because it really was THAT bad. I choked the nasty sandwich down with the aid of an overpriced glass of orange juice. Meanwhile, on the other side of the counter, the wait staff were doing dishes and entering orders into a computer and swearing under their breath like they were all pissed off about something. Remember that thing I said about some counter service being good?  Yeah, this is why the counter service here sucks: The staff use the counter as a work area, so when people sit at the counter, it messes up their routine.  I refused to make eye contact with my first waitress, because I was pissed at her for never bringing my drink, but about half way through my meal she came over and tried to make half-assed small talk about the book I was reading. My interpretation of what she was really saying, ""I know I totally forgot to bring you your drink, and I have a bit of an attitude, but I'm cute, so if I chat you up about something I'm clearly not really interested in you'll  get over it and go away happy."" My silent response: ""Don't bet the farm on it, honey."" So, yeah, wow. I will never go to this place again. If a group of my friends tries to go here, I will enthusiastically try to talk them out of it, and if they insist, I will dine elsewhere and meet up with them later. There are enough good restaurants out there that I don't need to give my money to places like Eleven City Diner where unprofessional servers serve bad food and charge you through the nose for it.

We couldn't even see anything of the restaurant except for the employees eating at the next two tables and the people bringing food back. It sucked. I asked if we could be moved into the regular dining area and after our waitress checked with someone we were - hurray! As I thanked the girl she said something like, ""Well, I'm not your waitress so talk to her."" Ok. Now sitting at a great table in the center of the place I was happy again. No clanging sounds or confined seating so excellent. My husband orded the tuna fish and it was pretty gross. My corned beef was pretty dry. I did enjoy my pickes. I did not find the meal worth $40 at all. I've been stuffing my face at Bat 17 in Evanston for a year now so I may be spoiled when it comes to amazing sandwiches. I actually felt bad that I picked the place when there are so many other options. Our second waitress was very friendly but I can think of no reason I would ever return.",0.9926,0.725,0.205,0.07,0.46561965811965805

First, 4 out of 5 people had arrived, but we were not allowed to get a table before the last person had arrived and had to sit at the bar. Second, the waitress asked me if I wanted a second glass of red wine and I said yes. When she returned, I still had a bit left in my first glass that I wanted to finish and she asked me(have 4 friends to confirm this): ""Can you fast drink it?""... I asked why I would want to ""fast drink"" red wine. She responded that she had gotten strict comments before from management to not provide a second glass before the first was finished. She had me pour what was left from my old glass in my new glass of wine...Tip for the diner: 1: Loosen up with not seating incomplete parties. Should 4 adults really have to be treated like that when they are waiting for one person?! Second: Let your guest finish their drink in their own time, do not ask them to shove it down in one go because you can't wait to bring the second drink.",0.9147,0.889,0.088,0.023,0.27125420875420875

When we went for lunch, there were only a handful of other diners there. So it was a little surprising when it took our waitress a long time to come to our table. She took our drink order and then disappeared for another long while before returning with them and taking our food order.  We both got the turkey melt and it was so delicious. Waitress never came back to refill our glasses, though.  The service on our second trip there was a little bit better (we had a different waitress) and they were slammed on Friday morning with the breakfast crowd. There was a bit of wait, but they seemed to be getting tables cleared and patrons seated quickly.  I got the deli scramble and potatoes. Once again, a massive portion of absolutely delicious food. My friend got the pancakes, I tasted them and they were also delicious.  This time the owner was there, running around barking orders at everyone. We were seated right next to the kitchen and his rudeness towards his staff made us feel a little bit uncomfortable.  One perk of sitting next to the kitchen was getting to watch the food being made.

He (I kid you not) took the car seat with the sleeping baby out of my hand and proceeded to shove it into the booth and then looked at me and said ""there.  it fits.""  That was almost enough for me not to come back.  But then when we did, he was  nice again.   I want to see this place do well because of its location and cool concept (diner/deli), but that Brad dude has to get his act under control.",0.9496,0.868,0.1,0.032,0.5381720430107526

2012-05-13,5.0,"Eleven City Diner is AWESOME. My bf and I stopped in here for a little Saturday breakfast while we were in town, and I have to say that it was my favorite restaurant of the trip. We arrived a bit early, so we certainly beat the crowds and sat right down at the bar.  The bar was the place to sit - there was tons of action. We were lucky enough to have not only sat next to some fun guys who came straight from the bar the night before to breakfast, but we also were being served by the owner. He has quite the potty mouth, but we loved every minute of it and he certainly livened things up.  We didn't order any bloody mary's, which is apparently a specialty there, but they most certainly looked delicious. My bf ordered a corned beef hash with eggs plate, I ordered the deli scramble and we both shared a side of latkes. Both the hash and the scramble were made from the previous day's corned beef and pastrami cuts, which is unreal. I think I would have been totally satisfied with just the latkes, although everything was really good. The side of latkes comes with one ""traditional"" preparation and one ""new age"" preparation. Both were fabulous.  This is the only place I've ever been to where you can order a free side of guilt. The menu says it, so it must be true.

The decor is so nineteen fifties, which is pretty neato in my book. The hostess sat me down at the counter since I was eating alone. The waitress promptly greeted me at there with a menu and asked me if I had ever been. When I said no I haven't she let me know that all the deli meats where cured in house, that the burgers were from Angus steak that was ground in house, and all the soups were home made and made fresh daily, that they serve breakfast all day, and that they have in house soda jerk for their shakes and ice creams. Pretty rad if I do say so myself.  She asked me what I would like to drink which was a diet Pepsi, and left me for a moment to look over the pretty big menu. I spot the soup I wanted, which was actually all I planned to order, but then I saw the patty melt in the burger section. I hadn't had a good patty melt in a very long time, and after being told that their meat was ground in house, I decided that I must try one.  When she came back I placed my order and didn't have to wait long before I had a big bowl of matzo ball soup in front of me. Which after a few bites my Patty melt had also arrived. My soup really hit the spot. The flavor was spot on for a really great home made chicken soup. The matzo ball was huge and just the right texture. Not too dense and not so mushy that it melted in the soup. It was what I had been having a random taste for. The patty male was huge. The patty was a good thickness and it was done to a really nice medium. The meat was juicy and the texture of it was a tiny bit chewy but not in a bad way. The meat still had some of it's integrity to it, like it tasted steaky if that makes sense. It was oozing with the perfect amount of cheese and a heap of grilled onion on perfectly toasted rye bread.

One member of our party ordered one of their signature Bloody Marys that came with all the accompaniments and zest that a truly well-made Bloody Mary should have. They loved it and said it was absolutely delicious. They do have a full-service bar, complete with on-tap Schlitz, which was full of Schlitzy goodness.  The food was remarkable. The Reuben was piled high (all of their deli and melts were served that way), tender and juicy. As was the turkey, the ""Springer"" (corned beef & pastrami), and the ""Schwartzy"" (beef brisket). You can tell they smoke their own meat as the tenderness and flavor almost burst out of the bread it's served on.  For dessert,  a banana split that was more than enough for the two 9 year olds had fresh banana and three generous scoops of vanilla, chocolate and mint ice cream. The three-layered Red Velvet cake with cream cheese frosting was amazing as well; moist with the ideal level of sweetness.

Going to the restaurant on a Friday morning, while most people were at work, was great - from the food I can tell there would be a very long wait on the weekends.    For my meal I ordered the challah french toast with bananas and pecans with a side of pastrami and corned beef hash.   The french toast was delicious - light and fluffy, with fresh topping - yum.  But the hash - incredible!!!!  You can tell that the meat is prepared in house - the flavors and the texture was perfect.  My three friends that dined with me agreed.    In addition to the food, I tasted the Bloody Mary that my friend ordered - so fresh and flavorful, really good.

No problem there, but it did bother me when they came around several times table to table asking us to buy cookies.

2012-02-15,1.0,"I've been to Eleven many many many times before, and never had a problem with the service, nor the food. Unfortunately, there was a situation that occurred on Grammy night, when my friend and I were at a booth, eating and drinking, and without any context or considerable reason, we were asked to leave the booth, because we had exceeded our 2 hour booth limit. To my discovery, thanks to a corresponding manager (Josh), there's no such rule.  Some guy eyeballs me while we're eating, like he's going to assault me, then makes his way over to my table, and says to us, 'you guys should come over to the bar and get some cake'. No introduction of who he was or anything. Turns out it was the owner. I guess because we weren't moving fast enough, his minion manager, Damen, comes over and starts to 'kindly' muscle us out of the booth, so another party can have it. There were plenty of empty tables/seats around, but it was confirmed by some of the wait staff that the owner has V.I.P seating for his friends, and we were in the V.I.P booth for the owner's friends. Um, go figure.  Instead of us leaving the restaurant, I decided to actually sit at the bar, and inquire every customer/staff about their '2 Hour Booth Policy', which turns out to be a stone-cold lie. They take our money, then kick us out the booth, without any rationale or context, which therefore just feels like discrimination, like we're not good enough to finish our drinks we purchased at the same table we just ate food at. We were not at the booth for 2 Hours by the way.  Our server (Kristina) was incredible, and is the only reason you should even consider going through the revolving door. Her 'table-side manner' was most reassuring during a time when our consumer frustration was at an all-time high. Whitney and Maggie (although not our servers) were extremely nice and hospitable; it's just unfortunate that the experience is trampled by the crass nature of a greedy owner that does not introduce himself to customers, and forces them to leave, essentially kicking them out.  Whenever someone on the staff says, ""Go to Yelp...the owner does it all the time"", then you know what kind of business you're dealing with.

Our server was a little iffy which almost made me give this only 3 stars but the hash was really that good.  Also, we saw a waitress and one of the managers kissing and doing some mild groping, that was offputting.  Keep it professional, kids.  Grope on your own time, I'm trying to enjoy my hash here.",0.9704,0.793,0.166,0.042,0.6157407407407408

The prices at this diner are outrageous.  Omelets are 10-12$, my french toast was $8, sausage $4.15.  If it were killer food, I would have no problem.  But it is average.  Pedestrian.  Bland.  Over-priced.

We had a big party and my friends had saved a space for me (I was going to be late because of work and they knew that). The hostess that greeted me said she couldn't seat me because of their ""NO JOINING"" policy. So, there I stood with no way of meeting my wife who was already seated. A manager heard what was going on and came over. He said that was their policy, but he would allow me to sit with my group ""if there was room"" (the place was nearly empty in the upstairs section). I said I've never heard of such a policy to which he replied that ALL restaurants in the loop have the policy. Bullshit. I grew up here and have been to MANY restaurants in the loop area and NONE of them have such a stupid policy. We were all at Yolk last week and didn't get hit with any such policy. I got seated and started telling my friends at the table what transpired (they were shocked). The manager stood there and basically told me to shut-up (""Stop making a big deal out of this because we did seat you""). Doesn't matter, you still made a guest feel unwelcome and uncomfortable. All 15 of us now know how this places operates and will take our business somewhere friendlier. Despite what they want to advertise, this place has lost its 'family' atmosphere it had years back.

2012-02-04,2.0,"College diner food in a Texas-sized hall with the tackiness and impersonality of Potbelly's... all at Manhattan prices. The menu clearly states a mission of being a casual, family neighborhood diner, ""what family dining rooms used to be."" It felt more like a parody of that. Nothing says ""cheapskates"" like a $4.50 Schlitz. Except maybe $6.75 for Bell's Amber (really, you need that extra quarter for your laundry?), or apple pie a la mode for $7.15. Surprisingly unbohemian prices, considering it's next door to a Columbia College facility. To be fair, my food was fairly decent. Deli meats are roasted in house, and my turkey burger was freshly ground and served with not-too-greasy thick-cut fries. If I hadn't just read an article earlier in the day with a headline something like ""Sugar is the New Tobacco, Scientists Say"" I might also have sampled some specialties from the interesting soda fountain, featuring the likes of egg cream and phosphates (""an ester of phosphoric acid,"" thanks Wiki!). I suspect my waitress was really an actress, playing the role of a waitress who doesn't hate her job. She was actually pretty sweet, and played the role well enough that I'm not sure. No criticism there, and I tipped well to help her get on with her acting career. I'm really digging here, but as a family-friendly joint, another plus would be that the high ceilings increase the range of arcs available for toddler projectile food fights. But with all the staff uniforms and custom printed signs, cheesy jazz covers (sorry Duke, that she had to act so happy about missing the Saturday dance), this feels like an institution that understands profit, but not people. It's an independent restaurant that manages to feel like a chain, with a mission that lends false hope for tasteful Woody Allen soundtrack jazz and a chalkboard with the day's specials. My conspiracy theory of the day is that this is phase one of a citywide replication.

I had the lox scramble which comes with potatoes and a bagel for $10.99. I swapped out the potatoes for tomato slices -  I was warned by our waitress: They were going to hit me with an up charge of 99 cents which was really was unnecessary for FOUR SLICES of Tomato since I did not add them I swapped them. That was a minus - a #FAIL. Who does an up-charge for half a tomato. (#Upchargesleaveabadtasteinmymouth.) I said okay, with my tail between my legs. The Bloody Marys looked wonderful. I'm not a BM lady but my friends downed them and said they were great. The BMs at 11City are really dressed up and pretty/ Each one is garnished with salami and cheese as well as a celery stick and cute little flag. Another friend had a Mimosa. I think she liked hers as well. Glass emptied quickly! Also at our table was the world's fluffiest omelet ordered by the BDG (Birthday Girl). It was stuffed to the hilt! She slammed it and the potatoes. Toast came with it as well. Not sure of its contents but all the omelets on the over sized menu read like a gourmet list. Another friend had the Frittata. Nice and cheesy and super flat. Looked great too! Potatoes and 2 slices of toast with hers as well.... this is officially being called the combo side in my reviews from now on. Combo side = Potatoes and Toasted Bread. The chicken broccoli egg white protein scramble also looked d'lish and was raved over by its recipient! And of coarse the plate was stacked full with the combo side. The service was standard for a diner however they did give us a bonus (complimentary) serving of French Toast (Marvelously dressed up with bananas, strawberries and coconut!!!) which we munched on as an appetizer pre-brunch.  The service post the French toast was okay. Wish we had a little bit more water and more attention... I think that is hard to find these days. So service was standard not bad but nothing to gush about.... I like to gush.  Atmosphere is casual and clean. Management was helpful and courteous. They don't do reservations but they kindly let us take a table so that we could surprise our friend when she arrived. Also- We loved the French Toast - nice gesture!!! Thank you!!! Will I return?

2011-08-25,2.0,"The restaurant tries to mimic an old style New York deli and in several ways it comes close and in many others, all related to the food, misses by a wide mark. The service is freindly and efficient, absolutely no complaints there. The food on the otherhand is a mized bag of very good to awful.  The corned beef and pastrami are of high quality, lean and very flavorful. The deli uses excellent rye bread which is very important to a corned beed sandwich. The sides are generally good, I thought the coleslaw was better than average. The soups are another matter. I judge a Jewish style delit by how well they do the sweet and sour cabbage soup. It is tough to find the right balance between the two. Eleven failed here. The cabbage soup was deadful, much too much vinegar. Don't know if they have a bad recipe or bad execution but it stunk. Ditto on the tomato basil which was too heavy with basil, no subtely of flavor at all. The same goes for their potato latke. It was mealy, dry and flavorless. It seemed as if they used too much flour and not enough potato, substituted potato starch for some potato, or worst of all used a packaged mix. Regardless, it may have been the worst Latke I've had in several years.A latke should have the taste of potato dominate, this didn't.  A huge disappointment.

FOOD I don't know what drove me to order the Schwartzy, as it's nothing too exciting, just some beef brisket but MY GOD! It was the best sandwich I've ever had and weep for it often! It is SO good.  The menu says it's the sandwich you'll never forget and they are not kidding! So juicy! So tender! So simple yet so delicious!  I also split the (huge) Jeff Garlin's Veggie Cobb salad with a friend.  It was beautiful!  Huge leaf lettuce, fresh veggies, very straightforward salad here people.  It was delicous and felt healthy and satisfying. DRINK I forget what it was called but it was a giant bloody mary in a mason jar with a sidecar of modelo!  YES PLEASE!

An hour later waiting for a seat, did not help especially when breakfast was in the air.  As I was walking towards my seat, a weird feeling of going back into time hit me. I felt like a little kid again, glaring at all the candy in little jars lined up along the window. The entire decor was old school, chairs were a faint yellow that swiveled, how awesome was that. Sat down and without looking at the menu - ordered the corn beef & pastrami hash and bottom-less coffee. . My partner in crime ordered the turkey sliders in the appetizer section.  Unfortunately, I saw bottom in my coffee cup and had to ask a few times to cover the bottom up. The turkey sliders came up first, three gorgeous looking sliders sitting next to each other. I tried one and OMG, it was the most delicious slider I ever ate. It was so juicy and full of flavor (without and condiments), every bite was a memorable and I was hoping that it will never end, but it did after three bites. Then my corn beef hash arrived and as I was eating my dish, I could not stop thinking about the turkey sliders, I wanted more and for a second I wanted to return the hash for another order of the sliders.  The service was mediocre only because I kept seeing the bottom of my coffee cup and the corn beef has was decent but the sliders, the only words that I can say is ""turkey slider-licious"".

Would be easily worthy of five stars if not or the fact that you'll easily drop 30$ on a couple of sandwiches without drinks. All around the food  and the service is great.

2011-07-19,5.0,"*HEART* I can now say that I have a heart-on for this place.  I am a born and bred east coast girl, and damn proud of it too. My darling is a corn fed Midwest boy, so Chi-town is where we fly into to visit his family. Something we did for the 4th of July. We flew into Midway, switched to the orange line, we then got off at a stop that might have been Roosevelt (I don't really remember) and had to catch the South Shore train. We had about an hour to kill before it showed up though, so we parked ourselves at this place. It was just what we needed after being in airports for hours.  The hostess was super nice and helpful. We came slogging in their revolving door with bags and suitcases, and she just looked at us, smiled, and asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside. We chose outside. She then said that, if we didn't want to carry our bags and suitcases back outside and have them cluttered at our feet, she could store them behind the counter and we could get them when we were finished. AWESOME. We took her up on this offer and then found a lovely little seat outside.  A note on their outdoor seating, it is really comfortable. They have the seats that are like plastic wicker, but the kind of plastic wicker that you do not stick to if it is hot outside. Yay!  Once we had menus in hand we were like deer in headlights; frozen with the options. Seriously, if you want choices, this is your place. They have the kitschy named sandwiches, such as: The ""Springer"", Number#24, The Blank Blank Special, and the all too cleaver Turkey Club. There is also an amazing selection of salads: the Encantado!, the Stuffed Tomato, the Jeff Garlin's veggie cobb, and of course the Tomato Mozza salad that they claim has ""Beautiful"" tomatoes (no ugly fruits for them!). You can also get breakfast all day, just like any other diner, but you can't get the ""Tom Waits 2 AM. breakfast 1987"" in any other diner! Actually you probably can, it just won't be called that, and really everyone knows that the name makes it taste better (Science Fact!). There are a ton an a half more choices, but I am not going to list them here. If you want to know all the choices then you should go there, or at the very least check out their website. That said, onward to the end of the review!  Our poor little hipster waiter had to come back three times before we actually had our order ready for him. He took it all in stride, even apologized for lacking the proper attention for us. Silly really, we thought it was just the right amount of time. The boy ordered a Green River float and hash. I had the tuna melt with fries. Their tuna melt comes on top of an English muffin that was toasted with butter on a flat top. I know you're jealous right now, and also drooling, you should stop. Their hash comes with ""hot ketchup"", we thought temperature hot. We were wrong, it was spicy hot, and delicious. While we were waiting for our food the boy enjoyed his Green River float. He also tried to convince me that it was the Chicago version of a Lime Rickey. I am still unconvinced. It wasn't bad though, definitely worth a try.  All-in-all this place is great and I would gladly go back again. The people were really friendly and helpful and not in a saccharine way. The prices were good for the food that you were getting.

It really took advantage of its building and location to create the old diner feel. The food was pretty good, not great, but enjoyable. I had the turkey club, which had big, thick pieces of turkey. My wife got a cheeseburger and a chocolate malt, both of which she enjoyed. Jennifer Hudson and her WWE boyfriend walked in while we were waiting and got to skip past all of us waiting outside, but I guess that is to be expected.

It was not enormous and not sloppy/greasy, so I did manage to finish it off in one sitting.

2011-07-06,2.0,"I have such a love/hate relationship with Eleven City Diner.  It's got pretty standard greasy breakfast food with a lot of Jewish Deli flare which, let's admit, fits the bill on a Saturday or Sunday morning.    I love the 50s vibe of the place and the scrambled egg/pesto/feta dish - YUM!  I do NOT love the owner.  I've had my own run-in with the guy where he tried to kick me and a group of 3 other girls out of our table before we even GOT the check... Ummm... did you WANT us to dine and ditch???  He tried to cover it up by offering us ice cream... where we could stand while we ate it... at 10 in the morning.... HA!  We seriously had to fight to stay and only did so because our poor server was great and deserved to be PAID!  I've seen multiple other run-ins with the guy mostly related to his rudeness, temper, and lack of social skills.  He nearly has a coronary dealing with customers and I've seen him berate his staff on multiple occasions... There's been a constant For Hire sign in the window for about 2 years now because they have such high staff turn over.  If you're looking for entertaining reading, look at all the 1-2 star reviews of this place.  They hit the nail on the head when describing Eleven City but I'll let you discover their own descriptions of what they've seen here.   PS - Those ""reservations"" are complete BS.  I've been seated at reserved tables before on completely empty days and stood on a Sunday staring at empty reserved tables while 15-20 people cram into the waiting area... they don't even TAKE reservations!   Oh!  I would say it's not a good place for kids.  Their very presence (especially if accompanied by a stroller) seems to be an affront to ""some"" people.... ;) Summary: Decent food, good decor, The movie Anger Management shown in real life.",-0.8946,0.858,0.057,0.085,0.5139215686274511
2011-07-06,2.0,"They are not giving anything away here that is for sure, however what you get at Eleven is exactly what you pay for-- the decor is artfully chosen, trying to create a classic New York delicatessen with a modern touch.   The food, as far Jewish choices go, is really well made. Good cake I might add. If you want a massive corned beef sandwich and care about nothing else, of course you should arealdy know that is at Manny's-- so go there.  I do.  But, when it comes to ambiance, Eleven really delivers. That said, you are going to pay for the establishment's decor on your tab.  Nothing comes for free with the meal, right down to extra pickles (seriously... you will pay extra per condiment).  The owner, who is hard to miss, is an aggressive restaurateur, quite a bit preoccupied on being recognized (uncomfortably fashionable by my standards).   Defining moment: Went in once, a bit rough around the edges with my brother and girlfriend and sat at the counter when it was packed [mind you, multiple visits I was told that the counter is outside of the wait-list, even by the owner himself] planning to drop some money on salmon and bloodies (which are bottled Twisted Spoke variety).  After complaints from some awfully well-dressed people who wanted to sit there but didn't know the protocol, we were promptly ejected from our seats and put on an hour waiting list by the friendly but clearly inconsistent management. We opted for the short walk to Zapa instead of being treated like second-rate citizens. Frankly, the food is too expensive for what you get and although they are always working their tails off in the place, I still leave less than impressed and still a bit hungry.",0.9583,0.863,0.093,0.044,0.4831012506012506

The last time we went, they were making fresh kreplach from scratch, so the Ju Pu Platter (which I ordered), took a bit longer than everyone else's food.  I couldn't have cared less, I was enjoying the company I was with and was in no hurry, and since they said it was taking longer because they were making fresh kreplach, I was happy with that.  But then they even gave me a bowl of homemade chicken noodle soup while I waited!  It was unnecessary, since I wasn't even that hungry and then was barely able to eat my kreplach, but the gesture was what made me leave happy. I only remove a star because it does seem a bit expensive for what it is and because they're always so busy, you're never able to get excellent service.  Not too much of an issue, as they seem to realize that, and the management staff seems to help out the waitstaff when they're in the weeds.  However, to charge the price they do for glorified diner food does require a little more attention from your server.  When they're charging diner prices for diner food, they are totally justified in turning and burning the tables, but until then...",0.9946,0.772,0.195,0.033,0.5800766283524903

It consisted of two huuge hard shell taco filled with a blend of scrambled eggs, chorizo, melted jack cheese (which there was a lot of to my delight), scallions, some hot salsa on top.  Served with some homestyle breakfast potatoes, I don't know how else to describe them, but they were pretty darn good.  My bf got the Belgian waffles, which are also ginormous, with whipped cream and fresh berries--also amazing.  Big portion sizes at Eleven so come hungry!

Feeling bad about such a small order, we all decided to get drinks so that the bill would be bigger but this must have pissed the waitress off even more because she brought me my cheesecake to go well before we were supposed to leave (so of course it got warm), served us the smallest slice of the red velvet cake, and then proceeded to ignore us until she delivered the check which after we had paid, had then been short changed. I figured maybe she had rent that was late and was hoping for more tips so I gave her 15% but she didn't even deserve that. I will not go back or recommend this place if this is how their servers are going to act.",-0.8248,0.846,0.067,0.087,0.4659090909090909

The unusual mix of antiques, vintage-inspired design, and Judaica somehow pull together and work as a unique decor. I was in the neighborhood, walking from one industry event to another about four blocks away, when I realized I was starving. Eleven City was rated much higher than the other local eatery I could see from where I was standing, but...a diner? Hmmm.... I made the right decision! As soon as I came in, two different staff members said hi to me. When I was seated, I was offered reading material since I was dining alone. I hadn't heard of a phosphate, but when the barmaid explained them to me, I knew I wanted one. Delicious! I had the cherry flavor and have a fire under me to try the chocolate flavor next time. I ended up ordering a salad, and when it arrived, it was HUGE! I couldn't even eat it all. Everything in it was fresh and crisp--no ""old broccoli stank"" here. I mentioned to the server that I was in a little bit of a hurry, and so she got me my check early. I was in and out in about 15 minutes, although I'd had only quality interactions with the staff, delicious food, and even used the very clean bathroom. My tummy was full, I had money left over, and all seemed right with the world.

Quality and quantity are important to the folks at e.leaven, so don't expect to drop less than $11 on one these behemoth creations. The chicken soup broth was good, I may prefer the broth at The Bagel. My very first egg cream wasn't in NYC like i imagined, but you can get can get an authentic version of the folklored concoction right here in Chicago. Our awesome server informed us that every egg cream must be made with a very specific chocolate sauce, Fox's U-Bet Chocolate Syrup, no exceptions. Expect an effervescent take on a chocolate milk. It's the first time I've seen egg cream on a Chicago menu. This space has a very relaxed and fun feel.

It was quick and the waitress was being very attentive. Well I thought she was. I ordered the pastrami piled high, but with challah french toast. Simply enough right. Sandwich came out on regular challah. So I explain again. Sandwich comes back out on regular challah. This has got to be a joke right. What are you doing sitting it on the counter bringing it back and hoping that I will not notice. So I explain again and this time she informs me that no such bread exists. Really because the person less than 20 inches in front of me has it on there Moshe cristo. So I try to dumb it down for her. Take the bread from the moshe cristo and put pastrami on it. It really was that simple. Sandwich comes back out and what do we have this time ladies and gentlemen a moshe cristo. Really she tries to explain and I am just not having it. I want to speak to the manager. The manager comes over and is very helpful. I explain the situation to him. He looks confused. He has that look in his eye like this problem can't be that simple. I look back him like yes man it's just that simple. He then corrects the problem and brings me the correct sandwich. Finally they have it right. The finished product is nice, but not the best . I don't think they do the pastrami in house and it's missing some of those bold flavors you usually get with a really good pastrami.

My sister and her husband tried to join us about 10 minutes after we were seated. Our table had seating for 4 so it was perfect. WRONG. The short guy in the front would not let them join us. If they wanted to dine there they had to get a seperate table.  Apparantly its a rule that a party can't join in after you are seated because they were busy. Now let's think about this logically... if they are required to get a seperate table, then that takes up more space and reduces their ability to sit another party. My sister told the guy in the front that they would just join us they didn't have to serve them if they were busy. They end up sitting with us. I felt bad that we were eating and they were just watching us... kinda awkward. I try ordering ""extra"" food and the server says ""I have been told by the manager I can't bring out any food to your guests"" ouch!

They were then more or less forced into buying average sized milkshakes for 7.50 each! (I could make 5 of them at home for 5 dollars!) Almost immediately after the last of my corned beef Reuben (which was admittedly quite good) pass my lips, a man, presumably a manager or co-owner or something, told us we needed to pay, move, and give up our booth. I think he was trying to entice us somewhere else with the promise of coffee or ice cream (which he definitely would have made us pay for). We said screw it, we just wanted to get out of there at this point. The bill came, I gave them my credit card as other people had cash (because there is NO splitting of checks more than 3 ways, logistics be damned), only to find 10 minutes later, that somehow, somewhere between my hand and the counter, my credit card had been LOST.

Right away, I liked the whole jitterbug throwback theme. It was also a lot larger than it looked from the front facade. It made me wish I was eating in instead. Oooh, and then the prices made me wish I was eating in instead. Not to say it's expensive, but not ideally priced for getting your food in a tin to eat atop a chair as a table. I got the Three Eggs Any Style w/ a side of bacon. They were out of the ""smoked bacon"" so even though I was paying extra for that, I had to settle for regular bacon. I... I don't even know, myself. Don't ask.  The breakfast entree came with a small side of house potatoes and two slices of toast w/ toast fixins. It's your run of the mill diner breakfast plate, so I feel $10 for that is a bit much given there's nothing specially done with any of it. With a juice, about $12. The other egg dishes are just a dollar more, but look to be much more worth their price. However, what I got worked for where I would be eating, along with the ease I needed and time frame in which I had to eat it in. I need to go back and sit down to eat.

A friend recently told me of an evening when she and her group were seated when he realized that one of their party was outside parking the car.  When he discovered this, he essentially asked them to leave because the restaurant's policy forbids them to be seated if the entire party is not present. This past weekend, some friends and I had brunch here and, as is common, attempted to pay with our credit cards.  When we asked him to split the bill 3-ways, he blatantly lied to us by telling us flatly ""oh, I can't do this,"" and his computer system ""couldn't handle that.""  Each of us having worked in retail and/or restaurants know this isn't true.  The truth is, asking him to do this was just inconvenient to him; perhaps he has a solid business reason not to do this and he easily could have respectfully told us as much.  Whatever the case, the fact that he lied and was so brusque shows how little he cares for his customers.  While the food is decent and our waitress was great, the owner is so unpleasant, I'd prefer to spend my money where I'm shown some friendliness and respect.

2010-12-04,1.0,"Planned to have brunch at Eleven City Diner with some out of town family.  A few of us were running slightly behind. When the rest of the group arrived, the manager (or owner?) Brad - not sure his name - was INCREDIBLY RUDE to them.  The restaurant apparently has a policy that if ""not everyone is there, they will not seat you"".  First, I think it's an obnoxious policy, but if you want to have that, fine. However, a little flexibility??? The group had tickets somewhere and had to get to an event on time -- and asked if they could sit and get started. They would not seat the rest of the group.  Refused.  Then when we decided to just seat the folks there, and we'd eat separately, they asked to be seated -- but the little girl had gone to the bathroom, and Brad refused to seat the rest of the folks.  Then someone else was in the bathroom, and again, Brad refused to seat them.  He was very very rude and extremely disrespectful.  When I arrived, we were already disappointed that our ""family brunch"" would not be, since Brad only allowed the family a table for six.  When we arrived, we said ""we're the people meeting the group of six that you wouldn't let sit and save our seats"".  He proceeded to be EXTREMELY rude to me. Telling me ""if I had been nice, he'd seat us at a table near our family, but now he won't"" and saying ""I don't need attitude, I'm not from Highland Park"" ... now, I'm not from HP either, but WTF kind of remark was that? Then he said, ""I could have seated you near your family, but I don't have to"" - and then, had the nerve to go up to our family and tell them that he was going to do THEM a favor and let us sit near but that we're rude and shouldn't get to. What in the world kind of service is this? And what kind of manager is this immature and rude? I cannot believe the restaurant tolerates this behavior. It is terrible customer service and turned us off so much that we'll never return. It's unfortunate, because we like the restaurant. But Brad was so obnoxious that we cannot patronize a place that doesn't take their customer service seriously.  It's the most important part of a business, more than the food, and to be rude and insulting to your customers - who are keeping you in business - is unacceptable.",-0.9932,0.799,0.057,0.145,0.6717845117845119

This place also saved me last Pesach when I had been driven to the brink of my sanity by the lack of K4P options, and Eleven City came to my rescue with sour pickle plates and matzoh with all the smelly fish my heart desires.  Their whitefish salad is chunky and incredible, and if that stuff weren't $15 a pound I'd probably put in a weekly order. Their matzoh ball soup is delicious (insert requisite comment about how my mother's is better here) with an excellent broth and good texture. I also love that they stock Eli's Cheesecake, and their drink selection is fun if not a little expensive. Gotta love the ambiance though, I find Judaikitsch and yiddish-sprinkled menus comforting and it's just close enough to the diners of the northeast that I miss so much. I really think it could be improved by better bagels (but who am I kidding, all of Chicago could be improved by better bagels), and some specials to ring in the Jewish holidays and help spread our holiday cheer to the gentiles, especially for Hannukah and Passover.

I think I would have enjoyed being alive back then if it weren't for the fact that I would be a.) really old right now and b.) the whole lack of civil rights. But, I dig swing music, saucy broads and soda jerks so I knew I was in for a treat at 11 City. I got it. I ate until I looked to be a few months pregnant. I started with a shake -- a chocolate/strawberry mix with a cherry and whipped cream on top. And, I ordered it at the fountain. ""Gee, Mr. Wilson. This place sure has some swell ice cream!"" That's what I would have said about the treat 80 years ago and if I were talking to someone named 'Mr. Wilson.' But, any place that starts the meal off with ice cream is a winner.  Since the bloom was off the rose, I decided to go for decadence and forget health. I got the lox & latke, everything but hold the sour cream, served with a bagel. Because my ass isn't wide enough, I decided on a side of Wisconsin cheddar fries. The cheese wasn't the melty slices. It was that odd-texture, thicker cheese with the slight tang and hint of a secret ingredient. Reading back, it sounds disgusting but it really is quite amazing. For the fries, the cheese sauce was pretty delicious. As much as I wanted to put it on everything, I noted that it was a bad idea and left well enough alone. You need to come here with an appetite.

I should have been informed that the salsa and green peppers I was requesting were extra and quite honestly both should have just been a part of the $11 taco salad.

Nothing to write home about but it hit the spot. I would order it again.  My friend had The Schwartzy and he really liked it although he wished it came with fries instead of coleslaw. We were both really stuffed but again, nothing too special.  We ordered Bloody Mary's. I thought they were good because they were spicy. My friend thought his was too spicy and couldn't finish it. Bottom line: I'll give this place a solid B for good food but I think it's proximity  & convenience is swaying my vote.  My sandwich + Bloody Mary + tax & tip set me back ~ $24.... a bit steep for what it was worth.  I wouldn't mind going back and I plan on maybe trying their breakfast options (only if I can walk past Bongo Room w/o looking in).  Worth a whirl if you find yourself in South Loop and craving pastrami.

I've eaten there about a dozen times (on Sundays only because my regular deli is closed) and think I'm done.   Like I said, the food is really good, but the attitude takes away from the quality. They auto grated my table of 6, which was fine (even though we were five adults and a toddler).  I don't really care that they auto grated us; they would have gotten a bigger tip if they hadn't.  The problem was that the when the server she automatically assigned portions of the tip to each card without telling us that would happen.  So instead of paying the $50 that I instructed her to put on my card, she put $58 and change because ""That's how we do it.""  Would have been nice to get a heads up on that. Again we were with a toddler, and instead of putting us at the 6 top in the front window, they made us wait 20 minutes (standing right in front of the open table no less) and informed us that city ordinance prevents them from putting a high chair near the window.  I've lived here a long time and NEVER heard bullshit like that before.  In fact the best part was the snooty host who said,""I'd love to put you there, but the city tells me I can't and I want you're business, but I'm not willing to get fined for it."" I'd love to know what ordinance it is because we've eaten out several hundred times in the last 18 months with our kid and not one other restaurant in the city fed me that line of crap.

In a perfect and more precise yelp world, I'd probably award 3.5 stars, or possibly even 3.6 - but such are the limits of the interwebs. So! The food. The food is pretty darn...OK, all things considered. The main courses are probably the weaker points of the menu, though they're by no means bad. I think my dining companions have been satisfied by the burgers and lox platters; I've had some decent breakfast stuffs from the back page. But it's pretty typical quality for diner food, all dressed up and priced as something a little fancier. I like the Jewish deli vibe, but in the end it's more entertaining style than delicious substance. The extras on the menu, however, are the saving grace. The chocolate phosphate drinks are both quite unique and tasty - nice throwback to an old-time soda fountain, even served with the requisite seltzer water chaser. Fun. And the red velvet cake - sweet sassy molassy. I had fantasies about this cake for days afterwards. There is a photo of it in the galley above and, sexy as it is, it cannot do it justice. The slice is huge and the cream cheese icing is unbelievable. Order it. Eat it as slowly as your primitive brain centers allow. So food is both hit and not-quite-hit.

First, the service is fine.  In fact, if anything, the service is too attentive for my taste.  I'm not real big on chatty, perky servers.  I've been here 12-15 times (I work down the street), and I have NEVER had a service problem.  The only thing close to a service problem was when the owner--- who can be kind of a high-pressure jerk-- tried to take matters into his own hands when someone was being trained. Second, the food is very good, but not as good as Manny's in my opinion.  I've had a couple of dry-ish pastrami sandwiches here, and the the matso-ball soup could use a touch more flavor.  The Reuben is really good, and maybe the best deal on the menu.  I the pastrami would be a good deal if it came with fries like the Reuben, but it just sits there lonely on the plate. Lastly, the prices for some items are kind of high.  If you don't plan, you could end up spending $30+ for lunch and wondering what the hell you did when you walk out.   (Pastrami sandwich w/ a schmear , matso ball soup, fries, milkshake and tip can run you about that--- it adds up!) For Deli food, I'd choose Manny's.  For service I'll take Eleven City.  For price, I'll take Manny's.  For location, I'll take Eleven City.  It's your call.",0.9247,0.856,0.096,0.048,0.5155026455026455

It is pricey but that has always been forgiven because the food is very good for diner food. The reason for the one star? Service!   My family and I have been coming to this restaurant at least once a week for over two years and always enjoyed ourselves. Sometimes you are made to feel grateful for being able to eat there but whatever, I generally overlooked the attitude until recently when we had a disagreement with the front manager. I believe this is the same manager that another yelper commented on as arrogant and very unpleasant, and he is.  We were seated at a table outside but then asked if we could sit inside instead due to the bugs outside, to which the hostess told us that someone would come help us move our things. Ten minutes later nobody had come and the morose manager had walked past us several times only to reprimand another customer for asking to change tables. When we asked to move again, he seemed highly irritated and offered to seat us at a table next to the kitchen that was crowded between a dirty table and another occupied table. If the restaurant had been busy we would have understood but it was not. Over half the restaurant was empty. We asked if we could sit at a different table at which point the manager said we could sit at the bar. His reasoning for why we could not sit at another table was that it would take him ""time to prep the waitstaff because of the change"". Now I have been a waitress and I have managed wait staff in much busier restaurants and I know you address the customer's needs first and deal with your wait staff issues after. However, at least for this manager, customer satisfaction is not a priority. While we had this conversation with the manager, they actually tried to serve us our food at the bar, at which point we said we would pay for our drinks and leave if we could not eat at one of the other available tables. The manager then asked us to leave and not come back.  Which sadly we will not. We have enjoyed this restaurant and brought many out of town guests but this was the last time. I have never been treated this way in any restaurant and was frankly shocked by the attitude and disrespect that was shown to us. The fact that we have been loyal customers for a while did not matter at all.

My husband had the matza brie (I know, right, what's wrong wtih him) and he loved it. We also tried the chalah french toast with berries and fresh maple syrup, which was to die for. The half-sour tomato and pickles were delicious as well. We had Dr. Brown's to drink, of course. What's a Jewish deli with Dr. Brown's soda?  The service was 5 out of 5, and the food was 10 out of 5. Prices were reasonable, around $10 for a sandwich with fries. The sandwiches were easily enough for 1.5 or 2 meals.",0.9935,0.746,0.214,0.04,0.5480952380952382

I tried the Reuben sandwich during the lunch hour at a bar seating.  The food was delicious, but it could have used a bit thicker rye bread.  The atmosphere is very casual and relaxed; the waiting staff lets the customers take their time.  I've seen several customers reading books or newspapers while they ate.

We walked in a found a pretty big crowd waiting but it seemed like they were moving through the list quickly.  They told us 30 mins for 2, but it was closer to 20 BONUS! The Bloody Mary was AWESOME.  Fresh celery stalk, great salt and spice mix on the rim, giant olives, I don't even like Bloodys but this was unreal. It was $9.50 (This part is RIDICULOUS) but almost worth it.  If it were $7.50 you'd feel like you got a deal. Our meals were great, I went for the breakfast and the GF did lunch. We were both really pleased. Two complaints that prevented me from going with 4 stars (and honestly would make me think twice about coming back, or at least consider a time when it weren't so busy)... Ordering drinks while you're waiting for a table.  So get this.  I go up to the bartender, who has no customers and looks kinda bored, and order a Bloody.  She says she can't serve me one if I'm waiting for a table, I have to go see the hostess.  I go to the hostess and let her know I'd like a bloody mary.  She checks my ID then directs me to a cashier's station.  Another guy comes up and takes my order and money.  He then gets a runner to go get my bloody and come track me down.  So to recap, if you want a drink while you're waiting you've got to have the ID checked by the hostess, the order taken by the clerk, a runner delivering the order, and another dude bringing it to you.  I'm not sure what Rocket Surgeon came up with this plan but it's absolutely idiotic.  What could have been a 3 minute exchange with the bartender turned into a 10-12 minute wait and a scavenger hunt throughout the restaurant to get a drink.  BOO Issue 2 - The ridiculous, and unfortunately non-stop, shtick of servers yelling ""hot soup"" when carrying anything through the diner.  I'm not kidding, NON-STOP.  Single cup of soda... ""HOT SOUP!!  HOT SOUP!!  HOT SOUP!!""  Tray of Bloody Marys ""HOT SOUP!! HOT SOUP!!""  Bagels and lox?

Once seated the service was very good, very attentive but not overbearing.  We started with the spinach dip which I thought was good - very fresh but a little more bland than I'm use to.  The cheese was very mild and not the more substantial cheese I'm use to in this dish.  Regardless, it was good and heaping with bagel chips for dipping.

2010-05-12,1.0,"Eating at this restaurant was one of the worst experiences i have ever had, and you can pretty much blame 95% of it on the EXTREMELY obnoxious douche bag owner. The other 5% can be blamed on the mediocre over priced food and the fact that this place seems to think the Judaism is not a religion but a marketable commodity. I will start by explaining my comment about the owner. Not  only does this guy walk around the restaurant talking way too loud and bossing his staff around unnecessarily, but he also is constantly coming up to tables and talking to them for too long while they are trying to eat (classic arti buco move). Nothing is worse than having to talk to a hugely intense douche while you are trying to eat. Secondly while i was eating at the front window table i watched the owner as he stormed out of the restaurant and angrily approached my bicycle which was locked to a fence right outside the restaurant (there was construction going on at the time). I could see him pacing back and forth and throwing his hands in the air which greatly perplexed me. Then out of nowhere he picks up the back wheel of my bike, and jams it into the fence to the point where is was completely vertical on the fence. At this point i rushed out of my seat and confronted him at the door. When i asked him what we was doing, he said that he was angry that my bike was blocking the sidewalk (which it wasn't) and that he was worried about losing business from foot traffic. He did not apologize, he did not put my bike back, and he made no effort at all to correct the situation. When i finally de-mangled my bike from the fence my front rim was bent, and my handle bars were also slightly misaligned. When i went back in to confront him he was nowhere to be found and would not return my calls.  What kind of business owner destroys his customers property, then refuses to apologize? Not only is this man an obnoxious coward, but he clearly doesn't care about his customers. Needless to say i do not recommend ever going to this restaurant. Also, It is completely ridiculous that half the things on the menu are named after famous Jewish people. This is reminiscent of  gimmicky places that name their food after cartoon characters or famous musicians. In fact this is closer to something that you would find on a menu in Disney World or the Hard Rock Cafe rather than a Jewish diner. Why does this man feel the need to advertise the religion associated with his establishment so blatantly and obnoxiously? In new york (where there are real Jewish diners) they have no need to advertise their religion because you just know, and its not that important. What is important is the quality of the food, and customer satisfaction which 11 city diner fails miserably at delivering. Judaism is a religion and culture that has endured thousands and thousands of years of some of the roughest hardships known to mankind. Please Mr. owner, do not trivialize this tradition with gimmicks just so you can sell your mediocre over priced food. ok..i am done.",-0.9975,0.817,0.027,0.156,0.5848665223665225

I fell seriously in love with this place, pretty much before I even walked in the doors. After hearing that they have excellent Jewish diner food I checked out their website/menu and I was sold.  When my boyfriend asked me what I wanted to do to celebrate Valentine's Day I said, ""I want to get a reuben sandwich at Eleven City Diner""...that's just the kind of girl I am.

The service is always fantastic; sometimes sassy, but in a good way.  The real show stopper is the food. Good lord is the food delicious! Here are the things that I've tried (and enjoyed each of them):  * The Schwartzy (brisket sandwich on challah): dip it in the au jus  * ""Shappy"" Salami Sandwich: huge pieces of salami  * Moshe Cristo (Monte Cristo with challah french toast)  * Red Velvet Cake: piled high and oh-so-delicious  * Mac n cheese: rich, creamy, and dreamy  * French fries: cooked perfectly with lots of salt  * The winner of them all...Rubin's Rueben: this is my favorite reuben in the world.

Great service otherwise, probably only because the staff are terrified. Being the only diner like this in the S Loop, the aforementioned flaws are overlooked, particularly by unknowing tourists staying in the surrounding hotels. I would recommend the much more reasonable Ashkenaz deli in Gold Coast over this joint.   As long as the Hilton and other hotels in the area are in business, chances are ECD will be too.",0.4215,0.804,0.112,0.084,0.5524725274725275

Anyway, we decided to stay for dinner.  I started with the frozen vodka lemonade - awesome! And then we ordered food - I wanted the Audri (turkey melt!). I asked the waiter what side came with this and he had to go check. This sandwich is $10.95 and comes with NO SIDES. My partner's $12.25 Reuben came with sides. Grrr, at that point I felt like I was being nickel and dimed, especially when the side salad was $6 and is almost 100% iceberg lettuce.  As we waited for our food, the owner (we figured this out later since he was bossing around so many people and his photo is on a wall hanging near the restroom) shows up with some other people.. some very loud people. They sit at the booth behind our table. LOUD LOUD LOUD TRY THIS DRINK HERE HAVE SOME WITH APPLESAUCE LOUD LOUD LOUD. We ordered some of that NY cheesecake - which was awesome - but no one would ever know since the group behind us was talking so loud and demanding attention from all of the wait staff. Ugh.  Our waiter was great, and you could tell he noticed what a jerk the owner was being. All the other tables were full at this time.

2010-04-21,2.0,"Staying downtown at a nearby hotel the weekend of April 16th, I was definitely eager to try out Eleven City Diner.  I LOVE diner food.  I love the experience.  And I love the diner atmosphere.  It's a shame the experience and food I got was mediocre and the portions were small based on the price. A friend of mine and I went on Friday, April 16th.  I got the ""Schwartzy"" sandwich, which is supposed to be ""piled high with beef brisket"", but what I got was a decent, average sized beef sandwich.  Basically, it was about twice the size of a regular Arby's beef sandwich.  Yes, the meat was definitely tender and tasty, and the challah roll melted in my mouth, but for 10.95 I expect a heck of a lot more.  Plus I had to order fries on the side as the sandwiches do not come with fries.  Once again, based on the price, I felt as if I was shorted in serving size. My friend ordered the grilled veggie sandwich.  That, at least, was large enough to justify the 10.25 price.  They were quite happy with what they got. For dessert, I got the carrot cake and my friend passed.  The cake was the best part of the meal.  And I didn't feel like I was getting ripped off.  Unlike most carrot cakes you can get elsewhere, it wasn't overpowered by the frosting.  It was extremely good. Service was ok.  Nothing spectacular.  Plus we were sat pretty much out of the way, so it was difficult to get anyone's attention for refills. Overall, the cake saved this place from a 1 star rating.  The food is ok, but not enough to justify their pricing.  If they increased the portion sizes or lowered the prices a tad, then I would feel better in spending as much as I did.  Otherwise, I'll not go out of my way to come here again.",0.9951,0.786,0.185,0.029,0.5314538335227991

2010-03-27,5.0,"My wife and I were in Chicago for the 2010 ABA Techshow, and were clued in to Seven City Diner by the concierge at the Chicago Hilton.  We went on an early Friday night (5pm) for dinner, and had an incredible experience. I had the Woody Allen (pastrami and corned beef on toasted rye), my wife had the bacon cheeseburger & fries, and we shared an order of ""The Mountain"", a huge pile of very thinly sliced fried onion strings, and hot ketchup. Everything was absolutely fantastic, the food was brought to the table within 10 minutes of our order, and it was fresh, hot and absolutely delicious. The staff were all incredibly helpful, and seemed genuinely happy to have us there. Because we had such a great experience, we went back the next afternoon, around 11pm, for lunch. The diner was pretty packed, with a 20 minute wait, but the staff kept things flowing very quickly, and it didn't seem like very long at all. Once we were seated, the food came out very quickly -- I had the Mexican scramble, a chorizo, jack, scallion, and salsa scrambled egg on fried corn tortillas, with a side of house potatoes, and my wife had a waffle. The waffle was so light and airy, I wish I had gotten one. The eggs & potatoes were fantastic, and with a little hot sauce went very well with the massive Bloody Mary I also ordered ;).  We also tried a half order of the Challah French Toast, two slices of fluffy challah french toast with cinnamon, powdered sugar, and sliced fresh strawberries and bananas, topped with toasted coconut. The french toast itself was perfectly fried, crispy on the outside, and soft and airy inside. The strawberries were surprisingly ripe for it not being even near strawberry season, and maple syrup tied the whole thing off perfectly. This in and of itself is worth the trip to Eleven City -- if the rest of the food were crap, I would still come here for the french toast alone. As a bonus, you can buy a loaf of challah from the deli, and give it a shot yourself. It really is the bread that makes the difference.  We also spoke to the owner, Brad, and his mother before we left, and they are two of the most easygoing approachable people that I have ever met. It is extremely evident that they care just as much about their customers & food as they do their business, and this shines through into the attitudes of the servers and staff.  Eleven city has a great owner, great staff, great food, and decent prices. Well worth the effort to get to if you are going to be in or near Chicago. As a bonus, you can walk out the doors and straight to the park near Lake Michigan to walk off the million calories you just ate. Also, I keep reading reviews saying that this place is expensive, and I guess I just don't really see it. I'm a big ol' boy from Alabama, and I can eat like most folks can't (seriously, I'm 6'4"" and 350lbs), and I see this place as a real bargain. $40 gets more food than my wife and I could have possibly eaten, and I had alcohol each time. The only thing on the menu that I would really classify as ""expensive"" is the $9.50 Bloody Mary, but the damn thing comes with olives, meat, cheese, and a healthy serving of vodka. It's less of a drink and more of a meal, and it's worth every penny!",0.9974,0.813,0.153,0.034,0.5244748858447489

2010-03-14,2.0,"I give this place 2 stars, which may be 1 more than it deserves after the experience we had this morning.  In short, food was ok, but the staff has questionable judgement. Did I mind the 30 minute wait for a table?  I tolerated it, but would never go back to a place that makes you wait 30 minutes and refuses to take reservations.  But where you stand while you're waiting at 11 City Diner is very important.  If you wait to the right of the hostess stand, you will be reprimanded.  Waiting by the bar is not an option either.  Apparently, it's acceptable to wait by the pseudo-candy store, which is where we found refuge.  (On a side note, I'm confident they would make you wait outside, even if there was a tornado ripping down Wabash). So we were eventually seated at a decent booth, however it was dangerously close to the server drink station.  Chris was our server and he was very nice (Chris, if you're reading this, you should travel a bit more because that mac&cheese was NOT ""The World's Greatest"") We ordered the mac&cheese (obviously) and the spinach w/ warm artichoke as appetizers.  Both were tolerable, but we were an easy crowd as we were absolutely STARVING at this point.  Two of us ordered the Mexican Scramble (or scrambler, I don't remember) and it, too, was tolerable.  The 3rd person in our party ordered the ham&cheese omelette which looked good, but she didn't eat it (she was really hungover, so no fault of 11 City Diner). As we were getting our food, my brother called.  He lives in the neighborhood and wanted to join us, which sounded like a great idea.  Well, we would soon learn that this is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR at 11 City Diner.  We asked for an extra menu, which Chris retrieved for us, but the owner's mother would soon come by to retract that and tell us our whole party should have been present just to be seated in the first place.  She was nice about it and a sweet lady in general, but THEN ANOTHER staff member came by and harrassed us about the fact that it was UNACCEPTABLE for another person to join our party, despite the available space at our booth.  WOW.  I lost it.  I couldn't handle all the ""Hot Soup"" shouts every time a server walked behind another server right next to us and now we were being totally harrassed about inviting another person to join us and purchase more of their product.  Listen, I was a server in college, I understand the benefit to good communication amongst the staff, but SERIOUSLY, let's cut out the ""Hot Soup"" shouts, ESPECIALLY when you have nothing in your hands and the server you're going behind is empty-handed as well.  I suggest 86'ing the ""Hot Soup"" and resort to a more appropriate remark such as ""Behind.""  And it's not important that EVERONE in the restaurant hear you, just the person you're actually going behind. So I mentioned I lost it, right?  I told the second guy that harrassed us that I didn't appreciate being harrassed, which, of couse, he quickly denied and took offense to.  Of course, I disagreed with his disagreement.  So I was very professional in delivering my feedback, which he, in turn, apparently communicated to the owner, who came over and started speaking to us without an introduction of who he was.  Having met ""The Owner's Mother"" Roz a short time ago, I felt comfortable asking him if he was, in fact, Roz's son, which he confirmed.  Now I knew I was speaking with the owner, but I really didn't care to speak to anyone else in the restaurant and would have preferred to have been issued our check and sent on our way (I'm confident they would have loved to have seen us go anyway). Of course, my brother did show up, but I told him it would not be in his best interest to eat anything they may bring to the table.  This advice was influenced by the movies ""Road Trip"" and ""Waiter."" Will we go back?  Only if it's the only option or someone wants to do research on mediocre service and policy (refer to the ""NO JOINERS"" policy which is apparently posted by the hostess stand). In case you're wondering, our tab for 3 people was $72.20.  I left $85, which represents 17.7% gratuity on the total.  To be honest, I would have loved to have stiffed the server just so that he complains to the owner and more consideration is given in the future to the restaurant's guests. Brad (I know this is your name per the previous post by someone who I suspect may have a financial interest in your place), I'm going to assume you're reading this.  OVERALL, congrats on running a successful business here in the South Loop,  but PLEASE spend more on training the staff to be more polite and appropriate to the people who pay your bills.  As for policies, there's a right way and a wrong way of enforcing them.  For comparison, let's try it the other way next time. I actually feel bad now for writing an unfavorable review, but this website is designed for feedback, right?  Sorry Brad.",0.9955,0.775,0.139,0.086,0.537069465779143

The menu had so many appealing options, it was tough deciding what to order. I had the chicken matzo ball soup that was the size of a large cantaloupe and split a never-ending vanilla milkshake. I also had some of my husband's open-faced Reuben sandwich, which he liked but could have used more slaw. The service was good, the menu was great and the food hit the spot.

2010-03-11,1.0,"A couple of co-workers decided to try this place for lunch. We work a couple of blocks away and I have always wanted to try this place out. As a native new yorker who grew up with Katz's deli I was ready to try out a chicago deli.  What happened next was so shocking that I was more than eager to write a review. I can't even comment on the food because I didn't even have a chance to try it. That is how terrible the customer service was here.  When my two co-workers and I walked in the door the manager asked if we needed a table for 3. We told him that there would maybe be someone else meeting us for lunch so it may be 4, but we weren't sure if they were going to make it. He got very hyper and jumpy and told us that he couldn't seat us until our entire party was there. We said ok then it will just be 3, and we will tell our friend not to bother trying to join us. Again, in a very uncomfortable manner he said he didn't want to seat us because if our friend showed up he wouldn't be able to seat them. Again, we told him that we would tell them not to come and it was ok that we would just be 3. There was no one waiting for a table and there were many empty tables at this time. He now responded that he was going to walk away and that we should discuss it over and call our friend and make a decision. At this point after telling him numerous times that it would only be the three of us, we were so uncomfortable that we decided to leave.

My now-fiancee and I moved to the South Loop in June 2009 and weren't very familiar with what was available. Fortunately, we stumbled across Eleven completely by accident. What began as an encounter driven by curiosity has turned into a full-blown love affair. We'd choose Eleven over Yolk or Bongo Room in a heartbeat. The waitstaff is awesome and we've never had to wait more than 20 minutes (usually much shorter, get there around 9:30) to get a table. Food's always served hot and if you have time to take advantage of the soda jerk, you should. I don't think anyone serves a better Bloody Mary (It's almost a whole meal by itself).

2010-03-01,3.0,"Walking into ECD is like walking into a more upscale Fat Moe's in the movie ""Once Upon a Time in America.""  The interior is very well done if only a tad over the top with the Hebrew motif.  It's a loft space with high ceilings, great concrete pillars, huge angled mirrors rising up above the bar and all kinds of kitsch from framed paintings of rabbis, menorahs and old framed up LP covers.   The soundtrack here consists of jazz such as Billie Holiday, Louie Armstrong and tunes like ""Smoke Gets in Your Eyes"" -  stuff you might have heard in Fat Moe's in the movie if not for the Morricone soundtrack. Before we walked in I figured we'd run into a bunch of college kids hanging around studying given the area.  That wasn't the case.  And I found out why when I opened up the menu.   Nine bucks for a Vienna beef hot dog.  Twelve bucks for a bacon cheeseburger.  My jaw hit the ground.  It's a diner setting but certainly not diner prices. I opted for the eleven dollar (oy!) turkey burger.  She had one of the breakfast dishes with sausage, bacon, eggs, potatoes and pancakes.  Eat your hearts out, girls.  Anyway, I have to say the turkey burger was a big disappointment.  It was just too bland, even with the spicy mayo sauce.  I only ate half of it and gave the rest to The Leftover Queen to take home.  The breakfast was better.  I liked the potatoes.  Mind you, they're not as good as the hash browns at Hashbrowns.   I perused their beer menu while here and saw that they have Two Brothers Country Ale.  That's a good call carrying that tasty beverage.  But again, we're talking an exorbitant price.  It's $7.95 a pint!  I can buy a six pack of the stuff for $7.99 at Whole Foods.   Lastly, while we were here I saw the manager/owner training two hapless new server recruits.  This guy looked like he'd had about five coffees too many.  He was just bouncing off the walls.  How anything he was telling these two newbies sunk in I don't know.  I think he fancies himself an actor even if nobody is watching him. Anyway, I really like the space, but the food here isn't good enough to warrant the exorbitant prices.  I may return some day, but I'd frankly rather go to Yolk if I have a choice and there's no wait.   It's 2 1/2 stars.  I'll round up to three for the cool interior.",0.8642,0.876,0.078,0.046,0.5244575216450216

Sandwich came out on this delish foccacia bread and had pesto sauce spread on it.  My only complaint was the too-think slice of roasted onion on the sandwich - it was just a bit much for my taste.  Much to my suprise, and delight, the cheese fries were cheddar cheese fries!  So tasty, gooey, and heart-cloggingly excellent.

Desserts, too, including sodas and fudge sundaes, pies and carrot and cheese cakes. Although I'm a person who can eat dinner for breakfast, I settled on Coco's Eggs, a mix of 3 scrambled eggs, feta cheese, spinach, tomatoes and scallions.  Woohoo.

My tablemate ordered the Name Your Omelet with 3 eggs and her choice of cheese and veggies along with house potatoes and toast.  I heard nary a bad word about her meal. I cleaned my plate, and the meal tided me over until dinner.  My tablemate reluctantly left only a tablespoonful of potatoes.  She too filled herself.

The Owner was walking around and stopped by when he heard and started being a complete Jerk for no apparent reason. I very hesitantly returned there after a friend really wanted to try it. The Second time, there were cockroaches around our feet. I was in DISBELIEF!! Unfortunately, I had already finished eating or would have left immediately.

I feel better knowing that others have had similar experiences there-mostly related to the loud and obnoxious owner who I have heard scolds customers as and when he pleases depending on his mood. The other times, he is just walking around yelling, ""Hot Soup!!."" He's finicky and I would only go there if you absolutely have no other restaurant left on this planet to go to.

It is the service we received on our last trip that caused the two star rating.  If the rating was just based on food, it could be a three star place.  But the service here... hit or miss at best.

2009-11-04,4.0,"After a horrible night's sleep at the Essex Inn during our first night in Chicago, my husband and I woke up barely able to function.  The first thing we wanted was a good meal, and within walking distance of our hotel, so Eleven was chosen. We got there around 1pm or so, and it was jam-packed.  We had a 20-minute wait and we were both a little grumpy to begin with, so I hoped the food would be worth it!  Our waitress was pretty awesome--friendly and speedy--and took our order quickly.  She checked back on us several times and got me more hot water for my tea (for some reason lots of wait people seem to hate it when you order tea and tend to ignore you). I had the grilled veggie sandwich, my husband had the Schwartzy sandwich, and we split an order of Wisconsin cheese fries.  It did take a bit for our food to come out, but we got drinks right away (my husband's Brooklyn egg cream took quite a while but she brought him water in the mean time).  My sandwich was piping hot... in fact, one of the grilled zucchini pieces fell on my leg while I was eating, and it nearly burned through my jeans when I didn't move fast enough to brush it off!  It tasted great, though it was a mess to eat because everything kept slipping out when I'd lift it up to take a bite.  It came with a mixed green salad, which was really good and very fresh, and I loved the crisp dill pickle (I hate the squishy deli pickles sandwiches usually come with).  The fries were very good but not earth-shattering. I thought everything was reasonably priced, and I got a huge amount of food and was barely able to finish my sandwich and salad after sharing the fries (thankfully, we were starving or I wouldn't have gotten that far). We visited again, a few nights later, just for dessert.  I had the carrot cake and a mint chocolate chip shake, and my husband had chocolate cake.  The shake was really excellent--not sickly sweet/overly-sugary--but the cake was pretty average.  My husband felt the same way about his.  We both wanted to come back for breakfast but never made it back for the third time. Overall, I really liked Eleven.  They have good, fresh food, great service, and a really cool atmosphere.  I do agree with the gentleman below who said it's really a deli, and not a diner, but I can see why they call it a diner for confusion's sake.  The location was really convenient for us from the Essex Inn and the hours were very convenient too.  I wish I'd had a chance to try more things!",0.9948,0.81,0.145,0.045,0.48381590136054425

2009-10-20,5.0,"LOVE Eleven City, and this is why: 1. Brad Rubin, the owner, is hilarious- our own Rocco DiSpirito here in Chicago.  I've never seen him yell at or demean his staff, and that would probably change my opinion- but it's weird that other people mention it, and I've been there 30 times w/out ever seeing it.  He's completely over-the-top, he's a classic schmoozer, and he manages to act like he's going to remember my wife and I every time, but never does (he's told me that he'll definitely remember us, because my name is Brad too, at least 4 separate times).  But he's a showman, and I think his schtick totally adds to the place.  I'll also give him this- though he never remembers us between visits, he does remember if you've had a particularly long wait to be seated, and he'll often stop by the table to apologize for the wait- he comped us a beer one time and a plate of onion strings another time.  He runs around like a madman whenever he's there, and he's just fun to watch. 2. The food is consistently good, and the portions are generous.  My wife swears by the Eleven City french toast (to the exclusion of all the other local breakfast places), and I love the deli scramble.  The owner's namesake Rubin's reuben (of course, right?) is solid and really too much for a non-Bears lineman to eat alone.  And lastly, the Field's Special Sandwich (renamed the blank blank sandwich on the menu- at the behest of Macy's soulless lawyers- see the cease-and-desist letter posted by the door) is reportedly even better than the original, according to my dad, who ate many of the originals in his day.  A great nod to classic Chicago and the really nice store we used to have on State Street.  The food is a little pricey compared to what you may pay for the same thing elsewhere, but it's better, so that explains it. 3. The staff is great.  I think a lot of the servers must be Columbia students- but without the attitude that you might expect from aspiring artists and filmmakers.  They know their stuff, they offer good suggestions, and they're generally attentive.  The few older servers are just as good and add to the diner feel (they kinda have that diner look and attitude to them).  Just be aware that there WILL be a wait for brunch on Saturday and Sunday, and there are sometimes short waits at other random times. Good-to-great diner food, reasonable-ish prices, and the dinner show that is Brad Rubin (complemented by his great staff)  make this place unique, even for Chicago.  Worth a trip from elsewhere in the city just to try it (and right next to the Roosevelt L-stop). P.S.  If you're a high-maintenance, whiny type, with a barefooted baby, or lots of requests for discounts or special exceptions, or who came because the wait at Yolk was too long (and announce that fact), you're going to HATE Brad Rubin, so don't come.  If you're chill and can appreciate a dude who loves his restaurant like a firstborn child and (in my experience, rarely) gets a little Ed-Debevic-y, give it a shot.",0.9979,0.805,0.166,0.03,0.4777336860670194

I have however come to learn that many midwestern folk hear the word deli, and think of something that belongs in a supermarket, so I guess props to them for a name that doesn't detract these misinformed individuals from entering. Enough nitpicking about the name... My most recent visit was following the AIDS walk, and me and my fellow ""athletes"" were hungry , tired, and in the neighborhood...enter 11 city diner. Let me break it down for ya, Service: 4 if not 5 stars, the staff here has always been attentive, friendly, and downright fun. They anticipate your need for a refill, appear quickly with anything extra you might need following the arrival your meal and are readily available for any additional things one may desire. Food: 3-4 stars, the reuben is served open-faced, melty, and a combination of corned beef and pastrami which is my personal favorite way to indulge. Admittedly I have only been here a few times, and have had the same thing anytime so I cannot judge on anything else. I was however considering an omlette, and I have a feeling if I had gone with it I would not have had such kind words that I did for the reuben, as the one that was ordered at the table looked like it had been way overcooked, then left sitting under a heatlamp for some period of time...water in to wine, not at 11 city, more like eggs into rubber. Price: ehhhh 3 stars, given the location I know there is going to be some inflation but c'mon 12 bucks for a sandwich, and I can't even substitute a latke for fries? It seems a little steep to me. Bathroom: 3 stars....Cleanliness = 2 stars, have they ever heard of a mop? I would also tone down the harsh lighting if I was going to allow it to get to the state that I experienced it in...Why the extra star you might ask? Dyson Airblade!!

We were seated in an area that I am suspicious was not part of the original dining room, but due to the weekend crowds comes in as a pinch hitter. We were next to, no not next to basically IN the kitchen. As a group of 7, I had the joy of sitting on the corner so I got a triple delight. Not only was  I sweating from being mere feet from the grills, but every minute or so I ducked as in my peripheral vision a huge tray filled with their not so small plates was hoisted over my head on to the shoulder of one of the waiters. Due to my seat location I had not only this pleasure, but I was literally sitting against the computer station that seemingly all of the waitstaff used to put in their orders, print checks, etc. Now I love being surrounded with people don't get me wrong, but an entire meal spent with servers literally standing over me, and at times arguing with one another, is not my idea of a relaxing dining experience. The cherry on top of the dismal table was the noise. I could barely hear the person sitting across from me, and any hopes of conversing with my dining mates not in my immediate vicinity was hopeless. If I return, and I probably will some time, along with my name and party size I will make it very clear that it is unacceptable to seat me or those I care about at this table, actually scratch that... It is unacceptable to seat ANYONE at this table, and if you must might I suggest you pick up their tab? These things combined I decided on 3 stars overall, maybe I am feeling nice today, and admittedly I have sat in other places which were all just fine, but c'mon if you are gonna charge what you do, stop and think about the overall experience for your patrons, that is after all what keeps 'em coming back.",0.9798,0.827,0.108,0.065,0.44622895622895625

I think I came here late fall or very early spring of 08 or 09. Can't remember the date, like I said hangover. Anyways, the parking situation sucks big time. You have to pay for parking within a mile radius. Shitty. So I make it through the rain to pay for my parking, headache and all, and I make it inside and was greeted immediately. Which was nice, so I took a seat at the bar. I needed a thirst quencher at this moment, so I ordered a water and a bloody mary. Probably the best bloody mary I had in years. I really liked that they didn't use a celery salt rim, and used pepper instead, plus all of the alcohol is top shelf. So I looked at the menu and decided to order the cabbage soup and the pastrami on rye. Let me tell you the soup alone could've been a meal all by itself. It was old school stuff. It was about 95% of the same flavor as my 92 year old jewish grandmother makes. The flavor just brought me back, and nearly melted away my hangover. It was slightly bitter, slightly sweet, and slightly salty. Basically all that encompases really good cabbage soup. After I finished it, I wanted to curl up on my bar stool, make a blanket out of the suntimes I was reading (provided by the bartender), and sleep for about 4 hours. But then came the pastrami on rye. I nearly broke down into tears because I knew this was going to take every last bit of effort I had. I felt like I was in an episode of Man V. Food. I do have to say it was worth the effort though. My only problem with the pastrami was there was so much marbling and fat it was kind of stringy and tough to eat, but nonetheless delicious. So if your in the south loop, looking for comfort food, give this place a shot. I highly doubt you will be disappointed.

First of all, brace yourself for the owner, or maybe he was a manager. Yowzahs.  We didn't actually have any personal encounters with him, but he's one live wire and pretty hard to miss.  We were sat right on the other side of the line so watched him charge up and down the aisle, barking at the servers, the cooks, patrons in his way, the furniture.  Hey, at least it was entertaining!  Just don't make eye-contact! My food was fantastic!  I had a reuben to trump all reubens, which was heartily approved by my half-Jewish boyfriend due to the fact that it had the appropriate amount of thousand-island on it, it wasn't doused on like most places.  He ended up eating half of my sandwich, he was so pleased.  He had the Monte Cristo, which he said wasn't bad but wasn't mind-blowing like mine.  My sister had the latkes and felt about the same.  The part that stands out in my mind was the soda fountain, oooh, getting sweet shivers just recalling the deliciosity- yeah, you read that right, it's my own word.  I don't know what they ordered as I was in the restroom when they did, but they got 2 different things and they were DELICIOUS!  They were lick-the-inside-of-the-cup-as-far-as-you-can-go-down delicious.  My sister quickly got over her cooties issues with sharing straws with meat-eaters about 30 seconds into the shakes, if that tells you anything.",0.9917,0.808,0.147,0.045,0.5086772486772487
2009-08-31,3.0,"I work for a company.  That company is based in New York.  That company is owned and run by a couple of Jewish guys out of New York.  They don't come to Chicago often (I would like to think it's because we are so efficient here in our Chicago offices).  The owners of my company are no nonsense and they don't want to try anything new when it comes to lunch.  When they come to Chicago they go out for big dinners and want lunch at noon.  No questions asked. For the past few years we have been using Eleven City Diner to cater our lunches when our VERY no nonsense owners are in town (from New York if I haven't mentioned that yet).  I have worked with the owner, Brad, on these orders several times.  He's is no nonsense as well.  He remembers us, he's friendly and he takes care of the orders and I get them exactly when he says they will be delivered.  Everything is fresh and good and the owners eat, drink and leave happy. The last time I ordered lunch was the same as all the rest until I got my receipt which read (for 12 people) a grand total of $311.00.  Now, this is just half sandwiches (because they are so huge), chips, potato salad, desserts.  That comes out to almost $25 per person.  I was thinking, this can't be right and if it is I am in BIG trouble.  I called the restaurant.  I asked for Brad.  He was too busy to talk to me so he put me on with someone else who said they'd call me back and never did.  I had to spend most of my afternoon trying to track someone down and eventually Brad found literally 45 seconds where he could talk to me assured me that that bill was incorrect and my bosses card would only be charged $217.00.  He wasn't friendly; he was busy and annoyed and rushed and he wanted me to leave him alone.  He didn't offer (or have) the real receipt but he again assured me that the card would only be charged the smaller amount and eventually it all worked out. I think that Brad has a different mentality than most people want to see in the owner of a diner or a restaurant.  You want the greeting, the smile, the coffee refill and perhaps the paper.  Brad wants good, high quality food, fast service and things done efficiently.  Like it or not, that's the way he is running his business and what they have to offer.",0.9725,0.846,0.094,0.06,0.42359805538376977

2009-07-13,5.0,"OMG!!! This diner tops them all. Let me start out by saying that I love going to diners. I enjoy the no nonsense approach of a diner. While most restaurants always focus on the dumb stuff, like the decor or what font the menu will be, I like that diners have more time to focus on the food.  Eleven City had everything I expected from a diner and even a few more extras.  I knew my roommates and I would have a great experience when our jolly waiter Christopher greeted us. As we looked over the menu, we wanted to order everything. Obviously we couldn't, so we started to strategize about what we would order. We went back and forth on the menu changing our minds several times. In our gluttonous stupor, we finally realized that we would just have to come back to order everything we wanted.  So, as far as the food goes - all I can say is that I have never ever had Matzo ball soup as good as this one. It was a huge serving, but I ate it all. The matzo ball was light and fluffy but still full. The broth was SO flavorful. Every spoonful just seemed to melt in my mouth. I'm still thinking about how good is was and can't wait to go back. I also had  Yenta's Latkes. These were also equally amazing. They were made exactly how I like them - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Most important, they weren't greasy at all - like they can be at other places. Topped off with the apple sauce and sour cream, I savored every bite. My roommates had the Woody Allen and Rubin's Rueben. They really liked them too.  The topping to the meal was the Bloody Mary. If you come here, you must, must, must order one.  I also like that they serve breakfast all day, so the next time I'm there, that's what I'm going to order.  Other things that made this diner amazing was the music and the counter that ran the length of the restaurant. It completes the diner experience!",0.991,0.836,0.138,0.025,0.4885714285714286

We ordered a plate of onion straws for the table - everybody dug in and munched on the crispy strings that were light and flavorful. Then we got down to the heart of the meal - open-faced turkey sandwich (oy! such comfort food!) with gravy and mashed potatoes on challah bread for the UK newbie.  He said it was to die for! Woody Allen (corned beef and pastrami) with sauerkraut and swiss for the hubby - the sandwich was so tall he had to eat it in levels! Bacon burger for the Frenchman - his usual, but it was yummy! Shammy (thick beef salami) on challah for the daughter - it was the 2nd time she'd had it and it was just as good. For me, I got the Schwartzy - beef brisket on a challah roll, which was flavorful, tender and just the right size. I ordered apple pie and was told it was just like my Jewish mother used to make, but was disappointed when it came.  Crust was kind of thin, too much cinnamon, but the ice cream was really good.  The owner saw my distress and sent a FREE piece of red velvet cake out to me, which was pretty good.  I'm trying the devil's food cake next time. The portions are HUGE and we shared around the table, so I got a taste of several things so I can try something different on the menu next time - it's probably gonna be the matzos....and maybe the knishes. The owner was a bit snarky, but I think it's just his way - after all, he DID give me free cake!

But the worst thing about this place?  Being in the same vicinity of the inane manager/owner.   The first time I went to ECD, my friend and I were seated by this table of 30 something guys who were loud and obnoxious.  They kept barking orders at the wait staff and saying goodbyes across the room to people they knew like it was closing time at some college bar.  My friend and I were like 'um where's the manager to tell these hipster doofuses to shut it' - ahh oh wait - the guy in the ripped up jeans with the backwards cap occupying that front table? He is the manager/owner. Um how about clearing out from that prime table space for - oh I don't know - customers? And if you have to sit there with your buds/bros (as I believe thats what they were calling each other) keep quiet!  We also came to learn that all those 'reserved' tables in the front? Oh not reserved for anyone in particular (at 3 o'clock on a sunday!? no!). No, they are to dolled out by the manager/owner as he sees fit - why? Why seat everyone in the back away from the windows?!  This policy really didn't affect us the first time because the table we were seated at had just been cleared (no time to put the sign on! Ha! Suckers.); however the 2nd time we went to ECD? Yea seated in the back at the dreaded kitchen tables.  (Why do these tables even exist? Who wants to sit with the cooks at a DINER? Not me - thats who.)  So here we are...seated in the back...helping cook our own food - when here comes the wait staff!  They all sit down around my friend and I - while were eating - and start talking over us about their tips and how they're going to tip out.  Needless to say; the meal was over at that point. So with 17 waiter/waitress surrounding us - guess how long it took to get the check? That's right - 20 mins. So as we're walking out - guess who's sitting at that front table - yep the manager - head down - taking a...nap? (uh - can I sit there?)   Bottom line: This place is obviously trying to be something it's not.  The prices and the food don't match and the place is run like some kind of personal club house of the manager/owner.

2009-06-05,3.0,"This is my first review. I'm a connoisseur of delicatessens and fine Jewish food, especially quality pastrami. From Amer's in Ann Arbor, to Katz and Carnegie Deli in NYC, I have had many of the most delicious or popular deli sandwiches around. I had the pastrami reuben, on challah bread, to go. The order service was quick, the food preparation was moderately slow, and the payment was moderately slow. The reuben came with house fries, which were nothing special. They were slightly soggy, lukewarm, not salty enough, and just very boring and detracting from the meal. The reuben itself was presented very well. It was open faced and cut into 4 pieces. There was a healthy serving of melted swiss cheese, not enough sauerkraut, a moderate amount of pastrami meat, and not enough Russian dressing/thousand island.  The cheese was topped with some paprika powder (I don't know why). Usually a healthy helping of cheese is indicative of average quality pastrami. This was certainly the case here. The pastrami was non-eventful. It wasn't bad, but neither was it briny, juicy, and fatty. The pastrami was better than average, but nothing to excite yourselves over. finally, the challah bread was very good. They toasted the challeh, and it was light and eggy. I am not sure if standard jewish delis make their own challah or not. Finally, this was a very expensive dinner. I don't mind paying 10-15-20 for a pastrami reuben since Jewish delis tend to charge excessive prices (I wonder why), but the portion size of the sandwhich was small, and the amount of pastrami was just moderate. $13! Conclusion, would I go back? Sure, if am nearby, and very hungry for a pastrami reuben, I can see myself eating there again.

It's absolutely amazing and comes with a bagel of your choice, plus cream cheese, fresh cucumber, onion, and tomato slices, and kalamata olives. YUM. Also, their coffee is quite good! A bit ago, I went back there with my best gal pal for a little soup and chit-chat (gurl talk). I had not been there in a while. The owner/restaurant manager was walking by and stopped to say, ""you haven't been here in a while, have you?"" He'd noticed that I came often and that I had not been there in a while, which made me feel like a ""kinda-somebody"" celeb-type. Haha. I smiled and responded that no, I had not been back in a while, and confirmed that I had visited with more frequency in the past. I did NOT, however, tell him that the reason I stopped coming so frequently (Sunday mornings for brunch was my tradition) was because of HIM. He's just so LOUD and OBNOXIOUS with his yelling all over the place. I mean, I know it's loud on weekends during brunch/lunch, and I know that you have to raise your voice so your employees can hear you, but seriously, some of that yelling is actually unnecessary and seems totally gratuitous.  I took another friend here one Sunday. I told her the place was great and the food was great and that she had to try it, so she came with me. Unfortunately, the owner/manager was there on that day. Oy, and he was yelling up a storm! My poor friend couldn't even hear what I was saying to her because, not only was it noisy in there (because it was so busy), but this dummy added his racket to the milieu and made the whole experience less pleasant. Generally, the staff this guy hires has always been great, with one exception, but that girl was probably fired shortly after. At least, I never saw her again. She was just awful. I've read some of these reviews with almost unbelievable stories about the owner/restaurant manager's behavior. But given what I've observed about him in the past, I wouldn't be surprised if he DID do all those things they've written about. He's NEVER been rude to me though. My only complaint is his loud mouth. Gosh it's loud! (Loud enough to be the focus of THIS review!) Otherwise, the food is GREAT. You won't find real American food (with lots of Jewish-American goodies) like this at other diners, and surely not in the South Loop. However, I'd say you should probably go when it's less busy, like during the week, early, or before/after their lunch or dinner rush.

She had been there before and kept telling us it isn't like any other diner, and boy was she right. This place was simply amazing, especially for a bunch of Jews.  Although this place isn't kosher, it has tons of Judaica stuff all over the place. They have He'brew beer displayed everywhere and also sell Heeb magazine. We showed up and there was a bit of a wait, but I will definitely not let this hurt the review. The guy taking down the names (I believe he was the owner), about every 10 minutes screamed out the current waiting list and where you stand on it. This was very nice, because you always wonder how much longer you have to wait. He also kept offering to let people buy drinks while waiting, and then just throw it on the check. While waiting the owner spotted me playing with my Chai necklace and asked the woman next to him to bring me over a complimentary issue of Heeb magazine. This was completely unexpected and appreciated. It's the little things like this that make me feel welcome at a place, and feel like the place understands that they need to treat the costumers right. Once we finally ordered our food, I was shocked by the size of the omelet. I am not quiet sure how they make it, but it was definitely the fluffiest omelet I have ever seen. It was huge and it was full of flavor. The place was a bit pricey, but the food and service was great so it was worth it.

Fries.  The sandwich didn't come with anything else so I ordered fries. Not horrible, but nothing special whatsoever. 3. Cherry Pepsi.  Pepsi with cherry syrup.  I had two, they are fantastic and she refilled it for free. 4.  Plain old cheesecake was awesome.

The host staff was all over the place too.  The guy running the show seemed put out that I wasn't interested in a corner counter seat, and quoted me a twenty-minute wait as if he were trying to convince me to leave.  (The wait was ten minutes, as it happened.)  But the lovely young woman who seated me was beyond pleasant and asked me if I would like a newspaper or magazine to read.  I have eaten hundreds of solo meals in all sorts of venues, and I have never heard this before.  What a nice touch.  She seemed pretty young, so perhaps she hasn't yet been spoiled by the sour example set by her colleagues.

When the waitress brought the bowl over, I noticed lipstick on the rim.  I asked her if she thought it was lipstick, and could I have another bowl.  She cocked her head and didn't say anything, but took the bowl away.  She brought me a new one, but there was no acknowledgement that she had tried to serve me in a dirty dish. My most recent experience is the reason for this review.  I went to Eleven City Diner today for lunch with two friends.  When we arrived, the restaurant was very crowded, and as they do not take reservations, we were prepared to wait.  We gave our name to the owner, Brad, and took our place by the wall to wait the quoted 15 minutes.  While we were waiting, Brad continuously yelled across the waiting crowd to check on groups, yell at new people entering the restaurant, etc.  He called our party's name a number of times, and eventually said there were two parties ahead of us.  After waiting thirty minutes and seeing five parties get seated before us (after he told us only two were ahead), we were finally seated in the kitchen area.  The wait service was acceptable and the food was good, however many items that we ordered or that came with our meal did not arrive (avacado added for the turkey club, no toast with the tom waits breakfast, mayo left on the sandwich after requesting on the side).  During our meal, Brad walked up to the kitchen and began loudly berating an employee in front of 6 tables of customers.  Our conversation stopped, and many other customers were looking as it was very appalling and disruptive.  After we were finished with our meal and the table was cleared, we were finishing our drinks and our conversation.  Fifteen minutes after our table was cleared, Brad showed up abruptly at our table to say that he could offer us a meeting room upstairs if we wanted to continue our conversation.  Our waitress had not made us feel rushed or asked us to leave, so this was unexpected.  We said we were preparing to leave, and he reiterated his offer and said he would be back to check up on us - twice.  When we left, a member of our group told Brad that he wouldn't need to come back to our table because we were leaving.  He said very rudely ""you were at that table for an hour and a half.""  We weren't aware that there was a time limit, especially when there were no parties waiting at the front for a table at 2:15pm on a Friday.  When our friend tried to respond, he got in her face and said ""we're done now; take it outside.""  He said ""I don't care where you're from or who you are.  You can leave now.  I don't expect to see you again.

I've witnessed more drama between Brad and the staff than I can recall.  Some of the memorable bits include dressing-downs of the hostesses in front of the large waiting weekend crowds, screams lobbed across the restaurant, and awkward, unnecessarily confrontational encounters between Brad and customers confused by his many rules. The rules themselves: all parties seated together, absolutely no lunch before noon, no soup before noon, no ""joiners"" as I learned, strollers tightly regulated, tow zone strictly enforced by Brad, staff to cry ""HOT SOUP!"" as often as possible, preferably when they have no hot soup, undesirables sit in the kitchen area.

Once I ordered an omelet and when it arrived, it was sitting in a pool of butter. It was completely inedible because it was so saturated with butter.  And don't get me wrong, I love me some butter.  But holy crap, I'm convinced they were trying to kill me, send me into cardiac arrest, something. When the waitress came back to check on us, I politely mentioned the grand canyon of butter and instead of taking it away she laughed it off.  ""Ha, there's nothing wrong with a little butter.""

2009-01-04,1.0,"Alright I'm gonna sum up my review this way: overpriced, average food, horrible service.  1st visit: So I went there with 2 other friends and my gf. We were greeted by an overly energetic host who quickly took our names for a table. We were offered drinks to sip on while we wait. The actual wait wasn't that bad. So far so good. There's a sign on each table saying that they don't automatically bring you water because they're trying to be environmentally conscious and save Earth's natural resources. I thought that was unique.  As one of my friends was trying to order a breakfast dish, she asked if she could substitute pancakes for toast. Now this is a simple request I believe. The waitress looked at her like she asked her a rude question or something. She then quickly added that no substitutions are allowed and that instead she could get an order of pancakes separately. At this point my friend said she didn't want the pancakes and just the breakfast dish as is.  The food came as ordered except a plate of pancakes arrived as well. Apparently the waitress thought we wanted it anyway and punched it in. That wasn't a big deal so we just left it as is. Once we finished our food or near done, they started clearing the table like it was a banquet hall. My friend had to tell one of the bus boys to leave the plate because she still wasn't done.  When were all done another older man came and started clearing the whole table of everything. The bad part was that the table was long so he couldn't reach everything comfortably. So he had to lean over in front of us while we were talking. I understand if he did this one time but he did it about 6-7 times because he would only grab one thing at a time. So for about 5 minutes we were constantly interrupted by his cleaning of the table. This could have easily waited until we had left.  The food was average but not anywhere near as good as the price suggests. Breakfast dishes range anywhere from $8-14 for something you could get as a much bigger portion at Golden Nugget for $6. Story#2 Now since the first time wasn't that bad I decided to go there again with just one of my friends. There were only two of us so we were seated in about 10 minutes. Now I was wearing my sweat pants since I wanted to feel comfortable. After all it's a diner not a fancy steakhouse. I guess that matters because we were seated at small table right next to the order/bill station where all the waiters and waitresses punch in the orders. It was really annoying because as I was eating I had someones arm about 6 inches away from my face punching stuff in on a screen. Not to mention that this time we were seated on the other side, basically right in the kitchen. So I feel there is some discrimination as to where you are seated in this restaurant.  The food came out relatively OK this time, nothing to brag about, basically forgettable. The thing that got me this time was the service again. I had ordered a soup that came out before the main dishes. Now I finished it and left it on the table. But when the bus boy came to bring the food put the plates down. I was holding the soup bowl for him to take it and he started to walk away. So I said, you can take this too. He just ignored me and walked away. I left it there and when he came to bring a plate of toast he couldn't fit it on the table due to the empty soup bowl. Instead of taking the empty soup bowl off the table, he kept trying to push it with the toast. When he kept struggling my friend took the plate and put it on the table and then pointed at the soup bowl and said we don't need that anymore. Only then did he take the empty bowl.  Now I've had bad service in a lot of restaurants, namely Chinatown. But I deal with it for good food and cheap eats. But here the food is expensive and there is a pompous attitude that everyone who works there seems to carry. The whole place is full of itself. I wanted to like it since it was one of the few locations in the south loop. But I will never go there again. Stay away. You're better off at White Palace Grill.",0.9917,0.865,0.093,0.041,0.48712177579365074

We went for brunch today with some friends which prompted me to check out the consensus on yelp and I'm glad to see the overall feeling is positive. The first time we went there, I happened to be wearing my Chrome Hearts Star of David necklace which was recognized by the owner Brad who gave me a little nod and had his mom walk us to the ""green room"" - a separate little waiting area by the kitchen. This allowed us to skip the 45+ minute wait and be seated immediately. Not sure how this will be looked upon by non-Jewish patrons, but ever since the first time I went I've never had to wait and also have chatted with others in the ""green room"" - not all have been Jewish, so I think its more for the regulars/friends.  I've been to ECD for brunch, lunch, and dinner - I generally get the Lox Box (typical Jew much?) for any meal I'm there for as the lox is always fresh, the bagels are good (by Chicago standards) and the rest of the trimmings are always great. I've tried a number of the other more traditional Jewish items - matzoh ball soup, knish, brisket, etc and while all of them are good, they're not fantastic. I do like how they have a special menu for all of the main holidays so if you aren't preparing a feast at home, its always a welcoming place to go.  The service is always a bit pushy/rushed but generally friendly. Brad gets a bad rep for his attitude towards patrons/servers, but since we've become regulars, I've always found him to be pleasant. His mom, Roz, helps out on the weekends and is a great ""typical Jewish mom"" who stops by tables to make sure everything is ok.  The menu isn't kosher by any means - ham and cheese omeletts, calamari, etc - you can pretty much get anything you want with the bonus of having NY Jewish deli style options which aren't as accessible in downtown Chicago.

Good thing our server Justin was awesome--he really did make the experience so much better.  He was on the ball with getting the coffee and cold drinks, that we were instantly placated--man we are easy.  They cup of Joe is pretty solid--very tasty & strong, just what I needed. The food is given in very generous portions--so go hungry.  For diner food, it is very high quality and very satisfying.  They have very long hours so you can get pretty much every meal there if you wish, however, I would recommend breakfast--oh, eggs, pancakes, sausage, and bacon--oh heaven!  Plus, if you like french toast--they serve up a mean portion of it and it is delicious.   If you do go, I would steer clear of going on mornings where there is any kind of race, walk, triathlon, etc.  Well, unless you like waiting a long time for food as there does not seem to be a plethora of brunchy places in the area.",0.9924,0.794,0.19,0.016,0.6330897435897433
2008-09-29,4.0,"Well, we all know I am partial to diner food...hence the generous helping of stars, with a side of sausage, eggs and diner-style charm.  My bit of advice for ECD: Whenever there is a large event (ie; Komen Walk, AIDS Walk, any type of walk), be prepared for LARGE groups, masses even, of people. There are very few brunch places in the South Loop. You and Yolk gots the market cornered, PLAN ACCORDINGLY! So, can you tell I waited a LONG time to eat at Eleven City Diner? I did. And I could be a bit more sympathetic had the place been jammed, but the reality is...they were just understaffed. I'd have been happy to have been seated with my party (Yelp Komen Cure Team, you guys rule!), drinking coffee and waiting...as opposed to sitting on concrete. We walked in after 1 hour (quoted 20 minutes) to a bevy of empty tables. My blood pressure spiked, just a bit... However, our server (and the food) saved the day. Ellen M commented that our server had ""good mojo"" and I'd be inclined to agree. Quick with the coffee (THANK GOD), water, Diet Pepsi, food, ordering, etc. Everything was prompt, and the ladies were all happy, myself included.  I had the tofu scramble with a side of sausage. Just because I order tofu doesn't make me a vegetarian! ;) It was pretty good, but the ""spicy tomato dipping sauce"" was basically cold marinara. No spice. Not very good, I'd have rather slathered ketchup on it, honestly. That's what I usually do anyway.  Love the decor, love the idea, love the diner.

We had a party of 7 and expected a wait, since there aren't a ton of brunch options in the area. We were told 20 minutes, but waited over an hour. What bothered us was: (1) couldn't they give us a more realistic wait time and (2) they kept seating parties of 4 when tables opened up instead of holding it and pushing 2 together. When we finally were seated upstairs we were a little shocked and perplexed to find the ENTIRE dining area up there had been empty the whole time. Aside from the wait it was a great dining experience for the following reasons: (1) Our server. I don't remember his name, but he was fabulous. He was quick with the coffee, water and other caffeinated beverages.  He was very friendly, made a few helpful suggestions, and checked on us regularly to make sure we were doing good. Well done! (2) Our food. The food was yummy, I think the only disappointment may have been the matzoh ball soup someone ordered. (3) Challah French Toast. Two of us got this, I got mine with berries and whipped cream. It was fantastic! I'm not usually a huge french toast person, but devoured this. They give you 3-4 heaping slices, which I couldn't finish. The only critique is that it was nearly impossible to get a bite with any blueberries, those little suckers kept rolling off my fork. (4) The atmosphere. The place is cute, there are stacks of Bazooka gum boxes and Green River bottles in the window. We sat upstairs and were a bit out of the mix, but got some lovely, straight out of 1976, mustard colored leather chairs on wheels. What they lacked in visual appeal they made up for in comfort. Bottom line: This is a great NYC-style deli joint, with real New York bagels and kosher pop to boot. The menu is huge, the portions are generous and it's right near the Roosevelt L stop.

I had the Patty Melt with fruit (the server originally brought me fries instead after I had asked specifically for fruit and then had to go grab it - and took my beautiful sandwich along with him to do so).

And then she ended up waiting several minutes to get her non-toasted plain bagel. Like people have been saying, the service is ridiculously slow and our server was not attentive.  The manager/owner did ask us how our food was and we told him straight up what was wrong with it, but all we got was lip service - ""it's been crazy busy,"" which was not the case as the restaurant was NOT full.

2008-04-03,3.0,"I've come here twice for breakfast during early evening hours.  Already winning points for serving breakfast all day, it does an excellent job of giving customers the old Jewish diner feel... not that I can recall ever being in one.  The menu may be sparse and/or alarmingly expensive for some.  Food is good, w/ minor gripes; and service is mediocre at best.  We've had to remove percentages from tips on both occasions. My first visit to Eleven City was with a friend from the Netherlands on the quest for pancakes at 5 p.m. on a Sunday.  We drove by Melli's, Orange, Maple Street Cafe, a few miscellaneous hole-in-the-wall diners, and already ate at Lou Mitchell's that morning.  All were closed or out of reason.  He insisted we settle at Starbucks and end our search.  No way!  He's already been to several New York Starbucks', so why add one more?  We finally came across Eleven City Diner. The host immediately seated us.  Our waitress was sassy, and short with requests and questions.  I don't know if this was part of the diner atmosphere, but we felt she was unaccommodating.  On my other visit, my fiancee and I had another early evening hankering for breakfast.  My fiancee leaves to the bathroom and comes back.  Our waiter immediately asks if we want to order or had any questions.  We ask a question, and pretty much get pushed to order on the spot.  We oblige.  Overall, we felt our waiter was a little aggressive or just kind of antsy.  Coincidentally, my stern waitress from the previous visit was extremely helpful when I asked a couple of questions about those delicious-looking cakes at the counter -- I asked about them on my way to the bathroom.  We were having a nice conversation until my waiter chimed in and extolled upon his recommendation for the chocolate cake.  No insult taken this time, especially since his recommendation was RIGHT ON! On both occasions, the food was nice to look at, big, and tasty... but expensive to maintain ::insert thoughts here::  Items ordered: -Three eggs any style with choice of one meat (ham, sausage, or smoked bacon), 2 slices of buttered toast (rye, wheat, or white), jam, house potatoes - $9.95 -- Afraid of overcooking, I never ordered scrambled eggs from diners.  But I took a gamble this time.  They were surprisingly delicious.  Fluffy, not too wet/dry, not too buttery, a little firm, but damn near perfect.  My 3 sausages had good flavor, but were just a tad too greasy.  A little more bite would have been better.  Toast was served on a separate small plate and made with good, fresh bread.  Lightly-buttered side facing down.  Two jams were included (Smuckers plastic containter quality).  House potatoes were lightly seasoned, starchy, served in a surprisingly small portion, but pretty good.  Even though a side of sausages is priced at $3.25, Three Eggs Any Style with no meat is $5.95, and with meat is $8.95, I was mysteriously charged $9.95...hmmm.  Too bad I didn't notice this until I wrote this review. -Eleven City French Toast - $9.75 -- Recommended by the host and both servers.  Eh.  It's challah French toast served with strawberries, bananas, and toasted coconut.  It sounded great, but all of these flavors combined with maple syrup just didn't mesh well.  More powdered sugar would have been good.  However, the actual French toast portion with fruits scraped to the side was GREAT!  Of course this inspired me to order an unadorned version on my next visit -Challah French Toast - $5.95 -- Ahhh.  One of the cheapest items on the menu.  Sure you have the option to fix it up with chocolate chips, banana and pecans, berries and whipped cream, or Eleven City style (see above), but leave my s--- alone.  It's cheaper, and I definitely prefer the no-frills version.   Perfectly buttery, eggy, soft, and a balanced wet/dry ratio. -""Holy Abraham!"" chocolate cake (not the actual name) - $6.95 --  This cake was recommended by all 3 of the employees I encountered, too.  The only difference between this and the Eleven City French Toast, is that I thoroughly enjoyed this one.  This slice of heaven is the perfect remedy for emotions after a harsh breakup, losing a job, or just because you love chocolate!  It single-handedly encapsulates most elements of my ideal chocolate dessert.  I love my chocolate in almost every way, shape, or form... just not too sugary!  Picture this: chocolate ganache exterior housing, 4 layers of fluffy chocolate cake alternated with thinner layers of bittersweet chocolate mousse.  An extremely light schmear of rum-chocolate mousse sits on top right before the ganache, and a thicker schmear is on the rim before the ganache, too.  Too good for a bad visual description.  Just go try it!  Feeds two, one for a meal, and recommended for consumption with your favorite beverage (milk, coffee, tea, etc.) Milk -- $1.75 for a small ass glass...wtf? 3.5/5 -- I just can't bear to give 4 stars to a restaurant with service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.",0.9986,0.784,0.158,0.058,0.5080082615796901

2007-11-20,1.0,"The food is average.  If it were reasonable priced it might be worth it, but for 12 dollar sandwiches it better be pretty damn good, and it was average or below. The real negative for this place is the owner.  I went for the first time yesterday, and was interupted from my meal with screaming, real screaming.  It was a young, well dressed guy, yelling for food.  I, at first, wasn't sure who this was, a crazy guy let out from the nearby hospital district, or a manager, or what?  I asked my waiter who informed me it was the owner, Brad.  Brad has little notes on the table telling about his inspiration for opening a diner.  The note doesn't mention his desire to power trip and walk around his restaurant like he is the king of chicago and shit on his employees, but perhaps it should've.   The yelling got worse, he berated my waiter in front of my table for several minutes b/c he wasn't going fast enough.  He was yelling at the food prep guy to go faster, in his face.  I felt like I was back at the Frat house during hell week.  I tried to ignore it, but he would walk back through and yell, "" where is the Goddamn Polish Sausage!""  The thing of it was, these guys were working their asses off...furiously, I assume to avoid getting more shit, or perhaps beaten later? The gal sitting next to me, was like, "" you know what, i stopped coming here for a long time b/c of that guy, but today I decided to try it once more""   So...... I actually liked the place in a way, the ambience, the decor, the name of the place, I wanted it to become a go to place......So, I decided to give Brad some feedback, to benefit him, and let him know that in general diners probably don't want to hear aggressive, mean spirited yelling in their face in the morning.  So, I approached Brad, who was all smiles for the customers and to me, until I said, I would like to give you some feedback.  He immediately began to walk away nearly before I could get any words out.  ""it's a diner pal, it's diner pal, that's how it is""  as he walked away.  I said, ""well, still it isn't so nice to see you attacking your staff, nor do i want to hear you yelling in my face for orders"".  He said, "" well, i trust you won't be coming back"", I said, "" yes, it is unlikely"".   Is that how you would've responded as an owner of a relatively new restaurant?  No apologies, no thanks for the feedback, no, how can i make it up to you, just, ok, dont come back. I have been to many diners, I am not sure what that means, ""it's a diner""?  Are diner owners egomaniacs with mean streaks?  Are diner owners supposed to wave their hands and scream loudly in front of their patrons in order to show them their self worth?  This guy obviously has some problems.   And since when do diners charge 12-15 dollars for a sandwich? Bottom line.  Weird, egomaniac, semi-prick owner with marginal food in a (nice place-nice decor) with inflated prices....you choose.",-0.9766,0.74,0.11,0.151,0.5015414562289563

Eleven fits right in the middle, quite nicely.  However, the food in general is not exceptional, but is good.  In particular...they are capable of an excellent omelet, according to your own ingredient choices.  For me, this is the single best thing on their menu (though I'm not a real heavy Jewish deli guy).  So, I think it is great for breakfast, but just okay for lunch.  Be sure they don't sit you on the left side between the divider wall and the kitchen though...it is an unpleasant place to be, with poorer service to boot.

2007-07-22,5.0,"Okay. I'm Jewish. I didn't come from New York or Chicago or Israel or any heavily-Jewish fooded area ... I came from Nebraska. Maybe I'm easily pleased. Maybe I don't know good food ... because good G-d ... this place was the most excellent eating establishment I've been to in Chicago in weeks, if not months.  After putting off dinner last night because of a series of unexpected delays ... we hopped off the red line and hit up Eleven City. The moment I walked in, I knew I was in love. The dark wood comprising the tables and the bar, the mirrors above the bar, the soda jerk, the wide expansive windows, the booths, the cake containers that line the bar with fresh bakery selections ... it looks like an incredibly classy diner, circa the 1940s. It's aesthetic is absolutely divine.  But nu? What about the food? Among our group of three we dove into the melts, the sweet and sour pickle appetizer, and a cherry coke (which was actually pepsi). The soda was THE perfect mix of all expected parts. The pickles were homemade and delicious, not to mention that it came with a pickled tomato, which I'd never had before! And for two bucks, that was a cheap appetizer that set the stage for the rest of the meal.  I got the Turkey Melt, served open-face style with the typical fixins. Except this turkey was fresh, cut right off the bird ... and contrary to many sammiches that are this fresh, the meat wasn't dry! It came with fries and coleslaw -- the latter being something I often judge an establishment on. As expected, their 'slaw was delicious! The fries were typical diner fries, nothing special, but the over all plate was worth the 9 or 10 bucks it cost. I couldn't even finish the sandwich! The two gents I was with are serious, hardcore food critics. The one (my boyfriend) is a food connoisseur, no lie, and can tell you just about everything about Italian cuisine you'd ever want to know. The other is a lover of food, and they both hail from California's coast.  One got the Moshe Melt, which consisted of a boatload of meats (ham, turkey) on fresh challah, which as it turned out was actually French toasted! The two passed the sandwich back and forth the whole meal over ... so it had, had, HAD to be good (I couldn't taste, it had ham! how sacrilegious to call it the Moshe!). Beware: The Moshe doesn't come with fries, but as my bottomless pit date admitted, he had no room for fries after downing all that meat. The other got Rubin's Reuben, named after the establisher of the joint. He dove in and pretty much inhaled the sandwich, stopping halfway through to say ""You know that feeling where you're full, but it's so good you really just have to power through so you don't leave a scrap on the table?"" Of course we knew. We were doing the same thing! The dining experience was excellent, the waitress was incredibly friendly, the crowd was casual (and included some Chicago PD, so that tells you it's GOTTA be good and not too expensive like some of these reviewers say!), and the food was excellent. Many say the place is overpriced. Truth be told, my boyfriend and I got out with only spending $24.00 (before tip) for the two of us. That included the drink, the appetizer and the sandwiches/fries. Our friend, who ordered the reuben and a PBR got out for $14 (before tip). For the amount of food you get, the price is expected and welcomed.  We're heading back -- maybe even this week! -- for some lox, matzo ball soup and breakfast. It impressed us that much, folks. Give it a go! As your bubbe always says: Nu!

No comment on the owner of the restaurant. He doesn't seem to remember his regular customers even if he'd just had a long conversation with them the day before (anyone else 2nd this opinion?) Most of the food is very good: Chocolate phosphate, chopped liver (my grandma thought it was better than hers), monte cristo, Ruben's Reuben, and matzo brie.

Also, a counter selling jars of candies and bazooka gum (which to John's disappointment, contain jokes written only in Hebrew.) The menu was interesting and largely (if not all) Kosher. There was a potato latke with apple sauce, and a breakfast named after Tom Waits. The swively chairs were sturdy and comfortable. The food was great.
