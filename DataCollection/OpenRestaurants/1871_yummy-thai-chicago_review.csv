We agreed to eat our dinner selections family-style so that we could try everyone's dishes.  Two people ordered fried rice dishes, one of which included pineapple and the other was ordered with a medium level of spiciness so you could see more red pepper flakes on that plate.  Another ordered the lad nar, a flat noodle dish with chicken and broccoli that was fine.  Originally I wanted to order a duck dish but was informed that duck and salmon were both out that day.  Fortunately my second choice of Panang curry was tasty and not too spicy (I guess you could order the spice level to be cranked up if so desired).  This dish included chicken, bell peppers and basil in a creamy peanut and coconut milk sauce that went well with the bowl of plain white rice.  Overall all the food I tried was solid, and we probably ate 98% of all the food served to us so that's a good sign.  Service was prompt and pleasant, and the prices are all fairly reasonable.  We all agreed that the food lived up to the restaurant's Yummy name.",0.9852,0.865,0.135,0.0,0.45351473922902497

Apparently authentic Thai food (per reviews) Now keeping in mind that both me and my friend have spent a few years in Asia including Thailand, I knew what to expect for ""Authentic Thai food"" Here goes the review Food 2.5/5 - not really ""authentic"" as reviewed by few. Food was palatable but nothing remarkable about it. Fried tofu was stale. Green curry was spicy but not much else flavors to it. Tom yam noodle soup felt too ""watered down"" being neither tangy nor spicy. The zing was missing. Service 4/5 - this is where the restaurant scores. Servers are exceptionally polite.

The only thing I was a little disappointed about was that I told the woman over the phone that I was ordering for 10 people and could I please get something thrown in for free? She said, Sure! I'll throw in some eggrolls for free! They gave us 2 little eggrolls as part of the complementary extras LOL! Oh well, I can't really complain. Free is free, right? Anyway, we ordered a variety and everything was a hit! Crab rangoons: it was actually still pretty crispy and warm by the time we got it! Perfect with the sweet and sour sauce. Papaya salad: I love the crunchy texture and the tangy sauce. Complementary to all the other hot, carb-y dishes. Basil fried rice: Just your basic fried rice, imo. Thai fried rice beef: I like that there's pineapples in here! Beef pad see ew: This was just your basic wide noodle, too. Pad thai with tofu: The tofu was a nice change from all the other protein. Spicy crazy noodles: Definitely order this one if you're not sure which noodle dish to order. The flavors are awesome, and I love the ground chicken in it more than the other way that they cook their chicken (which leaves it pretty dry).

The server gave her pad thai with no meat and no vegetables even though she specifically asked for only vegetables. The taste was below average. We ordered the vegetarian spring rolls, and there was nothing in there besides cold cabbage and a few pieces of carrot. Worst spring rolls ever. I ordered orange chicken, and it was extremely oily. I couldn't eat more than a few bites of it. I'm a huge fan of orange chicken, and I've tried it at many places. This was by far the worst. Avoid going here at all costs!

I did finish the meat portion of the lunch, which was greasy, salty ground chicken and unripe green peppers. It did have some scallions, which would have been great. Prices were average with seven bucks for entrees. I also had crab rangoon, which was average. Wrappers were too delicate and fell apart. Little or no crab in the crab rangoon.

When I used to work weekends, I would call as soon as they'd open (11am) to ensure I'd get my food by lunchtime but now, I stop by whenever I'm in the area.  Honest Opinions/Thoughts: -Prices are more than reasonable. -Food is full of flavor and they offer most dishes: ""Spicy"", ""Little Spicy"", ""No Spicy"".  -When dining in, service is more than attentive. Even when the place was busy. -When ordering take-out, they do require (usually) at least 45 minutes to 1 hour to make the delivery so if you're not patient or don't like waiting for good food, suggest another place. -Place isn't the biggest place to dine in at but usually doesn't fill up. I've never really had to wait for a table here.  -Definitely one of the best places to eat on Taylor St.  -Be careful how you order. Spicy means just what it says so if you're not a fan or not a really thai-foodie, play it safe.

The service is fast and our waitress was efficient. The portions are pretty big and most of us ended up taking home leftovers. It's also BYOB which my friends were happy about. Most everything is $6.95, with some dishes going up to $8.95.  Definitely worthwhile to go!",0.9905,0.75,0.237,0.013,0.5145989974937343
2011-02-10,3.0,"You know what they say: Grocery shopping on an empty stomach is a bad idea. Well, so is driving, because we ended up cruising Taylor Street like a couple of high-schoolers 'til we finally decided on Yummy Thai. Grumbling stomachs make for indecisive minds! Once sat, we needed a few minutes to look over the menu (indecisiveness once again rearing its ugly head) and let our server know just that. But, we didn't need all the time in the world! It took almost 15 minutes before someone came back to check on us. However, after we ordered our food came out rather quickly. For me: Siam Beef. I've never had this before so wasn't sure what to expect. Turns out, I'm not a big fan of crispy egg noodles and brown sauce. But the beef was tender, well-seasoned and there was a lot of it. A very generous portion for the money! My friend had the pad Thai and mentioned it wasn't the best she's had... but she did take it to go. Were our dishes yummy? Not convincingly so, no. But Yummy Thai certainly hit the spot on a cold, dreary evening and gave us the base we needed to start imbibing.

Everytime we call for delivery they have to ask for our address and phone number, which under normal circumstances is easy enough, but when you are dealing with someone that doesn't speak very good english it becomes a task. This could be fixed if they purchased a computer and some basic software that stores customer information by phone number. Next, their delivery time is almost always off. They say 45 minutes, however our food almost always comes in an hour to hour and a half which is unacceptable. Finally, the drivers and staff at Yummy Thai seem to not communicate well. The driver will come to our door asking for cash when we have already paid by credit card and vice versa.

2010-12-06,3.0,"Well, I think this should be more 2.5 stars instead of 3.0, but I'm feeling generous today, so I rounded up.  I've had the pad thai here and the pad kee mao.  The pad thai is just ok, they use extremely thin noodles, and the sauce is not very, well, saucy. The pad thai here is pretty average, but nothing wrong with that because 'average' pad thai beats 'good' linguini any day of the week.  The pad kee mao is... confusing...  How can pad kee mao be confusing?  for starters, there is no choice of meat because they use ground chicken in the sauce.  In addition, they use some non-typical veggies like green peas.  Green peas you say??? But surprisingly, the end result tastes pretty damn good and it has a nice sweet kick to it.  But I'm confused because this is called pad kee mao, but doesn't really look or taste like it, but it still tastes good... confused?  I am.  Wait, or am I.. OK, I am.  Or not. So in recap, the pad thai is average, but the pad kee mao is confusingly good.  So why the low 3.0 stars you ask?  Well, it's partly due to some of their service practices... when I first started ordering from there, I was within the delivery limits, but some time last year, they started telling me I lived too far, and they wanted to add on additional delivery fees.  I said ok.  So at first it was just an additional buck tacked on top of the delivery fee, but then the next time it would be an additional 2 bucks then once even an extra 3 bucks. No consistency, so I stopped ordering delivery from there and started ordering carry out.  No big deal.  Then they started charging me a buck extra for extra sauce in the pad kee mao.  That kind of tipped me over the edge in the wrong direction.  The folks seem nice enough that work there... but in this UIC area, there are Thai restaurants on every corner... and flavors are plentiful... if you want customers to keep coming back, treat them well.  There's an old saying, ""Don't Trip over Pennies to get to Dollars"".  Yummy Thai will still get some of my dollars, but not as many as they could have.",0.9923,0.754,0.17,0.076,0.501268115942029
