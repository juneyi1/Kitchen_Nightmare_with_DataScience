For the pasta dish, we rooted for the one with lamb (forgot the name) and it was freaking amazing. The portion was huge for the tapas style and very cheesy.

2017-08-28,1.0,"I've never written a bad Yelp review. But my experience at Quartino tonight was so unpleasant, it has unfortunately merited my first one.  I've been to Quartino a number of times. Until today, I would have given it a solid 3.5 stars. Pretty tasty food, good place for a group. I went for dinner with coworkers tonight and we were having a nice enough time - our server was very pleasant, food came out promptly, most of it was good (fettuccine alfredo was weirdly soupy...).  Quartino always has a loud, bustling vibe but as we were nearing the end of our meal, the very large table of young men next to us had gotten so obnoxiously loud it was hard for us to even hear each other. They were drinking so much that we were surprised they hadn't been asked to leave. And keep in mind, this was a Monday night. One guy in my direct line of sight had gotten so drunk he was swaying and actually looked ill. You could tell he was about to throw up...and then he did. AT THE TABLE. It was absolutely disgusting. His friends just screamed and laughed and took videos of it, until finally some of them walked him outside. This was the very end of our meal, and now WE all felt sick just from watching this.  We asked for the manager who came over a few minutes later (meanwhile, the vomit still had not been cleaned up). He apologized and explained that the guy (and presumably others at the table - they were all being very friendly with the staff) is actually an EMPLOYEE!!  How unbelievably inappropriate to allow your employees to be overserved to the point of getting sick (at the table!!), in their place of work, while the restaurant is open and the dining room is packed with customers. Not only did it ruin our meal, it was SO unprofessional and shocking that it has completely turned me off from Quartino.  It used to be a go-to spot for group outings and work dinners.

Why I give this place 3 stars? The bread was dry and cold, no no no Quartino! BUT the highlights of our dinner were: -House Made Goat's Milk Ricotta served with warm honey (amazing) and REALLY good bread. The ricotta was so fresh, and so tasty with the honey. -Porcini and Truffle Risotto was to die for. Rich, thick, and flavorful!! Side note: the other two dishes we got were the Gnocchi with Pesto and the Cavatelli with Tomato Sauce. My girlfriend loved the gnocchi but I wasn't a fan of the gooey consistency. The cavatelli was also unsatisfying... not enough flavor. The dishes came out warm, but I like mine served straight out of the pan and piping hot.

The restaurant allows reservations which is nice, considering the wait was quite long Friday night. The aesthetic is nice however the restaurant is so cramped and very noisy. Our waiter was often never to be found when we wanted something and we had to flag down another waiter to get our order in and more bread. Also while there were four of us and we all ordered, they tended to be stingy with the bread -_- overall when we got our food nothing was remarkable, the vodka sauce was pretty good but the Alfredo was average.  Our waiter had told us everything was portioned as family sized so we expected leftovers, the portions were actually pretty small and we were left wanting more.

I prefer to drink wine out of a wine glass, so I was a bit skeptical when they served my wine in a small carafe with a little juice glass.  It turned out to be a great idea because you could only fit a few sips at a time in the glass, so I got a fresh pour every few sips.  Lame tangent, still relevant. We wore jeans and t-shirts, and sat at the bar, but everyone there treated us like royalty.  The bartenders were all super friendly and accommodating, and even the manager came and greeted us at one point.  Everyone made us feel very welcome there.

On a saturday night, at 7pm, make sure you have your reservations otherwise you will be waiting for a while. This is an Italian Tapas... small portions which were meant to be shared with your table. They had a huge wine list, various Italian sodas, coffees, and normal coke/pepsi. This place is a little big, our server was very friendly and accommodating but he disappeared many times and we only saw him for a few minutes at a time. Keep in mind that this is Tapas. The food will show us as it is finished so you will get random items at random times.  I ordered D'Anitra Pizze with Duck Prosciutto which is cured in house I beleive, with onion and wild agugula. Overall, the pizza had a nice flavor, was able to hold up to the ingreidents well without falling but it was a little charred on the bottom. Duck Prosciuitto was delicious and had a lot of good flavor and it was enjoyable.  Polpette al sugo di pomordo aka: veal meatballs in organic tomato sauce with fresh basil and homemade ricotta were very tender and juicy. The cheese was hidden but it gave it a nice balance to the overall flavor.  Polenta Fries left a lot to be desired. I expected them to be a little crispier and were a little bland.  Rigatoni was delicious. Pasta was nicely cooked, lamb sugo had good depth and balance. I did enjoy the stacciatella di burrata which is basically buffalo mozz.  Asparagus Risotto was very bland. Asparagus was a little rawer than I prefered. Risotto was lacking in flavor and depth. It was just mushed and wet rice. It was not creamy.  Broccoli Rabe was bland and I had to add some salt to it.  Braised Pork Shank was amazing. The presentation was basic but it was delicious and it allowed the meat to talk. Very tender meat and seasoned nicely. Fatty shank which gave it a good rich flavor that melt in your mouth.  Overall, the food was delicious but a few things were lacking. Some needed salt or more depth to it. I could see why this place was very busy but they almost need more servers otherwise you wont see your server for a while. The bill was a lot cheaper than I thought. It averaged to about 35 per person in my group and we all left with full bellies. I could see myself returning in the near future and it is a nice place to eat at.",0.9981,0.812,0.183,0.005,0.4955134680134679

Since I was solo, I chose to sit at the bar, first ordering a Negroni which I highly recommend.  Very nice!  I was unable to decide on a dish or two so at the suggestion of the bartender, I ordered three half plates.  My Gnocchi came out so fast that I told the server that it wasn't mine when he brought it.  I also had the Veal Meatballs Napoli and the Orecchiette.  All three were fantastic.

Our server was super attentive and came by often to check up on how we were doing.  The burrata salad came with burrata the size of my fist and beet salad.

Everything I've had on the menu is delicious.  From the homemade pastas to the in-house cured meats.  There is clearly hard work put into each dish.  I highly recommend the Tagliatelle a la Bolognese which provides a deliciously textured house-made noodle that is thick enough to hold a rich red sauce that is donned with a variety of meats, you will not be disappointed.  I have only had delicious things on the menu but usually cannot pass up the Bolognese.   The presentation of the dishes is sporadic and keeps your pace of eating at a moderate tempo.  Everything is brought out as it is completed in the kitchen so you can pace your meal to a unique food melody every time you go there.  Combine this with the tapas/family style approach where everything is shared and  you get a delicious well-rounded meal.   Finally, the Soccer Jersey clad service staff are always enthusiastic and knowledgeable of the diverse menu.  Almost every time I've been there a manager has come by asking how the experience is. Both are aspects of a restaurant I appreciate, and combined with the delectable and affordable culinary experience I can highly recommend this restaurant.",0.9922,0.801,0.194,0.005,0.702121212121212

The price isnt bad for a river north restaurant but my first time experience was not very pleasant. Second time we came for a friend's birthday since one of my friends was working there at the time we got special discount for the amount of food we ordered the price was great, and service was obviously great since my friend was dining with us there.

2017-07-06,2.0,"I am baffled at the vast number of high reviews for Quartino's. Want good Italian? You won't find it here. This place is a tourist trap. Chicago is home to so many great restaurants and is one of the top cities known for having great food, I mean, it IS the third largest city. So do yourself a favor - check out any restaurant other than Quartino's.  The restaurant itself is rather large. It is two stories and has tables indoors and outdoors on both floors. They pack in as many tables as possible so you will find that you are sitting very close to strangers. It is very loud inside - better luck dining outside where you can actually hear yourself think. Anytime I asked the waiter about a dish he would say ""oh I love it, it's amazing."" Yeah, lies. The bread SUCKS - don't even bother. Yeah, it's free and ""free food is the best food"" blah blah blah, but Quartino's bread is some of the worst food I've had. Quartino's states all their plates are meant for sharing. Hmm...okay. If we are meant to share the pastas...why are the pasta dishes so small? The size of one pasta dish here would satisfy your hunger but not fill you up. Their house-made pasta, the tagliatelle all bolognese, was awful. The texture of the pasta was just all sorts of wrong. The flavor of the meat sauce was no bueno. Think salty cardboard. How ironic that their imported pasta dish, the linguine with clams, was better than their house-made...but only barely. The flavor of the white sauce was decent and the red chili gave it a good kick but the flavors did not seep into the linguine at all. There were plenty of clams but were they fresh? Highly doubtful. The crisp calamari was expensive and average. I was really not impressed and extremely disappointed I wasted a meal at Quartino's during my 5-day trip to Chicago.

Food: They serve as soon as the food is ready so your dishes come out at different times which I personally liked since I was starving. We got the margherita pizza, tortellini with prosciutto, parppadelle al sugo, and truffle salame. Pizza was decent - thin crust and good balance of cheese and sauce. Tortellini was good but didn't amaze me. I will say the prosciutto was good and normally I don't like prosciutto. But the tortellini itself was lacking in flavor for me. Parppadelle was also pretty good although the meat was a bit salty to me. And lastly, the truffle salame was good from what my boyfriend said - not a salami person so I didn't try it! Service: Very fast which is surprising for how big and busy the place is. The server also was good about checking in but not so often to be disruptive.

2017-07-04,5.0,"Came here on restaurant week so we had a four course meal for $44 that left the two of us stuffed. Quartino is super popular but they take reservations. The inside is incredibly spacious and it was packed when we went on a Thursday night. Since there are so many people in one room, it was loud. Quartino offers a large menu that is great for vegetarians and it is also on the less expensive side. They have a large selection of pasta, soups, and seafood options. We started off with the polpette, which are veal meatballs in tomato sauce with fresh basil and ricotta on top. This was absolutely delicious and I cannot say good enough things except that you have to get this. The sauce was incredibly flavorful and the meatballs were soft and fluffy. Everything was perfectly seasoned and I found myself taking spoonfuls of the sauce because it was that good.  Next we had the tortellini, which was my least favorite dish. It came with peas, alfredo sauce, and prosciutto. I'm not a fan of alfredo sauce, so that could be why I wasn't a fan. The brodetto al frutti di mare was this giant dish with shrimp, clams, calamari, octopus and whitefish. It was similar to a soup with a rich tomato broth. Wasn't what I expected but I enjoyed it nevertheless. My favorite dish was dessert. They also have a large dessert menu so it was hard to pick just one. We ended up with the zeppole, which are hot Italian donuts. I was so surprised when they arrived because the plate was filled with donuts. Each one was perfectly light and fluffy. They came with honey and dark chocolate, which both complimented the donut so well.  With reasonable prices and so many dishes that it's hard to go wrong, I will definitely be back at Quartino!",0.9885,0.77,0.157,0.072,0.5567195767195767
2017-07-04,4.0,"Despite being on the busy State Street in the busy modern downtown of Chicago, Quartino Ristorante feels like a piece of Italy that has been imported from overseas! Even out in the outdoors street side patio with cars passing by, sitting there certainly reminds of my time at the quaint, slow living Rome thanks to the decor with very details (down to even the salt and pepper) that were obviously meticulously chosen to deliver the most authentic Italian experience in the midst of a bustling American city. The vibe alone was enough to win me over. One thing I found strange though was that all the waiting staff wore football jerseys (soccer in America) when no restaurant I went in Italy did that, but oh well. Anyway, more importantly, the food here is great as well and definitely adds to the Italian experience! Although slightly smaller than expected, my choice of risotto was on point with the taste and the texture. The rice was simmered well that it struck the perfect balance between soft and firm, and the creamy sauce was also perfection in delivering flavors to augment the rice without being overwhelming. You can definitely taste the high-quality ingredients that this restaurant uses! On the side note, I also love the olive oil that they use to accompany complimentary bread because of its nutty undertone. Okay, enough with the tangent! The prices are reasonable compared to other Italian restaurants (about $20 per person for entree and dessert), but the experience is well worth it. Despite of its high-quality food and well-decor environment, the restaurant is super casual so you won't have the pressure of fine dining. If you are seeking an excellent Italian meal with great vibe and good food in downtown Chicago, go to Quartino!",0.9978,0.737,0.243,0.02,0.4632244370616464

I liked it because it wasn't too greasy/heavy and was more on the healthier side. The other dish we got was the linguine pasta with clams. The pasta noodles didn't seem fully cooked, but we didn't feel like waiting for them to remake it. The clams, on the other hand, were SO GOOD. It had flavor to it and it was very soft and easy to eat. They also put a lot of clams in it, which was a big plus!

The mushroom risotto that the waitress said was the ""best thing on the menu"" was pretty much inedible due to salt content.

The last time she had been there, she found plastic wrap in her calamari. Instead of management comping the calamari off the bill, they gave her a free shot...wtf? Absolutely bizarre.

We were warned that the pizzas would take half an hour, but it didn't seem like it took 30 minutes before they came out. Here's what we ate:  - House made goats milk ricotta: really creamy and easily spread, I would definitely recommend this appetizer  - Gnocchi: the texture was okay, not as bouncy as I was expecting, the flavor was kind of lacking  - Stracci di grano arso: broccoli rabe (my favorite part of this dish), tomatoes, onions, garlic and large strips/sheets of flat pasta that I wasn't a huge fan of  - Margherita pizza: mozzarella, tomato sauce, and a basil leaf on top, it was pretty basic with a nice crispy thin crust  - Quattro stagioni pizza: artichokes, roasted peppers, grilled zucchini, portobello mushroom, I could eat this pizza all day! My favorite dish that we had here. I did have to eat it with a fork and knife probably because the ingredients  weighed heavily on the pizza and made it wet and harder to hold its shape, but it was very delicious  I liked that there were containers of water at our table so we didn't need to flag down our server, but when we needed him, it didn't take long, even though it was busy.

I've had some of the best food in Chicago while traveling the country so my expectations were high. We decided to sit at the seats by the bar... a regular high top. For an appetizer we got the goat cheese ricotta cheese, which was fine. Not the best I've had, but ok. We split 2 of their ""homemade"" pastas, lamb rigatoni and pappardelle bolognese, both honestly tasted like a mixture of whole wheat pasta and cardboard.

This restaurant is the closest I have ever tasted to any of their cooking.  They suggest ordering an assortment of plates to share around the table because the portions are ""small"", but I honestly thought they were the perfect size if paired with a salad or soup! I went with my parents and we ordered 3 dishes (1 per person) along with 1 soup and 1 salad and it was almost the perfect amount. We had a small amount of left overs to take home which were still just as delicious the next day.  They are open super late which is also really nice, so its a great option for a late evening. The service was also amazing as they provided team service (they each helped with each others tables) and we never went without empty glasses.

Anyway, we ended up grabbing a seat at the upstairs bar on the way to our table where we were greeted by Chris who was tending bar.  Not being up on our Italian cuisine, we asked Chris to help get us started with some meats and cheeses.  He did a wonderful job of helping us decide what we'd like to try as he served up some very tasty red wine Sangria.  In the end, he delivered a wonderful plate that we really enjoyed.  The duck prosciutto was to die for.  Everything on the plate hit a spot for us.  The Gorgonzola Dolce, the Asiago Vecchio was soooo good! We ended up wanting to try one of everything, but settled on a fennel sausage pizza.  It was delicious!  Still wanting to keep going, we ordered the Tortellini and the Rigatoni.  The Tortellini was covered in a great Alfredo sauce with peas and sat on a bed of Prosciutto.  I'm pretty sure that we would have licked the plate dry if the room was empty.  Our Rigatoni (with lamb) was equally delicious.   What really stuck a chord with us was when a manager (Michael) made his was over to say hello and ask how everything tasted.  Classy move.  We then noticed that they have a few managers who are constantly checking in with customers.  Then another gentleman walked over and introduced himself to us and to see how we liked everything.  Turns out it was Executive Chef John Coletta.  Who does that?  Clearly, it's people who are passionate about what they do day in and day out.   Do yourself a favor and make it a point to visit them.",0.9944,0.803,0.17,0.027,0.6222222222222222

We were able to get a table despite not having a reservation on a Sunday evening, even if it was all the way in the back of the restaurant. We had read all the reviews and were stoked to try this place as many people said the food was good. We started out by ordering a couple small plates - ordered the mushroom risotto, garlic shrimp, and a salad. The mushroom risotto was undercooked, the garlic shrimp was not like traditional garlic shrimp( I wish I could describe the shrimp dish but there are no words, also didn't help that they used tiny little frozen shrimp instead of fresh real shrimp), and the salad was overly doused in dressing. We let our waitress know we just couldn't bare to eat any of it. She was nice about it at least and offered to recook the risotto and offered to switch out our food for something else. We thought we couldn't go wrong with a pizza and selected one to share off the menu. While the pizza was edible, it was certainly far from being anything like a real Italian pizza.  We honestly couldn't take being there anymore and let our waitress know we just had to leave. We paid for our wine and the pizza and left. I will NEVER come back.

I always think a spritz sounds good, but per usual, they put so much ice and soda water that the end result is watery with barely any hint of aperol. The free bread is fine, but nothing amazing. I did like the olive oil in a groovy canister that came with it. The arugula salad ($9.75) was a nice pile of greens with a good amount of hazelnuts and slice oranges, oddly hidden at the bottom of the plate. The goat milk ricotta lacked flavor and if there was any of the promised farro, I couldn't find it. I also tried the burrata and roasted beets ($10.75). The burrata was beautiful and had perfect texture, but needed more salt. The beet presentation seemed odd to me. A few raw slices on the bottom of the plate lacked flavor (as raw beets tend to) and the roasted beets came in tiny little cubes. The dish needed some acid and salt to bring it together.

Although I ate in the bar, the restaurant looked quite spacious. For it being 4:30 in the afternoon, the crowd sure was lively. So the pesto dish I'm referring to is a gnocchi with potatoes, green beans, and arugula. I was a bit skeptical about the green beans but the waitress assured me that it's really popular that way in Italy...

First, the joint is huge...two floors with a constant relaxed movement. Walls of white subway tiles intermixed with fine wood panels and trim. A beautiful hand crafted bar and bar-back cabinets on one side. White shirted servers with aprons rolled at the waist deliver plates of meats and pastas to all points within. The ambiance is a throwback to Prohibition. Plates jostling and glasses clinking. I Close my eyes and any moment I expect to see ""Papa Johnny"" Torrio head of the Chicago Outfit sitting at a corner table twirling Tagliatelle alla Bolognese on the end of his fork as he quietly dines with Michael ""Hinky Dink"" Kenna one of Chicago's most corrupt politicians as they discuss their next bag drop!  We are delivered to that corner table just off the top of the stairs.  Our backs to the walls, we watch the evening move in front of us. Over the course of the next two hours we simply ""dine"" in the best sense of the word. Coppa and Prosciutto San Daniele, Taleggio and Pecarino Romano, Roasted Beet Salad and Giardiniera Romana and an assortment of red, green and black italian olives; plates of Tagliatelle alla Bolognese and Tuscan Sausage Risotto, a fine loaf of sliced ciabatta. All accompanied by a liter of Sangiovese IGT Santa Cristina - Toscana 2014. To finish the the evening a shared Coppa alla Banana - Caramelized Banana, Vanilla Gelato, Biscotti, Whipped Cream, Chocolate Sauce & Shavings.

2017-04-19,4.0,"Never been to an Italian style tapas restaurant. A local friend decided to take us out there during our first night in Chicago. I saw Chianti Classico on the menu and instantly ordered some for myself. My other friends ordered a 1/2 liter of Malbec from Argentina. I took one sip and instantly regretted ordering my Chianti.   We ordered a few tapas and shared them amongst the three of us. The concept is great. Only 1-2 appetizers are out on the table at a time. We started with gnocchi. The flavor was nice but to be honest it was over cooked and on the harder side. This was our least favorite item on the menu. Next came out the eggplant parm. Asides from it being on the saltier side., the taste was great. There was a nice balance of sauce and eggplant and the mozzarella cheese on top was melted to the right consistency. I was personally a huge fan of the dish.  Next we got the only chicken dish on the menu. This was my favorite dish we ordered (asides from dessert of course). The flavors were great and the chicken was cooked to the perfect temperature. I highly suggest this dish as well! We also ended up getting penne vodka and it was like any other penne vodka. Nothing bad or extraordinary about it. Tasted great.  For dessert we had tiramisu (not listed on dessert menu) and torta al chocolate, essentially a hot goey scrumptious chocolate cake served with gelato! This chocolate dessert paired really well with the wine!  Wish I was able to take pics of the food! We devoured everything so fast!

2017-04-18,3.0,"I had been to Quartino's several years ago, and I recall loving the experience. I have found it to be one of the more affordable sit-down dining options in downtown Chicago, and I love the tapas-style pasta manner (because who doesn't want to snitch bites off of someone else's plate?). Quartino's was literally a stone's throw away from our hotel, and the atmosphere and staff were warm and inviting. We had reservations so we were seated quickly - I definitely suggest making reservations, because even though the two of us came in on a Monday night, it was non-stop busy. It was our last night in Chicago so we pigged out and over-ordered. Our server was Miguel, and he was excellent: very attentive and kind without being overbearing. Their Italian sodas (we had the raspberry and the blood orange flavors) were absolutely delicious. The first pasta plate we split was the tagliatelle with Bolognese sauce. We are more used to the ground meat-type of Bolognese sauce (i.e., a mix of ground veal, pork, beef, etc.) and this sauce seemed like more of a shredded pork ragout. It wasn't bad but we did not love it. Our next shared plate was the porcini and truffle risotto. Again, this plate was a little disappointing, since I remember ordering it several years back with two girlfriends and we had LOVED this luxurious, rich dish. The risotto was VERY over-cooked, my daughter said it was too mushy. And every bite was oddly gritty, like the mushrooms hadn't been properly rinsed (it literally felt like I was crunching on sand). We next split the fettuccini alfredo and the sauce was extremely delicious and silky. HOWVER, the problem I had with both the tagliatelle and the fettucine was that both pastas were extremely chewy and dense (not al dente, but undercooked/chewy) and needed a heavier hand with the salt. I wanted to salt both dishes but resisted since this seemed sacrilegious...but someone back in the kitchen really forgot to salt the pasta water.  Our last shared course was the steamed clams and these were STELLAR. The broth was gorgeous and tasted delicious but unfortunately we were too full with the mediocre pasta dishes to fully enjoy this excellent dish! I really think this was an off night for the kitchen, pasta-wise. I still love Quartino's and I fully intend to come back the next time we are in Chicago. The total bill for TONS of food and two Italian sodas/refills was about $60 (before tip for the excellent service) which you will be hard pressed to top elsewhere downtown.",0.9979,0.78,0.193,0.027,0.5093137254901962

The rice was undercooked and the porcini mushroom dirt overpowered the dish. There were several gritty bites as if they put the rehydrated water into the dish and didn't discard the dirt debris. Lastly the gnocchi-it had undercooked potatoes and green beans that overpowered the dish and the gnocchi tasted grainy like it needed another minute to cook.

2017-04-06,2.0,"I was tasked with choosing a restaurant for my family to meet at for a quick visit & dinner.  Quartino was near my hotel and has great ratings on the usually reliable Yelp so I figured we'd give it a shot. The menu, and the idea behind the menu (Italian tapas!), both set my expectations very high.  We ordered 10-12 items off of the menu for our party of six and we all left very full.  With that said, none of us were very impressed...in fact, I'd say we were relatively disappointed, but fortunately hungry enough that it didn't matter too much.   I thought there was a real lack of seasoning pretty much across the board and, for an Italian joint, some really surprising issues with the pasta.  There's al dente pasta, and then there's way undercooked, gummy pasta.  The gnocchi and penne pastas were both waaaay underdone which resulted in very disappointing dishes.  The carpaccio was paired with something completely forgettable other than the fact that it wasn't a very good pairing(I believe radish?) .  The pizzas were bland with sparse, uneven toppings.   There were two good items we tried; the artisan sausage with peppers and onions was tasty, as was the duck prosciutto.  The restaurant was loud, tables were very close together, and as we were finishing our meal there was a busboy hovering which was not appreciated being this was the only time we all had to see one another.  Our waitress forgot to put in an order and was overall very, eh, kind of just going through the motions.   There is too much good food in Chicago to recommend this place...I have no clue how this has 4 stars on Yelp.",-0.9146,0.858,0.05,0.092,0.498949494949495

I had been out and about solo for quite sometime - exploring the zoo and my phone died so I couldn't uber here even if I had wanted to. I suppose I could have flagged down a cab but I stuck it out and nearly froze my fingertips off. Turns out Hermes is nice, but my gloves did nothing to actually keep my fingers warm in freezing temps and wind. As soon as I arrived, about 10-15 minutes before my reservation I asked the gals at the host stand if I could please have a table near an outlet if they possibly had one in the restaurant. They had a good feeling they did, walked to the table to check then back to get me and I was seated to thaw out my hands over a nicely lit candle on the table (on their front inside patio terrace area) and charge up my phone with their electricity! :) I really appreciated the service right from the start. Enjoyed a 1/4 Litre of their Donati Ezio 13 Cab and the following:   - Polenta Fries (the sauce was awesome the fries themselves ok, maybe not my fav version of polenta) - 1/2 order of their Baby Spinach salad (very good) - Pappardelle dish (very nice) and... - 1/2 order of their tiramiso (soooo good!)

2017-04-04,5.0,"One of the few small plates places I will continuously go back to in Streeterville! I think the whole small plate concept has become a bit overdone, and can often yield itty-bitty portions for a hefty price tag and mediocre food. Not Quartino! Everything I've had here has been delicious, from their meatballs to their fondue, salads, meats and even accompaniments with the cheese plates!  Some personal favorites: the fondue is a MUST!! It's sooo good!! It's a couple bucks up charge, but it goes great with apples!! I'm not a veal eater, but I will make an exception for their veal meatballs! The initial intrigue of this dish was that it has raisins and sun-dried tomato....weird, but it worked splendidly to the point where I'll set my ethics aside to eat a few of these bad boys! White bean and garlic spread is good! It's a simple dish, which sometimes can yield the best dishes. The short rib is also a must! It's hearty and very well-prepared! I love it!  Even their salads are worth ordering! The Brussels sprouts salad is my absolute favorite! It's super-light, but incredibly flavorful!! Love it!! The kale salad is pretty great, too. One of their cheese plates at one time came with green grapes with parsley, lemon juice and EVOO. Weird, right? Wrong!! DELICIOUSLY WEIRD! I've replicated it at home, because it was so yummy!  This place take a lot of pride in their attention to detail, variety in food, and more importantly, consistently tasty food!  A bottle of wine at this place is a must! Ask the wait staff if you're not a pro at picking wine; they know their stuff, and can usually make recommendations based on your palate. They also offer full bottles of wine, or a smaller amount (1 liter? 1/2 liter?)  This place can add up with the price of food, and does get quite crowded when all the tables fill up, but the food and great wine makes it a worth while trip!",0.9972,0.757,0.207,0.036,0.5264880952380953

All the pastas and desserts we've tried receive top marks. Our reservation that day was to celebrate a birthday (mine) but we had just lost a pet, and in no mood to celebrate. My husband convinced me that we should go, if only to get a momentary reprieve. I changed our reservation for a later time and apologized for the last minute change. I hadn't meant to mention anything else but the verbal vomit came out and it was too late to delete the message. The service here is always outstanding but that day, they went above and beyond.

2017-03-28,2.0,"I was planning a birthday celebration for my extended family (16 people) and Quartino Ristorante came very highly recommended.  After deciding that we wouldn't spend enough to warrant a private room ($2000 minimum) we booked a table in the main dining room for 6:30 on a Friday night.  Things started out poorly when our table wasn't ready when we arrived but a few of us headed to the bar to kill time (the rest hung out by the door...not the most convenient waiting area) and about 20 minutes later we were seated. Unfortunately, the table set up was more appropriate for 14 people than 16 so I went to speak with the host.  To their credit, they said that they would take care of things right away and about 5 minutes later, after a table next to us freed up, they pushed it over and we settled in, more comfortably this time. While a bit irritating, I put the initial issues down to the fact that we were at a busy Chicago restaurant on a Friday night...unfortunately, things did not get better.  I had pre-ordered 3 Salumeria tasting (antipasti) plates.  A few minutes after we sat down the first plate arrived.  Maybe 5 minutes after that, the second plate arrived.  Probably another 6-7 minutes later , the 3rd plate arrived. So it was almost 15 minutes before some people had food!  These were pre-ordered and consisted of a mix of charcuterie, cheese and assorted pre-made vegetable antipasti (which were good)...there was no reason that all of the plates could not have been prepared and delivered to the table at once.  Very strange. Then we ordered the mains.  The waiter warned us that the dishes would be brought out as they became available...which was fine.  That said, I was not prepared for the fact that my linguine with clams came out about 3 minutes later...and probably 7-10 minutes before anyone else got food.  I guess I could have understood it if everyone at our table who ordered linguine with clams was served at the same time, but that was not the case.  The best I could figure is that they had an extra one from someone else's order so they gave it to me. Needless to say I was finished before most people at the table were served. Again, all of this would have been forgiven if the food was good, but it was not.  My linguine was way over cooked and bland.  My wife's shrimp risotto tasted like lightly seasoned rice that they put a couple of shrimp on top of.  I had a slice of my nephew's pepperoni pizza and it could have been something from the freezer section.  My daughter said that her tagliatelle alla Bolognese was also meh.  I have been to Italy numerous times and I know what good Italian food tastes like...this was not it (To the people who have written Yelp reviews saying that this is the best Italian food in Chicago, I have news for you - it is not even the best Italian food in River North). On the plus side, the wait staff were competent and friendly.  They generously gave our table an extra pizza that was going to go to waste in the kitchen and they took a soda off of the bill that my young nephew ordered but didn't like. And the prices are very reasonable (most pasta and mains are between $11 and $15)...although the portions are not huge (the waiter said that things were family style but they were a little small to share between 2 people). Despite what I had heard about this being a chef-driven Italian restaurant, I would categorize it as more of a mass market Italian-American restaurant minus the overwhelming portions. Food is okay but not especially memorable...certainly not if you have ever eaten in a real Italian trattoria or enoteca.",0.9902,0.839,0.106,0.055,0.38900251952632914
2017-03-28,2.0,"We went here on a busy Saturday night. The place was packed. It was for a friend's bday. She liked this place a lot a few years ago. But unfortunately, it didn't hold up to expectations. Side note: they have a really bad waiting area. They should remove the two tables by the front and place benches here or something. There is no where to stand after you enter the revolving doors and it turns into a sumo wrestling match with servers, hostesses, people trying to get to the packed bar and patrons. Really bad setup that makes no sense. The people seated at the two front tables cannot possibly enjoy their meal because they have people standing right on top of them, and they have a door constantly opening letting in cold air in their faces. The food was mediocre largely due to a lack of seasoning. Everything was under seasoned including the gnocchi with arugula pesto and shrimp risotto. I have never had to put salt and pepper on everything that came out of a kitchen before, but we had to on 4 of our 5 items we ordered. The only thing that I'd consider to be really good were the dates (with pancetta I think). The short rib was OK but kinda tasted like pot roast.  Strongly suggest some sort of quality control on what goes out of the kitchen. There's no reason a risotto and a pesto should be under salted, those are two basic things that need a lot of salt in the kitchen. We have better tasting Italian food from a little joint in our neighborhood in Lakeview.

My friends and I were vacationing in Chicago and we came across this place through Yelp search. So glad we decided to stop by.  Everything was delicious from appetizers to dessert. To start off, we ordered the salumi taste board and the calamari. Both were two thumbs up. The calamari is addicting! One order just wasn't  enough. And so we ordered a second. The clam pasta dish was divine. We also tried their pizzas. My favorite is the duck prosciutto pizza with arugula drizzled in olive oil. I usually don't have room for dessert but I was glad the waitress suckered me into trying their beignets. They were fluffy and airy. Dip it in the chocolate dipping and you will fall in love.

What I didn't like so much, the veal skirt steak, the pizza, the calamari.  Most of the food was just okay to me. Nothing at all special. The pizza was fresh and had great ingredients, I know, but it lacked in flavor. It didn't taste like anything! The calamari was okay but the fried chunks were to big and there wasn't much of a crust because it was falling off. I was so excited to try the veal skirt steak! It was so tender but again no flavor whatsoever. It was so bizarre to me! Were we supposed to flavor the meat ourselves? Idk just not what I expected.  I think I will give this place another try since I came here on Valentine's Day and it was pretty busy. Everyone I know that has been here before loves it!

My family loved everything that we ordered except the polenta fries which I thought the restaurants signature thing. I should also mention we'd never had polenta before so maybe I'm not the best to judge. Also the dishes come out as they are ready,  not all at one, which I kind of liked. The only down side to this place is that is was so incredibly noisey (we went on a busy Friday night) we couldn't even have conversations across the table. We were literally shouting across the table and still couldn't hear each other. So to sum up, food was amazing.

Wasn't blown away by any of the things we ordered, to be honest. For the bruschette, I wish that they would've put all the toppings on each piece of bread instead of having just eggplant on one and mushrooms on another. It made it difficult to get a taste of each one and we ended up having to take turns taking bites. Sadly, the gnocchi was ended up being our least favorite. It was not light and fluffy like you would expect, and it would get stuck to the fork when we took a bite. The texture of it was totally off and tasted bland. Big disappointment (especially because it's a house made pasta). The only dish that we thought was worthy was the tortellini with prosciutto. Our server, Aldo, was great though.

You can choose three courses from a great variety of items including soup, salad, pasta, seafood, risotto, etc. As I have been here for many times, I would share my experience with the lunch special. I had the minestrone soup - fresh, light, and hearty. People speak highly about their tapas sharing plates and pizza. You know this restaurant is a good one when they offer good soup although it's not their big items; they pay close attention to prepare fine quality food.  Truffle risotto is good with strong mushroom taste. If you are someone who loves mushrooms. I'd suggest to try. Otherwise, I'd suggest asparagus risotto or shrimps one that are both amazing. Not every place cooks good risotto but you can definitely trust this place.  The biggest compliment this place wins my heart is their seafood. I particularly recommend their steam clam and combination seafood. My picture is the combination seafood. The sauce is great, the seafood is fresh, and the bread is buttery and crispy from the grill. I know Midwest is not the best for finding seafood but you can trust this place.

We grabbed some seats at the bar so we wouldn't have to wait and the bartender kindly greeted us and got us started on some drinks. We ordered the gnocchi, meatballs, and two drinks. The food itself was very tasty! We love tapas and small plates so if you're into ordering a bunch of small dishes, you should definitely check this place out! There aren't many Italian restaurants serving tapas - I'm so used to having such large portions! Overall the ambiance is pretty nice. The only downfall would be the priciness of everything. I understand that tapas are supposed to be small, so if you're serving small portions the portion-to-price ratio should be more even!",0.9619,0.867,0.133,0.0,0.48045112781954896

Glassware for wine was stinky. Eggplant parm had burnt cheese. The best part about it was that it was hot. Broccoli rabe was terribly overcooked.  Gnocchi was what my sisters wanted and it was the hardest pasta I've ever seen. Un-edible at best.  My son ordered pizza. I was mad at him for not wanting to eat it till my sister in laws had a bite and both said at the same time ""it tastes like cardboard"".  The best was the white bean spread.

Our entire table was trying to look into our laps. Wishing it would stop  it never stopped. She continued  and continued. It was embarrassing. I finally said ""I feel very uncomfortable can I have our check?"" She responds ""I feel uncomfortable,""  seriously woman get a grip. This is not about you.   We were not even upset we just had been waiting 30 minutes for a dessert that we asked to cancel. Instead of just telling us that they didn't have the dessert available they tried to give us tiramisu half an hour later. We didn't want tiramisu but were completely fine with nothing.  There was some serious timing issues on our food. We received most dishes and hadn't gotten our vegetable dishes 40 minutes later. I ordered a second beef short rib and hadn't gotten in 30 minutes later so I asked to cancel it.   All the food was spectacular.

Unfortunately there was no seating until 8:30pm unless we wanted to sit at the bar on a walk in first come first serve basis. We walked across the sidewalk to Embassy Suites where another Italian restaurant was super busy but the wait time was only an hour instead of 2 1/2. For what seemed like an eternity, we cancelled our reservation at the Embassy restaurant since there was over 3k reviews for Quartino which everyone seemed to be raving about.  Finally seated at 8:30, we ordered an app and soup each. The calamari was tender and crispy pairing well with the tangy marinara. He said the chicken with risotto soup was tasty. I had the minestrone soup which was a bit different. Full of white beans and no tube shaped macaroni. While still quite delicious, where the frick were my macaroni noodles? Did they forget it or was it Quartinos take on minestrone? Super speedy service and entrees were delivered quickly to the table. The bread was rather stale and nothing to write home about. They also think a 750ml water for 2 will do when the entrees are a tad bit salty. Rigatoni was not al dente, but rather undercooked as the kitchen was trying to spew out orders and the ground lamb was minimal as can be. The papparadelle was also undercooked and 1 long ribbon was drenched in stew like consistency topped with unforgivable Kraft Parmesan instead of fresh cheese cranked beside your table. Portions were on the small size even though the waitress insisted on how gargantuan the meals were and how most people share. I left still hungry after an appetizer, soup, and my 1 ribbon of noodle.

The only flavor in the tomato sauce was tin; no garlic, no oregano, not even a tomato flavor; completely bland.  The tiny meatball was flavorless, chewy and dry.  My Italian relatives would be embarrassed to serve this food.  My husband's Bolognese sauce was equally bland.  The pasta in both our dishes was unremarkable.  We're local and we gave this place a second chance.  If you want good Italian go elsewhere.  Even Magiano's, a national chain, is better.",-0.506,0.795,0.092,0.113,0.4807142857142857

2016-12-11,4.0,"Tapas, Italian style! This was our first time at Quartino's, and it certainly won't be our last. We were seated at a small table in the room that fronts State Street. The room was dark, cozy, and intimate-the perfect ambiance for our date night. I suggest trying to get a table in here! It's better than the main dining room, in my opinion. We started with the dates wrapped in pancetta, delicious. Next was the wild arugula salad. It wasn't bad, but I was a tad underwhelmed. I was hoping there would be more farro. We then had the duck prosciutto. The prosciutto itself was great--salty and savory. It was served with a small pickled vegetable salad that was overly spicy and honestly, unnecessary. The shrimp dish was good, but the shrimp was overcooked. They weren't tender, as shrimp should be.  Now onto the highlights of the meal: pasta!! We had the tortellini and the orecchiette. The tortellini was served with Alfredo, parmesan, peas, and prosciutto and was literally to die for. It was clearly the highlight of the meal and one of the best pasta dishes I have had in quite some time. The orecchiette was served with a fennel sausage ragu and complimented and contrasted the tortellini well. Also, the pasta dishes here are quite large. I would say they are more entree sized than tapas sized. And then dessert. If you are going to get only one dessert, get the Gran Coppa Quartino. I'm assuming it's what they're known for. It's vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate gelato served in a martini glass with fresh berries and a giant biscotti. It was fantastic and the presentation was beautiful. We also ordered the zeppole. The zeppole was good, but it's a huge portion. I think it came with eight pieces.  My only complaint? They pretty much give you shot glasses for your wine.

The sausage pizza was pretty good, though a little droopy. The one dish that I really enjoyed was the dates wrapped in pancetta, and there was also a steak or cut of meat that was pretty tasty.

I imagine it is difficult to get in here during the dinner rush as we sat down at 10 PM and still required a reservation, not to mention all the tables were still very full.  The wine pricing and selection offers diners an easy avenue for trying and sharing wines to appropriately pair with the various tapas you inevitably order. As someone with italian heritage who equally loves tapas-style eating, Quartino perfectly fit the bill! The menu options are great and it truly appears you cannot go wrong with whatever you order. Personally I drooled over the osso buco and the octopus the most. The meatball sliders were delicious.

I've had long waits at other restaurants and I'm happy enough for an apology or updated ETA.   I thought this was a nice and classy touch but not going to sway me to go somewhere should the food absolutely suck or something along those lines.   They didn't have wine glasses; I hate drinking wine out of a regular glass.  I get that you're trying to be trendy, but that's wine 101 to get optimal flavor.  I did like their wine pricing- they do glasses, carafs, liters, etc.  All are proportional and you don't get a discount for larger quantity, meaning you can order multiple different wines and not be penalized that you didn't stick with the same one and order a large vat of it.  Dishes were moderately priced, some tasted better than others.  The pappardelle al sugo di manzo was a hit with the entire group.  The gnocchi was a little bland tasting, needed a stronger sauce or more seasoning or something.  The eggplant parmesan was mushy and had-dare I say it-too much cheese.",0.9938,0.785,0.172,0.043,0.5662240537240536

Definitely recommend picking a meat and cheese on the menu to start.  Orange and arugula salad- fruit was fresh and the salad was light, but it's probably not worth it. Save your money for more pasta.  Spaghetti pomodoro- meh. A sign of a good Italian restaurant is that the most simple dishes are incredible, and this one missed the mark.  Tortellini- really delicious. Definitely recommend sticking with their fresh pasta dishes. While it's heavy, I could have eaten a whole plate.

Admittedly, it was probably most fun for the loud scene, and the ambiance that the Gibsons Group are known to create. Here's the issue: 1. The quality has gone way down on the food, as have the portions. 2. The beverage offerings have gone down even more. They plain suck, and lack any variety that Italy has plenty to offer, at reasonable prices.  3. The hostess team is clearly lost. They can't handle the door volume. It shows, and it creates unneeded issues in the small space people wait in, at the front door.  This place feeds on the tourist crowd with the hotels that surround it.

HOWEVER, after having been kindly reached out to by the staff and assured a wonderful experience, we decided to give Quartino another go. I left the restaurant with a full stomach and happy heart. We were sat at a table near the kitchen which was nice and roomy which I appreciated as the rest of the building was packed. The manager and wait staff were extremely attentive and friendly. They made sure our experience was great as well as the food.  We started out the meal with some bread (I still feel like the bread they give you at the table isn't that great, but the rest of the food made up for that) and some seasonal cocktails. I had a pumpkin spice mai tai and my friend got a moroccolo (or something like that!). Both were pretty boozy but delicious.  Next some appetizers were brought out for us. A toast with a DELICOUS fluffy goat cheese spread, bacon wrapped blue cheese filled dates, and a meat platter with (I believe) pickled onions of some sort. All of the appetizers were delicious, especially the meat sampler and goat cheese.  For entrees we went with fettuccini (homemade noodles, yum!) and the shrimp risotto. Both delicious. The alfredo sauce was light and not too overpowering. The risotto was heavy but nice and creamy. Portions were a bit small but that was fine because we had so much other food. For dessert, the manager sent us THREE different things to try. The warm donuts with dark chocolate and honey dipping sauces were nice and fluffy. The dark chocolate dipping sauce was incredible! The tiramisu was rich and fluffy and moist and was exactly what we were craving. Best of all was lemon cream gelato sandwiched between some sort of lemon cookie/cake on top of a lemon curd that I could eat spoonfuls of. So good! I felt like a queen and a food critic at the same time with the variety and amount of delicious food that was sent our way. The staff here was so kind and I am so glad to have given this place another chance.  Thank you Quartino for an amazing dining experience, and thank you to Alysia for having us.

Luckily we all walked out of Quartino completely stuffed and loved every course. We started with their Salumi selection and had the waitress bring her choices of meats, cheeses, and accompaniments. I also got us some malbec to enjoy - the wine list is super cheap and approachable ($40 for 1 LITER? Yes please!), but they also have a full bar.  We then each ordered a pasta dish and a couple of other items (pizza, shrimp) to all share. It is true that the plates will come out at various times so it's best to share with everyone so no one is left out when the food comes to the table. Everything was great, but my favorite was the tortellini with prosciutto.  There was a little mishap with the shrimp order where it was delayed and then came out incorrectly. The waitress was so concerned over it when we brought it to her attention that she took it off our bill and comped all of our desserts! Speaking of dessert, I ordered the off-menu tiramisu which was the best I've ever had in my entire life. Others ordered limoncello, house-made gelato, the gelato cookie sandwiches, and cannoli.  Long story short, the guys on my team now request Quartino at least once a week. Win-win! The owner said that they were considering opening up in Frisco down here in Texas! Do it!!",0.9905,0.824,0.148,0.028,0.5113425925925927

Great cheese and meat selections and the seafood dishes are worth ordering. On our last visit, we got, in addition to a selection of meats and cheeses, the 4 fromaggi pizza. It comes out piping hot: simple and delicious. The atmosphere is fun and italian with all the waitstaff wearing italian jerseys and adidas shoes. The staff are also very accommodating in terms of seating. They always give cute postcards  to you with the check that I love!

The restaurant is definitely loud and boisterous, which can add to the fun. Because there were only two of us, the host kindly sat us at a secluded table for two. Our server was extremely knowledgable about food and wine. He recommended the Salumi and helped us pick it out. We had a yummy salad, pasta and a pork shank entree, all of which were so flavorful and perfectly cooked. In addition, I am on crutches and had to ask to find the bathroom.

There are so many different options on the menu that it can be overwhelming at first glance.  Luckily the portion sizes aren't too big so you can order multiple items without having too much.  I really liked the pappardelle and ravioli.  They only downfall is that the food comes out as it is prepared so depending on what you order everyone may be eating at different times which can be awkward.  They also have gluten free options if you need that accommodation for your group.

I made a reservation here for dinner, and the place was packed. We had to wait a few minutes to be seated, and were walked upstairs and seated in the back room, smack between a large party of about 16 women on one side and a large party of about 10 people on the other. Our table was also shoved against a wall with a shit ton of stuff on it (plates, plate holder, etc) when the table was pretty small in size to begin with, and it was next to the kitchen so my chair was either kicked or in the way of every single person going in and out of the kitchen (due to the narrowed walking space because of the large 16 lady party).  Both parties on either side of us were SO extremely loud, to the point that they were all literally yelling to each other and shouting over each other to be heard. My husband and I were so incredibly irritated. Who yells in a restaurant? And who does it with zero respect for the other poor victims who were sat near you? There were 2 gals clearly trying to have a girls night out dinner and those poor souls were sat behind us so they had to deal with the noise too. I heard them complain to the manager, but she offered really no sympathy. The noise literally ruined what was supposed to be a nice celebratory dinner for my husband and me, and we couldn't wait to eat and get the hell out and find somewhere quieter to get dessert.  Pappardelle- delicious. It's my fave kind of noodle, and the sauce was hearty Sausage risotto- really good and creamy. Sometimes risotto can be too chewy but this was cooked to perfection Cheese tortellini- decadent alfredo sauce, great chewiness It's too bad that the noise level is so awful, this could be a great place.

Instead, we found cold, bland, and undercooked pasta served with a side of poor service.  We checked in for our reservation right on time and were told to wait for just a moment.  I noticed several tables being seated immediately upon checking in, so I asked the hostess for an update.  She simply told us that she already called us several times and that we missed our table. Given that we were standing literally in front of the check in the entire time, I don't see how this was possible. Not a big deal, but an apology instead of some made-up excuse would have been nice.  As for the food, we ordered the arugula salad (pretty good, but can't say I've ever seen anyone botch a salad), minestrone soup (bland and lukewarm), tagliatelle bolognese (cold, clumpy, cardboardy), and truffle porcini risotto (flavorful, but cold). Both pasta and risotto dishes were entirely undercooked to the point where they still tasted grainy and almost crunchy.   On the bright side, our waitress was really sweet and got us in and out of there in under 45 minutes.  Super disappointed in such a well-reviewed place, to say the least.",0.9583,0.786,0.139,0.074,0.6708730158730158

The service here is also some of the best in town. I really appreciated how attentive they were, and how upscale they keep things.

But still, all 5 of us were disappointed with the meal itself (and, to a lesser extent, the atmosphere), so I'm still leaving this 2-star review to let others know of our experience.  (reviews of individual dishes are at the end)  The atmosphere - this is a casual place and quite loud (the acoustics, not loud music). If you're expecting an elegant or even classy place, this isn't it. Some of our fellow diners were wearing NFL jerseys, and I was literally hoarse at the end of the meal from having to raise my voice to talk.  And finally, it was expensive!! They took a LOT off our bill, and it was still $35 per person. That included tip (on the full bill of course) & tax, as well as 2 drinks each.  All in all, Nonnino - a couple blocks up the street - is a MUCH better choice for a great Italian dinner experience.  And now to the disappointing food. We ordered 8 or 10 dishes, and the only one of them that was universally enjoyed was the grilled octopus. Well, and also the olives! LOL The rest of what we ordered fell short:    * dates wrapped in pancetta - not good. They were small, and the pancetta used was just not the right flavor combination for a date * veal meatballs in tomato sauce - these were fine but nothing to recommend them. And we all salted them.  * polenta fries - rather flavorless. All of us reached for the salt, and half of them went back to the kitchen * gnocchi - really, really bad. The flavor was off, the texture was chewy... We sent more than half of it back to the kitchen. And there were 5 of us!  * fettuccine alfredo - thin sauce with a weird herby flavor, underdone pasta (and no, it wasn't al dente, it was UNDERDONE).  * osso bucco - this was the most flavorful dish we got, but it was a TINY portion (literally 6 bites - for $13.50!), and because the veal shank used was so thin it was overcooked and chewy The dessert course was much better - and not just because it was compliments of the manager, in consideration for our disappointing meal:  First, the limoncello. WOW, was that stuff good! Strong lemon flavor, sweet but not sickeningly so, and the manager told us it's overproof.

2016-09-13,4.0,"A surprisingly small food bill, but we blew the budget on liquor. Our 4-top ordered the Salumera tasting which is a great item permitting you to mix and match cheeses, salumera (the meat stuff), spuntini (the veggie things) olives, etc. Almost a meal in itself for the group (well not quite), it satisfied both the meat lovers and the vegetarian-inclined at the table. To this we added the shaved salad, house-made pappardelle, polpette (veal) and roasted baby octopus. All good, well maybe the octupus was a bit tough, but worth trying. You want pizza? Go to Due's and shut up. OK, we were seduced by the grapefruiticello, limoncello (""We make our own limoncello"") and espresso martini's and then had to order another round after tasting each other's drinks, plus a decent pour of a shiraz. So, yeah, $84 for liquor and $60 for food. But we left happy and stuffed. I was surprised. I am so completely jaded by most restaurants. And then walking into Quartino's in the heart of tourist Chicago, as a local I was not expecting much value or anything that wasn't over-salted. Service was attentive and even personable.

Our table ordered a Tortellini dish, which was a white sauce pasta with prosciutto. The prosciutto definitely made the dish unique and much tastier. We also got a sausage pizza, which was pretty average. My favorite was the Orechiette, which is the ear shaped pasta. Halfway through, we decided to order the Fiocco di Prosciutto, which was a nice way to end our dinner. I would definitely come back for the food, as it really is phenomenal.  The service was amazing. Albeit, we did go 4-5pm, when there was less customers, but the servers were very attentive. Unfortunately, I did not get our waiter's name, but he was very nice and definitely very energetic. Definitely one of the best waiters I've experienced. The manager, Alysia, also came by and was very welcoming as well. She was very well versed in her introduction to the different types  of prosciutto, as we had trouble deciding which one to try out. As customers, we were impressed, and her dedication to her job makes the vibe for us that much better.  The restaurant itself is very large. There are many many tables on two floors, as I can imagine how busy the place would get. The ambiance is nice, with the dim lighting and homey interior. It's definitely a place to try out in your visit to Chicago or even just for a simple meal with friends and family.",0.996,0.743,0.233,0.023,0.6007738095238097

2016-09-08,5.0,THIS PLACE WAS SO GOOD! Good prices and amazing food. So I walked all around River North looking for a good place to eat and finally stumbled upon this place on Yelp and was thoroughly pleased. I knew from the moment I walked in that the food was going to be delicious. The hostess was very nice to begin and sat us right away. The server started us with bread and olive oil/vinegar and we ordered a bottle of the house red (Rosso) which was  a good choice with our meal! The style of this restaurant is meant for sharing (family style) and I was happy they warned us in the beginning about this. We got the Margherita pizza which came with eight slices (12 inches). The pizza was super good because it had a very authentic taste and was different than any other pizza I've had.  The server was very helpful by letting us know that we could order a half pasta for half the price and it was a good amount of pasta for even one person. So we split the gnocchi as well which I thought was good but wasn't necessarily the best gnocchi I've had. Still was pretty tasty though! The way we finished off with the hot chocolate cake and ice cream which was basically just a lava cake but wow it was SO good! The perfect amount to split with another person. Overall the three dishes we got and the bottle of wine was $45 which was SUPER cheap and a perfect amount of food. This reataurant was the best I've been to in Chicago.

THE CALAMARI- is great, worth swinging by just for that. TORTELLINI - absolutely delicious. The prosciutto melts in your mouth, sauce and tortellini are sooo good. The dish works. Delicious. SHORT RIB w POTATOES - omg order this. If my Yelp reviewing can help you in anyway possible... Get the short ribs and get the potatoes. UNREAL !!!!!!!! VEAL MEATBALLS - incredible. Best meatballs I've ever had.  THE BAD - caprese salad; there was so much salt in my mozarrella it was inedible. Grossss. The other salad we had which was like radishes, beets, carrots... Soooo gross. It was so vinegary, tough, and the flavors did not work together. BOLOGNESE- this I was told to order but it was clear no one in our group really liked it. The sauce was VERY sweet and lacked any real sofrito flavor or if u like marinara bolognese it did not have that going for it either... GNOCCHI- ok the arugula pesto is really pushing it. It tastes like pure arugula which any of my salad eating friends out there knows tastes like DIRT plain. They should know a normal pesto w basil, garlic, and pine nuts would much better serve their hand rolled gnocchis. And when I say ""THE BAD"" I mean I pushed it away with my fork and did not eat it.  I think with this place u need to be selective. The marinara is great (meatballs) same w the cream sauce.

Excellent, with a nicely-flavoured crust and good quality/balance of toppings. I would have liked it a little more well-done but that's my only quibble. My lady-date got the cavatelli, which I found to be a bit tough and the sauce was a bit sweet and one-note for my taste. I had the pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo, which was a braised beef tomato sauce. It was similarly sweet and needed some fresh herbs or something to brighten it up, but it was OK and the pasta was well-cooked. The best things about this place: 1/2 liters of wine, and grana padano in a crank-bottle on your table. I got the Sangiovese and it paired well with the meal.",0.9941,0.753,0.238,0.009,0.5583333333333333

Quarto's is a fantastic mix of Chicago's long time consistent restaurants with Excellent freshly prepared products from top to bottom. Service is top notch and consistent. So let me just say this,, in the many times ( I clearly did not use my Yelp check in every time) I'd been there between January and June 2016, Ive not identified anything I do not like or really do not love.. With that, some of the can't miss items, are Calamari, Big, crunchy, tender, and full of flavor, any of the house vegetables, Brocolli Rabe, Spinach,  Eggplant, all winners..The Burrata is a MUST! Veal Meatball sliders! Incredible.  Any of the housemate pizza's are a winner, The Pizze Quattro Formaggi,, DAMN!!! Unfortunately I cannot comment on the desserts because we've always been happily full. That's my mistake. However I have to believe it's all worthwhile. Priced reasonable acrsso the board, always a busy hopping place ( a great sign of a good place in a restaurant deluged town)  and one that I'll never forget with my opening crew of 2016.

We went ahead and ordered an appetizer pizza and it was lukewarm.  A hostess stopped by a little later on and asked how everything was and she was appalled when we told her that the food was lukewarm and quickly whisked the partially eaten pizza  away even though we told her to just leave it.  We thought she might return with another one but not the case.  We placed our entree order only to be inundated by a very large and LOUD party celebrating a birthday.   There was no room for my seat as the large party was getting seated and I had to move right right against my husband.  It was still so noisy we literally could not even converse.  We finally flagged a manager who was very apologetic and found us a table downstairs where we could finish our meal.  We noticed that other diners in the room did not care for the noise either but it was super noisy everywhere upstairs.  The ambiance was horrible especially for smaller groups.  The location downstairs was packed with large tables too but at least one party was leaving so it helped cut down on the noise.  We noticed another small party being seated and their space was so tight we knew what they were in for.   The service was courteous and the manager really wanted to smooth things over.  The remaining entrees were actually very tasty but the whole incident upstairs really ruined our evening.   Quartino's is obviously a very popular place but it seems more interested in packing people in like sardines vs creating a nice dining atmosphere where you don't have to shout to be heard.  We were told that they serve 700 people a day so it gives you an idea of the insanity.  Dinner time is definitely not the time to go if you want to enjoy a normal meal where you can converse.",0.9725,0.764,0.14,0.096,0.5353542034097589

2016-07-07,3.0,"I stopped by here for lunch with a friend on a nice day and was seated outside. You will be served with complimentary bread which actually tastes pretty good with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. We settled for the $25 lunch special which essentially allowed us to choose three different dishes from the main sections of the menu. Our choices ended up being the beet salad, linguine with clams, and the calamari. I am a fan of beets and the salad did not disappoint. The salad contained beets and burratta cheese. It seemed as if there were two different kinds of beets in the salad. One came in the cubed form and was juicy and flavorful while the other came in a sliced form and tasted more like sliced carrots. I definitely enjoyed eating the cubed beets more since the sliced beets were pretty flavorless and dry. The burratta was extremely creamy and burst when I cut it with a fork. Although the flavoring of the cheese itself was a bit watered down, it complemented the strong flavor of the cubed beets well. The linguine with clams dish was actually smaller than I was expecting. There was the option of a red or white sauce with this dish and we opted for the white. The sauce was a wine sauce so it was not creamy. For pasta, I thought the linguine dish was actually pretty light. After I finished eating, I did not feel weighed down. The clams were pretty tiny and there weren't that many unfortunately. Ordering the calamari was a mistake. I need to remember that eating fried foods in large quantities is neither enjoyable nor desirable. The portion size for this order was pretty big and we were unable to finish the dish completely. In addition, the calamari was a bit soggy which made it even more difficult to consume. This was definitely one of the weaker dishes we had ordered. On top of the lunch special, my friend and I mistakenly ordered the Gran Coppa Quartino dessert. The description of the dessert may seem tempting, but let me warn you that it is actually just a very mediocre, overpriced dessert in disguise. The gelato tasted extremely artificial and the screaming shade of pink of the strawberry gelato did not help one bit. If you are looking for a reasonably priced meal for lunch, stopping by Quartino and getting the $25 lunch special is actually not a bad deal. I certainly regret ordering the dessert which cost an additional $8. Skip on the dessert here and you'll walk away with a decent lunch experience without having your wallet drained.",0.8881,0.819,0.11,0.072,0.5571973233737941

Unfortunately, the salad was drowning in salad dressing so that you could barely taste any of the other ingredients. We needed the orange to almost combat the overpowering  dressing. It also would have been nice if they had de-pitted the orange slices. There were a lot of orange seeds that made them hard to pick out when mixed among the small grain rice and hazelnuts and made for an unpleasant bite of bitterness. The tagliatelle again would have been good if they had cooked the pasta properly because the bolognese sauce was nice. There were lumps of noodles that didn't separate during the cooking process. Tigah hates clumpy pasta! The beef filets were ordered medium which means pink in center but came out well-done. The shrimp did not taste fresh and were overdone giving them an unpleasant rubbery texture.  Overall, it felt like a meal that had all the components to be good but was prepared by an amateur - Overdressed salad, clumpy noodles and overcooked proteins.

We had initially planned on being seated outdoors (and people watching!) but the weather was too warm and sticky for that. The hosts (there appeared to be 3!) were all smiles and seated us quickly to a window facing table for a happy compromise. The place was packed and got noisier with laughter and banter as the evening progressed.  The ambience is all mood lighting and on the fancier side, so we were happy that we'd all dressed up. Side note: the tables are close enough that the group next to us tapped me on my shoulder twice to ask me what we had ordered because it looked SO good. Speaking of the food, it was one those meals that I'll reminisce about for a long time! We split a bottle of prosecco, and ordered one entree each, skipping the appetizers in favor of dessert (which is my favorite thing to have when I'm out dining). The menu had plenty of non-meat entrées, which pleased my vegetarian friend. We asked the server for suggestions and she made up in friendliness what she seemed to lack in knowledge of the menu. We got the potato gnocchi, which came with one of the most delicious pesto sauces I've had in a while; the linguine with clams in a marinara sauce that was seasoned and spiced perfectly, and the eggplant parmesan, which was my least favorite dish, but which my dining companions seemed to enjoy a lot. The portions are decent sized, and unless you have a really large appetite, stick to sharing dishes like we did. Also, all our dishes came out at different times, which was kind of awkward. Then came dessert, and we agonized over the ridiculously tantalizing menu until we decided on the profiteroles and the Nutella panino. The sugar sprinkled Nutella panino was a great Nutella toast, but too simple and easy replicable to be on that menu.

2016-06-16,1.0,I have to blame the waiter on this visit. Im not sure if he was new or just didn't understand how the theme works. He wanted us to place our entire order when we sat down. We told him we wanted to first enjoy our appetizer and then we would decide. When we finally place a variety of dishes became back and asked us if we would be interested in coffee and deserts. We all looked at him like he was from another planet. We then told him we had not even received our dinner. He looked like he saw a deer in the headlights.

2016-06-14,2.0,I have heard wonderful things about this restaurant but was recently dissappointed in the service itself. We dined no a Friday night and were seated on the patio. After about 20 minutes a server showed up and took our drink orders. Another 20 minutes went buy and another server brought us some bread but the drinks had yet to show up. I eventually commented and asked about the status of our drinks and 15 minutes later another server showed up with 2 of the 3 drinks we ordered. Our meal went on like this with continuous changes in servers and it even took 30 minutes to get the check let alone another 25 minutes to get my credit card back. For such a nice establishment the server confusion was very disappointing.  We tried the Caprese salad which was fantastic and absolutely fresh and I highly recommend it. We also the meatballs which I had to remind the server twice to receive and were fairly small and somewhat chewy. (I'm guessing they forgot about it and reheated them or something). As for the pasta we ordered the Cavatelli we asked for it to be spicy. The pasta itself was great and the sauce definitely tasted homemade however there was no spice and 15 minutes later some crushed red pepper was brought to the table.  Overall I was really looking forward to eating on the patio here and I do think they have a solid drink menu and great beer selection. I wish our experience was different as the food was on point but the service was unacceptable. Considering we had guests in town and chose to take them here was a bit of a mistake. Hopefully it is not always like this. Enjoy!,0.987,0.752,0.169,0.078,0.4318181818181818

The bread at table was a small roll sliced. I don't know how the food is for sharing. I ordered the eggplant parmesan and there were two and a half tiny slices covered in cheese and tinned sauce. My dining companions food took forever.

Dishes I tried: -Ricotta: To be honest, I've never been a fan of these cheese. But this is the one place that has changed my mind.. get it. done deal! - Veal meatballs (traditional style): Tender, juicy, and just the right about of sauce without masking the natural flavors of the meat itself. Get it. -Baby Spinach salad: lackluster and the table did not finish it. Pass on it.. -Penne alla vodka: I love a good vodka sauce and this was a perfect touch to getting a few bites of a heavy pasta without feeling weighed down. Creamy and silky with bold but simplistic flavors.. get it! -Broccoli rabe- it's is rabe and not traditional broccoli florets, it tastes similar to a sauteed spinach with more texture. Pleasantly surprised with the bold garlic notes and a pinch of spice. Get it! -Octopus: If it haven't said it enough in my reviews, Chicago is my all time favorite city to get octopus plates, and Quartino did not disappoint! Charred perfectly with bites of smokey flavor. Must get! -Porcini & truffle risotto- Creamy, heavy and lacked the truffle notes. Also was a bit undercooked.

We ordered half a bottle of Malbec to drown our sorrows in to start.

Historic and lively at more or less all hours of the day, the service and atmosphere at Quartino are arguably the biggest assets. The bartenders are fantastic, and balance classy and casual depending on who they're serving (an understated asset). Even with a diverse menu you should expect to have your food no more than ten minutes or so after ordering. Star Granted.  Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost? My Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo (recommended to me by the bartender) came in at $12.50, which was exceptional value given the generous portion, and the entire menu was priced accordingly. Good stuff. Star Granted.  Stars 3 and 4: How was the food? My dish was a tale of two components. The house made pasta was excellent, with thick pappardelle noodles cooked to perfection in a way that absorbed the sauce and beef around it.  That sauce and beef; however, was a bit weak. That tomato sauce was, for lack of a better word, plain, and the accompanied beef didn't really add all that much to the equation. This wasn't a bad dish, but it didn't blow me away.

Food: Fantastic, my boyfriend and I split a lunch special which is a 3 course meal-all the things you love for $25-how can you say no? We split the Gorgonzola dolce to start, which comes with an apricot puree and a delicious raisin nut bread (don't quote me on the raisin portion). The cheese was served at room temperature and was divine-Gorgonzola's (or almost any cheese) is so much better at this temperature, can really appreciate the complexity and flavor profile of the cheese. We then split the burrata salad that comes with roasted beets and arugula-so refreshing and a great textural contrast. Finishing course was the house made tortellini with peas and prosciutto-the pasta was so tender and the snap of the peas really brightened the heaviness of the dish.

Perfectly tender and crispy on the outside. I wasn't crazy about the marinara sauce on the side but the calamari was definitely one of the best I've ever had.  I would have skipped the bruschetta if I could do it over again. It was three pieces of a toasted bread and each one had different ingredients. Wasn't really what I was expecting. It was kind of bland and weird. Skip.  The pizza was so fresh and gooey and hot, literally right out of the oven to our table. I just had a small piece but the pizza was devoured super quickly by our table. Service was so weird!!! Our server came by only twice and he wasn't very friendly. Like at all. Borderline rude.

2016-05-01,4.0,"We visited with a large group and had a great experience.  On the plus side, they are clearly experienced dealing with large groups.  On the negative, this is probably because it is always PACKED - and they definitely jam the tables (and the guests) in the restaurant.  I also noticed an interesting mix of families with rowdy children (that's us!), and young, single people, looking annoyed about all of the families and rowdy children. Otherwise, it is a ""small plates"" concept.  We ordered a lot of everything, so I had a chance to taste a lot.  We had several of the pizzas and those were great.  I was mostly impressed by how different each of them tasted (they don't just interchange toppings - each pizza has its own flavor).  The crusts are uneven and toasty - perfectly homemade!  I really enjoyed them all.  We also had a tortellini that was amazing - a perfect butter cream sauce that was not overdone.  Additionally, we had parpadalle that came with some kind of ragu.  Personally, I wasn't the biggest fan of the sauce (thought it lacked flavor) - but our table ordered a couple after tasting one - so I must have been outnumbered on that.  We did taste some calamari at the beginning, and that was really excellent. I thought this restaurant was pretty solid - but nothing that knocked my socks off.  This is a good place for groups and for casual outings.  I would not suggest this for a date, unless you're afraid you won't have much to talk about :)",0.9896,0.806,0.173,0.021,0.6367127496159753

Like other reviewer, I highly recommend them because I've seen them quote an hour to hour and a half on most friday nights.  Out of the items I have tried, I have enjoyed the beet and burrata salad, polenta fries, and artisan blend fondue the best. I love anything with burrata and their salad is no exception. The polenta fries are great and i love the red pepper salsa that they serve it with (I also love dipping them in the fondue). The fondue is delicious and for two people, it's plenty - I may get two orders if you have four or more though! I found the gnocchi and eggplant parmesan to be somewhat tasteless. The gnocchi at least had the pesto which added flavor, but I really did not enjoy the eggplant parmesan. The eggplant was thoroughly cooked through, which I like, but the sauce was lacking salt and flavor, which caused the entire dish to do the same. I've been meaning to try the pizzas, but haven't gotten around to it. For dessert, I've had the hot chocolate cake with italian gelato and the italian donuts. I expected a few donuts and you get a huge basket full which is awesome because who doesn't love extra donuts! The hot chocolate cake is so rich and decadent - absolutely delicious, and pairs well with the cold and creamy gelato.  The service has been fine  each time I've been there. However, I agree with the reviews on just how LOUD the place is. It's not loud like you would expect at a packed restaurant - it's literally piercing. And, to even talk to a person you're sitting next to, you have to yell, causing you to contribute to that noise.

Loved the bread that they serve right away, just a little bit of parmesan and olive oil and your good to go. Cheese plates where nice, didn't love every cheese but it was great to try like 3 for around $14. The pizza! man the pizza was amazing! My wife said it was the best in Chicago. Such great crust, highly recommend the margarita. The veal meatball sliders are another great treat and only a few buck. Now onto the most important thing their pasta, yum it was on point! I only ordered their home-made pastas and they where excellent. Desserts where amazing.

Pros: There's a good selection on the menu, there's outdoor seating, the waitress was friendly and informative, and they have one of  those old-style bathrooms with the attendant. Cons: Part of my dinner order came out a good 15 minutes before the other part and before any of my friend's food, so of course it was cold.  We ordered the sausage risotto which had zero flavor and the gnocchi which was meh We had to ask 3 times for Parmesan cheese (different people because we could not find our waitress) While the waitress was friendly, after we placed our order we did not see her again until we were 30 minutes into our meal The portion sizes are small for the price point There are so many great Italian places in the city, I doubt I would go back here.",0.9648,0.798,0.142,0.059,0.46229338842975204

The slight aromas of Italian fare from the tables close together are a mingling of fresh garlic and spices. it's a welcome sight to see bread, and actually good Italian bread, olive oil and Parmesan to be part of the experience and not part of the bill. Service was very good and although the restaurant was packed on Sunday night, we were allowed to stay and linger in the bar (with full service), for at least 3 hours. The Malbec was of a good quality. The wild Arugula salad was fresh and filling. It was the eggplant Parmesan that was just okay at best. Lots of tomato sauce, a big basil leaf, a bit of mozzarella cheese and a few pieces of eggplant. While we were warned that the plate was hot, mine was cold, like refrigerator cold, which was so very odd. I didn't want to complain, so I just ate a portion of it until it seemed ridiculous to eat that dish cold.

However, I love traveling to cities and finding my local Yelpers' reviews of destination restaurants, so hopefully if I've got some Louisville folks in Chicago, my review will motivate them to stop in to Quartino! During a work trip to the Windy City, I wanted a place close to my hotel for dinner that wasn't outrageous. Quartino's menu fit the bill.  I arrived around 6pm and was seated immediately in a cozy little corner at a table for two. A server brought a glass bottle of tap water in addition to a plate of bread. Very quickly I was able to give my order and surprisingly fast, my food arrived. I had the Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo (pasta with braised beef) and it definitely hit the spot.  What I really loved was that the idea at Quartino is to share plates, and so since I was on my own, the portion was a little smaller than most restaurants, so I didn't feel stuffed by the end of the meal. My server mentioned that there were options with the menu as well...if you want half portions, double, etc. I was fine with the portion that was served. However, I took advantage of the half portion for dessert when I ordered the nutella panini and capped it off with a decaf coffee. Perfect end to a pleasant meal.

She was super responsive to emails. For a friday night rehearsal dinner in Chicago,IL Quartino we knew we would be spending a lot, but some places in River North charge just stupid amount of money and Quartino was the best deal we found from a price standpoint AND to the amount of food/drink you can get for your money. It was a no brainer to pick Quartino.  As the planning process went on, we were able to set up our own complimentary tasting for our event. My fiance and I went to the tasting and the waiter we worked with was amazing. Him and the manager worked with us to finalize a menu we felt satisfied with for our rehearsal dinner.  The day of our event we showed up and were greeted by one of the head waiters Roberto and the manager Alysia. THEY WERE AMAZING!!!! Roberto was so unbelievably nice (so was the rest of the wait-staff and Alysia was as sweet and as helpful as can be. We had 40 guests, we had our own private room upstairs, We went with the 5 course family style meal option, basic beer and wine package and the final bill ended up being a little short of our $3000 food and beverage room minimum. Alysia and Roberto recommended a variety of wines to take home and they were so great about that too.  Whenever I have a bigger event or party to plan or if you are looking for a restaurant to host an event..... PLEASE USE QUARTINO!!!!! It was the best night ever.

We got a three top in the middle of the bar and I was happy. Shinead* assisted us throughout our dinner and was an attentive to our needs, thank you!!. This was my second visit to this restaurant on the recommendation of a co-worker during a training visit to Indiana. I am so glad I chose this restaurant, THERE TORTELINNI IS WORTH THE MILES TRAVELED!!!!! It is simply amazing, in its simplicity and presentation. I enjoyed a glass of Rose and I was a Happy Birthday Girl. Also the Ravioli and Brussels Sprouts were very tasty.  Great for sharing plates and they do half portions!!!  Towards the end of our experience a few patrons had come in for their meal but were very obnoxiously loud. After 5 minutes of them trying to arrange the bar tables themselves and failing, I finally had to ask them to stop yelling in my ear. Shinead noticed the frustration that was now present on all the faces of my friends and I, and apologized. What happened next made me a customer of Quartino for life... We had already paid the tab and she asked us to wait because she wanted to bring the manager around. He approached us and asked how our dinner was and made a point to apologize on behalf of Quartino that other guests had disrupted our dinner.  When he found out we were visiting from Texas, he was shocked and asked if he could give me a gift of Champagne.

Italian food is my favorite-- we got a half fennel sausage, half campania (fonduta, ricotta, basil, cherry tomatoes) thin neopolitan pizza. the very competent and friendly server informed us that the pizza and serving sizes are small bites style made for sharing. something was amiss because everything was larger than what tapas are in Cali!! we were amazed. the pizza was like a medium sized one. wonderful crust and flavors. extremely superb campania. flavorful sausage, though if I had a do over I'd probably just get a full campania.  the absolute winner for me were the veal meatballs, tender and light but with a sweet golden raisin figgy sauce that was neither thick nor syrupy; just coated perfectly and truly mimicked the meatballs I had in Naples. again, tapas style meant 8 meatballs. crazy when in Cali we usually get 3-4.  also got the calamari which was friggin huge and delicious.

The menu is a bit daunting to look at first but he was able to walk us through the menu with ease.  Quartino specializes in Italian food and all of their plates are meant to be shared. For our appetizer, we got a sampler which came with two types of cheese, two types of meats, and topping such as jams, a beet salad and pickled vegetables. We were unsure on which cheeses and meats to get, so we asked for the chef to surprise us! The platter that came out was HUGE! Certainly enough for our group of 6. Everything on the sampler was delicious! For our entrees, we order mushroom risotto, gnocchi, fettuccini with clams, tortellini, Brussels sprouts and braised short ribs.

2016-01-07,3.0,"I had been wanting to come here for months, and on the first impression, I was kicking myself for not visiting it sooner!  Quartino looks every bit like restaurants in Italy, from the decor to the menu to the people working there. The main difference: the tapas style ordering. Honestly, I was confused by other reviewers on how to go about ordering, and looking around at other tables wasn't much help either! We ended up ordering two pasta dishes to share and then, still hungry, we ordered a third. But plus one dessert at the end, it ended up being too much for two people!  The good: I LOVE that this place is so gluten free friendly. Not only did they have gluten free pasta that could be used in any pasta dish, but a designated gluten free menu had more choices than I'd seen at possibly any Italian restaurant EVER. If pasta isn't your thing, there was a long list of gluten free meat dishes along with at least ten appetizers and five soup or salad options. Also, my boyfriend agreed with other claims that the tiramisu here is really darn good (although, confusingly, it's not on the menu!).  The bad: the service and quality on my one visit here was a little spotty. Our half-full water jug was taken away before we were finished eating, our silverware was cleared while we were waiting on another dish, and our waiter never followed up on more wine after we'd decided to do 1/4 liter ""to start."" Our first two pasta dishes were sloppily plated, with one vastly different in size than the other. The Alfredo one was yucky. Then, we waited for a solid 25 minutes for our third pasta dish, and our waiter was even confused as to why it hadn't yet arrived at our table. Also, the wine, while cheap, wasn't served with wine glasses which was just kind of weird.  Overall, I'd love to give Quartino another shot, but at $75 for two people, I think I'll have to save up a bit before I do. The quality of the experience just wasn't there for the price, so I'd be hesitant! However, it seems like it has great potential to be a date night spot or a fun spot for a group get-together.",0.99,0.801,0.145,0.054,0.5081481481481481

We were seated right away, which was great for a Saturday night (the wait tends to get really long without a reservation). Our waitress was attentive and helpful. We started off with the quattro formaggi pizze, then ordered the tortellini (one of my favorites), potato puree (excellent), and the porcini & truffle risotto - which was too much food for us, but it did not stop us from eating 90% of it.

It was extremely snug, I had to make sure I wouldn't knock the water jug off the table several times. Also, if I were to lean back in my chair, I would be (literally) touching backs with the lady in the table immediately behind us. I'm also fairly certain if I reached only my arm back, I would be able to grab food off the table of the party behind us...to close for comfort in my opinion. We ordered the ravioli, some type of fries, and a clam pasta. They recommend we eat 'family style' because the food is served immediately after it is made. The ravioli and clam pasta are extremely small portions, keep that in mind before ordering. We ordered the fries because of what we read on Yelp, however, no one in our party enjoyed it enough to rave about it. The service was definitely not up to par. We were served bread upon giving our order to the waitress. When our food came out (which took a while, but that was not an issue for us) the waitress did not clear the plates from the bread. We had an extremely crowded table with dirty dishes everywhere. It was not an enjoyable experience for us.

We had reservations and ended up getting there early. We were able to snag a seat at the bar. I ordered a 1/4 L of their Bellini, which was delicious! What makes Quartino different than other Italian restaurants that I've been to is that the dishes are tapas style. While I'm used to larger Italian size portions, I found that Quartino's portions were just right for one person (if you don't share of course!). I ordered the Linguine with clams in white sauce and it was the perfect blend of clams and pasta. Going with a big group always has its benefits, it gives you the chance to try more. I had several bites of the Tuscan Sausage Risotto and Cavatelli. The risotto was good, but the Cavatelli was amazing! The fresh ricotta with the tomato and basil sauce was fantastic.  Overall our group of 7 ordered 10-12 tapas, a bottle of wine, a cocktail, and a pitcher of Sangria and it came out to roughly $240 including tip which is super reasonable.

2015-12-29,4.0,"Delicious in every way. Everything we ordered was executed well, and the atmosphere and bartender were delightful elements that added to the overall experience. Husband came here a few months back when he was in town for business, and he along with 2 other colleagues came and enjoyed a slew of small plates. He enjoyed it so much that he wanted me to experience it as well on our recent trip to Chicago. Boy was he ever so right! We ended up ordering calamari, soprano pizza, pappardelle in a braised beef tomato sauce, shrimp with garlic, red chilis, olive oil, and white wine. Each were well-made and had fantastic proportions for the price, but the stars out of the bunch were the calamari and soprano pizza. The calamari had a light coating and it was crispy and yummylicious. The meat itself was tender and seasoned nicely. I only spotted 2 tentacles, but the other pieces were so well done that it didn't matter. The soprano pizza was divine, and the crust made it. Sure the veal meatballs brought the base flavor profile, but the crust had just the right amount of chew and crispy texture. We had to be so careful not to devour the whole thing in one sitting, otherwise, we would have not been able to eat the rest of the food! We ended the night with a delicious dessert of zeppoles. They are fried doughnuts, but so airy and fluffy. To accompany each bite are dark chocolate and honey. The combination of the two sauces together is like experiencing nirvana. Absolutely loved every bite, and for $6.25, it was plenty for the two of us. Each dish that we had ranged in prices from $10-$15, and there was plenty of food to take home. We ordered 4 savory dishes and 1 dessert, and we could have easily just gone with 2 dishes and the dessert. However, the leftovers reheat wonderfully. With a convenient and central location to Magnificent Mile and River North neighborhood, Quartino is easy to find, and will leave you and your family members happy.

We made a reservation about three days in advance and man am I glad we did! Both floors of the two story restaurant were packed. The closeness and loud atmosphere is what we look for when we go out to eat (fun atmosphere!), but if you prefer a quieter dining environment this may not be the place for you. Our server seated us right when we got there and promptly got us menus and water. The theme of Quartino is essentially Italian tapas.  Our server got me a gluten free menu right away and the g free menu was quite impressive (especially for an Italian restaurant!). The g free menu had the ""normal"" gluten free things like cheese, salami, antipasti but also a gluten free fusilli (pasta) that could be prepared the same was as their normal pastas. COOL. We tried several of the tapas; the stuffed dates (AMAZING), asparagus risotto, caprese salad, gluten free fusilli with the sausage marinara, and broccoli rabe (spicy A F). The food was awesome and we loved that like a traditional tapas restaurant they brought the food out when it was ready so you can kind of graze the whole night.  Wine is purchased by the carafe.

2015-12-27,3.0,"I was slightly disappointed in this place. I mean the food was good but I thought the service was just not very good. Like we had a waiter but we didn't see him most of the meal. Like the kitchen people brought out the food and served it, so trying to order more drinks or more food was difficult.  We were seated about 30 min after our reservation to a table for 4, when we had 5 people. We had to ask for a chair for the 5th person as the host didn't even notice we had 5 people...they brought the chair never brought silverware or anything.  We were able to wait at the bar before we were seated which was very crowded. They have some small tables that have a waitress and you can order the full menu I believe.  Anyways the food was good. Besides the chicken, that was a little dry.   We also ordered the Bruschette, Dates wrapped in Pancetta, (which were never brought to us and we had to ask some random waiter, as ours was MIA most of the meal), Carpaccio, Brussle Sprout Salad, Penne Alla Vodka, the Chicken and the Salmon. It was shareable plates but things like the Salad, Bruschetta, and pasta were a little hard to share, so I would order 2 if you have more than 4 people, and are not ordering as much as we did.  We also got the hot chocolate cake for the birthday girl which was actually amazing.  There was a ton of larger groups here, so they are good at accommodating that. I also was told they deliver so that's good. I would go back eventually, just service last night was not that great, (I will give the benefit of the doubt, it being the 26th, maybe they were under staffed).

2015-12-26,4.0,"Very delayed review: It was 4:30 on the last day of Restaurant Week, so the roommate and I decided to make a trip downtown to get anything we could. I heard good things about Quartino from others, and luckily, they had a table for 5:30 open. Granted, it was a Thursday night, but there weren't too many people in this very rustic, authentic-looking ""Italian tapas"" restaurant. I loved the salumeria and bread displays around the restaurant, and the fact that the waiters and waitresses all wore Italian soccer jerseys was a very nice touch. Might not actually be authentic, but the experience definitely felt like it could be. Strange as it may sound, I recommend a trip to the bathroom (second floor, to the right of the bar) just for the borax soap! Very unique. Probably one of the best Restaurant Week deals around, there was a lot of variety for four courses at $33/2 people. The waitress mentioned that all plates were meant for sharing, which is rather typical of Italian restaurants. We proceeded to order the Fonduta, the Porcini & Truffle Risotto, Beef Filets, and for dessert, the Coppa al Banana.  The Fonduta was a nice, hearty bite for an appetizer. Subtle in taste but rich in texture, we quickly sopped it up. It came out very quickly as well, and as two hungry college guys, we finished it right away. Luckily, the risotto came out soon after. The porcini was definitely strong and the risotto was cooked pretty well, so no complaints there. We definitely wanted more of it, however, as was a running theme throughout our meal; although it was a dinner for two, the portions are rather small if you're feeling voracious, so either pregame your meal or plan on getting an extra app or two.  The beef filets were very nicely cooked, a nice char adding a requisite amount of crunch while the meat itself was a solid medium-rare. The accompanying sauce was a bit too salty for my taste, but it really wasn't too bad. The medallions were again, somewhat small for two people to share, but we were both pleased by what we had. We ended our meal with a nice Coppa al Banana, which really hit the spot. Thx to Patrick and co.",0.9982,0.749,0.227,0.025,0.5256921373200444

I got the steak filet which wasn't very seasoned or tasty - our waiter was nice but the guy who ran our food out slammed the first meal down harshly after we weren't sure who had ordered it (didn't look like what we thought it would), pretty awkward. It was also pretty crowded inside. Overall, cool vibes and decorations but not worth how we were treated. We won't be visiting again.",0.8238,0.787,0.121,0.092,0.5875617283950617
2015-12-20,2.0,"Sad to report I can only say that the bread is good. Last day of a birthday weekend trip...reservations at 9:30pm. Arrived, hostess was pleasant as could be, then seated. Our waiter explained how the menu works and was never to be seen again. Correction...he walked past our table three times to go watch sports on the TV in the bar and to take silverware from one part of the restaurant to another, but refused to make eye contact.  We had picked our appetizers and wine and we're ready to order. Knowing the window of places open later on a Sunday evening was closing we decided to walk out after 15 minutes of being ignored. I hate leaving bad reviews, and I'm never the person to walk out, but this was beyond ridiculous. Now we are at RPM, who even without a reservation welcomed us and are being attentive and courteous. Thank you, RPM!! UPDATE - I received a phone call from a very concerned member of management today with apologies and offers of ""make it up to you"" drinks/food.  Keeping in mind that is all they can do at this point, let's also keep in mind that most establishments would not take the time to email, let alone make a personal phone call, an apology.  A big thank you for the professional response to my review.  For that alone, I will issue another star. It's nice to know that this was taken seriously, was a fluke only, and that I will definitely be giving Quartino another try......",-0.2705,0.786,0.105,0.109,0.5756944444444445

It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good. It's not worth the money or the hype. The pizza was too burnt on one side. The caprese salad came with 2 lumps of mozzarella cheese and 6 slices of tomatoes with some basil on top. The pasta we ordered was very...meh.

Quartino, by far, has been our best restaurant dining experience since her food allergy diagnoses. I called the day before to talk to someone about her allergies and the menu. He, as well as our two waiters, were highly knowledgeable about potential allergens in the food. The waiters even made sure I knew what tree nuts were in dishes. The bread they served was safe but they made a point to tell me that earlier in the day, raisin walnut bread was cut on the same machine as the bread we were eating. (Mind you she is only allergic to peanuts, not walnuts but they were extra careful to point everything out). There are NO peanuts in the restaurant. As of today, the only dishes with egg are the homemade pastas and polenta fries. My daughter had the bread, orichette, the farmhouse chicken and the Nutella panini. I've never seen her eat so much outside of our house. She is usually very cautious when trying new foods. The manager came to our table twice. First to tell us that the table side Parmesan had egg in it. And again at the end of the meal to ask us about our dining experience. He said they take food allergies very seriously and their service was stellar. We will absolutely return. We have always loved Quartino's but especially now.

Brodetto - loaded with fish, clams, shrimp, and squid! All of which were beautifully cooked! Paired with two hearty, brick sized toasts. Perfect for soaking up every drop of the aromatic broth!

I really enjoyed the various bruschetta that they gave us, especially the cherry tomato and mushroom. (they are separate ones) We had an interesting ravioli with braised pork, but I really enjoyed the Cavatelli (?) with tomato sauce, basil and ricotta. Our waiter asked if we wanted another dish of that and we all said ""yes!"" The last part of our luncheon was a dark chocolate fondue with fruit and Biscotti to dip. THIS STUFF IS LIKE CRACK! It is so unbelievably good and it took all the power in me to not grab the mini pot and drink it.

2015-11-02,4.0,"Quartino is a pretty tight spot for Italian food. My boyfriend and I were looking for a good place to grab a bit to eat and Yelp suggested this place. With all the good reviews, we decided to make a reservation on OpenTable. I'm glad we did, it was slammed when we got there! We made a reservation for 8:00pm and arrived on time. We had to wait about 5 to 10 minutes for our table to get ready, but that's not bad compared to the 1.5 hour wait they had going on.  To start, my boyfriend and I ordered some red wine. I can't remember what we got, but it was pretty good. For our appetizer, we got the white bean paste/hummus with bread. The paste was very fresh and you can taste the white bean, but it was just so thick. It was almost impossible to remove from the baking sheet they had underneath. They also don't give you enough bread with it, so I ended up dipping my pizza crust in the white bean paste. We ordered pizza as the main course. Being from New Jersey, we ordered the Soprano. It has Veal Meatballs, Giardiniera (pickled vegetables), Basil, & Red Chilis. The veal meatballs are perfection! They are so delicious and I wish I could just eat bowls and bowls of it. The pickled veggies took some getting used to. After the first slice, I kind of liked them, plus they added some zing to the veal meatballs, which I really liked. The size of the pizza is perfect for two. My boyfriend and I each had 4 slices and we weren't too full.  Overall, had a very nice dinner at Quartino. If I'm ever back in Chicago, I don't know if I'll come here again. I may want to try other restaurants around the area first before coming back to this place.

The soccer fan/player in me was fine with that, I guess, but my bigger disappointment was with the food. The prosciutto-wrapped dates were decent, but didn't really hit the spot, and the margherita pizza we ordered had a crust that I wouldn't typically associate with Neapolitan pizza. It was overcooked and dry. We ended up only eating a few pieces and taking it to go and giving it to homeless person. It was definitely very disappointing. The plus sides of our visit were the nice staff and good wine list, but in a city with so many great restaurants - let alone Italian options - I don't see any need to return to Quartino. The interior is very dated, and the entire vibe and staff attitude is of a place that's real draw is the prime location in a tourist-heavy area, as opposed to the actual food.

2015-09-30,2.0,"My friend made reservations here for four at 7pm. We were seated right away and got a corner booth. It was nice at first because we were secluded in our own privacy, but then we were at a loss to flag any waiter's attention when paying. We were in a rush to see the fireworks at Navy Pier, but failed to get our check and pay in a timely manner, so missed out on that. Now back to the important matter of food, we ordered the Salumeria Tasting ($25), which came with two salumi , two formaggi, three spuntini (sicilian caponata: eggplant salad, olives and capers / roasted peppers: hand charred, capers, garlic and evoo / artichokes campobasso: baby artichokes, onions, carrots and evoo), and an assortment of olives (black, green and red ones). I couldn't really remember the other types of salumi and formaggi that we chose, but overall it wasn't memorable. To pair our cheese and meat platter, of course we added a liter of wine. We originally asked for a bottle of Rosso, but the waiter insisted we get one liter for the four of us ($20). For starters, we also ordered the dates wrapped in pancetta ($7) and poleta fries ($8.50). I would say that these two were the best dishes. Both were flavorful and tasty, except you're not given much and it's gone within minutes. We also added the Brodetto Ai Frutti Di Mare seafood dish ($16.50), which came with shrimp, clams, calamari, octopus and whitefish simmered in aqua pazza with san marzano tomatoes. It came topped with two garlic toasts, which was good dipped in the sauce. It could've use more flavor as it was a bit watered down. This place just isn't something I'm in favor of. In addition, everything totaled up pretty pricey. There's definitely a nice Italian feel to the restaurant, but the service and food did not please me.",0.9689,0.849,0.107,0.045,0.48331608005521054

My husband could eat this way every night, and especially loved the spianata. The meats are cured in house. I loved the eggplant salad. It was fresh, light and perfectly seasoned. We also shared an order of rigatoni with lamb sugo and burrata. It was spectacular! We ordered a margherita pizza (for our kids) and zeppoli with chocolate sauce to go. They disappeared quickly, so I'm guessing they were good as well! Our server was friendly and attentive and the manager stopped by our table to say hello and make sure everything was to our liking.

Our tour guide told us this restaurant was like Italian tapas and that is exactly how I would describe it! Usually when I go to a restaurant I want to try all of the menu. At Quartino this was kind of possible! It was an awesome experience getting to try different dishes with my partner! We called a few minutes before getting there, around 8 and asked them of availability. They are super popular so they told us the inside area was full for the night but we could try and grab a seat at the patio/bar. We decided to try our luck and behold, the moment we got there we found a perfect spot open! Overall, I'd suggest reservations or getting there earlier, or being lucky like us haha! environment: cute! We sat outside near the inside dining area which was perfect. It was far enough from the street but at the same time we had the city outdoor vibe. The inside decor was a bit eccentric but in a good way! like a proud Italian restaurant.  food: great overall! tbh i'm not a HUGE Italian fan (i know everyones shuddering) but my partner is and I wanted to make her happy. But actually the food was really good! I enjoyed all the little dishes we ordered with my favorite being the veal skirt steak & the clam linguine! Again, the experience to try a bunch of little plates is awesome! They let you do half order on almost everything so we ordered close to 8 dishes! service: we had a very nice & sweet server, Kat, and another guy Joe G who was just so friendly, that he also was our server haha! It was clearly a long day for Kat, but despite this she was so positive, helpful, and sweet! she was very patient in showing us the menu and checked up on us the perfect amount. Joe G ended up serving our wine since Kat was a bit swamped and he was so friendly that we ended up talking a bit. He had a positive attitude and was giving us suggestions on what to do/sights to see in Chicago. He checked up on us and also gave us great recommendations on the menu.

Also, the spinach salad was enough for 3-4+ to share, but be aware, it is highly acidic. In fact toward the bottom it was inedible, and it burned our lips for being so salty/acidic.

We also had a risotto dish that was just OK. The consistency was a little bit runny, which is not how I like my risotto. We also had a tagliatelle with the heavy meat sauce that was decent. This is one of their house made pasta dishes and the consistency of the pasta was pretty good. They have a pretty extensive wine list offering primarily Italian wines, but some California wines thrown in for good measure.

They brought the perfect amount of bread so although we ordered for two, the whole table had a taste of it. As an entree we had the Manzo. It was really good. The short ribs were well seasoned and added a great flavor. Perfect size for two people. For wine we had the Amarone. It was good but not great.  One thing that really irked a few of us is the fact that we did not get actual wine glasses. Instead, they gave us small water cups. Super weird. It might seem like not a big deal but try drinking wine out of a small water cup. Yeah, I thought so.  Also, they don't split tabs which is kind of annoying for a big group like that. I know it's annoying for the waiters too but hey we're the ones paying, right? It really took forever to sort it out. On top of that, they added things that weren't ordered. Kind of annoying.

2015-09-09,2.0,"This place was just OK.  I don't really understand why everyone raves about it.  Here is what we ordered: 1) Calamari - It was pretty good. I liked the breading and it was not too chewy. Just your typical calamari though. 2) Polenta Fries - I had never had polenta before, but I really thought these were pretty gross. It is fried cornmeal.  Tasted like corn bread, without the sweetness of the corn. The sauce was good, I'll say that, but I will never get the fries again.  I really do not understand the appeal as many people recommended these. 3) Tortellini - This was actually pretty good I thought. I liked the sauce and thought the peas were a good compliment. Still, I didn't think it was anything to specifically go back here for. 4) Pizza (Half Pepperoni/Half Margherita) - So the pizza is another thing everyone seems to love.  I thought it was mediocre.  The pepperoni was definitely the better half. As for the margherita, it was basically over-cooked mozzarella(not-fresh) with no tomatoes and a giant basil leaf that looked like it was put on top after cooking.  Was not like another margherita pizza I have had and not in a good way. We had two pieces left of the margherita and I chose to leave the leftovers(not-typical). 5) Sorbetti - This was the best thing we had.  We got all three flavors and they were great. I liked the lemon and raspberry better than the orange, but the orange was still good. One thing I thought was strange was the way they serve the wine. We each ordered a 1/4 litre and it was served in a small carafe with a cocktail type glass. Just thought spending $10-$15 on a glass of wine, we would get a nice big red wine glass. It was seriously between a shot glass and a cocktail glass. Overall, there are much better and more affordable italian restaurants all around Chicago, so we will most likely not be back here.",0.998,0.709,0.25,0.041,0.4866666666666667

You can graze as you chat because the dishes are brought out as they are completed, like tapas, so you are constantly getting new little nuggets to enjoy.

2015-09-03,2.0,"I'm pretty confused as to why Quartino has such high reviews. We may have just ordered the wrong things though & maybe the salumeria is really the high on Quartino's menu. - Polenta Fries - Good! I could definitely eat these again...unfortunately that was the best part of the meal. - Veal Meatball Sliders - The meatball itself was dry; with no sauces or spreads on the slider, it made for a pretty unimpressive slider. I wish the giardiniera was at least a tad spicier.  - Asparagus Risotto - This was the most confusing and most disappointing dish. I'm sorry to say that I'm curious as to whether previous reviewers have had good risotto before. I get it - good risottos are hard and a lot of restaurants fall short, but I've rarely tasted such a bad one. A good risotto should be saucy enough to move & spread once you scoop it onto a plate, but thick enough to not run everywhere (think hot lava). This risotto was FAR too liquidy and ran like soup. It was underseasoned, which I imagine isn't hard if it's more watery than a perfect cheesy, creamy, buttery texture. Also, whatever cheese they used lended a gritty texture rather than a smooth one. If I had this dish alone, I'd rate it 1 star.  - Orechiette - This dish was mediocre, but at least edible. I'd say the pasta itself was a tad too thick and breadier than I'd like. Sauce itself wasn't bad at all. Overall, I wouldn't recommend any of the dishes except the polenta fries. Perhaps try the salumeria which seems to be much more highly reviewed.",0.979,0.777,0.153,0.07,0.60768115942029

Since we'd been drink hopping, we were hungry but willing to share plates.  For mentions sake; we got the Manzo pizza with braised beef short rib, gorgonzola fonduta, roasted fennel and walnut pesto.  The braised beef aspect was tasty but that's where the buck stopped for me..  We also ordered the gnocchi (potato dumplings, green beans, potatoes, & arugula pesto), which my friend stated, tasted off.  She'd been on a trip to Italy and still reminiscent of the many fantastic flavors experienced overseas.  Although my Italian is limited to American restaurants, I too thought the gnocchi was pretty average.  My last time having gnocchi was at Frasca and they outdid themselves.  It had some kind of roasted pumpkin and a brown butter sauce which elevated it to the highest levels.   Back at Quartino, food was alright but we couldn't see returning.  This is a popular intersection and I imagine rents are pretty high, which explains the extravagant cost of food and drink.   And to think, the only reason we came was because of an recommendation from a host at SideDoor.  SideDoor has got some great drinks and plates but I can't imagine why he sent us here?

The service is a little slow and becomes less prominent once your order is placed. Our waiter promised that ""the food comes out very quickly"" but that wasn't the case. We finished two loaves of bread before our first pasta dish came out. Wine is by the glass. Even if you order a pitcher (serves 4) or a bottle (serves 3) the price nets out the same. Our wine came a little corked. Our waiter was barely stuck around to ask us about it so we downed it anyway. The dishes are okay. They weren't Lydia Bastianich but they also weren't Chef Boyardee.

2015-08-19,3.0,"I've heard many good things about Quartino, so I was disappointed to be very underwhelmed upon my visit. The food was very mediocre, and the service was extremely slow. Calamari: I enjoyed the light texture of the breading of the calamari. The calamari itself was also well done, avoiding the pitfalls of hard chewiness that often is the issue with squid. However, I was not much of a fan of the tomato sauce; I appreciated their attempts to go beyond the typical cocktail sauce, but I felt like the sauce was missing the sour tang to balance out the slightly more rich nature of the breading. Pesto gnocchi: I love love love pesto, so naturally I went straight for this. However, I was very disappointed to find the sauce far too salty, the gnocchi doughy and too chewy, and the vegetables a major distraction from the pesto flavors. Paparadelle: I liked this one slightly better than the pesto--the noodles were a nice texture, and the tomato based sauce went very well with the tender braised beef. I found this dish also very salty, but not as bad as the pesto.  Tiramisu: This was by far the best dish of the night. Extremely light, slightly sweet, and very well balanced out with the more bitter chocolate and espresso flavors.  Overall, was quite unimpressed with the food. Perhaps I should've have gone for a pizza rather than two pasta dishes, but the food overall was extremely mediocre and too salty for the most part, with the tiramisu being the one saving grace.",0.9938,0.696,0.223,0.08,0.5313008130081301

First time in Chicago and this place has an abundance of reviews on yelp so of course I have to stop by. My boyfriend and I split the sampler, in which we got two meats, gorgonzola+ Fontina cheese, roasted peppers, artichokes, and pickled veggies. I wasn't too impressed with anything we ordered in particular, but the pairings that our waitress brought to go with our cheeses were DELICIOUS! The Apricot puree was to die for, and I would've been perfectly fine with eating just that with our cheeses and some bread (in fact, I wish we could have just substituted that for everything else) In addition, I ordered the Soprano pizza, which came with a TON of pickled veggies on top. I think this is a love/hate sorta item and I definitely wasn't loving the pickled toppings on my veal meatball pizza.

2015-08-03,2.0,"I'm extremely torn on writing anything about this place.  On the one hand, our visit here was a mess. On the other hand, we received abundant apologies from one of the restaurant group's managers Alysia. In terms of post-dinner customer service, this place deserves more than two stars for their effort to change our impression. But, for the dinner-as-experienced, this place still earns a Yelp ""Meh. I've experienced better."" We ate here late, after missing the kitchen at another restaurant during our recent visit to Chicago. It wasn't our first pick and a veteran of many a late-night eat, I tend to keep expectations fairly low no-matter the star-level because, well, staff get tired, people want to go home, etc, etc and so forth.  Even so, our visit here started out reasonable. They have outdoor seating and we were seated back towards what *is* an active driveway. Okay, not ideal. But, did I mention we were extremely hungry? Our server explained the menu to us - Italian tapas, communal serving, no control of the order dishes come to the table. Fine, fine, sounds good to us. But, the initial ordering was the beginning and end of consistent interaction with the staff. To start we ordered, three dishes for the table. One broccoli rabe side order, one fettucine alfredo, one stracci di grano arso. As we had never been here before and were unsure of the portion size to anticipate, we kept the initial order light.  The broccoli rabe came out speedily enough. Parts of it were burnt to a crisp, not charred, while other parts were slimey. It wasn't great, it wasn't good, but, it wasn't awful either. Just inconsistent in texture in a non-pleasing way. Eh, fine, onwards.  Second order: was plunked down by a woman who seemed ridiculously harried to get back to wherever she had came from. It felt like she threw it down on the table and disappeared. This was the fettucine alfredo. My grandmother always said fettucine alfredo is not a ""true italian"" dish, it's a bastard american cousin. Even so, this second dish was hardly anything American or Italian. The noodles weren't 'al dente' they were just straight undercooked and clumped together in a fashion you'd see from someone who had only today learned to cook pasta. Parts of them were hard, parts of them were soft. My dining partner said the sauce tasted ""doughy"", like in a rush they had thickened it with too much flour. And to make perhaps the most pedantic complaint of all (so pedantic I'm cringing at myself), these noodles were pappardelle. There are philosophical arguments about what is fettuccine, what is tagliatelle, what is pappardelle and what belongs in fettucine alfredo - as they're all wider-flat noodles. But, what I can tell you is a super-thick undercooked-over-floured sauce is pretty unpleasant with partially cooked thicker-than-the-average-fettucine noodles all congealed into an inedible clump. This dish wasn't pleasing at all. But, as I said before, we were hungry and it was late. Third plate: The third plate never came. An apology about the third plate never coming did come. But, by then we had pretty much formed the impression something here was broken tonight. Because of the way their ordering process works you really have no way of knowing if the kitchen is backed up and taking a long time or, as in our case, they've forgotten you completely and sent your dish to another table by mistake.  Pros:  -Their kitchen was open when we were visiting Cons:  -In the spirit of being true to yelp, we didn't have a very good meal here. Or really enough to count as a meal here. We ordered three dishes, were served two barely edible ones and a third was forgotten about by the staff and/or misdirected to another table.  That said, we were abundantly compensated for our time and negative experience with apologies, comped half-dinner and a gift card to come back and try them again next time.  I've only very rarely seen such active image management at anywhere other than the finest restaurant in New York. For being so attentive post-dinner they really deserve all the stars. However, the whole experience did make me wonder if they retain such high yelp rating through effective 'damage control' or if we really did catch the fluke-of a fluke-of a fluke, of an evening.  We have a gift card. I can't say whether or not we'll be back next time we're in the Chicago area. Our experience was fairly disappointing.",-0.9494,0.821,0.08,0.098,0.43142796384901644

The food came out very quickly and was super fresh and hot when we received it. The calamari was excellent. The best I've had actually, and it's one of my favorite foods so I eat it frequently. I would go back here just for the calamari one day. While the seafood was a knockout, the found the pizza to be just so-so. The pizza sauce was very bland, tasting almost like a simple tomato paste. It left a lot to be desired. My coworker mentioned the pasta is very good here, but we didn't try any pasta dishes so I can't speak to that. Overall, the ambiance was nice.

2015-07-23,3.0,"I wanted to like Quartino more than I did. I'm hovering between 3 and 4 stars, but to be honest, they're more like 3.25 stars, so I gotta round down! First and foremost, if you want to come here, make a reservation, even if it's a weeknight. My sister and I visited on a weeknight and the entry area was chaotic with people wanting to get a table and the place was hoppin'. We were definitely glad to be in the minority of people who actually made reservations. Our service was friendly, but spotty. We each ordered the tomato soup to start, but they brought them out one by one, so that my sister was almost done with hers by the time mine arrived. That seemed really odd. The soup was really good with nice chunks of tomato floating in a thick tomato puree.  My sister also ordered a couple of veggie dishes and I ordered the Bianca Pizza, all of which came out relatively close together. My sister like her veggie items, but the potato puree she ordered was just too rich for her to eat much of it. My Bianca Pizza was ok, but not spectacular. They overdid it on the onions which would have been much better if they had been caramelized and the other ingredients, rosemary and chilis, were too sparse. I ended up taking most of it back to my hotel for breakfast and then ended up dumping most of the leftovers in the garbage because I just couldn't stomach more of it.  Our waiter took my sister's potato puree off the tab, which was nice. She hadn't actually complained about it and we would have been happy to pay for it. My sister gave me some cash to help cover her portion and I gave our waiter the cash and my credit card and he agreed to charge the difference between the bill and the cash tendered. When the credit card receipt was presented, the cash was gone and he had charged the entire amount of the bill to my card. I would like to think the best of people, but I kinda think he was hoping I wouldn't notice so he could pocket the cash. He did rerun my card, so I'm hoping it went through correctly and there are not duplicate charges. I will know in a few days.  This is a restaurant that I think probably has potential to be great, but the service was off and food wasn't consistently great.

2015-07-16,3.0,"I really liked Quartino! There were a lot of options. We started off with the Salumeria Tasting - Parmigiano Reggiano Vacche Rosse (this has a very chalky, interesting texture, my sister and friend didn't like this one but I LOVED it), Fontina Val D'Aosta, Salamette, Prosciutto San Daniele, Sicilian Caponata (I really liked this dish), Roasted Beet Salad, and Artichokes Campobasso. We ordered the sausage pizza. I don't eat pizza (I'm not from Chicago so it's forgivable). I took one slice and it wasn't bad, not like amazing but still good. For the entrees, we shared the Beef Short Ribs and the Brodetto Ai Frutti Di Mare. The Beef Short Ribs was really tender and tasted good. The Brodetto Ai Frutti Di Mare is pot of various seafood (shrimp, clam, squid, octopus, and whitefish) simmering inside a thick tomato based broth. It was very, very, very salty. I love seafood so to my surprise I did not enjoy this dish as much as I thought I would. I paired everything with a glass of Malbec. For dessert, I tried the vanilla, lemon, and strawberry sorbets. My favorites were the Salumeria Tasting and the Sorbets. I know I should choose the main entree dishes not like an appetizer or dessert as my favorite, but I felt like the entrees did not stand out to me. Everything tasted good but not amazing. I really enjoyed the Salumeria Tasting though so if I ever go back to Quartino I think I would order everything on their Salumi, Formaggi, and Spuntini menu.",0.9845,0.733,0.181,0.086,0.5402083333333333

My friend and I are both vegetarians and they seemed to have a lot of options for that so that was very nice, plus our server told us they can alter ingredients to fit your needs. We ended up just ordering a pizza to share and all got a plate each for ourselves. We accidently got the wrong pizza but didn't realize it and it was super salty (rucolina instead of vegetarina). They got our correct order out with no charge for either due to the mix up and late arrival of our original order. I managed a bite of my boyfriends spaghetti which tasted delicious. I ordered the gnocchi and all I could taste was SALT. I couldn't finish the plate due to the overwhelming taste of salt on my palette. When our original pizza came out I did enjoy it although it looked exactly like the first. I expected a bit more vegetables and less arugula for a vegetable pizza. I'm no fan of salty things and this was overwhelming. I feel like I need to go back to try other options. OVERALL Service: 4 stars Food: 3 stars",0.9836,0.786,0.172,0.041,0.5409420289855073

We ordered fettuccine alfredo pasta, margherita pizza, and polenta fries. The amount of food we ordered was perfect for two to three people, and the quality of the food was not bad. Definitely not out-of-this-world yummy also. Very standard, plain fettuccine alfredo. The margherita pizza didn't taste like anything, but also was not disgusting. I kept hearing about the polenta fries, but they were really disappointing. Again, not bad, just disappointing. They didn't really taste like anything.

From the atmosphere to the melt in your mouth homemade pasta to the wait staff that treated us like we were sitting in their kitchen the whole night was above and beyond our expectations. It was explained to us how to work with the small plates; how many to order, what to order and that half plates could be ordered at half price (which I thought was extremely fair). One of the managers stayed at our table so long that I almost asked her to sit but this was a good thing! The manager seemed to be truly genuine and sincere and she was spending time getting to know us, using our names, asking for feedback and making recommendations! We felt like the chef was working for us! If we wanted something a little different from what we saw on the menu  there was no problem. We felt like we were the only people in the place and yet it was packed from wall to wall. An amazing experience beyond some of the best Italian food in Chicago. I'll be back.

2015-07-02,4.0,"We were told that we'd have an hour wait on a Wednesday night and it turned out to only be about 25 minutes. But I guess that's better than the other way around! I like that this place feels fun and casual, yet the food uses high-quality ingredients and is presented with class. We started with veal meatball sliders. Very tender veal and I liked the chopped giardieniera; it added just the right amount of spice. Also, the beef carpaccio was really enjoyable. Perfectly pink, sliced paper thin, and a lot of shaved reggiano cheese and some shaved celery.  The linguini with clams was solid, the pasta was perfectly al dente, and the sauce had plenty of butter and garlic. Needed a little S&P to balance it out. The Artesian sausage and peppers was pretty good. I liked the red sauce as it wasn't too heavy or overwhelming. The sausage had a pretty distinctive fennel flavor; it was fine, but I've had some better. The shrimp risotto was nice and hearty and believe me, they did not skimp on the shrimp. The zucchini and sun dried tomatoes complemented the shrimp but didn't distract from it, so the dish was well-balanced. Also, the Tucan kale salad may hvae been the best surprise of the meal. Organic cherry tomatoes, cucumber, onion, and plenty of pecorino cheese made  this the best kale dish I've ever had. this is a must-get. The rigatoni wasn't too good though. It had burrata cheese and a lamb ragu, so it was a darker red sauce. I enjoyed the addition of the lamb, but the combination of flavors was a little too heavy and the dish just had a salty flavor to it. For dessert, we did zeppole. They were incredibly light and airy. And dipped in that honey, it just made eating them even more fun! Cinnamon sugar might take them over the top though! I like that you can grate your own Gran Padana cheese at the table, I've never seen this anywhere else. The servers were very friendly and helped guide us through the menu and wine list. It's also kind of cool that they wear soccer jerseys. The prices were pretty fair, it came to $130 for three of us, including a bottle of red wine.

Hubs and I started with a spinach salad w/ pears, walnuts, & ricotta salata ($7.50).  Doesn't that sound good?  I thought so - but the salad had wayyy too many walnuts and barely any slices of pear.  The dressing it was all tossed in was lovely though.  Yummy salad, despite its lack of pear. And then there was the pizza. We selected a half sausage half pepperoni and, gosh, was it good.  Chewy bubbly crust, sweet sauce, fresh melted mozzarella cheese.  So good!  And you know how sometimes you order a pizza with toppings and wonder where the toppings are.  Not at Quartino.  The entire pie was covered w/ sausage and pepperoni.  A pizza and salad are both good sizes if you wanted to share w/ your date.  Everything was really good and filling, yet we didn't leave feeling heavy.  On my next visit to Chicago I'm totally going back to Quartino! A few other things of note -  The place is huge!  There's tables outside on the patio, two bars, a main dining room downstairs and another upstairs.  Its also beauuutiful inside.  It was one of the more authentic Italian restaurants I've been to with its open kitchen, rustic simple finishes, bread and slicer situated right in the middle of the dining room.  That bread was really good too.

The servers and staff continued going out of their way to provide us excellent service and they definitely achieved that. Food: A- The appetizers and entrees (other than the pizza) are tapas style (sharing). This does not certainly mean that the portions are big. They are definitely your average sized entree. We ordered the Veal Meatballs for the appetizers. These were very tender and were seasoned well (9/10). For the entrees, we ordered the Penne alla Vodka and the Shrimp Risotto. The Penne alla Vodka was great and the ratio between pasta to sauce was perfect, but it definitely didn't stand out (8/10). On the other hand, the Shrimp Risotto was definitely the contender that night. So good that we ordered another plate. I have never, ever had a risotto that excellent before. I honestly have no words for how amazing this dish is. You must order and see for yourself (REALLY - JUST DO IT).

A manager, Alysia, stopped by to check on us and I suggested them getting gluten free crust. 20 minutes later, my favorite pizza was in front of me. Alysia ran to the nearby Trader Joe's and picked up gluten free crust so I could enjoy the pizza I had missed so much.

Asiago Vecchio - lovely cheese, make sure you pair it with the apricot.  5. Manzo pizza - short rib was super flavorful, pesto was amazing but a little too much fennel for my taste.  6.

Those two gentlemen could not have been more amazing.  They even brought some pizza and simple pasta items for some of the kids in our party who weren't interested in the fancier items on our special menu.  And there was no extra charge.  I highly recommend reserving this room and going with Quartino's if you have a small party of 20-40 people.  From booking the event to paying the bill, the experience was really a treat.  We fondly remembered our time in Chicago enjoying Quartino's and the city.",0.9957,0.706,0.269,0.025,0.5503042328042328

2015-05-31,3.0,"Quartino is a tapas style restaurant where everything that you order is meant to be shared with your group. Obviously you don't have to do things that way, but that's the main gist of the place. I came here with my family, and we ended up getting the Margherita pizza, veil, prime roast rib, and tortellini. Overall, the food was good. My favorite dish was the tortellini Alfredo with prosciutto. For dessert we had the Zeppoli with Nutella. (Fried dough)  The service of the food was okay. It did take a while for dishes to come out, and it didn't help that we kept filling up on bread. On the bright side, the bread was absolutely amazing. The tables had oil with sea salt. You can ask for cheese separately, in which the waiters give you your own grated cheese device. The cheese is Pana Di Grana, which is something completely new to me. (And I'm Italian!) The ambiance of the restaurant was very packed. For being a Sunday night, we were so close together, we could hear conversations from other tables. It sometimes felt a little claustrophobic to the point that I wanted some fresh air or had to distract myself with my phone from the amount of people being backed into a dining room.  Our waiter, Adam, was really nice and answered all of our questions thoroughly. It was cool seeing him and the staff wearing Italian sports jerseys.  Quartino's feels like the place you go to when you can't check out your local Italian grocery store for the same products. Maybe I'm just missing the bandwagon on it.

It was actually not good or flavorful so I would definitely pass. 6) Seafood pasta- You can choose between red or white sauce. We chose white but I still didnt find it very flavorful.

2015-05-25,4.0,"I had done my research thoroughly before my friend and I took a trip for the weekend to Chicago, and Quartino was at the top of my list for must try's for a meal based on the menu and reviews.  We went to Quartino on a Friday night at about 9pm.  Everywhere in Chicago was packed, so I wasn't sure how it would go getting seated without reservations.  We were quoted about half an hour, which was much shorter than I anticipated, but were also advised that you could sit anywhere in the bar, first come first serve.  My friend and I got a drink in the bar while we waited, which was a little pricier (Malibu & Pineapple for $10 and glass of wine for $11), but they were very good and it's a nice restaurant so no complaints there.  Even with the crowd, we didn't wait very long, and the restaurant texts you when you're table is ready, which I thought was very cool and convenient if you wanted to leave and come back.   We were seated upstairs so went up a flight of stairs and sat down at our table.  The restaurant has a very fun and loud atmosphere.  Everyone talking boisterously and having a great time.  It is not a place (at least on a busy night) for a quiet intimate meal).  You are seated very close to other tables and it felt a little crowded, but not too terrible.   The service was wonderful and our waiter was absolutely great.  He took the time to explain the menu and help us make decisions that we would like.  I wish I had remembered his name, but he was a blonde male and very attentive throughout the night.   My friend and I were very hungry and excited to try new things so we got a pretty good variety of different plates on the menu.  They give you some warm bread that you dip in some great olive oil/balsamic when you are seated.  We started out with the burrata that is a mozzerella ball that you can tell is fresh and made in house, filled with mozzerella shreads and cream on top of some greens and beets.  I absolutely loved the burrata, but would've rather seen it on top of greens and grape tomatoes with balsamic.  The beets seemed a little strange with mozzerella.  We got caprese, which had the freshest basil we had ever tried.  It was delicious and fragrant.  We then got our sulami plate, which had proscuitto and sopressata.  Both meats were delicious and the perfect serving size for us to share.  We got the filet, which was delicious, though in my opinion quite small for the price.  It was two very small cubes of meat, so a total of about 4 small bites for $13.00.  It was very tender though, and perfectly cooked, though if you don't like your meat rare, you may want to request to have it cooked a higher temp.  For myself, though, I would not want to eat it any different than rare.  It had a wonderful flavor to it.  We got the sauteed spinach with E.V.O.O. & garlic and it was the best spinach we have ever had!  It was fresh and cooked perfectly with a delicious garlicky and aftertaste of lemon flavor.  It was a good portion and honestly I would've been happy if I had just eaten a big plate of spinach for my whole meal.  We couldn't resist dessert, and we ordered the Torta al Cioccolato, which can be described as a fluffy and delicious chocolate cake almost resembling the lava cake, with vanilla gelato on top, and the Zeppole.  The zeppole had an amazing presentation that one can't resist, coming out as hot fried donuts with powdered sugar on top and sides of honey and dark chocolate.  This was probably the only disappointing part of my meal.  They looked amazing, but inside tasted very eggy and wet, and did not seemed cooked on the inside.  I could only eat a part of one and the rest unfortunately, went to waste.   My friend and I left feeling satisfied, but not full.  I think it was the perfect amount to eat without feeling like we had to roll ourselves out of there.  It came to about $90 for the two of us, with several choices of plates and 2 alcoholic beverages included.  I definitely would love to return and try more options!",0.9997,0.724,0.25,0.026,0.599989138698816

2015-05-16,5.0,"Quartino was definitely one of those restaurants that took my breathe away in Chicago.  There's not many places I can say that about, but everything about Quartino was absolutely perfect.  From the fact that it's an Italian *Tapas* restaurant to friendly, helpful, and beyond informative wait staff, to amazingly affordable and inexpensive prices for fabulous food - it was absolutely the best of the best.   My friend, Breanna B., and I met for lunch when we both conveniently happened to be in Chicago and Quartino seemed to be the place to go because the menu was super inviting and there was an excessively affordable deal of $25 for a 2-person 3-course lunch.  Little did we know how blown away we'd be with the food and service we were given.  From the most spectacular homemade silky, smooth ricotta with the crustiest-but-soft homemade bread to delicious polpette veal meatballs in a rich and vibrant tomato sauce (one where you could actually taste real tomatoes and not that tin-like taste you get from the can!), to a perfectly moist and succulent half-roast lemon herb chicken, everything was seasoned and cooked to the most penultimate degree.  On top of that, our waiter gave us recommendations on the menu, kept our glasses full, and even told us of some menu secrets to give us a wider range of options to choose from and taste.  We even got to watch him slice the table ciabatta baguette in the most amusing auto-bread slicing machine in the back too!  It was a truly slice of pure heaven.   So I guess it probably makes sense when I say I will probably remember Quartino for as long as I live.  When you're put face-to-face with quality as good as this where not a single flaw could be found, it's something that just sticks with you.  And It's ridiculously easy to get to too since it's maybe only a block or two down from the Grand Red station!  Because of that, along with the reasons mentioned above, I will probably be making it a point to stop here on all future Chicago visits.",0.9982,0.754,0.223,0.024,0.5538454270597127

The food doesn't disappoint and the house red is very good.  Anything on the menu will please and you can even go off if you want, (my favorite off menu trek is gnocchi bolognese).  The servings, like the main dining room, are family style and for 2 people 3-4 items is more than enough. There is also a nice, smaller dining room off to the side that looks onto State St.  I celebrated my first dating anniversary with my now fiancé here and it was a wonderful, romantic experience.  As a side note, I had flowers delivered to the restaurant ahead of time and they were in the vase on the table waiting for us.  I got the flowers from an online service that sends the accompanying message on a computer generated card; the staff had transcribed it into beautiful script by hand. You really can't go wrong here, be it by taste or price.  I would just recommend making any weekend reservations well in advance as the secret on this place is out and it books up quick.

We had a sampler:  3 salads, 2 cheeses, 2 salami, and an olive assortment. It also came with a nut bread and apricot purée.  Salad # 1:  some sort of eggplant - it was just fair.  Salad #2 :  roasted beets with ricotta.  I hate beets and I really liked this one Salad # 3:  a not very memorable artichoke dish. Salami  #1:  duck prosciutto - nice! Salami #2.   Black truffle.  Delicious.  Extensive wine list sold by the carafe:  quarter, half, or full liter.  There are hidden deserts not on the menu:  tiramisu that was delicious.  The canolis were great too. Overall a good experience.  Decent food.

When we arrived it was slightly dead so we opted to sit in bar area. The squid was good and seasoned ok. The veal meatballs were really good and so were the mussels we ordered. The drinks were very refreshing and made very well. Then we chose to do the Salumeria Tasting and we made some good and blah chooses. While enjoying our late lunch , all of a sudden we just notice that the whole bar and most of the dining area became full.

The place was pretty loud and was crowded (it was Saturday night so not surprised). We ordered pizza, egg plant Parmesan, polenta fries, and the white bean and garlic dip. Of these the pizza was good, polenta fries was average and white bean dip was average. The egg plant Parmesan was not anything great, i have definitely had better. Though we were so full I wanted to get some desert to make us feel happy :P So ordered the Torta al Cioccolato, which was like s scoop of venilla ice-cream on top of molten hot chocolate cake.

The ravioli was probably my favorite, but the roasted pork shank was nearly melt-in-your-mouth.  The desserts went beyond description and we all were overwhelmed by the Italian doughnuts served with honey, chocolate sauce, and at our server's recommendation, also Nutella for dipping.

Next I ordered the duck prosciutto pizza.  This was really tasty, and I would order it again.  Took home what I didn't finish. Four stars because while I did not enjoy my first two items, I also wasn't charged for them.  We all know this is what SHOULD happen but oftentimes does not (unless we pitch a fit).  I was appreciative of the restaurant's willingness to appease me, and that kind of service goes a long way in my book.",0.9779,0.828,0.141,0.031,0.5092592592592594

2015-04-03,5.0,"SO GLAD that I ended up at Quartino on my recent trip to Chicago. Traveling with my fellow food(ie) lover girlfriend, we had a whole list of reservations for our trip. While planning out our dinners, we knew we needed some Italian in the mix. After researching on Yelp, we both happened to pick Quartino as our top choices. Small plates, lively atmosphere, and good prices - score! I personally chose Quartino because it didn't seem like your typical Italian restaurant and looked like something different than what you can get in San Francisco (where we're from). Entering the restaurant, I already loved the lively atmosphere. There are a bunch of tables and everything is pretty tight in terms of tables and the space at your table. Probably difficult if you come in a large group. But cozy/romantic for smaller groups or 2! We definitely had to shift things around on our table to accommodate our plates coming to the table. Service was good - our server was very friendly and attentive.  The best part? Their food! Everything we ordered was delicious and on point. I love solid Italian food. Between the two of us, we ordered a Salumi sampler, Margherita Pizza, Linguine with Clams, and Eggplant Parmigiana. Along with that, we split a delicious bottle of Pinot Grigio. Four dishes was on the heavier side for two people, but we couldn't resist trying everything. Definitely a place I wish I went to with a group so I could order more dishes. Although everything was top notch, the dish that stood out for me was the Eggplant Parmigiana - it's safe to say this is the best version of it I have ever had. Overall a great experience here. I would recommend it to anyone who loves or even likes Italian food - yourself and your stomach will leave very satisfied and happy. Delicious food and fun environment.

For my friend and I, our bill still came out to be ~$50 (with tax and tip) for 3-4 plates and a 1/2 liter of wine. But everything we ate was phenomenal!  My personal favorites were the roasted baby octopus and the duck prosciutto. The baby octopus was tender, well seasoned, and served alongside some greens. Such magic. The duck prosciutto was served in tiny pieces, but each bite was so deliciously fatty and flavorful that we were able to make it last for quite awhile. Ultimately, this is worth the visit.

For whatever reason, the server seemed annoyed that we decided not to do family-style. From that point on, our server wasn't the nicest (1st star down for customer service). I ordered the homemade gnocchi which was very good, but not 4-star+, amazing good. The gnocchi was about $10.75, so not bad at all for the portion size and quality. That being said, I've had better Italian food elsewhere in Chicago (Briciola in Ukrainian Village for example, comes to mind). Finally, the ambiance of Quartino was not my cup of tea.

The food was just okay but nothing that other tapas bars can't replicate or execute better. We ordered some of the more popular dishes like polenta fries, veal sliders, shrimp and sausage risotto.  My favorite was probably the polenta fries since I've never had it presented that way before. It also came out piping hot which was a plus. Veal sliders were decent and my friends seem to liked them quite a bit.   I was not as impressed with the infamous pork shank. Ours came out dry and was tough overall.  It tasted a lot like leather after chewing my way through my first bite. However, as I got to the center of the shank, it got better and the meat did indeed slide off the bone.  My biggest gripe though, is the seating arrangement. I get that restaurants want to utilize their real estate as much as possible, especially when they're likely paying both arms and legs for competitive spaces smack-dab in the middle of downtown.  However, this place takes it up a notch as you can probably taste the food of tables around you if you tried hard enough.  Again, I don't blame them for doing this to accommodate their large volume of customers but I had hoped for a less intimate experience with the foodies that night.",0.9879,0.803,0.163,0.035,0.597383689107827

I will also begin by saying that the service was great and the staff was very friendly and attentive, along with the managers. But the food here is just not good. We came here last night, and ordered vodka martinis to start. Very good, but at 14$ a piece, we should have gotten wine. My father ordered the minestrone, and I ordered the prosciutto wrapped dates. The dates were amazing, but the minestrone was just okay. Not bad, but again, just soup. My mother joined us and we ordered the crispy calamari, soppressata, beet salad, skirt steak, and the rigatoni with butternut squash and pancetta. 1. the calamari just tasted like any other calamari you could get at an Italian restaurant, basic fried with marinara sauce. Not bad, but again, nothing special and not worth the price. 2. The soppressata was extremely bland and flavorless. A very small portion came out. 3. The beet salad was again very bland and flavorless. It just tasted like plain beets that had been diced, and thrown in with some walnuts and some very dry ricotta cheese. 4. The skirt steak was another very small portion. Again, I understand that this is a tapas restaurant, we have been here countless times and to other tapas restaurants in the city. But when you order a meat dish, the meat should be the biggest portion of the dish. There was more plain arugala salad and roasted tomatoes on the plate than steak. Again, not bad, but not worth the price. 5. Finally, we get to the rigatoni. We ordered it per the recommendation of our waitress, and this is probably one of the worst things I've ever ordered at a restaurant. I was told by the manager that it's an ""acquired taste"" and that some people either love it or hate it, but I can't see how anyone could love plain boiled noodles sprinkled with plain boiled butternut squash. There was no sauce, it was extremely dry, and I couldn't taste any seasonings, not even salt or pepper.  The waitress was very kind and took it off our bill, but at a total of $100 still for all of this, we will not be returning.

Pasta: Potato gnocchi with argula pesto, I mean besides the fact that every server said gnocchi funny, they were homemade and delicious. Fettuccine with fresh tomatoes and evoo. Yum.

2015-03-14,4.0,"I was downtown with two friends today and we were looking for a place to eat lunch at. Unfortunately it was St. Patrick's Day so everything was super crowded... EXCEPT Quartino had tables! My roommate had recommended this place to me earlier this year so we decided to stop there for lunch. We were seated really quickly and given menus and bread (which, by the way, is freshly sliced with a cool machine and actually delicious with their olive oil and balsamic vinegar). However, it seemed that they expected us to order immediately and when we didn't, they just kind of left us and forgot to come back and take our order. I had to flag them down in order to put in our order, BUT the food did come out pretty quickly afterwards. EXCELLENT (would absolutely order again): Panino al Gelato Limone - lemon cream gelato sandwiches with lemon curd, whipped cream, and lemon chips. The scoops of lemon cream gelato were very generous and lemony and delicious, but the sandwiches were made of sponge cake (a little firmer, I think) and they were SO GOOD. They were soaked in lemon curd and topped with whipped cream... we talked about this dessert for the whole way back to campus. This is definitely a must-order dish. PRETTY GOOD (would probably order again): The pappardelle with braised beef. The beef wasn't a standout for me, but I loved the toothiness of the pappardelle strips, which were cooked perfectly. The veal meatballs in tomato/raisiny sauce were also really good because the sauce was a touch sweet and the meatballs were very tender and well-seasoned. AVERAGELY GOOD (probably would skip next time): The calamari was a little too oily and heavy and salty for our taste, but I can see why so many people on Yelp love it. Also the kale salad was good, but it seemed like something I could toss together at home if I tried hard enough. Overall our bill was 52 bucks without tip, so for three people, that was pretty good! I definitely want to come back and try more pastas and pizza.",0.9984,0.758,0.23,0.012,0.555493827160494

Waiters were friendly, funny, and swift with the food & drinks. They have a gluten-free menu, which was nice for a few in our party. Apple and bread fondue was a good starter. Favorite dishes were the beef short ribs and the skirt steak.  Now for the negatives: The chicken was dry and the gluten-free pasta was horrendous. Rock solid noodles and bad flavor on that sauce. Would have been better to use the sauce from the sausage? If you're going to go gluten free, skip the pasta. Also they gave us the wrong dessert and still charged for it. Overall, would go back for the fun items and to try the pizza.

2015-03-08,3.0,"I would rate Quartino as a solid three stars. Good food, good service, I just wasn't really blown away with any of the dishes.  We started out with the polenta fries with red bell pepper salsa. It was pretty tasty and came out very hot, so it clearly was made fresh. While the first few bites were interesting, it became a little bland and boring and my husband ended up finishing the dish. I will say that he loved these and thought they were very good.  We then ordered the veal meatballs, which were served in tomato sauce with basil and topped with ricotta. This dish was quite good, but again I felt it was missing some flavor. It also became cold quite quickly. Neither me nor my husband were impressed with this dish.  Next was shrimp with garlic, red chili, pinot grigio, E.V.O.O. and lemon juice. Very fresh, bright, and acidic with nice garlicky notes. Again, a solid dish but nothing special.  The gnocchi with green beans and arugula pesto was my favorite of the night. It was interesting and had a nice mix of flavors and textures.  We also really enjoyed the campania pizza, which had a very nice, tender and slightly chewy crust and was topped with fonduta, ricotta, roasted cherry tomatoes, and basil leaves. This was a very good pizza if you are looking for something a little different. I really liked the oven roasted tomatoes, it gave the pizza an intense tomato flavor.  We finished the meal with the zeppoles, which were deep fried dough balls dusted in powdered sugar and served with a side of honey and dark chocolate sauce. These were very good, but also very rich. They were excellent with the hot, strong coffee we ordered to accompany them.  Like I said, this place serves solidly good food, and you won't regret eating here. However, I think there are other restaurants that take the flavors a bit further and will create a more memorable impression.",0.998,0.728,0.253,0.019,0.6030458221024261

Our bill was $50 - for us small town folks this was a pricier splurge meal, but absolutely worth it.  The atmosphere was great too. It's louder, but we could hold conversation just fine.

I have been here many times over the past 3 years and it has never failed to disappoint. My husband and I usually order drinks, a main dish, vegetables, and an olive/cheese tray. The portions are small, which they are upfront about, so the prices might be a little misleading on the menu e.g. $13 for pork shank. But the best part about this menu is that you can try more dishes for around the same price as ordering two entrees at another restaurant. I like that the portions are small because I usually end up taking home leftover pasta at other restaurants (no left over guilt)!The prices are fair and you leave feeling full.  I will suggest a few things about the atmosphere. It can be very loud as it is family style so keep that in mind. Also if you casually drop in on a Friday or Saturday night, you probably will hear ""we don't have a table until 10 pm"".

2015-02-27,4.0,"Food was simple and delicious, carried in waves to and from the table as our group was caught up in conversation tucked away in our own room. Wine, too, was flowing. For our group dinner, the meal consisted of four courses, served family-style: antipasti, paste, pesce e specialita and dolci. When we sat down, plates of Roasted Beet & Walnut Salad, Assorted Bruschette and Polenta Fries were already waiting for us. The beet salad was earthy, not overly sweet, and sprinkled with walnuts and fresh ricotta salata. A trio of bruschette were topped with peppery arugula, warm Sicilian eggplant and portobello mushrooms (each separate) and, of course, cheese. These warm, crisp toasts served as a much better start to the meal than a basket of bread. By themselves, the polenta fries were a little under-salted and under-seasoned; but use them to mop up heaps of red sauce, and all is forgiven. Paste was next, and the dishes in this course were especially comforting: Gnocchi with Arugula Pesto and Spaghetti con Pomodoro. The gnocchi were soft, pillowy and just a tad chewy (as they should be) sitting in a shallow pool of pesto alongside green beans and potatoes. Spaghetti con Pomodoro isn't a complicated dish, but Quartino's Pomodoro is a light, lovely fusion of tomato and basil. The Pesce e Specialita - for us, Salmon and Chicken - fell a little flat. The fish was dry and chewy, which I've never had before in salmon. Dolci, though, made up for it. Dessert was Tiramisu - a layered, soaked cake treat that's not for the faint of appetite. An amalgamation of flavors, including coffee, cocoa and mascarpone, Quartino's Tiramisu is almost too much, but then you share with a friend (or two), and it's suddenly just the right amount of rum, ladyfingers and cocoa to cap off a meal. You'll leave feeling full, but in all the right ways.",0.9831,0.885,0.105,0.009,0.5486815156169994

Very good: duck prosciutto pizza; delicious veal meatball sliders; succulent baby octopus; braised pork ravioli, profiteroles are great (Comparatively) unremarkable: braised pork shank is well done but without any distinctive flavor; veal meatballs napoli are a bit too sweet; eggplant parmesan too oily and one-dimensional.

Our server was truly hustling with his huge section but he got everything done and was just so genuine. He took the time to help us sort through the extensive menu and choose wine, all with a smile (a real one).  Thirdly, the atmosphere couldn't be better. It's crowded and just the right amount of loud where you know every one is having a great time.

2015-02-19,5.0,"I am not a big pasta eater. I generally don't crave a big Italian dinner. One thing I do love, however, is great food with great flavor! I also love trying many different things. Quartino is my favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago, and I don't go there for the pasta, eggplant parmesan, or the pizza. While those dishes are amazing as well, their seafood dishes and meat dishes are also incredible. After winning a bet over which team would score the first touchdown during the Super Bowl, Valentine's Day dinner was my choice! I knew right away that I was in the mood for Quartino, and everything that they have to offer. If you are wanting a private, romantic atmosphere, Quartino is not the place to choose. It is loud and crowded, but it somehow feels like a family gathering. I LOVE that. The lighting is dim, which does make it feel slightly more intimate. On to the food... We pretty much knew EXACTLY what we would be ordering before we even got there. We are pretty loyal to our favorite dishes, but are always trying at least one new thing each time. We started out by ordering their house red wine. The rosso. It is only $20 dollars for an entire liter, and we enjoyed it. We ordered the cheese fondue which comes with bread to dip. We added apples to the order, because apples and cheese... killer combo! The fondue is a really nice dish, because it's something to nosh on as you wait for your other dishes to arrive. The grilled octopus is really good, as well. It has a slightest of a spicy kick to it. It's really good! It is a must-order for me. The steamed clams are phenomenal! They actually give you a decent portion with grilled bread. You will need that grilled bread to soak up the delicious, brothy sauce that the clams are served in. If you are pasta lover, I highly recommend the cavatappi. It is a house-made pasta that is extremely doughy in texture, which I like. It is slathered in a marinara sauce with fresh basil. I cannot forget to mention that it is also topped with globs of ricotta. Perfect! My boyfriend always chooses the meat dish since he is more of a meat-eater than I am. Per recommendation of our fabulous server, Juan, we chose the veal skirt steak. IT. WAS. PERFECT. We finished our meal with espresso and a vanilla gelato with bananas.

For the main dish, I had a half order of the Cavatelli and a half order of the Tortellini.

Great service always adds to a good night as well.,0.9823,0.648,0.352,0.0,0.48333333333333334
2015-02-12,5.0,"That's Amore...My Italian Stallion!  Quartino is an Italian bar & restaurant in downtown Chicago, IL that's known for its wine, pizza & tapas-style portions. It's not the new kid on the block but it warrants being my lucky review number double 5 as it's worth 5 gems times 2! I've been here many times but it's one of my very fave, go-to places in Chicago, especially when I'm feelin' bad & carby! You cannot go to Quartino & not overindulge in some serious carb-overload, ain't happenin'! Don't even try to resist, work it off tomorrow! I've never had a bad meal or tried anything I didn't like at Quartino. Whoa! I know, a rare statement comin' from this biznitch! You can customize anything on the menu at Quartino & no one bats an eye! Sub it, swap it, add it, hold it, halfzies, whole-size...you ask, they're game! Everything on the menu is designed to share & can be ordered as half or whole-order, including bottles o'wine! So you can & tote should sample a lil o'everything! First, you must get the polenta fries with red bell pepper salsa dippin' sauce. They come in a 3-teaser or an 8-ball amount. They're OMG, fried indescribable stix o'crack, my fave lil app here! Also, erbody gets a loaf o'hot, crusty, Italian bread! Any of the salads at Quartino are friggin' awesome. If you like kale, you'll luv the Tuscan Kale Salad. It's got roasted butternut squash, sweet-n-sour onion, borlotti beans & of course lotsa, gemmy kale, duh! I had this salad on my last visit & it was supa fresh, tangy & a kale of a way to start your meal! The Shaved Spring salad is another gem fave! For veggie side dishes, I heart the brussel sprouts that are roasted with EVOO & are crispy & insanely good! I also luv the roasted peppers, a mix o'multi-colored bell peppas roasted in EVVO.  I'm not a big fan o'meatballs but you should get some o'these guys. My fave are the Polpette al sugo di pomodoro: veal meatballs in organic tomato sauce w/fresh basil & house-made ricotta. Um, these balls are amazeballz!  You can't go wrong with any of the pasta dishes here either. Stracchi di Grano Arso is a gemmy, vegetarian pasta dish: Broccoli rabe, tomato, onion, garlic, red chili, EVOO & bursting with friggin' flava! If you're feelin' clammy, you can't beat Linguine w/clams: EVOO, red chili, Pinot Grigio & red sauce. The noodles are perfectly al dente with robust sauce & nice lil clammies! For dessert, I like a scoop o'gelato. The gelato is creamy, smooth & the flavors are all gemliciously on point! I usually get lemon gelato cuz it's refreshin' after a big carby meal! If you wanna super, spesh dessert get Panino al Gelato Limone: lemon cream gelato sandwich w/lemon curd, whipped cream, & lemon chips. It's big enough to share & it's like eatin' a light, fluffy, OMG lemon cloud sent from above! Ok, I saved the best for last & the reason I always come back to Quartino for more! My weakness & fave kinda pizza is traditional, ""Neapolitan-style pizze"". I don't eat 'em that often, but when I do I wanna make it count! I eat & try 'em all over, but I still like Quartino's Neapolitan-style 'zas da best! Quartino has a variety o'yummy pizze options to choose from or ya can customize one to your liking! My fave is the Vegetarina Pizze: asparagus, cauliflower, zucchini, eggplant, wild arugula & add mushrooms. My other fave is the Quattro Staggiano. The pies are about 12"" & are big enough to feed 1-2 people. The crust in the middle is super thin & soft but the outer crust is an uneven, bubbly ring that has a perfect, chewy-crunch to it. It has just the right amount of tangy/garlicky, tomato sauce & isn't overpowered by a ton o'cheese but is packed with uber, fresh veggies on top, just the way I heart mia pizza pies! Seriously, you're gonna luv any o'the pizzes here if ya like this kinda 'za!  Quartino is upbeat, lively & always packed. You can make a rez on Yelp or Open Table or just walk-in & grab a seat at the bar. Quartino is huge with dining rooms & a bar on both floors & also has an outside patio. It's casual-trendy & the ambience is rustic-sheik. The service here is accomodating, quick & to the point. I'm happy to yelp all the servers I've had at Quartino have all been informative of the menu & helpful with recs if needed. (Gem Rule#1: Know the Menu or at least fake it! Idk is NOT an acceptable answer! I hate it when I go to places that break this rule!)  So if you're visitin' Chicago or it's been awhile, I highly recommend goin' to Quartino to try a lil or a lotta different, gemazin' Italian bites & ya must get one o'my fave Neapolitan pies & an order o'polenta fries! I do like tryin' other places for Neapolitan 'zas & other Italian fare, but when all other dinner plans go South, get 86'd, are a no-go or nothin' else sounds good, Quartino is my fall back cuz he's da best, knows how to treat me & knows just what I like! He's always waitin' on State Street to take me back in & show me a good time & feed me a fuggin' molto bene meal... And That's Amore!",0.9989,0.777,0.163,0.06,0.43288934642593185

That's not to say the food is not tasty, the appetizers are quite appealing. This is a GIANT restaurant, but it's cut up into several bar areas so it doesn't seem as large as it is. Which is good.

2015-01-30,2.0,"Constrasting opinion about this restaurant: ranges from bad to very good. Veal Meatballs are original, not dry and tasty. Presented as mini-hamburgers with a crunchy bread.  The pastas are absolutely a FAIL. They are swimming in a soup instead of a sauce. The taste is impossible to define: meat ? cheese ? tomato ? None is recognizable. The raviolis combine pork meat, sausage, cheese and others. Ingredients are not good, for instance the sausage is too hard. Moreover, the whole does not makes sense. Unlike, the pizza is really good. The crust is fine and crusty. The ingredients are fresh, it is not loaded with a ton of cheese. A few tomato, some basil and it rules ! Prices are reasonnable.  The room is big, a little bit noisy and the service moody. The waiter seems to have been choosen in the street.",0.5367,0.8,0.111,0.088,0.5117708333333334

2015-01-27,4.0,"Came here for a friends birthday dinner with 9 ladies, and we loved this place!  It was tapas style... the Italian way! Can't say no to that.  The atmosphere and vibe got us excited the minute we walked in! All the tables are really close so the restaurant is quite loud but everyone looks like they're having a blast. We had dinner at 8:30pm on a Friday, so we expected there to be a crowd.  The food and drinks were fantastic. We shared 2 liters of wine: one red and one white. The toscana red wine was my favorite. As far as the food, our waiter knew there was 9 of us and 1 vegetarian so he made sure everyone got the try everything when it came out. We ordered: 1) Campinia pizza (ricotta basil tomato): amazing! 2) Polenta fries: a little too plain for my taste.. basically a huge grainy fry 3) Eggplant Parmigiana: cheesy and delicious. not the best eggplant I've ever had, but still delicious.  4) Burrata and beets: I'm not a fan of burrata but the beets and mint were delicious.  The meat dishes were Pancetta-wrapped dates and pappardelle pasta which were both devoured by the party.  The service was fast and attentive, our waiter was knowledgeable about our taste and really catered to our party despite the crowd. He even suggested the best part of the night - the birthday girl's ""cake"". Usually reserved for bachelorette parties, this cake was a dose of humor and absolutely DELICIOUS. take a look at my picture for more information :)  Overall, fantastic food and service for an incredibly reasonable price and we were all stuffed afterwards.",0.9971,0.724,0.241,0.035,0.6044252044252045
2015-01-26,4.0,"Well, color me happy! Quartino is a refreshing change of pace from all the other high-brow and overpriced Chicago restaurants that I've been frequenting. This place is affordable, fun and most importantly, delicious! Came here with a large group for a friends birthday and we were all thrilled with our experience. The server was extremely helpful and let us know that this tapas bar was the kind of place to order and share a bunch of dishes, which we did, happily. We had a table of 9, so he was accommodating when certain dishes only had 6 servings and he let us know in advance so we could get one and half orders or whatnot. First, we got two bottles of wine - one red, one white. They came out in interesting bottles and glasses, but as long as it tasted good, then we didn't really care. There was also freshly made bread for the table (always a crowd pleaser). Here's a rundown of what we ordered and had bites of: 1. Pancetta-wrapped dates: a little on the sweeter side for me but the birthday girl loved them! 2. Campinia pizza (ricotta basil tomato): tasty but nothing extraordinary, great thin crust though. 3. Polenta fries: really hyped up on Yelp, but, personally, it tasted kinda bland. The sauce was zesty and made the dish but the fries were kind of a  thicker, mushier version of french fries? 4. Pappardelle pasta: The flavors of the braised short rib was unexpected but quite interesting-everyone was a fan of this dish! 6. Eggplant Parmigiana: Let's be real, this dish is all about the cheese. I think there's eggplant somewhere underneath, but that glorious cheese just won't give it a chance to shine. 7. Burrata and beets: I don't get why this dish is all the rage lately, but no matter where I order this, I just can't get on board. But the favorite of the night was the dessert. We secretly asked our waiter for a birthday surprise at the end of the night and what a surprise we got! What arrived was some creampuffs and a banana in a -ahem- phallic arrangement (oh yes, I posted a picture). The birthday girl thought it was hilarious and even better, it was delicious!

2015-01-19,3.0,"I've been to Quartino a few times over the years and every time I get super excited to go but then leave a little disappointed.  The good: - The restaurant is lively, loud, and fun and good for large groups. Love the old Italian style and the silly movies they play on the TVs  - The concept of Italian tapas is great  - Wine selection is pretty extensive with a wide variety of reds and whites in different price ranges and quantities  The could-be-better: - Overpriced for quantity and quality of food - Service has always been strictly okay. Given the large size of the establishment, I'm sure the servers are running around all over the place. But it's honestly extremely difficult to catch any of them when you need something.  - The pizzas are good but not the best or most authentic I've had.  - White bean and garlic spread - somewhat blah. Not enough garlic, which is a tragedy. - Veal meatballs - these were good, as long as you don't mind meat paired with sweet things (golden raisins).  - Ravioli Filled with Braised Pork, Speck, & Fava Beans - this was delicious, but rather pricey for the quantity of ravioli you get - Linguine with Clams: again, good but not mind blowing - Eggplant Parmigiana: really tasty, but (you guessed it) not the best I've had Overall, Quartino's is a fun place to go with a group to share bits of everything.

2015-01-18,1.0,"Absolutely garbage.  I write this from the bar at Quartino on a Sunday. I'm so outraged by the experience that I'd prefer to sit here and write the review over actually eating my food. We ordered a couple of beers. The food came out quickly. We started with the sundried tomato soup ($3.75) which came in a very small dish but tasted tolerable. I ordered the porcini mushroom risotto ($14.75) and BF ordered the gnocchi ($10.75). The risotto came out first--a nasty mess of mushy gray slop which I finished out of extreme hunger alone--that's not much to boast of, however, because all in all, there were about nine spoonfuls--I'll liken eating them to going through each of Dante's circles of hell. Next came the gnocchi--a true nightmare of incompatible tastes. A tiny platter with gnocchi absolutely drowning in oil, pesto, and (apparently) arugula and potato, this dish tasted off immediately and also smelled foul. The bartender came by and asked if everything was alright. I explained that the gnocchi tasted awful--and tried to articulate exactly what was ""off"" about it, but I was so overwhelmed by the competing options that I just gave up and left it at ""honestly, it tastes bad."" In response, he told us to ""keep eating because there is some good garlicky stuff in there""...I mean, I don't even know where to go with that. We picked at it some more out of sheer politeness, and we really shouldn't have but my boyfriend, bless his little heart, is too damn nice. I couldn't go through with it. He came by again and asked if we wanted to get something else. After tasting those two dishes, though, I wasn't sure we could survive another go around. We politely declined and asked for the check.  When he dropped it off, he told us that he'd taken the gnocchi off of the tab. Right move, but too little, too late. When someone complains about the food, you don't give them a hard time and tell them to keep eating; you apologize and offer them something else. At that point, we were visibly upset and still hungry (we ate maybe 50% of the food that came out). We paid, tipped for the bad service (out of principle alone) and left.  And as a final note: there's a bit of humor to every bad situation because the whole time in my head, while this was playing out, I kept imagining Gordon Ramsey just absolutely freaking out.  Gordon, on the off chance you're reading this, you may want to give this place a shot.",-0.9683,0.835,0.067,0.099,0.5707991622574956

The food was tasty and well done. I do not recall exactly what dish I had, but I do recall an excellent pasta sauce. Nothing to special in the other ingredients. To me the restaurant theme is a little confused- in places trying to be classy and in others more family style, such as the waiters wearing the colours of various Italian soccer teams, which sadly did not flatter the girth of our waiter. I certainly have to give praise for the service. Owing to the small size of the table my date left a small bag with a gift in on the floor, rather than the cramped table, which we both forgot when leaving.

FALSE. A liter of wine between two people is more than you need for lunch. Whoops!  But overall my experiences are Quartino have been satisfactory.  I've had the odd 'meh' dish, but by and large the food is good and the service is decent.

It is inexpensive.  The best tasting dishes I've had during my 3 or so visits here were the burrata and the chocolate cake.  The servers are either absent or impatient, or both, and will start setting the table for the next group while you're still finishing your meal.  If you have 15-20 people, give it a chance perhaps, but if you're craving good Italian food, there has to be better!",0.9164,0.862,0.114,0.024,0.3823809523809524

The atmosphere is lively (maybe a little loud but totally ok!), very eclectic fun crowd, the building itself is gorgeous and historic looking, and it was bustling with energy on a Saturday night.  The food.. Well, its great! We started with the meat, cheese, pickled veggie, and olive board. We let our server pick the choices, and he did a great job! We really liked everything. We ordered up the rest of our choices: brussel sprouts, beef filet, calamari, cauliflower, caprese salad, shrimp, and linguini with clams. Everything was so so good, I even ordered more brussels so I could have my own. I really wanted to try the pizzas (the table next to us had one, and it looked great!) but my friends weren't on board since it was thin crust. Next time!

2014-12-29,4.0,"Quartino is my go-to place to bring friends from out of town. Delicious, reasonably priced food in a fun setting in a good location. I love tapas and this Italian spin is a great variation. My two favorite dishes: 1) Calamari. The calamari is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside served with a delicious marinara. You can tell that it's hand-breaded and the pieces of calamari are cut larger than normal which I think is great for texture. 2) Braised short rib with salsa verde. This is the ultimate comfort food - tender, succulent beef swimming in a rich hearty sauce. The salsa verde (mixture of chopped Italian herbs) is the perfect complement to cut the richness of this dish. Other things to try that are pretty good: Broccolini, donuts with chocolate and caramel, pappardelle with ragu, sangria. Things that are good but not great: Shrimp with lemon, pizza.

2014-12-28,2.0,"We needed a place to host a pre-wedding family dinner that was central to where our out-of-town family was staying and which served a cuisine that everyone could enjoy. That pretty much limited us to Italian food and since my wife had been to Quartino with friends before, we made our reservation. The good: They were accommodating regarding a serious nut allergy concern we had with one of our guests. That's always a good thing to find. Also, the food there is excellent and the prices are reasonable, a rare combination in that touristy part of town. The bad: First, there is apparently no quiet (or at least calm) space anywhere in the restaurant. We could barely hear each other talking, which wasn't great for a first meeting between families. We should have researched this better, for sure, but even if we were just there ourselves or with a couple friends, it would have been near impossible to have any kind of conversation. I understand having a party atmosphere in a restaurant, but I'd hope for something a little less roaring than a suburban-strip-mall-wings-and-sports-TV-joint level of noise. Second, the tables were a bit small and more than a bit crowded together. I had to get up several times during our meal so that wait staff and other customers could get to the tables next to us. There was barely room on our table for the dishes and I felt like I was sitting (when I got to sit) with my face in the elevated pans most of the night.  I'm not certain that I will frequent Quartino too often again, if at all, unless I could order take-out. If I wanted to eat somewhere that loud and cramped where I had to stand every time someone needed the restroom, I'd get lunch on a United flight, since at least afterward I'd be somewhere else. I don't need that experience in a restaurant of Quartino's caliber. This is a shame, because the food there is indeed quite good. However, there's no dearth of good food in Chicago, and so the dining experience counts.",0.9653,0.823,0.116,0.061,0.48056523422377095

Their portions are good for sharing, but also perfect as single meals as well (assuming you're not a fan of wasteful gargantuan portions like I am).

It was noisy, but the tables are so small that it is pretty easy to hear your companions. I really liked the atmosphere - bustling, but cozy.  The service was fantastic. Friendly and fast.  The food tasted fresh and was flavorful. I'm loving this tapas trend, and this place pulls it off well. Everything is designed to share, and it comes to your table as soon as it's ready, so I felt like we were munching on something the whole time. The house-made goat milk ricotta was deliciously creamy and came with perfectly toasted bread. The manzo pizza had such a tasty, unique flavor! I highly recommend this one. We also got the ravioli, but I wasn't very impressed. The pasta itself tasted very fresh, but I wasn't a fan of the flavor.  We didn't have any mixed drinks, but we shared a half bottle of wine (for two people) which was inexpensive and tasty.

Note: It's a fun place to go with a group (although ordering/sharing is tricky the more people you have), and they take big reservations, but they won't seat you until your entire party is there.  I was once with 11 people, and they wouldn't seat our party of 14 until the three stragglers arrived.  C'mon, folks.  You are missing out on early food and booze orders from ELEVEN PEOPLE.  But c'est la vie.",0.9901,0.79,0.179,0.031,0.46098484848484844

That would have been nice if the girl at the bar wasn't hitting me in the head with her butt every so often. And if the table were a bit larger. The table comes with a stack of plates on it already. We had to have it taken away and just eat out of the dishes our food came in. Which was fine with us, but thank goodness the plates come out when they are ready, rather than all together. There is no way we could have fit more than 1 1/2 plates on there... plus there is the bottle of wine, glasses, candle, breadbasket, etc. to consider. A look around made me think the other tables (because granted ours was probably a bar table) were having the same issue.  This is a more casual restaurant with a couple of bars and great atmosphere. My only gripe was that it got WAY  too loud in there. We were barely 2 feet apart from each other and could hardly hear anyone. Also, heads up, they have restroom attendants.

I come here pretty regularly because my future mother in law loves Italian and lives downtown, so it's really convenient, and they take reservations. (This is really important- Quartino is always crowded, even at 3:00 PM on a Monday, so you need reservations or you will be in for a long wait). This place is designed for sharing, but we have pretty divergent tastes, so we aren't typically able to. The MIL enjoys the house made pastas, the fiance invariably orders some type of pizza, and I prefer one of the meet entrees paired with a salad or some roasted veggies. I do think think this would be more fun to come with someone who has similar tastes- some of the antipasti look really delicious!

If you have a bigger appetite, you will need more plates because the portions are relatively small. I would definitely recommend the beef short ribs, not messy at all since the meat sits loosely on the bone, and it's very tender. Their cauliflower was different than how they are usually served. Basically one giant cauliflower with a green sauce and slightly broiled. The brussel sprouts are standard, as I liked them. Now the duck prosciutto took me by surprise, it was good, but it was tiny. There were 6 small pieces along with some vegetables, wouldn't get it for the price of the plate. The shrimp wasn't too special either, tasted more fishy than I had expected.  The ambience was warm and the crowd wasn't too loud. There is plenty of space but the tables are a little close together, which made getting out a bit difficult. but overall, I would recommend it.",0.6271,0.883,0.083,0.033,0.46038069073783355

Compared to Bar Ombra in Andersonville, I'd say both price and quality of cicchetti and pizza are similar, but Bar Ombra has a more rustic ambience and is closer to the N. Shore suburbs. Still, if you're in Chicago and crave delicious cicchetti, definitely stop by!

It is perfect for sharing and trying. I have been here a bunch of times with a bigger group and with just another person. It's definitely different experiences between the two and I had much more fun coming here with a bigger group. You can order a crapload of various plates and shared a liter of drink, or two. It ended up to be not so much at the end. When I came here with just another person, you tend to over order and the check gets to be more pricy. I was here last Saturday with family and there were six of us. We had so much fun sharing the salumi platter, the manzo pizza, a couple of pasta dishes, the calamari, etc. The calamari was to die for! Big ass and fat round of squids fried to sheer perfection in my eyes. It was one of the best ever calamaris I have ever had! The pappardelle pasta with the braised short ribs ragout was also my fave! The pizza looked like a neapolitan brick oven style, but the crust was nice and intact. There wasn't any wet part. It was pretty damn yummy.  The drinks.. Mh.. I came here for the Bellini. I am not a huge drinker but I'd let my face get warmed and red for their Bellini. While waiting for my party to come, I patiently waited with a half liter of Bellini. They came and finished my half liter. Good thing, we ordered some more. For desserts, we ordered the Zeppole served with honey and dark chocolate sauce that was worthy of a Soprano episode. The service was fast and it's cool that way as you weren't afraid to order just enough as you could always order more and it wouldn't take forever. Our server was pleasant and accommodating and she was on it like white on rice about refilling our bread.  I gave four stars because I'm a fan. I didn't give five stars because some of the foods I had better elsewhere. It didn't mean it's bad, but it didn't mean five stars either. Plus, I think $40 for a liter of Bellini was very pricy.

Quite impressive due to him having to be the service bartender as well. I ventured into Quartino on a Saturday afternoon after my business trip wrapped up. I'm a transitioning vegetarian and my god it was so hard for me to find a place that sort of catered to vegetarians in Chicago! Conference food almost always sucks so I had a ravenous appetite from being stuck in Chicago for six days with hardly anything I could eat.  Most places on Saturday apparently serve brunch until around 2pm. I was at sable before I came to Quartino because of the lack of options. Anyway I sat at the bar and decided on my New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. Shortly thereafter, I realized the items on the menu were too cheap to be legit and I asked the bartender, ""Is this tapas?!"" Perhaps he could see my displeased grimace and said they are generally half portions. I was hungry and saw a few things I wanted to try so this response sufficed.  I ordered the penne alla vodka and the garlic shrimp dish. The bartender served me my wine in a rocks glass from a carafe. I was confused for a moment because I've never drank wine out of a rocks glass.  I took a look around and saw that many people were drinking their wine this way and figured this MUST be the way to do it. I was given olive oil, cheese I had to shred myself and a plate of bread. I loved every moment of this seemingly traditional Italian establishment!  My appetite still not curbed, I pondered ordering another round of the pasta and shrimp and opted for the calamari. I made a good decision. It was delicious! I also ordered more wine. I don't think I've ever eaten so much in my life. I thought for sure I'd spent around $60 in this place. I was astonished to get the check and see only a $39 tab. #winning!

The gnocchi was awesome but extreamly hot. So beware before you bite into it. I thought the penne alla vodka was pretty mediocre and nothing to write home about.

No tables available last minute, but managed to snag a spot at the bar. It's cozy, lively, service is super friendly, and best of all, the food (and wine) is amazing. Everything was so fresh, delicious and authentic, and SO reasonably priced, especially considering the high quality. It's a great place to come w/ a group, so you can order a bunch of plates and sample them all. But it's also a great place to come on your own, because you can order half-portions of almost anything on the menu, and they have a great selection of wine by the glass - actually, you can get it by the 1/4 liter (about 1-1/2 glass), 1/2 liter, bottle or full liter.   Tried 1/2 portion of 3 items, and they were all excellent:  1. Arugula salad, w/ orange, house-made ricotta and olive oil - light and lovely. ($3.75) 2. Rigatoni w/ Tuscan kale, roasted butternut squash, house-made pancetta & ricotta -  so unique ($5.50); and  3. Bordetto ai frutti di mare - w/ shrimp, clams, calamari, octopus and whitefish, all in an incredible marzano tomato sauce ($7.75) Wine is well-priced, too; for 1/4 liter, you can get a Toscana for just $7, or I got the Montepulciano D'Abruzzo for $14, and it was amazing. But, everything that the folks sitting on either side of me ordered looked fantastic, too - pancetta-wrapped dates, crusted cauliflower, veal meatballs, beef short rib and potato purée, tortellini, gnocchi and ravioli (have to try the ravioli and meatball next time).

It was after midnight, I'm vegan, and the hotel I stayed at had nothing vegan on the room service menu (well, they had French Fries, but that was it). Thanks to the wonder that is Yelp, my husband and I discovered that nearby Quartino's was open until 2 AM and had a few vegan items on the menu. The person managing the restaurant that night was very kind and let me place a pick up order even though that wasn't their policy at that hour. We picked it up and had the following: Artichokes Capobasso -- this was a tiny portion of cold, vinegary artichokes. For $5 I would not get it again. Marinara Pizza -- Not bad, and pretty sizable so a good value at $8, if you don't mind a cheeseless pizza. Since we're vegan, we didn't mind at all. Scarola e Fagiol (Braised Escarole with Cannellini Beans)  -- taste wise this was just okay, but I wanted veggies, and the portion was sizable -- at $4.25 a much better value than the artichokes. In fact there was so much of it that we only ate about half. There may be better items on the Quartino's menu for all I know.

After failing to dine at several other restaurants because of their ridiculous wait times we came to Quartinos, with over 2,000 reviews I expected to have a decent dining experience upon walking in.  First off, we were a group of 4 and I kid you not we had to be seated 3 different times. The first 2 times they placed us in the most absurd areas, the places where no one wants to sit, by the corner near the kitchen where employees are constantly carrying plates walking around saying excuse me. The third time was a charm and we were finally able to eat.  Now onto their drinks, the cocktails we ordered by the bar were good, a little pricey but what do you expect nowadays. Once we were seated we ordered a pitcher of sangria for the table. Not impressed.....I think we were spoiled by the sangria at cafe ba-ba-reeba which comes with actual fruit pieces in the pitcher and comes super chilled with ice. Here they passed around cups with ice and shriveled up, unappetizing looking pieces of fruit in it. Sangria was very warm and the pitcher almost looked kind of old and dirty.  Finally, the food. We ordered a couple of things. Calamari- their calamari was good but how do you really screw that up? Shrimp- pretty good but nothing amazing Fetuccine alfredo- again your typical fettuccine alfredo pasta that I could probably make at home  Soprano pizza- eh we ordered this one because my boyfriend wanted something with meat on it but I think it almost would have been better without the sausages Gnocchi- DO NOT I repeat do not order this. It was SO bland it was almost like I was just chewing on plain dough with absolutely no flavor. I kept telling myself it tasted better with Tabasco but everyone at the table said it was just because now I was tasting the Tabasco  My favorite was probably the Nutella sandwich we ordered for dessert. I don't know if we were having an off night at Quartinos or ordered all the wrong things but as of right now I've tried so many better places in Chicago I will not be making my way back here.",0.9731,0.838,0.107,0.055,0.5449891774891773

2014-09-17,1.0,"Meh... That about sums up my lackluster dining experience at Quartino.  Aside from the Chilled Zucchini small plate (which was delicious!), I was lamentably quite unimpressed by every other dish we ordered. FOOD (+ comment above): Very unauthentic Italian food.  For example, at the end of dinner we ordered assorted Bread Biscotti's to-go and tried them while waiting for the check.--They were really soft, like one of those Keebler 'soft batch choc. chip cookies'-soft.  Bread Biscotti's are supposed to be hard and crunchy, which is what makes them a popular after-dinner treat to dunk in your café.  Needless to say, the ""to-go"" box of Biscotti's my boyfriend & I ordered did not go home with us, it became a ""to-be-left-at-the-table"" box. The pasta here ALMOST nostalgically brought me back to weekly Sunday family dinners, eating the handmade gnocchi & ravioli I used to make with my grandma... Almosttt... But not really. Or even at all, for that matter.  ALTHOUGH, it did make me really miss Grandma's homemade sauce. P.S. WINE:  Wine is served in the same dinky,  ribbed plastic cups that you last drank out of as a kid in your sleepaway summer camp's dining hall...  We just ordered a bottle of Chianti & this is seriously what you're giving me to drink it from??  I totally get that they're going for the laid-back, famiglia atmosphere; however, there's gotta be a better compromise for a casual way of serving red wine, while still rendering the highest quality product... because the short, narrow mess-hall cups ain't cuttin' it in the Aerating category.  Not to mention--What does this say about Quartino's perception of its own wine menu?!?  Unfortunately, before even taking the first sip, I already had a subconscious bias opinion of the wine, which was: ""cheap.""  Esp. b/c I've been served boxed wine at football games in cups more conducive for serving wine. Over $150 (for 2) later... In short: Way too Americanized Italian restaurant.  Epitome of what you picture a ""tourist trap"" to be.  Shocked by all the + reviews on here by Chi locals, no offense! So, so sorry Quartino for the very critical write-up--you're my 1st, & only, negative Yelp review :(  But I felt the need to write this bluntly honest review to set the record straight for all you out there who, like me, are being severely misled by all these deceptive 5-star reviews!!",-0.9104,0.848,0.059,0.094,0.5030487804878049

Super loud and the street seating is always jammed (which I don't mind because I prefer to eat inside). Service was crummy, portions are super tiny. For the $26 bucks I spent, I could have eaten at Chili's across the street and had better food/service - TWICE. The balsamic vinegar they have at the table is probably the best I've ever tasted and it seems that the fruit flies are aware of this fact. I went through 3 plates as I sat there because the little a-holes kept flying into my vinegar! That old saying... yea, complete BS. Minestrone soup was bland. Salt grinder took care of that but my pepper grinder was empty. With how attentive my waiter was (he seemed to not really care much about serving and kinda looked like he was pissed off the whole time I was there), I think I would have received a new grinder sometime today instead of last night while I was there. I was really craving risotto so I got the sausage risotto... bland and crummy, kinda runny with this weird skin on top of it when i first mixed it around, served on something about the size of an appetizer plate for a toddler. Upon further investigation, I found that this place is considered a ""small plate"" restaurant and it certainly lives up to that. Didn't even bother with dessert - paid, left, went to 711 for some snacks afterwards...

It was a beautiful night so we opted to wait the 20 minutes for a table outside rather than being sat immediately inside. So we went to the bar for a quick cocktail while we were waiting on our table to be ready. I have to say that the limoncello martini is definitely worth a try, but be warned it has a little heat behind it! Now after we got sat at our table, our waiter came immediately and was very helpful when we asked him about some of the customer favorites as well as his personal favorite dishes. We ended up ordering the veal meatballs, olives, pappardelle, and veal osso buco. I think my favorite dish of the night had to be the veal meatballs. They were so tender and flavorful and the tomato sauce was very flavorful! The pappardelle was pretty good (and a little secret the meat in this pappardelle is the same meat as the beef short ribs entree so if you want to try a different meat dish and still try the spare ribs this is a good option). The flavor was ok, but it was in need of a little salt to add some more depth. The veal osso buco was also very good, but it had a starkly different flavor from the rest of our dishes so it was a little off-putting at first. However, as I continued to eat the dish, the flavors of the veal took over and I ended up really liking the dish.

Fortunately, the regular bread that's served with oil and vinegar upon being seated was still there, so I used that bread instead.  EGGPLANT PARMESAN was disappointing. Wayyyyy too much cheese melted on top of very thick slices of eggplant. It might be fine for many people, but I found it to be clunky Husband also ordered the first SHRIMP dish with white wine sauce.

He went with the cavatelli with ricotta and enjoyed every bite!  We also had the salmon, minestrone soup, assorted olives, romaine hearts salad and each were excellent. Red Sangria was fairly priced and a perfect pairing.  Dark chocolate fondue with strawberries, a side of delicious vanilla ice cream and espresso to close out the meal.  Pizza's seemed to be quite popular with other dinners.  Very welcoming atmosphere and extensive outdoor dining.

2014-08-10,5.0,"This place far exceeded our expectations. We enjoyed the ample outdoor seating. The wine list has a nice variety of good Italian wines. They are served in four sizes, ideal for sharing: 250ml, 500ml, 750ml (bottle), and 1000ml. The menu lists this as 1/4, 1/2, and 1 liter, and the bottle. There is no discount for the bottle, so just order what you want. They bring a carafe and small glasses. The 1/2 liter we ordered poured about 6 of those small glasses. Next time I will only order 1/4 liters--you can always repeat the same kind, but it would be fun to explore the list. Oh, they also have food!  The chef here really knows how to cook meat. The dishes are small and meant for sharing (why this place is listed in the tapas category). We tried the short rib and the veal oso bucco. Both were tender and savory. The carpaccio carpets the plate (we were actually wondering where the meat was until we realized that it WAS the pink--the plate was blanketed). The risotto was adequate. The server provided a gluten free menu. It even included one past dish (nice!). The outdoor area became quite loud, the street noise is always there, and then the tightly packed tables all raised their voices. Pretty soon we were all almost shouting.

2014-07-31,4.0,"I've been to Quartino about 5 times now. Each encounter the food has been fresh (hoooot!) out the kitchen and tasty.  Ran into Mila Kunis there... literally... ran, into, her! We were leaving, it was crowded and she bumped right into my chest (I mean, my heart), her hair was covering her face (I assume to not draw attention to her) but when she looked up, we locked eyes, we locked hearts, I fell in love and she just smiled and apologized then went on her way as our crew went star crazed. Her and her friends soon left as it drew quite a crowd around their table, as everyone was trying to get a picture. I love you Mila! Anyhow, I wouldn't recommend going with a large group unless they seat you at a the non-circular tables. I say that bc once we went w/ a party of 10 and they tried to squeeze us all into a circular table in the corner (keep in mind, there were maybe 2-4 tables seated in the ENTIRE restaurant); the chairs wouldn't even fit around the table, not to mention 10 grown adults at a small plates restaurant with waters and wine on the table. We told them to change it and they did. Only once did I go w/ a group and it was pleasant (not feeling crowded) - we were sat at tables pulled together, not the circular ones. All other times, I felt over-crowded and it was like playing table Jenga (i'm only about 150 lbs too).  Aside from seating, the ambiance is upbeat, it's louder than most and a fun environment. Food is always tasty - I love the small plates, so I can try a variety of the menu items and they come out as they're cooked, so they're always fresh and piping hot.

2014-07-31,2.0,"I was really disappointed with this place. However I do want to give it a second chance because I think we just got unlucky. Mostly this review is to warn people to avoid our situation. I went there with a group of friends (6 people) and we were seated by the really friendly and attractive hostess. Unfortunately that's when the excitement ended. We sat outside--don't. There is nothing quite like the ambiance of trucks and motorcycles gunning it at the stoplight.  Next we were informed that each plate was a little smaller than usual but that was because it was a tapas place and we were supposed to order a lot and share. We ignored that warning and each ordered a plate which all came out at separate times (awkward for our group). But even that is understandable and probably our fault. The food was incredible albeit small. The real problem I have with the place is our douchebag of a waiter. It was like he was hungover from the massive frat party the night before because he just didn't care about anything. He came up to our table seconds after we sat down, asked what we wanted, and walked away when we hesitated. He then disappeared for at least ten minutes while other, nicer, workers brought us water and bread to start with. When we ordered, I was last and still choosing between a few things. He didn't give me the chance to think any more and asked what my problem was. I asked which I should choose and he told me quickly the name of one, not a description, not a summary, the name. The dish was delicious but not anything like what I wanted.  If it matters our waiter was wearing an inter Milan shirt and was a bigger guy with blonde hair. Oh one cool thing, I did notice the manager come offer free dessert drinks and comped food because the table next to us wasn't satisfied with their food so at least they have good management. Maybe I'll go back when I have money to buy a few bottles of wine and can sit for a few hours with those. tl;dr sit inside, avoid internazionale.",-0.869,0.772,0.102,0.126,0.45658730158730165

The caprese salad was fresh and a delicious start. Then, the seafood soup, Brodetto Ai Frutta Di Mare, was actually quite tasty. One of the tastiest I've ever had. The broth had more body and there was a lot of content in the soup.  I have to keep this separate to forewarn you. Whatever you do, do not order the gnocchi.

My only real complaint about Quartino is how they seat you. Every available inch of space is consumed. Going to the ladies room was a task of weaving through tight tables. Because they seat so many people so close together, it can get pretty loud too. If you want to have a quiet conversation, this isn't the place.

Also had the veal meatballs and the ravioli. I loved both except the ravioli was a bit salty. My pomegranate martini was great and the babe ordered red wine which came with a funny regular cup just like in Italy. I think it's good for a breezy date night.

2014-07-09,4.0,"Small plate Italian food??  What an amazing idea.  I always leave Italian restaurants feeling uncomfortably stuffed.  Quartino not only allows you to select different small plates to share with your group but also doesn't require you to eat a massive bowl of pasta meeting your suggested carb intake for the entire month... (don't get me wrong, there is definitely a time and a place for a huge bowl of pasta).  Since it is small plates and you don't have to commit to one entree for the entire meal, I have tried (and LOVED) many things that I would have never ordered a huge portion of.  So, the experience and setup for the restaurant is definitely a plus in my book. The food is also very tasty here and it is a great place to go if you are a vegetarian or pescatarian.  As a pescatarian, I have had no problem finding plenty to eat here.  Since I've been several times I'll list a few of my favorites that I HAVE to order each time I go: Wild arugula salad- awesome flavors and a great fresh start to a meal Eggplant Parmigiana- comes out piping hot, oozing cheese and in the pan they broiled it in... Steamed clams- you get a ton of clams in this delicious broth Zeppole with dark chocolate- my favorite desert at this restaurant, so good! Now my meat eater husband and friends would say that you have to try the dates wrapped in pancetta. So if meat's your thing, you know their favorite.  I personally don't think you can make a bad choice with food here.  I have tried so many different things and have been please with each choice.  As far as beverages go, you can buy wine by the liter (just like in Italy) for a very reasonable price and their cheaper bottles are decent wine. Keep in mind, as other reviewers have mentioned, this place is loud.  If noise of happy eaters doesn't bother you, then you're in for a treat!",0.9974,0.734,0.224,0.042,0.6346124031007754
2014-07-09,3.0,"Good service, an excellent wine selection and several delicious food pairings made for an enjoyable family meal overall. The bread, pizza and spicy sausage were very tasty but other items were a little underwhelming. My wife didn't like the tumblers used to serve wine--I think this is done in the spirit of an Italian farmhouse and I didn't mind so much but something to consider if this sort of thing is important to you. The upstairs dining area was closed when we went which is a shame because it offers a more pleasant view and would probably be less noisy than the boisterous street-level dining areas.",0.8081,0.779,0.15,0.071,0.42401960784313725

The atmosphere is very lively and fun so coming with a larger group and being as gregarious as you like works perfectly at Quartino.  I came in last night with six family members and we ordered a ton. I'll do my typical tapas like review... Salumeria Tasting: We tried out a bunch of different things. Everything was pretty good but they really skimp on the meat and cheese servings of this dish. Not sure if this is worth the value with that considered.  D'Anitra & Sausage Pizze: This was really good. I was skeptical of the duck prosciutto but it was delicious and a great flavor combination as a whole. Not usually a fan of sausage pizza but this was very, very good. All in all I really enjoy how they cook their pizza. Pappardelle  & Tagliatelle: Both pastas were tasty but nothing special.  Polenta Fries: A bit much for me. Was not a fan.  White Bean & Garlic Spread: Not a fan of white beans so I probably would not order this one again.  Crisp Calamari: Deliciousness in fried form. They do this right!  Beef Short Rib: Five stars for this dish. I could've eaten the ENTIRE thing by myself.  While I was not in love with everything we ordered I was in love with my experience at Quartino. All of the food was good and the atmosphere was great. I'd highly recommend grabbing an Open Table reservation and hitting this place up for a night of fun and good food.",0.9966,0.688,0.263,0.048,0.5103317053317054
2014-07-08,4.0,"I don't usually go to a restaurant more than once because there are so many to try, but Quartino made me want to go again and again. I love the ambiance, the space, the food, and the prices.  The ambiance is dimly lit with lots of seating and multiple floors.  There are 2 floors and the place is usually filled with people so the atmosphere is loud, but in a good way if you know what I mean.  It's not too loud and definitely has that Italian noise vibe.   Moving on to the food.  The 2 most memorable dishes for me that I got both times I was there are: 1) Porcini & Truffle risotto - contains prociini mushrooms and white truffles.  I can never resist truffles and absolutely love mushrooms.  The two together are heavenly!  How do I even start with this dish!  This is so delicious and just melts in your mouth.  The aromas you smell when this comes out will just take your breath away.  This stood out to me among all the appetizers and entrees my friends and I ordered.  This dish also made me a life-long risotto fan.  It's not too heavy or cheesy, but perfect. 2) Gran Coppa Quartino - one of the best dessert dishes I've ever had.  3 Gelati with roasted hazelnuts and biscotti.  It's beautiful and ""mouth-wateringly"" delicious.  I still can't forget it after more than 1 year of not being in Chicago.  All the desserts are good, but this one looked the best to me.  It's not too creamy, not too big, beautiful presentation in a clear class cup and colors to all make me have a foodgasm as soon as I see it!   These 2 dishes come out to be about $30 and it was enough to fill my friend and I both when we split it.  The prices I feel are very reasonable for the quality.  The food is fresh when you go in during dinner hours.  You can get a variety of tapas dishes and share, which means you get to try everything!  The closing time of 1 am make this ideal for late night bite, but also definitely when you're really hungry.  Keep in mind you will need to wait about 30-45 minutes if you go in during peak times so I suggest trying to get there early or get a reservation (you can do this on opentable).  This is one of 2 restaurants in Chicago that I will always return to.",0.9988,0.778,0.222,0.0,0.5737061403508773

2014-07-06,4.0,"My spouse and I dined with Quartino's for the first time last night and we ABSOLUTELY loved it. I personally liked that they had a variety of price ranges to fit everybody's budget. It's rare to see a place that is accommodating to those with low budgets or high and is delicious regardless. We were given water and fresh soft bread upon sitting down and reviewing the cocktail, beer, and wine list. There were so many options!  I ordered the house red wine where it was served in a very generous portion and my spouse had a Peroni beer which was excellent. My wine was $5 for 1/4 liter of the bottle. Peroni was $6 and generally is in a large beer bottle.  We decided to order and share the Pasta alla vodka which was served PIPING hot and was excellent. Our only complaint is that we should've gotten our own plates because it was not enough to share as a dinner portion for two(but would be great as a sharing appetizer). It was too good, we scraped the sauce left on the plate up with the bread. So next time I am ordering that for myself. Then we ordered a sausage pizza. We didn't wait long at all and it also was served PIPIN hot and was delicious. We only ate half of it and our server happily boxed the rest up for us to take home.  When we received our bill we were shocked. For two entrees and drinks (that we were beyond happy with) only came to be $34.01. Did I mention how difficult it is to find a place that serves great food until 1AM and we got there at 12:30AM? Plus they are open until 2. That's awesome. Plus, for two people drinking and ordering entrees in downtown Chicago on a Saturday night with great service and excellent food... Can't get better than Quartino's.

We didn't realize that's what it would consist of, otherwise I don't think we would've opted for this. Also, the melted cheese was a tad grainy. 2) Porcini and truffle risotto - flavors were good but it's missing something to give it a kick, a bit of meet or seafood would've been nice 3) Veal milanese - pretty much two veal cutlets, breaded and fried on a bed of arugula. It seemed like it could've been hotter/fresher, and had already cooled down a bit by the time the dish arrived at our table. 4) Panino al Gelato Limone - lemon gelato sandwich, this was the best part of the meal!

2014-06-29,2.0,"I can't believe this place has 2000+ reviews and it's definitely nowhere near the top restaurants of Chicago. But when you consider how this menu here is extensive enough to cater to everyone person's fancy (vegetarian, ""meatarian"", pescatarian) and the location is easy enough for tourists to locate, then I guess it makes sense why this place is ""popular"". The food is not mind blowing or phenomenally good. It does not give you a wow factor but it's decent enough. Beef carpaccio: Absolutely bland and tasteless. We've had a lot of carpaccio elsewhere and the slices of rare meat should at least have natural flavor. The slices were also all stuck together as we tried to lift some of the plate. White bean spread: Also absolutely bland. I never salt my food at restaurants but just to experiment if the spread would taste better, I sprinkled some salt and pepper over it. It was a tad bit better. Pappardelle with short rib sauce: Fresh pasta should always have the delicate chewy texture compared to the typical texture of dried pasta like spaghetti and linguine. The pappardelle definitely did not have that chewy texture and tasted more like dried pasta. While the short rib sauce was tasty, but it tasted shallow rather than having depth. Veal osso buco: The meat was extremely tender which is the only positive thing about the dish. The veal itself did not taste like it absorbed any of the sauce. Oddly, the veal had a ""sterile"" taste. It was as if they cooked the veal separately and then the sauce was poured over it. Profiteroles were pretty good but the tiramisu had too much cream.

Since the menu is based on sharable plates, this place is great if you have a larger group.  It also looked like there were several parties being hosted there, so it looks like they are pretty accommodating as well. We were just a party of 3, but we did manage to try a good amount of food!. Veal Meatball Slider - yum!  but, it literally is just ONE slider, note there is no ""S"", so order multiples so everyone can try it...or you'll only be getting a bite! Polenta Fries - pretty good and worth a try!  I would still prefer regular fries, but this is still a good choice!  Just keep in mind that it's kind of heavy, if you want to try other dishes. Wild Arugala Salad - pretty standard salad, but just what we needed to break up all the carbs and fried stuff Calamari - the best I've had!  Not heavy or greasy at all! Tortellini - I'm not a huge fan of cream sauces, but the prosciutto was a good pairing with this pasta Broccoli Rabe - again a nice break from the carbs and fried stuff Service was great and they were the perfect amount of attentiveness (not constantly interrupting, but also not MIA).   We also appreciated how extensive the wine menu was and that all the wines were categorized by Light, Medium and Full Bodied.  It made selecting a wine from their vast selection so much easier!",0.9961,0.745,0.222,0.033,0.5576739926739925

We were dining as a group and ordered some appetizers and main entrees. While we were told that all dishes are meant to be shared, everyone ended up ordering main entrée for themselves. In addition to my salmon I also ordered a side of potato puree. First strike came, when entrees started trickling in separately... My husband got his pasta, then some people in my party got their seafood orders and THEN I got my side of potatoes (2nd strike)... 10 minutes later came my salmon (3rd strike)... I'm not sure what serving school Quartino's employees went to, but by no rules is this acceptable! We were not sharing our dishes, therefore it is expected to have everyone's entree to be brought out at the same time! Lastly, to bring a side dish 10 minutes before the main dishes is just absolutely ridiculous!  In all fairness, they did try to make up for this blunder by giving us free dessert, but just a word of the wise - make sure you make it clear that you want your main dish brought out at the same time if you're not sharing!",0.8379,0.817,0.104,0.079,0.37195767195767193

As a girl that loves her cured meat and cheeses, the salumeria tasting is a steal where you can get 2 house made salumi, 2 formaggi, 3 spuntini, and olives for only $25! Pinch me, I'm dreaming and went to salumi heaven! The tortellini was so creamy and melt-in-your-mouth and the plate came lined with prosciutto on it, so I was sold. The waiter even told us to order 2 plates when he saw that we were dining family-style and it was probably one of the best choices we made that night. Their sangria is also delicious and cheap too!

Start with the goat cheese and bread and then make sure to try pastas, pizza and then risotto (of course this was the one item which seemed to get lost while getting to the table) followed by shrimp and veal osso buco done to perfection. Beef it great too.  Of course our table shared everything and every dish came back empty.  Pizza with ricotta and basil worked well. In hindsight skip the salad because one needs to save room for other dishes not available outside of Chicago. Make sure you also go for the wine.

2014-05-18,1.0,"Awful service and mediocre food. The pasta we ordered came out pretty quickly which was great,  however,  the noodles were undercooked. The noodles were also a little dry so we asked for a side of additonal sauce. The sauce arrived about 15 minutes later and by then the noodles were cold. The sauce tasted like tomato basil soup (not what we ordered). Oh, I almost forgot to mention the chicken in the pasta. The chicken was dry, unseasoned,  and still had the fat on it. Finally,  the set up of the resturaunt made the entire situation even more awkward. The tables are facing in every direction so there's no clear path for servers to walk through.  Instead,  they weaved in and out and around every table which caused us to constantly get bumped or fear that they were going to spill something on us.

We had a nice server and the pizzas, pastas and meatballs that we all ordered were excellent. Prices for food are very reasonable and drinks will run you your standard big city fare. Star was deducted because we had a reservation but had to wait in an overly crowded bar for 15 minutes, always in the way of someone passing by. Our table was for three and with a tapas place that has pizza on the menu, we didn't have nearly enough space. Felt a bit squished in but perhaps that's the style of the place.

Skipped the cocktails and went straight to the tapas. The veal meatballs were off the chain and we couldn't have been happier with our choice to indulge.  Only downsides were that our table was a bit shaky (problem was quickly resolved) and we had to ask twice for EVOO.

The bartenders are terrific- if you don't know Italian wine, don't be too shy to ask one of their knowledgable staff members, who will put it into pedestrian terms for you. I find the wine a good value; it isn't sold by the glass, but rather by the ""quartino"" and other increments of a liter.

Summary: This is definitely a must-stop for tourist's visiting Chicago to try some quality pizza (not necessarily deep dish since I didn't see any in the menu).  Nonetheless, the food here is really good, the place looks nice, and the service is good.

2014-05-06,4.0,"Not a bad place, but definitely don't come here if you want an intimate evening. I think this place deserves 3.5 stars, but the risotto was so good that I'll bump it up to 4 stars. I came here with two friends and we ordered three dishes and an appetizer, plus some wine. We got the gnocci, margherita pizza, truffle risotto, and polenta fries. The truffle risotto was by far the best dish we had. It was absolutely delicious! The only downside was that it was pretty small for three people (I'd recommend at the most for two people). The pizza was alright; nothing super spectacular, especially in a city that's known for its pizza. The gnocci was definitely my least favorite. It had a weird taste that I couldn't place. I believe on the menu it was listed as pesto/basil or something and it didn't taste like either of those things. The polenta fries were alright. I enjoyed them, but I wish they came with more sauce. The sizes of the dishes are pretty small, which kind of was a bummer, especially for how much you're paying, so keep that in mind when ordering to share. Our server was decent. He was nice, but when it came to picking a wine, he made me feel kind of uncomfortable. We wanted to try a couple wines because we weren't sure which one we wanted, and whenever we'd ask to try a new one, he'd respond ""Oh...you want ANOTHER one?"" I might just be overreacting, but it definitely made me feel like he didn't want us to keep trying wines. He also made me feel a little uncomfortable when we were asking about the portion sizes of the food. His suggestions almost made me feel like we were fat for ordering so much food. It was...interesting, but I think he was trying to be nice for the most part. A lot of his suggestions were also questionable. The restaurant itself is EXTREMELY ""cozy"", meaning you are literally inches away from the table next to you. I had a whole lotta butts rubbing against me trying to squeeze through the tables, which would more reasonable if the butts all belonged to other patrons, but most of the butts actually were servers.... Overall, it's a little pricy, but some of the dishes are worth it. I'm iffy on the servers, and the spacing between the tables. If I were to ever come back, I'd definitely order maybe one plate just for myself and another to share with a person, instead of trying to share all the plates.",0.9931,0.756,0.166,0.078,0.6233686868686868

We started with the salumeria which maybe I don't appreciate since I haven't developed that fine a palate yet, but the meats and cheeses were just fine. However, I did enjoy the raw artichoke hearts in EVOO with carrots and onion which is something I don't get everyday. Next came the potato gnocchi which was a fine dish. The gnocchi were tender, slightly chewy and the pesto sauce was fragrant. Little bit on the small side though. Had to have a meat dish so we ordered the beef short rib. Compared to other short ribs I've had before, this one just didn't have enough flavor. The sauce was light and the meat was pretty fatty. The star of the show was the calimari which was wonderful, crunchy, and came with a tasty dipping sauce. Fried stuff usually wins! The tortellini in alfredo was also decent. I feel like I could have made something similar to it in taste just by making a trip to the grocery store. Pizza with sausage was meh. The crust was good but the pizza was pretty wet so eating it was a bit difficult with the end just flopping all over the place. Dessert was good, I don't recommend ordering the donuts though since there's nothing crazy about a plain fried donut in chocolate dipping sauce. Someone at our table really wanted it though.

We had come from the Cubs game and being unsure of our plans we didn't have any reservations. They were full for reservations but we walked over to give it a try anyways and lucked out and found two seats right at the bar. Zakariah, their sommelier and bar manager, served us and was fabulous. I can be a little wine picky and he was really patient while I indulged a bit of high maintenance and tried four wines before making up my mind of what we decided to go with. Zakariah was wonderful and gave us two dishes that were sent to the bar by accident - a sausage pizza and a tortellini plate. Both were good so we felt comfortable asking him to order whatever he would recommend for us. He selected the burrata, a cured duck dish and delicious grilled octopus.

I came on a Sunday night around 9pm and it wasn't very crowded.  1) Veal Meatballs Napoli ($8.50) The veal meatballs were soooo soft!! Probably one of the best meatballs I've eaten. The meatballs were generously topped with raisins and tomatoes which complemented the lightly salted meatballs nicely. This dish was really worth it too - $8.50 for 4 large meatballs.  I chose this over the other two meatball dishes (a meatball slider and polpette al sumo di pomodoro which were meatballs dressed with a tomato based sauce) because I wanted something different and less traditional.  2) Asparagus Risotto ($11.75) I saw many Yelpers raving about this dish. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this dish very much. It just felt as though I was eating creamed asparagus or thick asparagus porridge.  3) Roasted Baby Octopus ($10.50) My favorite dish of the night. The octopus was tender and you can taste a slight char on the tentacles.  4) Steamed Clams ($11.75) This was pretty ordinary. Steamed clams with white wine and served with some toast. I enjoyed it nonetheless.  5) Zeppole ($5.50) A HUGE plate of doughnuts (7 or 8 pieces). Soooo good. It's served with both a honey and dark chocolate dip. Was too full by this point for two of us to finish all though.  A very hearty and satisfying dinner which I enjoyed thoroughly. Now, having tried the top 3 most reviewed tapas restaurants on Yelp, I would rank them in the order of the number of reviews each of them have ;) 1) GATG, 2) Purple Pig and 3) Quartino. It's definitely NOT that quartino is bad, it's just that I think the quality and standard of the food at GATG and purple pig are slightly better.

2014-03-04,3.0,"For the price point this place is just ok. Pros: Comfortable cozy place to hang out with friends, pretty convenient location. Cons: Food. Maybe we ordered the wrong stuff. The sausage tomato risotto made me sad. It was drenched in (nacho?) cheese/cream puddle. I understand the rice is supposed to have texture but this was way too hard in the middle and mushy on the corners, like cooking it on too high heat for too little time. Couldn't taste the meat over the sauce, although tomatoes were alright. Portion was small (like 2 cups) for the $12 we paid.  Giardiniera pizza - our bad for ordering pickled vegetables on pizza. Crust was good, other pizzas looked fine. Chocolate torte with ice cream: I'll like it even if it's just raw cake dough, but this one was a little overbaked. Kind of like realizing you left your cookies in the oven for too long - it's tasty, but ehh.

We had the rigatoni and tortellini pastas.  Both had the perfect amount of flavor. Also we love italian sodas (which not many italian rest. have,but they do!) In a variety of flavors. We tried Raspberry. It was the best I've had. Highly recommend coming here if you are in Chicago Downtown. Another plus is that we were surprised at how nice a restaurant and how delicious the food was AND how inexpensive it was. We are ok with paying high price for a nice meal but this was a great meal and less expensive that most italian restaurants.  Only negative is they apparently do not have spaghetti (which they offered to make on the spot) but is not on the menu, nor do they have lasagna. Which was a let down. That's actually why we came, we were craving spaghetti and my husband had been wanting lasagna. Which we thought they had because there are pictures here on yelp of lasagna and spaghetti. But I guess those are in the wrong yelp. Or maybe they served these dishes in the past and no longer do. Not totally sure. But I'm glad we stayed.

2014-02-24,5.0,"Okay, it's about time I review this place seeing as my boyfriend and I have been eating here for the past 4 years and have made it our go-to restaurant... Quartino is an experience. It's a big space, but somehow still cozy and intimate. It's loud, but still romantic. It is a great place for so many occasions. I have been here for girls nights, my 21st birthday dinner with family (this place is Italian-grandma friendly!), with my parents, and of course with my boyfriend. Each time is an exciting experience and EVERYONE I have taken here ends up loving it and going back. I will say, for my boyfriend and I, the noisy and cozy atmosphere is a perfect date, but I could see how some people looking for a quiet, ""fancy"" evening would not want to go here on a date. The tapas Italian idea is genius. I am from a huge Italian family so during family gatherings I know the terrible pain of wanting to try everything but having eyes bigger than your stomach and getting full too quickly - the horror!! At Quartino I get to try every dish (yes, I am the annoying person who also wants to try everyone's food and will reach my fork over without asking to take a bite!). I have had almost everything on the menu over the years and I would have to say the pork shank and the pappardelle are my favorite. I will say the pork shank is a bit salty, but I love salt so not a problem for me!! Napoli style pizza is my favorite and lucky for me, Quartino serves it! I like the sausage the best. I fully admit that I LOVE bantering with the waitstaff no matter where I am. I know some people hate this, but I personally love to talk and get to know some good tips from my waiter while making witty conversation. The waitstaff at Quartino is extremely knowledgeable about the menu and very, very friendly (as an Italian restaurant should be!!). When my boyfriend and I went to Quartino over Valentine's Day weekend we had the most wonderful waiter yet - Joe! He offered awesome, honest advice on our food questions and had some great tips about the alcoholic beverages as well. He was very good to us and I am going to request him next time we go! Thanks Joe! Last but not least, the prices here are extremely reasonable considering the location of the restaurant and quality of the food.

2014-02-17,4.0,"Went to Quartino on valentines day and enjoyed a good dinner and very good wine at a very reasonable price. Quartino serves small dishes, basically Italian tapas. A lot of places have moved towards small dishes and vastly overcharge, but Quartino doesn't really overcharge, I felt the prices were entirely reasonable. Went with the Cloudy Bay savignon blanc, quarter liter is only $15 and the Cloudy Bay is one of the most expensive wines on the menu! Other wines were as little as $7 for a quarter liter - incredible! Quartino will always be a good option if only for this reason. Our first dish was the veal meatballs in a tomato-basil sauce. The meatballs were certainly very good, though I would have preferred a little more seasoning to the meat. They bring parmesan for you to grate yourself and red chili flakes which added the flavor I desired though. Our next dish was maybe my favorite - the creamy polenta. It was cooked perfectly, just smooth enough but still with good texture and had a delicious cheese flavor. I added a bit of parmesan on top though this was unnecessary as the polenta had a delicious cheese flavor already. Our last savory dish was the ravioli. While the ravioli was fine, I guess I was hoping for a bit more, especially based on the menu's description and some yelp reviews. The flavors in the ravoli really just melded and I didn't get any of the unique incredients. Lastly we had dessert. She went with a cannoli which she said was excellent and the size was perfect for dessert. I had a half tiramisu which was still huge, good, but enormous. I took half of my half tiramisu home. I can't imagine what a single, full portion of the tiramisu would look like. Overall, good atmosphere, reasonable price, good food.

Being that places sell wine by the glass for 10.00, this is such a great deal.  The ambiance of the place great, more of a fancier casual- it draws a definite corporate after work crowd and pretty spacious.  We ordered calamari, margarita pizza, dates wrapped in pancetta, and porcini & truffle risotto. I would say the definite favorite was the risotto, though it wasn't enough to happily be shared by 6 people. The least was likely the pizza- it wasn't that it was bad, but it was pretty standard. Service was pretty good. The waiter was friendly and knowledgable about the menu.  For dessert i split a nutella panini with a friend and asked for vanilla ice cream with it. The dessert was a little disappointing- just some small toasted bread with nutella and some powdered sugar. It would've been completely a fail if we didn't add ice cream to it, which kept it from being too dry tasting. Without including our drinks, our total food bill came to just under 60 dollars- not bad for 6 people! i was expecting much more.

A couple of friends were in town this past weekend for a sailboat show down at Navy Pier, and they were looking for a good Saturday evening dinner spot. This place was absolutely packed to the rafters (mind you there are two floors and each floor has a lot of tables). Usually with big places, the service and food quality suffer a tad. There are just a lot of logistics involved in getting everything to line up for everyone.  Quartino's apparently is as seasoned in the business management department as they are in the kitchen. Service wasn't the quickest, but it was also Saturday night and of myself and two dinner guests, none of us were ever wondering where the waiter went. I forget the server's name but he was knowledgeable on everything we asked him about (whether it be food or wine or even where some of their products come from). Having worked in the service industry for an extended minute or two, these things really make a difference. He was also friendly yet brief--he wasn't trying to schmooze us on anything and made great recommendations.  Oh, yes, the food, I agree with some other reviews that the mushroom risotto was pretty average, but everything else was dynamite. Most notable was the Tuscan risotto, I believe. Italian doughnuts served with dark chocolate and honey for dessert was a great way to cap off the evening, in addition to some lemon-cello--though it may have been more bitter than the sweet I was hoping for.  And last, price. Price was very reasonable for quality. We shared 5 plates, 1/2 liter good red wine, dessert and lemon-cello all for just south of $100.

We attended a private function at Quartino's so we were upstairs in a special events room separate from the main dining area. Because of this, we didn't experience any of the noise problems mentioned in other reviews. The first thing that I noticed was the service - incredibly attentive staff for each table. One of our guests was allergic to spinach and the staff went out of their way to make sure she was not served anything with spinach in it. Another guest was only eating fruits and vegetables for some reason and they kept bringing her different options to enjoy. And the staff were just in a great mood...or maybe it just seemed that way since they kept the wine flowing throughout the night. The food was excellent - a preselected menu for the event and everything brought out was incredible. We really liked the meat and cheese plate - the sauces that came with the plate were almost like a chutney and they were to die for. The veal meatballs - awesome. The beef filets were perfectly cooked and the chicken was very moist.  If I had one comment it was that the tables were very small, it was hard to have everything on the table at once, especially since they pile extra plates in the center of the table so no room for any of the food dishes there.

We decided to try a neapolitan pie for an app. since they seemed to be well received.  Unfortunately, this pizza delivered little of what you expect from this style of pie.  The crust, which is often the star, was barely blistered and was limp.  The fennel sausage, onion and tomato topping was just a big yawn.  Needless to say no doggie bag needed here. The entrees fared better.  Home made pasta always makes me happy and this bowl of cavatelli with tomatoes, fresh basil and ricotta did make me smile - just a real rustic dish.  The eggplant parmigiana looked great and was enjoyed by my dining partner.  Can't recall the other dish but it was enjoyed as well.

It was seriously constant so didn't make for a relaxing night when you pair that with the ridiculous noise level.

The lady hosts had no expression and were not welcoming when we checked in and one even yelled at the other in front of us.

Highlight for me was probably the goat's milk ricotta with grilled bread.  Creamy and delicious, with a nice topping of fresh oregano and good olive oil.  Tried the gnocchi too (okay), the bacon wrapped dates (okay), and the baby octopus (above average).  Tried a bite of the sausage risotto which was very good. All told, for a large, downtown, touristy kind of place, it was better than I thought it would be , but probably not a place I'd revisit if it were up to me given the huge quantity of fine dining establishments available in the city.

I also had the cheese fondue, which was ok. I wasn't TOO impressed, but it was good. I had a size of cured olives as well, which were delicious.  My friend had the Caprese salad (I've had it before, nothing great) and the Penne ala Vodka. I tried a bite and it was delicious, had a bit of a kick. My main problem this visit was service. I had to ask for butter twice and our waiter forgot we ordered drinks so we waited forever. Once we asked about it, he even admitted he just totally forgot. He also charged us for an item we didn't order and when we mentioned it, he laughed. Weird.

I was especially pleased with the Shrimp risotto. Made with aged Acquarella rice from Piedmont, this was, bar none, the best risotto I have ever had. Prepared perfectly. The place is called a small plates restaurant, but all the dishes we had were decently sized, and thus well priced for River North Chicago. Our waiter was just right; cheerful, knowledgeable, efficient, and not too big of a salesman. Our food was served fairly promptly considering how busy and congested the restaurant was. We lucked upon  prompt table availability when we went for dinner. This was Monday night. Could be tough on a weekend, especially. The wine list was interesting and I would say average priced. The restaurant is part of a small local group, the Gibson Steakhouse Group. As for the noise level, I cringed when we entered. If it had been up to me, I would have left. But I asked my compatriots and they wee still wanting to eat there. And I am glad we did. I have to say it is worth putting up w/ the noise level; and the hustle bustle of the place.

I met up with a friend of mine who's from the city and luckily I came before my reservation was cancelled. I was running late. Thanks to the gals in the front for understanding.  Anyhow, if you made a reservation and you wanted to sit outside, you might have to wait a little for that because that's a separate waiting list. So we decided to sit inside. So for starters we ordered drinks. Drinks was $10 which is pretty normal for martinis. For dinner we split the bill and I don't know what we  ate but the bill came to about $40 each. We apparently ordered a lot of tapas. 1. Dates with bacon - sweet dates and bacon offered a well balanced bite 2. Veal Meatballs - overly dry meat, not a fan of this 3.  Creamy Polenta - nothing to rave about, just like mac and cheese 4. Cavatelli - good as the one from Little Italy Cleveland 5. Some stew with shrimp, mussels, scallops, more like a Bouillabaisse - this was very good. I couldn't find in this menu now but it could be what they offered as a seasonal thing.   This place is located in downtown and there are plenty of tables to sit in or out to people watch or grab your friends to go with.

Thanks to our terrific server for offering a split option - 3 of each - when I couldn't make up my mind.  Also had the eggplant parm - lots of cheese - would have liked more eggplant - and I would order it again anyway. They serve these hot items for sharing in little cast iron pans.  Excellent wine selection. I like that you can order the amount that suits you  - glass, 1/2 liter, bottle, or liter!!  Service was very nice. Timely, friendly, offered suggestions, efficient !

I'd first tried it on a trip to Chicago a year ago, and was happy to find the service and food just as good as I remembered. I was in town for the Chicago Marathon, and even packed with hungry carb-loading runners, the service was friendly and efficient. Their flatbread pizza is terrific - very crispy thin crust, and not too much sauce or cheese. Two of their menu items are particular standouts: the caprese salad is the best I've had. It's made with thick slices of real buffalo mozzerella, and a deliciously sweet balsamic. If you're hungry (or have a friend with you to share) try the Salumeria Tasting. It's a generous portion of meats, cheeses and ""spuntini"" (small sides such as roasted beet salad, pickled vegetables, and the like). I'm a big eater and it was too much for me to finish on my own. One of the bartenders, Rob, deserves a special shout-out. If he's working I strongly suggest you sit at the bar and ask for his advice. They have a large selection of wine, by the quarter-, half-, or full carafe. Tell him what you like, he'll let you try a taste or two and lead you to some interesting selections - and he won't try to up-sell you.",0.9958,0.759,0.224,0.018,0.49540229885057474

We came in around 6pm on a Monday night and were seated immediately; about an hour later we probably would've had a short wait. As soon as we sat down I knew I picked the right place. It has a very casual atmosphere perfect for dinner with coworkers or friends, perfect for a single girl like me who eats out with her guy friends a lot - I hate when places feel too ""datey"". But, it's not so casual you couldn't come here on a date. It's a perfect balance! The waiter asked if we had been there before and then explained the concept about how plates were normally meant to be shared among groups, and how the portion sizes would differ from your typical restaurant. We decided to just get our own ""entrees"" and so we both ordered salads, and my boss ordered a pizza and I ordered shrimp. The waiter also brought me several samples of white wine to pair with my shrimp, since I typically drink red. He was very knowledgeable about the wine without being pushy. I had the caprese salad, something I've been afraid to order since my trip to Rome back in 2009. It was just like being in Italy - the mozzarella was fresh and the balsamic was addicting! The shrimp entree was great; the only ""negative"" was my fault. I was expecting the shrimp to be over a bed of pasta but looking back the menu didn't say that. But it was still good! My boss let me try some of his pizza, it was EVOO-based rather than using marinara sauce. I was a fan.

Also, possibly the LOUDEST place I have ever had the misfortune to visit.  The person seated next to me could not hear me above the 'roar' of the overcrowded room.  Horrible experience.   There is not one thing in this establishment that ever makes me want to step in it again.  Not even an offer for a free meal. Assured by our waiter that our small plates would arrive in an staggered fashion we ordered several plates from both the appetizer and pasta options. Four of us were dining so we ordered about 8 dishes.  ALL 8 dishes arrived at the same time.  The tables at Quartino are small to begin with so you can imagine that 8 dishes quickly overwhelmed the table.  Let me just point out something that most people may be missing at this point......if you order 8 dishes and they all arrive at the same time this has got to lead you to believe that all their food is prepared way ahead of time and then slopped onto serving dishes when ordered and then rushed out to tables.  Classy? Delicious? Mouth-watering?  Think Again.   I couldn't wait to get out of this place.  I don't get the appeal.  Honestly.  Horrible food.  Olive Garden is better (and that is saying ALOT!).

2013-10-16,2.0,"This place did not live up to the hype AT ALL! In fact, it was one of the most uncomfortable experiences I've had at a restaurant in a long time - mostly due to the atmosphere. However, the food is decent/pretty good, and probably deserves 3 stars. I would never recommend this restaurant for dinner, but it may be a nice option for dessert.  The cons:  - It's extremely LOUD inside the restaurant, probably because they try to squeeze in as many tables as possible in a small area. If you're sitting next to a loud party, don't even try having a conversation with your table because you won't be able to hear a word anyone is saying, even when they're right next to you. - The tables are extremely small and cramped. My party of 4 was at a table that was better suited for 2. Add on the dishes and pizza once they started to come out, and you can imagine that no one had any room to move at all.  - The food was not as amazing as I expected. In addition, the portions of the pasta & risotto dishes were really small! I was shocked to see how small they were, given their price. We ordered the following:     - Funghi Pizza - Roasted Portobellos & Crushed Tomatoes - $11    - Tortellini - Alfredo Sauce, Peas, & Prosciutto - $11.75    - Mushroom Risotto - Fresh Mushrooms, Mushroom Puree, & Pork Stock - $11.50    - Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo - Tuscan Pasta Ribbons with Braised Beef Tomato Sauce - $11.75 The pros:  - We made a reservation beforehand for a Saturday night. When we arrived, we were seated right away.   - Perhaps if you're seated outside (which we were not), you'll have a nice view of downtown.  - My favorite dish was the Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo. I'd recommend this dish, even though the portions are small. - We were impressed by their desserts (they were delicious!) and thought they had a large variety. We ordered the following:     - Zeppole - $5.50 Hot Italian Doughnuts with Honey or Dark Chocolate    - Profiteroles - $6.50 Vanilla Gelato, Chocolate Sauce, & Toasted Almonds Overall, if you only have a couple of meals to eat in downtown Chicago, don't waste one of your meals at Quartino.

2013-10-16,3.0,"My first day in Chicago, and I've already hit up my SECOND tapas restaurant. I'm glad the windy city appreciates the act of sharing food! I checked out Quartino with two friends around 6pm and we were seated very promptly. It started getting more packed around 7pm. The interior is lovely and has a very different ambiance than what you would expect from a typical sit down restaurant. The staff are all wearing soccer jerseys and the decorations enhance the Italian atmosphere - you can even read different Italian newspapers while you wait! We started off with a complimentary serving of bread. The bread was not appetizing at all. It was cold and seemed somewhat stale, and it actually reduced my appetite. Not the best start to a meal. Our first dish was the baby spinach salad with pears, walnuts, and ricotta. The salad was nothing impressive at all. Super easy to replicate, and here you are spending $8 on it. Get another salad instead. Next was the duck prosciutto pizza. It's fairly well sized for the price, but you could hardly taste the duck that I eventually forgot I was eating duck pizza. What was more prominent was the generous topping of fresh arugula on top that added a unique peppery twist to each bite. The inside of the pizza was great, but the crust was way too hard. The last item to come out was the pappardelle (broad flat pasta) with braised beef tomato sauce. The pasta was tougher than what I'm used to, but apparently this is intentional. The beef and tomato sauce was excellent though. This is a sweet and savory dish that's easily enjoyable. On a humorous note, the bathroom utterly surprised me. I saw a gentleman who obviously worked there chatting it up with a customer while music was jamming in the background through a stereo set. He never once looked me in the eyes, but turned on the tap for me and offered me soap.

The pizza sauce was fresh tasting but a little bland. Overall it was just okay. The eggplant parmesan was overly mushy, salty and greasy for my taste.  I would also pass on the baby spinach salad in the future. It's dry, with a few thin slices of raw pears (typically they are carmelized in my experience but I'm no chef), what seemed like just a drizzle of balsamic vinegar on it, and sprinkled with walnuts and grated ricotta.  The plates also stacked up quickly on our table and several people came and went without taking them. We found ourselves staking them strategically under the pizza stand.

Cheap wine, yummy food, good atmosphere, and great location, what's not to love? They have $10 bottles that they rotate, and while they do go with a shared plates style, the plates are not mini by any means, and if you are eating with 2 friends, each select a plate, and add on if necessary.  As for the food, my go-tos are the pappardelle, any of the pizzas, and the arugula salad. I even took some vegan friends here and they have a number of dishes that are vegan friendly without lacking on taste and quality. For dessert, get the donuts and ask for both the chocolate and the honey sauces. Just do it. And the WINE. 1/4 liter, 1/2 liter, bottle, there are a ton of options and all reasonably priced to share or drink yourself. Go here in the summer and sit out on the patio, it's wonderful.

But wandering the streets of Old Town and Lincoln Park searching Yelp for a good spot for that night's dinner, we happened upon Quartino. Now we're already suckers for small plates, but throw in the Italian flare and were even more excited. We easily got a reservation on a Monday night, despite finding the restaurant packed when we arrived. We got some great people watching in sitting on the patio, with perfect Chicago fall evening weather.  Now the food was fantastic, starting off with some olives and an amazing caprese salad. My wife fell in love with the egg plant salad, and they even got her some GF crackers to dip into it. They also have gluten free pasta, which you can pair with any of the pasta dishes. The GF pasta is a corn pasta, which tastes as good as any we've tried, and mixed into the sausage ragu it was phenomenal. But while the food was some of the best we'd had on our trip, we definitely have to say that the service was by far the best. Our waiter Scott was personable, communicative, very sensitive to my wife's food allergy, and incredibly accommodating.

We tried the olive assortment - nothing too special/unique about them. Then had the dates wrapped in prosciutto - they were fantastic, could've eaten 2 orders! They are basically an Italian version of the Spanish tapas dates, if you ever had those kind. We then split the rigatoni with vodka sauce. SO good!!! Loved the sauce. Seemed a little creamier/cheesier than other vodka sauces we've had. I even used the bread (which was good too - olive oil, etc served at each table) to soak up the last bits of sauce!! Next we moved on to the Soprano pizza. It had veal meatballs and giardiniera (which is just hot, pickled peppers & veggies - sounds odd but SO good!) the meatballs were smaller & sliced so they seemed like eating chunks of sausage on a pizza vs. an actual meatball. They were moist & flavorful! Great combo of flavors on the pizza, definitely recommend. The only thing I would not recommend is the white wine sangria.

I had very high expectations for this place after reading the yelp reviews and I was disappointed. It is rare that yelp lets me down, but every once in a while it happens. for starters this restaurant is rated at a $$ which I feel is not correct. everything on the menu cost between 8-15 each, which sounds pretty inexpensive. trust me it adds up. my boyfriend and I ordered 4 things off the menu and dessert. the 4 dishes which were small plates came out as two-raviolis-on -a-plate-size. so after are 4 dishes were we both hungry, and let me say that I am a light eater. For two people to make a meal you would probably need to order 6 or 7 dishes.  The food was good, but honestly nothing sticks out as being good enough to be specifically mentioned. Even though the food was good we couldn't justify ordering another 2 bites of food for $15.  We ended up ordering dessert which was normal size and let me tell you, it was great. We had the warm chocolate cake with vanilla gelato. It was warm, chocolaty, gooey, sweet, magnificence. If I could I would give the cake alone 5 stars, everything else about a 2.  The service was fine, it was a rather busy night so I understand the want to get people fed and out as fast as can be, but the staff seemed very impersonal and like you were just another tab. For a ""nicer"" place I expect a waitress who takes a min or 2 to go over the menu or check up on you.  The bill came out to be $70! I felt like we were being stolen from.

Our waiter misheard our orders it was so loud. Pandemonium!  Most of the food we got here was really good. Be careful because it's small portions you may find yourself ordering WAY more than you can eat. That's what happened when I went with my girlfriends and we ended up with a lot left over.  Service was a bit disappointing. My friend had to ask 4 times for butter, the runner brought us the shrimp risotto when we ordered the mushroom. Sadly I'm allergic to shellfish so we were left waiting about 10 minutes to get someone's attention and then another 15 for the new dish. Eek gads! Once we got the mushroom risotto it was delicious. The gnocchi was to die for. With our sangria (they have white, yay) and food, we ended up spending about $40 each, eek. Honestly, Quartino has some good food but it's not amazing enough to have me come back & not be able to hear anyone I'm with, pay a million dollars for parking and have mediocre service.

2013-09-12,4.0,"Silly us! We didn't make a reservation for a restaurant in downtown Chicago on a Saturday night, on a long weekend. So obviously, we were going to have to wait. On the recommendations of a friend (and a quick check on Yelp) we decided to try Quartino. We got in line to put our names down for a table, while our friend tried to scope out the bar area, where they do serve dinner and seating is first come first serve. The host said there would be a 45 minute wait. We put our names down and a couple of minutes later, scratched our name off because of a call we got from our friend, who had found a table in the bar area.   We settled in and ordered a pitcher of Sangria, which was very nice. After a lot of too and fro, we managed to decide on dinner. We ordered the Dates wrapped in Pancetta, the Braised Pork Shank, Duck Prosciutto, and the Spaghetti All' Arrabbiata ( spaghetti in spicy tomato sauce).  I think the dates wrapped in pancetta and the braised pork shank, tied for Best Dish of the Evening; however, my husband says the braised pork shank was the out-and-out winner. The Pork shank was fall-of-the-bone tender and beautifully flavored, an absolute piece of perfection. The Dates were stuffed with Gorgonzola Dolce, wrapped in a nice salty pancetta and then drizzled with honey. They tasted like little bites of heaven. The Duck Prosciutto was accompanied by some Giardiniera (pickled vegetables) which were very tasty on their own, but completely over powered the prosciutto, in my opinion. The prosciutto was also, extremely tiny pieces, and definitely my least favorite dish of them all.  The Spaghetti was the last to come out, and a pretty big portion. It was flavored very nicely, with the perfect amount of zing to it, and the Parmesan they had on the table, complimented it well.  For dessert we ordered the Zeppole, described on the menu as 'Hot Italian Doughnuts with Honey or Dark Chocolate'. When we ordered, I asked our waitress which would be better, the honey or the Dark chocolate, and she told us that she'd just bring out both. Boy! Am I glad she did. The dark chocolate was without doubt the table favorite, and got over before the last doughnut did, however, I really liked the hot doughnut with the honey as well. That said, if I had to choose, I'd go with the dark chocolate.  My only complaint about Quartino was the announcements over the speakers. The hostess was using a mic to call out the names of people waiting for a table, but the announcements were so loud, that we could not hear anything else, and had to pause in our conversations every time she would announce a name and since this is a huge restaurant, with a fast turn over, the announcements were beings made every minute or so. I think Quartino should turn down the volume just a little bit, so that the announcements aren't jarring. That aside, I'd like to go back to Quartino every opportunity I get.",0.9957,0.848,0.135,0.017,0.5639492753623188

The tapas were mediocre (we got the calamari, caprese, scallops, broccoli rabe, dates wrapped in Italian meat, mushroom risotto, clams with pasta) - all of which I thought was a fair evaluation because it was a good amount of food and oh, the free bread that they gave. The bread was cold and stale, butter was not flavorful but paired with balsamic vinegar it was a tad bit better. The dishes were like I said mediocre except for the scallops but the dish was also 16 dollars for three scallops so that wasn't such a great deal. The mushroom risotto tasted a little funny and the broccoli rabe was bitter that we almost threw it away. On top of that, the service was whatever. The servers in their Italian jerseys were not super attentive and pressured us multiple times to order more food and dessert and that was no bueno.

Parents are well travelled and I've been to New York but this place can't even compare to our Vancouver BC quality for pizza. In my 30odd years of pizza eating never had I left a restaurant with unfinished pizza. Well my parents did the same tonight. The homemade fettuccine was just as poor.  Pizza crust was the chewiest I've ever had, tomatoe sauce tasted raw and uncooked, cheese was so thin and flavourless, basil leaves (on the margarita) was also raw! A frozen pizza would have fared better.  Homemade fettuccine had a rough and very chewy texture. It was also unusually thick- so much so I thought we ordered bad handmade Chinese noodles.  They don't even have draft beer, maybe just good ambiance. Oh and the washroom design was unique- so I liked that.  Was at Pizano's two nights ago- Very good deep dish and homemade pasta- though they're known for their thin crust I believe.    or Portillos hot dogs is just 2 blocks away and yes they're awesome.

Dirty Martini was ok, the blue cheese olives didn't taste fresh, they had a weird taste to them.   Prosciutto wrapped dates were amazing, best part of the meal.  Split a beef filet, the kitchen actually made them to two different temps.  I wasn't expecting this, so it was a really nice thing they would accommodate.  They even told us which was which.   This is great bc my BF and I do not share the same opinion on how meat should be cooked (medium rare obviously). Our other two dishes weren't bad, they just weren't all that great.  The gnocchi was fresh, but was not a fan of the pesto sauce and veggies it was served with.  The Soprano Pizze was really good, I just didn't realize they use fennel in the giardiniera.  We specifically avoided the Italian Sausage so we wouldn't have to taste fennel, but by no means is that the restaurant's fault.

Looking at the menu - I wanted to try so many things but I settled for a few good ones.  The idea here is very similar to a small plates / tapas kind of deal but this is Chicago so beware of the massive portions.  The Veal meatball basil red chili pizza was good but nothing out of this world (then again I thought it was unfair for me to have just tried the best Pizza I've ever experienced the night before at Giordano's), the roasted lemon and herb chicken was stunning, the eggplant olive and caper salad was also nice and refreshing as was the duck prosciutto and the chicken soup, but I think the real star of this meal was the veal sliders - they were excellent and at just $2.50 each, it's almost a no-brainer to try at least one.  To wash it all down - an Italian blood orange and grapefruit soda.  And all of that rarely put a dent in my wallet - it's definitely recommended for anyone visiting Chicago.  Massive props to the exceptionally friendly and helpful waitstaff who go above and beyond even in such insanely busy nights.",0.9921,0.82,0.161,0.019,0.5945396825396825

What I like about Quartino is that they do half plates on many of their main plates, so we were able to try 2 or 3 different dishes each without feeling too full or paying a lot.  We split a plate of bruschette which I found to be different in taste and more artistically plated than I've seen at other places. It was good but messy (the bread was too big to be bite-size, and biting made the toppings fall off). I ordered the Crisp Calamari and the Tortellini pasta (half order). The tortellini was amazing but unfortunately I am newly lactose intolerant so I had to get the half order (my stomach still voiced its displeasure after my meal). I think my friend ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana and then tasted the Giardiniera Romana, which was actually pretty good for being pickled vegetables (our server was kind enough to get her a tiny plate of that because it was too small to begin with to make it a half plate and my friend didn't want to order it fully in case she didn't like it).

Learning our lesson from the night before, we got reservations. At 8pm, it was  PACKED. Hell, at 10pm, it was still pretty packed. Despite this, service was amiable, quick and super enthusiastic (but not annoyingly so) and helpful. We ordered the duck prosciutto, fried calimari, beef ragu pappardelle and sausage pizza. Duck prosciutto may be the best combination of words in the combo of English and Italian languages. After decimating the first order, I ordered another and ended up taking it to go. The fried calimari was perfectly cooked, just a bit of chewiness and fantastic. The pasta was probably the best I've ever had. I could have eaten a vat of it myself. I'm pretty sure the noodles were fresh, not dry, as they were just unbelievably tasty and perfectly cooked. The sauce was meaty, flavourfu and just the right amount. I'm still dreaming about this dish. The pizza was pretty good. I don't love pizza in general, because I can't have cheese. Pizza without cheese is sad. They were very careful about topping only half of the pizza with cheese, and did their best to cut carefully to avoid cross-contamination. The Hubster really enjoyed his cheese-laden side. After this, the Hubster and I were full to the gills and exited with leftovers, which ended up being the fanciest breakfast anyone has ever had at a picnic table by an outlet mall.  The atmosphere is crowded, loud, casual and cozy. It feels more bustly than busy, like you're at a super fun dinner party. For Toronto readers, this will blow you away: All this, plus a couple of beers and a 1/2L of red wine (a good one) came to less than $100 after tax and tip. For non-Toronto readers, this quality and quantity will easily run close to $150. EASILY. Consider yourselves lucky on this front, Americans. I'm counting this as a must-go when visiting.

2013-08-15,5.0,"My favorite restaurant ever!  I have been fortunate to eat at the finest restaurants in S.F., L.A., the O.C., Hawaii, the list goes on... I even opened this Yelp account thing JUST to review Quartino.  I ate here with my boyfriend and his parents one night and came back the next night with a party of 9 because the food was so good!  Hell, we even craved Quartino the next day but opted out of another trip to the city.  Ok...obviously I LOVED it.... Why?  The Salumeria tasting was the best idea.  Two meats, two cheeses, three spuntini and delicious apricot puree and mostarda to compliment.  The duck prosciutto with Taleggio cheese and apricot puree atop a nut/raisin(maybe dates) bread?! I felt like the rat in Ratatouille.  We ordered a pizza both nights; first the Prosciutto D'Anitra and the next night the Soprano (added tomato sauce).  Delicious pizza Naples style and so good we devoured it before we could speak. Ordered a liter of house wine and finished it (well, mostly I did).  Also ordered the shrimp dish, soup, and the Dates wrapped in Pancetta.  I hate Gorgonzola cheese but somehow I enjoyed the combination of Pancetta and honey atop the dates.  We also ordered dessert; Coppa al Banana and The Hot Chocolate cake (BOTH AMAZING).  The party we brought with us the second night were a group of true Italians and they also were in amazement of the ecstasy brought on by Quartino's food.  Amazing, amazing, amazing. Service was great.  In fact, if it weren't for Brandon/Brendon (it is loud in there) we probably would have passed it up the first night and meandered elsewhere.  He explained the menu and within a few seconds we were watering at the mouth.  Waiters and waitresses are very attentive and the bussers are constantly clearing your table.  I felt like I was in Italy!! This is mentioned last in my review because the quality of food is priceless, however their prices are very affordable.  About $100 for a party of 4 to gorge?!  I'd be there 3 times a week if I could.

The bun was too thick and too big.  I propose that if one is going to serve meatballs as a ""small plate"" they should either bake or contract out a small bun where the proportions are more appropriate.  The salads were wonderful.  They put the right amount of balsamic vinegar, good mozzarella, and sweet tomato.   If you go to Quartino, you must absolutely get the zeppole, the traditional Italian dessert usually on a ""St. Joseph Table"". For the heathen, Italians celebrate the Feast of St. Joseph on 19 March with great solemnity and they have a huge spread of foods, many unique to the feast, and zeppole is one of them!  They are chocolate perfection in a puff pastry.  I had my doubts they could pull it off, but Quartino did it perfectly.   The wine list is wonderfully diverse, with very affordable wines. The five of us polished off 4 bottles, along with pizza, meatballs, salad, and salmon and the bill came to only $160, not bad.   The pizzas are sincerely wonderful.  They top them with terrific ingredients like arugula which is wonderfully peppery, good olive oil, and a nice fire baked crust.

We shared the veal meatballs, shrimp risotto, and linguine with clams between the two of us. The veal meatballs lived up to the hype on Yelp. Tender, moist, flavorful... just everything that you envision in a perfect meatball. I don't know what the marinade is to create such tenderness but the meatballs just melt in your mouth! The shrimp risotto was the winner for us, however. There was such depth in its broth/sauce that rendered the dish to be both creamy but an intoxicating roasted and nutty flavor at the same time. The shrimp were furthermore cooked perfectly. Needless to say, we were talking about this dish for the next two days. We also shared a chocolate lava cake which seemed to have espresso as its base.

Alright, there's a bit more to be said. But honestly I'm not sure I can add anymore to what everyone else has already gushed about. The environment, food, and service are impeccable, top-notch. Our waiter was patient, friendly, and incredibly knowledgeable not just about all aspects of the ""usual suspects"" on the food menu, but which wines/sizes would go well with our meal as well. We ordered the Campania pizza (a white pizza), the duck prosciutto, and a sort of self-devised concoction pasta that was pure perfection on a plate. Our pasta was an angel hair with vodka sauce and garlic and it was the ideal serving size for two mildly hungry people who still would like to devour a delicious thin-crust pizza. Our waiter seemed to read our mind when we couldn't find a pasta off the menu that really appealed off the bat and suggested that we invent our own to our liking. The duck prosciutto was very good, but certainly more of an amuse-bouche than a stand-alone plate, in my opinion? It had a great chewiness and mouthfeel and a good cured flavor, but wasn't too salty at all. There was also a side of pickled vegetables that I wasn't very impressed by, but this is more because I don't really care for pickled things in general. The pizza, oh mygoodness, the pizza. Ricotta cheese, soft cherry tomatoes, basil, I don't know how this could possibly go any better than it did. The pizza was so fresh and delicious that it felt like every bite I took only increased my happiness further and made me crave more! (rather than that pesky diminishing returns theory). I honestly have a slight desire to live here in Chicago forever just so I never have to be too far away from the pizza. I don't really like deep dish pizza too much (too heavy with the tomato), but I love thin-crust, and this thin-crust pizza is, without a doubt, the best I've ever had.

The menu consists of traditional Italian fare, pizza's, pasta's etc.  The portions are small AND meant to be shared, so feel free to order extra entrees.  We typically order a pizza and a few different pasta's and share everything.  The food is of a decent quality, though falls far short of some other Italian restaurants in the city.  I find myself gravitated to the restaurant more for its ambiance and the ability to try a few different things over the quality of its food product.  I am not implying that it is bad, however, the food does taste like it has been mass produced to please their carbohydrate hungry patrons.

For those who don't know, Quartino is a small plates restaurant dealing in Italian cuisine - they are meant to be shared. My friend and I shared the caprese salad, the sun dried tomato soup, the penne alla vodka, and the shrimp risotto. Caprese: pretty simple, nothing special. Soup: same. Both the penne and risotto were suuuuuper hot (I just love fresh hot food), and was delivered without much of a wait. I enjoyed the penne more so than the risotto, but both were really good.  The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was INCREDIBLY loud - I could barely hear what my friend was saying.

Not that impressive, mostly a pile of spinach with a sprinkle of cheese, so i would skip that next time. But the dinner was quite lovely. I got the Brodetto Ai Frutti Di Mare and I was literally drinking the sauce, It was so delicious. Although the octopus was a little undercooked and looked like a real octupus, tentacles and suction cups and all, so be prepared. My pops got Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo which he liked but he's a sweetheart and never complains. Personally, I think it lay flat, not a lot going on, not much flavor and was a much smaller portion than mine (which was generous and also full of seafood, they don't skimp at all.) Also, the meat in the pappardelle was the kind of beef in pot roast, for anyone whose had that. So not ground beef; it had that kind of earthy stew flavor. I don't much care for it.

2013-07-24,3.0,"OK, first off, I am an Italian food SNOB, having grown up with a Sicilian mother and having lived in Southern Italy for several years earlier in life. As a result, I can be a tough grader on Italian restaurants, so keep this in mind as you read further. I arrived at Quartino slightly before my 6PM reservation, and thought ""What a cool place!"". People were sitting outside, along the street, and some were on the second floor balcony overlooking State Street (that great street). There was a lot of street and subway noise (a couple subway vent grates are on the sidewalk beside the outdoor seating), so I decided to get a table inside, as I was meeting 3 business colleagues and wanted a quieter atmosphere more conducive to conversation.  When I got inside I loved the decor and ambience. Very much trattoria meets Italian deli; warm and inviting. Shortly after I arrived, 2 of the remaining 3 members of my party arrived so we were shown to our small table for four in the middle of the interior space on the first floor. We were amongst the only ones there, and the ambient noise level was acceptable (hint: notice this is the second time I've mentioned noise level and I haven't even gotten to the food yet). The fourth member of our party arrived a few minutes later, and oddly enough, that seemed to be the time when a large influx of other diners occurred. Our waitress came by and got our drink orders, and I could barely hear her. She was somewhat soft-spoken, though. She explained that Quartino was a different kind of restaurant, that the portions were small and meant to be shared, and that the best way to enjoy the menu is to order a few things and they would arrive as they are ready, then order a few more, etc., etc., until you have your fill. A huge stack of plates was in the center of the table to allow for a continual flow of new tastes and food. We ordered a round of beer and started off with a Quattro Stagione pizza, and olive plate and some veal meatballs. The olives were delicious, the veal meatballs were out of this World, however the pizza was a huge disappointment. The crust was horribly soggy and wet, and the toppings all slid off the crust every time we went to take a slice. Clearly this is because they didn't drain or otherwise dry the toppings adequately (my guess is it was the artichokes that flooded the crust), and water leached out all over the crust and other toppings. Absolutely inexcusable in a place that promotes its pizza as much as they do. The only way I could eat it was to smash it all together on my plate and scoop it up with my fork. The next wave of food was a decidedly better: decent fried calamari with rather bland marinara sauce, some excellent pork dish and very good gnocchi with a cheesy spinach sauce.  After working our way through our ""second round"" and a few more beers, we moved onto the dessert. The dessert seemed to be more of an individual thing. One of our party ordered a raspberry sorbet and enjoyed it; another tried some sort of banana coppa thing and he said it was delicious; I ordered a plate of zeppole with chocolate sauce, and they were divine. Perfectly fried and the sauce had just the right amount of sweetness, bitterness and chocolate flavor.  Now, as for the noise. It was horrendously loud once the whole dinner crowd arrived. I gave up trying to hold a conversation with anyone not seated directly next to me and couldn't hear a single thing the waitress said after taking our initial drink order. Sure the place was crowded, and yes the tables are close together, but my ears were literally ringing when I stepped outside, and didn't stop ringing until I arrived home after a 10 minute Red Line subway ride. I think part of the issue is the hard floors and tin ceilings provide no sound absorption at all. I dunno - but I do know this almost ruined the evening for me. I don't know if it would be any better outside, but I can't imagine it being worse, even with the street noise, cars and subways rumbling past.  So, all in all, not a bad place. I'll may go back; will likely try to sit outside; and I may even try the pizza again, but absolutely no pizza with any topping that needs draining or drying or that contains a lot of water.",0.9857,0.876,0.091,0.033,0.43498572514701517

As far as our meal, everything was great.  Our waiter was very helpful and we decided to try a bunch of things from all over the menu.  We started with the angus beef carpaccio and the spinach salad, both of which were very refreshing on a hot evening.  We then ordered the mushroom risotto (delicious), sea scallops (nothing special, but I love scallops), and the veal osso buco (tender and juicy).  The three of us were still hungry, so we ordered the eggplant parmagiana (not my favorite but still good) and the roasted baby octopus (amazing).  We finished with a sorbet and biscotti type dessert that was very good.",0.9902,0.847,0.147,0.006,0.6773809523809523

2013-07-19,5.0,"While visiting Chicago recently for an extended vacation, my husband and I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn at State/Grand (reviewed on TA), with amazing 21st floor views of the city, including a bird's-eye view of Quartino. To say this place is 'packed' every evening, would be an understatement. The 9 - 5 local crowd begins to filter in right after work, and dining goes late into the evening. Being a regular on TA and Yelp, I had done my homework and learned that Quartino is a popular place with both Chicago visitors AND locals (always a good sign).  The atmosphere is friendly, comfortable, and very loud. (Think: gregarious dinner party with 50 of your closest friends and alcohol flowing - in a cavernous room.)  Yes, THAT kind of loud.  The wait staff is friendly, efficient, knowledgeable, and extremely accommodating. We were lucky enough to meet Lanny, Alicia, and Jose on our Sunday evening visit. They were exceptional, to say the least!  Professionalism that matched a 5-star restaurant, but with the ease of a carefully-planned family function. My husband, a former Disney employee, and I noted the outstanding service.   This is a tapas restaurant, so the menu is pretty overwhelming with so many dishes from which to choose, if you're new to tapas. That's where your wait staff can help, offering suggestions - about pairings, how much food to expect, etc... Speaking of pairings, the red sangria was wonderful! And....  you can order just the size you want. I highly recommend a liter.... it's sublime.  The Husband chose martinis and wasn't disappointed. An excellent bottle of wine rounded out our over-the-top meal in this amazing restaurant. (We splurged a tad.)   Attire: dressy casual for evening - not too fancy, not too casual - 'city chic' or dressier resort wear would be appropriate: dark jeans, slacks for the guys, or a nice summer dress.    You'll find seating indoors and limited outdoors, though our HOT July visit kept us indoors.  It's a great restaurant for couples or groups... like an Italian family meal, the chairs are pulled up to accommodate all who arrive!  I don't think I'd recommend this restaurant for families with small children/babies after 5 PM... not because they wouldn't be welcomed, but because of how loud it is.  We saw a few families with small children, (looked like locals), and they were leaving shortly after we arrived around 6:15 PM. We did notice a few teenagers with parents, and even they kind of looked a little overwhelmed at the noise and pace.  During the day, probably an entirely different story. It IS, after all, a very comfortable place.    Saved the best for last - the food:  WOW!!!  We tried a few dishes:  white bean and garlic spread with crusty bread, calamari with a house red sauce, beef tips, beef ribs, and gnocchi. All were outstanding, but the gnocchi and beef tips stood out as 'exceptional' - with rich flavors, perfectly cooked, and paired beautifully with red wine. Well into my 40's, I never truly appreciated the red wine/white wine pairing concept - and I'm a wine drinker who's visited Napa Valley a few times - until our visit to Quartino. The beef tips deserve a dry red wine.... mouth-watering!!    OUTSTANDING.   Be sure to visit the upstairs restrooms and check out the entryway as you go through their doors. Take a dollar or two for the lovely attendants in the RR.   To close, I'd like to send a BIG thank you to Adam and his entire team. Taking time to stop by our table to personally welcome us to Quartino was quite nice, especially during such a busy evening.",0.9993,0.745,0.227,0.028,0.5749661997810146

Duck Prosciutto - pretty good, but a bit too oily. Also ordered a bellini, which was super fruity and couldn't taste the alcohol at all.

We pulled out our phones, checked the Yelp app, and decided to go to Quartino. Although it was getting late by Chicago standards and it was a weeknight, there were still a ton of people at Quartino. Luckily for us, we were still quickly seated. Our server was friendly and did a good job explaining the different types of cheeses to us. We decided to order the Taleggio Cheese with Apricot Puree, Wild Arugula Salad, and Gnocchi. I enjoyed the cheese and my brother liked the apricot puree. The arugula salad was delicious and my favorite part of the meal. It was flavorful and fresh, and I loved the liberal use of oranges and hazelnuts. My brother loved the gnocchi. I'm usually a big pesto eater, but I didn't love the pasta. The gnocchi was soft and well-filled and I think most people would have liked it, I just tend to prefer something chewier and with a bit more texture that I can gnash my teeth into.  After eating our fill, we decide to peruse the dessert menu just to see what they are. Our eyes ended up being bigger than our stomachs and we ordered the Profiteroles, which were delicious!

I could see it being a good place for a first date, or to even catch a soccer game (I noticed jerseys hanging on the walls, and the servers were also wearing jersey shirts). I liked the atmosphere a lot, it definitely reminded me of Italy. There was an old Sophia Loren movie from the 70s playing on the televisions, perhaps to bring customers back to old Italy? We opted for the Lunch special for 2, where you got to select 1 item from the wine bar plates or soup and salad section, 1 item from the pasta/risotto section, and 1 item from the meats/seafood section. All for $25. Fiancé and I got to pick different soups (minestrone and sundried tomato), and we also picked the calamari and the housemade Tagliatelle Bolognese pasta.  The food was good; my sundried tomato soup came with fresh parmesan shavings and a small sprig of basil. The calamari was well portioned and despite its deep fry coating, was relatively light and not overly salted. The tagliatelle pasta did indeed taste house made and I loved the chewy texture. I've been contemplating purchasing a pasta maker and this only makes me want to buy one even more, which probably conflicts with my goal of eating less wheat/carbs. Perhaps after the wedding? heh.

I have been to one other tapas restaurant (Cafe Babareeba in Lincoln Park) and even though they are different styles of cuisine I had my hopes set high for Quartinos solely because Cafe Babareeba was SO good. But unfortunately all tapas restaurants are not made the same. Prosciutto wrapped dates - yuck! The dates were way too small, couldn't even taste the prosciutto, the honey was extremely overpowering, and the blue cheese only enhanced the sweet flavor. Way too sweet. We were given 6 little portion sizes and could not finish it because of the sweetness. The bacon wrapped dates at Cafe Babareeba were absolutely amazing but these were not even comparable. Grilled baby octopus - another disappointment. Cold, extremely chewy, no flavor. Nothing special at all. Mushroom risotto - this was decent but something that I could easily make at home. Nothing to rave about. Mushroom tomato pizza - this was another extremely sweet dish. I'm not sure if it was from the tomatoes but it was overly sweet. The texture of the mushrooms were just weird. Not good at all. It was a very odd dish, we were just confused about the flavored and textures because they did not play well together.

2013-06-21,5.0,"Quartino is the go-to restaurant for my husband and me: we go here about once a month. The food is always delicious.  We recently traveled in Italy for nearly two weeks, and we felt that the food at Quartino was generally better than ""real"" Italian food.  We always get a selection of meats and cheeses (parmigiano reggiano and prosciutto di parma are favorites).  The calamari is delicious. Our pasta favorites are the tagliatelle alla bolognese and the pappardelle al sugo di manzo.  Both are very flavorful and have a good mix of meat, sauce, and pasta. My husband loves the roasted baby octopus and we get it fairly often, but this dish tastes a little off to me every time.  The desserts are delicious, especially the donuts with the dipping sauce. My one complaint about the food is that a very good bone marrow dish, which was on the menu after it was revamped about a year ago, was taken off a while ago and has never been back.  I wish Quartino would bring back the bone marrow, as it was very good. Maybe if people ask for it, they'll put it back.  Quartino's prices are quite reasonable: we almost always spend less here than we do at other River North spots. Reservations are a must (often a week or so in advance for weekend) as the restaurant is always crazy busy. Without a reservation, you're looking at a wait of at least an hour on the weekends.  It's also very loud  (although we generally manage to hold a conversation).  Quartino seems to attract a lot of bachelorette parties, which adds to the noise level.  I normally hate noisy restaurants, but my love for the food outweighs any noise-related concerns.",0.9695,0.827,0.122,0.051,0.5304166666666666

2013-06-06,4.0,"(written by my wife) While visiting Chicago with my family to see my cousins, it happened to be my birthday. This is where my native cousins suggested we go, and after looking at a few websites of other suggestions, I agreed.  It was easy to find from the L even for this out-of-towner. We were seated upstairs, and I would say the only drawback of the evening was the noise level. It was very hard to hear each other.  We started with drinks. I had their Limoncello Martini - Housemade Limoncello, Absolut Citron, Fresh Squeezed Mint Lemonade. I told the server I don't like fresh mint very much, so they used their plain lemonade instead and it was divine and got me just loopy enough. My husband tried the Orangecello Martini - Housemade Orangecello, Absolut Mandarin, Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice. The kids had flavored Italian sodas. DD2 chose the lemon, and DD1 said ""surprise me"" and they brought her Passionfruit - which was unique and lightly sweet. Very refreshing. They also accidentally made a root beer flavored one, and left it for us to share, which was creamy and sparkling. yum! For dinner the 7 of us shared 2 rounds of food, tapas style... Round 1: a cheese plate - Acadamia Barilla Pecorino Dolce Sardinian - Sheep's Milk, Butter, Honey, Semi-Hard served with a fruit/nut bread and persimmon spread. Who has persimmon spread?! We had Gnocchi -  house made Potato Dumplings, Green Beans, Potatoes, Arugula Pesto & Pork Stock. It was covered in pesto, very green but not too strong in flavor. Even my husband who abhors green beans picked around them and loved this. He probably could have asked them to leave the green beans off, but he didn't. I would have added more garlic. I hit was the Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo Tuscan - house made Pasta Ribbons which were light and delicate with Braised Beef Tomato Sauce. There were shreds of the beef in the sauce. The serve this with parmesan on top, which was not on the menu and my daughter does not like, so we asked for a 2nd order without parm, which they did gladly. They probably should just have parm on the table instead. Roasted Baby Octopus - Braised Escarole, Red Chili, & E.V.O.O. - my cousin knew to ask for little red chili, I guess she'd been burned before. I did not touch this, but my DD1 loved it! My husband added Crisp Calamari in Organic Tomato Sauce, but I only tried one piece of that. Not chewy at all. Round 2 included more the 2nd pasta ribbons without the parm, Asparagus Risotto - which was delicious but seemed like a very small portion. The texture and creaminess were delightful. Penne alla Vodka - Vodka, Tomatoes, Garlic, Red Chili, Basil, & Cream - YUM! and the Tortellini in Alfredo Sauce, Peas & we asked for the Prosciutto on a separate plate because not everyone would eat that.  The server was friendly and attentive, and waitstaff cleared small plates out of the way repeatedly. Water was served in a glass bottle on the table so we could refill easily. The bread on the table was boring, but I didn't eat it anyway because of all the great food. Plates come from the kitchen as they are ready, not all at once, but that is traditional tapas style, and then you know it is hot and fresh.  In the end we did not take advantage of the gelato, but had dessert elsewhere. They were able to split our check with 3 different amounts on 3 different credit cards without hesitation.  The view from our table was nice too!  It's kind of rustic decor, and the servers have jersey-style tops, so that keeps the tone casual, which is good since you have to scream into your neighbor's ear quite a bit. Like I said, that was the only drawback.  We also said it was my birthday, and I thought maybe a scoop of gelato with a candle would appear, but it did not.  We arrived with 4 and little by little ended up with a table of 7, and they seated us when we were 4, which Chicago does not often do. Originally the reservation was for 8 and we changed it to 6 that morning, and they accommodated that as well. My cousins also took advantage of the valet parking which was quick, but I don't know what it cost them. Here is the WEIRD part - in the ladies room by the sinks is a wall of glass block, which overlooks the mens room. I was in there and thought I saw a male restroom attendant, but my daughter swears when she was in there the attendant was gone and you were looking at the urinals while washing your hands, and a man on the other side looked at her in shock and turned a little away while still trying to ""keep his aim"".

The tomato sauce was so fresh and flavorful, the pasta was the perfect chewy texture, the ricotta was so light and fluffy..and most importantly, the basil wasn't overpowering! eek, droooolllll... 3. Braised Beef - The braised beef here was still tasty even though I was busting at the seams by this point. The beef was perfectly cooked..not dry or tough, just melt in your mouth pieces that just falls apart just a gentle jab with your fork..sigh. 4. Zeppoles - And of COURSE, we had to have dessert! My bestie was alllllllllll about this dessert from the time we sat down. Want the classiest donut ever?

We started with the fried calamari. It was hot and crispy. I liked that it wasn't greasy and the breading didn't come off. My only complaint was how stingy they were with the marinara dipping sauce. It was a tiny amount compared to the amount of calamari. At least it was warm.  Second course was linguine with white wine clam sauce. The noodles were perfectly al dente. The clams were plentiful. The sauce was well seasoned. This was our favorite dish of the night.  Our last course was the braised pork shank. Our server told us it was braised for nine hours. It fell off the bone and was super tender. It came on a bed of mashed potatoes. This dish would've been better if it was better seasoned, and if there were more potatoes and sauce on the plate. I'm always surprised when restaurants are skimpy on cheap ingredients such as potatoes and grits and rice.  Our server was friendly. He was training a newbie and we got the impression he was showing off for her. He kept saying how jealous he was of our meal, something he probably says to all of his tables.  Given how many Italian options there are, I probably wouldn't return here.",0.9949,0.794,0.178,0.028,0.5586438923395444

The cheese portion was pretty skimpy. In fact, I thought they had left it off on accident since I had requested they leave off hazelnuts as well due to a food allergy. But under some of the arugula, were little blobs of delicious ricotta.  The wine list was decent. I got a quartino to wash down my dinner and walked out satisfied without breaking the bank.

Of the 4 dishes, the only one that stood out was the risotto; the bruschetta and linguini were average, and the calamari was almost soggy, not crispy enough at all.

2013-04-05,4.0,"Quartino's is my go-to restaurant in the River North neighborhood. They're priced reasonably, have great dishes and the restaurant itself has a great interior. It's a comfortable atmosphere, always with a good amount of people and usually a old vintage movie playing on their tv screens. It's perfect for multiple occasions, a nice date with someone, a casual get-together, or a group outting. The bar section is quite nice too, although I haven't ventured over there yet, but their selection of alcohol is mainly wine with some beers, at least in the dining section. As for food, there are some great items and others just mediocre. Their pizzas are really delicious and so well-priced (at most $13 for a full custom-made pizza), and the pastas are equally as good. I recommend the Linguini with White Clam Sauce. Some of their appetizers, soups and salads don't have as much to say, they're not bad but not noteworthy. So I would definitely go with pizza or pasta. Their style of dining is Italian style so everything is supposedly shared (if you choose to do so) which is really nice when you have a group of people to share among.  I would highly recommend this place, it's got the right vibes and you can tell by how much business they get that they have earned their reputation in the area. On weekends and Fridays it gets packed, so I urge you to make reservations as early as you can or you will be waiting a while. Saturday is always busy, I called to make reservations on Thursday one time and they only had 5:30 or 9'oclock for dinner available for that Saturday already. Another thing I've done sometimes is ordered pizza that I can pick up without having to wait for a table, which if you call ahead only takes 20-30 minutes. Otherwise this is a perfect place to stop by for a meal on weekdays, when it's less busy, not much of a wait but still filled with people.

Personally, I don't particularly fancy dining in loud and cluttered restaurants. My dad and I had to yell at each other from across the table to hear what the other was saying.  The food, however, came out quick and it was delicious. We ordered the Fumo Negli Occhi (Smoked Provolone, Speck, & Baby Spinach) and Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo (Tuscan Pasta Ribbons with Braised Beef Tomato Sauce). The Fumo Negli Occhi is a form of pizza; it was made very thin, crunchy and extremely good.  I liked the touch of smoked provolone that they added into the pizza. The Papperdelle pasta was made perfectly and the braised beef gave it much flavor.  The pasta had a chewy texture to it; it was not too hard or too thick to eat.  Even though the food is delicious, I personally would not come here again for dinner.

I've been going to Quartino (there IS no 's in the name... But we are in Chicago, It isn't JEWEL, (the grocery store) it's Jewels) for about 7yrs now.  Is the FOOD that fantastic? Well... Depends upon what you get. Not everything is entirely consistent, but it doesn't suck either. This isn't ""Italian Tapas""... This is ENOTECA. Similar to tapas, and the Italians have just as long of a tradition in doing ""small plates dining"". The pizzas come in one size and yes... ONE person COULD knock it down. This is NOT ""pasta by the POUND with red-lead"" spaghetti joint and it isn't Chicago Style Pizza. I could get into a lecture as to how a REAL Italian (meaning, in Italy) meal would go and 99.9% won't believe me, because you keep going to places in ROME or VENICE where the menu is ALSO in ENGLISH. Pasta is a very ""small course"" in a coursed meal and one rule is: fish and cheese do NOT come together in the same meal either... Much less dish. On a pasta a-la vongole (clams in white sauce), DO NOT have cheese grated on it! In some instances, the food IS that fantastic. The house cured Duck Prosciutto (no, there is no ""H"" in spelling prosciutto) is AMAZING. You CAN have it on a pizza (which I highly recommend, Prosciutto D'Anitra... nom, nom, nom) as well as on it's own for Salumeria. Get over your hangups about chicken/duck. YES, you CAN CURED duck.  In Japan... I'd be down with chicken sashimi. And I trust Chef John Colleta.  Chef John is one of those guys whom you've NEVER HEARD OF... BUT, he HAS trained some of the guys whom you have/ are hearing about NOW and some of those guys... When their projects didn't go as well as they could have/ should have, go BACK to working for John Coletta. His boucherie/ salumeri/ bunch of cured meats & sausages with cheese on a board, is one the BEST in Chicago. His sauce Bolognese doesn't suck either. Most reading this, don't really know that Sauce Bolognese is a meat ragout (ragu) where the meats are TEMPERED/ braised in milk, then TOMATO. The Italians braise a LOT of meats in MILK. Chef John's is one of the better Ragu Bolognese I've had. Certainly here in the city of Chicago. And I love the house-made pasta. One of the more INTERESTING BARGAINS on the menu is: Veal Skirt Steak. THIS is my go-to dish. Sizable portion of protein, arugula and roasted tomato salad... Phenomenal. Steamed Clams in Pinot Grigio... Under $12? And that MUCH clam? Seriously? Where the place falters is... Some consistency. Over the winter, they were running Roasted Cauliflower and Brussels Sprouts. SO FRICKIN' GOOD! Seriously, lemon, garlic, chili flake and Olive Oil, roast and it was AWESOME.  Yet, the absolute WORST broccoli rabe. Kills me. And I LOVE these BITTER greens. Arugula! Kale! Brussels Sprouts! And their Rabe... as well as the sauteed spinach... Pathetic, overcooked and sitting in this watery bath of camouflage green. Worst. For sure a spot on the menu that fails me. Beef carpaccio ain't all that either. The grappa cured salmon was AWESOME and I wish they would bring that back. The seared tuna was really good too. Salads are very good as well as imaginative. Cesar has too much anchovy. Their version of Chippino/ Frutti De Mare... A friggin' BARGAIN. Considering that ""doing 1,000 covers (people)"" is a s l o w night... And how BIG the place is, This place keeps up some awfully good standards to the food. Maybe not ""Cheesecake Factory"" standards... But we aren't talking about ""Cheesecake Factory"" and you really don't want to know what I think of that as ""cuisine.""  I respect Cheesecake Factory as much as I respect Satan himself.  There are some SERIOUS BARGAINS on the wine list too.  There really IS a reason as to WHY I've been coming here for 7+yrs and yes, it helps that MOST of their menu is available until MUCH later than 99.9% of when restaurants are serving their FULL menu.  Overall, the food is solid and the staff is great. Service, be it; at the bar, in the bar or in the dining room... Everyone has always been great to me. The menu is BEST when you step out of comfort zone as well with going for seasonal dishes. Have some house cured or made salume or ""God's Feet"" cheese and live a little.",0.9991,0.766,0.184,0.05,0.47989694385216786

This place was perfect in my mind because I love Tapas and Italian Food. What a great idea to have small plates for Italian food. Bravo. Our team arrives here at 6 PM on a Thursday and we were still missing two folks. They told us that they would seat us once our party arrived which I did not mind and felt was fair. Finally the last two members joined the party and we were brought into the main dining room of the bustling restaurant. It is quite packed in here and there is not a whole lot of wiggle room as a warning to folks. Since it is in fact pretty packed, the noise level is on the loud side as well. The décor of the joint was inviting and casual which was reinforced by the tables placed closely together. It made it seem like one large family at a dinner table ready to consume a delicious meal. I was a fan of the ambiance. The service was also super friendly. The waiter was very knowledgeable over all of the food including what vino to order based on what type of vino we were looking for. They were attentive throughout the meal even though each waiter seemed to be waiting on multiple tables.  We ordered a ton of plates to share which included the veal meatballs, the Bolognese, penne ala vodka, the margherita pizza, and the parpadelle. Everything was delicious honestly. A solid joint and definitely hearty enough to share with folks. The penne alla vodka was one of my more favorites and the meatballs were great as well. I was worried that they would be a bit bland but they were flavorful so definitely a plus. Everyone loved the small plate experience as we were all able to try multiple different things without getting full quickly.

2013-03-02,2.0,"Holy over-rated Batman.  This is the 42nd review I've written today and, by far, the rating with which I'm most puzzled.  Its not bad, but it's certainly not good.  I'll agree that the concept of Italian tapas is somewhat novel, but really it just equates to getting a greater variety of mediocre food.  I have a theory that the majority of the positive reviews are from out-of-towners in awe of its novelty.  I base this on nothing more than its location and my incredulity towards its ranking. On an aside: I'd say that around 30% of the time, when I was trying to coordinate the location for a date with a girl I did not know very well and asked her where she wanted to go, the answer would be Quartino.  Let's just say, at the very least, a girl who responded with that answer was playing catch up for said date.",0.843,0.828,0.111,0.061,0.564009324009324

Gnocci is the best thing I have had on the menu and everything else is always pretty yummy as well. I am definately coming back even if my last experience wasn't perfect.",0.9678,0.651,0.262,0.088,0.5064102564102564

2013-02-28,4.0,"If tapas, and Italian food are your thing, I'd highly suggest Quartino as a spot in Chicago to come and try. What's great about tapas is that there's so much variety and the dishes are small. This offers a lot of food tasting, and is really great to socialize with. I came here with two of my other friends, and got seating right away because this spot is LARGE. There's a big first floor, and just as large second story. It's quite unbelieveable. Having such a vast menu, I would just suggest you not overly think about it, and just order what you think sounds good & have at it. That's the best way to do it! Foods don't come in any order. It's what ever is cooked and it just comes out. For example our sampler plate of meat and cheeses came last while the pasta and baked stuff came first. Odd, but not bad at all! Off our dinner adventure, I would recommend the following: 1) Eggplant Parmigiana - I'm enjoy eating eggplant, and when breaded, I love it even more! Rich with flavor. Excellent! 2) Steamed Clams - YES! Must get. Small clams, delicious in flavor. Rich! Save your bread and dip it in the juices. So much yum in a plate! 3) Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo - Pasta ribbons with braised beef in tomato sauce. As a pasta lover, this was devine. The braised beef was so soft. Very simple and well made. 4) Veal Meatball Slider - Different and good. Eat this when it comes out and don't wait on it because it will get cold! Other tidbits -- if you are a Neopolitan Pizza lover, this spot may also be for you! The options for their pizza's were pretty large, so I'm going to assume that this is their bread and butter on top of tapas actually. For a couple that comes in, this may be the way to go if tapas isn't your thing. Wine options galore. Middle of the road pricing in my opinion. Not cheap, but not too expensive. We had 6-7 dishes, myself a 1/2 Sangria, and my other friend 1/2 red wine, the total came out to $130 not including tip. $35-40/head ~ can't complain when the food is great!",0.9986,0.77,0.226,0.004,0.4704227405247813

I've only been to two Italian places that have made memorably delicious Italian food, and this is one of them. Everything we ordered made us say ""mmmm..."" The food was well seasoned, cooked to perfection and served in perfect proportions for one person to eat all him/herself or for at least 4 people to be able to share pretty fairly.

Food: Tapas style which is great for sharing and sampling multiple items without getting too full. I love all the pizzas but my favorites are the vegetarina and the melanzane. I am also a huge fan of the veal meatballs napoli and asparagus risotto. I honestly don't think you can go wrong with any of their dishes! Recently I have gotten hooked on the monthly wine bash event. The last Wednesday of every month for $20 you can drink as much wine and eat as many small plates as you want from 7-9 (It is quite a steal!!). I think it has been a great way to unwind with friends and coworkers during the week. Perfect excuse to go out on a Wednesday night, even in the middle of winter!

2013-02-25,5.0,"I love Quartino! It was a regular spot for my friend and I when we were living in Chicago, and when we're back in town Quartino will be our spot once again. We became quite fond of the bartender Erik, because he's friendly & personable, and great at his job - especially when it comes to pouring carafes of wine! The restaurant and bar is always super busy, so we always opted out of waiting for dining room service and sat where ever we wanted in the bar. That being said, the hostesses are all very beautiful so if you get to talk to them, the wait may not seem like such a bad option.  The food is great! Our go to dishes were the Beet Salad (yum!), Chilled Zucchini, or any of the awesome vegetarian pizza choices, which are gourmet style with creative topping combinations. For a Chicago restaurant, Quartino does offer quite a few options for vegetarians, (YAY!!) One time we ordered a pizza that already had several toppings on it and asked to have fresh arugula added. The pizza arrived shortly after with a huge pile of crispy arugula on top! They know what they're doing.  The service is fast! Each item takes about five minutes to arrive once you have ordered it. It makes the whole situation very simple as you can sit there drinking your wine and order as you please until you are full. I like that.  They always give you bread and oil before your meal and it's difficult not to dig in and eat a whole bunch - It's filling! They also top everything with a healthy dose of oil, which is nice to indulge in, but oil is fattening, and in my eyes is unnecessary in most cases. Lemon or lime juice is a much tastier, fresher, and healthier topping for salads! The price, service, food, wine, and atmosphere are all Excellent - Quartino is awesome!",0.988,0.841,0.138,0.021,0.5918982977806507

Like everyone has said, it's tapas style, which I normally don't think of when it comes to Italian food, but actually makes a lot of sense. Our waitress, Alysia was super helpful and fun and great and she really made our experience even better. She even gave us suggestions on where to go for the rest of our trip since we were visiting Chicago for the first time. One of my favorite parts of the restaurant was that it's open late. I love eating late and am on a super late schedule so it was so great to see something open late that serves really good food. We started with the white bean hummus (YUM), the dates (holy shit!) and the carpaccio (alright). The bread basket was placed down immediately after we were seated and olive oil & balsamic were already on the table, which I loved. We also got the braised beef papparadle which was phenomenal and the scallops which were equally as good. I was super happy with our dinner! Oh, and we spilt a very affordable bottle of wine, which makes any dinner better! ;) Things do come out when they are ready, which I kind of like, especially since we were warmed about this beforehand.

2013-02-23,5.0,"This restaurant, part of the Gibson group, has become my and my boyfriend's go-to date night place. It's easily accessible and really well priced and the food is fantastic. A dinner for two, with a shared dessert comes to around $35 with tip.  A couple of things should be noted: - Quartino's is a large restaurant and packs people in so at times it can be very loud, especially if you are seated near the bar area. Although I don't normally like sitting by the kitchen exit space, it is actually one of the quieter corners of the restaurant - They are known for ""family-style"" dining. This means that their dishes are meant to be shared by a group of people, each of whom takes what they want from a plate and passes it around. I personally don't like to share my food but have never experienced a problem with portion size. However, if you do find their portion to be small, it's cheap enough that you could order another entree easily.  - They are great for groups and for kids. They make really accessible Italian food - especially their entrees. Their apps are meat/dairy place centered, which isn't my thing.  A lot of people go here for bachelor/ette parties or after work, so their staff is used to accommodating large groups of people. The attire isn't casual per se, but suits aren't required. It has a comfortable elegance.  - For those that drink, they have an extensive wine and beverage list which looks fantastic. They also always have a crowded bar. Recommended dishes: Eggplant parmesan, pizza margherita, zeppoles with dark chocolate dipping sauce",0.9879,0.834,0.144,0.022,0.5816190476190478

The star I'm knocking off is mostly due to the wait: people were crammed like sardines in the waiting area and it was somewhat suffocating. Reading other reviews, this seems to be more of a norm than an exception. Despite the delay, once we were seated the overall experience was great. The waiter (can't remember his name but he looked like the pudgy guy from Grey's Anatomy, not that I watch that show) was very helpful and attentive. Pros: Cavatelli - simple-sounding pasta dish, but was oh so delicious.

I personally tried the sausage and tagliatelle bologese. The tagliatelle was mushy and the sauce a bit sweet, but the sausage was delish. This earned another star in my book.

Standouts were the sausages on the meat and cheese platter and the octopus was a big favorite at our table, too.  I also really liked the gnocchi.  We also ordered the zeppole for dessert - these were probably my most favorite item of all.  I mean, who can resist light, airy puffs of doughnut and chocolate for drizzling?  I would be of a mind to just order that for my whole meal next time.  Awesome stuff! There's valet if you think you want to drive and don't want to have to park, too. Overall, quite lovely and I would be glad to go back!",0.9973,0.739,0.261,0.0,0.5702906162464986

Bar was too crowded to catch a drink and I'm sure they serve full service on first come first serve seating there, but there was hardly any moving space.  I love how we could share everything. We started with two bottles of wine at the table that were listed as specials for 20 dollars each. We were offered to taste and we all drank out of regular style drink ware sets (they did not provide wine glasses).  Food, however, did come quickly! Which is always a plus and bread was served fresh and they brought in more complimentary.  Here is what we had and everything was delicious: -Veal Meatball Slider (one per person) for 2.25. Veal was excellent, no sauce was on it so that's  why it was not my favorite. It did come in a huge roll (which most of us didn't eat) because that's too filling.  -Romaine Hearts Salad, for 6.75, fresh, delicious, a great way to start the meal -We ordered many pasta dishes and they were all graciously served but my favorite was Cavatelli. That is what I would order If I went back. We were too full for dessert but the menu for it looked good. My girl friend is having 20 girls here for her birthday in April. I know they take large group reservations which is perfect because this would be a great way to save money on food with small dishes and for everyone's food tastes.  I like RPM better.

The reasons I love Quartino for groups - good food, cheap prices, the cheapest, drinkable wine in town and a rowdy table doesn't feel out of place, because it's so loud.  I would not go for a ""foodie"" meal, but it's great for a group. I've not been there in just over a year, but our experience was a bit disappointing. I'm hoping it's a blip on the radar and not the new typical. - 25 minute wait for our table, despite a reservation - 25 minutes is spent crammed in the first floor waiting area, they just have too many people there waiting and nowhere near enough waiting space for a restaurant that seats that many people (this place is HUGE) - Most rushed meal I've had in a long time - the small plates came out fast and furious, we were done within 50 minutes of sitting down.  Not really the sort of experience I was wanting.

Great place for groups.  House white and red wines are very drinkable and can be ordered by the half liter or liter.  Served in non-traditional wine glasses that can be used to play quarters at the table.  That was with another group, but it was quite classy, I assure you. Food!  And all of it for very reasonable prices. -Pappardelle - great pasta choice, though last night I found the noodles a bit more al dente than I'd like. -Penne ala vodka - another solid choice.  In fact, we got two orders of this. -Mushroom Risotto - we requested it with non-pork stock as a member of our group doesn't eat pork.  Still tasty. -Beef short ribs - um.. delicious delicious meat.  Tender, flavorful, can't go wrong. -Gnocchi - gnocchi really isn't my thing, but for gnocchi lovers, I'm sure this would suffice. -Polenta fries - piping hot!  No for reals, it's hot, but delicious.  So eat carefully. -Calamari - pretty standard.  Less breading than some places use so more flavor comes through. -Soprano pizza - political incorrectness on very well executed crust.  -Linguine with clams - white sauce, get it with the white sauce.  Tasty broth.  Lots of clams so hopefully you like those. -Zeppole - this was courtesy of our waiter for the aforementioned birthday.  We sang happy birthday loud enough to drown out the noise of quartino.  If you've ever been, you'd know that's loud.  That's how we roll.  These were good, but I prefer beignets.  I'm a diva. I've had lots of other stuff here too and it hardly ever disappoints.  The noise level is deafening, but works well for large rowdy parties.  We used it to play telephone. Probably wouldn't take a date here.  Unless you don't want to talk to your date, then it's a good strategic move.",0.998,0.707,0.255,0.038,0.49951984126984134

The food is Italian small plates or tapas.  We ordered the following: Polenta fries: crispy and delicious, really unique!  I wish they came with marinara sauce though instead of the red pepper sauce. Tortellini w/ alfredo sauce, peas and prosciutto: my partner loved this dish, he wants to come back for it!  Ravioli w/ braised pork and fava beans: this dish was delicious but a little saltier than it needed to be.  With the prosciutto and parm they don't need to add so much salt! Chicken: garlicky and delicious Calamari: fresh and well seasoned.  The portion was a bit too large for tapas though.  The best thing about our meal was our server.  I can't recall his name but he was really friendly and outgoing.  He explained the menu to us and even got me a free drink when they didn't have the one I wanted!  He went above and beyond and that is just a great feeling.   We weren't too thrilled to be going here on New Years since it seemed like any other Italian place (of which, Chicago has plenty!) but we were pleasantly surprised and will definitely be going back again!",0.9982,0.778,0.211,0.011,0.4693487671748541

I'm the type of person more interested in the food than the crowd and the food is just average. Nothing has ever been bad but nothing has been fantastic either. Last time we had the marrow, which was very good but they seemed to have taken that off the menu. This time I had the duck prosciutto pizza with arugula. The duck prosciutto is really good but there wasn't very much of it on the pizza. In my head I was expecting a white sauce and some cheese on it but maybe I didn't read the menu well enough because it was a red sauce, which just didn't work. It would be a great pizza if they put more imagination into it. As it was, it just tomato sauce on pizza dough with a bunch of arugula on top. My husband had linguini and clam sauce--pretty spicy--but not outstanding. One big negative besides the average food is that nothing comes out of the kitchen together. I know this is supposed to be family style but I personally think it's the mark of a weak kitchen staff that there is so much time in between dishes.

2012-12-23,4.0,"Highly recommended by Yelp and the hotel we were staying at, we made reservations on a Saturday night for a holiday dinner for the three of us.   We walked to Quartino and arrived about 30 minutes ahead of our reservation time, figuring we would have a drink at the bar.  Much to our delight, they cleared a table and seated us immediately.    Minutes later Aldo was at our table ready to serve.   First time here?  Yes.  Ever done small plate tapas style?  Nope.    No problem, says Aldo, I'll explain it to you.   He did a great job with suggestions and guiding us through the meal.   Service was prompt and friendly but not intrusive.    Nice job Aldo!   Thanks for making us feel comfortable. We started with some spicy salami, Asagio cheese and olives.   Comes with walnut bread, pickled veggies and apricot purée.  I liked the salami..it lived up to its spicy name.   The combo of walnut bread, cheese and apricot purée was delicious.  My wife was eating the apricot purée by the spoonful it was so tasty. My son chose the Cavatelli for one course and I got us the pork shank to share.  The pasta was good, not great.   Nice tomato flavor and cheesy. The pork shank was absolutely fantastic.   It is soaked in wine for like 9 hours and falls off the bone.  It is served over some super creamy mashed potatoes.   I'm still thinking about a forkful of the moist, flavored meat with hot mashed potatoes!   And for only $10! This was plenty of food for us.    Along with some cocktails total bill was about $80.   Very reasonable. We had a great time.   The restaurant is very loud, but I liked it.  A nice high energy vibe; celebratory.   Oh yeah, they also had ""A Christmas Story"" playing on the TV.   We laughed through dinner and mimed the lines.   ""You'll shoot your eye out!""  ""Bumpases"".",0.9971,0.74,0.226,0.034,0.6762068965517242
2012-12-18,4.0,"I was in Chicago over the weekend visiting family and this was the place we went for dinner on Saturday night. We had heard good things about it and decided to see for ourselves. First of all, make reservations. This place was packed. Even with reservations it still took a few minutes to seat four adults (and my young grandson), but that's OK. Crappy restaurants aren't crowded, so that's actually a good sign.  If you're driving, use the valet service. It isn't much, about 12 bucks and it was worth it. There's really no public parking around, especially during Christmas shopping season. Cab fare would have been higher and would have been a double expense to and from, we had the baby as well, so valet was the right choice for us. We were seated and met by Alyssia, our server. She immediately established that it was our first visit and explained how the tapas/small plate style worked. She went over the menu and took our drink orders. Within minutes, drinks were served. She even brought an extra wine glass in case I changed my mind (I rarely drink). Alyssia answered several questions about different dishes and once we decided, she was off and running.  First to arrive were the veal meatball sliders. Big hefty meatballs, I'd guess about 1 1/2 to 2 oz each, on small buns with pomodoro sauce and giardiniera. There was a cheese on there as well but I'm not sure what type, didn't ask. Veal was very tasty, could have used a little more seasoning for me, but it was very good still.  Within a few minutes, and the next dish was dates wrapped in pancetta, stuffed with Gorgonzola Dolce & drizzled with honey. Holy cow, that was wonderful. The sweet and the savory of the gorgonzola with the sweet of the honey and the pancetta just can't be described, you simply have to try it. Everyone loved them and we seriously thought about ordering more but there was so much more food coming, we reluctantly passed.  Next up was the Pappardelle al sugo di manzo, beef with pappardelle pasta in a tomato sauce. Very good and filling, little bit of heat on the back end. Just right for a chilly night. Next, the only low note of the evening. The rest of the group wanted a pizza, I wanted some veggies. We settled on Quattro Stagioni, a pizza with marinated artichokes, portobellos, roasted peppers, zucchini, and grana.  I had asked Alyssia if I could get some of the same veggies on the side for me, she said sure, no problem. Well, the kitchen goofed it up and put all the veggies on the side and none on the pizza, so we basically had a cheese pizza. Most of the food was being delivered by a different server each time, so when Alyssia came around and saw what had happened, she disappeared for a moment and when she returned, told us that she had taken care of it and taken the pizza off our bill. Now that's damn good service! Last up was gnocchi. I have to admit, I didn't try it; I was nearing my limit by this time. It's made with green beans, potatoes, arugula, pesto and pork stock; it's not your average gnocchi. But everyone else loved it.  Alyssia came around with the dessert menu. She let on that there was tiramisu that wasn't on the menu. I was trying to be good, my wife and I were going to split a dessert, a Panino al Gelato Limone, a lemon cream gelato sandwich with lemon curd, and whipped cream. The others had ordered a Nutella Panino, which is just what it sounds like, toasted panini with nutella.  What I had missed was a wink and a nudge between my wife and Alyssia, the next thing I know we had the lemon panino, the nutella panino and the tiramisu. To top it all off, Alyssia said that she'd seen how I had perked up at  the mention of tiramisu, even though she had already scrubbed the pizza, she wanted us to be completely happy, she comped all three desserts! Is that awesome or what?  Besides being a top notch server, hustling back and forth all evening as well as waiting several other tables, Alyssia really knocked it out of the park that night. Friendly, cheerful, and absolutely has the diners interest at heart, she made the night for us. My son picked up the tab for the meal and was certainly generous to Alyssia for her service and I gave her a little extra on the side as well. She certainly earned it; we also gave her an attaboy with her manager before leaving. I hope they darn well appreciate what they have in her.  Overall, the food was outstanding. Everything was nicely done, the veal was moist and a good starting point, the pancetta dates were killer; the pappardelle was delicious, little hiccup on the pizza and veggies but it was saved by outstanding service. BTW, the veggies were great, should have got more of those as well. Gnocchi was super by all accounts. I can personally attest to to the tiramisu and the lemon panino as being worth the trip all by themselves.  A wonderful meal and service that can't be beat anywhere. Very much looking forward to returning.",0.9992,0.789,0.171,0.04,0.4735924101441342
2012-12-16,4.0,"I had many visits but only now reviewing. I know, such a Yelp cliche but whatever. There are so many reviews but here is my short (hopefully) but to the point review. + Good for groups. I've been here for alumni functions usually held upstairs. This past summer I hosted a group of 10 ladies for a bachelorette party dinner. I looked into getting a private room for us (through private events section of website), but due to keeping costs down, ended up with reserving a table in the dining area. It actually worked out since the party attendance wasn't as big as expected. Actually, that same night, I think we saw about three or four other tables with bachelorette party people.  + Even though portions are small (think tapas style), I always leave like I ate one big meal. My parents were in town for Thanksgiving. My dad liked the idea of small dishes because he thinks he's gaining a belly. Whatever, dad. He liked it so much we came back...three freakin' times in a week. In our defense, we didn't order the same dishes each time. The favorites though were the shrimp risotto, polenta fries (my personal fave), the not so spicy salami (name escapes me), and fried calamari. If you don't like loud places or sit somewhat too close to the next table, this might not be for you. Otherwise, it's not a bad option to take out-of-towners and/or need a place for a group function. You can make reservations via Open Table. I highly recommend reserving a table because it does get really crowded, even on the most random weeknight.",0.993,0.832,0.163,0.005,0.39251633986928103

Their chocolate fondue is one of the best I've ever had in my life. Super delicious. I just came back here earlier this week with a friend and the wild arugula salad was just okay. I was debating between getting a sangria or moscato for dessert and then ended up getting a moscato. Biggest moscato ever! I loved it.

2012-12-12,5.0,"I had the pleasure of visiting Quartino for the first time while visiting Chicago for work just last week. I live in Pittsburgh and have literally thought about this restaurant every day since my return a week ago. So where do I begin.... My co-workers and I were looking for a great restaurant for dinner after we had spent the day traveling and working. Those of us who still had battery life on our iPhones were searching away on Yelp and Urbanspoon, trying to find a great spot for dinner. The first place that we found was small and had a 1-2 hour wait, so we decided to find another place. We were exhausted and starving when we finally stumbled into Quartino. It was a Monday night, and the restaurant was pretty deserted. We were quickly seated on the upstairs balcony. (Yes, we were lucky enough to be in Chicago when it was 68 degrees in December!) They tried to seat all five of us at a tiny table, but I asked if we could push two tables together to have more room. I think the staff anticipated that we would just order a small glass of wine and tiny appetizer to share... but they had no idea of the appetite we had worked up all day. We were ready for some serious ordering and table filling. Service was prompt and polite. The waiter presented our wine in a very formal manner, which I thought was interesting -- and a little awkward. However, once I began to eat, the food was so delicious that I entered an Italian food coma, ignoring all that was going on around me, including the fact that I didn't realize the balcony was completely filled until we left at 7:30pm. The great thing about trying new restaurants with a group is that you get to try so many different things! We tried -- Margherita Pizza, Salumeria Tasting, White Bean & Garlic Spread, Caprese Salad, Gnocchi, Cavatelli, Tagliatelle alla Bolognese, Tortellini, Penne alla Vodka, and Beef Short Ribs. All of our dishes were at least good while many dishes ranked in the excellent-and-still-dreaming-about-it-a-week-later category. I highly recommend ordering pasta here. Every pasta that came out seemed to top the previous. The Cavatelli in particular was a table favorite. As a pasta lover, my love of pasta is why I'm dreaming of returning in the future. I was disappointed in the Margherita Pizza -- it was a bit cold and bland -- but was told later by friends that the poor pizza quality is more of an exception than the rule. Apparently, they normally have fantastic pizza. I'll have to order a different type next time! Most importantly, I can't forget the wine! My table ordered a bottle of red and a carafe of white and only spent about $50 or $60 for both. And finally, the total bill... this will blow your mind...... 10 Dinner Items, ranging from Salad to Pasta and Meat + 1 Bottle of Wine and 1 1/2 Liter of Wine = $200 Wow. Not sure how that's possible... we were delightfully surprised that we walked away completely stuffed from a tapas restaurant and only spent $40 each. And all of the above is the reason why I will be dreaming of this restaurant until I return sometime in 2013.",0.997,0.82,0.144,0.036,0.5322930695847362

The service was pretty bad too. The servers were rude and talked back under their tongue. They did not ask to take our orders (we had to call them over after a long wait) and, when they did, they did not do it in any kind of coordinated way (we had two servers).  The food was horrible as well. This place doesn't know what it wants to be. Is  it tapas? But you can order fettuccine Alfredo and pizzas? The gnocchi is the worst I ever had (but, to be honest, one person of the four at my table who tried it liked it). I got some sliced beef which was okay, at least. Everyone was pretty much disappointed with what they got. I finished with the lemon desert and it had no lemon flavor at all. It tasted like vanilla. And it was loud! Forget about trying to have any kind of conversation. When we got outside everyone went ""ahhhh"" because we forgot was normal hearing felt like.

Loved the casual experience, but I've had better Italian food in the city. (Disclaimer - I'd probably give this place closer to 3.5 stars if possible.) We went for broke and ordered the following - *1/2 liter of the red wine sangria: Sweet but would have liked stronger. *Dates with Gorgonzola and pancetta: Could have been plumper with more creamy cheese but I adored the sweet honey drizzled on top to balance the saltiness of the meat. *Baby spinach, pear, walnut and ricotta salad: I love fruit-nut-cheese combos but this one was lacking in the cheese. Pears were at least naturally sweet from being ripe, and the simple olive oil-lemon dressing really made the dish light. *Prosciutto D'Anitra pizza: Would have appreciated a thinner crust with more char on it (ie. brick oven/wood fired crust.) Arugula was a perfect spicy accent to the sweetness of the caramelized onions. *Gnocchi: Wished it was more pillow-like in texture rather than tough. Pesto tasted incredibly fresh and bright though, and the green beans were an interesting choice. *Beef fillets: Fav dish of the night because they were cooked perfectly at medium rare. *Fondue: Can't go wrong with a bowl of melted dark chocolate and sweet ripened strawberries. We polished this off quickly though, and honestly had SO much chocolate left that we ended up just eating forkfuls of this for a while. Overall what we enjoyed- *Smaller portions of family-style Italian plates kind of like tapas = HUGE variety *Affordable dinner for the quantity and differing types of food *Warm and inviting, with food prep such as cutting bread and slicing meat out in the open to view *Ultra fresh ingredients with made-to-order dishes brought out immediately Other minor overall gripes- *Would have loved readily available parm with the olive oil on the table *Warmed up bread is better than cold that sits out all dinner",0.9987,0.699,0.273,0.029,0.5452168367346937

2012-11-20,5.0,"Not that Quartino needs more kudos, but after several visits here since its opening, I just cannot help but sing its praises. My experiences here have included meeting friends for drinks and eats at the bar, a fabulous Yelp event, and a recent solo stop at the bar. Quartino is the perfect place to come for a little buzz , some noshes and a convivial atmosphere. So heads up all you lonely out-of-towners in the surrounding hotels. They bill the place as one where wine costs about as much as water. And they're not kidding. Wine comes in a 1/4, 1/2, or full carafe. The choices are extensive but not mind-boggling, and the menu divvies up the wine such as whites into lighter, medium or heavier choices, which is very helpful. Wine glasses are the small European bistro types, so you get 2-3 of these out of a 1/4 carafe. Well, that just feels like a deal, for $10.00, which was the cost of my Ferrari-Carrano Fume Blanc.  I added to the delectable wine choice a couple of veal meatballs sliders, an order of grilled rolled zucchini with sun-dried tomato and marinara. I woke up thinking about those!  They were a perfect example of the exquisite flavor pairings accomplished here, even in the smallest dish. Ribbon-thin slices of zucchini were wrapped around meaty strips of sun-dried tomato, then lightly grilled. The sliders were accompanied with a chopped and pickled vegetable slaw, similar to the Latin Escabeche. Perfect contrast the the creamy veal meatballs. Although I've not visited all of the small-plate, tapas places or enotecas in the city, Quartino is by far my first choice for this style of eating and drinking. The pizzas are simple and exquisite. The pastas you can order in half-orders, which is how they'd be eaten in Europe anyway. And the vegetarian dishes are worthy of a ""No Vegan Left Behind"" award. There is always something new to try here. The joint seems to be staffed with college kids, but that may be a point of view thing, since anyone under the age of 30, to me, looks like a college kid. But what a great bunch of kids. They all bring and energy and enthusiasm that you can't help taking with you on your way out.

We told the waitress we had only 40 minutes to eat, she said she was going to rush our order and she did, we got our risotto and salmon in no time. Everything was delicious.  They had, however, a hostess that kept walking around the restaurant wearing the shortest, tightest dress I have ever seen. Seriously, her dress was so short that if it was an inch shorter it would show her butt. I thought that was totally unnecessary and not at all elegant. There were plenty of families with kids there, innapropriate does not begin to describe. You can be well dressed without showing your ""assets"". After all, this is not a night club as far as I know.  The other 2 hostesses were very elegant, I have to add. Anyways, will be visiting again for the service and food, however, I would be really a mood killer for me to see that hostess barely dressed again.",-0.8801,0.863,0.041,0.096,0.6731150793650794

Usually I stuff myself with favorites before remembering to try something new, and the endless yummy bread definitely doesn't help. Seriously, they are very attentive about replenishing my bread supply, and it's just so hard to resist munching on it while waiting for food.  Two plates of clams in wine sauce, which is actually a big bowl of clams instead of y'know... veggies on the bottom and a layer of like 10 clams on top. Always get this. Asparagus risotto -  was really homey and comforting, with just a hint of asparagus flavor that demands attention to its presence but isn't close to being overpowering Gnocchi - a bit too heavy for us and we barely ate the plate between the 2 of us. Pancetta wrapped dates - I remember enjoying it, but it wasn't so memorable that I still remember exactly what it tastes like still Veal meatballs - the meatballs themselves were good, but something in the sauce or garnish stuck out very strongly and had a pungent flavor I personally didn't enjoy Braised pork shank - unluckily got this at the end of a meal so it became too heavy at that point but will definitely try this again at some point earlier on Once we actually saved room for dessert! Tried tiramisu - really dark and rich but not super heavy that we couldn't finish. But I'm not picky about my tiramisu. Marrow - very greasy and didn't get much out of it. I remember loving bone marrow as a kid, but this was so fatty I barely touched it. There were a few other things I've had but just don't remember. Always have a good experience here. Some of the plates aren't good, but I know more and more which are favorites and the menu is huge so there is always something new to try!",0.9961,0.763,0.197,0.04,0.4754923091093304

The garlic flavor was powerful but not to the point of where we could not taste the great dishes to come. My favorite vegetable dish we ordered  was the Roasted Beets. They were perfectly cooked and the amount of cheese and nuts did not take away for the star itself. My dates top two dishes were the Stuffed Dates and the Stefano Pizza.  Our liter of wine that we enjoyed with the meal was good but extremely over priced. Our finale however ""took the cake"" of the meal! (Pun intended...hehe) We ordered the Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream and.....LOVED IT! Perfectly cooked so that the entire cake, including the sides sitting against the ceramic bowl, were moist and rich. The only issue here was that we like an even ratio of ice cream to cake, so we asked for a second scoop, they charged us $3.50 with out telling us ahead of time. And let me tell you... anyone could get DOUBLE the amount of ice cream at a premium parlor compared to the amount we received.  The staff was friendly, though we didn't see our server too often. We might have ordered more had the case been otherwise. Another thing to note is that their portions for their prices left more to be desired. The meal ended up being more expensive than expected.

Quartino, you hold a special place in my heart as our last dinner as a childless-couple was with you (I went into labour with our daughter the same night). Tips: The pizza is great. You can get 1/2 portions of most things. Do it. The risotto is amazing. Duck prosciutto is pretty gross. The real prosciutto is awesome. The patio is great in the summer.  It gets busy on weekends. Come expecting some noise. They're great for parties, and very accommodating with children. There's an off-menu tiramisu. Which inspired me to start making tiramisu. And I think mine's better (bias) but theirs is pretty great too. Also, if you're driving, you might as well use valet. It's like $11, whereas if you park it's $5 per hour. If you can find a spot. We keep forgetting this fact. Once, they accidentally used cinnamon instead of cocoa powder on our tiramisu. It was pretty hilarious in hindsight. The management was great to us. They used to recognize us... But not anymore :( I guess we just don't go as often now that we've got a baby to care for. A few things... I'd love if they switched up the menu once in a while, or offered a special. I think we've tried everything and have gotten a bit bored. Also, the summer service/food/staff is worse than in the winter. Not sure why, but after 2 years of coming here, it's definitely something I've noticed.",0.9963,0.711,0.25,0.039,0.6266694033935414

2012-11-10,4.0,"Another successful day and night of Lollapalooza, Minh and I were just downright hungry, tired, and just wanted something on the lighter side. Tapas sounded like a good choice but we did not know where to go. Walking around we stumbled upon this place. At first glance, you would think this is an upper snobby restaurant.  Walking in and looking around you realize that it isn't like that at all, there are people at the bar, sitting outside on the patio and dining inside in casual clothing. As for myself I could have dressed a tiny bit better for the place (I was in full concert mode; shorts, flip flops, t-shirt with a bikini top under) and I probably looked like hell too from being in the sun and humid conditions. The hostess was nice and asked where we would like to be seated since the restaurant was only half-full at 11:30pm. We said the back booth would work for us. Our server was a little too overjoyed at serving us and knowing we just came from Lollapalooza and that we were yelpers. He went into a full conversation about how he was just starting out in his quest on being a foodie. Congrats, buddy!!  Their menu has a lot to offer and we were told that everything is to be shared. We kicked things off with ordering: Caprese Salad: Mozzarella, Roma Tomatoes, Fresh Basil, & Aged Balsamic Syrup (I love caprese salads; if they are made right then they are tasty. I really liked the chucks of mozzarella they put in.  The balsamic gave it that sweet yet bitter taste. Veal Skirt Steak: Wild Arugula, Roasted Grape Tomatoes & Balsamic Syrup (This was an interesting dish for me, as I have never had much raw food before, but the bites I did have were really good, so good in fact I would order this again. Paparazzi Pizza: Chicken, Grilled Zucchini, Cheese Fonduta, & Thyme (Thin and crispy pizza, I liked the amount of chicken and zucchini they give you. The cheese is melted and perfect! And for dessert: Fantasia Coppa di Frutta: Raspberry, Orange & Lemon Sorbetti, Biscotti, & Seasonal Fruits....  (This dessert was one of the lightest I have had, it's a must try when you are here) After you are done with your meal, you have to check out their restrooms (located upstairs) not only is it art deco design (like the place is) but they also have scented powered soap too! I was a little surprised to see that it was still being made! I had to stop myself from putting more in my hand and making it into a paste.

After being sat outside on the 2nd story patio (great spot), and seeing how incredibly busy they all were, I was not expecting phenomenal service, to be honest.  I was quite wrong, and I will happily admit it.  Every server - from the water guy, the kitchen guy who brought out a dish, and the main server - were all very kind, knowledgeable about their trade, and amiable to be around. Skip the bread they bring at the start - this is not (or was not on the evening I was there) their forte at all, and it is worth saving belly room for all of their delicious food. Fun wine list; a good list of unique Italian wines that pair very well with the food.  Armando recommended Aglianico del Vulture (Angels of the Volcano), which I very much enjoyed.  Adore that you can order wine by the  Liter,  1/2 or full, or a traditional bottle.  Fantastic! I swapped 2 of the homemade pasta dishes, after Armando mentioned this was completely normal.  Cavatelli being my favourite pasta, and I really wanted to try their Sugo, we made it happen, and it was delicious!  AND, they easily make  1/2 portions of the pasta dishes (4 oz. vs. 8 oz) - perfect! Also ordered the spinach salad which was excellent in its simplicity. Great macchiato to end the evening.  I would have loved to eat at least 4 more dishes, but there was absolutely no way I had room to do so. The silly part?

It's very spacious and there are tables everywhere. This place can accommodate large parties easily. We got seated in the back with the TV right above us. Cool air blowing down on us. Even though there are many people here, each table feels very private. They serve Italian dishes. But not giant family style plates that serve 4 people. They're smaller dishes meant to pass around and share with everyone. Almost like an Italian tapas style. They also have pizza and gluten free choices. Our dishes: Caprese - A salad dish consisting of MOZZARELLA, ROMA TOMATOES, FRESH BASIL & AGED BALSAMIC SYRUP. This dish was quite refreshing and a good starter for the night. Angus Beef Carpaccio - The raw beef was seasoned with celery and other spices. It was chilled well and tasted very flavorful. Carpaccio just the way I like it.  Paparazzi Pizza - Pizza topped with CHICKEN, GRILLED ZUCCHINI & THYME. It was above average pizza. Nothing too fantastic but nothing to complain about either. Fantasia Coppa di Frutta  - Raspberry, Orange & Lemon Sorbetti, Biscotti, & Seasonal Fruits. Dessert was top notch. I loved this awesome cup of sorbetti and fruits. Service was very good. Server was maybe too attentive. Restrooms are upstairs and they use powered hand soap. Now that's old school.",0.9912,0.824,0.166,0.01,0.5000130094772952

We had an heirloom tomato salad with arugula: very generous in size, especially for two people! We also ordered broccoli rabe with red chili, onion, garlic and EVOO: a solid vegetable choice, as well as the asparagus risotto...which was the favorite dish of our meal. So creamy and the asparagus flavor really shined through. We also couldn't resist ordering a half order of zeppoles for dessert (with chocolate dipping sauce). Can you ever go wrong with fried dough, powdered sugar, and chocolate? I don't think so. Yum.

I first went here last year- I was a bit cautious as the idea of Italian tapas wasn't too exciting. We ordered a few different items and I fell in love. Every dish was better than the next.  I went again in Nov after freezing on the architecture tour of the city. We ordered the tomato soup and immediately warmed up. It was the best soup ever..more like a stew with chunks of tomatoes. I compared it more to a marina sauce and mopped up the soup with the bread they served. By far one of the best things I have ever had. We ordered a few more items to share and we left. Another great item is the polenta fries. One member of our party left her purse and one of the busboys chased us down to hand her the purse. He literally ran out, no jacket or anything. We were flabbergasted that someone would do this and not just wait for us to turn around and come back.  I went again earlier this year and had more yummy food. I was ""fighting"" with members of my party for the check and her place setting touched the flame in the candle. We started freaking out and immediately someone ran to our table and took care of it. Even though it was the end of our meal, and we had our check, they were nice enough to bring out another setting for her.

2012-09-24,3.0,"The best thing this restaurant offers is the Vino. Mmmm. Came here on a Sunday starving with two friends of mine post Football Sunday Funday.  Got a table on the upstairs terrace which was nice, but very crowded at the small tables. The bread that was brought to our table was a little stale but we ate it anyways.  The highlight of my meal was the $2.25 veal meatball slider I ate... Holy shit this was delicious. It was on some kind of ciabatta bread I think and it was just oh so yummy.  That was appetizer one... We all sampled on of those delicious little minis. Then it was time to sample some salads. Quartino's spinach salad came with walnuts which sells me right away. Anything spinach/walnut related for a salad and I'm in.  The only thing that was not thrilling about this salad was that there was SO much dressing.  Not that it was bad tasting dressing, but it was just an excessive amount of dressing. Ask for it on the side. The little tomato salad that we all shared was good too. Just baby heirloom tomatoes. Nothing too extravagant. Would be really good with a balsamic reduction glaze. That would make the salad perfecto. Next course was some pasta.  We got penne alle vodka and spaghetti alle vongole (clams).  The spaghetti was SPICY so if you are not a fan of spice, beware. Luckily for me I'm a red pepper and sriracha junkie so nothing can surprise my capsacin receptors. Nope. The spaghetti with clams wasn't very flavorful minus the spicyness so that was unfortunate. The penne alle vodka was good but it was served to us with some undercooked noodles. Not so yummy. I'm all about that al dente noodle, but when it's well undercooked from al dente.. meh. Ruins the pasta. The service was pretty decent, but our server forgot our lemons for the pasta, to bring us bread, refill the drinks, etc etc.  Took us forever to get the wine too. I gave Quartino's three stars not because their food isn't great, but because I'm a food snob and after having lived in Europe for 12 years, I can't help it.

I think maybe we were both spoiled by amazing Italian restaurants (Spiaggia, Cafe Spiaggia, Davanti Enoteca, or any restaurant on Taylor street), we just didn't think Quartino was a 4-star rated restaurant on Yelp.  Here's what we ordered:  - Veal meatball slider: gosh the meat was dry. If it were not for the sauce and the fact I was really hungry, I don't think I could've managed to swallow it.  -Dates wrapped in pancetta: average. But it wasn't too hot, tasted like the plate had been waiting at the kitchen to be picked up for at least 15 minutes.  -Gnocchi: salty, salty, salty. One note, too salty.  -Tagliatelle: the meat sauce was good, but after couple of bites, it went back to the salty taste.  -Linguini with clam: the clams tasted fresh, the red sauce on the other hand, was very watery, and ha, salty!  -Steamed clam: I know, two dishes with clams, but the in-laws said clams are good for liver after heavy drinking...No need to say, it's kinda salty.  -Roasted baby octopus: the octopus was cooked very well, but for a $11 plate, there were only four tiny pieces on it. I was unhappy.  -Italian donuts: after a very salty meal, I was glad to have something sweet. The donuts were fluffy, melt in your mouth, and dipped in honey and chocolate sauce was the best combo!

2012-09-07,4.0,"We came here for an early dinner on a Friday. I made a reservation using Yelp and it couldn't have been a smoother process. We were seated right away which is a plus. I was looking forward to sitting on their 2nd floor outdoor balcony, but sadly it was closed that afternoon (not sure why...). Our table was technically inside, but had an outdoor feeling due to the big windows. It was nice having a great view of the city streets without feeling claustrophobic from pedestrians.  Our waiter was the best! Mike was super attentive and very knowledgeable on the menu and the wine list. I was struggling between which wine to get and he brought me a sample of each and let me pick based on the taste. It was strange drinking the wine out of a small glass cup, but it was tasty so no complaints there. The food was good. We started off with the Gorgonzola cheese plate appetizer that comes with a side choice of grapes in olive oil, apricot puree, or fennel salad. When our plate arrived, we were given all three sides to sample with the cheese. Apricot puree was so delicious and the perfect complement with the creamy cheese slices. For the entrees, we split braised pork ravioli and the rigatoni with chicken, cream, and broccoli.This was my first time at an Italian tapas restaurant and the portions were perfect for sharing. We left with full bellies and no leftovers, it was too hard to put the forks down.  Coppa al Banana dessert - I'll see you next time .",0.9869,0.76,0.167,0.074,0.49600529100529106
2012-09-07,4.0,"After walking 60 miles in Chicago for the Komen 3-Day, all I wanted to do was freaking EAT. The average 3-Day walker burns 6,000 calories...I'm pretty sure dessert alone accounted for my replenished caloric intake, but that's neither here nor there. When taking care of reservations for myself and my traveling entourage, I was faced with a number of challenges. First, had to find a place that was condusive to the budget of a friend who had recently lost her job...second, there was a vegan on this trip. Now, the restaurants that I had bookmarked did not exactly cater to the needs of my friends and given that I wanted them at the event for the support thought it necessary to accomodate and so I took the question to the Chicago Yelp threads where of course I was met by haters wondering why I hadn't just used the search function. On the flip side of the mild elite harrassment, one kind soul suggested Quartino and that my search could end there. So it was written and so it was done, reservation made days before our trip, and we were good to go. The restaurant itself reminded me a bit of an Italian version of Parc in Philadelphia, not over the top. Our waiter was great, explaining that the menu was tapas style and that plates were meant for sharing but could easily be ordered individually. Next you know we're ordering every type of cheese on the menu, pastas, salads, the works. The idea of budget went straight out the window when we started ordering wine. Dinner came and went, I ordered the octopus only to find that they had already sold out for the evening and so my order instead went to pancetta wrapped gorgonzola stuffed dates drizzled with honey; simply stellar. Shortly following was a pork belly and an heirloom apple compote. My meal? So well ordered that I ended up sharing with all my friends even though they had dishes of their own. Dessert was a meal of it's own. 5 desserts for 6 people all containing chocolate....that 6,000 calories I mentioned? All consumed in sweets, but it was so well worth it. The entire meal was a hit amongst my friends, definitely a great place if you're not looking to spend major coin in Chicago but will still get you a solid meal in a great downtown setting.",0.9976,0.775,0.197,0.028,0.5474279835390946

With 4 stars and over 1400 Yelp reviews, I expected something fantastic but what I got was a mish mash of poorly crafted tapas that were mediocre at best in a loud, crowded, and poorly decorated space. I came with a friend on a Friday night so it was understandably crowded. We shared some duck prosciutto, scallops, gnocchi, and the Stefano pizza (white pizza /w basil & sausage). The prosciutto was nothing special and a bit pungent, scallops were under-seasoned, and the gnocchi was bland. The only decent eat was the pizza which was done with a nice crispy crust and topped with some delicious spicy sausage and basil. Even that, however, only stood out because of the mediocre backdrop. In short, Quartino tries to serve up refined Italian small plates in a happy hour setting but the high prices and disappointing food make it a total miss.",0.9708,0.779,0.162,0.059,0.6567261904761904

My favorite thing about Quartino is the fact that they sell their wine in a variety of serving sizes - the standard 750 ml bottle, 1/2 liter, or a full liter carafe.  This is the type of place you visit to have a few glasses of wine and enjoy your evening, and somehow drinking wine from a carafe only enhances the enjoyment.  They also offer 2-3 Wine of the Month bottles that are $20 each and make great table wines for big parties. Quartino's menu is designed to be shared and they have a great variety of pizzas, salads, risottos, and other small plates.  The bigger your group, the more opportunity to try a feast of flavors.  The shrimp small plate is delightfully full of garlic and a little hint of chili pepper.  The shrimp risotto is one of my favorite options; cooked perfectly and the sun dried tomatoes add a nice texture contrast.  The asparagus risotto is a great option for asparagus fans (make sure you love asparagus before ordering this), and very tasty.  The pizzas are served Neopolitan style and while I wouldn't say the pizza is extraordinary, they always taste fresh and homemade. This is one of the few restaurants in Chicago that I have no problem going back to again and again because of the always fun atmosphere, the dependable and sharable food, and the free flowing wine.  If you're looking for a quiet night out or a mind-blowing culinary experience, Quartino is not for you.  But if you're looking for a great time with friends or family, friendly service, and yummy and hearty food, Quartino is a perfect choice.",0.9982,0.737,0.25,0.013,0.5542874396135267

The first dish we got was the fondue, and it was the best I have ever had. I really just wanted to forgo all our other orders, and just eat that all night. But everything else was delicious too.

2012-09-04,3.0,"You gotta love Quartino for the patio seating, overlooking State Street. Oh, and for the cheap wines measured by fractions of a litre.  I enjoyed the casual ambiance and European feel of the space, down to the tiny tables and glasses. As far as the food and wine goes though, all I can say is that I've had much better Italian. Everything is served tapas style here, or small plates meant to be shared according to our server. Prices are quite affordable as well, definitely much cheaper than most other restaurants in the neighborhood. The bf and I had the white bean & garlic bread (per my request), polenta fries (per his request), sicilian eggplant caponata, and shrimp with garlic, chili and lemon. I liked the caponata as I do most well marinated, acidic eggplant caponatas, but found it to be a tad oily after a few bites. The white bean spread was pretty good as well, creamy and relatively light with just a drizzle of olive oil, but could have benefited from a little salt. However I did like the nicely grilled filone toast served with the white bean spread, much better than the complimentary stale bread given to us before our meal. The shrimp dish teetered on the small side, but was probably the most successful dish we had in terms of flavor and execution; the large shrimps were cooked nicely, and the sauce of garlic, lemon, olive oil, pinot grigio and chili was simple but very good. The polenta fries failed to impress me, as I found it to be way too dense and almost tough. I also found the red pepper salsa dipping sauce on the side to be strange - almost reminiscent of a sweet & sour sauce served at Chinese takeout joints. The bf, being the crazy polenta feign that he is, liked the polenta fries for the most part, but had to sprinkle salt over it himself. Overall it seems like Quartino underseasons their food across the board, which is pretty unexpected from an Italian restaurant if you ask me. Besides the just so-so food, I wish that I could speak more highly of their well-priced wines. Unfortunately though, I think the quality of the white wine we had kind of reflects the low price tag. Perhaps I shouldn't have experimented with ordering a chardonnay/pinot grigio blend, but it really just tasted kind of sour and cheap to me. That said, I still think Quartino is still a pretty good place if you're around Magnificent Mile and want a relaxing, no-fuss place to grab a light bite.

I came with a group of ten a few nights ago, and we sampled many different plates from the menu.  Overall, I was very disappointed in the quality of the food that came out of the kitchen.  Flavor was lacking in a big, big way, and it seemed to stem from a severe lack of seasoning.  A little salt and pepper could have done wonders.  Man, it was shocking how bland most of the food was. The worst dish of all was the pancetta wrapped dates.  This was not a problem of underseasoning--this was just plain horrible food.  The dates were incredibly small, and the seed inside was not removed prior to cooking.  The pancetta on the outside looked like the leftover scraps from some other meal.  I have had pancetta wrapped dates many times before and have even made them myself...these were bad.  Really bad.  Shame on the kitchen for putting these out. We moved on and got the veal meatballs, gnocchi, beef short ribs and orecchiette.  The general consensus around the table was that each of these were disappointing.  It's not like they were inedible, they just tasted completely blah.  It really was shocking how bland they were. The bright spot in the night was the sausage pizza and the torta al cioccolato we had for dessert.  The torta had a vey rich, smooth chocolate flavor, and to be honest, is one of the best chocolate desserts I've had in Chicago. The service was ok but not stunning.  The decor is, in my opinion, homey and comforting--I really like it.  It's a really nice space.

Pieces of delicately sliced duck prosciutto were scattered across and baked to perfection. If you like bacon, you would like duck prosciutto. The onions were there but barely noticeable. That's a plus for me! I usually try to avoid dishes drowned in onions. The wild arugula put the whole pizza in camouflage but they were very fresh and crisp!  We also ordered the crisp calamari and linguini with clams, red chili, and red sauce. The calamari was seasoned with black pepper just the way I like it! It was superb when sprinkled in lemon juice and dipped in a side of marinara sauce. The linguini had a generous share of baby clams. The shreds of red chili were very welcoming and not a bit spicy.

After scouring yelp for restaurant advice my friends and I settled on Quartino because when we passed by the place during the lunch rush the dishes looked beyond fabulous.  We ordered the farmhouse chicken, beef tips, fettuccini alfredo, steamed clams and a pizza bianco. And of course a bottle of wine.  A warning when you look at the prices that they seem too good to be true. Do not expect entree sized portions. Albeit these dishes are meant for sharing it is the ordering in numbers that gets you a taste of the palate that Quartino has to offer. I find that I usually prefer it that  way because then I get a taste of everything. Everything we ordered was ridiculously good. The chicken was soft and succulent, the beef had deep notes of red wine, and the clams were so good we ordered Them again when we were stuffed! Every dish had its own unique sauce. Which was just absolutely delicious and flavorful. The alfredo was good but it can also be gotten everywhere. I would pass on the bianco only because it was pretty bland in terms of topping. If you get a pizza get one with toppings and sauce. I used the pizza to dip into the sauces of the chicken, beef and clams. Those clams!

Far from it.  But, we went here with a group of work people, and it seemed to have something for everyone. It was pretty easy getting there from the Red Line station, and once we got in, I was really afraid we were going to have to wait, but we walked right in, with no problems with the reservations.   Our waiter was a little flaky; you could tell he was definitely insincere, and almost trying to put a ""I'm Italian, forgettah bout it""/Tony Soprano's little cousin attitude out there.  He was okay enough, but we did go out to dinner with a few people that kept kosher, and one vegetarian, and after ordering our charcuterie and cheeses to be on separate plates, he came back with one plate with everything on it.  He didn't seem to mind having to take it back and get a new one, which was appreciated.   The food was just bland.  It wasn't bad food, it just wasn't great.  I had a bowl of tomato basil soup that tasted a lot like a can of crushed tomatoes, and a vague hint of basil.  I added a ton of salt, which is something I rarely add additionally to my food.  We had an assortment of things at the table, and they all seemed to be okay, but everything was just needing a kick of something.  The soups were definitely under-seasoned.  The charcuterie was okay, but the cheeses that our waiter suggested were something to be desired, especially the soft cow's milk cheese.  I also ordered a pasta, which was an orecchiette.  It supposedly had fennel sausage in it, but I could barely taste the fennel or meat, as the sauce was overly cheesy/creamy.  If the sauce was just a little bit lighter, or there was less of it, it would have been a lot better.  We ordered a pitcher of the sangria, which, as far as sangria goes, was also mediocre/okay.   Not a bad experience, just probably wouldn't recommend it with all of the other better choices in the area.",0.9694,0.818,0.123,0.059,0.47945110445110434

All the flavors were right, but the volume was turned down to one. Chicagoans aren't afraid of some garlic, right?! A tiny bit more salt and a fair bit more of every other seasoning would make a huge difference. Pizza, while overall pretty good, was likewise under-seasoned and overloaded with toppings and (especially) too much mozzarella--a sure way to make an otherwise-good crust soggy and lame.  Props for a good menu, friendly service, reasonable prices, and a fun (but loud!) environment. Not a bad spot for a casual meal--but demerits for the bland food, mediocre coffee.

Not to be confused with energetic ambient banter loud, I mean ears hurt a little and you have to shout to your table mates to have a conversation loud. I love a good bustling, busy restaurant but this was almost uncomfortable. We made a reservation at 7:00pm and waited about 5 minutes for our table to be ready, which is fine. But we waited another 10-15 minutes or so for anyone to even come speak to us. By then we had a drinks and first courses picked out and in famish pecked at the bread. The waiter was nice enough, if not a little pretentious. Our food came quickly and we were please with it's presentation. The taste was a little less impressive. We were so happy to see the many vegetable options since most of us are pretty health conscious and meatless, but the delivery was questionable for some of the items. The caponata was delish as were the beets. The artichokes were bland and the roasted peppers - I have never actually had a red pepper that literally tasted like nothing. But alas, these peppers were pure texture and zero taste. Not to mention everything was drenched in olive oil. The cavatelli was delicious as were the cannelini beans. The spinach and broccoli raab were not memorable - no seasonings or flavor. Overall, it was ok. Nothing truly offensive, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return.

The apricot puree that you dip the cheeses in is out of this world.  The Stefano pizza is quite delicious, as I love rosemary. The Pasta a la Vodka has a great kick to it and is a favorite.

He even brought our family a half-size of a dessert that he knew we would not finish, to save us on our bill and our stomachs! He deserves a raise, whatever he is making. The other waiter that I had (I can't remember his name, unfortunately), was extremely accommodating, and didn't make my boyfriend and I feel bad for ordering a limited amount of items (college budgets are the worst!) After finding out that we attended the college that he graduated from, he took our drinks off of our bill! Those kind gestures go a long way.

Chewy, rubbery and tasted like salt water.  Came with what looked like a sauteed bok choy, which was good. 4) Shrimp Risotto: Probably the best dish of those that we ordered.  Risotto cooked well, good amount of shrimp. 5) Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo: We appreciated the homemade pasta, but it was a little thick and the rest of the flavors were not there.  The braised beef tomato sauce was somewhat watery - not a thick, flavorful sauce.    6) Polenta Fries: Good, crispy.  The red pepper sauce is a nice touch. 7) Sangria: The sangria part was fine, but it needed more fruit.  There were only a few slices of green apple in the pitcher they brought for our table.   Also, we went on a Saturday night and sat outside.  They will clear the outside seating by 11 pm, so make sure you go early enough not to feel rushed through your meal.",0.9934,0.808,0.192,0.0,0.4648442092886538

The only drawback, as others have mentioned, was the noise.  And even that wasn't so bad as to be uncomfortable.  We still were able to chat about the Sophia Loren films on the screens above us and ooh and ahh over our selections.  The service, ambiance, and food all reminded us of some of our favorite places in Europe - though we've not been to Italy, we thought of beer gardens that we frequented in Berlin and Vienna.  All in all, this is a restaurant we'll make a point of returning to.  It's one I recommend without reservation for its food and fun atmosphere.",0.9947,0.784,0.173,0.043,0.6237654320987653

We ordered a number of things:  - Mixed olive appetizer - Polenta fries - Pappardelle with braised beef tomato sauce - Scallops - Caprese salad - Roero Arneis white wine I loved everything above, but here are my (picayune) qualms-- The pappardelle was sloppily tossed onto a plate, we only had 3 scallops for $15, and the Caprese salad was lacking in freshness.  Outside of that, the flavors were delectable and most items were well priced.  We were told that we could get halves of desserts if we wanted, so we opted to try a couple.

A run down of what we ate: - Roasted beet salad - I don't even like beets and I thought this was delicious. Great flavor with the goat cheese added in. Nothing like cramming in antioxidants with some delish goat cheese. Yummers. - Broccoli rabe - this was okay - a bit bitter for my taste and not as much broccoli mixed in with the other elements of the dish. - Tomato soup - very very good. I love a good cup of 'mater soup, and this did not disappoint.  - Chocolate fondue -  delicious dark chocolate served with strawberries. It was a bit strange, though, that they brought a huge container of chocolate and one plate of strawberries. But since we were already full, it wasn't an issue.

We ate here on Saturday night and I'm sure glad I made reservations. It was packed inside and outside! Just getting to the hostess stand was a challenge to push through all the people.  As for the food.. Quartino calls itself a ""tapas"" kind of place so you can try a bunch of things and share. They encourage you to keep your menu at your table so you can order as you go. We ordered the oricchette with sausage, lasagna, salami, broccoli rabe, and a few other dishes I can't remember. The salami and pasta dishes were my favorite. They were flavorful and filling. I didn't really care for the broccoli rabe - it was basically boiled soggy vegetables with no flavor. We also ordered some of their white sangria - that was yummy. They have 3 sizes to order so its great for sharing. The main downside I had with this restaurant was the noise level. It was EXTREMELY loud... probably one of the noisiest places I've ever eaten at... and that's counting all the Chinese restaurants! It was hard to hear or even talk, it felt like we were screaming at each other. Towards the end it wasn't even worth trying to talk over the crowds.

You get to try a bunch of different things instead of just one, and to the people who say they're still hungry after a tapas meal, well... I don't know how. I think I end up eating MORE when I eat small plates. Anyways, this place does Italian tapas right. Highly recommended if you're in the downtown Chicago area. I had only had Spanish tapas until dining at Quartino, and it was so fun to try something new. Definitely make reservations, and if you don't like places that get really busy and pretty cramped, don't come here. I love the excitement and energy of restaurants full of people talking and laughing so it's right up my alley, but it could definitely be overwhelming for someone who prefers more of a quiet atmosphere. This place buzzes with excited diners, and waiters have to weave in and out of tables in order to get food to the right hungry table.

The risotto is a huge portion, and I'm sad that I didn't get to try the mushroom version. I don't think you can go wrong with this menu, so just close your eyes and point to something.

But given that whole octopus is hard to find, and I miss the ambiance occasionally, my wife indulged me and we gave Quartino a try.  A restaurant in River North cannot help but be touristy, I understand that. And despite this, Quartino managed a certain amount of rustic charm endemic to a northern Italian trattoria. The kind where old retired men might play Briscola or Tressette on a warm summer afternoon while sipping house Chianti.  However, one got the distinct impression they were trying to hard to make it quite so rustic. And it didn't help that it was roughly 4 times the size of an Italian trattoria, and way too tightly packed. It wasn't quite as bad as bumping elbows with our neighbours, but neither could we stretch out much. The tables were not large, and the staff kept the bread coming.  The entrees were small, somewhere between tapas and a regular meal, which encouraged sharing, but made their price less palatable. The octopus was tasty, but not amazingly so. The roasted bone marrow was delicious, but not out of this world. And the caprese salad had the right ingredients, but the tomatoes were just short of mouthwatering. And while it wasn't obvious which wine to go with (and their list was quite nice), I went with the house Chianti, which left me feeling underwhelmed, even for the price.

The pizza was nothing special. The sea scallops were nicely cooked and pretty good, but again nothing memorable. The highlight of the dish was the pork shank. I would definitely recommend getting this entree. The braised shank falls off the bone and literally melts in your mouth. With the potato puree, this entree is worth the money.

2012-05-15,3.0,"I don't know if I am spoiled by the tapas I usually have at home, but I was not at all impressed with Quartino, and I say this with an unfortunate note.  We had 1/2 liter of the red wine sangria.  It was simply a-ok; it was lacking in fruits flavors.   We also had the angus beef carpaccio, wrapped dates, sea scallops and the steamed mussels.  The carpaccio was very fresh, served with sliced scallions and shredded cheese.  I highly recommend this dish.  The wrapped dates were good, as well.  It seems that the dates were wrapped with a small slice of salami and drizzled with honey.  It definitely did the job for the sweet tooth, but I would have liked the dates to be wrapped with a small piece of bacon.  You really can't go wrong with bacon, you know?  Sea scallops were prepared well; not too done, which is important for scallops.  The steamed mussels were returned because it was just TOO SALTY.  We tried to eat it, but we couldn't.  So we exchanged it for the shrimp risotto.   I can't say it was the best risotto I have had, but comparing it to the salty mussels, I would pick the risotto.  One good thing about Quartino I would give a 5-star is the service.  Rio was our server, and he was very attentive (not to mention easy on the eyes).  The rest of the staff was also very nice and made sure we had enough water and the table was clear of clutters.   Like I said, I had hoped Quartino would be better, but maybe if I had visited with low expectations, then I would be a happier patron.",0.9966,0.738,0.231,0.031,0.6141079365079366

We started with a 1/2 litre of wine wich provided us both with 2 glasses each...so  a full litre probably would have got us through the meal (we ordrered another later on). We had the sampler and picked our meats Duck prosetuo and Soppressta both were really goood! The cheeses we got werent as amazing but the cucumber salad they give with it is really good, as well as the artichokes, the girdanera and peppers were just all right.  Next we had the tortelini and it was soooooo amazing who knew just cheese would be that good. That was followed up by a lackluster calamari( i wont get again). After that we waite\d...and waited..and waited for the final dish of pork belly...it was well worth the wait.

We also tried the polenta fries (interesting, but not as good as regular french fries of course), lamb shank (melt in your mouth meat and one of the larger dishes we had), a ribbon pasta with meat (also very good). My only complaint was with the pork belly. The flavorings were good (pork and apple always go great together), but the pork belly was very dry. For dessert, we had the profiteroles and tiramisu, both delicious and the perfect ending. Tiramisu is off the menu so make sure to ask your waiter about it.

2012-05-05,4.0,"My wife and I love Tapas bars. It allows you to taste many different plates as you can share and minimizes a bad experience from just one dish. So after coming to Chicago for a conference and checking Yelp we gave Quartino a try. It is not a pure Spanish Tapas restaurant, so if you are a purist you may be disappointed. But the food was from good to very good and it was an enjoyable experience. We had read some reviewers complaining about service, but to be hones the service was good. The octopus was hands down the best dish from our lot, not so chewy, so I would rate it from very good to excellent. All of the others were from good to very good. We try the eggplant, dates stuffed with gorgonzola and then wrapped in bacon (kind of hard not to like this one wherever you go), shrimp and lobster ravioli. If you want to get the most of this Italian Tapas restaurant, try to go with 2-3 other persons so you can sample many items on the menu. Prices were reasonable. Very nice ambiance, a little loud, but it adds to it. My final rating: 3.5 stars",0.9879,0.772,0.186,0.042,0.595079365079365

2012-05-03,5.0,"BEST.DINING.EXPERIENCE.EVER! Let me set the mood. Saturday night in downtown...7 of us...no reservations. By some miracle, even though the place was packed, Matt (I'm assuming if not the owner, then at least a part of upper management) was able to find us a round table that we were seated at immediately. The place was packed wall to wall and everyone was laughing and having a great time. I had never been so I was intrigued by the fact that the orders come out whenever they're ready and that sharing was encouraged. Our server was Brian or Ryan (I must have said it 15 times each way trying to figure out which one, but never quite got it) Haha. He was a superstar! He encouraged us to start with a tasting, which he created for us. His recommendations were dead on. I'm going to try to remember everything we had...we had roasted peppers, roasted beet salad, eggplant salad, two different prosciuttos (one of them duck - both of them phenomenal), one soft cheese and one salty cheese (the soft, which I believe was the Fontina was to die for), and of course lots and lots of bread. We were in heaven and we were just getting started. From there, we ordered two wines, champagne, and then the most delicious meals that I could have ever imagined. I hope I don't leave anything out. There were veal meatball sliders (voted number one fave by one of the seven of us), gnocci (which was a hands-down favorite), fettuccini (another huge hit), lasagna (which was unlike any lasagna I have ever had before...the noodles completely melted in your mouth and each layer seemed to blend perfectly without leaving you too full), the pasta with the lamb ragu (garganelli con ragu d'agnello) - my personal favorite of the evening, and roasted baby octopus (which was just insanely delicious). Then, we moved onto dessert. Since I was in from out of town, we decided to go somewhere else (pops of champagne) - which proved to be the biggest disappointment ever. After such an incredible meal at Quartino, it was the most disappointing way to finish off the evening. Why am I writing this here, you ask? Well, because our night at Quartino hadn't quite ended yet.  With a terrible dessert taste in our mouth from pops, we decided to see if we could strike gold one more time with Quartino. We waltz back in (all seven of us) and are promptly greeted again by Matt, who looks royally confused why we're all back. We explained to him what a let-down pops had been and how we couldn't end such a good night with their sad excuse for desserts. He sits us right back down at our table and, without any hesitation, orders us three different desserts...on the house. I was blown away.  We had their Italian doughnuts (which were so fresh and exquisite), tiramisu, which normally doesn't appeal to me, but I couldn't get enough of this one, and one of their infamous gelato dishes, topped with bananas and deliciousness. Because of the gracious service, remarkable food, and obvious hospitality of Quartino, my first downtown experience in Chicago will be an ever-lasting memory.

I love the small plate concept.  I'm such a fan of trying a bunch of different dishes and Quartino really has something for everyone!  I have tried a good number of dishes and they have been great. A few highlights: -Scallops: I love scallops and they are cooked great here. -Gnocchi - This is a dish that is different everywhere you go.  Their version is top notch. -Pizzas - they have all been good but I don't go here for the pizza -Dates: They are good but I prefer Babareebas -Lasagna al Forno- my friend raved about this dish (I was too stuffed to try it) The wine selection is extensive and I like that they offer different sizes of the wine (1/4 & 1/2 bottles).  I have had their martinis as well and after a couple of those you will have quite a little buzz going! I would recommend making reservations on open table or you could be waiting a while. It is a pretty large restaurant and the tables can be quite close together so getting around is more like going through a maze.  It can get loud and if you are at a long table good luck hearing the people at the other end.  These are just small complaints and would never stop me from coming back.,0.9939,0.774,0.213,0.013,0.5148015873015873

Asparagus Risotto (2.5 stars) - I felt so bad I didn't like this because my server said it was her favorite dish!  I just told her I ate the salad too fast & got too full, but it really was lacking any flavor.  I did taste asparagus, but maybe I'm just being picky.  I keep forgetting I'm not a big Risotto fan, but when a server tells me it's their fave - I can't not give it a try. Profiteroles (3 stars) - Although probably made in-house, these definitely came straight from the freezer.  I expect profiteroles to be easy to bite into.  These were rock hard.  Such a shame because the flavor was definitely good, especially the vanilla gelato in the middle. Service (4.5 stars) - I forgot my server's name, but it was actually her last week there.  Ironically, she was moving to New York.  But in any case, she was definitely sweet and adhered to my many tasting requests.  Eventually, she suggested a wine that I loved, which I, unfortunately, also forgot the name of.  Half a star off because I had to wait/flag her a few times, but it was pretty busy. Ambiance (4 stars) - cute, casual, intimate, great for a low-key date.

The Italian Tapas concept is genius, although probably not novel, but who doesn't have trouble deciding what they want at an Italian restaurant?  I ordered the pizza bianca and eggplant parm and both were really, really good.  The pizza bianca wasn't quite what I was expecting- it was alot drier than the traditional olive oil/fresh mozarella concoction that I usually get when I ask for pizza bianca- but it tasted awesome enough to make me forget about all of the other pizza biancas I have ever been with.  The eggplant parm was exactly what it should have been- hearty, cheesy and delicious.  The only thing that kept me from staying at the bar, nursing carafes of wine and trying to stuff some dessert in myself  was my desire to head back to my hotel and slap on my spandex-waist yoga pants (WARNING: NOT A SKINNY-JEAN-FRIENDLY ESTABLISHMENT.

However, I was pleasantly surprised by Quartino's. Reservations for a large group of 10 people were easily made through Open Table. The restaurant won't seat you until the entire party is present but if you show up early the bar was a great place to wait.  I've never done italian small plates, but I really love this idea. Any italian place will serve you giant bowls/plates of pasta which is not calorically feasible for one meal and you end up sharing it anyways. So if you love to share, you will love Quartino's. If you don't love to share it's ok, you'll just be shunned by the rest of your table.  It was great to order wine by the liter (yes America that is a metric measurement).

We rounded up a few items from the menu -duck prosciutto, a margherita pizza and polenta fries red bell pepper salsa as well as few beers. Nothing amazing and mind-blowing, but the duck prosciutto was pretty on point. Can't say I've had duck like that before, so it was a pleasant surprise for everyone at the table. The assorted pickled veggies that accompanied it were gone in a heartbeat. BTW, I almost stole the mini cast iron skillet they came in. That thing was too amazing not to have. The polenta fries were fun but slightly bland, a little salt or seasoning would've made this a winner, hands down. The best of the night had to be the cheese grater they seemed to have imported from Italy. A plastic container with a fresh block of cheese in it that is shredded when needed. Contemplated stealing that as well, but my partner in crimes purse was too small.  Service was great considering we came in at around 1230a and the place shut down at around 2a.

2012-03-24,2.0,"The short review: it was over-hyped and I was underwhelmed.  The long review: We went out with a small group of friends to celebrate a birthday and we made a reservation for 6:30 for a party of six on a Friday. The restaurant was insanely busy and there was already a line of people waiting, which made me relieved that we had a reservation. We ended up being seated on the second floor near one of the kitchens. The atmosphere was extremely loud, and I could barely hear the other people at the table, as everyone in the restaurant was yelling at one another. I would not recommend this for an intimate date, or any sort of dinner where you value conversation. Now, onto the service. The service was extremely lacking. It took about 10 minutes for our server to approach our table, and she didn't really offer up any recommendations or suggestions. She disappeared for awhile, and then some random guy (the owner? manager?) came up to our table and took our drink order on a grubby piece of paper and then just left. Another waiter/server came out and served us our drinks, which also seemed bizarre. Luckily, our waitress came back and we put in our food orders, and she was able to answer a few questions we had about the menu and how much food to order. Our table seemed confused by the fact that the menu is ""family style"" and ""small plates"". Many people ordered too little food and complained of the portion sizes as ""family style"" and ""small plates"" are conflicting terms. My boyfriend and I have been to many tapas bars and small plate restaurants, so we anticipated the way the meal would be served. I think it would be fair to mention that you could go to almost any other restaurant and order an entree per person and share with your entire party and there would be significantly more food for a much lower price. Regardless, people still seemed hungry after ordering an entree per person, but no one wanted to foot a higher bill. As for the food, I seem to be missing something based on the other Yelp reviews.  The duck prosciutto was... lacking. We were served a measly 2 ounces of meat that was over salted and lacking in duck taste. I kept on pairing it with varying amounts of the sauce/jam on the side and that just made it taste worse. I really, really wanted to like this, as I haven't seen it on a menu before, but it was just terrible. I would NOT recommend this to anyone. Next, my boyfriend and I split the Caprese salad. It was pretty standard--nothing amazing, nothing terrible. Lastly, we split the beef short rib which was one short rib. The meat was extremely tender and fell of the bone, and the sauce greatly accentuated the meat. This is the one item I would recommend that everyone try if they dare venture to this restaurant. The other people in our party split a plate of Vodka Pasta which looked pretty standard, and the four people each had a large spoonful of pasta. They also split the grilled calamari which disappeared quickly, so I'm assuming they liked it. For their main entree, they split a pepperoni pizza which was about the size of a medium Dominos pizza, and they each got 2 pieces. They all said it was good, and everyone seemed to enjoy it. The other people in our party tried two of the desserts (the banana split and the profiteroles) and they were large portions and looked good. I didn't try them so I can't comment on it! All in all, I'll never visit this restaurant again, as I feel that your money can be much better spent at any of the other culinary meccas in Chicago.

The restaurant is kind of huge, 2 floors, always bustling with people, loud, kind of a market vibe-y, and they always play old school Italian flicks on the TVs (thanks!). They serve small plate style so the bill racks up quickly, but the food is so delish. The pizza is a favorite. It is thin crust and they let you order half and half, and can also substitute ingredients. For example, we usually order half rustica and half fumo negli ochi with arugula instead of spinach.. try it seriously. The pork belly with apple compote is really tasty. All of the risotto dishes are great, overpriced though. The eggplant parm is a must. Last time we tried the roasted bone marrow which was nothing special at all, too much breading. The wine list is really nice and they always have suggestions. I would not recommend the sangria here (go to Cafe Iberico if you want Sangria). The gelato dessert is yummy. The service can be inconsistent, it just depends on the night and who you get. We went on St. Patty's Day, and our waiter with the silly curled-up mustache was in a grumpy mood and only visited us twice :( But we've also been when the waiter was super friendly and cracking jokes :) Sit outside in the summer and always shoot for the first floor instead of second floor.  OH also, I wish they had Parmesan cheese on the table at all times. They give you bread and olive oil and a mysterious white container with mostly Italian writing... so you just assume it is cheese when it's actually sea salt, and then you learn the hard way.

The menu is set up tapas-style so that you order a bunch of little things to share. I liked this as it allowed me to indulge in my favorite eating habit, i.e., trying a bit of everyone's dishes. We tried a wide range of the menu, from pizzas to pasta to seafood, so there was something for everyone.  The standouts for me were the mushroom risotto, the polenta fries, and the penne in vodka sauce. The risotto was just so creamy and delicious, we had to order a second helping. And I liked that it was earthy without suffering from the lack of flavor that sometimes plagues this dish at other restaurants. The polenta fries were a wildcard. I was expecting them to be pretty bland but they were really well done. Crispy on the outside and spongy on the inside, with a tomato-based dipping sauce that isn't the traditional marinara. The penne in vodka sauce wasn't overly unique or unusual, just really well done and tasty.  I also tried the pesto gnocchi, which I was expecting to love. In truth, it wasn't bad, just not as good as the others. The pasta was pillowy and light, but the sauce could have used some oomph. Maybe more basil in the pesto? Or parm? More cheese and butter never hurt...except, you know, heart- and health-wise.  The pizza was the only disappointing part of the meal. I tried the margherita and it was just off. The crust wasn't crispy, the cheese and sauce were bland, and it lacked that overall salty/tanginess that I love so much. Kind of a bummer. But honestly it would have been hard to surpass the marghy I had at Flo & Santos the night before. The salmon, on the other hand, was a saltsplosion, in a good way (if you're a saltaholic like me). The stewed tomatoes were a nice addition to the fish.  I had only a bite of the lemoncello dessert thing, and it was uh-mazing.  Our server took great care of us and didn't cop a 'tude when we kept throwing additional requests at her. She kept our waters and sodas refilled, brought us extra wine glasses right away, and made sure we had utensils and napkins for each round of food (the bussers had a habit of snatching them away).

2012-03-04,4.0,"Finally, fried calamari done right. That might have been enough to warrant a 4-star review, but wait ... there's more ... The place was packed at 7:30 p.m. on a Saturday night. I highly recommend making reservations at least a week ahead of time. I was able to get a good sampling of food because of items ordered by 7 other girlfriends (eventually) seated at the first floor bar. Maybe I should have read other reviews before going -- I probably would have found out about the virtually non-occupied 2nd floor bar option. Nevermind that... the wine and food were delicious. I'm mad because I didn't try more. A quarter liter of wine was an ample amount for me. I ordered my new wine love the MALBEC ($9). It was pretty good. I tried someone's ROSSO DI MONTEPULCIANO and it was the same, just less heavy. I ordered the VEGETARINA PIZZA ($12) and it was tasty, with a nice crispy crust. It's hard to go wrong with arugula and eggplant on pizza. Then, throughout the night I snatched bites of the handmade cheese TORTELLINI, POLENTA FRIES, as well as two decadent desserts -- COPPA AL BANANA  (Carmelized Banana, Vanilla Gelato, Biscotti, Whipped Cream, Chocolate Sauce, & Shavings) and TORTA AL CIOCCOLATO (Hot Chocolate Cake & Vanilla Gelato).  The CRISP CALAMARI was truly the least rubbery (i.e. well-cooked yet best quality) calamari that I've tasted in a long time. Due to my repeated bad experiences with the dish, I was hesitant to buy it myself. I'm certainly glad a friend did instead! My bill was about $28, including tax & tip. At the bar, the service was prompt and knowledgeable. I have no complaints there. The crowd was a challenge. I just wish the hostesses, when I stated that I was expecting a group of 9 and was unable to get reservations (since the place was booked), had suggested going to the upstairs bar. I did speak to the manager at some point, who politely explained our options. Also, I appreciated the sincere efforts of the 2nd floor bartender to try to accommodate our party.  All in all, we had a great time. The crowd did bring a great energy to the place. Downtown on a Saturday night, what did I expect?

Our waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable. We had the dates and caprese salad, which were great. Ordered a pizza which was just ok, we had the one with meatballs, peppers, and onions, it just didn't have a lot of flavor besides the spice.

This was awesome and we could have easily eaten another plate. The tomatoes and seasonings in general on the skirt steak were great, but the meat wasn't really cooked like skirt steak should be. Kind of difficult to cut. However, in a large kitchen with small plates, we should have known better than to order an item like that.

Server told us we ordered too much food (let us worry about what to do with the leftovers). And wine wasn't served in wine glasses, rather those small cup-like glasses.

We decided to try out Quartino although it looked pretty packed when we passed by it. It was with some belief in luck that we still decided to make our way to this tapas style joint and hoped to get a table on a Saturday night.  And fortune did shine on us! We were seated right away, amidst a large crowd in the waiting area! Strength in the lack of numbers worked for us..with a little bit of luck!  Quartino was overall a loud, rustic, energized, and tasty tapas experience. The menu is very Italian with house made pastas with a selection of choices all round. Not a bad wine list either. Easy to see that the place gets pretty busy easily. Still, I have to say that their service was pretty amazing! We had the Cavatelli (excellent pasta), Shrimp Risotto (very tasty), Eggplant Parmesan (cheesy but good) and the Rustic sausage (so-so). It was a decent amount of food for two hungry people. I really liked the Cavatelli. The basil and tomatoes on there just made it right! All the dishes were timed fairly well! We got dishes two at a time, and since we had a pretty small table, it made things very practical.  My friend wanted Tiramisu badly, and was disappointed to find that it was not on the menu. A little surprised we asked our peppy server, and lo and behold, they had it as a special off the menu! Our luck was not running out in here, as the big loaf of Tiramisu served to us was pretty amazing and heavenly!! Such a generous portion too! We certainly took our time!

2012-01-21,3.0,"A group of friends and I decided on Quartino for an early Friday dinner, and the place was packed by 5:30. The space is very warm and inviting, and our group of five was seated in the mist of out-of-town families, older couples, and twenty-somethings that had probably just gotten off work. Our waiter was friendly enough, though hard to get a hold of during the peak time. Our party was very excited to see a valet in the bathroom. We were all poor college students, so instead of ordering in the manner suggested (1.5 plates person), we each ordered one dish and then got an order of calamari as an appetizer. This worked fine, as none of us needed a ton of food anyways, but I understand how the average person would not be satisfied with one plate. The calamari's breading was light, crispy, and well seasoned-- a very good start. For the main dish I ordered the linguine with clams, and the rest of the table tried the gnocchi, the lasagna al Forno, and the garganelli con Ragu D'Agnello. The lasagna took a while to come out, though that's pretty typical for such a dish, and everything else was speedy. I ordered the linguine with the white sauce, and it was light and buttery in such a way that I can't imagine the red sauce working nearly as well. It was simple and fresh, the clams were especially good, but nothing amazing. Opinions about the gnocchi were split, one person liked it but another said it was bland, the lasagna was tasty but unmemorable, and the table agreed the garganelli was very good. We all came away from the meal pleased, though not wowed.  Don't get me wrong, I had a good experience. For a restaurant in this location, the food was affordable and un-gimmicky.

2012-01-17,4.0,"Small plates are a trend that is definitely here to stay - it sometimes feels like the majority of restaurants in Chicago serve small plates. It's almost becoming a tired concept - too many places serve the same mediocre, overpriced-for-their-size flatbreads and calamari, vaguely attuned to whatever ethnic cuisine the establishment is trying to emulate. Quartino is not in this category; this place executes the concept flawlessly. Based on my experience, the food is uniformly fantastic. The prosciutto-wrapped dates are excellent; not remotely greasy or cloying (Chicago restauranteurs take note: dates are already sweet and do NOT need a superfluous honey glaze. Do them like this). The grilled octopus is fork-tender and simply seasoned. Bone marrow is copious and served with an appropriate amount of bread. Gnocchi with arugula pesto and green beans undoubtedly stole the show. I've seen enough of the played-out gnocchi offerings, served with gobs of bleu cheese or bland vodka cream sauce. This was a subtle twist on an authentic dish (Romans eat pesto with green beans and potatoes, which were represented by the gnocchi) - a welcome change of pace. I recommend you spring for fondue for dessert, which is also a pleasant surprise; very dark chocolate, melted just right, not a shade too thick or too thin. My lone pseudo-gripe is with the short rib, which tastes somewhat like the Italian potroast I make at home; by no means unpleasant, but it is somewhat offputting to be served food one feels one can make for oneself.  Pricing was surprisingly fair for this typically extortionate neighborhood - most small plates set you back single digits, no small plate runs more than $13, and some of them (gnocchi, short rib) approach entree-size. Wine list is good and cheap, service is fast. All in all, Quartino bucks the trend of pedestrian, vaguely Mediterranean small plate establishments that are inundating the Chicago restaurant scene.

You get a basket of house-made bread after you are seated which you can dip in olive oil and real Italian parmesan chese that you can grate yourself.  Food didn't take long to appear on the table even with our group size and how busy the restaurant was.  Overall the meal was good.  Food was good.  The only complain for the food was that the pork belly was a bit dry.   The server was friendly, however, she did not let us know that there were no refill, so between just two guests, it ended up $20 worth of lemonades.  Also, we ordered zeppole as one of our many desserts.  We didn't know that we have to choose between honey or chocolate for dipping sauce.  When the dessert arrived, it came with both honey AND chocolate dipping sauce.  Later when the bill came, we found out that there was an extra $2.50 for the honey.  I would say that that is very sneaky.   The bill came out to be about $450, which was over our expectabtion, but that was ok since everyone enjoyed the food.  But my impression about Quartino changed after the sneaky charges that we incurred.   Pro: Good place to go to if you want to try many different dishes with a group as they serve tapas.  It's always a busy place so you know the food is good.

It tasted very fresh, and the ricotta cheese on top was a perfect touch. However, the best part of the meal was definitely dessert. Get the TIRAMISU.

The restaurant serves smaller portions of entrees that are available to share if you have a large party. Be sure to get a reservation or be prepared to wait a long time for a table during dinner hours.  A quick review of our meal: 1. Margherita pizza- thin crust variety home made mozzarella and sweet basil leaf makes for a great sharing dish 2. Dates wrapped in pancetta- small appetizer dish perfect with wine 3. House bread- great with olive oil and parmesean cheese from the grater (unlike other restaurants this is the real deal in your own personal grater) 4. Fettuccini- fresh made fettuccini pasta cooked perfectly in a white sauce 5. Tortellini- thin slices of proscuitto bring out the tortellini. No complaints here 6. Linguini with clams- this is one of the highlight dishes with perfectly cooked linguini slightly above al dente with a few clams complimented by a white or red sauce.  7. Penne alla vodka- can't really taste the vodka, an okay dish 8. Rigatoni- a few chicken chunks that were slightly over cook detracted from this dish 9. Shrimp risotto- shrimp were not overcooked and a healthy amount of cheese holds the dish together well 10. Sauteed spinach- over-rated and over priced. spinach with garlic and oil.. Blah 11. Beef short ribs- fall off the bone tissue with a nice salsa verde 12. Beef filets- amazing, so small though the piece of beef. perfectly cooked filet mignon 13. Gran Coppa Quartino- expensive, but if you like gelato and biscotti with hazelnut this is the dessert for you. Has all three gelato flavors 14. Fantasia Coppa di Frutta- equally as expensive as above but with all flavors of sorbet 15. Panino al Gelato Limone - very soft lemon gelato sandwich 16. Zeppole - Great dish to share, inexpensive. Italian donuts with chocolate or honey. fyi they charge extra if you select both NEGATIVE POINTS - Candle in the middle of the table dripped wax all over our cups - Server did not ask about honey or chocolate with the zeppole and ended up charging us - Server did not inform a party member that there was no refills on the lemonade. we ended up spending 20 dollars on lemonade - After spending 450 dollars on this meal we still barely safe our server.

The rooms are spacious, the food is tasty and the service is generally spot on.  The location is super convenient for meandering downtown, I think a better option than Bandera's. But on to the food.  You should definitely start with the Salumeria Tasting, you select two meats, two cheeses along with three accompaniments. I don't know if you have ever had the opportunity to try Duck Prosciutto, but you should.  It is melt in your mouth delicious, for real.  The generous portions of cheese will not be forgotten anytime soon. They also provide you with a delicious walnut raisin bread, which plays along beautifully with all.   Hard to believe that we ordered pasta and pizza after the Salumeria Tasting, but we did.  The Rustica Pizza is  wonderful, although the rosemary could have been chopped a little finer.  Biting into a large piece of rosemary is like chewing on a Christmas tree, not so much.  But the Shrimp Risotto more than made up for it.  The shrimp were nice and plump, not a trace of overcooking.   Too full for dessert the times we've been here, perhaps next time, because we'll definitely be going back.",0.9936,0.774,0.219,0.007,0.5624686716791981

They have a fantastic wine selection. And the desserts--oh my! The last time I went there everyone at my table got something different and there honestly wasn't a favorite. It was all terrific. I also love the black and white movies they play. The service can be hit or miss. The place gets pretty packed at night and you can barely get out of your chair without bumping into someone. This is the only reason I give the place four stars. I feel they could take about five tables out the main room to make it more comfortable, but I understand why they wouldn't. Having said this, I have never waited more than 30 minutes for a table. I highly recommend making reservations though. Just a tip, they have a person in the bathroom to pamper you. Bring a couple bucks with you when you need to go.  I'm not even in a relationship, but I want my wedding reception here.

We made a reservation for 9:30pm and all showed up at about 9:10. Unfortunately it was a REALLY busy night and we did not get seated until 10pm. But because of the delay, the staff sent over three plates of meat, three plates of cheese and two carafes of wine. Fo' free. Hello? (:  They sat us in the private room, which normally would have a $20 per person charge, but they did not make us pay that either. Holy comps, batman... this place is already on my good side.  Aside from our adorable and kind waiter, the restaurant's host kept coming into the room to check on us and make sure our dining experience was on-point. Also, he seemed to notice a colorful theme in this room full of 13 fabulous men and, well, me. So he flipped the football on our TV to Bravo, which of course was showing Real Housewives. The room applauded.  We began to order food. The menu is set up with smaller plates, meant to share. There were many different tastes to please in our group so we ordered quite a bit of variety off the menu. I heard not one complaint! Everyone was very happy with the taste and quality of the food.  After we stuffed ourselves, we of course had to order some dessert. I was too full for dessert, but a few friends ordered some ice cream (or was it gelato?) and I had a few bites. SO yummy. Most of the table ordered limoncello or coffee, too.  Now the best part of the evening came right at the end (for lack of better term..ahem) when our lovely waiter--quite proudly--brought to our table (and placed right in front of me) the most realistic looking ice cream/banana phallus I have ever seen, complete with a lit birthday candle and, um, chocolate ""shavings"". After a tremendous bout of approving laughter we all sang happy birthday to each other, waiter and host included.

My friend had been wanting to try this restaurant out for a while so I was happy to check it out with her. When I asked the hostess what the wait would be, she told me the dining room was sold out for the night. Sad face. It was cold, and we were tired so we decided to try our luck at the bar area since it was first come, first served. We spotted a couple in the back corner that appeared to be finishing up and camped out next to them in a polite I'm gonna stare at you and make you uncomfortable until you leave kind of way. Just to lock up the table, I asked them if we could have it when they were finished. Right after I did that, some girl says ""uh, I've been waiting for 30 min"" My response ""ok, well you're not even near the table so if any table opens up does it become yours just because you've been waiting for 30 min?"" Yo Chicago, I don't know how first come first served works in your town, but from where I'm from, the first to grab a table when it opens up gets it regardless if they haven't been waiting the longest. The girl didn't have a rebuttal and another spot opened up so it worked out anyway.   I don't go to a lot of tapas restaurants because I always feel like you end up spending a lot for not very much food. That certainly was not the case here. I'm glad we ordered more conservatively because the portions were big. The menu is fairly extensive but we were able to narrow it down to the Pappardelle al Sugo di Manzo, Roasted Bone Marrow, Mushroom Risotto, and Caprese salad. Everything was delicious but the bone marrow and mushroom risotto really stood out. They were both perfectly cooked, rich, and full of flavor. Just a heads up, the bone marrow is just 2 bones - perfect for 2 people, may not be enough for a larger party.  I really enjoyed this meal.  The service was good.

I took my mom here when she came to visit from Pennsylvania. I wanted to do a nice, formal dinner one night so after some research I decided on Quartino based on price, location and menu selection.  The menu really is extensive. It's mostly ""small plates"" to be shared, but I found the portion size to be just right. I don't know if I've ever had a better chicken alfredo rigatoni. Yes, it's a rather standard, simple dish, but it can be ruined so easily. Quartino just nailed it. My boyfriend had the veal osso bucco and was floored. My mom had the spaghetti and meatballs and was impressed. I tried the sauce which was killer. A little on the spicy side and very unique. Overall, the food was probably some of the best I've had in the city.  The atmosphere is romantic, but you can go there dressed casually and not feel out of place. It is crowded, as the tables are positioned very close to one another and the noise level was very, very high when we were there (7pm on a Saturday, I believe).

But the place seems to have a lot of seats. Ambiance: Dim-lit with just the right amount of light. It was a Friday night and it was bustling with a lot of noise and people. I loved it! The vibe is perfect for a weekend out with friends for just a nice gathering or for a celebratory event. It's also really cute for a date night. I enjoy tapas food because I find the engagement between you and your friends more intimate - which helps for a lively place like this! Food: Amazing! We went back in March so bear with me. I believe we ordered pizza, the ravioli, black olives, pickles, i think we also ordered some salami slices. It was all really delicious and really filling. I wish I can remember what pizza we ordered though.  Alcohol: SO CHEAP! Half/full bottles of wine are SO affordable! If you go to a restaurant in Toronto you are probably going to pay $80+ for a bottle that costs $15 in a Liquor store. Service: Really great - our server was very attentive and suggested things for us because he could see we were a bit lost on what to get at first. He came around often enough - especially given that it was a very busy night. Summary: In summary, this place is a bang-for-your buck kind of place. You get the fun with good food and great ambiance without hurting your wallet. Too bad this place doesn't exist in Toronto because then I would probably want to host my birthday here with friends.",0.9967,0.787,0.182,0.031,0.634047619047619

The food was great! The Grapefruitini made for a nice start to the meal. My husband and I ordered a number of small plates and were particularly impressed with the Braised Pork. It literally fell off the bone and my husband was found picking every last morsel off the bone when our waitress came to pick up the last of our plates.

Some of my favorites are: the caprese salad, which has big, generous portions of mozzarella (yummm); the tortellini with prosciutto and peas (anything with prosciutto is a plus in my book!); linguini with clams; and the lamb ragu. All of the portions are hearty and filling. I also particularly love the peach bellini -- a nice, fruity, and girly way to get my buzz on. I also love the casual, energetic ambiance of Quartino. This includes everything down to the mismatched plates and utensils, the family-style plates, the chatter of conversation... I recently planned a reunion event with over 25 people here. I just have to say that the service was truly exceptional. I unfortunately bugged the woman who plans private events, Julie Jensen, several times with changes in the reservation and questions about the menu. Every time, she was prompt in returning my messages and patient about answering my questions. When our party actually got to the restaurant, the waiter was also amazing -- friendly and attentive without being overbearing. The food came out quickly, which was impressive given the size of our party as well as the number of other patrons that night. What was also great was that we never felt rushed to leave even though we definitely took up the majority of the second floor! Love this place!!",0.9965,0.744,0.243,0.013,0.5622222222222223

The food at quartino is slightly more inventive but of equal quality of something you would get at Olive garden. The malbec we ordered tasted like it was a boxed wine and lacked any dimension (could have been a bad wine selection, but I haven't met many malbecs I didn't enjoy). It was so loud on the 2nd floor that I couldn't hear the person sitting directly next to me, let a lone across the table.  The highlight was the Pappardelle with the braised beef sauce, by far the best dish.

2011-10-12,4.0,"Quartino, you live up to the hype. My first experience was with the party they threw for Yelp Elites. I came and conquered their free eats. I couldn't stop raving about it to my husband that I made reservations and came again the other night with my cousin and his girlfriend.  Reservations were for Friday evening at 8pm. The place was rocking. It was such a gorgeous night that we asked to sit outside but the wait was an hour. We skipped that but still had to wait about 20 minutes for our table to be available.  We sat down next to a large party which made it very difficult for us to have a conversation. Well, we could but we were yelling at each other. Once they left, it was much better. All we kept saying was how our parents would love the food but would hate the noise level. That aside, the food was fantastic! We ordered the sampler: Giardiniera, roasted peppers, roasted beet salad, Pecorino and a soft cheese (sorry, the name escapes me and it's not on their menu), soppressatta and prosciutto. Other dishes included:  Roasted Bone Marrow  Pork Belly  Lasagna al Forno  Braised Pork Shank  Skate Wing  I was very excited to order the bone marrow and felt disappointed when I ate the dish. It had too many complex flavors that the flavor of the marrow itself was lost. There was some spice on top of it that I couldn't place. I could have done with the marrow, some salt and bread only. That was the only dish that I wished was different but all the others were divine. I'm thinking about my meal as I write this review.  A liter of wine was ordered and I had a Blood Orange Italian soda to compliment my meal. The service was great, the food delicious and the company the best! The total bill was around $140 for all the food and drinks but that was cheap considering how much we ate and the amazingness of the food.

Things were off to a good start: we order 3 pizzas, the texture was great, and the tomato sauce was very refreshing. The fried calamari was so good we had to order a second one because the first one disappeared in mere seconds. Unfortunately the entrees were all letdowns: my papardelle was so thick and bland it was like chewing beige carpet. The only saving grace was the flavorful meat sauce, but it wasn't enough to save the pasta. The risottos had good texture but came out looking gummy, like they've been sitting under a warming lamp for too long. Fortunately desserts were decent: tiramisu was light and airy, and the chocolate cake rich & decadent.  I'd come back and stick with the pizzas, appetizers & desserts.

Maybe it was the wedding reception taking place upstairs that made Quartino put extra tables in every possible nook and cranny downstairs.  It made what was a loud, energetic restaurant just impossibly loud and overcrowded.  We were sitting literally elbow to elbow with tables all around.  They were seating people in the entrance next to the doors.  I spent most of my dinner just waiting for a busboy or server to trip over me and spill something.  There were probably 2-3 close calls. You can say that anyone that puts up with that abuse gets what they deserve.  You could also argue that a restaurant willing to do that compels you to take your business elsewhere next time.  It bordered on utter contempt for the customer.    The wait staff was overstressed, and the hordes of tourists and bachelorette parties and iPhone-hypnotized woo girls cramming this restaurant just didn't get the Chicago Italian Experience that they probably were expecting from this place.  I have no idea how anybody at those large tables could enjoy themselves when they couldn't hear the person sitting across from them.  I was just trying to get some more bread or a drink refill without having to flag someone down.

My problem is that I don't enjoy eating at places that are great values. I love eating at restaurants that blow me away with flavorful food. I ate here with my larger family and the 7 of us each picked 2 dishes. That's 14 different items from the menu so we sampled much of what Quartino has to offer.

When we had all signed our receipts, he practically ran to our table and wasted no time reviewing them.  He walked off, not thanking us for our patronage and for the fact that we just left him a decent tip.  It is NEVER appropriate to take signed receipts--much less scrutinize them--in front of customers when they're still seated, no matter how busy the restaurant is.  Also, if this man felt so inconvenienced serving us, after everything we ordered, he has no business in a job that requires him to respect the people he comes across.  If I ever see him again, I will not think twice about asking the hostess to reseat us.",-0.9065,0.816,0.062,0.123,0.47564102564102567

Decor is fun - worn wooden tables, white subway tile, vintage light fixtures, and cotton dish towels as napkins.  The dishes are presented as small plates for sharing.  Some aren't all that small though so the meal is hearty.  The thin crust pizza had a nice crispy crust with a balanced red sauce.  The pizza rustica had crispy thin sliced potatoes and rosemary, a savory surprise. The lasagna had a very flavorful sauce, maybe a tad too sweet.  The pasta was very tender.  We also tried chunks of pecorino, three kinds of olives, and tasty thinly sliced, cured meat.  We ordered these items separately but they arrived nicely presented on a board with the addition of cucumber vinaigrette, chewy bread and a delicate apricot spread. On previous visits we've tried the veal sliders, pasta with beef short ribs, and the bone marrow - all nicely presented and very good.  There's an extensive wine list with many choices offered in small portions.  It's a good place to go with friends - enjoy the food and be prepared to yell if you want to have a conversation.",0.9884,0.823,0.154,0.023,0.473933933933934

The service is great, the price are better, and the environment is flawless. There's not a bad seat in the restaurant.  I love their tomato soup, my mom loves the small plates (olives, meats, cheeses, at the best prices in town), and my friends like their pasta dishes. I love the steamed clams, almost as you would get in New England, but not thaaat good! The complimentary bread is great as well! Their pizzas are perfectly thin and crispy and they have a wide range of combinations! And to the people complaining about the service, they tell you before you order that, because everything is made-to-order and does not sit under warmers, they bring everything out at different times. If you were going to be dramatic about it, get up and leave after they tell you! I have met the manager a few times and I am very pleased with every meal I have gotten there.

2011-09-11,5.0,"We live down the street from Quartino and always witness the large crowd of people that gather around the restaurant. This has become one of my favorite neighborhood spots. The plates are meant to be shared. Some of our favorites are the tortellini, orrechiette, and the chicken noodle soup! The pizzas are thin crust and have great options for toppings. We usually get 3-4 plates to share among my wife and I- sometimes we have leftovers to take home. We've never had a pasta that we have not enjoyed there. The pasta is cooked to perfection! The food comes out fast, so if you want to eat slowly and enjoy each plate ask your server to bring out the food slower. We love to eat outside at Quartino! The outside area is always crowded and they always seem to have a minimum 30 minute wait. We've eaten a few times inside and it is loud and hard to have a conversation with anyone. If you are trying to eat a fast meal, I suggest dining in the bar. The service has always been amazing! The wait staff is friendly, informative and personable.

What is fantastic is that it has a pretty large, pretty tasty, and VERY CHEAP WINE LIST.  Cheap as in we got a good bottle of pinot for $10.  I would suggest Quartino if you're going out with friends who think Maggiano's is AWESOME, and who don't mind raising their voices to be heard by the person next to them -- the place gets hopping so it's not for the hard of hearing geriatrics in your life.

They do have a regular menu, and much of the menus both overlap each other. It was great that they had sooooo many options.... having that FULL menu to choose from! We had the sampler to start, which was an array of different cheeses, italian cured meats, side veggies and olives. We also tried the mushroom risotto and the veal osso buco. The sampler was great, the waiter even gave us an extra thing or two to add to it. The mushroom risotto was made with a pork stock, it was good with the fontina (i think) cheese that came with the sampler. it wasn't too soupy and cooked to allow all the right flavors in.

We made reservations well in advance for our culinary tour across America, and my boyfriend is a chef so we are all about tapas style cuisine. The hostess had an issue finding our reservation and told us to wait 20 minutes in the bar. The cocktail waitress was downright rude when we asked to pay for our drinks right away, as the hostess called our name five minutes later. We already had cash and a tip out and nicely asked the cocktail waitress to transfer our bar tab to our table in the dining room. She literally refused and rudely ""asked"" ""dont you guys mind paying here?"" I was immediately turned off based on our first impression. Being in the restaurant industry we know how to tip and we know rudeness when we see it, doing exactly the opposite of a specific guest request is a big no-no where we come from in Las Vegas and NYC but anyways... Thank goodness our server was great, he is truly the only reason we are giving three stars instead of two. He was excellent, attentive, knowledgable and apologetic for the few little snafus from the kitchen. (He didn't even know about the situation at the bar.) Anyways, the ambiance was cool, I liked the candelabras with real candles on the bigger tables and the decor. I know this is a personal thing, but the tiny little ""shot glass"" looking things they serve with the wine carafes are one of my pet peeves. I want my pinot noir to aerate properly, one glass at a time, in a nice big red wine glass. Their glasses made me, a pretty avid wine drinker, want to drink less. And one glass was skunked, but our server got me another one and it was better so no worries, that happens sometimes. The food was underwhelming, almost as if it had been awesome at one point and then, well, I don't know, but the food had so much potential to be great! The cheese fondue was ok, the cured meats were good, The bone marrow was horribly over done and the bread crumbs on top were overwhelming. The veal meatballs were not good at all, in fact, they took so long our server took them off of the bill before they ever arrived.  The eggplant was great, and the parpadelle was ok, but the pasta was overcooked.

I work in the industry and I know how it goes. You don't treat patrons that way. Quartinos is not a NIGHTCLUB! If people order food and wine, YOU SHOULD LET THEM FINISH IT!

Both were good, I especially liked the white bean spread. We ordered two pizzas to share and an order of gnocchi with pesto.  I wish the pizzas and gnocchi were as good as the apps. The gnocchi was not very good and was sent back. Way too oily and off tasting. No problem with the server removing the item.  The pizzas........not that good. The Margherita one was only OK, the mushroom one was flavorless. Both were also sort of under done. Pretty disappointing.

My answer: ""Sometimes you don't mess with the sure thing."" Quartino is a guarantee for a fun, delicious, wine-infused evening! Inside in the first floor dining area has a great, fun atmosphere. Sort of a vintagey feel. I love how they play of old school Italian movies on little TVs in the corners. Gets a little loud, but this is a great place for a group of friends or a date. The outside patio is really nicely done. Great for people watching. We've sat close to the street before, but they have nice little planters that soften the feel. We have been here several times before- a reservation for a weekend is a total must! If not, be prepared to wait up to 2 hours for a table. Yikes! Lovely wine selections. This Friday it was a little warm so we tried a half carafe of the white sangria while waiting for our table to be ready. YUMMY! You could tell there was a lot of pureed fresh fruit in there.  Peaches? Pears? Citrus? So tasty and refreshing! Then with dinner we had a pinot grigiot. Very reasonably priced! The food here is great-small plates let you try lots of different things off of the menu. We love, love, love the linguine with clams! One of my other faves is the pizza with the spicy salami and fresh basil. I could eat the entire thing myself, but that would defeat the purpose of the whole ""sharing"" idea. The prosciutto wrapped, cheese stuffed dates drizzled with honey (wow!) are to die for...The only problem with going here is that you will walk out stuffed from ""needing to try"" just one more thing!

I'll admit I was awful skeptical about the idea of merging tapas-style eating with Italian cuisine, but after I took my first bite of the veal meatballs, I was sold. Delicious!  The price is right, the food is very good (not awesome, hence the 4 star rating), and the atmosphere is busy yet not out of control. I personally insist that you get the polenta fries and the linguine w/white clam sauce (the mushroom gnocchi was also very, very good).  There were two of us, and we shared every dish. The waitress was friendly and helpful, and had a great grasp of the menu. I can be a bit picky at times, and she patiently answered all of my questions. Thanks, Lindsey!  The bill came to just over $50, and that included two Peroni's @ $6 a throw. Forget the booze, and we could have skated for about $40 less tip. In today's day and age, you would be hard pressed to find a better deal for this quality of food.  At the very least, check it out.  P.S.

2011-07-07,3.0,"My experience at Quartino was the final nail in the coffin containing my former passion for Italian food. They just don't make it in America like they do in Italy. I came here with my parents for a late lunch after seeing it ranked #8 on Yelp Chicago. We were sat immediately outside on the patio. They advertise Quartino was a tapas restaurant, but the portions were pretty big. Value-wise, it's a good deal, but it's not conducive to trying several things. We ordered: Half prosciutto d'anitra, half sausage pizza: This was a huge let-down. I wouldn't say it was awful, but it's nowhere near the quality I expect from an upscale Italian restaurant. The crust was dry, the sausage was tough, and the prosciutto d'anitra was 95% arugula with one or two sad slices of prosciutto. Everyone raving about the pizza here needs to go to Pizzeria Mozza in LA. Veal meatballs Napoli: The best of our dishes. The meat was tender and moist, and the raisins added a nice touch of sweetness to it. Shrimp risotto: Just okay. I love risotto, but this was very, very heavy, so much that I couldn't even taste the shrimp and zucchini. Gnocchi: Pesto and gnocchi is a strange combination, and it didn't really work for me. The gnocchi was cooked well, but the dish was bland and unbelievably oily -- I couldn't get past the uncomfortable sensation of everything sliding down my throat.

The cocktails were rather inexpensive and although our table wasn't quite ready when we arrived, there were 8 of us and it was packed so it was understandable.  The bartender also bought our first round of drinks since we waited for awhile, which always makes everything okay. We ordered a plethora of tapas which came out at different times, but there was always food on the table and our drinks were always full.  We ordered a variety of dishes, my favorites had to be the gnocchi, it was incredibly rich and delicious. I had bites of everything and thought it tasted delicious.  My only complaint was the noise level, it was SO loud. We had a large table since there were so many of us, and it was hard to hear anyone across the table.  Once we were finished, I had thought it was going to be a large bill, because everyone had a few cocktails, appetizers, and small plates. It was really inexpensive, even for everything we had ordered... I'd go back with a large group just for the price!",0.971,0.844,0.121,0.034,0.4915178571428571
2011-06-09,4.0,"Definitely the place to go when I have visitors in town for the ""touristy"" experience (and it's two min from my place). The wait can be ridiculous so definitely make a reservation ahead of time. One time, I tried to make a dinner reservation on a Saturday afternoon for that night and couldn't get one until 9:30pm. I don't like to eat that late, but trust me, the food is so yummy we definitely kept that reservation.  I had always figured that it would be an expensive restaurant, but it's really quite affordable. Lots and lots of vegetarian options (gotta love Italian food!) and delicious bread. The pizzas are my favorite (about $10-12) and one is enough for two people. Definitely play around with ingredients if you know that you like pizza in a particular way. My only qualm is with dessert since the one time I actually had stomach space for dessert, the gelato we ordered had a ton of ice crystals in it. Not good especially when I think it was like 8 dollars. So I won't have another dessert there but that's ok because there's other restaurants around for me to get dessert at (Starbucks anyone? haha).  Overall though, I keep going back.

I tasted the Tagliatelle alla bolgonase and it knocked me off my feet. This is one of the best pasta dishes I have tasted. Perhaps having something to do with the house made pasta.

2011-06-02,5.0,"Went there for my second time yesterday and it is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. As others described, it is small plate and I would suggest  two plates per person. You get the most bang for your buck with a pizza which I've had both times. I like that they let you get half and half on a pizza with no additional charge. (I got half a pizza that was $12 and half that was $10 and paid $11). To be honest though, I tried the pepperoni yesterday and thought it was a little too greasy. While pepperoni is usually a staple of my diet, I would suggest being a little more adventurous here (such as the Soprano with Veal meatballs and giardinera.). The bread is very fresh, served with oil and parmesan cheese that you grate yourself at the table. Both times I ordered may favorite appetizer, calamari, which was amazing. Don't be fooled when they refer to it as a ""small plate"". It is the same size as you would expect at any other restaurant when you order it as an appetizer.  Yesterday I order the ravioli and tortellini which were excellent, and the time before I had the shrimp risotto and the vodka pasta. Most the dishes looked great so while I would recommend any of these four, I'll probably try a different two next time.  As an added bonus when I went yesterday, there is outdoor seating right on State Street which is great for people watching.  I noticed some other reviews complained about the noise level inside (which may have been an issue last time, I remember it being really crowded inside) so sitting outside solves this problem as well.",0.9886,0.824,0.15,0.026,0.45739538239538235

This is a good choice for your girls' night: They had plenty of seating to accommodate large parties and the family-style plating lends itself well to groups (and to sharing the check!). That said, when we arrived only 8 of the 9 of us were present; the 9th had been flying into Chicago and was delayed at least 20 minutes. The hostess refused to seat us until the entire party was available. While I think this is a stupid policy with a group this large (after all, they're still holding our huge table and we'd just be buying drinks if we were sitting there), my real problem was with the hostess' incredibly rude attitude. I went to explain the situation to her and she cut me off by saying ""It will be a while."" and then turned to the other hostess to chat, essentially signaling our conversation was done. We ended up getting seated when an unexpected additional guest joined our group, making us the full 9; our now 10th member joined late and simply pulled up a chair. All told, we were not seated until 15 minutes past our reservation on a busy Saturday night even though we arrived on time because of the 1 missing person, and any of us who actually interacted with the hostess was in a foul mood after being treated like crap. Fortunately our waiter, Peter, was out of this world. He kept the food and drinks coming, provided helpful advice on what to order, and even conjured up a cream-puff-and-banana dessert for our bachelorette arranged to resemble a certain part of the male anatomy. Food ran the gamut from awesome (mushroom pizza, asparagus risotto, garlicky bone marrow) to meh (chili shrimp, margherita pizza). Most dishes needed some salt, in my opinion, although I noticed I was reaching for the salt shaker more than others. Prices were fantastic. After eating a mountain of food and sharing four carafes of wine, we each ended up paying just $26. I couldn't believe how little dinner cost!

This time we had a 6:30 reservation but showed up at 6 -- no problem, got a great seat with a view of the entire dining room, and it was less noisy than if we had come later. Started with the salumeria plate again, although we've come to realize we're not in love with all the veggie accompaniments, so next time we're just going to order a couple cheeses (the parmesan is a MUST) and a couple meats. Cost will be comparable, and we won't feel bad about not eating the pickled peppers, etc. Then we got half-size servings (which they can do for most of the pasta dishes) of the rigatoni and the bolognese. The bolognese was okay, but the rigatoni was like HEAVEN. Even my boyfriend, who doesn't usually like creamy white sauces (alfredo, etc.), said it was the best! Highly recommend. So Quartino's is still a fave of ours, and we can't wait to come back and try a few more things next time.

We ate here for a bachelorette party dinner and it was the best decision of the night. The maid of honor had requested an ""isolated"" table (genius move on her part) and we were seated on the second level, in a back room with a tv that constantly looped a heavily-overacted black and white film. What makes Quartino's special is that it's an Italian tapas-style place. Typically I'm not a tapas lover. I like my food to be mine. I'm a fantastic sharer in most everything except sharing what's on my plate. However, at this place, they encourage sharing and it only adds to the experience. Try the pesto gnocci (I can taste it now), the cheese fondue (the best cheese in the biz), the penne a la vodka, okay - well really, try everything.

Seriously. Seriously a must if you are in the area and wanting to sit down for a couple of hours without feeling the constant glare of a demanding waiter and the one person in your group who has already laid out their credit card fifteen minutes after sitting down.  There is no rushing here and if there is, you are rushing yourself. And it's a damn shame if you do. With all of the constant commotion of people passing by every five seconds with gorgeous platters of food from polenta fries, too few types of risotto and amazing antipastas you'll get an eye filling that will undoubtedly make you want to stick around for awhile.

There is an old time classic feel to the interiors that makes me want to spend hours sipping on short glasses of wine and having long conversations with friends and family just like I would for a Sunday dinner.

If you get the opportunity to sit outside then I would totally grab it. What a great way to take in the liveliness of the city then to dine on its sidewalk. It wasn't much fun waiting for the little that we ordered. We stopped because we had a little time to kill, not a lot.

A lazy weekday or Sunday dinner option, parents are in town, my birthday dinner, girls' night out, date night with the husband - whatever the occasion. It's my go-to place because it's consistently great, from the food to the service to the price to the energy; I don't think you can go wrong.  A few personal favorites are the cheese plate appetizer (get the eggplant, beet salad and duck prosciutto), orecchiette with lamb ragu, octopus, cavatappi, and the zeppele donuts. Additionally, on my last visit I sampled some of the new menu additions and the pappardelle pasta with the short rib is absolutely unbelievable.

The menu, which features everything from charcuterie plates to pastas to roast chicken, really does offer something for everyone. And because sharing is the idea here, Quartino is perfect for groups. The menu doesn't change much over the course of a year - you'll find staples like calamari, risotto and pizza offered year-round. The restaurant has a decent wine list and some fairly nice cocktails, including a perfectly lovely Bellini. Best of all, the prices at Quartino are reasonable. That being said, Quartino is a large restaurant with two levels so it can get quite loud. Again, great if you're celebrating with a group, but not the place you'd take a first date or a business associate.

I had actually succeeded in dragging my boyfriend into the city for dinner, and we were very let down. So, I badmouthed this place for years, not quite understanding peoples obsession with Quartino. A group of 12 girls and I came here on a Saturday night in March for a quick bite during our friends bachelorette party. We had reservations, so we didn't have to wait, and they easily accommodated our large group. This time around, the food was spectacular! We all ordered small dishes so that we could share, try different things, and not get disgustingly full. I'm still obsessing over the eggplant parmesan - SO delicious, and just covered in thick, gooey mozzarella cheese, served in an individual cast iron skillet. I also tried some pasta dishes, the gnocchi was very good. The thin crust margherita pizza went over really well with all of us - loved the thin, crispy crust!  By far, the star of the show is the peach bellini. Pure perfection in a glass. fantastic peach flavor, just sweet enough, and they give you enough for two glasses - score!

2011-03-12,3.0,"Italian tapas in a ""New York Italian bistro"" atmosphere - white tile walls, hanging meats, a bit noisy, crowded.  Missed the Yelp event here so decided to check it out with my friends.  We all agreed that it was fine, but nothing much to write home about.  Arrived on time for our reservation and we were sat immediately - that was very nice.  As others have said, this place seems to be confused about who it's catering to - couples, groups of friends, families, they were all there.  It's too loud to be a good date joint, too crowded to be a great place for groups or kids.  Very reminiscent of an Italian place I once went to in the meatpacking district in NYC, which was less confused about its clientele - rich young professionals and artists in suits and mini-skirts.  This place was thankfully less pretentious, we didn't find that kind of person here, even on a Friday night. I chose the Grapefruitcelli martini - it was fantastic, just the right touch of sweet.  Highly recommend. Food - The Good: - pork belly - thick cuts of meat, thin apple ring slices, cinnamon apple compote, this was very good - fondue w/ bread - my favorite of all our selections, if you like cheese and you like bread then you can't miss this!  They offer other dippers for an extra fee (veggies, apples, etc) - antipasti: duck carpaccio, olives, gorgonzola - all were very good. The duck was a little oily but tasty and unusually good. The 3 kinds of olives were all very unique. The gorgonzola was the thickest we'd ever had, very creamy and good, less stinky than I thought it should be. Served with tiny breads, apricot spread, and some sort of jelly-like spread. Food - The Not-So-Good:  - mushroom risotto - meh.  A little too soupy, and not enough mushroom flavor for me. - shrimp - nothing special about this, shrimp were chewy/overcooked - calamari - also totally unspecial, served with marinate sauce so I missed the kick of cocktail sauce that I prefer - ravioli - heavy on the meat flavor.  I'm on the fence about this one, so you'd probably need to try it for yourself. Food, plus 3 martinis and 2 beers came to $134 plus tip.  A pricy night out for 3 people but not outrageous.   Staff was great. Tables were strangely laid out - some were way too close, but then you'd have a gap so big you could practice your breakdancing. Bathrooms upstairs, follow the ""WC"" signs (that's ""Water Closet"" for the Americans). Valet is $12, quick car return.  Not really any better parking options in the area.",0.9969,0.767,0.182,0.052,0.5178762414056532
2011-03-12,4.0,"I would have given this place only three stars, but our waiter was so ridiculously sweet that he elevated the experience to four.  Came in a group of four and ordered far too much: shrimp risotto, bone marrow, eggplant parmesean, tortellini, and pizza -- half with pear and gorgonzola, and half with veal meatball. Waiter accidentally gave us pizza with half of the four vegetables, and gave us a whole pizza with the veal meatballs because he 'messed up.' Throughout the dinner, he kept apologizing, and I think my table was charmed by how sincere he was about the mistake -- it wasn't such a big deal to us! But the food was good. Solid, if a little heavy on the garlic. I liked the eggplant parmesan and the tortellini the most. The shrimp risotto is a good bargain given how much shrimp is included, but I thought the shrimp had a weird seawater taste, and the veal meatball pizza was definitely the best of the three we had.  The restroom is quite interesting -- reminds me of a stark black and white movie.  Still not a fan of bone marrow.",0.9768,0.727,0.186,0.088,0.46089743589743587

But after my visit a couple of Sunday's ago with two of my girlfriends, that is how I felt. This is one of those places that you walk in and want to sit there all afternoon, drinking wine, eating yummy small plates, and having great conversation.....oh wait, that's exactly what we did! The shtick is easy - get a bunch of stuff to share. And that we did! We started off with the white bean and garlic spread, asparagus risotto, and clams. The bean spread was thick and delicious, served with a nice crusty bread. The risotto was, well, pureed asparagus just like it says. If you only sorta like asparagus you might find it overpowering but I thoroughly enjoyed it. And the clams were piping hot served with a really good white wine & chili broth. Just a hint of spice but not too much. After sharing a litre of chianti, we found ourselves a little hungry still and also got a margherita pizza. I love a good neopolitan pizza and this one did not disappoint. This place makes me wish I worked downtown still so I could stop in (weekly) after work for a nice glass of wine and some good eats. It also makes me kick myself and wonder why I am so late to the game on knowing how awesome this place is....please wait while I remove myself from underneath the rock that I've apparently been living under.  Oh well, I'm already planning my next visit and am about 95% sure I will be having my birthday dinner here (yeah, it's end of June but you need to plan these things early!!).",0.9963,0.764,0.22,0.015,0.5803639846743294

2011-03-07,4.0,"For those who have read my reviews on a consistent basis, you know that I hate those small portioned, foo foo restaurants that are all about the glitz, glitter and ambiance. I want good food and lots of it. The people at Quartino must have known I was coming. They put out a smorgasbord of food that would make the Buffalo Bills, offensive line blush.    My wife and I both ordered the $35.00 restaurant week special. The server warned us that the special was portioned for two people. Of course, I didn't believe him.     We ended up eating so many courses, that I felt like I was about to explode. They were all delicious. By the time our desert was ready, we threw in the towel and asked our server to bag them up.     The highlights of the meal were: The roasted bone marrow: I know some of you think that eating bone marrow is gross. Some think it's a activity that's more suited to canines. My answer to all of you haters is: Arf, arf, bark, bark. If eating bone marrow is wrong, I don't want to be right.     The Italian Fondue was awesome. The cheese was heavy, dense and filling. Not to mention, decadently delicious.      The Beef short ribs were truly amazing. The sauce was the perfect accompaniment to the tender ribs.     The beef fillets were small, but packed a major punch. They were juicy and delicious.      My only complaint about Quartino is the process of being seated. The front of the restaurant was crammed with people waiting to be seated. They really need to open up a bigger waiting area. I'm not complaining about the wait. We were seated in 15 minutes. But in those fifteen minutes I was kicked, elbowed and bruised.    Other than the stampede we experienced while waiting to be seated, I have no complaints about Quartino. The service was fabulous and the food was amazing.

2011-03-06,5.0,"Quartino is located on the near north side of Chicago in an area that attracts many tourists as well as locals. This was our first time dining there and we had an experience I've never had before and may never have again. The atmosphere is noisy and friendly (Sat night)--a big place but they take good care of customers and we didn't have to wait at all to be seated with a 7 PM reservation. The food is very good. It's not fine dining; it's small plates, Italian, and you can get away with a really good individual pizza for $10-12 or you can spend more and try various plates. Wine was good, nice beer selection, and you can order all at once or try appetizers, salads, olives, etc and then pick out some entree plates. We had pizzas, duck, potato pancakes, salads, seafood and it was all good. The unbelievable part, however, was the service. The waitress stopped by often enough to see that we were ok but was never hovering. Everything arrived fine except for some scallops. We were not unhappy or annoyed but reminded her and she apologized profusely, which was more than enough especially since the restaurant was very busy and we were enjoying ourselves and had plenty to eat. The scallops came and they were comped. And then the potato pancake came and we were told that was comped too. And then a plate with three salads arrived that we hadn't ordered, compliments of the restaurant. THEN the manager stopped by and apologized and asked us if he could buy us more wine; we declined due to rapidly filling bellies. He told us dessert would be provided--also comped--and in a bit we watched in amazement (as did all the diners around us) as  1) a bananas/ice cream concoction, 2) a huge chunk of tiramisu, 3) an individual chocolate cake with ice cream, and 4) six beignets with dipping sauces began arriving at our table. We were in shock (and shared our good fortune with nearby diners). All of this was comped, because our scallops plate got lost in the shuffle.  I cannot say enough about this place and we will definitely plan to go back, but folks looking for a good unpretentious place to eat and folks visiting should know that this is a great value and they WILL take care of you. It's not like we were regular customers or celebrities. They really wanted us to be happy. So go eat there! You'll be glad you did!",0.9978,0.757,0.199,0.044,0.545363247863248

We decided to stay off the menu and feast on antipasti instead.   Honestly, it started a love affair with duck characturie for me, cured duck, duck prosciutto (not quite certain of the difference - but does it really matter)?  Any place that offers the quantity of dried water fowl intended for human consumption with olives(!), that this places does is absolute heaven as far as I am concerned.

2011-03-02,4.0,"Quartino was the last stop on the Restaurant Week train.  Can I just tell you how insane this place is?  Walking in at 6pm on a Friday I wondered if maybe I had accidentally made a wrong turn and ended up at the Chicago Board of Trade, or perhaps that was the night Charlie Sheen had booked himself a party.  There were so many people crammed into this place I could not even tell you what the joint looked like. I remember some subway tile on the walls, some mirrors, and a flat screen (that played the single weirdest black and white movie outside of a John Waters flick I have seen in some time). Loud and boisterous, with much hollering and pushing throughout the whole place. Now, to all of you nay-sayers who complain about Restaurant Week being a ""rip off"" - that you are being cheated out of decent portions and/or high quality food, I say Quartino just called that bet and took all the poker chips.   Yes, at first you hear the word ""tapas"" and you think it is going to be a dish where you will get 2 bites at the most. Even our waiter said ""3-5 dishes per person is average"", and of course the RW menu offered 4, so it seemed like a no brainer.  Except, these dishes are freaking FULL SIZE and it seemed like a taunt after the 6th plate was brought to us.   What we ordered: Roasted Bone Marrow with horseradish gremolata:  This was actually an instance where you only got one bite from this dish. The bones are huge, but the marrow is very stingy and will fill up one piece of toast with ease. Extremely garlicky and slightly rubbery. Not worth the listed price ($7.25). If you want a religious bone marrow experience, I suggest David Burke's instead. Italian Artisan Fondue:  Fondue was slightly more watery than I would have liked, but the flavour was good and the type of bread offered held up and did not get sloppy and drenched from the liquid cheese. Garganelli con Ragu D'Agnello: thick lamb sauce over a quilted pasta. Enough said. Orecchiette with a fennel/sausage ragu: thick, hearty pasta with a rich sauce.  Not as good as the Garganelli, but a close second. Beef Short Ribs: Lovely, succulent beef that was spoon tender and marinated in some sort of delicious sauce. A fave. Beef Fillets with broccoli rabe:  another item that yielded only about 2 bites each, but by this time we were groaning from stomach capacity.  The meat was absolutely delicious, the vegetables too cooked and somewhat bitter. We then opted to take the desserts home, the Torta di Cioccolato (chocolate cake with vanilla gelato) and the Zeppoles (donuts with dark chocolate)  Thank god we did because those desserts were heavy, dense and rich as hell. We would have never been able to tackle those there. I am generally not a fan of crowds, but if I could go back here during a down time I certainly would.

The group that I was dining with had dined before and knew exactly what they wanted, so I just sat back and let them order.  The polenta fries, which were mediocre tasting, lacked that unique flavor that makes an appetizer memorable.  It being restaurant week, we followed the crowds with ordering the $33.00 course option.  We had the sea scallops, one of my favorite food items but once again - these were mediocre at best.  The caprese salad was well done, but that's also a dish that is expected to taste the same just about anywhere you go.   For dessert, we ordered the Zeppole's which were pretty great overall.  I loved the honey & dark chocolate dipping sauces and the doughnut dough was delightfully light and delectable. The experience dining at Quartino was exceptional and I'd love to go back, I just wasn't in love with their entrees.  I'll stay open minded and give them the benefit of the doubt...we all have our days off.

The food is delicious (special tip: all of their pastas and risottos can be ordered as half orders)- our favorite is the tortellini alfredo and penne alla vodka. The cheese fondue is a yummy blend of any cheeses they have lying around and never disappoints. Wine is super cheap and generally good. Chocolate cake is to die for. What really sets the place apart is the customer service, though. Any problem we've ever had there (pasta undercooked, really cold sitting under the fan, forgot to give us a to-go box, etc) was met with an apology from one of the managers, a free dish, and a coupon for a free pizza on our next visit. They also let us study in the bar on a really crowded night even though we were just having wine.

(TIP: Valet parking is 12 dollars) My boyfriend and I are visiting Chicago for the week and found this place because of its close proximity to our hotel.  The first thing I must commend Quartino on is the ambiance; it's cozy yet lively at the same time. We had the caprese salad and the pickled artichoke hearts arrive at the same time, both cold dishes.  This was a perfect way to start the meal because both flavors were so different from each other yet very complimentary. The caprese salad had a sweeter taste with its balsamic vinaigrette in comparison to the tangier artichoke dish. We then moved onto the eggplant parmesan and the polenta fries. The eggplant was great. It didn't have the overkill of sauce that you usually find when you go to your average Italian restaurant, the eggplant had a slightly smokey flavor to it and the cheese was just enough. Overall this dish fulfilled my appetite without making me feel like I was going to have a coronary. The polenta fries. Now this is special. The fries are great...what makes it great is the sauce that comes with it: a thick, red pepper sauce for dipping. My boyfriend and I loved dinner so much, we opted for coffee and dessert. We chose the chocolate, vanilla, strawberry gelati with berries and biscotti. We were happy we did. Overall, this place was great and we'll definitely come back here when we visit Chicago again.

The atmosphere is so warm and charming. Having just been to Italy about 6 months ago, I felt like I was stepping into a little piece of Italy right here in the Midwest. The service was fantastic - friendly, quick, with a thorough understanding of the menu. We had an incredible antipasti platter to begin the meal. They have meats cured right in house and amazing imported cheeses. You have to try some. We also enjoyed the quattro formaggi pizza, which was a very authentic thin-crust Italian style pizza. Ended with the donuts for dessert. Caution: These aren't just any donuts - you'll want to order more! What an amazing taste and texture experience. So yum. The restaurant was huge and the bar looked really fun. The upstairs was really charming, with windows overlooking the city streets and a fireplace in the center of the room.

Nothing new to add, except to re-emphasize CHEAP WINE!  They have a great selection of Italian wines, served by the quarter-litre (or half, or 3/4 (a bottle), or full), and they're all very affordable for a restaurant.  You can get a tasty half litre (served in a carafe, about 3-4 glasses worth) for $10-15, and some whole bottles only cost $18 or so. So go for a decent Italian meal where you can actually afford wine.  But maybe don't expect stunning food.  It was all good, but not great.  Gnocchi had an arugula (sp?) pesto instead of basil, and I wasn't a fan.  But the tomato soup was hearty and cheap, and the risottos were good.

On the bright side: The hot chocolate cake with ice cream was deliciouso!

Our waiter, Detroit, graced us with free Lemoncello shots (we have no idea what his real name is, but we do know he's from Detroit - alas, the genius nickname).  Quartino's was excellent about accomodating our large group, and the service was impressively attentive throughout the evening (for 18 people, I was thoroughly impressed).

I never expected a restaurant to be so attentive to customers' reviews.  I must say, it was great that I did give Quartino another shot. The food was really great, the service was fantastic and the wine was divine.  I highly recommend the broschetta, the garlic shrimp, the Italian sausage and the shrimp rissotto.

Even when my wife didn't like a dish she ordered, our server, which I wish I would have asked him his name to give him some props here, simply took the dish away, didn't charge us for it, and offered her something else to try. No big deal. No odd looks. No drama. Easy peasy. Very thankful for that. The food in general is tasty. Nothing amazing stood out but nothing caused me to be dissapointed.

2010-10-16,4.0,"I'll go with the masses here and give Quartino 4 stars, because I enjoyed my meal and I would return. Both qualifiers for at least 4 stars. I Yelped Quartino before we decided on it for dinner the night after I ran the Chicago Marathon (a Sunday). It didn't sound like the BEST option but we didn't want to wait long and we wanted to eat somewhere within the hour. Hence, the celestial union between Quartino and our little group manifested itself. We were out of towners, but worldly ones who live in Boston, so I don't rate this place with an Applebee's / Oilve Garden perspective. This place looks far classier on the outside than it ends up being. It has a more welcoming rustic, European countryside feel inside. I got the feeling the food was not freshly prepared, as in, it is prepackaged stuff that they heat up, or they make it in big batches ahead of time. That being said, it was still very tasty, so I'm not sure exactly how it works. We got some bread (cold, not heated) which was okay. Olive oil only on the table for dipping (no cheese, no spices). We chomped away on that while I ordered some wine and we looked over the menu. We each got our own pasta dish, although they stress ordering together and sharing the dishes here ""tapas style"".  It's called ""tapas"" but it is not Spanish food. It's Italian food, and there are pizzas. So I think Quartino is a tad confused and can't quite decide whether they want to be Italian or Spanish or tapas or not.... The food was good and I would revisit, as I said. I would say, though, that the prices are too high for the portions and quality of food you receive. Too pricey. Maybe it was the downtown State Street location? One thing that threw me: the way you order the wine. You order it by the pint or something weird like that. I thought I was looking at 1/4, 1/2 or full as a glass - and thinking, this must be some pretty damn good wine, because it was $20+ for a glass! Turns OUT that those ratios, on the menu there, they represent the portion of a pint pitcher you get. So... full = 480 mL = 16 ounces = 2 cups = about 1 and 1/2 ""normal"" glasses of wine. On top of all this confusion, you drink your wine out of what looks like a scotch glass. I was so thrown.... I would like to go to Quartino again. Because of how confused they are about who they are supposed to be though, I can't say they beat out any other normal Italian or normal Spanish tapas restaurants I've been to. Wait: Made a reservation, so none, but looked like you could have walked in. Food: Enjoyed, but again, something weird about it...not made to-order. Service: Extremely friendly hostess and waiter. Quick, attentive and knowledgeable of the menu. Atmosphere: Laid back, relaxing atmosphere. Welcoming and comfortable. Mostly groups of people celebrating one thing or another. Not a couples or singles type of place from what I saw, I could see dates happening here though.",0.9736,0.823,0.102,0.075,0.5052893518518516

We ordered Artichokes  campobasso: baby artichokes, onions carrots and EVOO  Roasted beet salad: ricotta salata and walnuts (Really like this one) Sicilian caponata: eggplant salad olives and capers (Nothing too special, Trader Joe's has an identical Caponata.) Salumi. Sopressata: Spicy Calabrian Sausage (Yum) Prosciutto di Parma: Italian Ham aged 18months (Who doesn't like prosciutto?) FORMAGGI: Asiago Vecchio: Cows milk sharp tangy semi hard  Fontina Val D'Aosta : cows milk,creamy rich sweet semi soft.  OLIVES: Gaeta Liguarian, San Guiliano Basano My favorite: Sicilian oil cured. Amazing olives! I know that sounds weird but I've always been a fan of anything pickled or cured. Polenta fries with the roasted red pepper sauce were served very hot right out of the fryer. We had to let them sit for awhile but they were pretty decent. I would have been happier with a different sauce for dipping though.  Ordered the roasted baby octopus with braised escarole red chili and EVOO. By far this was my favorite thing we ordered. It was amazing. You need to try the Octopus. Cavatelli was another favorite it was very good with fresh basil. Just an authentic tasting pasta dish.

Ravioli stuffed with braised pork with speck and fava beans here and the pizza on top of it all. Yep, we eat a lot. But, this was probably too much for us. We realized at that point we would have some leftovers. So we grazed and sampled what we had. The tomato salad and pasta were the best things we had. The huge chunks of cheese were really good too. The broccoli was basic and disappointing, could've used more garlic. We were hungry for pizza, sadly it was one of the worst we've had in a long time. Seemed undercooked to me, which looked like how they did them, and an awful combo of bland gardiniera that hardly resembled the quattro stagiono we expected. I make better pizzas at home, quite a disappointment. The GM was attentive and swooped in to check on us and offered to get another pie or take it off the tab. That was a nice touch and we just removed it. The Profiteroles for dessert were a great recovery. Vanilla gelato, a tasty chocolate sauce and toasted almonds. Quickly devoured, yum!

She said the Bacca Rossa was good so we got a bottle of that. I think the full bottle was 30 or less, but I'm not sure. The pizza was amazing and I have always loved the margherita so we enjoyed it and the bacca rossa paired really well with the pizza. We finished the whole bottle between the two of us.

I had been to Quartino a few times prior over the years for work lunches, but this was my first weekend/dinner experience and the hubby's first time altogether. It was a Saturday night and the place was packed and buzzing! No worries, we had a reservation and were promptly escorted upon arrival to a cozy corner table that shared a booth bench with the adjacent table. I was skeptical about the size of our table, but it proved to work out. The server we had was marvelous! He was super-attentive throughout the dinner. He explained how we should order several plates to share and that everything comes out as it is ready. We had scoped out the menu prior so we already had our menu for the night picked out: Caprese salad, Gnocchi with arugula pesto, Short ribs with salsa verde, and, of course, a bottle to share of the house red wine. The Caprese salad was amazing! Something about the balsamic syrup makes those raw tomatoes (I never eat raw tomatoes) tasty and addictive, not to mention fresh mozzarella being one of my favorite things in the world. I already remembered that the gnocchi was one of my favorites from a previous visit, so it did not disappoint on this occasion, either. The short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth-tender-fantastic! Did not really notice the salsa verde, but the meat spoke for itself anyway.  We finished the evening with dessert--the torta al cioccolato with vanilla ice cream. Oh man, heaven! Any time you pair hot chocolate cake with ice cream, it is a winner. This cake was wonderfully moist and melty and the ice cream was just perfect. I am almost drooling thinking about it. It was truly a memorable birthday dinner for me. I have to hand it to the staff at Quartino--even though the place is packed and noisy, it's still a wonderful experience.

I love the concept of Italian tapas...perfect portions to try and sample everything.  Prices are a little high but nothing out of control. The only funny story I have is that we were sitting outside on the patio and our pizza we ordered was up on the stand , and we were sitting closer to the street as opposed to closer to the restaurant...a homeless lady walked by and told us she loved our pizza and would like a slice...thankfully my friend shooed her away (my pathetic self was just about to tell her, aww sure why not)...

2010-09-13,4.0,"We came here for a large birthday celebration on Saturday night (9 people).  We picked Quartinos because of its reasonable price, the restaurant works for big parties, and I like the idea that you don't just ""go in and go out"".  *Be sure to have a reservation - even if you are a smaller group.* First, the bad/annoying item: my boyfriend got a call confirming the reservation and the girl was a bit  rude demanding that we all be there on time to get seated and ""if the number changes, you must call prior to arrival.""  I know why they call, the tone/delivery just really annoyed me (-.5 star).  With a large group, we had multiple servers.  Compared to being there with a smaller group, the service was a bit sporadic.  Sometimes they were around all the time and sometimes no one in sight.  Yet, they were all still friendly and helpful. With a larger group you can try a lot more items.  You can also ""share"" more wine, but we've never had a problem with a smaller group killing the big liter.  I really liked the the Tortellini, Veal Skirt Steak, Sea Scallops, Fontina Cheese, Calamari.  I was even brave and tried the linguine with clams (usually don't like clams) and it was better than I was expecting. In terms of the pizza, we tried the Four Cheese which was okay, but I really prefer the Margherita.  The Penne Vodka and the Farmhouse Chicken were average - I'd probably try something else the next time.  Every time I come here, they are ""sold out"" of the Lasagna - that wants me to try it even more!    All in all, we punished LOTS of food and drinks with it being roughly $50/person (incl. a good tip).  4.5 stars for this time.

Ok, that's not an absolute:  -We will share things we don't like.  -We will gladly share things we really like, as long as it's with people we like.  -We will pretend to gladly share things we like with those we don't really like (although we'll secretly want to stab them with our fork).  Somehow, despite my feelings about sharing, I love tapas.  My friend planned her birthday dinner here; dining with a group of 9 ensured that we were able to taste a nice cross-section of menu items. In addition to the copious amounts of bread and wine I consumed, I tried the following small plates:  Quattro Formmagi - C+ (disappointing)  Broccoli Rabe - B (nice zip to it)  Linguine with Clams in White Sauce - B+ (excellent, but very messy to eat - ask for a spoon)  Penne alla Vodka - B- (a little bland)  Tortellini - A-  Sea Scallops - B-  Crisp Calamari - B+  Giardinera Romana - A  Fontina val D'Aosta - A-  Service was friendly, but a bit spotty; I think that was a function of having multiple servers. Sometimes dirty plates languished on the table, sometimes they were cleared with lightning speed. Sometimes dishes came out in short order, sometimes they were so delayed we wondered if they were forgotten.  This is not a place you go if you're looking for a quiet, romantic dinner; it's loud and the vibe is energetic. The plates are mismatched, the tables are close, and chairs are a bit uncomfortable, but somehow they've created an atmosphere where you feel comfortable whether you're dining in jeans or a fancy dress.

We started with a bottle of their house wine, which is a tasty, light, fruity red; and at $15 a bottle, it's a steal (consider most restaurants will charge $30 for something like this). Ordered a sausage pizza, wasn't very impressive but I give it a 7 on a 1-10 scale;  the Prosciutto di Parma was very delicious, served with sweet cucumbers; for our entrees, we ordered the Cavatelli, which is one of their homemade pastas, cooked in tomato sauce, with fresh basil and Ricotta cheese; the roasted salmon; and the Vodka Penne. Overall, the food was tasty, but nothing spectacular (the only thing keeping me from giving this place a 5 star). However, what made this place a memorable dining experience for me was the service.  Our glasses were always filled on time, food came out very quickly, exactly as ordered; our server was very friendly and checked on us throughout the meal, the manager also stopped by to say hello and told us a little bit about the restaurant.  Overall, Quartino is a great rustic style restaurant in the heart of Downtown Chicago, with fantastic service and great food at a very reasonable price. Our bill (1 meat, 4 main dishes, and a bottle of wine) was under $65 before tip. Usually half of that goes to a bottle of wine elsewhere if not more.

Perfect choice to get us in a drunk, giggly and gossipy state of mind (Girls just wanna have fun!). We ordered everything to share and started with a meat, cheese and olive platter. The cheese (creamy and delicious) came with scrumptious bread and a tasty apricot spread.  For entrees we split a margherita pizza (not the best I've had but good enough for the occasion) and tortellini in a cream sauce with peas and prosciutto (very rich! so rich and creamy I swear my heart hurt after I ate it. But it was delicious!).  For all this food and wine we each only paid about $30. WIN. My sister also bought 4 bottles of house wine from the bar to take home for $6 a piece. DOUBLE WIN. My only regret was that I didn't get a Bellini here. I saw this on the menu towards the end of our meal and the description is still taunting me.

The portions are perfectly sized and priced, and I got absolutely stuffed (with leftovers!) for a pretty good price, especially in this area where restaurants can easily fall into the too pricey and not very good trap.  Recommendations: 1. Make a reservation or get here early and have a drink at the bar, especially when the outdoor area is closed. 2. Try the pastas and the pizza - I think these are definitely the best dishes at Quartino.  3. Avoid the polenta fries unless you enjoy the taste of pure deep fried food.

This is what put us into our food comas yesterday:  Caprese salad (which was on the small side, but good for a taste of the mozzarella and basil), Veal Meatballs, Tortellini with Prosciutto,  Pizza with Pear, Walnuts, and Gorgonzola, and the Lemon Pannini to go with the above mentioned limoncello. Now, we were branching out yesterday, if you are making your visit there, you MUST have some antipasto!  Get the sampler so you get to order sushi-style (a card and pencil to check off what you want).   Also, pizza is probably not a great idea for only two people (too filling, variety here is the key!) I know it is on the ""Spendy"" side, but this is only two blocks north of the Loop.  Most restaurants of this caliber, and even lesser restaurants in this area, are easily on the ""Splurge"" side.  Quartino's offers fantastic service, casual dinning, no waits, and late night dinning.  If you don't mind the noisy Italian atmosphere, you can't lose here!",0.9796,0.857,0.109,0.034,0.6057471264367816

Most people talk about the food in their yelp reviews. I could explain how phenomenal the Salumeria Tasting was and that although we sat right by the kitchen and about three bachelorette parties, we were too focused on our food and laughing to notice much else. But what stood out to me was the service and hospitality of Quartinos. Being in the industry, I understand the importance of making the customer enjoy every aspect of their experience- from walking into the door to signing the bill and waving goodbye. While we were finishing our last olives and slices of cheese, a server assistant sort of bumped into my dad's chair while he was carrying dishes back to the kitchen (no big deal, dad works in the industry, too, and wasn't bothered by it). Less than 30 seconds later, our sweet waitress had a shocked look on her face while she was standing behind my dad. Um... ma'am?  Apparently the SA had spilt some melted ice cream on my dad's back during the run-in and she was quick to wipe it off my dad, then to clean up the floor around the table. I couldn't count how many times she asked if he was alright and how sorry she was. To make the experience more entertaining, she then offered to buy our dessert since someone else's had been spilt on us. Sweet. So we got our menus and began to look over. Then the manager came out and apologized as well, then gave us his card if we need anything (like therapy or a massage to deal with the stress of our meal).. Now that was unnecessary but really showed that they wanted to make sure we were happy customers and enjoyed the rest of our evening.

With that said, the food was very good, the prices are very reasonable considering its location, great selection of wine and food, and great service.  We arrived 20 minutes prior to our reservation time, and despite the hour and a half wait for walk-ins, we were seated immediately. Our first impression in the main dining room was the HEAT- 81 degrees according to the thermostat on their wall! Diners were fanning themselves while they ate at their cramped tables, and the staff stated that it was the number of patrons and not a problem with the air conditioning that caused the high temperature.  Our server was great- very attentive and helpful while allowing us to order at our own pace. Throughout most of the meal the three of us were rarely able to hear what the other was saying due to the non-stop noise- between the open kitchen off the dining room and the overall number of patrons.

We had taken a cab to a certain restaurant, whose name shall remain disclosed, and after discovering it was in the middle of a shopping center in a shady area we decided to ask the cab driver to take us back. I tell you this because it was about 8:30 when we got back, and we were famished.  We walked down the street from the hotel, walked by Weber Grill Restaurant and it looked packed. We then popped into other restaurants with long waits. Quartino, as packed as it was, my dad worked the system and we get seated. We waited a while for a waiter but we were happy to have a table.  Our waitress comes around and gives us a little background of the menu and how it works. She was really nice and helpful. We were a little confused but we just decided to go with it and order 2 small plates each and pick at each others choices. Mom ordered the Beef Carpaccio, and the Cavatelli. Dad ordered the Shrimp Risotto and the Veal Milanese. I ordered the Farmhouse Chicken and the Grilled Zucchini. Note: the zucchini dish was more like a zucchini rollatini without cheese but stuffed with crushed sun-dried tomatoes (so good)! Everybody's decisions were delicious. And the method that we chose, ordering 2 per person (as if we were feeding ourselves) and picking at each others, worked out great! For dessert, Mom eyed the Zeppole, which gave her some memories of the boardwalk she and my dad went to years ago. We all shared it as well as ordered cappuccinos. Wonderful!

2010-07-21,2.0,"We went here on a friends suggestion. Another friend declined to come, stating this is the most over-rated place in Chicago. I agree with the second friend. Food was bland and severly lacked spices. The tomato sauce had NO flavor. The tables were extremely small, which is frusterating given it is a tapas place and you tend to have many plates on your table at once. Prices were expensive, around $7 - $10 per plate. Most tapas places I've been to average $5 - $7 per plate. We go tthe veal sliders - covered in bland, tastless tomato sauce so you couldn't taste the veal at all. The sliders were accompanied by a picked veggie salad, which actually had some flavor, but was just okay. We got the eggplant parmesan, which was covered in cheese and the tasteless tomato sauce, the clams, which was the best thing all evening, th beet salad, which had a weird dressing on it, making the dish a bit slimy. We got a pasta dish with apples and nuts and gorgonzola, and again, it lacked flavor. I'm not really sure how gorgonzola can lack pizazz, but they managed it. I got a savignon blanc wine, which was good. I liked that you could get different size wine carafes - quarter, half and full. Bread they served was just okay - didn't taste like fresh baked bread, which they advertised it to be. Meal was $56 before tip. I would spend my money elsewhere. Service was a 2 out of 5. They almost dropped the entire thing of steaming hot clams, with sauce, on me and my purse. Luckily, they caught it. We often had to ask for our water to be refilled, and many times the waitstaff were problem serving in the middle of the outdoor patio (instead of at the servers station, a mere 10 feet away).",0.8795,0.842,0.093,0.065,0.5493055555555556

2010-07-19,4.0,"This is probably one of the best tapas bar I've ever been to!!!  We had a group of 5 and decided to check this place out because of all of the wonderful feedback that you guys posted and I'm so glad that we did!! Don't be fooled by the appearance when you first walk in because this place can definitely pack A LOT of people!  We arrived at this place around 7ish on Wednesday night for dinner and waited about 20 minutes for a table. They were really busy and we were literally drooling when we saw the amazing food on everyone's table. They have 2 bars (upstairs/downstairs) and an extensive wine list at reasonable prices. The decor is really cute and we felt very cozy. Our table was near the back corner so we felt very snug in our group even though the place was very loud!  For Food Dishes, we ordered the following items:  1. Grilled baby octopus - I thought the dish was good if you like octopus. I'm not a super big fan of octopus, but it was flavorful and the veggies gave it a nice touch.  2. Steamed Clams - Very good! Highly recommended if you like clams. They give you a pretty large portion and the broth that they steam it with is very flavorful and delicious!!  3. Quattro Stagion - Vegetable Pizza - The pizza was thin crust and a lot bigger than what I would expect for a tapas joint. I thought it was OK, but I was actually really stuffed so I only had about 1/2 a slice. It sounds a lot more tasty on the menu then what we actually got.  4. Penne alla vodka with sausage - Delicious Delicious dish! I'm so glad that we added the sausage which gave this pasta a really good flavor. Be warned that there were some parts of the dish that had more concentration of vodka, but it was soooo good! I highly recommend this one too!  5. Pappardelle con Cavolfiori - Mehhhh... nobody in our group really liked this dish. The noodles are very large and thick and the sauce base had a thick consistency. They only gave a little bit of walnuts and apples and at the end of the night, the waiter saw that we barely touched the dish. When we confessed that we didn't really like it, he ended up taking it off the bill! Isn't that awesome?!! :)  6. Mushroom Risotto - Love this dish!! It's really creamy and the rice is not too mushy. Lots of mushrooms in here and just really addicting! I think I could finish off the whole plate myself :X  7. Caprese - I thought the cheese was really milky for my taste buds. I mean, I love cheese, but I didn't care too much for this one. Also, I thought they were a little skimpy on the vinaigrette. I probably wouldn't get this again.  8. Crispy Calamari - Pretty darn good calamari. Very crispy and flavorful as well! I didn't even need to add sauce!! Yum....  Wines:  1. Pinot Grigio - Pinot is pinot. Good wine :)  2. Rosso - I'm not big on red wine, but this one was light and went well with our food and super cheap!  Dessert  1. Coppa al banana - Generous portions of vanilla ice cream with biscotti and caramelized banana. The biscotti was a little bit chewy and not what you would normally expect, however I really liked and it was a great treat to end our dinner!  Overall I loved 4 out of the 8 dishes that we got and the dessert was kick ass! I wish I lived in Chicago so that I could try the other stuff out... but I'm sure I'll be in the windy city again!

I only give it 3 stars because I felt like all the food was a bit lackluster.  We had tried many things too: - bread: didn't taste very fresh, this is disappointing for an Italian restaurant -cheese fondue: I just did not like the cheese.  It tasted like it had some sour cream in it.  Still, at $10, this is a terrific value. -pizza: thin crust, and not bad, but I felt like the sauce was a bit bland, and could have been more flavorful -polenta fries: these were interesting, and pretty good, but the red pepper dipping sauce was disappointing -prosciutto: delicious! no complaints there we also shared a few desserts, which were pretty good: -chocolate fondue: in contrast to the cheese fondue, this was good, and chocolate was (at least in my opinion) high quality. - vanilla gelato and banana sundae: also pretty good.  So, I'd recommend this place, if you are downtown, in a group, and need somewhere for dinner that won't break the bank.  It's a fun place to eat, and the food is good.",0.9962,0.661,0.288,0.051,0.5800000000000001

To be fair, I will state from the beginning that I get a small industry discount because of my job and the staff knows myself and my coworkers since we are regular fixtures in the bar late at night. But there is a reason this place is one of the top-grossing restaurants in all of Chicago, apart from the fact that it is owned by the Gibson group and they do great marketing. That said, I love this place almost entirely. I've had great service in the dining room, outside, and in the bar. Since I'm mostly in the bar these days, I'll recommend sitting at a table and getting Liz, if you can. She's a sweetheart. Food: The pizzas are tasty- the crust is crispy without being too hard. The salads are shareable and can be ordered in a half portion. The appetizers are generously sized. Between those categories, I am always comfortable ordering a few things and splitting them between the group. Don't be afraid, here or anywhere else, to ask for WHAT YOU WANT. I will modify a pasta or pizza or salad to better meet my wants and needs and they accommodate me cheerfully here. I wish the salad selection was wider and that's my only menu gripe. Why isn't there a delicious fruit-cheese-nut salad with basic greens?  Drinks: Full bar, reasonably priced for the location. I like that you can choose the size of your wine portion from quartino to full bottle. The mimosas and bellinis are great and served in customizable portions as well. Martinis are strong. Whew.  Ambiance: Warm and cozy. Outdoor seating when weather permits, old world charm inside and out with chalkboards updated with specials and wines, an upper level for additional dining and restrooms. Even the restrooms are charming with the old school Borax soap. TVs in the bar to keep up with Chicago sports.  Finally, how cute is it that there is a little market area where you can buy reasonably priced bottles of wine to go? That's a nice touch and a great thing for the travelers who stay in the hotels nearby. On that note, food is easily ordered to go and wrapped nicely.

Great when you've been trekking the streets of Chi all day, haven't swapped your tennis shoes for heels yet, but are in dire need of pasta. (Here's a pic of us, enjoying a girls' getaway weekend:  bit.ly/ccBIqQ .) For a table of three, we ordered three apps and a 1/2 carafe of white sangria. Sangria was really only enough for one generous glass each, and was refreshing if without that special ""kick"" nice strong sangrias have. Italian small plates looked small, but the portions are very generous. Rustica flatbread was the only loser of the bunch -- it was filling but a little bland. Onions were the only real flavor - not enough pancetta and ""grana"" on the menu (""grain"" in Italian) apparently means thin-sliced potatoes. A little off. However, the Cavatelli was brimming with basil & gooey ricotta cheese -- I could have eaten it all myself. The Orecchiette was also amazing, with a lovely thick pasta and spicy meat. Definitely recommend for the food, moderate prices, and even more so for the wait staff who weren't snotty -- even though we were almost under-dressed and we were in full-on giggly girl and tourist mode.",0.988,0.782,0.167,0.05,0.5251360544217688

Anyway, I digress.  I always enjoy this place.  I don't come often, especially considering the crowds.  But every time I dine here, I always walk out satisfyingly full and happy.  While this place tends to be better for larger parties, the two of us had quite an enjoyable time. We started with the meat and cheese- Parmesan and salami.  Both were delicious.  We also had the polenta fries, the shrimp in olive oil and lemon, and the penne in vodka sauce.  The waiter suggested adding a protein to the pasta, and sausage seemed to really enhance the already delicious pasta.  Those polenta fries are killer.  The shrimp was really good as well.   Although we most certainly didn't need it, we ordered the doughnuts for dessert.  They were really good.  I would have asked for the chocolate sauce to go were that not very silly sounding. Overall, we had a great time and quite enjoyed our meal.  Yes, the place is a little cheesy, packed to the gills with tourists and bachelorette parties galore, but I guess that just adds to the entertainment value.",0.9973,0.681,0.279,0.04,0.61280458671763

You MUST start with a bellini to drink.. and of course check out their little appetizer checklist (meats / cheeses / olives) which are terrific (a little pricy, but delish). All the food I've ever eaten there was fantastic. I personally normally do a pasta. A couple of my friends love the Risotto. Their pizzas are even fantastic! There is normally a wait to get seated, as they are always busy, but the wait is generally pretty tolerable.  Nice bar area, large dining area. Note: This place is a little different as they bring out the meals as they become ready - which means your dining partners may get theirs before you, or vice-versa.

We decided to dine on appetizers for the evening, so we got an olive plate, fondue and bruscetta.  The fondue was absolutely phenomenal, especially for a restaurant that doesn't specialize in fondue.  The four cheeses blended together nicely and we got a ton of bread for dipping.  It was really filling for two people and definitely worth getting for lunch or dinner.  The olives were very tasty and the bruscetta was a nice end to the meal.  Fresh and topped with a lot of basil, which is super tasty. I really liked Quartino.  The only downside is the location and thus the throngs of tourists that flock to this restaurant on a daily basis.  The place gets pretty busy later in the evening, especially on weekends, so arrive around 6 and you'll be fine.  We sat at the bar, which is perfectly fine and not super crowded and we still had great service.

I came here about two weeks ago for a college reunion with 7 of my friends. I like the hustle and bustle of this place. I also enjoyed that we could be as loud as we wanted and no one stared us down. Because in all honesty, when 8 girls get together, that haven't seen eachother in awhile, it tends to get noisy. Yes you don't get a ton of room to move around in, but it's an Italian restaurant. When have you ever gone to an Italian restaurant where you weren't all crammed in? For those people complaining, you really should have expected it.  The food also suited our large group. I liked that we could order a bunch of plates and just pass around. This way, we all got to try a little of everything and I left full, but not stuffed. From the pizza to the risotto, everything was very good and well prepared. The sangria was also very tasty, and I liked the fact that wine and sangria came in a variety of sizes.  Now, for the reason that I deducted one star: our miserable server. Now, usually when you are in a larger group, they add the tip to the bill beforehand. However, they didn't do this here, which was fine. Our waiter did tell us the tip was not included. I'm sure we could have figured it out, us all being college grads, but it was fine that he mentioned it. What I did mind was that he came back a second time to tell us the tip wasn't included. Ok then. Then, as if we didn't hear it enough, when the credit card girls signed over their receipts, he asked if we had included a tip! I mean come on! Rude and rude and bad service.

Justin S. pretty much hit the highlights and lows of our dining experience, but I will add a bit more.  Here's my advice for Quartino ...  I don't mind the loud and bustling atmosphere. It's fine, it makes me feel that we've really picked a great restaurant. What I do mind though, is constantly having my chair bumped and 2 out of the 4 chairs at our table not even accessible to sit at. Make it a smaller two top table and save us both the grief.  Waitstaff, hustling, but not extremely attentive. I hate having to flag down people for water. If you notice that our water glasses are constantly empty and you can't keep up maybe bring two bottles of water next time. And please, please, please don't come to the table and ask if we are ready for dessert when half of our meal hasn't even been served. Ohh, you are shocked it never made it to the table. Well, maybe if you would check back with your table then you'd realize it had never been delivered.  Flavor of items ordered (when they FINALLY made it to the table). Total let down. Beef Carpacio ... well this item never officially made it to the table as we were notified they were out of it. Calamari - not fresh and overcooked. Bigoli was served luke warm at best - just another disappointment. Pork Marsala, once again, not hot, pork overcooked and absolutely no flavor. The marsala sauce had a nice flavor, but the pork was obviously not cooked or marinated in this sauce. The antipasta platter that almost never made it to the table ... pretty substandard. Bruschette the highlight of the entire experience (we should have started and stopped here).",0.9885,0.768,0.166,0.066,0.5350793650793652

Our wine bottle had barely hit the table when three of our five ""small plates"" showed up at the same time.  Seriously, we were seated and nearly completely fed within 15 minutes - NOT the kind of pacing we expect at a nice place. Luckily, the food was really tasty and when the waiter realized our table was full, he came up and said that he would slow down the pace.  After that, he did a great job firing the plates and desserts. I would totally go back to Quartino. In fact, if I lived in Chicago, it would likely be on the short-list of places I'd visit several times per month. Order the polenta fries.

We (table of 3) ordered a mish-mash of all sorts of things:  margherita pizza bruschette shrimp risotto baby octopus beef short ribs steamed mussels The pizza was my favorite. The rest of the food was decent although very salty and not that amazing to tell you the truth. The risotto was one of the worst I've ever had - the rice was cooked but it just tasted bad. The short ribs were okay, not the best I've had. Also, the bread in the beginning was pitiful. It was cold, stale and not at all good. I would agree with the noise problems mentioned by other reviewers. You really can't have a conversation in this place because it's so hard to hear other people.  When I first walked into this place I immediately had some sense of deja-vu until I realized that this place reminds me of Pastis in NY. After finishing the meal I would agree that it's basically the same restaurant - trendy looking but the food just isn't good. One thing I will say though, is that the price is decently cheap. We got gelato and it was $2 which is ridiculous for restaurant priced gelato. However, after tasting it, I will say that it tastes like it's meant to be $2. Our bill ended up around $90...cheap-ish, but I think you can do better elsewhere.",-0.9451,0.813,0.069,0.118,0.5873333333333333

Ok, the grubbing for deals part was a stretch. Anyway, I thought the food was tolerable to good, depending on the dish.  Somewhat of an experience to eat in such a crazy popular restaurant, but choose your dishes wisely!

So, I do love me a visit to Chi-town, where there is delish pizza aplenty... although not necessarily at Quartino. The pizza here is just okay, and it should be much better than that. Tasty thin crust, but on the pepperoni version the cheese and sauce were laid on very thinly, and seemed to have melted into one odd, greasy and not very tasteful substance. I kept trying to figure what it needed to make it REALLY good -- was it salt? more of the sauce-cheese mess? separation of the sauce-cheese mess? I don't know, but this just wasn't quite it. That said, I like the space: it has a cool, tiled old time atmosphere downstairs, and upstairs (while it was not open when I was there) was gorgeous. I went for lunch, so noise and crowding wasn't too extreme. Small intro plates were very good - great prosciutto, cheese and olive selection -- and a nice choice on wines.

I'm sick of the ginormous plates of food you usually get from other Italian restaurants in Chicago so when I saw that they serve small plates... I was too excited! 7 of us came here for a birthday dinner. The birthday girl loves Italian so it worked out. We had a  6:30 reservation and we arrived late on a Saturday night. But it doesn't justify having to wait over 45 minutes for our seats. Of course, it would've been better if the waiting area (basically the space between the door and check-in desk) was more spacious People were cramped together waiting for their tables.  Anyways, that was the only negative experience of the night. We were given complimentary wine (2 pitcher fulls) for waiting so long, so after that, waiting was bearable. Two managers (I assume they were anyways..) came to apologize.  We ordered so much food! WE had about 10 plates, including a pizza. I loved the beef rib, gnocchi, mussels, and the chicken. But everything was good. We also ordered 2 desserts, the zepoli (not spelled correctly I think...) and some kind of fruit sorbet? They were good but not great.To keep it short, the whole meal, for the seven of us was $190, and that included tip!! We didn't pay for wine but that would've only set us back another $30 or so.

You will not regret this meal and if you do, you are completely uptight and impossible to please.  If you don't like Quartino, try an Italian joint that's 4 times the price and who spends the meal kissing your butt and perhaps you'll leave happy. Always a winner. Perfect for dates, dinner with the girls, dinner with the family (preferably Italian), and everything in between. Did I mention it's ridiculously affordable?  When it comes down to it, everything in life is a game of ""you get what you paid for"" and Quartino   will remain a staple in my life in Chicago. One negative:  Pizza with pears and walnuts...not so good.  And only snag the Stefano if you like it spicy!!! (as in sausage)",0.9866,0.702,0.19,0.108,0.6149206349206349
2010-02-23,5.0,One of my favorite places to eat in Chicago and its right next door to the Dana Hotel which is a huge bonus. Try the bar plates if you want a variety or sample what has to be some of the best fried calamari I've ever had. The caprese salad is also amazing. Great place to gran a glass of Italian wine and unwind at the bar. Highly recommended!,0.9738,0.702,0.298,0.0,0.5473015873015873

Arugula pizza and Wild Mushroom pizza for 10 bucks a piece? OH EHM GEE...

At the end of the night my friend's scoffed when we split the bill $30pp - this all including tax AND at 20 percent tip!!! Quartino's has consistently been a restaurant where I go to enjoy good Italian bites and house wine.

I think that there are couple of mistakes that could be made here: ordering too much starch, and over ordering. Make sure you order protein and order a little less than you might think and if you want more than go ahead.

Our reservation was for 6:30 on a Friday night and we were promptly seated in a private room in the middle of the first floor.   Absolutely every dish we tasted was amazing and delicious. They have REAL Parmesan at the table. Even the bread they brought us was perfect and fresh.  Hi-lights included the duck prosciutto and Gorgonzola on the anti-pasti platter... basically all of our anti-pasti platter consisted of simple yet well crafted items.. but seriously that duck... I'm still thinking about that duck.   Entree hi-lights were the shrimp risotto (highly recommend, it just melted in your mouth oh my goodness), gnocchi, tortellini with peas in an rich white sauce. I had absolutely no room for dessert but my family enjoyed that as well. Our server, Tony, was experienced, attentive and had great suggestions/guidance.  For large parties, try seeing if you can get the private room.  It made our birthday completely memorable and wonderful.

I didn't want to pick a place too expensive because then I'm that asshole girl that's a gold digger. But ugh what if he's the ""meat and potatoes"" guy and just really wants a nasty ass steak? Well, I picked well! I opted for Quartino. I'd been here before and knew the type of atmosphere and that it is tapas style. I'm not typically the type of girl that enjoys sharing small plates but I figured that picking food together would be a nice conversation starter. I also knew that it wasn't that expensive and I believe they have a full bar... It was actually a perfect place. For a Sunday there were quite a few people there which created a nice casual, no-pressure atmosphere. We did end up discussing our options and I came to learn that (thank god) he too did not eat meat. So, I didn't have to worry about explaining my finicky habits when it comes to meat (chicken: no; hot dogs: yes!) The plates were the perfect size. We ordered 4 and split it between just the two of us. We also ordered a carafe of wine which was a fine amount for two people, although I could have used another glass or two.

2010-02-09,4.0,"It's always a dangerous thing to review a place after your first visit, but I enjoyed Quartino enough to give it a try. My mom and I were in town for the weekend, staying at the Ritz right in the middle of tourist hell.  I was bound and determined NOT to end up at a chain restaurant for dinner on our second night - you know, one of those monstrosities that caters to the tourist crowd, offering up over sized portions that if you are a tourist, you feel like you have to eat because there's no way you're taking it back to your hotel.After much Yelping and calling the concierge a couple of times, we settled on Quartino - close enough to walk, modest enough prices, and options that ranged from simple to ridiculous - and were both really pleased with the choice!  Thanks, Yelp, for not leading us astray - in fact, for leading us to a really excellent option in a sea of awful, over priced, over sized alternatives! We were seated promptly in the large but very busy dining room, and immediately found ourselves a bit overwhelmed by our options.  The menu focuses on small plates, so the server encouraged us to order a few things to share.  Menu options ranged from a short list of olives, cured meats, and cheeses to small plates of rustic-sounding meats and pastas with intriguing fillings.  The entire reverse side of the menu was reasonably-priced wines - and I'm talking reasonable in any city, much less in the heart of Chicago. Mom had the tortellini with peas and prosciutto in a light alfredo sauce, which tasted like the macaroni and cheese of my dreams.  I hadn't really considered pasta, but was convinced to get the ravioli by the magic words braised pork and speck.  I might be a bit hyperbolic here, but it really was some of the best ravioli I've had - like little pillows of savory goodness, complimented perfectly by a chianti and tomato sauce with the occasional fava bean.  Mom and I split a caprese salad, an odd choice in the dead of winter, but just right with salty and soft slices of mozzarella, firm tomato, and a drizzle of a balsamic crema.  I also had a dirty martini - not the best I've had, but definitely good enough to sate my weeks' long craving. On the whole, a very positive experience.  We really enjoyed our food, and the service was attentive but not annoying.  I think Mom was a little anxious about the crowds, but even though every table in the house seemed to be filled (at 7:30 on a Saturday night), our food arrived promptly, our water carafe was never empty, and we were able to get out of there as soon as we were ready. Though my preference is rarely to eat downtown when in Chicago, for Quartino I'll make an exception.",0.9967,0.763,0.176,0.061,0.5246764442454096
2010-02-07,4.0,"Decided to check out Quartino after hearing many folks rave about it. Went late on a Saturday night (9-ish) and the place was packed. And I'm not talking about just a full restaurant here. I'm talking Outback-Steakhouse-in-Schaumburg-at-7 p.m.-on-a-weekend packed! We were barely able to squeeze our way into the lobby after getting through the revolving door. Once you adjust though, this is a fun little restaurant. The décor is really cool with a lot of old subway tile and an open kitchen. The space definitely has some character. There's a neat wine bar in the front of the building where you can go hang out and have a bottle of wine, or three if you go with a group without reservations because it will take awhile to get seated. The crowd is stylish, young, and good looking. I'd best describe it as Lincoln Parky kind of crowd. I don't think I've seen that many ladies with over-the-knee boots in any one place in my life (not a bad thing!). It's definitely not touristy like a lot of River North restaurants are. A+ on the people watching meter.   The food is also a strong point. This isn't heavy pasta dishes smothered in a gallon of red sauce like Nonna used to make. It's a ""tapas style"" situation where the dishes are smaller and meant to be shared. An interesting trend in Italian cooking.  We tried a few appitizers. Started out with their Salumera Tasting. Basically, this is a combination platter where you get to choose two meat types, two cheeses, two olives, and two vegetable salads. Went with Bresaola and Prosciutto for meats, Gorgonzola Dolce and Provolone for the cheeses, and Sicilian Caponata and roasted beet (never thought I'd order beets in a restaurant but what the hell!) for the ""salads."" The dish is sufficient in size to serve at least two people with moderate appetites and a little pricey at $25. But it was really good, particularly the Gorgonzola and Caponata. For the main dinner, I just had a sausage pizza (was feeling a little basic after the Salumera!). Very good and flavorful. The wine list is also reasonably extensive, and relatively affordable for a downtown restaurant. There are plenty of bottles in the $20s - not bad at all.    Service was prompt and friendly, which is a credit given how crowded it was and how many large tables the waitstaff had to deal with. The waiter was really cool and good about explaining things, which was helpful given the somewhat unique concept.  In the end, I'd highly recommend Quartino for a group of friends who want to spend an interesting night out. The food is very good and the overall experience with the ""intangibles"" added in is even better. I would, however, make reservations given how popular it is, and be prepared to spend a little money as it's not particularly cheap.

However!  On a random Monday evening, I stopped in and found the place quite quiet (relatively speaking).  Actually, Quartino was still pretty busy for a Monday night, but we were seated right away despite not having reservations. We started off with a bottle of their house wine (red) which was only $12, and an order of gnocchi.  These babies pretty much melted in your mouth, and the pesto sauce was super yummy!  From there we got an order of their roasted tuscan sausage in a garlic-olive oil sauce.  Not bad, but I liked their gnocchi much better.  A must try!  The total bill (plus a double shot of espresso) came out to roughly $45.  Not too shabby. The people watching's great!  The crowd here is very diverse from groups of rambunctious high school teens, to couples on awkward first dates, to old friends enjoying a night out, there's something interesting around every corner.  Oh, and especially the crazy floor manager who spends the entire night practically running around the restaurant making sure things are running smoothly.  Look out for him, but really... you really can't miss him =P So after several failed attempts, I think Quartino's was worth it.  I'll definitely come back.",0.9903,0.73,0.2,0.07,0.5153368721225863

I always get a cheese and olive tray - comes with really good condiments like spicy grape relish.  Last time I was there I ordered the Montepulciano d'Abruzzo - a refreshing and tasty red wine.  They serve small plates and flatbread pizzas.  The food comes out as it's ready, they give you bar towels and mismatched silverware, and oh yeah - quartinos (quartini?) are awesome!

I do give them two stars because they accommodated 14 of us and its kind of a lively atmosphere and its hard to find a place in Chicago focused on lots of passing of plates and sharing of foods.  So if you are not quite so obsessed with properly executing the basics of Italian cooking as I am you could pretty easily go here and have a good time.   Bottom line:  It is across from Chili's, just as it is across America, where it is known as the Olive Garden.  Though without the breadsticks I loved as a kid.

Our server was extremely nice and had my drink remade when I asked for more syrup in the drink.  Even after it was remade, it was still too sour for me.

2009-10-19,1.0,"I had heard people rave about how much they loved Quartino, so I decided to go with a friend last week for a week night dinner.  My meal and experience were awful...maybe it was an off-night, but whatever the reason, I would never return. We were promptly seated at a two person table.  First problem, there was a stack of 10 plates (I counted them) and a pizza holder sitting on the table...which meant that there wasn't enough room on the table for our dinner plates to sit on the table in front of us, they had to sit to the right of us.  I know Quartino encourages sharing, however, I'm still trying to figure out how 2 people could use 10 plates.  Also, neither of us ordered pizza, so I don't know why we needed a pizza stand on the table?  Either way, I'd rather judge a restaurant on it's food. Here's where I ran into the second problem.  Everything from the bread through the rest of the meal was either mediocre or inedible.  I started off with the butternut squash soup.  It tasted like apple sauce and had the consistency of a badly mixed smoothie.  After a couple of bites I gave up and hoped the other food would be better.  For dinner we decided to share the scallops and a pasta dish (can't remember the name.)  The scallops came first (about 10 minutes before the pasta) and after waiting about 5 minutes for the pasta to come, we gave up and started eating the scallops.  My friend had never had scallops and I offered her the first bite.  She made a weird face and said ""oh they taste kind of like chicken!""  That's when I got worried.  She was right, the scallops were so over cooked that they had developed the consistency of chicken.  The pasta came a couple minutes later and at least the pasta was cooked well!  However, I would have rather had Ragu straight from the jar rather than the sauce that was on the pasta.  I won't go into detail on the sauce.   I want to believe that I had Quartino on a bad night...but if this was a bad night, I'm not really that worried about trying a good night.  Baffling.",0.9069,0.821,0.108,0.072,0.4921703296703296

A friend and I are on a tour de force to visit all the yummiest Chicago restaurants so when Quartino came up, we happily obliged.  We made an open table reservation for 9 pm on a Friday and were seated promptly (despite the restaurant being LITERALLY bursting at the seams - people were actually hanging outside in the rain because there wasn't even space to stand).  We got a nice little table and after having a semi-awkward and semi-funny exchange with our waiter got our waters and wine ordered.  This funny/awkward dynamic lasted the entire meal and was pretty much the only thing that detracted from the evening (also, the tiny table and severe lack of room to have a plate, water glass, and wine glass for 2 people).   After the waiter brought us a red carafe when we clearly enunciated chardonnay, he happily comped the whole thing then brought the right one over (nice!).  The food came next and I'll just highlight the best of the best - the mussels.  Seriously the biggest mussels I've ever seen.  Perfectly seasoned and soaked in some sort of white wine and caper concoction and basically a spectacular, mind-numbing, nothing-else-matters-except-these-mussels life altering experience.    Everything else we had was also quite delish but I will take some time to address the desserts.  We ordered the warm chocolate cake with vanilla gelato and the fruity gelato trio with limoncello.  Both were stupendous ends to the evening and it was at that point where I was happily astonished that absolutely nothing that went into my mouth that night tasted even remotely bad. I would definitely consider going back just for the mussels.  But knowing me I will probably go back for the mussels and at that point I might as well order dinner, and naturally what's dinner without dessert?  Yes, I have very little self control when it comes to yummy food.",0.9832,0.829,0.13,0.041,0.45820393374741203

I crave Italian probably only once a year, and Quartino's food wasn't that impressive. But for that ambiance and the fact that we just had a good time, I'd come back.  Each of us ended up paying around $20 (food, booze, tax, tip).   Somewhat of note: A pitcher of white sangria was $16-- honestly, nothing special, but far from bad!  Also a quarter-carafe of the house wine is the perfect size for a couple of glasses, and a steal for $4.",0.9776,0.759,0.173,0.068,0.5316558441558441

We had a wonderful lunch - I love tapas, but prefer Italian food to Spanish so this place suited me to a tee.  All the dishes come out as they are ready, this wasn't a problem with 3 of us ordering a few small plates, but I guess it could be awkward with only two people, or if someone wants pizza and someone wants polenta fries.... in any case, I think Quartino is made for a big group and lots of wine. That's how Italian should be done, and I'll be sure to be back here to do just that! The food: polenta fries sounded interesting but weren't as interesting as I thought; we still polished the lot off... eggplant parmigiana was delicious, as was penne alla vodka, the veal meatballs came in a sauce that i could not stop eating. Even the table olive oil was great quality. All in all, it was a fantastic meal.  Can't wait to try to salami and olive bar too. AND - they have $5 wine for take home. No idea if it's any good (it is 'table wine') but good effort!! Oh - fantastic service too, considering the amount of rushing about they have to do to keep those dishes coming. Update 23rd August - popped in for a 'dessert' in the shape of a cocktail this evening.

When you order your entrees they come out as they are completed.  My Penne alla Vodka appeared first and one of the other entrees didn't make it to the table until I had already finished my plate.  In a casual setting with good company this won't be a problem but I wouldn't recommend it for a business lunch.

We were greeted by friendly hosts both outside the front door and just inside it. We opted to sit at a bar table, though it seemed like there were many open seats when we came in (some time between the lunch rush and the dinner rush). We planned on ordering a margherita for each of us, but our kind waitress suggested just splitting one (she was right, one pie was enough). We ordered the red house wine which is brought to the table in a carafe with unfrilly non-stemware glasses, and sold by the quarter liter (hence the name of the place). The wine was quite good, especially for the price. The pizza was very good, though the generous amount of cheese was simply American mozzarella, not the fresh mozzarella that one normally finds on margherita pizze, but the crust was on point and the sauce was noticeably better than the sauce at pricier, more hyped-up places I've been to. The pizza was good, but I can't speak to the quality of any of the other dishes since we didn't delve any further into the menu. The atmosphere and decor were really cool, and the bathrooms were very clean and have old fashioned dispensers full of powdered soap. Small touch, but I love stuff like that. Our server was great.

2009-08-10,3.0,"I wasn't in the right mood for this place, so I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt.  The food was good, but the rest of it really got under my skin.  I got an unexpected invitation and accepted it against my better judgement.  Saturday night in tourist central, on the hottest night of the year?  Reason enough to stay home at the end of an exhausting six straight days of work, but I decided to go anyway. As soon as I walked in, a wall of noise hit me:  this place is LOUD.  Then I stood at the hostess stand for a full two minutes--while other people came in behind me and were assisted!--before finally asking if someone could help me.  All I needed was to be shown to the table where my friends already were sitting.  My chair was broken, and I really started to hate this place (however, they brought me a new one on request).  I also had my back about 18 inches from a bus station and was constantly jostled through the entire meal by numerous staffers, none of whom ever apologized.  Let me say for the record that I did like our own waitress (Emily S.), but everyone else found ways to rankle me. But, the food has a good reputation, so here it is: Caprese salad:  B+; I love these things, and it's hard to do them poorly and hard to do them excellently; this one was solid. Crispy calamari:  B; good but uninspired; hot and crisp as promised though. Four-cheese pizza:  C-; I was trying to be less cranky, so I kept my ""What do you want on your Tombstone?"" jokes to myself. Pork filet:  B+; not sure what comprised the glaze on this, but it was savory and delicious; also served with thick green, red, and yellow pepper slices. Gnocchi:  B; nice and light, with haricots verts and some kind of plentiful green herb in a buttery sauce.  Great choice for summer. Zeppole:  B+; Italian doughnuts for dessert, served with honey; on the outside, these have the same texture and flavor as beignets, but the inside is very fluffy and airy.  Only $5 and a large enough dish for the whole table of six to share. One last note, about the men's room:  I hate restroom attendants.  Beyond being utterly useless, they make me uncomfortable, and I can't stand them.  If I find myself giving money to a guy in a public restroom, I had better be getting a lot more than paper towels.",0.993,0.766,0.165,0.07,0.5214926785418589

2009-07-26,4.0,"I had to think hard about rating Quartino, and it wasn't until I realized that I wasn't being as objective as I usually am that I went with the higher 4 star rating.  Innately, my pysche shouted ""3 star 3 star"" but we'll get to the explanation of that later. So objectively, as I oft try to do: Location: 5 out of 5. It's not often that I give a restaurant 5 out of 5 stars for their location, but Quartino's seems to have it down flat in terms of where they are located.  Easily accessible by public transportation (Red Line, 22 Clark bus, etc.) as well as the highway.  I can't speak for valet service because a)I did not make use of it and b)when I went last night it was Venetian night and it looked a little more crowded than usual. Bar area: 4 out of 5. Nothing really negative to say about this bar area, except for the fact that it was a little noisy, but then again, it was packed.  For my personal preference, I would rate it a 4.  If it were the middle of the day and not too many people were around, I'd probably upgrade to a 5.  Also, I saw a family that brought a very young kid to the restaurant - we're talking like no more than 3 or 4 years old.  And this was at night.  At 1030pm.  WHO DOES THAT?  TO THE BAR AREA?!  (this in no way impacts my rating, it was just an observation) Service: 5 out of 5.   All around, very attentive service.  From the bartenders to the bar area to the waiter in the dining area, couldn't complain.  Fast, efficient, polite, professional.  Couldn't have asked for better. Food: 4 out of 5. Here is where I struggled, because had it been up to me to rate the food, I would have given it 1 star.  or 1/2 star.  But objectively, it deserves a 4.  The reason I took umbrage to the food is because it's family style.  Yes, I knew that going in it would be a lot of sharing, and it was tapas, and everyone was supposed to order a few small hot plates and share.  Even the waiter suggested this.  Alas, since I grew up eating family style ALL the time with my Asian American heritage, I enjoy my own personal plate, unless it is dim sum, but that is out of necessity.  I like to try too many foods at dim sum to try to eat each serving by myself.  Sorry, I digress.  Yes, I hate family style dinners.  I hate sharing my food because if I took the time to order what I wanted, no one else should get to have any.  But I played along since it was someone's birthday, and did the family style gig.  A couple of options for the food: there are pizzas, cold apps, hot plates, soups, salads, etc.  But aside from that, there is also the salumeria menu (antipasto is the best I can come up with) that included olives, peppers, various smoked meats (prosciutto, duck prosciutto, various salamis, etc. etc. etc.) I think our table got a good mix of smoked meats, veggies, olives, fish, as well as a few pizzas.  The pizzas are different to say the least.  If you're looking for Malnati's or even traditional thin crust, this is NOT the place for you.  Think exotic, like prosciutto with grilled radicchio and balsamic.  It was definitely an acquired taste. Not terrible, but radicchio is awfully bitter.  And as much as I am complaining and bitching, the family style here wasn't too bad.    Not the best food I've had, but it was very good overall.   Pricing: 3 out of 5 I'm torn on this one, because some things are so reasonably priced at Quartinos, and yet some things were not.  Example: the house wine they had was 12 dollars a bottle.  Yes, an entire bottle, and I've definitely had WORSE wine than their house wine.  But at the same time, a half carafe of bellini was 19.  The pizzas were all reasonably priced at 10 - 12 dollars.  No complaints there.  But some of the antipasto options were 4 - 5 dollars.  (granted, olives were about 2, which is fine, and I'm not saying that there weren't cheap tapas options, I'm just using the higher price point as a comparison).  I think the moral of the story is that if you study their menu prior to dining, you can definitely eat and drink for a reasonable price.  Let's assume 2 people are dining.  You could have a bottle of house wine (12 dollars), split a pizza (11 on average), have one or two tapas (2 - 4 dollars each) and maybe a dessert (5 - 6?).  At the same time you could easily double or triple what I just quoted.  It's really up to your dining tastes. Overall: 4 out of 5 Final Word:  Worth a look if you have a large group of friends or want a nice romantic dinner.  They have an upstairs dining area that actually looked nicer than the downstairs, but this might have just been my personal preference.  I would NOT bring children to this restaurant, and I think they would have a harder time finding something delectable (to them).  The only thing I would question is their accessibility for people in wheelchairs.  Dining on the first level would be fine, but I did not see an elevator to go to the restrooms on the second floor.  Not saying it's not there.  I just didn't see it.",0.9955,0.814,0.121,0.065,0.44193817878028424

2009-07-11,4.0,"I recently decided that I would avoid any establishment within 2 miles of Michigan Ave. for the duration of the tourist season. Contrary to my personal rule, I found myself at Quartino on Thursday for a client dinner, and was pleasantly surprised. Very very pleasantly surprised. First of all, the place was packed--patio and restaurant inside--with Chicagoans. Granted, they were the Viagra Triangle/Gold Coast/downtown high rise crowd, but none the less--I appreciated the lack of t-shirts. I ordered the scallops, and would have passed out from culinary bliss at the table, had it not looked extremely unprofessional.  There is one thing that bothers me, though, and that's the WC system they have here. First of all, there's a bathroom attendant. Ugh. I always hate those. I do NOT need assistance putting soap on my hands and picking up a paper towel. Also, these attendants are always generous with the paper towels they hand you and it makes me just want to stay STOP! You're killing trees! I don't need an entire stack to dry two hands.  Next, this is possibly the worst-situated restroom I've ever seen (next to the ones at Faith & Whiskey. Go there and you'll see what I mean). To get to the WC, you have to climb a hefty flight of stone stairs (though I appreciate the exercise, the angle and smooth finish of the stairs are not stiletto-friendly) and THEN you have to squeeze through a throng of people at the bar who are scarfing down appetizers at a buffet. The bar is RIGHT next to the door for the bathroom, and there are people smashed up against the bar trying to order drinks. These people are not anxious to move and lose their spot in the booze-ordering queue just so you can go empty your bladder.  Otherwise, this place is great.

The highlight was the carbonara spaghetti. Everything else was just mediocre. Our bill was about 28 dollars. Our server was great even though we were quite indecisive.

It was delicious, that type which is a little crunchy when it is well done (not the mushy one you get some places --- nothing wrong with that, if you are into those types of pizza!!! but we like it crunchy!!!).  The wine was very good, the nice thing is that you can order half bottles, so it is perfect for 2 people.  As desert, we ordered profiterol!!! VERY GOOD! Highly recommended.  Over all, a GREAT place. Service was nice and prompt. Oh, almost forgot, we ordered also a side of prosciutto, goes well with olive oil and toasted bread (we asked for it and the staff was very nice to toast the bread for us!!).

The broccoli rabe was my next favorite dish.  It was cooked in broth with garlic and red chili peppers, which resulted in a green, sweet and slightly spicy rabe.  Usually, it's oily and bitter at restaurants.  If I were dining alone, I would have eaten the entire portion.  I like my greens! The margherita pizza was not as good as I had expected.  At a restaurant with such an extensive pizza menu, I expected a great, thin crust and just a sprinkle of cheese.  Instead, the crust was medium-thin, extra-chewy, and the basil was weighed down with a ton of cheese.  My parents seemed to enjoy it, though, despite claiming that they don't really like cheese! Cheese seems to be popular in the dishes here, as our orrechiete with fennel sausage was heavily sauced and then topped with a parmesan snowstorm.  I prefer a more dry orrechiete, with a lemony olive oil coating, sausage, mushrooms, and finely chopped parsley, but this was drenched in a creamy tomato sauce with sausage.

I got a little confused when I tried to order a glass of wine, but the waitress was very explanatory about how they only serve in carafes, so I opted for a quarter carafe of a pinot noir and it filled up my small glass about 4 times which I equated to about 2 normal glasses of wine.

However, while there were a few bright spots, for the most part I found myself longing for a change of scenery. First of all, I'm not a big fan of loud restaurants--save the cacophany for taverns and sports bars. The roar of this two-level eatery was deafening, and at first I found it nearly impossible to converse with the gals on the far side of our table--although eventually we all started screaming at each other, which only added to the noise. Secondly, I eat meat, but because my significant other's a veggie, I'm tuned into the whole concept of looking for the menu items with no dead animals in them. Turns out, there weren't very many--even normally innocent items like gnocchi and risotto included PORK BROTH, for some reason. That left the vegetarians and Jews in our party with only a handful of options--sucky at a place where you're supposed to share plates with the carnivores and gentiles. Thirdly, the prices sucked just a wee bit. I've been to many a tapas joint, and $10/plate seems steep. Even Ba-Ba-Reeba skews lower than Quartinos. Fourthly--and this is a minor one--I advise you not to look up at the ceiling, especially as you're waiting to be seated.

And it's shareable food concept is perfect for gathering and catching up with friends.  On a Saturday night- this place is hopping- noisy, people bustling about, bachelorette parties abounding- there was so much going on it was like a carnival. But that just set the tone for our evening which was light hearted and fun.  We had a reservation and got a table right smack dab in the middle of the room- which, while one in my party thought was a bad thing- I rather liked being in the center of it all (although my seat was not on the walk through like his was!) The windows were open to let in the night air and this room with it's simple wooden tables and chairs set a rustic tone.  We started with a ""build your own"" antipasti platter which came with prosciutto, 3 kinds of cheese, raisin bread and a variety of spreads to try with them. There is a wide range of meats, cheeses and vegetables that you can choose.  Next up we split one of the many pizzas that they had. We chose the mushroom which was really quite good. I could have stopped there but one in our party wanted us to try her favorite- the orechette pasta with ragu sauce which was as good as she promised.  No room for dessert- so we headed back to the bar to wait for yet another friend and to enjoy a glass of wine after dinner.  Surprisingly- the bill was reasonable given the amount of wine and food we had (about $100 for 3 of us), service was quite good given the amount of tables our server had, and the noise and bustle didn't bother me like I thought it might.  Valet parking is available for $10 and is the best bet in this area as the garages around charge more.  All in all- while this won't go on my list as a place to have a ""romantic dinner""- it is perfect for what it is- a casual place to grab some vino and food and catch up with friends.

As it turns out, another date wanted to go here a few weeks later, so I said I would try again and find something on the menu to try different.  We chose the all appitizer route, and things were better from the table, the service was nicer, the atmosphere was slower, weeknight vs. a friday night, and the apps were all tastey.  They did not have cesar on the menu, but they made one for me, large, be sure to tell them you dont want full little fishes on the salad if you dont, but the eggplant dish was nice, the calamari was fresh, we also had a thin beef app that was very tastey, and she chose a bean dip that she raved about.

2009-05-24,4.0,"Good Italian food is scarce in the high and arid west where I live, so I searched it out in Chicago when I was there for a conference. I'm glad I did!  Here's what I enjoyed at Quartino: Bresaola antipasta with candied mustard fruit Arugula and orange salad with sliced peppers Mushroom risotto, half order Torta de chioccolatto The antipasta was something I've never heard of before: Bresaola, which is paper-thin air-dried beef that has been seasoned with something wonderful and fleeting that I couldn't quite identify. It was served with, among other things, a spoonful of 'candied mustard fruit.' That, in turn, is a candied fruit puree of sorts that has mustard seeds in it. Really unusual, but really good. The salad was delish, and was beautifully presented. By now, I was practically purring. I was also about half-way through my half-carafe of wine (really cheap at $8!), which may have influenced my mood, too.  Thankfully, my server recommended a half-order of mushroom risotto, and I took her advice. When it arrived, it was steaming hot, packed with mushrooms and soooo good. It's creamy succulence was a perfect counter to the bitter / citrusy / fiery salad I had just finished.  For desert, the torta de chioccolatto was over-the-top. Like the risotto, it arrived hot and fresh from the oven. It was slightly gooey in the middle, firm on the edges, and served with a scoop of vanilla gelatto on top.

One of our entrees arrived a good 8 minutes before the other. 3.

There was only one strange incident to report....being that her show got over well after 10:00pm we didn't start eating until about 10:30, as we were catching up on old times and drinking our wine, my husband noticed a drunken couple sitting across from one another near the kitchen who were giving each other foot massages THEN the woman got up and sat in the man's lap and started FULL ON MAKING OUT....we were staring and practically yelling at them to get a room, without drawing to much attention to our dinning companion(who did not want to end up in a fight or on the news due to her employment).  NONE OF THE SERVERS DID ANYTHING ABOUT THIS. Finally we flagged one waitress over and complained and then she ""THANKED US"" for complaining b/c unless we did she could not saying anything to them??!!?!?!? WHAT??? So strange!

2009-05-14,4.0,"Wow, 440 review of this place? Holy cheese balls! I went here for dinner on a Wednesday night. The place was pretty packed! I'd describe the atmosphere as boisterous. The people were all enjoying themselves, so it was fairly loud. The tables are also packed in pretty close together. It's like everyone there is one big happy family! I found the restaurant to be clean and nicely decorated. We had to wait awhile for our waiter, twice. When he showed up he was nice enough though. We actually had two waiters, one of whom appeared for the first time halfway through the meal. He seemed nice as well. It didn't take long to get the food. Water glasses were refilled regularly, which is good. Running out of water is a major pet peeve of mine. They have a good selection of wines, and many of them are available in a variety of sizes: 1/4, 1/2 and full carafe and bottle. There are also a few available by the glass. Prices seem decent to me, but I'm far from a wine expert. The food, with one exception, was excellent. In case you haven't read any of the other 440+ reviews of this place yet, it's basically small-plate Italian. It's like an Italian tapas restaurant. Actually, I think most of the portions are larger than what you get at at a true tapas restaurant. For two of us we ordered a caprese salad, a pizza, a pasta and a risotto and we had too much food. We would have been fine with 3 dishes. The pasta (orchiette or something...I'm too lazy to look it up..it's the ""ear shaped stuff"". I know nothing says ""tasty"" like munching on some ears) was delicious, as was the Popeye pizza, which was loaded with baby spinach. I left feeling stronger then ever, and ready to whip some Bluto ass! The caprese was good, though not the best I've had. The mushroom risotto was a bit of a disappointment. It was kind of just a big brown goopy mass.  . . you could hardly tell there was any risotto in it. We didn't have room for dessert, so I can't speak to that. Also the manager (didn't catch his name) was very nice and helpful. We had some payment related confusion, and he was totally cool about it.",0.9929,0.784,0.17,0.046,0.5539508110936682

There are only four other groups in the restaurant and they seat everyone at tables right next to us.  Then when we order, I get that it's a small plate place, the snarky waiter made a huge deal about everything coming out as it's ready. Our fondue comes out and is very good, followed by our pizza, which was okay, then we wait. After about 40 minutes has passed since we first ordered,  and we notice our neighbors (who were seated after us) have calamari. So we ask after ours. The snarky waiter gives us the speech about how everything comes out as it's ready because...blah, blah, blah. Magically, though, after we point out our neighbors have theirs, it comes out right away. Unfortunately, not worth the wait, it's soggy and rubbery.  I might be willing to try it again in the evening when they hopefully have their A team out, but overall, I was super disappointed.

I was surfing this site looking for someplace fun and interesting to go for my birthday dinner with my parents, and I had typed in ""tapas"" and this place popped up.  I gave the menu a look...let's just say they had me at ""salumeria"".  (I will Englishify that; salumeria  = customized meat, cheese, and olive plates.) So yesterday at 3:30, I came in for my reservation with the boyfriend and the parents looking forward to eating some meat and a delicious meal, and Quartino did not disappoint in the slightest.  It's a cute little place with some of that stone-wall-Tuscan-style decor, a really swanky looking bar, and an upstairs I didn't see at all.  We sat in the main dining room, and I did not notice any problems with noise, but we also went at an off-peak time.   The four of us consumed the following:        *Salumeria selection of sopresetta, prosciutto di parma, asiago cheese, and the selection of olives.        *White bean garlic dip        *Veal meatball sliders        * Fusilli with red sauce, buffalo mozeralla, and olives        *The ""Stefano"" pizza (mozeralla, parmesean, basil and rosemary, and spicy italian sausage)        *Dark chocolate fondue with biscotti, bananas, and strawberries        * A carafe of malbec, lemoncello martini, and after dinner liquors (limoncello, orangecello, and frangelico) That whole big meal was like an ongoing song of ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MEEEE!!!!""  Seriously, it was the gift that kept on giving.  The food just keeps coming and coming. The meat and cheese is really fresh; they make it themselves in-house, that fusilli is to die for and goes really well with the malbec we were drinking by the carafe, the pizza was thin and crispy with a real punch from the sausage.  I cannot put into words how much I loved the fondue - the biscotti we got to dip in the chocolate was the best I've ever come across!  We got a nice tableside visit from Chef John Coletta too, who gave us a ltitle glimpse into the inner workings of Quartino; that's how I found out about all the salamis, meats, and cheeses being made in-house and the fact that they have three working kitchens.

Plus, at least for this San Franciscan, everything is really cheap!! More on that later... The small plates aspect is my favorite part of the dining experience here. Who doesn't love trying several different things? Its a good insurance policy as well in case you come with picky eaters or if any one of the dishes fails to deliver. We ordered: - caprese salad, which was very good! even though tomatoes aren't yet in season - fettucini, which comes with a red sauce, parmesan and whole cherry tomatoes that melt in your mouth. very good! - polenta fries, which were a bit bland and came out so hot that we had to wait several minutes before trying them. - walnut, pear and gorgonzola pizza, which was good but could have been so much better if they added arugula or spinach at the very end. Somebody tell the chef! - these fried doughnut things for dessert. They were tasty. We tried them with the side of chocolate but I think next time I'd go with the honey, which would better compliment the delicate flavor of the doughnut. Overall, the dining experience was pretty good. I did really like the decor and feel of the restaurant, which achieves an excellent classy-modern-antique feel that goes very well with Italian food.  I was most taken with the prices, which are very reasonable for a good meal. A 1/4 carafe (a bit more than a typical glass of wine) of the house red or white is just $4. Steal!

The food: every time we go, we get a selection of meats and cheeses from the salumeria to start out, and in fact my boyfriend always claims this is his favorite part of the meal.  They are fresh and served at the right temperature, and the accompaniments are diverse and heavenly- think cut grape salad, apricot jam, candied fruit, spicy fennel salad, and mroe.  The fondue is another frequent selection for our table, and we are practically licking the bowl by the end.  The pizzas are yummy (vegetarina is a particular favorite), and so are the polenta fries and the nutella panini.  The risotto is also a good choice.  The salads are the only thing here I don't love. Potential downsides: Quartino is usually loud and crowded.  I find that this adds to the atmosphere (a noisy, busy Italian cafe) rather than detracting from it, but if the noise bothers you, request a table upstairs.  Also, make a reservation if you want to go at a busy time!  No matter how busy it gets, though, the service is always good and thorough.

We drank up some pretty decent wine on the cheap. We got there about 10 minutes before our reservation and had to wait about 30 minutes in the crowded, LOUD lobby which was a bit of a pain in the butt. It was raining outside so everyone was slammed in the tiny hostess area together. Luckily, that was the only bad part of the experience! We sat upstairs, so it was noisy, but not incredibly loud like many people have said. If you're eating with a soft-talker, maybe ask to be seated upstairs? I loved the eclectic ambiance and lighted candleabras. The service was great, though he did forget one of our orders (the polenta fries, doh!), but we were full enough and didn't need them. We shared a bunch of the small plates and a pizza. The sausage pizza we ordered was seriously the best pizza of my life. I don't know if it was the quality of the ingredients or what, but I could have eaten the entire thing by myself. Flavor country! We all tried the veal meatball sliders as well which were tasty and the men's favorite part of the meal. On the good reco's I'd seen on yelp, I ordered the asparagus risotto to share and was pretty disappointed. My boyfriend's dad reached for the salt immediately. It was everyone's least favorite. We ordered a bunch of antipasti which came out beautifully before the meal with the many sauces, toppers, etc. explained nicely by our server. The caprese salad was good and the tomatoes were really flavorful even though they were definitely out of season. The seared tuna small plate we had was delicious and had quite a bit of tuna which was surprising. Since we didn't eat TOO much for dinner, we shared the zeppole (the doughnuts with honey and chocolate which were good, but very airy and not like most doughnuts. They were better with the honey than the chocolate because they were so delicate), the nutella panini (which I loved because it had nutella, but was basically two pieces of bread smeared with nutella and sprinkled with powdered sugar. Very messy to eat, though), the coppa banana (YUMMY caramelized bananas with gelato, biscotti and whatever else they could fit into that big martini glass) and the gran coppa quartino (another big martini class of gelato, hazlenuts and berries).

But this place changed my mind. PLUS, they have CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP wine!!!  Went here with a friend and we each got a 1/4 carafe of wine for $6. I thought I was reading the menu wrong, but no. I received a cute little carafe with just enough wine to warm me up on the inside and make me want to have deep, philosophical conversations:)  And this place isn't just about cheap wine - the food was outstanding. We ordered the clams in wine sauce - super garlicky and salty and we got extra bread to sop up all the delicious sauce. Then we got the tortellini in Alfredo sauce with prosciutto, peas, and ham - WOWSA! I would never order this on my own because I don't even like Alfredo sauce, but my friend convinced me to try it and I may now be a convert. The sauce was the best I've ever had - like the most decadent Parmesan just melting in your mouth. I honestly could go back every other day and eat that stuff. And then the pizza was great - nice thin crust with quality ingredients.

2009-04-04,2.0,"Chicago has had a surge of enotecas, an Italian combination of a bistro, wine bar, and tapas place. Hugo Ralli and Steve Lombardo, best known for their Chicago standards of Gibson's and Hugo's Frog Bar (reviews forthcoming), have entered into this hot new fray with Quartino, a challenger just a block away from the new Lettuce Entertain You enoteca, Osteria via Stato. Sadly, like many things Hugo and Steve do, this is more about show than substance, but especially so here. The tables are jammed together worse than your traditional kosher delis, with floors and walls that reflect sound everywhere, coupled with a fairly hip, arrogant, (and thus) loud crowd; in toto, it makes for a lousy dining experience. The waiters think they're funny with their pushy attitude; it simply doesn't work in this environment, coming off as almost boorish instead. The dishes were hit and miss in quality, more good than not (though nothing especially great), and forget about asking for anything done a certain way by the kitchen; it's clearly a production line that has a stock set of formulae and don't even bother trying to mess with it. Their marinated fare was perhaps their best; I had a housemade (or so claimed) giardinara that was kind of nice, and some of the dried meats seemed tasty enough. Like the patrons and the service, though, much of the food was brash, unsubtle, and overbearing. Example: sweet potato fries were big and overbreaded; tasty, but in a way that makes you go, ""okay, I get the point, stop shouting."" The red pepper sauce that came with them was nearly identical. Their true win is the wine, and the fact that they named themselves after their wine presentation sort of shows at least they're aware of what they're hawking. Moderately priced choices of truly average wines abound, in carafes as small as the quartino so you can have many choices on the table. They serve the old style diner water glasses for you to take small pours from quartinos so you can get little tastes of just about everything your party orders (and I'm sure this encourages a sort of ""endless drinking"" concept that reflects well on the final tab). Since I tend to dine with highly discriminating wine enthusiasts, we found ourselves with a couple of quartinos of almost drinkable fermented grapes. I think one of my fellow diners would have labelled it as ""good for kids"" (meaning people my age and younger) but not worthy of a serious (think ""your parents' age"") wine drinker's time. After a Friday at Orchestra Hall, if I need a Ralli and Lombardo place to stop at for an early dinner (as was the old family tradition), it's going to be Hugo's, not this place. In fact, I don't think I'll ever go here again... unless I have some friends who are just in love with the place, and I don't care if I can hear what they are saying during dinner. Pros: Trendy, easy mix and match of food and wine Cons: Loud, obnoxious, mediocre food Summary: One of the more disappointing new Chicago enotecas if you actually care about the whole experience.",0.9905,0.766,0.148,0.086,0.556409403200448
2009-04-01,5.0,"This was my first visit here as reccomended by a friend in town from Minneapolis. I had never even heard of Quartino until tonight. We were seated within 10 minutes in a gigantic cozy room. Cozy in this review equals super cramped. I ordered the pasta Pomodoro as did my friend and her daughter ordered the Mahgarita Pizza. It was a small plate of pasta and a 10"" thin pizza. The pasta was cooked a little under al Dente and the sauce was flavorful with hints of basil, oregano, pepper and loads of sliced garlic. Lots of Garlic. Very tasty. I also ended up having a slice or 2 of the pizza and it had a very gummy crust and the basil was cooked in rather than on top and there didn't seem to be any fresh sliced tomato which is the basic of a Mahgarita pizza. Prices are good for a downtown Italian restraunt, but the amount of food you get makes the $9 make sence for downtown. Small amounts, not over done and not so full you cannot move. As othev reviews say, this place is loud. There is no fabric to buffer the sound. This place was packed on a random Wednesday night in the beginning of April when there isn't much happening downtown.

2009-03-15,4.0,"I really like this place. Italian food represents everything that good cooking should be: fresh approachable food cooked with heart. And Italian restaurants represent everything that eating out should be: fun and casual dining delivered by a caring and authentic staff. Quartino gets it. They've really done a superb job of eliminating the excessive fussiness that I've come to loathe when eating out. Quartino knows that its food isn't the greatest. The service isn't the most refined. The restaurant doesn't care because it's not trying to be something it's not. This is why  Quartino is always packed. It's also why the dining room and bar are always alive with good energy.  Quartino's menu is designed for family style eating. The dishes are intended for sharing. So it's fun to order several dishes and sample bites here and there. The prices are very affordable. Half of the menu prices are below $10. Several dishes hover in the $11-12 range.  The wait staff is very good about recommending dishes on the menu. The food is always consistent. I recommend any of the thin crust brick oven pizzas which arrive on a metal platter steaming hot. The pasta dishes are solid. The tortellini with peas and prosciutto is yummy.  Order a carafe of the house red wine. It's a steal. On weekends, it's almost impossible to get a table. Just grab a table in the bar area. Order food at your own pace and savor the wine.  Quartino is one of those rare restaurants that manages to create ""magic"" in their dining room---the collective fun and happiness of a couple hundred diners brought together by good food, wine,and service at reasonable prices.",0.9907,0.78,0.18,0.039,0.4945098039215686
2009-03-13,5.0,"Holy Moly, we were in heaven.  It was Thursday night around 8pm and after bar hopping in River North a little my 2 GFs and I decided on Quartino- I had never been. It was PACKED but the wait list was only about 20 minutes. We wandered to the back of the bar area and found one lone empty table and grabbed it. We immediately were greeted by our sweetheart server and filled out our antipasto card for starters. We went with some Pecorrino and Gorgonzola cheeses and some Soppresatta and Duck Proscuitto. We also ordered the LITER wine, as surely a bottle would not suffice! The space is so warm and welcoming. Even though it was very busy, it wasn't too loud and the service was exceptional. Our starter plate came with about 6-8 little dips and sauces and home made Giardinaire which rocked. We were having such fun experimenting with trying to make 'the perfect bite' with all the little ingredients. We ordered a couple of veal sliders to share which were AMAZING and tasted like someone's grandma's secret recipe. And then of course we had to get a pizza and chose the sausage which came with some crazy good roasted tomatoes and lots of fennel.  I am not really a dessert person, BUT, after a big, crazy comfort-food meal like this, sometimes I go there. And I did. I went.  I let the other girls decide on something and told myself I'd just have A bite of whatever they ordered, which turned out to be deep fried donut holes with dark chocolate sauce! WHAT!?  Can you think of something more sinfully delicious? After the 2nd liter of wine I wasn't really too concerned about how many bites of it I actually had. I think it was probably 12. This was such a fun place. It was great that it was just a random choice to go here and I didn't have any expectations. I was blown away by the yum factor and great service.

2009-03-06,3.0,"When I made the reservation, I thought I was making it for Osteria via Stato, just across the street.  So imagine my surprise when I realized, as I walked up, that I had made a mistake. ""Oh well,"" I thought. ""I've never been here, so cool."" I went with my oldest guy friend's wife who was in town for the night.  Holy loudness, Batman.  We waited for 15 minutes until our table was ready & barely made out the host announcing over the speaker, ""C-----, Party of 2.""  It was all mumbles.  I still don't even know how I made it out. We were seated at what I only describe as the world's smallest table for two.  We were shuffling our plates & glasses around in order to figure out how to best utilize the limited space.  It was also slanted (or maybe the floor was) --- the olive oil started spilling out of the plate (y'know, to dip the bread).  Also, we had to make sure that we put tall items or liquid items against the wall because otherwise, we were in very real danger of having everything tip over onto us when people (a lot who were very drunk) walked past our table. Since it was so very loud, I couldn't hear half of what our waiter told us when we got there.  Something about meat & cheese sampler or, I dunno.  Something about bringing out small plates to share (we really didn't want small plates -I'm a vegetarian & she wanted seafood-, but since we were already there, we just ordered what we wanted & then didn't share).  Our waiter really didn't seem interested in knowing what we wanted, just in spitting out whatever his script said. Personally, I felt pressured to order super-quickly.  He just stood around as we tried to decide on a wine, while not making any recommendations on type, just standing there.  Then, when we decided on a bottle, he practically forced us to only take a half-bottle (liter? something about liters like we're gonna know what a liter equals). The two of us are about the friendliest customers you could ever ask for as a server, but he was just going through the motions, unfortunately.  When we ordered our food, he commented, ""Yeah, you may have enough to share.  Might get stuffed, might not.""  What does that even mean, anyways? Anyways, we got our food in piecemail, which, since it was small plates didn't surprise me, but since we weren't really sharing (not knowing it was small plates when I reserved), it wasn't so great. The portabella bruschetta was tasty, but nearly impossible to eat.  The ingredients were really huge & fell off the bread all over the place (since the table was so small, really, all over the place).  The broccoli rabe was ok, but man, I got a bite that was allllll black pepper.  The polenta fries were -eh- & the roasted red pepper sauce that with with them was less than eh. She ordered the linguini with clams, which I didn't try (she didn't comment on if she liked it or not).  I wanted to order the mushroom risotto, but it's made with pork stock (ew), so nope.  In fact, why is it that when a lot of restaurants have what would otherwise be vegetarian options, they have to use animal stock, nullifying the veggie option?  Annoying!  Anyways, instead, I ordered the penne alla vodka, which was the best part of the meal. For dessert, our waiter finally stepped up & recommended the chocolate cake with ice cream, which we ordered, although any of the options sounded tasty.  We got it & it was crazy rich, but good, nonetheless.  We were unable to finish it, however. When we were still eating our dessert, we were given the bill.  Even though we were assured that there was no hurry, our waiter hovered within feet of our table for the next few minutes, just staring at the tab.  The upside was that our water glasses were refilled about a dozen times between placing the dessert on our table & when we did leave. Wow.  This is long.  Oh well.  I probably won't be back, is the bottom line. PS:  If I were the owner/manager, I'd take a look at these reviews & change a few things.  Like how freakin' loud it is.  I don't agree with a fellow Yelper's assertion that restaurants should be noisy & fun all the time & that the only reason a person would go out to dinner would be to eavesdrop on crazy conversations.  What about, oh, I dunno, the FOOD?  Tasting flavors you'd never try at home?  Or having a quiet, romantic meal with a new guy?  Or getting together with an old friend to catch up while they're in town?  Just like there are different bars (cozy, loud, full of energy, precocious), there are different restaurants.  & just because someone likes restaurants where you apparently have to scream at the person you're practically sitting atop in order to be heard doesn't mean the rest of us do or that we're dowdy or idiots because of it.",0.992,0.846,0.099,0.055,0.5257771437316892

It's a loud dining room so if you want to go for a heart to heart talk and meal, this might not be the place.

Trying to get refills on our waters was a little tough but the waiter was very prompt with ordering, delivering drinks, etc.  This is a great place for a different kind of tapas...Italian style. We loved going to Iberico because of the spanish tapas and low prices, and I think Quartino really gives us an alternative to that - Italian family style dining for a decent price.  They give you a sheet full of meats, cheeses, and olives where you can mark the amount of each you would like and it comes in a shared plate. The meats were pretty good but my Italian friend commented that one of the meats was ""not good"" to the waiter (the meat was really dry and appeared more like jerky than cured meat). That was all he said. The waiter immediately sent in another order with fresher slices and comped us both orders of that particular meat.  We got a pizza bianca and the pizza was very deliciously baked fresh and flavors were well balanced. We also got the steamed clams, which were so so, nothing to write home about. The asparagus risotto was alright, it was tasty but again, nothing to write home about. I think we should have stuck with more main Italian dishes like gnocchi or more pizzas since I saw some unbelievable pizzas and small plates around.

We had about 3 1/4 carafes of delicious leathery reds that were complimented by the Tasting Sampler we ordered. It was amazing. Italian cheeses, olives, meats, salads.. all amazing. She even told us about the secret to life: Italian Gorgonzola + Apricot spread + Australian Melbac. Fucking amazing. You get to chose from a bunch of things for the $25 tastings, but I would recommend skipping on the artichokes (they are bland), and the black olives (they taste like chocolate + anchovies; the other olives are amazing though). The place is cute, they serve wine in cups like in Italy, and the all the staff we encountered was super sweet.  We finished off with some home-made Limoncello (highly recommended!) and this crazy lemony vodka milkshake. Seriously, $60 left us stuffed and tipsy.

Thanks Zack! My favorite part of the meal is the salumeri offerings that you chose from a separate menu.  If it weren't for the other tasty offerings on the main menu, I would be happy to dine on the salumeri menu as my main dinner.  Prosciutto, sopressatta, parmigiano regiano, and oil cured olives were served with tiny salads of fennel, red grapes, apricots, and artichokes.  It's so fun to take all of the different ingredients and make different combinations. Although the menu is designed to share plates, I took a more traditional approach and coursed out an appetizer (the salumeri offerings), salad, and entree.  My entree was incredible!  Tender beef filets served in a brodo of wine, garlic, broccoli rabe, and chili peppers.  It had just enough sauce to require house baked bread to sop it all up!  Mmmmmm!

We tried the cheese fondue (out of the world), that is about the only dish we would recommend.  Otherwise we tried the Veal Meatballs (bland with no taste), Baby Octopus (okay, but the spinach side had no flavor), Tortellini with peas and prosciutto (okay), Salami (we felt this was a bit old and not very fresh), and finally ordered a pepperoni pizza as we felt we could not go wrong.

2009-01-02,1.0,"Awful, just awful experience.  My friend was in town from LA to celebrate her birthday and some other guests recommended Quartino. So one of the other people made a reservation for 10 people at 9pm. I was running late thinking it was no biggie. What they hadn't told the person who made the reservation was that they won't seat you without your full party. So my friend sent me a text to let me know that and I called the restaurant. They were pretty blase about the whole thing, despite me saying we weren't told, it was my friend's birthday, and I couldn't get there for 20 minutes. I had to spend the money on a taxi (plus an added $3 for atm charge) to get there. Then we had to wait more time once I arrived. Basically what happened is that they didn't have a table for us at all at 9. They could've easily pushed apart their 4 and 6 people tables to make two groups if they'd had one (because we ended up only having 6 people), but they just plain didn't have one for us at all. And when I called the guy was rude and said my party hadn't told him how many people were coming, despite the fact that they had indeed as soon as they got there. Or all he needed to do was count them and then add me, the person on the phone. But no. So my poor friends were stuck waiting for 30 minutes because of no table and the fact that they didn't mention the situation with every person having to be there. On the plus side, once we called them on what they'd done and they remembered I'd said it was my friend's Birthday we were there for, they comped us our first round of drinks (and told us as they were seating us that they would), which was $64 (we paid them back by each getting an $10-$12 drink). It was a nice gesture, but in no way made up for their table screw up.  On to the food. Not traditional Italian at all and pretty small portions. I grew up half Italian and spent a lot of time eating at my little Italian grandmother's at the holidays. They tried to tell us it's an Italian thing to have small portions, but let me tell you, it most certainly is not. Not where my family is from at least. Prices were too high for the amount offered. At the end of the night, I ended up giving a tip of $11 despite not eating any of the food due to health issues. I spent $25 when I should have only spent around $7 ($2.25 red line fare and tip for the bellini I was comped). Ridiculous waste of time and money.  Just beware if you go there that you MUST have *ALL* members of your party for them to seat you. And they probably won't tell you that up front either. Be prepared for them not to care if you call and ask for your party to be allowed to sit.  Horrible customer service. I won't ever go there again.",-0.9248,0.845,0.065,0.09,0.48397392290249436

To me, large crowds mean a restaurant has a lot to live up to (or else I begin to question all these people's judgement.)  I highly recommend making a reservation in advance so you spend as little time in the crowded bar/waiting area as possible. Our table of four had a reservation but still had to wait a few minutes before we were shuffled upstairs to our tiny corner table. Although we felt claustrophobic in a small-space, high-traffic area, our waitress was attentive and kind, and most importantly, gave us genuinely great recommendations for our orders.  We decided to share a bunch of different small plates, from traditional caprese salad to the cheese fondue (a must-have with apples!) and the highlight of the meal -- the clams.

My boyfriend spilled a little of the meatballs on his sweater. Our amazing waiter noticed this, and offered that the restaurant would pay for his cleaning. I couldn't believe it!

The biscotti was nice and airy and tasted wonderful with the chocolate sauce. The not so good Crisp Calamari: it wasn't so crisp and I think it was undercooked and way too greasy.

There are tons of details and moving parts that if not thought out well could easily take the evening in a direction from fun and intimate to disastrous and awkward. With so many options and a paralyzing fear of failure, naturally I turned to the advisement of my fellow Yelper party planners extraordinaire for suggestion. Quartino was surprisingly the overwhelming front runner and apparently for good reason; the event and private dining staff were so on point I was able to throw the birthday dinner to end all birthday dinners. Tune the kazoos, hero Brett saves the day!!   Despite it looking like a tremendous amount of effort on my part (kudos to me), putting this event together couldn't have been easier (kudos to Quartino). After combing through their numerous group dining menu options and selecting our dishes for a 4-course prix fixe meal - which really breaks out to 9 dishes - I was able to sit back, relax and let the magic happen.  We arrived to our private room - The Wine Cellar Room - to find a warm, rich space enveloped in wood and flickering candlelight. What a far cry from the bright, rip-roaring scene inside the Quartino main dining room... no need to scream to hear the person beside you, this was perfect and intimate. My addition of some floral table arrangements (thanks Jayson Home and Garden) and tons of extra votive candles created quite the mood. Is it a dinner or a seance? Who cares, it's super sexy.  With the house red and white wines overflowing together with great conversation our dishes began to arrive in multitude... Round One//The Antipasti: Delicious, chewy Neapolitan pizzas (cheese, pepperoni, zucchini, funghi), veal meatballs and crispy calamari. Yum!  Round Two//The Pasta Course: Cavatelli with ricotta, tomatoes, fresh basil (unfortunately served a bit on the lukewarm side) and buttery Tagliatelle Bolognese. More meat sauce for me!! Round Three//The Main Dishes: Garlic shrimp with E.V.O.O., Pinot Grigio and lemon (my fav of the evening), Farmhouse Chicken with lemon and herbs (boring, bland) and the Prime Angus Beef with seasonal vegetables (a perfect medium-rare sliced filet with tangy balsamic roasted root veggies).  Round Four//The Dessert: Dark Chocolate Fondue served with a collection of fruit and homemade biscotti. Sinful, delicious, perfect for sharing.    Small unique details like personalized menus printed with a distinctive message for the birthday girl, unlimited portions for our dishes and fabulous service from cute boys helped me to overlook shortcomings like cold dishes, a 30 min wait for our room to be ready and a forgotten special dessert with candles for my guest of honor.  For $35 p/head + the unlimited wine package at an add'l $15 p/head, this party was a tremendous steal! When exactly did wine become cheaper than water??

2008-09-02,4.0,"I read thru most of the yelp reviews before attending a birthday party at Quartino a few weeks ago, and the verdict seemed to be: mixed bag.  Kinda touristy, kinda loud, kinda fun, some of the menu is good, some not...so I went in with fairly low expectations.  Which is probably why I had a super time at the birthday party and would easily return to this place. We had a private room for our party of about twelve people, which was awesome.  There was an oddly placed, gigantic (unnecessary) flat screen TV on the wall, which we turned off immediately.  Other than that, the ambiance was great and the room was quiet enough to have conversations, yet the fun ""party"" atmosphere of the restaurant still infiltrated.  The server was a tad grouchy, but she was pretty much on the ball with second (and third and fourth) rounds, food orders, etc. Onto the food and drink: Three words.  FOUR DOLLAR WINE.  And not just a glass of wine, a little pitcher, which is probably about two and a half glasses.  That alone will keep me coming back.  The menu is mostly small plates, although they do offer entrees.  Since we were with a big group, we ordered lots of stuff and passed the plates.  My favorite things were:  polenta fries, asparagus risotto, all the pizzas, and the salmon. Quartino is a great place to go with a big group.  Definitely call ahead for a reservation if you are going on a weekend or with a party of more than six.  Our group had a lot of food and a LOT of wine and got out for about $30 a person.  Not bad at all.

2008-08-23,3.0,"Went Friday night as part of a party of 5. We had reservations, and my cousin (who made them) had asked for an outdoor table, but when we got there we were told it would be a 30 min. wait for that. We took a seat indoors instead (it was humid out anyway, so probably just as well).  Indoors is LOUD. Like, people screaming, ears-ringing-when-you-leave loud. The two women in our group with less than-resounding-voices were impossible to hear all night. Our table was right near a waiter station with the big bread-slicing machine on it, which was in use the whole time -- normally the sound of it going would have been annoying throughout a meal in a regular-volume restaurant, but I assure you I never heard it once.  The dishes are small and they encourage you to order multiple plates for the table and share (Italian-style tapas, essentially), and they bring out each dish as it's done; since I don't eat tomatoes, this limited the number of dishes that were available to me.  I chose the mushroom risotto, which had a full depth of funghal flavor but was just infinitesimally undercooked; my cousin's shrimp risotto had achieved the proper creamy texture without the hard bite of undercooked rice remaining (I make risotto frequently at home, so I'm well aware of the process and what it should be like). The shrimp scampi ordered by another member of the party was serviceable, but nothing beyond what you'd find at Red Lobster (though the shrimp were a bit bigger); the texture did suggest that they'd been overcooked a bit (veering slightly towards tough).  For dessert we ordered a Fantasia Coppa di Frutta, a trio of fruit sorbets (raspberry, orange and lemon), topped with slivers of fruit (granny smith apples, sliced grapes, pineapple), a biscotti, and lemoncello supposedly (didn't really detect it anywhere). The lemon was the best flavor; orange was okay; I thought the raspberry was too sweet, though someone else in the party loved it. This came in a metal cocktail glass (nice presentation) and was big enough for the five at the table to pass around and pick from. Also on the dessert menu is their list of liquers and Italian bitters; they also have house-made lemoncello and orangecello.  Service was kept hopping because the place was so busy, but the tag team of two waiters who were helping us was attentive and patient when we needed a couple of rounds of extra time to deliberate over what to order (chatting got in the way of ordering). A note on the restrooms: I didn't notice this when entering the ladies' room, but upon leaving I saw that the space between the sinks and the door, where there might normally be a large mirror, is a big window that looks into the men's room! This does not look into the toilet area, just the entry area, but still, be sure to do your private primping before you reach this spot, if you want it to remain private; I witnessed one guy adjusting himself on his way out the door (gives a whole new meaning to the term ""people watching"").  Overall, Quartino was okay, but I wouldn't rush back because of the noise factor alone. Maybe it would be a better spot for lunch or an early dinner.",0.9928,0.871,0.105,0.024,0.396253147723736
2008-08-23,4.0,"Italian tapas. Love it! We had the veal meatballs, linguine with clams in white wine sauce, lamb shank, and the ravioli with pork filling. Each dish had very generous portions (for instance, there were five veal meatballs). I was pretty filled from eating the the meatballs and the ravioli, which I shared with my love. We ended up taking the linguine home. The bf enjoyed the lamb shank, which was cooked in a sauce that consisted of orange zest, mint, and another ingredient. I tried it but neither of us could taste the mint nor the orange zest. The linguine was simply done and was very light. I liked the kick of the pepper in the linguine. And we finally found a ravioli with no cheese filling! The bf called the ravioli a ""man's ravioli."" We went here on a Saturday night and the wait for a table was an hour long. We opted for a table in the bar, and we definitely waited less than an hour for it--perhaps 10-15 mins. We sat toward the end of the bar so there was plenty of space and not as loud as it was toward the front. Also, our waitress was very attentive and very helpful.

The small plates are okay...I wouldn't bother with them.  They give you pretty good bread while you wait anyway.  We had the olive assortment (WEIRD-tasting), the housemade giardiniera (pretty good), the spicy eggplant (also pretty good) and the roasted beet salad (subpar - way too sour), most of which went untouched as we were too busy devouring our delicious pizza.  Next time we're just getting the pizza.  $10 split between 2 for lunch isn't bad at all.  Sure beats going to the neighboring tourist-hell pizza places.",0.9893,0.798,0.185,0.017,0.564484126984127

The next night we sat at the bar and it was outstanding.  The bar was packed with a fair amount of the popped collar crowd but when I get down to eating I don't care who is calling for ""jaegerBombs....chief"", I can block out any one.  The bar tender greeted us with a comped gnocchi that was high on our list of things to order.  More duck prosciutto and an outstanding speck which was a smoked prosciutto.  Added to these were roasted beets salad, calamari salad, asparagus risotto and Gorgonzola Dulce, and a bit of parmegiano-reggiano.  Along with the salumeri was a bit of mustardo and some pickled this and that....good, but I really need little more than cheese and meat with bread to bring me joy.  I finished off the night with a braised lamb shank (tender, succulent and I would probably have taken it with me to suck the marrow out if I had been a little less stuffed) and a asparagus risotto that was a bit disappointing after the rest of these lovely treats.  The staff was friendly, attractive (especially the girl with the short dark hair) and efficient despite it being Sunday night at 11 and the bar was slammed.  I will go out of my way to go the next time I am in Chicago if only to develop an mean case of the gout from excessive ingestion of duck prosciutto.",0.9894,0.811,0.145,0.044,0.5684722222222222

Subsequently, Audrey assumed the role of Foodmander & Chief and made the executive decision to go to Quartino.   We put our name in for a table of four on their outdoor patio and were told the wait would be 25 minutes.  Just as we received our bottle of wine inside at the bar, our table was ready!  Wow, a table ready in less than the time quoted.  A mini miracle to start our dining experience... Quartino is part of the small plate movement and encourages you to order 2 to 3 plates per person and SHARE.  As you know I HATE sharing and so does Jono's wife Lisa. This should be interesting.  We started off with their build your own Salumera Tasting. We opted for Duck Prosciutto, Soppressata, Parmesan Reggiano, Fontina, Calamari Salad, Roasted Beet Salad, and the Siclian Caponata.  The tasting also came with a selection of olives and all the fixings for the meat and cheeses.  To the selection we also added a side order of Prosciutto di Parma. Everything was delicious!  The house cured Duck Prosciutto was the clear gold medal winner, but every other component somehow made it to the podium (Sorry for the Olympics reference, but how can't you get caught up in all this hoopla?).  Next we had the Eggplant Parmigiano which had great flavors, but was salted very heavily. If I think something's too salty than something is wrong.    The Margherita Pizza was also a bit of a letdown.  Don't get me wrong, it was a good pizza, but when I think Margherita I think fresh buffalo mozzarella, not shredded mozzarella.  We also shared the Tortellini with Alfredo Sauce, Peas, and Prosciutto, which was good.  I went off on my own and ordered the Veal Meatball Slider, which may have been the best dish of the night. The meatball is perfectly spiced and it's served with yummy pickled vegetables.  To wash it all down we ordered a $16 liter of Antica Osteria Bianco, which for the money was perfect for an outdoor summer night. Quartino's outdoor patio is among the city's best.  Substantial marble tables and nice comfortable chairs make it a bit nicer than most. However, the street noise can be a bit much.  I mean do ambulances really need to have their sirens so loud?  The service was good, but not great. There were a couple of opportunities for our server to go the extra mile, but maybe didn't recognize it. No big deal.    As we were eating I was excited to give Quartino 4 stars.  However, as I am writing this review the salty eggplant parm we had is actually making me thirsty. And now I'm thinking about the disappearance of the fresh mozzarella on the pizza.  So for now Quartino will have to settle for 3 stars.

2008-07-28,2.0,"Quartino is an Italian tapas place. Anyone else see something inherently wrong with that statement above?  It's OK if you don't.  We'll talk about it later.  For now, let's talk about the restaurant. My girlfriend and I went to Quartino with a wonderful couple who are probably our most worldly friends.  He is a very smart economics professor and spends a lot of time traveling the globe attending conferences and teaching in cool places like Barcelona, Zurich, and MIT.  She is a wonderfully talented woman who has decided to take the LSAT just for fun and can play the koto.  And they like to photograph their food.  Wherever they travel or go out to eat, they will take a camera and photograph what they ordered - usually the dessert.  We get photo albums online from them all the time and 90% of the photos are of what they ate.  ""Here's our last meal in Prague!"" So, we've established that they're cool people to hang out with and a total hoot.  They know food and love to eat it.  I went to Quartino with reasonably high expectations and a good appetite.  I only knew walking in that it was an Italian place. Right away little things started to present themselves and harsh on my mellow.  Like, it was crowded, and loud.  REALLY loud.  Like, I could not understand what my friends were saying at our own table loud.   The decor is nice in the place, but it is a a strange mix of things: there is some white tile like its an Italian deli (and a meat counter to match) there are some nice fancy touches like its a really chic designer restaurant, and there are TV screens and a bar like it's, uhm, a bar.  All of these things are competing for attention in this smallish, low-ceilinged place and it creates a somewhat chaotic environment.  The TV's were showing some old Italian films and the one I spent a lot of time watching and reading the subtitles of was a delightful early Fellini film the name of which I missed but really came to enjoy.  It was, unfortunately, at the expense of me paying attention to my food and my dinner companions, but I could not hear them talk at all and the food ... well, I guess it's time to talk about that first statement. It is my uneducated opinion that Italian food is not meant to be served tapas style.  It just does not work that way.  Italians like to eat.  In Rome, one sits down to dinner at about 8:30 at the earliest, and you do not get up before 11:00.  It's just not done.  The food comes slow, steady, and in copious amounts.  There is bread, wine, conversation, perhaps a little music.  It is a time for friends, relaxation, ending the hard work day in style and comfort.  Loud and convivial is OK but not at the expense of your conversation. Quartino takes all of these Italian eating fundamentals and turns them on their head.  The place really needs to decide what it's doing, 'cuz it's not hanging together.  The whole tapas thing is that you get these tiny plates with a little food on it.  What self-respecting Italian eats like that?  Plus, is Quartino a deli-style place?  They serve decent (not great) charcuterie (look it up) and cheeses and have a good wine selection and some good looking pizzas.  They could run with that and be a wonderful place?  Do they need the TV screens?  Do they need the tapas?  Do I really want to go to an Italian place and have ONE single piece of octopus?  Or ONE tablespoon of an admittedly great and difficult to prepare asparagus risotto?  Do I really want to shout over the din of 75 people in the bar watching the sports channel?  Do I really need a Fellini film to tell me I'm in an Italian restaurant? I dunno, Quartino.  Italian tapas?  Your messing with something that's been perfected since the time of the Roman emperors.  I seriously considered giving you three stars just 'cuz the food was good and many other people seem to like it.  And the food was good, don't get me wrong.  But someone there needs to decide what the place is going to be, and I think they'll have a real winner.",0.9988,0.791,0.176,0.034,0.46685388685388685

My brother and I ordered the Sicilian olives and Fontina from the salumeria, both of which were great and the presentation of the cheese was particularly good (served with slices of bread, sliced grapes, apricot puree, and some sort of chopped onion spread).  The entrees were just as tasty: a creamy asparagus risotto and tagliatelle bolognese.  By that time, I was comfortably full, so I stuck with a scoop of lemon gelato for dessert (a no fail most places), but my brother got a banana and chocolate dessert that looked (and, according to him, was) amazing. Our waitress was friendly and everything came out fairly quickly.  The prices weren't bad at all for what we had.  I have to say, I have had better Italian food, but with the ambiance, WINE, and authenticity...I had to give it five stars.",0.9763,0.79,0.171,0.039,0.5380952380952382

Right away, I liked the simple italian decor and thought it was exectued well. It felt very Chicago to me.  We sit down and order a few pitchers of sangria to get us going.  It was nothing special, but was a pretty solid red sangria.  Once we took a look at the menu, we start placing our orders.  The duck prosciutto and brosciola were cured well and served with some sweet jelly and pickled veg on the side. Yum!!!  I love meat.  The polenta fries were served with a roasted red pepper dip and the dish was probably the best polenta that I had ever had.  The fried calamari was nothing special, but crispy and good.  Everything else had dairy in it, so I couldn't eat it, but it all looked good. At this point, our server had been so wonderful and helpful.  Remember the other 5 people I told you about that we were waiting on?  They came in three different sperts through out our meal and each time they came in, our server helped us squish them in to our table built for 6.  I wasn't happy with this at this point because a) these bitches need to get themselves together and make it to a dinner on time, especially when I'm pop'n for it and b) I was really pissed that Quatrinos didn't give us a larger table with the knowledge that we had more guests coming.   At this point, I'm sitting on top of my friends and the people at the table next to me and just dying to order an espresso and get the hell outta there.  As the night went on, the place became super crowded and super loud and super on my nerves.  Still, our server kept his spirits with our table and helped us with everything we needed.   The food here is mediocre to good and service is great.  If you don't mind a loud a boisterous place on a Saturday night you won't have a problem here.  If you are going with a large party, they can accomadate well, just make sure that you have all of your party there when you are seated.",0.9974,0.737,0.204,0.06,0.5284181096681096

LOVE it. everything is good. The wine list is overwhelming and served in liters. It is overall delicious.  Here are the things that made me vasilate between 3 and 4 stars and end up with 3: if you have reservations they seat you with ease however the tables are too close together and small if you have a larger group. It might be the loudest restaurant ever. I went there with work people and I am pretty sure my ears are still ringing. If you read any of my other reviews you would know that this is a major pet peeve with me.  The food is excellent served family style which I love.

2008-07-01,1.0,"I love restaurants.  All kinds.  I've eaten in 4 star fine dining restaurants and zero star greasy spoons.  I don't mind spending the money, but the sum must equal the parts and unfortunately, this place misses on each part.   I went there on someone else's dime for my birthday dinner.  I had heard about this place, but never tried it, and I was excited. Atmosphere:  Are you kidding me?  This place is beautiful and located in the heart of the city.  You walk in to classic design and within moments are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of the crowd.  And I'm not joking when I say this place is as loud as some concerts I've been to.  We had to wait a few minutes in the crowded, noisy foyer, then were led upstairs to our table.  The upstairs is beautiful, but it felt like we just stepped on the field at a bears game, complete with the roar of the crowd.  My headache began to throb,  There must have been 40 women in the room at different tables, all of them cackling and shouting to be heard over the roar of the crowd and the others at their tables that were screeching inane stories about lotion.  The noise did get slightly better after 10 pm, but was unbearable.  The restaurant played vaccuous trance in the background.  Yuck. The Food: Here's the deal, tapas is an awesome concept.  The spanish do this with much success with a combination of (usually) exceptional small plates of food that run from $5-$10,  Everyone shares and everyone gets to try something different.  Italian food, however, does not translate well when you charge ridiculous amounts of money for small portions of underwhelmingly average food.  We ordered a braised lamb shank for (if I recall) close to $20,  After I ate the approximately 2 ounces of tender, poorly seasoned, meat, I found myself giggling at the idea that I could have had 5 times the meat for the same money at a nicer, quieter, more relaxed fine dining establishment.  The Asparagus Risotto was bland and decidedly missing salt, pepper, flavor....  It was about 1/2 a cup of Risotto and cost us $14 (maybe it was $12, close enough).    We ordered other stuff too, but none of it was what I would call reasonably priced or anywhere close to exceptional.  This concept COULD work if they made fantastic food and charged 30% less, but as it stands the food is ridiculously expensive and sadly mediocre. The Bill: We had 3 people.  Each of us had a cocktail and some food.  We were there for dinner, but none of us left feeling anything close to full.  Our tab, including tip, was $155.  For that money, the three of us could have enjoyed a fabulous meal at Wildfire (or Opera, or giocco, or bob chinns or froggy's or, well just about anywhere), walked out having enjoyed our conversations and feeling like gluttonous pigs. The staff: I've worked in restaurants for close to a decade (at least I used to in a former career).  You don't have to be very good when you don't have to bring out the food in order (they don't) or on time (they bring it whenever), and you don't have to be very good when your customers can't hear a word you say and you can't hear them either.  We resorted to hand signals for water refills and to answer what looked liked (i'm not very good at lip reading in the dark) 'Is everything okay?""  The girl who served our table was nice enough (from her smile - I think she said thank you, but I couldn't tell).  I can't fault her.  I'm not terribly sure if I had the chance to hear her voice. Overall: Avoid.  Besides the crowd, this place is expensive and the food just isn't very good.  You can spend far less on tasty spansih tapas and enjoy a more reasonable atmosphere down the street at Iberico.  You can spend just a hair more and enjoy brazzaz or Fogo de Chao and feel like your money was well spent.  $12 tapas plates  that taste like the Olive Garden master chefs made it isn't enough to sell this place.  Why waste your money on below average food so you can sit in a room with your friends and be unable to converse due to crowd noise? I'm not only unimpressed with Quartino, I'm downright dissapointed.  The folks that gave this place great reviews need to try some other places.  I guarantee that you'll realize that your opinion was goofy. Now, had they served big plates for that money, I'd be saying that it was a reasonably placed, sort of generic eatery with mediocre food, but with little plates it makes the diner feel like a fool when the bill comes.",0.9989,0.776,0.173,0.051,0.527863247863248

I'm not sure why, I guess it was just something different. I didn't pay any attention to what the red wine people were drinking but they seemed happy. I didn't want any red wine. As far as eats, if you read my reviews, you know I am primarily vegetarian, but occasionally when I go out I cheat. Quartino was occasion to cheat big time. Still, some of my favorite things were vegetarian. The eggplant caponata, the candied mustard fruit that comes with salumeria, and the polenta fries...all really beautiful. The pizza was okay, if you are a vegan and considering cheating I would consider looking elsewhere for pizza. However, the tortellini alfredo, with prosciutto and peas and cream sauce was worth it.  As far as deserts, the chocolate fondue, nah. Nothing spectacular. The coppa al banana however, was addictive. Its composed of carmelized banana, vanilla gelato, white chocolate, chocolate syrup, biscotti, and whipped cream. The chocolate syrup is at the bottom so don't get confused like everyone at our table did and think they fooled you. The dark chocolate syrup is in there, you just have to dig.

The lamb shank was a single lambshank which was great because with me and italian food, I sometimes will get tired of what I'm eating and I won't finish, but here, since it's tapas style, we all can order a dish and share it!  The lamb was great!  It fell off the bone so nicely that I didn't even have to use a knife.  The sauce was a citrusy sauce which tasted so delicious! The tuscan chicken risotto was ok for me, I wasn't that great of a fan, I think it was too cheesy for my taste but my boyfriend said it was really good to him. The french doughnuts were the best!  It was served with powdered sugar and dark chocolate sauce!

2008-06-18,5.0,"A cloud-less Wednesday with the sun beaming down the the breeze making the temperature a wonderful 72 degrees, there was no choice but to dine alfresco style.  Quartino was the ideal spot. Started out with the Porcini Crusted Tuna and the Eggplant Parmigiana.  The Tuna was really small but was loaded with flavor.  It was served on top of a tomato sauce relish which really made it tasty.  The Eggplant was buried under a layer of cheese and covered in marinara sauce.  Not bad, but I would've liked a little more eggplant. I had a glass of their Riesling, and nothing was more perfect than a cold (yes, cold, not slightly cold) glass of wine to go with this awesome lunch. Next, my mom and I shared the Caprese Salad and the Sea Scallops.  The salad came with two big, round cuts of buffalo mozzarella and three perfect sized tomatoes.  A topping of fresh basil and a bottom layer of aged balsamic vinegar and olive oil made this salad that much better.  I don't think I have ever tasted a fresher cut of mozzarella anywhere.  The scallops were even better.  Six plump ones serves with caper-berries and shaved garlic.  The scallops were perfectly seared and wonderfully cooked. For dessert, we ordered to Coppa al Banana and the Zeppole.  The first came in a martini glass with two big scoops of vanilla gelato, a half of a caramelized banana, fresh whip cream and topped with chocolate shavings.  For anyone who hasn't had gelato or hasn't had it in a long time, this is a real treat.  I could've eaten at least one more order, despite the large portion.  The Zeppole, which are donuts, were just OK.  You have a choice of sauce to have them with, dark chocolate or honey, and we chose the dark chocolate.  They are soaked in powdered sugar and are probably a better date dessert during a late night visit. The service was flawless and the dishes came out rapid fire style, but not to the point where our table was too full to hold them. Overall, I am very impressed with Quartino and can't wait to come again.  This is a great place to share several dishes and a glass of wine and perfect for a lazy afternoon of soaking in the sun.",0.994,0.755,0.174,0.071,0.574669312169312

Part I: - slightly loud (but not horrible) - seated fairly quickly (despite the fact that it was pretty busy) - appetizers: calamari (decent; not the best I've ever had);  Sicilian eggplant bruschette (tasty); veal meatballs (omg, yum!) - main dish: orecchiette (I needed a moment after my first bite; uber good) - dishes came out as they were completed (which was nice; less waiting) - desserts: coppa al banana (I've never had a banana so perfectly caramalized; biscotti = amazing); zeppole (hot Italian doughnuts with honey/dark chocolate; fan-fucking-tastic) - wine: Malbec (red from Argentina; full-bodied and superb) Part II: Our server, Zac, was one of the best servers I've ever had in my entire life. Pretty big bag to carry, but it's true. He was friendly, attentive, knowledgeable (re: the menu), funny...he's exactly what every server out there should strive to become. He gave us some wine suggestions, brought us some samples, then sat there with us while we tried them just to see our reactions. He really became a part of the experience and seeing as how he was just so super nice, we welcomed him with open arms. (Zac -- if you're reading this -- you complete me.)

The food in general was good, I had the shrimp in olive oil and butter - extremely tasty and we started with the antipasto sampler. Everyone at the table ordered something different and sampled all around. Personally, I really, really, really dislike tapas style dining with more than two people.

My uncle ordered one of his favorite Italian dishes, linguine and clams, and was very happy with how the chef made it.  We also ordered some of the small plates that are Quartino's specialty: roasted peppers, eggplant caponata, calamari. All were absolutely delicious.  The thin crust, gourmet pizza we ordered had an amazingly flavorful, crispy crust and perfectly balanced toppings.  And, last but far from least, the wine was wonderful--and totally affordable!  That was the biggest surprise with Quartino: the bill.  We pieced together a bunch of small dishes that ended up being completely filling, plus wine and dessert, and our total check was only a little over $90 for four people.  It was refreshingly reasonable for the quality of the food. My only hesitation on giving five stars is the factor that others have mentioned here: the noise level.  I doubt that there is much the restaurant can do about this (metal ceilings, tile walls), but it is something to keep in mind when deciding to dine there.  With my aunt and uncle in town only for a night, we would have preferred a setting that made for easier conversation.  Especially on older ears, the noise level can be a real obstacle.  And we went on a Monday night--I can't imagine the din on the weekends!  Still, the overall experience makes it well worth having to raise your voice a little.",0.9874,0.823,0.145,0.031,0.6101190476190477

We opted to go for the less expensive wines, but their list goes from $15 carafes to $70-80) so there's something for everyone. Between three of us, we decided to get: 1 carafe house Pinot Grigio (really good) 1 carafe red sangria (also pretty good) 1 Margherita Pizza (PS pizzas are big, lots of food right there) The fondue (the best part of the meal in my opinion. It's a white cheese fondue and it comes with bread cubes, but for a little extra, you can get fruit and veggies on the side, sooo good) And the Cavatappi (hand rolled pasta with ricotta cheese mixed in, really good). The pasta plate was perfect for sharing with three. We probably would have been fine with two dishes, the portions are a good size.  Best part of the night: For all of that our total bill, $66! I was shocked to find such great italian food and wine with such a small bill. Awesome! My new favorite spot for sure. The only reason for a loss of one star: It is loud here.

The restaurant filled up quickly after we ordered our food but the food still arrived in on time. Portions are small so it's fun to share your food! A stack of small plates is conveniently provided and constantly switched out. Make sure your server knows if you're not done with your food yet because they are so efficient that I almost had my unfinished food taken away twice! Haha The food comes whenever it's ready and bread is provided. Ask for balsamic vinegar to create the perfect dipping sauce with olive oil and pepper. The bread was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, and never ending!  Our spinach salad arrived first but it was disappointing. The thin sliced pear was amazing but sparse (or maybe I just wanted more because it was so good!). Spinach tasted a little off and warm like it was cooked. I think blue cheese would've been better than the cheese they had. Clam linguine was FANTASTIC. It's the type of dish that I would want to order again even though I like to try new dishes all the time. We had the marinara sauce which I doubted at first because marinara tends to be too thick and salty. The sauce at Quartino was definitely freshly made. It was the perfect combination of whatever marinara is made of, with a light sweetness. Thin slices of garlic were the perfect compliment to the clams. Then came the pizza. Get two different toppings half and half so you can try more toppings! We had the Quattro Stagioni (tomato, mozzarella, artichokes, roasted peppers, grilled zucchini, mushrooms, and grana) and Pepperoni (neopolitan sausage, tomatoes, and mozzarella). The pepperoni was amazing to me, but the Quattro Stagioni was even better. So much flavor and if you're a cheese lover like me you'll be picking off the big pieces of grated cheese to eat on its own.  And don't forget to order drinks. Sangria is only $4 and one of the best I've ever had! Sweet and doesn't taste like alcohol. About the service: Hostess recommended that we share food (great tip!). Waiter brought us a new pizza when it was actually my fault for ordering the wrong topping because there's two pizzas with similar names but they're completely different pizzas! And upon careful scrutiny we found zero traces of spit or any trace of an angry cook. Oh we were so happy! Then we ordered cappuccino with a shot of espresso but felt like it  wasn't strong enough so our waiter, David brought us a shot of espresso on the house! Btw, check out the restrooms. designed with an antique flair. Interesting soap choice.  Also, if you're a classics movie fan, The Bicycle Thief plays on 4 televisions in the four corners of the restaurant.

I didn't get dessert cause I was looking forward to Berry Chill across the street, but the fried pieces of dough with chocolate dipping sauce looked delicious - I will have to try them next time.   One other thing I must mention is the definition of the salumeria, which is basically a make your own antipasto salad tray.  You get a piece of paper (sushi restaurant style) and select the olives, cheeses, and imported meats you would like brought out to you.  It's a really cool idea, so I'll be trying that next time as well.

I've got to say the only decent item was the pizza which had a generous portion of cheese and a light airy tomato sauce. The other items and like most other items here are relatively cheap (around $10) but the serving size and quality definitely do not match the prices. The meatballs were tasty as well but also not amazing. I might return again to try some other items on the menu, but it's not worth all the support.

But, I hesitate to give it 4 stars... I think it deserves maybe 3 and 3/4 stars. I'd like to emphasize that my rating is strongly supported by the prices, service, and dessert! This is a great place for big groups since you can share and try a little bit of everything. I've had a fair share of the food... pizza, the meatballs, eggplant parm, calamari, risotto, etc. Out of all of these dishes, I think I love the meatballs the most. Some of the other dishes were a little too salty for my liking. But, nothing wowed me. I'm a big dessert person, so I always save room for dessert here! I've had... - Zeppole. These fluffy little Italian doughnuts are TDF and are perfect for dipping in honey and/or dark chocolate. If you love the beignets at Grand Lux, you'll love these. - Copa Al Banana. This gelato sundae comes with caramelized bananas and chocolate sauce over creamy vanilla gelato. You really can't go wrong. - Profiteroles. I'm a big fan of profiteroles in general, and Quartino's serves great profiteroles. A little pastry puff, vanilla gelato, and chocolate sauce create the perfect bite.

The dessert we got was sorbet with fruit topping. Everything we got was perfect and the price was right.

We were seated very quickly, in a corner kinda tucked away from the rest of the restaurant, which was nice and homey. Service was prompt and nothing to complain about. Noise level was close to ideal for conversation: everybody could hear each other without being conscious of our neighbors. We ordered quite a few ""tapas."" My favorite dishes are the polenta fries which was really good with the sweet red sauce, and the roasted baby octopus, succulent and flavorful. We also had the assorted spuntini: peppers, calamari and artichoke. The calamari and peppers were good. The artichoke was a bit too tart for my tongue. Our neighbors had a ""salumera tasting"" (assortment of cured meat, cheeses, and pickled stuff) and it looked really good, so we ordered it as well. We got salami and duck proscuitto for the meat, provolone and something similar to parmesan for the cheese, three types of olive and a couple of other small sides. It costs $25, the most expensive dish of the night. The prosciutto and cheese were good. The rest was a disappointment. I was excited to see that they serve neapolitan pizza. They didn't have Prosciutto e Rucola so we ordered the margherita with prosciutto, a $3 add-on. The topping was pretty good tho' I could use more basil. The crust is not worth mentioning. I've had extraordinary neapolitan pizza at Spacca Napoli, and this one was anything but. I ordered a Mojito. This sad little thing costs $9. Cut the Bacardi, add more mint, and I'll be a much happier person. The dinner costs $20 per person, pretty cheap for this neighborhood.

We were seated within the 10 mins or so and on the second floor which mainly consisted of large parties.  It was a bit rowdy, and oddly enough it was the oldest group (all in their 40's) that was creating all the noise in a room full of 20 somethings.  A waiter came almost immediately and let us know that he wasn't our waiter but would start us out with some drinks.  We asked for recommendations and he asked about our tastes in wine and recommended a GREAT vino at a moderate price.  Super helpful, polite and he wasn't even our server.  I love that kind of service. The rest of night was great.  We way over ordered and were only able to taste the last two dishes.  Everything was brought out in the perfect order and the timing was perfect.   Highly recommend but not all in the same night (learned that it was way to rich) Fondue- with apples Pesto gnocchi Sausage risotto Overall, we had a great experience.  Everyone was super friendly and the service was great.  Also wanted to mention the close quarters at the bar and during seating lead to some friendly conversation with other patrons.  I would recommend this place for lively events (groups, girls night out) but probably not so much for a date night.",0.9958,0.787,0.174,0.04,0.5723988095238095

From the Neapolitan-style pizza in my neighborhood to just about any deep-dish variety I've tried so far, you fell in the middle for crust and the bottom for taste. Actually, I might even like Domino's better than the pizza I had here. I should clarify that I came here on a numbingly cold Sunday morning in January, when the restaurant (the whole city, really) was nearly dead. This could work for or against the restaurant, I guess, but I didn't really get the loud and bustling Quartino most people do. Our service was attentive, to say the least. She went through her welcome spiel, explained how the menus worked and revisited our table no fewer than five times before I was actually ready to order. To start, I got the extremely bizarre spinach salad with ricotta salata and some very underripe pears. Maybe I'm just used to a nicer cheese on a spinach salad, but the combination of ingredients was just plain gross. My friend and I split the Quattro Formaggi pizza. Underwhelming. It made me sad, truly. The food deserves only two stars for now, but I'll offer up half a star for beautiful decor (all white and wood, with gorgeous old tile floors and antique mirrors everywhere) and half for the wonderful bartender who gladly fixed me a mimosa when I wandered in from the cold, craving a little ""breakfast"" before I hit my lunch stride.

I think the food can be hit or miss.  I usually get a salad and an appetizer, last time I was there I had the Arugula Salad and the Grilled Octopus appetizer and both were prepared well and tasted good.  I also love their meat, olive and cheese selections.   I am not crazy about their wines, they are very affordable but I've had multiple selections and never been too crazy about any of them.  I don't think anyone goes to Quartino expecting a great wine selection but I think you expect more of a lower priced wine selection - which is what you will get. I have always had very good service at Quartino too.  They train their staff on their wine and the food.  The bartenders are always friendly and helpful.   My favorite part - that powder soap in the bathrooms.  I love the way it makes my hands feel and the way it smells.  I wish I knew where to buy that!",0.9928,0.763,0.217,0.019,0.5447826086956521

The asparagus risotto and pizzas are notable, and the cheese and meat selections are delicious. The service can be spotty when it's busy, but they're quick to clear the dishes as they pile up, and the tapas comes out quickly as well.  The prices vs quantity can be a little hit or miss, with the wine prices being fairly exorbitant. The pizza and tapas are a bit more manageable, especially the pizzas as they are all very yummy. The chocolate fondue is delicious, but $4 plate of dipping fruit each seemed steep for the amount we got.  It's a good lunch and dinner place, great for dates and just a casual night out but I would not recommend it for a private party unless you can do a by-the-menu order, or set plates of food. The tapas buffet was excellent as far as the quality and taste of the food went, but was overpriced by.... well, a lot. A lot.  The service is good, friendly and attentive.

So you pick your meat, cheese, olives, maybe some roasted red peppers...the whole shebang.  And then ontop of it all, you also get little jams, pickled veggies and other little dressings and dips for your whole antipasto plate experience.  I could go for different kind of crostini bread for it?  Onto entrees, you could pick a pasta / pizza / salad and all do family style with it.  It does suck if you are only with two people and you get a 2-top for a table.  If they try to sit you at one of those, ask to be moved.  You will not be happy with trying to balance all your plates on a small table!  I really like all their pastas and salads, their pizzas are the thin and crispy variety.  Order their wine by the carafes too. Not sure why it is so great to have wine this way and have those little tumblers to drink your vino from.... but I like it!  Sign me up!  They have lots of italian wines that you can actually purchase by the bottle at 50% off their rack pricing for you to take home too.  Delicious!",0.9593,0.885,0.099,0.016,0.5688034188034188

2007-09-25,5.0,"I attended my first Yelp event at Quartino's last night. It advertises itself as a pizza joint, but honestly, it's so much more than that.   We were able to sample some of the appetizers set out for us as well as the bellini station.  Everything was fantastic.  The service was awesome, everyone was very nice and accommodating, from the hostess up front to the servers offering appetizers and the bartenders. When the pizza came out, we were very excited, I love thin crust pizza and it was honestly, some of the best I've had in a long time.  It was thin, not too crispy and not too cheesy.  Perfect for me.  It did remind me of pizza that I'd had in Italy.   Bravo, Quartino! We were able to scope a glance at the menu before we left and we can't wait to try it again!",0.9915,0.741,0.236,0.023,0.6625000000000001
2007-09-24,4.0,"I was impressed by Quartino in many ways. It emphasizes itself as a pizzeria and a wine bar, and they serve many of their dishes in smaller appetizer portions. You can then try many different items, just like the way we did at the recent Yelp party. The thin crust pizzas are delicious, with crispy crusts and without an overload of toppings. The pizza slices were clearly the hit of the evening, and anyone who digs thin crust should order a pizza or two here (they're not that large - again ""smaller"" portions). There were also some bruschetta-like items with tempting toppings like sun-dried tomatoes and portobello mushrooms, though they overwhelmed the bread into a semi-soggy state. I imagine Quartino prepared a lot of these items for the 150+ crowd, so they may have sat for a bit. I am sure the bread will stand up a bit better if you order directly from the menu. We also enjoyed meatballs and polenta fries (a look-alike for mozzarella sticks) for this fine appetizer buffet. The cocktail special was a bellini, a peachy-champagney mix which was interesting but a bit sweet for others. Every employee at Quartino seemed to be efficient, pleasant, or a combination of both. I would love to come back to Quartino for a real meal sometime soon. Give a 21-Yelp salute to Andrea and Elizabeth for setting up this swell soiree at Quartino. Cool Yelp stuff too - love the new baseball cap.",0.9929,0.793,0.207,0.0,0.5765512265512266

I'm also not crazy about not being served at the same time as others at the table. My fiance was done with his risotto before my pizza came. To be fair, they warn you about that beforehand.

2007-09-14,4.0,"Quartino is definitely a happening place.  We made a reservation for 7pm but didn't actually get seated until at least a half hour later, so my advice would probably be to reserve a bit earlier than you actually plan to eat - that way you'll be hungry and not starving by the time the food comes!   The gnocchi was very squishy, a little too squishy for me, but the flavor was good.  We really enjoyed the shrimp risotto, which wasn't too creamy, and the beef fillet, which was tender and well-balanced by the vegetables it came with.  My favorite was the sea scallops dish, which had a bit of a buttery tomato aftertaste.  Yum.  I also loved the Quartino dessert, especially since it came piled high with toasted hazelnuts and really good biscotti (with raisins in it!).

I remember the Fondue was delicious but that I couldn't really find anything else. I'm so happy that I gave it a second chance (and several other chances since)! It is actually a great place for dining out! If I created a list for places to bring my family members when they visit from out of town (which I really can't because my West Coast family members never venture far from the Pacific), this would be in the Top 5 for sure. It has something for everyone! It has many recognizable comfortable options, but it's just different/special enough to make everyone feel like they're having a unique dining experience.  The wait-staff is VERY friendly (my mother was stoked that four different people thanked her for coming and wished her a good evening as she was walking out the door) and some of them, very familiar with the cuisine that they're serving. I was thrilled to learn that our waiter the other night studied abroad in Rome (actually in the same Loyola program as me which was very cool). Reservations are easy to make and they are very understanding if you are running a couple of minutes late. Though I don't recommend pushing that, the place fills up VERY quickly.  Here are my only complaints: a) because of the large open spaces and the number of visitors every day, the place can get really, really loud (difficult to even hear the person sitting next to you) and b) I was once served Spaghetti with Marinara when I ordered Carbonara (kind of a significant difference - though I honestly dug the Marinara better, uh oh). These are kind of nit-picky so if I could just deduct half a star, I would. In any case, bring the 'rents when they visit from out of town. They'll dig it.   Also, if you are looking for private dining for a small group - reserve their wine room! I as told it has a capacity of 17, but makes for a GREAT place for a dinner meeting or something. I booked a reservation for a business meeting that I didn't actually attend.

I mentioned wanting to try a red ""with some kick"" and the bartender steered me to a tasty Cabernet for $12. All of the beverages here, even milk I think, are served in half carafes--fun. Of course, I drank two of them and couldn't figure out why I felt buzzed. Duh! Two carafes is probably almost 4 regular glasses of wine! The pizza was very thin, very hot and pretty tasty. My only complaint was that the basil was more of an afterthought on the margherita and not sprinkled throughout. Still, it was nice to be able to get something like that at 12:30am. The bathrooms were huge--maybe 8 stalls?--and had Borax soap in them which amused me. They also have some sort of weird feature where men and women can watch each other walk out (but not see the actual stalls. I know, I explained this poorly.) I would definitely go back.

We waited in the bar for a bit before dinner, and it was a typical Italian wine bar setting, with nice ambiance even though it was packed.

But I wouldn't have cared. It made me feel special, and to be quite honest, I've rarely met an Italian wine I didn't like. Just the taste of a Montepulciano or a Chianti and some cheese, bread, and prosciutto, and I'm in heaven.  The  salumi menu is extensive, and the pile of prosciutto I got was beautiful - fresh and not too salty. The Caprese was good and so were the olives. That was really all I needed. I never moved on to the entree, although my dinner companion did. I honestly don't remember much about her meal, as I was kind of zoned out on my own small (but actually kind of large!) plates.

The rustica pizza was tasty - potato, pancetta, and a nice rosemary - but again, not outstanding, and when the crust got cold, it firmed up to the consistency of a cracker.

2007-06-28,2.0,"So I've never bothered to review a restaurant I didn't absolutely love, but this will be my first. To be completely honest, I'd sum up my experience here with a hearty ""Meh."" The restaurant was so loud that keeping up a conversation with my friends was difficult. After waiting for thirty minutes for a table, we were seated in the corner of the restaurant, tucked between a wall and the entrance to the kitchen, only to wait for another fifteen minutes before we even saw our waitress. Not a good start. I liked the concept of the restaurant going in, but I was a little bit disappointed by the execution. The create-your-own antipasti was a fun addition, and the meats (prosciutto di parma and an air-dried salami) and cheeses (taleggio) which we selected were delicious; the accompaniments, unfortunately, were hit-or-miss.  I was very disappointed by two out of the three olives in the tasting portion -- I didn't know it was possible to serve a bad olive, but I guess there's a first for everything. The veal meatballs were tender, juicy, and flavorful; however, the accompanying sauce was far sweeter than what I was expecting and what I deemed desirable. The calamari, covered with far too much batter, was rubbery both in terms of texture and flavor. The polenta fries were also tasteless, although that could be blamed on either the person who invented polenta fries or the person who ordered them rather than the person who prepared them for our consumption. The desserts almost made up for the lackluster food. The caramelized banana sundae was good, and the lemon gelato ""panino"" was similarly delicious. The best thing, however, was the biscotti that accompanied the sundae. All in all, I think if we had ordered better, my experience would have been better. That being said, I still think everything on a menu should be on the same plane. Perhaps I'll try this place again and my second experience will be better than my first, but with so many other restaurants to try in Chicago, one mediocre experience is enough.",0.9893,0.784,0.152,0.064,0.6409313725490197

One goes to a place like Quartino.  Italian tapas... kind of but not really. Eleven pm, and looking for a place to eat, Quartino comes through with shining colors.  They are opened until 2 AM (kitchen closes at 1 AM) and they offer an extensive wine list with truly excellent FOOD!   There are two menus -  one is ""regular style"" with another resembling tapas-style, consisting of many different little things you can add to an appetizer plate, like cheeses, salamis, prosciutto, salads, etc.  We ordered the asiago cheese, another cheese the waiter recommended, regular prosciutto and some delicious duck prosciutto.  YUM.  It came out with a lot of little sides to the appetizers - like candied fruit, cucumbers with lime, toast, apricot paste, grapes, etc.   We had a LOVELY bottle of 2003 Ruffino with the meal.  I loved, loved, loved this wine!!! The meal...  We also ordered a pizza... a vegetarian pizza with a great crust and bursts of amazing flavor.  Also on our table was a terrific veal carpaccio.... holy bazookas, this is good stuff.  ALSO - we had TERRIFIC FONDUE.  Wow, was that good or WHAT?  Very heavy but you don't order fondue when you want something light.  :-)  Great cheese, with perfectly crisp bread and apples.  DELICIOUS. Obviously, we had no room for dessert ........... BUT THAT NEVER STOPPED US BEFORE, did it? So we ordered two desserts, a double espresso and a coffee to boot.  Desserts were amazing... espresso was good, coffee was weaker than I like but very flavorful. There is a definite feel at Quartino that resembles eating in Italy....  including patio dining and all.  Even when you eat indoors, the french doors are kept wide open to the outside, and it sort of feels like patio dining.......  Ambience is dimly lit but rather semi-casual.  It's a place where you can come as dressed up or underdressed as you'd like and still fit in just fine.  Service was truly topnotch from our maitre'd to the waiters... our own waiter was spectacular, but even other waiters helped out immensely, made suggestions, clean up for us, etc. Quartino started off my Chicago trip with a bang, and if I had just a couple more days in Chicago than I do right now - -  I'd go back in a heartbeat.  WHAT A GREAT PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

First: the place is insanely crowded with no ambience...it is a classic River North restaurant in that it is a blend of downtown-destined locals, trend-setting visitors and rag tag tourists. Seriously weird vibe guest-wise. BUT -- let's be honest: all of Rome feels that way, too, so it's not a bad thing (and what restaurant owner wouldn't want a busy place?). Second -- the worst tables and chairs in restaurant history. One of the other writers mentioned this, but at one point we had plates in our LAPS, on a railing, and in the server's hands. There is no room at the table, and the chairs are ridonkulously uncomfortable (unless you manage to steal a pleather-cushioned one away from a 6-top...I'm just sayin'). Now -- the best part? The food is amazing. Seriously. I could find nothing wrong with a single thing we ordered...I don't know if the rest of you do this now, but I actually have Yelp in mind when we go out to eat! So we ordered extra things just to try... The 'salumeria' was a great idea, and I ordered a lonzino (dried pork loin) and three different cheeses. All were great -- and the candied fruit, giardiniera and cucumbers were a nice treat. We also ordered the now-famous caprese (freshest mozzarella in the city), shrimp risotto, rucolina pizza (arugula on pizza rules...), and calamari. There were at least 20 other things on the menu I wanted to try!!! The wine selections were great, the service was excellent and attentive, and the valets were fast and effective.... If it weren't for the LOUD, crowded room (replete with 80's permed Disney character-sweater fanny-pack wearing tourists), and the tiny tables and prison-caliber chairs, this would be my new favorite restaurant!",0.9921,0.799,0.147,0.054,0.6423815219867851
2007-05-07,4.0,"One visit and I was completely aware of why this place has become so popular. It's well-prepared, simple Italian food served in a rustic and (as far as I know) authentic setting. The prices are pretty reasonable given the quality of the food- an outstanding value. The gig is to order smaller plates and share with your tablemates. We were a group of three and each ordered a salad and an entree which gave us a great variety and a good cross section of the menu. The dessert, a nutella panino, was just absolutely terrific and was matched perfectly with their cappucino. My only negatives- first, very minor- what's up with the low awning by the front door? I'm 6'3 and had to duck WAY under it to get in. Not very welcoming to us tall chaps! :) Second, and more of an annoyance- the three of us were seated at a very small round table, leaving very little room for placing plates on the table- at a restaurant predicated on sharing, this seemed a awfully ill-conceived. Also, because we were close to the kitchen, I was bumped and brushed by servers and bussers all evening. I accidentally elbowed a busser and felt awful about it. We adjusted the table and I pulled in my chair as close as I could to minimize the problem but with little relief. I know losing tables means losing business, but they need to consider getting rid of that table! It was the only damper on an otherwise terrific evening.",0.9552,0.816,0.129,0.056,0.607671130952381
2007-04-30,5.0,"Loved it. After checking out the menu online (and drooling) my fiance and I decided to make an impromptu trip here after work on Friday. We arrived at 6 without a reservation and were seated immediately.  The second we sat down, two hands came out of nowhere, one from the left with water and one from the right with bread. Our waiter explained the menu to use and offered samples of the wine. We ended up with the cheapest red (hey we're saving for a wedding) which was pretty tasty. We started with the duck proscuitto which was yummy, if a bit fatty (but duck is) for my taste, and the taleggio cheese, which was good but probably unneccessary since we were also planning on the fonduta.  The fonduta was fantastic - light and creamy, not heavy like most fondues. Our bowl of bread was replenished without us asking.  At this point we were through with one 1/2 liter of wine and on our way to full and tipsy. We decided to not go overboard and just ordered the meatballs and the polenta fries to share, and another 1/2 liter of wine. I really wanted the pesto gnocchi but I knew it would be too much (next time). The polenta fries were good, but I was expecting them to be better. The meatballs were fantastic, and I usually am not that big  a fan of meatballs.  After all that, we still couldn't resist dessert. Profiteroles (excellent, depsite the topping of almonds) and lemnocello for him and some lambrusco and the nutella panini for me (heavenly, and so simple - just bread and nutella!).  We ended up spening $70 for a ridiculous amount of wine, some meat and cheese, fondu, meat and starch, 2 desserts and 2  after-dinner drinks. And we ended up taking home half of the fries, meatballs, and nutella panini to eat later! I loved the fact that the liter is double the cost of the 1/2 liter, which is double the cost of the 1/4 liter. It make me feel like if I am going to end up drinking a whole liter, I don't need to decide that now. It's not like you save money buy ordering more upfront. Yes, it was loud, but we didn't mind. The only sour note came at the end, when they started clearing everything away and we felt rushed to leave (though we had been there over 2 hours and there was a line out the door). Our server came and took the signed credit card slip off the table while we were stlll sitting there, which I absolutely hate.  Overall it was fantastic and I can't wait to come back! - - -  Update 7/30 - Came back with two friends. We again had the fonduta and the meatballs (amazing again) but also branched out to try the fettucine (okay) caprese salad (yummy) and asparagus risotto (oh my god - so good). Service was great again and with all that plus a liter of wine and one dessert, tax and tip, we spent $80 between 3 people.",0.9884,0.848,0.106,0.047,0.44996472663139336

2007-04-27,5.0,"wow so I am review # 75??? That's a whole lot of reviews, and must say something about this place.  Well let me start with it being a pretty good deal! I took my assistant and one other assistant who floats among people in my office as need arises out for a nice end to administrative assistant's week (partly to treat them, partly to get myself out of the office for a while on a Friday!) What a great pick for a workday lunch! I love the smaller plates and the sharing concept.  I wouldn't quite call it tapas style- each dish really is enough to qualify as someone's meal.  But obviously sharing is encouraged, which makes it more fun.   For 3 people, the bill only came out to $50 for a 1/2 carafe of wine, caprese, a pizza and two pasta dishes.  I thought I was reading it wrong!  I thought we were going to have to spend a lot more to get full on ""tapas"" that were priced between $6-12 each, which is why I'd hesistate to call it that.  Everything was very good, and I have been back quite a few times since then (brought my mom here for her birthday, and she raves all over again anytime I mention it!) As soon as we walked up to the front door from our cab, we were greeted by two hosts with a smile.  Inside the hosts seating customers were equally friendly.  (its a little different for dinner on weekends- while they are still friendly, they are also very very busy doing crowd control! its a nuthouse in the lobby sometimes).  The waitress on the first occasion was knowledgeable (although she seemed a bit distracted, but no big deal).  She recommended a great wine (yea I know, drinking at lunch and coming back to work, what would my clients think! :)).  I don't really remember any other wait staff sadly- although I will say they do a great job in the bar too if you order appetizers while you wait for a table  It wasn't as crowded for lunch as for dinner.  The tables in our part of the restaurant weren't too packed together, and some tables were empty, so I'd highly recommend this for a long lunch.  Obviously, for dinner, its crazy packed, and very loud (wouldn't come here on a date really unless I could sit outside, or upstairs where its a tad less loud) I don't LOVE the pizza because I prefer a bit more heft to a crust (if I'm getting pizza, to me it might as well be gino's!), but for an extremely thin crust, it was still really good and the toppings made up for it.  The gnocchi was also good, as was the shrimprrissoto.  I don't generally like creamy sauces but these were not TOO heavy and very tasty. Caprese good, pastas good, meat dishes good- really I haven't had anything here that wasn't lick-your-plate good :)  Obviously also a great place to come on a warm evening to sit outside- although its a little tougher to fit multiple plates on those little tables! If you come here- GET THE FONDUE! You will thank me later! I didn't discover this until a few times in- and I really would actually come here and just get fondue until I was stuffed.  Hate to admit- a friend and I actually ended up doing this before, and had a pizza go to waste (because we thought we had to order SOMETHING else) While there are a lot of good restaurants in this area, this does stand out!",0.996,0.783,0.163,0.055,0.4954666666666669
2007-04-18,4.0,"Went here for late lunch with a friend and thought it was quite good.  There were only a few other tables at around 4pm, so if you want to avoid the noise the other reviewers experienced, go around this time. The only problem we had with Quartino was deciding what to order, which is why I think it's better suited to larger groups.  If you have more people in your party, you can order more and then you get to sample a lot more of the menu.   Anyway, we had the duck proscuitto, tuna carpaccio, spinach/walnut/pear salad, and the cavatelli pasta.   I liked the duck proscuitto, it came with some interesting accompaniments, but they were tasty.  The tuna carpaccio wasn't what I expected...it came with a roasted pepper ""stew"", and I thought it overwhelmed the flavor of the tuna.  Loved the spinach salad, it was simply dressed but very fresh.  My favorite was the cavatelli...rich ricotta, flavorful but not overwhelming sauce, and doughy texture of the pasta was perfect...a lot like an Italian version of comfort food/mac and cheese.  I had to be at work so no wine this time, but I'll be back (with a bigger group!). Update: came here when my parents were in town and had a fabulous dinner.  The pizza was wonderful, crust was just right and toppings delish. We tried a lot of the different cheeses and I thought all of them were great.  The bellinis were soooo good!  The only drawback was how close together the tables were and it got quite noisy during peak dinner hours!   Still loving this place!",0.9944,0.769,0.199,0.032,0.6288018433179725
2007-04-15,4.0,"Friday night I went to Quartino with 3 friends.  We had reso's for 9 pm, but one pal was late, so we didn't sit until 9:30.  The place was crazy crowded.  Neither of the hosts offered to take our coats, but a manger-esque person stopped by the table and took them for us - which was good, because people bumped into our table and chairs all night, like I said, it was crowded. Quartino is pretty loud, so my friends delegated appetizer duty to me rather than discussing all of the options - I picked the sampler.  You get to choose 2 meats, 2 cheeses, and 3 cold dishes plus all of the little relishes and sauces for $25.  A pretty great deal - it is a lot of food.  We had the duck prosciutto - heavenly, and a dried beef that was rather bland.  For cheese we had Parmesan and fontina, again, absolutely delicious.  All of the little relishes are fun to try, too. For entrees, two of my friends had the gnocchi which I enjoyed tasting, but would not have eaten an entire order of, as it was extremely rich.  I shared a pizza and the beef entree with another friend, both were phenomenal. Now on to dessert.  This place really needs a fondue sampler platter (ahem).  We made our own.  Chocolate, caramel, apples, bananas and strawberries.  At the last minute, I ordered the hot Italian donuts - GREAT choice.  The tasty little fritters were light and fluffy and piping hot, and tasted amazing as fondue items. The whole point of this place is to order food to share, which I love doing because I always try everyone's food anyway.  You can also order wine by the glass, carafe, or bottle, which is fun. For all of that food, 2 carafes of wine, one glass of prosecco, and one bottle of prosecco (yes, I really like bubbles) the bill was under $200, which I thought was great.  While the food comes out as soon as it is ready and is not staggered, we were never rushed and ended up eating and drinking until after midnight.  Pros: * delicious food, easy to share, fun atmosphere, reasonably priced, not rushed Cons: * really crowded, really loud, bathrooms are upstairs (that is just a pain), everyone gets their entrees at different times All in all, if you have a few loud friends that you want to catch up with that you enjoy sharing delicious food with - you will really enjoy Quartino.",0.9993,0.708,0.281,0.011,0.6140070921985815

I'd read the Yelp reviews so I knew what to expect, and I thought it would be  perfect choice for me and my foodie husband to celebrate his new job.  I was right -- Quartino is great for couples or a small group looking to laugh and talk and eat great food. We hit the salumeria menu pretty hard because we really love us some meat and cheese, but we also got a few small plates. In fact, we were going to order more -- we really wanted to try a pizza or something from the pasta menu -- but we were way too full. We did order the zeppoles for dessert, which presented the only snag of the evening -- we ended up having to wait longer than expected for them to be made.

Quartino serves tasty Italian food in the very trendy small plates style. So the dillema after three visits to Quartino is to rate only the food or rate the overall experience. The decision is clear enough to me, and it's not easy to give Quartino's only 3 stars. The food is good, but dinner out at a restaurant is about the food and the ambiance. Quartino's is just too jam packed with tables and it's too popular at the moment. The tapas concept compounds the problem of overcrowding. The waitstaff simply cannot keep up with the rhythm of the dining experience. In a place like Cafe Iberico you order a few small plates, and then a few more, and so on. At Quartino you simply don't get the attention needed to order two or three times during your meal. As others have mentioned, the place is loud - loud like you can't hear the person across the small table from you.

Since this place is always packed and insanely loud, I asked if we could be seated upstairs, which was still insanely busy and full of many bachelorette parties and large groups, but much quieter than downstairs.

2006-05-29,5.0,"Quartino's  makes me feel like I'm back in Italy. Although people call their food ""tapas"", it's not - it's just how food is served in Italy (smaller first plate, then the main plate).  I've been to Quartino's many  many times now and have brought a variety of people there. The service varies but the food is consistent. I've eaten outside and in a private upper area, and sound was not a problem in those areas. The main eating area and the bar area, however, can be very very loud and are very crowded.  The prices are very reasonable, especially for its location. The restaurant isn't too busy in off-hours, so I'd recommend adjusting your eating schedule on weekends and walk by in an off-hour and eat outside in the warm weather. The valet is the cheapest in the area, too! They have a variety of wines that comes in a variety of sizes - very convenient. Everyone seemed satisfied with their wines. The Bellini is awesome - I'm absolutely addicted!! It's white wine mixed with pureed peaches.  It's an absolute must for you to order meats and cheeses from the salumeria menu ( quartinochicago.com/menu… ) - try two meats and two cheeses for a good variety. You may have to ask the waiter for the salumeria menu - sometimes they don't automatically bring it to the restaurant diners. But if you're visiting late night on the weekend, this menu is great to curb your late-night appetite! And right when they bring the order, ask for more bread because they definitely do not bring enough and ask for olive oil if it's not on the table.  The gnocchi is a little softer than it should be, but it is flavorful. The sea scallops have been improved since my first visit, and is my favorite item now (I often crave the sea scallops and sometimes get them at other restaurants, but Quartino's  sea scallops is the best to me). The Prime Angus Beef Tagliata is excellent and the organic chicken is good - very moist. All my friends seemed happy with their pizza, and many friends rely on the quatro formaggio on their regular visits.  As for how much to order per person, I usually order from the salumeria menu or a smaller plate to share and then one of the larger plates for me.  I believe their prices have slowly been increasing by a dollar every few months. Their hot small plates are $8, their pasta and risotto is $9 and the specialty plates (including sea scallops) are now $16 (I swear these used to be $12).  I'll keep coming back to this restaurant to keep experimenting. Their reasonable prices make for a guilt-free dinner. Plus, I'll keep coming back for their Bellini's!!! **Update** Yes, their prices keep increasing. Sea Scallops are now $19. Risotto is now $10-12. The hot small plates are still $7-10.

Service was great as well and the sweet waitress brought over a delicious dessert in honor Mindy's bday (without me even asking her to).  You would also expect this restaurant to be pretty expensive (especially since it's owned by Gibson's and Hugo's), but I found the prices to be very reasonable.",0.9963,0.733,0.257,0.01,0.6949288337924702
2006-04-03,4.0,"What a great idea for a restaurant.  Italian style ""tapas"".  I love this kind of stuff because then you can try a little bit of everything.  That's exactly what Andrea W and I did tonight, and we had a great meal!  We got the eggplant salad and veal meatballs as they were recommended, but I have to say the pesto gnocchi was my favorite!  Our waitress was great and even brought us a birthday dessert without even asking.  It was a little loud in the restaurant, but the food and service would definitely bring me back.  It is also very reasonably priced, which is an extra bonus!",0.9816,0.761,0.239,0.0,0.5453333333333333
2006-03-23,3.0,"The food was good, not Super Duper, but good. I was already a bit ticked off since I had an 8:30 reservation and they did not seat us until 9:15. Not only did they seat us late, they never apologized or offered up and perks for their tardiness! Its a good atmosphere, although very, very loud -- and I don't thinks its just that I am getting old! So go when you have a lot of time, or wait until they get their ACT under control. GOOD cheap Wine! always a PLUS!",0.8608,0.763,0.156,0.081,0.6566666666666667
2006-02-13,5.0,"Quartino is owned by Gibsons and Hugo's, yet it is a more casual environment.  It is basically Italian tapas dishes.  Went with my friends and we ate family styles sharing several dishes.  You must try their exclusive house wines (we each got 1/4) carafe and my red was delicious.  We shared the sun-dried tomato spread, Veal Meatballs (amazing), calamari salad, eggplant salad (my favorite), and the caprese salad.  I am definitely returning and am eager to sample some of their hot dishes.  I've heard the pizza is fantastic as well as the asparagus risotto.  An added bonus is that the valet is only $5.00 (a deal for Chicago).  I strongly encourage you to give Quartino a shot!",0.9857,0.737,0.263,0.0,0.6346153846153846
