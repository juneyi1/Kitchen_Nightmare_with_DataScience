2017-06-25,2.0,"Las Picosas is located in the south side of Chicago on Pulaski. There are many Mexican restaurants in the area but we decided to stop in because of the catchy name.  We all ordered tortas de asada. They were ready within 10 minutes, not bad. The torta came with beans, steak, lettuce, tomato, and sour cream. It did not have sufficient meat and it was not as tasty as I desired it to be. I've had many tortas but by far this was not one of the best.",0.9284,0.818,0.154,0.028,0.4458333333333333
2017-06-11,1.0,"We decided to try this place out. Bad mistake, from the start chips were stale. We asked the waitress to recommend something good after they did not have multiple options that we wanted. She offered the torta smothered in sauce. Bad mistake #2. It was small I paid an extra dollar for steak and found myself looking for it. My wife had a chicken torta that tasted like it was boiled with no seasoning added to it. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place.",-0.7579,0.712,0.106,0.182,0.4854166666666666
2017-05-07,1.0,"Without a doubt the worst experience I have had on Pulaski. We ordered and the waitress didnt know if we could order carne asada instead of the diseased pork they serve there. After giving our order, there was some kind of issue and another waitress came and retook our order. The food took 25 minutes while the bass boomed and no one could hear eachother. The beef tasted like horse fried in pork. I paid the bill without finishing and gkadly walked out the door. What a waste of money.",-0.7717,0.829,0.051,0.12,0.63
2017-02-16,5.0,This was my first time coming here and it was actually recommended by a friend of mine he told me they had chicken tinga but when I called they said they didn't so I thought I still want to check them out. they're only a block away from my job so I decided to have lunch here I had a thought that I would gather and it was delicious I have actually only had. That another time and it was a very different taste to it I think everybody else everybody make some different but it was definitely good average size not too big not too small it's definitely filled me,0.9477,0.783,0.184,0.033,0.627948717948718

(Lonche caliente) I felt like the ratatouille movie, it reminded me to my torta from middle school, so good flavor, so crispy, so juicy consistency!!!!  The waitress, the amazing Ana, so proactive, helpful, and charismatic all the time cares about the clients.

2015-08-17,3.0,"So my husband being originally from Guadalajara was exited to learn that this place specialty is the torta ahogada,(a drowned sandwich in chile de arbol sauce)a Guadalajara signature sandwich.  Over the years we noticed the bread getting smaller in size which is a huge downer given that the price went up slightly. The torta can sometimes be a hit or miss. In our experience it has been either very satisfying and tasty or lackluster and overly salty.  Horchata is also sometimes waaay to sweet but when its not...it is refreshing and just right. Too bad they don't always use the right amount of sugar as I have a low tolerance for overly sweet things. ( I believe condensed milk in used in Horchata and we all know how sweet condensed milk is) A pet peeve of mine is when they do not allow to split checks and this establishment does not.  I can totally understand if you do not tell them beforehand and they ring it up as one order but when you disclose it to them in the beginning that you would like separate checcks..what is the big deal about taking separate orders so the different groups in the party get their corresponding tab? Sounds a bit anti-consumer to me. But I digress.. We usually only come for the tortas and lonches and they are not consistent in their quality.  Maybe its dependent on who the cook is for that day, but we continue coming because on the days that it is good, you will feel like you have been transposed to Guadalajara.",0.9542,0.846,0.108,0.047,0.5852380952380952
2015-07-09,3.0,Came in a Sunday around 6 Dinning room was half full... my husband being from jalisco was so excited to eat tortas ahogadas he got 3!! We decided to eat in since he was very hungry ( I was not). We sat and they brought us chips and salsa right away.. Stale but chips right??? While I order the rest of our food his torta came out.  I ordered hot wings with french fries for my daughter and a steak taco for myself... it came out 3 minutes later... IMPRESSED!! ::) HAD HOT WINGS AND THEY CAME IN 3 MINUTES!! HOW????????? Anyways.. my steak taco was ehhhh... my husband's torta not so good I could see his sadness lol.. he had high hopes that LAS PICOSAS didn't achieve...  I had a cheesecake for dessert. Ewww not even my 6 year old liked it.. Ohh and did I tell you about my lemonade? That was in reality plain water?? If you sip on it you would never know it was Lemonade. We paid $40 for 3 tortas .. hot wings with french fries.. a lemonade.. a coke.. a taco.. a horchata.. two sides of extra sauce and a cheesecake.. not bad on price.. but being cheap is not enough.. We won't be back.. you get 3 stars because you have an awesome server which I wish I had asked her name so I could name her here =(,0.9748,0.844,0.123,0.033,0.5375680272108843
2014-09-22,5.0,"I had to come back and update my review mainly because I have come to love this place.  I crave their lonches and their tacos al vapor.  Staff are all very friendly, it's BYOB and very family oriented.   The 5 stars are not because it's white table cloth, foo-foo shee-shee reasons, it's because the food is delicious and I love it.

2014-02-13,4.0,"Disclaimer, this review is only for their tortas ahogadas, not the service since i have only taken to go, multiple times but only to go. Not for the place for the same reason. Torta ahogada, if you look the the definition on the Mexican dictionary it says: drowned torta, given the name for it is completely submerged in the sauce. The tortas here are great, crunchy bread on the outside, soft on the inside. Filled with shredded pork and pickled onions, smothered on sauce (hot or tomato, I use both)  The crunch from the bread, then spicy, then pork and a hint of sweetness from the tomato sauce, good stuff I tell you.

2013-03-09,1.0,"Disappointing Pros: *Handmade tortillas *Decent carne asada *Attentive service Cons: *Torta ahogada *Lackluster salsa *Price The Torta ahogada is sort of like the Italian Beef here in Chicago and is considered a classic Jalisco delicacy but sadly it was terrible here at Las Picosas. To give you an idea what a Torta ahogada is, you basically take a torta and ""drown"" it in a spicy salsa and considering you want to taste authenticity if you want it Estilo Jalisco which is the idea at this supposedly ""authentic"" place means ordering it with a pork meat filling(think carnitas) with whatever else you may or may not enjoy. Plain and simple it sucked The bread was a bit stale which is partially intentional considering that you don't want the damn thing to be mushy and fall apart in your hands but the meat holy shit the meat was flavorless and tasted partially old (to give you an idea what I am talking about imagine that you cooked some braised pork on a Monday and then reheated the remaining leftovers on Wednesday) and the salsa that the torta is drowned in? Bland and for a place calling itself las Picosas it was all bark and no bite my friends. The prices were also a bit too high for the dinner options and while I had the carne asada taco it was mediocre considering that two places close by Zacas and Mis Tacos have superior meat in my opinion.This place is in trouble as far as I am concerned, considering they hype up their Torta ahogada to be their signature dish I think plenty of people are going to be disappointed it's a shame. *TIP* You can order the Torta ahogada to be half and half: half salsa and half dry bread but with meat still on the dry side so don't you worry.

2013-01-29,2.0,"Ate here once and it was OK....guess we forgot because when we went back we experienced the same. Hot salsa, not chilled... OK...but it tasted like bland tomato sauce. The tacos were average. The burrito, well the tortilla at best was ""not fresh"". Tried their style of fries...ordered a large (if what I got was a large - I do not wanna see what they send out for a small) they come with ketchup, mustard, and mayo on them. Good, yes but for almost $3 not worth it at all! I wanted to try something new and they offer a Torito (?) I think that is what it was called. It is a sangria soda with red bull, chile, lime, salt. I ordered it to go. First drink all I got was SALT...not table salt but a hard rock salt...there was so much chile in it, that by the second (and last drink) my stomach began to hurt and my throat began to burn....did I mention this was a $5 drink??!! Yep, you have been warned. Average to below average food...way to expensive for what they serve and how much they serve.
