Italian beef was dry, and the sausage looked like it has seen better days.

I called back and asked for them to send my salad; after waiting an additional hour and a half for the food to come, and I called and asked for a refund for the salad ($7.95).

Foods alright.  There's better pizza in Chicago for sure, but Bella's has its place.  However, someone needs to actually train their customer service staff.   Today I ordered a pizza for pick up.  I was told an hour... Knew she was off (partly because she asked for my address, partly because I know how long it takes to make a pizza, and mostly because its happened before) so I walked up there 20 mins early and my pizza was just sitting there... you know, waiting to get cold.   Few weeks ago, I called to order a pizza and was put on hold.  Several times after hearing them pick up and immediately place me back on hold without saying a word, I hung up.  Gave them ten minutes to get their stuff straight and then called back.  Someone picked up the phone and slammed it back down not once, not twice, but five fing times. Seriously here's your training plan: If someone says pick up it will be ready in 35-40 mins and there is no need to confirm there address since we aren't using it. If its delivery then it's 45-1hr 15 based on how busy we are (estimate should be provided by the kitchen and delivery staff or manager on a regular basis) Do Not hang up on customers (ie people looking to give us money) - grounds for immediate termination If you have to place a customer on hold, ask for their permission.  They won't say no. If you have to place a customer on hold a second time, you must ask them to hold a second time.  They really only agreed to the once.  Again they won't say no.

I can't actually give Bella's any stars.  I've eaten in the restaurant more times than I can count and my roomate has eaten at the place since she was five!  On a few occasions in the past, I've had their pizza delivered.  This evening, I called to have a pizza delivered and was told by the girl who answered by a rather rude and obviously dim girl who tried to first convince me that my address did not exist (???) and --here comes the worse offense--that apparently where I live is considered ""south side"" and ""people get robbed, shot, stabbed there ...you'll need to come to the door and meet the driver--it's our new policy"". I hung up on her before she could finish spouting her foolishness.   Advice to the owners:  1) Do not let the dummies answer the phones.  Maybe let the dummies shred the cheese (if you think she can manage the sharp edges) but do NOT let this person ever answer your phones again until you give her some training on what not to say to people--my roomate LOVES your pizza--she's eaten there since childhood and has fond memories with her family at Bella's.  At least she used to....she won't be eating there again.  Maybe you don't care, but you should. 2) Rather than telling me that you won't take my money because you're afraid I may hurt you--even though you know that you have record of delivering to me in the past here is a tip for you:  SET A DELIVERY AREA.  Then you can discriminate to whom you will and won't deliver--especially us ""south siders"" as your employee told me or anywhere else you feel is unsafe for you and your staff. Now,, I live in  Pilsen and I love it and I work so much that I rarely cook for myself--I am always getting dinner delivered and no one has ever told me that I needed to meet them outside to get my food when they delivered it nor have I been denied delivery.   I really like your pizza, but I can't give you my money--your employee made that clear.  Apparently, cash from the 60608 isn't cash that you can accept.

2008-01-27,1.0,I got pizza from Bella's the other night and had the worst experience.  First off it took my pizza over 2hrs to get to my house.  Second when we called to check up on our order they told us 2 or 3 minutes the 20 minutes later still no pizza.  We then called again and they said 2 or 3 minutes and 10 minutes later no pizza.  I then called and asked to speak with the manager and he told me the pizza guy was outside.  So I ran down no coat in the Chicago winter only to find no pizza.  I then called back and asked for the manager once again and he hung up on me the customer.  After that I was outrageously mad and called the manager again and he yelled at me the customer.  Finally the pizza showed up and it was cold.  I asked the driver for the owners name and he could not tell me he didn't know.  I have never been treated like this by an establishment.   Don't get pizza here they are shady and the first location prolly burned down due to insurance fraud.  If they care that little about customers they prolly don't care about cleaning either.,-0.9414,0.857,0.03,0.113,0.453858024691358

2007-03-15,4.0,"Bella's is the best greasy thin-crust pizza in the Bucktown/Wicker Park area. Delivery is always swift and I've never had any issues. The Caesar salad is my favorite side.

But life cathces up with you and sometimes...you only have enough strength to pick up a phone and dial out for delivery. This is the place I usually dial. Yum. I've been ordering from here for ages. AGES, I tell ya! And the pizza is just as good today as it was many, many years back. Their pan pizza is good, but...let me tell you...their thin crust pizza is to die for! I grew up eating thin crust pizza -- THIS thin crust pizza -- and while I've found other places that are very tasty, no other places compare. Plain and simple. Want an appetizer? Their rib tips are pretty dang good, and their mozerella sticks are penis-like in size and shape (oh yah. I said it.)...and taste really good, at that. They have never screwed up my delivery order. The people I've dealt with there have always been friendly. The delivery time is relatively quick. And the price is right. What more can ya ask for?",0.9682,0.827,0.142,0.031,0.5232142857142857

I agree - the slices sitting around can be a hit or miss - be sure to grab it when it has just arrived. You can tell if it's been sitting around for a bit but it's never sitting around for more than an hour or so so don't be too worried :) It's okay to dine in. It's nothing fancy.
