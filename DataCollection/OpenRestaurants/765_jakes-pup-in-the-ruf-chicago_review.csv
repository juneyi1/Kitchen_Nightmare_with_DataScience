2017-08-30,1.0,"Serving Old chicken... and a little racist??! It's kind of tough to write this review because I always love to support local small businesses.  I have been to Jake's many times over the years and have had hit/miss experiences...However, this was pretty bad on a couple levels so I figured I should share. Problems: - CHICKEN: My girlfriend went to order us some chicken and also get an ice cream cone while she waited.  She specifically asked for new/fresh chicken (because we have seen them on multiple occasions give old chicken if you don't ask specifically for fresh chicken..fresh chicken should be a given).  The woman taking the order acknowledged her request for fresh chicken so all should be good.  Normally, we have to wait an extra 10-15 minutes if we want fresh chicken which is fine.  Before the order was ready, my girlfriend had to wait the normal 15mins...no worries.  What we received was two obviously OLD pieces of chicken and one fresh piece.  Please see the included picture and judge for yourself. - ICE CREAM: As mentioned, she ordered an ice cream cone to have while she waited.  Instead of getting the cone, the (latin)woman taking her order decided to wait and take the order of the (latin)gentleman who was next.  He also ordered an ice cream cone.  She immediately got his cone and gave it to him and then left to work on something else.... then came back after a few minutes and then gave her a cone.  This may sound small but the experience of it felt clearly offensive. I feel our job as reviewers is quite simply to give an honest account of our experience at different establishments.  I have to say I'm honestly offended and disappointed in Jake's.  Hopefully, in the future they will always provide fresh chicken to their customers(without having to ask for it to be fresh) and they will treat all customers fairly. Jakes, if you see this review and would like to speak with me, I am happy to discuss this situation with you. Have a nice day.",0.9877,0.801,0.151,0.048,0.5748132586367878

This isn't some locally grown, organic, superfood smoothie bar, it's a greasy spoon.  I've had the hamburger before and it was just ok. As others have said the bun doesn't hold up and it was loaded down with a lot of damp veggies which didn't help matters.  I stick with the gyros when I go. The meat is great but the tzatziki sauce could use some more flavor. Their fries are excellent, always cooked right (crispy) and are plentiful.  When I'm in the mood for something familiar Jake's has become my go to spot. Food is good and everyone who works there is pleasant.",0.9648,0.799,0.159,0.042,0.592063492063492
2017-03-18,1.0,"We ordered a triple cheeseburger, jumbo shrimp dinner, and six wings for ~$29 after tax -- not worth it even if it were FREE. The food was super greasy and gave me diarrhea afterwards. The triple cheeseburger tasted freezer burned and low-grade quality beef patty. The beef patties were under seasoned and overly greasy. The bun fell apart after the first bite Jumbo shrimps were extremely heavily breaded, under seasoned, and the little shrimp inside was dry, rubbery, and overcooked. While the term used for shrimp sizes are not regulated, the shrimp size in this dish was no where considered ""jumbo"" or even ""large."" $13.99+tax for 7 medium sized shrimps, some french fries, overly boiled corn, slaw, and a slice of white bread roll was highway robbery! The wings were also under seasoned, dry, and overcooked.  I normally don't care to judge a restaurant for the service if the food is decent, but the lady that took my order was just really rude and dishonest! I tried to use my  restaurant.com  voucher here and she initially wouldn't accept it because she thought it could be a fake copy. I insisted it was not fake. Then she told me that I was supposed order the food ""on the app"" (what app???) and redeem the voucher online, which is total bullsh!t. I patiently explained to her how the voucher works and told her she needs to call the number on the voucher and redeem the voucher #. She told me to call instead. WTF? Finally after several more back and forth, she gave in and called. We got our food about 15 minutes after we placed our order and only had about 10 minutes to eat the food and get out before they closed. One of the restaurant employees came up to us and yelled at us, ""HEY WE'RE CLOSING!"" Had the lady not wasted her time trying to swindle us out of using the voucher, we would've had more time to eat.  I should've just left Jakes the moment the lady gave me a hard time about the voucher. Instead I chose to give myself possibly food poisoning.

I've lived in Buena Park off and on since 2003, and I've had hot dogs and hamburgers at Jake's quite a few times over the years. It wasn't until last night, however, that I finally tried Jake's broasted chicken. For this type of food, it was outstanding. My husband and I each had 4-piece chicken dinners, which included a near-ton of fries, cole slaw, a big chunk of bread, and margarine. The chicken wasn't all batter. There was a lot of meat on the bones, and it was cooked perfection. The coating was a little greasy, but it was flavorful without tasting of burnt oil. So often, I find that fried/broasted chicken tastes like overused oil! Jake's broasted chicken, on the other hand, was savory. The food isn't quite gourmet, but it's solid for this type of food. The price of the four-piece dinner was also reasonable since the food was abundant and delicious. My husband and I have always laughed at the window painting that states something like, ""Only a rooster gets a piece of chicken than Jake's."" Funny, right?

I ordered it to go and was grateful that the drink came in a bottle because that makes it more portable. I had already decided that when I got home later, I would doll this sandy up with some fresh chopped lettuce, chop up that onion, dice some tomatoes and cucs. Then I was gonna mix up that too thick yogurt stuff they thoughtfully put on the side with some hummus to make a tahini like sauce. And that's exactly what I did.

2009-11-21,4.0,"I'd like to follow my review of a running shoe store with that of a fast food place. I had avoided Jake's for several years. It looks shady and has crazy cartoons painted on its windows.  Everyone needs a place, within walking distance, to go to get hangover food. I didn't have one and had even bought a cheeseburger from Bojono's once (don't do it, just stick to their pizza). After reading some promising reviews of Jake's I tried it out. First a shake (huge and pretty good) and then a cheeseburger (thin patties but it hit the spot and helped my hangover). Their polish is next on my list.  Yeah, the clientele can be scary to some but it's Uptown. I generally see woman (mom types) working there and I trust that they're not going to mess with my food. What sealed the deal for me with Jake's? After skimming through the book ""Never Put Ketchup on a Hot Dog"" what place did I see in there? Jake's!",0.8029,0.852,0.095,0.053,0.5888888888888889
2009-10-20,1.0,"From the many times I drove by Jake's, I was at first intimidated to try this place, namely because of the neighborhood and the many characters you may find wandering in that area. Alas, one night, since they closed the closest KFC that I knew in my area and was tired of going to Popeye's, I decided to be adventurous and ventured into Jake's. Considering on how hungry I was, I ordered one order of the fried chicken, with fries and cole slaw to share with a friend. The chicken was dry...I mean...VERY dry...almost as dry as the state of Arizona.  I don't know how long this chicken was sitting on that heat lamp, but from the taste of it, probably from that same morning. Fries...tasteless.  Cole slaw...runny. If I wanted to abuse myself like this, I would prefer going to McDonald's late at night...even their oldest burger will do compared to what I consumed from Jake's that night!",-0.4295,0.862,0.066,0.072,0.6148809523809523

2009-09-17,4.0,"On the corner of Montrose and Sheridan, across from the Jewel, there's this place called Jake's that ""serves breakfast anytime"". Its windows are painted with crazy characters resembling food - from corn and fish to burgers and hot dogs - and I'm pretty sure it's been there longer than my parents have been alive. It's also a place you can tell has seen all the changes that the neighborhood has gone through. This is Jake's...chicken specials advertised on the window, offering all things fried and deep fried, and most importantly, breakfast anytime. We stopped by one morning to check things out. First, be warned. Uptown is just different (for lack of a better word), and even though we were there at 9 a.m. there were still plenty of  ""interesting characters"" from around the neighborhood up and functioning (or not-functioning in public places) at that time. But along with the ""locals"", you'll find city workers getting in a late breakfast, the coffee drinkers reading their papers, and people just stopping in before going to do whatever they do at that hour. They also have a pretty good selection of 25¢ machines, and claw games - even one that promises a win every time if you're up for it. Jake's serves the basic breakfast foods that you would find anywhere else in the city. Bacon, eggs, toast, sausage, biscuits, pancakes, and they serve them in dishes, 2-this, 2-that, and 2 of these or that. But they also have breakfast sandwiches that are served wrapped to-go . I'd take a real cooked breakfast sandwich from this place over Mickey D's, any day, because you know it's not pre-made. You have to wait for it, and it's greasy enough to take care of that last glass of beer you shouldn't of had the night before. We opted for the same sandwich, the bacon, egg, and cheese, served on two pieces of toast. We weren't let down. I'm not saying they do anything special or different at this place, but it's just the fact that it was a real breakfast, with real products, served the right way -- and that was enough for me to write about it. We ate ours in the outside patio which consisted of four black iron mesh tables, enclosed in a black rod-iron fence. The streets provided the entertainment. Go to Jake's at least once in your life, but don't expect a Starbuck's crowd.
