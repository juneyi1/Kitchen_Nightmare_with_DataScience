2017-06-17,1.0,TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I have NEVER experienced this before. I have been a strict vegetarian for my whole life because of my religion. And there was a piece of steak in my burrito that we stated to be a COMPLETELY VEGETARIAN order. The lady in the front was so rude about a refund. And started yelling at the restaurant to my friend that went to get the refund. Then I went back in to tell her that what she said was wrong. She was going ahead and gossiping to other customers about this IN FRONT OF ME. So I stepped in right away. Absolutely ridiculous. Got my refund and was told never to come back. So don't worry. Will never come back again. First and last time.,-0.8836,0.835,0.044,0.121,0.4650510204081632

2016-02-09,2.0,"The only good thing about this place was the actual food. Lemme give a break down: Chips and salsa: The chips were SO BLAND. Literally hard and old looking with no flavor or salt. It was served to us in a basket with two napkins laying on top of it and the waitress also brought out the green and red salsas... but in bottles. How on earth are we supposed to dip our chips in bottles? So long story short the chips were gross and the salsa was difficult to eat with them.  The food: I personally got a chorizo taco and 2 corn tortilla steak quesadillas which were absolutely amazing. My friend got 2 steak tacos and said they were very good. The tacos were relatively big and came with many toppings (although we ordered them almost plain). Overall, no real complaints about the food.  The service: So. Horrible.  The waitress was okay most of the time but was very short with us. Towards the end my friend and I were going to pay but I had a question about the check and the waitress just decided it would be easier to have separate checks. The waitress said ""Oh so you're paying credit?"" before leaving the table. We had a bus to catch so we stood up at the counter to pay and when I tried to hand her my card and she said ""oh, we don't take credit, only cash."" Are you kidding me? Why wouldn't she bring that up while she was at the table, she obviously recognized we were paying by card before. I just handed her cash and we walked out.  The physical restaurant: It is tiny and pretty shabby. The menus and just up at the counter and you have to get them yourself. There were probably a total of 4 tables and 4 chairs at a counter, probably all of which could use tightening. Everything seemed kind of dirty and out of date.  Overall, I really wanted to like this place. We put in a lot of effort to get there and were severely disappointed as soon as we walked into the tiny restaurant and were served the bland chips. The service was so horrible that it doesn't matter how good the tacos were, we will absolutely not be returning.",-0.2331,0.784,0.105,0.111,0.5254100529100528

The salsa was weirdly gelatinous and the cheese was philly-cheesesteak like.  Not awful, but certainly nowhere near SF/LA standards.  It was like junk food burrito, rather than nourishing meal.  Perhaps the tacos are better.  Burrito is roughly $10, tacos $3.",0.8725,0.729,0.167,0.103,0.7033509700176367

2014-04-27,4.0,"Dig.  Came here around lunchtime on a Saturday.  I was expecting it to be slammed because of all the students who live in the area, but maybe they weren't awake yet, because there were only about 3 other people in there (all eating in).  My friends have long talked about this place as the perfect post-bar food, but I've just never partaken when I've been on that block.  This time I tried takeout for lunch, and I thought it was a really solid joint.   SOPE: Had a pastor sope, and it was THE BUSINESS.  It was layered with all kinds of tasty things.  Really quite filling, too.  You'll definitely need a knife and fork, and not flimsy plastic ones either.  I think the sopes are the sleeper hit here.  Check 'em out.  (Although I haven't tried the huaraches yet, so maybe those will be even better...) GUACAMOLE: Tasted really good.  Chock full of onions and cilantro, not overpowering with the lime.  I usually don't like tomatoes in my guacamole because they tend to make it watery, but this was actually great.  Chips were a little greasy, but that's what you get with freshly fried chips, so whatever. TACOS: I had an asada taco and a cochinita pibil taco.  Both were great, and they're much bigger than at many taquerias.  Like maybe twice the size as some I've had, because they're stuffed so full.  For $2.25 each, I think that's totally fair.  (Yes, at some other places you can get tacos for $1.75, but they're smaller.)  I actually was so full from the sope and the chips & guacamole that I saved these for the next day, and they were still good.  Two tacos were more than enough for lunch, and I am a hungry girl! SALSAS: Not very good.  The salsa verde tastes like a tin can.  So maybe get takeout and use your own salsa. I'm not sure what the food is like late at night, but the daytime cook did me some solids. Yes, the place is dingy.  No, the service is not going to blow you away.  This is a taqueria, dudes.  They make good food, and you eat it.",0.993,0.811,0.146,0.043,0.5333462833462835

2009-12-19,1.0,"I think that the only reason this place is still in business is because of it's location right next to three bars! I guess if you're drunk, just about anything tastes good & you don't really care how you are treated by staff. The woman that took our order was quite aloof (which is fine...I think I would be too if I had her job). The wait was average (this was for take-out).  When we got home, I quickly opened my food because I was starving. I ordered the enchilada meal (beef). The first bite I took was disgusting because I heard a ""crunch"", which felt like dirt or something was in my food! After spitting that first bite out (yes, I was THAT hungry!), I pressed my luck again hoping for no more crunches. Luckily, that was the only one. Now that I could actually focus on the food, I realized it was quite mediocre at best. Everything was watery & just kind of bland. Even the re fried beans, which I normally love, were not very good.  My girlfriend had a steak burrito. I tasted it and it was a half step up from my meal (which does not say much). The steak was full of chewy and fatty spots which I spit out into the trash can.  Needless to say, we will not be going there again. It is disgusting!",0.8769,0.808,0.113,0.08,0.5832315832315832
2009-09-02,4.0,"I've always really liked this place, and it's open super late (like 4 or 5 a.m.)   I was a regular when I regularly would stumble out of Jackhammer after doing and drinking bad things.  Always hit the spot, consistently good, but do know this is more a taco/burrito joint than a 'full-service' restaurant.  Last time I was there, the prices had gone WAY up (like not the incremental 25-50 cents but like a LOT), so points off for that.  I guess if you don't raise prices for several years, makes sense that they go up mucho, but still.",0.7541,0.874,0.102,0.024,0.38782051282051283

2008-06-16,2.0,"husband and i are exploring clark's taqueria's from devon north. this was our first stop. Quesadilla with chorizo. a few gristle bits in there. Too much chorizo, not enough cheese. Picadillo (ground beef) taco. Kinda like sloppy joes, not in a good way. Cochinita pibil taco. Perfect. With cilantro and onions. Bbq pork in a very earthy, spicy sauce. Chochinita pibil dinner. Good. but the taco's better. Dinner doesn't come with onions and cilantro, which is what made the taco so good. Jeremy had to salt the beans. What? Pineapple pop. Fine. But wanted tepache (pineapple beer). Out. also asked for Mexican coke. Out. not very reliable menu, eh? Small dining room with crazy guy wanting to make conversation. Don't think lady at counter knew much English. salsa forgettable.  Would only come back if dying for a pibil taco.",0.4218,0.851,0.084,0.065,0.4541666666666666

It seats about 15 people max. They have very authentic and rib sticking soups with corn and pickled veggies. Super tasty.
