And average sushi tends to be a turn off for me.  However I can absolutely recommend one roll that was good. The California roll was fantastic. Although that's usually a given at most sushi places.

2017-05-05,4.0,"The moment I walked in the door, I knew having lunch here was going to be something fantastic! The restaurant itself is very small with six tables and ten counter spots, so we chose to sit at the counter where we could watch the chefs work their magic. The instrumental music was soothing and the decorations added a lot of character, creating a relaxing ambiance. We arrived thirty minutes before lunch service ended and I feared we would be rushed out, but no need to worry; the staff was very accommodating to us and paced the dishes appropriately, which was great because we ordered a lot!! We started with Gomaae and it was so flavorful! It was presented in the shape of a mushroom, and when I cut into it, the vivid warm spinach mixed with the nutty sesame sauce created a smooth blend of sweet and savory. The Ika Masako, squid topped with tobiko, was firm and bubbly; the flying fish eggs popped in my mouth as I happily chewed on the squid slices. The Spicy Tuna Salad was large and creamy with hints of heat and notes of citrus. The sesame seeds sprinkled on top added a delicate crunch.  I picked the steamed Wasabi Shumai dumplings because the combination intrigued me, and it was great! The green wasabi wonton wrappers added spice to the pork filling and there was no need of the delicious side of dipping sauce. The Kani Su salad was a tart and sweet blend of real crab chunks and sliced cucumbers in a rice vinegar sauce. The crab on top was shaped to look like a crab...adorable!  The Baby Octopus was marinated in a fantastic sauce and warmed my soul as much as my stomach. The texture, flavors, and flushed color of the octopus made this my favorite dish. My friend loves salmon, so he chose the Boston Roll, and I thought the simple combination of salmon, crisp lettuce, crunchy cucumber and avocado was clean and delicious. I chose the Caterpillar Roll with  fresh water eel and cucumber wrapped with avocado and it tasted just as great as it looked! For our third Roll, we both said 'Chicago Spicy Crazy' at the same time and it was meant to be! This Roll is Playful and D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S The tuna, salmon, white fish and white tuna each had big flavor and the spicy sauce, avocado and cucumber enhanced the proteins. The fiery color of the masago coating was the perfect touch to this STAR of a roll! The Tiger Eyes was a Beauty and reminded me of an M.C.  Escher drawing, an eye within an eye. The knife cuts were clean, the flavors in the smoked salmon were rich and robust, and the sauce in the center of the plate was Devine!  Watching the chefs prepare each dish with such focus and precision made me feel I was in the kitchen of their home, not in a restaurant. I also appreciated the to-go orders packaged in large plastic containers  showcasing the beauty of the rolls instead of cramping them. I will definitely order to-go from here in the future!!",0.9988,0.753,0.209,0.039,0.5234245187436678

The chirachi meal is an excellent way to try several types of fish, and the lunch special is an excellent deal.

2016-10-15,3.0,"Greentea is one of those neighborhood spots that'd be easy to miss. It has a 6-8 seat sushi bar, and a few other small tables surrounding the bar, for about 20 seats total. The food was ok -- I really liked the Chicago Spicy roll, which had a really interesting blend of flavors. Some of the other rolls didn't have the same freshness/flavor I was looking for.  The service was probably my least favorite aspect of dining here. They seemed to fill takeout orders ahead of dine-in, which we saw from our seats which were close to  the sushi bar. They served rolls as they came out, which was a plus. The prices were also very reasonable, and the place is BYOB. But because of the slow service and average fish quality I probably wouldn't return.",0.7967,0.89,0.081,0.03,0.515888888888889
2016-10-03,5.0,"Green Tea is a largely unrecognized and completely surprising gem. Though the number of reviews might suggest that the first part is an inaccurate statement! Every corner of (virtually) every Chicago suburb is populated with ""corner sushi"" spots. You could not possibly try them all. We ""invented"" (in quotes to acknowledge that many of you may feel like you ""invented"" it) the ""sushi crawl"" to try to address this outage: ride the L, get off at a stop, hit as many corner sushi spots as you can, get back on the L to the next stop, repeat. Sadly, we're too big of pigs to make it last more than 3-4 stops in any ONE neighborhood! So it's kind of an unrefined, maybe failed, concept.  Though, in reality, most such spots are pretty average, some even flat out bad. So maybe that is another reason that the ""sushi crawl"" might be a failed concept. Green Tea is an exception to this sweeping statement. It is a tiny, unassuming BYOB, seemingly like so many but Green Tea is different. Green Tea is good. Green Tea is damned good. I have today written another (rave) review about an exceptional sushi spot at the other end of the spectrum, Naoki. I would not presume to compare Green Tea to Naoki. They are different beasts and it would not be fair to either to attempt this comparison. However, during our recent foray downtown we had Green Tea for lunch and Naoki for dinner (sushi explosion!) and the latter did not retrospectively color the former in a bad light. Both were very rewarding experiences. I have seen reviews that suggest that ""regulars"" would prefer that you not know about Green Tea. This is understandable partially because it is tiny, TRULY tiny with a sushi counter that sits maybe 6-8 and maybe 5-6 (small) tables. I guess the PC word is ""intimate"". So, if ""regulars"" want to be able to walk in whenever they want and get space (GT takes no reservations), then it makes sense that the rest of us not know about it! For that matter, why am I telling you about it? I want to be able to walk in whenever I want too! So forget that I said anything! It sucks!  However, since the place is small and the staff always looks familiar, I am guessing that this is the way that these people exclusively make their living They clearly work hard and deserve to make a living, a really good one based upon the quality that they offer. So, THAT is the reason to tell you about it! These people deserve to succeed. If that means that I have to wait, or even be turned away, then good for them! As would be expected from this ""type"" of sushi restaurants, the rolls are prolific, numerous, and featured. However, they are also good. When we go for ""sushi"" we typically go primarily for sashimi, taking the snob's approach that if you eat rolls, you are not (really) eating sushi, ""Oh, pshaw, Miffy...that is what Trad said"". This is not fair. Rolls certainly have their place...just typically that ""place"" is in a ""place"" where the fish is not good!  We broke with tradition and tried quite a few rolls. We put them to the test trying ingredients that can easily be botched (maybe even make you sick) at lower quality places: oysters, scallops, uni (not that we tried any rolls with the last, just nigiri there). They were all awesome, well-prepared; good, fresh ingredients. While ""good"" rolls are not necessarily surprising, we were VERY happy with what we tried. Green Tea's rolls are not good, they are exceptional. What was truly surprising was the quality of the fish. In addition to the tour of rolls, we did our typical lineup of our standard 7-9 sashimi cuts. We found the flavor, texture, and temperature quality of each and every cut to be exceptional. This is not always the case at ""this type"" of restaurant. For example, the ""super white"" tuna, often called escolar, is very often served partially frozen. Though the entire matter of this ingredient is controversial so let's not visit it further! When so many sushi bars of ""this type"" fail so monumentally, bringing you big, chain grocery star quality nigiri, how does Green Tea manage to deliver sashimi that is of exceptional quality? We could only come to one conclusion. They must really know what they are doing! They have done it EVERY time that we have visited. While I do not want to wait for my table when I go to Green Tea, go try them and help keep them in business and thriving! People deserve to make a living in this great, albeit currently troubled country of ours. Talented people doing an honest day of hard work REALLY deserve the best. And if you question the sincerity of those stated motives, then just help keep them in business so we can continue to enjoy them for our own selfish, evil reasons!

I still dont know how I was charged that much but i tipped the waitress what I perceived she deserved based on her service. It wasn't too little because we all split checks, but she had the audacity to come back to the table complaining and demanded a higher tip. She wouldnt let me leave unless i tipped her more.

I sat at the sushi bar and the guys who were helping me didn't know very much. I asked what fish was the freshest and they told me the lobster.  I laughed & they laughed self consciously  and said I'm sure the lobster is always fresh and then the sushi chef in charge told me the snapper was fresh that day. I could see inside the glass case and some of the fish looked very dry and not so good. I ordered the fried tofu with peanut sauce to start since I was undecided about the fish.  The salmon looked the best so I ordered one salmon sushi and one snapper sushi.  The head chef prepared it as I waited quite a while for both the tofu & sushi order.   Luckily I read it is BYOB and brought a beer to enjoy.   The placed filled up quickly and it was apparent they had a few regulars.  I was hopeful for my food to be tasty.  It was just OK.  The tofu was very hard on the outside, not just brown but actually hard; the peanut sauce had good flavor.

Overall the rolls are smaller than what I usually pay for but again prices are very reasonable for the location.

The shumai was tiny but it did come in 5 pieces. Fried tofu tasted very much like fried bread - maybe they freeze the tofu first? Interesting texture, sauce was good and the serving was generous.

The dining room is approximately the size of a walk-in closet, but the food is good and the seafood is fresh. Having relatives who work in the seafood business, I get irrationally pissed off when I look at the sushi prices at most restaurants. I know a bowl of delicious seaweed is not worth $20. That being said,  Greentea is very fairly priced for its excellent quality. And that's not even factoring in the technical skills of the chefs!  I've never tried the sashimi (not a fan of it in general), but I've tried most of the sushi offerings and no duds have turned up. My favorite appetizer is the volcano, especially in the winter. Service is good, but then again there are only four tables and a bar fitting 6-ish people to look after. A meal for two has been anywhere from $30-$60, depending on hunger levels.  Street parking is a mixed bag, as it usually is. I'm still subconsciously on the lookout for the Hummer that stopped in the tow zone in front of my car and decided to open its trunk door into my hood. By the time I got out of the restaurant to see the the delightful dent, the Hummer was gone and none of the surrounding security cameras caught its plates. But I digress.

It's very unfortunate that I've got to write this review, but people gots to know.  This USED to be a fantastic little gem, with fantastic value.  I was excited to live so close to a sushi joint that had reasonable prices, and good, quality fish. Greentea is no longer worth going to, especially with the myriad of other options you've got on Clark.  I'm not really into the ""super imaginative maki,"" scene. I like eating fish, and I like the fish to mostly speak for itself.  If you happen to be into the really overblown maki, this place will not knock your socks off.   Ah, the Sashimi Platter.  The ONLY gauge, in my opinion, of the quality of a sushi place.  If an establishment whose job it is to serve raw fish to the public can't manage to serve that shit fresh, then they should burn the place down and collect insurance money.   I waited to write this review until I went back after the first bad experience I had a month ago. It happened again. I had the most disgusting piece of rancid fish as a part of my sashimi platter -- 2 times in a row now.  I'll spare you the details of what happened when I put this in my mouth, but it was not good.  Imagine eating a 3 day old washed up Asian Carp that you found at North Ave. Beach   Want to eat sushi on Clark?

It's a small room with only a handful of 2- and 4-top tables and eight spots at the sushi bar, so it gets crowded quickly, as we saw. We started with an order of shumai that came with an unusually thick teriyaki dipping sauce. As the order had a odd-number of pieces, we both eyed  the last one for a few minutes before deciding who would get it. (Solution in future: two orders.) For dinner, my companion had the Sushi A combo with one substitution ($1 extra), and I had a shrimp maki and six pieces of a la carte nigiri (2 each of striped bass, albacore, and shrimp). The fish was fresh, the rolls were cohesive and tasty, the seaweed was crisp...in all, we had a decent meal for not a lot of money.",0.0258,0.972,0.015,0.014,0.4249999999999999

Thing with Chicago sushi-eaters (as opposed to west coast) is that everyone in Chicago loves maki, probably because super fresh nigiri/sashimi is hard to come by.  And seems people love creativity. I on the other hand am more a west coast sushi eater -- love love fresh fish.  Leave cream cheese to bagels.   That being said, green tea has fresh sashimi and the value is the best in town!  The traditional maki are top notch.  They use fresh snow crab for their california rolls, they have quail eggs, 5 types of roe and the uni is always fresh.   They even throw in some creative maki (crunchy roll, chicago, crazy spicy) are all awesome because their fish is just so fresh!   Cant say it's the freshest in the city, because that would be Katsu, but I would spend 3x the cost for that freshness.   What I love - Sushi C combination:  just a combination of heaven! for 18 bucks!!  love the uni, love the roe! - Salmon don:  the quality of their sushi rice is unbeatable, topped with 5 slices of delicate, delicious salmon, accompanied by home made japanese pickles.  presented beautifully.  amazing. Service;  the place is very small, a lot of their business is via take out orders, so there usually a wait for a table if you come on friday/sat nights.  after seated, maybe have to wait a bit, but if you come during the week, this shouldn't be much of an issue. can't say more great things about the food. oh and don't forget BYOB.",0.9967,0.712,0.26,0.028,0.5679461279461279

The first time I had their sushi I ordered out and it was great! Super fresh, great presentation, and a great price.  Then I dined in with a friend and it too held up to the five star rating.  But the last two time I have been there they have been terrible!  A friend and I went to the restaurant to eat in.  We waited maybe 15 min for a table which was fine but the annoying thing was that we waited 45 mins after we placed our order!! It was only a few rolls and a few pieces!  The most annoying thing, there was another group that came in about 10 mins after us, were seated and had a bunch of food on their table in about 5 mins!!!  They where finished by the time we got our food?!?! WHAT was THAT! Annoyed but full. I decided that I would try them again, this time I would take away, I mean hell they have great food!  So I picked up my food and noticed that all the sushi was just kinda thrown in there, no real presentation, def. not like it was the first time I ordered out!! Then I got home and there was no ginger in the box, no wasabi, and the fish was just ok!  So this review is for Greentea mostly!! You guys need to keep your quality control, people expect something and when they don't consistently get it they will leave!  I hope you guys will change and do this because your so close to where I live and I love supporting the small guys!  Hope you Do, I will be back but it will probably be the breaking moment if its like the last two time!",0.9231,0.765,0.137,0.098,0.5001262626262626

From start to finish, it's like pulling teeth. If you call for pick-up, you'll be met with a 10 minute ""hold please"", a busy signal, or the telephone companies long delayed silence, and then buzzing. (that last one confuses me everytime) My attempt at sidestepping the poor service, by ordering it for takeout, and showing up at the stated time (an hour later), failed miserably. When I showed up, there was at least 10 others people standing in the 4x4 waiting area, near the door. I'm not sure you can call it a waiting area though, seeing that you are standing on top of the 3 tables near the window, and shoulder to shoulder with the people at 6 seats at the bar. As I waited, for the first 30 minutes, I actually expected the food to be made at any time. As the next 30 minutes passed, I began to contemplate on walking out. I waited for another 30 minutes, and finally, I got a 'head nod"" that I was coming up soon. The woman at the cash register, throughout the whole process, fumbled her food-tickets, looked panicked, and had an overall difficult time filling orders. I'm not sure where the ordering equipment came from, but I believe it dates back to the Carter Administration. With their popularity, there is no reason they haven't upgraded the equipment, and I can't see how they can keep customers content when one has to wait 2 and a half hours for their food. And I can't understand why no-one ever took the time to say...""Hey, we are behind, I'm sorry, we'll be with you as quickly as possible"".  In a fast paced city, I think people deserve a bit more punctuality. I guess these owners hit the jackpot with their prime location, because NOTHING, is worth this type of wait.

2010-02-12,1.0,"The food here is good, but I'm giving the place ONE star because of a truly horrifying experience I had here this evening. I loved this place but I will never return. First of all, I travel all the way from the South Side to go to this restaurant. That's a trek. But like I said, the food is great despite it's truly lousy atmosphere and service and if I'm in the mood for sushi and want to get out of Hyde Park, I'll go to Green Tea. Tonight I ordered an avocado roll, a ""crunch"" roll, and 2 pieces of salmon nigiri. The first course came and it was fine, as did the second. But the nigiri took at least 30 minutes to come after I ordered it, and the restaurant, which holds 25 people was only at half capacity, if that. The first piece of nigiri was very good. The second still had a bit of that irridescent connective tissue attached to it, so I couldn't bite it. And I tried it even holding in my hand. Now, I probably could have sawed through with my incisors if I wanted to, but that's unappetizing if not utterly gross. I like my fish disembodied, thank you. That hits a little too close to home.  Anyway, the waitress is very slow - nice, but UNBELIEVABLY slow - and I had already waited 30 minutes for two pieces of nigiri (what was the chef doing, forging the knife and going to Alaska to catch the salmon just for me?!) so I brought the intact piece with BITE MARKS - flipped over so he could see the offending tissue that was preventing me from tearing the fish - to the sushi bar (there was only one guy eating at it, all the way to the end), and VERY politely and VERY quietly, practically in a whisper, asked the chef in charge (who is also the owner, come to find out!), for another piece because I couldn't bite it. I returned to my seat. I work at a restaurant so I completely understand that things aren't always perfect. Next thing I know, I hear him yelling for me to come back, saying he'd ""never heard of such a thing in his life"" and he ""gave me the best part of the fish"". Now, it may have been prime meat (it was, I could tell) but it still had that tendon-type stuff attached to it so I couldn't enjoy it. So he tells me that I'm wrong. That I should come and pick out the part of the fish that I want. I tell him that whatever part is fine as long as he doesn't cut it so close to the skin that that happens again. He, again, tells me I am wrong, and sarcastically cuts me a super-thin piece. I tell him that I want to leave and just will take the check instead. So he yells at me - YELLS at me like a father yells at his KID - in front of the whole restaurant. Then he MAKES me take the nigiri he cut despite the fact that I just asked for the check in an effort to end the insanity, and he doesn't even hand it to me - I had to reach over and get the dish myself. This sounds fake, I know. But I'm dead serious here. All of the customers were staring at him like he was nuts because he was yelling at a young, female, quiet customer for something that he had done. I kept saying, ""can we stop arguing please?"", and he yelled ""NO!"" and kept telling me that I was wrong and rude for asking for a new cut. All this over a $1.75 piece of nigiri. Sound a little irrational to you? Oh, and I still got charged for the piece, not that that should surprise you at all given the owner's response to my request for a new piece of nigiri. So to recap: the owner of Green Tea cut the fish wrong. I politely asked for a new piece that I could chew, and he yelled at me and told me I was wrong, then cut me a tiny piece and forced me to reach over and retrieve it to take back to my table, despite the fact that I had told him I wanted the check instead. It was like a scene from a movie. Notably, as a waitress, I still left my server (who was pretty bad, never once checked on me), a 20% tip, because I didn't want to take out my disappointment with the owner on her. Unless you think that patronizing a mean guy who would actually humiliate a customer loudly in front of the restaurant for HIS mistake is worth it for some good sushi, I wouldn't recommend coming here. There are dozens of other sushi places within a mile-radius of Green Tea, and they may only be 90% as good, but chances are, the owners of these other places won't verbally abuse you if you have a concern.",0.9097,0.756,0.132,0.112,0.5040066154502773

Well, there were only 5 tables and the sushi bar (which can seat 7), but there were people constantly coming in and signing up to wait. On top of this, the entire 1 1/2 hours I was there, the phone was ringing off the hook for carryout orders.  So down to business. My friend and I waited about 20 minutes for a table. Not bad at all. We sat down in the corner by the window and were given wine glasses for our Riesling. Yep! This place is BYOB, which means that on top of enjoying the delicious food that Green Tea serves, you can wash it down with your drink of choice. My friend had a few sushi pieces, including the Uni, which they proclaimed was one of the best they ever had. We shared some rolls as well, which were all very good. I don't eat raw fish, however this was the first time I ever ate a raw spicy scallop maki and it was great! What makes these items so good are their affordable prices. We ordered 5 rolls. Three of them were under $3, and it doesn't go incredibly higher. There are many different rolls to chose from, one of which is a Chicago Roll which, I saw, was in the shape of triangles instead of circles. I have never seen anything like that before; it was very interesting to see.  I have to mention the wasabi because it was Oh-so-good.  VERY fresh and spicy; the way wasabi SHOULD be. I must warn everyone who is a stickler for great service. You might not be happy here. Although it is a small restaurant, there is only one girl working as a hostess, waitress, carryout person and busboy. She can only move so fast, and she does try to move fast.

That alone should tell you how great this place is!  We ordered 5 rolls and a cucumber salad for dinner. The rice is really good, tasted fresh, not like it had been sitting around all day. Green Tea doesn't do anything really experimental, so if you're looking for a deep friend roll of octopus brains covered with seaweed foam, try elsewhere. Green Tea has simple rolls, but what they do have is GREAT.  We got 2 avocado rolls, 1 spider roll, 1 tempura shrimp roll, and 1 philly roll. My sister likes the cream cheese --I don't-- but she assured me that it was fantastic. The spider roll was good and the tempura shrimp roll was simple, but good. On the plus side, none of the rolls were swimming in sauce. I wanted to order a crunchy roll, but we were just too full. The rolls are a little bigger than I'm used to, so my sister and I pretty much had to roll home ourselves!  Our bill was almost $25, which I think is the least amount I've spend on sushi for 2 people since moving to Chicago.  Also, It's BYOB and there is no corkage fee, so bring some Sake!! The restaurant itself is tiny, decor is non-existent, save a few waving happy cats on the bar. At first, I was hesitant to try this place, but it was great. I would DEFINITELY make the trek in from Oak Park just for Green Tea's sushi.  And I agree with Eric H., it's totally comfort food sushi.

My mom had never had sushi before, but I convinced her to try it when she was in town visiting me.  Now, she won't stop talking about how much she loves sushi and wishes they had a good sushi place in Richmond. If you're looking for a solid, quick dinner option, call Green Tea! special note: restaurant closed on Mondays.",0.9891,0.75,0.25,0.0,0.4765664160401003
2006-06-24,1.0,"The sushi at Green Tea is good, but it only gets one star because of the service. I called for delivery and they asked if I could hold, I say yes and they put the phone down on the counter (I could hear all the noises in the restaurant) and I waited for more than 15 min before I decided to hang up. I waited a bit longer and decided to go to the restaurant and order in person. I was the only person standing/waiting for service and nobody acknowledge me even though the saw me standing there. I waited another 15 min before I left and went to EDO SUSHI where they actually have good service and good sushi.",0.9217,0.889,0.111,0.0,0.4988888888888889
2006-05-07,2.0,"I am not impressed with Green Tea.  In fact, I found the spicy tuna roll and the spicy salmon roll to be sub-par.  For that reason, it is not even an option for me for a neighborhood sushi place.",-0.3724,0.932,0.0,0.068,0.65
2006-04-22,5.0,"If you aren't a fan of Green Tea, I think you need to have your head examined! A friend introduced me to Green Tea about two years ago.  We were looking for a sushi lunch in the area, and she said she had found this fantastic new place on Clark.  I didn't think it could be as good as she was saying, but it exceeded my expectations in every aspect. My most recent trip was no exception.  Green Tea is a small room - there are only around 6 tables in total, plus 6 seats at the sushi bar.  They do a hefty delivery and take-out business, but being as my friend and  I don't live within their delivery boundaries, we always go into the restaurant.   Green Tea mostly sticks to traditional rolls of fish and rice - you won't find too many rolls with massive amounts of cream cheese or other such fillers in them.  They have the best spicy tuna roll in town.  You can tell the fish they use is as fresh as it gets, and they use just the right amount of spicy sauce so that you can still taste the fish.  My other favorite roll is the crunch roll.  It's spicy salmon inside of a roll that is deep fried in tempura batter, then covered with eel sauce.  A bit frou frou for the sushi purist, but wow, is it good.   If you're looking for a trendy restaurant, or if you're looking for a romantic joint, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for quality, reasonably-priced sushi, stop by Green Tea.  You'll want to come back - and the wait staff knows it, as upon leaving, they'll all say ""See you tomorrow!""  :)",0.9893,0.837,0.14,0.023,0.549695616883117

There are few tables and a sushi bar. My favorite rolls are black mushroom and avocado.  (I am a vegetarian) Also, the chef is pretty funny.  You always hear him say ""see you tomorrow"" on your way out.=))) I highly recommend this place.",0.969,0.723,0.277,0.0,0.7019444444444445
2006-03-29,5.0,"Green Tea is one of my favorite local sushi restaurants.  The service can be slow at times, however, the excellent and fresh definitely makes up for that.  I'm a fan of putting ginger dressing on everything (not all restaurants are up to par with their ginger) but I love it here!  Try the dragon roll - the presentation will put a smile on your face and the taste will bring you back for more.",0.9505,0.77,0.23,0.0,0.4454545454545454

2006-02-12,3.0,"One day I was visiting a friend who lived in this neighborhood, and I decided to stop in for lunch. It was totally random. I had never heard of this restaurant, nor am I a Japanese food connoisseur. Nonetheless, I had a taste for something outside of my comfort zone. I was seated near the chef and ordered two non-sushi items (can't remember what they are called). What I ate was a super finely chopped salad of avocados and other green ingredients. Although the serving was quite small, it was delicious and satisfying. This restaurant has a cozy and intimate ambience and is also very clean. I actually liked the green-tea inspired wall color. Three and a half, maybe four stars.",0.9731,0.779,0.203,0.017,0.5261458333333333

2005-07-12,3.0,"""If you're the kind of person who just loves sushi and likes to eat it whenever possible, Green Tea could save you a lot of money. It's reasonably priced and the sushi is pretty good. If you're a sushi snob and will only settle for the finest fatty tuna, you're going to be dissappointed. Green Tea's casual decor make it a better lunch spot than dinner destination. Perhaps Green Tea's strongest asset is the sushi chef who inevitably bids you his goodbye by chirping ""Ok, see you tommorrow"" as you walk out the door. At least you leave with a smile, right?""",0.9726,0.725,0.239,0.035,0.6060224089635854
