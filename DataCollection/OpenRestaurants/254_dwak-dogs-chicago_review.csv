So i'm not sure the exact addres or phone number or anything. But this is a hotdog stand/ cafe. Which is wonderful, because I love hotdogs and coffee, and this place has both. I've only been here a couple of times but the food is pretty good and it's pretty cheap so what more could you ask for. It would be more like a 3.5 stars, but I'm going to round up.",0.9693,0.756,0.217,0.027,0.6988952020202019
