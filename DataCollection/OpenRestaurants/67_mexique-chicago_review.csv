2017-09-03,2.0,Venue was quaint and cozy. I like the obscure storefront. They do not have a full bar and they don't make cocktails. Odd because the bar area takes up half of the space. The menu is visually a bit confusing because it highlights the seven course dinner and all the appetizers below it so at first glance you think it's all the appetizers that's part of the seven course dinner. The server was not able to explain it well. I had also asked if the entrées came with anything such as a soup or salad and he said yes when in fact that isn't the case. He was able to explain the entrées well but he had no idea of the other questions I was asking regarding the menu. So I asked my husband to explain thinking that maybe I just was articulating well and the outcome was still the same. The presentation of the food was beautiful but the flavors were very confusing. I got the pork belly with the mole. It was good but the side taco of the octopus just made it confusing. My husband got the chicken and was not impressed with the flavor and felt that the broth made everything too mushy. Everyone has a different pallet and should likely try this place out for their own opinion but we were not impressed.,0.5297,0.851,0.084,0.065,0.5804545454545454
2017-08-21,5.0,"Normally I have a reasonable expectation of what to expect when going to a restaurant. I don't expect fine dining when grabbing a burger from a whole in the wall and if some place is getting a lot of hype, my expectations can be high. I didn't know what to expect with Mexique, as I hadn't heard much about it. It was recommended to me and wasn't too far from my place, so I booked dinner there. Wow. That's all I can say. It's rare these days when there are 400 sources for restaurant reviews to have a place surprise you and blow away your expectations, but that's what Mexique did. The food was outstanding, every dish ranged from very good to excellent. We started with beef tartar and shredded chicken, with the chicken being a standout. The mix of Mexican and French cooking was amazing. I even ordered as an entree the chile relleno stuffed with ratatouille, a tough sell for a carnivore like me, and it was delicious. The chef came over to check on our meal and was very friendly. The restaurant was clean, modern and played great French cafe music at a reasonable volume. Really, they just did everything very well and the food was some of the best I've had in a while. Definitely recommending and going back to try out some other dishes. The atmosphere was casual, but it felt a bit like some people under-dressed (shorts? really guy at the table next to me?). I'd say upscale casual is the best description.",0.9975,0.734,0.256,0.01,0.5551851851851852

Wonderful tastes in 6 courses. Brief descriptions don't do the food justice....each has 4+ ingredients, and they all work together to deliver a fabulous experience. We all had different favorites and everyone felt satisfied at end of meal. While the menu changes, you can count on a couple of seafood dishes, as well as meat, all done uniquely and expertly. Efficient service, too, as we were finished in less than 2 hrs. Not inexpensive, but very good value.",0.9626,0.788,0.212,0.0,0.7406060606060606

Even though I had had interesting and delicious tacos somewhere else the day before, the tacos I had here exceeded those by a mile.

2017-08-02,2.0,"Where to start? I wavered between 2 and 3 stars for this review. I suspect I already went into this experience with a chip on my shoulder, not being a fan of costly fine dining unless it's truly worth shelling out, but I'll do anything to celebrate an occasion with friends. What followed, though, was nothing short of an SNL parody of a dining experience.  First, the waiter spent AT LEAST five minutes at the beginning of the evening explaining to our table how restaurants work and regaling us with the contents of the menu (which was also sitting in front of us). Then, he politely cautioned us that the portions are very small, so if we're hungry, we'd better order accordingly. This presented quite a dilemma for the vegetarian and vegan at the table, who already had slim pickings to choose from. Fortunately, we could all agree on a pitcher of the sangria, which tasted sickly-sweet but arrived in a cool-looking vessel.  The parody continued when my friend ordered a meat dish (the asada) done ""medium""--only to have the waiter caution her that the meat is very, very lean, so perhaps it would be best if she ordered it ""medium rare or medium.""  So... she stuck with medium. By this point, we had a hunch that a solid feast did not await us.  I ordered the salmon, which I must admit was well-cooked and tasty. However, I'm pretty sure anything would taste good if it was sitting in a bowl of butter, as this salmon seemingly was. My poor vegan friend ordered the watermelon gazpacho, which was poured into a bowl in front of him with great flourish from a small pitcher (which was then whisked away even though it still had some gazpacho in it). The waitstaff made a comical show of adjusting each of our plates as they set them down in front of us--an inch to the left, an inch to the right, it's still butter soup with a slab of salmon!  One last lament--if saccharine sangria is not to your taste, the best beer you can hope for is Tecate. The drinks menu is sad, and cocktails are nonexistent.  I jest, sort of, but the whole experience would have left me with a bad taste in my mouth... except that my mouth was already full of butter.",0.9934,0.792,0.153,0.055,0.49000512032770105
2017-07-23,5.0,"I've had lots of Asian-inspired Mexican food, and Lots of French-inspired Asian food, but this is the first time I've had French-inspired Mexican food, and boy, was it good! The food is nothing short of spectacular, and defies all your expectations for either Mexican or French cuisine. It's Mexican-influenced modern dining. The essential thing is to get the tasting menu. It offers six of the menu's highlights in small portions that give you an idea of the vast range of the kitchen's skills. On off-nights, or if you go early enough, you can ask for an eight-course tasting menu that is even better. The people around us were ordering two courses each, and the servings were huge, and ended up costing almost as much as what we paid to taste our way through much of the menu. The wine list is quite short, but the selections are reasonably priced and perfectly chosen to accompany the food. Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the wines, and did our wine pairings herself. Each wine perfectly matched the accompanying course. I can't remember such a consistently excellent set of pairings. And yes, there were eight wines to match the eight courses, with about a two-ounce pour of each. At $80 for the six-course ($100 for the 8-course) tasting menu, it's a great deal. And the $40 wine pairing ($50 for 8) is a no-brainer.

We came here for brunch during restaurant week.  My wife had the restaurant week menu - it was a good deal because it was three courses for about the price of two, but honestly it's a bit heavy for brunch and the standalone brunch options are about $12 each.  Also, the restaurant week menu did not quite follow the theme of Mexique - that is, a Mexican take on french food.  Either way, the butternut squash soup was delicious.  The fish taco was okay, but the fish lacked crispiness and could use a little more flavor.  The bread pudding was a lot more bready than we expected but it was pretty good. I got one of the regular brunch options, the cazuela de puerco (basically a steak and eggs-type dish with scrambled eggs, black beans, a chunk of pork, cheese and potatoes).  I thought it was pretty good - pork was tender and eggs not overcooked - but there was a random streak of something spicy that went down the middle of the plate, so the dish was unevenly spicy.  I think I would be willing to come back here, but my wife probably wouldn't.",0.989,0.852,0.148,0.0,0.458501221001221

The inside is a decent size - not large, but not small.  It was very cozy and I don't mean because the tables were on top of each other.  It was just warm and inviting inside.  They have a large bar, but what I didn't realize is they only have wines, beers, and sangria.  I was taken aback at first, but I love wine, so no issue.  We ordered a pitcher of sangria (the smaller size for two people) and it was delicious.  I definitely felt the wine by the end of the evening. Our initial server was not that great.  We had told him that it was our first time at the restaurant and I don't feel he offered great advice on items to order.  Fortunately, we read online about the chef tasting, but he didn't really tell us (maybe he didn't know) what all the items were on the tasting.  It ended up being a great way to sample the menu ($85/person). We started with the ceviche - which was delicious and had a little habanero sauce and gave it a nice little kick.  We then had the soup - which was a poblano pepper/cauliflower (?) mix, and it, too, was extremely good.  Those were definitely our favorite dishes of the night, and I almost would go back for those two.   Next was the salmon on top of a creamy roasted corn.  I don't like salmon, but with the corn and tomatillo sauce, it was good and not as fishy as salmon usually tastes to me.  Next we had a bread appetizer with pate (not at all a fan).  Next was the pork belly with roasted brussel sprouts.  As some of the other reviewers mentioned, it's not a fatty pork belly (thankfully), and it was pretty good.  Lastly, we had the duck, and neither one of us were a fan of this dish.  Interesting flavors together, but nothing great.  For dessert, we had the rice pudding/white chocolate and ice cream dish.  It was an odd combination of all textures, and again, not a fave of mine - mostly b/c I'm not a fan of rice pudding. So overall, our night started really high with the dishes, but as we moved more into the entrees, my husband and I didn't care for them as much.  If we were to go back again, I would stick with the starters and small plates and make a meal out of that.  I am very glad that we got the chef's tasting b/c it allowed us to taste different items, and we were definitely full by the end.",0.9941,0.788,0.153,0.058,0.498044794188862

While I know this is a highly rated restaurant based on food, I'm also taking customer service into consideration.  It's a very intimate atmosphere. If you want to kick back with beer and tacos this place isn't for you. Granted I've researched the restaurant before we went just to know what i was getting myself into.  Our server was somewhat nice, but wasn't helpful. It seemed like he didn't enjoy our group size or the questions we were asking. He wasn't cheerful or happy when he greeted us. He never asked if it was our first time dining at Mexique and never explained the menu. As a 4 star restaurant all the servers should be educated in all the food items and should speak with the guests about it. He clearly saw our confused faces but never bothered to speak with us.  I called ahead and asked if they accept children and if they can accommodate to them. A lady told me yes and they can make tacos if we wanted to. I thought cool! But when I asked the server he looked at me dumbfounded. I told him I had called ahead of time about my child. I asked for steak tacos, and he proceeded to say, ""I will see if the kitchen can do something"". That doesn't sound reassuring does it? He wasn't friendly either. Needless to say my son did receive his tacos. He loved them. Three tacos with giant pieces of steak. Can't beat that.  I had the mar y tierra entree which I loved.

2017-01-18,4.0,"Interesting take on traditional Mexican food. I stopped by for brunch and ordered the chicken enchiladas, cazuela de puerco (similar to a pork belly hash), and a set of tacos (two lamb and one al pastor).  The tacos were definitely the highlight of the meal; the ingredients were thoughtfully put together, and I especially liked the coffee braised lamb. The al pastor was quite different from the traditional taco-- a little more sweet from the pineapple, a little more spicy, and a little less of the typical smokey flavor, but good nevertheless. The enchiladas and the pork belly hash were decent but quite salty. Overall, I would say this was more of a 3.5/5-- a nice deviation from the typical pancakes and waffle brunch, but nothing that really left me excited to come back again.",0.9601,0.826,0.163,0.01,0.5067901234567901
2017-01-18,4.0,"My husband and I went here for a date during restaurant week 2016. We love Mexican food and were intrigued by the French fusion aspect. Overall, the food is wonderful. We tried everything they offered for restaurant week menu, splitting it between us. My husband was wary of trying ceviche because he wasn't sure that he'd like it, but he absolutely loved it. There were some interesting things I was almost afraid to try. Avocado for dessert threw me -- I'm not a huge fan of mushy textures, but the taste and textures were delicious every time. The wait staff is incredibly attentive and helpful for choosing our meals. And you know you can trust a place's food when they apologize that something isn't available because there wasn't an option at the market/from their supplier that was fresh enough for them, so they had to substitute something else. Overall, this is a great place to visit that's outside of downtown and offers interesting, great food. We'd like to visit again outside of restaurant week to try their other food (and maybe some wine pairings!).",0.994,0.732,0.239,0.029,0.5026620370370372

2017-01-13,5.0,"Just got home from dinner here and had to review it right away.  Honestly when I first showed up I was disappointed my friend had chosen this place-  seemed very pretentious.  Limited menu with high prices, they were serving something on a log at the table next to us, chef was hob-knobbing with some couple at the table on the other side, bread came with chicken pate (which I'm not a huge fan of) instead of butter... I wasn't enthusiastic.  But the decor was nice, the waiter was super attentive without being overbearing, the whole ambiance was comfortable.  Then the food came and I was in love.  I got the steak with goat cheese fondue and I can honestly say it was one of the most perfectly cooked, delicious steaks I've ever had.  And the goat cheese fondue was perfect.  I told my friends after I finished I really wanted to lick my plate clean but knew that was inappropriate.  One friend got the Mar y Tierra and couldn't stop raving, she said the main dish was great but the side was the biggest surprise with how delicious it was.  Third person got the duck and also loved it, and creme brûlée for dessert.  And after judging the place because I saw the head chef shaking hands with the very well dressed table next to us when we walked in, thinking they must be someone important, I realized he was just super attentive and went to every table to make sure they enjoyed their meal, and checked every plate as it came out of the kitchen to make sure it was perfect.  I've been to a lot of the nicer restaurants in Chicago and have never seen a head chef put such a personal effort into making sure every single diner was happy.  A NY strip, potatoes, and one glass of wine came out to $65 so it's pricey, but the quality of food and service made it worth it for a nice night out.  I'd definitely recommend Mexique.  And if the chef reads these reviews, I'm sorry for silently judging your restaurant when I walked in- the level of personal attention you showed really shone through in the quality of the food and service!",0.9982,0.736,0.236,0.028,0.6320494864612513

We don't usually do the fancy dancy dining so we were a little taken a back when we got our appetizers- pretty much like Mexi-que que??? The meals look like mini- art projects which is fun for Instagram but not for a starving mom post work-out.  They definitely deserve creative props for whipping up some interesting dishes but it seems in their effort to get funky they dropped the flavor plate. Don't get me wrong the asada dish, and shrimp we had were tasty but not WOW- not when I can drive twenty minutes south to Little Village and get three times the food for half the price. Oh and the meat was salty... this coming from someone who shakes that stuff on everything. We also had dessert which was also very pretty buuuttt just meh. My chocolate cake was actually black on the bottom so not sure if that was an artistic move or what but when I bake black means burnt. We also had the arroz con leech and that was a hit. I think I would have rated them higher if the restaurant was more fun. It really lacks personality. Like what Mexican restaurant has beige walls and no horchata, Abuelita, or any other Mexican non-alcholic drink?? The music was cool, seating intimate, location sketchy, parking so-so. Not authentic, but not bad. I think I might try brunch next time and see if that's where all those awards on the wall come from.",0.9892,0.779,0.172,0.05,0.4701178451178451

2016-12-19,5.0,"I read Daniel C's review and he enthusiastically agreed to go with me to Mexique for their Restaurant Week lunch menu in February. I died. It was amazing. And ever since that day I've been begging to go back. I finally got the opportunity in November. We all died while exclaiming, ""Why did it take us so long to experience this unicorn?!"" I am literally speechless when it comes to describing the magic that Chef Carlos Gaytan dishes up for every single menu item. You'd look at a seemingly mundane name - Butternut Squash Soup, for example - and it takes you to a new world. I would spend more time singing the praises of Chef Gaytan's creations except that they change. It's likely that it won't be on the menu by the time you go. What I will tell you is that you'll emerge a new person. At my insistence, M tried the soup in November. She doesn't normally care for soup but this soup had her pining for it weeks later. Now she orders soup hoping to be recreate the dream she experienced at Mexique. It's not just the food. It's the service too. We had a three-year-old with us and none of the employees seemed bothered. In fact, they were impressed with her budding foodie palette as she ate the oyster appetizer right alongside the grownups. They gave her a quesadilla with fancy cheeses to satisfy her while the rest of the party immersed themselves in regular-sized entrees. Another thing that I love about Mexique is that there is easy street parking. You might not snag a spot right out front, but you could always go around the corner where there aren't any meters. I also enjoyed the bus ride and (I know from personal experience) that Chicago Avenue is easy for biking. The last thing that I love about Mexique is that it's in the West Town community of Chicago. It's unpretentious - possibly not even cool. Some go-to restaurants are popping up but there interspersed with dollar stores, laundromats and places that residents (not tourists) need. People who go to Mexique kinda have to know about it and intentionally seek it out. It's a treasure and I love that.",0.9948,0.821,0.153,0.026,0.5748144712430427

With the exception of the ceviche (which seemed both small and uninteresting) everything was absolutely wonderful. The beef tartare appetizer was the best I've ever had-- I really loved the combination of flavors (adding guacamole was genuis!) and couldn't get enough of it.  For the entrees, the duck and the lamb were cooked perfectly- as was the insanely large portion of pork belly (although the verde with it was ok).  I loved that the pork belly wasn't just fat.

We told the waiter our honest opinion when asked - yet it still appeared on our bill with no apology though it was inedible.

It's near by and the price was right (not that that is what's important) Guac was solid. Rice and beans were an afterthought. I have had better from a can and box. Green chorizo taco was very good and probably the one I would order again. Pork belly was too sweet. It kinda reminded me of Peking duck. Actually Peking duck would have been better. Octopus taco....wait, why would you beer batter an octopus and put in it a taco? It was all greasy batter and no octopus. Seriously, I took one off the taco and it was 75% dough. Tongue was good. Carnitas were okay though the recipe I make out of Cooks Illustrated is way better.

While they were both good and relatively filling, both dishes didn't stand out in the way I was hoping. It just felt like the flavors were missing a kick.

We adore mussels and have them all over the world.While the broth was tasty, the mussels tasted old and entirely too fishy. Either they need a better seafood source, or be emphatic about the freshness.    When our meals arrived, all were covered in green sauce. My guest had hers replaced, I just shut my mouth and ate the green. They liked the enchiladas, but didn't rave. As I expected,the green sauce was too spicy for me and the waiter didn't seem to notice that I had drained all my water and most of my husband's.the steak in my chilaquiles was ordered rare.

I have had a lot of mussels, including many moules frites during my stays in France, but the mussels with chorizo here have one of the best broths for mussels I have ever tasted. The seafood tamale is subtle and tasty, and the chile relleno is bold, but really good as well. This time all food was presented on different plates that worked with the particular dish.

We had the soup du jour, which was a delicious combination of clam chowder mixed with chopped fruits and herbs. I also ordered the ceviche as a starter which I was only disappointed wasn't larger. I am used to Peruvian ceviche which is typically served in large quantities and with lots of 'Tiger's Milk'. The ceviche at Mexique is certainly more like the Mexican variety as it was not served with hominy or sweet potatoes, or drenched in citrus. Instead, it was lightly drizzled with citrus and served with high quality cuts of white fish of unknown variety. For the entree, we ordered the Costillas and Chile Relleno. The best part about the Costillas turned out to be the full-bodied sauce which was composed from mushrooms, truffles, and a raspberry temper glaze. I preferred the Chile Relleno however, which was packed with delicious dried fruit, tomato fondue, and served with a delicious Queso Azadero. The sangria was tasty and light if you enjoy fruity drinks. I recommend making reservations for earlier in the evening as this place fills up quickly!",0.9912,0.759,0.193,0.049,0.6160989010989011
2016-02-27,5.0,"The last time I dined at this Mexican-French fusion restaurant, I wasn't a Yelp reviewer. But I can still remember the mussels, my favorite part of the meal. Considering the number of meals I've eaten out since then, that says a lot.  A friend and I recently visited Mexique for lunch, and being a creature of habit, I ordered the mussels again. They were just as fabulous as I remembered. Plump, fresh...  in a pool of white wine, dried chorizo and tomato-saffron beurre blanc. Definitely one of the best presentations of mussels I've ever encountered, too. Followed this with the empanadas appetizer... two of them, each filled with a different kind of wild mushroom. Yummy, but they could have used a little more sauce. My friend had a spicy, creamy chowder with fresh apples... she raved and raved about it. She also had the beat salad, which was a hit.   The coffee here is fantastic... and it's so rare to get a really great cup of hot coffee anymore that I always try to remember to point it out.  And instead of just refilling our cups, our server brought out fresh ones. Classy.  More about our server... he was beyond excellent. Answered every one of our questions without hesitation. I don't like my food too spicy, but my friend does, and all of his recommendations were spot on. Never hovered, but always seemed to be around when we needed him. The ambience is perfect. A comfortable, attractive room that's not formal or stuffy... and you can carry on a conversation without raising your voice. Can't imagine why I stayed away so long, but already have a dinner reservation in two weeks. Mexique is located in West Town, with plenty of street parking.

It was a flat tortilla was a whole bunch of toppings. The steak was just a tad over cooked, but I didn't mind too much. Would rather have it cooked than see blood coming out of my food. The best part of the dish was the goat cheese sauce. I don't know what else was in there, but I swear I would drink the stuff if they gave it to me in a glass. It paired really well with the steak.

Next the food, so delicious and unlike any Mexican food I've ever had. The dishes seemed creative, great depth of flavor and were beautifully presented. They start your table with a complimentary chicken liver pate, which was very smooth and had a great chipotle flavor. Next, for starters we had the mussels and the ceviche special of the day. The mussels were very good, with some spicy chorizo giving some kick to the broth. The ceviche was one of the best things I've ever eaten. They pour this green sauce over the top table side that is super well balanced with acidity and spice, it is seriously the best sauce I've ever had. If I'm ever in the area again, I will be tempted to just stop at the bar for an order of ceviche! For mains, we had the short ribs, the lamb and the duck. We all loved our dishes, just really great components and super delicious when you had everything all together. The short ribs were falling apart at the touch of my fork, just as they should be, over a really yummy parsnip purée.  Our server said that the lamb and the duck are menu favorites and they did not disappoint. The duck came two ways with leg confit and seared breast. The standout on this dish was the mole, just really great depth of flavor. The lamb came with two chops that were good on their own, but this dish was amazing when you had a bite of everything together... lamb, pepitas, feta and the sauce. So delicious.  They topped the night off with bringing by a complimentary dessert for my birthday, which was a really yummy passion fruit custard with a fruity granita on top. Really different and interesting flavors.  Thanks Mexique for a memorable birthday dinner, I will definitely be back!",0.9983,0.753,0.238,0.009,0.6127963525835868

When making a reservation, I explained that it will be a family birthday celebration for my husband with my 13 year old son. Their staff were completely and totally prepared. We were placed at a large table (great for sharing plates) and our waiter Hose, offered to serve all the sauces on the side for my son - which was incredibly thoughtful! Our picky eater was in heaven!! Later one of the desserts (which ended up being a house treat!) came out with birthday greetings for my husband in chocolate sauce:) Both deserts were extremely delicious, we picked Tres Leches and The Chocolate Cake essentially a warm chocolate soufflé with rich ganache in the center!!! Yum!!!!  Now about the food!!! I was truly impressed with their unique spin on Mexican cuisine with a French twist, every sauce is a work of art! Every plate comes out beautiful (please see pictures) We shared two starters, a ceviche (the best crudo I had in a long time!) and a seafood tamale, but they also serve their bread with a side of chicken liver pâté which is an outstanding complementary appetizer in itself.

Chef Carlos is always around and saying hi to the customers which is cool. However, last night, when my beef short rib entree arrived, I started eating and I noticed what I thought was a piece of calamari that had fallen into the dish by accident. I looked a little closer and it turned out to be a RUBBER BAND in my food! I was embarrassed to say something but we called our server over and showed him. He took the dish away and promised to make a brand new one for me. He came back a few minutes later and told me that after speaking to the kitchen staff, he learned that there are no rubber bands anywhere in the entire restaurant, that they don't come on the produce or use them for cooking, so there was just NO way that the food could have come with a rubber band in it (!!!) - He implied that I took a rubber band out of my purse and put it in the dish to get free food! Ha! Then, when the check came, he told me he gave me a 50% discount on the entree. I guess you can get half off your dish if you find something inedible in it. I felt very disrespected as a customer. We will NEVER be going back, and I am not surprised that Mexique has been going down quickly in the Michelin ratings these last few years.",-0.7483,0.866,0.053,0.081,0.3145696091348265

As a couple young hung over 20 year olds we did our best to not be obnoxious.  We ordered the pork belly and the crab cakes. The crab cakes were quite good. It did not however blow my mind or make me question my existence. They did not feel like they had much filler, had the appropriate amount of sauce, and came with the most potato-ey potatoes I have had in a long time. The pork belly however while well seasoned, was a little on the dry side. We expected it to be melt in your mouth juicy.  I thought the place had a very peculiar array of music playing.

Thought they would tell us they couldn't serve us but they welcomed U.S. and we're soooooo nice. Service was fantastic and our server George was a sweetheart. But the food...OMG It was amazing! Started with the French toast served with cinnamon ice cream. So flavorful and not too sweet. Then we had the mussels.  MUSSELS! Had bits of chorizo and onion and the sauce was so good that my friend and I debated just picking up the bowl and drinking it down.  Then our greedy asses had the nerve to order more! I had the cazuela with crab cakes and my friend ordered the cazuela with braised pork belly. Both dishes were great but that pork belly had me at hello.

Mar y tierra was a standout, an interesting combo of pork belly, scallops and brussels sprouts in a lively sauce. For dessert, arroz con leche was comforting and tasty. The beer list features many Mexican standbys; the wine list was a bit disappointing, with many French bottles but few Spanish (e.g. tempranillo, garnacha, graciano), and higher prices (mid-40's at the bottom) than I prefer.

The ambiance was wonderful - dimmed lights, warm flooring, evenly spaced tables, and soft music that played in the background. There was plenty of chatter against the music but nowhere near enough to distract me from my conversation.  Onto the food and drinks... Our waiter greeted us quickly, offering us tap or sparkling water. We opted for tap and decided to splurge on a medium carafe of hibiscus sangria. It was enough for two glasses per person - less money than if we were to each order two glasses. It was delicious and fruity, by the way, with just enough tangy punch. For primeros (small plates), we got the daily ceviche special, the tinga de pollo (shredded chicken dip + chips) and a pork dip dish, the name of which I can't recall. No matter - every single dish my fiancé and I agreed was spectacular! For platos fuertes (main), I got the asada with goat cheese fondue and my fiancé got the pescado special. We both cleaned our plates because both dishes were so good. I would later come to find through a delightful chat with chef Carlos that the asada was Lea Michele's favorite dish on Top Chef. That was cool to discover. Finally, for dessert, we got the tres leches. It was delicious, creamy, fruity, and full of coconuty delight. Highly recommend! For me as a fan of Top Chef and fine dining, the highlight was meeting Chef Carlos. He stopped by all of the tables and spoke with patrons with a warm smile on his face. He happily took the time to listen to a star struck diner blather on about what a wonderful experience she had at Mexique, and seemed to genuinely care about what she had to say. Yeah, spoiler alert, that diner was me.  Mexique is five-star dining with amazing food, great service, and an owner/head chef who cares about his patrons.

We were honor to have a chance to talk to Chef Carlos.  Chef Carlos is a very humble Chef that took time to visit our table and talk about his career and experience being the head chef of such delicious Mexique and for my opinion best Mexican restaurant with French Fusion and very nice music.  I give Mexique A+ for food and services.  fresh, clean and excellent ambiance.",0.9964,0.748,0.252,0.0,0.5579338842975207
2015-05-08,5.0,"Honest review: best mexican food in Chicago hands down no chiptole or some crap like that really one of the best meals of my life. Come here if u want to have the best meal of ur life get steak tar tar,sopez, asada,lamb, tres leches banana cake. Appetizers: free starter two types of frizoles with bread the brown ones were better then the black ones i ate it in a couple of seconds the bread was really good but needs to be grilled or put into oven really soft Pescamal: this was one of my least favorites. It was good but nothing was great about it it was crispy the fish was fresh but no wow factor trio of sopes: omg this was so fucking good. The sopez are supper crunchy perfect texture not greasy at all. All of them were delicous the shrimp and the snail ones were the best though. The shrimp cooked perfectly the chiptole sauce really knocked it out of the park. The snails were so good not chewy at all the sauce really complimented the other ingredients in the dish. The mole one was great best mole i ever had jus wish there was meat in it though this is a must order be mindful though they are small Beef tartar: this is the best tartar i have ever had in my life. They put alot of truffle oil which is great because in my experience they never put enough just like a little drop of it. The guacamole was perfect gave the dish perfect texture one of the best guacs of my life. The bread was perfect only thing though really thing an broke easily we used the bread from free appetizer. The egg on top added another layer of richness which would be my last meal on earth Asada: it was perfect cooked perfectly supper tender and flavorful not bland! The potatoes were so good they were so decadent. The sauce was so delicious made the steak taste so much better didnt make me miss blue cheeze it needed more of the sauce though!  Cordero: omg i love lamb so this was a home run it was supper tender not tough at all the crust on it was perfect. The sauce was to die for idk what it was. The eggplant was so good they were so soft not chewy and they were sour so it cut through the richness of the lamb because of the tamarindo  Duck: omg this was so good i love duck the skin was so crispy nothing worse then soggy skin. It was so tender. cooked perfectly. The sauces really brought out the flavors of the duck. One was sweet the other was sour. My mom kept eating it and she doesnt like duck. The tamal on the side was the best tamal i ever had only problem to much oregano  Tres leches: omg best tres leches i ever had supper most suppr flavorful. The cake was so good. The powder on the side was so good. The ice cream was perfect not over worked or supper melty really enhanced the dish Banana cake: this was one of the best meals of the night. The basil sauce was to die for so fucking good it added a rich savory note that i never experienced before so interesting and unique. Then it came with ice cream and more powder!! Only problem was cake was a little dry Panna cotta: this i didnt like there was no wow factor the besr part was the guacamole mouse and cinnamonn tostadas they were so good i ate it in one sec Icecream wit guava: loved it really simple not to sweet just really hit the spot Service: the hostess wasnt the best she didnt greet us the waiter was so nice described everything perfectly and gave great recomendations! The chef was the greatest so nice and humble gave us two free desserts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ambiance really beautiful perfect for date nights there was alot of street parking so i liked that nice bathrooms All in all idk why it lost its michallin star one of the best restaurants i have ever been to i hope they get it back worth the expensive price will come back again",0.9998,0.607,0.326,0.066,0.5865373309817754
2015-05-08,3.0,"Well, this was a nice restaurant. The food was creative and over all well executed. The French-Mexican thing works well.  I went a few weeks ago and had the tasting menu (10 courses) with the wine pairings. I'll say a few things about why I'm not rating it higher. First, I love high-end Mexican, and this place really seems to fit the bill. But, while creative, there was noting particularly exciting about the food. Nothing really surprised me. Probably the best courses were the coconut broth soup that started the meal and the scallop that came somewhere near the middle. The service was fine, if a little un even. Wine pairings were not always well-timed with the courses, and one course came out unevenly.",0.9842,0.76,0.24,0.0,0.46491228070175444

2015-02-17,3.0,"My better half and I hit this place for our V-Day dinner at her request. I was very reluctant to try it, as I was not seeing how Mexican and French could be married somehow. Sometimes, you just have to give it a try, so I did. The place is quaint yet modern, cozy and intimate altogether. Our wait time was literally, non-existent. We started off by ordering some appetizers; the tinga de pollo and the pork dish. Both were very well prepared. I was trying to see how both styles fit the dishes being presented. The chef has taken the traditional Mexican flavors and incorporated then in a french style cuisine. While we munched on these, we also ordered the pitcher of sangria; very good, not too sweet, but not too overpowering. Here's the big drawback I saw in the main menu; for the most part, I thought the main course selection was too small. Expanding it to include more meat, seafood and poultry could be more appealing.  Not many people are fans of lamb, duck or rabbit so the choices on the main entrees were disappointing in my view. I kept it safe and went with the NY strip in goat cheese sauce. Steak was cooked to my liking, sauce had the Mexican flavors and French influence but not something that would make me have the itch to come back. The presentation of all dishes were exceptional as one would expect from a chef of this caliber. Service was impeccable. The desert we had was the enchiladas in a Mexican chocolate sauce topped with ice cream. Very good altogether. I'm stuck between a three and a four; in the technical categories, Mexique hits it out the park. On the main course selection it needs some additional selections. Nothing on it said order me! Just my take on this place; if someone said to me, ""let's have dinner there to celebrate"", I'd think three times about hitting this place again.",0.8713,0.907,0.063,0.03,0.37594594594594594
2015-02-16,5.0,"This place was great. The service was attentive. It was a Sunday night after Valentines' day, but Chef Carlos Gaytan was in the house, and came to our table to ask how our food was. For the price, the dishes were highly valued and the portion was satisfying, even though it seemed that price had gone up recently. The overall flavor profile was bold, with an emphasis on tangy notes. My partner and I had six dishes, see photos for detail:  0. The bread was served with a chicken liver mousse and a refried black bean sauce. Nice touches. While the chicken liver mousse was a bit too ""livery"" for me, my partner said it was ok for her.  1. Mejillones: It seems that they have updated this dish. They used to serve it in regular bowls, but now they served it in a mini copper pot. I think this presentation added a lot to the dish; however, it also seemed that the price went up. The mussels weren't the biggest but had a refreshing taste with the slightly tangy broth, which had hints pickled fennel and white wine. 2. Tartara de Carne: Again, the flavor is bold. The guacamole and the beef tartar gave a refreshingly acidic taste, which led me to hope for the entree. 3. Asada: It was a NY strip with a goat cheese sauce. The meat was nicely cooked to a mid-rare per our request. 4. Pato al tamarndo: Seared duck breast and duck leg confit. The portion of duck breast seemed to be smaller than before; however, the breast was cooked to a nice medium, juicy, and tender.  The dish was served on a piece of warm marble stone. The sourness from the sauce balanced well with the rich duck breast and leg. 5. Enchiladas: crepes filled with chocolate ganache. I really liked that the chocolate wasn't too sweet. In addition, this desert is nicely portioned such that you won't fill too stuffed.  6. Guacamole: this was probably my favorite dish of the night. It's a sweet version of gua and chips. The avocado pastry cream had an obvious but not overpowering avocado taste, while the fried tortilla chips reminds me those cinnamon pita chips.",0.9933,0.83,0.142,0.027,0.6677502067824648
2015-02-16,3.0,"So I've waited a couple of months to write my review for Mexique - I dined here in November 2014, for my birthday - and now I can say with full 20/20 hindsight that I'm not *totally* surprised that Mexique lost its Michelin star. Ambiance is quite nice and we arrived right on time for our reservation and were seated promptly. Service throughout the night was perfectly fine; our server was accessible when we wanted to order food or had questions, but didn't hover. We started out with the rabbit rillettes and the tinga de pollo, both of which I really enjoyed. Our server was also generous with the crostini (since we ran out of those long before we actually finished the rillettes), which I definitely appreciated - I hate when restaurants are stingy about bread/crackers. Both dishes were cooked well, tender, and bursting with flavor - and the portion size was reasonable for the price, which, you know, is always nice for the whole ""not needing to eat a second dinner after leaving the first"" thing. For the entree, my boyfriend had the pato al tamarindo (a seared duck breast and duck leg confit) and I ordered a dish that I can't remember the name of (nor is it on the menu available online), but it was a kind of short rib stew with various vegetables. While it was very filling and hearty (and the perfect foil to the typical-Chicago weather going on outdoors), the flavor was just a bit lacking for me. I don't know what it was, but it just tasted a bit one-dimensional. The short rib was nice and tender and the veggies were cooked nicely, but it didn't have a wow factor for me. I tasted a bit of the duck breast as well, which was seared nicely and had great texture, but again, the flavor just wasn't doing it for me. For dessert, we had the ""enchiladas"" and a panna cotta dish that is also not listed on their online menu (note to readers: be aware that what's on their online menu may or may not be available at the restaurant), both of which were great - the enchiladas are basically chocolate filled crepes and served with delicious ice cream, and the panna cotta was perfect in flavor. Neither was too sweet, which is a common issue I have with desserts. Overall, a solid experience, but just not on par with what I've had at other Michelin-starred places, and not very consistent.",0.9965,0.799,0.168,0.034,0.5740338827838828

This was my third time visiting Mexique and I can honestly say it has gotten better each and every time.

The most recent time that I visited Mexique was this past Saturday night. We had a reservation for 4 at 8pm, we only had to wait a short 10 mins before our table was ready. We did not hold back. We ordered the steak tartare & ceviche... the steak tartare is the best. ANYWHERE. And I love me some raw meat. The way Carlos mixes the mexican flair into this dish is outstanding. Love Love Love. Cannot come here without ordering - even if you don't eat red meat, this is a great dish to reintroduce it! Ceviche was also good, a bit small in portion but tastey. Everyone at our table loved it.  Main course: SKATE WING. LOOK NO FURTHER. The sauce is BANANAS - not actually bananas bc that would be weird. But fantastic. And it's a huge portion for those of you worried about fish not filling you up.  Others at our table ordered the duck, veal & carne asada. Everyone walked out happy.  I cannot wait to go back.

The night started with some cold Modelo and bread with a chicken liver pate and a warm black bean pate. Both were great. Our favorite was the beef tartare on top of guacamole topped with egg and truffle oil. YUM! We scraped up that plate with the crisp crostini that it came with. I would go back just for this dish. My next favorite bite was the fried shrimp sope that was on the trio of sopes. The other two sopes were really good too, though were definitely beat by the ceviche. The ceviche was the night we went was hamachi, cucumber, purple potato foam and jicama. It was cool, light, and refreshing. The fish was fresh and a really great dish.

Upon entering Mexique, you immediately notice the bland style and decor. The entire restaurant has canvases wrapped in warm colored fabrics hung on the walls, which screams boring. This restaurant is competing against other funky places in the neighborhood and needs to step its game up. With that said, I highly recommend getting some unique art work to appear more like other fine dining places.  The beer and wine list is quite limited, so I was a bit disappointed. However, I know other fine dinning restaurants that suffer the same fate. My guest and I ordered the beef tartar and their special ahi tuna ceviche. The beef tartar was INCREDIBLE. Like, ah-maxingly delish. Chef Carlos came around and said hi to us and thanked us for dinning with him. You can tell you has passion for what he does. Back to the appetizers..The special ceviche was just okie. I would have rather ordered a double order of the beef tartar. Perhaps if you were to go, just do appetizers.  Lots of reviews wrote about the asada, and after ordering it I don't understand why...it wasn't anything special. My guest got the duck and it was quite yummy. We followed entrees with the chocolate enchiladas. Again, nothing special. So all the reasons mentioned above, I have to rate this place with three-stars.

2014-12-08,2.0,"Sunday nights are generally a roll of the dice at restaurants and a recent visit to Mexique drove home the point. It had all the earmarks of a kitchen staffed by a disinterested/under-skilled B team.  First courses showed great promise and we gobbled them up with great delight. I don't understand why guests have to ask for spoons when mussels (nicely prepared when we were there with Spanish chorizo, saffron and lots of luscious cream) are served with liquid. Is it assumed that all the sauce that remains will be left behind and wasted? In fact, it doesn't entirely make sense that tables are preset with knives and forks; poor little spoons are totally snubbed.  The server touted the pork in mole sauce and I actually fell for his raves. The plate was an object lesson in amateurism.  The Brussels sprouts essentially were raw, the sweet potato pancakes cold and soggy, the pork cheeks stringy and the whole plate oversauced with tepid mole that tasted mainly of cinnamon.  Dessert: we ordered the chocolate enchilada. I wouldn't have commented one way or another about it until I saw photos of it that are posted on Yelp. Let's just say that what arrived at our table didn't look like anyone else's.  If someone suggested going to Mexique again, I wouldn't grind my feet into the ground and refuse to go but I would stick to the first course side of the menu and make a meal of smalls.

2014-07-13,4.0,"Hi, Yelp. It's been awhile.  I came here on a Friday night for some girl-on-girl time. My lady and I decided to go with the 6-course tasting menu. I did my research before heading to Mexique, and I never noticed any mention of a tasting menu. So, it exists. It is noteworthy and pretty affordable at $75. Try it!  Service was lackluster-- informal but not warm. At one point my friend said, ""I can't hear anything our waiter is saying about the food and it's making me really angry."" Portions were just right for my medium to large appetite.  The tasting menu started off with a creamy, spicy, and complex soup. Not sure what was in it. The waiter whispered something about fennel and pepitas and then ran off. Ceviche was next, and it was super fresh. Served with a creamy aioli and the cutest baby carrot. It had some unusual ceviche ingredients in it, like olives. Scallop was next, and it was amazing-- my favorite course. The perfect amount of caramelization played up the natural sweetness. Our waiter presented the course as ""scallop and potatoes,"" which I thought was funny because it was served with one Rolo-sized piece of potato. It was great, but let's not try to pull that off as plural. Next up was veal short rib in a peanut sauce. I started to roll my eyes at yet another peanut sauce att.... then I ate it. This was a really clever combination of flavors. The final savory course was seared duck breast. Unfortunately, I just couldn't bring myself to eat most of it. The outside sear was so expertly seasoned and delicious, but the rest of the meat was rare. I like my steaks medium rare and have eaten medium rare pork, but this was the rarest piece of poultry I've ever been served and it freaked me out. I regret not making myself get over it. Dessert course consisted of flan, vanilla ice cream, and roti. I don't care about dessert unless chocolate is involved, and none of the desserts were anything to write home about. We ordered some coffee as well because we were feeling pleasantly fat and sleepy.  I was pretty surprised to not just see Chef Carlos, but also watch him play an obviously active role. He checked plates before they went to the table, dipped in and out of the kitchen, and even came over to our table to ask if we were enjoying our dinner.",0.9978,0.771,0.197,0.032,0.6791383219954649

2014-05-16,4.0,"I'm struggling between 3 and 4 stars but I'll round up cause I really like this place and the service was stellar.  The ambiance of this small place is very nice.  The modern bar to the left with a row of tables to the right and a glass section separating the kitchen, just enough for a glimpse in.  The bathrooms are adjacent and very comfortable and modern as well.  Overall, the decor was perfect.  I felt very welcomed.  We grabbed a drink at the bar: three glasses of the Alsatian bubbles.  They were extremely generous pours.  The bartender, who doubled as our server, was very attentive and knew the brand new menu very well.  I loved the wine list was fairly minimal but had some decent bargains.  Flowers Pinot at about 100% markup?  Sign me up!  We prefer to get a bunch of things and share them, so we went with 1 small plate and 4 large.  It was a lot of food but we just could not make up our minds.  It was my husband's birthday and they did bring him some ice cream dessert on the house.  The ice cream was actually very good. I did have high expectations and some of the food was amazing but much of it was just average for a Michelin Star spot.  Nothing was bad and I do have to say the plating was outstanding.  We started with the beef tartare, as most meals usually do.  The poached egg was made with truffle oil, which gave it a unique taste that we thought was interesting but not sure if we loved it or not.  There were some jalapenos in the guacamole that was served with it, which we all thought paired with the truffle flavor.  The guac by itself was actually very good and I liked the idea of the poached egg but there was just a lot going on in the dish.  Next was the skate, which was the most disappointing dish.  That being said, no one seems to be able to do skate properly other than Blackbird (myself included, what a disaster!).  I really was looking for that light, crispy outside with the moist, succulent flesh and we got soggy outside with a bit dry inside.  However the habenero sauce that accompanied was out of this world and I used it to dip other things into it.  So it was not a total loss.  We also got a pork belly/shrimp dish.  There were only two shrimp so I refrained but my co-diners said they were a bit on the dry side.  The pork belly was good, but it's pork belly.  So that really shouldn't even be a statement.  But the mole that came with it I was told when I asked had 32 ingredients and it was one of the best moles I've ever had so kudos to that.  The last two dishes that we accompanied with a Carmenere that was very good and unfortunately not available at Binnys, were the lamb and the duck.  The duck, in my opinion, was the best dish of the evening.  The confit was done so well that it was the best, crispiest duck skin I have ever had.  To be honest, I don't even remember what it was served with cause I was too busy having a duckgasm.  The lamb was the other favorite, which was a coffee dusted preparation.  That isn't very original but it sure is very tasty!  It came with a roasted garlic salsa which did actually showcase the garlic quite well. All three garlic lovers endorsed it.   If every dish was the quality of the duck, this would be an easy 5 star.  The ambiance is great and the plating is awesome, but not all the food lived up to the hype for me.  With big, bold Mexican flavors, I was looking for a little more originality and something to knock my socks off (like the duck skin...still dreaming about that by the way).  This place has potential to become one of my go-to spots but the food was not quite there yet.  I will definitely be back though and hope to get blown away next time.  Between the mole and the duck, I can tell this chef is the real deal so looking forward to what else he can come up with.",0.9993,0.78,0.189,0.031,0.5209576118326118

Honestly, every small plate was so uniquely tasty that we all raved about every single bite.  My entree was the braised pork belly and smoked sea scallops with mole, celery purée & hibiscus glaze. Wow is all I can say! Everything complemented each other and was so expertly prepared it is one of the most perfect dishes it's ever been my pleasure to eat.

They came out w/ one of the desserts we ordered that had a candle in it and 'Felicidades', which was a really nice touch. Also nice that some of the bottles of wine are really affordable--tried a nice white for $34.  Too, tried on of the sparkling wines along with various beers. They came out with thinly sliced bread and butter to start, and I had the ceviche (you should ask them to explain it, as it's not what you think of as a typical ceviche), and the pescamal. Between the two, I'd recommend the pescamal. Others in the group ordered the soup (asparagus at the time--good--not too thick/creamy), and the tinge de pollo. For entrees, two people got the asada, someone got the pork, and another got one of the fish entrees. All were hearty portions, so one entree is definitely enough per person. The server (who was great) said that the number of small plates as an entree really depends on which ones you go with/how hungry you are, etc. Also, because it was a special occasion and most of us are huge fans of Chef Carlos (on the New Orleans Top Chef) we asked the server if he wouldn't mind stopping by the table (we had a really early reservation, so he could take a bit of time away). He was so gracious and warm, and spent several minutes chatting with us. It really made the experience memorable, and we will definitely be back for the excellent service and great food.

2014-04-22,2.0,"I'm conflicted in this interview. Carlos Gaytan definitely has skills. However, this French and Mexican fusion experience did not work for us. For me this was heavily French cuisine with a wisp and I do mean wisp of Mexican fusion. Servers were polite and knowledgeable. What i didn't like was how the servers would describe the dish by bend directly over my dish as if talking to it.  It was very uncomfortable having the waiter talking with his mouth so close to my food.   Starting with the seafood ""Corn"" tamal. Small pieces of shell fish enveloped in a very, very salty mousse arrangement was too seasoned for us and I like my food well seasoned. The Tinga de Pollo was tasty, shredded chicken in a smoky sauce served on a round tortilla chip. If you inhale deeply you might smell some chipotle but you wont taste it. The Cochinita Rillettes is like a carnitas pâté served with toast points. The pâté was very rich and tasty. The Mango/Habanero Coulis decorated the plate very well but made zero contribution to how the pâté expressed itself on the palate itself. Perhaps I didn't understand how to make it part of the experience.  For my main course I ordered the veal short rib. When I observed my dish being served I said to myself, ahhh, perhaps the raison d'être. The serving was a decent portion and it was steaming hot and fork tender. Unfortunately, the veal was totally overwhelmed by an allspice or similar rub.  For dessert, the apple tart was tasty but the puff pastry was flat, a little rubbery and too firm. I failed to mention in the beginning, I felt this experience might not go well when there was no well composed hand shaken Margaritas or even fine tequilas on the bar menu. Although, there wines were excellent.  In the end, when we left, the place was packed and the buzz was high! Its just not for us. All the best to Chef Gaytan.

The food was REALLY delicious; beautifully presented and tasty to boot.  Some of the dishes reminded us of things we ate as kids (pork shoulder rillettes = microwaveable BBQ pork?) but we were not complaining.  The too-big plates made for some interesting transitions and maneuvers by the waitstaff, but the overall presentation was gorgeous.    - Carlos' famous PESCAMAL was yummy, but just a nice starter.  Sauce was grand.  - Aforementioned COCHINITA RILLETTES was absolutely delicious, needed more bread to sop up the pork shoulder spread.  - We devoured a special ESCOLAR whitefish with polenta, onions and mole sauce - this was my favorite of the night.  - Highly recommend the perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned CORDERO rack of lamb.  - The CRÈME BRÚLÈE was a tad undercooked (too soft, soupy) but it was nice to finish with something small and sweet at the end of the meal.  - Sangria wasn't worth the sugar calories, but all of the wines were delicious. Two things would have made our night a 5-star experience... 1) If our server had spoken up and slowed down.  The ambiance was absolutely ideal for what we wanted on a Friday night.... comfortable lights, seating, sound level, everything perfect, but our waitress was a low and fast talker... she should be running an auction house.  We felt rushed. 2) I really wish we had coursed out the two entrees since we split everything even.  The plates were so large and we ate the fish in it's entirety before moving on to the lamb.  A smart server would have suggested it so our lamb was warm, fresh and a focus.

The ladies shared a pitcher of Jamaica sangria and I had a glass of nonalcoholic Jamaica, it was tasty and had stuff going on in the complexity of flavor.  After putting in the order for appetizers, we learned that night the top six contestants from this season of Top Chef would be coming that night.  They were all in town for a special event at the Union League Club the next night. The seafood tamal dish where crab mousse stands in for corn masa in a earthy, savory dark chile sauce was so good I realized Chef Carlos getting eliminated from Top Chef for this dish was like Rick Bayless losing by one point to Bobby Flay in the first episode of America's Iron Chef: some people still don't get Mexican cuisine. That night's shrimp ceviche with flowers and light purée and the plate got scraped clean.  The beef tartar got me with salty capers, spicy chile, and perfectly seasoned umami.  Juicy chicken tostadas.  We were having that kind of dinner where we kept saying this is the best dish of the night.   Mahi mahi crusted in salty crunch of chicharron, red from guajillo pozole corn in a velvety green chile sauce, perfectly cooked fish in the middle of a story of flavors was my favorite.  The pork crusted fish and saturated colors were unexpected and it tasted like it came from his grandmothers kitchen.  The women however unanimously decided the intense mole duo of scallops and pork belly was the best. Dessert of creme brûlée, chocolate crepes and Julius Meinl coffee was a great ending. I used to work with Chef Carlos at the Union League Club, my first restaurant job.  Back in the day, he would carve ice sculptures and I was part of the team of stewards who would move them from the freezer to the banquet halls.  Before the Top Chef contestants arrived in a super long white limo, I got to shake hands with Chef Michael Garbin, the executive chef at the Union League Club, while he waited for the chefs at the bar.

I started out with a glass of sangria (bright, light, good), and we ordered the pescamal appetizer to share (corn tamal, seafood mousse, crab fricassee, spiced bouillabaisse broth, lemon confit).  It was a complex mix of creamy seafood mousse with the spicy broth - great flavor.  I ordered the fish special - I wish I remembered the name of the fish (I've never had it before), but whatever the kind, it was delicious; served with a generous side of spiced polenta, pickled radish slices, and a great sauce under the fish.  Again, terrific mix of spices and flavors.  For dessert we split the chocolate enchiladas.  This was no choco taco, my friends, (and I do enjoy choco tacos...) this was two crepes filled with choco ganache, toasted walnuts, ancho chile-chocolate fondue, served with crème anglaise vanilla bean ice cream.  Hot, crispy, chocolatey, gooey and delicious - just what a dessert should be.   The food was amazing, but what really kicked this meal up to the next level was meeting Carlos!  (Yes, I am a brazen Top Chef fan)  I first spotted him in the kitchen, donning a black apron/jacket, with his head down working away at something totally delicious, I'm sure - maybe our appetizer, who knows.  His black jacket matched his long, sleeked back hair.   Towards the end of our entrees, I noticed a ruckus at the front of the restaurant and realized it was a group chatting up Carlos as he was walking by.  He started heading towards the back of the restaurant again smiling at and chatting with people as he passed, and I set my eagle eye stare on him - he noticed me staring (it worked!) and he came over to our table, we exchanged pleasantries about seeing him, the quality of the food, etc.  He said that if we needed anything, to please let him know.  He was very warm and friendly, and we appreciated that he made the effort to personally thank people for coming into the restaurant.",0.9984,0.781,0.204,0.015,0.5632685881370092

2014-01-27,3.0,"Mexique is a nice enough restaurant that--perhaps unfairly--suffers the burden of being rated relative to a Michelin star scale. Mexique got designated with the one asterisk, immediately raising my expectations. First, the dining room is attractive and the service is friendly, if slightly slow. Head chef Carlos Gaytan was nice enough to circle the dining room, checking on every table. That's a plus. The plates garner traditional Mexican titles, but the composition definitely has a French influence. Overall, I thought the ""fusion"" portion skewed Mexican. As someone who loves paying for fancy French but can't really stomach Frontera-like prices for Mexican food, that wasn't the scale-swing I was hoping for. Nevertheless, the food was tasty without anything that amazed. The Tinga de Pollo appetizer, one of the dishes highlighted on Yelp, felt like the biggest disappointment. I could have gone to Big Star to get those suckers for the same price at bigger portions. Sure, the creme fraiche was novel, but how unlike sour cream is that really? The Soup du Jour was fine, though forgettable as I can't hardly remember what was in it. On the small plates list, my personal favorite was the beet guacamole in the Betabel, truly an innovative taste and design. I favored the main courses over the apps. The New York strip cut for the asada made the preparation extremely tender, though a small part of me still wished for skirt. Unlike skirt, my leftover portion reheated to perfection the next day. I'm from Missouri on the goat cheese fondue that everyone loves. It tasted fine, but goat isn't my go-to on the cheesy spectrum. Potatoes were delicious. The wife's mahi mahi was also cooked perfectly, and I dug the chicharron crust. The pozole sauce was also tasty, and not overtly sour like I'm accustomed to slurping. Overall, the food is good, the service is fine, and the price points aren't wholly unreasonable. But I can't find anything that wowed me. If Mexique weren't a Michelin-starred restaurant, it's a review I might never have written at all. Not sure if that says something or not.",0.997,0.746,0.213,0.041,0.4732428451178452
2014-01-27,2.0,"I'm sorry. I wish I could get on the love party train Yelp seems to have for Mexique but the brunch I experienced whisked my tickets away. shredded them, really. We walked in with a reservation and got seated just fine. We tried the pozole verde, the tilapia taco, the chorizo crepes and the french toast... none of which were anything to write about. The tacos fell flat for me, as they had some acid but were otherwise relatively one-dimensional, and the pozole was a little bland. The crepes were fine, but the potatoes that accompanied it were cold. Um, if I had wanted poorly timed/plated food, I'd make myself breakfast at home. Really, nothing about the food was astounding or impressive. We were pretty disappointed. Then to add insult to injury, after the last dish was cleared, we got left alone for over 30 minutes. Literally, half an hour. Initially, we just let the first ~15 minutes go by without notice, as they were pretty busy, and we weren't in any rush. Then after another 10 minutes, I started to try to catch the attention of our server. I had seen her standing here and there, eyeing our table from time to time but not actually dropping off the check, so I was really irritated. I used to work in service and I know when you're in the weeds, and she was just standing at the wall at one point.  Finally, I waved my hand and said ""excuse me"", and she was so taken aback...apparently she had forgotten that she was serving our table, and thought someone else was responsible for it. Again, I was sympathetic once she explained her mistake and apologized profusely. It really wasn't a big deal since we weren't in a rush to go anywhere. However, the fact remains that we waited for our check for over half an hour after our meal had come to a close.  So all in all, I'm going to be the lone ranger here in saying this, but the food and service = Meh at Mexique. And I wish I could say differently.

2014-01-25,5.0,"I was asked last minute to join in on a 1pm brunch on a frigid Saturday afternoon, and I briefly hesitated. Thank goodness I didn't back out, because I would've missed out on one of the best brunch experience I've had (in my short time in the brunch scene).  The staff was very accommodating with our last minute change (the night before), and was attentive and great the entire meal.  There were times where I wasn't even able to thank them for refilling my water or coffee, because they ninja'd out of nowhere to fill it. While 3 out of 5 of us got the Restaraunt Week pre-fix, me and my other friend decided to go a different route. The pre-fix was $22 and came with 3 different courses. The entrées ala cart were between $10-$16 and the appetizers ranged from $8-$13. Here's what we got. Mejillones - Mussels with dried chorizo - this was awesome. The white wine/saffron sauce was spectacular,  and it really enchanced rather than covered the mussels sweetness. The portion was pretty sizable, and is definitely a great thing to share as an appetizer.  Waffles - I tried a bite and a half of my friends order. It was waffles topped with a duck carnitas, with a couple of sauces to enchance both the savory and the sweet aspects of the dish. They were definitely good, but I'm glad I didn't get a full order because it would've been too filling as an appetizer.   Cazuela De Puerco - So much for a light brunch. We oo'ed and ahh'd when this plate came out. It looks amazing (tastes great too). There was a huge block of pork belly sitting on top of a throne of black beans, scrambled eggs, potatoes, and other things that were delicious. It was definitely filling, but I finished every last bite.  French Toast - it was more of the traditional version of french toast, with strawberries and a tequila based syrup. It was good, but not something I would order with some many other unique choices on the menu.  Mexique definitely put a great spin on brunch styled food, and has made me a fan. The chef, Carlos Gaytan (who I did not know prior to coming here), was gracious enough to come out and go table by table to inquire about the food and spend a little time chatting with the patrons.

Every savory dish we had was outstanding -- a spiced rillete, a trio of sopes, a chile sunchoke soup, and a skate wing and lamb racks with amazing combinations of sides.  And while it may be true that the avacado pastry cream was nowhere near the restaurant's otherwise high standards, I had developed such an affection for Mexique that I did not care.",0.9685,0.776,0.18,0.044,0.46656250000000005

2014-01-10,4.0,"I had to try this place because I have heard very good reviews about the wine list and the cuisine - plus, it's a Michelin star restaurant!  We came here last Saturday night for drinks and appetizers and here is the run down.    The bartender was very friendly and knowledgeable about the wines :) she helped us pick out a nice glass of white that turned into a bottle.  We ordered mussels per her recommendation, and I have to say that these were the most amazing mussels I have ever had in my life (and I LOVE eating mussels).  The spice, textures, and flavors were perfect.  I have tried mussels with chorizo in them before and honestly, I don't like that flavor profile, therefore,  I was hesitant to try these until the bartender recommended them and oh boy - it's heaven in your mouth.  We had the dessert enchiladas.  My boyfriend loved them, but I was not that much of a fan because I don't like chocolate that much (yes, weird).  However, the ancho-chili chocolate had an excellent flavor profile.  I would like to come back here and try more small plates and have a nice sit-down dinner.  Good experience overall.  Oh, and the chef makes rounds and comes to say hi to everyone at the tables and the bar and to ask what we think about the food.  Pretty cool stuff. :)  We'll be coming back.",0.9911,0.768,0.2,0.033,0.5939094650205761

The good news: The Food. Everything we ate (aside from the generic bread) was incredibly flavorful and presented beautifully. The butternut squash soup was excellent -- some of the best soup we've had in Chicago! The lamb two ways was fantastic. Chili Releno was also great -- and not overly greasy/cheesy as that dish can sometimes be.  Carlos was in the house, and came by to say hello...extremely nice, humble guy.

2014-01-05,1.0,"Went here with a group of friends fro NYE.  We were all pretty excited to try this place, given it's ranking on Yelp and given the Michelin Star this place earned.  Let me start by saying DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!   We had a number of complaints all ranging from the subpar service, cold food, and overall flavorless food.  We had a 7:30 reservation at Mexique on NYE, which we thought would give us more than enough time to get to our after dinner plans to ring in the New Year.  Hardly so.  We were there until just after 11pm, when we had to ask for the check as they gave us dessert to even have a chance to get out by midnight. We had the prix fixe menu, half of the group going with the non-veg and the other half with the veg six course menu.  I had the non-veg, so that is what I will review, although the opinion was not much different from the other side. First up:  Lobster Bisque Soup.  It was served to us COLD.  ICE COLD.  When we complained, the waitress attempted to act as if the soup is supposed to be served cold, but later offered to replace anyone's with a warm one, after half of us just sucked it up and just ate what we were served.  The soup also came with one small whole piece of lobster.  Very disappointing to say the least. Second course:  Octopus Ceviche.  This was also served cold, which would have been acceptable had it not said ""warm octopus"" in the menu described.  Again, when this was brought to the waitress' attention, she said ""It is a ceviche, so it is served cold.""  The octopus was the toughest and chewiest i have ever had the displeasure of putting in my mouth.  There was absolutely no flavor whatsoever to this dish.  Nothing seemed to go together on the plate.  Very underwhelming. Third course:  Betabel.  This dish was palatable, but I suspect only because of the subtle amount of heat in the beet guacamole.  This dish was severely lacking any sort of texture.  Everything on the plate was very soft.  Adding something with a bit of crunch for some texture would have gone a long way. Fourth course:  Chilean Sea Bass.  This dish was good.  The fish was cooked near perfect.  I have had better elsewhere, but this was not far off the mark.  The only objection I had was the amount of avocado mousse and pozole verde broth they poured onto the plate.  It was so much that it completely masked the flavor of the fish on the plate.  If the chef reads this, I hope he learns some restraint on the amount of ""sauce"" they pour onto this plate in the future, regardless of how good the pozole and mousse may have been. Fifth course:  Tampiquena (Filet Mignon).  The piece of meat in front of me was an absolute disgrace.  The presentation appeared it would be very good, with green onions atop the steak and a small enchilada on the side, The steak was cooked to a perfect medium/medium+.  However, about 3-4 bites into my steak, I encountered a chewy piece of FAT!  FAT?!  In a filet.  If I hadn't made up my mind already, it was definitely made up at this point.  I would not be returning to Mexique ever.   Sixth course:  Chocolate.  Oh, but wait.  Our check came.  At 11pm.  I decided to forego digging into the dessert and settle up the bill with my fellow dining mates.  Afterward, I decided to see what this had in store.  To be honest, I will not review the dessert because nothing was going to wash the salty taste of my share of the bill ($170) out of my mouth.  I do not really remember the dessert all that much, but it was nothing to rave about. Come the end of the dinner, two of my compadres decided not to sit by quiet any longer.  He went up to voice the complaints of the the table to the waitress when Chef Carlos Gaytan, purvayor of our disappointing meal, stepped out to hear the complaints.  He apologized for the ill-taste his food left on our palate and offered a $250 gift certificate for a ""future visit"".  And he went onto ask my 2 friends ""Are you going to write a review?"" (those 2 hadn't planned on it, but Chef didn't ask me!)  There was little remorse by the entire staff.  After all, they served up their bill of over $1400 to my party.  And as if that were not enough, they charged on of my friend's $100 more than she should have been charged (but she caught this, brought it to their attention, and they rectified that situation). Save your money.  Do not go and be disappointed.  I have been to MUCH better restaurants in Chicago.  6 days later and I am still trying to figure out how this star has a Michelin Star and such a high yelp rating.   It is safe to say I will NOT be returning to Mexique. One last note to Chef Carlos ( if he does read Yelp reviews ):  It is NEVER acceptable to serve COLD food to patrons.  It is a slap in my face and an embarrassment to you, your team, and your establishment.",0.9904,0.841,0.101,0.059,0.508642506142506

2013-11-24,2.0,"I really really wanted to like this place.  I had it bookmarked on yelp ""to try"" for months already but for one reason or another we hadn't made it out here yet.  Then last week i was watching Top Chef New Orleans and saw that Carlos won the last challenge with his pozole verde.  So i finally made the reservation for brunch for my mom, the boyfriend and I.   What a disappointment! :(   Setting: Sunday afternoon at noon for brunch There were about 20-25 ppl in the entire restaurant.. not crazy busy by any means, but not empty either.   Service: 1 star - We got sat in the back in the corner table (next to a party of 4) so it's not like we were invisible or all by ourselves.  It took our waiter(s) at least 15 minutes to bring us water.  Waiting.. waiting.  15 minutes later and we're still waiting for someone to take our order.  Finally our waiter (or what seemed to be our waiter) took our order.  Another 15 minutes, and we're now sitting with our empty water glasses and we haven't received our drinks.  Now you might think we ordered specialty cocktails or something to warrant the delay... but all we ordered was two glasses of sangria.  My mom was just drinking water.  5 minutes later, (what seemed to be our real waiter), comes and says in Spanish .. ""oh I'm sorry for the delay can I take your order"".  Excuse me.. wait... what?!   Two problems with that... a) How do you not know that someone else already took our order and most importantly b) Since you didn't know that someone already took our order.. you're BARELY coming to take our order???  Are you serious?!  We've been waiting for 40 minutes already?! Ugh!!!  Losing yelp points already....  Food: Overall 2 Mom ordered the Cazuela de Puerco:  Definitely the best out of all the dishes.  Nice balance of flavors and spicy.    BF ordered the Huarache de Asada and Pozole Verde:  Huarache was flavorful.  The masa was tasty and the carne asada was nice and tender (ordered medium rare).  3 stars... not mind blowing but not bad. Pozole Verde:  Disappointment.  First of all, pozole usually comes with limes so you can squeeze onto it, which this did. But when i grabbed the two wedges on the plate, the lime skin was brown and spotted.  I could tell they were old limes.  (I'm Mexican, i ALWAYS have limes in my house)  If i was the owner of this restaurant i would never allow a lime looking like that leave my kitchen!  Then the limes were so old... no juice whatsoever!  But back to the pozole,... this was his winning dish.. I'm expecting it to be amazing... but the result... BLAND!!  It lacked depth and body.  No spice.  Just bland!  womp womp..  No lie, but my grandmas is a 1000x times better!   I got the Chilaquiles Rojos:  Wow... how bland!!!  Absolutely tasteless.  My meat was chewy despite me ordering it medium rare.  The sauce, although visually looked tasty was lacking in flavor and spice.  All this was, was a handful of chips, 2 greasy fried eggs, and tough meat.  All of which was bland bland bland!  :(   Hibiscus Sangria:  Tasty and refreshing.  I would drink a pitcher of this all by myself!  Enough alcohol in it too but not overpowering.  I would definitely recommend.  So the chef passes by and picks up our plates, then notices that my plate was practically full and asked if there was anything wrong with my dish.  Apologetically i said, yes, i found it very bland and lacking in flavor.  She apologized and asked if i wanted to try anything else.  I politely refused.  She asked if we wanted the leftovers to go.. both mom and i said no thanks... the Bf however said he'd take it.  I guess it would be a waste to just throw it away.   A few minutes later, one of the bus boys returned with our packaged leftovers and told us that they were comping us the chilaquiles.  Oh wow, thanks!  (Nice gesture but still doesn't excuse the poor attentiveness from the waiters).  Then a few minutes later, our waiter showed up with a dessert (on the house he said).  Ok, ok, they're trying to make up for the poor service.  Hmm.. i may be persuaded but still, the food wasn't up to par.  The dessert was tasty.   Then our bill comes, to our surprise the chilaquiles WERE NOT comped.  Now i didn't expect them to be comped, nor did i expect a free dessert.  The chef asked why i didn't eat my food and was honest.  Had it not been for the bus boy telling us the chilaquiles were being comped I wouldn't have an issue.. but we were told they'd be comped and now we're still being charged for them!   UGH!   I'm sorry Mexique, i really wanted to like you but you failed on several points.  The waiters and bus boys are so disorganized.  The food lacks depth and flavor.  I've definitely had better.  And for having a Top chef contestant as your head chef, i expected better.  Bottom Line:  Get it together, yo!",0.9857,0.79,0.12,0.09,0.5053204458376871

I have to explain the loss of a star: There was NO bartender at the bar!  We sat at the bar for almost an hour and only received glasses of water.  Not ONE person asked us if we wanted something to drink while we waited.  Several servers (remember, no bartender) walked behind the bar and proceeded to avoid eye contact as we tried to wave them down.  HELLOOOO we'd like a drink please!  Finally a bus boy or bar back or something came over to refill our waters, so we kindly asked him if it would be possible to get a drink.  He assured us he would go get someone right away.  15 minutes later (no exaggeration) he came back saying someone would be over.  By the time the lady came over to serve us some sangria, we were being called for our table.   Now, once we found out they were short a bartender, I pulled back on my frustration.  The only thing is, after we had been sitting at the bar SANS BOOZE for a good 30 minutes, a couple came and sat next to us.  Within 5 minutes they were tasting wines to figure out what they wanted to order.  There is nothing more frustrating than someone waltzing in, sitting down and getting attended to right away after you have been waiting for longer than should be acceptable.  I will continue to hold onto my grudge about this because of that exact situation.  We were waiting to be asked if we wanted a drink for 30+ minutes and they didn't have to wait but 5?  NOT OKAY. Onto the positive portion of my review.  The food.  Oh man, the food.  First of all, the idea behind Mexican cuisine presented in classical French preparations is just genius.  And I have to admit I am a bit of a fan girl because, I'm Top Chef obsessed.  Chef Carlos knows what he's doing and 100% deserves his spot as a contestant on the show.  The season isn't over yet and he's still in the running, so I'm routing for him because of my experience with his food.  He was at the restaurant that night and was hopping back-and-forth between the kitchen and the dining room, greeting guests.  I love when chefs take the opportunity to step away from the kitchen and make the diner's experience a more personal, memorable one.   Dishes ordered: * Mar y Tierra - braised pork belly & salted cod escabeche with plantain puree * Pork - cocoa chile rubbed pork cheeks with pumpkin rissotto drizzled with mole and roasted brussels sprouts * Ternera - honey lavender glazed veal short ribs and sweet potato & apple gratin on a bed of braised red cabbage topped with pickled pistachio pesto I had the Ternera and it was an intensely flavorful dish.  My palate enjoyed the balance of everything and it was all cooked to perfection.  I could have taken a tub of that cabbage home with me, but I digress.  I would give anything to know how to make that pesto because as I was eating it, my mind was racing with all the different things I could use that on!  I tasted the other two dishes and they were fantastic as well.   Don't let my bad bar experience steer you away from this place.  The food is FANTASTIC.  And I just take my alcohol very seriously, especially on a Friday night after being at work all day and commuting home from the office.  Not to mention, I only knocked them down one star for the disappointment at the bar.  The 4 stars is based solely on the food and yes, it is THAT GOOD.  I dare you to try it.",0.9971,0.847,0.128,0.026,0.5229208291708292

In fact, it rivaled Schwa and Volt (Maryland). Carlos has managed to put together some very complex and flavorful dishes. Be prepared to have your taste buds challenged. This is easily some of the best food you can get in Chicago.  The tasting menu is highly recommended. It is not your cookie cutter tasting menu that does not change for months. It changes regularly based on what the chef thinks is going to be good that night.  How this place stays under the radar is beyond me. I'm sure that is all about to change with Carlos on Top Chef a (hopefully) receiving a Michelin Star again this year. Take note that most of the poor reviews for Mexique are for brunch.

2013-10-12,4.0,"Brunch is on, Bitches!  Or Brunch es on, Putas! ... for all my (semi)Spanish speaking friends out there. So, if you haven't guessed already, I came here for their Sunday brunch menu with mi padre. We made a 2:30pm reservation, which is their last seating for brunch before they close for the afternoon at 3pm. If you're going for brunch, I would strongly recommend you go at an earlier time as we arrived to a pretty much empty restaurant at 2:30 and while the staff were welcoming enough, the 'I hope these customers hurry the f*ck up and GTFO so we can close before our dinner re-opening' feeling was hyper present.  I wasn't terribly hungry because I have an out-of-tune eating schedule where I don't like to eat my first meal until after 4pm, but my Dad and I had recently attended an event hosted by Rick Bayless, featuring Mexique's Chef Carlos Gaytan (hubba, hubba), and we'd had tickets to a show in the evening so hitting Mexique's dinner hour was out of the question. They offer a wine, beer, and brunch-y drink list with mimosas and bloody Marys, but I've had some form of whooping cough for roughly the past past 3 months (possible Typhoid Mary right hurrr) and was looking to lay off the booze so I went with a really delicious coffee, as did my Dad.  Despite not being terribly hungry, we had a really hard time deciding between dishes... so we got three different dishes between the two of us and planned to take some home... only that never happened because the two of us ending up basically licking the plates of everything we ordered. Also because the portions weren't as generous as I was expecting. Based on all three of our dishes, I'd say you can expect a pretty light brunch here, which is nice, I guess. Not feeling all heavy and tired for the rest of the day. Just know going in that this won't be a gut-buster. Dishes ranged anywhere from $8-$17, and it should be noted that their online menu doesn't have all their dishes on there, particularly the pricier camarones dish we ordered, which I believe was somewhere in the range of $17 and possibly the best thing I have eaten. Ever. No, really.  Things we ate: CAMARONES - $16.95 - Grilled shrimp, creamy poblano, polenta, the most perfect poached egg ever, and roasted tomatillo salsa.  ** This absolutely phenom camarones dish consists of a mere 4 shrimp, but the pistachio polenta sauce (I think that's what it was) it's served with is worth every cent of that $16 price tag. Trust me. If you come here for brunch, you NEED to get at least one (but probably two) orders of this dish. You won't regret it. Promise. HUARACHE VEGETARIANO - $11.95 - Oval-shaped plantain, roasted nopales, sauteed spinach, candied tomatoes, Serrano pepper, chimichurri, breakfast potatoes. ** I've never been a big fan of nopales until now. Apparently, I've never had cactus cooked well before because this was absolutely my favorite part of this dish. Overall, the dish was good, but could have been warmer and I felt like it was missing a little something... but I think after having that pistachio polenta from the camarones dish that I'll feel like that from here on out, every-time I eat any dish that isn't Mexique's camarones.  CAZUELA DE JAIBE - $12.95 - Crab cakes, corn, potatoes, red peppers, bacon, spinach, Chipotle hollandaise, and scrambled eggs.  ** Again, the dish could have been warmer and we couldn't help but scrape the rest of the camarones sauce (that I can't stop blabbering about) into the dish. It just made everything better. They should just build a restaurant around that -- I guarantee there'd be a line around the block. We definitely plan on going back for the dinner menu and if I'm ever in the area before 2pm again, I will absolutely be back for those fantastico camarones.",0.992,0.822,0.119,0.058,0.5227926587301588

2013-09-16,4.0,"Lately I have been pretty shocked that when I come in to Mexique, with no reservation, I find the house not packed and am able to be seated right away even on a Saturday night. This is, in my opinion, an extremely unique and amazing restaurant that foodie's in the Chicago community must support so it stays open and we do not lose it alla Leopold's (which by the way I liked, but not nearly as much as I do Mexique!) . So hence why I am writing this review: to do my due diligence to get the word out about an awesome restaurant! It is in an odd part of town, I'll give you that, on Chicago right off Ashland. I wouldn't say there's a whole lot to do in that area in particular but it is a stone's throw away from the market district as well as Wicker Park/Damen and North in general. Great service, Great look/feel and overall ambiance. You can have a conversation here but the place is not overly quiet or loud. Just right! Some of my fav dishes here: The steak Tartare appetizer. Seriously. Amazing. We get it every time and sometimes get two (One for each of us)! A must have! Raw meat, egg, guacamole, and light jalapeno served with thin and toasted bread (ask for extra of the bread) - It's just amazaballz.  I really enjoy the Asada and especially the Mar y tierra entrees. For the Mar: pork belly, mole, shrimp and the cauliflower puree to accompany it is a great combination! I literally LOVE the cauliflower puree. So good! Colorful and interesting dish with so many flavors. Things I'll pass on in the future: I've had desserts here I really liked but I wasn't a fan of the chocolate enchiladas. The chocolate isn't great - grainy and not nearly enough chocolate was given. I'm a chocolate WORSHIPER and I was definitely not a fan of this. Final Verdict (For those of you too adhd to read the whole review): Give yourself a little time to eat here. Apps can come out fast but entrees definitely take a little time. Maybe consider an in-between dish or good conversation to keep you busy! TRY THE TARTARE!. Service is usually stellar and food is almost always on point. Ambiance - awesome. Pricey but not overly so especially for the uniqueness and quality. Go here and tell your friends to too!",0.9984,0.755,0.217,0.028,0.5905836151028461

I ordered the hibiscus sangria, and could not manage to drink it due to its saltiness.  The next time our waitress walked by, I asked for a glass of sparking wine.  Considering I still had a full glass of sangria, I felt it was strange she didn't inquire about it, especially when she reached over it to hand me the wine. We ordered the Tinga de pollo, which was really good.  Interesting flavors. For our entrees, we ordered the Mar y tierra and the Pescado special (cobia).  The mar y tierra was so so.  The pork belly was rather tough and chewy, and there was just a dash of mole served next to it, so it was not enough to help.  The shrimp was good, and the cauliflower puree to accompany it was a great combination. The pescado was horrible.  Very overcooked and dry.  I advised my waitress of this, and she asked if I wanted another one.  I did, and then I waited.  By the time my husband had finished his entree, still no pescado for me, I asked my waitress to just cancel it.  She said it was too late.  So I waited more. Finally we just asked for the check and she offered to give the pescado to go.  Our check was wrong, so we had to send that back for correction.   Our waitress did not seem at all to mind that we had obviously had a poor experience throughout it all.  The table next to us had a blonde waitress who really seemed engaged and to care about her customers.  Ours seemed completed disengaged and unapologetic.  I was really hoping this would be like a nearby Topolo, but it was a great disappointment.  We will not return.",0.9893,0.762,0.162,0.075,0.5028314028314028

2013-06-01,4.0,"The food at Mexique is absolutely top notch.  During my recent trip there (I was there once before but years ago) the service was spotty.  To begin, the chef is just beyond talented and his food is phenomenal.  We started with the beet appetizer, which was both delicious and beautifully plated.  We also each had the mar e tierra, which again was delicious.  In particular, the sauces are fantastic.  The beet dish featured a ""beet guacamole"" which was beyond fantastic, and the mar e tierra featured both a dark and a green mole, both of which were complex and absolutely phenomenal, and I as a general rule am not a mole person. Mexique is much more casual than most Michelin star restaurants in town.  You are fine to wear jeans and a half-way decent shirt.  Also although not cheap, it is also a more affordable price point than I think most of the others.  This is great if you want a special and delicious meal but really don't feel like stuffing yourself into fancy clothes or dropping an unreasonable amount of money for a Saturday that isn't a birthday or other reason to justify dropping a lot of extra money on a meal.   Maybe it is the casual nature of the restaurant that made the service seems spotty (and note, not bad at all, but spotty).  When I was there the restaurant was running way behind schedule (looked like there were some huge parties in the back).  The hostesses handled it very well - they were very nice, kept us updated, and seated everyone as quickly as possible.  Once we got seated, however, although service was friendly and generally ok, it took a while for our order to get taken (which has more effect when you are already well behind reservation and hungry), no comped drink or the similar, and our first dish was dropped off without any explanation (which isn't relevant with less intricate food, but some explanation is probably necessary where a dish contains a couple different sauces and something called 'beet guacamole').  Again, not a deal breaker, not anything that will deter me from coming back, just worth a note.  On the whole, this is a great restaurant.  The chef is truly talented and the food is delicious, but the service just doesn't quite reach the same level as the food.",0.9985,0.746,0.231,0.023,0.5800264550264549

Honestly, I had trouble saying my favorite until my husband asked if I could only have one for the rest of my life, the answer became easy - I could LIVE on that Pork Belly Sandwich, no question.  The waiter was super awesome and brought us both some of their amazing french toast (only included with my husband's PF meal). It was really nice and thoughtful. The french toast was so delish that when I said I was just going to have a bite, it turned into two, then one of the halves, and yup finally I was left wondering if it'd be rude to lick my plate - I mean I'm already married, I don't have to worry about impressing my husband anymore....right?

We ordered a pitcher of sangria, which was excellent. Our meal started off with an ahi tuna ceviche, which was good, although I felt like the tuna got a little lost in the mix, overwhelmed by the cilantro and onion. The next course was pork belly with sweet potato puree and mole. Pork belly was great, nice and tender. The mole was super smoky, almost too smoky for my taste. For the third course I tried two of the three offerings, the seared duck breast with corn tamal and swiss chard, and the carne asado with vegetables and goat cheese fondue. Holy crap, the goat cheese fondue was one of the best things I've tasted in a long time. I wanted to eat a whole bowl of it. Both the steak and duck were well executed and super tasty. I couldn't pick a favorite, they were both great. Although the goat cheese fondue might have pushed the steak ahead of the competition. For dessert, we had the chocolate tamal, which was a perfect end to the meal.  Presentation was spot on and service was great.

Waitress was very friendly, but she pretty much ignored us after we ordered our food. She did seem to spend a good deal more time with the other tables.

Whole course was very paced out so I didn't feel like I was starving and just waiting for them to bring me my food. Waiter was always attentive, and we didn't have to flag anyone down.  My mussels didn't seem entirely cooked as in there were about 5 in the dish that didn't open. I had enough of them so I didn't mind but I just wanted to let them know and the waiter was really nice and brought out an extra appetizer for us for free which was the taco's. Now the taco was really good, all the flavors blended in really well.  My picks would be the french toast and the taco, maybe because the chorizo crepes were a bit too heavy for me waking up at 10 o'clock and eating at around 11:30 but overall really good experience!",0.9685,0.849,0.131,0.021,0.4496604938271605

When you can't stop talking about how good the braised cabbage is - you know the meal is off to a fantasic start.   Although the tasting menu is pricey, I highly recommend it, espeecially if it is your first time dining here - it is a memorable dining experience.

2013-01-12,3.0,"I would say that 2.5 stars is an apt assessment of Mexique - but the extra half star because I'd like to think the restaurant is still making the move from a Noble Square starter to a bona fide Michelin-star restaurant. Front of house ambiance was okay, but I feel that the further you move toward the kitchen (we sat at the grouped, long table in the back), the more sloppy the ambiance became. The age of dining-in-the-dark has come to a close. I feel that the rest of us are calling for some textured walls and tasteful art, modern lighting and washroom pieces that are not made en masse by American Standard. Our party tried everything on the dinner menu. All of the Plato Fuertes, except the Skate Wing, as well as most of the appetizers: - The steak tartare + mussels were phenomenal. A testament to Chef Gaytan's French-tinged training. -  Most of the Plato Fuertos had satisfying portions - the Asada, the Cote de Res (with an excellent side of pureed malangas served in a personal LeCreuset), the salmon and the scallops were all done very well. - At times, the plates seem messy and confused. The concept behind the Puerco con Mole was wonderful - roulettes of pork rolled with pesto - but there was neither sear nor garnish; the soggy pork was thrown on top of a sea of mashed sweet potatoes.  - The sopes were not very appetizing - the worst dish of our night. The masa boats were dry and floury. Also, on top of the dough, there was maybe a pinch of toppings. - To end on a good note, the sangria, though, was superb. The bottom line is, we got the feeling that Mexique has yet to make the pressing decision of which road it will take - grow into a true Michelin-worthy restaurant or risk becoming a glorified neighborhood grill.

2013-01-06,4.0,"I had been excited to try out this place for a while, but being vegetarian, thought brunch may be a better option than dinner. Tbh, I would recommend you go for dinner not brunch. On my immediate experience alone, I'd probably rank it 3-3.5 stars but 4 stars on potential.  Let me start with the highlight of the meal - the chocolate enchiladas. And the guacamole dessert. And the french onion soup.  Let me next share why it wasn't spectacular. When we were being seated, I told them the OpenTable reservation but given that they were quite empty at noon on Saturday, they didn't care. Now I did because I had entered notes about celebrating my best friend's birthday, which they otherwise wouldn't know. Okay, no big deal - I let them know anyway.  There were a couple of vegetarian (eggetarian) options - the chilaquiles made without steak and what was called ""vegetarianos sopes"" - we ask our server what is sopes and he says masa boats with pollo or chorizo. I still don't know what masa boats are but given it's the only item on the menu called ""vegetarianos"" I order it. When we get the order, he delivered the plate to me saying here's your chorizo sopes. I say well I ordered vegetarianos and he replies, no you ordered pollo. Ummmm well I clearly did not but even if you think i ordered chicken, you just served me chorizo!?  Now what came next was the most funny part of this whole exchange - they make us a vegetarianos but he comes back and says it has spinach and mushrooms instead of beans. Why? Well our beans have bacon. How can you have an item on the menu called ""vegetarianos"" that lists beans as the main ingredient and tell us the beans are not vegetarian!?  The ambiance, music and decor were nice but the place was dead. I am not planning to return any time soon but doesn't mean I am discouraging you from too.",0.9894,0.805,0.149,0.046,0.5262681159420289

Maybe it was what I had but I didn't place Mexique in the Michelin-star category.  Especially since the category includes Topolo, the incomparable and fabulously crazy Schwa, and the one and only Goosefoot.   We started off the evening with glasses of sangria at the bar; they were good but certainly not the best I've had.  Appetizers included the french onion soup for my husband and Tinga de Pollo (Tostaditas, Chipotle Shredded Chicken, Crème Fraîche and Cilantro) for me which we enjoyed but there wasn't the wow factor.  Main courses included the crepas de vegetales for me and Pollo Envinado for my husband.  I typically opt for a vegetarian main course when available and I did not like my dish.  Dessert was the chocolate enchiladas for me and creme brûlée for my husband.  I was not impressed with the enchiladas.   We had the Jigsaw (Oregon) Pinot Noir for dinner.  It was ok but then again pinot noir is a pretty finicky wine.  Probably need to drop a lot more than the $40/bottle we did for a decent bottle of Pinot. Given the multiple favorable reviews; maybe I need to give Mexique another try.  However, given the long list of Chi Town restaurants I want to try; it probably won't be anytime soon.",0.6762,0.815,0.105,0.08,0.6197722567287784
2012-12-24,5.0,"Well, my wife and I love this restaurant.  We think it's Michelin-nod is very deserving, and while some of the criticism (ie that the menu hasn't changed that much over the last 4 years) may be valid, I also feel like if it ain't broke...  We've had both brunch there and dinner there.  This is a dinner review, although we love the brunch. We first discovered this restaurant in 09 as part of the alacard deck of cards, which I can't recommend enough as an entree (hehehe) into Chicago's indie dining scene. We arrived at 5:30 pm on a Sunday after some Christmas shopping and there was only one other party there... however, by the time we left, the restaurant was nearly half full.   Started with drinks: wife had the sangria, I had a tequila drink which sounds like it was tequila plus Squirt.  Both were quite tasty.   For appetizers, had the French onion soup and the sopes trio.  The French onion soup was EXACTLY what this restaurant is striving for: French-inspired cuisine with a Mexican twist.  It had a very nice zip to it, and was flawless.  The sopes were AMAZING.  One with their mole (which is so so good), one with escargots (surprisingly delicate and yummy) and one with an avocado topping that was divine.   Main courses: I had the lamb, and the wife had the chile relleno.  The relleno was Frenchified with the tomatoey sauce (but which was still spicy) and had a wonderful big piece of cheese.  The lamb was incredible.  WARNING: it was REALLY rare, which is quite good for me, but the wife was a bit put off by how rare it was.  Also came with a barbacoa sope (yum).   Can't recommend this place enough. Also, to the critics who say the menu is unchanging... perhaps this was a response to that, but the waiter noted that two new dishes were on the menu, and one had been eliminated.  So it sounds like they're responding to you!",0.9373,0.878,0.089,0.032,0.5074046920821115

I had the skate wing, and it was cooked perfectly and I enjoyed the roasted baby vegetables as well.  I wasn't as crazy about the sweet sauce (blood orange butter sauce)  that accompanied it.  I found that this cloying sauce overpowered the wonderful protein and was entirely too much for such a delicate dish. We also had the apple tart, and it was quite good as well.  My dining companions had steak and pork belly and enjoyed their dishes quite a bit.  Our waiter was nice, but seemed new and a little confused by some things.

2012-09-28,4.0,"This is another 3.5 star review rounded up. With a deal that offered a Bar Menu with $10 entrees, $5 wine, and $3.50 beer, my sister and I decided to give the restaurant a try. We actually skipped the drinks and aimed for the food.  It can be a challenge for a pescatarian to navigate French and Mexican cuisines, much less a fusion of them.  The food was delicious. The flavor combination was well executed and the presentation was nice. Yet other factors decrease the likelihood of a return. We ordered the following: TILAPIA TACOS BAJA STYLE: ""Four negra Modelo beer batter tacos, chipotle aioli and Mexique slaw""  It featured an ample amount with a nice kick. Surprisingly, it came with a really tasty greens salad. The waiter said that this dish was available in a 3-taco version for lunch.  POLLA A LA PANCHA: ""Pan-roasted boneless chicken breast, Yukon gold potatoes, masa dumplings, zucchini and roasted poblano cream sauce""  My sister really enjoyed this dish. The chicken was tender and the sauce was a great compliment. We walked in at about 6 p.m. on a Wednesday and there were no other diners. The decor is elegant, with a redwood (?) bar and white linen & plates. I think the polished interior kept us from leaving right away. Isn't it always a bit jarring to be the only customers (unintentionally) at a nice restaurant? I kind of lean toward it being a bad sign, but in this case, I'm glad that we stayed. The food arrived fairly quickly and we devoured it gratefully. A couple came in to dine with the same deal around that time, but that was it. The service was fine. The host didn't seem surprised at the lack of diners. We had traveled from Navy Pier on the #66 Chicago bus to the restaurant. The area (i.e. near Chicago & Ashland) that seemed a bit sketchy upon arrival became more so in the dark.  I'll patronize Mexique again if I happen to be around West Town (or southern edge of Noble Square), but ""special trips"" aren't likely.  Also, cost is a consideration particularly near Ashland, which is taco heaven on the cheap. Even so, would I get such a well-balanced, fresh, flavorful, and intriguing meal?

2012-06-17,5.0,"I eat out frequently all over the city, as does my family. Like many Chicagoans with so much great food surrounding us, we're quite demanding.  We had had a delicious meal at Nellcote earlier in the week.  All I can say about Mexique is ""Why didn't I go there sooner?""     We, two hard-to-impress 60 year olds,  one allergic to cow dairy, and my harder-to-impress 30 year old son, went on a Friday night.  Most tables were full by the time we left, but it never seemed crowded.  The menu is fabulous---we could hardly decide what to order, so we all tried several different things.  The first thing the man-about-town-30-year-old said, with unusual admiration, was ""Mom, how did you find this place?""   The ambience is lovely, the staff is incredibly helpful, pleasant , and knowledgeable.  THE SANGRIA IS THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD anywhere in the world!!!!   The cuisine is a sophisticated blend of French and Mexican influences, and nearly every dish is as beautiful as it is delicious.  It works well for a casual dinner or for a celebration.    For starters, we ordered ceviche, cochinitas (not greasy, very tasty pork rilletes), and Trio of Sopes (the plaintains in a tiny pastry shell covered with a divine mole tinged with chocolate (it was just that---divine).  Entrees were: excellent carne asada, seared Skate Wing, which was light, delicious and 2-3 times the size of a usual portion of skate;  Mar y Tierra, which included perfect scallops and pork belly like none other--tender and flavorful, with no fat.  The chef explained that he imports his pork bellies from Europe to get  those characteristics.  The delicate apple tart with homemade ice cream and caramel sauce made with a hint of goat milk, recommended by our gorgeous waiter, was excellent.   Near the end of our meal, the chef came to our table to inquire about our meal.  He was genuinely receptive and appreciative about a couple of suggestions that we made.  Mexique may be our new favorite restaurant--we can't wait to go back!!",0.9986,0.735,0.25,0.015,0.593560606060606
2012-06-14,4.0,"Dinner time! So I'm in a few supper clubs.  Whether this is retro-cool or just a sign I'm getting old is still yet to be determined, but it does lead me to restaurants that have been on my list for dinner for, I'm not even kidding, YEARS.  Much like Mexique. So it's Wednesday night at 7pm at Mexique and we were the ONLY table in the restaurant. Um.  Bueller?  Donde esta todas las personas? I figure there are a few things working against Mexique.   1. It's on a semi-shady strip of Chicago Ave with no other real attractions. 2. While not super expensive, it's above the price-point most of the hipsters want to spend on dinner. 3. No real ambience.  The walls, tablecloths, napkins, plates and pretty much everything else are VERY white.  There's no decor, the music is really soft and quiet.  It's just kind of boring in there.  Especially without any other bodies. If you're cool with eating alone in a restaurant that's eerily quiet, you should consider Mexique.  The food is spot-on.  My friend and I split the Asada , which was cooked a perfect medium and had a great flavor.  It was served alongside a nice portion of asparagus, spinach and potato with a roasted, whole tomato.  It's good to see a restaurant actually serving vegetables as a side instead of just straight up carbs.  I also had a bowl of the poblano pepper/french onion soup.  It was a little heavy on the peppers, but I liked the flavor. If I had one tiny complaint about the food it would be that nothing was really hot.  The soup was just kind of warm, as were our entrees.  Pretty disappointing, especially since we were the only table in the joint. I'm kind of curious to see how long Mexique sticks it out.  I can't imagine it can stay open with only one table coming in per night.",0.9838,0.769,0.155,0.076,0.5804964539007091

2012-05-15,2.0,"Where to start?  Booked a Mother's Day reservation a month in advance.  When I checked the site to see the menu there was no mention that this was buffet only, if I had seen that then never would have booked.  When they called 2 days before to confirm our reservation the message they left was to confirm ""Saturday"" for our table.  I called back and they had the right day but still did not mention buffet either time. We arrived a little early and there was no where to wait for our table.  We were directed to stand to the side near the paltry dessert offerings, brownies, nothing fitting with the cuisine at all.  Several patrons asked if that was all that was being offered for desserts.  The answer unfortunately was yes. We waited for 20 minutes and never were offered a drink or anything. Believe me we would have ordered a drink at that point.   At no time did they acknowledge that the day was special beyond some balloons by the door.   Overall the staff did not seem prepared for a large Mother's Day crowd.  When I asked about ordering off the menu the waitress just looked at me and said they had buffet.  We are not big fans of buffets and while this one was reasonably appetizing the staff was not really keeping it stocked or asking people to follow basic protocol like a new plate each time you walk through. We noticed several other things like a picture frame with pieces of glass missing. Were they in the food?  On the floor or just had been that way for a long time?  The final stroke came with the bill.  While waiting I had checked their website (it was updated 2 days after I booked the reservation) and the pricing and menu were there.  It stated that ""kids"" were only $10.  When we received the bill, it showed $29 for our daughter.  When I asked I was told kids needed to be under 6.  I stated on that site it said under 6 was free but ""kids"" were $10.  They ""agreed"" to give us that rate.   All in all, the food was decent but the experience left a LOT to be desired.",0.8458,0.903,0.056,0.04,0.40766394099727427
2012-05-13,2.0,"I went to Mexique a few of years ago when it had just opened and was quite impressed.  Last night was our second visit and the experience helped me pretty much shut the door on the place.  I won't be going back and I'm kinda sad about it because it really seemed like a special place. The primary reason was the service was totally rookie.  Here are some highlights that rubbed me the wrong way. 1.  My wife asked for a tonic and lime and the server told us they don't serve cocktails.  Since when is tonic water a cocktail?  My wife opted for a sprite. 2.  When the sprite came to the table, the server rather unceremoniously placed a glass with ice in front of my wife, then loudly cracked open a can of sprite and poured half of it in her glass before placing it on the table in front of my plate. At this point, I knew it was going to be downhill from there.  I mean, who does that?  It's a gorgeous restaurant with elegant settings and a decent atmosphere.  You can't afford to pour a sprite in the back and bring it to the table?  Then I have to stare at the can in front of me so I can be reminded that yes, I'm paying $2.50 for a product that cost 40-cents at the Walgreens around the corner. 3.  I ordered wine and our glass came to the table with wine splashed on the outside of the glass. 4.  The server's halitosis was about to knock me over. 5.  The food was just okay.  I ordered the braised chicken barbacoa.  The half or quarter chicken in side the dish (forget how much chicken it actually was) was full of small bones (ribs, spine, etc.).  The thick sauce and veggies covering the dish made it challenging to find them.  I found myself focusing most of the meal on how to best remove bones from my mouth without looking like a philistine.  6.  The menu has a risotto at ""market price""??? (really??) 7.  The server never mentioned a single special.  I had to ask what the risotto was (it was with scallops). 8.  I had to ask what the market price of the risotto... $22!!!  $22 for risotto and you leave a can of sprite on my table?!!! 9.  They were out of three wines on their short wine list and two beers on their beer list. All in all, the experience was pretty weak and disappointing.  I'm leaving a lot out, but you get the idea.",0.9424,0.912,0.066,0.022,0.5246660859465738
2012-05-12,5.0,"This was my third time to this restaurant, and I had to check my reviews because I could have sworn I had already reviewed this place.  First time was during their restaurant week in 2011. I had been here and had the carne asada. I don't remember the appetizer or the dessert, but the carne asada was the best I'd ever had. My aunt and I had gotten the last reservation available for a 7:30 eating time, and the restaurant was packed.  Second time I went, I met a friend here for brunch about a month later. I had the french toast, and it was  great. For a sunday brunch, we got here about 12:15 and the restaurant was about half full. It was enough ambiance to be enjoyable, but not so loud you couldn't talk.  Third time I went here was just a week or two ago. I brought my boyfriend after raving about this place and wanting to celebrate a big finish at work. We also came here because of the relative ease of parking compared to other comparable restaurants closer to the loop.  There were 2 larger parties of 8-10 people in the back of a restaurant, and a smaller couple sitting nearby us. Other than that, this restaurant was empty. I am hard pressed to know why, with the amount of delicious food that is reasonably priced for the quality of ingredients and the chef's skills.  He has the Surf and Turf and I had the 6 course tasting menu. I had a tecate and it was poured into a square glass and topped with a lime wedge. We joked that it was the classiest Tecate I'd ever had.  I can't remember all of the dishes for the tasting menu, but they were all fantastic. I really loved the short ribs and the mole sauce they came in. It was worth the price to get a wide expanse of tastes for Carlos' style.  The scallops in the surf and turf were phenomenal. My boyfriend didn't want to share!  For dessert he grabbed the apple pastry, and I had the dessert enchiladas. The pastry was so good, especially topped by home made ice cream made from scratch. We asked for an additional pastry and sides of ice cream to take home.  This isn't a place I can afford to come to all the time, but when you need a relaxed dinner and truly enjoyable food, don't hesitate to consider Mexique.

2012-05-04,4.0,"Mexique is located on west Chicago Ave. in an area that is filled with a large assortment of restaurants with varying types of cuisine in close proximity to one another.  Mexique's cuisine is a fusion of Mexican and French styles.   Its dining room is functional and pleasantly decorated in a modern motif. Recently, our party of four lunched there all for the first time.  We had reservations for 12 noon and when we arrived, we were the only customers.  After being seated in our choice of tables, our waiter Pedro apologetically informed us that the lunch menus for the day had not been printed and while providing us with brunch menus.  I responded that we came for lunch and were not interested in brunch.  Pedro consulted with owner and head chef Carlos who was on-site and who then quickly came to our table.  He was very personable and explained that a mix-up had occurred with regard to the delivery of raw food ingredients that, in turn, caused a delay in printing the lunch menu.  He said that he would personally ensure that he would rectify the problem and the lunch menus would soon be printed.  I asked that if in the meantime he could tell us what appetizers would be available.  Carlos listed all the appetizers, and on his recommendation we ordered the Sopes De Chorizo (black beans, chorizo, and jalapeno relish on corn masa).  By all accounts they were uniquely flavorful and delicious.  Soon thereafter we were provided the lunch menu for that day.   A short time later Carlos came back to our table to check on our situation.  We asked him for entrée explanations and recommendations, and he provided detailed information about each dish.  Two of us ordered the Huarache (flank steak, goat cheese, and black beans on corn masa) and the other two ordered tacos with a variety of fillings, including tilapia, duck confit, pork and chicken.  In addition, I asked Carlos if we could taste a small portion of the Cochinita Pibil (braised pork shoulder wrapped in banana leaves) as another appetizer.   Subsequently, Pedro set a full order of the Cochinita Pibil on our table that we all thought was delicious.  Next came our entrées.  All were very nicely presented, very fresh, and well prepared.  We all enjoyed the food and ate everything with gusto.  The unique blend of Mexican and French seasonings and ingredients was very flavorful.                At the end of the meal Carlos again joined us and asked about our meal.  We told him that we thought that the food was delicious.  He then told us about his history as a chef as well as the history of the restaurant.  As only a few other customers arrived while we lunched, we asked Carlos about the lack of diners.  He said that nights, especially on the weekends, were his busiest time requiring the cooking services of him and two other chefs.    We all had a great time, but the finishing touch was that when the bill arrived, the appetizers (i.e., Sopes De Chorizo and Cochinita Pibil) were not included.  Thinking that a mistake had been made, we inquired with Pedro who told us that both items were compliments of Carlos.  We then sought out Carlos and thanked him for his service and the complimentary appetizers The ambiance of the restaurant suffered due to the small number of diners during lunch time and the consequential lack of energy that a crowd would bring.  Also of note, only wine and beer is served.  Nevertheless, based on the quality of the food and the close personal attention given to us by Carlos, I highly recommend Mexique with a rating of four and one-half and look forward to returning soon for dinner.",0.9722,0.903,0.071,0.027,0.5049355311355312

The restaurant sits on a mixed strip of stores and a few eatieries in Noble Park but its refined decor makes it stand apart.  The colours in the restaurant are sophisticated but warm.  We had arrived for a late lunch so there were not many customers in the restaurant.  We were greeted by a friendly hostess and our server soon appeared with menus.  I had already perused the menu on-line and had some thoughts of what I wanted to try but had hoped for daily specials too.  Unfortunately,  it appears that only one lunch menu is offered.  No matter - plenty to choose from that sounded intriguing.   The problems started when we tried to order.  Apparently a good number of dishes (particularly, the ones we wanted) were not available today.  Something about a busy weekend and not getting supplies.  This is where a specials menu could have pinch hit for the regular menu.  So they were out of mussels, duck, and chicken (yeah, chicken!).   Since we could order neither the mussels nor the chicken tinga we decided to skip appetizers.  We ordered the pork belly sandwich and a 3-taco dish. I like that you can select different tacos (except for duck). The food was very good.  The apple slaw in the pork sandwich (a bit lean to be truly classified as pork belly) made it sing and the accompanying frites were perfect.   I was also impressed with the variety of topping on the tacos (we tried the braised coffee lamb, the pork al pastor, and the salmon with corn porridge) and the depth of flavour.   We tried the highly touted chocolate enchiladas for dessert but at least one of them was a bit overdone (chocolate had gone past 'melt-y' to dry) and  they were not remarkable.  An added note such as cayenne would have enhanced the dish.  I would have given four stars for the food but the number of missing dishes was unacceptable given the limited menu.",0.983,0.817,0.126,0.057,0.5628032443746729

My wife and I brought our 2.5 year old and met a friend.  The restaurant was virtually empty when we arrived for our 11 am reservation.  Our friend and I ordered off the restaurant week menu, my wife ordered off the regular menu. The restaurant menu consisted of the choice for the first and second course.  Both of us had the Onion Soup with poblano and the steak huarache.  Neither of us felt that the soup was very good.  The addition of the roasted poblano to the onion soup just didn't do it for me.  It sounded great when reading the menu, but not every attempt at culinary fusion is a success. After we had the soup, we began the long wait for our food.  And by long, I'm talking 45 minutes or so.  When we asked the waitress what was the hold up in the kitchen, she gave a curt, ""it'll be about another 10 minutes,"" and walked away.  We didn't time it, but it was well beyond the 10 minutes the server told us.   Keep in mind that we have a 2.5 year old.  The restaurant was relatively empty when we ordered, but somehow everyone else had their food, but ours would be another 10 minutes.  I guess they had to hand pick every leaf of spinach for our dishes. My wife ordered the crab cake skillet and it came with choice of eggs.  My wife ordered them poached.  One of the yolks was cooked through, solid. I and our friend had the huarache.  The meat was cooked well, but there was very little flavor and I was very disappointed that after waiting this long for the food, that it was nothing to write home about.  No one, not a manager or ever our server came to our table to ask us if the food was okay. Between the food being late, the server having a laissez-faire approach to the food being late, and then for the eggs to be over cooked, and the flavorless cuisine, we were beyond disappointed and will never go back.",0.8851,0.872,0.079,0.048,0.4586102564102565

The décor and layout of this place definitely reinforced that less is more. Service Our waitress was fantastic. Even though we were ordering off the Restaurant Week prix fixe menu, she took the time to explain the other specials of the day in case we were interested in going off the menu. She was very knowledgeable when it came to explaining the craft beers available to my husband and she checked up on us regularly and seemingly always at the right time. The timing of our meals was perfect.  I love that the kitchen is exposed with glass - I like to see how and who is making my food. Bonus! Drinks Mexique does not offer hard liquor, only beer and wine. I was initially a little let down since I'm not a big drinker of either and was looking forward to a cocktail. However, I was pleasantly surprised to learn they have red sangria and it is fantastic. Yes, it's $8 a glass, but it is a huge glass and is sneakily strong with lots of fruit and even some mint leaves. It's a bit on the sweet side (which I happen to prefer) so beware if you are looking for something not as sweet. Food To start things off, I ordered the Tinga de Pollo - delicious tostaditas topped with juicy shredded chicken, crème and cilantro. A super tasty appetizer and the chipotle flavoring on the chicken was exceptional. I liked that there was actual spice on the chicken as it can be so bland and mild at other places. I think I could have eaten 10 of these. Next up was the main entrée, the Puerco con Mole. Two decent-sized portions of roasted pork tenderloin were arranged beautifully atop a spicy sweet potato puree, ratatouille, dark mole, and a sprinkling of roasted cocoa nibs. Words cannot begin to describe this meal! The pork was juicy - without being left rare. The spicy mole and sweet potato came together to create a unique and great flavor. So far, I was 2-for-2 in cleaning off my plate entirely. To finish things off, I opted for the Chocolate Enchilada which was chocolate perfection - crepe filled with chocolate ganache served with a rich vanilla bean ice cream.  I was 3-for-3 on the night, a rare site since I'm a pretty picky eater. Overall Great ambiance, super friendly staff, and most importantly wonderful food. I cannot wait to go back here - especially since it's pretty easy to get to from work. They are extending their prix fixe menu until March 6 - so make your reservation now, you won't be disappointed!",0.9991,0.741,0.253,0.007,0.6291272574854663

Decor: I liked the feel of the place, slightly classy. Tables were a little close to each other, but not uncomfortable.  Starters:  French Onion Soup: pretty tasty, almost like any other FO soup, no complaints.  Tinga de Pollo: Basically two tortilla chips with shredded chicken on them. Tasted ok. Entrees: Chile Relleno: only tried one bite from my gf's dish, but she enjoyed it. Skirt Steak: Looked great, though even though it was cooked properly, still seemed pretty tough. Had to really attack it with the knife. The scalloped potatoes it came with were undercooked, pretty unappetizing. Only like two small diced pieces of asparagus (though listed as major ingredient). The broiled tomato that came with it was a nice compliment to provided some acidity to the steak. Dessert: Chocolate enchilda: only tried a bite from my gf, but she enjoyed it.  Presentation was excellent. Apple pastry: Presentation was pleasing. Tasted as expected, like a piece of apple pie. Not complaining, that's exactly what I wanted with it. And the vanilla ice cream on top of it was a great addition. A nice ending to the meal.  Overall, a good place. Don't think I'd go back, even if it was for RW again. Try it out. Could be a sketchy area, take a cab.",0.9966,0.692,0.259,0.049,0.6328571428571428

The space is stark and modern but it did not feel cold. The service was excellent. Our waiter made suggestions, answered questions and we did not at any time feel rushed. The pacing of the meal was excellent.  The Tinga De Pollo tostadita appetizers were perfect bites full of flavor, if not a little bit messy (do not wait too long to eat them over conversation--the tostaditas get soggy from the chipotle seasoning) For entrees we tried the braised veal short ribs with ginger carrot puree and the braised pork belly, seared scallops, braised red cabbage, with winter squash mole. The short ribs were cooked just right, so moist no knives necessary. And the ginger carrot puree was like the most flavorful mashed potatoes you've ever tried in your life.  Each entree was a perfect ""comfort food"" choice on such a cold day. And if you're up for dessert, don't even THINK of trying anything else other than the Enchiladas. Crepes filled with chocolate ganache and a vanilla bean ice cream I can't describe as anything other than ""awesome."" One order is definitely enough to share.

First of all, we were seated right away upon arriving and were able to get in and out of the place in under an hour.  And frankly, after spending over 2 hours at 2 Sparrows waiting for a table, waiting for my food, and eating (maybe the 2 is indicative of the the amount of time you should expect to spend there?) and waiting exorbitantly to eat at places like Toast - this was a pretty refreshing change. Our waiter was very pleasant and immediately got us started on our drinks.  I decided to go with the egg and chorizo crepe and my husband went with the pork belly skillet.  It took about 10 minutes for them to bring our food (in the meantime, they made sure our coffee cups were filled and brought out some bread to munch on).  From there, I was in a blissful haze.  The food was downright fantastic!  I've gotten eggs, omelettes, scrambles, etc., with chorizo before and admittedly, while it is usually a good combination, it is also usually pretty greasy (and I feel like a bloated lard ass after eating it).  However, my chorizo stuffed crepe was different.  I literally did not see any grease in my crepe or on my plate.  The crepe was super light and fluffy and the egg/chorizo mixture was also light and had an almost delicate taste to it.  How did they do that?!   But the real show-stopper was my husband's skillet.  It was heaven in a skillet - layers of black beans, perfectly cooked braised pork belly, potatoes, peppers, a fried hunk of asadero cheese, and eggs which my husband ordered over medium.  The combination of these flavors was straight up amaze-balls!  And while I am not going to sit here and try to convince you that the dish was light and fluffy like my crepe, they did manage to make this homey, stick-to-your-ribs dish taste incredibly fresh and clean.   As you can tell, I was super-impressed with this place.  I have about 6 other things that I want to try on their brunch menu (including the crab cake skillet) and their dinner menu looks pretty stellar as well.  I'll be back for sure.",0.9962,0.819,0.163,0.018,0.6647790647790647
2011-12-04,3.0,"We were fascinated by the idea of a Mexican and French fusion restaurant and had walked by earlier in the afternoon while shopping in the West Loop. We had an hour to kill before dinner with friends and peeked inside to see that they had a small bar.  A perfect way to pass the time and check out what the diners were enjoying. The restaurant decor is surprisingly stark and neutral.  Probably to showcase the vibrant colors in the dishes.  The restaurant has an open kitchen design and it was fun to watch the chefs plating. Our server was delightful.  Knowledgable, friendly and not pushy.  She walked us through the beverage options... No spirits here.  A decent wine list, a small beer list and sangria were our options.  We ordered a pitcher of red sangria which was delicious.  Cubed bits of apples, pears and other fruits swirled with red wine and fruit juices over ice.  Wonderful and went down fast! After looking at a few of the dishes hitting the tables around us, we decided to look at the menu.  There were so many dishes that sounded intriguing that we decided to order a few appetizers.  We had an hour before dinner, afterall:) We ordered the tartara de carne and the pescamal and to our surprise, chef also sent out the mejillones after finding out that we were first time diners. The tartara was a layer of beef tartar, topped with caper guacamole, truffle poached eggs, served with a side of crostini.  The dish sounded amazing but was too rich and needed more acidity to round out the flavor.  I like the subtle flavor that the truffles brought to the dish, but was mildly disappointed in general The pescamel was a banana leaf tamale filled with seafood mousse that was stuffed with a crab fricassee and garnished with lemon confit in a salsa Vera Cruz.  Again, it sounded sublime, but was not fully executed, with the flavor distinction lacking.  The tamale became mushy quickly in the salsa broth. We were lucky that Chef sent us out the third dish, because this dish hit all the marks and had we not tried it, I may not have ever gone back to Mexique.  Not because anything was bad, but because there are so many great restaurants in Chicago.  The mussels were cooked in a white wine, chorizo and tomato saffron buerre blanc sauce.  I had originally passed on them because I have had so many preparations of mussels and usually for me, simple is better.  These were surprisingly complex with the spicy chorizo competing with the delicate buttery sauce spiked subtley with saffron.  Delicious. I was excited to hear that the chef had some traditional, regional Mexican dinners coming up featuring the Yucatan, Jalisca and Oaxaca which we may come back for.

I want to start by saying the wait staff and everyone was friendly. The presentation of the food was also nice. As all of you know, I don't rate restaurants based on service or decor, but rather just food!  Walking in I thought it was a Mexican restaurant with French influences. Once I looked at the menu it came across more as your typical higher end American restaurant (sorta like restaurant Blue 13). When we sat down we asked what the specials were. We were told the special tonight was a risotto with mozzarella and prosciutto. Correct me if I'm wrong, but that doesn't sound very Hispanic or French? We were in the mood for Mexican so I just wanted anything that remotely resembled that type of cuisine. I finally found on the menu for an app the TINGA DE POLLO, which is basically shredded chicken on a tostada. It was alright, but nothing I couldn't find at fast Mexican joint. For an entree I ordered the MAR Y TIERRA which basically was short rib and a few scallops. I scoured the menu for something more authentic, but I couldn't find a thing. There was a Chile relleno on the menu, but at least for me it didn't sound very appetizing with things like Spaghetti Squash in it. My GF ordered the special as she just couldn't find anything on the menu. Big mistake, she took two bites and couldn't eat any more. Again, I feel bad for blasting Mexique, but my GF said the risotto tasted like cottage cheese. The mozzarella was just thick slices (like what you would find a caprese salad) on the side and the prosciutto raw was just ripped apart and put on top of the risotto.  I was very disappointed, but bc everyone was so nice I didn't have the heart to say anything. If the menu changed and became more Mexican based, I would be happy to try this place again.

Overall I felt as though the concept was a little muddled.  We went there in the mood for some cocktails and were disappointed to find out they only had wine and sangria, which we thought was weird since it is supposed to be Mexican, not Spanish.  It seems like more could be done with the fusion aspect.",0.9751,0.808,0.139,0.053,0.55679012345679

Since moving within walking distance there's been even less of a reason not get there and try the food. A description of ""modern Mexican cuisine with a French influence"" might scare people into wrongly thinking this is fusion gone wild. It's not. Executive Chef Carlos Gaytan does a very nice job of presenting classic Mexican dishes using modern French technique without pretension in an inviting causal atmosphere. The environment is a typical West Town unassuming storefront with a narrow and long dining area with a kitchen in the rear corner. As for the food, if we had been more ambitious I would have liked to try the six course tasting menu but instead we settled for two starters and two entrees. Even that was a difficult decision because there were plenty of items that looked appealing (more entrees than starters but plenty of both). We chose the daily ceviche special (shrimp) and cochinita rillettes (Achiote/Tequila Braised Pork Shoulder Rillettes, Crostini, Purple Pearl Pickle Onion, Rustic Celery Salad and Mango-Habanero Couli).  It's a really cool dish with the pork served in a small glass jar with the crostini, onion and Habanero on the side. The presentation is definitely French but the flavors are all Mexican. A fun and delicious dish, especially when the spicy Habanero is applied liberally.  We wanted a sea-food starter to compliment the pork and tried the shrimp ceviche. It's definitely a different style of ceviche than what we expected. You basically get four small shrimp with tortillas and slaw (more yellow habanero sauce on the plate). Everything tasted fine but nothing stood out as particularly interesting. It did not remind me of a typical fresh and light ceviche dish.  As for the main dishes we both liked our own selection best, but both were very good. Erica ordered the Asada (for $23, Grilled Flank Steak, Spinach, Asparagus, Roasted Red Peppers, Fingerling Potatoes and Goat Cheese Fondue) and I went with the Skate Wing (for $24, Pan Seared Skate Wing, Cauliflower, Yukon Gold Potatoes, Serrano Peppers, Grapes, Green Tomatillo and Caper Sauce). I only had a taste of the Asada but it was cooked well with plenty of flavor. The sides really added the plate with the goat cheese fondue a highlight for Erica. It was not surprising to hear every other table in restaurant order at least one Asada each.  I'm in a Skate Wing mood this year and Mexique served a great one. I loved the combination of the tender and mild fish with flavorful, textured sides. The diced potatoes and mini blackened cauliflower really hit the spot and provided substance with the delicate fish. As with the starers, I enjoyed using the green sauce to add nice heat to each bite. The mixture of mexican and french is artful and delicious. We really liked our meal even if the shrimp ceviche was not our favorite. The flavors were interesting and demonstrated a high degree of skill and preparation. I was pleased the dominant cuisine was Mexican but showcased in a different style than usual. The presentations and technique were beautiful and clearly reminded the diner about the french fusion angle.  The prices are neither rock bottom nor sky high. Main dishes in the $20s are justifiable in both size and taste. Our service was friendly, helpful and attentive. Mexique is a fun change of pace high quality meal. I like the fusion of great mexican flavors with beautiful french presentations and preparations.",0.9992,0.773,0.212,0.016,0.47805067481538077

It seemed like it was delicious, yet not pretentious.  I was correct on both counts.  Mexique specializes in French-Mexican fusion food and they did an absolutely fantastic job. We were sat in a prompt manner and looked over the menu. They offer wine and beer, fyi. Everyone ordered a round of drinks. After we checked out the food, we started off with:  Trio of Sopes - Three corn cakes with the following toppings: Escargot, shrimp and plantain with mole Cochinita Rillettes - Braised pork with crostini Betabel - Beet salad with fried goat cheese All three were delicious. I very much liked the Trio of Sopes with the shrimp. Out of the park.  For our mains, I ordered the Mexique Salad (with field greens, apples, cranberries, blue cheese, walnuts,  balsamic/chorizo vinaigrette). I didn't order a regular entree because I ate WAY too much custard (Lickity Split FTW) WAY too close to dinner. Anyway. The salad was divine. It had a light vinaigrette and huge chunks of chorizo. The cranberries, walnuts, apples and blue cheese were nice accents. My husband ordered the Barbacoa del Pollo, which was a braised chicken with a ratatouille sauce. Very tasty stuff. It fell off the bone. We were too full for dessert, so we waddled out of Mexique full and happy.

2011-08-02,5.0,"I've made and cancelled at least four reservations to this place over the past few years and could kick myself.  We had an outstanding--albeit small--meal last night and were talking about ""the next time"" even before we had paid the bill.  For an appetizer, we shared the mussels.  I rarely order mussels;  the sauce is so often based on some permutation of white wine/fennel/butter that it's simply not worth the effort of digging them out of the shells to eat them.  These mussels were different--in a beurre blanc (rich enough to be decadent but light enough to soak up with bread) with little chunks of chorizo and spicy green pepper that tempered the creaminess of the sauce.  We tend to get more excited about appetizers than entrees, but here, the entrees sounded a lot more interesting than the appetizers.  After debate, we decided on the duck (based in large part on reviews of the restaurant) and the lamb.  The duck was really good.  The lamb blew me away.  Both the quality of the meat--a tender rack and a rich shoulder--and the flavor of the sauce are something I'm going to remember for a long, long time.  Unfortunately, we were too full for dessert, but next time I'm going to save room for the chocolate enchiladas. This was not a cheap meal by any means, but I feel like we got a really good value.  The ambiance was fine.  We dined on a Monday night in an almost empty restaurant, yet never felt weird.  Our server seemed to genuinely want to help us and always appeared when we needed something yet stayed in the background when we didn't.  It made me sad to drive by Branch 27,a mediocre and very forgettable place, which was almost full.  I hope Chicago diners know that a real restaurant, with a caring and talented chef and staff, is right down the street and that the experience completely justifies the extra ten or twenty dollars you might spend.  We will be back soon.",0.9928,0.82,0.148,0.032,0.47658730158730145

To start, Betabel.  A salad of port wine poached red beets, watercress, fried goat cheese cake, horseradish creamy vinaigrette.  It's a towering salad right out of Alfred Portale.  The fried goat cheese cake was a breaded hockey puck of creamy goodness.  Hmm, if I try to make this at home, I should really get a deep fryer.  The vinaigrette tasted oddly like light ketchup.  Then, the Pescamal.  A tamal of seafood mousse cooked in banana leaves, stuffed with crab fricassee, and bathed in salsa Veracruzana.  The mousse was very delicate.  The Salsa Veracruzana though felt like a spicy marinara sauce, which really overwhelmed the seafood. For mains, Barbacoa de Pollo.  A braised half chicken infused with guajillo and avocado leaf, with rosemary corn masa dumplings, slaw, and veggies.  This dish blew away the quips about the appetizers.  The spicing on the fowl was just right, with tender, fall-off-the-bone meat.  I wasn't sure what the little nuggets were until I bit into the corn dumplings.  Then I smiled and thought... 'Coq au Vin'.  We also had the Puerco con Mole.  A roasted pork tenderloin, poblano polenta cake, zucchini sofrito, and mole Teloloapan.  The meat was a bit dry for my taste.  The mole though more than made up for this shortcoming.  It was rich, intense, and just slightly bitter. The kitchen was showing some whimsies with desserts named Enchiladas, and Guacamole.  I chose the Guacamole.  Avocado whipped with pastry cream, chopped strawberries, and crispy sugared tortilla.  What a delight.  Having spent my formative years in the Philippines, I'm not a stranger to using avocado in sweets.  There is a dessert of mashed avocado, milk and sugar that this 'guacamole' reminded me of.  Thank you Mexique for that little bit of nostalgia. Why 3 stars?  On this visit, the appetizers were a little uneven, but the mains were good.  It has a unique place in a city chockfull of Mexican dining options covering all spectrums.  I like that it has all the charms of a nice neighborhood restaurant, despite being a destination place because of its concept.  All I can say is, 'Vive Mexique!'",0.9897,0.827,0.124,0.049,0.49256613756613754

2011-07-10,5.0,"I have had the pleasure of dining at Mexique on a couple of occasions now and thoroughly enjoyed both experiences. The food is so delicious that a meal at Mexique definitely qualifies as an event. My first meal was so good in fact, that I ordered the same exact appetizer, main course and dessert my second trip (Trio of Sopes, Asada with Goat Cheese Fondue and Creme Brulee). I also brought my father (who was visiting from Boston) for my return visit and he was equally impressed. He ordered a tasting menu where they brought out several different small courses selected by the chef and my father loved every one of them (and I was able to steal a few bites and can confirm they were amazing).  On both of our trips to Mexique the chef (Carlos) came out to chat with us which was much appreciated. I really enjoy when chefs take the time to come interact with the customers. Mexique also holds fun events such as their Back to our Roots series (featuring four or five course meals geared towards specific regions in Mexico with wine pairings). I am bummed that I will not be able to attend one of these events (they are all on Mondays and I have a standing commitment on Mondays). They also offer a Prix Fixe option for groups. Mexique features a fusion of Mexican and French cuisine and really pulls of this blend beautifully. Every bite of food is enjoyable. Mexique is a little on the pricey side but is a perfect example of ""you get what you pay for."" The food is definitely worthy of the price. Mexique is a perfect choice for a romantic night out, to celebrate a special occasion or to entertain out of town guests.

Modern in decor - minimalist, white table cloth type of affair. Fairly intimate setting. I had the salad to start things off. Can't really remember it. Then I ordered the lamb. It was good. But then I tried my gal pal's duck confit or better known as Pato al Tamarindo...and everything changed. To best explain it, that duck confit blew me away. I felt like I was in total food nirvana. To be fair, there was probably nothing wrong with the salad or the lamb I ordered. It's just that the duck confit rendered anything I had before that irrelevant. It was that good. But after that taste, I knew that's all I would be getting. Phil Vettel was right about this dish. I still haven't forgot about it to this day. Next time, I vow to have a plate of Pato al Tamarindo all to myself. And if it's as good as the first time I remember it...I'll probably have to add a star.",0.9689,0.881,0.119,0.0,0.5273182957393484

I had to ask for the menu myself.  Service will definitely need to be improved if this place intends to position itself as a fine-dining restaurant.   Putting aside the service, the food was pretty good.  But other than the dessert, the food I had seemed like contemporary Mexican rather than Mexican-French fusion.  I just didn't see any interesting French influence.  Fine-dining Mexican is fine by me, but if you're going to capitalize on French-Mexican fusion, I feel you should deliver the concept more assertively.  It seems that the dinner menu has more fusion going on.  I will certainly come back for those dishes to see what made this chef famous.  But until then, this place gets a 3-star in my book.",0.9954,0.817,0.161,0.022,0.4666031746031747

If you are debating between French or Mexican, this definitely your place.  I would recommend this to anybody that likes good food and wants to have a unique dining experience.",0.9987,0.642,0.332,0.026,0.6126262626262627

The hearty beet salad with rosemary goat cheese on a watercress bed featured a luscious horseradish vinaigrette. The chicken tinga can be rustic, but here it's got a subtlety and refinement to cheer about. The pork's mole would go well on ANYTHING. The asada could be prettier in its presentation, but the root vegetable bed and the sauce more than made up for the goofy pile-up of sliced flank steak.

We had the tinga app which had a really good spicy kick to it.  I went with the pork tenderloin which came with sweet potatoes and some veggies.  The mole was really good on top of the pork.  I also tried some of the pork belly from the scallop app and it was delish!!!  For dessert we shared the chocolate enchiladas...the picture makes them look better than they are but the baby in my belly is enjoying desserts so of course I ate it.,0.9852,0.731,0.233,0.036,0.5772727272727273

My husband and I split the sopes appetizer, which was fantastic.  I had the lamb entree, which was a great blend of flavors.  My husband had the asada, which also had great flavors, but came out a little bit more rare than the medium he'd ordered.  Since all the guys in the group ordered the same thing, it's possible his dish got mixed up with one of theirs and it didn't slow him down from finishing the whole thing.  We split the creme brulee dessert, which was a little runny for my taste, but I think creme brulee is a very personal preference. My only complaint is that there was no NA beer option, or really any NA option other than soda.  The rest of the group liked the red sangria, and based on my taste, it was good - not too sticky sweet.

Oh, and we can't even get to the bar because there are so many people waiting at the front of the restaurant? I will say that the bartender approached us at the front and asked if he could get us something.  There also seems to be a problem with their reservation system.

We ordered the tinga de pollo as an appetizer and I had the duck while my girlfriend opted for the asada.  The food came out very quickly and our server was very helpful in making the selections.  I personally thought the french/mexican fusion was pulled off very well.   The tostadas were on the plain side but the chicken tasted wonderful, a great balance of tenderness and spiciness.  My duck was perfectly cooked and very tender.  The sauce was sweet and a perfect complement to both the leg and breast meat.  My girlfriend's steak, which I ate about a third of, was also fantastic.  The sauce with the asada was spicy but not overwhelming and the potatoes were crisp.  For dessert we ordered the chocolate enchiladas, which without request, came out with a candle for my birthday.  Not only were they delicious, but the extra thoughtfulness to add the candle was a great touch and really showed what a classy place this is.  Our server (I wish I could remember his name) was attentive and helpful throughout the night and went out of the way to make sure we had a memorable night.  Chef Gaytan also came out and checked on us during the meal - he was very nice and ensured we enjoyed our meal.

The decor was simplistic with things such as paintings of a square block of solid color, could tell it was designed with the idea of not doing too much.  What was really interesting was the kitchen, which was surrounded by a plastic screen that resembled...bank teller windows! Tables were set a good distance apart from each other and it wasn't so loud that we had to scream over each other. Anyway... Mexique is not BYOB, they only have beer/wine and some homemade Sangria.  The Sangria (red) was some of the better Sangria I've had in Chicago, but a bit expensive at $34 for a carafe. For appetizers, we were interested in the cerviche.  The cerviche here rotates, I think depending on what seafood they have on a given day.  This night it was shrimp - quite uninspiring.  When prompted to see if the kitchen might make something else, we were happy to see the server offer the choice of scallops.  Unfortunately, when it came out, something tasted off and my friends thought maybe the scallops had gone bad.  Other appetizers I tasted were much better.  The pescamal was a very nice pate-like item that was great as a spread and very generous with portion.  The beef tartare was also excellent (huge serving!), though perhaps came with a bit too much avacado.  Both were a bit short on crostini bread though. For my entree, I opted for the skate wing, having never tried sting ray before.  I could tell the fish was fresh, the texture was very interesting, lots of segmentation, but there wasn't a ton of flavor. At the end of my meal, I felt pretty neutral.  Given the size of portions, the price wasn't bad, but it wasn't cheap either when you adjust for this side of town. I liked trying something new (skate), but overall it didn't really feel like I had eaten anything strikingly special.

2010-03-26,4.0,"I had dinner at Mexique last night, this week is Chef Week in Chicago, so they offered a $30 3 course pre fixe menu, which was generous in it's options as we could choose from about 80% of the menu, and not just from one or two selections.  I've previously stated that I'm not a fan of French cuisine, but the idea of French-Mexican fusion intrigued me, and it definitely did not disappoint.  The restaurant has a nice vibe to it, very nice decor, small enough to make it just right for a romantic date. I can't comment on the noise level as we were one of the last diners to be seated that night, so the restaurant was half empty. That was actually beneficial as the service was great and really made the evening more romantic and intimate. Something I'm not sure could be achieved in the middle of prime dinner service hours.  We started off with the Mexique salad and the beef tartar.  Both were great starters, the tartar had a hint of spice from the pickled red jalepenos, and was a great starter, filling but just the right amount.  The salad was good too, bits of chorizo in the vinagrette, and it matched well with the apple and blue cheese.  Both were just the right portions, and nothing was too heavy for an appetizer. For our main course, we had the Asada and the Puerco con Mole.  The asada steak was medium rare with fingerling potatos, and served over a goats cheese sauce.  It was great, the asada was seasoned perfectly and tender.  The sauce was a great compliment to the veggies and I devoured the whole thing. The pork medallions with mole sauce was good too.  The mole was not sweet, and had a distinct cocoa flavor.  The savory mole was contrasted by the sweet spicyness of the sweet potato puree and rataouille.  The contrast of flavors on that dish was an interesting combination, and it definitely worked. Again, the portions were just right and didn't leave us overstuffed.  The great plates so far had definitely made me appreciate the possibilities of French cuisine, and the skill the chef had in creating such balanced dishes. For dessert we had the enchiladas and the apple tart.  Prior to being served dessert, the chef came out and asked us how our meal was.  I appreciate when the chef takes the time out to greet his customers, and I know it's lip service and all, but it definitely shows the care he put in his dishes and his customers. As for the dessert, the enchiladas was a chocolate ganache filled crepe, topped with another ancho-chocolate sauce and served with a scoop of ice cream.   the apple tart was a classic french dish, layered apple slices on puff pastry, caramel and also served with a scoop of ice cream.  Great ending to a great meal. I would give this place 4.5 stars, it was a solid restaurant with great service. Great for a date, special occassions, or a great meal.",0.9993,0.726,0.248,0.026,0.4954072339318241

For an entree, the server sold me on the cordero, noting upon my inquiry that it was her favorite dish.  This was two different lamb preparations on the same plate.  One one side were two modest herb-crusted rack of lamb slices, cooked perfectly and served with a sweet and spicy eggplant (halfway between chopped and pureed...I'm sure there's a term for that).  I think that I tasted mustard on the lamb; in any case, it was the best thing on the plate.  (I am convinced that, regardless of what else is going on positive or negative, this restaurant does meat very, very well.)  The eggplant mixture complemented the rack but in general was too sweet for my taste.  The other side of the dish was a coffee-braised lamb shoulder sope.  This was also very good and had a subtle spicy kick.  Overall I would give the dish an A-. My friend ordered the asada, hopefully not under the influence of my previous rave, because it wasn't as good this time.  It was still very much worth eating, but it didn't live up to my previous experience.  In any case, we both loved our meals and ended with a very standard but enjoyable creme brulee.",0.9984,0.746,0.241,0.013,0.49924829692271566

2009-12-14,3.0,"While my rave review of brunch at Mexique still stands, I was seriously underwhelmed by their dinner service. Honestly, problems started days before we even had our meal - with our reservations. We called on a Tuesday for Saturday reservations and they said the ONLY time they could seat our party of 5 was at 5:00 o'clock. Um. Okay. My mom really wanted her sister to try the place so she took it. The problem? The restaurant was still half empty when we left.  Anyways, we were all very excited to try the food after our great experience and brunch and after reading all of the wonderful reviews on yelp. And don't get me wrong, the food was okay. But, it was just okay.  In general, I found the appetizers to be much more exciting than the entrees. We tried the trio of sopes, the french onion soup, the ceviche, and the chicken tinga. The ceviche and the onion soup were both good, but the chicken came out a bit cold. The trio of sopes was presented beautifully and was delicious. While the appetizers had lots of flavor, I found the entrees to be bland. I had the asada and my steak was flavorless and cold, the pork roast was overpowered by the sweet potato mash, and the tilapia was also bland. I will say, however, my fiance's chicken dish was very flavorful and I would recommend it.  We also had dessert. We tried the creme brulee (good), the apple tart, (yum), and the guac cream. My aunt really loved the guacamole cream, but it tasted too much like straight avocado for my sugar loving taste buds.  Anyways, if you're still with me - mazel.

I promise you will never meet a chef this exceptionally talented and sooo nice. It is now more vegetarian friendly (my mom is & loves the place), unconventional chile relleno with corn porridge/succotash & 3 sauces, OMG amazing. Also the pomme frites are so addictive. The BBQ sauce on the short ribs with tamarind is so exceptional that I could literally bathe in it. And yes the asada with goat cheese fondue and amazingly cooked veggies,( even the tomatoes are taken to another level and the asparagus is never over done),  is addictive and perfect on the palate, the seasonings & textures are so well done, there is no more improvement to be had. But the most amazing dish was the risotto du jour with pumpkin and butternut squash, chorizo is optional so yes vegetarians this is for you too. It was rich, creamy, spicy and ever so decadent, in a word a masterpiece. The risotto was so good it took me back to the good old days of Ambria and yes it was far superior to Spiaggia. As if there isn't more to brag about the desserts: chocolate enchiladas, are homemade crepes with dark rich smooth chocolate and vanilla ice cream, to die for as with the apple tart, perfect gallette phyllo dough type puff pastry both crunchy and savory with carmelized granny smith apples and cajeta(goats milk caramel) ah decadence and the creme brûlée is the best I've had(& boy have I had).

The head chef came out and congradulated us as he place two free desserts in front of us.  As far as the food, you can really see the creative fusion between mexican ingredients and french-style cooking. It was beautiful and delicious!  I had the Tillapia while my fiance had the salmon and both dishes had such complimenting sauces.",0.9757,0.782,0.19,0.028,0.6482653061224489

Seating was prompt and the waitress was very helpful in suggesting drinks and appetizers. I got the Sangria which was a little too sweet for my taste but still pretty good.  We got one order of the Mejillones (Mussels with chorizo) and two orders of the Mejillonestinga de Pollo (Shredded chichen on tostitos). The mussels were delicious but the chicken was just OK.  The main courses were all excellent. I got the flank steak and it was cooked perfectly. The goat cheese sauce it was plated on was delicious as well! I also got to taste the tilapia, the salmon and the lamb dishes and they were all amazing. I guess you can't go wrong with anything you order here! All the flavors blended and complemented each other well. For dessert I got the creme brulee which was also great. Service was excellent. Attentive but not smothering!

2009-09-26,4.0,"The more reviews I write on this site the more I begin to ask myself one important question: would I return here?  So often I rate a place highly but don't find myself returning.  Why?  It's one thing if the food was good or if I had a great time, but would I throw away a chance at a new restaurant for a return trip to Mexique?  The honest answer is yes. Mexique serves up authentic Mexican fair with a French twist.  Hell, they can call it what they want but good food is good food and great food is great food.  For me, Mexique falls somewhere in that line between really good and great.  The appetizers were all delicious.  I dabbled here and there in the french onion soup, the ceviche, and the Mejillones (mussels with wine and chorizo) and would order any of those again.  My starter was the Cochinita Rillettes, an achiote/tequila braised pork shoulder with a mango-habanero glaze.  Before the main course even arrived my mouth was on fire, but in a pleasant way.  It was nothing a little beer and wine couldn't handle. My entree consisted of the Costillas, a braised short rib with mini truffle fries and a celery root slaw.  The rib and fries were wonderful together but I didn't care for the orange/tangerine flavor of the slaw.  I felt it overpowered everything else on the plate.  I was able to sample someone's Asada, the dish our family coined ""a trough of meat"" since it's served in a long plate, and found it tasty as well.  I was told it is their #1 seller on the menu.  I closed my dinner with the apple tart.  Apples, caramel, ice cream and puff pastry - superb. Mexique is a cozy eatery in a wonderful area of Chicago.  The chef was friendly, the food was delicious, and the wine and beer added to our great night.  I'm looking forward to my next experience.",0.9985,0.696,0.271,0.033,0.6048441558441559

Being Mexican ourselves, we were pretty excited to see upscale tinga and sopes!  Tinga- While it could have been spicier, it wasn't bad. This was my least favorite of the things we tried but solely because it was on a corn chip.  Trio de sopes- Absolutely amazing. Shrimp provencal, mole w/ platano, and escargot. Seriously, I wanted to order another one of these solely because they were so great. The mole wasn't as spicy as we would have liked it, but it's still good. The flavors just got better and more complex as you tried each one.  Dinner- Asada and Salmon. The asada came with red peppers, asparagus, and a goat cheese fondue that was to die for. We didn't leave a single bit on the plate.  Dessert- chocolate enchiladas and their special for the day. Both were very chocolatey. It reminded me a bit of Abuelita chocolate, but because I'm a fan of not so sweet chocolate, I enjoyed it a lot. The tequila/pseudo rompope shot was delicious.  Perks: the service is great. I'm a fan of waiters that aren't snotty or rude and the one we had was not. He was attentive, he didn't mind at all when the meat wasn't cooked enough (my sister was 9months pregnant at the time), and he even chatted with us about our hometown in Mexico.

Some dining details: I was a bit put off that they only serve wine, beer and sangria.  Supposedly the chef doesn't feel other beverages go with his food?  Okay, but what about The Customer is always right?  The sangria was good, but a bit pricey. We started with the trio of sopes and the cochinita rillettes.  The sopes were great... each one came with a little wine pairing.  That was really fun.  The rillettes were good too... sort of a cochinita pibil turned into a spread.  I wish there had been more pickled onions though.. .there were just two little ones, so most bites were onion-less.  The mango-habanero sauce was really tasty though.  Five stars for the first course (I will forgive the drink thing) Our entrees were very good, but not quite as successful as the apps.  I had the lamb two ways... two little rack chops with a coffee braised lamb barbacoa.  The rack chops were delicious, but the barbacoa was in such a strong sauce that I couldn't really taste anything else.  We both tried to taste the coffee and could not.   My husband had the duck... he thought it was very good, perfectly cooked, but kind of like a lot of duck you've had at a lot of restaurants.  Four stars for the entrees. I was not thrilled by dessert.... we tried the chocolate enchiladas and could not taste one bit of chile in the chocolate sauce.  I am a sucker for the spicy, almond-y mexican chocolate thing ... and this wasn't what I had hoped.  It was pretty standard chocolate flavor.  Two stars for the dessert.

2009-07-20,3.0,"Innovative food, cool room, but still needs a bit of work before I can become a fan. Service issues were a bit more prominent than I'd like to see at a place with these prices.  I was here as part of a group of 8 people for dinner. The size of our group, which, in all honesty, fluctuated a bit, seemed to throw off the servers who, at first, tried to put us at two separate tables. This was after some time spent at the bar, trying to attract the attention of the proper server to arm us with wine or beer to wait the arrival of the rest of our party. (There was apparently no bartender, and so we had to wait for our server to happen to be behind the bar to get us a drink. This translates into standing at a near-empty bar, asking for a wine list, while multiple servers ignore you. Annoying.) While we're on the subject of drinks, one of my friends tried to order a round of tequila for the table while we awaited appetizers. We were told that the chef didn't like to do this: tequila was for after dinner only. Okay, I get it. They don't want to be *that* kind of cheap-tequila-soaked restaurant. But still, the whole control freak thing- what you could drink when - was a bit much for me. (NB, we did get our tequila, but sometime long after our appetizers came.)  The food was quite good, although not terribly exciting. My favorite was the risotto, although it was was all French -- foie gras and all -- and no Mexican flavors at all. The beef tartar appetizer was also excellent. My husband enjoyed the mussels, and felt that the price-to-portion ratio on that particular dish made it a good value.  Service was slow and bit erratic, maybe because we were a big group, but I was surprised because it was Friday night and they were fully staffed, but the place wasn't full. (Torrential rainfall that night probably kept many landlubbers inside.) This aspect really needs to improve for a restaurant at this price point.  Finally, a complaint about the glassware. They served all wine in stemless glasses, which isn't anything too new or unusual. (I own some Riedel ""O"" glasses myself, and have never had a problem.) However, we had not one, not two, but THREE wine glasses spilled on the table. Two of the three involved servers, but the last one was on us. Although the servers spilled a good glass to glass-an-a-half of our wine, we weren't comped anything. (At the least, we should have received a free glass of wine.) Here's the kicker: we were told that the wine glasses had an ""optimal"" level of fullness, and when above or below that point, they got tippy. Clearly, these couldn't have been Reidel's because I've never heard of or experienced this problem. Further, we weren't warned about the potential problem until after the third glass went down. I realize this sounds petty, but red wine stains can sour an evening.  I hope to go back and try Mexique once its had more of a chance to hit its stride and improve its service.",0.9967,0.788,0.158,0.053,0.485725176291214

2009-06-30,4.0,"This restaurant has excellent execution of French-Mexican fusion food.  We split the sopes appetizer, which included three varieties - one with escargot, one with shrimp, and a vegetarian option.  The escargot and shrimp were particularly well executed and were a great introduction to the chef's approach.   For the main course, I had the lamb two ways.  The first was two ribs of rack of lamb, perfectly cooked, at my request, to a dark red rare center, with a South American spice rub - I believe it was ancho chiles, but I could be mistaken.  The second was a sope filled with shredded lamb.  It was superb.  Kelly had the ribeye special, which was surprisingly thin -- pounded down like South American steak -- but very tender and flavorful with South American spices. The wine list is small, but affordable and well thought out -- you can keep the fusion mood going by selecting the Cote du Roussillon Villages, an syrah blend from French Catalonia. The only drawback?  No spirits - the chef does not want to have the patrons dilute their palates with hard liquor (what the hell?  This is America!).  Despite his Charlie Trotter aspirations, you can sneak ia little liquor into your dinner if they have the special dessert, which is essentially molten chocolate cake with a tres leches creme anglais.  The tres leches is spiked with tequila.  (Do try to avoid shooting it, however).

And there are not shortage of great places to cure that sinful urge for rich French food. So, the crepes with Mexican flavors (peppers, spices, cheese, etc.) are good, but not enough to make me crave them, same with the onion soup which again, was good, but kinda weird. But we've been back at least four times for brunch because the fish tacos are great and the service is good and it's close to home. If you're a fish taco fan, like me, here's what makes them worth a trip to Mexique.  They serve three small soft tacos with a nice portion of barely breaded, perfectly cooked fish (Tilapia maybe?) and a light but creamy chipotle sauce along with pickled onion.  It comes with a little side salad of micro-greens that I usually put on the tacos because they have both a little bitterness from the greens and sweetness from the olive oil drizzle.  It's just perfectly executed every time and the flavors are right on. I've been trying to replicate these at home and have so far been unsuccessful at getting the fish just right and you've got to have the right kind of greens with that essential bitterness for it all to work.   I did finally figure out how to make my own quick pickled onions though!",0.9853,0.76,0.161,0.079,0.5378042328042327

But let me backtrack a bit; I have been eyeing this restaurant ever since it opened because it's in my neighborhood, keeps getting rave Yelp reviews and it's Mexican/French fusion- I mean, how much better could it get?  I noticed recently that they have a moderately priced brunch menu and being the attempting-to-be-thrifty-in-this-economy girl I am I decided it was time to check it out, in the company of the beautiful newlyweds Reuben H and Aurore L. The menu had so many amazing sounding dishes to offer, it was a matter of narrowing it down from everything to just one dish (or two if you are Reuben!).  The huarache (described above) was actually the first choice of all three of us, but Reuben was nice enough to go for something else so we got to taste more than one dish.  We split the mussels which did not particularly impress me, but I was fan of the tomato-saffron beurrec blanc broth they came in, so maybe it was a fluke and they are normally better, or maybe 11 AM is a little too early for shellfish.  As Aurore and I enjoyed our huarache dishes, Reuben raved about his chorizo sopes and was nice enough to share.  The fish tacos that were also ordered provided to be too much food and wrapped up for later snacking, with the rest of Aurore and my dishes- portions were very generous.  The water and coffee pourers were on the ball, never was a cup left half full (half empty?) at our table, which I like because I tend to swill beverages quickly at meals. Overall it was a great experience, one that left me wanting to go back for brunch in the future (soon) and to go back to try their dinner menu as well.",0.9931,0.844,0.146,0.01,0.4036924119241192
2009-03-02,4.0,"Sometimes the dilemma of going to a restaurant and not knowing what to order is annoying. You see a bunch of items on it that conjure up no specific urge or appetite. Everything is edible, but uninspiring- and so the question becomes ""What won't I be disappointed in?""  Then there are times, like what I encountered yesterday, in which every item on the menu is not only appetizing, but nearly damn well drives you crazy.  Brunch for me tends to make my decision making skills even more clouded. Not sure if it is due to the weekend mornings being hazy from a lack of routine (getting up before 6:00 AM, having coffee in hand no later than 7:30, opening up at the office no later than 8:00), or if it is tough simply because brunch usually only happens once a week at most- and so I want to make the most of it. Ask my dear wife and she will tell you- I suck at making a decision and holding firm to it. Whether it is figuring out what to make for dinner, or picking out a paint color for our walls, I have commitment issues with just about everything but who I am with.  Luckily I was not the only one yesterday who had a hard time making up their mind on what to order (eh-hem Ms. Erin P.!)- and in the case of Mexique- it was that problem that I love to find myself in.  Unlike the fine ladies I held company with- I actually held an original order by NOT going with the Huarache (although it was delicious as well). I instead chose an order of Sopes de Chorizo which were the best I have ever had. Constructed as a Sope, but reminding me of an offshoot of an eggs benedict dish, the flavors were delicious and everything was perfectly cooked- right down to the egg whose yolk cracked right over the small corn cup, melting my heart right along with it..........  No, no, no- I promised myself to not get all sappy and romantic over food anymore. It is just silly and causes too many issues. How can I commit myself to something that I devour and can't love me back? Besides, I was amongst very good company and didn't need to engross myself in the love of a brunch item. On top of it all- the sopes were served with some bland and slightly overcooked green beans. That alone would have been enough to snap me out of my food lust.  Adding to the wonderful sopes, I ordered an ""Achilles Heal"" item that I always fall for when I see it on menus- fish tacos. This time it was your standard Tilapia- but were done really well. The pickled relish of jalapeños, zanahorias, y cebollos (that is jalapeños, carrots, and onions those that can't habla the español) were paired with a spicy mayonnaise and very nicely prepared deep fried tilapia.  Service was pretty good- I was complimented (probably more like flattered- after all, this guero doesn't speak THAT good en español) on my pronunciation, and we got refilled on our coffee almost as quickly as we drank it.  One noticeable thing though. I have noticed talk about this place being a fusion of French and Mexican. In my opinion, there is no fusion involved with what I see. What it is is Mexican food with a bit more refined presentation than what we are used to. You can pick up on the knife skills and the preparation at times might be more traditionally French- but the flavors and even menu items are all Mexican.

2008-12-15,4.0,"Mexique + Me + A Handful of Fabulous Friends = One Really Good Time  Mexique + Me Again + Few Minor Tweaks = One Really Spectacular Time  What might be the difference you're inclined to ask? And does it really matter? Well, yes, and here's why:  Mexique has a really solid concept going; upscale Mexican dining with a bit of French flair set in a minimalist, urban environment. If executed well, then formulaically all cylinders should be firing in unison for an incredible and unique dining experience. Now, a few missteps here and there... you're likely to begin packing up your sombrero and maracas and yearning for Tecalitlan's cheap carne asada platos.  Mexique needs a bartender. Period. Why else have that shiny polished oasis there if no one is going to hawk booze behind it? I waited at the bar - as my perpetually early self often does - figuring I'd have a cocktail and peruse the menu while my group filtered in. Unfortunately, my time there earned me 2 tall glasses of water from a nice busser and zero attention from someone curious if I might like something stronger. Maybe my dress wasn't cut low enough? I'd beg to differ.  Getting noticed thankfully came much easier once we were seated with a very friendly server in front of a menu that sounded positively mouthwatering. His suggestions were spot on and we quickly found ourselves noshing on some delicious apps... The Tingo de Pollo tostaditas with smoky shredded chipotle chix and cool créme fraîche were devoured, in unladylike fashion no less, by yours truly while a few buds slurped on the Mexique version of french onion soup - jazzed up with fire-roasted poblanos and loads of gruyere made it a true signature treat!!  Our entrees were really nice once they *finally* arrived even though one of my dining companions was left sitting with no food for what seemed like an eternity. I know they were slammed that night but I always find that pretty inexcusable... well that and the fact that they were slammed due to a party there that night that took up over half the capacity of the restaurant. That seemed irresponsible and created a less-than-stellar experience for the rest of us... our service was compromised and it was hella loud. Harumph. On the ups though, my asada in goat cheese fondue was SICK!! In a good way, naturally. Tasty, delicious, creamy, perfectly cooked. I couldn't have asked for a better dish.  I did find the French 'influence' at Mexique to be thrown in here and there almost as a side thought... ""we'll throw some goat cheese here or add haricots verts as side dish!"" - I'd like to see a bit more complexity from them, no one said Frenchxican was gonna be easy!! All in all though, the food was great and the dessert was truly the best I've had in a looong time. Chocolate enchiladas peeps! Fabulous crepes filled with chocolate ganache, toasty walnuts, ancho chile-fondue and créme anglaise with a sidecar of vanilla ice cream.

Apparently, I talk about them a lot.  Walking in on the very chilly blustery night, I greeted the table and looked around. They had made some great improvements to the look of the place. Still quite minimal in decor, but they finished the bar and added deep reds and accents of smokey gray which really seemed to warm the place up much more than the last time I was in.

Their wine list has improved, though I do have to say I was slightly disappointed in not seeing a lot of options for sparkling, (what can I say, I love the bubbles?), but overall about 15 options or so for red and white wines. We chose a fairly priced Malbec which was quite good. We decided we were all starving, so appetizers needed to happen. Stat. I saw some new options this time, which I was happy to see. We had the Tinga de pollo, (think small, crispy corn tortillas with a slightly smokey red sauce and shredded chicken and creme freche on top), a little messy, but still just as good as I remembered. I also went with their version of French Onion Soup. A really excellent French onion soup, plenty of cheese, but sadly it said it was combined with roasted poblano peppers and I must have missed the smokiness. Or perhaps I was enjoying all that cheese. The other part of our group got a trio of sopes, but alas I didn't get to try. I will say this, the appetizers can be small, so if you are more than two, you might want to double up. Someone also got the mushroom soup with shitaki mushrooms, rich and creamy and very soul nurturing. We then ventured to our main courses. They had a misstep on one main course, but the right plate arrived a few minutes later. I went with the pork tenderloin again. Really just as good if not better than the first time. The pork tender and not overcooked, the potato and pepper galette was crispy and offset the savory eggplant and zucchini ratatouille. Apparently many at the table liked the pork, but even that ratatouille even more. I had their tempranillo with it, perfect choice. I do have to say I think I liked it more than the Malbec and that really is saying something. The steak was well cooked, coming out at a perfect medium rare and the salmon with sweet corn and saffron porridge balanced the salmon well. Then we have dessert.  I love dessert. I try and hide my sweet tooth as often as possible, but here I had to let it out. Going from last time, I went with the enchiladas, one member of our table had the creme bruelee and another had the apple tart. I think this is the quietest our table got as we munched and devoured our sweet treats. The enchiladas were as good and chocolaty as I remembered and I thoroughly enjoyed them. It was hard not to pick the plate up and lick it clean. So.... I just used my fingers as discretely as possible. The bill was decent, about $60 per person including tip.  The place has great service and wonderful food, but when you go, have the enchiladas, or if you are allergic to chocolate all I have to say is have the apple tart... oh... and my sympathies.",0.9993,0.753,0.209,0.038,0.5125332498826474
2008-12-09,4.0,my first experience here at Mexique was a good one! the food is an amazing mix of mexican and french! the service was very friendly and helpful. the decor was minimal and not distracting. i would have giving 5 stars but i had 2 things that made me not. the first was the bathroom. it was very clean but to get there you kinda got to walk past the kitchen and when we went it was really busy. on the way in a waiter almost ran into me and on the way out i almost ran into another waiter with a tray of food! that would have been so bogus! also we wanted to try desert. so we got this avocado mouse. i know guys reading this wont understand but ladies if you have ever tried one of the avocado masks it kinda tasted like that with a little bit of sugar added. i really don't recommend that one at all! however everything else was awesome! i want to go back and try there brunch menu sometime in the near future!,0.9673,0.841,0.143,0.016,0.4177450980392157

At first we were handed regular menus, but after talking with the hostess we found we were the first people that evening to take them up on the promotion. The restaurant is fairly small, and after a very large party left the audio level was fine. Service was very friendly, and we felt like we were well taken care of. We ordered a number of dishes. Of the appetizers, we really enjoyed the chicken tostaditas. I'm not a fan of french onion soup, but my friends liked the poblano twist on that recipe. Main courses included roasted chicken topped with mole, grilled flank steak, and vegetarian crepes stuffed with mushrooms. My favorite was the steak, it was seasoned well and served with a nice ""fondue""-type sauce. The desserts included a sweet avocado cream with cinnamon-dusted fried tortilla crisps, and chocolate ganache ""enchiladas"". I liked both; I think my friends were a little more into the chocolate dessert, as the avocado cream makes a bit of a strange first impression.

So the concept of Mexican cuisine with a French influence is surely something new to me suggesting a possibly perilous case of ADD, but I assure you this absolutely works!  My GF had the chorizo sopes.  Yes...I had no clue what ""sopes"" was till I just looked it up now...miniature friend corn-dough bowls filled with all kinds of goodness.   The ""guacasalsa"" on top of this dish was fantastic!  I went for the chorizo stuffed crepes, to really test out the concept of mexican and french food.  The result was an amazingly unique dish that really worked.  A perfect lightly browned crepe stuffed with what I assume to be a french cheese, eggs, and just enough chorizo to bring the dish to life.  I don't know what made up the sauce on top, but it really tied the dish together.  If you are looking for something a little different than your usual brunch fare, you have come to the right place.   The chef here at Mexique has clearly thought through his dishes and flavor combinations to come up with something that smoothly blends the best of 2 different cuisines.  And all this at a really fair price....they definitely don't skimp on quantity or quality here.  Not to mention the service was attentive and friendly, with even a stop-by from who I assume to be the owner/chef to check if we were enjoying our dishes.   The shocker to me was that this place was almost empty during brunch.   I would be willing to wait in a line for my Mexique experience, but at this point, that's not even an issue.  Kudos to the chef and friendly staff....keep doin' what you're doin!    I can't wait to go back to try out dinner.",0.9975,0.818,0.168,0.014,0.4652414070446857

2008-08-18,4.0,"I wasn't sure what to expect when a friend said this place served Mexican food with a French flair. The idea goes back to when the French occupied Mexico in the 1860's using local ingredients cooked with Gallic techniques. Hmm . . sounded intriguing and we were hungry so off we went to try out Mexique. Located in West Town- Mexique has been open for a couple of months.  The decor is minimalistic- exposed brick walls with little ornamentation but there are pops of color around and a giant bar area up front. We were met at the door by the wife of the chef and after introducing herself (Iliamar Issac) and welcoming us to her restaurant- seated us at a table.  Nice start to a pleasant evening. Our server came over quickly and offered us beer or wine.  We ordered a couple of beers and began to peruse the menu. It's funny how the same things appeal to us no matter what restaurant we are at- so we chose the mussels and the beef tartar.  The mussels were really good and they came with dried chorizo sausage and a tomato saffron buerre blanc sauce .  They were served with crispy bread that was perfect for sopping up the sauce from the mussels. So good!  The beef tartar was not what I expected- but delicious.  The raw beef was mixed with onions and something else and had sliced jalapeno peppers on top which made it HOT!  Served on crusty bread- it was an interesting take on an old favorite.  Did I say it was HOT?? As for our entrees, I went with the flank steak and my friend had the roasted lamb.  Since both were good- it was hard to determine a winner between the two-both had distinct flavors and came with sides like fingerling potatoes or a ""corn cup"" filled with braised lamb. I had a sweet tooth last night so we ordered dessert- the chocolate enchilada and the apple tart.  Both came with vanilla bean ice cream but the apple tart was the clear winner in my book.  The enchilada was just a little too ""chocolaty"" for my taste (Who knew there could be such a thing as too much chocolate?) The service was consistent- the prices reasonable and the food was good.  The chef/owner Carlos Gaytan even came out to see how we were enjoying our food which was a nice touch.

It was VERY loud in there. Our waitress acknowledged this when she first came to our table and told us they were working on the sound.  No problem getting and being seated. Shortly after being seated a woman came over to welcome herself and introduced herself as one of the owners (along with her husband). This was a nice touch but quickly things went downhill. Our waitress recommended the Ceviche as a starter. So we did this along with their Cochinita which sounded good.  My wife and I both love Ceviche. I can tell you this is the worst I have probably ever had.  The fish- halibut was cut in long strips. It was very tough and had a  fishy taste. We could  not eat it.  Ok, so strike 1.  We then got our Cochinita served with 3 toasted pieces of brioche. My wife found a good size bone in the Cochinita. It really wasn't very good. When our waitress came over we told her about both and she thanked us for our feedback and took both away. They were both uneaten pretty much. The ceviche in particular was untouched. I pointed out to her the texture of the fish.  So strike 2.  For dinner I got the pork tenderloin my wife got carne asada. Bother were very average at best. The best part of our meail was dessert and I am not a sweets guy. It was their chocolate enchilladas. Needless to say was a bit dissapointed when check came and we were charged for both starters that we didn't eat.  The waitress, while nice, was very preoccupied. As she handed us our check she said she was glad to hear everything was awesome (which I have no idea how she got the impression we enjoyed our dinner). After our dinner the chef came over (as people have pointed out in other reviews) and commented on the ceviche. He said he likes to keep the fish as natural as possible, etc.  What he failed to realize is as a chef he did not pick out a fresh or good cut of fish. So overall, based on the prices they are charging (we spent $120 with a few glasses of wine) it does not warrant the food or experience.  In the area go to the likes of Adobo Grill for similar but better food.

For our meals, we tried a steak dish, pork and duck.  All were extremely tasty, creative, and had nice portion sizes.  Finally, we had an avacado cream dessert, and then I was completely sold on this place- this chef has that special ability to combine unusual ingredients to create a culinary masterpiece. So you can imagine my suprise when the chef told us he never went to culinary school, and that this is his first restaurant. Alinea- watch out. This chef has got talent.",0.996,0.764,0.23,0.006,0.6151031746031745
2008-06-26,5.0,"Had a phenomenal dining experience here tonight! Enough to bring me back to Yelp for the first time in a while.  Coming into this restaurant, I wasn't completely sure what to expect. Knowing that its culinary focus was on a sort of Mexican-French fusion, I felt that the results might be really good or really bad. I'm happy to report that everything we ate was perfectly cooked, flavored, and presented. Chef Carlos has a real insight for flavor profiles and does a great job of integrating French-style cooking techniques with Mexican flavors.  I had a French onion soup with Manchego and Habanero that was really tasty. Other highlights from the table were the Carne over pureed Malanga root with white truffle oil, the Lamb, and Enchiladas dessert.  Chef Carlos came out to our table at the end of the meal and took the time to inquire what each member of our party had for their entree and talked a bit about what was behind the dish and its preparation/flavors. Ditto what others have said about him seeming like a genuine, nice guy.  My only complaint is that I used to live in this neighborhood, and this restaurant arrived too late for me to eat there more frequently! They have a brunch that looks great as well.",0.9722,0.833,0.132,0.036,0.48755144032921816

2008-06-10,4.0,"Kris S. took me out for a late birthday dinner tonight. I very much enjoyed the duck entree I had. The beet salad was good and I do love fried goat cheese, but I have had better. It was an interesting pairing with watercress. The chef was amazingly nice and came up to us to ask about what we ordered and then when it came, he asked how it was. I love that. The duck portion was huge and the plate had both confit and duck breast (see my photo). I thoroughly enjoyed it with the tamarind sauce. The corn tamal that it was atop was really a strange taste to grasp but in the end I liked it. The way I like duck best is when it's a little red, but this was cooked through, but still very enjoyable. I will definitely come back here, likely with Kris, and next time I will get to try the avocado dessert. That sounds so great!",0.9961,0.681,0.306,0.013,0.5466666666666666
2008-06-02,5.0,"Great new restaurant in a rapidly developing area. I thought the vibe and decor was chic and understated modern. Chef and his hostess wife were very friendly. Attentive service.  Mussels as the appetizer were fanastic----very flavorful and HUGE! My husband had the steak at the chef's suggestion----chef even brought out a special side of homemade spicy mango sauce, which was a nice touch.  I loved the duck----both duck breast and confit.  Restaurant will be even more lively once they get the bar up and running.  We eat out all the time in Wicker Park/Bucktown/Ukranian Village and have very high expectations. This was a great choice.",0.983,0.752,0.248,0.0,0.6752287712287711
