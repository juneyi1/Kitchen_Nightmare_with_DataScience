I have had sushi all over Chicago (Roka, Union, Enso, Para - more to be had, for sure!), and not one of them compares to my Blue Fin experience. The sushi was beautiful, it was fresh, and it was delicious. The rolls were scrumptious, the sake was hot, tasty, and effective. The service was wonderful. I've been waiting to go back.

He shared some of his salmon sashimi and it was so delicious. The texture was firm but melted like butter in my mouth. Perfect super fresh salmon flavor. I chose an Ocean Drive roll, 3 pieces of sushi and edamame. Everything was fresh and bursting with flavor. I know this sounds strange, but the edamame was the most perfectly salted I've ever had.

I can't handle spicy and hot things, so I would not recommend the spicy tuna roll if you can't handle it since the Spicy Tuna Roll is spicier than average Spicy Tuna Roll. I tried the shrimp tempera roll just in case it might have tasted different this time, but it still had the fishy smell and oily taste.

We started with the house salad with ginger dressing; nothing special but I can't go to a sushi restaurant without getting one... Although this one was a pretty good sized salad (more than 3 leaves of lettuce, like at some other restaurants) and the ginger dressing was good. For sushi, we got a piece of uni each, which was bomb... Pretty good size portion and only $9 for two pieces. I also ordered some white tuna and salmon sashimi, both tasted really fresh. The soft shell crab tempura and shrimp tempura rolls were on point as well.  Service here was a little slow but I think maybe it was because it was late and they didn't have many servers working--it was okay because the restaurant was only maybe half full and we had plenty of time to chat.

The kind that tastes exactly how you expect it to taste and look.

I went there on a groupon we had purchased and while the service was adequate the food and experience was not.

They said that the fine print states ""other restrictions may apply"". Well, after combing over the fine print and not coming up with the other restrictions anywhere it was obvious they lied to us... Ok...we decided since we were there and had already purchased the groupon to stick it out since we already had money in it at that point. For our appetizers the edamame was under cooked but the vegetable tempura was decent. We ordered about 4 sushi rolls to split and while the sushi was ok the portions were way small. It was another example of paying for a full meal and then leaving hungry which I hate. When it was all said and done we had about $90 (including the $40 groupon) in on a meal for two and we both left hungry.

More than once, we have received an extra appetizer just as a thank you for being loyal customers.  I will agree with some reviewers who said the place is sometimes empty when they dined in.

The presentation is seriously awesome, and the taste matches the way it looks! Their edamame and house salad is always a must for me too. Always fresh and delish!

2012-07-03,1.0,Blue Fin Maki Bar is the appropriate name due to minimal sushi variety. Pricing for martini is based on well vodka.  The passé Mango Tini is decent that is too sweet and bit bitter even though well vodka is upgraded (for a fee) to Grey Goose.  Isn't Grey Goose supposed to leave a clean taste?  Where is the light bitterness coming from? Friendly service but uninformative.  I got a soy sauce dish without soy sauce on the table.  Nor did she asked the type of soy sauce. Flee market decor. Caution:  Blue Fin likes their chili mayo sauce that left my mouth dry after the meal.  Credit card not accepted for less than $10. Wondering....I don't think Japanese dishes use red chili sauce.  Wasabi is IT for spiciness.  So....Blue Fin is Thai or Chinese?,0.8695,0.818,0.132,0.049,0.32938596491228067

2012-06-15,5.0,"Not even 2 hours ago, I got back from the most incredible dinner. Sushi that blew me away. A place called Blue Fin, located on North Ave in Chicago  bluefinsushichicago.com  My friend H and I walked in, and it was empty. I can't understand why because we were floored. The quality is superb, the flavors were unbelievable, and the prices were reasonable too. Why on earth was this place so empty? Obviously we stumbled onto a hidden gem of Chicago for sushi restaurants. I am pleased to be able to share this place with the world. So here is what stood out for me. First of all, they have a great, unique menu. They had the traditional rolls but also some new and interesting items. Like, they have Vegetable tempura as one of their appetizers. H loves anything tempura, so we decided to try it. It was really yummy, not too over fried and tasted good. No complaints on either of our ends. Onto the main dishes! Normally, out of the two of us, H is the unadventurous one, not a big fan of things that are spicy or too out there. No big deal, each to their own. So she orders the White Dragon roll, which was super white tuna, avocado, and shrimp tempura. Although we frequently go out and get sushi at different places, she's never really wowed. This roll, it wowed her! I have never seen her so content with sushi, out of all the different places and all the crazy kinds I've made her try. Let's just say she was in heaven. And I tried a piece, so I can tell you why: the flavors were phenomenal and married with expertise. Avocado paired with the super white tuna was perfect, because the super white tuna is fattier. They complemented each other in a beautiful way. On my end, I ordered the Tornado roll. It was out of this world! A sushi roll that's deep fried with crab, spicy tuna and avocado, and then wrapped in a potato, and topped with a spicy sauce. I say out of this world because I have never found a roll this unique anywhere else. Blue Fin gets some serious points for basically creating a work of art in flavors and unusual tastes. Together, my mouth was happy and shocked all at once, for that first bite. It was quite spicy, but the roll was also slightly sweet, so it neutralized the spiciness as you were chewing. I mean, brilliance all around. One simple thing blew my mind completely: besides the unique menu and the tasty rolls, there were palette cleansers on hand with the sushi. Our food comes out and it's on this giant plate, with a presentation of cucumber and apple slices, along with the wasabi and ginger that's standard. It was just so unusual, but it really made sense. Apple slices and cucumber slices to cleanse your palette  in between all the different kinds of rolls. I really liked that they did that. Overall, Blue Fin is a great restaurant for sushi. Truly a hidden gem that the world needs to unearth, because I want to go back, and fully intend to. The service is great, my waitress was amazing, the food is fantastic, I can't complain. If you're in the area, check it out. I can guarantee you will not regret it!",0.9986,0.759,0.194,0.047,0.539750309214595

No fishiness here.  3) Delta Force Roll -- Tempura maki, snowcrab meat, cream cheese, avocado, unagi sauce, masago, wasabi mayo. Quite delicious!  4) Tornado Roll -- Deep fried maki, crab meat, spicy tuna, avocado, potato, masago, scallion, spicy sauce, unagi sauce. This roll was my favorite of the two. Instead of being wrapped in seaweed, the seaweed was replaced by a thin layer of potato. Innovative and tasty! 5) Beef Teriyaki -- The teriyaki sauce is incredible. It's thick with just the right hint of sweetness. The vegetables were nicely sauteed. The beef, on the other hand.....it tasted like it was originally frozen. It realize most places do this, but there are places in Chicago that don't, so I have to point this out.

Quality & Taste: The sushi does not wow where it gives the impression of  fresh!  3. Quantity of Food. The amount of food you get here is not on the large scale. Not that you should expect that anyway from a sushi place. It gets a pass because I am not a good judge of character in this category. 4. Presentation of Food: The presentation is not spectacular. The sushi is placed on dishes and spaced out uniformly. When we came here on a Friday night we had the expectations of a long drawn out service. That is exactly what we got. I think from the time we sat down to where we actually got to eat our meal was about 75 minutes. Thank God we ordered appetizers. Also its BYOB with a $2 surcharge per person. That's not too bad.

2012-01-11,1.0,"*This review is solely meant to help, not trash, this business.* Friends and I visited Blue Fin on a Friday night a couple of weeks ago. First, I will note that the hosts and sushi chef were very welcoming upon our arrival. After we were asked if we had reservations, however, the host left us waiting a minute to ""check"" on available tables, though through visual observation alone it was obvious that the restaurant was less than half full. Upon entering the restaurant, the stench of trash (not fresh fish, not putrid fish - just trash) was apparent and appetite-zapping. The smell permeated the entire restaurant. If I were a business owner, I would think that closing the restaurant for a few hours or a night to let it air out would cost less than getting a poor review from customers. Once we were seated, the table was cleared but lacked fresh dining utensils or place mats, which our waiter had to take from another table. Additionally, the waiter asked that we wait for the other customers to finish looking at menus before he would bring us any, as they were short on menus. This is simply UNACCEPTABLE. A restaurant should know how many seats it has and have enough menus to provide each customer a menu in the event that every seat is filled. While waiting on a menu, the combined negatives were making me nauseous, so me and my friends decided to take our chances at another restaurant. I do hope that Blue Fin ups its professionalism, but I won't be making a second trip to find out.",0.853,0.88,0.081,0.039,0.3276190476190476

We ordered and ate our sushi and everything was above average.   We had to ask the server to come and refill our water and tea a few times, so she wasn't spectacular.   Then the shit started to hit the fan.   The couple seated after us paid their bill and left.  We roughly finished eating at the same time.   So I look at our server and she walks away.  She's on the phone messing around on the computer.   I assumed they were having technical issues with the POS system, but the other tables checked out just fine only minutes before we were ready for our bill.    We ended up sitting at our table, the only patrons in the restaurant, for TWENTY MINUTES without any contact from our waitress or anyone else at the restaurant even though there 5 people working.   I couldn't believe it.   I have no clue what these people are thinking, but I'm never ever going back after my experience tonight.  Sorry, you just don't leave the only people in the restaurant sitting there.  Ridiculous. Also, the music was very loud and it was some top-40, pseudo-electronica mashup crap.  Horrible.

The service is a bit slow, but earnest, and the sake flows freely. But the entire time my wife and I were there all we could think about is how much better Arami is.  Admittedly, I'm a sushi snob, having had amazing sushi in Hong Kong, Tokyo, and the East/West Coasts. But my wife, who had never really noticed much difference from sushi bar to sushi bar before, turned to me and said ""I think Arami has ruined me for all other sushi"" I knew something was up. The rice didn't have that subtle vinegar tang and was a little mushy. The spicy tuna was all heat and no flavor, and the tamago was grainy and had an off-putting musty flavor to it. The nigiri was ok, but the fish, while fresh, wasn't straight off the boat by any means.  The atmosphere was fine, albeit a bit noisy the night we were there since the table behind us was downing sake bombs and punctuated every drink by slamming their fists on the table, thus dumping soy sauce, water, and silverware onto the floor.

We instantly befriended our waitress, who was absolutely adorable and fantastic.  The service was professional and attentive, the food arrived quickly, and the sake bombs even faster.  We ordered a variety of rolls for the table, which were delicious, fresh and filling. After we finished off every last bite sushi, we ordered a round of sake bombs.   This convinced the table next to us to order a round as well, which eventually led to the very last 3 remaining tables in the restaurant (including us), the waitstaff, and the restaurant manager to join the sake, sake, sake BOMBING.  Finally around 11pm, after exchanging hugs with all of our new friends, we continued on to the next destination of our epic girls night. In conclusion, the vibe in this restaurant is young and trendy, the noise levels can get high on a Friday and Saturday night (especially with a crowd like us), and it's a great place to fill up before a night out in Old Town or Wicker park.  Separate from the atmosphere, the food itself is enough of a draw on it's own, with a creative and fun menu filled with fresh ingredients.",0.9966,0.784,0.21,0.006,0.5945454545454545

2010-12-03,5.0,"First of all, for all of the people who are complaining about getting ""food poisoning"" from their fish: please double check what food poisoning is. As for fish or seafood poisoning, it usually takes at least 12 hours for it to kick in. Yes yes, I know, it varies person to person, but seafood poisoning is relatively punctual. Anyways, I have not had a bad experience here. There was ONE time where my Saketini was a little to sweet for my taste, but then again, the woman who usually makes it for me was not there. They have also revamped their menu, lowering prices and adding items. They used to have a Honeymoon Meal for two, which included 2 soups, 2 salads, edamame, one appetizer (ANY appetizer, not just cheap ones), and 4 rolls, even specialty ones. Now that they no longer have this AND lowered their prices, I can get all of that (just about) for the same price. The service is a little paced, not OH MY GOD HURRY UP slow, just relaxing and enjoyable. They usually only have one server on the week days it seems, so be patient. If your server is too slow, let them know in a polite way and I'm positive that they would be more than happy to oblige. Not everyone likes to sit and eat slowly like I do. If you are a fish snob and think your maki or nigiri is bland and flavorless, then you need to look at the fish before you sit down at your table. If you want to be picky, then at least know what extremely fresh fish looks like so that you can make intelligent decisions on what to order. Besides my ranting, the point of this was to say that I have always enjoyed my meals at Blue Fin, and I have gone at least once a month for almost a year.

For that reason, when I first try any sushi restaurant I prefer to leave the ""signature rolls"" in the kitchen. They're the smoke and mirrors the chef takes to make the frog look like the prince. I stick with my simple favorites, yellowtail, spicy tuna, unagi, salmon, etc. as rolls or cuts. Chances are if those are great, its ALL gonna be great. That being said, Blue fin was really lacking. The veg tempura was eh, the batter was without flavor and it only came with sweet potato and squash. Aside from that i ordered an unagi roll and the california sunset roll (crab, salmon, avocado and cucumber, and a yellowtail piece). While they weren't stingy on the fish, it was all overly slimy and mushy leading me to believe its all been frozen way to long. Generally, it was without much flavor.

Their unagi is HUGE, like double the size of most sushi restaurants, but it has a bad overpowering fish flavor that I can't overlook. Most of their maki is deep-fried, which I think is a cop-out for using poor quality ingredients. Don't get me wrong, having some tempura in or around a roll can make it awesome, but a lot of their items don't indicate they're fried based on the descriptions. When I ordered a couple of their specialty maki rolls, I was really expecting something fresh and light, like sushi should be. What I got was heavy, deep-fried bricks that made me feel like I just ate a large order of fries at McDonald's. The saving grace was the ""dragon eyes,"" which are mushrooms that are stuffed with spicy tuna. They were also deep-fried, but they were light, and the mushrooms paired so well with the spicy tuna.

Usually when I open the menu at a sushi place I have a hard time narrowing down the choices and deciding what to get. At Blue Fin it was more like I had to try to figure out what on the menu sounded good. I ended up getting the Little Dragon and the Catepillar, along with the Tuna Tartar app, all of which were ok but nothing special. The drinks were my favorite thing about this place. I had a delicious mango martini to start and then a really good bottle of cold sake. My friend ordered it for us (I never order sake) but it was surprisingly tasty and went really well with the food. I wish I knew the name of it so I could get it again, but I'm sure I'll be trying more sake in the future.

I will say this, the Pink Lady appetizer has consistently been very good.  The Chicago roll is usually fairly good, Hot Night is hit or miss, as is the Black dragon.  Their shrimp shumai has always been very tasty.  Skip the Golden dragon -  - well, again this is based on my recent visits.  Golden dragon was always delicious in the past.  What happened?  It just seems that they're making them differently.  Not as much flavor now.

I mean, we showed up without a reservation on a Friday night, what more can we expect?!

It was as good as the best sushi I have ever had in LA and with a great atmosphere. They employ a live DJ, which is not as pretentious as it sounds, since the techno music goes very nicely with the updated feel of this place, but I did not find it too trendy. The rolls range from standard to unusual and all the fish we tried was great. The soft shell crab was a little tough and the portions are small. Each order is one piece instead of two. Needless to say it was expensive. The tuna in particular is delicious and the tartare appetizer was flavorful and sharp. I like the golden tobiko they use and the selection of fresh fish was small but interesting.

I don't know; I feel like this place gets a bad rap because decor and ambiance-wise, it does try a little too hard, and fits into a rather stereotypical template of the trendy sushi bar.  It can therefore seem ""very two years ago"" in the same way that Vegas casinos get dated really quickly.  But block that out because the fish is quite good and the service was very helpful, or at least it was on this visit.",0.9798,0.771,0.177,0.053,0.5673611111111111

I decided that I wanted to take my Mommaship and Aunt to a sushi dinner (and, make them converts to the cult of sashimi) - Lindz recommended Blue Fin. The ambiance was nice - they have the ultra-cool hipster vibe dead on.  I found the ambient noise playing over the sound-system slightly distracting to trying to have a conversation... I'm sorry but the 8pm dinner rush in March is too early for trance-dance music... you know?  Just give us some nice, soft classical until at least 9pm, yo... ! Now - for me - the food: - The fish was adequately fresh, the portions pretty generous... their rolls were decent and inventive... I had some supremely good Monkfish liver and pretty decent Toro - along with my standard salmon sashimi w/soup, rice and seaweed salad.  The Miso was a little fishy for my taste - but, it could have just been a bowl taken from close to the bottom of the pot. - For the price of my dinner ($62 some odd dollars not counting sake of which I had a copious amount) I could have had a FEAST in either San Francisco or Boston... the aggregate value was disappointing.  However, I chalked it up to sushi being something of an incongruity in a land-locked (I'm sorry lovely as Lake Michigan is it is not the Pac or Atl ocean - it's just not) state.  Okay, whatevs. What the highlight of the evening was: - Watching my Mommaship and Auntie's faces pucker up as they tried Toro and Monkfish liver for the first time... PRICELESS! Made the meal worth every penny. Of my Mommie's money. Yes, I'm that kinda punk. (They got chicken and beef bento, so don't fret that they starved...
