2017-07-28,1.0,"I vaguely recalled dining here once before some several years ago, and the impression I was left with at the time was good cuisine in a small but homey room setting.  Sorry to say, my comeback has met with a completely different impression! If there there is one thing that will ruin food, it's not knowing how to season it. Thai cuisine stands out for its variety of flavors, so to slather it all with sugar to compensate for lack of care in preparation is inexcusable (which I see I'm not the only one who has commented on in the case of this restaurant). I split two noodle dishes, pad siew and pad kimao respectively, with my company. Granted both are stir fried noodle dishes that share a lot of similar ingredients, there is still supposed to be a distinction between the two- however, all I tasted was the same instant sauce slathered on both. There was no presence of spiciness in the pad kimao as it is well known for, much to my complete disappointment, just a mouthful of sweet. I almost felt sick after a few mouthfuls...

I asked if she could send me an email or text for my records, but she said, ""No, just call and tell us. We have your number and a note on file.""

I remember choosing their tom ka kai soup and something else.  This time though I brought a friend of mine and we ate inside.  I really enjoyed their cozy, albeit tiny restaurant that was complete with soft lighting and easy listening music. Nice touch!  Wish more restaurants would get on board with making their spaces more inviting and less sterile.  One quibble though, I thought their chairs could be a little more comfy, I ended up sitting on a hard bench which was butted against the wall and my dining companion sat on a hard backed  chair. Ouch!    We both shared an order of crab rangoon as our appetizer and each of us had their delicious Tom ka kai soup. YUM! They definitely do not stint on ingredients at Aroi Thai.  Plus the service was efficient and not at all obtrusive. The crab rangoon was fresh tasting and had a crunchy outer layer, I could tell it was freshly made by the way it just melted in my mouth without leaving any kind of an aftertaste.  Once again, the soup tasted like I remembered it, overloaded with an abundance of hearty ingredients, chunky button mushrooms, coconut milk and a touch of ginger, etc.  Probably the best I've ever tasted.   This meal was easy on the wallet too, total bill was under $20   So I guess you could say I'm completely sold on this restaurant... except of course for the seating!",0.9923,0.82,0.17,0.01,0.5480769230769231

They do a tremendous amount of carry-out orders, and that can prevent the wait staff from serving the customers seated in the small dining room. Once you get the food order in, it comes quickly. I've been to Aroy Thai twice recently, for lunch and dinner, and with different groups of friends. I was the only vegetarian/vegan, and, as usual with Thai restaurants, I found plenty of choices.  The carnivores dining with me had beef, chicken, and shrimp, in various combinations, and everything was to their liking. The general consensus was that Aroy Thai flavors everything nicely. I think it is spiced for American tastes, but they are willing to add enough heat to make it palatable to Thai people. This is a good little restaurant. I don't think I'd travel far to eat here, but since it's in the neighborhood, and directly across the street from the Damen stop, it offers convenience as well as flavor.

Three of us had the Pork Neck Salad, Crab Meat Egg Noodles, and Chou Chi Ground Pork, and all were fantastic. The Pork Neck Salad not only has a sweet name, but was the highlight for me. The meat was tender and basking in a spicy sour sauce (4/5 heat was enough to keep me sweating and loving it), with onions and basil. It's not a salad in any way I would think of when hearing the word salad, but it was a standout dish. The Crab meat egg noodles were very good as well, although needed a little kick of hot sauce which we quickly remedied, and the Chou Chi Ground pork was also a winner- the inclusion of a fried egg really fit well with the dish.   I like the way their menu describes each dish and also identifies what they identify as traditional or unique, as I had no idea what many were despite being somewhat versed in Thai cuisine. The service was friendly and attentive, and her recommendations were on point.  I recommend this place if you want to try something a little more creative and complex than your basic Pad Thai (although they have that too).",0.9928,0.779,0.202,0.019,0.654375

(Another one may be Sticky Rice) Here are some things that you have to try: - Sausages Combination - Thai sausages. I like because it showcases the unique Thai spices and herbs. - Thai Wings Appetizer - We usually order 3 of this. It looks like a normal chicken wing, but the skin is crispier and it is seasoned in the Thai style (cilantro root, fish sauce). Very authentic. - Their soup is very good, can't go wrong with either.   - Coconut-based: Tom Kha Kai Soup, Tom Yum Goong Soup   - Clear soup: Pork Ribs Soup, Spicy and Sour Seafood Soup, Beef Tendon Soup. Sometimes other restaurants get the sourness wrong (e.g. lemon vs. lime). Our favorite is Beef Tendon Soup because it's hard to get somewhere else. - For entrees, try any of the pad basil (e.g. basil duck, basil chicken, etc.) or the ""Crying Tiger"" (Another dish that we usually order more than one. Juicy grilled meat with special Thai sauce.) - For vegetable, try Chinese Broccoli with Salty Fish (note the salty fish) or the ""mixed vegetable"". - Also if you still have room, ask if they have the sticky rice with mango for dessert.

2016-01-17,5.0,"Aroy Thai is one of my favorite places to order delivery from but until recently I'd never actually eaten there. It was a rainy afternoon and I was off work early so I decided to sit down and give it a try. As soon as I walked in, I saw two women sitting at a table in the front dining room snapping piles of green beans. I carry an immense nostalgia for the snapping of green beans. My great grandmother used to snap green beans for hours in her kitchen and my mother updated the tradition snapping them on the couch when we watched tv. Needless to say, I was happy.  The smell of green beans and the gentle sound of snapping made me really hungry so I quickly scanned the menu for something with green beans and settled on the Pad Tuah with chicken. It was quite chilly and rainy so I also got some Tom Young Goong. My only criticism about the food is that the soup only comes in one rather large size and I just wanted a little cup of it. My meal was delicious. The green beans were very fresh and cooked just the way I like: very crisp. At the end of the meal, my waitress gave me a tamarind candy with my check and it was so good I asked for more so she brought me a handful.

That's just the cut of meat they chose and it had little to no harmful effects on the dish itself.  Shrimp panang curry was spectacular! The perfect balance of sweet, spicy, and savory. These are favors every chef tries to master and this dish encompasses them all. Rich in flavor and so decadent.

Entrees were Spicy & Sour Seafood Soup and the Duck Curry. Seafood soup broth was flavorful and rich - bright lemongrass, tart lime, and aromatic basil accompanied the shrimp, squid, and white fish wonderfully.  Duck Curry was my favorite dish that we tried. Succulent roasted duck served in a red curry-coconut milk broth with cherry tomatoes, basil, and pineapple.

It was always very good but we recently moved out of their delivery area so when we occasionally order, we will have it delivered to a friend's house in their delivery area and go and pick it up there.  No more. I ordered two entrees, an app and a sticky rice at 545 this evening. At 645, I called and was told it was on the way (my friend's house is 10-15 mins away from the restaurant). At 715, I called and said to cancel because I had a starving toddler and they already lied to me about it being on the way, he assured me so I waited. Food finally arrived at 745. The delivery woman told me something about a new phone guy and he made a mistake on the order and blah blah blah.  I asked her to itemize the charges because $40 seemed a little high for what we ordered.  She called her manager and I went to their menu page on my phone. When she read off the costs, the entrees and app were $2-$3 more than on the website.  I told her that and she sarcastically said she tell the guy to update the website. I said at the very least, they could have comped me something after the ordeal I went through.  I tipped her $2 on a $40 order and she mumbled something in Thai as she walked away.  I told her they just lost a customer and she literally replied 'I don't care'. I told her maybe the guy who pays her will when I call.  Not over.  Got the food home.  My entree was ok but that along with the sticky rice and chicken satay had clearly been cooked, cooled and reheated but the worst was my wife's dish: spicy bamboo chicken.  It smelled like a child's crap filled diaper and it went straight into the garbage. I'm sure many people have great experiences here and love it, just like we used to.  This, however, was completely unacceptable and hope future buyers beware.  Opart, Rosded and Spoon are Thai places in the immediate area that are significantly better than this place.",0.6127,0.794,0.104,0.102,0.5891064491064492

2015-09-10,4.0,"The first time I went to aroy, I loved it so much I wanted to go again the very next day. Everything on the menu sounded - and looked, because pictures accompany every item - so interesting! And it's not just your generic americanized Thai dishes, though they are on the menu too. After a night of nonstop campaigning, my bf and I ended up going once every other day for a week and a half. We wanted to do a perfect 7 days, every other day, but by the fifth visit we needed some time from those flavors.  Obviously I love Aroy very, very much. But it's not a 5 star experience in my book. While some of the dishes are true home runs every time, our vast sampling revealed a lot of weak points in their menu and inconsistencies in seasoning. That said... it's probably the most solid friendly BYOB neighborhood restaurant I've discovered in Chicago in my five years here.  Our biggest complaints:  1) After a while, a lot of the stir fry dishes end up blending together since they have very similar ""generic Chinese food"" soy-based flavors.  2) Too sweet. A lot of dishes we were excited about were overwhelmingly sweet. We're not sure if it's the way the dish is supposed to be or if one person has a heavy hand with the palm sugar, but it's a bit disappointing. At this point, we've sampled sooo many dishes. A small description of each would take forever The hits and misses worth mentioning: Hits: -RAW SHRIMP SALAD! Spicy limey bright and so refreshing. The toasted rice powder opened my eyes to a whole new world of flavor. By far my favorite. But is really spicy. We always ask for 3/5 spicy, which works well on every dish for us except this one.  'A good alternative is the grilled pork neck salad. It's still delicious, a little more subdued in flavor, and probably more approachable for a wider audience.  -Pad Thai: usually at your run of the mill Americanized Thai places, I drown my pad Thai (and pretty much everything else) in hot sauce, but here, it's a really subdued but balanced delicious dish. Good seasoning, good sweetness, a squeeze of lime and it's a perfect counterbalance to that raw shrimp salad you just blew your palate with.  Misses: -appetizer shu mai: actually the same as the packaged stuff you get at any bad Asian place. Skip.  -crab papaya salad: the brined raw crab in the shell was really unexpected for us, and it was a bit salty and hard to eat. I liked it but bf barely touched it.  Everything else we've gotten, we for the most part enjoy (like chou chee pork, yen ta fo, boat noodles, tiger cry, stir fries, etc), but they aren't mind blowing like other reviews built them up to be. They could have just been too sweet though, so I'm sure we'll get them again and see.

Flavors are spot on for the the salad dishes or ""Yum"" and some of the stir fries. However, certain dishes that I did order makes me doubt whether they were trying to go for authentic Thai or American-Thai flavor route (ie. Tom Yum, Americanized version here). Nevertheless, the chefs here are Thai Aunties so basically the seasoning is based on their expert tongues. The food are sometimes on the salty side, but you can't expect everything to be perfect, right.  One comment that I would like the restaurant to address is the the pricing/portion to some of the more authentic dishes which I've ordered off of the Thai written menu. The amount of food or the price of the ingredients does not match proportionately to the selling price. It makes me feel like I'm getting ripped off for some of the dishes when in fact other ""Thai for Thai"" restaurants are offering at a better value.  Dishes that I highly recommend: Grilled Pork's Neck Salad, Thai Holy Basil Leaves Stir Fried with meat, and Salted Fish Fried Rice.

First of all, calling in my order was an ease.  I was able to communicate with the person on the phone and he answered my questions/offered suggestions. i ordered the panang curry with tofu, extra spicy as i always do. I was asked to rank spice level 1(least spicy)-5(most spicy) and i did a 3. THEY ARE NOT JOKING ON THE SPICINESS. i'm south asian and thought my years of spice training could handle it (totally my fault for assuming).  Next time i may stick with a '1' on the extra spice, but what flavors i could make out, were tasty. The dude man ordered a classic in pad thai.  He liked it more than most other pad thai's he's tried in the city, but his complaint was that it was a little 'dry'. Next time, i'll just ask if they can make it with more sauce and hopefully that should solve the issue.",0.938,0.867,0.103,0.03,0.37488193624557264

Sweet and salty. - Arroy Noodles (BBQ pork) /  Bamee Noodles (BBQ pork) - these two appear to be the same dish with different noodles. Both have a sweet sauce, BBQ pork and ground peanuts at the forefront. The main difference are the noodles (Arroy comes with thin rice noodles - my preference, and Bamee comes with egg noodles). Arroy is a plum sauce, Bamee is non distinct - a little sweeter than Pad Thai.

The sausage combination was interesting. It came with four sausages and half of it was spicy. The spicy ones had a good kick with shredded garlic stuffed inside. The phrik khing mu kwrap is fatty, crispy pork with string beans. The contents were soaked in oil but it was tasty and mildly spicy. The least favorite dish goes to green curry bamboo with pork.

The papaya salad was the only thing I enjoyed that night but it was a bit too apicy for me (in which I understand was my fault). The Tiger crying was very disappointing. Even though the beef was riddled with grill marks you can't really tell when you eat it. It also lacked in flavor. We ordered a pad kee mao and my boyfriend ordered a char siu vermicelli dish. The pad kee mao was very one note and paled in comparison to other restaurants. My boy friend didn't enjoy his dish either as they overused the char siu seasoning so his dish camw out sweet really sweet. (And he's usually not picky at all) I was planning on rating this place three stars and then I bit into a slice of beef that practically fell apart in my mouth. (Not in a good way like kobe beef) Luckily I waited until today to rate it because I ended up with really bad bowel movements ( yes, girls poop too)",0.9406,0.824,0.116,0.06,0.5140476190476191

2013-09-02,4.0,"Aroy Thai was my go to Thai restaurant when I first moved to Chicago, largely because it was right around the corner from my apartment, so it was easy to grab a quick and tasty meal to go. I stopped ordering from Aroy a couple of years ago when I moved to a new apartment and no longer lived around the corner. Yesterday, I recently ordered delivery from Aroy, and I don't know why I ever stopped eating here. The food was fantastic. It was fresh and flavorful and everything I remembered it to be. If you want some crispy, delicious, fried starters to your meal, then I recommend the pot stickers, which are incredibly tasty and filled with a combination of chicken and vegetables. The dipping sauce they come with is perfectly sweet and thick. I also like the egg rolls, but I find that they are sometimes a bit too greasy. I'm not much of a fan or their crab rangoon as there is far more celery than I personally care for. As for entrees, I'm a fan of the pad kee mao, which I find has a nice, balanced flavor with just the right amount of heat. The ratio of noodles to meat to egg to vegetable is spot on, and I love the greens used in place of what seems to be the standard broccoli. Also the duck and rice is great - super simple but also super flavorful. Their tradition, ""Thai Classics"" part of the menu is also pretty amazing, if you want some a bit more authentic than you'll usually find on menus in Chicago. Delivery didn't take too long (I was quoted an hour, and my food arrived in about 40 minutes, which seems pretty much on par with other Thai places I order from), but I do wish they would lower their minimum needed for delivery. A $20 minimum for delivery is a little on the high side, meaning those of us who are ordering for only ourselves have to order several meals worth of food in order to get our Thai food fix.",0.9957,0.786,0.182,0.032,0.5780899588216661

2013-04-28,4.0,"I'm really glad that I discovered North Center and Lincoln Square. It used to be that I would lament the lack of acceptable Thai options in Chicago; now that I know they're all hiding up north, I weep no more. Aroy Thai definitely fits the mold for authentic, well-priced BYOB Asian food that characterizes this neighborhood.  Lemongrass larb ($8) comes with minced chicken, lots of sliced lemongrass and cilantro, and a piquant, fiery dressing. It smells is a little unusual (which I'm guessing is due to the copious amount of fish sauce in the dressing), but the awesome flavor more than drowns that out. It's a good idea to order this with a side of sticky rice ($1.50) to soak up the juices. Crispy basil pork with preserved duck eggs ($12) is a fascinating dish; the fatty crunch of the deep-fried pork is balanced well by fragrant basil, the rich yolks of the preserved duck eggs, and of course, a lot of heat. Surprisingly, my favorite dish of the night was the crab fried rice ($9), which packs almost no spice at all. It is, however, saturated with fresh, sweet crab meat, tons of Chinese broccoli, as well as the traditional eggs and tamarind sauce.  Pricing is very low, especially considering the gargantuan portions. My girlfriend and I usually need to split 2 entrees and an app at dinner, but we probably would have filled up on any one of the three dishes we ordered (including the Larb, which was ginormous). Service is friendly, and the restaurant is small but beautiful. All in all, Aroy is yet another Thai gem on the far North side. It's well worth a trek!",0.9914,0.75,0.183,0.067,0.62546875

We had to ask THREE times for the warm water and we still never got it in the end!! There was only ONE server in the restaurant at that time. Hence, my parents were forced to drink the cold water. The food was very salty and the waitress did not fill up our glasses of water at all until it was gone. I have never had service this horrible before except in Chinatown.

2012-01-31,4.0,"My Thai friend tells me that the food reminded her of home, and you know what? It's true, the food did remind me of home... even though home isn't Thailand for me. It reminded me of my mom's cooking (Chinese and Vietnamese, not Thai; I don't think she'd know how).  We started off with a plate of fish cakes. Delicious!  Then we had a plate of egg rolls; these were okay, I've had better ones. They certainly reminded me of the egg rolls I've had at temples though. That was the home-y feel of this plate. We ordered two different soups. The first one was the Bangkok Beef soup. It tasted similar to the Vietnamese canh chua soup, but with beef. I suspect that they might have used tamarind for the soup base, just like the canh chua. On the other hand, I also thought I tasted nuoc mam (fish sauce) in there. It was weirdly fishy for me. I didn't particularly like or dislike it. I only wished that they hadn't cut the lemongrass so small because I nearly choked on it.  Then we had the tofu and vegetable soup. It tasted similarly to a wanton soup (but without the wantons). It was more bland than the Bangkok Beef soup. My friend ordered this for me because I had food poisoning a few days earlier so she ordered non-spicy things for me.  She also ordered chicken wings for us, but I didn't try any because I didn't think my stomach could handle it. One of my foodie friends loved it though, so I trust his taste. I'll have to go back and try some for myself. There was also a seafood curry dish that I didn't try because I'm allergic to shellfish. Normally I'd eat it anyway, but in my weak state of mind that night, I didn't dare to. Too bad because it looked soooo delicious. Then I heard that they have the best pad thai. Unfortunately, I also didn't try this dish. The color though, was reminiscent of a good pad thai. It wasn't overly orangey as in most places in Chicago.  if you follow my reviews, you'll know that I'm not fond of many Thai places in Chicago because they can't compare to the Bay Area.

Also, with Thai dishes, the cooks do not get offended when you ask them to make it a particular way. That's how it is when you go to Thailand also. For example, with the papaya salad, I always order it medium spicy, not too sweet, and more on the salty and sour side. They can customize orders for you.

My first time here,  my roommate and I split the crab rangoon, larb khun (from the Thai menu) and Aroy noodle (from the regular menu). The waitress recommended the larb khun, a bold move since it's a mix of minced pork and offal (google it if you're not aware), but it was wonderfully spiced and tasty - I just avoided the bigger pieces of offal. Their crab rangoon is not my favorite, but probably the healthiest version of this dish you could have - Aroy's version has large chunks of celery which throws off the cream cheese ratio a bit too much for me.

I worked for a few months near Chiang Rai in college and loved the contrast of northern cuisine to the south, so we decided to check out some of those dishes. We started off however with the quintessential American Thai restaurant app--the spring rolls. The rolls were pretty good but the sauce was gloppy and thick for my taste. Next was the som tom with fermented crab which is common street food in the north. I was  vegetarian while in Thailand and so I hadn't tried this version. Not a huge fan of the fishy taste, but it's an acquired taste so that's not their fault! I did miss peanuts and tomatoes in the salad though. For an entree we split the spicy catfish on the northern Thai menu. We ordered it very spicy, and it certainly was! It had a delightful flavor and was smothered in fresh lemongrass and kaffir lime leaf and chiles. Really herbal and delicious. Will definitely order again. The service was very sweet and attentive--our waters will duly filled every time they came by our table as we sweated our way through the delish curry.

If chickens could talk they would ask that they be Aroy Thai chickens after death.  ALSO,  I could literally drink the peanut sauce all by itself, it's that good. Fried Shu Mai Appetizer -  This is a great shrimp dumpling treat.  A must try for the shrimp lovers.   Pineapple Chicken fried Rice - Love the roasted cashew nuts and pineapple inside the rice, mates well with the chicken...Delicious stuff....Try it !     Pad Thai -  LOVE their Pad Thai.  I usually get mine with chicken. I like ordering mine with extra pad Thai sauce also, not because it is lacking, I just love their sauce folks...DEE-LiSH-US. Garlic Chicken -  Great garlic flavor with actual pieces of garlic in the broth on the bottom of the plate.  Goes great with the white rice.  Love It!

We waited for our waitress to deal with those people before we were served / get our food / get our checks / get take out boxes. The food was disgusting. I think that this place has one of the worst Lard Nar I've ever tasted in Chicago. Summary of the Lard Nar was that it came in a bowl which the entire dish was submerged in their sauce. I understand that Lard Nar has lots of sauce, but it's not a soup based dish. The other dish we had was the Panang Curry. That dish came in a plate which was way too small to eat any curry on. It tasted alright but if you are unable to mix curry powder with some coconut milk, then you probably shouldn't open a Thai restaurant.

Personally don't think the som tum here is that great however they do have one of my favorite som tum with salty egg.  If you are a fan of tom yum you should definitely try tom sabb with pork ribs.  It's spicy and sour it may be a little pungent for some, but the lemon-grass with Thai chili combination do I need to say more?  Other salad includes namtok liver or namtok pork shoulder both are extremely pleasant however they might be on the salty or spicy side so please do tell your server how you like it.  The pad see eww and pad thai are good, but if you want to try something new have pad thai with glass noodle (woon sen) it's a new kind of texture similar to that of japchae (korean cellophane noodle).   As for the entree here two dishes are strongly recommended ka moo pahd kra paow (ham hock stir friend with basil).  Just imagine schweinshaxe in a Thai basil stir-fry (yea I know it's a bit on the greasy side, but come on, everyone likes bacon!!!) On the lean side I will say order the nor mai nam prik noom (stir fried bamboo shoots with green chili paste) it's on the spicy side, but it's definitely lean and flavorful.   Most importantly even the Consul General of Thailand suggested the restaurant to the 'Hungry Hound'!!!

And I do not kid you when I say do NOT go here and this restaurant MUST CLOSE. Where to begin...  The Service was horrible. Waiter was a yutz and didn't know how to take orders from a large table of 8 people. Two items that were ordered never came out (and weren't on the bill luckily). The entrees came out in a 15 minute stagger. We had to specifically ask the waiters twice about 2 entrees that didn't show up with everyone else's. And there were plenty of rookie serving mistakes, such as not cleaning appetizer plates, refilling water, etc. The Food was absolutely disgusting. First the ground chicken salad had to be sent back because it literally smelled like shit. Next, we discovered PLASTIC in not one but TWO of the entrees! One was tiny like paper-shredder size, and the other was a full inch triangle like cutting the corner off a package. We made the manager aware who of course apologized, but come on you're running a restaurant. I personally got an upset stomach from the duck bomee noodles (overcooked egg noodles and odd taste), but did actually enjoy some of the appetizers like thai wings and pot stickers. I tried other dishes at the table and many were bland. Bad Service. Bad Food. Is there anything else to a restaurant? The manager did give us a discount on the bill for the unpleasant experience but it doesn't make up for it.

2009-06-15,4.0,"I had a huge, special lunch here. My father and his friends were visiting me, and his high school friend and wife lived in the area. They took us to Aroy Thai. I asked them, ""what makes Aroy Thai different from the thousands of Thai restaurants in Chicago""? They tell me, ""It's the most authentic"". I believe it. The first indication of authenticity is always praise and patronage from within the culture. The second indication is alternate menus (often not in English) created for those customers. Well, at Aroy Thai, my group consisted of five ravenous Thais and a menu featuring country and comfort food-style Thai dishes.  Unfortunately, the dishes that I loved very much as a child were not vegetarian friendly. This review is not about this though, but the authenticity of the restaurant. (Fear not, fellow vegetarians, Aroy Thai can omit fish and oyster sauce upon request.)  I can't remember everything my group ordered, but here's the definitive list: Som Tum Thai (Papaya Salad), Tom Yum (Lemongrass Soup), Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodles), Larb Gai (Spicy Ground Chicken), Peek Gai Tod (Thai-style Fried Chicken), Sai Oua (Northern Thai Sausage), Neuw Dad Diew (Deep-fried Beef), Ka Neow Ma Meung (Sticky Rice). That is a TON of food, Whew! Everyone, except me, was able to finish eating all of it. The vegetarian dishes I had were average. The Tom Yum Tofu soup was good, but not spicy or fragrant enough. The silken tofu was a nice touch. The Pad Kee Mao Tofu was too sweet, but a splash of vinegar and hot sauce toned it down. The Som Tum Thai was tasty. I love the texture of shredded unripened papaya and the tangyness of lime juice. The wife of my father's friend told me several times that Aroy Thai's Pad Thai is really amazing, and be made without fish sauce. I must return to try it. (I admit, I really missed Sai Oua. It was one of my favorite dishes growing up. I never thought about ""giving in"" though. I can't stand pork now.) Aroy Thai had dishes my mother used to make for my younger sisters and me and at Thai parties. The best food in Thailand is found at street vendors or at home. ""Everyday"" Thai food isn't glamorous. It's simple, filling, but flavorful. Thus, Aroy Thai should be commended for serving both ""homely"" and traditional dishes. Let me note that ""Aroy"" means ""Delicious"" in Thai. To have a name meaning ""Delicious Thai"", the restaurant should have very high standards. Aroy Thai may not be my favorite Thai restaurant, it is certainly a good one.

My girlfriend liked her panang curry but they used silken tofu that wasn't fried or anything so it had a kind of slippery, gooey texture. My tofu in my dish was fried and stood up more as a meat replacement, texture-wise. Dee-lish!  Oh, they played horrible satellite radio. Like jazz covers of The Way We Were. Really loudly.

The prices are quite reasonable here, and the staff is friendly too.",0.9583,0.757,0.201,0.042,0.5394444444444445
2007-03-31,5.0,"I was craving some chicken wings and this is the only place I'll ever come for a fix! Their chicken wings are HUGE and crispy and fried and delicious and the sauce is wonderful. Spicy sweet goodness all around. The crab rangoon is also very good as well as the pad woon sen, panang, and curry. Everything was yummy, my water was always filled and the prices can't be beat.

2007-03-14,5.0,"Every review about this place so far, no matter how noble and properly-starred, has been useless. Notably:  1) ""I would give it five stars, but Cozy Noodles and Rice in Evanston is far better."" ** better how? better why? does Cozy Noodle and Rice make their in-house fish-balls? does Cozy Noodle and Rice make ""modern fusion"" (and don't get me wrong, this doesn't mean PAN-Asian, simply ""avant garde"") Thai that the hip college kids in Bangkok eat?  2) ""not quite as authentic tasting as Siam Country"" ** this family FLIES in Thai spices unavail to this country. case in point: the house cooked pork laap special 3) ""I've only eaten egg rolls here carryout (dozens of times)"" ** right! and I only order pierogies at a sushi joint.  4) ""Nothing special about the space itself"" ** who gives a rats butt? Sticky Rice looks like a Burger King. Rosded looks like it was lifted out of living hell. TAC is uptown hipster gone amuck. Our Menu the other nite: apps: kai thawt: with the extra spicy dipping sauce. i bit into a thigh, and the meat juices hit a dude in the face. it was THAT juicy. apps with sticky rice: sup naw mai: slightly sour bamboo salad w/ roasted rice powder sai krawk with red curry powder: not your mom's Issan sausage naam tok with perfectly grilled pork neck: significantly better than the normal beef version i usually get (with rice powder on top) laap muu with imported spices some type of ""hip"" somtam with preserved duck eggs and raw crab claws. with regular rice: stir fried pickled bamboo shoots: hey, i'm all about the salted bamboo shoots. bring that baby on green curry with house made fish balls with string beans, etc: easily my fave stand by @ Aroy, make sure they have the fish balls on hand before ordering. thai basil ""jerk"" duck: i don't remember having this off the translated menu. someone mentioned it was a ""special special"" cuz it was so deeply fried. interesting take on regular basil duck. tom yam luuk w/ braised beef: the beef (and beef balls) is previously braised w/ star of anise and other spices before placed into the chicken stock/lime juice/lemongrass soup. special request of the nite: braised tendors. 2 types of stir fried Chinese brocolli Thai style: 1 with salted mackerel, the only w/ chicharones. yah.. i dig the pork grinds version about 100x better. note: not a pad see ew, pad thai ANYWHERE near our table. want pad thai? go to Star of Siam with the tourists. Above courses were close to the previous ""Thai Menu"" dinner we had a few months back @ Aroy. The best part? second time around is somehow better than the first time and the first properly ordered properly set meal before Xmas blew my mind. Beyond TAC, beyond Thai Ave, beyond Sticky rice, this place earns a solid 5 stars. The consistency and the level of ""authentic"" ingredients is almost unmatched elsewhere in the city.",0.9974,0.827,0.153,0.02,0.47582142356732526

2007-02-15,4.0,"I thought the chicken satay was pretty good.  My friend ordered the ginger soup, and i had the pad thai.  I thought overall the food was pretty good, but not amazing.  With an appetizer the food was just enought to fill me up.  In this case not having leftovers was fine, but I usually judge portions based on this.  The service was good, but not spectacular, but then again I'm pretty low maintenance so I didn't care... just fill up my water glass more next time.  Reasonably priced, I would go back",0.8955,0.736,0.199,0.065,0.5705882352941177

2006-12-03,4.0,"I've been here a handful of times, sometimes grabbing some takeout, and each was a tiny blessing!  They're slightly better than the Siam Country across the street, and their curry is something to behold. But if you really want to enjoy the experience, eat in the restaurant.  Like most good Thai places, they are in a relatively small building, so expect frequent visits from the wait-staff.  As some kind of twisted tradition, I always sample the curry at Thai establishments, and this one is definitely worth a visit! Best of all, the prices are average, so don't expect to break the bank for a pleasurable meal.  They're so close to the Damen brown-line stop, you could spit on their roof, so head there out of the cold and warm up with some spicy Thai! I would give it five stars, but Cozy Noodles and Rice in Evanston is far better.",0.9553,0.83,0.16,0.01,0.5583333333333333
2006-11-06,5.0,Service that's fast and friendly with food that's incredible. The Chicken Satay is tender and amazingly flavorful and the Pad Woon Sen (one of my favorites) is always wonderfully balanced and full of flavor.
