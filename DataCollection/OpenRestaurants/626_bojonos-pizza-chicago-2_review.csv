They told my BF that they do not deliver to our place, even though we checked with them and confirmed that we were within their delivery zone. The employee on the phone refused to place the order and called my boyfriend a b**** and told him to f* off- in Spanish. My BF told them he speaks some Spanish and is aware of what they said, and they hung up. Ridiculous.

Fresh mozzarella is $4 for 8 ounces at Jewel, enough for a 16"" pizza. This is really ketchup on some dough with the cheapest ingredients available. Makes you feel sick after trying to eat it.

The woman on the phone had the nerve to lie to us saying he did ring the doorbell and she knows because she was in the car with him. Total lie because after the call was finished I went out and tested the buzzer at the gate and the one to the entrance to our building. My roommate confirmed both worked perfectly fine. It makes a very LOUD buzz and is impossible to miss, I always half-jump out of my seat startled when someone pushes it. We received a refund from Groupon.

We decided on the BBQ chicken pizza which was superb. Huge chicken chunks accompanied some of the sweetest and fresh Bermuda onions on top. The onions were also in thin and stringy on top which gave the pizza a nice textural crunch on top as well. Too often other joints dice their white onions into minuscule cubes which lose that sweet crunch effect.

It happened accidentally when I attended an after-work function (the kind I abhor!) and since it was dinner time, I decided to imbibe in this pizza that was still in the boxes.  I was shocked. I looked at it and it looked like the Sicilian and Napolitano pizza of my youth in a Midwestern town, and it actually tasted like it too. A little yeast in the dough, then a crunch with a little softness and then the cheese. It was the perfect combo. It is all personal taste of course, and many people like a thick crust pizza. But I am in heaven now that I have found my favorite pizza, Bo Jonos. They make everything from scratch!! Even their sausage.

The times I crave or want pizza are extremely rare and when I do there's only specific places I will go to. Seriously, forget about the whole Chicago/NYC pizza debate. New England beach pizza is where its at. Semisweet sauce, thin crust, and conservatively sprinkled cheese is the way to go! With that being said, I came across a craving this week and I really just wanted some good old fashioned thin crust.  Now I've lived in Buena Park for about a year now, a block from Bonjono's, and have never tried it. I can smell it as a walk by and it smells pretty decent. I caved into my craving, called them up, and ordered a medium thin crust with no toppings. It smelled amazing on the walk home and when I got home I went in! This is pizza is almost as good as the ones back home! Bonjono might be my new place since its so close. I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for two factors. First, when i called to place the order the woman on the phone was extremely rude. Then to make matters worse, when I there the two girls behind the counter took about 5 minutes before helping me. I was the only person in there and they were just talking to each other in Spanish, ignoring me. Secondly, I did not like how liberal they were with the cheese. The crust was delicious, mainly because the closer you go to it, the less cheese there was. It was just a little overpowering for me. Prices were good. I paid $15 for the medium, including tax.
