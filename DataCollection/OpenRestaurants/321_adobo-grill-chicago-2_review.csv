2017-09-03,3.0,The food was good but the service was SO slow. Took about 15 minutes to get more chips. There is a somewhat limited menu but I got the fish tacos which were really good. Multiple requests were made for drink refills and other misc. requests and all requests took FOREVER. The server didn't seem too interested in serving our table.

I ordered an Adobo Margarita with a Smokey Floater, which is a side shot of mezcal. After that I had a Pisco Sour. They were both very good and I would definitely get them again if they were a litter cheaper.  Also, I wouldn't want to come if it were very crowded, because the bathroom is a tiny little closet with one stall and one urinal. I felt cramped even when I was the only one in there.

2017-08-06,2.0,"Slow service. Uninspired food. Extra for ice. We used to like Adobo but our visit last night was really disappointing.  We were happy that their famous guacamole is still GREAT.  It fell apart from there.  We went early on Saturday before it got crowded but busy enough that the patio was full.  It took 10 minutes before anyone came to our table to say hello or take a drink order. I ordered tequila on the rocks with lemon and lime wedges.  We of course had the guac.  Drinks came and my tequila was in a mini snifter with a lime.  My companion's margarita was shaken table side and presented in a martini glass.  I asked the waiter to put my drink in a larger glass with ice, lemon and lime and he obliged without a word.  Guacamole and drinks done, we had to find our waiter to place our dinner order, because he had never come back to check on us or to take our order.  I ordered the chicken tacos, no cheese.  My next drink was delivered as ordered.  The chicken tacos came and they were the saddest looking tacos I've ever seen.  3 corn tortillas spread out on the plate, 3 pieces of chicken breast, 3 slices of breaded avocado, and some crispy chipotle, oh and the cheese I asked NOT to be included was melted over the top.  No lettuce, tomato, sauce, nothing.  It was like they were scrimping on extras to save pennies.  The dollop of rice was not even worth a mention.  I scraped off the cheese (not worth hunting down the waiter, who again was nowhere to be found).  Flavor was good, but nothing special.  My theory about scrimping for pennies was confirmed when the bill came.  I was charged $1.50 for the ""rocks"" for my tequila.  Mind you not a sphere of ice, not a large cube--nope.  Just the same small-cube ice used to shake the margaritas.  I don't recall seeing a note on the drink menu about ice costing extra and the waiter never said ice is extra (probably too embarrassed.)  This is not a mixology kind of place and the food is on par with a fast food Mexican take out.  They are confused about who and what they are.",-0.058,0.853,0.068,0.079,0.48880471380471374

Fast forward to last Friday, we returned for a pre- show dinner and we sampled 3 different dishes high were equally delicious! I tried the Mimosa and can attest to the fact that they make great cocktails here.  My recommendation is try it all as they have a great chef , small portion sizes which I like as I prefer quantity over quality and an amazing bar tender.

The breaded avocado gave a nice texture to the dish. Their tortilla are house-made but got a little soggy by the time I had the second taco. I also tried one of their cocktails that had watermelon infused corazon blanco, fresh watermelon juice, and gran torres. Very refreshing! Their guac is made table side so that was fun to watch. The food was overall fine, not somewhere I'm dying to come back to. There are lots of other places that serve a bit more authentic Mexican food for cheaper.

It quickly became 9:40 and they still had yet to provide an estimate of how much longer it would be and continued to blame a large group that had already paid and was not leaving yet.  1) Don't blame your paying patrons who have every right to sit for as long as they should please at your restaurant. Blame your staff for not appropriately handling a RESERVATION and RESERVING a table for the requested time. 2) If you are backed up, fine. But give us a ""time estimate""!!

SORRY for making reservations, 5 days in advance, and expecting you to have our table ready by then.......act like you care and feel bad for us. Take that cranky look off your face and put on a happy hospitality face. 4) Let us at least order some drinks at the bar or HECK, give us some for free for our inconvenience! But yes, that's right, they would NOT allow us to even order a drink from the bar and stand there in the isle (in the way of everyone because they did not guide our group of 6 to a better place to wait). 5) OFFER US SOMETHING!!

I order a margarita and my friends order a pineapple margarita and some other tropical drink. They bring martini glasses and then shake the margaritas at your table. The martini glass is an odd choice for a margarita and it was extremely salty.  Drinks aside, we ordered tacos. I got the al pastor tacos which were very tender and good. My friends tried the shrimp tacos, also very good, and the chicken tacos, not very good. For $15 I have never seen such small portions of chicken on a taco. Honestly looked like one chicken nugget on a tortilla.  The tacos are served with the most flavorless rice. It is unfortunate that they do not left you mix and match the tacos.

Make sure to ask for the habanero salsa.  It really isn't that much hotter than their standard salsa that comes with the chips but does provide a slight sweetness for whatever you're eating.   We also ordered the Bloody Maria, their playful take on the Bloody Mary.  The tequila instead of vodka really makes it taste...different.  I know, I know.  I knew what was in it when I ordered it but it just didn't mix too well with the meal.  I felt like it needed more salt or spices.  It tastes like light V8 with tequila.",0.9776,0.793,0.172,0.034,0.5189814814814814

Definitely worth trying out.  My friend has several food allergies, and the waiters and chef accommodated very well. Although we were disappointed to hear that most items on the list are already marinated in vegetable oil (which contains one of her allergies: soybean oil). She had wanted to order the shirt steak, but there was no way to prepare it because of the marinade.  The rotating salsa was a peanut salsa. My friend also has a peanut allergy and this was very dangerous. We would recommend asking the guests if they would like regular salsa or peanut salsa so that it is not automatically given at the beginning. Thankfully she did not try the salsa until we found out that it contained an allergen.  The first time I came here, the guacamole was prepared right in front of my eyes. So cool!

The woman asked us which ingredients we wanted in the guacamole, and she made it right then and there - the guacamole is set in the mortar at the table with tortilla chips.  I thought it was really delicious, as it was very fresh and creamy, with the fresh onions, the well-ripened avocado, and the bit of salt and lemon/lime juice.  The slightly-salted tortilla chips were a great complement.  I tried their Chicken Enchiladas for my entree, and these were basted in mole coloradito, topped with sour cream, cheese, onions, and served with a side of refried black beans. This dish was a little underwhelming, as the enchiladas had more of a scrambled eggs-like texture; overall, it was very bland.  I did like the refried beans, though!  For dessert, we had the crepes, which were stuffed with roasted plantains, cajeta, and vanilla ice cream.

The pork with dark mole was excellent, not over cooked, very tender. However, the rice that came with the pork was tasteless, the garlic spinach wasn't garlicky, and the corn tamal that the excellent server brought when he sensed I wasn't impressed with my sides, was pasty.

Don't act surprised, when you go out to eat it costs a little bit more!   Chips and salsa are free.  You just have to ask. Life lessons here peeps. ...Next the appetizers are quite filling - almost a small meal size for lighter eaters!  Margaritas do not cost $13 whoever said that. Let's learn how to read a menu?  Tequila lovers, there is a huge list of 100% agave tequilas starting from around $7 and you can customize your own drink or take it neat!!  Finally on cost, this is downtown Chicago.  end of story. To the complainers about service. That's really too bad and I'm sorry to hear about it.  The thing is that  I just can't relate (I relate to the 4 and 5 star yelpers).  My water glass was constantly refilled.  Food was timely but not rushed.  I got my leftovers wrapped up. no problems.  This restaurant was packed - unlike many struggling restaurants.      We know quality ingredients and the effort it takes to make a perfectly cooked pork tenderloin (which mine was) and juicy chicken breast (my husband's was).  The Mexican food here is authentic and delicious!",0.7884,0.824,0.097,0.079,0.5432072829131652

Yes, they spice it up, but there is not a lot of flavor. Wine is a minimum of $8.75, guacamole is $9.00, and a small margarita is $13.  I would not recommend Adobo Grill.

The vegetable tacos were fabulous (quinoa and goat cheese is always great!); the sangria had a little bit of a tequila aftertaste, but after the second glass, it was just fine. ;) My in-laws were with us, and they were very accommodating for their non-dairy and non-spicy requests. My husband and I found plenty of spicy yumminess for our taste. The guacamole is made to order and great; the quantity was a bit smaller than what I'm used to for tableside guac at a restaurant (esp. split between four people), but there was plenty of other food to stuff in my face.

The guacamole is made tableside, which is always a cool experience. It's also quite large and served with a side of chips. The gorditas are delicious fat little tortillas filled with pulled pork and other tasty things. I'm obsessed, they're fantastic. Plus, they're about half the price of the tacos and basically the same amount of food!  The margaritas are tasty, but definitely on the weak side. I would have preferred a bit more oomph for the price. I've also had the lomito en ancho, marinated grilled pork tenderloin, but it was unmemorable. Good, but not great by any means. To sum up - The Adobo Grill isn't fine dining by any means, but it is really sold, tasty food with a great atmosphere. I know I'll be back many times.",0.8939,0.793,0.124,0.083,0.513470695970696

It was casual and chill. Our guacamole was on point and we couldn't complain about the free chips and salsa. M enjoyed her margarita and I got some sort of mimosa concoction. The space was sunny and clean. Only a couple of tables were occupied and we enjoyed watching the Olympics on the televisions above the bar. Service was good and not distracting. It was perfect for what we wanted in that moment.

I went with my fiancé for dinner based on the  pictures of the chocolate tamale. This is what we ordered 1 Modelo Negro (beer) 1 Mango Daiquiri  ONE entrée two appetizers and a dessert  for $65!   The high price would have been acceptable if the food wasn't such poor quality and small portion. Out steak dinner that we shared was $20 and the steak came cut into pieces. I suspect they don't give an entire steak and that's why it's cut. I had one tiny piece of steak and my fiancé ate like three little strips and that's all there was. Serious we left and got sandwiches at Mr Submarine! I'm so upset by my experience I feel robbed. One of the appetizers the chicken Flautas were so gross I took one bite and didn't touch them again. The dessert which is what drew us in was nothing great either. The chocolate tamale was cake in a corn husk that wasn't baked all the way through so it tasted like dark chocolate warm powdery thick pudding GROSS!        I'm Cuban and my fiancé is Colombian although our country's cuisine is far different than Mexican we are familiar with what Mexican food should somewhat be like and this was not it.

One thing that was great for us is we had a group of 6 adults and I was able to get a reservation for 7:30 pm when I called at around 6 pm.  It might not be a good thing from their perspective, but for us, it was convenient.  It's a pretty large restaurant inside. Food-wise... it was mixed.  We got a couple of orders for guacamole and that was good.  Of course it was freshly made, but it probably could've used more lemon/lime. For entrees, I had the chile relleno, which was excellent.  The combination of sauce and beans was excellent.  This thing must be like multiple peppers, because there's no way the huge thing was one big pepper.  Anyway, I enjoyed it and could only finish half of it. I also tasted the cheese enchiladas, which were kind of... just OK to meh... Not sure why, but maybe the tortillas were dried out or something?  Unfortunately, this is like my staple usually at Mexican places, so that's a bit discouraging. Margaritas were excellent, although very small in size.  They serve them in these tiny martini glasses, instead of the nice big margarita glasses you'd expect.  There's only one margarita, only one size, so the options are limited.  I mean, they made it well, but with a large group it would've been great to be able to get a pitcher.  This is probably what contributed to our high bill. The service was fine.  Definitely came by a few times and asked for more drinks and so forth.  Overall, I think the prices were high.  Yes, it is in the city and all, but $40 per person seems a bit, though not exorbitant. In the end, I think Adobo is a decent place.  I'd think about it, but I may be back again with family.  It's worth a second shot to see if they can improve on the enchiladas.",0.9961,0.756,0.198,0.045,0.5430555555555556

My boyfriend and I are really laid back when it comes to our anniversary dinners (nothing is ever open on July 4th anyway,) and all we wanted to do was find someplace new to eat. We somehow found ourselves in Old Town and this place caught our eye. We decided to give it a shot. Our waiter was very nice... if not absent for most of the experience. We ordered two 10 dollar margaritas and guacamole to start. The margaritas were tiny. They barely filled a martini glass. We were disappointed but they were tasty so it was all right. I was really excited about the guacamole because the menu advertised that it was 'table side' and I saw this woman with a cart going around and making it fresh right in front of you. Someone came by with chips and I started looking around to see where she was. ...... The waiter came by and plopped a bowl of guacamole down in front of us that had already been made without a word of explanation. Okay. Great. It seemed silly to complain and I was really hungry so we decided to just tuck in. the guacamole was good.... really, really fresh. It was a bit bland but we added salt to it and devoured it.  Next, we ordered entrees. I ordered the Salmon Glazeado and my boyfriend ordered the Arrachera. They both sounded delicious... Wrong. I will say that both the salmon and the flank steak were cooked very well... but that's about it. We both took a bite of our food and looked at each other in confusion. ""I can't taste anything,"" my boyfriend said. I couldn't help but agree.  The glaze on my salmon was this weak, watery, tasteless sort of BBQ stuff. The mash that came with it was gray and lumpy and also tasted like nothing. The steak was just as bland and when we tried to eat it with the onions and peppers that it came with it just made it worse... just different textures of blah-ness. We didn't contemplate sending it back for something else... we just ate what we could, smiled at our waiter and asked for the check. It took a while and by the time it finally got to us we were both shaking with silent laughter about what a terrible choice we made for our anniversary dinner. We gave him our card and started getting ready to leave. To top the evening off, a lady that we had never seen before came over and loudly declared that my boyfriend's credit card was declined. The tables are very close together and the family next to us looked at us pityingly. The (Hostess? Manager? Still don't know who she was...) walked off without another word. My boyfriend, confused, checked his account balance. Plenty of money in his account. Huh. (We later bought both ice cream and many drinks with that same card and had no problems whatsoever.) Instead of trying to find the obviously annoyed woman and ask her to try again we paid with cash and got out of there.  All in all, a pretty bad experience. It'll be a bad anniversary story to tell the kiddies someday.",-0.8716,0.836,0.073,0.091,0.5372972582972584

For example, both at the bar and at the table I had to flag down when I needed another beer after it's been sitting empty rather then them checking in. Couldn't seat us by our reservation time, told us it was going to be a wait even though we had a reservation, and time was of the essence since seeing a show at the UP Comedy club next door.   Food = ehhh, I really wasn't impressed by the flavor or the quality of the dishes we ordered.

The first time I experienced the Tequila dinner was in February and Adobo Grill was celebrating ""Cocina Veracruzana"" along with Tequila Gran Centenario.  The was dinner was seafood based and so delicious.  We started off with Tamal de Calabaza, tasty.  Next we had the MOST delicious Ensalada Asada....an arugula salad with Hanger Steak, red peppers and goat cheese. OMG!  So good.  The main dish was ""Camarones al mojo de ajo"" Grilled marainated shrimp.  Really tasty.  The thing about the Tequila dinners is that each course comes out with a new drink that involves a tequila and you have a choice of 3 tequilas to drink from as well.  So you get three tequila shots, three mixed drinks 4 courses (including a dessert) for 50$.  The food and drinks are so unique.  It is a worthwhile experience. The second time we went to ""Tequila Dinner Night"" was in May.  The theme was ""La Cocina Poblana"".  Of course I'm totally psyched because I have been to Veracruz and Puebla and I can't wait to see what goodies they have prepared for us. ----Chalupas con tinga for the appetizer. -----Tacos arabes...very filling -----Main Course...Fillete Poblano ...cilantro marinated grilled flat iron steak and herb roasted potatoes.  So good but I was stuffed after the Tacos arabes. ---dessert---pastel de camote... Tequilla Arrete was the tequila distributor that night.  The owner of the Tequila Distillery spoke to the crowd about the differences in the tequila and even invited the crowd to visit the distillery in Guadalajara.  One of the tequilas that they sell is called Tequila Don Fulano and he said it's sold at Binny's.

2013-04-07,3.0,"Bleh. I want to give a worse review than this place really deserves, because of my (MUCH better) experience at their other location in Indy. My boyfriend and I were there a month or two ago and stumbled across the Adobo there (which we at first thought was a chain, actually). The food was SO GOOD, it wasn't terribly expensive, and I really liked the decor/setup, not that he particularly cared about any of that. After we were finished eating, I looked it up on my phone, and we were excited to notice that, while not a chain, there was a location back in Chicago, so we made a note to go there sometime soon. Well, sometime soon was yesterday afternoon, and it definitely didn't stand up to our previous experience. We walk in, and I notice that the theme and decorations are all the same - cool. But when we sit down and pick up our menus - our tiny, tiny menus - we were confused. We seriously asked the waiter if we had the brunch menus. It was like they sliced 60-70% of the menu off of what we had in Indy, including the delicious chicken enchiladas I had gotten and been craving ever since. We considered leaving, but we were already there and sitting down, so we just decided to stay and order, which ended up being a decision we probably could have done without. The food was nothing special. It wasn't BAD, it just ... was nowhere near as good as it had been at the other location. (They were also far less attentive with refilling our chips and salsa, for those of you, like us, who look forward to that aspect of Mexican restaurants.) Oh, and apparently they charged us $3.50 for a Sprite. So I'm torn. I know we definitely won't be going back to this location, because the quality of the food doesn't justify the price, at least for us compared to our first experience. But it's really not an objectively bad restaurant, and it is better than some other cheaper/comparable places. I'm going to have to go with three stars, since it wasn't really terrible, but I'll leave you with this - while I wouldn't tell you to NOT go there (unless you've been to the one in Indy, and then I will, because you'll just be disappointed) I would definitely not recommend it over other places you could go.",0.9776,0.842,0.111,0.047,0.48794532627865955

I wouldn't say that it was a bad meal by any means, but for the quality and price there are so many other great Mexican food options in the city (Zocalo, Big Star, Taco Joint, de cero, even the pricier Mercadito) that the next time we are in the mood for tacos this would not be my first choice.",0.8098,0.878,0.075,0.047,0.4109605911330049

2012-11-01,2.0,"This use to be one of my favorite places because it felt fresh and new.  Now I feel like this place is an old dinosaur that just needs to go off in the corner and die.  Personally I would love to see this place get some fresh life and maybe reinvent themselves but it is not happening.  This just makes me sad.  This place use to get me on two things: the Adobo Margarita shaken table side and the table side guacamole.  But even those do not excite me anymore.  A few things concerned me on our visit the other night. 1) The busboy kept filling up our water like we were going to dehydrate.  It was almost annoying but what really bothered me was when he reached across the table to fill my glass, he pressed the bottom of the dirty water pitcher into the top of our Gorditas sitting on the table.  As this was happening, I told him to stop but he kept pouring water and pressing that dirty pitcher into our food.  And when I showed him what he did he looked at me and just walked away.  Honestly I was really grossed out by this.  I am sure that worse things go on in the back but to have it happen right at our table was unacceptable.  He did not even say sorry.  My stomach is just turning, while I relive this moment in print. 2) The table side made guacamole use to be the bomb.  I remember 15 years ago I thought that was the coolest thing ever.  We told our waiter we wanted the Guacamole to be so spicy that we wanted it us to hurt us...he laughed and said no problem.  The Guacamole Girl rolled over the cart and said, ""How would you like your Guacamole?""  Again I said please make it very very hot.  She mixed all of the ingredients and it was completely bland.  There was no hotness at all to it.  Our waiter walked over and said, ""How is it?""  We looked at him and he said, ""It is not spicy at all!""  He then took our bowl away and worked on our Guacamole for 5 minutes in the corner.  I could only see his head above the wall...so he could have just been stirring it.  He returned it to the table and it was still not spicy.  How hard is it to get some spicy Guacamole around here?  So this was another letdown.  In fact, we make better Guacamole at home and we do not have the fancy cart with all of the ingredients to push around the restaurant.  This is suppose to be a Mexican Restaurant please just find something spicy and throw it into my Guacamole.  The waiter also brought us out a spicy habanera salsa, after this but honestly it was tame when compared to what Rick Bayless Habanera salsa is like.  I want to go cry in the corner after eating that stuff but not here.  I could have drank the bowl here at Adobo and asked for another.  Again not hot!!! 3) Our waiter started out like one of those used car salesman.  You know where all he does is try to up sell everything on the menu.  How about an extra floater on your Margarita? Cha-Ching  It is very tiring to have to keep saying no to a waiter that keeps trying to sell you things to raise your bill.  I also find it kind of disrespectful too because I am not some twenty year old kid having dinner for the first time in Old Town! 4) The Adobo Margarita is not that good anymore.  This thing was all lime juice minus the tequila.  What a waste of a drink!  I can walk away and make a better tasting homemade margarita, then the one that was served to me here.  The shaking table side is a cool feature but when you see the waiter walking away with a shaker that still has your drink in it...that is kind of sad.  Yes he filled it up but there was still more drink in there to be poured...that is probably where all my tequila was at. 5) Do not order a kids meal here!!!  This place is suppose to be a restaurant that makes fresh food.  How hard is it to make homemade chicken fingers?  These chicken strips were so processed they were terrible.  And the frozen french fries had so much salt on them they were inedible.  My little one who is 5 said to me in the car after dinner, ""Daddy can we never go back there because those fries were so bad.  I could not even eat them they had so much salt on them!""  When a 5 year old is starting to review a place like Yelp and give it zero stars, then I know it was bad.  I did try the fries and they were terrible unless you wanted to add Heart Disease to your resume. Our family voted and we are done with the Adobo Grill.  This place was one of our favorites but it is in need of a makeover.  I do not think they care because they are in Old Town and next to Second City in a high traffic area.  They are kind of like the Cubs at this time...people go here but the product is last place.  I hope that they turn this thing around, or they will disappear like there Division location did.",-0.9521,0.809,0.092,0.099,0.5015830756545042

2012-10-24,4.0,"I came here a few years ago with some friends, and fondly remember their butternut squash enchiladas. Even though they're no longer on the menu, I couldn't pass up a spectacular Groupon for the restaurant. Starters: Tableside guacamole and the empanadas potosinas. The guac was AMAZING. There was a little confusion, as the lady who was supposed to make our guac ended up making it for the table next to us (who hadn't ordered it yet). But, it wasn't a big deal and she promptly made ours when we requested it. The empandas were good. They were sitting in this amazing tomatillo salsa. Perfectly crispy and cheesy. Entrees: I ordered the Platos Vegetarianos because I was tired of the same old enchiladas. For $16, I was expecting a bit more food. There was a small asparagus and tomato salad to the side, a tiny goat cheese filled zucchini, a normal sided tamale, and one empanada. I could have gotten more food at any other Mexican place for half the price. I guess you pay more for quality. It was delicious, but the portions were just really small. The boy got the Pechuga,  which was adobo marinated roast chicken breast with sautéed chayote, mushrooms, corn, rajas and ancho salsa. He seemed to like it. Desserts: Man oh man, you can't go wrong with the Tres Leches. Unbelievably moist, in a phyllo shell covered in chocolate, strawberries and caramel. I was a happy camper after this. The ambience is good. The tables are a bit packed together, but it wasn't a problem for us. Our server was nice, but seemed a bit flaky. The only times he ever came to our table were when we signaled for him (even to order).",0.9864,0.849,0.13,0.021,0.6052083333333333

2012-10-16,5.0,"I've only been here twice, but I am a huge fan of this place! Both times have been excellent!! Let me break down the why's.  Food: AMAZING MEXICAN FOOD!! I cam here with my boyfriend who is Mexican so he can vouch for the quality and authenticity of it... but even so. I've had my fair share of Mexican food (living in Pomona, California and the random cruise trips to Mexico) and I was having a blast. The guacamole is very very good... (my bf still makes it better) but I would definitely come here for my fix :) Also, they have this awesome margarita that is shaken into a martini glass with a easy brim of salt and a small chunk of floating lime. It's not overwhelming, the alcohol taste doesn't make you wanna pass out, and the balance is a perfect blend between sweet and salty. I love this drink and I don't even like margaritas. Must have!! Btw... they don't have the typical Mexican food like burritos... it's more upscale gourmet Mexican food so if you're looking for something basic, you'd best go to Taco bell or Chipotle.  Service: Very friendly, and helpful. Ask them anything, they'll give you their honest opinion on what you should order. Also, they are funny guys! That's a plus.  Ambience: Cool, cultural, earthy, slightly dark, and bustling. At least it was when I was there... and it was a random weekday night.  Price: Honestly, more than I want to pay. Appetizers are like $8-$12, and dishes can range from $13-$20. But it's okay. Quality is important to me :) Other notes:  - The second time I came here was because I found a groupon $40 for $20, and I was ecstatic because I already love this place. Look for deals if you want to try this place! - They also have a LONNNNNNG list of different types of tequilas so I imagine the bar scene can be pretty busy if you want to try them all... but yeah I've never done this so just FYI for you drunkards. - They also have certain nights where you can get a prix fixe menu and try their different tequila drinks (I think it's like $30 or $40 per person?

2012-07-29,1.0,"My mom and sister were visiting Chicago from Indiana for our annual girls weekend, and I decided we should try Adobo because there is one in Indianapolis and if they liked the one here, they could go to the one in Indy sometime. The reason we went was because I'd heard the guacamole was great -which it was. The margaritas were great too. Our waiter was excellent. Very friendly and professional. Unfortunately, this is where the positives end.  The food was really bad. Really, really bad. I ordered the smoked trout tacquitos-it was on the specials menu. I shared it with the rest of the table to make sure I wasn't crazy, and consensus was that it was like eating cold canned cat food on a tortilla chip. I don't know how they can serve that dish and think it's acceptable. It was seriously gross.  My mom ordered the pollo tamarindo. It was very bland and tasteless.

2012-07-27,3.0,"Went here for a tequila tasting dinner last night. A breakdown of the good and the bad: Good: Restaurant atmosphere is pretty high-end for a Mexican joint. Also, their patio seemed like a nice place to eat, though we did not sit out there. Food was exceptional. Granted, our food was not on the normal menu so take that with a grain of salt. We had 4 courses, each one was better than the last. Two of our group members ordered from of the menu and seemed to like their food equally as well. Bad: Service. It was abysmal. Since two of our members were not eating the planned meals, they needed separate menus. Not only did this take at least 15 minutes, but they kept screwing it up throughout the night--bringing them food that wasn't theirs. Additionally, I wanted a beer. None of the many waiters asked anyone at our table if there was anything else we needed. Now, the tequila tasting dinner did come with quite a few drinks... but it's still the waiters' jobs to make sure that customers are happy. So, after a few attempts at flagging a waiter down, I got my beer. Finally, to add insult to injury--mandatory 20% gratuity.  All in all, I recommend the tequila tasting. It was a cool experience and the food was exceptional. Our tequila was Jose Cuervo, and the ambassador was both interesting and knowledgeable. We were served 3 specialty mixed drinks, and 4 half-shots of different tequilas. Don't expect to leave drunk, but you will learn something about tequila!

But the noise is a good noise, not annoying at all.  I don't know why, but it just IS!   Yes, the margaritas are TOPS! They're well made, not rushed.  They don't overdue the mix, and there's the right amount of tequila in it!  Our waiter shamelessly flirted with my date, shaking the shaker of margaritas and making a dance out of it, and bumping is ""dupa"" against her...he was playful and friendly.  One could tell he loved what he does and I bet he gets at least 3 numbers a night from girls (thankfully not from my date!).   The guacamole is the best I've EVER had. I know, I know, how can you screw up guac, right?  This was exceptional. It was creamy, the perfectly ripened avocados, there was just the right amount of cilantro and tomatoes etc...in it.   Their food is fresh, the meat is seasoned perfectly, and served hot off the grill.  Don't forget to ask for a lime if you order tacos.  It makes a difference!  The Chile Relleno is fantastically unique!  SO worth getting! This is just a fun night out.  Even if you do nothing else in the evening, go to Adobo Grill and save Second City for another night.  You'll want to remember this place.  And in the summer, to sit outside on Wells and watch the people go by, well...that's a treat!  This place has got everything going for it!

(forget Giordano's and Hot Doug's...)  First rule at Adobo Grill: ALWAYS ORDER THE GUACAMOLE (only exception is if you're allergic to avocados).  Being a connoisseur of Mexican food, I have tried countless samples of guacamole (even in Mexico) and none compare to Adobo's.  It is out-of-this-world sublime.  The chefs make it table-side, so you know it's fresh, and it's awesome to watch.  They mix the perfect amount of ingredients to make a guacamole that will make you want to order seconds (and possibly thirds).  Careful, it's addictive.  My favorite dish, is definitely the ""Sabultes de Pollo"" (Little tostadas), they're considered an appetizer, but they're super filling and mouth-watering DELICIOUS.  When I go with my mom and brother (both are vegetarians) they usually order the ""Plato Vegetariano"" which has generous samplings of vegetarian food (i.e. Plantain crusted lentil cake with salsa verde; roasted butternut squash & chipotle salsa; baked potato skin stuffed with veggies; grilled vegetable timbale with creamy spinach) or the Veggie Enchiladas, which are super yummy and flavorful.  For the very hungry people, I definitely recommend the ""Pollo al Tamarindo"".  The tamarind-chipotle sauce is literally finger-licking delicious, and the portions are generous.   TIP: Save room for dessert! The chocolate tamale will take you chocolate heaven. In conclusion, Adobo Grill is the best restaurant in Chicago.",0.998,0.755,0.241,0.004,0.6717836257309943

When I got there at 8:30 the hostess apologized that they didn't have our table yet and asked us to wait. No problem. After about 20 minutes, I was getting antsy, especially since we kept seeing people come in after us being seated. Even large parties. So at 9, after waiting 30 minutes unacknowledged, I went to the hostess and asked if we were close and they said ""oh, there is a table right there for 4 (point to a table right in between the bar and hostess stand), you can go sit there."" I am not sure if I would have continue to wait whether they would have shown us to that table.  At about 9:20, someone finally stopped to take our orders. At any rate, we were very excited to try the tableside guacamole, hearing about how awesome it is. It was good. Definitely the best thing we had. They were out of several items on the prix fixe menu (including the one thing I was really craving - churos.) The rest of the meal was unimpressive.   We had a show to catch at Second City so when it was 10:30 and we didn't have our dessert yet and we were getting nervous. Meanwhile, a wet spot at the end of the bar resulted in 2 wait staff (a waiter and the hostess) literally running into one of the people at our table on two separate occasions. After the second person fell, they decided to wipe up the wet spot.  At 10:40 when they brought our dessert we had to decline saying we needed to pay the bill and get to our show. They 1) blamed one of the people at our table for being a slow eater (that is absolutely unacceptable, btw, the customer is always right. especially when it was YOUR fault we didn't get seated on time, we didn't get waited on for quite a while and the entrees were slow), 2) they continued to charge us for the dessert we couldn't eat and 3) made no apology for the fact that the slow services was the result of our almost being late to the show. I REALLY want to like Adobo, and I might go back again, but it was disappointing. Having reservations at 8:30 should mean you are in the clear to having a full meal and being out in 2 hours.

The service was slow., until it came time for the check  Our server was pretty much non existent most of the time.  The Sangria was nothing special and pretty sweet.  I've certainly had much better.  I had the empanadas and my husband had the tamales.  The sauces on each were good, but the actual dishes themselves were again just fair.  For an entree, I had the pork tenderloin in mole negro and my husband had the salmon.  Again, the sauces were good but everything else was just ""meh"",  The pork was medium rare on the verge of rare.  Unfortunately there wasn't really anyone to address this with.  My dessert was really odd.  It was a gooey crumbled raw cake in hot fudge sauce.   Bottom line, if you're going to Second City and really want Mexican that's close to the theater, this is the place.  The food is ok, it won't kill you.  I don't think.  But it's nothing special.",0.9414,0.823,0.123,0.054,0.5330830280830281

2012-01-22,4.0,"When you're craving Mexican, first ask yourself ""Do I want Americanized Mexican, or do I want Mexican Mexican?""  Your answer will greatly determine where you choose to eat.  Adobo is in a fantastic location at North/Wells.  It's right next to Second City, Zanies, and several fun pubs in this Old Town corridor.  However, it's not what you're expecting. For the uninitiated, Adobo is not your typical gringo Tex-Mex joint.  There is no Chili con Queso cheese dip on the menu.  There aren't 14 flavors of margarita to choose from.  There are no chimichangas, taquitos, fajitas or other items you've come to expect from 99 out of 100 Mexican restaurants in which you've ever set foot.  Nope.   Adobo has margaritas, but only one kind: the real kind.  The lime kind.  The kind with real agave in them.  The kind that taste amazing like a refreshingly tart and sweet drink with a kick.   Adobo has a cheese dip, but it's nothing like you've ever had before.  It's a melted cheese over salsa verde and chunks of chicken, corn and beans.  You have to cut it with a knife and scoop it with a spoon into soft, corn tortillas.   I ordered the beef spare ribs that were served on the bone.  It was like a pot roast texture where the beef was falling apart with the touch of a fork.  My wife had the roasted chicken and it was marinated in a sauce that was so tangy and delicious.  We both really enjoyed our dinners and felt like our culinary appreciation of a more authentic Mexican variety had been furthered several miles ahead.",0.9965,0.755,0.222,0.023,0.4845568783068783

Their menu is unique in that you could come and eat off the tapas style dishes or get full entrees. Its up to you!  They have a couple of great authentic Mexican vegetarian/ vegan options too! My favorite is their Veggie Enchiladas! The tamatillo sauce they douse the enchiladas in is perfectly spice for just enough kick and a lot of flavor! The squash seams to be always freshly cooked as opposed to out of a can. I also recommend getting their guacamole as an appetizer because is is freshly made right in front of you to your liking!  Lastly, their house margarita is a MUST! They make their own sweet and sour with fresh lime, lemon and agave syrup. Don't drink too quick though, because they do have quite a bit of tequila in them despite what you would think....

2011-07-28,2.0,"Adobo Grill has made significant changes since the last time I was there, perhaps a year ago, and they have all been for the worse. It's quite sad, as this used to be one of our favorite dinner joints in Old Town. Here's what's gone wrong: 1) The menu has been completely overhauled and is focused on overpriced 'small plates.' These small plates are great portion-wise, but they are overpriced and they're lacking the interesting flavors of the past. I have ordered cochinita pibil at Adobo countless times the past seven years or so. Cochinita Pibil is a Yucatecan dish centered on marinated pork. The pork I was served last night was not marinated. It was covered in a rather bland sauce instead. 2) To make matters worse, the menu has also veered far, far away from authentic Mexican food. No, it was never completely authentic, but it was closer than not. Not anymore, unfortunately. Case in point: they are offering a tlayuda, a traditional dish served in Oaxaca. My husband works in Oaxaca, so I've lived there off and on for the past several years. I have eaten many, many real tlayudas. The tlayuda itself is actually just a large corn tortilla, cooked on the clay comal (as they always are in Oaxaca) and is a bit tougher than regular corn tortillas. They are used to scoop up beans and other soupy dishes. They are also served with toppings by street vendors, particularly late at night. (If you're in Oaxaca City, head over to Tlayudas Libres after 9 p.m. for the meal of your life!). On top of the oversized CORN tortilla, the vendor will put aciento (rendered pork fat), black bean paste, Oaxacan string cheese, and 'verduras,' salsa, and include a piece of grilled beef or sausage (the beef is cooked directly on the mesquite coals -- incredible!). Rather than this amazing dish, Adobo is serving a pizza and calling it a 'tlayuda.' There is no tlayuda at all! Rather, there is a wheat crust with a bunch of toppings on top, including a flood of sour cream, something you'd never, ever find in Oaxaca, period, let alone on a Tlayuda (which are always corn!). In Oaxaca, food is taken very seriously, and serving a wheat crust pizza and calling it a 'tlayuda' would be considered blasphemous. Unbelievable. 3) The drinks have gone WAY up in price. Want to try a mezcal? That will cost you $14.50. For what, a couple of ounces of mezcal? When the most expensive mezcals cost about $25 for a bottle? That's just wrong. So I've given the restaurant 2 stars rather than 1 because I have had good meals here in the past. But clearly those days are gone. With wheat pizza being sold as 'tlayudas' and 'small plates' being sold at regular entree prices, Adobo Grill has been taken off of our list. So sad.",0.831,0.858,0.083,0.059,0.5355173128758034

They will make it right in front of you and I recommend getting two orders of it if if you have more then 4 people because it goes quick, despite the size-able portion. Also you have to try the different salsas appetizer. It comes with a few different flavors all very good, but my favorite was the smoked salsa  The entrees mimic the appetizers. Great quality food that was been very well cooked. Finally, the drinks, especially the margaritas are delicious. I would recommend the Mojito if someone wanted to get a cocktail as well. Normally I'm not crazy about Mojitos but I tried my fiance's and it was delicious.  The only Con I would have to give it is the noise level.

For complete disclosure, I gluttonously sampled each of the following (I'm a total bite-snatcher): Guacamole - It's an on-the-fly station they bring right to the table, so you can tweak the ingredients to your desire. The portions are generous; we got two for our table of 11 and it was perfect. Lomito en Mole Negro (pork loin): The mole was perfection. So rich, so dark, so handsome ... Arrachera Adobada (grilled flank steak): tender and amazing Cochinita Bibil (pulled pork): also tender and delicious Pastel de Pina (dessert): Holy fluffy amazingness. So many flavors going on here, all of them delicate and so, so tasty. Flan del Abuelo Artemio (dessert): Great flan, not-so-great strawberries (rubbery) Churros with Ancho Chocolate sauce: AWESOME. The ancho choc. sauce is fantastic. Sangria: Pretty standard, but didn't leave me wanting at all. Margarita: Excellent, truly. And I'm not a margarita person. This thing was dangerously tasty.

The food was good but I have to agree that the menu is somewhat limited and the prices are a tad high for what they are offering. Also, why are there only one type of tacos and why are they fried? I guess having lived in Denver and having easy access to New Mexico, I have been really spoiled by the abundant, fresh and affordable Mexican/Southwesten cuisine in that region. Anyway, they also didn't seem to have Patron Silver on their extensive tequilla list, which I found odd. But the guac is terrific and I have no complaints about any of the food we ordered. The mojito was very tasty but did not pack much of a kick, honestly. I would go back if I was in the neighborhood again. One tiny little annoyance: the bus boys were WAY too insistent and continuously interrupted our conversation and were hawking the table at all times. It was very intrusive and uncomfortable.

Minus 2 stars for pricing though.  I'm not trying to come across as cheap, but everything needs to be somewhere between $3 and $5 cheaper considering the amount of food you get and the quality of what you get.  Again, it's not bad by any means, but entrees that sell for $15 or $16 would be no more than $10 if you ordered them at a joint that didn't share a lobby with The Second City.

First off, as mentioned 100 times already, the tableside guacamole is darn fine.  Now, it is not the best I have ever had, but did like the ability to custom order it the way we wanted it.  This made it a requirement for the quac lady to make a second trip to our table.  It is important to mention the chips were hot and very good as well. We ordered the calamari (I know, we at a Mexican joint, why the hell order that) as an app, and it was decent.  For sure not the best ever but the plate was cleaned. For the entree, I could comment on the Lomito en Mole Negro which was spectacular.  The pork was uber tender, and the mole sauce was perfect with it.  The garlic spinach and the corn tamal was actually maybe even my favorite part.  Overall, GREAT stuff here folks! Now to the best part, the dessert.  My friend ordered the Tamal de Chocolate which was spectacular.  Semi sweet chocolate tamal in the corn husk.  No idea what was in it really, but it was killer.  As a side note, he changed from the vanilla ice cream to the coconut and that might have just made it even more over the top.  For me, I rocked the churro... cause how can you go wrong with a churro?!  How to go right with it... serve it with a semi sweet chocolate dipping sauce.  *Burp*   Well done Adobo!",0.9734,0.723,0.179,0.098,0.5394501133786849

Food (1 star): You must try the guacamole when you come here.  They roll a cart to your table and make it fresh, right in front of you.  It tastes significantly better than other ""table-side"" guacamoles I've had and the chips were great.  In addition to this, I ordered the Pollo al Tamarindo not really knowing what to expect.  The chicken had an exceptional glaze and was extremely tender and juicy.  My favorite part had to be the sweet glaze and I was craving for more after finishing off my plate. Service (1 star): It was a Friday night so we had to wait 5-10 minutes, but they have a nice waiting area in the middle of the restaurant (as opposed to by the front door at most other restaurants).  The waiter was very friendly and constantly checked on us to make sure our waters were filled and that are food and drinks were up to par.  It was a pleasant experience and they take care of you here, despite the crowd and hectic atmosphere. Value (0.5 stars): Prices are a bit higher than what I'm used to for similar restaurants, but only by a few dollars.  The food quality makes up for that, though I wish the portion sizes were increased (maybe I just eat too much or was craving more Pollo al Tamarindo).  The guac is almost as much as an entrée but was definitely worth getting. Experience (0.5 stars): The restaurant was very lively and is deceptively large inside.  The previously-mentioned waiting area was nice, but it just felt like there were too many people there.  The noise level was way too high as I could barely hear across the table or even the person next to me, and lighting was too dim for this type of restaurant.  That being said, the food was on par and I would still recommend checking this spot out.

2010-04-26,3.0,"I just can't get my head around the concept of high priced Mexican food. Those who know me realize how seriously I take my Mexican food. It borders on obsession.  My love for Mexican food started in college when I was introduced to the splendor that is late night Burrito's filled with Steak, Chorizo and covered with Mole Sauce. Like every other Red blooded, American college boy, I would spend my weekend hours at the bar, hoping beyond hope that I would get laid, only to be left with the comforting thought that a Steak Burrito the size of a ""74, Ford LTD would be in my future.   Mexican food is about marinated meats, sauces and textures. It's about the ability to feast yourself into a coma for under $10.00. It's about area's like Pilsen, Humboldt Park and Uptown. It's about fun, delicious food that is totally unpretentious. What it's not about is a upscale, Boutique of a restaurant in Old town.  The decor at Adobo is strange. It's Vegas version of a Pepe's Taco's. I have no idea what they were trying to get at with the Decor but to me, it was kind of odd.   On a positive note, our server was wonderful. She was quite attentive to our drink needs and explained all the specials to us.   For my entree, I ordered the skirt steak. It came with Rice, beans and tortillas. The steak was pretty tasty, but the portions were Billy Barty sized. I was actually thinking about stopping at the Burrito House on the way home.   The highlight of the meal was the Chips and Salsa sampler that we ordered as a appetizer. It came with four different types of Salsas ranging from Wimpy, to Burn your Lips off hot. All four were quite tasty.  I'm glad that I tried Adobo Grill. Although it was overpriced, it was a decent experience, but the next time I have a craving for Mexican food (which is daily) I will go elsewhere. There are many different dives, hole in the walls and street vendors that will fill my belly with better food without putting such a large dent in my wallet.",0.9872,0.843,0.122,0.035,0.4361839826839827

I was glad to have gotten the chips at that point! Also, the service here was impeccable.

I have a hard time not giving Adobo Grill 5 stars just based on the fact that it was here I was able to meet and talk to my celebrity crush, William Petersen. He's as nice as he is talented. But I suppose I should stick to the point of the review, which is Adobo Grill. Most of the downstairs section and part of the upstairs was reserved for the event. Everything was gratis, which made it all the better. First off, we were handed margaritas as soon as we walked in. Excellent and strong, everything you want in a margarita. On each table was chips, guacamole and salsa. The guacamole was good, but it was lacking a little zestiness. The salsa was great - it had a nice smokiness and a little kick to it. We snagged a table pretty close to the kitchen so our group was able to get food almost immediately after it was made. A nice variety of thngs were passed and everything was delicious. Chicken taquitos - somewhat spicy shredded achiote marinated chicken inside a crispy shell, with sour cream drizzled on top. I think I ate like 100 of these. Empanadas - stuffed with corn, cheese and poblanos. Heaven. Tilapia ceviche - fresh, citrusy, and spicy. It also had avocado and its creaminess provided a nice balance. Tamales  - stuffed with chicken and cheese and covered in a tomato salsa. Most excellent. Plantains - I love plantains and ate a bunch of these, but I have to confess that I have no idea what was on them, but they were really good. The staff did a great job and kept our margarita glasses full and our tummies happy.

Served in a cute little martini glass (I really thought that touch was neat) this margarita went down so smooth. Maybe a little too smooth!  Due to our persuasive waiter, we also went with some guacamole. Feeling bold, I ordered it spicy, figuring that most places idea of spicy guac isn't that spicy at all. Wrong-O.

We left paying $78, and I had a bowl of tortilla soup and my husband had the tamales appetizer. We each had a margarita, 2 Corona's, and shared a tequila flight (which was $10, not too bad). Now granted, that was a bit to drink, but not crazy for a happy hour.  I was shocked that we spent that much, when we only had appetizers to eat. Friends came late, shared some tiny quesadilllas and a few drinks and owed $40. It's just waaaaaay too much money, more than I ever want to pay for Mexican food.

I'm obsessed with basil, it's my favorite spice. And it's unbelievably good mixed with mint, tequila, and whatever soda they use. Lastly, they give you a quarter of a sugar cane stick to stir the drink. Yeah, I ended up chewing the stick... it's tasty.  Don't judge me! I will also mention the good margarita that I had, but nothing can sway me from the deliciousness that was their mojito.  I had a quesadilla and a bunch of us shared chips and salsa. All the food was good.  I am also now in love with their salsa that tasted like it had some liquid smoke in it. Smokey salsa is very tasty, and I don't really even like tomatoes.  It's a shame they don't sell it in stores. Lastly, the service was great.

In the end we were swayed by the 'chicago's best margaitas' tag on their website. Fickle? Yes. Ideal marketing fodder? Yes. I might go and buy some of those incredible slider stations and a snuggie later.  Anyway, I'm glad we trekked (ok, we took a cab) here. We took a margarita at the bar before getting to our table. They were delicious - not very strong, but tasty. As well as being fickle and gullible, I am clumsy, and spilt mine 4 times in 2 minutes. The nice barman filled it up again - sweet. We couldn't wean ourselves off the margaritas this time round so I'll have to go back to try some of their other cocktails - I'm a sucker for a daiquiri.  Guacamole made at the table - didn't entirely see the point of this being done but it made for a talking point, and I think one of my friends did memorise the ingredients to make it at home. It is very good guacamole. Warm tortilla chips too.  Then the food was fantastic. The appetisers are huge - my friend boxed half an appetiser and didn't have an entree. The entrees are the perfect size (i.e. I ate it all) and were really spot on. My lamb shank was perfectly cooked to melty-ness. Maybe it could have had a tiny bit more depth of flavour, but everyone else's were superb, particularly the seafood-stuffed poblano. The menu in itself is a good read too, we had to guess what a lot of things were, which makes for an interesting meal.

While not new anymore- I remember the first time I went to this place it was a novelty. I also like that they ask if you want it mild, medium or spicy. If I were you- go for the medium as I love spicy but the last time I had it hot, my eyes watered through the entire dinner! (Maybe the guac maker had it in for us!)  The entrees are good too. My favorite are the chicken enchiladas basted with mole rojo and topped with sour cream, onions and beans. Delicious!

Adobo Grill's food is passable. It certainly isn't bad, but it isn't really impressive, either. The tortilla chips were greasier than at most places and the texture was a little off as well. The guacamole was very good, though at around $8 for a single avocado and spices, it was definitely way over priced. In California that price got you twice as much tableside guac. The cazuela and quesadilla were both tasty, but not memorable. I know that the cazuela, a dish with melted cheese and pepper with fresh tortillas was definitely on the salty side. The mexican banana split was probably the best item of the evening. It included roasted plantains with scoops of coconut, strawberry, and abuelita mexican chocolate ice cream. The plantains were overcooked and disappointed, but the ice creams were amazing and just different enough to make a lasting impression. Since my partner hates coconut and I love it, I took that scoop and small tastes of each of the other two flavors.

The chili rellenos is a Mexican classic, however, and it is great at Adobo.  It is a tender green pepper, not tough or chewy, with really good cheese.  I had it at Lalos and it was nowhere near as good as here.  The vegetarian platter is also highly recommended.",0.978,0.758,0.226,0.016,0.48972222222222217

My margarita was shaken tableside and was basically perfect - it was sweet and not too strong, so it had a great flavor. The guacamole didn't get prepared tableside (because we were outdoors) but it was absolutely delicious, and we had a huge portion! It wasn't too spicy or lime-y, just very creamy and great with the crispy chips.  My entree (arrachera adobada) was flank steak in a mole sauce, with some beans and grilled tomatoes/onions on the side. I first tried to put the food in a tortilla, but was unimpressed by the results. The steak was MUCH better on its own, without being masked by the tortilla. The steak was very flavorful and juicy, and was paired wonderfully with the just-spicy-enough mole sauce. None of the side items were memorable, though they were a decent accompaniment to the entree.  The churros we had for dessert were excellent - they were hot and just covered in cinnamon and sugar. I didn't care for the rich chocolate sauce (with cayenne pepper in it!) but the churros didn't need it. The service was outstanding. Our waiter was knowledgeable, professional, and friendly.

Margaritas should be a subtle synergy resulting in euphoria 2) Margaritas should not be served in a martini glass. Margaritas should be hyper potent and on ice, forcing you to chug them before the ice melts 3) Margaritas should get me drunk.  Really, that was my biggest problem.   I will totally admit I am a pretentious ass when it comes to mexican food; I grew up in southern california, and girl, you know I got this chub from taco stands and pitchers of margaritas.   Anyways, I thought Adobo was great, minus their drinks, which were overpriced and not delicious (The three of us had a total of 10? drinks, and none of us were drunk).  Their take on mexican food was interesting, they had a great set of salsas with the chips, and it wasn't that sit-in-your-stomach-for-four-days-mush mexican food.  The flavors were subtle, there were lots of vegetables (my chayote squash was better than my mom's), but most importantly, THE CHOCOLATE TAMALES.

Fortunately, Adobo far exceeded my expectations.  Sure, the guacamole was as good as advertised.  Not only are the ingredients themselves fresh, but the tortilla chips are apparently prepared fresh every morning and are served warm at the table.  Probably worth the trip alone. But our entrees were equally tasty.  We ordered the Enchiladas de Vegetal (and I'm not a vegetarian) and they were AWESOME!  For butternut squash fans, this is the ultimate enchilada.  We also tried the Adobo Chopped Salad -- pretty solid.  It's no Wildfire Chopped Salad (what really is?), but it was a nice lighter option to balance out the the enchiladas.   Beyond the food, our server Alfonso was amazing, and the atmosphere was fun and lively.  I'll definitely be returning to Adobo...and without the preconceived notion that I'm only in for a night of guac and margaritas.",0.9929,0.726,0.242,0.033,0.6014957264957264

I would recommend the flight of ceviches and the flight of cazuelas. Both are very well prepared and although Adobo is by no means cheap, these two appetizers are pretty big and reasonably priced. Not a big fan of their entrees. I think that they are over priced and not always well prepared. This place is always very busy, so getting a table during dinner time on the weekends is next to impossible.  In summary, Adobo is a great place to go for a drink or two, get fresh guacamole  and enjoy a few of their appetizers.

2008-07-25,4.0,"Very recently I've turned into a big fan of Old Town. I love the variety of shops and restaurants that are neatly crammed into just a few streets. Parking can be notoriously difficult to find, but lately I've had the parking angel riding shotgun with me in the Mini Cooper, directing me to the rare open spots on Wells.  Adobo Grill was always at the top of my list of restaurants to try, but timing was never right. I'd usually head out on Saturday evenings when waits would be way too long. However, yesterday I lucked out and came by on a not so busy Thursday! Parking angel had directed me to a prime parking spot so I was even more stoked when I didn't have to wait at Adobo Grill. I had a long day at work and decided I wanted to drink away the day's stress. I'm not normally a fan of the liquid dinner, but desperate times call for desperate measures. I saddled up to the bar with the BF and we ordered the two most popular cocktails - the Adobo Margarita and Mojito. I'm not usually a fan of margaritas over ice, but this place has turned me into a convert! I probably offended the guy by asking for a frozen margarita first and he probably spit in my drink, but I digress. The margarita had just the right amount of my on-again/off-again buddy Jose Cuervo. I had a buzz, but it was one of the good kinds - complete with non-stop giggling and 100 mph chatter. I'm sure the BF loved it. We also ordered some chips and four salsas, which were very good. People rave so much about the guacamole here, but given the allergy, I wasn't able to try it. I am glad, though, that the salsas didn't disappoint! I'll go back to Adobo Grill to have a full meal one of these days.

2007-11-04,3.0,"This place definitely has a nice atmosphere and is much larger than it looks - our table for 12 was in some backroom somewhere upstairs. Service was also great and our waiter was very kind, even running after us with a camera that one of us had left behind just after we exited the restaurant. However, based on the food, it's not somewhere I'll be going back to anytime soon. For starters, I was truly expecting some stellar guacamole - and it was not. I will say that it was cool watching them make it right in front of us, but our bowl was bland and did not have that bite of lime everyone was raving about (although there were limes in it). I've definitely had better. The margaritas made it better, though, and I definitely recommend those! Our table shared some empanadas to start with, which were quite tasty and crunchy on the outside. We thought the entrees would be big so I split one with my boyfriend, and it turned out to be not enough. We picked the filete al pasilla (steak) based on the waiter's recommendation - it was good, but not amazing, and a bit pricey for the size of the portion. Presentation-wise, it was pretty much just a slab of meat and a few mushrooms smothered in sauce, but it was nice that they split it onto separate plates for us to share. Personally, I don't really eat Mexican food all that often, so I can't say much about how the food measures up to other places.

The skewers supposedly had 3 sauces- could barely tell the difference between them. The empanada didn't really taste very good. There were a few high points in our ordering (we ordered appetizers only, deciding to try more rather than fill up on an entree), but overall, we're not going back. The service was poor. It took them 40 min to give us chips! When we sent back a salted margarita because it was requested sin sal, we got a dirty look. In any other town (like our native Oak Park), this restaurant would be great. In Chicago, it's just another joint that's losing it's sheen. With competition as stiff as it is in Chi-town, management can't blink without the threat of something better edging them out.

2007-09-23,4.0,"Adobo was probably one of the first Mexican restaurants I tried when I moved to Chicago.  I was actually surprised how well the food stood up to my Texas roots.  Pretty soon I'd come to realize Adobo was also intended for more of a yuppie, Old Town crowd, and that all over this city there were, contrary to popular belief, plenty of amazing Mexican eateries, and a majority of them were ethnic, cheap, and startlingly similar to places I'd experienced in Dallas and Austin.   Chicago has some excellent Mexican food available, and this restaurant happens to be a great option for a casual upscale clientele, featuring mainly cuisine from the southernmost regions of Mexico.  No Tex-Mex here, except perhaps the micheladas (essentially beer, bloody mary juice, and lime juice) on the drink menu (but I don't know really where that originated anyway).  Their guacamole is pretty good, but I agree that it's overpriced.  And also, I too make better guacamole (see profile pictures for documented evidence).  That said, sometimes quality trumps quantity, and I do like how they make it the old fashioned way, fresh right in front of your table.   I also feel like the food quality at Adobo is always consistently above-average.  I've tried almost all the menu at this point and while the tacos might be more tasty and trendy at De Cero, and the torta may just be a dressed up sandwich you could buy at a regular Mexican dive for half the price, I can't argue that everything always seems to taste good.  If you want to go light, try to get the Adobo Salad or a ceviche sampler.  Also, the fries that come with tortas are just as good as the guacamole, but I didn't see them on a ""sides"" menu.  I'm sure they'd be happy to whip you up a batch upon special request.   Lastly, how could I forget to mention the tequila selection?  I know there are other tequila bars in the city, and I've heard Zocalo is pretty awe-inspiring.  All the same, any tequila-lover is going to have plenty of room to navigate with their extensive tequila list.  There's also a special on three premium tequilas where you can buy a rack of 10 shots for reasonable prices.  The lowest tier was in the $30 range and the highest was $54 I think.  That's $5.40 a shot, which is still high, but when you're talking about a premium tequila that would be $8-10 a shot alone, you're getting a hell of a deal, and making nine easy friends all at once.",0.9946,0.795,0.163,0.042,0.5316190984940986

If you're short on money and just looking for a good burrito, go to Taco and Burrito Palace (see review/rave) instead .",0.9538,0.769,0.217,0.014,0.36746031746031743
2005-07-11,4.0,You have to get the guacamole here!  They make it right before your eyes with fresh avocados and it is to die for!  But make sure you read the menu carefully and ask about the portions so you know exactly what you're getting.. I ordered the wrong thing and was dissapointed.. but my drink came in a real coconut!,-0.4265,0.84,0.088,0.073,0.6249433106575963
