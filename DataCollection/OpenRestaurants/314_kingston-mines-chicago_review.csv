I've been here so much, so I've met the owner on multiple occasions and he truly runs this place a labor of love, live music on two alternating stages supporting musicians, great BBQ food and has a license to be open and serve drinks among the latest anywhere in Chicago area (4 or 5 AM!) As a student downtown this was my favorite 'after a night out on the town' place be it concerts clubs/bars shopping or whatever... either by myself to unwind watch and learn guitar and relax or great atmosphere for late late night with friends.

There are 2 stages where bands alternate sets.  The musicians are always amazing!  I often watch the first band's set and enjoy it so much that I don't want it to end.  Then the next band's set starts on the 2nd stage and I'm blown away at how good they are with a totally different style!   It gets pretty packed here but the staff are good with crowd control and making sure areas are clear to move around.  The crowds are usually friendly and fun!   Be sure to give yourself permission to dance and sing along while enjoying this fun experience in the city!   Besides great Beer and cocktails, they serve Barbecue in the back of the club.  So far I've tried the Buffalo wings.  They were seasoned well and very tasty.  The kitchen is small so your food may take awhile.

The experience was seamless except for the fact that the ticket lady was reluctant to let my friends in because their student IDs did not have expiration dates on them. That held up the line by 10 minutes. By the time we got in, all of our frustrations dissipated as Claudette Miller took the stage. She was fantastic! The crowd loved her. I did too. It was a great way to close out the evening. We didn't stick around for very long to enjoy more of the music or drinks at the bar, but I would say that it's a solid place to hang out.

Fortunately, you can hear the music from both rooms. What I love the most about this place is the diversity of the crowd. There seems to be people from all walks of life and from all over the city, all enjoying live music! They have music every day of the week!

I entered for the first time at 9 o'clock on a recent Wednesday evening and didn't leave until 3:30 Thursday morning. The $16-for-5-bottles-of-Bud special helped lubricate the evening quite nicely, thank you. There are two rooms at The MInes (Forgive me if I get overly-familiar here. I feel like I've known the place much longer than I have.) Both rooms were comfortably full from the time we arrived until the time we left. That says something. It was a Wednesday, remember. We started the night in the long, narrow side room with a wailing band up front--with very special guest blues woman whose name I should remember, but I was too busy shaking my ass to her rendition of ""Clean Up Woman.""  PEACHES!  Yes! That's right. Her name was Peaches! Nice job, woman! After her set with the band, it came to everyone's attention that someone in the front was having an anniversary. Someone in their party screamed, ""Play 'Let's Get It On!"" To which the lead singer quipped ""you need to tip for that"" before immediately launching into a steamhouse-hot version of the Marvin Gaye classic. Once the side room show wrapped up, we moved to the main floor where a second band was already grinding out their own set. It was in the main room that I realized just how diverse this crowd is. Older guys in suits who were clearly in town for a convention. A hearty helping of men and women in their 20's and 30's--seemingly hanging out with their co-workers.. College kids. A couple of families. Some guy who looked exactly like he just crawled out of Dodge City (not sure what his deal was, but he fit right in). There are casual food options--though we all opted for the liquid menu--and good drink specials most nights. After my first (and definitely not last) visit, I understand why Kingston Mines has been going strong for nearly 50 years.

When the band next door was done, up to our stage walked ""Vance Kelly and the Back Street Candy Lickers"".  They sure as hell put on an impressive show, fully engaging the now-rowdy crowd while ripping some of the nastiest blues I've ever heard.  Since I'm by no means a blues connoisseur, this to me was good music.  And a wonderful time.  And who in their right minds would ever forget such a great band name?!",0.844,0.773,0.124,0.103,0.543140589569161

2014-06-04,5.0,"WHY I WENT THERE: I was in the mood for some post-dinner live music Memorial Day weekend, and had heard great things about this place both from numerous Chicago guidebooks and friends.  When someone compared it to my favorite bar in Austin, 311, I was instantly sold. AMBIANCE: Dark but not dank, and just at (but not the beyond) the tipping point between bustling and overcrowded.  Has a bar in the larger, main side that doesn't get too packed and as well as a smaller room to the side.  As described below, the split has a very specific and effective purpose. MUSIC:  Wow.  From conception to execution, this place nails it.  There are actually two stages, with one band attached to each; they alternate sets, so that the music never stops.  Their schedule is available online, and they seem to have a fairly set rotation, with the same band usually playing the same night of the week.  We happened to go on a Sunday--again, this was Memorial Day weekend--and my favorite was Sharon Lewis & the Texas fire.  Legit soul/blues, with the bassist--a guy named CC Copeland--was the star in our group's eyes.   DRINKS: Given the relatively casual atmosphere, they have a surprisingly extensive beer list--many local options, which I always appreciate--as well as a full bar.  Reasonable prices. FOOD: Did not sample, but menu features good range of bar food with some slightly Southern inspirations. SPONTANEITY FACTOR: Generally opens at 8pm, and the line gets intimidating by midnight.  I'd recommend going to between 10-11pm to avoid being either too early or two late. SUMMARY: I haven't been to too many local music spots in town, but I can't imagine one being more up my alley than this place.  If you have either abundant youth or the desire to feel like death the next day, it's open until 4 am every night except for Saturday, when it closes at 5 a.m.  Godspeed.",0.9873,0.809,0.148,0.043,0.4670138888888889

Okay, so $15 cover on the weekends isn't great, sure it is a little pricey, but if you show almost any ID, you can get that reduced. My friend showed her lawyer ID and we paid no cover. Tip of the day: have friends with lawyer badges.  I don't want to skip over the obvious so the music is great! They have two stages so if you want to be in the thick of the crowd dancing you can but if you want to chill at a long beer garden type table they have that too. It is big enough that you have options and can change it up. Plus the drinks weren't too badly priced and the bartenders were quick and friendly.

I came to Chicago with a native who said that if I liked blues, this was the place to go. So we planned on venturing out Sunday evening to visit KM.  Lunch was pizza and a long island or three - it was a pizza place.  Fast forward to about 9:30 - we went to get dinner at a mexican place down the street. Not exactly sure where it was - but we went there.  Lastly, to the ATM to take money out to pay the cover - which was actually 12 if I'm not mistaken.  Then - inside the bar. For a Sunday night, it was happening. A lot of people enjoying the music. It was a bit crowded - but we were able to find a seat Up to the bar for our first drink Long island for me - beer for my buddy - new castle I think.  Linsey Alexander is playing, walking around and schmoozing the ladies.  After a few songs - over to stage two where another band is playing. I'm not sure what they are singing - but they are definitely energetic. Maybe 100 - 150 people in the bar.  Drinks #2 and #3.  Things are grooving right a long. Back to stage 1. I'm not exactly sure where things went after that. I wanted to get a picture with the female lead of the group on stage 2. She was kind of ... rude ... wanted to socialize with friends. But, it's fine. I didn't care that much - just went back to stage 1.  Linsey alexander was grooving right along. Drink #4 Linsey Alexander is having an ass shaking contest with about 4 girls. One is shy - she gets kicked off pretty quickly - but she gave it a good effort. I'm right along cheering with the other guests Things are beginning to get hazy I buy a CD Not sure what happened on Stage 2. Left shortly there after while drinking Long Island #5 - but didn't finish it. My buddy had my money/id/cell phone.  Walked back 7 miles to the hotel.  Ouch Drinks were cheap - a top shelf long island was only 6 bucks. Beer 2.50 or 3 bucks Overall ... I had a great time. Definitely is on my list of places to go back to the second time around - maybe with a leash or a note pinned on my shirt ""If this dumbass begins to drink too much, call his mother in California"" Oh, and I don't think I'm going to drink for a long long time.",0.9915,0.802,0.143,0.055,0.4516567794345571

We are bout to have us a booty shaking contest!"" The crowd goes wild! Oh hell no! Me and another girl tried to run off the stage but got escorted back up! How embarrassing! I've never done anything like this in my life! One by one each girl shook their thangs to the beat of the drums. Some were doing it quite naaasty and some were just too shy to do much at all. I was the fourth one up and was like thinking 'F*ck it, I'm gonna kill this right here. Nobody knows me, but I'll try to keep it classy'. hehe.. So I shook it, popped it, dropped it, and all that good stuff as best I could. The whole time I'm thinking, 'WTF am I doing?!' LOL! My friend was dying and taking videos of me. Surprisingly, I was voted top two out of the six ladies by audience applause and had to battle it out with the other chick. I had to bust out some of my secret moves and make it bounce side to side and dropping it low and keeping it there.. pop pop pop. I guess those squats I've been doing helped. hahaha..Then guess what? Your girl from Seattle won! What? What? I got a Kingston Mines t-shirt for it. That whole experience was hilarious! I laughed so hard and had so much fun.  After the booty shakin' contest, everyone hit the dance floor and danced the night away.

The drinks and beers are typical for the area: Light domestics, low-end imports, and lots of liquor.  The Kingston Mines is not a destination for quality drinks, however, and the music, atmosphere, and conversation are well worth the high price tag for an Old Style.  Doc's Rib Shack supplies affordable and tasty bites.

The talent was amazing though and they did a great job interacting and joking with the crowd. The two bands play back and forth the whole night so what's annoying is that you have to switch rooms to follow them. Still, it was a very social environment, so you could bond with other folks.

Cleanliness - this particular category more than any, in my mind, is a deciding factor in how I rate a place. This place, overall isn't bad.

Longtime chicago institution Kingston Mines is one of a few blues bars that you should definitely visit when you have the opportunity. I went to Kingston Mines for the very first time last year, despite having lived on the north side my whole life.

I went again a few weeks ago after hearing about Nick and the Overalls, and we had a blast! I think they play every Wednesday now, but you should check the schedule and be sure. The entire lineup is pretty solid -- bass player makes the craziest jams look effortless, the drummer is rock-solid, and the two guitarists made for a really well-balanced duo. The lead singer has some crazy pipes for a skinny dude who looks very unassuming, and his guitar chops were surprising, too. I probably wouldn't plan to *eat* here.

Otherwise, it was a $12 cover.  We arrived around 9pm and it was crowded, but we were still able to find some empty seats in the very back. As the night wore on, it became harder and harder to find a seat and more people had to stand. The musicians here were mostly older, save for one teenager who played a mean harmonica. He had to go home early as it was a school night. But I loved the jam sessions and the owner (Linsey Alexander) was good at getting the crowd going, lots of upbeat original music was played. After about 1.5 hrs, Linsey had us migrate to the other smaller room for a different set. This proved to be difficult as it was open seating and we ended up sitting next to a huge group of Danes. They kept standing up and migrating seats to talk and chit chat. I don't blame them, but it made our experience less enjoyable so we moved to another table, also with a bad view. After about an hour here of jazz, blues, and some classics, we got migrated back to the large room. About half the crowd had left at this point, so my friends and I sat in the front, ready for some more good music. Oh boy was that a mistake, on my part, that is. After a couple of songs, Linsey started pulling girls up on stage. I was sitting on the wrong side of the table, unprotected, so I was yanked up there along with 5 other girls. 2 girls managed to escape while Linsey was talking up the crowd, so he had to refill their spots. But the girls I was chatting with on stage were super friendly and were just as willing to make a fool of themselves as I was. We ended up having to do a ""booty"" dance for about 30 seconds each.

Not sure why someone was upset about paper plates - the prices are good too. AS FOR THE MUSIC, they bring in the best 7 days a week, only closed one nite a year. Now that is a blues club, open later than anywhere else and music keeps goin without breaks.  Many great elder blues legends and hot new talents, both local and internationally famous, have played here often. Some musicians stop by to sit in to jam late nite after finishin another gig elsewhere. Its informal but people arrive in all kinds of garb, comin from other events. I think some datenite women dont like the bench seating, but it allows more seating and less standing and- there are chairs too, and tables are everywhere. Never saw children in here, why did a reviewer say that.. Usually you get plenty of space even if you have a large group. You sometimes have to sit on the side of the club that is not yet playin live music if you arrive after 9 or 10. But you can hear the other side and view it on tv very well. Until your side has their turn. Just keep moving to  the 'other side '-before they start, and you will have your choice of seats all nite. Number one live music club in Chicago for a reason. You want leather couches, downtown has that but not at a blues club. No its not fancy, its lives blues, the real thing, for 15 bucks. (and ladies, the bathrooms are kept really neat and tidy.) You will dance, laugh and relax. Great staff service.

2010-09-27,3.0,"I am a fan. This place has been on my Chicago ""bucket list"" for almost 2 years and I finally made it here this past weekend.  Know before you go:  1. Look up both bands playing on a given night and make sure you like both. They switch every hour, so it's a short set and a long wait if you're only there for one.  2. You can always buy tickets at the door. If you purchase online you pay a convenience fee (for an inconvenience) and have to bring in the confirmation page as proof that you actually purchased them. It's lame but they must print off the info way earlier that day. I bought the tix about an hour before the show (online) and she gave me a hard time at the door because ""my name wasn't on the list"". (Lame!) 3. The layout is weird. 2 rooms and a kitchen in the back. If you want food you gotta go in there. You can float between rooms or stake out a spot and stay there even when the band is playing in the other room. (There is a closed-circuit TV showing what's happinin' in the other room.) 4. The food is INCREDIBLY fatty and greasy. Not to say it isn't delicious. The mac n' cheese was the best I have EVER had, but there was about a teaspoon of grease at the bottom of the bowl (yes, of mac and cheese) when we were done. There must have been at least a stick of butter in our small serving. We had the fish n' chips too (meh).  The drinks here are quite cheap, which is great! I had read several reviews that commented on the odd crowd that shows up here - with all the tourists and such. I agree, it was touristy and there were a ton of ""mom jeans"" out on the floor at first, which definitely detracted from the music. Later in the night, though, everyone was on the dance floor and it wasn't noticeable.  The comparison: The music was phenomenal. I have only been to Buddy Guy's once, but the band at Kingston infinitely trumped the one I saw at Buddy's. Kingston is more comfortable and has a bit better viewing, but it the crowd at Buddy Guy's seemed to actually be blues fans, as opposed to just looking for an interesting night out.",0.9831,0.864,0.103,0.033,0.5046825396825397

The place wasn't anything fancy,very casual; a bunch of bar tables and plain wooden chairs and tables filled with jazz lovers drinking bottomless beers and wines.   We started off with Joanna Connor and she was mind blowing!!! The only way to get high without alcohol is by listening to her music,and then we moved to the next room where Magic Slim was singing ;a soothing and deep voice that was putting me to sleep for a bit,but they had amazing sax players.    KM is a great Jazz place which fills your ears with love until 4am for just 15$. I don't think i was a great fan of the wine they served.But even the worst drink,would taste better being in this piece of heaven.I LOVE IT!!!!  :) -Smriti",0.9944,0.759,0.215,0.025,0.6012190476190477

2009-11-16,4.0,"So, I entered this place and didn't know exactly what to expect. I read some very jaded reviews here, but also got a recommendation from a native Chicagoan, so I was conflicted about what I was going to be subjected to. Would it be awesome blues, or garbage? So glad you asked...and I'll get to that later.  Well, first, I want to say that this place was a lot larger than I expected. Two stages, ample seating, and a back area where you could go to order some food, should you get hungry. The crowd was weird, but I would chalk that up to this being such a well known place, so what you end up with is a group of out-of-towners (myself included). The crowd was considerably older than me, as well. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, just something I noticed. However, I didn't let this stop me from having a good time, and frankly, I don't think you should either.  I arrived when there was no cover, and I also got stamped for free admission to another place just across the street, which was a pretty cool perk, if you ask me.  Now, I could complain about how every person in there had at least 10 years on me in age. I could complain about a lot of them not being ""into"" the music and just being there to get to say ""I have culture!"", but I won't. I didn't visit this place for the patrons. I visited for the music, and you know what? Kingston Mines struck gold (oh yeah, I did the cheap pun.)  I arrived with my girlfriend, we sat down and had some beer. The place was crowded, but all the staff was friendly. After a while, Linsey Alexander, the main attraction for that night, takes the stage and has a bit of a chat with us. He was candid, vulgar, and didn't pull punches. In other words, he was awesome.  Anyway, at one point, he calls out for one of the workers to come up. She does, and I'm thinking, okay maybe it's her birthday or something silly like that. But no...she gets up there and starts singing, and you know what? She wasn't bad either. I think it's pretty cool to have a place like that where your own staff can be talented enough to take a song or two.  Anyway, some time passes, and a visiting group comes up, plays some great music, and they really got into it. When they went back to their seats, I realized that they were sitting next to us the whole time. Nice folks, totally down to earth--almost too much, in fact. One of them said to me ""I have to tell you: your girlfriend is [expletive] hot, man!"" when she went to the bathroom. Gee, thanks barefoot blues man.  So, Linsey Alexander comes up and he puts on a great show. Walking through the audience, speaking with them between songs, and just having fun being a cooky guy. In the midst of all this, we got some fried chicken wings and BBQ ribs that were so delicious! If this place played no music and just served food from their kitchen, they'd still have plenty of business, in my opinion.  This was the last day of my Chicago visit, and I'm there holding a Corona and a chicken wing, easily the most classless meal I had on the entire vacation, and yet I was having a great time. Oh, and the kitchen doesn't close, either. How's that for amazing? Lots of places have kitchens that close an hour before the establishment, and this place just doesn't do that. Fantastic.  I was really annoyed that the ATM in the back charged me $4 to get my own money out, so I would recommend coming with cash in hand.  If you're looking for a place to go to have some great food, hear some great music, and go home happy, stop into Kingston Mines.

First - I think it was all tourists (me included).  That's NEVER a good sign.  Nothing about the crowd seemed authentic.  Just a bunch of non-blues loving people looking for an authentic Chicago experience.  Yes, that makes me a hypocrite - but you know how it is, when you go to a Chinese restaurant - you want it to be full of Chinese people - that's a good indicator. Second - We stayed for 3 shows.  Prior to each show, the announcer spent at least 5 minutes berating the audience about how we need to applaud more, be alive, show some enthusiasm.  I know it's important for a band to feel the crowd and yes, we were not the liveliest bunch - but the place wasn't empty.  Perhaps something about the whole place just felt like this was a routine performed for tourists (like me) so nobody could get too excited. I wanted to stay for one more performance but the minute he got up again to introduce them, I decided I've taken enough insults for the night and I was out of there. Next - paper, plastic & styrofoam.  If you try to live a ""green"" life, don't order food here.  We ordered a couple of meals and everything (including the steak dinner) came on paper plates and styrofoam bowls.  Yea - that's fun and classy - cut a steak with a plastic fork on a paper plate.  YUM -- Paper bits with your steak sir?  I was disgusted at the quantity of disposables that was created from a simple meal for 2 people. Oh yea - ordering food?  You go to the food counter and order there.  Then they tell you to come back after a while.  Then you go back after a while and hope your order is ready (sitting there under the warming lamps).  So you go back to your table with plates on top of plates to bring it back.  You're lucky if you only make one trip and not dump the food somewhere.  At that point - I didn't bother to ask if they offer any trays - it just didn't seem worth he hassle anymore.  (Why the F* did I leave a tip at the food counter?  So they could make my food and then forget to give me my salad which I had to make another trip to pick up?)

2009-07-19,2.0,"I am very conflicted in writing this review.  Maybe it's just my mood as of late, but even though I feel like I should like this place, I can't give it more than two stars.  I just can't. One of the reasons that I like living in Chicago is it's history.  There is so much to learn about this city, and so many things to experience.  I also love music.  Any time i get the chance to see a show, I go.  So, when I went here this past weekend with an out of town friend, I was looking forward to it because I thought I would get to experience both - Chicago history and listening to great music. We walk in and it is absolutely packed.  We walked all the way to the back, then got drinks at the bar by the second stage.  The bartenders were all very nice and we got waited on right away.  They have TVs in both bar areas so you can see the performances, even if you aren't in the performance room.  We stuck around for a set on the main stage, and a set on the second stage and enjoyed both very much.  We didn't get to sit down either time, but were able to stand without feeling too crowded.  After the second set we ordered chili nachos that were really good and totally hit the spot. But guess what - I would not go back. I will be the first to admit that my rating might reflect my attitude about concerts and bars in general for that manner.  One of the reasons that I love going to concerts is the shared experience of listening to a band that everyone there to see because a) they are a fan of the band and want to see them perform or b) they are a fan of music and appreciate music for music's sake, if they are a fan of the performer or not.   The general crowd here were neither of the above.  I would put money on the fact that less than 20% of the people in that place were even listening to or trying to appreciate the music.  I looked around (a lot) and mainly saw tourists looking to ""experience"" Chicago, college students looking to get hammered, cougars looking to get ""lucky"", or people looking to get ""lucky"" with a cougar.  There were no real fans of the performers, and more importantly there did not seem to be any other musicians in the crowd that were there just to check out the music for the sake of music.  Strike one. Strike two for me was the generic vibe I was getting of the place.  Again, I don't know what I was expecting, but it felt like Disney Land.  I mean, I've been to Epcot center and ate ""French"" food in ""France"" where the waiters had French accents, but guess what - I also was still in Florida.  That is not what France is like.  And no matter what they did here, guess what - I was still in Lincoln Park.  And Lincoln Park...well...very DL itself. On paper I should have liked this place.  The service, food, and music was great.  However the crowd and ambiance did not do it for me.  Not at all.",0.9977,0.825,0.153,0.022,0.42570782576596533

I don't particularly like paying covers to get in places, so I wasn't thrilled by the $15 cover, however I was willing to go for a friend's birthday.  I had a couple of the drink specials that were $5 a piece, and I think the normal well drinks were less than that.  The food was pretty tasty, and prices were reasonable for that as well.

I'd rather be at Kingston Mines. And really, the drinks are not that expensive. The crowd is older (and by older, I mean older then 25) and eclectic.

2009-05-03,4.0,"I went here last night for a work gathering - one of the PTs I work with had a bunch of free passes from a former patient who had some affiliation with the place. It was very nice not having to pay cover :) When we came in around 10:30 or 10:45, the place was packed in the main room. Their security is very good about making sure no one is standing in the aisles, which is hard considering the number of people. I appreciated this though, because I hate not being able to move in bars and clubs like this. The main room is long, with a bar on one side and tables in the main area. There's a small opening in front of the stage where people can/were dancing (assuming that's what it's for - the 3 guys who were really into it were really drunk and very entertaining). We went to the other room with another stage because there were 20 of us and we wanted to be able to stay together. The other room is much smaller, with a few tables on the main floor and more up a small ramp, which was great for viewing the stage. There's also a bar in the back of this room, as well as a few random arcade games. The tables in this room are more like tall benches, just wide enough to hold some drinks, which is fine as long as you're not eating. The band was playing in the main room, but the acoustics were good enough that you can still hear them clearly in the other room, but can still hold a conversation with the people around you. They had a closed-circut TV on the wall so you can see the band in the other room too, which is cool. The band was supposed to come in to the small room to play around 11:30. I had to leave before then cuz I had somewhere I had to be, but I'm assuming they did - I like that they switch back and forth from the stages. They also had another girl playing in the small room first, but her set ended before we got there. I guess she switched to the larger room at 11:30 as well. Not really sure. The beer was a bit overpriced, in my opinion, with MGD/Bud/Lights at $3.75, Blue Moon at 4, and my personal fav Michelob Ultra Light at 5. I refuse to pay for a single beer what I'd pay for a 6-pack at Jewel on sale, but that's just me. We had a pre-party anyway so I didn't feel like drinking more, especially considering I was driving shortly thereafter. They also have $15 buckets of Miller on Mondays, according to the sign on the wall.  The cover is usually $15-20 I think, but fortunately we had passes/didn't have to pay :) Combined with the drink prices, it's pretty expensive, but it's a nice atmosphere. It's not super classy, so you don't need to get all dolled up, but it wasn't trashy either, which I loved. It's very neighborhood-y.  I would def. come back, but I would come on a night where they have their college ID special (free cover w/valid college ID!)...which basically means I have until June 30 when mine expires. I believe those are Sunday-Wednesdays or something.  The band (Vance Kelly I think?) was great. Not very bluesy - more motown/R&B (temptations, Shout!, etc.), but they were awesome. They really had the crowd going. Parking I can imagine would be a pain. If I didn't go to the pre-party at this girl's condo to watch the Bulls game at 7, I never would have found a place right out front.",0.997,0.814,0.152,0.035,0.5091781537176272

Wait service was very slow, and the bar itself is very crowded. The music itself was just okay - I wasn't excited by any means. Due to the relative noise and crowding, I would strongly recommend against this as a date night.

2008-09-18,4.0,"Last night was my first time at Kingston Mines.  I didn't really know what to expect having never been to a blues bar, but I found out that I enjoy them...at least this one. I went on a Wednesday night- $12 cover.  Jimmy Burns played on the back stage with his southern, R&B-style, Muddy Waters-esque blues first, then we moved to the front stage to see Andre Taylor's band who was more of a guitar-shredding, west-side, Stevie Ray Vaughan blues.  Jimmy Burns had some great southern jams and Andre Taylor was a flashy guitarist with a sick bass player.  Both bands were great in their own right.  They both played all (or mostly) covers, which was cool, but I'd like to hear what these guys can write. Enough about the bands... The venue was pretty neat.  The sound was was perfect volume, sounded clear, and for those in the back you can see the performers on mounted TVs.  You can talk to a friend across the table without having to yell at the top of your lungs.  The place actually looks like its in pretty shitty condition with the stained ceiling tiles, old tables and chairs, etc, but it all builds character and adds to the history of the place.  The murals of buildings, skylines, and street performers painted on the walls were awesome! Don't come for the food.  I had the rib tips and it was definitely not what I would consider real barbeque.  However, I knew this going into it and I am not reviewing KM based on the food because it is what it is.  People don't come here to eat, they come to listen to the blues, drink, and have a good time.  Have dinner somewhere else, then go to KM at 9:30 when the music starts. The drink selection was average, but the prices were decent for a bar in Chicago.  The special was 5 St. Pauli Girl's for 15 bucks.  We got a bucket of dunkel and although not great beer, made the barbeque more tolerable and it was relatively cheap taboot. I think there were two waitresses last night and the venue was pretty crowded because of two huge parties- one was a bunch of Norwegien visitors.  That being said, our server was actually really good.  She was busy, but always had time to stop by and ask if we were ok on drinks. The MC for the night, Frank-something, was definitely a downer.  He was preachy, annoying, and talked too long in between sets.  The security staff however was pretty good.  I haven't been to a bar that is so adamant about clearing the fire exits and egress ways, but it was nice being able to walk to the bar or restroom without having to trample over people. Overall, the setting was real chill and laid back.  I went with a co-worker, but it could be a great place to take friends if they are into live music.  A date would also be fun because there are dance floors and dancing is encouraged.  As a music fan, I don't think the $12 cover was too expensive to see two great bands.  Had it been a weekend and I was with friends, I would have kept drinking and stayed until the early morning.  $12 is not too much for 6 hours of entertainment.   I recommend it at least once so you can make your own opinion.",0.9993,0.741,0.231,0.028,0.5142316017316017

2007-02-10,3.0,"I can't claim to be an expert as I've only been here once as a tourist and it's my first time in a blues joint.  Overall I'm glad I went, but mainly I think for the novelty of the experience and the GREAT band that we got to see - Big James and the Chicago Playboys.  Phenomenal musicians that all left my jaw hanging down to the floor. But it's definitely an older place that reeks of cigarette smoke as soon as you walk in.  I guess that's how it goes but I can't stand cigarette smoke.  I guess the concept of having 2 separate rooms with alternating bands playing every hour is a good idea on one level, but once I've gotten comfortable in my seat, I really don't feel like fighting the crowd to go over to the other room.  I think I'd rather just deal with the down-time between bands, and give my eardrums a break from the VERY loud speakers. Service was decent and the emcee was cool. $15 cover charge, $10 for students, not bad.  It really was the GREAT music that helped me ignore the nastily offensive dancing going on and the stink of the smoke...and ultimately let me walk away still having enjoyed the experience.",0.9812,0.749,0.178,0.073,0.5519675925925925
2007-01-29,4.0,"I have mixed feelings about Kingston Mines. On the one hand, the surly bouncers growling at everyone outside is a bit much.  The $20 cover charge is a bit much.  The inside looks more like some slabs of tables & a couple bars set up in someone's huge barn or garage.  The DePaul kids who decided they wanted to check out a different scene & end up pissing on the good names of blues giants everywhere (i'm talking to you, dan, who picked a fight with b.b. king) are headache-inducing. On the other hand, there's little down-time between bands with the two stages, which means there is no jukebox playing Britney Spears in-between sets, which is always a plus.  Kid Dynamite is a TREASURE.  It's not pretty, & neither are the blues.  It's a fun, cool atmosphere in a neighborhood known more for vomiting coeds than killer basslines. Every time I've been here, I've had a blast, so I gotta kick it at least four stars.",0.8749,0.769,0.149,0.082,0.4616666666666668

On one hand it feels like it's simply fossilized tourist music, with bands trotting out the predictable ""Sweet Home Chicago"" b.s. night after night like Chuck E. Cheese automatrons. There's a reason why black musicians moved on to soul, funk, jazz fusion and rock --- because the blues stopped being innovative beyond Hendrix.  But there are still great musicians who breathe some life into this old folk form and make for a great show. It's a helluva lot grittier than Vegas  (go back to the food window and the cook will scare the bejeezus out of you), and in that sense, an essential experience.",0.9531,0.785,0.175,0.04,0.47420634920634924

Beer was on the expensive side, but looking around you'll see lots of older businessmen drinking Goose Island or ladies with a glass of wine so you might expect alittle higher pricing. There are 2 rooms that alternate acts, so you never have to choose. The bands there can play, not only do they still get some semi-famous acts, the local openers can play a mean Gibson too. Lots of smoke hanging in the air, the owner even made fun of those who were bothered by it while introducing one of the acts. Thats part of the atmosphere I guess.

Muddy Waters' was shredding on lead and Howlin' Wolf was waiting to go on stage next. But now, Kingston Mines has become more touristy than the Sears Tower. The music is still pretty good, I'll give it that, but unless you want to share it with some out of town business-men in suits and a drunk couple from Sheboygan, then Kingston Mines has simply fallen from grace. It's strongsuits: It has two stages, so the music goes constantly; it stays open until 4 am, and most days you can get in for free with a student ID.
