It's better than most Chinese spots in the loop (not exactly a compliment), and the line is never that long. Even if it is, they move people through quickly. Restaurant is down an alley off LaSalle, and kinda dingy on the inside. Maybe that's why I don't stay to eat or meet people there.  Spicy chicken is my favorite dish, but sweet & sour chicken is a close second. Lunch special is a ton of food, and I usually replace the egg roll with a crab rangoon because I like those better. Chicken fried rice is also pretty good, but can make an already heavy meal super heavy with the upgrade. I'm never able to finish even half of a meal here, so it's a bargain.

It had been nearly 3 years since I had left that job and Silk Road along with it.  But now, after another new job, I have returned to the area, only about 1/2 mile away.  I found that during my 3 year hiatus I would frequently dream of enjoying the Spicy Chicken once again, and I must say that the wait was worth it.  The .5 mile walk just flies by on the wings of a hunger void that can only be filled with Spicy Chicken. Though it is inexpensive, it is not a ""cheap"" lunch, at least not for a nonprofit employee.  For the lawyers nearby, the ~$9 for Spicy Chicken, Rice and an Egg Roll is no big thing, but for me it is a once weekly splurge.  Friday is the day to go, as Spicy Chicken is the special and that saves you about a dollar. I have never tried anything else at this establishment, but the Spicy Chicken makes it.  I would guess that about 75% of the people I observe while there are eating this delicious dish.  And if the casual observations of a die-hard Silk Road Spicy Chicken partisan fanboy are not enough to convince you, I don't know what is.   If you are anywhere near here, just go.  I am quite sure you will not be disappointed.",0.9778,0.849,0.116,0.035,0.6252106316622444

I get my lunch here because it's quick. I always get Chicken Fried Rice, and they always have it ready-cooked (and yes, that means that sometimes it's not-so-warm). By the time I've gotten my change back from the cashier, the staff has already scooped my food into a container and is ready to hand it to me. When I need lunch in a hurry, I like that a lot. As far as the food goes, I think the Chicken Fried Rice is fine. I've had better, but I've also had worse. I tried the Orange Chicken once, and I agree with Lara W, it was awful. I've never tried the legendary Spicy Chicken. (After the Orange Chicken experience, I decided play it safe and stick with the Chicken Fried Rice for a while.) As other reviewers have said, the portions are large--large enough that before you eat everything in one sitting, you may want to think about how your stomach would feel about it.
