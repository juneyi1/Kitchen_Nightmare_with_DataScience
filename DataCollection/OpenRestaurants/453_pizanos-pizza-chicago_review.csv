2017-09-02,1.0,"My wife and I ordered a large mushroom and onion thin crust pizza for delivery last night.  We usually order from Malnati's but thought we would try Pizano's for a change. We had ordered from their Glenview store on a regular basis when we lived there and consistently enjoyed it. Unfortunately we did not have the same experience last night. The pizza was very over baked, dry, and extremely greasy all the way through to the bottom of the crust. There did not seem to be any onions and the mushrooms were almost unrecognizable, probably because it was so over cooked. The pizza, which was on the small size for a large, took an hour and 10 minutes to arrive priced at $32.00 and change plus standard $5.00 tip. That was almost $40.00 for a very unsatisfying pie. Any number of frozen supermarket pizzas would have been more satisfying for a fraction of the cost. I don't understand how a restaurant can allow food like that to be served to their customers. It really is disrespectful. Needless to say we won't be ordering from this restaurant again.",0.9159,0.9,0.083,0.016,0.46461996336996336

The server spilled quite a bit of beer from my fiances glass onto the floor and table.  Food: Eh. I don't know why Oprah raves about this crust. It takes like every thin crust in Chicago. I think it is pretty weird to have the pepperoni's under the cheese, kind of hard to eat it pulls all the cheese off with it when you take a bite.

2017-07-23,5.0,"""So fresh!"" That's what all the folks at our table kept saying about our pizzas - from the perfume of the basil, to the tangy and bright tomato sauces, the flavorful meats and the rich cheese - ""fresh"" was the word on the tip of everyone's tongues. That, and awesome pizza! We were dining with a once-a-week regular of the restaurant, so we were able to score the prime window seat overlooking State Street. We were immediately greeted by our thickly-accented waiter, who reminded us all of Lou Costello, of ""Abbott and Costello"" fame. Far less ""comedic"" than the actor, this gentleman was all business - super attentive, without hovering, efficiently topping off our boozy bar drinks with a simple glance and a nod.  Since the thick crust pizza typically takes about thirty to forty minutes to bake, we placed our order for a customized medium deep dish ($28) of pepperoni, sausage, green pepper and mushroom. We also ordered a medium thin crust pie - the Meat Lovers ($26)- topped with sausage, bacon, pepperoni, Canadian bacon, with added mushrooms. We started with the Pizano's Chopped Salad ($14) which was large enough for all four guests to have a nice appetizer-sized bowl - the chopped lettuce, basil, salami and chicken breast was colored with fresh tomato dices and pieces of firm mozzarella cheese. The entire bowl was lightly (and perfectly) tossed in an Italian-style dressing, and topped with finely sliced scallions. Again, the freshness was clearly evident and everyone raved about the portion size. We've now made this salad a regular addition to our pizza outings. Our pizzas arrive after only 25 minutes and we dove in - we all decided the crisp, crumbly, wonderfully-buttery crust of the thin crust version was our hands down favorite. The fresh tomato sauce was lightly applied and the fragrance of warm basil really stood out. The meats all tasted different, as they should, but the spicy, flavorful sausage took center stage. Oddly enough, the crust on Pizano's deep dish pizza isn't much different from the thin crust. For the deep dish, the crust runs up the side of the pizza about an inch - but it's certainly not thick, like some of those other bread-like offerings across the city. The thick crust also bakes up far less buttery than the thin version, featuring more of a fresh olive-oil flavor throughout the dough. The other visible differences include the chunkier tomato sauce and thick slices of mozzarella under all the toppings, not on top. While $54 sounds like a lot to drop on two medium pizzas, there will be leftovers! The squares of the thin crust pizza heat up perfectly in a stove-top cast iron skillet set to medium-high, and the deep dish slices fared well in a 350º oven on a simple baking sheet. We managed two lunches off the leftovers alone. Go early. Go often! Just save me the window seat.",0.9779,0.884,0.088,0.028,0.5606927680698174

2017-06-21,3.0,"Tasty pizza. Loved the buttery crust!  We had the deep dish ""Hey Hey"" which was sausage and mushrooms and we added garlic.  People need to realize the pizza categorized as ""deep dish"" is not going to be a three inch pile of cheese like other places-- it's a little thinner and you can actually pick it up if you so desired. I enjoy this more than eating a heaping plate of melted cheese .  Don't get me wrong I love A good thick deep dish but generally I can only have a slice without being too full.  Any place can fire up some cheese in an oven and serve it --but to me a great pizza place has a good crust and good sauce. Pizanos has the crust and the sauce down.  The only reason I am taking away stars is because of our female server who seemed bitter and pissed off that I came here to eat with my two daughters on a Monday night without ordering more than two glasses of wine. I asked her a question about one of the menu items and she rolled her eyes at me. When my daughter asked her if they could do a half order of the gnocchi she was annoyed and said ""we don't do half orders and we don't have kid items""... most good servers answer that they will ask or that they will see what they can do but she was just crabby.

However, my waiter informed me that despite it being on the menu, they didn't offer that at this location? He said he could do a crust with sausage instead so I took up his offer. However, when I got the pizza it was a personal size which is not what I ordered, I had ordered the one that would feed 2. He apologized for his mistake then came back and said we could offer you free dessert but we don't have anything gluten free so there's nothing we could do for you.

2016-06-07,1.0,"The story of Chicago Deep Dish Pizza is long and fabled, with some very distinguished entrepreneurs garnishing its glorious history like gems along a golden path. For ages I have been enjoying real Chicago Deep Dish Pizza since I was fortunate enough to live in the city, and around the corner from Ike Sewell, the founder of Uno's and Due's Pizza, and some other formidable Chicago restaurants. I have eaten pizza all over the world, and I still believe Chicago has, by far, the very best pizza in the world.  After having said that, this review is sadly about a pizza place my wife and I truly loved, and it was our ""go to"" pizza place, especially for late night delivery. I must use the past tense, since the pizza no longer resembles its past form. I am writing about Pizano's Pizza, and specifically, their alleged ""Deep Dish"" pizza. My wife and I ordered a ""Deep Dish"" pizza from Pizano's very recently, and when it arrived, I went to the door to grab the pizza. When I grabbed the box I was shocked, it was nearly weightless.  A large alleged ""Deep Dish"" pizza that seemed to weigh what a small thin crust would weigh. In the past, when I grabbed the box from the delivery person, it was heavy, weighty and had the heft of a real meal. This last pizza was so incredibly thin, thinner than the width of my little pinky finger, I called and reported it to their manager. Well, they sent a second pizza free of charge, which was identically disappointing, and just as thin, like a thin crust, not anything like a real ""Deep Dish"" pizza. The two pizzas together didn't amount to one actual ""Deep Dish Pizza."" I'd hate to see their thin crust now, it must be microscopic. My wife actually waited up past her bedtime to see the second pizza Pizano's delivered since she too believed Pizano's accidentally sent us a thin crust. Much to our dismay, that was their new ""Deep Dish"" pizza.  We will never eat at a Pizano's again, and we used to eat there all the time since my office is a block from their downtown location. And we will definitely never order a pizza from them again. I give Pizano's Zero Stars for their alleged ""Deep Dish"" style pizza, and I am very sad that they chose to reduce their ingredients to the point that the pizza has no ""Deep Dish"" credibility any longer.

However, when it came out it was burned and DRY!!  When we told the bartender that the pizza was BURNED he said it was supposed to be that way (black pepperoni's, burned black crust and dried out tomatoes)!!!  Obviously he didn't give a $#*+!  The owner was listening in and he didn't say a word?  Can you believe that?!?  Pizza is SUPPOSED to be burned?!?!  Ok so they did take the burned pizza off of our bill.  Anyway...he asked if we wanted it to go so I told my husband we could give it to a homeless person.  My husband said that a homeless person would rather have a dollar than this piece of $@""@&.  Our recommendation -- go to Lou's!",0.8529,0.915,0.068,0.018,0.506060606060606

This first time we happened upon it because we were staying at a hotel down the street and were looking for authentic Chicago pizza. I say Chicago pizza, and not ""Chicago style"" pizza. There are plenty of restaurants across the country that claim to have ""Chicago style"" pizza, but there are very few that have true Chicago pizza. This place is definitely one. My husband had never had Chicago pizza and was blown away. All other pizzas just don't taste the same. We were hopeful that our second visit almost a year later could live up to our first phenomenal visit. We were not disappointed. We ordered the Brickhouse and it was awesome! Be prepared to wait the 30 minutes it takes to prepare the deep dish, but it is well worth it. We took our last couple of pieces on the 1000+ mile journey back home with us and kicked ourselves for not ordering another pizza to go once we ate our snack. Yes, it is just that delicious. Crunchy crust on the bottom but yet tender on the inside and oozing with toppings and cheese. If you don't like your pizza crust as toasty on the bottom, just let them know to cut down the baking time by about 5 minutes. We love a crunchy crust, so it was perfect.  Our bartender Brian waited on us both times, and he was wonderful. Brian was witty and attentive, but yet not intrusive.  We loved the mostly Frank Sinatra/Rat Pack music and the whimsical photos plastered on the walls. Our only constructive criticism that we have for Pizano's is that their drink prices are a little pricey for a pizza place. Either double the alcohol or lower the price.

To be honest, I read that most Chicagoans wouldn't rank the big deep dish joints as their favorite pizza place, and I can see why. It's thanks to joints like Pizano's that gives deep dish pizza a run for their money. My friend and I dropped in on a Saturday evening and were seated at the bar immediately. For tables, there would have been a wait, but there was no line compared to other pizza joints in the area. We ordered a caesar salad, a large Pat's Brickhouse Special (Sausage and mushrooms), and two beers on tap (each was $5.50 btw, a great deal) The salad was great with a helping of freshly, grated cheese on top. It was a nice appetizer for what would be the main dish. After about 30 minutes, our glorious pizza arrived, and holy cow- it was GOOD. The pizza had everything I wanted. The crust wasn't super thin, and had a buttery taste that actually made me want to finish all of my crust. The cheese layer on top was coated perfectly, and somehow even the sausage and mushrooms on top tasted better than what I've had at most places!

The blue cheese was watery. We placed the pizza order while we were waiting for a table due to the 30-35 minute cook time. The pizza selected was the tomato basil and garlic deep dish. This did not disappoint. Delicious! The perfect balance between the 3 ingredients atop a thick layer of melted mozzarella cheese.

2014-10-28,1.0,"This place is remarkably bad. the pizza is pretty marginal, not amazing but not the worst. Sauce is pretty decent. The biggest problem with this place is service. Every tuesday night its college night and you get free pizza with a drink order. Usually the service is meh(including a very long wait for a table). However the last time we went was a hot mess. First every server has different rules for ordering on college night, some will tell you that its a medium for two people and then others will try and say a medium for five people. They will get mad at you if you point out a table with more pizza per person and give you some arbitrary rule that will be negated by the next server you ask. They don't seem do have any of this written anywhere for customers to see so its frustrating when the servers become rude when you ask for a normal amount of food.  So, after being seated in the basement and being told many different things we finally got a large pizza for five people. Once getting food, our server did not check on our table even once to refill our drinks or ask if we needed anything. Apparently the soda machine was broken and instead of going upstairs to the working machine and drinks the servers just ignored any thirsty customers.  The pizza for our table also took an obnoxiously long time. --READ THIS PART-- The final issue that earned this place its 1 star rating is when we got the check. As a group of four we ordered 4 sodas and 1 water because it was part of the deal that to get food you had to get a drink and any time before we were told that it had to be a soda because water is free. Well, this time we were charged for 5 sodas so we politely asked if they could take one off, no harm, right? well they insisted that water was 2.50, which as an establishment that also serves alcohol, I'm pretty sure is not allowed. 2 servers argued with us and then we asked to see the manager who was very passive aggressive and insisted that everything that came in a cup was 2.50. Again, something that is never stated or written anywhere. As he begrudgingly agreed and walked away we all could here him say ""f*ck them"" which was a nice touch(according to other people who have been there it is common for him to refer to women as c**ts) the manager seems like a real swell guy. After we got our fixed check (with a hand written 18% tip added) we handed over our card and apparently it took 4 servers crowded around the machine and about 10 minute to figure out. We saw them swipe the card multiple times and are suspicious. The server also took the liberty of writing in her own 10 dollar tip where the customer is supposed to write the tip and total, so naturally we crossed that out and gave them no tip for poor service. Still waiting to hear from friend how many times her card was charged.  overall horrible place and people and will never go back, would gladly pay more money to be treated like a human.",0.1225,0.789,0.105,0.106,0.5741636141636142

They have the best, slightly buttery, but definitely crispy crust. The sauce is equally good - caution, if you prefer a blended smooth sauce, you might not be a fan. Their sauce has tiny little pieces of tomato. It takes about 30 minutes to make their thin crust, but you can order while waiting to be seated. It's nothing fancy, think red-checked table cloth - but a cute, pizza place. Worth a visit if you are a pizza fan visiting chicago!",0.9764,0.722,0.238,0.04,0.6144444444444445
2014-09-19,2.0,"There's too much pizza in Chicago. Every Italian family has a hand in the business, and so every founder is some relative of an original (OG) pizzarian. The credibility floating around any pizza joint is so pervasive it becomes counter productive. There are a million OG recipes in Chicago. Anyway, Pizano's isn't one of the good OG recipes. This location is always packed, which doesn't have much explanation other than: (1) these are all relatives of the owner, and/or (2) Lou Malnati's a couple blocks up has too long of a wait. The crust of the thin pizza is flaky, almost grainy. Maybe the deep dish is better, maybe. Calamari could use a lot of work. You'd think pizza joints in Chicago would've started sharing best-practices by now, even if it means altering a great-great uncle's OG recipe.",0.9042,0.887,0.099,0.013,0.4395833333333334

2014-08-29,3.0,I ordered from here based on location to my hotel and information provided by yelp. I wanted a true Chicago pizza experience but am perplexed by what it ended up.  I ordered a medium cheese and medium pepperoni. They said 30 minutes. I walked with my son to go pick them up. It was a 10 minute walk.  We were greeted upon entering. It was really easy to find. A big green sign on the outside of the building. The pizzas were done exactly when promised. I wish we could have eaten there. I loved the Chicago ambiance. Set up like a bar/ pizza place with photos of celebrities who dined there.  What I'm disappointed with was the pizza. The crust to be exact. I ordered thin crust. It's thin but not too thin. The crust is really buttery. Too buttery. It's crispy but weird. Almost a buttery fried texture. The toppings and sauce were wonderful.

I never really like Chicago pizza very much.  I didn't even like lou malnati, although every one seems to think that pizza is the greatest deep dish ever!

The pizza cost $24, which was way overpriced, IMO. However, the three cheese tortellini (that our dinner mates ordered)was out of this world. I ordered the Maria's Special Tortellini and that was good too,but the 3 cheese was amazing. I would highly recommend either of these dishes. Also worth noting is their home made Root Beer. It is very good.  Our server, ""The Chauch"" graciously gave us the cookie dessert, on the house. Even though we were stuffed, it was so delicious we could not help devouring it.

2014-08-24,4.0,"Pizano's Pizza & Pasta presents an interesting quandary to its patrons...is it best to order their deep dish or thin crust pizza?  Surely, a restaurant owned by Rudy Malnati Jr, - son of Pizzeria Uno founder, Rudy Malnati Sr. - must make some pretty excellent deep dish pizza.  However, their thin crust pizza has been listed in the top ten in the Nation by USA Today and is apparently Oprah's favorite.  Personally, I was stumped, so I went with the advice of our waiter and tried their thin crust.    I'm sure I would have been happy with either option, but our waiter's recommendation definitely didn't disappoint me.  The most impressive thing about Pizano's thin crust pizza is that it somehow manages to keep the consistency and flavor of a traditional Chicago-style deep dish crust in its compact form.  Perhaps this is because Donna Marie Malnati, Rudy Malnati Sr.'s widow, is said to still be fashioning dough balls from their old secret family recipe in the basement of Pizano's Pizza & Pasta on State Street.  The sausage was also really good on this pizza, and its flavor may have been allowed to stand out even more since it was on a thin crust pizza.  If you want a thinner pizza that still maintains some of the typical Chicago flavor, then Pizano's Pizza & Pasta is your place (Giordano's thin crust is good but doesn't necessarily have the same flavor, and I did not enjoy the thin crust pizza from Gino's East).  They also have other items on their menu that did not interest me as much as pizza, and their cheesy garlic bread was a good appetizer.",0.9864,0.828,0.149,0.023,0.6289173789173791

2014-08-18,1.0,"First, based on the very slow service that I experienced, well is what I observed from the two people sitting next to me - all of us seem to get the same slow service.  I would bet they just don't have enough people back there cooking and they're just too busy with whatever they're doing because my relatively simple order took a long time.   I ordered the chicken Parmesan sandwich - with french fries . While the french fries were excellent , hot and tasty , the Parmesan sandwich was overcooked and dry. I said I think the scene I would've made if I had sent it back and realizing that I would have to leave - not wanting to invest another 45 minutes in their marginal cooking/ service.  I made a terrible mistake and placed a simultaneous to go order - don't do this, eat your meal and then decide whether or not the food is good enough to place a to go order on top of what you're eating in the restaurant - you will save money and misery as a result.   I was annoyed enough with the chicken Parmesan sandwich that I ordered after the fact, a dish of marinara sauce to dip in what should have had marinara sauce on it the first place - only to wait a minimum of 10 minutes and maybe 15 minutes for that marinara sauce to be brought to the table . I guess it takes a while to go to the grocery store to get some?  I also ordered for take out -  planning to jam it in my hotel refrigerator for later meals - and found out that the meatball sandwich I ordered for later, was also a bit dry and lacking sauce. I don't know if it's a difference of expectations here , cooking style or whatever but I've had much better for much less money then their premium priced menu items.  I also ordered an Italian sub which remains untouched in refrigerator, but most likely it will underwhelm as well.  Save your money. Go somewhere else. Lou Malnatti or Connie's Pizza for example. Yuck. At least I didn't get sick from the food.   That's right, they are expensive.  So in summary, I paid twice here:  - Once with my money, and  - once with my patience and time.  Also, a nice couple sitting next to me had a similar experience that in observed from three get away, so my experience was not something unique to me in this restaurant.

I usually eat at Giordano s which in my opinion was so far superior to this place so let's just get right to it.  The good news is the place had a short wait. Well good and bad because all the good places have an hour wait. So we walk in and immediately we are met by a sloppy, slick back haired, obnoxious host? Named Ross. If I were to say he was snide that would be an understatement. He prepped me though for the over rated pizza that was to arrive. We ordered wings,  mozzarella sticks, pepperoni pizza and a salad. Salad was boring but good. Dressing was good. Mozzarella sticks were horrible.  Pizza was dry there was maybe 10 to 15 slices of pepperoni on the pie. The actual cheese was the best part of the pizza. The wings were average and the blue cheese on the side was gross. When I tell you that this place is not what Chicago pizza is about ...save your money and spend it at Giordano' s it will be a longer wait but the staff is friendlier and the pizza is amazing.

The cost:  If you're looking to get some bang for your buck, then do NOT come here.  The ""medium"" pizza is actually a small pizza (you're not fooling anyone, Pizanos) and will cost you nearly $20.  I will specifically walk 1 block more to Lou's and/or Gio's for more pizza at a reasonable price, that is most definitely comparable, if not better.   They also do not let you use credit cards if your order is under $20, which federal law actually regulates this to only be allowed for purchases $10 or less.  One time, the waitress actually suggested that we each had to leave a LARGER tip to make the minimum, which made me actually want to tip her less.  Pizanos, get with the times.   Credit cards are what people pay with and you need to accept it.  I've actually avoided your establishment multiple times (which is sad bc I live in the building above you) before bc I found it to be too big of a hassle to go find an ATM too.",-0.4909,0.803,0.092,0.104,0.4024553571428571

2013-11-18,1.0,"""The best thin crust in Chicago"".  My review is going to be hard on them because of how high up on the pedestal they put themselves. First, the food.  I know it takes 40 minutes to cook a deep dish pizza and that is fine but it should never take 40 minutes to cook a thin crust pizza or your doing something wrong.  I would love to talk about the taste of the pizza but the pizza was way too hot which burnt all my taste buds and I was unable to taste anything for the next 24 hours.  Also took forever to get me a pint of Sam Adams. Second, the atmosphere.  Tables and chairs are uncomfortable and old.  The old guy that was the host was annoying (hire a hot 18 year old like everyone else please).   The decor was old and not charming.  The place felt cramped. The only good thing I have to say was the waiter was a nice guy.  Maybe a bit too old to be a waiter at a small restaurant.",0.636,0.807,0.107,0.085,0.5524074074074073

But I guess after all the hype, I thought it would be better than good. Better than decent.  I thought the crust at Pizano's was too buttery. I never thought I would say something was too buttery. But yup. It was. I did like Pizano's thin crust better than their deep dish pizza. I'm not sure if the thin crust was overcooked, or if the dough-master had an off day, but it was nothing to write home about.  OH we tried a pasta dish too. It was not done well. Haha.

2013-10-21,4.0,"We went downtown this weekend for the Chicago Chocolate Tour. Our last stop on our Chocolate tour was More cupcakes at the corner of State and Delaware and once we wrapped up our visit to More, we wanted to find a place nearby for lunch/dinner. My poor hubby missed the Bears game up until this point, but luckily there was another gentleman on our tour that had the game on his cell phone, so we were keeping up with the action! Being that we were dressed for walking in the city, we couldn't necessarily go anywhere too fancy for dinner, so we wanted a casual/come-as-you-are spot. We peeked around the corner on State Street and there was Pizano's! I had heard of it, but never been. Growing up in the Chicagoland area, we ate a LOT of pizza as kids. Rosati's, Uncle Pete's in Addison, even the occasional White Cottage.  As an adult, I'm a huge fan of Little Sicily in Schaumburg. Not only is it practically walking distance for us, but they make a mean pie! I enjoy making pizza at home and tossing around the dough, rolling it out and adding my toppings to my desired taste, but there is no chance I'll ever be able to make a deep dish at home from scratch so I rely on Chicago pizza places to do this for me.  After a long afternoon of sweets, chocolates, desserts and other candies, I needed something salty and delicious. Get me some pizza, S.T.A.T.! We wandered down State and jogged across the street to Pizano's. I wasn't sure what to expect because I didn't take my usual time to look them up on Yelp and see if it was worth our time. I'm so glad we walked in this place! The bar was packed with Chicago Bears' fans along with a few Dallas Cowboys' fans cheering on their respective teams, the front dining room was full and we were given the option of sitting in the back or waiting for a spot to open up in the front. Fully knowing that everyone up front was watching the game, we gladly accepted the table in the back. Sadly, my trooper of a husband discovered the lack of a T.V. in the back room. He was really great about it, though. We were just hungry and wanted to eat a nice meal before heading home for the evening. I gave him the ok to go watch the game several times and he was so cute and chose to sit with me instead. We'll that was unless there was screaming in the bar, I insisted he go check it out.  We ordered a Sprite and a ginger ale. I asked the server to find out if the ginger ale was caffeinated or not and it turned out that it was, so I just stuck with the H20. After a long day of walking around and trying not to drink too much water as to avoid multiple potty breaks, I needed the water anyways. I tasted the Sprite and I have to say, it tasted icky to me. I'm guessing the lines need to be cleaned, if I were to go out on a limb. We decided to get a deep dish sausage pizza even tho the menu clearly states it takes 30 minutes and we were starving. I figured, if we're at a new place in the city, we gotta do it right. It took a bit longer than 30 minutes, probably closer to 45-50 so I wasn't crazy about that, but it was worth the wait. It was perfectly prepared. The crust on deep dish pizzas can often be burnt along the top edge and ours was absolutely PERFECT! I don't actually eat the crust unless it looks good and I did taste theirs...it was very nice. About 15 minutes after ordering, I ordered a cup of their Italian Wedding soup to fill the time and to warm up. It didn't look appetizing at all, but it tasted wonderful. It was served at a perfect soup temperature to me (ie. Almost burning the roof of your mouth, but not quite). It had 2 little meatballs in it. I would have liked a third or fourth, but I cut up what was in there and made them last a little longer. The spinach leaves in the soup were not overcooked and tasted great! We will definitely be back to Pizano's. Next time, I want to sit in the bar area. The whole place has a great Chicago feel with all the sports teams' memorabilia on the walls and the old bar set up...it's a classic. Looking forward to the next time we want pizza in the city.

Service was excellent.  Deep dish- mushroom, tomatoe, cheese- very heavy dish but that's to be expected. It is not greasy however, they just use a lot of moza. Tomatoe was fresh and wonderfully halfcooked because its juice flavoured the pizza complementing the cheese and mushroom which was equally juicy. I could taste all the toppings were fresh and the crust... I had never tasted a crust that's supposed to be bread but almost tasted like pie crust but not being too greasy. I have no idea what they use to make the crust, I'm thinking there's a little Parmesan in it.     Thin crust pizza- a little lighter than the deep dish as the cheese is thinly laid. Crust fresh and soft.  Homemade gnocchi in a pesto cream sauce was incredible. Very soft and slightly sweet melt in your mouth potato pasta. Mom was impressed as well as she's tried many fresh pastas.  Pizano- a definite must visit.

We were told that it was our mistake and argued with about the dressing we ordered on the side.  The woman on the phone very rudely told us that our salads would be delivered in return for the caesar salads. An hour later our salads arrived, but without any dressing.  We called back and spoke with the woman who answered the phone.  We explained what happened and asked if some dressing could be delivered.  She passed the phone on to another woman in which we explained the same thing to.  She then passed us on to the manager, Sally.  We then explained the situation to Sally and expressed our frustration that we were talking to so many people, only to get dressing delivered.  We were asked what our problem was, and that we first ordered caesar salads and changed our mind to BBQ chicken salads, which was not the case.  We ordered BBQ chicken salads from the beginning.  We asked why we were being talked to so rudely.  Sally claimed that we needed to order the ranch dressing specially and told us that dressing would be an additional charge, however the salad was delivered with BBQ sauce.  My friend orders from Pizano's every week, the same salad, and had never been treated this badly.  Sally's last comment was, ""If I could get off the phone with you then I could call the delivery guy to get you your dressing."" We hung up thanking her for her attitude and waiting another 45 minutes for our dressing.  Our original order was at 5:30 pm.  We did not eat until 8:30 pm.  We expressed to Sally that this was awful customer service and extremely disrespectful.  She claimed that the next time we came in that our meal would be comped.  Well Sally, we're coming for it.",-0.9576,0.896,0.029,0.076,0.5105175983436853

Service Waiter was super friendly and for the most part attentive (he went MIA when we wanted to ask for the bill). Prices: Super reasonable...it was like $20 per person and that included 2 pies, 2 appetizers, and sodas. Either way, If you go to Chicago you must stop here for some deep dish.

The food is good, and the action at the bar, where patrons can settle in and watch the big game, remains lively throughout the night, especially when a the game is close.  Pizano's, owned by Rudy Malnati Jr., son of pizza legend Lou Malnati, offers the same pizza as Lou Malnati's, in addition to a selection of pasta and Italian chicken classics. From my experiences, the chicken parmesan is about the best around. The large piece of white meat chicken is perfectly breaded with a hint of garlic, topped with mozzarella cheese and finished with a wonderfully thick meat sauce. While the chicken dishes are great, the pastas aren't slouches. The sauces are thick and flavorful by themselves, but for a little extra zip, diners can order sides of sausage, meatballs, meat or marinara sauce and/or the fresh vegetable of the day. Of course, there is the famous Malnati pizza, with big chunks of tomato paste and fabulously flavorful sausage that is thick and meaty without being knock-out spicy.  Pizano's buttery, cheesy garlic bread joins the chicken parmesan in the ""best I've ever had club"". The bread boasts a crispy crust, with a soft, hot, garlicky inside.

That being said, the pizza arrives at the table in the deep dish pan from which we try to remove slices for our plates. The crust was really hard, which was surprising because I imagined it would be soft and buttery from reading other deep-dish reviews. As I cut through my piece, I made all kinds of noise as the butter knife broke through the crust and hit my plastic plate. There was a ton of cheese and if I had picked the cheese up with my fingers, I could have removed it all at once as it was like a tough layer of mozzarella and reminded me of a large wad of chewed bubble gum.

I'll admit, I'll probably never be a fan of deep dish over NY style, but I love pizza to no end, so I've got to have some opinion on the deep dish. Our pizza came with basil, sliced tomatoes, sausage, and garlic. It was pretty good, but I couldn't have more than one slice in a sitting. The deep dish is so heavy on everything, which I understand people enjoy. There was a thick layer of cheese and the crust was almost like a buttery biscuit.  Anyways, to avoid turning this into a Deep Dish vs NY style thing, I'll say that it did taste good and I hope to try more deep dish in the future.

After experiencing what I call the most ""mind-blowing"" deep dish pizza from L'Appetito, I immediately put 20 years of NY pizza to rest and had arms wide open for Chicago pizza. I couldn't wait to have another slice from some of the best Chicago has to offer...only to be disappointed. I walked all the way from the Grand Station area (which I shouldn't complain much, but my feet were hurting), eager to finally have a real pizza meal in Chicago. We were seated immediately in the back room, a really nice and warm room.  As usual, I go for the extraordinary so we got the Mark's Special 10"". I'm glad we got the smallest one because anymore, we wouldn't eat 75% of it. We opted for an extra mushroom topping and right away, I knew about one and a half mushrooms were used. There were about 5 slices...so much for that extra $1.90. I was so disappointed... is this what a deep dish pizza is? The cheese only filled up half of the pie. I used to loathe the nasty packaged pepperoni deep dish pizza pies served in school, but this is worse.  The pizza itself was way overdone with garlic, was way too watery, way too dry...like dried, 3-day old bread. We also had garlic bread, which was nothing special yet had little to no garlic. I wonder if I ordered the right thing or not. I'm not quite sure what the ""proper"" way of eating Chicago-style pizza is, but I picked it up with my hands like a New Yorker, while everyone else seemed to cut it up like a delicate piece of steak. The wait for my pizza was way too long and I ended up disappointed.

2012-06-21,5.0,Second review for Pizano's.  This has become our pizza place for downtown - surpassing Gino's East.  The pizza just taste different than any other pizza I've tasted.  It's incredible - something to long for!  Great staff and service - keeps your drinks full before they hit the bottom.  Love the stuffed pizza.  I can't help but describe it as eating pizza on top of buttered movie theater popcorn.  It's amazing.  You can cut the edge of the crust with your fork. It just breaks away.  Amazing food.  I recommended adding the garlic and basil to whatever you normally get on your pizza.  They put basil leaves on the pizza.  A+.,0.9514,0.798,0.167,0.035,0.59375

This was my first deep dish pizza in Chicago; compared to Zachary's in Oakland and little star pizza in sf, the deep dish at pizano had lighter toppings but overall the pizza got soggy too quickly. My first slice was good but by the time I had my second slice I only ate the toppings. I was starving so this did satisfy me; if I wasn't starving I think this place would be 3 or 3.5 stars as I liked the Bay Area deep dish pizzas more.

I am not a deep dish guy- I grew up in the shadow of NYC and to me, that's what pizza is: large triangles of  greasy, foldy, orangish melty zingy tomoato-ey thin crusted goodness. But when in the Chi, I'll always get a deep dish and enjoy it as what it is: a non- pizza food product that lies somewhere between a calzone and a bread lasagna. Typically, Malnati's or Giordano's hit me off proper like. However, when i phoned the front desk of the W and asked who the best deep dish delivery folk were, they were quick with Pizano's. So I ordered for delivery, got the Rudy (a meat/veggie blend) and was oh-so super excited to devour. It was HORRIBLE. Unedible, and I was half drunk. And I'm chubby. Typically, in Jonny Algebra 101, (Half drunk + chubby + hotel room) x late night delivery = massive gorge fest.  I fully expected to take down three quarters of the pie and pass out. I couldnt even get down one piece. It tasted rancid. Nastasaurus Rex.  I feel bad because I hate giving one star reviews, and I don't expect my experience to be representative of the Pizano's whole.

I'm sure on most nights Pizano's has a line out the door.  The pizza came out piping hot with gooey cheese. Since this was my first time eating an authentic Chicago Deep Dish, the first bite seriously was amazing. The crust was crunchy, not bread-like. The cheesy was plentiful and the sauce was more mellow/bland. BUT, as I kept eating, I also noticed that they definitely left out the sausage and this was a vegetarian pizza AND that as I ate the crust on it's own, it had a slight bitter aftertaste to it like too much baking soda in a cookie.

The two pizzas are very similar but Pizano's has the edge in the crust arena.  I went on Saturday and Grandma Malnati was actually in the basement rolling the dough....Who knows if that is actually true, but that's what we were told.

And Oprah says their thin crust is the best in the city but seeing as I haven't tried it yet, I can't verify that. I do blindly follow everything Oprah says though, so let's just say it's the best thin crust in the city. :) The sausage on their deep dish is delicious and the pizza overall is fantastic!

A friend with us who'd been there before asked for extra sauce to be added to the pizza, having told us that they could get very dry here, and what arrived was just a regular amount of sauce, so I guess he was right (or they ignored our request, which is another matter). The crust was a bit dry, hard and flour-y, not the delectable butter-flavored amazingness that I prefer out of Lou Malnati's.  The crust was also incredibly salty. After a few bites, I was thinking just that when another friend blurted it out. It was that way on all our pizzas. Definitely took away from the experience.  Cutting it was somehow so tough that all the toppings just fell away from the crust, and you were left with a slab of hard bread. Once you got all this mess in your mouth, it was not terrible, but not the transcendental experience I'd come to expect from deep dish. The thin crust was not as salty, but it was also not that thin. Looked more like a less-thick crust (think Pizza Hut pan pizza rather than NY slice). This place does have an old-school Italian family eatery vibe, so I'll add a star for that, but yeah, I'd rank it wayyyy below Malnati's (any location), below Giordano's, and about on par with Geno's--whose pizza is better but atmosphere and wait times are meh.",0.8655,0.87,0.076,0.054,0.5413721611721612

Yes the crust was buttery, but rather thick to be categorized as a Chicago thin crust.  It reminded me of a Lou Malnati's deep dish dough, without the deep dish.  I enjoyed it, but the flavor profile and the texture was strange to me.  The sausage was not the plump well seasoned nuggets I am used to and the shrooms didn't add anything to the flavor profile.

It was filled to the max with Italian meets, provolone and a salad base. Now it is not set out all fancy like a display plate. It is tossed together in a nice Italian dressing as a salad- a very hearty salad.  Following that, we had the Chicago deep dish with sausage, mushroom, and cheese on the butter crust. We were tipped off to ask for the butter crust, apparently it is not advertised. I cannot even tell you how yummy this was! Our eyes were certainly larger than our stomachs! The sauce was amazing and did not take over the pizza. The toppings were fresh and of really good, quality. The mozzarella cheese was melty, stringy and yummy. I think the only down mark I would say is they could go a little more on the sausage and mushroom- they seemed a little light on it. Other than that, so yummy.

With that lineage, the pizza really had to shine. And it did. I had a medium thin crust cheese pizza and it was divine.  One downside for me was the amount of butter they used.  It was SO greasy.  I honestly thought I would suffer later (you know, stomach cramps, etc) due to the amount of grease, but I was fine.  It was very delicious though, dare I say luscious? The other downside is that I wanted to eat in, but it was too busy.  I had to take my pizza to go and it took about 10 minutes longer than the time they promised to get my pizza.

Our waiter checked back often, refilled our waters constatnly, kept checking to make sure we were ok, ect...(and it was busy that day) When we finished our bruschetta, the dirty plates were cleared right away which I'm a huge fan of having that done! The Brushetta was good. Definately LOADED with tomatoes  in comparison to what I'm used to seeing. But that did cause the bread to get a bit soggy, which wasn't as pleasant to eat.  The Deep Dish pizza was good. Keep in mind that if you order what they call a ""specialty pizza"" they won't let you customize it (ie..take off mushrooms) which I found odd, but whatever I'm okay with picking around certain foods I don't eat anyways. The crust was buttery tasting and very crnchy and thick at the endwhere it folds upward. It was delicious. The tomatoe sauce with a little bit of a thicker tomatoe consistancy and flavorful. The sausage was well spiced and arrived in big chuncks on our pizza. The cheese was by far the best part of the pizza. It was a very good quality cheese.

2011-10-03,3.0,"Too much deep-dish in Chicago? Feeling in the mood for some thin-crust. Pizano's has been critically acclaimed as having one of the best thin-crust pizzas in Chicago. So in ordinary fashion, we had to check this place out. The ambiance is cozy, decor simple, representing very much the bar-type of atmosphere. The walls are plastered with photos of our nation's all-time athletes and of celebrities that have visited Pizanos. The bar area takes up much of the main area, with some tables near the front and some running parallel to the bar. There is also a room in the back with additional seating. There is no resemblance of this being a pizzeria, except for the upper half of the wall that has a wallpaper design of tomatoes, mushrooms, peppers, and grapes. We ordered a medium thin crust version of Mark's Special ($18.75). It is 12"" in diameter and serves roughly 2-3 people. Our pizza took the allotted 30 minutes that our waiter had informed us would take. It's a simple pie, consisting of sliced tomatoes, basil and fresh garlic. But through the years of all my pizza venturing, simple is better when it comes to pizza. You don't want to overpile your pizza with countless toppings. I was steadfast and hopeful for a fantastic pizza, like what a Margherita pizza usually does for me. The first thing I noticed was the hard crunchy crust, which I appreciated. As the owner had said when he came to check up on us: ""It only requires one hand and you don't have to hassle with all the toppings falling off, unlike New Yorkers who like to eat their pizza like a sandwich, folding it in half."" They were overzealous on the cheese, in all its gooey glory. The basil and tomato were fresh. The garlic was noticeable without being overbearing in taste. But overall, as Chicago's best thin-crust pizza, I'd have to say it was only average at best. There was nothing special about the pizza. No wowness factor. It just didn't invoke any emotional feelings of love nor hatred. It was a normal tasting pie, texturally and flavor-wise, one that I wouldn't care for getting again. I'd prefer to get a Lou Malnati's Chicago Classic (12"" deep dish for $17.40) which is cheaper, heartier, and includes some tasty sausage.",0.9929,0.825,0.139,0.036,0.4276084767945233

This visit, after having walked to Wrigley Field, (from Downtown no less), we were in the mood for pizza.....wait....let's be brain dead and give this place another chance....... Strike 1:  We walk in and the hostess and her friend are standing at the station chit chatting about their day - completely ignoring us.   So we politely waited.   Finally after they got done with their conversation, they turned to us and asked us if we wanted to be seated.....HELLOOOOOO.... then  one of the hostesses with an attitude, instead of placing us at a table by ourselves., decides to put us smack dab next to a family with a child that was exploring their own flexibility.   I looked and said, can we sit up front?  Not one word out of her mouth, she grabs the menus and puts us up front without a word, then goes to sulk at the hostess station.    Strike 2:  There are 2 tables next to us., both have waiters....while we wait.  NO ONE COMES OVER......the Owner, at least I think its the Owner walks through, sees us sitting there waiting, and completely ignores us and watches the TV..... Strike 3:  The table next to us gets their pizza, and the server makes no eye contact with us, neither does the other server taking care of his table, mind you, the section we are sitting at in the front is miniscule.  I look at the back, and see 3 servers standing at the end of the bar in the back talking, drinking completely oblivious to anything around them.  Finally I think one is coming to see if we are ready to order, or to even say hello.   He looks straight at me and then starts turning around.     I'd had enough, and said, is there anyone taking care of this table?????? Instead of coming over, or even apologizing, he says, I'll go see if anyone is back there..... MEANWHILE, the hostess is smirking at the station......Time to Walk. So to sum things up.....there are plenty of restaurants in Chicago, don't waste your time and effort going to this place.  The staff is self absorbed in themselves and the big screen TV and the Owner/Manager could care less whats goes on.   The food is not worth the aggravation.",0.9058,0.86,0.082,0.058,0.33181818181818185

The worst occasion was on a carry-out order.  My bill was like $12 (small pizza).  I paid with a $20, and after what seemed like half an hour, but was probably 10 minutes, the guy returned with my pie sans change.  I asked where my change was, and he seemed surprised I wasn't going to leave a 67% tip on a carryout order.  It took him another 10 minutes (probably more actually) to bring me back my change.

2011-07-20,2.0,"This place came recommended by none less than Mr. John Kessler, long time Atlanta Journal's food critic a few weeks ago in his blog.  So, while in chicago on a business trip I decided to give it a try with my colleague.  We ordered the Italian Suasage and Peppers for appetizer and a small deep dish pizza with sausage, bell pepper, mushroom and onion.  The suasage and pepper came first.  Although the sausage itself was good, no credit to the chef as it is hard to screw up Italian sausage, but the rest, onions and green and red peppers were just soggy and cooked in liquid.  Not appetizing at all.  I have had much better Italian sausage and pepper on street corners in New York city. Then the deep dish pizza came in and I was hoping that it will stand up to all the rave reviews here.  But the crust suffered from lots of juices released from all the onions and mushrooms they put in it and was quite soggy.  Other than the side crust, the rest was a complete mush.  A disgrace to pizza if you ask me.  A waitress came by and we complained about the mushiness of pizza.  She explained that the veggies release juices and that's how it is.  But that is not a good excuse.  Then our waiter came by and asked us about the pizza.  I showed him the soggy crust.  He asked us if we wanter something else but since I had already had 2 bad dishes, I gave them 2 stars only becasue the waiter removed the pizza from our bill. Note to Pizano's chef from another chef:  You either have to use a deep dish container that had drainage on the bottom into another pan, or you simply have to pre cook your mushrooms and onions, let them release their juices,, and then add them to the pizza at a later time.  There is no excuse that the crust should be so mushy.  A total disgrace to deep dish pizza.",-0.9283,0.861,0.047,0.092,0.34483405483405494

Got here on a Sunday night (4th of July weekend) around 7:30pm; prime dinner traffic.  Having already gone to a few other deep dish style pizzerias we ordered our small Hey Hey JACK BRICKHOUSE Special (sausage & mushroom) while we waited for our table to open up.  There was approx a 30+ minute wait.  While waiting I made my way to the bar and had a few local brew pints (the 312 is an AMAZING wheat beer).  During our wait, we had friendly conversation with the bartenders and got a complimentary beer refill for our long wait!  That really shows me that they're concerned with their customers and that the wait is totally worth it! After checking with the manager how much longer it would be, he told me it would be another 10 minutes or so and that he would come by the bar to let us know.  Sure enough, he came by, let me know that we were up next and they were setting up our table.  (I really hate rude people that expect people to bend over backwards to make their dining experience perfect)  If you go to a well known restaurant, it's not anyone's fault that the wait is long.  Just make the best of it and order an appetizer or drink at the bar while you wait! The wait was long (no lies) but it was totally worth it!!!  OMG...best deep dish I have EVER eaten!  The sauce was amazing!  The cheese was so delicious!  The sausage had such an amazing kick and flavor!  I actually thought the crust was perfect, but the GF preferred a softer crust. We saved room for dessert and ordered the Chocolate Chip cookie dessert which was topped with ice cream and whip cream!  DELICIOUS! I'm sad that I won't get to eat Pizano's till I visit Chicago again.  But I have to say that this is a MUST go for a true Chicago deep dish pizza!  Be prepared for a wait during peak hours and pre-order your pizza while you wait.  You will NOT be disappointed! =)",0.9956,0.786,0.18,0.035,0.541317082388511

The pizza makes up for the lack of interior design. So, let's talk about the pizza then. The thin crust is wonderful - it's crispy and light. I usually go with the veggie pizza, which is loaded with peppers, mushrooms and onions. Unlike some restaurants, Pizano's doesn't pile excessive amounts of cheese on its pizzas, so you really get a very nice blend of ingredients.

And I kept thinking about how every time I'm in Chicago I go to this little pizza place in the loop and I never remember what street its on or how to get there (I just wander until I find it)... and then BAM it turns out that they're both part of the same local little chain. Hah! It was meant to be, obviously. Now for the actual review: This place is sort of narrow and awkwardly shaped and always full. We managed to get seated right away, but we had to take chairs from other people'e tables and ended up sitting about four and a half inches away from some strangers speaking another language. The beer menu isn't real exciting, and neither is the wine, really. The bathroom was clean though, which is a bonus. And our server was great even though she had been there for eight hours and was slated to continue to close. Whatta trooper! Food-wise I can say the bruschetta is pretty good and the salad is good (of course drenched with a delicious Italian dressing). I've never had a pizza that wasn't deep dish. Their deep dish is a little different from what I'm used to. It isn't as thick as deep dish usually is and has barely any sauce on top. The toppings were pretty good and the sausage was perfect (not little round balls, like you usually see) -- flattened patty-style pieces embedded underneath everything else. Overall its quite good, but not mind-blowing.  And you get CRAYONS to draw on your table. Totally awesome. My friend's piece of art was so fantastic she had to take it home. I hope its on her fridge now.",0.9974,0.782,0.197,0.021,0.48505291005290996

A good Chicago deep dish pizza is more than the sum of its parts.  The vegetarian deep dish we ordered at Pizano's was a sloppy mess. It was difficult to individuate the slices, and the cheese was too gooey. The sauce was a basic marinara with no subtlety. Lou Malnati's, on the other hand, has a fantastic sauce with actual slices of fresh tomato inside. Moreover, the crust was too crunchy and too reminiscent of an average pie crust. Lou Malnati's and Giordano's crusts are a nice combination of crunchiness with softness. Surprisingly, the pie was considerably thinner than those of the competitors.   We also ordered a mediocre minestroni soup. The spices were off and it didn't have enough beans. The thin crust pizza was slightly better, but also nothing to write home about. We were hoping that by going to a smaller place, we'd get an interesting, more ""homemade"" take on Chicago deep dish. Alas, we will be returning to the established chains the next time around.

Hey, with all the freakin' burgers, fries and crap I ate this trip, cut me some slack. Besides, I'm from the East Coast. To me, no pizza crust should be thicker than a thumbnail.  The ""thin crust"" was still pretty thick by East Coast standards. Yet, it seemed to be made of cornmeal, which was a novelty to me, and lent a sweet-corn undertone to the pie. Between the two of us, the substantial pie disappeared in no time.  You know I had something to drink. I took this opportunity to have a couple pint glasses of draft Fat Tire, taking me back to my days bar-hopping on Pearl St. in Boulder. Yeah, yeah, I could've had local 312, but Fat Tire pairs better with pizza.  For being outside on a busy downtown Chicago street, I'd say the ambiance/people-watching was pretty good.

2010-07-12,2.0,"I want to love Pizano's.  I really do.  But it's not that good. The restaurant was really crowded when we arrived on a Sunday around 6:15 p.m.  Incredibly, we were seated almost immediately.  They put us at a table in the back, by the kitchen.  A swarm of waiter traffic moved past us constantly. We ordered a deep dish pepperoni and a thin crust sausage. When it came out, it looked very similar to Lou Malnati's - my favorite pie in the city.  My mouth couldn't wait. But i was disappointed when we cut the thin crust pie and the cheese started separating.  I like my pizza when you cut the pie and the cheese clings on for dear life, stretching as you pull the slice away.  Even sitting on your plate, you could see the cheese separating on the slice, like it hadn't been cooked well enough.  I demand cheese uniformity, dammit! The sausage was okay, the crust was kinda bland and the sauce wasn't anything to write home about. I preferred the zestier deep dish.  The pepperoni was spicy and the sauce was fairly robust.  But as I ate it, I kept thinking the crust should be a little thicker, there should have been 50% more cheese and the sauce should have been chunkier.  It's a bad rip-off of Lou Malnati's formula. We also got a bowl of minestrone soup.  For $5.  I kept thinking I could get at least two cans of Progresso for that much.  It was just sort of bland. What's weird is that I reheated the pizza leftovers the next morning and both thin and deep dish tasted *better.  I think that's because I cooked them longer.  When we ate them at the restaurant, they tasted like they'd been rushed. The decor is an issue all its own.  We visited shortly after the 4th of July, so the place was decked out in red, white and blue tinsel, an American flag decoration with appropriately colored Christmas tree lights and... stars & stripes paper plates screwed to the wall.  Huh?  Nearly every inch of the wall is covered in mismatched framed pictures of sports heroes. As you'll eat, you'll hear plenty of Sinatra and the occasional ""Godfather"" theme.  All Italian-y restaurants get a pass on this. Really, the food is only worth two stars, but our service was good.  The guy refilling our water was johnny-on-the-spot. If you want this kind of pizza, Lou Malnati knocks it out of the park.  But Pizano's can't keep up.  It is hereby relegated to ""emergency backup pizza"" status.",-0.4608,0.899,0.049,0.052,0.4924814814814815

The crust was not deep. There wasn't enough cheese, either. However, the meat and vegetable toppings were delicious. Not outstanding and memorable, but tasty.

2010-06-28,5.0,"I lived four blocks from Pizzano's for two years and it was so great to have such an amazing place to rely on for late night pizza and pasta.  My old roommate and I couldn't get enough of this place, I feel like we had it once a month if not every other month for sure. The one i used to go to was on Madison, between Michigan and Randolph- and it was great!  Inside it's pretty dark and a little loud, but you'll soon forget about the sound as soon as you order.  And even better, if you sit outside it's perfect and the wait-staff is amazing. I've had almost everything on the menu, but first things first, the pie.  Pizzano's has some of the best ""deep-dish"" pizza I've ever had.  I put deep-dish in quotes because it's not your typical cheese-infested, great-wall-of-china- thick crust.  The crust is deep, but it's light and buttery, with the cheesy oozing in its rightful place, on top of the toppings.  The tomato sauce tastes fresh and the real slices of tomatoes, takes it over the edge.  The stringy cheese will rise from the crust when you lift it from the pan, which makes the experience even more delectable. You really can't go wrong with this pizza, it's outstanding. The pasta is equally great.  Each person gets a large, and when I say large, I mean LARGE bowl of pasta, which it's almost guaranteed you to take home left-overs.  (Completely worth it).  The bowl of pasta is about 3-31/2 inches deep and about 5 inches around.  HUGE!  I tend to get their shrimp Alfredo (as you can tell I'm a fan of white-sauced pasta and seafood).  Between the flavors of the sauce and the veggies, it's the perfect combination.  You can't go wrong. If you have room and a few extra dollars, I HIGHLY recommend ordering the calamari for an appetizer and their peanut butter cookie for dessert.  The calamari is crisp and crunchy with the perfect blend of seasonings.  The peanut butter cookie literally melts in your mouth.   . Everyone needs to try Pizzano's at least once while visiting or living in Chicago, if you don't you'll be missing out on some of the best pizza, you'd ever have.

So, I guess it was inevitable that I would end up at a place known for its thin-crust pizza. The crust is as good as advertised. It is buttery and crispy (who likes floppy thin crust pizza? I guess New Yorkers.). The cheese, sauce, and toppings were good but not standout. The pizza came out HOT (maybe a bit too hot as the roof of my mouth can attest). But, it's much better to be too hot than too cold when it comes to pizza. In terms of the logistics: We got seated next to the restroom (bad). There was no wait (good). Pizza took forever to come (bad). Waitress ran after me when she realized I left my credit card behind (good; especially since this came a week after I lost my ATM card somewhere else). It's a nice and cozy place but has a loud bar and many TV's. So, it's maybe not the best place for a date but great if you have a loud friend (or a quiet friend who you don't want to listen to).

Fast forward to the 21st century: I generally stay out of Chicago these days.   About a year or so ago, I and my son and his family had free tickets to the Shedd Aquarium and after spending the afternoon there, planned to have dinner in the Loop.  My son and daughter-in-law love Italian food, and had decided to try Pizano's in the loop. When we were finally seated, I was facing the wall, and looked up to see a photograph of Rudy Malnati, Sr.   I asked our waiter about it and he told me that Pizano's was owned by Rudy Malnati, Jr. (I had never met Jr, but was acquainted with Lou Malnati, who just before his death, started up the Lou Malnati's Pizza chain). Anyway I decided to order a traditional Chicago style deep dish pepperoni pizza for myself.  When I took the first bite, it was like I was transported back to the 1950s/1960s.  It was so great I could hardly believe it.  I ate almost the entire pizza myself, with on;y one small slice for my son and D-I-L to taste, and one for the grandkids.

Looking back, I should have realized what this place actually is- a place where you take dates you feel kind of ambivalent about.  It is cute and cozy enough where it can feel appropriate for a date, but is by no means ""romantic""- it is loud, tables close together, lots of tv's with sports, etc.  Live and learn, Kelly, live and learn.  Maybe good for a very, very early date.   Staff is friendly and overall, I like this place just fine- it just wouldn't be on my list of places to go unless I was in the area and someone else suggested it.  And with that, Pizano's, I bestow on you 3 stars.",0.9771,0.855,0.121,0.024,0.4815106732348112

Maybe it was just Pizanos? I was not too happy... After waiting a few minutes for service, we ordered a lackluster Caesar Salad, and a small deep dish pizza- the tomato, garlic, and basil. The salad came with some unremarkable and cold bread.  The salad was about what I would expect out of a bag of Dole prepared salad. I eagerly awaited the pizza... I didn't go there for the salad in the first place. I did not particularly like the way Pizano's does deep dish- I was expecting something deeper, maybe with a double crust.  However, that is that is not their fault.  But...the crispy crust was a little too crispy, and the cheese was hard and chewy, not soft and melty. I had a tough time cutting with my butter knife, and eventually had to switch to my fingers. I will say that the he tomato, basil, and garlic topping was tasty, however.   Not worth the once in ten years experience, and not worth the calories, either.  Next time, I will stick to Giordano's.",0.963,0.849,0.112,0.038,0.43198717948717946

So we got a small deep dish, half Rudy's Special (Cheese, Sausage, Mushroom, Onion, & Green Pepper) and half Mark's Special (Sliced Tomatoes, Basil, and Fresh Garlic).  The first thing I noticed was that there was not as much cheese in the pizza as other places.  There was an abundance of sauce and toppings, however.  The stuff just didn't melt off the pizza the way I had hoped.  The crust really made up for that because it was very tasty.  The extra butter on the crust made a world of a difference because it made you really want to eat the crust, unlike at other pizza places that will have you avoiding the crust all together. The restaurant itself was a fun place, their walls were covered in Chicago memorabilia and were playing Frank Sinatra hits (had one song about Chicago) the whole dinner.  There were also huge lcds along the ceilings above the bar so you can catch the game, so that was a nice touch.  It is a smaller restauarant, so I can see it getting crowded at times, but we were lucky to have been seated immediately.

Until the last year I hadn't tried many different types of food and if I like something I usually stick with it and order it again and again. Well, I've been eating plain cheese pizza forever. I honestly never thought I'd want to try anything else, but, well, I'm getting ahead of myself.  After an afternoon at the museum, a friend brought me to this fine establishment for a late lunch. The place was mostly empty when we arrived, but then it was a Wednesday at about 3pm. My eating companion was in dire need of some greasy sustenance to cure the hangover that he was in the death grip of.  Our waiter was prompt, engaging, and didn't seem to mind when my companion brought in his own coke.  He found the soda pop to taste odd. I didn't really notice, but he disliked the taste so much he actually went out and grabbed a coke from somewhere else and poured it in his cup.  Anywho...as my companion was beginning to sweat out all the liquor from the night before we started with the fried calamari. I say we, but really, I mean him. I don't eat seafood of any kind. However, it did seem to help add a bit of color back to the old man.  We ordered a half cheese and half Mark's  Special (Sliced Tomatoes, Basil, and Fresh Garlic) with pepperoni on buttercrust. Well, whenever you order a half and half pizza some of one side inevitably ends up on the other. As such, my first few slices had the delicious flavor of garlic and basil without the grossness of pepperoni. A whole new world of pizza was opened to me in that moment. I cannot stress enough how big of a deal this is for an avid cheese pizza lover such as myself. I am a pizza convert, wholly transformed and enlightened. Praise Mozzarella!  Oh, and I can't forget about the crust. It was crunchy on the bottom, soft on the top, mouthwatering fantastic taste all around.  Overall, the place is a treat.

All of this has been, up to this point, just mild annoying and somewhat comical.  But the final kicker is this: one of our party asks for another lemon for her iced tea.  The server says ""Well, you know we normally don't give out extra lemons for free...this one is on the house, but just so you know we'll have to charge for the next one....""  Wow.  I guess margins there are so tight they have to watch every slice of bread and lemmon that goes out the door.

There are not a lot of places where I eat the pizza and the crust, but this is one of them. I've always ordered Rudy's special which is cheese, sausage, mushroom, onion, and green pepper. They are always perfectly made and taste great. I highly recommend trying it out. If you don't feel like eating pizza, the pasta is awesome too. I've had the Pasta a la franco which has a cream sauce. The peas and chicken is what really made this dish pop. I've also tried to bruschetta.

I love Lou Malnati's butter crust, so if this place could top that, I'd love it forever.  Walking in, it felt like we had just entered a neighborhood joint. You almost forget you're in downtown Chicago, so I really liked that about the place. The entire right side is dedicated to the bar, and the left side gives enough space for a few sit-down groups of 4. It's tiny! Our server was really pushy, even a little gruff. With a space that small, they want you IN AND OUT! And well...she made that pretty clear. Anyway, we ordered 2 medium pizzas (enough for 5 people, maybe more): a deep dish Rudy's which was  Cheese, Sausage, Mushroom, Onion, & Green Pepper, and a thin-crust Mark's Special which is basically sliced tomatoes, basil, and fresh garlic.  **Ok, what the other yelpers say is true: the deep dish and the thing crust ARE the same thickness. It's kind of strange, I KNOW. The taste isn't that bad but when you're expecting a THICK crust and it's the same size as your thin crust, then it leaves you feeling a bit disappointed. The Rudy's isn't bad though, and the crust is somewhat reminiscent of Lou Malnati's butter crust.** A note to all you fellow garlic lovers: the Mark's Special is AMAZING. If anything, forget the deep dish and get the Mark's or another thin crust here.  We got the house salad too...nothing special. Just cheap whitish yellow iceberg lettuce with limited assortment of other veggies.

The Sheffield location randomnly closed with no explanation.  Still curious about that one!",0.939,0.697,0.188,0.115,0.6642857142857143
2006-08-10,5.0,"The greatest pizza ever!! I HIGHLY recommend everyone try it. The service is a little too slow for my appetite (pizza's take 25-45 minutes to cook) but it is definitely, definitely worth the wait. Try the Cheesy Garlic bread in the meantime. It's open late and they do deliver and offer take-out, just call 45 minutes before you want to eat and it'll be perfect. Also, a good place for an occasional celebrity sighting - I dined there at the same time as Vince Vaughn and Cole Hauser while they were in town shooting THE BREAK-UP. No one bugged them (though we did stare on occasion) which was really cool. Also, if you're a Louis Prima or Dean Martin fan - you'll love the soundtrack at Pizano's. I definitely do - those are my boys.",0.99,0.721,0.261,0.018,0.5493333333333333
2006-08-08,4.0,"I live above Pizano's so I have eaten there many times.  My family LOVES it and thinks it's the best pizza in Chicago.  I wouldn't go that far, but I do enjoy the thin crust pizza.  Expect to wait about 30 mins or so for it to be brought to the table, but order minestrone soup or cheesy garlic bread while you wait.  'Brant's Favorite' is a great dish that I order often.  It's spicy and fresh.  'Holly's Chocolate Chip Cookie' dessert is very good too, but make sure to split it with friends.",0.9878,0.702,0.298,0.0,0.6668376068376068
2006-07-02,5.0,"This is some of the some of the best pizza I've ever had.  It is very comparable to Lou Malnati's, but I definitely like Pizano's better.  Great sauce and great crust.  Great location and great interior, has a great feel, like many downtown restaurants have.  I'll definitely be going back, and look forward to trying their other foods. Edit: Also, they have the best thin crust pizza I've ever had as well.  Can't go wrong here.",0.9965,0.5,0.5,0.0,0.5484375
2006-02-25,4.0,"Tuesday night college night - save those college ids!  They still come in handy five years later when you hit up Pizano's Tuesday nights and if you have three people and each person orders one drink (it can be non-alcoholic, too) you get a free pizza - either a medium deep dish or a large thin crust - the deep dish is fantastic.  And their bruschetta - yum!  Service was great and helpful. and the dessert - they have this amazing HUGE chocolate chip cookie WARM with ice cream on top.  wow.",0.9865,0.689,0.311,0.0,0.6663265306122449
2006-02-24,1.0,"The pizza here is pretty gross. If you are going into the restaurant even to pick up a pizza, you will come out reeking of smoke. It just seems really dirty to me. Also, the few times I did order there, they screwed up my order.",-0.8516,0.713,0.059,0.228,0.47500000000000003
