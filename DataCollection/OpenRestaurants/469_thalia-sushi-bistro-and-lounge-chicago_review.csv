2017-04-19,4.0,"Came here on a whim, not realizing until passing by Jerk that there was a fusion sushi joint right next door. Having heard that it had recently undergone new management I was a little cautious, as it usually always takes a few months for kinks to be worked out, especially if the menu undergoes an overhaul. Arriving during prime lunch hours, i noticed a good occupancy inside the restaurant with 405 other tables full. That didn't stop the service from being otherwise friendly and attentive, and my salmon bowl was out in minutes. It was essentially a pre-made poke bowl with fish, sushi rice, lettuce, tomato, corn, avocado, tobiko, spicy mayo, and sweet soy sauce. The quality was good, the bowl was bright, and there was a decent filling portion for $8 which made it seem like a good value. Admittedly, looking at dinner prices they may be a bit steep for many of the exact same dishes they're offering, but if you come for lunch you'll be rewarded with a fairly large selection of sushi burritos, sushi bowls, and rice bowls for less than $10, a fraction of the dinner price.",0.9365,0.875,0.111,0.014,0.45842352092352096

2017-02-04,2.0,"Went in on a Friday after work and the place is empty.  Two servers are talking, the male server is loudly lecturing the woman server about why women cheat and how women take advantage of men by always being paid for. Coincidentally I was meeting my BF there to treat him to dinner.  Male server eventually came over and I asked for a drink. It was unsettling how he went from his sexist rant not 20 feet away to giving me a big fake smile and described my habanero cider to me like I had just ordered an expensive wine. Felt really forced and over the top.  Atmosphere is dreary. It's dark inside, there are two silent big screen monitors playing cable shows including commercials, and no music.  BF shows up and remarks on how empty the place is. Despite the awful atmosphere I insist we stay for one or two plates. I really wanted the food to make it worthwhile. It did not. The menu is massive. You have sushi bowls, sushi burritos, thai bowls, maki rolls, noodles salads, ect. If a restaurant claims it can make all of the above then fantastic. If not, maybe less would be more. We ordered the jalapeno poppers for $8 as an appetizer. This was 4 jalapeno halves filled with half cream cheese and half spicy raw fish lightly fried and decorated with sweet sauces. The halves were large and the pepper itself was not spicy, and the spicy fish was lukewarm and underwhelming. No distinct flavor and very meh especially for $2 a piece.  Just want to note one of the specialty rolls comes covered in melted mozzarella which reminded me of the sushi pizza episode of Kitchen Nightmares. What is that even doing here? We decide to try the Sunset which is raw tuna over crab rolls with cucumber, avocado, and sauces. The fish to rice ratio is as others have said not good. There was barely if any cucumber or avocado.The rolls were filled generously with a very sweet crab salad but the rice was SALTY. I mean way too salty. Also the ginger and wasabi were low quality-ginger is white but soaked in sweet preservative and horseradish wasabi was jewel osco quality.  BF stopped halfway and because i'm stubborn I made myself eat the last pieces. Stomach ache ensued and not from overeating. The bill came to $30 before I realized the roll was overcharged a buck. This was fixed promptly and I paid to $29 bill. It was a waste. Butterfly Sushi is phenomenal and right down the street.

I stopped in for my usual green curry, only to find it unusually dead during dinner hour, and the menu had changed entirely (salmon burrito? weird). Being a new small business owner myself and understanding how real the struggle is, I decided to forgo my thai craving and give it a try (especially because the person who seated me appeared to be the owner or manager and looked so happy that someone was there). I was hopeful and ordered the bulgogi over rice, which came with salad and soup.  All of it arrived at the same time about 5 minutes after I ordered it. I dont know how it could possibly have been freshly cooked (could have been because I was literally the only person there?). Not only that but the soup was barely lukewarm and the ""salad"" was merely chopped romaine with about a teaspoon of ginger dressing. It's also kind of odd to have a soup, salad and big entree come at you all at once. Would have been nice if they paced that out like a normal meal. Maybe they'd get the pacing right if they freshly cooked their food instead of just reheating it? The bulgogi was just ok. I know Korean BBQ is sweet, but this was all sweetness with no spice, no ginger, no garlic, no nuance...just sweet meat with rice (no vegetables). The prices are steep for the quality of the food, but I will say they give you a reasonable portion.

On the menu, you'll find everything from sushi to bulgogi fried rice to cream pasta. It's a lot to digest, literally and figuratively. It seems like Korean is their specialty, so I wish they'd focus on that cuisine and drop all the other stuff.  When I went, we had the bulgogi fried rice, two sushi rolls, onion rings, kimchi fries. The food was decent, don't get me wrong. In fact, I really enjoyed the bulgogi fried rice as it was quite flavorful and we actually ended up ordering a second bowl. However, it's the concept that I just can't quite get on board with. I find myself missing the old Thalia's which focused on Thai food. You could walk in, order some pad thai, and you knew what you were going to get. For some reason, this fusion just doesn't quite work for me. Also, the vibe inside feels like it's trying to be a hip and trendy restaurant downtown. There are lights like you would find in a club, and the music is LOUD.

Nobody informed us that they were going to be filming. It was a terribly uncomfortable experience for me to be eating and worrying that I was being filmed. Towards the end when we tried to get our check there was NOBODY. The woman behind the counter was on her cell phone and ignoring everyone.

Wish they offered it as an entree. The second appetizer was Lettuce Wraps. If a restaurant is going to prepare a traditional dish that is nothing like what diners expect, then it needs to warn them. Not sure what they were going for with this dish... a mixture of ground chicken, noodles and mystery ingredients that resulted in a cold, congealed glob set in lettuce cups. One bite and it was back to the kitchen.     I had the Pad Thai with tofu entree, which was among the best I've ever eaten (and I've eaten a lot of it). Just enough ""hot"" to make it interesting.

For drinks - the lychee saki-tini for the win.  You'll want two or ten.   Enjoy!,0.9824,0.716,0.284,0.0,0.5840909090909091

2016-01-15,3.0,"A group of eight friends decided to celebrate a birthday here.  As we made reservations earlier in the day, we were quickly seated. We order a variety of appetizers: lobster chip ceviche, crab rangoon, saigon roll, coconut shrimp, and chicken satay. Out of the appetizers I tried, the saigon roll was nothing extraordinary but the crab rangoons were phenomenal. Without a doubt, the best crab rangoons I've ever had, and I've had a lot in my lifetime.  Unfortunately, a potential bias to my lack of interest in the saigon roll was that it was not made to a restaurant-quality standard. Despite this mishap, the Thalia Spice team was very receptive and remedied the situation quickly. Not only did they negate the cost of that appetizer, they gave us two extra servings of the crab rangoons.  We, again, ordered a variety of entrees including various sushi dishes, chicken pad thai, and the pad prix king. I primarily had the pad prix king, which is a tilapia dish. I was underwhelmed with this dish. The flavor profile was average.  As a point of improvement, as a group, we mentioned multiple times through the night that we were celebrating a birthday. No acknowledgement of this was made by the team, such as notifying us about dessert specials or providing a surprise.  Overall, our waiter was quick and attentive to the group's needs. Despite the mishap noted above, I'm more than willing to come back to explore the menu further. It was an enjoyable night out with friends.",0.9726,0.825,0.125,0.05,0.4942307692307692

Being that we were with a large group, we ordered a variety of appetizers. Clay pot mussels, lobster chip ceviche, mango seared scallops, chicken satay, and some Laotian beef. Everything was pretty tasty, but none of those items would be the subject of my cravings!  We washed down our appetizers with the sangria...which I really enjoyed! I loved the lychee in it...yum! :)  For my main course, I ordered the Panang Curry. It comes with rice, but I substituted it w/ the naan. The menu calls it naan (Indian paratha), but it was more like Malaysian roti. I think they should clear that up on their menu...naan and paratha are two different types of breads. Sorry for that side note. Anywho, the curry was decent. Good amount of spice. My only gripe is that the ""naan"" that I ordered (mind you there is an upcharge) was so tiny for the massive amount of curry they served. My ""naan"" was finished in a few bites and is nowhere the size of a ""real"" naan bread. So, skip that upcharge and stick to the rice!  We didn't order dessert.  Service was decent. They forgot a couple of our friends' meals. That always annoys me and shouldn't be a mistake that is made in restaurants! And my ""naan"" came out about 10 minutes after my curry.

I got the YAYA noodles with chicken which were pretty decent however the dish had hot and cold spots. The veggies were cold and the noodles only warm at best. Not sure why that was. The two people I was with both had issues with the temperature of their dishes as well. Decided to order a sushi roll and got the Thalia roll. The roll was the only reason I didn't give this place a 1 star rating. The roll was a little too saucy for me but it had good flavor and tasted very fresh.

It was watery but still had nice elements of citrus and spice. My friend enjoyed her green curry dish, too. I was excited for scallops on top of mango and avocado salad. I love all of those things! The scallops were tough to get down, so I left a lot of them uneaten. They were a bit dry and gummy, and the taste was very fishy. You'd think the salad would be better, perhaps able to disguise the scallops' taste. But no. The avocado was OK, but the tomatoes used in it (surprise guest...but I like tomatoes so it was OK) were a bit mealy. And the mango chunks themselves were slimy and well past their prime. The mango had acquired a bit of an ""off"" taste that was bad on its own, and extra bad when combined with the ""off""-tasting scallops as well!

First off, even though my Groupon was for 2 people, we were unable to use it because we were at a table of seven (for a Birthday party) and they did not allow split checks.  Who, in this day and age, does not allow split checks?!  I really don't understand why they could not have subtracted the value of the Groupon from the group check, and kept it moving from there, but ok whatever. Secondly, most of the alcoholic drinks were watered down.  We had to send 2 lychee martinis back and should have sent the 2 Thai-grias, their take on Sangria, back as well. Lastly, the food itself was just ok. I had the Rising Sun Maki roll and the Chef's Roast Duck.  Out of seven people, only one person thought their food (she ordered the spicy eggplant) was exceptional.  My maki roll was good, but my duck was just ok.  Out of the group we ordered the Thai Chicken Wings, Pad Thai, Thai Fried Rice, and the Filipino Adobo Chicken.  Everyone else also thought their food was just ok.  Not bad, but nothing special.   Overall, I feel that if the service had been better concerning the Groupon, it would have more than made up for the lackluster food and the watered down drinks.   So, we will go back as we have an unused Groupon and, hopefully it will be better.  For everyone else, I say if you are in the area and have a taste for Asian Fusion food, then stop by - but don't expect to be blown away.",0.9598,0.842,0.113,0.045,0.4413286302175191

My better half ordered the Yaya Noodles with chicken.  The dish was excellent and very light considering it was a noodle dish.  Thalia Spice loses a few points because they were out of my first choice of an entree, the Filipino adobo chicken, but the Indian Chicken Makhani was more than an adequate substitute. Finally, as an added bonus we learned they have drink specials every night, and stumbled into $5 lychee and mango (and a couple of other flavors I cannot remember) martinis on Thursdays.  A check-in on Yelp also earned me a buy 1 get 1 brunch voucher. Our only complaint was the table of loud, f-bomb dropping and obnoxious millennials next to us complaining about their jobs, co-workers and supervisors.  This is of course was no fault of the restaurant and they were more than happy to let us move tables before our food arrived.

The traditional Vietnamese BAHN mi is served on a French baguette. The Indian pork curry that it was stuffed with was over sauced and in between cold and hot. A very unsettling lukewarm where bacteria would find a nice home in. The vegetable dressings was inconsistent throughout the sandwich. One half had cilantro and the other didn't. I requested extra jalapeño and received 2 slices, and the daikon was overwhelming, to the point it was battling between the pork.

Still, It's always good to hear some feedback so we can improve our skills.

Shout out for the Pyaar (Volcano shrimp bisque with curried foam), the Lady and the Tramp (Tamarind baby back ribs on bed of spice noodles) and the Romance dessert (Fried banana, pistachio Kulfi with sugar cone fragments). The wines were very good: an iltalian pinot grigio, an australian shiraz cabernet, and a german riesling to top us off. Service was slightly off with the wine pairings, but I somewhat expected this since fixed price dinners/wine pairing are not routine at this restaurant (we had to ask our server for our wine on one of the middle courses). Suzy Singh would come out of the kitchen intermittently to chat with us and other guests. Besides being a great chef, she is the nicest person. Always smiling. At 69 dollars per person (that is with the wine pairing), I think this is one of the best quality dinners with drinks that your 69 dollars can buy, but due to the mediocre service, I can not give it 5 stars and must give it 4.5 stars.

This time, I went with my boyfriend on a random dinner date using our $25  restaurant.com  coupon. On the coupon, it did not say anywhere that there has to be a minimum purchase but I figured I'd ask the waitress anyways just to make sure so when the bill comes, we won't be denied of using the coupon. The waitress read through the whole coupon and just said ""minimum is $34"". My BF and I thought that was a random amount. So we ordered an appetizer, a soup and 2 entrees. We wanted to order a sushi roll from their daily special on a separate check (b/c specials cannot be combined with our coupon) but she wouldn't let us. She said we can order the roll but it has to be from the regular menu and regular price. So we didn't order and they lost out on an extra $5 business. The food was just decent. Their beef was not tender enough. So we finished our meal, we asked for the check, the waitress came over and said our bill is now $36, would we like a dessert or something to go? I politely said ""no, we are full now. "" But she said we needed a minimum of $37 to use the coupon. Again, another RANDOM amount she threw at us! I argued with her for a little bit saying ""you just told us $34 when you first saw our coupon!"" She just kept saying ""no, minimum is $37 to use the coupon."" So we were forced to order a mochi dessert for $3.50. When we looked at the bill, they charged extra for the meat when they didn't tell us when we were ordering and we did not see it on the menu that it didn't come with meat and would be extra.

My husband had the best dish I think, he had the green curry. Which again was not bad but I have definitely had better elsewhere.  Not only was the food disappointing, but the waitress came over about 5 mins before we got our appetizers and informed us that fire to the big  party happening on the other side of the restaurant, our food would come out a little late. Fine. 5 minds later, its going to be a bit later than before. Fine. But then one would imagine getting some sort of consideration, an extra apprise perhaps? Nope.

And it was well worth it.  Yes the location is odd and not too welcoming, but in a way it's very good. We chose a great day to stop by, with the weather not too hot and not too cool, we sat outside. Which I think might be better than the inside, since when I did go in, there was a very stuffy smell coming from within.  Anyway, the food was quite good. Quite authentic, without being too overwhelming. Except for the casserole. A little too much for us, but everything else was perfect. The signature Thalia sushi roll was delicious. Crunchy, smooth, hot and cold all in one bite. We also tried the seaweed salad like we do everywhere, and this one was pretty good. Entrees included the Malaysian Laksa soup- amazing! Hint of coconuct, spicy and filled with seafood and noodles. We added the naan bread just to see what the difference of 'Malaysian' naan was, but really not different, but still delicious. :)  Like I said, don't try the casserole that is ever so tempting. It is not your mama's casserole. It's filled with fishy seafood and covered in some kind of Asian mush. Not for the faint hearted. We actually returned it and went right to the mainstream Pad Thai- with chicken. Which was the best Idea all night. This Pad Thai was sooooo tasty. Not too oily like some.  Thee very, very best part of the night though, was... DESSERT! (as always). We tried the custard and the mango sticky rice. Both of which were absolutely great. But the custard was seriously the best Thai custard I had EVER had. Creamy and melts in your mouth!! Sticky rice was pretty good, but the custard by far went way over the top.  As for the drinkers, like me, definitely not the place to go. They try... But I would recommend the guava-tini. Everything else, eh.

My friend ordered the PANANG CURRY with TOFU ($11.95?): I tasted some of it, but her assessment was similar. There was too much liquid and little substance.

Starters - Shrimp rolls(they were the size of my wifes pinky finger, but good) Coconut shrimp x 2 - (not like Red Lobster, more like shrimp fritters?)   Broiled octopus and kim chee - (I was the only one who loves anything about either of the things in that dish) Mains - Asian spice fire chicken - (good amount of heat, plenty of protein content) Yaya noodles - (stir-fried spinach noodles, it was like an Asian fettucine dish minus the alfredo, plus more veggies) Penang Curry - (I didn't get to taste it) They also have a well stocked bar, me and Carlo C. enjoyed their Irish whiskeys. Those were the plus marks, here were the minuses... For dessert my wife ordered the mochi.  Mochi isn't hard to mess up, just open the box and serve them right?  Well, when you break it down, mochi is just ice cream wrapped in rice dough.  Rice dough should be slightly chewy, never brittle.  The mochi wasn't good today.   The other thing that we all found very odd was that when we walked in,(we had reservations) they didn't seem to know what to do with us.  The main dining room, which you enter when you walk in, was not quite full, and neither was the side room, but the back upstairs room was empty and so was the room with the single table.  We almost asked for the single room, but didn't, and ended up in that back upstairs room.  So as the night does on, the dining rooms fill, and we noticed a weird trend.  All the brown people were seated in the back upstairs room and mostly in the side room, and the lighter-colored people were in the main and side dining rooms.  It was just odd really.  I didn't think there was any purpose behind it, just a very strange coincidence.   The dishes run on the pricier side, but I think it's a small price to pay for the chance to try the different cuisines all under one roof. Abundant street parking, polite service, and with a  restaurant.com  coupon, a great value, although I would eat here without the coupon any day of the week.  Possibly a tie with Penny's for best pad thai....",0.9778,0.855,0.093,0.052,0.43525832555244315

2012-01-06,2.0,"I have always raved about this place to friends and so of course, with tradition, I planned an NYE dinner here with about twelve people. A handful of them had been here before with me so they know the food is excellent. I prepped my group to expect mediocre service, but this was ridiculously too far. My entire party arrived and ordered at 7.  At first everything seemed okay, the waitstaff was attentive and the server refilling waters was on the ball this time - last year we would get up and get our own pitchers. However, when the entrees started slipping and not coming through at the same time, some even waiting half an hour after others got their entree, we became slightly irritated. Then, dessert time - most of us ordered mochi (for those not in the know: mochi is ice cream wrapped in delicious rice paste, about the size of a Jawbreaker). We finalized our dessert orders around 9:05, which I remember because that was when the last entree came out. We wait. We wait. We wait. When we asked the staff what was going on with the desserts, they said they were still making it. Some asked, ""What, are they milking the cow in there?"" and others went for their third cigarette break. Piles of dishes were left to collect on our tables as patience and frustration began to run high. The water guy, for whatever reason, kept filling our waters when you could plainly see on our faces that we just wanted to leave.  Finally, one of my friends, who had attended last year, got up and left, absolutely frustrated at the lack of service. We even witnessed another table's issues, where the server dropped a bowl of soup on a woman - we were appalled at just how terrible the service was this evening and that it wasn't only affecting us. We got to the point where some of us finally got dessert and others just decided to leave without dessert. Since a few of us complained to management, we had the 18% gratuity removed from our bill. I felt it wasn't enough - it was embarrassing to brag about this place every New Years, round up a bunch of hope-filled foodies, then to let them down and almost be late for our next event.  I spoke at length with Brad, one of the owners - his explanation was fitting enough in which they had several waitstaff call in that evening and the runner in the kitchen was fairly new, so calling out the orders made it difficult to orchestrate. I advised him that he is potentially losing a loyal customer due to this debacle and though I'm not really in the restaurant business, but I would feel there should have been safeguards to prevent something like this from happening? How can I now rave about this only to be completely let down? He offered to remove an additional 25% on the bill, the reason why Thalia has two stars, but I doubt I will plan for this place again. I will likely come back to eat, but maybe on small dates rather than large parties.  One star for the food still being good, even when they came out cold. One star for trying to fix the disastrous evening. Funny note: one woman in our party gave the server who filled our waters $20 and said, ""Keep it. You were the only one who did your job tonight.""",-0.8095,0.844,0.073,0.083,0.5350708273208272

I could understand this if we were a party of, say, 6 or 8, but there were three of us using a coupon for four people - and we were no where near the value of the coupon.   Once we sat down, it took about 30 minutes for us to even have a server ask for our drink order, then another 15 before our wine arrived.  And there were only two other tables in the place.  We had to flag down the server every time we needed something and then it took forever to get, even though we could see our sushi sitting on the bar, ready to go. And the place has a serious temperature problem - it was first cold and drafty so we asked that the fan be turned off, then it got extremely hot and uncomfortable.  Not sure if this has to do with the doors to the patio area, but it needs to be remedied.

2011-12-28,2.0,"From the time we walked in until the moment we walked out, service was inattentive to say the least and, at most times, unfriendly to boot. We entered into a room that housed the sushi bar, host stand and a few tables accommodating larger parties. The restaurant appears to be a series of rooms, and I'm glad that we were seated in a different one - the constant interruption from other patrons and likely cold breezes would've annoyed me. The room we ended up in was quiet and cozy, my only complaint was that the tables are rather tiny. We were seated with menus and water and waited for our server. We waited and waited some more; apparently we were wearing our invisibility cloaks as she had no trouble acknowledging the table across from us. About 15 minutes passed before we were greeted with an brusque - ""ready to order?!"" as if we had just walked up to the counter at McDonald's. Is foreplay a lost art? You know small talk, an apology for the slow start, anything before we start spending cash at your restaurant? There were no questions about whether we'd like an appetizer or a drink to start, and if there were specials, we were none the wiser.  The menu is large, a composition of sushi and all sorts of asian fusion. I like that they denote which dishes can be made vegetarian; there seem to be a fair number of veggie-friendly dishes. Having ample time to review the menu, we ordered everything at once - two drinks and four dishes to share. We ordered the Clay Pot Mussels, Mango Seared Scallops, Singapore Crab Rangoon, and Malaysian Roti Canai - most, if not all, of these were denoted favorites.  I can deal with poor service, to an extent, if the food warrants it; this did not. Our dishes ranged from good to mediocre and the portions didn't live up to their price tags. Clay Pot Mussels - for approximately $10, we got 5 large mussels in a lemony coconut broth. While these were tasty and by far our favorite dish, I couldn't help but compare them to my mussels at Revolution days earlier. For $2 more, I got a heaping bowl of mussels and a side of bread - a meal on its own. Mango Seared Scallops - for approximately $10, we got 4 medium scallops in a mango-avocado salsa. The dish was good, reminiscent of ceviche (a dish which already resides on the menu), but the mango and tartness of the salsa almost eclipses the taste of the scallops. Again this dish seemed rather skimpy. Singapore Crab Rangoon -when I saw this on the menu, billed as spicy Singapore style crab rangoon with jalapeno, I was really excited to try it. Sadly, this was a miss. While the wrappers were light and not oil laden, the rangoons seemed light on filling and were devoid of spice. Not the worst crab rangoon ever, but even compared to regular crab rangoon they were nothing special. I can't speak to the last dish, as I didn't try it, but my companion did note that it wasn't great compared to other Roti Canai he's had. We were essentially ignored throughout our meal, we even refilled our own waters (we were fortunate to sit near the oddly placed refill station). We only saw our waitress again after our meal; *if* they were short-staffed, it would have behooved them to tell us so we could temper our expectations. While we were waiting to pay, the hostess attempted to step up service (busing the rest of our dishes, bringing back the check, making small talk), but frankly by that point it was too little, too late.  A pan-Asian menu is great if you can execute the various cuisines well; Thalia Spice's menu has too much variety, they could stand to pare it back and really rock those dishes. All in all, the company was great, but the food was average and the service downright sucked; with a  restaurant.com  coupon the final bill seemed fair, at full price not so much.

2011-06-22,2.0,"I am sad to only be able to give Thalia 2 stars since I live right in the area and am a regular guest but after my experience last night and today, I will not be returning for awhile. To begin, last night was the $5 maki special which is a great deal, but to me I would rather have no special and have attentive service.  I come into Thalia at least once a week.  At this point, I have introduced myself several times and they still don't address me by name which really bothers me.  I bring in friends to eat all the time and am a good customer.  Where is the loyalty?  Anyways, upon arrival, we were asked if we made a reservation and I had not.  My friend and I sat at the bar and waiting about 10 mins for our table which was not a big deal.   After getting seated, our server was very rushed.  She was literally running between tables which lead me to believe that Thalia did not staff accordingly.  Our server was very sweet and enthusiastic and she upsold me on a Thai Iced tea (wasn't in the mood to drink) and described it to me but failed to mention that it was very sweet.  I got the tea after 15 minutes of waiting for it and I swear it was half simple syrup.  Needless to say, I sent it back.  Finally, I ordered the grilled calamari for an appetizer, which I recalled to be unbelievably delicious a previous time, and 3 sushi rolls.   The couple sitting next to us had complained of water dripping on their table, which it was and had to be moved.  Immediately, the table was reset and another poor couple was seated there and had the same dilemma where they too had to move.   Nearly 30 minutes later, I am very upset.  The iced tea that I had asked to be remade and unsweetened this time was not on my table.  I was ready to say forget it when it was finally dropped off along with the sushi and calamari.  Starving and not too happy with my experience, I expected the calamari to be life changing.  It was the worst, most rubbery calamari I have had in ages and cold.  Clearly it had been sitting ages cooking under the heat lamp before it was brought to the table.  My friend who was a chef agreed with me and we sent that back too.  The server (a man this time) said he was going to taste it and comes back to the table arguing with us that it was only a ""little rubbery"".  First rule of customer service.  DO NOT argue with the customer.  This is coming from a hospitality student and I know the right way to be treated. I asked for the calamari to be remade.  I understand places have off nights but this was the third strike on my experience.  The server said he was going to make sure it came out hot this time.  After we finished our sushi, the calamari was still not on the table.  For something that takes a max of 4 minutes, I knew that it was not going to be piping hot or fresh and proceded to get the check.  2 seconds after dropping it off, the server tried grabbing it out of my friend's hand and seemed unbothered about the experience that I had just had.  It took 5 minutes for them to come back to the table as we were waiting for change but at this point I had enough.  I rarely leave a crappy tip but this called for it.  Because I love the food at Thalia, I felt that the owner needed to be aware of the awful service and called the restaurant to speak to him or a manager where I was hung up on, then called back and told the owner was not there anymore.  I find that hard to believe.  Anyways, it is unfortunate that a regular customer has been lost and the staff really needs to learn the basics of keeping their customers, not driving them away.",0.8837,0.805,0.1,0.094,0.49665399415399425

Entree's were priced anywhere from 11 bucks up to 25.  I like that with most dishes they gave you a choice of meat or vegitarian.  As an appetizer we went with the spicy edamame'.  It's only $4 and they give you 2-3 cups of pods.  The spice was quite warm, lol.   I ordered the the Chili Peppers with beef, and Jim had the Curry Duck.  I liked what I ordered but I LOVED the curry Jim had.  It was so good that we will go back just for that dish.  You can get it with any of the meats they offer if you're not a fan of the duck. The portions were perfect for a single meal.  We left full but not that uncomfortable stuffed.   It's nice when you get these ginormous portions and can get another meal out of your dinner but I tend to overeat with portions like that, not to mention most people don't realize that the price is much more with larger portions. We didn't order any sushi but saw it as it was going to various other tables and it looked good.  The sushi prices were average and If we didn't already have a favourite sushi place in the burbs we'd try it.

The layout of the place can be considered cozy, but I might just call it cramped. We were seated in a completely different area up on a little fenced in spot with 2 other tables and a weird center table that had candles and a water pitcher on it. I was constantly afraid of knocking something over, it was that tight. It was also weird because we were sitting RIGHT next to these two ladies and I feel like I could hear everything they were saying, probably because there was little to no music happening. Now, being a designer, I immediately was grossed out by the menus. They looked homemade, which I don't mind if it's done right. The paper felt like it would rip any given second, and the spreads only had one page of content. Not effective or pretty. Anyway, the boyfriend got the One Night In Bankok and I had the Pear Saketini, and his was definitely better. Mine was a bit too dry for my taste, hardly any asian pear in there, but it was still good. We also got the saigon roll, which both of us really liked. There were huge pieces of shrimp inside and the mint was really fresh and fragrant. I'd definitely recommend them! Next up was our food. My boyfriend got the duck curry which he loved and I thought was pretty good (though I'm not a big curry fan) and the serving was just right. I got the drunk noodles with shrimp which I thought were pretty good. Definitely heavy on the basil, which I liked, but I realize some people might not.

2011-04-17,2.0,"I had expectations (not necessarily high ones) for Thalia Spice considering Im always looking for decent thai, add some sushi for variety, and I was thinking this could be a new go to delivery option.  Review for delivery once: Speed: Medium (45 minutes), not too bad and a decent start I decided to go for my go 2's in both of the previously mentioned categories (Thai and Sushi), Thalia Lard Nar with chicken and a spicy tuna roll, both classic and simple enough. We added on a singapore crab rangoon (jalapeno added somehow equates to singapore) and a river boat noodle, described as, ""just like it's made in the Bankok River Canals"", although Im pretty sure that would be a seriously disrespectful thing to tell one of those river canal cooks in comparison. The RB noodles consisted of steak over rice noodles with bean sprouts, green onions and clearish-brown broth. I added the spicy chilli sauce as well for flavor. The main issue with this dish for me may have been that it had to be delivered. While they did a great job with the packaging of the individual ingredients, the ingredients just didnt have a whole lot of flavor when combined and never seemed to get cozy together. The rangoon suffered from the same delivery deficit, as the once crispy wonton wrappers had become soggy and limp. Lard nar was equally unimpressive, but delivered piping hot. The noodles were actually above average, but the oily charred sauce lacked any real character. As for the spicy tuna, even it was a dissapointment. Im unbelievably easy to please when it comes to a spicy tuna roll, but somehow they managed to really bomb on this one, delivering a pureed mess of orange/red glopp stuffed inside a thick, undigestable wrapper. The percentages of tuna slop/rice left the palate with a consistency of shrimp gumbo. I would not recommend this item, keeping in mind the dine in experience may be drastically different. It is what it is, when it comes to delivery, Thalia Spice does not. Too much Thai out there that will give you a better bang for lesser buck.",0.6548,0.888,0.063,0.049,0.475206967635539

But I was on a mission to have a spicy chicken dish of one kind or another.  I ordered the chicken ginger soup as an appetizer.  It appeared to be chicken broth with some cut up slices of red onion, cilantro, and chili paste.  It had several (3-4) very small pieces of chicken (rubbery and not tasting all that fresh) as well. I ordered the Thai dish that claims to be ""five spices hot"" or something like that.  It had 3 'hot' indicators on the menu, so I was expecting to be drinking lots of iced tea (I ordered the 'American' iced tea and it was the best part of the meal) and, to my disappointment, it totally lacked spicy hotness.  Not only that, it lacked any flavor, other than the basil leave (I think that's what it was) tossed into it.  The dish was a small serving (for $10-12).  Several (4-6) small pieces of diced/sliced chicken, spaghetti noodles, and some cut up green/red peppers.  Blah.  What a waste!  I live close to Panang Noodles on Chicago and not far from Tiparo's (near North Ave) and both are WAY better in every way. Finally, the decor is from hell.  Red and black, rock music, and some (now ancient) free TV promoting various items in the restaurant and neighborhood (thought these went bye-bye years ago).  Look around if you go--look up and you'll see the dirtiest ceiling with all kinds of stuff hanging from it (I know it's loft space, but it can look rustic and CLEAN).  Look down and see the concrete floor with the paint job from hell and dirt in every nook and cranny.  If you dare, go to the bathroom.  I am not tall, but the urinals are made for basketball players (in a pan-asian restaurant?).  Also, the john was not clean.  Not even close.  Came home and had a bowl of granola to feel full and am praying I don't have to hang around my (clean) bathroom later.

We walked into the restaurant and were a little confused with the entrance. There was no place to wait and it got really crowded with other diners. I think they should put some thought into redoing the entrance and make it more inviting and less confusing. We weren't sure if there was another door or where we could stand so we weren't in the way. One star off for the weird entrance.  After about 5 minutes or so, we were seated. The menu was extensive with a lot of variety. One of the owners was extremely welcoming and he came over to our table and went over each page with us which was really helpful and super nice.

The management needs to plan ahead for president's day next year because there was only 1 server for around 25-30 customers in the entire restaurant and nobody was very happy about it. Out of the two tables closest to us, one walked out and the other was disappointed  when they didn't get the soup they ordered after waiting a long time. The owners need to step up and wait tables in situations like this, instead of letting a waiter try and run the place on their own. we felt sorry for the server being set up, she seemed discombobulated. We ordered a thai iced coffee which, unfortunately never came and then waited longer than we'd have liked for orders of pad thai and green curry to get to the table. The wait wouldn't have bothered us if they weren't blaring whiny djs and commercials for jack fm on the radio , whose speaker was located directly above our table. The pad thai was below average and the green curry was less spicy than advertised but we chowed down anyway. Some sauce would have been nice for our meals when the food came out.  Maybe they could have it on the tables so it is there and we don't have to ask for it. It eventually came after we flagged down the server , but by that time we were halfway done.  The place is trying too hard to be too many different things. The music seemed like its from the gym, the red velvet drapes hanging everywhere-even over the windows- looked like they were purchased from a club going through bankruptcy liquidation, and the Thai food was barely so so, and overpriced at 10 per dish. I would say the pad thai and green curry were worth $5.95 each, at the very most. I can't think of anything else to complain about except we had to have the check sent back and amended because they tried to charge us for the iced coffee we never received.

I got the curry mee and thai iced tea. The curry mee that I received was not what was described on the menu. Instead of coming with bean sprouts, they threw some uncooked noodles on top? Were they out of bean sprouts? Not to mention the fact that it tasted like cup noodles in curry sauce. The portions we received also looked fairly small, like they gave us the lunch portions even though we ordered off their ""regular"" menu (if this is indeed untrue and they did give us the regular dinner portions, then those were extremely small and I would never pay the price to come here for dinner, although this may be a moot point since the food sucked to begin with).

I was leary about ordering the sushi, as I am in most instances where it would appear the sushi was added as an after thought to the original menu, but theirs is fantastic. The fish is high quality and the pairings and inventiveness in flavours and sauces earn them extra marks, too.  Back to the Thai, it is some of the most authentic I've had in this city. The flavours, the preparation and the ingredients all appear, to my palate, to be a true representation of Thai cuisine. Whether that will appeal to the masses, I don't know. I find a lot of the places that earn the highest marks around here are ones that have heavy, milky dishes that bear no resemblence to anything I've actually eaten in Thailand. The wait staff was fantastic, albeit a bit slow. But the bottom line is this -- they know their menu, which is something you cannot say about many of the waitstaff in restaurants in this price range. They even warned that the Golden Triangle dish consisted of a red curry coconut milk that is slightly curdled. Hadn't occurred to me but was a very good call as I don't suspect many diners would have expected that if they'd not ordered anything like that in an authentic Thai restaurant before. The price is a bit steep but worth the splurge.",0.9517,0.87,0.097,0.033,0.4675757575757576
2010-08-26,4.0,"I'd always been fond of Thalia Spice, as it's one of the restaurants my company caters lunch from on Fridays.  It is definitely one of the more popular choices, as the line up would begin extra early and people would fight over the limited quantities of sushi.  But I only really developed an appreciation for Thalia upon visiting the restaurant. Both times I have been now, I have been consistently impressed by the laid-back atmosphere (I just feel so relaxed whenever I'm there) and the courteous service.  I have yet to try the outdoor patio area, but I can imagine that it only takes the Thalia experience to the next level! I went on a Thursday and enjoyed their $5 Martini special (the guavatini I ordered was quite smooth).  The chicken satay was pretty standard tasty fare, but what really hit the spot were the two dishes I ordered thereafter: the Kama Sutra -- a sensuous blend of mussels, ebi, and crab topped with caviar that totally hit the spot, and Fire Maguro -- a deep fried tuna roll with a magical combination of spice.  I sampled some of my friends' dishes, and they weren't bad, but the two dishes I just mentioned ... yeah, they were divine!",0.9891,0.781,0.191,0.028,0.5861283643892339

They don't make them like the standard small bite-sized maki, these are the large sized ones. To be honest, all I have tried here is the Pad Thai, egg rolls, and various maki rolls - guess I'm a creature of habit.

The yellow curry in the Roti Canai was a disappointment and didn't quite have the same texture and taste as the one from Penang. The Chicken Makhani was an even bigger disappoint, being too sour and lacking a proper balance of the spices in what's supposed to be a butter based sauce.

The Ya Ya Noodles are delicious as well. We used to go there all the time but do not go often now because of one issue - they have one of the worst servers (the ""fuller"" Asian waitress) that I have ever come across. When my fiance (who never complains about food and is the nicest person ever) got a bad piece of Toro and sent it back, the server (for no less than 5 minutes) told him that everyone else thought it was ""super-fresh"" and kept on basically telling him that it was his problem not theirs. I had to finally say ""look, he said it is bad and it is not fresh. There is nothing less to say."" She finally let it alone. Ana ended up comping us on something to make up for it.

Lighting is very important to me and Thalia gets an A+. They also have a huge vegetarian selection with many dishes offering a choice of meats (including tofu). My husband and I started out with spicy edamame and got the Basil Noodles and the Asian Fire Spicy rice dish (or something like that) for entrees. My one complaint would be that this dish promised to be very spicy and it just wasn't. Next time I might ask for it spicy and see what happens. Regardless, both dishes were wonderful.  The noodles were pan seared and tasty and there were a lot of vegetables on both plates.  We also had the mango sticky rice for dessert.

I was only slightly disappointed in the portions, but I'm probably being greedy ;-) Appetizer: Red Sea Calamari - LOVED the masala sauce and even kept it to mix with my noodles and rice. This was a nice twist on the traditional calamari. A must try if you like calamari. Main Courses: Thalia Lard Nar - the rice noodles mixed with the sauce and vegetables had a great flavor. We were expecting more noodles...but this sure was tasty. Definitely recommended. Yellow Curry - Tasty. Nothing too special... The prices were okay.

I couldn't finish my bowl of curry while trying to eat all my rice to compensate for the sweetness. The duck was alright, still boned in the curry (which I think is fine, given that that's how we do it in Thailand anyways).  2. Dragon roll The seafood was not as fresh as we were hoping but it was alright at best. Nothing fancy or to rave about. 3. Beef panang - Curry once again was a little on the sweet side, but not as sweet as the duck curry. There were an okay amount of beef but once again, just alright and nothing to rave about.

I suppose the main point I want to get across is that the service was very friendly and attentive.  Everything came out when it should and the timing was spot on.  I noticed they were particular is asking us when we wanted certain items served since we did order a hodgepodge.  Perhaps the restaurant became aware of the negative comments about their service and is making a renewed effort.  In any case, Thalia is now one of my favorite Asian spots in the city.

On to the food:  We ordered three things to share.  A salsa Latino roll to start off with (except it arrived late to the game, after we already started in on our other two dishes).  We also ordered one lard nar and one Indonesian curry mee.    The curry mee was a delicious mix of rich, spicy, and hot curry and a mixture of crunchy and soft noodles.   the lard nar was also delicious, and bedecked with fresh, crunchy veggies.

Their noodles and main dishes are good - the pad thai, for example is excellent and their curries are always tasty.  The only noodles I've had that I didn't like were the River Boat and the Drunken Spice noodles.  Just didn't hit me right, but I have a different palate than you, so maybe those will be your favs. Apps are delish and sushi is ok.  Sushi is the main reason for the four stars.  There are good rolls you can order, like the Thalia Rolls, but for the main part the sushi doesn't taste as fresh or flavorful as other places who specialize in it (like OySy or Cafe Sushi).  By no means are they disgusting, just a little on the bland side.  This doesn't stop my boyfriend or me from ordering or eating out there at least four-five times a month, if not more. The atmosphere is cool and I love, love, love the decor.  Yes, the tables are very close together.

2008-12-12,2.0,2.5 stars... We came here for one of my Indian friend's bday.  The food wasn't so delicious that I crave coming back and it wasn't disgusting either.  It was just whatever.  I guess the food just wasn't memorable for me because as I'm thinking about what I had to eat I can't even remember.  We went with a pretty large group so waiting for our tables took awhile because there was another large party inside celebrating a bridal shower.  They have limited seating for larger parties of 10+.  They had opened not too long ago and was still finalizing their menu I think.  One of the owners was there and he was really nice and would come out to check on us to give us updates on the table opening up so we could move our party inside.  Since it was the summer it was a nice night outside.  We did get some appetizers to start on outside.  I think it was the spring rolls.  Pretty unforgettable.  I don't know it's just nothing tasted really authentic.  We even saw Chicken Mahkni on the menu and we ordered that since everyone at the table was Indian and they wanted to try it.  That too was pretty unforgettable.  It  was good and not disgusting just boring.  Why we ordered Indian food at a Thai fusion restaurant...well maybe it was cuz everybody was frigging Indian and my wife and I were the minority.  I think the only thing I remember eating is the fried rice and that was decent.  other reviewers give pretty good reviews so I might just go back try it again when I'm in Chicago.,0.9886,0.83,0.151,0.019,0.6876436781609196

I was here on a Wednesday night with a party of four and the service was great. Granted, it was early and the middle of the week, but still, it was great service. They never hovered but they never neglected the table. It is also good to point out that they pour a stiff drink; My friend had to ask for more soda water, which is a rare request. On to the food. We all ordred soup to start with, and they were very accommodating to our special requests. I, unfortunately, ordered a spicy soup and was not able to eat it, but that was my fault. I hate spicy stuff. My friends enjoyed their soup. For the main course, we all ordered a variation of the YaYa noodles. Beef, chicken, or extra tofu. We all loved it. The meal was not too oily (like some Thai) and the portions were filling but not disgustingly large. I would really recommend this place.

That is because my roommate and I both tried to order things different from the menu but were told by our waitress we couldn't, only to have the manager come over at the end of the night and tell us next time of course we can order whatever we want. Looking forward to that. As for what we had, the Fire Dragon sushi roll was definitely the highlight. It was about as close to perfect as you can get. The lettuce wraps app I wouldn't get again. It didn't have enough flavor and could've really used some kind of dipping sauce. I ordered the Lard Nar which I was told by the waitress would be a good substitute for the Pad Siew I really wanted. It wasn't, but it was good enough. I almost forgot the mangos and sticky rice! They were wonderful enough that I would go back for that alone. Also drinks....glad to see they had some cocktails. My mango martini was pretty good. Loved being there on $5 Wednesday wine night where you can get any wine by the glass for just $5. I got a few glasses of a pretty decent chardonnay out of that deal. Our helpful manager also let us try the white & red sangria at the end of the night for free in exchange for our reviews of it. Red was better but I wouldn't order either.

First, drinks.  My friend and I shared a $5 order of sake.  Can't beat that!!  (In case you didn't know, heating sake takes all the complexity and finer points out of it... so, if you are like me and like warm sake, don't waste your money on the expensive stuff).  On the other hand, my husband ordered a gin martini and they seemed thoroughly befuddled.  (They listed the types of gin they had on hand... Capt Morgan's, Bombay and Tequila).  His drink was $10 + $3 for the Bombay + $1 for extra olives.  So have the cheap sake and skip the gin martinis. Second, apps.  We had the Roti Canai and some veggie Thai spring rolls.  The spring rolls were fine, and the Roti was very tasty.  (I'd recommend ordering extra naan with it though). Third, entrees.  I had the Indonesian Curry Mee with Shrimp.  It was messy but quite delicious in a spicy coconut milk kind of way.  My 4 year old daughter, leading international expert on Pad Thai, gave her meal a big thumbs up (partially thanks to the fact that they made it without any veggies for her).  My friend had Panang Curry, and was very pleased.  And my husband had the Scallops w/ Garlic Sauce and thought they were a trifle on the ordinary side.

Also, even though I LOVED my curry dish, they were less than generous with the chicken.... I seriously think I had about 5 fair-sized slices.  Service was not good.  The wait staff seemed to be disorganized and confused for most of the meal.  Furthermore, they actually had the nerve to charge us for the late gyoza.  They did not remove it from our check even though they absolutely should have.   This restaurant was fairly dead considering it was prime-time on a Saturday night.  I don't know if it's the current economic situation, or what,  but empty restaurants generally make me nervous.

I won't blast a place for this inconvenience since it just happens but I suggest their staff to keep patrons informed to keep frustrations low. The other gripe is just not that easy to ignore.

We got a curry dish and coconut shrimp to start off and both were very good, although tiny (but priced accordingly).  We also ordered 2 rolls- the Rising Sun (mmmmmmm good) and the Thalia Roll (we are suckers for always ordering the roll named after the restaurant).  Both were solid, and I'd for sure order the Rising Sun again Also note- the ""taste"" part of the menu really are very small.  That should go without saying I guess, but you might not be paying that close attention to where you are in the menu. I've had the coconut shrimp and I think there are 3 pieces.  The cons: You better learn to love thy neighbor, because you will be eating on top of him or her.  Some of these tables were just WAY too crowded together, and they should really rethink that because if I had to sit in the same spot again I wouldn't come back.  Now I didn't get to see much of the place because we were seated very close to the front door and I never ventured around- maybe the whole seating arrangement is not that awkward.   AND the biggest CON: $5 corkage ($10 for liquor)? Really? Can I just bring my own corkscrew? For $5 they better be pouring, but they did not in fact pour the wine.  Sure I can do it myself, and to be fair, she did give us a ""wine bucket"" but if I've got to pay that corkage fee, well I want some more service to go with it.  Since the fee is per bottle I'd recommend bringing the biggest damned bottle of wine you can find (we also had a little bottle of sake that we decided against since the corkage fee was probably more than the bottle cost us).  Would it be poor form to bring a box of wine?  I am really happy to have learned of the existence of this place because I can so rarely think of something I feel like eating in the neighborhood- great find.   It has also become a very useful delivery option (although be careful about trying to order online for a specific time- I don't think they pay attention as the one time I tried it, the order came 2 hours earlier than I had requested.  They came back later, but I'm not entirely convinced they didn't just bring the same food 2 hours later, because on a previous delivery the food was tastier.  Could just be an unfortunate coincidence though!)",0.9891,0.823,0.125,0.052,0.4750617283950617

The menu is very large, everything on the menu looked delicious and it was very hard to choose between so many different items.  We ordered the spring rolls (vietnamese style ones), crab rangoon, and the lettuce wraps.  The spring rolls were standard - it is hard to mess those up.  I loved the presentation of the lettuce wraps, it come already prepared for you and are set in little sake cups so all you have to do is pick up the lettuce wrap and pop it in your mouth.  The sauce that came with the lettuce wraps was absolutely delicious, I could have just eaten that with lettuce and rice!  Sadly it all went downhill for me from there.   I ordered the golden triangle which on the menu was described as a mix of shrimp, scallops, squid, basil in a red curry sauce.  Sounds good right?  Ok it came prepared in a little round mold wrapped in foil.  When they brought it to our table I thought they had made a mistake because I certainly did not order a casserole!   No where on the menu did it mention that it was some type of breaded casserole, I mean where was the red curry?  So it was not what I expected at all nor did it taste that great either.  Also I just ate around the casserole part and just tried to pick out what I could of the seafood.  My friends got the beef curry, pad thai, and a sushi roll - all standard.  My friend Laura was really looking forward to her curry and naan.  I was also excited to taste the naan, and what bothered me the most is that instead of naan, they give you a roti pancake and try to pretend that it is naan.  OK seriously?  You can't give someone an order of roti and cut it up into little triangles and pretend that it is naan.   Hello, we know the difference!   The dessert was the nail in the coffin.  We order the chocolate lava cake which on the menu even said it was served warm.  What came to our table was this little solid oval brown thing, that one had no ice cream on top of it (who serves molten lava cake without ice cream) and when we took a bite of it we realized why, the cake was cold as ice and tasted like it came from your grocer's freezer section.  I have never in my life sent a dessert back but this was my first time sending it back.  I will never go back to this again!!",0.9567,0.879,0.081,0.039,0.48801406926406926

No. The people that mentioned the GIANT menu are right . . . its a bit overwhelming. Do a few things and do them RIGHT, people. This is a ""hot spot""?

It offers exposed brickwork on the walls which I am a new fan of.  The menu has something to cater to pretty much every ASIAN food pick including a sushi bar, Thai, Singaporean Noodles, Malaysian Roti Canai and Indian Chicken Tikka masala. Needless to say, visit the website for a complete listing.  Yay!! Thalia is still BYOB!!!

2008-01-04,3.0,"As I am in the area for work a few nights a week, and am often hungry, I have eaten food from Thalia Spice a number of times. The best description of both the food and the service at this place is hit or miss.  I often go the take-out route, and find that they get the order right about 50% of the time. I once ordered the Cashew Chicken as a take out order. It was loaded with chicken and cashews. It was great. I ordered it again and there were no cashews and only a small amount of chicken. The sushi can be really good or it can taste and smell ultra-fishy (fish should never smell like fish as its a sure sign that the fish is old or maybe even bad). The service can be great or horrible too. When I have eaten in, I have ended up with a server who was great. She explained different items on the menu and was quite attentive, a feat considering how busy the restaurant was at the time. I have also ended up with servers who could barely speak English, couldn't talk about anything on the menu, and weren't very attentive at all despite the restaurant not being very busy. For take out, I have waited 5 minutes or 25 minutes for the same order regardless of how busy the restaurant was.

2007-12-15,1.0,"By in large I have found the Yelp community to be fairly accurate in their reviews.   However, in this case I....  You know what enough with the bullshit... This place sucked. The food was horrible. The service was horrible. The patchouli incense that stank up the joint was horrible. First off when my friend MIKE made the reservation the lady who answered the phone asked him how to spell it. M - I - K - E. My grandma had a parakeet that could spell David.  We arrived to an empty restaurant at 6:30 (with a 6:30 reservation) and we were sat directly next to the only other diners in the entire restaurant.  To make matters worse, our table was as wobbly as my mom's drunk husband.  We asked for a table change and that's when the wheels fell off.  In all honesty there were two tables seated which left about 20 tables open and they couldn't find another table for us. 10 seconds after receiving our menus a man, which we assumed was the owner, asked if we had any questions.  At this point the only question I had was, ""May I please have a few minutes to formulate some questions?""   We asked this man if we could have some more time to look through the menu before asking for his suggestions. After having a few moments to peruse the menu we then solicited his opinions.  He basically said that everything was his favorite. We started with two orders of Super White Nigiri. The rice was not too sticky and the fish was OK.  We then had the Malaysian Roti Canai and the Mango Seared Scallops.  The Malaysian Roti Canai was described as chicken curry with traditional naan.  First off there was nothing traditional about this greasy flimsy flour tortilla-esque naan they served. I have had better naan at Taco Bell.  The chicken curry served with this naan had little flavor and almost no chicken.  If you like cold, fishy, small, chewy scallops with salty mango salsa then I strongly recommend the Mango Seared Scallops.  If like me you dislike things that suck, then I'd stay away from the Mango Seared Scallops.  Our third and final appetizer was the Thai Style Grilled Pork.  The pork was extremely overcooked and tasted like crap.  Finally, Mike and I shared the River Boat Noodles.  The broth was actually very tasty and perfect for a cold snowy winter evening. However, the beef was bland and chewy.  The worst part about the meal was at the end we were still hungry. The decor was ok.  I really liked the layout of the space.  However, with all those empty tables, I haven't quite figured out why we couldn't have been sat in any of them.  The owner spent more time on their new Open Table machine than paying attention to his guests and the service was, in a word, ""strange."" At the end of our meal, our server stopped by and asked how our meal was and our response was ""not good.""  The owner then came by to solicit our opinions.  We walked him through the entire meal dish by dish. We commented on the seating issues and the fact that the entire space smelled of patouchli incense.  He asked if we would share our opinions with one of the kitchen staff.  We agreed and he offered us 10% off of our meal. We declined the discount and invited the member of the kitchen staff to our table. We went through our issues with the food and all that she said was that all the cooks were Thai. I'm not sure what she was trying to get at, because I have some Italian friends that couldn't boil water. I know this is going to sound horrible, but we actually ordered food from another Thai restaurant from our table.  On the way home we picked up a spicy crunchy tuna roll and an order of chicken pad se ew from Butterfly and had a yummy final course. You know what, I'm just gunna stop. This restaurant was horrible and I would advise all to steer clear.  If Yelp allowed 0 stars, I would have given 0 stars. 1 Thai Style Grilled Pork (App) 1 Thais Style Grilled Shrimp (App) 1 Mango Seared Scallop (App) 1 River Boat Noodle 1 Wine Corkage 1 Malaysian Roti Canai (App) 4 Pieces of Super White Tuna Nigiri (App) -------------------------------------------------------------- $50.00",0.8645,0.88,0.067,0.053,0.609781180676703
