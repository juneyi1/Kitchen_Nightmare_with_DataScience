2017-08-18,4.0,One of chicago's all time classic restaurants . This is our go to for family occasions as well as just for a satisfying meal through the week . They don't offer a kids menu BUT you simply ask for a 1/2 portion of any of the menu items . ALL of the desserts are made to share (see photos )... so don't make the mistake of over ordering and wasting so much yummy food .  We love to sit out side and take in the sites . Giirdanos is right across the street .. which is always crazy busy with tourists waiting for hours for a table .,0.9197,0.773,0.169,0.057,0.5074404761904762

My friend and I wanted the cake, so we each had an appetizer- I had the veggie side dish with a small pasta bowl and my friend-- the bruschetta with some roasted red peppers on the side.  Our appetizers were good- I enjoyed the olive oil and pepper sauce on the fettucini (which was thick and homemade and yummy) and the steamed spinach had a really great garlic and oil drizzled over it- plus there was also asparagus and broccoli with some nice fresh lemon to squeeze over it.  YUM.  There were four good sized pieces of a good bread with a PILE of tomatoes, olives, cheese, etc. on the bruschetta.   The CAKE was magnificent- we cut off two thin slices and had at least half left over which we took with us.  So creamy and richly flavored.....  REALLY good. We had a young server- I wish I could remember his name.  He was the nicest boy, so attentive and kind.  All of the various waitstaff were great, so personable and attentive- but this boy was just so nice.   We had a great time sitting outside and people watching and just had a great visit as well.  It might have been a bit pricey, but I would pay for it again.",0.9913,0.794,0.194,0.012,0.6033950617283951

We had no idea what to expect and aren't connoisseurs of Italian food. I ordered lasagna that was a special. My son ordered his standard fettuccine alfredo - not fancy or exotic choices. We had to wait a little while for our food, but the server continually checked on us and let us know they were working on our food. It turned out there was some controversy because they were running out of lasagna. I did get mine though, and it was fabulous. The pasta was obviously fresh and made in-house. We both ordered simple dishes, but they were fantastic. The fettuccine alfredo was the best I've ever had. The pasta was amazing, and the sauce was excellent. We got chocolate cake for dessert that was huge and delicious. We both ate until we were stuffed and took home most of the cake. The server also sent me home with a take-out box of more pasta because she said my lasagna piece was smaller than it should have been (I didn't even mention or notice the portion size and didn't eat it all). The service was great. The food was great. The atmosphere was great. And we didn't have to wait at all to be seated. Stumbling into Rosebud completely by accident worked out great.

We initially elected to sit outside; however, it became so windy and the waitress was kind enough to take us inside. The inside dining area is so beautiful and elegant. The only downside to this restaurant is the prices. I do believe they are overpriced, aside from the pasta dishes. That is likely because they are right by Michigan Ave where it is very touristy.

I would pay the price again in a heartbeat, I'm not complaining  3. We got our table and we were still waiting for one other guest and got bread and water while waiting 4. Our server was fantastic and totally engaging and tried to crack some jokes with us  5. We ordered Caesar salads around and I got the minestrone soup! Totally recommend both! The minestrone was fantastic!  6. Our water was refreshed often, which was fantastic!!  7. I ordered the cheese ravioli-and honestly I wasn't too impressed with it and while I would come back I would order something else. Which would be easy because they have a great selection.

2017-02-27,2.0,"A group of ten had a 8:00 PM reservation. Upon timely arrival, our table was not ready until 8:45 PM, so we were told we could wait at the bar. Nothing like over booking. I guess if the bar had seating and we were not left to stand in the aisle, hovering over folks trying to dine it would not be such a big deal. The other patrons after all would like to enjoy their meal as well and without a group of strangers standing over them. We drank wine which was tasty and flavorful. Upon seating our table for 8 was ready, the only problem there were 10 of us. You guessed it, we all squeezed in. The waiter was good but  sometimes you felt like he was scolding you. Funny at first but not later in the dinner. Our meals were served and of course you guessed it again, one guest had to wait 10 minutes for his meal while everyone else had their dinner. Okay, they were busy. Now comes actually eating the meal, tasty sea bass in my case with a bit of spinach and cappers. Due to being seated at a table that was much too small this was no easy task. The main dish was fine, well prepared as were the appetizers of calamari and sausage and peppers. However and again you want to eat comfortably without putting your elbow into your friends ribs when you try to put the food in your mouth. We passed on desserts, enough torture for one night. Ah yes and the bill. Five bottles of moderately priced wine and our meals came to $90 per person which included the tip. That is what you expect and similar to other restaurants in the area in terms of price. The dining experience however will not be repeated by me. The next time we get together, we will dine at the Italian Village. I know for a fact that we will have a table for 10 at the time requested.

We were offered extra virgin oil but no fresh cracked pepper. The bread was so cold and hard I asked if it was meant to be served that way. Sorry folks, the bread is going to be cold this is the way it is served. Next my husband wanted lasagna, guess what folks not on the menu.

As the waiters walked around in their pencil skirts, button downs, and slacks, the hostesses walked around in crop tops and bodycon skirts, which I find to honestly be a little unprofessional. And with the price you pay to eat here, I don't think it's a wild claim to make. The bread they gave my friend and I was completely old. It looked like it had been rifled through, and was completely old, stale, hard, and cold. It seemed as if they had literally given us bread that was leftover from a previous diner. Gross. We had to request new bread, which quite honestly, was extremely average. The stuffed mushrooms were pretty good- they were honestly average, nothing spectacular, and honestly overly salty. The cavatelli was inedible. The sauce was ridiculously salty, and was cold when it arrived. The cavatelli was hard, dense, and not light nor airy. It definitely was not worth the $25 that it cost, as it was absolutely terrible. It was not a good dining experience, and I don't think I'll be coming back.

2016-03-09,1.0,"If you want terrible service and awful food, this is the place to be. This establishment makes Olive Garden look like a 5 star restaurant in the realm of Italian cuisine. My coworkers and I asked for a table of 5 at 7:10pm when the restaurant was half empty. They sat us right in front of the kitchen hallway, which was a busy intersection throughout our meal. Frankly, it wasn't the most aesthetically pleasing view. After looking over the very unimpressive menu, we quickly ordered our food - basic dishes of 3 pastas and 2 steaks (not even well done). We were grew quite hungry so we reluctantly ate most of the bread on the table.  Our necks grew long with disappointment as every dish came out from the kitchen, just to learn they were for other tables.  Due to our convenient seating location, our waiter walked by us multiple times but failed to acknowledge our existence every time. After flagging him down, we finally got our main dishes at around 8:15pm.   You would think the food would be redeeming, but it wasn't. Our waiter did not even offer us any fresh grated Parmesan cheese or fresh pepper, even though we spotted them just a few feet away from us.  My basic tortellini with ""prosciutto,"" mushrooms and peas was so unappetizing I was only able to force down a few bites before I had to call it quits. The ""prosciutto"" bits tasted like rubber, the tortellini was thick and dry, and frankly there were about 5 small itty bitty mushrooms that played hide and seek with me. The peas were the best part of the dish, sadly. Not to mention my Baked Clams were very fishy.  They did not taste fresh at all.  How does an Italian restaurant screw up pasta and baked clams??? By the time we were asked if we wanted dessert, we were skeptical and asked if it would be fast. The waiter had the audacity to tell us our dinner service was the normal amount of time - quoting 25-30 minutes. When we told him it was a lot longer than that, he denied it. This, above all, was the most aggravating.  It was waste of our time and certainly an embarrassment to the other fine Chicago restaurants to the city.

We had the regular calamari for an appetizer and it was amazing! Cooked perfectly and they gave us a generous portion of calamari and sauce.  I then had the Chicken picatta. The chicken was extremely tender and the sauce was perfect. It came with a side of pasta, but not like what usually comes with Picatta. It was rigatoni with red sauce. I was expecting spaghetti in the lemon sauce. Either way, it was delicious! My boyfriend got the Rigatoni alla vodka with chicken. This too was DELICIOUS! I am a huge fan of both of these dishes to begin with, so I am usually critical of both. They were both delicious and I would recommend them!  The bill came to about 77$. This was with a side and a beer. It was less than we were expecting. I highly recommend this place for good Italian!",0.9925,0.709,0.261,0.03,0.6066769230769231

To celebrate some great team successes, we arranged to go out to dinner together one evening. Ours was a party of 8 people and we had even called ahead to make a reservation at Rosebud on Rush, but we still ended up waiting well over half an hour to be seated (which I would have dinged them a half star if that was an option, but I'm still smiling about the food as I compose this review so I stuck with all five stars). Once we were seated, though, the waitress we had was delightful - and not just her accent - in the helpful way she reviewed all of the specials and made great suggestions when asked for recommendations. The special cocktail that evening was a fabulous type of martini which vodka included a touch of honey syrup along with a light squeeze of fresh lemon and lime juices. We skipped ordering appetizers as it was already rather late in the evening (closing on 9:pm) but very much enjoyed the bread with dipping oil and such. I don't recall what my colleagues ordered, but I got the Tortellini Carbonara. I was seriously tempted to pick up the bowl and lick it clean and this thought despite the incredibly generous proportions of the dish which I couldn't stop myself from finishing (though if I lived there rather than just visiting I would have had plenty to take home for the next day)!  Given the simply amazing calibre of the food I was impressed with the very reasonable prices - would highly recommend as a romantic date restaurant!",0.996,0.752,0.219,0.029,0.6371103896103896

I really liked the ambiance of the restaurant, right in the middle of the beautiful, lively (touristy) part of downtown Chicago.  We got the Veal Milanese which came with a side of pasta, as well as their fettuccini alfredo and a side of vesuvio potatoes. First of all, the bread was really good, and it might have just been because I was starving at that point, but we were both seriously impressed with it. The veal was really filling, loved pairing it with the arugula and lemon. There was so much good looking entrees on their menu that I don't necessarily think the veal is a must try, since I was torn between a few options too, but it was good and I was also happy with the standard pasta that it came with. The alfredo was very creamy and we definitely had to add a lot of extra salt to it. I personally wouldn't order it here just because there are so many good alfredo's there, and it's a little overpriced/underwhelming given all the other options exciting options on the menu. The vesuvio potatoes had a bit of a weird taste to them that I didn't really care for too much - I think I rather would've ordered the french fries. At this point as much as we would've loved to get dessert, we were just absolutely stuffed! Somehow our waiter, who was really great, managed to convince us to just get a half order of gelato. Not sure what the full order would've been but ours was just this tiny scoop of gelato in this huge fancy goblet. I think there are better gelatos in Chicago but if you need to finish off your meal on just that bit of sweetness, this would probably be perfect.  Overall it was definitely a great experience. I think honestly the food was probably a little overpriced, but I think a lot of what you're paying for here is the excitement of being right in the middle of this gorgeous city, especially seated outdoors on a gorgeous day.",0.9988,0.706,0.266,0.028,0.5695342917041029

The pomegranate martini I had to start was perfect.  The calamari/shrimp appetizer was flavorful, generously portioned, and nicely presented. The servings are ginormous (this is not something I particularly like, but I can't criticize them for large portions). Every serving is literally two or three times a normal portion size.  The bad: I ordered lobster risotto. I LOVE RISOTTO. This was not risotto. This was rice  (not arborio) prepared with butter and cheese and with some frozen peas and carrots thrown in. I was so disappointed. There was a nicely presented lobster tail on the side, but as a result, it was a lobster tail with a side of rice, not lobster risotto. My dining partner ordered an unadulterated pasta in Alfredo sauce. He ate four bites. The sauce was chalky and weirdly sweet. There is no freshly grated Parmesan. If you want cheese with your olive oil and bread, it tastes like the powdered kind that comes out of the green Kraft container in the back of your mom's fridge.

Instead I ordered the Rosebud omelet which was good once I added some hot sauce.  There was a lack of seasoning to the omelet as if the chef wanted the ingredients to season each other, but other than the sausage there was none with a strong taste. The peewee potatoes that came on the side were absolutely adorable, but like the omelet, it lacked in flavor.  Lightly dusted with Parmesan, they were cute and fun to eat but I like at least some salt and pepper on my potatoes. Lastly I ordered milk which was served with ice. I am uncertain if their milk was just not chilled and hence the need for ice. (Obviously that's a health hazard)  It was served to me with the other beverages, long before our food. So my milk got rather watered down by the time I was able to enjoy it with my meal.  As for the other dishes at the table, my friend who ordered the omelet had the same feeling as me.  Though he opted for salt at first to add some flavor.  The other dish of Egg Benedict did not raise any comment about flavoring so it is potentially just an issue with the omelet.  Summary: skip the omelet if you want flavor, but if you'd rather flavor your own food then order the omelet it is very large.",0.9806,0.831,0.133,0.036,0.5101746031746033

2014-04-03,2.0,"This was the second in the Rosebud family I've frequented in the last six months. Our first was Carmines.  Which I'll review on another day.  It was Saturday night,  used open table for reservation, arrived and were promptly seated upstairs in a duex that was sandwiched along a long line of 2 tops.  Seriously,  this chain of all of these restaurants really make sure they are getting top dollar for their real estate. We're not big people and could barely cut our food without someone brushing us or banging into us. Doesn't exactly make for a nice experience.  To be noted,  we were and never really are ever in a hurry when we are having a nice dinner out.. so even though our waiter literally did not get our drink order to us for 20 minutes after we sat down..with no appetizers ... it was a tad bit long to wait for just a beverage.. Oh well,  onto to the food...  We opted for no starters and just straight to dinner.  I ordered the Pork Chop and he the Alfredo. We were in no hurry and just into relaxing and I'm sipping my wine. When along came our food (yes, 10 minutes after the wine) OK  we'll go with that.  Except,  when I tried to cut into my chop it was clear this was going to be a feat. When I bit into it.. it confirmed my suspicions. it was super tough and chewy and lastly REALLY dry.. YUK.  my so tried it he agreed. Our waiter was flagged down and I very politely said sorry but I can't eat this (and thinking to myself, it's $32 for this thing,  it HAS to be better!) our server promptly took it away asking what my next preference was? I said, I really wanted another Chop same thing (because the accompanied sauce was excellent and was really looking forward to it this time I asked for a nice ""medium"" he agreed and came back about 7 min later and told me that the kitchen relayed to him that they prep these ahead of time and cook to a MW and that they were out of that chop but could sub another one (that was a different sized cut) I said fine to that as long as they gave me the same accompaniments.  Meanwhile,  I'm thinking to myself? Really?  a. they cook them MW and then b. they admit to that? It all made sense as to why a thick cut pork chop came within 10 minutes of ordering it and WHY it was so tough and dry. So basically the chef told them the truth.  I understood the ""prep"" part to a degree.. but you are selling a $32 dollar thick cut pork chop and cooking them off ahead of time to a MW???  I could almost see a MR THEN putting them back on the grill for a ""medium"" or even MW if that's how the guests really wanted it.. but I doubt that most ""restaurants who charge $32 for a chop are pre cooking them to MW and thinking this is OK.. that just told me the chef didn't have a clue...As if this was not bad enough,  while we were waiting for my do over""  I sampled the Alfredo.. it was really bland..the sauce itself was creamy and the pasta was cooked correctly but it was bland. No nice garlicky or cheesy taste. Weird.  I suggested some salt and pepper and obviously,  at this point,  we're not going to send this back too..so NOW,  I'm thinking that the ""do over"" will not take so long because they will just pull off one that is cooking and give that to me (which is what most restaurants do if it's an item that you have a few on your grill of) so that you can not have one diner eating and the other waiting for your mistake...but it ended up that this time,  it took another solid fifteen minutes to cook and so he just stopped eating until I got my food which meant his food would be cold in addition to bland now. When I got the 2nd do over back,   it was now 2 pork chops (although not as thick because they had apparently ran out of that one by now) but hey,  I didn't care because I was hungry.. well guess what?  These 2 smaller chops were WELL DONE TOO!!  Although, not as well done as the first one but well done still :(  We mentioned this to our waiter just as feedback clearly not going to send it back a 3rd time.. our waiter comped a glass of wine and was gracious enough but he should have asked me how I wanted my Chop cooked in the first place this may have alerted the chef that MW or WD would be unacceptable to me thus avoiding the whole do over thing in the first place..  At this point,  I'm not sure if I would frequent any of them again.  And if I did,  I'd probably just do a lunch or something not too pricey so I wouldn't be disappointed in spending $100+ on a meal for 2p.",0.9911,0.857,0.093,0.05,0.44959349593495934

The parpadelle pasta wasn't what was explained so the manager came out and corrected the issue. Eggplant salad was apparently phenomenal.

Cavatelli Al forno (MUST TRY!): which consists of ricotta dumplings simmered in a marinara sauce with cheeses, topped with mozzarella and baked to perfection in the oven! I wanted to try this per recommendation of our wonderful waiter. I don't know how else to describe this besides deliciousness in a bowl. Cheese, warm pasta with a tangy marinara sauce just played seamlessly together. Some chicken pieces in there would have been great but it was so good it was unnecessary. Love love this dish! 2. Lasagna: Every place makes their lasagna different so it's always fun to try different takes on lasagna. There was quite a bit of meat and cheese in this lasagna but lasagna is just delicious in itself. (I just personally prefer the Cavatelli) :]  Overall, my experience at Rosebuds was wonderful. Portions were quite large and leftovers were phenomenal. Parking was difficult... as usual. So Valet was $12 I believe. It was hefty but it's pretty much impossible to find parking and it's cheaper to valet than to self-park.

2013-08-18,3.0,"My wife has been here several times and has been hoping for the opportunity for the whole family to go for quite awhile.  We had friends visiting us in CHI and it was my wife's 50th birthday.  This was the place she wanted to go.  So we did. It was on a Friday night.  My first impression was that they accepted WAY too many reservations for the speed they can turn tables.  We spent about 15 minutes elbow-to-elbow in the vestibule with others who had reservations. It was EXTREMELY crowded once we got our seats, as well.  The tables are too close together for the amount of customer and server traffic trying to share an aisle to bring food, visit the restroom, etc. We sat downstairs and my first observation was that there was only one exit out of a very long, very crowded room, especially with how narrow any exit would be in an emergency due to how close together the tables are.  I may be a little more picky about this than most people - I deal with fire egress codes as part of my job, and what to do in an emergency was at the back of my mind throughout the whole meal. My second observation was they they don't serve a carpaccio appetizer.  In my opinion, any Italian restaurant that doesn't serve carpaccio should just throw in the towel and make room for the next Chinese place.  Sorry, but that kinda ruined the meal for me a bit as well. There were five of us.  Nobody had any complaints about the food.  I had the Rosebud lasagna and it was good.  The portion was more than I could eat, which is obviously better than the other way around. Service was good as well, but very rushed due to the massive amount of people they were pushing through.   Neither of these make up for the crowd, noise and rushed dining in my opinion and it didn't make for a very good birthday celebration for my wife's 50th, which I am still a little miffed about. We probably won't be back unless it is at a time when it is obviously not very crowded.  Even then, we'd probably just try another place we have never been.  The options in the area are virtually endless.",0.9516,0.884,0.082,0.034,0.43726851851851856

It took 5 minutes for a server to acknowledge us after we sat. Another 10 minutes for my wine to arrive and an additional 5 mins for our orders to be taken. Just very slow service... 1st disappointment of the evening meal. First, we ordered the calamari with marinara. It was cut way to thick and was difficult to chew. It had a very rubbery consistency to it. 2nd disappointment.... As our entrees, we ordered the fettuccine alfredo with shrimp and the house pasta with a side of meatballs. Well, the meatballs were never brought to the table and we decided against asking for them as long as they were not on the bill, which they weren't. The server obviously was not detail oriented when listening for our order. Unfortunately this was not shocking. The house pasta was okay... nothing grand about it. The fettuccine alfredo was horrible, though! Who ever made it did a very poor job. It was all cream!  There was no balance of cheese and cream. It was extremely bland and watery. I've never been so disappointed with an Italian entree before in my existence! 3rd disappointment... To top it off the server took my boyfriend's meal away without asking if he was finished or even asking to box it up. Just quickly picked it up with nothing said and walked away! We were both shocked. I was optimistic that he'd bring it back boxed but it never happened! 4th disappointment... The setting was romantic but the diners on the sidewalk smoking next to the outdoor seating was disgusting. We were sitting out there to enjoy ourselves and instead we're being inundated with disgusting and unhealthy cigarette smoke while we're eating! 5th and final disappointment....!

2013-07-14,5.0,"Every big city should have a Rosebud On Rush - a solid, reliable Italian restaurant where the kitchen never fails to turn out consistently great, classic Italian meals.  I'm not sure why Rosebud On Rush's average stars on Yelp are only 3 1/2.  Urban Spoon goes 4 1/2 and an 89% recommendation rate on a higher number of reviews.  Zagat shows 85% approval from diners.   My own enjoyment of this classic Italian red sauce restaurant easily earns the full five stars.  I would be so bummed if this longtime Chicago favorite ever disappeared.  I've been a huge Rosebud fan - all of them - since Alex Dana opened the first of his many successful restaurants, the original Rosebud on Taylor, back in the early 70's. I was in my 20's then.  My memory is that Rosebud On Rush was his second. No Italian restaurant in this city serves better sausage and peppers, better pasta, better mussels, nor better fish and meats.  None.  This restaurant was the first I ever knew of to serve pappardelle noodles, the large squares of pasta perfection smothered in either Rosebud's best in class red sauce, or meaty Bolognese.  Last night, sitting outside on a spectacularly beautiful Chicago night, I felt like having a great steak.  I know Rosebud restaurants get their beef from Linz, and they are among the finest steaks anywhere.  I had a New York strip last night that was absolutely as tender and flavorful as anything I've ever had in any of Chicago's best steak houses.  Together with the unique and outstanding egg plant salad and a bottle of reasonably priced and delicious Primitivo wine, it was pure al fresco Italian dining heaven. I have always found the service to be 5 star.  Dino Mazzei, the young general manager, has been in charge for years, and he's like a perpetual motion machine, running from kitchen to dining room, inside to outside, always making sure customers are happy.  Johnny Mulligan, a long time server turned assistant general manager, is also always completely tuned in to diners and their dining experience.  So many of Rosebud's servers have been with the company for years, and that kind of experience shows in both their knowledge of the dishes, and their ability to accurately recommend food and wine. I don't know why it took me so many years to finally get around to writing this review.  I should have done it years ago.  I think it might be because Rosebud On Rush has always been here, always great, and so I've taken it for granted.  Classic gems like Rosebud on Rush should never be taken for granted.",0.998,0.775,0.204,0.02,0.4723470973470973

My review: This place was amazing!  I'm absolutely convinced you cannot beat this place for the variety, price, portion, quality, and taste of the dishes offered.   The bread basket showed up immediately and one of the breads offered was a focaccia baked with some tomato sauce.  Very tasty! We started off with the bruschetta  appetizer.  Very fresh tomatoes and great taste.   My wife ordered the chop salad.  The portion was huge!  It pretty much had every vegetable you can think of it.  My wife loved it.  After the bruschetta, I started off with a house salad (huge portion could feed two), and very old school Italian.  A nice light oil and vinegar dressing.  I then ordered the chef's special lemon white fish and a side of rigatoni with their house tomato sauce. My order prompted our waitress to stop writing and say, ""sir, that's a lot of food.""  My wife responded with, ""Don't worry, my husband can really eat.""  Oh, and i didn't disappoint.  I housed everything that they put in front of me.  One of the best meals I've had in a very long time.  I could go on describing the dishes in detail, but there's no point.  Everything I had was phenomenal.  I could have eaten the remaining tomato sauce with a spoon, it was that good.      We closed the meal down with the cannolis and some cappuccino.    You could scour the internet and yelp trying to look for better places to eat in Chicago, but save your time and just head over to Rosebud.  You can't go wrong.",0.9854,0.855,0.131,0.014,0.5431599059376837

Sitting outside and enjoying the weather was perhaps the best part of this place. For a Sunday this place was busy, and the street was happening,  Yet the food and the service was mediocre. Our server was fine, but nothing personable or engaging. We didn't get silverware and had to steal it from an empty table near us. The food was alright, we order the seafood sample to start, I had the Rigatoni alla Vodka for my main and he had the eggplant parmesan. I thought the seafood wasn't fresh enough for my taste - I mean it didn't give me a stomachache or anything, but it could have been a little more appealing to the eyes (the oysters especially). The sauce that came with it was delicious though. The main course was again, just ok. Pasta was rather overcooked and too soft, sauce was decent. He seemed to like his more than I did mine! Portion was very generous but I'm not sure I'm feeling left over soggy pasta!  Maybe it's just me and italian food, but it's so hard to find a good italian spot here.

The service was top notch and our order was quickly filled and served.  I had the crab cakes eggs Benedict which was very tasty and my companions had the French Toast and the omelet.  Everyone was very happy with our order but the French Toast was really more than one could finish so we shared.

I had the pappardelle with pomodoro. The sauce was flavorful and homemade pasta a plus. He had the eggplant parmesean which was enormous and was very well prepared.

A couple of days before I was looking up restaurants in Chicago and the chain had a good reputation but have to say I totally disagree. I know that European cuisine is popular in the US but there are big differences between good and bad restaurants. The Rosebud belongs to the latter. I was able to try the food of my companions and except the Tortellini Carbonara all other dishes (Lasagna - to dry no flavor, Bruschetta - tasted boring, Parpadelle - completely overpriced for simple pasta with tomato sauce) were below average.

So they most certainly have made a name for themselves that exudes ""consistency"".  Our server, Erica, was professional with a wonderful personality that also remained consistent throughout our time there even though the place was packed even at 9pm when we left.  My husband and I are restaurateurs and are pretty critical of the places we eat at.  Although we aren't food snobs, we do focus in on service, cleanliness, food quality, and how the flow of operations effects the customer.  Friendly, efficient host staff upon arrival! A ""good bye and thank you"" on your way out the door.  The bread/water service came with a smile too!  I personally love that!  It tells me that the employees have a pride in their restaurant and that they make money!  I cannot express enough how fresh the food tasted... the sauces so rich and flavorful.  You MUST visit a Rosebud restaurant while in Chicago...if you want to experience authentic, quality Italian food! The only reason I gave Rosebud on Rush only 4 stars vs. 5 stars was because of our pre-dinner experience in the downstairs bar/dining area.  I understand that in the big city these restaurants really pack their customers in right on top of each other.  I do not like this... but must say that the quality of the food over rides my distaste of practically sitting on a stranger's lap.  The bar area had tables pushed right up to the backs of the bar chairs at the bar.  Not to mention there is NO standing room around the bar.  People still gather there and the customers trying to dine at those particular tables literally have people's hind ends right in their faces at eye level.  We watched a particular table get sat twice and both times it took less than 5 minutes before the people just got up and vacated that table.  If I had been sat there, on a first visit, I would have gotten up too and probably just left and not returned.  So I don't know how smart it is to be greedy with the table seating vs. making the experience comfortable for all.  But that is my only negative observation... don't sit in the downstairs dining room :)",0.9191,0.859,0.094,0.047,0.4922458172458173

Also ordering the fried calamai was a bad idea because by the time it got to us, it was packed in a plastic container with a tight lid. Not the fault of the restaurant.

It was topped with mild arugula, red onions and tomatoes. It was a perfect summer meal. (I should have not ordered the salad). The meatballs were large baseballs of tender, perfectly seasoned meat.

Second, our waitress was super adorable and legit Italian. We ordered the mussels to start and they were really excellent, with just the right amount of spice. I ordered an AMAZING pasta dish - the ""cavatelli arrabbiata"" which was SO GOOD. Perfectly spiced tomato sauce, perfectly made pasta, perfectly yummy in my tummy.  We were way too full for dessert (although that came later when I craved some ice cream, hehe) but got some drinks.

When it comes to the pasta, you'll find familiar staples: cavatelli, linguini, ravioli, spaghetti, etc. The portions are fairly large, so you won't go hungry no matter what you order. The meat dishes feature saltimbocca doused in cheese (really? Since when does saltimbocca come with cheese?), chicken in a sad marsala sauce, and breaded parmesan shrimp scampi (yikes! What happened to sautéing the shrimp in butter and white wine?). I'd stick to the pastas, truthfully. The restaurant often has a wait because it's so close to the touristy part of Michigan Avenue. Honestly, it's not worth waiting. You can easily make a same-day reservation on OpenTable if you really want to get into Rosebud.

Seeing that we were on our way out, he asked if we would be opposed to sitting outside. We answered not at all, we'd rather prefer it with the beautiful weather. He asked us to wait a moment.

The alternative being fast food, we figured the offer could not be beaten. 5 minutes later we were sitting at a table on the corner. Perfect spot if you would've asked us. The host introduced us to our server, and the two of them were extremely attentive the entire night.  I should tell you, my girlfriend and I were not and are not made of money, nor did we look it, so I assure you it wasn't that that brought the attention upon us. I'm not sure what was, maybe we looked like two doe-eyed tourist. The only thing I can say is that the wait staff was one of the best I've had in Chicago.  Either way, the service was excellent. I was in the mood for a Sangaria. They, of course, are not a Spanish restaurant and do no serve them. After the server joked with us about my little craving, he helped us each decide on a good wine, only to surprise me by going back and having them MAKE me a sangaria. Our entrees were absolutely delicious. The whole night was perfect. Since then I have brought a few more groups to this place. Though service has not been replicated, I feel that experience is really hard to top. Every server I've had there has been attentive, and the food has always been worth the trip.

2011-01-18,3.0,"I really dislike waiting. In the South, I felt that I rarely had to wait on a Friday night at a restaurant - or maybe it's because I was eating at the same time as all of the old people. Apparently you should make reservations on Friday nights - all of the restaurants a friend and I wanted to eat at had extremely long waits - except for Rosebud. They could seat us once we got there (I called ahead 20 minutes before we wanted to show up). They give you  great olive oil and fresh bread while you decide. We decided to split the fish special that night - it was tasty and the portion size was definitely enough for two. Come here if you want to bring back meals for next week's lunch or share so you can try other things as well! The prices are reasonable for the portion size. While this won't be a go to place - if I think I can't wait another hour to eat on a weekend and didn't have the foresight to make reservations - I would come here again.",0.9432,0.871,0.113,0.016,0.3908163265306122

Just like Carmine's, Rosebud serves up consistently good Americanized Italian dishes.  I ordered the Cavatelli al Forno (ricotta dumplings in marinara sauce covered in cheese). I needed some protein to go with my giant portion of carbs so I substituted meat sauce for the marinara. The dumplings were fresh and delicious, the meat sauce was a bit spicy, but overall I was pleased with it. My friend liked his Vitello Marsala (veal cutlets in marsala wine sauce with mushrooms and side of pasta). He was not as impressed with his Caesar salad, which came with large pieces of lettuce (not chopped up) and was a bit too light on dressing. The reason I'm giving Rosebud fewer stars than Carmine's is that service here was spotty and the upstairs dining room was really small and cramped. Our server would come around too often when we were trying to decide what to order, and then disappear for long periods of time and then reappear when it was time to order dessert. We skipped dessert because we were both too full. The portions are huge and I had to take leftovers home.",0.956,0.846,0.117,0.037,0.6185714285714287

We were seated in the upstairs dining room in the corner window table looking down at the brisk business being realized by the fake purse vendors poaching the queue to get into Gino's.  Rosebud was, as usual, filled to capacity.  Our table server was definitely on top of his game, and he was attentive and responsive to our sense of timing. The house specials that day were a subline risotta (asparagus, baby shrimp, parmesan) and a fantastic pounded veal chop Milanese.  I forced a wine marriage with an Erath Pinot Noir (I have an unhealthy obsession with the Oregon Williamette Valley pinot noirs, but I am in a 12-step program to expand my wine appreciation horizons outside of this region so please be patient with me).  Some in my group of 6 dove into the cavatelli preparations and didn't come up for air until they were full to bursting.

The tenderloin sandwiches were very plain, something I would get at an average family restaurant. The carbonara was decent.

I went with calamari fritti, Italian wedding soup, and the caprese salad.  The soup was decent but too salty--C+.  I didn't finish that, but mostly because there was so much other food.  The portions here are more than generous.  The caprese was well balanced except for slightly too much onion, and of course at this time of year you can't get decent tomatoes around here; B+ on that.  The calamari was the star of the meal:  very lightly battered and fried, cooked perfectly, and served with a bland marinara and a tangy cocktail sauce.  Plus the portion was large.   The atmosphere was classy and sedate with good natural light, which was perfect for us on a Saturday afternoon when we wanted to enjoy some holiday cheer downtown but avoid the major crowds.  Also, I really liked our waiter, who was attentive, warm, and friendly without being obtrusive.",0.9947,0.753,0.216,0.031,0.5882301587301588

Rosebud starts you off with some fantastic, warm bread with olive oil and parmesan.  This was, honestly, the only part of the meal I felt was exceptional.  My minestrone soup was not impressive at all and the calamari and my eggplant salad were just okay.  For around $50 for lunch for two (after tax and tip) I didn't feel the food quality justified the prices though I do realize you're paying for the location. I will say that service is excellent, if perhaps a little overly attentive.  The restaurant was fairly empty on this day, but I swear no more than 5 minutes went past without someone dropping by the table to be sure everything was okay.  I'd rather restaurants err on the side of too much service rather than too little, though - so thumbs up for that.",0.3609,0.873,0.067,0.06,0.6547247438551786

Well not any of the homes I've lived in but it could've been the home of a rich relaton...of a friend's rich relation.  As soon as we were seated a basket of crunchy hot bread was put in front of us along with small dishes of olive oil. Good start! There was so much to pick from on the menu but I decided on the Pasta e Fagioli soup and as my entree the Chicken Livornese. The soup was mmm, super yummy. It was creamy and had pieces of pasta and beans...it definitely made my belly happy. Just when I thought my belly couldn't be happier they put the platter, yes platter, of Chicken Livornese in front of me. Holy moly this stuff was good. It was chicken in this tomato sauce with olives and capers and on a bed of creamy polenta!! If you've never been to Rosebud On Rush...go and try this dish. If you've been to Rosebud On Rush and never had this dish...try it!  Trust me...you will not be disappointed.

2007-12-12,2.0,"After my last visit they only deserve three stars.  Many people, like myself and unlike myself, go to restaurants to celebrate events. We chose Rosebud's to celebrate my grandmother's almost 90th birthday. After making the hostess aware of our celebration as we sat down, we hoped for something. A free meal? No. A dessert? Maybe. A candle in a dessert? Sure, why not.  The problem was that no one even acknowledged the birthday. Our personality-free waiter never said a thing to my grandmother about it, nor brought out anything with a candle. They didn't even try making it special for her and served her a bad piece of steak. Disappointing!  You know what? I'm taking off another star. It really pisses me off when nice Italian restaurants can't train their wait staff how to properly pronounce Italian words on the menu and they are no exception.

2007-11-22,2.0,"I love Italian food, so when a friend requested that I take her to Rosebud for her birthday I was a bit excited. I usually shy away from anything on Rush because of the over priced food, terrible club scene,  expensive parking, and tourists galore.  The dining room is located down stairs and is quite small. There is a big bar along one wall for which we were seated right next to. We were looking for privacy so this was a plus because we felt tucked away but the bus boys and wait staff frequently had to shimmy past us to get to the other tables. Not a huge deal but was a bit distracting. The service was quick but poor. We had a middle aged lady who I could tell just did not want to be there. She spoke very broken English and I could not understand the specials at all. I asked her to repeat some of what she had said and she acted like I asked her for $20.00. The only way I could give her a pass is if she was Italian, in an Italian restaurant, trying to speak English. Never the less she did recommending a nice bottle of wine and took our order correctly. The food is fantastic. We started with the fried calamari plate. I have had better, crispier calamari elsewhere but this wasn't bad. What was nice was that they knew we were sharing the appetizer so they took the liberty of splitting it up onto two plates. The entrees came out soon after, just like clockwork. My friend had the ""special"" cheese stuffed ravioli with vegetables and shrimp for which she loved. I too thought it was good but did not get to sample it until the next morning in leftover form. I chose the Veal Saltimbocca. This is my favorite of all time Italian plate. It consists of veal cutlets pounded thin with prosciutto and fresh sage, sauted, topped with mozzarella and served in tomato and white wine sauce with a side of pasta. They made it perfect. I'm going to give this Rush Street staple two stars because of the bland server. I know I eat late and I didn't even arrive until almost 9:00pm, but the whole time we felt rushed to eat and get going, After we finished our meals the server basically ""cut us off"" from ordering anything else by bringing over the bill. What was the rush on Rush St.? I understand she needs to get home and it was getting late but if given the chance I would have not only ordered another bottle of wine, but desert. Hello!!! Up sell and larger bill means a bigger tip! And yes, I am ignorant enough to tip on alcohol. Even as we were leaving they were still seating people. For a restaurant with a good reputation and great real estate they should have better service. My server might be more comfortable at an IHOP, or Navy Pier. Food was great, service was bad, they do have valet parking, and it is very pricey. I'm trying to find a reason to dine on Rush Street but this isn't it.

2007-11-10,3.0,"Wasn't really sure how this place would stack up to another popular Italian eatery, Quartino.  While the food was truly ever flowing and served on ""tubs"" as another yelper described, I thought RoR was only above average.  It's def a tourist attraction being so close to Mag Mile and it's constantly busy and good for groups, but I didn't come away really impressed. Of course there are always exceptions.  The stuffed mushrooms were probably the highlight of the night with the baked clams a close second.  My Bolognese risotto was almost watery - or maybe it just wasn't made for one person to eat.  I didn't finish it and I sourced it out to everyone at the table, but it was still a lot to handle.  Otherwise, I think the cheesy eggplant was decent, the chopped salad wasn't bad, and the veal was ok.  Restaurant gets props for service for readily splitting 2 dishes among 3 friends and constantly refilling my water glass.  Also, Godiva chocolate cake will always score some points with the ladies. Overall, it's not bad especially at the price point, but just don't go in with tremendous expectations.  Personally, I'd go to Quartino first.",0.9806,0.848,0.144,0.008,0.5525252525252525

One of my fiance's friends and his wife took us out tonight to celebrate our engagement- nice friends, huh? They made a reservation at Rosebud on Rush thinking it was some place new since I hadn't  reviewed it along with the other 800 businesses I've yelped about. And while new for my fiance I've actually been to Rosebud on Rush many times in the past and am shocked that I""m just getting around to reviewing it now... If you're a lover of Italian food and looking for some delicious pasta (& very large portions) Rosebud is for you. It's not the best Italian restaurant in the city (I personally think La Scarola wins that award), but they do Italian food well....and much better than their sister restaurant, Carmine's!  I'm a pasta lover, but always seem to be on a diet so I tend to order fish at Italian restaurants. However, Rosebud on Rush doesn't have many fish entrees to choose from. Well besides salmon that is, but  I'm taking a break from salmon right now after OD'ing on it...it's one of the only things I know how to cook! Anyway, I digress...so with no fish on the menu I was forced (and quite happily I might add) to choose a pasta. I remember reading in a recent weight watchers article that when ordering pasta the smart choice is linguine with clam sauce so that's what I went with being the good point counter that I am.  However,  I'm guessing WW doesn't want you to eat the entire entree! whoops... The pasta was very good (especially the clams on top), my fiance's cavatelli arrabbiatta was even better (although not weight watcher approved), the bread was warm, the baked clam appetizer was tasty, and the service was friendly and fast...so no complaints here.

For our main course, I ended up ordering the Linguine Fra Diavolo, comprised of strand pasta in a spicy, white-wine marinara sauce, and shrimp. It was extremely tasty. While my overall experience was quite favorable, there were a few nits that prevented me from giving Rosebud on Rush a full five stars. For example, while the service was relatively attentive (albeit a tad snobbish), for some reason we were never offered a copy of the wine list.

2007-04-24,3.0,"Rosebud for me is like the Gibson's of Chicago Italian restaurants.  It attracts tourists, is right on Rush and is always packed.  I will take Gibson's over Rosebud (or a good hunk of steak over pasta) any day but when an out-of-town guest suggested ""Italian somewhere near the Magnificent Mile"" I knew (after some helpful Yelper's recommendations) Rosebud would not disappoint. There are a lot of fish dishes on the menu which always makes it a little harder for me and my ""no sea creature"" policy. In the end, here I opt for pasta because there places I would rather get steak (see above).  Last Saturday I had a dish with shell pasta, olive oil, garlic, broccoli and snausage.  The snausage was crumbled - not fatty which made for a lighter more delightful dish.  The house salad I thought was OK - too much dressing. The service was a little TOO rushed for my liking and the wine we had was a bit suspect.  I didn't order it but it was Lindemann's, a brand or two above what we drank in college.
