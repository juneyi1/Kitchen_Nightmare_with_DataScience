2017-08-25,5.0,"What a gem! It's restaurants like this that make me truly appreciate living on the west side of Chicago.  The environment was perfect. With both a front and back patio and indoor seating, there was ample space for guests. A friend and I went on a Friday evening with no reservations around 7 and were sat immediately. We live in walking distance, but there is certainly parking nearby that's available too. We sat on the back patio that was so quaint and inviting that it felt like a tiny tucked away haven in the big city. The food was outstanding. They have a killer charcuterie platter that's probably meant to be shared by a family but was a hearty starter for two. If you're a prosciutto fan then please treat yourself and get one!  We also shared the gamboroni pasta which had the perfect kick of spice and flavor and incredibly fresh tasting shrimp.  Service was prompt, drinks were great, and I'm dying to try the bruschetta sampler. I'll definitely be back!",0.9942,0.678,0.286,0.036,0.4766483516483516

This place seems like a mom and pop shop all the way at the end of division. It's tiny, but can fit so many people, plus they have a patio. I've only been here twice and both times I ordered the same thing, risotto alla pescatora, seafood risotto. I don't really like clams or scallops so i substituted them for extra mussels and shrimp. THEEE BEST risotto I have ever had :D I also brought my boyfriends parents here to eat when they were in town and they also loved it! Reasonably priced for the portion, delicious selection.

We get to pick 5 kinds out of 10 different ones. The portions are cute and enough to try each one out. They were very tasty!  I got a pizza because I couldn't decide.

2017-02-15,2.0,"This review is for the valentines pre-fixe dinner and it must have been an off night so read if you wish. The food: The beef tender was a shame.  The slices were about 1 3/4"" in diameter, which i don't understand physically, and cooked to dryness through blackening on all sides including the face of the slices.  They did not ask how we wanted it cooked.  The bread was good. The ravioli was great.  The portions were tiny and I am being fair.  All 5 courses total probably filled me up as much as half a $12 cheeseburger.  The people next to us ordered more bread during the main course.   The wine portions were also very small.  2oz glasses.  My glass was empty for most of the meal.   The service (which is normally not a big thing for me): Everyone was required to sign off on a $55/person fee if the reservation was cancelled.  Fine its valentines day I get it.   So on the day of the dinner i get a confirmation email stating that its a $65 per person prefixe dinner. While i was checking the original email to confirm this was not part of the original contract they made me sign I got a call from a lady from the restaurant appologizing for springing this on everyone.  All was forgiven.  She was nice and the place was so highly recommended.   We get there and the hostess treated me like I was lying when I said I had a reservation, brushed us aside and asked the people behind us for their name, then muttered follow me without looking at us as she darted ahead of us to the back room.  We decided to follow, which was apparently correct. The service was cold and rushed throughout which would have been fine if there was enough food and wine. I tried to be assertive and asked for more wine at one point which was met with a grunt and a pointless splash of red.  I probably would have purchased a bottle if offered the choice. Over all I think they must have been flustered by the whole issue of forgetting to publish the prefixe thing and probably got yelled at a bunch and went into defense mode.  Id try again but would not recommend the pre-fixe nights as they were kind of sheisty about it in this specific instance.",0.7328,0.912,0.058,0.029,0.4932683982683982

The prices are reasonable and the wine selection wasn't that bad. I gave this 4 stars (instead of 3) because the risotto special was really delicious.

Now it was cold and windy, we should of just left and went somewhere else but we were excited to try the food. The one thing I appreciated was they had nice blankets on the chairs for people which helped since I was freezing. They did have outdoor heaters but they were small and you couldn't feel the heat... They should really invest in those nice large heat lamps other restaurants have. Their heaters look like a little light that didn't help at all.  As far as their food goes we ordered the calamari which tasted really good but their pasta was not up to par. I think this place is were you go to get drinks and appetizers. We would only come back for that reason but never to get a meal.  Hopefully next time if we can only sit outside they invested in better heat lamps!",0.9814,0.805,0.16,0.035,0.5116071428571429

2016-07-08,3.0,"The bruschetta & polenta were delicious. The lasagna and the gnocci were okay. Our server was pretty good, but what wasn't acceptable to me was the fact that my husband and I ordered another drink right before our entree came, and we didn't actually receive them until we were taking our last bit of dessert. The waiter stopped by our table multiple times, so I don't think it was his fault, and he said ""the bar was backed up"".  The restaurant wasn't exactly packed...why in the world would it take two entire courses to pour a glass of wine and make a cocktail?  Do you realize how much money you're losing out on being so slow at the bar? We probably would've had another round if it hadn't taken so long - You'd be better off doing BYOB!  Also - you advertise $5 wines by the glass on Thursday on your website. If you no longer honor that special, you should probably take that down.  Overall, I might go back for the polenta, but only if I didn't feel like having any drinks with dinner. We were celebrating an anniversary yesterday, and our experience last night wasn't the great date night we were hoping for.

As you walk through the restaurant it is small and standard until you reach a mythical backyard patio perfect for a quant meal and some wine sipping:) Service is very friendly and the menu offered plenty of options from appetizers, to pasta dishes, to pizza and main entrees. My girlfriend and I decided to try the aranchini app...special of the night along with the mushroom and sausage polenta and the gnocchi. Everything was absolutely delicious! Great flavor and hearty portions to where we couldn't even finish. I will say the polenta was a bit on the oily side, but nonetheless it was very tasty.

I tried the half order (4 square slices) of the Piero pizza which had mushrooms and sausage.  The crust was thin and crispy, but the flavor reminded me of those square frozen pizzas we used to eat from the elementary and high school cafeteria.  Hubby couldn't even finish his Orecchiette alle Vongole.  The clams were not fresh and there wasn't that much sauce compared to the pasta ratio.  Even the broccolini was sad.  We decided to cut our losses and skip dessert in favor of grabbing some cupcakes on our way home.",-0.9293,0.882,0.025,0.093,0.5573684210526315

Well a freaking hour later and still mo food like really? And that wasnt even the bad part about it. No one absolutely no one came to check on us in that whole hour of sitting there. Incredible.  Well our food finally comes to us with a half assed (and excuse my language) apology anout how there kitchen was so busy and they were behind because of some groups they had. Well sorry to say but if your kitchen gets backed up for two groups of people then maybe you shouldnt be offering the mangia mangia seeing as your kitchen cant handle itz  Needless to say i was happy to finally have food in front of me only to be dissappointed after taking the first bitez it was drenched in what tasted like canned tomato paste.... If i wanted to eat a can of tomato paste i would do that at home for far leas than what i paid here. My sisters pasta was extremely overcooked and dry.  It was not the experience i had hopes for. Could have beeb better if someone actually had checked up on us and told us what the delay was.

2016-05-19,5.0,"10 of us were in town for my brother's college graduation... I made a res here purely based on Yelp reviews, and the fact that the menu had some vegan options for 2 of our party. I have to be honest...when we were first shown to our table, I was disappointed. They led us through the cute wine bar and into the casual, takeout side of the restaurant with a bakery counter. We were literally seated next to a soft drink case. Clearly this was because we were a large party but still, I was a little embarrassed as this was supposed to be a celebratory graduation dinner. HOWEVER, that concern was short lived. Boy did this place exceed my expectations. The service was impeccable...our single waiter was on his A game the entire time, patient with persnickety ordering practices, and just pleasant and cordial all evening. Hats off to him. The drinks were very tasty. But the main draw...the food. You guys, the food. Every single thing that came out to us was absolutely mouthwateringly perfect. The appetizers (GET THE MUSSELS), all the pastas (ravioli, gnocchi, and the sleeper winner--that spicy pasta with eggplant, omg), and the meat and fish entrees were to die for. Our vegan dining companions cleaned their plates. Everyone raved and raved about the food. My dad, an Italian American and a tough crowd at Italian restaurants, told the waiter to give his compliments to the chef. Three minutes later a small woman in an apron appeared at our table to thank us and tell us all about her fresh pasta making process. It was honestly like a movie.

The two of us sat on the back patio, and the back patio was spacious and beautiful.  To drink, I opted for one of the white wines from their large wine menu. My boyfriend and I are both seafood lovers, so we often have to try out calamari at the different restaurants we visit. We had the calamari here, and the calamari was crispy and plentiful. Picking a main dish was difficult because I wanted to try almost every menu item. I had read somewhere that they make their own gnocchi and pasta, so I actually opted for the gnocchi. I ordered the Gnocchi Alla Erbe, which has braised pork in it. The gnocchi itself is outstanding, and the tender braised pork is the perfect addition. I highly recommend their gnocchi.  Only downside about our first visit was the service. We arrived around 7:30pm on a Friday night, and the restaurant was only at about half capacity. Our waiter was pretty attentive during the beginning  of our visit.  Around 8, almost every seat was filled and the service was a reflection of this change. After we got our meal, we didn't see our waiter for around 40 minutes. During some of that time, we were trying to get his attention, but he was pretty busy with other tables. I eventually got up and went inside to talk to another staff member about getting our check. Even though our service experience was not the best, the food itself would make me want to come back.

2016-05-12,5.0,"My brother and his wife made us a reservation here after hearing my husband and I wanted pizza for dinner. At first we were bummed not to be having Chicago-style pizza, but they guaranteed this place was worth it, and they were right!  The ambience is very warm and inviting, old school Italian here. There's only a handful of tables, which all back up to a large bar here - this created a nice, bustling feeling without being overfull or tight. Our waiter was attentive though definitely a bit off, not in a bad way though. He was very friendly and provided some fun entertainment for the evening with his jokes. All of the food was spot on.  We split an order of bruschetta (5 for $11), they're small but this is a great deal as you get to try many flavors. And one flavor was better than the next! We got the toscana - simple cannellini beans with white pepper but well-executed; cristina - the spicy jam made this, it was far more spicy than expected in the best way possible; roma - tomato, basil and garlic, very simple again but each flavor was highlighted perfectly; sicilia - (a strong) black olive pate and capers, very salty but I loved it. There was one more that I didn't try, but I can say no one tried one they didn't like!  We also had a full order of the Dragona pizza - it's a Roman-style square pizza. It's baked with tomatoes and olive oil, then taken out of the oven and topped with burrata and fresh basil. The dough was light and fluffy, almost like a focaccia bread. The burrata melted in your mouth and the tomato and basil tasted extremely fresh. We were both pleasantly surprised at how much we loved this pizza, as we usually go for a simpler thin crust. The last entree my husband and I split was the Giovanna pasta. This included spaghetti, eggplant, spicy marinara, burrata and fresh basil. This was a massive serving of pasta! I wished there was a bit more eggplant, as the pieces that were in there were perfectly sautéed and delicious. The spicy marinara had a nice kick to it, and the burrata added a creaminess without taking over the entire dish. My brother and his wife had another pasta dish and a salad, and both were very satisfied with their meals too. We finished with an affogato for them and a piece of chocolate fudge cake served with vanilla gelato for us. The cake was decadent and a massive slice! It was super fudgey and tasted delicious with the cool, creamy vanilla. One last thing I appreciated was the menu was well-marked for vegetarian and vegan options. Not necessarily needed but a nice touch. We'll be back next time we visit Chicago! From Yelp pictures, it looks like they have a beautiful outdoor seating area in summer, so I'd love to come back and try that out.",0.9992,0.739,0.242,0.019,0.5567135642135643

The wine list was extensive and excellent, and we were early enough to get a wonderful $5 glass of French rose. Yummm. We shared a huge meat tray. Of course the ravioli was fantastico, but the real winner was the ""pera,"" a pasta with pear, ricotta, walnuts and gorgonzola. Spectacular.",0.9493,0.761,0.239,0.0,0.5729166666666667
2016-04-27,5.0,"We decided on this place after careful assessment of many great options in the area. I kid you not. We walked by 10+ restaurants which all looked great. Bf and I were taking a stroll on a warm Sunday night. Started off in Noble Square, then Humboldt Park, and ended up in Ukrainian Village/West Town. I actually had a place in mind, but decided to switch as we walked by Enoteca Roma. I couldn't help but stare and partially drool at what the people were eating on the patio. It was a large spaghetti dish and looked so bomb. Once the aroma got to me, there was no way of passing. Btw, there's a back patio which is well lit and creates a comforting, laid-back ambiance; that's where we sat. We ordered the bruschetta combo, where you choose 5 out of 11 choices. They were all tasty. The mussels drenched in light tomato sauce were delicious. The base is more of a soup and I gladly slurped away using the shell as my spoon. The winner of the night, and the reason i was sold on the restaurant in the first place (remember that patio scene in the beginning?) was the Giovanna. It was full of flavor and heavy on the sauce. Two perfect combinations for Italian in my opinion. The sauce is mainly tomato base with eggplant, spicy marinara, basil, and burrata. The spaghetti was cooked al dente. It was so amazingly good. The plate was spotless as if we licked it clean. Portions are generous; price is slightly steep for Italian in my opinion but worth it. The glass of  sauvignon blanc paired well with all the dishes. The tiramisu tasted nothing like it, and more like chocolate cake since it was firm and chocolate-y, but doesnt matter. It tasted good b/c we scraped the plate clean. Service was outstanding. Warning: you're missing out on some terrific Italian food if you haven't tried Enoteca Roma. I can't wait to come back when warm weather becomes consistent so i can take advantage of their patio again.",0.9952,0.747,0.194,0.059,0.5207080200501254

However, when we were ordering, he didn't even mention the specials.  I happened to see it on a chalkboard as we were walking in, and had to ask him to confirm that it was true.   I opted for the special, which was wild boar ravioli with Pancetta.  The Pancetta was probably the saltiest thing I have eaten in my life.  The ravioli was very good.   My husband got the Cervo pasta, which had venison bolognese.  He said it was fine.  Nothing special.

2016-01-28,1.0,"No maam. No sir. I will not be returning to this place for any reason, ever.  Boss decided to take our whole team here for our New Year celebration dinner. There's a group of 10 of us. We arrive to find out we're seated at a very awkwardly small and uncomfortable table that we all had to squeeze into...okay fine, but strike one. The restaurant was extremely cold and the exposed thermostat sat right behind my coworker's head. Occasionally, a woman (staff member) from the restaurant would come back and ask us to adjust the temperature whether up or down (she first asked her to turn it up and then down again once it got too warm- fine, although tacky). So finally, I guess they're tired of asking us to control it and decide to just open the patio door (which is directly next to our table) to cool the restaurant down without asking us (THE TABLE SITTING DIRECTLY NEXT TO THE DOOR) if we mind or even if we wouldn't mind adjusting the thermostat once more. So finally I ask our waiter - which, I'll get to him in a second - why the door is open. He proceeds to say it's too warm in the restaurant when I mention the thermostat and that we can turn it down. I reach to touch it (as we had done already 2-3 times that night, per requested) and he, very rudely, said ""please do not touch that"" and walked away. Immediately my coworkers all displayed a very shocked look.  This is paired with the fact that our server, PATRICK O. was completely a douche. Was not personable at all. Any time there's a group that large, waiters usually take time to get to know what's being celebrated, offer some guidance on the menu, advise what's good for large group ordering... he did NONE of this. He acted annoyed and rushed as we all placed our orders (mind you, they were not that busy), and we had to pull info out of him about menu suggestions. And on top of all of that, the food wasn't even that great. I left and still went to get more food after because I was unsatisfied. And then my boss later told me that Patrick too k the liberty to circle one of the higher tip amounts on the bill. *sideeye*  Anyhoo, I won't be going back here and I would advise you not to either.",-0.6819,0.843,0.072,0.085,0.4698064774731442

2015-07-27,1.0,"First time yelper, long time lurker - had to sign up after this dining disaster on Friday... We had a 8pm reservation for two on the back patio. We were seated immediately upon our arrival at their AWESOME back patio (only good thing about the experience). The back patio makes you feel like you've left Chicago for the evening and are enjoying a quaint evening in a quiet backyard. I go to sit down and before taking a seat notice that my chair only had 3 legs on it. Nice catch by me before I probably sit and crash into the table. I go ahead and search around for a chair that has 4 legs and replace it myself.  The back patio is probably almost at capacity and I'm not sure if they are just understaffed or the servers are just not quite up to par with their performance but we easily wait 7-10 minutes before being greeted by our waiter. We put in two simple glasses of wine and don't see them for another 8-10 minutes.  Another couple sits down at the nearest table to us and they point out that their table is missing screws and moves all over the place.  We see bread at all the other tables so request for some - interesting to say the least once it arrives. It's a cup of plain olive oil and soft white bread.  We order the following: App: Arancini Del Giorno (stuffed risotto balls) - Was not very impressed with these, they honestly tasted flavorless and reminded me of eating falafel with pasta sauce.   Entree: Penne Arrabiata - This was by far the best food we had at dinner. It was definitely nothing amazing or something to come back for but it was cooked very well. When the entree came out, my girlfriend asked for a side of parmesan cheese and black pepper. You would think that might be a normal request and would have some readily available? 5 minutes go by and nothing, we wave down a busboy and ask him if he could assist - he tells us that he will tell the waiter. 5 minutes later we get parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper flakes? Whatever, we will make due with the crushed red pepper flakes before the food gets even more cold.  Entree: Gnocchi Alla Erbe - I wouldn't consider myself a ""serious foodie"" but have ate at a fair share of fine dining establishments... this entree was easily one of the absolute worst items I've ever had served to me. The gnocchi was wayyyy overcooked - the texture was pure slime and the consistency was mush. The braised pork sugo that was in the dish was also mushy with an extremely soggy consistency. Very very little flavor and honestly tasted like I was eating plain overcooked pasta. (Almost forgot, they brought out more of the stuffed risotto balls instead of the gnocchi initially - In my head I was like no way, but now I wish I would have just had those then experience the gnocchi) Wine: Each had a couple of glasses - red (cabernet) and white (don't remember). They were both very good and moderately priced.  Dessert: The menu looked pretty good and the items I saw coming out of the bakery appeared to back that up. I was already turned off from the experience and passed.  Side note: As we were wrapping up our dinner another couple sat down to our immediate left. They easily waited 12-15 minutes before being addressed by a server. We actually started to feel bad for them and were looking to get someone's attention for them. The waiter eventually comes by real quick and tells them that 1 min - they wait another 5-6 minutes before they are finally greeted.    Overall the patio in the back was fantastic (that was the main reason why we did try it after seeing it on Chicago's Best for best outdoor eating) I think if I were to ever come back here I would just order some drinks and relax in the back.

On my last trip, armed with a Gilt City voucher, I went with something completely different. As did the lady friend. We both got variations of dishes with venison bolognese. We were not disappointed. The lasagna and polenta with aforementioned venison bolognese are incredible. This is their shining star and will be my regular order (in some capacity) for the rest of my trips here. I would also recommend doing a bruschetta flight. Lots of fresh, tasty, and original ideas there. For dessert, try the to-die-for profitaroles. Not only are they scrumptious and full of homemade gelato, but you get three of them! They are huge! On the night in question, we got the hazelnut gelato (rotating every day), which made them taste exactly like Ferraro Rocher chocolates. Heaven.  Only real complaint is the tight proximity to other diners in cold weather when their beautiful patio is closed. The entire restaurant side was taken by a large party, so we sat in the adjoining bakery area. Comfortable and quaint, but not classy.  Could be the best Gilt City voucher investment I've ever made, and surely I will be returning when they open their amazing patio in the Summer.",0.9923,0.775,0.186,0.039,0.5614841948175281

We got 3 courses and a different wine pairing for each. Mussels were incredible.  My favorite out of everything. Calamari was crispy and had a rich marinara to dip in. My companion had gnocchi, which was really decadent. I had the spicy sausage pasta.  It could've been spicier, but it was still very good.

This pizza was AMAZING.  We mistakenly only ordered the half portion.  When my husband had to take a work call, I couldn't resist stealing his last remaining piece ;)! Our server suggested the special of the day which was a Paparadelle Funghi: Cremini mushrooms and garlic sausage with shaved Parmigiano cheese over fresh, handmade paparedelle.  OH GOOD GOOD.  Hands down, the best pasta dish I have ever had.  I don't even know how to put into words the freshness, the earthy goodness of the pasta.  It was everything I crave in a pasta dish: fresh pasta, simple and clean flavors that shined through, and hearty at the same time.  This one fulfilled each and every criteria.  I could have eaten the whole portion.  Sadly, we had chosen to do halfsies so we could both try two entrees. Our second entree was Risotto alle Erbe:  Spinach, butter and Parmigiano.This dish was very good too.  The risotto was creamy and flavors mild.  There wasn't anything that made the dish stand out, but it was definitely well executed.   Rarely, do we want dessert, but the options were too good to pass up.  We wanted the caramel cheesecake, which they had sadly run out of for the evening.  Since our server had suggested we order it, she felt bad that she didn't know it was no longer available, so, she bought out a complimentary tiramisu instead.  It was very sweet of her to do so, because we would have happily paid for the Plan B.  Thank goodness we were able to show our appreciation in her tip :). I loved our experience at Enoteca Roma from start to finish.  The personal attention, the 5 star customer service and the quality of food exceeded every expectation of our which is no easy feat!",0.9955,0.758,0.195,0.047,0.5859949670925281

2014-10-06,3.0,"Was looking for a place to get reservations in Wicker Park on a Saturday night. Not being familiar with the area and entertaining picky eaters, settled here due to availability and previous ratings. It's an interesting little place. We walked in (it was unseasonably cold that night) and the place was roasting - like make you sweat hot. We were seated next door in a place that looks like it's a bakery during the day. A little weird, but fine. Our server was just ok - a little quirky and not super helpful, but pleasant and answered our questions the best he could. He did serve a person in our group grapa as a substitute for not having a moscato wine on their list. Talk about night and day - grapa is like a hard alcohol! He did have the bartender make something else, but it certainly required more work and conversation than necessary. The food was good - solid. Hot food could'be been hotter, but it was good. The bruschetta appetizer flight was awesome. Something for everyone. My favorite is the olive tapenade. For entrees, the polpetta was really yummy - was supposed to be a giant meatball over creamy polenta with broccolini. Instead mine was two smaller meatballs. Either way, all of the component, including the marinara, were very good. Very garlicy, though. The pork gnocchi and chicken dishes were good, as well. The venison polenta lacked venison, but had nice flavor. Pizza had a very bread-y crust. It was ok - sauce good - but not what we were expecting. The knowledge and help of the server could've been a major plus in ordering, but he offered no suggestions unless we asked specific questions. All in all, it was solid and might return if I'm in the area. But, probably will look for something new to try. Just wasn't one of those ""I gotta get back here"" type of places.

Both dishes were EXTREMELY salty. I read a lot of previous reviews stating their meals were bland, well i would've preferred that.  My girlfriend and I had to ask for some balsamic vinegar to cut the saltiness of the two dishes. Our meals were so salty that our mouths started to get raw.

The only negative was the closeness to the condos next door which took away from the great vibes just a tad.  Starting off with drinks, there is a lengthy list of wine and beer that you can not find in every eatery in the city.  Ordered the calamari which was perfectly cooked and had a nice dipping marinara to compliment. My girlfriend ordered the Arancini which she loved as well. For our main course we had the carrot gnocchi and Penne Arrabiata which were both very good. The Arrabiata had house sausage which was very tasty and the sauce had a nice level of flavor and spice to it, but certainly not too spicy.  I would come back here in a heartbeat.

For my main dish I had the orecchiette con vongole - little ear shaped housemade pastas tossed with sweet clams and broccolini.  The pasta was delicious and the sauce was wonderful, sweet from the clam juice but with a spicy kick from some crushed red pepper.  My friends had the ravioli with pear ricotta in a walnut cream sauce and the daily pasta special, a fettuccine with speck and scallops. Overall the meal was absolutely delicious, although the service was definitely on the slower side.  Given we were enjoying the perfect summer night, the slower service wasn't a problem (I feel like traditional Italian meals are meant to be enjoyed slowly with people you love).  While we were waiting for the check, the owner stopped by for a chat, a thoroughly lovely little lady who obviously takes pride in her restaurant and the food they serve.

No one inside, and then no one in the front either. Then we saw the back patio and wow, really nice. Lights and decorations make it have a really good atmosphere. Especially once they add flowers. Be aware though, the sun went down and it got pretty cold pretty fast. May not be the case in the summer but bring a sweater just in case. They do provide blankets which is a nice touch. And now down to the food. First we started with the bruschetta appetizer. Our 5 choices, in order of my opinion of most to least favorite, were napoli, roma, proscutto cristina and piemonte. I'm looking at a not updated menu online, so the cristina here says raspberry but ours was strawberry, but anyway that was my 2nd to last favorite. Then for the main course, I ordered risotto alla pescatora (seafood place) and it was pretty good. A bunch of mussels and clams but only 2 scallops and 2 shrimps though. The rice thing it was over was pretty good. I didn't really like the mussels though since it seemed like there was no seasoning or flavor and it was just steamed. But hey, maybe that's how they intended it though. All that for about $17 so yeah. The gf got the Pera which is the pear ravioli and that was pretty good. Good flavor, though it was just 6 ravioli's for about $16 so money wise, that would not be a good filler dish. For dessert we had a trio of something that I can't remember the name of, but there were 3 small cups of it. One was caramel, the other was chocolate, and the last was berries. That was pretty good, just pretty small. But i mean this is more of a quality over quantity place. One thing that bugged me though is that there was only one waitress for the whole back patio and there was just a lot of waiting. Was probably there an extra 30-40 minutes that we needed to be which would have been fine if it didn't get so cold.",0.9959,0.77,0.183,0.047,0.6075360082304528

Service not good enough to make up for what I feel like is less than stellar food.   Firstly, this joint is small, so reservations definitely recommended. We ordered: - Gnocchi : these chubby little gnocchi were just meh; a little too dense for my personal preference.  I want that bad boy to be pillowy and have the texture of a cloud.   - Orecchiette Pasta with clams: Pasta was too thick, and amount of clams felt stingy. There were some really lovely pieces of roasted garlic in the dish, and I also liked the broccolini.   - Spaghetti with venison: Good, not great, nothing offensive or outstanding about the dish.  - Pasta of the day -- not memorable and average tasting. - Flight of 5 Bruschetta: Every single one was freakin' delicious. Easily top eat of the night. - Two different salads, the caprese & barbapapa with goat cheese, beets, nuts, and arugula.  I don't even like goat cheese, and I thought the barbapapa was pretty delish.  - Tiramisu: Nice, a denser, more cake-like tiarmisu.  I enjoyed it over all. Beverages: the rest of my party loved the wine list & really liked the recommendations our server made.

Second time my wife went with a friend and she had one of the worst experience she has ever had at a restaurant. Rude and not attentive. Wife left a 11% tip (way too much for the circumstance). The restaurant called me that evening (I had booked with my open table account) and asked about service and I had said how my wife would call back. My wife called back and talked to a MANAGER in which the manager basically tore into her and told her about how bad of a patron she was for leaving a bad tip. Food was good but will never go again.

We started with The Aracini of the day- This was a great start.  The aracini was perfectly cooked and we definitely enjoyed it and I would order it every time.  Next up was the Lasagna- it was piping hot and gooey served in a round crock.  It was good.  It wasn't the best Lasagna I have ever had, but we enjoyed it.   Lastly we had a 1/2 pizza- we chose the Dragona with Tomato, Olive Oil, Burrata and Basil.  This pizza is a little more bread-y than I like but the flavors were great and it was good to sop up some of the alcohol with so it this case it worked for us.   The bartenders and staff were all very personable and fun as was the clientele, it was a fun spot to hang out and I would definitely go back.",0.9979,0.71,0.275,0.015,0.514102564102564

Service was excellent.  We were the first to arrive and our waitress was attentive without being pushy.  She immediately took care of our drink order while we waited for our companions.  She was also helpful in making recommendations for the different options. For the appetizers, the table had ordered the calamari, mussels and some brushetta.  The mussels were my favorite by far.  The broth was amazing and I would drink it if I could.  The others were good, but just don't stand out as much.  For the second round, I had the seafood risotto which was delicious.   It was probably my favorite course of the night and had a generous portion of seafood.  The risotto itself was cooked perfectly with the right amount of bite which can be sometimes difficult to do.  For the main course, I had ordered the polenta.  This was the only dish I would not order again.  The polenta itself was good, but I had gone out on a limb trying the recommended wild boar for the meat.  I did not like it and it resulted in a trade for my husband's plate (venison polenta) which was much better.   We split dessert, but found we were pretty stuffed at the end.  We asked to make sure there were no nuts in the chocolate truffle cake, but something just seemed off.  I would skip dessert there.   Enoteca roma isn't the best Italian or the hottest place.  It is however a solid option on Division street.  I will be interested to see what their outdoor space is like come summer.",0.9968,0.727,0.221,0.051,0.6319764464925756

2014-02-03,4.0,"I do not like Restaurant Week, I will not bore you with the why, but I'll simply say that we planned our dinner double date around places convenient to all and away from the RW madness. Through a happy accident, we failed on one account. We were happy to scoop up a last minute reservation for four on a Friday. When i arrived, I was warmly greeted by our patient and friendly server. Emphasis on patient. We were long overdue for a dinner and spent way too much time catching up and ignoring the menu. Had our server not pointed out the one RW menu tucked in with all of the other menus at our table, it would have gone completely overlooked. Afterall, we chose Enoteca Roma because we thought it wasn't participating. We gave it obligatory scan, passed it around the table and all looked at each other. It was a pretty fantastic deal; the RW menu had a pretty sizeable cross section of their regular menu items and included many of the items we intended to order. In the end we all went for it. After a round of drinks, we also ordered a few bottles of wine for the table. We treated the appetizer course as a shared course getting two portions of the bruschetta (each person could select three varieties), an order of the mussels and an order of the calamari. Of the starters, the calamari was my least favorite; not because it wasn't good, but the other dishes were executed so well. The mussels were delectable and a standout. For the Primi course, I went with the seafood risotto, which was quite good. I received a nice portion with generous amounts of seafood. The table also got the penne arrabiata, venison bolognese and wild boar ravioli. The dishes received rave reviews from my dining compatriots. For the Secondi, I went against the grain and ordered the pan seared whitefish with spinach and potatoes while my friends each got the polenta. I rarely deviate from pasta when I get Italian, but I loved my fish, it was moist and tender. By the time dessert rolled around we were pretty full. The three of us who ordered the chocolate raspberry truffle cake barely made a dent in it. The caramel cheesecake though was devoured by my partner in crime. I would definitely make another trip back to Enoteca Roma, the experience was great. We were also pleasantly surprised at how good a deal the RW menu was; the quantity and quality of the food was outstanding.",0.9962,0.741,0.186,0.073,0.5214460143031572

Service-I had a wonderful server, he was very attentive, warm and welcoming. He knew the menu very well...and the moment I saw that pear ravioli, that was it for me. He also made great recommendations on the bruchetta i believe you get to choose 4 different kinds..and all of them were delicious. Food-Great presentation, but most importantly, that ravioli just melted in my mouth and exploded with so much flavour and i can just taste it right now lol *drool*.My husband ordered the housemade pasta with lamb ragu, and he was absolutely in love with his dish. The ratio of the sauce to pasta was perfect and the flavors were amazing, he also mentioned the pasta texture was perfect. The panna cotta was good, nothing too exciting relative to the main dishes, but still, good.  Price-I believe it was about $80 including tip..i think. Thats with appetizers, 2 amazing entrees, desserts, coffee, drinks. Highly recommend this.

2013-11-02,4.0,"We went here in mid-September 2013 with a large group of friends for a celebration of sorts. One couple was celebrating their 10 year anniversary while another friend completed her PhD degree at Yale. We were happy to finally get together for so many major accomplishments! We began with the Bruschetta, and ordered the following:  The Cristina with brie, spicy raspberry preserves which was a perfect amalgamation of salty and sweet. The Piemonte covered in French brie, green apples and honey was an unusual marriage of ingredients, but the tartness of the green apples amalgamated with the honey and brie cheese, worked perfectly together. We didn't want to fill up on the Bruschetta, so we opted to try two instead of five. They were delectable, incredibly fresh and made with excellent quality ingredients. Some of the main courses included: Gnocchi Alla Erbe made with organic herb gnocchi and sprinkled with braised pork sugo; Salsiccia E Funghi crimini mushrooms and house sausage with shaved parmigiano; Orecchiette Alle Vongole served with fresh baby clams, broccolini, chilli flake, white wine and roasted garlic; and the Parmigiana fried eggplant, layers of mozzarella, marinara, goat cheese, parmigiano, and fresh basil. The dishes were made with ""love"" and farm fresh ingredients. We could tell that the pasta was made-from-scratch. It was ethereal and delectable. Our experience was enjoyable. I rate the pasta five (5) stars and the service three (3) stars. Even though our server was attentive, and not overly smothering, the service itself was slower than a snail. Maybe this is the reason they strongly recommend the ""Flight of Bruschetta"" so that people don't notice how slow service is here. The vibe here is casual, relaxing, cozy and can be semi-romantic. This is a nice restaurant for any special celebration, first-date, date night with your spouse, or to have a few drinks (minus dinner).  However, I don't recommend it for children. Get a baby sitter instead and bring your spouse here. Make sure you experience this restaurant during the summer months and enjoy dining alfresco. You'll definitely feel like you are somewhere in Southern Italy!  If you are a non-smoker (like me) be sure to state you want to be away from any smokers. Yeah, they allow smoking on their outdoor dining area. That is a huge negative for us, but we will definitely come back another time.

We started with bruschetta flights, which you get to choose five that you like. The Napoli (the one I tried with mozzarella, tomato and pesto) is good, although I feel I've tasted better pesto sauce, and the flavor can be bolder.  Another antipasti we tried was fried polenta with sautéed tomato and cannellini beans. I'd like the polenta to be crispier, the way we had in Italy. But the polenta, almost tasting like cornbread, is pretty decent.  My favorite part of the dinner was the meatball with cream polenta and broccoli. I'm not meatball type of gal, but the dish really agrees with me. The meatball shines at the center, blending with the creamy polenta. The broccoli wasn't the star of the dish, but well prepared, juicy and tender. Oh, please make sure you get to sit in the backyard; it's just way too cute to be missed.

Visit 2- WOW, I will never return. I had a friend in from NYC and wanted to take her somewhere with a good outdoor area. We were seated outside luckily, and we started with a bottle of wine and a flight of bruschetta. Fine start to the night, but it went downhill. From the time we finished our meals (I don't recommend the gnocchi, by the way) until we saw our server again, 27 min had passed (probably longer than that; it was 27min from the moment I started timing it). Not ok! We had to ask the busboy for our bill, and even after that, we didn't get it for a bit! Our server was inattentive all night, made no recommendations, and seemed bothered by us being there. So what did we do? We left a sub par tip..... ......and the manager called us out!!! My husband made the reservation for us  through his Open Table account, so the restaurant had his contact info. They called him at 9:45 on a Sunday night to ask why we left less than a 10% tip! And get your facts right, Enoteca, because it wasn't that cheap of a tip. I am appalled that they had the nerve to call about this! I called back a few days later to speak to the manager about this, and she basically lectured me on how the service industry works- the servers have to split tips with the bartenders, busboys, barbacks, so our server ""basically paid to serve us that night"" as the manager told me.

This isn't a bar in wrigleyville!  They allow smoking on their patio. If you're not a smoker, this is gross. When I'm trying to eat my overpriced appetizer I  prefer not to be engulfed in smoke.

2013-04-21,4.0,"Food:  I absolutely love that this place offers flights of many things - bruschetta, arancini, wine, etc.  A great concept to let you taste the various gems on the menu.  We started with the bruschetta flight.  We got to pick 5 different types.  All were good but the stand out was the brie and spicy raspberry preserve.  I didn't know how they would incorporate spice but they did and it added an unexpected but pleasant flavor.  Next was polenta with mushrooms, gorgonzola, etc.  The fact that our waiter poured it on a slab of marble in front of us made the presentation extra special.  And of course it tasted phenomenal.  As for the entrees (yes we still had more room for food), I ordered the polpetta and the husband ordered the penne arrabiata.  I typically don't order off the pasta section at Italian restaurants but I am ever so glad I did at this place.  It was AMAZING.  The meatballs were moist and perfectly seasoned.  They went well on the bed of polenta (just can't get enough!) and marinara.  The broccolini was also very tasty.  Sadly for my husband, he was very disappointed in his dish.  He has rather high standards for Italian food but I tasted his dish and even agreed it was below par.  The sauce was lackluster and missing seasoning and the pasta just blah. Overall very sad.  Luckily I felt nice and shared a meatball with him.  Lastly for dessert we ordered the raspberry chocolate cake.  The fudge it in was good but the cake itself was dry.  I probably wouldn't order it again.       Drinks:  Moderate beer selection and extensive wine list.  Very reasonable priced bottles of nice quality.  Quite the variety to pick from for wine by the glass too.  We ordered a bottle of an Italian red blend.  It was delicious but what I really liked was that the bottle came out slightly chilled.  I started liking red wine chilled after having it on tap.  It makes a big difference.  Try it.  Service:  The service was spectacular.  Our waiter was friendly and attentive.  He also gave us great recommendations throughout our meal, from the wine selection to apps to entrees.  We also told him we wanted to take our time and draw out our meal.  Instead of being pushy like some servers, he was totally cool with it and didn't come back every 15 minutes to check on us. Ambience:  Laid back and casual but romantic if you want it to be.  You can come here for a date night or with a bigger group of friends.    Other:  The decor of this place was so cute.  The front seating area is quaint but the tables are roomy - not 6 inches apart like some places.  I was surprised to learn they had a back seating area which was much bigger but still had the softer lighting and quaint feeling.  An extreme bonus is that they have not one but TWO patios - front and back.  I can't wait to try these out in the warmer weather (thanks a lot winter april weather).          Overall, I was completely blown away by this place.  I am excited to go back as soon as I can.",0.9986,0.768,0.198,0.033,0.4981024531024531

2013-01-23,4.0,"Still good, but to be honest, the service is dropping off quite a bit.  They've hired a new hostess, who is always reading a book when I go in and barely will give you the time of day.  Plus, four times in a row this summer when I made reservations, I requested the back patio, and when I arrived there was no room.  The last time, the hostess blamed Open Table and told me to call the restaurant ahead of time with my request.  I told her I had--twice, once after making the reservation and once 15 minutes before arriving to confirm that the back patio would be available for my party.  The response was basically ""oh, sorry.""  If this had happened once or twice it would be forgivable, but four times in a row?  This last time was a special meal with friends from out of town and I had been praising the back patio (hence the confirmatory call shortly before we arrived) so this was extremely disappointing.  I told her this had happened repeatedly to me, but she did not offer any gesture of apology.  In hindsight, I should have informed the manager that this has been happening, because the managers at Enoteca are quite good at addressing concerns.  (More on that later.) Additionally, while it's great that they have delivery service,it's been slipping lately. with items repeatedly forgotten.   The last time I called and mentioned that this has become a frequently occurrence, and they sent some free desserts, so they did get some make-up points for that, and I appreciate an attempt to remedy the situation.  (Incidentally, the offer would not have come had someone else not overheard the situation, as I heard someone in the background instruct the person on the phone ""Offer her a free dessert."")  However, before offering the desserts, they blamed their delivery service, even though I'm fairly sure at least one of the errors (a missing sauce) was a result of restaurant staff missing it in packaging the meal.  I don't really see how missing a container of sauce could be the delivery agent's fault.  And even if it was, excuses are not my favorite thing. It's your restaurant, you hire your delivery service, and the buck stops with you. I also had some issues ordering from seamless from here.  Evidently seamless does (or did) not have the restaurant's correct hours.  They processed my order and charged my card, but needless to say, the food never arrived.  Thankfully, someone at the bakery, which was open, called me to tell me Enoteca was closed, and suggesting I call Enoteca back the next day to make sure I wasn't charged.  When I called Enoteca, however, the woman who answered the phone basically told me it was Seamless's fault, so I'd have to call them.  Again, excuses.  (Seem to be getting a lot of those.)  As a restaurant, if you hire seamless or another service to handle online ordering, it's your responsibility to make sure they have your correct hours and menu.  If they're not handling it properly, fire them and pick someone else; there are now ample online ordering engines you can choose to handle these matters.  Eventually I asked to speak with a manager, and to his credit, he handled the situation, made sure I got my credit, and called me later to follow-up.  It's great that the managers are able to address the situation, but ultimately the staff needs to be properly trained.  If I had not had the sense to ask for a manager, I would have been extremely put off by this experience. I think perhaps some recent staff turnover has this place slightly declining in my book, which is a shame, because it was my favorite place in the neighborhood and I've been a loyal patron for quite some time.  But this many flubs in recent months has to take it down a notch.  It still has a beautiful patio and excellent food, so I will keep it at 4 stars and give it a chance to improve.  But  if the service continues to decline (and frankly, does not start to get better), I may start saving Enoteca for my summer patio meals (if I get to eat there) and skipping the delivery, take out, and indoor dining.  The managers are great, but they really need to train the new staff to properly handle customer concerns.  And if the staff just aren't handling things adequately, just teach them 7 magic little words that can go a long way to a customer:  ""Let me get a manager for you.""",0.9933,0.807,0.121,0.072,0.4432361921492356
2013-01-22,5.0,"I have heard people say that it's hard to screw up Italian food, but I guess that's why I found most Italian places to be just standard...not bad, but nothing spectacular.

We had the A N T I PA S T I a la c a r t e - from the meats, we had Prosciutto di Parma, Speck....from the cheeses, we had Buffalo Mozzarella and Bianco Sottobosco (with black truffles).  They were all very delicious....I could have just made that my meal! Moving on to my pasta, which was the Giovanna penne pasta (with roasted eggplant, spicy marinara, baby mozzarella, fresh basil)...it was quite good as well.  I wasn't in the mood for a lot of meat that night, so I went for a vegetarian pasta.  Did not miss the meat/seafood at all.  It was very flavorful without it.  The best part was the mozzerella and the eggplant!  My husband had the Penne Arrabiata (with spicy marinara, roasted garlic, Enoteca sausage), and it was very good as well....so if you are looking for a more meatier option, I would go with that one. Although we were full, we could not pass up the dessert - panna cotta.  There were actually 3 little dishes of panna cotta on one plate - chocolate, caramel and berries.  I cannot say which was my favorite because they were all so yummy!  Chocolate and caramel were rich and decadent.  The berry one was more light and milky.

Notable Narrative: On multiple separate occasions, I have been overwhelmed by the spectacular service. One time, I could not decide between specials, so the waiter advised that I pick one and he would have the other cooked at our next visit.  I warily agreed, but, sure enough, when we returned (well over a month later), he remembered and had the kitchen make an off-menu item (which was a mind-blowing risotto) just to honor his word. On another visit, a friend noted his dish still had the wine that ought to have been cooked off and the garlic was a bit heavy.  The waiter noted this was one of their core dishes and anything less than perfection was unacceptable -- he took the dish off the bill, offered to cook a fresh one (which was perfect), and sent us home with muffins in apology.",0.9936,0.78,0.186,0.034,0.4958812260536398

The Short: Terrible Service and HAIR IN MY (overpriced and bland) FOOD. The Long: Dined on 05/29/12 After two years of eying Enoteca Roma, a girlfriend and I finally decided to give this place a try (due to one of Yelp's Top 10 places to dine in Chicago). Well our entire experience from start to finish was horrible and it got progressively worse.  We were seated in a very tight table btwn 2 girls and a family table of 5 . We asked to start off with some appetizers. And right after they arrived, she gave us the bill and told us to have a nice night. Two minutes later she came back, picked up the bill without explanation and laid it on the other table less than a foot away.  After that, she offered us bread (yes, after the appetizers) but still had yet to take our order. So I said I was wondering about the specials. She said ok and just stood there blankly until I said... ""What are they?"" And she said OH and hadn't realized that she never explained them. After she did explain them, she left our table to go back to the family of 5 who had already placed their order to explain to them the specials as well.  We ordered two entrees to share - the gnocchi and the mushroom polenta - both bland with undercooked sausage (didn't know that was possible.) And here's the best part... about half way through my meal I discovered every diners favorite find - a hair!

2012-04-08,5.0,"I rarely write reviews, but felt like the experience at Enoteca was worth taking 5 minutes this morning. Overall, everything was amazing. The setting is somewhat small, but in a nice, intimate way. Once it gets warmer I would love to go back and eat in the back patio or out front, but for now there are about 15 tables between the main room and the bakery side.  The server was really informative and not overly bearing at all. I really hate it when your server comes by every three minutes and interrupts conversations, etc. He did a great job of knowing when to stop by, take our orders, etc. He even came by just to top off our wine. Now - the food. As most people have mentioned, the Bruschetta is a must. You can pick 5 from a list of 10, and each one was delicious (the one with brie and raspberry preserves takes the cake). For the main course, I had one of the daily specials (Pork Shoulder over Polenta) and it was insanely good. My wife had the orecchiette pasta with shrimp. It was ridiculous how much flavor just permeated from the pasta itself. Neither of us spoke for 7 minutes, a sign that the food was damn good. We ended up taking home part of the pasta, and on day 2 it was still delicious. For dessert we had the cheesecake, and it was also great. With the bakery being right there, it's cool being able to pick something you know has been freshly made.  A few reviews mentioned the pricing being expensive, which I tend to disagree with. If you go to any other comparable Italian restaurants in the area (Via Carducci, for example) you would easily spend the same amount, if not more. If we hadn't gotten wine (their wine list is intimidating but great), the whole dinner would have been around $50-$60, which is a lot of happiness in your belly for a decent price.",0.9923,0.763,0.171,0.066,0.5031845238095237

My wife and I knew that we would have a great time at Enoteca Roma, but we were very interested in the critique of our friends.  Well, they raved about the place and said that the drinks, food, and entire experience were spectacular.  Our friends are already looking forward to a return visit to Enoteca Roma on their next trip to Chicago.",0.9862,0.831,0.162,0.007,0.5656324110671938
2011-10-04,4.0,"We were in search of a solid neighborhood Italian restaurant and found a few options but settled on Enoteca Roma. I'm glad we did because it is top notch good food with a great vibe and a solid menu. The back patio is quite large, even though there is also a front patio. Now that I think about it, there is probably more seating outside than inside - and that includes the connected Letizia's Bakery (same owner). I understand why they had blankets on all the seats for customer use as the weather turns. But the large backyard patio with small candles and blankets is the perfect setting for a neighborhood Italian spot. We kept the meal simple and classic. There are more than a few bruschetta options and you can mix and match (they even split them in half to share). We ordered a Vinny (gorgonzola, caramelized onions), Emilia (tomato, garlic, basil, prosciutto) and two Napoli (Tomato, Baby Mozzarella, Pesto). All were good and I really liked the Vinny. We also started with a salad to share since the description of the Rucola Classica sounded too good to pass up (arugula, cherry tomato, shaved parmigiano, lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil). I could have eaten more since it was a nice a refreshing salad and a perfect size to start but I'm glad we saved room for the pasta. We both were craving delicious home made Italian pasta and we came to the right place. Erica out-ordered me with the Cuervo (campanelle pasta, venison bolognese sauce). I loved the texture of the campanelle and the venison bolognese was great (I had to savor my few stolen bites). My dish (Arrabiata - penne pasta, roasted garlic, spicy marinara, enoteca sausage) was also very good and had a little more happening but all in a respectable package. The sauce wasn't overwhelming but had a nice spice flavor. I liked the sausage and can never have enough garlic. The portions were large and fairly priced in the mid the teens. One dish can be shared or just take home the extras. I'm really happy we decided to explore our local Italian options. We will be hard pressed to venture away from Enoteca since we know the food is great with plenty of options. It might not be a destination restaurant but I doubt the locals want it any other way.

Th beet salad was a winner too with its roasted beets, arugula, and goat cheese. I love the addition of truffle oil to the salad, which added an unexpected twist. If I had to choose between the two salads, the beet salad was the clear winner!  I tried out the pasta with the venison bologanese, and it was very delicious.

We got seated on a decent time and we got a good table outside.  The waiter started out really good and gave good recommendations. Everything we ordered tasted really good. We ordered 8 different kinds of bruschetta , spaghetti with shrimp , penne pasta with sausage and the polenta.  This  is where it all went downhill. This the first time we all had polenta and it was really good, better if we got good bread with it. The bread was bland to begin with and not warm but what the heck . It seems like it goes with the polenta. It seems like the waiter forgot about us once our food arrived. It took forever to get more bread and iced water. It was warm out so iced water would have been great. We must have asked about the damn bread and iced water 3 times or so. Finally the waiter said they ran out and baking more bread. So .... It finally came and our food is almost done and guess what? The bread was not even warm so where did they come from? Not the oven for sure.

And unlike last year, there were no peace offerings of bubbly while we waited. So I ordered a glass of that delicious rose, and the boy got a beer. The bartender was aloof at best. My boyfriend dubbed him a jerk because of the short, curt answers he kept giving to my comments and questions.  Our server was very nice, but covered in a layer of pretension. The whole meal was too fast paced for my liking, and the wine pours were odd. They served the white wines in a port glass, giving only a 2 oz pour at best, and did not have a champagne toast at the end of the night. There was no celebre-chef going around and topping off our glasses of bubbly at the stroke of midnight, and no atmosphere of merriment save for the large group next to us counting down.

The pizza was disappointingly bland and drowning in tomatoes.  The basil did not seem fresh, for while it was not in short suppy it gave off no aroma.  The mozzarela was similarly (and surprisingly) uninspiring.  This was a rectangular pizza (allegedly ""rustic roman style""), with a reasonably thick dough - not deep dish, but not part of the latest coal fired trend, either - a bit of an anomaly.  Unfortunately, the crust was bland, utterly lacking in flavor.  So, a big chunk of the menu menu is basically cut off for future visits. However, the venison bolognese was superb.  They did not skimp on the venison in the meat sauce, and it infused the pasta while a deliciously rich, gamey, smoky, complex flavor you won't find from merely beef or pork.  The portion was massive and will provide me with two more meals over the course of the week. Service was pleasant and relaxed.  They have an interesting cocktail mix going, excellent bourbon selections (Woodford!), and a good range of prices on the wine list.  I'll definitely come back to try the salumi and, when spring unfolds, outdoor seating, which is plentiful.  Worth a visit, but you should check the menu first to be sure you are open to pasta.",0.99,0.78,0.166,0.054,0.5256327756327758

I adore their simple pastas.  The gnocchi with sausage, mushrooms and peas is outstanding - creamy and rich without being a belly bomb.  I ate the entire bowl, because I am a total food Hoover.  I also really enjoyed their orrechiette with garlic - such a simple dish, with amazing flavor, and an example of how even a vegan dish can be transformed into something outstanding (no offense vegans, but I really love meat.)

Enoteca Roma is most well-known for their polenta, which is served plated on a marble slab.  The flavors are well mixed and its also a good dish to share.   Desserts are made in conjunction with Letizia's Natural Bakery.  The caramel cheesecake is very good, but very small given the price.  Their profiteroles and their panna cotta, however, are delicious and ENORMOUS, and should be shared!   Wine selection is well curated, and the bartenders will gladly educate you on what you're choosing.  You can also enjoy several wine flights, which is a fun and boozy way to try new wines without breaking the bank or dedicating yourself to finishing a glass of less-than-thrilling vino.  Mixed drinks are not bad either. It is small and can get very crowded.  I recommend sitting at the bar or outside on the patio (when seasonally available.  Though I love the soft blankets they give you when sitting outside - nice touch.)  The tables are crowded together on busy nights; one night I went with my boyfriend and we literally had to ask our ""neighbor"" to pick up and move their table over so we could squeeze in and out.  Not very romantic of a meal when 1) you're sitting close enough to hear your neighbor's nose whistle, and 2) every time you get up from your seat, you have to choose ""butt or crotch?""   Service is mostly good.  Bartenders are stunning - definitely another reason to sit at the bar.  The table servers are generally pretty good, though in full disclosure my boyfriend and I walked out of this restaurant once without eating.  We wanted to, but our waitress disappeared for over 25 minutes after taking our wine order.  We never got our wine or anything else for that matter.  One negative experience hasn't soured me on Enoteca however - this is definitely a gem of a place, and one I greatly enjoy.",0.9987,0.731,0.248,0.022,0.5779844424581269

My first visit I ordered a polenta dish which is served on a slab of marble--according to their menu, this is how this dish is traditionally served in Northern Italy. Who knew?

One person at our table had the Pollo Del Giorno: an enormous chicken dish with broccolini and potatoes and that was the best value for the price. $17 However, it was swimming in oil. I had Risotto of the day $16 : prosciutto, peas and cremini mushrooms with goat cheese. Usually you get a huge portion of risotto, enough to take half or more home. This was a one serving portion. While it was good, it was also unremarkable. There were plenty of mushrooms and peas but the prosciutto was scant and pretty flavorless and it was fatty which was disappointing. I know prosciutto is fatty, I guess maybe I shouldn't order dishes with it. I don't like fatty meat! Caprese salad $13.5 with prosciutto was a typically sized portion that I've seen as well as enjoyed elsewhere. It looked good and fresh. The friend who ordered this, finished it and then had a salami assortment because she was still hungry! The waitress said it was all organic because it was imported meat from Italy (huh?) Another person in our party had the ""Pera""  pear ravioli and she said it was good. It was in a heavy cream sauce with lots of gorgonzola on top. Looked sinful!  However, it also looked like there were only 5 ravioli in the dish. $16 I'm glad they didn't serve bread because it's my weakness. Nothing beats a nice crusty loaf of warm and rustic italian bread with olive oil and fresh parmesan but alas there was none. Few critiques, it was 90 degrees today. We sat outside on the patio which was nice and [/sarcasm/on] there seemed to be a breeze unless the trees were dancing for fun - ya never know! But you couldn't feel the breeze because of the giant market umbrellas holding in all that nice hot air [/sarcasm/off] There is a lion head fountain in the ladies room. WTF? Ok, bathroom ambiance isn't high on my list. I like and expect clean well stocked restrooms. This one was clean but out of toilet paper (pet peeve!) And the nifty fountain had a clump of steel wool wadded up in a coffee mug with about 1/2"" or so of slimy water in the bottom. Bad enough? No!! You could barely use the toilet because this fountain was so large and invaded one's personal space!! TMI perhaps but hey, this is a review! I might go back but I live near plenty of other Italian restaurants that I can go to as well. I wish there was a true Chicago ""Little Italy"" area! I really miss the North End!!!

The menu is unique and has lots of options.  We got their signature mussels, which had a good broth and a ton of huge but slightly stinky mussels.  Probably would've been a great dish had the mussels been fresher with less funk.   I got a polenta because it sounded weird and I never had anything like that before.  I guess I'd always had polenta fried or solid.  Definitely not a bad dish, but I wasn't thrilled with the baby food-like texture - probably not something I'd get again until all my teeth fall out.   The arribiata my wife got tasted like Spaghettios to me.  Seriously, they were pretty close to that flavor -  the sauce was quite ketchupy: too sweet and not enough depth.  Both dishes were saved by their spectacular sausage.  That sausage was about the best I'd had at any italian restaurant, it was so tender maybe they stuff it themselves or something.   Given the average pasta dish was $14-18, my polenta was $16 or so, and I saw entrees in the mid to high $20s, I think Enoteca is generally overpriced by about $2 to $4+ across the board.  Also paper napkins and no bread, not that either is a dealbreaker but when you jack the price of your entrees up there's a certain level of expectation there.",0.9643,0.754,0.155,0.092,0.5863208616780045

First off, this place is absolutely amazing during the warm months. I actually don't bother coming here much during the winter as the inside of the restaurant is quite small. But during the summer, the place expands tremendously as they have outdoor dining in the front and back of the restaurant. The eating area in the back of the restaurant is one of the best outdoor patios in the city. Very scenic and relaxing.  The menu is organized as a sharing menu. Lots of bruchettas, cheeses and meats to pick from and share. They have a nice selection of polentas, pastas and pizzas. I've tried a ton of things there and everything has absolutely wonderful. My favorites are the bruchetta (enzo, piedmonte) and pear ravioli.  The drink menu is quite nice. For beer fans, they have a pretty nice selection of Belgian style and craft beers. I'm not a wine expert, but the menu looks pretty expansive and I know the service there is quite knowledgeable about the list.  My biggest complaint (and its really my only complaint) about the place is that over the last few visits, the bruschetta, pizzas and pastas have gotten smaller and the prices have gotten higher. The prices are not horrible, but they're not good either.  The portions are average to below average on everything.

I'm so sad to be giving such a low rating to a great restaurant, but I just can't waste 3.5 hrs of my time to enjoy the polenta.",0.9484,0.739,0.173,0.088,0.4447663447663448

The caprese salad was very good and had a sun-dried tomato on it.   For an entree, I had the special risotto which had brocollini, goat cheese and procuitto.  The flavor of the dish was delightful, but a lot of the procuitto was tough and grissly.  My friend had the tilapia.  I'd go back to have the tilapia.  It was great.  Someone else had the polenta, which had a great presentation and was tasty.  My husband had the seafood risotto and thought it was just ok.   I was disappointed in the tiramisu.  Tiramisu is one of my favorite desserts, but the one here just fell short.  I didn't like the texture.   So, all in all, I didn't love Enoteca Roma, but maybe it was because we didn't go to dinner until after 10PM.  I'd give it another try if someone suggested it; but there are so many other great Chicago spots, I'm unlikely to go again on my own.",0.9928,0.71,0.22,0.071,0.6080867346938775

My boyfriend's first attempt at making risotto tasted much better if that tells you anything.  He had the polenta special. It was pretty extravagantly prepared!

Although, we were sat next to a large boisterous birthday party, our server did her best to accommodate us and provide some good insight to the wine light.

At first tastes, I wasn't very impressed...however, a few of the selections came alive when paired with food (must be the key here) and I ordered another glass of them with my entree.  Appetizers:  Bruschetta was fresh and delicious. I only wish there were more of them. It doesn't compare to the D-Lish bruschetta at Postino, in my home town of Phoenix, but hey....a solid effort. Organic salad was delicious as well- perfectly dressed and great presentation.  Entrees: The Arribiata was spicy and flavorful. I had the vegan pasta with it substituted for the sauce and was not disappointed. My partner in crime had the sausage and arribiata dish, which he claimed was excellent as well. Portion size was great...filling, but not gluttonous.  Dessert: Riesling was delicious, as was my Intelligentsia soy cappuccino. The barrista marked it with a heart- one of my favorite techniques.

The bed of spinach it is on is beyond words. The fish is so meaty and a ""way too much"" portion which I don't mind because I had leftovers for the next day.  Normally I hate any sort of cooked tomato -- but the baked cherry tomatoes in this dish just melt in your mouth.   I should mention that the sis and I split the caprese salad which is BY FAR the BEST i have ever had. First, I've never had it with sun-dried tomatoes -- AMAZING. Second, I have no f'ing clue where they get that buffalo mozzarella from but it melts on your tongue in an instant. It's so addictive in should be illegal. The wines -- holy shiz!!!! BEST wines/flights I have ever had.

ALL OF IT WAS DELICIOUS! Great flavors! We also ordered the special of the day polenteria.  The special included grilled eggplant, sausage, garlic, and shaved parmigiano. It was served on a slab of marble and prepared in front of us. The menu says the polenta is served hot, but when we tasted it, it was more luke warm. Maybe the marble slab cooled it down? It didnt really matter though because all the ingredients combined tasted really good. The texture was similar to grits but very smooth. I'm normally not a fan of grits but this polenta was great!

I thought, and ventured inside, because I thought maybe that's where you wait to be seated. As I went inside, I stood by the hostess table, where the hostess walked by me a couple times, making eye contact with me but not saying anything. The 3rd time around she asked if she could help me, then I told her I was just waiting for a table. She said ""Okay"" then proceeded to ignore me for the next 10 minutes, give a group of 5 a table (they were waiting there before me, I understood that...) but then gave a table to the couple that got in after me to which I was so furious with the place that I walked out. What a rude place. It wasn't like I was dressed as a bum or had 5 sets of eyes. I've never had this type of treatment. This place is awful for the service alone and I will never set foot there again.

This is one of those places that is fun and cozy, rather than fancy, and has a menu that is interesting, obviously crafted by people who really want you to have a good time dining. The service was slightly overeager -- with several different servers checking in on us multiple times -- but honestly I just got the feeling that they really, really wanted to be sure we were happy. I'll take that over abrupt or absent servers any day. We each tried a wine flight, which I think is always fun. They had several flights available; I think the four of us each chose a different red flight. Then we sampled some bruschetta -- they have several very interesting options -- it was excellent. We all had one of their polenta dishes; they were great. Excellent food, excellent wine, a good and moderately priced beer list -- rather than dessert, we moved on to that.

The quaint atmosphere immediately takes you in, wraps you in a chenille blanket, and allows you to relax with a great meal. My sister and I have weekly dinners and this was my pick, for some reason I had a craving for pasta but entirely ended up ordering the ""Maialino,"" a pork dish braised in wine served over a bed of polenta. I highly recommend this dish, the pork was tender and flavored to perfection. My sister opted for the lasagna dish and about died right in front of me with the crusted-over-cheese topped creation.  The service here was wonderful, thoughtful and attentive since it was our first time dining here. Our waitress was very educated and helped to answer about a thousand of our questions (we were rather indecisive that night). I'm actually considering having my next birthday get together here, it's very much my scene and a guaranteed good time all around!

2009-09-05,3.0,"Went here on a Thursday night and sat on the patio in the front. It's a really cute place and at the end of the Division strip.  When I first arrived, my friends were already there and well into their 2nd pizza and 3rd or 4th glasses of wine. Since everyone was drinking wine and the only thing I had the chance to read before the waiter bombarded me was the different wine flights - I assumed that they specialized in wine since they had a very extensive list. So, when the waiter asked me what I wanted to drink, I asked him what he recommended. The next thing that came out of his mouth was, ""Do you want some beer? We have a great beer list!"" Considering what I already assumed, I thought he was joking and confused on how I should react! (He actually wasn't joking - they do have an extensive beer list as well as I found out after ordering a glass of wine and having a chance to read the menu.) Not only did the server catch me off-guard, he was also kind of rude. His attitude was I really don't want to be here and hurry up and tell me what you want. Wow dude.. I'm sure there are plenty of people who will take your job if you don't want to be there.  Ok.. let's move on to the food. The piece of pizza I did have was decent. The crust was thick, chewy, and crispy at the same time. I thought it was nicely done. The pizza that was ordered was the Totti pizza; it was very basic and should have clean flavors but my only complaint is that there were way too many tomatoes! A balance of ingredients would have been much better. I also ordered the Boscaiola which is the whole wheat gnocchi with mushrooms and spicy italian sausage which made up for the pizza. I normally don't order gnocchi because it's heavy, but I thought I would take a chance and am glad that I did! I shared it with my fellow patrons and everyone seemed to have enjoyed it.  The bakery next door is also part of the restaurant. So, you can pick up muffins for the next morning if you wanted to. The 2 establishments share bathrooms that separate the 2 spaces. This brings me to another interesting experience I had at Enoteca Roma. Yes, I think someone mentioned in another review that the bathroom was pretty, and it is. However, I don't understand why anyone would put a fountain that's sticking out right in front of the toliet. Aren't they afraid that someone might hurt themselves by hitting their head on the fountain and sue them???  I think I will have to go back and give it another shot. I think there are several items on the menu that looks interesting such as the cheese and meat plates as well as the variety of bruschettas they offer. 3 1/2 stars is my rating of this place...",0.9929,0.846,0.132,0.022,0.5080402236652235

2009-06-21,4.0,"Inoteca Roma is hard to decipher. On the one hand, the food is pretty much amazing. On the other, it's so incredibly overpriced that it's hard to overlook that glaring issue. On our recent visit my partner and had: Bruschetta, which is served in a sort of flight format, you choose four to try; Pera Ravioli; and Polenta. We finished our meal with a trio of Panna Cotta. The Bruschetta we had were absolutely delicious. Which they should be, at $11 for 4 slices of bread with toppings. Our choices were one with mozzerella, pesto, and tomato; roasted eggplant, hazelnuts, and goat cheese; pear, honey, and parmesan; and strawberries, mascarpone, and balsamic vinegar. Again, amazing. Again, pricey. This was followed by our entrees. She had the Pera Ravioli, which is a pear ravioli in a gorgonzola sauce. This was absolutely phenomenal, and we really wanted more. Unfortunately, she'd ordered the tapas portion, which was $12 and included 4 pieces of pasta. I had polenta for my meal, which was topped with tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, and gorgonzola cheese. Unfortunately, at $16, this was both the least exciting part of our meal and the most expensive. Considering that the ingredients probably cost less that $3, I was a little upset by this. The tomatoes were roasted, not fresh, which the menu didn't specify, and I felt that the cooked veggies with polenta and cheese led to a meal with very little texture. Admittedly, polenta is a peasant food, but great things can be done with it. They just weren't in the case. Finally, we shared a trio of mini Panna Cotta because she was in the mood for something chocolatey and I for something fruity. Conveniently, they were offering this combo which included chocolate, caramel, and mixed berry flavors. They were all fresh and delicious and were a perfect end to our evening. On the whole, the food at Enoteca Roma is very good, but extremely overpriced. This is a problem not only because a small serving costs a fortune, but because if you're dining on a vaguely reasonable budget you have to keep to certain sections of the menu. Hopefully, I'll either strike it rich or they'll notice how the price point is effecting their patronage and bring their prices down.",0.9843,0.843,0.109,0.048,0.6490626340626341

I was there in the spring for a birthday dinner. There were about eight of us in the group. We were seated outside. It took us awhile to get drinks order in because the waiter dropped off the menu and didn't come back for about 20 minutes.

For the main dish, my husband ordered Cervo and I ordered Maialino. For not being a fan of venison, their Venison bolognese sauce changed my mind about not liking venison. It was tender and perfect with the campanelle pasta as it catches all the sauce in its nooks. I loved my dish as well. It was a piece of perfectly braised pork shoulder. It fell apart just right when I picked at it with my fork and the polenta that it was served with was moist. Others had Boscaiola, Risotto of the Day (it was shrimp the day we went), and Risotto alla Pescatora. They were all very good and I would definitely go back to try their other dishes, especially the Pear Ravioli... Now, onto dessert... their Tiramisu was phenomenal as well as the Perfiteroles.

Enoteca Roma is a great place to go for conversation, maybe a casual romantic dinner, a nice meal and WINE WINE WINE: decently priced, yummy yummy WINE.   To start, my friends and I had the bruschetta; it was tiny but well flavored; my sicilia bruschetta had a finely ground tapenade. Though the amount was tiny, I tasted garlic, olives, capers, currants and salt in each savory bite. Not sure if all those flavors were in there for real, but it seemed as though they were at the time. Next came my wine flight. We were four girls defying stereotypes and each of us ordered a different red wine flight; I had the ""Flight to the Americas"" which featured a dry, tannic Uruguayan Tannat (wtf: Uruguay grows wine?). It reminded me of a crappy tempranillo I had not too long ago and I would have been happy to not have tasted it again. Then came a Chilean zinfandel, which was spicy and enjoyable, and finally, my favorite, the malbec, which was extremely fruity and rounded in its flava-flavs. I then ordered a glass of it and got a little crunk. I was disappointed that the menu advertised that they would make items not listed on the menu, then turned down my request to have the Cestino made without prosciutto (I don't eat meat.)  But I had the polenta del contendino instead which was pretty tasty--marked-up peasant food--but tasty. The one thing that bothered me was that one of our servers acted like polenta is some miracle of God and somehow difficult to make. For realz, I can make polenta at home and it only costs $1.39 a pound in bulk. All it takes is some cream, parmesan, chicken or vegetable stock, and you've got yourself some fine tasting fancified grits.  However, I don't always feel like making myself polenta, and Enoteca Roma delivers when it comes to presentation. The hot-off-the-stove corn meal was served from a rustic pot and poured onto a marble slab. A sautee of mushrooms, tomatoes and onions, which had been well soaked in wine and garlic, was spread on top, followed by some cheese. Wow, that was long, and written mostly on the evening I went there, so I was a little boozed up at the time.

The wine flights are a great way to try out a few options without breaking your wallet.  Overall I thoroughly enjoy this place, and I frequent it often.

We got the chef's special (sundried tomato with shaved parma), the Emilia (tomato, basil, garlic, prosecuttio), the Enzo (strawberries, marscapone, basalmic reduction -- FANTASTIC!), and the Napoli (mozzarella, tomato, pesto). It was a nice spread for $11. We also ordered a cheese flight, which was served with 3 large slices of bread, granny smith apples, a spicy, berry jam and 3 types of cheese. The jam was pretty amazing, and it really complemented the cheese. So then we ordered the gnocchi, the cervo (venison bolegnese sauce and campanelle pasta) and the cestino (baked spaghetti). All were absolutley terrific and were even better as leftovers the next day. I can't go on enough about how delicious the pasta was. All 3 were superb, which was great after having a rather disappointing experience at Pizza DOC up on Lawrence the day before. We finished with too strong coffee and the tiramisu and chocolate raspberry cake. The dessert was pretty good, but not the best I've had. Might have been a better choice to go with the panacotta instead. Now for the service. We had reservations at 7:30, but didn't get seated until 8 because our table was occupied by lingerers. It's a pretty small place. The did give us complimentary glasses of prosecco as an aplogy, which was very nice.  The only other complaint is that our waitress wasn't always available to help us when we needed her ...

Courtney and the other staff members are especially knowledgeable, and did a fantastic job of talking us through the three-hour marathon of food and drink.  Extra kudos to the owner and head chef, Fabio, who, in spite of the busy night, made an effort to greet us personally. What an enjoyable and delicious experience -- I recommend it to all!",0.983,0.821,0.147,0.031,0.5412992357436801
2008-07-27,5.0,"I am always on the look out for relaxed Italian places where I can have a glass of wine and pick at a small pasta dish while reading a book.  Anyone who's lived in North Beach in SF knows what I'm talking about. I've been to plenty of places in Chicago and around the country with terrific food that take me back to the culinary delights of country Italian dining, but with stuffy gastrofascist 'I'm turning this table as quickly as possible' attitudes from the staff, and a pushiness from customers that don't quite match my interest.  As far as I'm concerned, nothing ruins my appetite faster than restaurant staff who look at you like a piece of meat and a fixed 15% tip to get fed and out the door as quickly as possible.  If I'm paying good money, I want to sit back and enjoy it. Smokers may identify this as the difference between a hurried puff on a cigarette on the sidewalk while running late for an appointment and a long drawn-out cigar enjoyed with a glass of port and newspaper in a comfortable chair overlooking an oceanside sunset.  If I'm getting cancer from it, well the short-term enjoyment must be worth it. Whether you're looking to spend $10 or $200 for your dinner, Enoteca Roma is Chicago's ultimate lay-back-and-enjoy-yourself Italian culinary orgy.  The food is less metropolitan -- the name alludes more to the attitudes of the high Empire (think Emperor Tiberius at Capri) than to the capitol city of today (although I understand the family who owns and runs the joint are Roman natives).  Shy of opening a massage parlor upstairs for a pre-dinner steam bath and rub-down, I can't think of a way they could create a more satisfying dining experience. Try the pastas, try the antipasti, TRY THE POLENTA!! Try some wine: kick back on the patio and enjoy the sunset with food that could only pique more senses if it spoke. Also: there was an enormous group on the patio when I went here -- I know for sure the next time I'm trying to figure out what to do with 20 of my best friends for a festive dinner I'm going to drag them here. I may try to talk my fiancee into doing a rehearsal dinner or family reception here.",0.9959,0.797,0.171,0.032,0.4531456456456456
2008-07-26,1.0,"Wow, such a sob story. ""We're busy tonight"" is no excuse for poor service. The good: The bartender was quite good for being alone and covering the bar requests and table requests. One waitress was an absolute workhorse running around inside and out. Finally the hostess was an angel that seemed to get the worst from everyone one, and sadly I am included in that. Lastly, the wine is great, the pours hearty and the wine flights delicious. The bad: When you walk up and someone is B@tching out the hostess and it turns out to be the chef/probably the owner, it should have been an idea of what is to come. When we were seated it took our waiter (tall skinny guy with glasses) awhile to saunter over. He didn't even want to give us the specials at first, but decided to grace us with them in the end. He took our orders and then disappeared. Came out fifteen minutes later to ask if I got my wine flight, only problem is that he was the one that would bring the flight out. He asked what the flight was, again, and then went back in.  Twenty minutes goes by and no food comes out. By food I mean sliced meats and mussels (three minutes to cook mussels). We ask the waiter the eta on the food and I get ""we are very busy tonight."" Wrong answer. I ask for the check on the wine. After another ten minutes the chef/probably owner comes with the food. We say we asked for the check and do not want it. He says that it is on the house, "" no  thanks."" He replies "" so you are just going to let me throw it out?"" Yep. And once again we get the ""it's very busy tonight.""  Guess what? Don't have so many tables on a Saturday night if you can't handle it. It's restaurant 101. This is the first time in thirty years and many meals all over the world that I have a) walk out on a meal, and b) left a waiter $0.00 for a tip.

So, we agreed to the other table. 5 minutes later, two people were given the table we had asked for. Never mind the 5 top coming in.... Then it took our server 25 minutes to come to the table. The eggplant parmigiana that my mom ordered was extremely salty...inedible. My gnocchi was great (I've had it a few times prior). Over all this was the worst experience I have had here.

They have several different kinds of bruchetta (both traditional types and unique) and you can choose up to 4 types for your appetizer plate. For the main course, we chose an italian sausage and mushroom pizza. It was very tasty. Great food, great atmosphere. So, why am I giving it only 2 stars? HORRIBLE service! We arrived at 9pm and waited at the host stand for over 10 minutes before I flagged down a waitress who told us to wait at the bar. The bartender seemed annoyed to take our order. However, we were happy to learn that our table was ready very quickly.  Next came the waitress---extremely slow and irritated with our questions about the wine list (wait, isn't this a wine bar?) and food specials of the night. We waited nearly 45 minutes before our salad and bruchetta came out. When my boyfriend asked what the delay was, the waitress responded by telling him that, ""bruchetta cannot be served without the salad and the bruchetta takes awhile to make."" 5 mintues later our pizza came out,  which was what we were hoping to avoid.  Now our table was crammed and we were urked that everything arrived at once. We had to stalk down our waitress for drink refills and fresh plates. Another table behind us got up and left before their food even arrived as they said they had been waiting for over an hour. After my boyfriend complained to the owner, Letizia, she said she was very sorry and offered free dessert and coffee. She also said that  they were short staffed because of July 4th weekend and there wasn't much they could do about it. Our waitress was Julie.

Maybe someone should have told me.   Complaint #2 - I felt like a piece of roadkill being circled by the busboy, a.k.a. ""the vulture"".  I set my wine glass down with half a sip left and he ran over and whisked it away.  My SO was sitting with his back to the bar and this busboy would walk up behind him, within 6 inches of his back (facing me the entire time) and look over his shoulder to see if there was some sort of item he could rapidly remove from the table.  If you can't picture it, trust me when I say it was strange.  He took my plate and fork before I finished eating what was on it and THEN asked if I was ""still working"".  Well, I was but you've taken my plate, silverware and glass.  I guess I'll pretend I'm finished so you have something to do?  By the time I finished chewing my last bite of food, the table was completely cleared and he was still staring at the table.  I could only assume he was hoping to find one last crumb to pick up but was failing miserably in his search.   Everyone else talks about how european this place feels.  I don't know about them but when I'm in europe I do as the europeans do.  I take it easy.  Leisurely meals in a relaxed environment are par for the course.  I felt like I needed to shovel food into my mouth as quickly as possible before ""the vulture"" returned.   Nothing was relaxing, I felt very rushed and by dessert we were both tired of having the busboys arm in the middle of our conversation, so we decided to have coffee and dessert at home.  Such a shame, because I really wanted to try the tiramisu with an espresso.   Honestly, this could have been a great meal.  The wine was fab and the food had great flavor.  I loved the tables opposite the bar where we sat.  The music was an interesting mix, fun to listen to, not too loud for normal conversation.",0.9923,0.739,0.166,0.096,0.5257438530967943

Choose 3 or 4 different types of bruschetta and they bring you a huge platter with samples of each.  Everything from tomato & mozzarella to brie with apples.  Their cheese plate is incredible too, and the salads, while simple, are very fresh.  They don't have a massive selection of entrees but the pasta is always very good. Go here if you want a light meal and some fantastic wine.   The staff is friendly and cute, the atmosphere is cozy, and the outdoor seating is beautiful.  When the weather turns cold they extend the patio's life by offering blankets to patrons who want to sit outside.",0.9838,0.749,0.251,0.0,0.7391428571428572

I love sitting outside in their back patio area during the summer. On a recent visit we all tried different flights of wine with one of us trying the wonderful sparkling flight - great for summer. The pizza was plenty for four of us to snack on and the pesto and mozzarella were rich with flavor. I'm going one star down from 5 because of the not-generous-enough pours on the flights.

Now thinking about it...what had I eaten even?  I had had wine, and my only comments are...they have a great wine list, it can be a bit pricey, but it seems to me that they have added some more affordable bottles recently. The food...Is awesome!  My husband and I have gone 2 weeks in a row..and there are still a bunch of things we want to try.  It's a huge menu.

The lighting was bright and it was very loud. This made it somewhat difficult to carry on a conversation. They have a cool outside area and if you visit during the summertime, you should sit there because the interior is tiny. The crowd was eclectic. And by that I mean there were a few goths, some indie people, a young couple sitting at the bar, and a table of older patrons. I was impressed with the bruchetta appetizer and my lemon pasta entree.

With all the pastas you have the option of ordering a large or a small, and the small will do you quite well. The wine list is a bit on the pricey side for a neighborhood joint--many of them are in the 30-40 dollar range. The bruchetta assortment is also a great idea. The interior of the restaurant is very small, so you are best to go early and get a space on the back patio. This is a nice place to have a party, I had a friend's bachelorette party here last year on the patio. It was rather cool (in early June) but they set up heat lamps, and along with those the attention of a very handsome waiter kept us toasty!",0.9562,0.836,0.154,0.01,0.45720634920634917

The food is not bad, I prefer the sandwiches, and the soups seem pretty good, also being part of Letizia's soup selection, and it's a nice cozy place to hang out. It's definitely worth a try. Not bad, although it is cramped, but you will get used to it, especially if it happens to be less crowded than I can remember during my last visit, and it is too similar to Letizia's, also sharing a front patio, and the option of a rear one also.

2006-11-05,5.0,"This is my favorite neighborhood restaurant. It's a tiny smoke-free wine bar and the food is incredible. This place is very vegetarian-friendly, they have veg options on the menu and you can often take the meat out of the dishes that aren't veg already. I have never asked them to make anything vegan though, so I'm not sure how they are on that front. Things that are ridiculously delicious: -the bruschetta (definitely vegan options here) -the cheese selection -the pizza -the gnocci and the gorgonzola/pear ravioli -the salads Yeah um that would be pretty much everything they offer. This place is better for the summer because most of their seating is outdoor, they only have a few tables inside. But it isn't super popular so as long as you aren't going at 8 on friday night you should be fine getting a table in the winter. The only con is that the wine is somewhat pricey, but it's because they have a more edited selection (after all it is a wine bar).",0.5184,0.894,0.066,0.041,0.6502923976608187
2006-10-12,4.0,"The ambiance inside is average, but in line with what I perceive as the philosophy of  the restaurants' owners.  It's very low key.  The service was very good.  The food was excellent.  This place is not going out of business anytime soon.  The food is too good for that to happen.  The absolute best Gnocchi I've ever had and the pizza was excellent too.   I would give this place the five star rating, but it's pricey for the experience.  The food feels like Rome and so does the price.  Only in Italy can you buy a sandwich for $15 that consists of two pieces of bread, a piece of salami and a piece of cheese.  I see this restaurant is keeping with that tradition in food and wine.    We spent $185 (before tip for 4 people), I felt it was over priced and lacked the ambiance that would command $45-50 a person in Chicago.  I realize this isn't fair and maybe I'm being a cheap bastard because I'm basically saying drop your prices or better yet, don't mark up your wine 200-300%.  I can't prove this, but for God's sake, it's not perishable.  The world is not running out of wine?  I never understood why customers have to get hammered like this on the wine.  In some ways I think it's a little unappreciative and disrespectful towards your customers, but let's face it, what you don't know won't necessarily hurt you.  If they can disprove me on this issue, I would happily remove it from my review. For the record, their bottles are priced from $28-85, but their selection is small, so most bottles are between the $35-50 range.   They're lucky that I really enjoyed the meal and especially the wine experience.     Definitely, check this place out.  It's real good, just don't go crazy on the wine, if price is an issue.  Additionally, we were thanked when we left the restaurant.  They're very friendly.  I wish there were more restaurants with this level of quality and taste, like the Tasting Room on Randolph for example.",0.997,0.769,0.198,0.033,0.6769047619047617
