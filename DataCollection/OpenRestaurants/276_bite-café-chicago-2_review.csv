2017-08-11,4.0,"Fun hipster environment, and is BYOB so you can't go wrong with that. Pretty small restaurant seating about 20 tables. Really nice waitress and chef (met him to speak about the amazing sauce on the Amish Chicken dish). We ordered the tempura catfish special and Amish chicken. The catfish was really tasty, and came with tempura fries that were good as well. The Amish chicken had an amazing red chili/honey sauce on it that was full of umami flavor.  Would highly recommend based on food, service, and BYOB.",0.9822,0.721,0.279,0.0,0.6632142857142858
2017-08-01,5.0,"Bite is one of my favorite brunch spots.  They have high quality vegetarian cuisine here.  Everything I have had here has been sooo delicious except for their Chilaquiles.  Our go to here for brunch is their Veggie Eggs Benedict and Veggie Breakfast Poutine.  The eggs benedict can be made without the meat and it comes with a generous portion of spinach underneath the poached egg.  The hollandaise sauce and pimento cheddar spread are heavenly!  I am not crazy about pimento cheddar but this place makes me like it.  Their mashbrown is also great and a nice spin on the traditional hashbrown, breakfast potatoes concept.  Their vegetarian poutine is out of this world!  I love their mushroom gravy.  It's soooo hard to find vegetarian gravy for poutine because they are usually beef or chicken (how lame), but Bite offers a truly scrumptious mushroom gravy for their poutine.  Their fries are a great balance between crunchy and soft, the gravy and cheese curds are well distributed along with the fried eggs on top making for an oozing liquid deliciousness once you pop that egg yolk. The pickled chilis are good but I think they could have giardiniera or banana peppers instead of the pickled chilis.   I also came here for dinner once and loved their vegetarian burger.  It was not that generic frozen stuff you get, it was fresh and made right there with tasty aioli and generous serving of fries. It's also BYOB, which makes it even more appealing of a place to eat at.  The prices are reasonable, especially for the quality of food you're getting.  Then the BYOB aspect makes it even more affordable to come here.  Service is usually fine.  I just wish this place was bigger and had a patio.",0.9971,0.777,0.218,0.005,0.6131207482993197

2017-07-09,4.0,"You wouldn't necessarily expect for a quality restaurant to be situated on this relatively colorless stretch of Western, but it would be unfortunate if you missed the opportunity to sample the food here. Bite Cafe has a casual-cool vibe which makes it seem like it DGAF, but a glance at the menu items shows that an abundance of Fs are G. The dishes have obviously been conceived with a lot of care. Breakfast was the meal that brought me here. I started off with their great coffee, sourced from Dark Matter, a blocks south on Western. I opted for their acclaimed Pork Hash. The poached eggs and spiced hollandaise added a richness to the underlying hash, which featured very flavorful pork shoulder, chunks of tender potatoes, and enough vegetables so you don't feel too guilty eating it. It was the best breakfast I've had in months. Why only four stars? Service was somewhat inattentive, never checking on the table after the food arrived, and only offering a coffee refill after it was obvious that I was done eating. I hope that was an anomaly, because the food here was truly excellent.",0.9897,0.758,0.2,0.042,0.578125

2017-06-25,5.0,"Can I give Bite Café 10 stars? Yes? How about 100? I think I just found my new go-to breakfast/brunch spot. Let's start with the coffee. With my absolute favorite coffee, Dark Matter, I knew right away that this place couldn't possibly disappoint. I was right, this is brunch heaven. The one thing that bothers me more than anything about restaurants is how sterile many of them they try to make the food to the point where theres no balance, complexity, or personality in the food. I was so glad to find that Bite Café's dishes were all  pretty rustic without sacrificing the quality or presentation. This is what i'm truly all about. Started with the biscuit with jam and butter. This biscuit had a wonderful golden crust on the outside that leads the way in to a warm, flakey, buttery inside that's absolutely arousing. The housemade jam it comes with is so delicious and paired with the butter makes for the best sweet and salty combo. You won't regret it. We ordered the pulled pork scrambler and the french toast. Boy were these plates big! I don't usually get scramblers, but based on recommendations here I decided to give it a try. Boy am I glad that I did. Somehow they've given a new meaning to a scrambler for me. All the veggies were perfectly tender and not overcooked while the pulled pork covered in the hollandaise and poached egg yolk complimented it perfectly. It was heaven. Maybe could have done without as much hollandaise sauce just cause thats my own personal preference, but they certainly give you enough food and bread to soak it all up! The french toast was also wonderful! The rich goat cheese faired well against the sweet elements of the french toast without one overpowering the other. Although it was maybe a little soggier and I wished they used thicker bread, this certainly didn't pull away from the overall experience. All in all, a marvelous experience and my new brunch spot. Friendly staff, comfortable space (but pretty limited seating), easy free parking, easy commute from the south side while avoiding major areas like Wicker Park. Don't know what else I can ask for! I'll definitely be back more! Absolutely amazing.",0.9988,0.712,0.269,0.019,0.5908008658008658

2017-06-19,4.0,"Thank you Bite Cafe for being open early on a day that I was starving after class! Hooray! I stumbled upon Bite Cafe merely from a simple Yelp search that was open during the time.  I really enjoyed the interior of this restaurant from the simple seating, open space, and the paintings on the walls. I'm not sure if they tend to change the paintings on the wall, but I really liked the fruit paintings (which I DID INDEED mistake as photographs. Got me there.) Off the menu, there was a few things I really wanted to try. Ultimately, I went with the breakfast poutine. Why? I miss eating poutine in Canada and how can anyone really say no to fries and cheese curds? I enjoyed my food, but not enough that I would want to eat it again. I was kind of sad by the baby cheese curds. It was like minced sizes. I am looking for chucks that is oozy. I did not get it here. I still enjoyed my meal though.

Can't remember what the b/f got, but I also did order a side of biscuit and jam.  The biscuit had good flavor but was a bit dry and not sure if it was supposed to be that way, but the jam they served it with was good.  All in all, decent place, but will try others before coming back here, but seriously...the coffee.",0.9453,0.834,0.135,0.031,0.5634502923976609

Once we placed our orders, mine didn't come out for 30 minutes. When I asked for them to check on it, they kept insisting it would be out soon. Finally, after saying for the 3rd time it was on its way I canceled the order, everyone else had finished their meal 20 minutes prior. The bartender/ waitress gives me pushback saying ""Well if you want to cancel it, I guess you can but it will fuck up the kitchen""  Really??

I have a non-life threatening but very uncomfortable nut allergy. Bite cafe does not list all ingredients for their dishes on the menu. This has happened to me three times in the past at Bite where a dessert or entree does not have nuts listed on the menu, but the dish is covered in nuts, I eat it, and have an allergic reaction. Yes, since I am the person with the allergy, I should inform my waiter or waitress of this allergy up front. To be fair, I didn't do that, but I did ask the waitress if I could speak to the manager/chef etc.  She blew me off at first and tried to tell me that it's my fault because I didn't let her know about my allergy. I said, ""I understand, but I would still like to talk to the manager."" Before I finished my sentence, she stomped away to go get him, and didn't come back to speak with me. The manager, chef, or whoever he was, came over and I explained the situation, and that this has happened multiple times in the past. I asked him to list all ingredients on the menu. I wasn't angry or rude. I was simply trying to prevent another situation like this from happening to someone else. He said, ""sure, ok, I apologize,"" and walked away.  I wasn't fishing for a discount or free meal, but I feel the staff at Bite really blew me off in this situation.

The coconut bread came out similar to banana bread--slightly sweet and rather dense. I found it a bit dry, but the abundance of coconut flakes totally made up for it.  Also completely in love with the bibimbop here. It's hard to find restaurants that serve vegetables well outside of salads, but the vegetables were definitely the star of the bibimbop here. I also loved how they chose to use wild rice instead of white rice--it's healthier and left me feeling much better about myself after the meal.

Come to Bite to feel good about your decision-making skills. BUT, the last time I was at Bite, I ordered the Pork Hash and some of the potatoes weren't cooked for long enough, leaving an unintended crunch. One cube was literally uncooked.

Two of the dishes were very good, Calamari and the Beef Rib tip. The fish fry was polock, nothing special, and the hamburger ordinary. We had a challah bread pudding.

Bite Cafe is the bright yin to Empty Bottle's dark yang, and it's usually a perfect option for a weekend brunch with a small group of friends. With lots of familiar brunch foods you've seen on other brunch menus alongside a few signature wrinkles you'll only find at Bite, you'd be hard pressed to find something you won't enjoy. Get the breakfast poutine if you're feeling like throwing caution to the wind, or enjoy a hangover salad if you're a reasonably responsible adult. But regardless of which route you take, please make sure you order a side of mashbrowns. It's a game changer. The service can be hit or miss, but hopefully you're eating there during a hit.

The actual wait ended up being about an hour and 20 minutes, but we had gotten coffees at the nearby Empty Bottle, so we weren't quite as grumpy. There were some interesting selections from the menu, but I ended up getting my usual: Eggs Benedict. The portion was huge, and the eggs were cooked perfectly.

They have no corkage fee, yet bring out glasses for your vino and open the bottle which is always a lovely touch. I am a weirdo that brought a giant electronic wine opener...and....we didn't need it. I wouldn't call service overly friendly but they took care of business and got the job done professionally.  The food at Bite Cafe is wonderful with the menu changing often based on seasonal ingredients. My friends and I started with a shared appetizer - the Fresh Cheese, onion compote, Petite Salad and toast for $8. We all loved this and gobbled it right down. The cheese was whipped which made for nice and easy slathering onto the toast. Normally I hate onions. With a passion. Like every bit of my being wishes we could decimate all onion buds off this planet. However, I didn't hate it in jam form served with this dish. Small joys in my life. For my main entrée I had the Pan Roasted Whitefish ($14) which sat atop an acorn squash puree, green beans and a pattypan squash succotash. The fish was cooked well and all of the squash elements were much better than expected. Eating this for dinner gave me good health vibes and the dish satisfied me completely. I tried my friends Slow Cooked Beef Short Rib ($15) which was marinated in a bulgoki marinade. Bulgoki is one of my favorite foods in the world so it was interesting for me to have the marinade on another cut of me - I liked it! Like my dish, this had nice seasonal veggie accompaniments. I also had some of my friend's Grilled Cheese & Tomato Fennel Soup ($10) which I loved. I'd die for this! Four types of cheese (Cheddar, Wisconsin Raw Milk, Gruyere, Provolone) melted onto sourdough bread paired perfectly with their version of tomato soup. So many carbs but oh~so~mouthwatering. I would highly recommend Bite Café as a perfect date spot! It's an intimate location with great food at even better prices plus it's BYOB. I would keep groups small here. We were a table of 4 and it was about as big a group as I would be comfortable with in this petite location. They do not take reservations but there seems to be a waiting type area next door with pool tables. My friends said Bite Café's brunch is also great so I'll be back for that, no doubt. Loved this restaurant and see myself coming back often!",0.999,0.682,0.267,0.051,0.6029144551593532

We decided to share apps and went with the mussels, poutine, and a side of macaroni and cheese. While nothing we ate was bad everything felt like it was missing a little something.  The mussels broth was quite bland. It needed either some salt or a kick to it to make it work. I will say the mussels were quite large but I definitely got a bit of sand in one of mine.  The poutine was fine but it lacked the large cheese curds that I so enjoy in poutine. It was also unexpectedly spicy, I like spice but wasn't in the mood for spicy poutine that night.  Not much to say about the macaroni and cheese. It was good but I've had much better.  Finally, we got the salted chocolate brownie and ice cream for dessert. It was probably the most enjoyable thing we ordered; however, it's not served hot so don't be expecting that. I will say the salt definitely came out in the brownie which o loved. All in all Bite is affordable and has perfectly fine food and a nice ambiance but with so many other choices I won't be back.",0.9941,0.756,0.22,0.025,0.538415750915751

Our main course consisted of two amazing meals: a cheeseburger topped with bacon and a fried egg, and gnocchi with oxtail. The burger was extremely juicy, making for one delicious mess. The oxtail was flavorful but the gnocchi melted in my mouth and may have been the best part of the meal if not for the chocolate milkshake we split for dessert. Also my highly recommend trying their milkshakes, especially the chocolate. One of the best chocolate milkshakes we have had, comes with chocolate syrup and whipped cream.

There is some dilapidated large factory/sanitarium looking building across the street which seems to be a place people shoot up in front of or something because there were hypodermic needles on the ground. Be mindful when wearing flip flops! That would sure put a damper on brunching fun. Anyway back to food. All of the dishes here are super. Not that I've tried them all but I speak confidently in knowing they're great based on the few dishes I've had here myself. Good place, they don't rush you out the door and there are creative and tasty dishes on the menu.  They should relocate to Logan Square or a nicer area where they can have a patio setting and give Longman a run for their money.

2016-01-13,5.0,"A glorious gem in Ukranian Village, this place never disappoints, which is no small feat considering I come here almost every other weekend for brunch! The brunch menu boasts classic dishes, quasi-epicurean options crafted by talented chefs, lighter fare, homemade milkshakes, and a healthy selection of unique daily specials (that if spectacularly tasty, will eventually run out if you don't get there before around 2pm). The dinner menu is just as fantastic, and similarly features specials for each night of the week. I never order dessert but I did not regret it when I got the fried challah bread pudding with pecans, honey, and whipped cream a few weeks ago.   The staff are friendly and never miss a beat, my coffee is refilled at least three times without me noticing and the food comes out as soon as it's ready. The wait staff are always quick to detail their favorites on the menu when asked, making guests feel at home. The space is clean, pleasingly color coordinated, and lightly decorated, so as to feature the local artists' work that can be found on the walls and purchased if desired. Bite is BYOB and attached to the Empty Bottle, where you can purchase alcohol to drink without a corkage fee. The food is amazingly priced for what it its worth--I have yet to find another place that offers me the same quality for the outpourings of my wallet (all brunch entrees are under $15). Plus, I love the fact that I can wake up and walk over to Bite with a few friends, a bottle of champagne under my arm--without a reservation--and  eat like a Queen. I have brought countless family members here and literally every single out-of-town guest I have ever had. I even saw my boss here!? My absolute favorite brunch dishes are the Breakfast Poutine with bacon gravy (you can choose a vegetarian option of mushroom gravy), Pimento Cheese Eggs Benedict, and the Pork Hash. Luckily, everything you order here will make you want to hug your waitress and come back.  Be forewarned: if you go during ""busy brunch"" hours, there will more often than not be a small wait (definitely worth it) but that's only because this place is so coveted by locals and stragglers from other neighborhoods who've heard what all the fuss is about.",0.9959,0.833,0.158,0.009,0.4802579365079365

Only two downsides to this place: It's small, so there's usually a wait if you arrive after 10 a.m.  Also, since it's so small, if you sit near the door and it is at all chilly (or God forbid, cold) you will be blown with cold air almost constantly since no one respects the ""shut the outer door before opening the inner door"" rule.

Went for brunch this morning and wound up sharing a starter of the White Chocolate Pecan Bread along with the Pork Hash (which was recommended many times here on Yelp). Of the two, the Pecan Bread was the star. Warm, cakey, with a ton of flavor - I could have just ordered a few of these and been content. It's not like the Pork Hash was bad - it was tasty but it had a ton of Hollandaise Sauce (I'd ask for light next time) and the potatoes were solid but nothing spectacular.

The bar next door is a bonus while you're waiting, this weekend I was able to relive my childhood and played Street Fighter the arcade to pass the time and it was great! The atmosphere is really nice and welcoming! It is a little cramped but it's never really an issue if you enjoy a nicely packed crowd of people from all walks of life! I will say that it can get a little loud, I find that characteristic to be apart of the experience and don't mind it at all! The staff is great, they are always very welcoming! This recent visit our waitress was very open to making suggestions, quick little chats like that definitely warm up the experience. The staff is very attentive, our glasses were always kept full. The staff definitely help to maintain the positive atmosphere and it's not going unnoticed by me and my boyfriend. it really makes a difference! For starters, my boyfriend and I split the Tomato Soup! I have to say that it was pretty amazing, I kind of wish we ordered the meal that would have had the added bonus of the Grilled Cheese! That would have hit the spot! I should mention that the portion size of the soup was more than enough for the two of us to share!  I should mention that I am a Vegetarian and that I am very pleased with the menu! I've been fortunate enough to develop my taste for their menu and have my favorites.

The girl who greeted me when I walked in was kind of rude and blunt, but our server Christine was lovely. She made great recommendations on the food and it was hard to make a decision because everything truly sounded delicious.  I went with her suggestion on the Pork Hash, which was made with juicy and tender Braised Pork Shoulder, Yukon Potatoes, Onions, Tuscan Kale, Cherry Tomato, Corn, Eggs, and Spicy Hollandaise. AMAZING. It was a plentiful portion, and I even took some home to enjoy later. The specials they have listed on the chalkboard all sounded pretty fun and delicious. I tried the Orange/Coconut Bread for a sweet treat, and it did not disappoint!  My friend ordered the House Cured Crispy Pork Belly with Egg and Cheese, Sriracha Aioli and Cheddar Cheese served on an English Muffin. she loved that as well!  It's a cute little spot on the inside.

Today I wanted to try comfort food so, I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato fennel soup.  Yeah, the sandwich arrived with it's crusts cut off, which is how I like my grilled cheese! The sandwich was a little too crispy and could've used another slice of cheese. The tomato soup was thick and tasty. I would've liked some parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. My companions ordered the Pimento Cheese Eggs Benedict served with Arugula and something we've never heard of before: the mashbrown. It was an inch thick circle of fried potatoes and spices, very tasty, could've eaten another one. My other companion ordered the Pork Belly, Egg and Cheese Biscuit. The pork belly was fried nicely, not too fatty and his egg was cooked thru, not runny. The ambience of the cafe is simple: wood tables anchored by turquoise metal chairs offset by a floor to ceiling brick wall.

Bite is one of the original joints on the new Western Ave. Ukrainian Village revitalization, and it's also one of the strongest.  A great option for brunch or dinner - as long as you are able to amply be seated. It is much easier to get seated for dinner (no reservations! heed warning!) Very often I find there to already be a wait; sometimes up to 45 minutes. BYOB is a huge plus, as I've made my own mimosas for brunch and enjoyed beer and wine for dinner. For brunch, both their savory and sweet dishes are absolutely delectable. My recommendations: french toast or any of their hash/scramble selections featuring a plethora of appetizing ingredients that you won't find being used so innovatively in most neighborhood brunch establishments. For dinner, the burger, grilled cheese, and short rib are all great bets.  The only problem with Bite is that they sometimes ""bite"" (see what I did there...) off more than they can chew. Their more eclectic offerings, such as pasta, Indian, or Mexican dishes, often fall a bit flat and don't match up to ethnic cuisine restaurants. Although I suppose it's my own fault for being an adventurous eater. Stick to the American comfort food and you'll be amazed.",0.9844,0.818,0.153,0.029,0.527742946708464

(note: this wasn't my first time here). Kudos to Exec Chef: Dave Cooper & his Sous Chef: Todd Decker. My husband and I decided to tackle items off the special menu board. For some reason I feel this is where the chef/sous chef have more freedom w/creativity in a dish.

It took 45 minutes to get our food and I was given hash browns instead of fries. We sat at the counter so we could see my friend's grilled cheese just sitting in tge pick up window 20 minutes.

The restaurant is quite small so they have you wait next door...it's not the fancy of places, but at least you're not stuck waiting outside. We were seated in exactly half hour from the time we put our names down.  Our waitress was pleasant and my friend and I decided to go the lunch route. I got the veggie burger and my friend got the turkey arugula sandwich. Both of us were disappointed. Maybe it had something to do with the wait versus what the food tasted like. My veggie burger was bland. I was sort of hoping the red sauce on it would be spicy, but it really didn't have a taste. The fries were also quite boring and not seasoned well. I still have high hopes for this place though because after I ordered I sort of knew I should have went the breakfast route.

I'm so glad we finally decided to try out Bite! We called in our order and it was ready in 20 minutes. I ordered the grilled cheese with tomato & fennel soup. Once I got home I didn't find any soup! :( I called Bite right away and asked to see if we placed our order wrong, but they confirmed the grilled cheese comes with the soup. The gentleman I spoke with was very apologetic and I ran back to grab the soup. They even included a brownie and ice cream for the trouble.  I'm so glad I ran back to get the soup. In my mind, there are fewer combos that are as perfect as grilled cheese and tomato soup. The grilled cheese was on thick pieces of buttered sourdough bread. It had the perfect amount of crunchiness and I loved the combo of cheese they used. The soup was creamy, but not too heavy. I liked the addition of the fennel. I know fennel can have a strong licorice taste, but it wasn't overpowering at all and gave the soup character. I probably could've gotten away with just eating the sandwich though. It was very filling. The brownie and ice cream was also great. My roommate and I split it the next day and warmed the brownie up in the microwave. It's a very fudgy brownie and I liked the bite from the chocolate chips. I also have a love for the chewy edges of brownies and this one definitely had a nice chewy edge.  Bravo Bite Cafe!

So, you end up preparing your own breakfast at home. And then you stumble upon Bite Cafe. It could be that I got there as soon as they opened for business because the restaurant did start to fill up later, but not such that patrons had to wait outside for a seat. This was a huge plus. I had the challah bread French toast, mashedbrown, and eggs scrambled well with gruyere cheese. The French toast was so blooming good that it didn't require any more syrup than the maple syrup drizzle that came on it. The hazelnut butter and banana anglaise gave flavour without making the toast excessively sweet. The mashedbrown was a potato cake that I'd buy in bulk and eat in the mornings for a breakfast snack. And since I was able to get gruyere in my eggs rather than American, jack, or cheddar cheese, I was in love. So, it seems that Bite Cafe also has lunch and dinner menus.

It was a little out of the way of the Division and Milwaukee stretches, but we still ventured over there. We were quoted a half-hour wait on a Saturday and were informed we could wait in Empty Bottle next door. We waited in the vestibule area for 30 seconds, discussing if we actually wanted to wait 30 minutes or not, and the hostess came out telling us we weren't allowed to stand there. Fine. We went over to Empty Bottle, which was filled with some kind of art fair and also a bar. We saw people eating at the bar and realized that we would maybe be able to eat there. We decided to look around and wait. It was loud and we noticed the hostess walking around yelling out names, which may have been difficult to hear. Luckily, we heard our name when it was finally called. We walked through to the restaurant area. The actual dining space is small. Out tattooed waitress wasn't particularly helpful. When we ordered three entrees (one of which was poutine to share), she made a judgmental comment about how it was too much food for two people. We requested the poutine to come out first, like an app, which did happen. It tasted good and portions were big. My meat-lover skillet was also decent, but nothing to write home about. The poutine was probably my favorite.  She gave us the check with NO PEN. She was nowhere to be seen after that, so I ended up having to write on the check with my girlfriend's eyeliner pencil.

We had a late brunch at Bite yesterday, and it quickly shot up onto my list of top 3 brunch spots, sorry Bongo, you've been demoted. The atmosphere is chill and inviting, and unlike dozens of other local brunch spots, there is a pool/waiting room adjoined so when there is a wait, you're not packed like ravenous sardines around the perimeter of lazing, gluttonous patrons taking their sweet ass time finishing their meal - cue rage. I digress, we were seated right away at Bite and the very friendly waitress steered us in the right direction, recommending a few of her favorites. We settled on the Migas and Pork Hash, with a side of fries just because they looked like the absolute perfect specimen of fries, and they were. The Migas is basically chilaquilles, flavorful, delicious, with solid texture despite most of the ingredients being from the 'mushy' family. The pork hash was on point as well, the meat was tender and juicy, and anytime you toss in tomatillos, I have no complaints. We cheers'd the meal with grapefruit juice fuelled by our own BYOB Prosecco. Could this place be any more perfect?

I ordered the pork belly on a cheesy biscuit with egg. The biscuit was flavorless and dry. Another friend ordered a biscuit and came to the same disappointing conclusion. Dry and flavorless. You can't market your biscuit as a star of the show, a feature item on the menu and have it be an utter disappointment. My pork belly was SO salty. Almost inedible. And the pork belly fat was tough and gelatinous rather than soft and spreadable. Pork belly can be amazing. This was a total waste of a great ingredient. Seriously.

I like runny eggs, but I specified that I wanted them well done to avoid undercooked whites. Of course, the eggs arrived and most of the egg whites were clear and raw. There was also too much potato. Otherwise, the hash is not bad, but not as good as those at Yolk or Original Pancake House. The chicken and biscuits were bad. There was barely any chicken. The $12 dish was 75% biscuit and 10% gravy and cabbage. The biscuit was quite dry and the gravy a bit gloopy (maybe from cornstarch?). Not at all delicious, and so overpriced.  We had a pretty negative experience with the service. The lady seating people asked us to wait in the adjoining room until our third person arrived. We did for a while, then our third person did arrive, and we informed her as she had instructed. There was an empty table for four, but she gave it away to a party that had just come in. Not a big deal, because another table of four had just left. Minutes passed, and no one came to clear the table. She asked us to wait in the adjoining room. We went back to the adjoining room to wait, but there was a band was practicing with percussion, and it became so loud that we couldn't hear or talk over the noise. We went back to wait in a corner of the dining room. The table was still uncleared. The seating lady again asked us to go back to the adjoining room or wait outside (this is in December, so it was cold). I don't understand why she was so keen on herding us away and adamant that we wait somewhere else, as the dining room was pretty empty and we were in a corner, not in anyone's way.

2014-11-30,4.0,"The husband and I truly like the staff at Bite Cafe and the ambience. The ambience is casual with local artists' work displayed that changes several times a year.  The music varies with the personnel and that is cool. We enjoy getting the breakfast and lunch menu here more than the dinners because the selection of entrees has changed so much. Everything emphasizes red meat or seems to include bacon or cream during dinner and the vegan/vegetarian options usually are heavy on pasta or other carbs, or fried, or otherwise are heavier than we prefer. Breakfast and lunch options (available from 9am to 5pm) are lighter and more appealing to us!  The morning bread is big enough to share and a quick bread reflecting seasonal flavors! It's particularly good with the Bite Cafe Blend of Dark Matter coffee, which is only available in a full octane caffeinated version, which I love! The husband doesn't like Bite's inability to prepare his eggs in a soft un-browned version. He limits himself only to soft poached eggs if he orders them at all. He enjoys the soups, except those that feature potato or bacon; the breakfast taco, the black beans (number 3 quality version in Chicago, IMHO), the Bi Bim Bop, and is willing to try new menu items when they appear.  I enjoy the breakfast taco made with egg whites, the tofu scramble with black beans instead of the mashbrown and multigrain toast instead of sour dough, the side salad, the seasonal entree salads, and the grilled asparagus or vegetables when available. We like the evening fish dish when it is prepared without cream or bacon. The vegetable sides are usually very good especially when dairy free.  The desserts are limited to their after 5 Pm seatings.

I ordered a breakfast taco which I thought was really good. I also got the biscuits and gravy which was very non-traditional they had an orangish cheesy looking sauce all over them rather than your classic white sausage gravy. It was still pretty good but nothing special, I wouldn't order them again. I also ordered a side of eggs which were cold and a bit stiff. My wife got the classic which is very difficult to mess up. She did request all bacon and still got sausage which was really a tasteless hamburger patty sized slab of meat. I cut it up in pieces and threw it in my B&G which was OK. All in all, it's sort of your run of the mill hipster breakfast joint. Prices were great, many other things on the menu looked good. The taco was excellent so I would go that route next time around.

2014-10-31,4.0,"Came in on a Thursday night around 9:00 with my husband and two of our friends. None of us had ever been before but were thrilled to find out that there was a non-sushi BYOB fairly close to home (west loop). I had read on Yelp that there are often long waits for this place, but we were seated right away, probably due to our later arrival time. Food was excellent, but service was a little spotty. Our server was super nice, but it was very obvious that she had too many tables. When we arrived, we were quickly seated and given menus and waters, but our server didn't come by to take our order, not even for apps, until 15 minutes later. There were only a couple of empty tables when we arrived but only two servers for the entire restaurant! Not the servers' fault, of course, but something management should be aware of. Poutine: ordered the poutine with mushroom gravy and asked the server to leave off the chiles - I'm Canadian! Peppers don't belong on poutine! It was AWESOME. Easily the best poutine I've had in Chicago - yes, better than BadHappy! Tofu Tacos: the spicy slaw was too spicy for me, good thing I ordered it on the side. The tofu was nicely seasoned. Tacos were good but nothing special. Short Ribs: hubs ordered this. I'm a vegetarian so I didn't try it, but he was very happy with the quality and quantity of the meal. At $14, I think this is probably the best deal on the menu! Burger: friend had the burger with egg, cheese, bacon - all the toppings. He said it was excellent and especially liked the consistency of the egg. Pork Gyro: this is a huge meal! the gyro itself is stuffed with fries - kind of confusing since the way it was written on the board made it sound like it was a side of fries. But it does come with a side of mixed greens. Salted Chocolate Brownie: just ok. It was a good amount of saltiness but the brownie was thin and a little hard/dry. I prefer a more moist, crumbly brownie, which this was not. I probably wouldn't order it again - I'd try the bread pudding, though! Overall, I was really happy with this spot and we will definitely be back. For the 4 of us, our total bill was about $70 plus tip. Pretty amazing for the quality of food here! It really pays to BYOB! I can't wait to try out their brunch! Note: They were playing really weird, pretty loud metal music. Not sure if this is a normal occurrence, but it was kind of an ambiance killer. Also, the fact that you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom is just plain weird.",0.9988,0.733,0.225,0.042,0.6246170983013086

Love that this was BYOB and that you can buy beer/wine from the bar next door. Makes it easy when you forget your own booze. Also loved the decor - super cozy & cute. 2. Had the hangover salad to start - this was a hit, likely something I'll try to recreate at home. 3. Mac and Cheese - hard for me not to order and while it was tasty it wasn't my favorite and probably not worth the cals. No breadcrumbs, or bacon - they kept it straight and to the point but still wasn't my favorite.  4. Steak Tacos on Special - both my dad & boyfriend ordered these, I didn't try them but mainly they didn't like them. They did not look great - the meat looked sub par quality and they had a weird sauce on them as well, would stay away from this. 5. Falafel sandwhich - Amazing french fries, sandwhich was heavy and nothing out of the ordinary.  Other things on the menu jumped out at me: grilled cheese & tomato soup, whitefish on special, burgers - I really think we just ordered wrong.

Short ribs were fork-tender and oh-so-flavorful. Mussels were tender and juicy and the broth was to die for. If I had to nitpick, the sausage appetizer was probably the least exciting.

We ordered the salted caramel brownie for dessert and overall that was a 3.5/5.  You get a dense, fudgey brownie (which, although it was good, the texture of it almost reminded me of those little debbie cosmic brownies) topped with a scoop of delicious vanilla ice cream and smothered in hot fudge. Service was attentive and friendly.  Given the fact that the menu changes often, I would maybe stop back.  But I wouldn't make any special trips for it.",0.6336,0.798,0.108,0.093,0.4400621118012423

I would highly recommend it if you are in the mood for chicken. I also tasted the Pan Roasted Steelhead Salmon and the Skate (Fish) special. The Salmon was good, but slightly lacked in flavor.

Now, dessert was a big letdown.  I had the salted fudge brownie again, and unlike last time, the salt was too heavy-handed.  I had taken too many bites to send it back, but it was not good.  The fried challah bread pudding was excellent though.

The menu is New American with different specials like risottos and braised meats.  Another time I came back for brunch and was happy I did. The Challah bread french toast was a good start and big enough to share. The pork hash was filling and so yummy.

The restaurant atmosphere is much less hole in the wall and more hipster contemporary.  Friendly service, crowded tables, and a lively buzz of conversation.  We only waited about 20 minutes for our table for 2 on a Sunday morning at 11:00 last week. I'm embarrassed to admit that my friend and I were totally unoriginal when we ordered, because we couldn't afford to pass up what seemed like hands down the best option.  She ordered the pork hash...and I ordered the pork hash, without the pork.  Both were amazing.  Just a heaping bowl of deliciousness - potatoes, seasonal vegetables, and perfect flavor.  I don't normally eat the whole entree of anything but I basically licked my bowl clean this time.  My only complaint was that one of my eggs was over poached so my yolk did not drip down when I cut into it, but that's a small price to pay for the otherwise perfection of this dish. To be fair, everything on the menu looked pretty amazing as we saw it come out to other tables.  My only complaint (aside from the fact that they don't take reservations) is that they don't offer a vegetarian sausage option.  Come on people!  You're a hipster BYOB restaurant off of Western Ave - you have to offer a veggie sausage!  Even Prasino does it.",0.9928,0.798,0.168,0.034,0.5276896875734084

I waited for about 10 minutes for anyone to return with the coffee or to take my order. My waitress did return and did both. I asked a question about carbs and what items on the menu would be considered lower in carbs and the face/attitude I received from the server was beyond disgust. I was wasting her time for sure. I also asked for a sugar substitute for the coffee. She said they had none. She gave me ""Truvia"". I had never had it and asked her what it was and she said ""I don't know, that's what we have"". Ok.  I open my napkin which contains the silverware and there is no spoon. Just fork and knife. Nothing to stir the coffee. I grab a setup from the empty table next to me and find the same. No spoon. I guess they don't give out spoons unless asked. My fork was dirty as well. I try to make eye contact with my server as well as two other servers behind the counter (about 30 feet away) and no one looked in my direction for the entire next ten minutes while waiting for the food to arrive. They were quite busy laughing and chatting with each other though. At which point I surmised that the patron I thought was sitting at the counter was actually either an employee on break or someone known/related to this restaurant. Their convo/banter was well beyond the patron level. No problem. I stirred with the back end of my knife.  Food comes. It was very good. Waitress then shows up every 5 minutes to refill my coffee. Cream is empty after second cup. She doesn't notice or even look. Ok. I was coffeed out anyway. Both other tables leave and I am the only one left except the person at the counter. I wait over ten minutes for the check. I pull out cash, I need to split. I never thought a quick bite would take an hour. I only ordered a salad (only low carb option). Waitress doesn't return. She is again involved with other staff behind the counter talking and smiling and seemingly having a nice chit chat. She never broke anything close to a smile in her brief forays to my table. I thought I was dealing with the milk lady in the cafeteria in third grade. You know, that one with the hair net and the mustache.  Finally she looks over from the counter and asks across the empty room if I need any change. I say no, not able to wait any longer, and leave the cash on the table and exit.  Summary: Food is very good. Coffee not bad. Splenda should be available. Put a spoon in your setup. Pay some attention to the customers. Smile every now and then. 2 stars for the good salad. When you need a semi dive joint that wants to pretend to be ""hip"" and there is nothing else around check it out.  Would I return? No. I never liked that milk line lady anyway...",0.7776,0.829,0.085,0.086,0.4627233115468411
2014-03-17,5.0,"Bite Cafe totally nails it for brunch! Small, cute little shop and probably a decent wait every weekend but well worth it. We waited 45 minutes and stomachs were growling but at least they have a waiting room in between Empty Bottle and their location.  Had a lot of trouble deciding on my order but went with the Pork Hash. I was a bit nervous the portion size or at least amount of pork would be small but it was HUGE with a ton of pork. The pork shoulder was so tender and flavorful. The spicy hollandaise was the perfect compliment and mixed with the yolk from the eggs, brought everything in the hash together.  Next time I am ordering the Chicken Thigh Migas which is similar to huevos rancheros but with chicken and scrambled eggs. Ugh if I wasn't so full I would have stolen it all off my friend's plate. Third buddy got the omelette of the day which was also packed with goodies.

Whether brunch of dinner, Bite's cozy, relaxed atmosphere, always-changing yet familiar-feeling menu, friendly staff and all around good vibes deliver every time. The food is fresh, delicious and very fairly priced.  If you bring beer or a bottle of wine to share (BYOB is an option and seems to be quite popular among Bite diners), you can easily walk away with a satisfying meal for two for under $30, which compared to many other places nearby, is a steal.  A favorite of mine is the pork hash, which comes with potatoes, kale, butternut squad and a few other ingredients all tossed together, topped with two poached eggs and served atop a couple pieces of sourdough toast. They also serve Dark Matter coffee, which is great. Among Shaza's favorites is the cheddar biscuit with siracha aioli. The mashbrowns are awesome, too. If you're in the hood, check out Bite.

2014-02-26,4.0,"Long-time resident of the neighborhood, I ate at the original Bite frequently.  Good, reliable food.  When the revamped Bite opened, with its poorly designed sign that makes the ""B"" resemble the number 13, I thought I'd give it a shot.  The food was pretty good, though for the life of me I cannot remember what we ate due to the toxic service we received.  It was busy, so customers were pretty packed in.  We were in the middle of the dining room, at a table for four.  Our waitress, who seemed to be in hell...she radiated misery, kept bumping our heads with her elbow every time she raced passed us.  No apologies, or even an acknowledgement that she made contact with one of our craniums.  After an hour of this, we nudged our table three inches to the right.  The waitress in the adjoining station then proceeded to yell at our waitress within earshot of everyone for not controlling her guests.  We got dirty looks from our server the remainder of the evening. Now, I returned recently.  My partner and I were having a Valentine's day dinner early, since he was to be out of town on the actual date, and we didn't feel like driving anywhere.  We thought we'd give Bite another chance, and we're glad we did.   It was a Tuesday night, so the restaurant was only half full.   Our server was warm and attentive, even though it appeared she had the same amount of tables that our server had on our first visit.  Our appetizer was the fried oysters and grits...a bit paltry even for an appetizer, and with under-salted grits.  Our main courses were astoundingly good.  The beef cheek pot roast was amusingly presented shredded and pre-tossed with roasted carrots and onions.  It was succulent without the oppressive fattiness that can sometimes mar a traditional pot roast.  My partner had the skate wing, prepared properly, and as delicious as any higher-priced restaurant we've been to (one of us usually orders skate wing if it's on a menu).  We normally skip dessert, but we ordered the bread pudding.  Perhaps the best bread pudding I've ever had.  Served hot, with a light crispiness and a velvety, eggy interior.  Instead of the obligatory gooey, tooth-rotting bourbon sauce, it was topped with fresh whipped cream.  The light sweetness of the cream balanced the bread pudding nicely.   Great meal, great service.  I won't wait another year to return.",0.992,0.855,0.128,0.017,0.5707850707850708

I don't know what that bun was made of, but it was delicious. For that breakfast touch, I ordered the hash browns as my side. Again, I was very pleased. Not your typical, run of the mill hash browns, these were perfectly seasoned, formed into a patty and deep-fried. My friends, both carnivores, raved about their bangers and biscuits in particular. The coffee was good and quite strong. Our waitress, whose name we didn't get but who wore an ""I Love Mpls"" t-shirt, was very pleasant and had a good vibe.

It was pretty good for the most part. The patty was thick and juicy. My girlfriend had the crispy duck leg confit served with Brussels sprouts and butternut squash. She loved it! She said the squash was a nice touch to the duck leg and the Brussels sprouts were amazing. This dish was small though and she had room for dessert. I got to try the gnocchi from my friend and let me tell you, this was amazing. She has been dreaming about this dish since she tried it and I can see why. I will be ordering this dish the next time I come here. Since we weren't too full, we ordered the gingerbread cake and salted fudge brownie for dessert. The gingerbread cake was topped with apple better and whipped cream. This was good but it was a little too overpowering. The salted fudge brownie was topped with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. This was amazing! There was enough ice cream for the whole brownie. This really hit the spot.

Huge piece of tofu, with spicy slaw. The poutine was quite delicious. We went with bacon in the poutine, which was good. I might recommend a bit more bacon, but still good. She was really wanted bread pudding after being disappointed that another place ran out before she could get to it. So, this was my surprise to her. The bread pudding is awesome.  My golden rule of ""if it ain't chocolate, I ain't eatin' it"" was broken here. Very tasty, topped with whip cream and well worth it.

I know they have cleaned up their act, and I cannot deny that there are a couple things they do really well, but overall it is such a meh place.  I ate there last night and  1) The service was pretty bad. I cannot imagine that the servers here could possibly work in a larger establishment. Yes, the place was packed, but there are no more than 15 tables in the place, and I think its probably closer to 12. The apathy was pretty brutal.   2) The sausage risotto was gross. It looked gross when it came out (please add some herbs or SOMETHING, because cream and brown as a food color is just not appetizing) and just didn't really have flavor. Needed more parm, less sausage. It just wasn't good. My husband's poutine was fine. The oysters and grits were pretty good. The challah bread pudding was very good. This place is just *fine* at the end of the day.

Also helps that they are walking distance to the Division Street strip of bars for some nightcaps after!

Our appetizer was the mussles, or, the deliciously addicting pistachios of the sea, overflowing with flavor, complete with bread to soak up that leftover flavor juice!  I tried my friend's beef tongue sandwich and that was equally as tasty. Also, DO get the bread pudding for dessert. A flavor assault on your mouth!

And when I checked Yelp to see they had an almost perfect rating, I was sold) I wasn't aware that there was a dress code. Shoot, and I left my knit cap, black-rimmed glasses, and ironic t-shirt at home. But no worries, because every single other person in the restaurant had theirs on, even in 90-degree heat. Gotta hand it to the hipsters, they do their thing even when it's melty outside. Ok, I'm going to nix with the judgy judgy.  Okay, first of all. Parking? Big problem. Aside from Western Ave. itself, almost everywhere nearby is residential only. DO NOT PARK HERE! RESIDENTIAL PARKING ONLY! NO PARKING! DO NOT THINK ABOUT PARKING! I swear they should put up a sign that says, ""JUST GO HOME"" because that's what I almost did.  But upon finally finding a spot to park and making our way to the cafe, we went inside to find (hipster central, yes) a cute industrial looking space with brick walls and light blue metal chairs. Digging the look. A friendly girl in an airy dress and covered in tattoos took our name and said to wait outside. So we did, since the idea of waiting inside was pretty much impossible.  No more than five minutes later (we expected 20-30) we were seated in a nice two-top in the window. We were handed paper menus that were divided into breakfast and lunch (brunch) options and immediately another nice tattooed girl took our drink order.  SIDEBAR: Just to clarify, I have nothing against hipsters nor tattoos. I'm just stating their presence because to a suburbanite (or Jen Lancaster) they can sometimes be startling.  Back to the review. Wifey ordered the breakfast poutine because poutine has been on her/our bucket list for awhile, thanks to the many Canadian food shows we watch, and also our friend Barb who loves the stuff (and is also Canadian).  So yeah, I didn't like it. The fries were really salty and greasy. I don't like greasy fries. But Laura enjoyed it so I was glad of that. I had the pork hash, which was really tasty. The pork was tender and well-seasoned, the eggs were perfect and the potato/corn/pepper mixture really gave it a great flavor. Everything was freshest and didn't taste like it had been frozen or sat around, so big ups on my meal choice. Prices were fair, people were friendly, almost no wait on a Saturday morning.

Huge fan of th chickpeas, cherry tomatoes and aspargus that came with my trout.  We were fans of the fried mussels & grits and the smoked pork belly to start.

2013-03-15,4.0,"Bite Cafe is a hidden treasure in Ukrainian Village. We dropped by on a Thursday evening for dinner and were immediately impressed by the restaurant's simple yet warming and comfortable setup inside. There was ample parking and the place, while small, was easy to find.  The food portions were large and filling and while we only ordered two dishes, both were excellent.  My buddy got the Beef Stroganoff and it was far better than any stroganoff I've had before. There was a lot of flavor, some of which was surprising and went well beyond what you might think a usual dish like this would taste. All components were well cooked and part of me wish I had ordered this instead!  But I got the pork shoulder steak special and I have zero regret. The portion was large and came on a bone, served on top of delicious short grain tomato rice stir fried with some greens. There was also a brush of sauce over the top of the pork steak and I couldn't tell what it was besides the fact that it was yummy and went well with the meat. The steak itself was well cooked, crispy around the edges and lined with a small amount of fat that was just amazing with the rest of the meat. There was a smidge too much oil in the rice/greens and a little too much salt on the steak for my personal preferences but those were minor and didn't take away from the dish as a whole.  Overall, considering the price and in comparison with other restaurants around Chicago, the value and quality here at Bite is very, very good. Service was very fast, the waiters were friendly, and the atmosphere was conducive to good conversation (not much light though). Of no concern to me, but maybe for others, the restroom for customers is inside the kitchen.  4 stars for great tasting food at a pretty good value.

I wished I had ordered that instead of the grilled cheese which was nothing more than a plain Jane. The bite mac was a delicious stack of mess with the double patty and usual ingredients. The poutine was a complete disappointment. It was my first time having poutine. I'm certain that wasn't how it was supposed to be made. The fries were soft and drowned in what appeared to be dried lard. It was supposed to be smoked bacon gravy and cheese curd. Not quite...  For dessert, we had fudge brownie and cardamom pound cake. Both are a huge slap on the self-conscious calorie scale, but I will have to worry about that later. The fudge brownie was freshly baked with the outer layer having a slight crisp. The sweet chocolaty richness was engulfed by the polarizing vanilla ice cream. Each bite was a melt in the mouth! The pound cake was less buttery than usual.

The Duncan left us desiring more flavor.  The biscuits were old school cast iron style, fluffy and caky, but would have been on point with a tad more butter (come on, it was a country biscuit!).

2012-08-04,4.0,"Places like BC are why the food scene in Chicago is the envy of the country. Without a doubt, food options in The Windy City are going to be, about, the best you'll find in the US of A. Part of what makes it so magical is the fact that good food -- really good food -- can be found in just about every neighborhood and these neighborhood spots have a feel all they're own. I was never one for hanging out much in Ukie Village. I liked it. I liked it a lot. But, I didn't think that I had the Williamsburg swagger to pull off living here. But, from tree-lined streets to cool cafes, this is your Chicago neighborhood for real cool (Pilsen never found its footing, Logan Square is Wicker Park and Bridgeport will never cede to the hipster revolution). Bite Cafe is perfect for the 'hood. To walk inside Bite Cafe is to experience it all. It's not large. There are brick walls, smallish tables, a big ol' menu board that hovers above the kitchen, an impossibly pretty brunette waitress, and, big, pretty windows that look out on to Western Ave. That's all it needs. I never made it here to eat the dinner options. I've read they're good. But, come on. You're here for breakfast brunch. You got up late. You might be a little hung over. You may be in the midst of a walk/drive of shame. Whatever the reason, you're here. You want breakfast. You do. You want fresh orange juice. Lots of places offer it but it never quite tastes the same in every resto, no? Here, the citrusy goodness will wake you up and put a smile on your face. Being so far away from orange trees and sun, I didn't question why or how such a thing was possible. I just enjoyed. You want a breakfast taco. You might think to yourself that you don't have room for it and your meal (and, you won't) but you *really* need to get it. There ain't nothing wrong about scrambled eggs, jack Cheese, black beans, and pico de gallo in a tortilla. The taco's bigger than you think. You'll eat the whole thing and be happy about it. You want breakfast poutine. Breakfast.Poutine. Any respectful person who enjoys food, sunshine, smiles from a baby, and/or breathing air won't need me to explain why this is heavenly. But for the one person who needs to understand, understand this: this is a mess on a plate. This is why you live in the Midwest -- so you can eat things like this under the cover of 6 months of winter and hide the food triplets that grow in your belly. Enjoy. Relish. Some of us live in a land of heat and sun and are shamed at our eat-like-no-one-will-see-you-naked-for-half-a-year bodies. But we regret nothing. Nothing. Why?

But a good friend lives nearby so this is always a consideration when in UKV. My first visit was fantastic! The Parisian gnocchi is delicious and is mixed with fresh veggies. Compared to otherwise ""normal"" gnocchi, this one is incredibly creamy and tender, full of flavor -- not as chewy as what I've encountered otherwise. I've sampled the mussels in a wine/butter sauce, and they were delicious. I've also had: Burger - pretty good (standard option), good fries Pulled pork - pretty average, won't get it again. Underwhelming. Grilled pork chop - pretty good, worth trying (hefty chop portion) Judging from the other reviews, I need to try the brunch options. I also like the small size and decor of this cafe and the comfortably casual, conversational wait staff.

We can just walk over. We never have to wait longer than 15 or 20 minutes, so that's awesome!!  The food is great. I think I may have tried everything on the menu, probably not but most of them. My favorites are: Egg Duncan, Pork Hash and they used to have the Chorizo Hash too. It's so good. They use plaintains in the bottom of the pork and chorizo hash, so, you get all this spicyness and then bam!!! sweetness comes along. So good! YUMMMM!!! I've also had the Almond Crusted French Toast. Really yummy! On a hot summer day, sometimes I ordered the milk shakes. I mean, they are to die for!!! So good!!!! However, since i come here very very often, I get bored sometimes with the menu. They have specials on the board, so, that's nice but it's pretty much the same everytime i come in but i still love the food though.  It's byob! But, if you forgot to bring your own bottle, you can just cross over to the empty bottle and buy yourself a drink and bring it over to Bite and have it with your meal. Not too bad. The service are always great. They have very friendly staff. I can't recall all of their names but i know elise (i think that's how you spell it) always waits on us and she's always very uppity and nice and super friendly.

Therefore, I am fairly confident that this place has the best tomato soup in all of Chicago. The place is cozy, warm, and bright, with a very friendly waitstaff. It can be a bit of a wait for a table, but come on, people, the place seats like 40 people. Be patient, and belly up to the bar for a glass of wine that you bought for $6, and are drinking FOR FREE.

I don't know why the waitress just didn't do it), the unexplained menu, or the overall service. So to start off we ordered a burger, the poutine, and the fries with ""Garlic"" aioli. The menu did not say what came on the burger just that you had to pay an extra dollar for:cheese, bacon or fried egg.  Got our food finally after some time, also keep in mind there was no one else eating in there except 2 other people. The rather tasteless burger was smothered in their so called aioli. We asked to have new buns since my date did not like mayonnaise based sauces. I noticed the cook make some very annoyed looks towards our table even though after asking what came on the burger aioli was not stated. The cook then decided to come out to drop off the burger himself, actually dropping it on the table and storming away. Keep your little hissy fits in the kitchen.  The burger then ended up just sitting on the table since we just wanted to leave after that. I ended up trying some of the dry burger meat just to try it, it tasted more like it has been sitting in a charcoal grill for a few hours. The bun was also burnt, I could literally smell it burning.  The aioli had absolutely no garlic taste let alone any flavoring to it (tasted more like olive oil). The poutine gravy was also rather plain. Oh..but the cheese curds actually were good. Bottom line, I will not be going back to this establishment, and if that cook acts that way about asking for A NEW BUN, he should of let the waitress just do her job and bring it to the table.  I do want to mention that the waitress was very apologetic and ended up comping my date's burger.

We got seated immediately, which at 10:30 on a Sunday, is a miracle in itself. It's a cute place, not what I expected, and I was pleasantly surprised. Angie went for a basic breakfast of bacon and eggs, but I was feeling a bit more adventurous. I was waivering between the breakfast tacos or an omelet, before finally settling on the Eggs Duncan.

2012-04-14,1.0,I wanted to like this place but I'm not sure if I got an off night or what. I'll start with the food first. My gf and I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and a burger. Simple enough sandwiches. The pulled pork was all right (not sure if $11 alright) but decent. The burger was completely overcooked. The outside was charred and tough and it was not juicy at all. This is important to note because our waitress asked if medium was all right for the burger when she took the order.  This brings me to the service which is what really brought down my review from a 2 star to a 1 star. Walking in the waitress that was supposed to be acting as a hostess continues her personal conversation with her staff friend. It was not until my gf interrupted her that she acknowledged her and we took our seats at the counter. About 5 minutes go by and we get no water or menus. So we get up and get our own menus. About 7-8 minutes go by after that and the other waitress notices we haven't ordered. I ask for no salt on my fries and at this request she seems taken aback and/or offended. Ok. We still don't have any water and two girls walk in and sit right next to us to which the male waiter IMMEDIATELY brings them glasses for their wine and water. Ok. About 5 minutes after that we get our water and menus (wtf?) from the other waiter who seems surprised that we've already ordered.  I don't normally write reviews this long if I don't have to but I feel it's essential to explain the complete disorganization of the staff at the restaurant at the time we went. Everybody working there really seemed like they didn't want to be there. I get that. But at least fake a smile or something.

2012-04-10,2.0,"Perhaps it was my fault.  Our waiter told me that the chicken would be 20-25 minutes, ""Is that alright?""  I asked for his recommendation, ""Is there anything spicy?"" ""Spicy?  No, not right now.  Not really."" ""Well what would you recommend?"" ""The pork shank is really good."" Maybe it was my fault for taking the advice of someone so skinny.  In hindsight, he probably wasn't a meat-eater.  Maybe he recommended it because it was the most expensive item on the menu.  Maybe he saw that I didn't fit in with the clientele and wanted to open up his table as quickly as possible. The pork shank entree is basically a hunk of meat that is fried and tastes like nothing but salt.  It comes with what seems to be one of those Jewel insta-salads that comes out of a plastic container.  Lots of rucola and a sliver of a red pepper here and there.  For 18 bucks, I figured I would get something with a little more flavor.  If Bite added a few small potatoes (better yet, croquettes!) and some sort of gravy or jam, it could be worth it. My boyfriend had the pulled pork sandwich, which I was incredibly jealous of because not only was it cheaper, but it came with real vegetables (broccoli, some kraut, and a pickle).  Well .... more vegetable-like than lettuce, anyhow.  He liked his sandwich but he wasn't overly enthusiastic about it either. I left the restaurant not feeling full.  If I were to ever return (unlikely) I think I would have to look to their vegetarian options (e.g. the rest of the menu) because at least those were served with some sort of carb.",0.384,0.88,0.063,0.057,0.5129120879120881

2012-02-07,4.0,"'m a fan of Bite and I was fortunate enough to try both a brunch and dinner menu. I like that it's just down the street from me and I really like the BYO policy. If you go for dinner on a friday or Saturday night you'll also have the pleasure of waiting for a table next door at Empty Bottle and listen to live music. Bite is small and quaint a few tables and small counter near the kitchen. The decor is clean and functional with very friendly and good servers. And as with most BYOs, you receive good overall value with affordable dishes and no liquor costs. We ordered a lot for dinner and really enjoyed our selections. I preferred the dinner menu but probably mostly because of the variety and ability to eat more. The brunch menu tended for favor savory items (my preference), large portions but a small selection. I sincerely recommend checking out Bite - particularly for a solid BYO, neighborhood spot that doesn't involve sashimi. It almost classifies as a hidden gem. But enough praise, what did we eat? My main course was a special of the night and included a huge head of cauliflower served on vegetable barley with a tomato vinaigrette. It was fantastic, with great flavors and interesting textures. The sauce had just enough acidity to make things interesting but not too much to ruin the flavors of the vegetables. It's something you could have found on any menu in river north.  Erica's main dish was the potato gnocchi and it was our least favorite of the night. For as interesting as it appeared - and the presentation was very good - there just wasn't any flavor once in your mouth. I almost thought it was a magic trick (and maybe they were perfectly executed gnocchi) but it just left wanting for more. We also ordered 2.5 appetizers to start: one veg spring roll, meatballs and mac n cheese. I ate the spring roll and thought it interesting and well designed. The sauce is very sweet and I liked the crispy texture. It's not a blow your mind dish but tasty none the less. We both loved the meatballs and marinara sauce - the five servings did not last long. Finally, the mac n cheese was also impressive, and large. We have high standards for one of our favorite dishes and this version was quite good. I made it better by adding some Dark Matter bbq sauce (though I was a little surprised to see a $1 charge for that on my bill...), and appreciated the good service with a piping hot plate with a slightly blackened top.  We took the plunge for dessert and somehow avoided the milk shake selection and went with the fudge brownie. It wasn't my favorite and seemed to lack character of love (just felt like it was done out of necessity). It also wasn't particularly warm which always makes it taste better particularly with ice cream.  As for our brunch (which was weeks before we went back for dinner): We only ordered two things, one entree each and a side of amazing bread (pumpkin if I remember correctly..?) and ridiculous brown butter. I would return and eat six orders of the bread as a meal.  I ordered a scramble with lots of veggies and Erica had a traditional ""two eggs"" breakfast with sausage and toast. Most of their choices come with their ""mashbrown"" - another delicious creative concept of potatoes browned and served as a patty crispy on the outside and mashed in the middle. Erica didn't love her entire dish with sausage and toast and standard scrambled eggs (kind of mis ordered), but I was happy with my remotely healthier vegetarian option and plenty of food. Again, most of the menu items lean toward the savory and lunch side of brunch so if you're looking for flap jacks and silver dollars I suggest IHOP. Not only is the food great at Bite Cafe, but I love the vibe, setting and style of the place.

Service was great even after we told her we had a  restaurant.com  certificate. Our server came right over to open our wine and give us a run down of the menu/specials. The menu has an overall comfort food theme - but scaled up a notch. I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup. The grilled cheese was excellent - Sourdough, Wisconsin Cheddar, Smoked Gouda, Provolone, Cured Tomato - yes please! The soup was good as well, though pretty standard. Oh, and the Mom's mac and Cheese was also a tasty treat that we all shared to start. While it didn't blow my mind, it was definitely good. Others in my party ordered the gnocchi, duck leg special, and short rib - all met with positive reviews.

The coffee was pretty tastey and they were good about refilling that and the water so props to them on that.

After hearing the tales of grandeur, I knew I had to get to the 'new' Bite Cafe and I also knew I needed to go on an off time to avoid fighting the frenzied throngs of foodarazzi. A blizzard-y Friday afternoon turned out to be the perfect time to snag a table in the reformed Bite. Walking in, my eyes were met with polished but charming insides including exposed brick, thoughtful art and partly vintage but mostly French blue chairs. J'adore! Since you already know this story's delicious middle, let's cut to the chase: I spent a solid fifteen minutes contemplating selections with my colleagues. Darlings, this is a serious menu and it deserves your undivided attention. But once I noticed the Staquille O'Neal scrawled on the chalkboard... well, I was a goner.

2012-01-19,5.0,"I just love this place, it's my parents favorite place to go since Flo switched owners/management, so I come here fairly often when we go out for dinners.   The staff is down to earth, professional, friendly, and doesn't try to pull wool over the eyes with their opinions of the menu.  As a BYOB place, I really appreciate the staff's courtesy with regard to offering to refrigerate your beer if you bring a 6 pack, instead of letting it slowly get to room temperature while it sets on the table.  Diana is AWESOME (if you remember her from Twisted Spoke, you should know), as are many of the other staff whose names currently escape me.  The size is quite small, and cute, so even if there are a few other tables occupied (usually there are plenty of people here, which is good!  I love Bite!) it doesn't feel like you are the only table there.  (plus did I mention the waitstaff is awesome?  They aren't all up in your grill, just perfectly attentive!).  In addition to the service being stellar, I love that the bathroom is *always* super clean, as is the kitchen (you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the toilet).  These things are wonderful, and the music they play is always fun but not in a way that will make you think you're at an Empty Bottle show.  Oh, no. The thing that I really appreciate about Bite is their menu is extremely well balanced: vegans and meatheads alike can eat here, and each course's offerings are also DAMN good.  Appetizers?  Yum.  Want a soup or salad?  Both will be good (soup changes daily).  Entree?  Tasteeee!  The desserts are evil, and as a recovering cookie monster, I mean that in the best way possible. Some of my dinner favorites include: Curried tofu Pork shank (they don't offer this all the time, though they SHOULD, because it is love on a plate!)

2011-12-19,4.0,"I have Aurore L. and Yelp to thank for helping me discover this little gem. I am so glad I stumbled upon her critique/this recent review of the day and made the trip to Ukrainian Village a couple hours ago! I will burst if I ingest one more bite (no pun intended, promise) of -anything- for the rest of the night, but I couldn't be happier.... As the saying in Spanish goes - ""barriga llena, corazón contento""!* I went there considerably early (or at least early for me, since I tend to have dinner around 8-9pm) and was worried the place would be completely deserted, but luckily a few diners were present so it didn't seem like a no man's land. Loved the decor of the place - simple color scheme with splashes of blue (chairs+other elements of the decor), minimalist paintings on the walls, exposed brick... Very pretty. Oh, and I loved the fact that the restaurant was perfectly lit - not too dark that you have to squint to read the menu and are quasi-blind by the end of the meal, but on the other end of the spectrum - not too bright that you feel like you're in a McDonalds or something. For starters, my dining companion & I split the fish tacos (we missed the part that said they were $4 each, or else we would have ordered two!!) I can't believe I'm blanking on the exact ingredients that made up this special of the day..! I do distinctly remember, however, the spicy aïoli, which was absolutely fantastic. The fish was piping hot and lightly breaded, so not overly crispy... basically the fish tacos were spectacular. I barely glanced at the menu because after reading Aurore's review I knew I wanted one thing and one thing only: the mussels. I was fortunate enough to have lived in Lima for about 4 years or so and have enjoyed the most fantastic seafood in Peru. I am constantly looking to satisfy my craving for seafood in the US, and Bite Cafe definitely hit the spot. The steamed mussels were exquisite! And the broth... oh my don't even get me started... Kudos to the chef for concocting the rich, pumpkin-colored liquid goodness in which my mussels were drenched... It's already been mentioned before but I might as well reiterate it for my own sake (I'm going to attempt to emulate this at home) - garlic, leeks, bacon, smoked paprika Butter, and I'm assuming many splashes of white wine. If I didn't know for a fact that my dining companion would be mortified if I just started lapping up the broth that remained post-mussel consumption, I probably would have.  My dining companion had the meatball sub with parmesan, provolone, and arugula (note to Bite owners: arugula is misspelled on the menu of the website). It looked decent, and he said it was pretty good but definitely not better than the fish tacos.  For dessert, I had a few bites of my dining companion's fudge brownie. Good, but not anything out of this world. He was disappointed that it was served with a sort of a hazelnut sherbet instead of a proper, creamy ice cream. I wasn't too bothered by this fact but I guess a more rich ice cream would have been a more appropriate element to this classic American dessert. We both hated the brittle or English toffee that was on top of the brownie. When I go back (note how I say when and not if, I cannot stop reminiscing about those mussels and that superb broth...), I will probably try the spiced apple cake instead. I was intrigued by the pumpkin flan as well, as it matches 2 of my favorite things in the dessert category.  Our waitress was very nice and courteous - I appreciated that she apologized profusely upon informing us that the kitchen didn't have mustard for our table. I was a tad disappointed, but then again mustard isn't a very common accompaniment for moules-frites I suppose. I still think Bite Cafe should have it for mustard lovers, just in case..!  The only bizarre thing was the fact that to get to the bathroom you have to walk through the kitchen... I felt like I was intruding at first, but on my way back it was actually kind of exciting to catch a glimpse of the dishes being prepared.

The bird is a juicy little thing, with a fried shell akin to the firmness of candy coating, the flakiness of pastry, and a helping of seasonings like wafting opening the spice pantry. The fries were respectable and the booze involved a fun little errand of slipping through a side door, speakeasy style, to nab it from the neighboring Empty Bottle. While the place is good enough for me to set aside my sloth and review it, I fear it's impossible for me to have the drive to exhaustively detail the nuances that make it great.

Staff kept walking past dirty tables, just kind of looking at them and then walking back to the kitchen empty-handed (couldn't they have taken the dishes with them as long as they were going?). The waiter came over to take the order of the couple next to us; they'd been sitting there for 15 min's since we'd been there (so, longer than that)... instead of taking our beverage or food order at the same time (efficiency?), he kind of wandered around the restaurant as tho in a trance after leaving their table and eventually made it back to the kitchen to (theoretically) put their order in. The dirty tables didn't get cleaned for about 25 min's... and the stream of in-coming customers was steady. (Some gave up and left.) No one entering seemed to know what to do (do we sit? do we wait for someone to seat us?). We entered at noon. Finally left at 1:30. (And only b/c I asked for the check as soon as they brought our food. I knew that if we waited for the check passively, we'd be sitting there for 1/2 hour after our food was done.)

I had the fried chicken and 40oz combo, which means I get to go through the secret door to the Empty Bottle, order a 40oz beer and voila a free mac and cheese appears on the table while I'm unscrewing my Big Bear 40oz.  The little lady had the gnocchi which was one wink shy of heaven. My fried chicken was full tilt, complete with sweet potato fries and a light cole slaw and tabasco hot dipping sauce. We shared the 40oz and savored the delicious meal and then licked our plates clean.  We finished the meal with the homemade rich fudge brownie topped with pecans, malted caramel sauce, whipped coffee cream, and a stout flavored ice cream, all made in house, prepared with love and knowledge and devoured bit by bit while we drooled and giggled like school girls.  The service was top notch all the way, 20% tip territory, personable, friendly, a bit feisty, a bit funny and all around enjoyable.  The atmosphere is warm, inviting, relaxing, laid back and perfect for a slow dinner. We have found our new favorite restaurant. Bite for dinner on Saturday and Feed for Brunch on Sunday. God Bless the United States of Freedom!  The Big Bear 40oz made me feel very sleepy, almost drugged, but that has nothing to do with Bite.

For those who don't know what I'm talking about, Poutine is a deliciously-messy concoction of French Fries, cheese and Gravy.

This artery clogging meal includes a pouched egg, home fries and cheese covered with a deliciously, fattening gravy. I devoured everything on my plate.

There is also some odd looking art on the walls, presumably created by local artists. But who cares about art when you have a plate filled with Eggs, taters and Gravy. That's all the art I need.

I was a little scared when they closed for remodeling earlier this year, but I need not have been worried. Bite came back better than ever, even though a few old menu favorites had bitten the dust (like the veggie burrito...R.I.P, veggie burrito).  I have been eating at Bite for about 10 years now. I'll admit that I don't get terribly adventurous, in part because I love their hamburgers (even more since the reopening). The salad with grilled tofu added is also fantastic and for breakfast, you can't beat the sweet potato hash. Bite gets extra points from me for consistently wonderful desserts (please bring back the butterscotch pot du creme!).  Bite has always just felt cozy to me and though it feels like home, it also somehow makes me feel like I'm on a road trip every time. All in all, the new and improved Bite is still top on my list.

2011-05-31,2.0,"I didn't think there was anything wrong with the ""old"" Bite Cafe, so I was curious as to the new renovations / menu.  First, super bummed they took the veggie reuben off the menu... as it was a favorite of mine. But I thought, oh they're moving towards more ""upscale"" fare... but that wasn't exactly the case, as the person I was with ordered the Corn Dog special off the board. (For the record, he thought it was just okay, altho agreed for $7, the price was a little steep for a corn dog) I ordered the Veggie Muffuletta, described as such : Veggie Muffaletta - $10 Piquillo Pepper, Oven Cured Tomato, Olive, Provolone Super Disappointing for the following reasons : #1 NO TOMATO - none, just wasn't on the sandwich. 3 out of 4 ingredients isn't cool. #2 Wasn't even on Muffuletta bread, which should eat like a sub. Instead served on focaccia bread, which is very different. The entire sandwich was mushy as a result. #3 The chopped olive paste was unbelievably overpowering, like eating an olive sloppy joe. Even after I took off about 2/3 of the olive salad, everything tasted like olive. Literally inedible.  Also, and this is a minor detail, but the service was, for lack of a better word, a little awkward. Every time our waitress would come to our table, she'd sort of hover over us, making small-talk-esque comments & then just sort of back away slowly, mumbling. It just seemed like a lack of confidence about the menu.  This is place is in my neighborhood, so I probably will be back at some point, but I'm not in a big rush. With so many choices nearby, (Lockdown Bar & Grill was bumping that afternoon, we shoulda known!) I just can't waste cash on meals to throw away.",0.9768,0.799,0.139,0.062,0.5112142158916352

The ricotta spread in a jar is served warm I give this one A+. The hangover salad with a poached egg - love it - I am always a sucker for egg yolks as a salad dressing. The sandwiches are huge, and can easily be shared if you have a few appetizers. Delicious handcut fries, a great selection of breads used on the sandwiches with fillings that are equally tasty.

We were started off with a great plum coffee cake with fresh cream. I'd looked at the menu ahead of time and knew I was going to get the fried chicken leg sandwich; we also went with the poutine and a ham stack special. All was really tasty, but that sandwich still lingers in my mind. I'll be going back soon for it. The poutine was as good as I've had outside of Toronto, though I could've used still more cheese...but that's life as a cheese fiend. The ham stack was anchored by a mash brown...the ""what is a mash brown question"" was answered deliciously by it turning out to be a fried mashed potato patty. It was good enough to be ordered a la carte and enjoyed sans accoutrement.  That fried chicken leg sandwich, though. Tender, crispy, perfect bread, perfectly spiced slaw. I could eat one daily. Go get you one. Though there wasn't really room, we also finished off a butterscotch pot de creme and some fresh strawberry ice cream which was mind-blowing.

When I was there for brunch, I ordered the Bruschetta and Mashbrown (think McDonald's hashbrowns but WAY better). So yummy. And they have Dark Matter coffee (from Star Lounge). For my first dinner trip, I had the Philly Cheese Fake. I was skeptical because I don't tend to like vegetarian dishes that resemble meat, but this sandwich completely changed my mind!! It wasn't overwhelming like those other vegetarian sandwiches that just plop a giant mushroom on a bun. Instead, it had these perfectly cooked, thinly sliced portobellos with onions, green pepper, and provolone cheese. The bread it was on was also amazing -- super fresh and flaky. I've been thinking about this sandwich ever since! The second dinner trip, I reluctantly ordered something new. This time I tried the Risotto special with peas, king oyster mushrooms, and a pea mint puree in the bottom. It was also amazing -- the perfect spring dish. And don't forget to order dessert!

The new Bite Cafe's food is ridiculously good. We really like the upgraded kitchen and dining area... nothing too crazy, just  an upgrade people! The food!!! That chef Rodney Staton (Longman & Eagle, Spiaggia, Topolobampo) knows what he's doing!!! The Meatballs in tomato sauce were delicious. The meat was perfectly cooked - almost med rare inside. The size of the meatballs was perfect... not those gargantuan balls you get elsewhere. That marinara was so light and delcious, with just a sprinkling of fresh parm... and the bread was soft, yet grill-marked up... don't know how they achieve that. I had the chicken... and I have to say that it was probably the best chicken I've ever tasted in my life. It's a half an amish chicken, deboned except for the leg. Oh man was it just perfectly tender, juicy and succulent. And the crispiest skin I've ever tasted on chicken. It was served with about a head's worth of garlic, which pretty much scared me at first sight. But they were slow-cooked, confit-style - and we're incredibly sweet when I mashed them up with my fork. I'd scoop a bit of the mashed garlic with every bite of the chicken, then I'd run it through the most amazing sauce on the plate. Garlicky-sweet and rich, yet light and savory. Incredible. My wife had the salmon, which had some of the best salmon skin I've ever tasted. Served with hericot verts and leeks, in a mustard sauce at the bottom of the plate. Again, the sauce was an absolute star! The plating over everything was beautiful too! It's a bit 'pricier' than before - but damn-worth the $41, plus tip.

There were some flubs like not getting spoons at brunch for coffee or getting presented with brunch menus when there for dinner - but nothing major and everything immediately corrected because the service is much more attentive.  BYO service is good - whites and beers were put in the fridge and iced (need buckets for the tables) and bottles were opened and poured for us.   The Food - - - - I know that there has been some controversy - see some of the other recent reviews - and don't get me wrong I miss my eggs bite - but the new menu just is not to be compared to the old one.  The focus is different (was veggie tex-mex-ish with no focus - now more ""American classic"")  and - the quality of the ingredients is different (before somewhat generic (with the exception of the desserts) - now you can tell they are using higher quality ingredients and better product).   The new menu is more limited, but tighter and more balanced.  There are still different specials each day - and I was happy to see that. For brunch - the ""bruscetta"" with the mushrooms and leeks and strong sourdough was very flavorful.  The poutine was too much for me - but others disagreed and loved it - and I did find myself repeatedly dipping my toast into the bacon gravy. The homemade biscuit was super fluffy inside and fresh and the French toast has its own twist with the sea salt whipped creme that made my morning.  The coffee was very good - strong like I like it - but my companion wanted a latte and they only serve drip . Finally - those mashed browns  - go get them - order two - they are the stuff that makes a brunch special and on the day I was there they sold out ( we were able to get one for the table)!  I also went for dinner and I am still thinking about the homemade ricotta appetizer - the hint of citrus and chili really makes it a standout for me.  The fried chicken leg sandwich is addictive - its huge - and I didn't think I would be physically able to eat the whole thing - but then - I did - I couldn't help myself.  The fries however left something to be desired.  The pasta dish with the pesto was bland and muddled if well portioned.  We shared the veggie/vegan special of grilled romaine w/ cauliflower and chickpea - and it was above average and creative.  The  1/2 chicken was the table favorite it was perfectly seasoned - the skin crispy the meat juicy ...going back for that. I've been in the neighborhood since 2001 and I have been eating at Bite since then and I will continue to go there.  I have never yelped before- I check it all the time for opinions and ratings -  but I wanted to start now with Bite because the some of the recent low ratings below seemed based mostly on what those yelpers miss (i.e. low rating because bite is not the same place it was) and not what the new bite has to offer now and I think thats biased - but understandable - basically this is a new restaurant not simply a renovated one- Bite has been around for over 10 years - I think the change was needed and has been well executed and shows that the restaurant is not afraid of change and - in my opinion - it improved.",0.9986,0.805,0.147,0.049,0.5246270743145742
2011-03-30,5.0,"I've been twice now, first for brunch and then again for dinner. Both times my dining companion(s) and I decided to share plates so we could try more things.  For brunch, we shared the beet salad (which was my favorite), sweet potato hash, smoked salmon plate, yogurt and granola, and french toast with pecans and maple syrup. All pretty straight-forward and tasty. It was opening day so I was happy to see so many options.  For Dinner, we shared the lentils with caramelized onion, preserved lemon, parsley, and french feta. I love all legumes and did really enjoy this, however, I would have like to see a little more parsley and just a hint of lemon juice and olive oil. For entrees we shared the Duck confit special with white beans and beet greens. I really loved this dish. It was perfect for me as both duck and beans are two of my very favorite things! The duck was nice and crispy on the outside and came right off the bone. We also shared the Bucatini with oven roasted tomatoes, pesto, and of course parmesan. It was one of those dishes that is perfect in it's simplicity. Portion sizes are good. Sharing those three dishes amongst the two of us was certainly enough food. We opted to also split the pot de creme for dessert. It was creamy and delicious but very sweet. The pecan sandies were great but I kind of wanted to shove a salty pretzel stick in there. That's just me though. I love salty and sweet!! Overall, I am really happy with the changes! There are still plenty of vegetarian options as well as several dishes that are gluten-free. Everything is very fresh, both the food and interior!  It was a much needed face lift. I was never a super-fan of the previous Bite so I'm not bitter and full of hate.

Yes, the new decor is very nice, the matching chairs and lamps, the renovated ""bar"" area. It's all very very nice. But that's about it, Bite has no character, no spark, no bite. Now, it's just another regular breakfast place with an absolutely regular, boring menu options, that are not even cheap anymore.  I don't know/care whose idea it was to remodel and revamp the old Bite. Maybe it was the new management, maybe the hipster clients weren't leaving enough tips, who knows... All I know, is this - no longer will I proudly bring any visiting family members, numerous couch surfers, and unaware friends to this regular boring cafe.  Sure, change is good, but not when it turns an original, eclectic, fun, tasty and cheap neighborhood staple into a ""Meh"".  Looks like the management is following up some of the negative reviews with a ""give us a chance to get on our feet"", but what could they do? Are they gonna replace the uniform printed menus with the old book covers? Are they gonna bring back the original breakfast items to replace the totally blah sweet potato hash and poutine? I don't think so. If the place is not smashing on the opening day, or weekend, it's done. Everyone knows that restaurants and cafes only go down in awesomeness with time, not up. I wish the new Bite the best of luck, I'm not sure how they are going to attract the polished clientele that they new slick decor calls for, but I doubt that the regulars, hipsters or not, will return for the second try.",0.9723,0.766,0.15,0.084,0.5302789091250627

Even the photography on the walls is mundane. What a waste of resources. The place really only deserves 1 star now. It was dead at 10:30 on Saturday morning, where it used to be bustling with activity. The menus used to be clad in old book covers, the tables were recycled from a derelict diner, and even the art on the walls was eclectic and unique.

2011-03-28,2.0,"I used to love Bite. I think, objectively speaking, I might even like the new Bite if I'd never been to the old one. But it truly pales in comparison. It's prettier, for sure, and fancier, but from the decor to the menu, it really lacks character.  A fake philly cheese steak? I could get that anywhere. The Bite nachos, the miso tofu, the incredible veggie cheeseburger, the list of amazing options now missing from the new menu is nearly endless.  Bite USED to be one of the absolute best vegetarian options in the city, with tasty food at a reasonable price point, just grungey enough to be hip but too nice to be a diner or similarly hole in the wall joint. The new Bite looks like every other new cafe in town. It looks cookie cutter cute, but not special. It almost feels like a pretend restaurant, an art installation on the modern trendy brunch cafe. Not to mention, the new menu lacks the assortment of tasty beverage options Bite once had (an awesome soy cappuccino, watermelon lemonade) and the limited dessert menu (Bite used to have nightly specials, usually 3-4 options) has nuts in every single item, making people will allergies look elsewhere for sweets after a meal (some of them don't even need the nuts - I don't understand pecan sandies with pot de creme). Pluses are the much better tea options and the aforementioned pot de creme (I made my girlfriend eat the nuts off of the top and the cookie that wanted my mouth to swell shut, but I'm one of the lucky few with nut allergies who can get away with that). I'll admit that Bite is pretty, and I appreciate the effort, but it's simply no longer worth the effort. What was once a staple of my dining routine is now one of so many generic options. I mean, I'm a vegetarian, if I want a sandwich, I can go to Jimmy John's or something.

I think that you could get the same kind of ""kitchy/fusion/veggie-friendly"" food at better places, like Earwax or the Pick Me Up. If you have a choice, go to those places, you will be much more satisfied. I have been to Bite for Breakfast, lunch and dinner. For Breakfast, I had the pancakes. Pretty hard to screw up, right? They were more like crepes. Which isn't a bad thing, but if I knew that I wouldn't have put anything on them and eaten them with just the powdered sugar they put on them. They were oddly lemon-esque and not in a good way. My friend had the breakfast burrito. It was filled with giant pieces of potato. They were hotter than the rest of the burrito and were not seasoned very well. It was inedible. For Lunch, I got the nachos, which are an appetizer. I could have made better at home. Do not bother to get these, they are just not worth it.  My friend got their macaroni and cheese. It was bland and she had to cover it in Tobasco in order to eat most of it.  For dinner, I got an unremarkable burger. Again, I could have made better at home. It was so boring I don't even remember anything about it. These are the basics.

It wasn't particularly memorable, so I hadn't gone back for years. Cut to my friend Kris S. (formerly Kris W.) telling me in 2006 or 2007 that her favorite restaurant in Chicago was Bite. I decided to give it another try and lo-and-behold, she was right. Now I have a standing date at least once a month but usually twice a month, at Bite.  Absolutely the only problem I have with Bite is that the recent menu change took off my beloved orecchiette dish. The bi bim bop with tofu is definitely my new go-to and I do love it, but I pine for the days of my pasta with raisins, pine nuts, chili oil. It's okay because the specials change nightly, so if I'm not feeling bi bim boppy, I'll go with a poultry or veggie dish off the chalkboard. If you're wavering between a special or a menu item, ALWAYS go with the special because you don't know if it will be up on the board again! Ask the waiters what's good if you are on the fence.

Maybe Bite made a believer out of me, but I think the fact that the corned beef wasn't completely minced up into tiny pieces, and it didn't taste like it came from a Dinty Moore can was enough for me. The food was fresh. It had fresh vegetables in it, the meat was cooked perfectly, and the dish looked beautiful on the plate. It had been well-thought-out and well executed, and that's enough for 4 stars. The food was under-seasoned, but I took care of that with the handy pepper shaker from the table. My friend who was with me said the omelet he had was the ""best he'd ever tasted."" Definitely a great find at a great value.

Oh well. No flavor to the meat or cheese.  The bun was good. I like buns.  Mac 'n Cheese - The Mrs. had this and it was pretty decent. She liked it more than me, which is what matters.  It's definitely not worth going back for and not even in the realm of what other Chitown places like Kuma's Corner serve. Almost really good, but not quite, like my jokes. Let's continue.   Apple Spice Cake (dessert) - Very good!  Finally, something with some life served to us. It was sweet, rich, and flavorful.  Great with coffee or a chai on a cold night.  At least our boring meal ended on a high note.  So far the meal was like shopping at a thrift store - kinda boring but with some interesting highlights. In the end, we didn't come away with much to write Mommy about.  Sorry Mommy, no letter for you this month!  The mail goes both ways you know!  Service - This is where I disagree with some of the reviewers below. Or server was acting way too overwhelmed for only working 4-5 small tables. He could barely keep himself at our table without running away. What's up with that?  We're nice, quick to decide on food, etc.  We later discovered the reason for his hurried state. He wanted to get off his shift to catch his pals play at the Empty Bottle next door.   We saw him later when we went to the show. Sooooo, that's why you are acting so squirrelly.  Sorry we kept you busy at Bite, but we came to eat then checkout the show.  While working, he also found time to talk to his gal pal in the booth who was waiting for him to get off his shift.  Nice for her, not fun for us. This is why our waters weren't refilled once during the meal. Or why my coffee went cold, again, with no refills.  At one point in the meal, our server came to our table and dramatically paused, opened his hand then closed it in a ""compose myself""  gesture to center himself, then asked if we wanted dessert. Eye of the Tiger, dude. You need to get it.     Also, in a dramatic move, he spilled the a chai drink while putting it down on the table. It spilled on the table, onto the floor, and onto the Mrs.' funky scarf which was sitting on her purse.  The server said ""Shit!"" and ran off, acting like he'd be back to clean it up. Actually, he didn't come back to clean the table, floor or my wife's scarf. He ran off to service other tables for the next 15 minutes. He forgot all about his spill. Realizing getting help with cleanup was a lost cause, we had to flag him down in mid-trot to ask for more napkins so we could minimize the chai stickyness. He literally ring-tossed the napkins onto our table as he ran by in a fake panic. At least he had better aim this time and the napkins landed safely.   To sum up this review, we wouldn't recommend going out of your way to visit Bite Cafe. The food isn't worth it (maybe we should have had something else?). The service isn't worth it (from our experience during one visit).

So much so, in fact, that I decided it deserved a more positive Yelp review. I feel it's necessary to mention that this time around we came in later on a weeknight so the place was near empty, which was a big difference from the last time. However, this time the hostess/waitress was very polite and courteous. She greeted us right when we walked in and was very polite and attentive for the duration of our meal. Since I was actually able to try the food this time I can say that the eggplant/goat cheese appetizer was especially delicious, and the Mediterranean chicken sandwich I had as a main course was not too shabby either. In conclusion, I'm guessing this place is hit or miss.

We ordered a piece of plum upside down cake to go, and devoured it later that day.  Mmmm.   I found myself in need of dinner tonight, and decided to go back to Bite.  I had the house-made watermelon lemonade, and a double veggie cheeseburger, which was one of the best veggie burgers ever to pass these lips.  For a side dish, I tried the summer slaw - cabbage, zucchini, and carrots (I think) with a lovely vinegary sauce.   That would have ordinarily been more than enough...but since I'm pregnant (that's an acceptable excuse, right?) I ordered dessert too.  Cherry cornbread cobbler a la mode.  It was marvelous.

I've only ever had two particular servers - I'm guessing the ones who work in the mornings are not them ;D - so YMMV, but we definitely have our orders taken promptly and  I was impressed with the vegetarian options and substitutions, although having been there several times, I've found that the thin-sliced seitan (used in sandwiches like the Reuben and the Pepper Steak) is in need of a little something - it's kind of dry. Definitely go for the chorizo seitan if you're a faux meat fan - it's good.  Better yet, order off the board. The specials are almost always tasty and the better options. The soups are really good here, especially. The watermelon lemonade is FANTASTIC and the sweet potato fries were good. We always get the Buffalo Tofu - it's spicy, but I was impressed: as someone from Buffalo, the sauce is reasonably close to actual Buffalo wing sauce, rather than the sticky-sweet barbecue sauce or tomato-based hot sauce that seem to be the ubiquitous substitutes, and the tofu is pretty well cooked.  I really haven't experienced any below average service, and always enjoy the food. Could some particular selections be stronger?

The last Bite experience I had (about two weeks ago) has pretty much deterred me from ever coming back again even though it's just down the street from my place and the food can be decent. Two weekends ago my friend and I went there for a late Sunday brunch (around 2:30) and the service we received (or lack thereof) really pissed me off. I haven's seen my friend in about 5 years and wanted everything about her visit to be cool and positive.  We sat ourselves as we were waved at to do. We waited for either of the two waitresses to acknowledge us. One finally arrived with two menus and waters without saying ""hello"" or ""would you like some coffee?"" She walked away, as I was asking her if i can get a cup of coffee. The coffee arrived, but no cream, so i tried to make eye contact she looked at me but continued to ignore me, so i went up to the counter to ask for cream. Then she returned and said ""if you're doing breakfast, we gotta do this now"". I was fully aware of that as it said in the menu that Brunch is served till 3. It was about 2:50 at this point. My friend and I each ordered an egg sandwich. Our food arrived, and again, the server didn't bring any ketchup or hot sauce, despite the fact that the other diners seemed to have been graced with enough precious attention to receive them. Again, I went up to ask for ketchup... The food was fine, whatever, it's not like we ordered anything that we expected to blow our minds. Anyway, the check arrived and I couldn't wait to get out of there. I apologized to my friend for the shitty service, I paid and we left. The thing that really annoys me is the fact that there are tons of people out there in need of jobs who would probably treat everyone with respect, but instead the servers @ Bite are unfriendly and make you feel like you're bothering them. The other part of this is the fact that I work as a waitress in  a diner as well and I would NEVER treat a customer with so much disrespect, no matter what. As a server, and a very friendly one, I expect to get decent service and am very understanding if I see that a server may be too busy to get to me right away, however, I am also very aware if a server just doesn't give a damn about his or her customers and just hates his/her job.

I've been talked into going here more than I'd like to admit by my old lady, and for the most part the reason I wince at every Bite experience is because of the atrocious service, and not so much the below average food. Not this time. I'm never the guy to voice my displeasure at a meal and usually find something redeeming in what I order, but Bite truly challenges that mindset.  I started with the buffalo tofu appetizer, which bore almost no similarities to what one would think buffalo tofu to be.  The closest I could approximate the sauce to would be an unpleasant mix of soy sauce and sri-racha hot sauce w/o the hot. My actual meal was supposed to be grilled cheese and fries - hardly what one would call difficult to execute.  However, what emerged (after an initial order screwup) was a stale pile of bread with what seemed to be Kraft singles in between, and some fries that were barely cooked.  Finally all the iffy prior experiences at Bite welled up inside me and I decided it time to say no and send that pile of trash back. On the bright side, while the food was terrible it was the first time our waitress wasn't a completely vacant/horrible person and she removed the offending offal from the bill.  Here's to the little things.  If only Bite could score in both columns.  Sadly, I don't see that ever happening. I'm giving this review two stars because they did give me water without having to ask and my lady sort of enjoyed her meal - but she's a vegetarian so her tastes are bound to be a bit skewed ;-) If after this review you still insist on taking your chances, I'd advise calling ahead to see if what they list on their website menu is actually available.  It's been our experience that less than 1/3 of what's listed is really made in that kitchen.",-0.3135,0.847,0.08,0.073,0.5193181818181817

But, we made the mistake of going there recently on a freezing cold Friday night. The hostess told us that they could seat us in 1/2 hour and that we could wait next door in the Empty Bottle bar and have a drink. This sounded acceptable, so we were led to the Empty Bottle via a side door that connects one business to the other.  The bartenders at the bar told us that they weren't serving. They were closed while setting up for a concert. When we said (nicely) that we were waiting for a table next door and that we wouldn't be seated for a 1/2 hour, the hard-ass bartender chic said we could wait outside if we didn't like it. So, we sat without drinks on a ratty couch in the chilly bar, trying not to get hit in the face with the butt ends of people's pool ques as the 1/2 hour wait turned into an hour.  The bar eventually opened just before we finally got our table. We were able to carry our drinks next door with us. They were the only drinks we had that night, because Bite alcohol comes from the Empty Bottle and the bar stops serving restaurant customers at 8PM, or something. It's a very confusing alcohol system. The table next to us was also having trouble figuring it out why they were being cut off mid meal.  All of this would have been OK if a friendly server had greeted us at our table and said "" Thanks for being so patient."", or something, but instead, we were greeted by a tired and cynical waiter who was apparently more miserable than we were.

I found the space to be cozy, reminiscent of a college town cafe with no-frills furniture, local art and somewhat closely packed tables. The sign at the entrance kindly suggests you let the outer door close before opening the inner door to the cafe to conserve heat. The dining room was clean but not pristine, and the kitchen, from what I could see, looked reasonably tidy. The menu is definitely eclectic, everything from burritos to seafood to pasta dishes. My friend got a BBQ pork sandwich that, while not as good as what you'd get at a dedicated BBQ joint like Fat Willy's, was certainly decent. I got these tacos that used seitan ""chorizo"" (you can also get them filled fish or pork). Now, I'm no vegetarian, but our waitress suggested it as her favorite, and having never eaten such a thing before, I decided to give it a try. It was surprisingly good, and the meal definitely hit the spot. Which leads me to the main complaint I see in other reviews, namely the service. Our waitress was quite pleasant, helpful, and speedy with our drinks, meals, and check. The food came a little slowly, most likely because it seemed like only one or two people were manning the kitchen. But the wait was not unreasonable.

Artsy in feel, it's maybe not the ideal place to bring your uptight mom... but if you're OK with feeling like you're in hipster central at a place with great food, this is the place.. If you order off the menu, the entrees are around $8 or $9.  The menu is good, but the chalkboard menu for dinner is where it's at... still.  the chalkboard entrees have gone up slightly in price noticeably over the past year or so, but most things are still $13 on average...  and usually there's one (like a steak dinner) for $15ish.  I *always* ask what the best thing on the chalkboard is and they're pretty honest about it. It's BYOB with no corkage fee.  Though if you don't feel like BYOing, they're connected internally via a door to the empty bottle, so you can go next door and buy a bottle or glass of wine, a drink, etc (that door locks at 9pm though). I love the place, I'd seriously put it as one of my favorite restaurants in chicago.  And I'm not just saying that because it's across the street from where i live :] bigbitesite.com  is their web site, though it seems like that's their catering site? (who knew they catered?)... they have a verrry long list of items they can make for catering, i have a feeling a lot of the chalkboard items somehow derive from a lot of those things...   Actually the empty bottle's site also has their menu, though they just changed their printed menu last week so that version is at least two versions outdated now...  emptybottle.com/bite.htm   .. ...but not too different at the same time from what the printed menu is now. They have a chalkboard of desserts which are always worth getting in my book... they're $4 or 5 now... some great fantastic stuff can be found sometimes on the dessert chalkboard.  i always try to save room, and if i don't have room i annoy them by asking for it to go. My favorite thing on the printed menu are the corn cakes with bbq pork and dill pickles (you HAVE to eat it with the pickles at the same time for the full experience!), which comes with a potato choice as well.  And it's $8.  Though my friends ordered that last time we were there and weren't crazy about it... it used to be pulled pork, and it was better then.. now it's chopped pork...  I still like. They have art on the walls that rotates monthly or every few weeks with local artists selling their work. That said, it is a bit funky and you have to have expectations before you go.... it's very artsy/bohemian feeling...  Your mom might have a heart attack if she has to use the bathroom, which you access by walking into the kitchen.  And occasionally I'm not crazzzy what i get, maybe 1 out of 5 meals will be a slight miss for me, but given the price I still find it to be a great place.  Sometimes the people:server ratio isn't quite what it should be, like if there's only the guy or girl working the whole restaurant, but even so it's reasonably fast, yet if you're ""new"" you might feel like you were getting rude service maybe.  My friend held a birthday party of about 20 people here though, and it was just the guy working, and he did a pretty great job keeping everyone in the restaurant happy.. They do brunch as well as dinner... personally I think their brunch is quite good and I go there once in awhile for it, but the dinner is a mile ahead of brunch.  If you want the standout experience go for dinner, not brunch...  (though on their new brunch menu they have corncake pancakes with bacon and a maple butter that is pretty tastey...

Then we sat and waited for a server to dignify us for 10 minutes. Nothing. We tried to flag someone down. No luck. This little game of ""catch the waitress"" went on for another 10 minutes until a cranky woman came to our table, folded her arms, and rasped out something along the lines of, ""What  do you want?"" At that point my friends and I realized that the rude and insulting behavior of the staff was not a sign of their ignorance and venality but of ours. Why? Because we forgot that it is the inalienable right of every hole-in-the-wall cafe proprietor to choose their own customers. Worse, after failing to meet the rigid hipster criteria of the Bite-worthy, we actually had the gall to remain seated and act a bit surprised.  So that's it for Bite.

But Bite, the caf attached to the Empty Bottle, one of the best music venues in the city, has amazing food and a ton of character. No matter if I'm stopping in for brunch or dinner, there's always some inventive specialty of the day scribbled on the chalkboard. I love that even though the basic menu changes every few months, I can always find something to eat. In fact, everyone I know can find something to eat here, whether they're a hardcore vegetarian (such as myself) or the most devoted flesh eater. Even a basic veggie burger here takes on new life with a side of delicious mashed sweet potatoes and yummy toppings you can add for $.75 each.  But what I really love about Bite is that it's remained practically unchanged for the past five years. I love that the staff is friendly, but not sugary sweet and fake. I love that it's still sort of an artsy, neighborhood spot. The menus are constantly falling apart, if the staff plays music it's always random, funny and maybe even a bit ironic AND you can BYOB or use that nifty little connecting door and get drinks from the bar at the Empty Bottle.  The only thing that could make Bite better is if they started serving all the delicious sandwiches and veggie chili from Leo's (r.i.p.). Oh, and in case you didn't know, I believe the same lady who started Leo's and Bite is also behind Feed, which I've also only heard good things about.

I don't mind waiting in the bar (Empty Bottle) next door for some grub here ... mostly because it's always fresh, filling, and is almost like a trendy/gourmet/casual/hip type joint. It's quite small, but the intimate nature of the seating doesn't take away from the experience. You can see the cooks busy at work in the kitchen through an uncovered doorway, and while it might seem tacky, it adds to the petite, casual nature of the dining experience. I recommend Bite for brunch. The challah french toast is divine and the breakfast potatoes are always cooked to perfection. Don't forget to look at the specials board, though, as my boyfriend and I almost did a few weeks ago. On one adventure there was strawberry cream cheese stuffed french toast, which was probably the most delicious breakfast food I'd had in eons. There's veggie options and always a bounty of desserts to choose from. The regular menu is ever-changing, and the specials menu carries edible treats, as well as drinks (I had watermelon lemonade this past weekend -- it was delish and fresh!).  My only gripe might be that the orange juice is never enough (the small is almost a kiddie-size cup) and the servers aren't always the friendliest.

Other things, such as the sandwiches, seem to me a little mediocre, and on some days more mediocre than others.

The food was hit or miss. The omelette I had was just not good. I have made similar tasting things in the microwave at home. It did come with great home fries and a thick slice of wheat toast though. The breakfast quesadilla was much better and the cornbread french toast with blueberries and cinnamon butter rocked. Loved it. There was only one guy in there taking care of every table and he really busted his ass because we didn't have to wait or ask for anything. He was really friendly and attentive, so I have no complaints about the service.  I kinda feel bad not giving Bite a better rating, but that omelette really sucked.",-0.0072,0.783,0.108,0.108,0.5123015873015873

I'd strongly suggest checking out their brunch - you can pick among many tasty entrees and get your choice of drink for $8 plus tip, which is a bargain considering the rising prices of wicker park. Bite is vegan/vegetarian friendly, yet you can still find tasty meat or meat-like dishes that'll satisfy the best carnivores of you out there.  To top it off you've got awesome artwork that's both unique and tasteful. Check em out, you wont regret it!",0.9886,0.724,0.276,0.0,0.6033333333333333

In my experience (albeit I haven't been in a year or two) there were 2 waiters a blonde girl who was a bitch and a curly-haired guy who was a flake. They take you order, bring you your food, and then drop off the check without ever looking back. I've had meals here before where everyone didn't start out with a glass of water and, even after repeated reminders, never received one before the meals end. That said, OBVIOUSLY refills are out of the question.  Go to Flying Saucer instead. the food's not as good, but the waitstaff isn't lazy assholes.",0.81,0.869,0.088,0.043,0.61

For at least a half dozen years it's been a consistently great little restaurant, offering excellent brunch with interesting weekly specials. This time I tried the sweet potato hash with veggies and eggs, and I was slightly disappointed. I expected the hash to be someone browned and seasoned, but it wasn't. However, that's the first misstep I've experienced in years. Dinners are very good, often with a slight soul food twist, from simple sandwiches and burgers to fish specials. Prices may float up to $12, but since it's BYOB, it's the best value you can find for a good meal near the Empty Bottle compared to the overpriced restaurants on Division.",0.9705,0.78,0.182,0.038,0.5049433106575965

Their basic menu includes salads, sandwiches, pastas. The veggie burrito is fab. Their specials change daily, which is why I am a regular. They always have a special meat, fish, poultry, and vegetarian dish, and it is usually $12 or less. The portions are very healthy and the dishes are very creatively prepared. The brunch is good, too.
