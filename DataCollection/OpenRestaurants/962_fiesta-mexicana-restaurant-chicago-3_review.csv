To keep the party vibe going, my husband and I shared a 1/2 pitcher of margarita that was only 17 dollars! Plenty of margaritas came out of that pitcher. It was worth it. Food was delicious too-- I ordered the Red Snapper in a garlic and onion sauce and my husband had the ""Carne Asada"". Our plates were HUUUUGE!

This place is open pretty late (2 or 3 am I think), so it was an appealing place for those of us looking for some snacks and drinks.  First thing I have to tell you is that you should NEVER try the margarita's here. I had the basic lime one and it tasted like I was drinking lime flavored kitchen cleaner. I am well aware that many restaurants use pre made mixes for the base of their margarita's, but they really need to switch brands here. Even the Jose Cuervo margarita mixes I used to drink in college tasted better then whatever is used in the margarita's at this restaurant.  I asked the waiter to take it off of my bill, and I was thankful that he did. The margarita was totally undrinkable, and it was literally the worst margarita I've ever had.  Many of the people at my table had tacos, and most people said that the meat was bland. The person next to me said that the tortilla was slightly chewy.  I had one of their tamales, and it wasn't bad, but also not memorable either.  The prices for most items on the menu were priced a little high for the quality of the ingredients.",0.8984,0.891,0.086,0.024,0.5272984126984127

The beans and rice were very good and the Carne asada was EXCELLENT. Others in the group enjoyed the chicken flautas, empanadas, and the chimichanga. The only thing that no one really loved was the tamale. 3. Pricing/ value for everything was very reasonable. Nothing was out of line. The Carne asada was a little more than what we wanted to spend but it was worth every penny. 4. After dinner small shot for the adults was a nice and unexpected touch. Also enjoyalble.

2015-06-12,2.0,"The plan dinner, Mexican was the choice of food. A friend suggested this place and so we met up. First, off kudos to the staff they're friendly and eager to serve you. My meal was a disaster from the queso fondito and my lack luster fish taco dinner. The chips can use some work but that salsa is really good. As an appetizer I ordered to queso fondito it was greasy with no flavor and the cheese was really gummy like instead of bubbling and melty (foodie lingo) The Mexican egg rolls were interesting. A fusion of Mexican flavor and Asian design. Take something we are all familiar with and do a spin on it, very nice.  I ordered the fish tacos I love sea food and I saw some pix on yelp of the tacos. The presentation was nice and colorful but as picturois it was flavorful it was not. I took one bit and immediately thought someone unthawed fish sticks and served them in a warm corn tortilla. I notified my server he replied a lot of people like the fish tacos. My response was I guess I don't fall into that category. Then the server told me then it would be thrown in the garbage I assume that is where all horrible meals go to end. So I ordered two steak tacos figure if this doesn't get it there is no hope for this place.  The steak tacos come out finally a thumbs up. It was good but being from the westside and little village area there is definitely better Mexican food in the city. My companion order was wrong and we were given someone elses bill. I think she enjoyed her meal and that is something to be grateful. My next Mexican exploration will be south of the border of Uptown. Adios",0.9937,0.756,0.19,0.054,0.45733333333333337

2015-05-26,5.0,"Everyone loves Mexican cuisine. What's the point of going to Taco Bell, Chipotle, or Taco Burrito King if you can get great food at Fiesta Mexicana on Lawrence and Broadway?! One of my friends, Rosie, recommended me this restaurant because we had a conversation about where I can get good authentic Mexican food as well as good margaritas. My boyfriend and I decided to go there and see if what she was saying was true. Kris and I decided to judge this place based on food, beverages, the décor, and how well we were taken care of by the staff. After our experience we decided that it was very close to perfect and this is why. We went to Fiesta Mexicana last Saturday for lunch, and we were both starving since we didn't have breakfast. We walked over there because the weather was nice and once we got there we noticed that they had a little outside sitting area which was really cute. It was a little windy outside so we decided to sit inside anyway. The inside of the restaurant felt really homey. There are a lot of warm colors and there are a lot of decorations but everything blends in perfectly together to make the customers feel comfortable. The tables are not really close to each other even though the restaurant isn't big. The overall look of the restaurant is very appealing and once you walk in you know that you're in a Mexican restaurant and you expect the food to be good.  When we walked inside we were greeted by most of the staff with smiles on their faces and they let us sit wherever we wanted which we really liked. Once we sat down a nice men brought us some chips and warm spicy salsa which was delicious, and filled our glasses with ice water. Throughout our visit there when we didn't have any more chips and salsa he would walk over to our table and ask if we wanted more. After he left, our waitress came by and gave us our menus and few minutes to decide what we wanted to eat. Throughout our whole experience there she would always make sure that we were enjoying ourselves. The great thing was that she wouldn't come over every few minutes and bother us; she knew exactly when was the perfect moment to walk over to our table and ask how we were doing.  Like I said before, after we got our menus, our waitress gave us some time to decide what we wanted to eat. She came back after few minutes and for starters we ordered Mexican Egg Rolls and I ordered Margarita Con Sabor which was mango flavored and Kris ordered Margarita De La Casa. Our margaritas were served really fast and we had time to decide what we wanted for our main course while we waited for the appetizer. This is where the issue was. We waited for the appetizer and to order our main course for almost thirty minutes. While we waited for the appetizer to come, our waitress quickly came over and apologized for the wait; we just wished she would have taken our order while we were still waiting for our egg rolls. We finally got to order our main courses which were Enchiladas with pork for Kris and Chimichanga with chicken for me.  At the end the appetizer was worth the wait because it was really delicious! There were three big egg rolls cut in half with a lot of guacamole, salad, and pico de gallo.  They were really filling and extremely delicious. We waited for our main courses for a short period of time comparing to how long we had to wait for the appetizer. Both of our dishes were extremely delicious. My Chimichanga was perfectly fried and Kris' Enchiladas were perfectly cooked. We had to take most of our food to go because the Mexican Egg Rolls were extremely filling. We asked our waitress for two boxes and a check. First she brought us two boxes so we can pack our food and then she went to get our check. When she brought our check she also brought two complimentary shots of Kahlua with cream which once again were so delicious. She also apologized once again for the appetizer being late. At the end I left Fiesta Mexicana very satisfied, extremely full, and in a really good mood. The food was amazing, the drinks were great, the atmosphere felt homey, and we were treated with respect. So the overall experience was amazing even though we waited for our appetizer for a long time. I recommend this place to everyone who enjoys good Mexican cuisine and homey atmosphere.

2015-02-09,3.0,"A Neighborhood Favorite for Authentic Mexican Fare- Fiesta Mexicana is a nice little dive for authentic sit down Mexican fare. The service is usually fairly quick, polite, and accurate and the food is good and authentic. The standouts here are the Queso Fundito, a warm gooey salty, mess of melted cheese that's as drool-worthy as it is heart clogging every night of the week, and the post dinner complimentary digestive shot if you dine in and order drinks. That last bit adds a bit of charm and fun to a meal out with friends.  The single major gripe with this little quaint uptown dinning spot is the price of certain dishes, if you aren't careful, dinner for even one can swell over $15 for a single person. In addition, this writer thinks of their rice and bean side dishes as ""plain/bordering on flavorless"" which reduce the overall value of this place as a quick easy meal.  That said, the portion sizes, for everything but their nachos tend towards the ""too much food for one sitting"" side of plentiful, especially if you order an appetizer and drinks.  If you're feeling like a margarita, they have a decent mix with some flavor options that come served in a nice earthen ware jug for a bit of authentic in your fiesta.  Aside from the aforementioned queso fundido, and post dinner shot, there isn't a whole lot to go out of your way for. If you are near uptown for jazz at the Green Mill two doors down, or hitting a concert at The Riv or Aragon, or even just craving good authentic Mexican for dinner, go for it, otherwise, don't go far out of your way for this place.",0.9838,0.857,0.133,0.01,0.5000694444444443

They added hot sauce and guacamole on the side. The amount of grease that was in this order was absolutely appalling. See my photo I added if you don't believe me. The soup had melted cheese in the bottom and the only vegetables were potatoes and carrots. The veggies were cut so large I had to cut them to eat them. The cheese and avocado should have been placed on the side. The soup was rather, eh, kind of bland. Also, there was NO CHICKEN in the soup.  The Mexican egg rolls were the only thing worth offering. However, even these were terribly soggy and had absolutely no crunch.  I would NOT RECOMMEND this place to anyone.

Maybe this was my punishment for only ordering water.  I can't believe that, when the only other customers seemed to be (possibly drunk) homeless people getting carry out, the server actually gave me attitude for this transgression.

The most surprising thing about Fiesta Mexicana was how courteous and attentive the staff was. Even though the restaurant was jam packed, we were brought chips, salsa, and water immediately after being seated, our waited checked on us throughout the night, frequently refilling our water glasses, and our check was brought promptly after we were finished eating. I had the enchiladas tres colores and was pleasant surprised by the combination of sauces (especially the tomatillo sauce.) The rice and beans were also excellent. I can see why some people might complain about the food being bland, the flavors were definitely understated (aside from the salsa, which was spicier than I'm used to), so if you prefer spicier dishes, you may be disappointed.

I suppose it can be if you prey on the drunken and hungry late-nighters who have nowhere else to go. Unfortunately we became the prey and decided to pay the price.  Nearly eleven bucks for a basic chimichanga with a small scoop of bland rice, re-refried beans with a dab of guacamole and lettuce on the side. It tasted like, maybe, 6 bucks.

I don't really have much to say about this place.  I mean, it is standard Mexican fare, cheesy decor, etc., but what I really need to tell you about is an apparent addition to the menu, which is the Azteca Tortilla Soup.  Hot Damn!  This is the best soup ever!  Slices of avocado, tons of cilantro, crispy tortilla strips and a huge scoop of sour cream.. I was bowled (ha..see what I did there! :-P ) over with how good it was.  Folks, it is a good thing that there is a concealed carry law in Chicago, because otherwise I would've held this joint up to get that recipe.  I also had a beef taco and a tamale, both of which were really not so good but I am willing to overlook that based on how good that soup was. I also had a margarita on the rocks.  The drink was filled with ice and I could see the condensation on the glass but it never tasted cold.  I'm no scientist but I am assuming this has something to do with the alcohol content?  Either way, I got a good buzz which is what I was going for.  Like my father says, ""It doesn't matter when you are drinking for effect.""  I love that man.

2009-06-16,1.0,"Last night at Fiesta Mexicana, we experienced some of the worst service I've experienced at a restaurant in awhile. There are too many good Mexican restaurants nearby to tolerate bad (and rude!) service. Basically, we walked into the restaurant and asked if we could sit outside. A server said that we could, if a table was available. We said there was a table available, but that it needed to be bused/cleaned. He said he would ""try"" to send someone out. We sat out there for approximately 5 minutes. When someone finally came to bus the table, he didn't greet us, and just cleared the dishes (with our help!). He didn't even wipe the table off, or give us menus. Then we waited for another 10 minutes or so, and watched the server we had talked to when we entered come out and check on other tables, though he still did not even stop by our table to give us menus or take drink orders. Totally unacceptable. We got the impression that since it was close to 9pm on a Monday night, maybe they were intentionally ignoring us, so that we would leave? Well, we did leave. We'll never go back there. And, I'm posting this negative review on Yelp. I hope they got what they wanted. Don't waste your time with this place, people.

There's never a wait (at least when we go), and they pretty much stay open until people decide to leave. We've been there until after midnight some nights. Now the reason I put 4 stars vs 5 is because we order the exact same thing every time. We get a pitcher of regular margaritas on the rocks, enchiladas with verde sauce (I get chorizo and one cheese), and the guacamole appetizer. Their enchiladas are amazing, their margaritas very strong, and the guac is spectacular and enormous. And at the end of every meal, you get a complimentary shot of Kahlua and cream. I have no idea how their other food is because I admit once I discovered the enchiladas I haven't strayed. My boyfriend says that the burrito is not his favorite, so it may not have the best food in Chicago, but it is quite fantastic as a neighborhood spot to hang out, have a drink (or few) and have a great time in a low-key place (plus the music videos they play are HILARIOUS).",0.9719,0.833,0.142,0.024,0.6150116550116551

It's not clear who you're supposed to talk to for seating, or if you can seat yourself (you can't). Last time I was there we stood around by the door for several minutes before an employee appeared (from outside, oddly) to seat us. But after that our party of 5 was seated quickly. The service is average, or maybe a little above. Water glasses were refilled regularly which is a big thing for me. What? I'm hydrophilic, OK? Nothing is worse than biting into a steaming hot and/or spicy piece of food, only to realize there is nothing but a couple of ice cubes in your glass, trying to look inconspicuous. But I digress. The food is pretty good here as well. The pechuga de pollo was tasty, but not the best I've had. Their fajitas are HUGE. I mean, HUGE. I'm not sure about the restaurant's policy on sharing them, but they could feed two average people. They are a bit juicer than what you find at most places (as in liquid in the skillet) but they are flavorful. And unlike some places I can think of (I'm looking at you, Uncle Julio's) they are generous with veggies, specifically peppers, onions & tomatoes. Prices can be a bit on the high side for non-fancy Mexican food, but again..the portions are quite generous. I haven't partaken, but they have reasonably priced margarita pitchers that my friends seem to enjoy. Also, as a special thank you for dining with them, they bring you a little complimentary shot of Kahlua & cream to wash down your meal.

My girlfriend and I had never been to this Fiesta Mexicana, but she said that she knew many people from nearby businesses who frequent the restaurant. So, we decided it looked cute and we should give it a try. We walked in and waited inline at the entrance, which means we were standing in the full dining room. We discussed just going and dining at the bar since there was room there, but figured the wait would not hurt. We were in no hurry. An employee of the restaurant cleared a table, walked over to us and guided us to the table.We sat down(like normal people do when they are sat at a restaurant.) Within second a male server abruptly came over to our table and interrupted our just settling conversation. He informed us that we could not just seat ourselves. When we tried to explain that we had been sat by an employee of the restaurant, he countered by telling us that others were ahead of us waiting at the bar for a table and from what he saw, we had sat oursleves. Now either this man is legally blind or the two of us were simultaneously hallucinating. He continued to inform us that there are rules at this place and that we would need to get up and wait our turn. We were shocked by this neandrothal's demeanor. In all of the years that I worked waiting tables to put myself through college, I had never seen customer service as inexcusable as this. i understand exactly what his job entails and we had not been rude or insubordinate in any manner. We got up and took our place back at the door, but were so repulsed that we chose not to stay. We got some air and returned to notify the manager of the employee's lack of skills in the field in which he was working. The manager feined concern, and told us that there had been people waiting at the bar, which was irrelevent at this point. Her staff had seated us. We are not psychic. We were not aware that other people were waiting for a table. It is not our job as guests at a restaurant to view the waiting list, organize a seating chart and communicate with our co-workers.

They put that on top of two warm corn tortillas with pico de gallo and guacamole. For about $3 it's the perfect small lunch or afternoon snack. I say go for the carnitas taco and leave the rest!",0.9473,0.824,0.164,0.011,0.5

2008-05-10,5.0,This is the Fiesta Mexicana to go to for the Guanchinango Veracruzana (deep fried snapper in a tomato based sauce).  Did you ever see those old Tom & Jerry cartoons where they put a fish in their mouth & in one fail swoop all that's left is bones?  That's what this dish looks like after I'm done with it.  Have it with the corn tortillas & a ptcher of margaritas from a rooster pitcher.  FOR SURE my favorite fish dish anywhere in Chicago.,0.7983,0.824,0.135,0.041,0.4648148148148148
2008-03-18,5.0,"I love this place, after switching to vegetarian diet, i only miss a few dishes and the mixed fajitas at Fiesta top the list.  They are the best in the city.  That being said, I still gorge on the vegi fajitas, the great rice and beans, and the fresh tasty guac. The chips and salsa are superb.  Fiesta does what so many eateries are afraid of, adding heat to ""spicy"" food.  The salsa is hot just like any respectable salsa should be and we love it.  An authentic Mexican meal with homemade tortilla chips, hot salsa, fresh guacamole, margaritas, and some late night Jazz next door (Green Mill) = perfect night.",0.9911,0.676,0.312,0.012,0.5613636363636364
2008-02-24,3.0,"Not the best Mexican I've had, not the worst. It fit the bill, as it was the first place we ran across after finding a parking spot. Famished, we settled for the...ahem...beautiful interior at Fiesta Mexicana! It's pretty kitschy Tex/Mex ambience. Lots of fake flowers, some very large murals...clean enough, etc.  The food was a bit pricey, and greasy. I mean $11 for a burrito seems steep to me with all the other joints in the 'hood. It was covered with some sort of drenching suace which made it impossible to pick up and eat...ya know, if I don't have to use utensils, I'm happy, but oh well ;)  Rice was super dry and wow, if I had a problem with my food groups all touching each other...this plate would've sent me into shock. Probably good for some late night grub, or large pitchers of margaritas for the local crowd. Waiter was polite and helpful and our food was lightening fast...",0.9758,0.758,0.193,0.049,0.615139751552795

Some friends and I went a few times after rehearsal at the Uptown Writers Space above the Green Mill. Decent good food and pretty quick.  Margarita pitchers are HUGE. It's almost a chore trying to finish these off between three people. Definitely take public transportation if you plan on ordering a pitcher.",0.977,0.72,0.28,0.0,0.4410256410256411
2007-07-13,1.0,"First of all, I'm huge!  Not just in size but mentality.  I like to eat.  And what I like to eat most...Mexican Food! My colombian partner and I have sought out some of the finest mexican food from Phoenix, Arizona to Nashville, TN.  And let me say that Chicago wouldn't know what to do with REALLY good Mexican food.   We have attempted Fiesta Mexicana TWICE now because we were desperate.  However, the food is bland, the chips are as thick as cardboard, and the food ALL tastes the same.  The guacamole is FULL of avocado...but NO TASTE?  Maybe I'm spoiled, no, OBVIOUSLY I'm spoiled because I have yet to find a good Mexican place in Chicago.  People should talk more here, lose the passive-aggressive demeanor and maybe there would be more community, better food, and places to go besides just the pretentious bars!  I thought this place must be a front, but it sounds (from other reviews) like its just the only place to go in uptown when you're too drunk to care.

2007-05-14,3.0,Reliable and tasty. A pitcher of margaritas between two will knock your socks off...On Tuesdays (I think...but maybe not) the pitchers are 15 dollars. I don't consider myself an expert on true Mexican cuisine but I find their chille relleno quite tasty. Their salsa's got a bit of kick to it.

I feel like I can make a good mexican fiesta in my home. Its also quite pricey, and the portions are not huge. For mexican, I recommend looking elsewhere for Mexican food and frequenting thai or vietnamese when in uptown.",-0.4981,0.682,0.126,0.192,0.5625

2006-12-30,4.0,"This place has a huge menu of pretty authentic Mexican food.  I've always had really quick service here--last time we were running late for a show at the Green Mill and we weren't sure if we'd have time to grab a bite on the way.  Then I remembered Fiesta...We plopped down at the bar, and almost immediately in front of us were chips & salsa, two plates of food and a half pitcher of margaritas.  We were in and out of there in under 30 minutes.  Plus, the bartender even gave us free shots of...something.  Not sure what it was, but it was tasty.  This place can get pretty crowded sometimes and it's pretty tiny, so it's probably not the best for groups.  I'd suggest the one on Lincoln if you have a crowd to feed.",0.7897,0.846,0.101,0.053,0.6177083333333333
2006-11-02,2.0,"normally i'd agree with the other reviews. the service is a little slow & the food a little pricey but pretty tasty. used to stop in when in the neighborhood. yep-used to. the last time i went there, the place was nearly empty so i'd figured i'd be in & out. told the busboy i was in a bit of a hurry & can i just give him my order. he said he'll get the waiter. no biggie, i just started thumbing through the reader i grabbed at the bookstore a couple doors north. after about ten min.'s, i looked up to see a waiter & a waitress (the one with the attitude-don't get me statred on her) sitting & eating at the counter. here comes the busboy again. i politely asked him to just please put in the order for me or get someone. he gave me a pissy traffic cop stop sign with his hand. so i was in & out faster than i thought, just hungrier. next time i have AMPLE  time & in the mood for the occasional attitude i might go back.",0.5113,0.867,0.073,0.06,0.3430555555555556
