I don't know why I feel that way, but I do, so deal.  The drinks were delicious. I did order one that was supposed to be in the Manhattan family (will update review when I remember the name), but I didn't like it, not unlike Manhattans. Those are usually pretty decent. I then went on to order an Old Fashioned (or two), and it was delicious! I'll be back here for a good drink soon.  My favorite part of the night was, well, my friend, of course - she's awesome! - but the bartender, too, was kinda remarkable. Kind. Fast. Mysterious. Talented. Sense of humor.  Check this place out! It's especially fun going with someone who hasn't gone before. I love hearing everyone's reactions to the place and its drinks/staff.  Pricey. Don't go out if you can't afford to take a cab.

They serve light bites that look delicious and serve very high end craft cocktails. They are very comfy highend high backed chairs, you almost feel like you are in a meeting for world domination. These craft drinks are very carefully thought out and crafted. Perfect for pre and post dinner drinks. I wouldn't say that this is a place for to get scummy with your college buds but I would say that this is a business crowd and very chill.

Nothing major that I didn't like about this place however, I did feel like the ""speak easy"" concept wasn't executed as well as it is at places like PDT and Back Room are in NYC, I wonder if they could build out a basement or back door here to add some intrigue? It would be nice to see more local liquors on the menu too and helpful to list out a mini-glossary on the back of the menu or something of all the different ingredients so you could avoid having to ask your server or bartender about the details of what's in the drinks and what their flavor profile is when they are busy.   The Malin + Goetz hand soaps in the bathroom were a nice touch too if you care about stuff like that.

2017-07-01,3.0,"The Violet Hour is so hilariously pretentious--if you go please don't take yourself too seriously. Once you enter through the ""secret"" doorway, which is not so secret when there are people loitering around outside, ""disguised"" by the mural (the art is legitimately cool though!), you will face the seemingly intimidating sign with stipulations including no cell phones and classy dress. This code of conduct might actually elevate the place if they stuck to it, but the fact that any dirty sandal-sporting, backpack-wearing, twenty-something-year-old i.e. my people can walk right in sorely undermines the drama and allure they are trying to emit.  Once you are granted access to enter, you may stumble in the darkness, through layers of heavy curtains and over oddly shaped mismatched chairs, to your booth. There is a large binder catalog of drinks, as well as a sheet of current seasonal concoctions available. After each of us relayed our choice to our waiter, he would reliably embark on a mini monologue praising our decision and how such and such liquor was amazing, the history of the drink, the history of the world, etc. Okay, perhaps I am exaggerating a little, but it was like, *eye-roll* continuously.  I'm not an alcohol connoisseur, but my friends deemed their drinks high quality and I enjoyed my dark and stormy. It didn't seem that strong, rather dominantly tangy and gingery in flavor. The wide variety of cup and ice cube shapes are fun. Given my snarky description, you might think my recommendation would be to never come here, but on the contrary I think it's a fun experience (at least once). The Violet Hour is like a parody of itself! Not so much priceless entertainment as each drink will run you ~$15, but it's good amusement.

But expect the unexpected when you walk into this swanky bar in the heart of Wicker Park.  Once inside, you'll think you've stumbled into a place fit for Bruce Wayne- The elegant interior is decorated with high-backed leather chairs, long velvet drapes, a fireplace, crystal chandeliers, and small tables lit by candlelight. It creates a hushed tone of awe amongst the newbies.  You'll lighten up as soon as you see the seasonally created list of cocktails and spirits.

First visit: This location was a bit hard to find since there isn't much to indicate that there is an entrance carved into the wooden wall when we were hunting for it. We went on a Tuesday night. During busier times there is a sign and a line. Getting inside though felt awesome as ifcwevwere entering a secret place. Got seated at the bar. I ordered the Briar Batch, and friend ordered the the strawberry cocktail and later the Briar Batch. Our bartender thus night made both those drinks strong! We had both eaten right before at Kixuki ramen; in spite of being all carbed up, our drinks packed quite the punch. Definitely made plans to come back soon.  Second visit: Came Saturday evening. We had to wait in line. We were again seated at the bar. Our bartender was different this time. I was hungry so orders the Cheeseburger Sliders (2) and the Medianoche (one whole sandwich cut in 3 pieces). We both ordered the Briar Patch, really looking forward to the same experience. Unfortunately, this time was definitely watery with no punch. :( We didn't order another drink. By then the food came and wow, the cheeseburger was tasty in its simplicity. The ground beef was wonderfully flavored; it had this smoky chat complemented by the bun, cheese, and pickle. The absolute highlight was the Medianoche. The pork, ham, and Swiss cheese between the toasted sweet bread was divine. The four saved the night after the disappointing and inconsistent Briar's Patch.  I would like to try again.

2017-03-25,5.0,"The Violet Hour is a hidden ""speakeasy-style"" bar that was a must hit up spot while visiting Chicago. My friends and I went on St. Patrick's day (Friday), around 9:30pm and luckily, we only had to wait about 25 minutes to get in! There are no obvious signs with the name of the bar, only a large mural that changes frequently and a long line next to it. When you enter, it's such a mysterious place, you have to pass through two sets of heavy curtains and then the place appears as a classy and intimate area with tall throne-like seats around candle lit tables. We were on a mission that night to try absinthe since this was one of the only places that we had heard of that sells the traditional drink. It was quite the experience indeed; they serve it to you in fancy glasses with probably half a shot of the actual liquor in it, you place a slotted spoon on top that balances a sugar cube, and on top of that, you place a slow water dispensing contraption that dissolves the sugar and turns the absinthe milky. The taste wasn't personally that great to me, since it was very herbaceous and licorice-y, but I think you'll enjoy the taste if you like gin (like my friend did). With that being said, it was like 5 drinks in one due to its ultra high proof (ours was 90 and 130 proof-$13 and $15) and we all felt great by the end of the night, so I would say it was more bang for your buck. This place also served many appetizers that ranged from $7-$12 and they were so amazing. I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend the waffle fries, which were tossed in a roasted garlic butter and served with a creamy bleu cheese sauce...they were the best fries I have ever tried.

My friends and I were visiting Chicago and we had to stop by due to all the amazing things we've heard and all the reviews we had read. It was St. Patty's day and we came around 10 pm. The line was about 25 minutes (which wasn't too bad). When you get to the front of the line a bouncer asks you how many are in your party and then takes you to a dark corridor. Next thing you know, YOU'RE IN. I'm not going to describe what it looks like inside because that's for you to find out, but it's definitely quite a sight to see ;D  Absinthe: 5/5 My friends and I tried absinthe for the very first time. If you ever get the chance, TRY IT. It's an experience like no other (in a good way). Depending on which absinthe drink you get it ranges from $13-$15. You first are given about 1/4 glass of absinthe, a cup filled with water, a small flat spoon, sugar cubes, and a balance. Since the proof is so high, you can't drink it by itself. So, you have to put the flat spoon on top of the cup with a sugar cube on it and then you put the balance on top. You then pour about 3/4 of the water into the balance and the balance teeter-totters back and forth until the sugar cube melts and all the water is dispersed into the cup with the absinthe. To be honest, the taste was not so great. But, the experience of drinking it and the after-effects were awesome! It's definitely something to try once in your lifetime. The Food: 5/5 Easily the best food I have had in a lounge!!! You absolutely have to try their waffle fries!!! I would honestly fly to Chicago just to have some because they were that great. They are tossed in butter and they have a melted cheese dipping sauce, it's like heaven in your mouth. Also, we tried their sliders and those were pretty great, but unfortunately they only come with 2 sliders. The food menu ranged from $6-$15 and although I didn't have the chance to try anything else, I'm sure the rest of their food is amazing. The Service: 4/5 Our waitresses were really good and on top of our orders, but the service in the kitchen took a really long time. On our last order of the waffle fries it took them about 45 minutes to deliver them out to us. The waitresses were very friendly, especially the one that helped us with the absinthe. She patiently explained the process to us and asked if we had any questions.  Overall: If you ever go to Chicago or if you live there already, go to the Violet Hour.

I normally don't like gin drinks, but this really transformed it and demonstrated the skill of the bartenders. To be fair, I'm not wowed by all of their drinks; in fact many of them seemed fairly similar to what I've had at other cocktail bars.

Respect and classiness are key virtues here as evident in one of there house rules stating ""please do not bring anyone to The Violet Hour that you wouldn't bring to your mother's house for Sunday dinner.""  The drinks are insanely good. I had my fair share of cocktails in Chicago and this place had far and away the best cocktails. If you have a group of friends, I highly suggest you share their signature punch bowls. During our visit, their Punch No. 5 with bourbon was available and it hit the spot. It had a mild sweetness but a perfect kick that will get you feeling all sorts of good once you finish the bowl. They state the punch bowl serves 5-7 people... ha... nice joke. We easily beasted through that with 3 people and probably could've done it with just 2. Get the PUNCH BOWL!!! I ordered a few cocktails after that as well. The Pajama Boy was incredible. It is basically a stirred cocktail that is a mix between an old fashioned and a Manhattan with a hints of fruitiness. Delicious. I also got the Pliny's Cup which was shaken. The taste was impeccable and I loved this drink as well.  The bartenders were AMAZING. It was great that we got to sit by the bar because you get to interact with them.

ONE DRINK on an empty stomach left me drunk and talking nonstop as I tend to do when drunk.  Staff was very kind and courteous, not what you would expect from an establishment with a list of rules and a line.  I expected pretentiousness which is NEVER OK.  I was very impressed by the cocktails, I just LOVE to choose and decide which unique craft cocktail I will try.  The inside was lovely, dim, and sophisticated.  The only bad part, though no fault of their own of course, is that line.  How can anyone be a regular or semi regular there with that omnipresent line?  That is too bad and it's no wonder this place is so popular because the world needs more bars like this and less of the rowdy, bro/college kid/too young joints.",0.9849,0.738,0.185,0.077,0.6026418026418026

I happened to be by on a Friday night and the doorman let me know that the line can be pretty unpredictable at times--sometimes it'll be short and you only have to wait 10 minutes, other times you might be waiting about an hour to be escorted inside. When I first stopped by around 6:30pm there was no line (seriously, I walked right by the hidden entrance at first, hint--it's right along a long black wall), but when I returned around 9pm, the line was on the longer side.  Once my friend and I were selected to come inside (and it really feels like you're special--you were chosen!), we were seated right at the bar--my preferred place to sit in true cocktail bars because I love watching the mixologists at work. They're constantly rotating their cocktail menu, it's typically divided into two sections--Shaken and Stirred. Cocktails are around $13 each, and while they're pricey, most are quite boozy so you're getting some bang for your buck.

If this was a blind date that might be super awkward standing in line for 30 minutes...  Anyways, walking inside I didn't know what to expect but I was impressed. I felt sort of like a king sitting in those seats!

I especially like the funny framed picture in the bathroom and appreciate malin + goetz products. The waitresses are always circling around so expect to never have your water empty and to get a new drink order in once you're done with it. I don't suggest getting any of the food honestly, this place is cocktail only. I ordered their sliders and for the price and taste it was not worth it. So make sure to eat before coming here there's a bunch of food places where you can grab a quick bite. The drinks thought were so good! They definitely have all different times of cocktails that can appeal to anybody. Whether you're more spirit forward or just want something fruity the waitresses can guide you through it all.

2016-11-06,2.0,"Upon arrival on a Thursday night, we entered to 6-8 people waiting in the entryway, and no staff. No one knew what to do so I entered to ask. The female hostess was uninviting, rude and condescending. I began trying to explain why I had entered, and she rudely cut me off and told me to go back out and wait. Once I got out, there was a nicer gentleman who was walking in from outside. He began shuttling people inside in parties.  #1- If you don't have staff greeting people at the door, and no signage, then don't expect them to just stand there waiting. You're establishment isn't that amazing or sought out; we have better things to do with our time than wait for you to find time to come let us into your establishment, which was virtually empty the night I went, yet you still had people outside waiting to get in like it was packed out or elitist.  #2- Your hostess should be canned and replaced with someone who knows something about customer service and how to be courteous and inviting to customers. If I weren't such a nice person, I would have told her so that night.  #3- Don't make people stand in the entryway waiting around to enter when you have plenty of open tables and seats inside.  #4- Your mixologist bartenders make great drinks, and provide great customer service, it's just too bad we had to encounter the female hostess before getting to them.  411 on the Drinks: They are about $15/cocktail. We sat at the bar and watched our drinks being made. The. Attendee was nice and was willing to make us custom cocktails with the liquor base we wanted and the flavors we wanted. Why order off the menu when you have talented mixologists working. :) I'm sure the menu is good as well. Five stars for the drinks.  411 on the Music: This isn't a club, yet they had the music pretty loud. So loud, in fact, that we had to lean in to hear each other. Sure, that's ""romantic"" when our make people sit on top of each other to hear, but the romance is lost when you can't hear each other.  411 on Service: Entry Man- Friendly, just wasn't there when I walked in. No one to greet us or explain their ridiculous waiting system. He was great when he walked in from outside.  Hostess woman? I have no idea her title. She was the one in the actual building, not the inside outer curtain. She was horribly rude and uninviting. Awful! Bartenders- Friendly and kind  *The ONLY reason I would go back would be for the drinks and mixologists there. The pretentiousness that the woman inside perpetuated turned me off. I don't know who she thought she was or why she thinks she can treat people like that. The outside looks like trash. The inside trashy ""holding chambers"" are ridiculous when they have so many empty seats available inside. For what you pay, you should get 1-  more friendly people, 2- better greeting, 3- A view, 4- Better customer service, 5- A better overall experience. Go elsewhere where you will be treated with respect, treated kindly, made to feel welcomed and not in some ghetto entry system.

One time my friend and I were in the area, and we came about 20 minutes before they opened (first in line, YAY!), and by the time 6pm rolled around, at least 15-20 people were behind us.   There are many cocktails to choose from at the Violet Hour, and the servers make picking a drink easier.  I've ordered from the regular menu, but I've also had them create a cocktail for me. One time I was craving a White Russian type cocktail, but there wasn't one like this on the menu at the time. The server went over the ingredients they had on hand to create a cocktail similar to a White Russian, and the drink was great ! They really can accommodate any drink tastes.

2016-10-05,5.0,"The Violet Hour provided one of the coolest cocktail experiences I've ever had. I had heard of Violet Hour in conversations about Chicago, but didn't really know what to expect before going there.  First, the door is hidden in plain view. It's basically just a door-shaped chunk of a wall it's in. The bar commissions a local artist to redesign the wall every few months and the door is camouflaged within the art. If you look closely you can see the outline when walking by. There are no reservations taken for the bar, so once you get there you must wait. If there are no available seats, you wait outside the door in a line for people to come out. I kinda like this because it helps to build a little bit of anticipation.  It's pretty dark inside and all tables are lit by candlelight, so it's got a swanky feel about it. There are a few ""House Rules"" to abide by. No cellphones usage allowed (Why I didnt get a picture of anything), no ""bombs,"" everyone needs proper attire. This helps keep the feel in there speakeasy-ish and classy. I'm a fan.  As for the drinks, there are quite a few specialty cocktails they have made up, as well as an extensive list of classics you can order. I wish I could remember what all was in the drink I ordered but I just know it was mezcal, was spicy, and was delicious. They can also whip you something up randomly if you want! The servers seem to have an excellent knowledge on the drinks they are serving, too. So if you go in there completely blind, they can lead you in the right direction if you tell them what you like. If you're looking for a fun spot to have a drink that's not loud, hot, and crowded, this is it!",0.9865,0.814,0.141,0.045,0.4483134920634921

Rather than organizing the drinks by spirit, they're now organized by vague categories, like shaken, stirred, and ""classics."" What's more, they no longer actually list all of the ingredients in the cocktails, instead giving impressionistic descriptions and analogies like a hip sommelier. Maybe I am being old fashioned, but I would just like you to tell me what you are putting in a glass, and let me decide whether it seems good, bad, or intriguing. On the plus side, if you go from 6-8 on weeknights, they have an absinthe service, which features a fabulous absinthe cocktail (the frappe), and a really really good french absinthe, complete with spider/spoon/sugar/water setup. The french absinthe we tried was so good we didn't really want to dilute it, but the Colorado absinthe was sort of vile, and we were grateful for the apparatus.

2016-08-25,5.0,"""The Big Bang Theory (not the TV show) is the constant expansion of the Universe starting from a point of singularity. If you were to extrapolate this theory to Chicago's vibrant bar scene The Violet Hour (VH) would be that point of singularity. Yes there were bars before VH and there might have even been some that actually used artesianal methods such as freshly squeezed juice-Matchbox perhaps-but it was VH that put Chicagoan's and the nation on blast that we could be more than just an Old Style and cheap whiskey drinking town. Once that was discovered cocktail bars have been popping up in droves. Lost Lake, GreenRiver, Mezcaleria Las Flores, Sparrow, Arbella etc. being the planets and stars of that ever-expanding universe, were all created by that one point of singularity. Who would have thunk that Chicagoans possessed a more sophisticated palate. VH became the playground for those that were looking to experiment and/or showoff these enhanced palates. VH is often described as a speakeasy, which is difficult to grasp considering speakeasys of the time were often small, cramped, dumpy shoeboxes with barely drinkable liquor. However VH is hidden behind a giant handcrafted mural, using local artists, and you wouldn't know it's there unless you know it's there. Additionally it's superdark inside so I guess this qualifies enough to keep the speakeasy trend going. Inside you are transported to a more pre-20's era Parisian style escape from all the huhbub of the close by Milwaukee-North-Damen intersection and the Big Star crowd. Once inside gigantic beautiful velvet curtains, super hi-back chairs, and chandeliers await your thirsty ambitions. Here well-crafted classics along with more progressive cocktails litter the menu. All fresh and top notch ingrediants are used. Currently late August 2016 their summer menu is broken into three columns. Shaken drinks, Stirred drinks, and notable VH Classics. I must say I am more of a stirred drinks kind of fly guy, however the ""Sterile Animal"" on the Shaken side was quite good. Highlighted by Leatherbee Gin and Rhubarb, it was almost a sour-y drink with a hint of sweetness. Not usually my kind of drink but I really did enjoy it. On the stirred side I tried ""Travails of the Swamp Thing"" which is a Bourbon drink similar to a Manhattan. Again, excellent but put-hair-on-your-chest strong. Never did try from their VH Classics, however I have been here a few times now and every drink has been spot on.  VH may be the point of singularity that sparked Chicago's cocktail revolution, but just like in the world of Quantum Physics where the moon and stars are studied but not the original point, VH often gets forgotten in Chicago's high stakes bar game. The new kids on the block with their themed style bars (Queen Mary) and bars with a spirit speciality ( Mezcaleria Las Flores) get all the accolades and attention. I'm telling you don't sleep on VH, the drinks still rival any bar this city has to offer with an interior that is awe-inspiring after all these years.",0.9718,0.885,0.081,0.035,0.51210101010101

I saw a guy in a t-shirt and shorts, which I'd not recommend, but obviously nobody with the business shamed him or refused him service, which is nice.

One of our party accidentally broke a glass and they quickly cleaned and bought out a new one without even being asked (not expected because it was clearly our fault).

Sure, there's a lot of hype around Violet Hour but it's worth it. These people are passionate about what they do, and they do it well. They are serious mixologists, but I love that it's approachable to the basic cocktail drinker as well. I took my mom and sister here when they were up to visit and neither of them are familiar with different types of cocktails. Our server walked us through what they could expect from the menu choices and made some great recommendations. I've been seated at the bar previously and really enjoyed watching the bartenders construct the works of art that they call cocktails. If you want to go and don't want to wait, it's best to get there right when they open. Within an hour or so, especially on a weekend night, there will be a line out the door. The atmosphere here can't be beat, with romantic, tall back chairs and dim lighting. Would highly recommend it for a date night or night out with girls. They also have an absinthe focused happy hour menu for weekdays, I believe 6pm-7pm.",0.9954,0.751,0.243,0.006,0.5575189786059351

We have lots of great places for specialty cocktails in my hometown of Louisville, KY...but no place like this. The drinks are absolutely amazing. I've never had something I didn't love! However, what really sets The Violet Hour apart is their incredible service. The vibe does certainly feel a bit exclusive, but to me it is not pretentious in the slightest. Every time I have been here, service has been attentive, thoughtful and incredibly gracious. The staff always make you feel very special and cared for, without being overbearing. To me that is the mark of a great service experience.  Lastly - I know some people would probably say this place is expensive but...comparatively, it's really not.

Violet Hour has no windows and the exterior wall is a constantly changing wall of graffiti. There is a (very handsome) doorman who peaks his head out to survey the line and lets guests in as they are ready to take you. Upon entering you immediately notice that it is extremely dimly lit, a very hip ambiance. There are three different rooms with posh seating and sleek white bars. We were seated in the third room at a cozy table for four. Once we were adjusted to the light you could really enjoy the atmosphere. An extensive list of craft cocktails tempts you outside of your box; definitely go for it! I chose a Big Leap, it was delish, and especially nice that it came with a small carafe of the extra drink that didn't fit in the lovely coupe glass. Our group was great about sharing so I got to taste all the drinks at our table: the Brooklyn, I Did...Did I?,Cul-de-sac swizzle, the Gold Star and the Reno Loner; I'd order any one of them again! Being from Kansas City I was thrilled to see J. Reiger Whiskey and Gin on the menu, just like home! We ordered the bacon wrapped dates, which were also wonderful.

This is a hidden Chicago bar in that there is no store front or windows; the place is behind a huge mural right across the street from Big Star. To find the door, look for the light above it. Luckily I knew were to go since no one in my party did.    Once inside you're held in a dimly lit waiting room. There is a sign that has all the rules of the place hanging on the wall. Luckily, there was only one group waiting ahead of us; we waited only 7 minutes before being seated. You're taken through very heavy dark curtains into the actual bar, and you're immediately hit with the very chill and romantic ambience. They have high back chairs and ottomans for you to sit on around a small table, and they provide you with cold water in a glass flask. The menu lists all the drinks they have, in addition to the small list of foods as well.  Drinks: spot on. For what you're paying, you are getting your money's worth. I had the Aviator and my friends got an old fashioned and the Juliet and Romeo. All were fantastic. Everything in his place seems slower and laid back, like you're not feeling rushed to get out of there. This place is perfect for a date night with your significant other.     Note: you CAN use your phone in this place, but you're not allowed to take phone calls. You can take pics or play on your apps all you like, but just don't talk on the phone. The host (bouncer?) explained that this place wants you to engage in conversation with the the people you're with, but they respect that your phone is a part of you nowadays.

Our bartender offered great recommendations and was made sure that our drinks were perfect before we got to drink them.   Experience #2, a Sunday night: So, we enjoyed ourselves so much the first time that we decided to come back for one last visit before leaving. This time we were sat at an actual table, we both still preferred sitting at the bar.  Review of the drinks: All of the drinks were AMAZING, we branched out both times and tried several $12 cocktails from their menu.  A few of our favorites:  Dark & Stormy Yo, Banana Boy - this was my personal favorite, it was so delicious that I HAD to order two! The Antidote The Pisco Kid Never Odd or Even - Boyfriend's personal favorite  Food: they has light appetizers which were appetizing, we tried the Spinach Dip and Deviled Eggs and they did not disappoint.  The only disappointment was that their house rules state no cell phone use in the lounge. I wish that they would enforce that policy and politely ask people to put away their cell phones if they are using them. ENJOY THE COMPANY YOU ARE WITH! It was so annoying having 3 phones go off with pictures and videos, it is also sad that some people are unable to stay off of their phones for more than an hour.

If you're having a crappy night, or want to treat yourself, or just need a space to get away and relax feel all is right with the world, you come here.

The drinks, though, are what make this place the best. I'm no connoisseur, though I do have my particulars about what I like and don't like. Somehow, The Violet Hour bends those rules. Even if I don't like the type of alcohol, even though I don't like certain ingredients, I have always loved anything I or my friends have ordered here. They just know what they're doing. The Juliet and Romeo is my go-to, but I have always been happy with everything else I've tried.  It shines in all other aspects as well.

There were only a few people in line to get seated when my friend and I arrived so the wait was not long; however, I felt that the person in charge of the line was very commanding and made the experience feel excruciatingly long. Every couple of minutes, he would make us move and would tell us exactly where to stand. This was very disruptive. I wasn't very happy because it seemed like the establishment didn't put much value in our experience prior to getting seated. Once we got seated, everything turned for the better. The atmosphere was very romantic - perfect for a third date. The seats were slightly uncomfortable but it is tolerable. Our server was very knowledgeable and gave great suggestions. We had the Juliet and Romeo, the Violet Hour Old Fashioned and the I did... Did I? The Juliet and Romeo was refreshing. It is gin-based with a strong lime flavor  and hints of cucumber and mint. There is a complex after-taste that I couldn't figure out, but I enjoyed the drink a lot. The Old Fashioned here is the best I've had. It was very well-balanced and has a viscous texture. The demerara gave it a unique taste. Lastly, the I did... Did I? is a surprising cocktail (it contained Green Tabasco). The drink contained turmeric, which gave it a salty and peppery flavor and Green Tabasco, which made the drink spicy. It is a mezcal-based cocktail with lime and cucumbers. It is both refreshing and spicy, a strange combination that surprisingly worked well. I would say that the Old Fashioned is my favorite drink among the three, but all three were exceptional. I am very impressed with the quality of drinks in Violet Hour.

You totally forget about the busy streets of the Damen intersection and even all the partying that's going on at Big Star across the street. The door to the Violet Hour blends in beautifully with whatever mural happens to be painted and I've walked by countless times before I even realized this was where the Violet Hour stood.  My friend and I arrived in line at just past 8 on a Saturday night. The wait wasn't more than 20 minutes so it was very manageable. The way the chairs are arranged kind of made it feel like mirrors at a fun house or something so I thought that was a bit strange. It's also a little weird that I can hear the conversation of the group sitting right behind me!  Drink-wise, anything at the top of each category (gin, rum, whiskey, brandy, etc) is not as strong. I got the pisco kid which was not bad but loved my friend's whiskey based drink. I forgot the name but it had pear as one of the ingredients and that ended up being quite tasty!  You can really get lost in time here as the staff does not hurry you at all despite the line outdoors and when you finally exit, it's hard to believe that there was a whole different world just inside.

We had three small plates and all were wonderful:  bacon-wrapped dates, shrimp/scallops and ricotta tartine.  The Fretted Strings cocktail was amazing.  To our delight, there were several vintages of Pappy Van Winkle on the menu, which could be purchased by the glass.   This review is really about the integrity of this establishment.  My daughter left her wallet in the bar and didn't realize it until we were packing for the airport the next morning.  All ended well.  She was contacted through FB that the wallet was found at TVH.  After a few communications with the staff, the wallet was returned by mail---with cards and cash intact.  Huge shout out to Ben and Patrick---you turned a lovely evening into an unforgettable one---  Thank you!!",0.9784,0.855,0.145,0.0,0.3953125

Worth going, but ONE thing was off. 3 Stars: I was ok, but in a city like Chicago you can find better places. I wouldn't come back. 2 Stars: Disappointed. I wouldn't come back, even if it was the last place in Chicago. 1 Star: Don't go here! Rip-off, Tourist-trap, dangerous, or something like this. Please close this place.  It is a good place. The venue is nice (I especially like the high chairs), the service is good and the drinks are great. So, why only 4 stars? Because I think there is a huge hype about the bar but it isnt as special as the pretend to be. Because the always present line in front of the door, it does feel like they are trying to turn tables a little bit.

We had a group of 7, the guy at the door was super friendly and helpful. He was able to get us a table pretty quickly, we even got to skip some people in line :) This place is beautiful! Has a very cozy, hidden vibe, definitely feels like you're in a speakeasy rather than an average bar. For a place that looks this nice, you would think their prices would be outrageous but at $12 a drink, it's really not bad at all! I got the Nervous Breakdown, it was really good though I don't think it was very strong, that might have been why it tasted so good.  The reason I give this place 3 stars and not 5 are one, they don't do separate checks, which is just annoying because come on guys, it's 2016 and unless you're using a system from 1995, you should be able to split checks. And secondly, I really wasn't a fan of our waitress. She wasn't helpful, she really had no insight to offer us. We told her it was our first time, we asked what she would recommend, her response was ""well i don't know your taste palette"" umm that's not what I asked you, but okay. The girl who brought out our drinks/food was really nice, kind of wish she was our waiter. On our way out, we couldn't find the exit since its really dark and it was our first time there. one of the guys in our group politely asked a waiter where the exit was and she gave him a really dirty look, didn't say anything and just pointed.

The doorman and staff were very friendly and accommodating. We originally were seated at the bar but we had out hearts set on sitting in the huge chairs so we had to go back in line and wait another 5 minutes of so before we were seated. The place is very dark so be prepared to use the candle on the table to read the menu. The drinks were good; about the same as what you would find at The Whistler. I had their more ""spirited"" drinks the Vodka Warsaw Was Raw-it was refreshing with a large lemon peel inside and then I had the Whiskey based Out the Airlock and it was very strong, as I expected, but still tasty.

And literally everyone was sitting and ordering cocktails. None of those fighting for the bar tenders' attention to get your fix.  What could go wrong right? The cocktails themselves did not live up to the expectation. I ordered a tequila based cocktail, it looked like mini pint of beer, except it tasted like bud wiser mixed with liter fluid and tequila. One could argue, it is epitome of Manly drinks. But it's not worth the wait or money.  Also to cleanse my taste buds, I ordered a mojito. I'm mean you can't screw up a simple classic drink. Oh no. They somehow managed to screw it up. It was extra lemony and there was is little trace of the alcohol.  Oh well, bottom line is, I don't want to give this rating.

I've had a few absinthe cocktails, and they were ok, but never the poir. Let's face it, I wanted to do the pour because it looks fucking cool. Anywho, I came here past the mural, thru the hallway, and behind the curtain solely to do the absinthe pour.  When you're being seated, if you're waiting on your party, the hostess won't seat you til your entire party arrives (overheard from another guy in line). I had no trouble getting seated right away since it was just me. The hostess explains they do have some house rules - no flash photography, no overdoing it on the phone talking those were the big ones which she explained to me. Elsewhere posted were no baseball caps, they have no cheap shitty beers, and a few other things. They do take pics for you with the flash if you want evidence of your attendance, so I don't think that one's a hard and fast rule. As for the pour, I had two different absinthes and they were both good. They walk you thru doing a pour and w me being a nube, I did the full pour and both sugar cubes.

I prefer the bar for the action - I love to watch the bartenders mix up everyone's drinks. Plus, you might end up with a sip of their punch. It's still unclear if the drunken man next to us bought our first round or not, but hey! We'll take it.  I had a gin based cocktail - Juliet and Romeo (cucumber, rose water and mint) and a glass of rosé. The bartender was attentive but blasé with his approach to taking our orders - one at a time instead of as a group.  This is the perfect spot to let the bartender strut his stuff. Give him a few ingredients or a type of liquor for the base and let him concoct something special. He also let me in on a tasty rosé that was a recent but limited feature on the menu.

My fellow colleagues and I were on a hunt for a good spot to get a cocktail nearby. We had just finished up a fun cooking class in the area and since the weather was not great we decided to stick around Wicker Park for a while and take Danny W up on his recommendation. I'm pretty horrible when it comes to directions, so although a native to Chicagoland, you best believe I busted out my Google maps to direct my out of town pals. Good thing I did too, because we almost walked right past this lounge! My map said we had arrived, but there was no obvious bar in sight. It wasn't until Cindy G found a cool looking wall that opened up to be a door that we realized The Violet Hour had a speakeasy kind of situation going on. When you walk in there are curtains and a host to greet you on the other side. It was a long wait (I assume, he didn't give a set time) for a table, but spots at the bar were about to open up so we went for that instead. Literally my only complaint of my experience were the barstools themselves. Sure, they looked comfy and cool and were bench-like, but there was way too many of them stuffed up at the bar. It was hard to even sit down or move around. Other than that, my experience was 5 stars! The bartender fit the feel of the lounge and was awesome at crafting cocktails. He definitely made it look like an art! While they do have a very good cocktail, champagne, and wine menu, I was interested in a bubbly concoction. No problem there! The bartender whipped me up something delicious. I honestly have no idea what it was called, but it involved grapefruit, some champs, and other tasty ingredients I can't quite remember. Our group was also lucky enough to try their rum punch. It's kind of unclear if the bartender just gave us those drinks, or if the super drunk fellow next to me ordered them for us before he left. Regardless, they were free and pretty good. Not something I'd probably order again though, but that's because rum isn't high on my list. I tried a sip of Emily H's old fashioned and it was on point. Really well done and complete with the classic ice burg glacier to keep it chilled. It's to be noted that this bar also has crushed ice (which Cindy G was excited about)! I'd say the average price per cocktail was about $13 which is pretty standard for the area and type of establishment.  The Violet Hour is dimly lit inside and feels very exclusive.

After having to wait for about 20mins during which those with reservations were able to get seated, I was lead in to the bar.  Before I get to that part, just want to comment on how cool the graffiti outside is and how inconspicuously the door to the bar is blended in with the rest of the mural on the wall.

Now the drinks (I think they have small plates here, but that's not the reason to come).  All drinks are $13, no tax, which is a fair price considering that even cities like Columbus, OH, are pricing good cocktails at that price or above (BTW, check out Curio in German Village if ever in that city).  Perfectly made, a good amount, well presented and a diverse menu.  There isn't really anything else to ask for, is there? Since it's a popular place in the city's trendiest neighborhood (which may shock tourists who set up camp on Michigan Ave.), there will always be a line to get, but the doorman actually keeps it moving, which leads to the weirdest thing about this place--how friendly the staff is.  About three or four people, not even assigned to your section, will ask if you need anything.   I know people have different opinions, but I'm not sure how anyone can give this place less than four stars, but perhaps their experiences were vastly different than the five times I've been there.

And don't go on a Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at 9pm and complain you had to wait in line.  Self inflicted head wounds my friends.  THANKS VH!",0.9953,0.725,0.237,0.038,0.46076858813700916

Mind you we are all young professionals who are all on vacation to enjoy all the great places Chicago has to offer, so for him to say that to us was extremely unprofessional and rude.  While waiting for about an hour outside. He completely ignores us and invites a party of 4 who were wearing fur coats inside after inviting 3 more parties. We were all dressed accordingly but if I ever visit this speakeasy again I will make sure to bring by fur coat.  We would have had no problem ordering many drinks and building up a high tab. But not even getting an update by telling us 'hey you guys are next,sorry for the long wait' would have been  nice and I would have calmed down.   I had to apologize for wasting my friends time for an hour and a half (took half an hour in an uber).

2016-02-04,4.0,"Envision a secret bar. You know, the ones you'd see in movies or in articles about prohibition; where a doorkeeper would slide open a speakeasy peephole, and ask for the password.  The Violet Hour doesn't take it that far, but it certainly feels like a secret. I've lived in Chicago for four years and I've never heard of this place until my most recent trip. As a matter of fact, my Lyft driver was the one who told me about it (Thanks, Eric!). First and foremost, if you don't do your research, then you'll have difficulty finding the entrance. I say this because the door is camouflaged in the midst of a colorful mural, and it's even harder to find when it's the dead of night (give me a break, I was blind after seeing a four-hour light show). My friend and I were pacing back and forth until a streetlight shined against the metal handle.  When I opened the door, we were expecting music... or lights... or signs of human life. However, as soon as we walked in, I thought I was going to get murdered. It was pitch black, confined and as quiet as a church mouse. It was then a tall intimidating man emerged from the curtains, gave us a rundown of the rules, and then set aside the above-mentioned curtains for us, revealing only but a strip of light. ""Remember that movie,'The Night Before'? Because I'm starting to feel like Seth Rogen right now,"" my friend whispered to me, as we stepped past the curtains, and finally saw what our Lyft driver was raving about. Imagine Alice in Wonderland meets prohibition in the 1920s. A dimly lit room adorned with purple high back chairs, violet walls and candles on every table. Chandeliers hung from the ceiling, and were turned onto its lowest setting. The bar was absolutely stunning.  We were seated by the intimidating man, and then a server immediately came over and helped us. I ordered the ""Juliet and Romeo"" from the gin section, and was won over as soon as I had my first sip. Beefeater gin, mint, cucumber, lime juice, Angostura bitters, rose water, and a pinch of salt. It was light and refreshing, but still had a slight tartness to it, which made it exciting. Also, they were not stingy with the liquor because there must've been at least half a cup of gin in my cocktail. Talk about getting bang for your buck. We did come in around midnight because their website claimed they were open till 2:00AM. However, the staff wanted to close an hour early so we did feel like we were being rushed. We were honestly gulping our drinks as fast as we could. But I was turned off by the fact that there was never an interaction where they didn't remind me of the time. We left twenty minutes before 1:00AM. I really do understand; it was a slow night, and aside from my friend and I, they were only six other people in the room. I just wish there was a little more subtlety so we didn't feel like we were being put on a timer. Nonethless, the overall staff was nice, and I wouldn't mind being helped by them again. In conclusion, I can see why people go nuts over The Violet Hour. It's a cool lounge with lots of flare and panache, and provides its client with the ability to feel special. The cocktails were delicious, the atmosphere was charming, and their play on being a ""secret underground bar"" was pretty thrilling. I'd recommend coming in at least a couple hours before closing time, but nevertheless, I did enjoy what The Voilet Hour had to offer, and I will be coming back in the future.",0.9965,0.807,0.143,0.05,0.5191984126984126
2016-01-31,5.0,"A friend of mine has been talking about how much she loves Violet Hour for a while. I don't know why but I assumed it was like any other bar off the blue line and didn't give it much thought. The other night we were having a drink downtown after work and she suggested we go and I just went along with it. It's right by the Damen stop and there's no sign. This instantly made me happy. It reminded me of the Pink Door in Seattle's Post Alley. When you walk in you're shrouded in curtains and mystique. A soft-spoken man from behind the curtain asks how many and tells you not to use your cell phone. He then leads you to a high backed chair in a corner next to a small coffee table. When you scan the bar, you see another era. It really felt like a 20s speakeasy and not in a cheap touristy way.  My friend and I tried a couple cocktails. I honestly can't remember their names but mine was a brandy cocktail with beer. They weren't overdone monstrosities masquerading as vintage drinks. They really looked simple and classic. Just the cocktails in the glasses. We ordered some nibbles. The dates wrapped in bacon were amazing and still piping hot when served. I hate lukewarm bar food. The deviled eggs are by far the best I've ever eaten. However, they only serve three halves. It's infuriating. I know that other egg half was just sitting in the kitchen. I usually withhold a star from places that only give three halves but I just can't this time. I just can't! Our server, a tall blond girl whose name I didn't get, was just so polite and informative. So was our food runner: a guy with a long pony tail. The servers crouch down and get on your level. They smile and you can hear it in their voices.

The heavy velvet curtains lifted and I was initially in awe.  Sleek ""vintage"" furniture.  Rich chandeliers.  Dim candle lights.  Curtains draped from top to bottom.  Wow, right?  As my eyes adjusted, I noticed a tear in my chair.  I also had a better look at the decor and I couldn't help but wonder how crap the place looks if all the lights were on.  Honestly, the decor didn't bother me much, like I said, I was initially in awe.

2015-12-25,5.0,"This place is so cool!  It was one of the first speakeasys that I went to in Chicago, and yes it's a bit pricey, but their drinks are awesome.  They have ""mixologists"" instead of bartenders, most people are dressed nicely, and it's quiet enough to have a nice conversation with a date.    The menu is broken up by drink of choice.  I'm a gin guy, so I typically order the Juliet and Romeo or Swiss Kiss.  This was the first bar that I had tasted a drink that used egg white as a means to create texture.   One of the things that I like most about Violet Hour is that if you bring someone who is a bit unsure of what they want, your bartender is always more than happy to assist.  They'll educate anyone who is willing to listen, and they'll help you make a decision so that you'll receive a drink you love.  Yes you'll wait outside to get in.  Yes, that's not so fun during winter time, but there's a reason for that line.  Violet Hour is definitely one of Chicago's hidden gems.",0.9921,0.703,0.246,0.051,0.523015873015873

Walking inside, we felt super cool having to be waved in and then led to our lounge area. They have a pretty extensive drink menu (that come at a price too)! I forgot what I ordered, but it was really good. It really hits you in the end too. My sister got the Juliet and Romeo and that one was really good with a kick of spice and a little tart.

The place looks like a wooden box and I could barely see the door until the bouncer opened it up for us. The place is located directly across from Big Star Tacos so that's a good landmark for newcomers. I have heard that the wait can be 30 mins - an hour on weekends so I am glad I didn't have to wait at all for a seat. The chairs inside were big and tall, similar to the Alice in Wonderland tea party theme. The ambiance is dimly lit and very romantic. Cellphones are ""not allowed"" but you can sneak a picture here and there (without flash of course) if you really want to but the lighting is so dark that it's really no use. For the drinks menu, they divided the drinks up by choice of liquor and each section ranges from lighter less strong drinks to heavier stronger drinks. I just got the moscow mule since it's my go to while my friend got his whiskey inspired Daisy 17. Both drinks were very yummy and delicious and strong. I was a bit sad that my moscow mule didn't come in a copper mug like they typically do. Most drinks are $13-15, a bit pricey but it is fairly strong. Nice place to go after dinner or grab drinks with a few friends. I wouldn't recommend coming here with a big party.",0.9945,0.733,0.226,0.041,0.4548611111111111
2015-11-30,5.0,"In a place like this you'll want to stay more than an hour and no I wasn't seeing through rose colored glasses.   Once you find the door which isn't that much more hidden at night than in daytime your transported to a different world. I was pleasantly surprised as my chi was aligned with the house rules. No cell phones use in the lounge, proper attire requested, no baseball hats, no reservations, and only craft drinks. They specifically say no bombs of any kind, no Budweiser, light beer, grey goose, cosmopolitans and don't' bring anyone you wouldn't bring to your mothers Sunday dinner. My friends were regulars here and showed me the ropes so I didn't aimlessly wander for the entrance. Heavy velvet curtains open your eyes to the magic that's inside. I went on a weeknight so it wasn't crowded or busy. Not only did I have great conversation with my party, but the staff was very engaging about both drinks/bartender and life. They were happy to try and impress me even more, but I was already sold.  The décor is amazing, super tall ceilings, the velvet curtains go all the way up and do a great job of keeping the sound in. It's actually quite large while keeping it still intimate with lighting and seating arrangements. I liked the PB&J, but thought maybe to swap peychaud's for molasses or chocolate bitters. They have a very European feel to the menu, but I think it's because they aren't so whiskey heavy like Longman & Eagle. It is pricy and maybe not as worth it for cocktails alone, but ambiance is unrivaled. Bathrooms could use some work.

My date ordered the Old Fashion and said Violet Hour makes the best one in the city. Not too sweet and syrupy. One thing I sort of disliked where we were sitting at cause it had me facing directly into another couples conversation and it was hard to focus on my own. Other than that nice romantic spot.

We also ordered a side of roasted nuts to snack on, but they were a bit spicy since they're tossed with cayenne and paprika. We had only planned to stay for one drink, so we didn't get to try anything else on the menu. They all sounded and looked very unique and tasty though.

We waited in the hall/entrance to get in because it was a ""full house"" (as we were told by the man working the door) on a Tuesday at 11:30 PM. The man working the door sat on his phone the entire 15-20 minutes we stood and waited. After multiple people left, we politely asked if there was a seat at the bar or something. He acted frustrated but begrudgingly looked and said ""oh, I guess we have a table for you."" Once inside, we realized there were several 2-person tables and seats at the bar (even two together!). After we waited for over 10 minutes to get any sort of acknowledgement or service, we decided to leave. Point is, I wanted to spend money here! I wanted to enjoy the cocktails!

""It's exclusive, the lines are ridiculously long. You have to try it."" I kept putting it off because waiting in line is not my thing. Finally caved in a few weeks ago.   First off, there was barely a line. We got in about five minutes after standing outside.  When you walk in past the door there is a robe before you actually enter. The bouncer had us wait in that small space between the door and robe for a minute or two. I'm convinced they do it to build suspense because once you get in your like, ""Uh, this is it?""  It just seems like they're following the basic speakeasy formula. Dim the lights, throw in some odd shaped furniture, create witty, hipster names for your drinks and viola you're done. There was nothing special about this place that makes me want to go out of my way to get here let alone wait in a line if there is one.  I'm a simplest when it comes to drinks so I looked at the menu like it was in another language. Our cocktail waitress was very sweet though. She asked me what I usually drink and tweaked one of their drinks to better suit my taste buds. One of my friends doesn't drink and got a mocktail. Waitress said she'd surprise him with something and it actually turned out really well. Tasted better than some of the drinks my other friends got. Although I'm not over the moon about this place, I still gave it 4 stars because our waitress was awesome, my drink was good, I didn't wait in line, and service was quick.

2015-10-06,4.0,"This has been a bookmarked bar for me for a while now. I figured my latest late night excursions in Chicago would be a great time to find this place. Unfortunately, the darkness surrounding this area added to my lack of eyesight after 5pm meant I wandered aimlessly past this place twice before Googling myself to the entrance. A doorman/bouncer stands outside and groups you by party before you enter. Luckily we came on a pretty mild Friday night so the line I so hear mentioned was non existent. After a few seconds of ID checking, we are escorted into the building through some chemise curtains into a darkened room with very high ceilings. Every table was shrouded in a sexy darkness...that kind that is just enough to see your date's face but might blur distinguishing features. Each table is a pretty block, set low enough for drinks. Chairs are high backed and make you feel like you are in some sort of Mad Hatter tea party decorated by Chanel. Needless to say, I adore the decor (does that rhyme? this place is making me poetic). The drinks are also delicious. I cannot recall what I ordered (this was bar #3 after an early dinner) but it was really good and worth every penny. Our waiter, also quite dapper in his own right, was very attentive and offered suggestions for my very confused friends who never imbibe unless I'm in town. Unfortunately, we came around 1:30am so we weren't able to meander through the place and take a look around before closing. I will definitely be back to try some other cocktails and explore this place more. Hopefully I'll be able to find it again!",0.9862,0.759,0.171,0.071,0.649887074829932

The whole vibe is great and the line moves quickly if you are just a party of two- especially after 11pm. The bouncer had always been very pleasant. Each time we have sat at the bar versus at a table, but we are totally fine with that; we get to watch the amazing bartenders do their thing! The bar seats are also super wide and plush, which I love. It's not a place I would spend the whole evening, but this is a perfect place for a night cap. Drinks are a little pricey ($15 each), but it is definitely worth the experience and the quality of the drink.

2015-10-05,4.0,"I would give it 5 stars, but I really,really hate that line.  If you read the house rules, it mentions not wearing caps, no cellphones, etc. Non of those are enforced, which I think is nice. How else am I going to instagram my drink with my bestie? Really though, it's a nice place for cocktails. They are a very good value ~$15, and the food isn't half bad. I recommend the fries with garlic aoli to soak up some of the alcohol. To get in, you have to find it first. It's a bit hidden, since the door is blended into the wall and then painted over with a mural. Some of the recent murals have been kind of weird. I might not just understand hipsters. Usually, though, there is a huge line so just get close and get in the first line you see. Since there are no reservations, your whole group must be there to get in. That means you won't be able to have somebody else meet with you later at the Violet hour. Alternatively, it makes getting in a bit easier. They only let people in when there is available seating, so a group of 3 might get in before the group of two in front of them just for seating optimization.  Once in, there are three main rooms and a bar. The front room has tall chairs which make talking very easy and you can keep it as open/private as you want. The second room has the bar and is where the hall to the bathrooms are. The bathrooms are all larege individual rooms which is great. I don't really judge places by their bathrooms, but I seriously love the bathrooms here. You could have a secret pow-wow or really reexamine your life in them.  The third room is my favorite. I came to the Violet Hour for NYE and we sat right in front of the fireplace here. On either side of the fireplace are L couches with tall backs. It really is very elegant.  Despite how dark and sexy the ambiance is, it really isn't THAT intimate. The huge luxurious chairs make it hard to get close to your date, and the incredible drinks and great selection of music is oddly distracting from deep conversation.  That staff is very hipster and they will go out of there way to help you... once you are actually inside. I would recommend this for reconnecting with friends, when you just feel like having a cocktail, and if you want to just drink and relax.",0.9973,0.773,0.185,0.043,0.5444232804232804

Our seats were not comfortable; I was seated in the middle of a bench squashed in between to other groups. I was literally touching people on both sides of me while my date sat across from me on a stool that had no back and was not comfortable. 3. the place was LOUD; there were several large groups of what looked like college students super drunk shouting at each other.  That being said, we had a couple of drinks and the bacon wrapped dates. The dates were AMAZING. Seriously one of the most memorable food items I have had in a long time. The cocktails I thought were good but they did not blow me away especially given my high expectations. Overall, definitely worth a visit; hopefully you get seated in one of the more comfortable seating areas.

You pretty much line up next to the wall directly across the street from Big Star (which is always consistently busy). There is some graffiti on the wall, which helped me find it. When I arrived around 8:00pm on a Thurs, there were about 4 people in line ahead of me. The bouncer came out, asked if I had a reservation, told me to wait a few minutes and then let me right in. I was escorted to a seat at the bar. The bartender couldn't have been any less enthused to serve me. He acted as if I should have been grateful to be in his presence. Getting his attention even though he was standing right in front of me was very daunting. I think he just straight up ignored me. Meanwhile, he was waiting on the couple next to me as if his job depended on it (and they only ordered one round of drinks). He was having long conversations with them, giving them tastings and even gave them a free shot...while I had to wait 30 minutes for another $14 drink, with my empty glass just sitting in front of me. I started to leave, but I had heard good thinks about the drinks and really wanted to try them. The menu has the cocktails separated and listed by spirit. I tried one rum, one tequila and one whiskey cocktail. The Spanish Margarita (made w. Lunazul Blanco, lime, Marie Brizard Orange Curaçao, Licor 43, Hellfire bitters) was my favorite, which is not surprising since I love tequila. For food, I also got the fries, ham & cheese slider and the pulled pork slider. The pulled pork slider was my favorite. I'm surprised I actually stayed that long to try all of that given the fact that the bartender seemed to loathe me. Also, one of the barbacks' girlfriends was standing there practically behind the bar taking shots with all the bartenders and tasting other people's drinks. It was weird and really unprofessional. They were really acting like they were at a frat house. The worst part is that the manager started joining in and dancing up on the girlfriend.

All of the tables are lit only by candlelight, which gives this place that very intimate feel. I didn't feel any sense of pretentiousness that others have noted.  The cocktails are perfectly crafted by their mixologists. I sat at the bar once and was blown away by the attention to detail that was put into each drink. Even the presentation is impressive. My personal fave (being the gin drinker that I am) is the Juliet & Romeo, but every bourbon and rye drink I tried were equally as delicious. I'm honestly I fan of anything they make with egg whites! They even made a special Sriracha drink for our table when we asked for something spicy, which may be my new go to drink there.

2015-07-21,4.0,"This was a tricky one, fellow Yelpers. Being an amateur bartender/mixologist myself, I had to check out what the Violet Hour had going on in the libation department.  Interesting for sure, but I'm on the fence about recommending it. I met my cousin, Carl S, here on Friday night 7/17 around 8:30pm.  Wicker Park was bumpin' at that time of evening and upon arriving, the only telltale identifier was a line of people forming outside a mural (that changes frequently, I'm told).  The line guy, who isn't really a bouncer per se, said that my party of two could jump to the front if we were willing to sit at the bar.  We were, and got plenty of dirty looks from hipsters and yuppies alike as we meandered our way inside. The interior ambiance is very cool.  Dimly lit, unusually loud, and the perfect place to bring a date.  There's candles aplenty and a vaulted ceiling to give an heir of subtle romance and intrigue.  I definitely dug it.  The cocktails menu is extensive and all--with the exception of a few--are priced at $13.  Pretty steep, but considering some of the ingredients used and preparation involved, thirteen bucks isn't unreasonable. I began with their signature drink, the 'Juliet & Romeo', which was made with beefeater gin, mint, cucumber essence, and rose water.  Served in a coupe glass (yes, I know what that is), it was delightfully refreshing and meticulously crafted.  From there, I moved on to the 'Holy Roller' which was made with blanco tequila, pineapple, chicory, and a banana liqueur.  Decent, but not the greatest.  For drink #3, I asked that the barkeep ""surprise me"" with a spicy cocktail, and surprise me he did.  It was called the 'El Tiempo' and was fashioned with muddled strawberry, infused tequila, lime, cucumber water, and Sriracha and Cholula hot sauces.  Served in a highball with a single large ice sphere, it was absolutely sensational.  Packed just enough heat to satiate me, but not so much that it overwhelmed the other flavors. I was hoping to try some of their light food items, but things like roasted nuts, pulled pork sliders, and red pepper dip at elevated prices turned me off.  Seeing a hot ham-and-cheese sandwich on the menu at an upscale place like this leaves me scratching my head. The drinks were incredible and the atmosphere is awesome, but here's where the -1 star comes into play: They don't take reservations.  At all.  First-come first-serve kinda sucks. They don't have an area inside where customers can wait.  This meant that on a sweltering summer evening when the heat index hit 105°, we were stuck standing outside for a good quarter hour.  And we were the lucky ones; larger groups waited significantly longer. There's no indicator of where the Violet Hour actually *is*.  ZERO signage.  Good luck finding it if it's your first time. The food menu was surprisingly lame.  I know they're a bar, not a restaurant, but at a place that's as posh and trendy as this, I expected far more (although one item is advertised as 'pomme frites with aioli', in actuality it's just garlic-dusted french fries). Actually, for those reasons I could dock them 2 stars, but I was so blown away by the specialty cocktails that I'll stop at -1.  Also because I'm nice. TL;DR-- I enjoyed my time here, but I won't likely return.  For the price, Fulton Market's 'The Aviary' has niftier drinks, vastly superior small bites, and far nicer accommodations.  The Violet Hour is good for some, but not for most.  My advice is to have a drink (or 2), then bolt, but certainly don't plan on making a night out of coming here, and I personally wouldn't wait any more than 30 minutes to be seated. Oh, and I couldn't take any pictures because phones aren't allowed.  You get sternly scolded if you're on your Samsung Galaxy S5 (learned this one the hard way). Oh, and one of the house rules is to ""not bring anyone here that you wouldn't bring to Sunday night dinner at your parents.""  Well guys, my parents are pretty cool and accepting, so I guess that means if I ever return to The Violet Hour.....I'm bringing with me a group of heavily-tattooed hookers.

The Violet Hour is a speakeasy style cocktail bar, comfortably nestled across from Big Star and Dove's right off the Damen Blue Line. The bar entrance is an unmarked door on a muraled wall. Even knowing where it is, it's still easy to miss. There's a doorman, not unlike The Aviary's doorman, that serves as the bar's Cerberus before the Charon hostess deigns to to let you in. My idea of a $12 drink is a good-looking scotch, neat, so a place like Violet Hour doesn't quite appeal to me. But if you're going to go big or go home, it's a solid alternative to trendiness and impressing friends, provided you couldn't land that reservation to The Aviary. The drinks are good, tasty, and stiff. If The Aviary's cocktails are like a mindbending two hours of Inception, The Violet Hour's are more like The Dark Knight: just as good, but much more consumable by general audiences. Cocktails are a la carte, highlighted by liquor to allow for easy browsing.  Yes, they still have fancy names. Yes, despite ingredients you don't know, let alone can pronounce, they go down fine and dandy. And yes, the house rules are amazing, and worth the price of admittance (which is gratis).

When we entered the man at the door wouldn't let us go past these heavy velvet curtains and kept asking questions about our party for a couple minutes in between disappearing behind the curtains. I thought it was the strangest behavior until I realized it was a speakeasy. Inside is so beautiful!

The menu changes seasonally and the options were so inventive and unique. I ended up with a gin drink which had ""carrot syrup"" as a primary ingredient. It was light, refreshing, and earthy. Very unique and tasty. Our neighbor offered us part of his appetizer- bacon wrapped dates. We couldn't say no. Wow. They were incredibly flavorful.  The only reason I did not give The Violet Hour 5 stars is due to the wait and the reception. I know it's a popular place and the wait may be long, but the hostess wasn't the most inviting or helpful. She was unable to offer any estimations on wait times and just wasn't the most pleasant. Just because a place is popular doesn't mean you should forget customer service and how to treat guests.

2015-04-24,5.0,"I've been met with a greater sense of superiority and pretention at truck stops.  I honestly do not know what others are talking about.  Our waitress was a total sweetheart, and she appeared to float from table to table in her maxidress.  She was more flowerchild than cocktail c*nt.  At the end of our night, we were not rushed at all, despite the line growing outside.  She offered us more drinks but also welcomed us to stay awhile just to chat. Even the doorman was relatively relaxed and cool.  He simply asked how many were in each party and led us through the door.  It is pitch black when you enter, but I liked that he didn't immediately walk away - I sensed that he gave us a few extra seconds to get our eyes settled in the darkness. Get here early, and go in groups no bigger than 4.  Most tables are meant for two, but there are some for four.  The smaller the group, the shorter your wait.  We walked up at 6:12 on the DOT, and there was already a line waiting to get in.  They seat one party at a time, so we were relieved to learn that the line didn't necessarily mean that they were already to capacity. Violet Hour is located across the street from Big Star.  See that wall of graffiti?  That's Violet Hour. OK enough of the logistics - let's drink! I had two cocktails, the first was the Juliet and Romeo, a gin-based cocktail with rose and cucumber.  Refreshing, light, sweet, for me this is a perfect cocktail.  My second drink was the Wrath of Grapes, a vodka-based drink with St. Germain.  I usually don't like vodka paired with St. Germain, but this drink was a winner.  I sank deeper and deeper into my luxurious, high backed leather chair. The cocktail menu is separated by spirit, with maybe 4-6 options per spirit, which made narrowing my choices much easier.  If you're still not pleased, there's a book of classic cocktails with names and descriptions. The food menu is minimal, but the truffled ricotta on toasted rye was a nice bar snack for two. Oh, and the dress code?  As long as you don't show up looking like a total schlub in sweat pants, ball caps, or sports jerseys, you should be fine.  And that no cell phone rule?  It's nice to sit in darkness yet sense that everyone around you is involved in a real, face-to-face conversation instead of tapping away at their phones.  I don't know if this rule is enforced, but this rule kind of makes this a cocktail bar utopia.",0.994,0.809,0.146,0.045,0.5230470521541949
2015-04-24,5.0,"I was afraid I would hate the place.  I saw words like ""pretentious"", ""snobs"" and ""exclusive"" in several reviews...it didn't deter me though.  I have wanted to visit VH for a long time and was excited for a visit with another VH newbie, Angela P. VH exceeded all my expectations and I had a fabulous time. We visited on a Saturday and knowing the place opened at 6, we hung out at Big Star for tacos and Stan's for a warm up before getting in line.  At 615, there was already a line of anxious folks waiting to get inside. The gatekeeper did a great job ushering us in--looking back now, I think the spacing of our entrances helps keep the staff from getting overwhelmed with a stampede of folks if he just let everyone in all at once.  Makes sense.  I think we waited 15-20 minutes before getting seated.  And Yes be prepared to squint and shuffle because it really is that dark in there.  But eyes adjusting quickly, I found the space to be really lovely, sleek and sexy.  Sky blue and gray hues along with dim chandeliers and votives made the space seem upscale yet cozy.  I loved the high back chairs we had.  And as many have said before, the seating is arranged so that every party has a kind of private seating nook.  Seats are either the high-backed chairs/benches or backless cubes.  So thankful that we had high backed chairs because they were super comfy...super comfy with delicious cocktails makes Aimee very happy.   And on to the cocktails...the online menu does not do justice to what they offer at VH.  I had studied the menu prior and there were a few I wanted to try and then we are handed a menu book upon seating.  It did seem a bit overwhelming but I loved how they have such creative mixology happening here as well as classic cocktails.  I opened with the Much Obliged.  I'm more of a Vodka person but I loved this gin based drink. It's made with lemon and raspberry...it was fruity, refreshing and basically my kind of drink.  But then I went with the Pimm's cocktail afterward and I was again wowed by the flavors.  I've been out of the cocktail game for a while, focusing on craft beers and wine but VH has definitely brought my interest back to mixology and cocktail love.  We shared the truffled ricotta tartine. Angela was privy to my excitement of the ricotta small plate at Gather so it made sense to stick with the theme. Toasted hemp seed rye bread topped with ricotta cheese, truffle oil, fresh herbs, honey and arugula. The truffle was very subtle, the cheese super fluffy and the honey and arugula complemented the flavors well.  The playlist added a very eclectic background sound yet the space was very conversation friendly.  I love the no cell phone rule too. No loud yakety yaks ruining the ambience.

It's a nice touch when they offer you a 'sidecar' for cocktails that didn't 100% fit in the glassware used, and the service is always on-point. If you have questions, need suggestions, etc. they're very helpful. Also, I would suggest sitting at the bar and watching the mixologists--really entertaining. All of the food options are also very solid. Most of the times I've gone, I've arrived 15 or so minutes before it opens to ensure I get seated right away, so I'm not as familiar with the wait-times.

We were the first guests there and were seated right away. When you first enter, the small room is dark and then you enter a dimly lit lounge. The atmosphere is romantic and very intimate. I loved the tall lounge seats that you sit in - literally like a single person couch, but the backing and sides go up about 8 feet I would say. The service was wonderful here and our server was very friendly and great about explaining everything to us since it was our first time there. She was also very attentive.  During our visit, I had the Juliet & Romeo and Tommy Gun. Both drinks were delicious and the prices weren't too bad. I liked that the menu was split up into categories based on the spirit type.

The door to the venue is hidden within a mural on the wall, and you can only tell you're at The Violet Hour by the handle on the door and the small lamp above it.  The way this bar works is that you are seated at tables/the bar depending on how many people are in your party. My sister and her bf and I only had to wait 15ish minutes before we got to go inside and were lucky enough to be seated immediately at the bar. No cell phones allowed, which we didn't mind, as it made the social experience better. In addition, their huge menu of drinks categorized by spirit was great! It made for hard decisions in choosing drinks. WHAT WE GOT: 1) Juliet and Romeo: SO happy I got this drink!!! I had to force myself to keep a slow pace on drinking this up because it was so good and refreshing. Didn't even know this was one of the most popular drinks, but I'm happy I chose it 2) apple cider with scotch: my sister got this--and it was VERY good! We couldn't taste the alcohol (which makes it dangerous, but I prefer drinking drinks that don't taste strong, or if they are strong, that they are masked by other ingredients in the drink) 3) old fashioned: didn't try this but my sister's bf seemed very pleased.  The atmosphere was great! I loved how intimate and low key it was--it would be a great place to take your date after a dinner, or even for a nice relaxing night out with a couple friends. In addition, if you prefer being with your own party rather than meeting rando's bumping into you and standing all around the venue, you'll love this place.

The decor was beautiful, elegant, and classic, the Violet Hour was everything people had said it was, everything was perfect, except for one very important aspect!

We were so disappointed we decided to end our time at the violet hour early. We had to get the negligent waiter's attention by almost tapping him, after we get his attention, he turns around and immediately says I'll be with you in a minute, as if he had been dealing with us all night or something, we interrupted him and told him we wanted The check.

After a few minute wait, we were escorted to two of the tallest backed chairs I've ever seen, surrounding two small tables with water glasses and candles. I felt like I could be on a throne! The lighting is dim; definitely a date night place if I've ever seen one. Music selection was jamming and not too loud to converse over. If you're not at a table or the bar, you wait outside, so I really loved the intimate ambiance you maintain without shoulder to shoulder crowds pressing in on you. The drinks are organized by liquor type, and many had ingredients I wasn't totally familiar with, but was able to discuss with the server, since I couldn't Google them. (Couldn't even get my phone to actually work in there, rules aside, perhaps they have a signal blocker in there? LOL) I ended up choosing a gray lady, a vodka and lemon based cocktail, which came with a small side beaker of a pinkish liqueur as well, and a manhattan for the other half.

Went on a cold-ish Saturday around 8pm and got in about a half hour later. When we left around 9, the ""outdoor"" line was down the block. Once you get in, though, you have your own space, and it's not crowded and not too loud. It is super dark, but you can always use your phone to read the menu. If your group splits up and some people arrive late, you have to wait for them before going in; they don't allow meet-ups once you're inside the bar.

The craft, perfection and art that they pour into their cocktails is astounding, and the whole ambiance of the place is dreamy. High backed chairs, velvet curtains, dim lighting, and cushy bar stools paired with amazing drinks? What's not to like? After hearing so much about this place, we decided to go here on a Saturday night after dinner around 8:30 and the wait was not long at all. Although there were other parties before us, we were seated after about 10 minutes of waiting because 3 seats opened up that the bar. That's what is great about this place-- it's not just any bar you can waltz into, crowd the bar, and stand around looking for a table to open. Everyone gets seated, which is something I haven't seen very often in bars and which also makes it a big plus for me! We ordered the Juliet & Romeo, the hot Apple Cider with scotch, and the Violet Hour Old Fashioned. It was amazing to watch the bartender in action and how much care they put into making these cocktails. If you have a chance to sit at the bar, take it! Not only were the drinks delicious, bartenders were very attentive and it was nice to see how the cocktails were made.",0.9907,0.82,0.164,0.016,0.5881249999999999

Avoid it unless you are starving . You are there for the exceptional drinks. And they are exceptional. And strong. Pro tip: Feel free to ask your servers questions if you don't know what's going on with a listed liquor or ""is this served over ice"" ect..

Then we got to what we came here for: the cocktails.  On the single sheet of paper is their seasonal menu, and in the menu book are pages that list all the other gin, tequila, whiskey, bitters, and rum cocktails, beer and wine, and a little bit of food.  All cocktails are $13.  My fancy Pimm's was very tasty (but a bit too sweet) and not too strong.  I barely had a buzz by the end of it.  I was hoping it'd be stronger, but maybe it's because we stuffed our stomachs with tacos across the street right before. So in the past, I've tried coming here on weekends, and the wait was always ridiculous.  I finally made it here on a Monday night around 6:30 PM, there were only a handful of other patrons here, and it only got slightly busier by the time we left at 8 PM.  Weekdays are your best bet for getting in here! In the heart of Wicker Park, there isn't a place like this that's quiet and upscale yet unpretentious.  Yes, they have house rules, and yes I used my cellphone (for pictures and texting), but nobody snubbed me.  Come here with someone you enjoy talking to!  Although a little over-hyped, I now know what to expect so I wouldn't mind coming back.",0.9496,0.86,0.091,0.049,0.5252539682539682

While the drinks on the menu looked intricate and delicious, I decided to ask the waiter for a drink that ""reminded me of a warm summer breeze on the beach."" I don't know where that came from, I guess I felt a primal yearning for summer in the midst of the Chicago winter.  The drink that I got was delicious. It was modeled off of the Hotel Nacional cocktail so it was rum based with pineapple juice, apricot brandy, and lime juice mixed in.  Unfortunately, we could only stay for one drink as we were trying to run across the street to Big Star to get some tacos before their kitchen closed for the night.

2015-01-26,2.0,"My girlfriend wanted to try this place and I live in Wicker Park, so coming here eventually was inevitable. Based on the other reviews, it sounds like our experience was somewhat typical. Our experience here overall was not horrible by any stretch, but I definitely have some grievances to air. I don' t think The Violet Hour deserves the average four-star rating it currently has.  Strike 1: This place is hard to find. The entrance is either wallpapered or painted (they switch it up). There is literally no indication whatsoever of where the damned place is. Do your research ahead of time. Or, just read this review. You'll find The Violet Hour directly across the street from Big Star.  Strike 2: We waited for almost an hour. The whole time, everyone else in line kept saying, ""This had better be worth it."" Some people gave up and left. If I weren't with my girlfriend and her friend, I would have left. too (I suggested leaving after waiting 20 minutes). Time is valuable and it was cold out. We felt teased, as we felt relief upon being let inside finally only to discover there was a whole other line inside. A real speak easy would not have a big line outside the door, so if authenticity is what the long line is about, I'm over it.  Strike 3: They finally seated our group of three and I had to sit on a stool at the table. It felt awkwardly tacked on, especially when the other two chairs were the high, comfy ones I had seen uploaded to Yelp. This was particularly unwelcome after having waited for such a long time.  Strike 4: My gin martini wasn't properly mixed. I let the rest of the table sample mine and they agreed it didn't taste right. After doing some mixing myself, it tasted infinitely better. Still, for the price (and the wait--geez), I expected a lot more.  Strike 5: The music was way too loud to fit in with the otherwise somewhat romantic dimly lit vibe. It was incongruous.  Positives: The atmosphere is romantic, dark, and mysterious. The service was really great. My girlfriend was really pleased at finally trying this place. Despite my complaints, I don't recommend against coming here. There is a time and place for Violet Hour. I don't recommend it to tourists because the hour or so you would waste in line could be much better served actually exploring this beautiful city.

Might make more sense to give customers a call and 5 minutes to return to claim their table, which is what some of the really tiny cocktail joints I've been to have done.

There were many cute little booths and I think that it would be a fun spot for a date. It took me literally 10 minutes to decide which drink I wanted from the list of cocktails and I finally decided on the Unique New York.

2015-01-03,5.0,"I've heard people complain about the entrance, but I kind of dug that you the Violet Hour is this swanky, sexy, dimly lit lounge with gorgeous furniture and high end drinks tucked behind a street art covered wall and a secret door.  First impressions: the front staff; the hostess and security are a little rigid. It was quite off putting that the first two people we interacted with were unpleasant and lacked any semblance of expected customer service niceties. No ""welcome to.."" no ""how are you this evening?"" Nothin'. Just a long stare and a gruff, ""are you aware of our house rules? ID's.""  I've experienced better manners and customer service at the DMV. My friends and I exchanged glances, deciding whether or not we should leave because of how rude the gate keepers were, but figured we'd have a drink and leave if it was just as terrible inside. *Spoiler Alert: it wasn't!* We were sat in the far back lounge where every patron looked like they had any lovely thought, any happy memory, any shred of joy sapped from them. I'm totally exaggerating but we did overhear the couple next to us breaking up. Like, they legitimately had the break up conversation and left separately. We had just left the Double door where minutes earlier we watched Har Mar Superstar, who's kind of a midwest Ron Jeremy-esque loungey R&B singer roll around in his undewear making out with McCauly Caulkin on stage, so we were on a totally different wavelength. But we intended to have fun anywhere we went, so we rolled with it. The drink was whatever, to be honest. We shared of bowl of punch which was pink and not-too-sweet and well balanced. It tasted like something my mother has made at Christmas time, that I started sneaking sips of since before I was tall enough to reach the bowl. It was served in a punch bowl with a big cube of ice.  What earned the five star review was the outstanding service we received from Samantha and Alyssa. Seriously, outstanding. They both had huge smiles on their face the entire time, they seemed genuinely enthusiastic about the cocktails and  took our drunken exuberance in stride. At one point I told Samantha I wanted to fold her up and put her in my pocket and take her with me because she beamed with joy and goodness (which now, from my sober vantage point, is maybe a little weird and creepy). And we left them both love notes on the credit card receipt. We. Loved. Them. They seemed to walk a fine line between taking their job seriously enough to provide good, quick, attentive service, but not so seriously that they were still having a good time even though they were at work. Kudos to both of them. We left loving the Violet Hour, despite our initial feelings about the place, and will be back again.",0.999,0.707,0.241,0.052,0.5524316939890711
2015-01-03,4.0,"I love the whole idea of this place and have been to many similar places both in Chicago and in other cities, but I must agree with another reviewer who said that the music is way too loud and kind of kills the whole Speakeasy vibe that Violet Hour puts out.  I took a friend from out of town here, and we couldn't talk quieter than a shout nor could I hear her that well, despite sitting pretty close to one another.  When I first came to Violet Hour years ago, the music was a lot softer, and America's Top 40 was not playing.  I'm not sure if management was switched up or what.  When I've gone in there the past year or two, I've felt like I was at a night club.  Having flashbacks of my young and naive years of hitting up Level or Bar Chicago.  Anyway, I think the drinks are great, and I haven't really had enough food to generate an objective review of it.  Some people complain that it's too hard to find, but that's kind of the whole point of a Speakeasy if you do a quick history check ;) Definitely need to go at least once for the experience!",0.8917,0.777,0.133,0.09,0.5591880341880342

2014-12-15,5.0,"My husband and I came here at opening time (6:00 PM) on a Saturday night. We waited in a short line in the hallway inside, but were basically seated right away. We immediately loved the atmosphere, with the tall chairs, candlelight, and velvet curtains. My husband is a cocktail person and loves his whiskey, so he was as happy as a clam. I, however, am less of a hard liquor-lover, and so I tend to find fewer cocktails that I like. First I had the Romeo and Juliet, which I absolutely loved. My second cocktail, though, was a bit strong and bitter for my taste. The server noticed that I wasn't drinking it and so she offered to replace it with another cocktail that I would like better. She asked me a bit about what I like and came back with something that was much more to my taste. And then she didn't even charge us for the drink I hadn't finished. I thought that was really above and beyond, since I'm sure nothing was wrong with the drink itself, and it was totally my fault for not asking for advice before ordering it. I've been back to Violet Hour since, and my advice to a person going for the first time would be to always ask the servers for advice before ordering. Every server I've had has been really knowledgable and happy to help, and if nothing on the menu is quite striking your fancy, they'll just go to the bartender with a list of things you like and will come back with the perfect drink for you.

I loved the name, the lighting in the photos I had seen, and from what I read it had a somewhat obscured entrance and sign, but I didn't know how exactly. It sounded mysterious and I like that.   Some people were supposed to meet me there. The first and only person who made it (we still don't know what happened to the others), called me and said we had a problem. I wanted to know what it was. He said he was standing in front of an empty storefront. I told him I had read the sign was either missing or hard to see, and could he please double check the address. It took him quite awhile, but he said he believed the door was covered in wallpaper, just like the walls were for several feet.  Lo and behold, that was the door! Yeah. When I arrived I even found free parking nearby, a couple streets over.  We were led in by a man in a knit cap and coat, and the interior was even more dark and mysterious than the photos I had seen. The lighting is very romantic and suitable for dates, or if you want to just relax. I can't think of anyone in Chicago who doesn't need to relax. The tables are very small and not dinner tables, but the menu is just appetizers, so that doesn't really matter. I had a really delicious drink. The only thing that wasn't perfect, was that the waiter probably only looked my way and talked to me once, but in his defense, my friend was being very flamboyant, telling jokes, and dominating our space.",0.9853,0.781,0.155,0.064,0.5918

I suggest taking the time to fully appreciate all that went into them. I had two that were some of the best cocktails I've ever had.

When we finally did enter, it was much darker than anticipated but I suppose the ambiance is supposed to be dark and sexy?  The decor was simple and chic; there were high backed chairs, chandeliers, and little candles on each table.  I had a hard time reading the drink menu and had to lean over so I could use the light from the candle.  Now I know how my parents feel when they use the flashlight on their phones to read menus in dark restaurants.  We wanted to use our cell phones for light as well but house rules state that you're not allowed to use cell phones in here.  I was very sad since I didn't get to take any pictures of the place nor of my drink....so I apologize fellow Yelpers!   Service was good and that was a definite plus in my book.  Our server was a very nice girl and she was quick with taking our orders, getting our drinks to us, and bringing the check when we were ready to head out.   Onto the main event, drinks!  The drinks here are pricier like everyone has already stated since they are specialty cocktails and tend to be stronger.  Are they worth $14?  I'm not so sure about that but that may be because I'm more of a beer type of gal.  I chose the ""Flip the Bird"" cocktail which was rum based and I mostly chose this one because of the whole egg ingredient calling out to me.  I mean, doesn't that sound pretty weird but interesting?  My drink was smaller compared to the rest of my group's but as they say good things come in small packages... so I like to believe mine was the best.  I'm just kidding.  I was pretty happy with my drink choice and the taste was fairly complex (complex...doesn't that sound like I know what I'm talking about? ha).  When you first sip it, it tastes sweet and caramel-y but then there's an aftertaste of smoky-ness.  I tried a sip of my friend's ""Go Go Bordello"" which had Letherbee, Lemon, Hibiscus, Champagne and it was good as well. I recommend coming here for a date or with one or two friends but it's hard with a larger group unless you intentionally don't want to mingle with everyone (wink).  The music is a bit too loud and you have to strain your voice to have a conversation.  I would suggest they lower the volume of the music especially if they're going for the ""classy"" vibe.  Check out Violet Hour for some craft cocktails and a reason to dress up!",0.9972,0.804,0.157,0.039,0.5561288998357962

2014-11-25,2.0,"A friend of mine lives down the block and after an early dinner at Cumin we decided to stop in.  There was no line as you might see here later in the evening so we thought it might be a good quick, post-dinner stop.  We get to the door and there were two men and two women.  The person at the door said we had to wait outside for a few minutes.  I thought we must have been the first people to start a line so no big deal.  We waited for about ten minutes when we were finally let in and I was momentarily relieved until I saw there was a second line in the door.  That was very poor management of expectations.  Given that we were all dressed professionally since we had just come from work and were clearly  not looking for some sort of clubby or tourist experience, they could have simply said 'it's going to be a half hour wait' and we would have left...no big deal.  Well we waited on the inside for another half hour so our total wait was about 45 minutes.  We would have left but we felt so invested at that point that we wanted our drinks!  On their website they have the following, ""The Violet Hour does not accept reservations. We operate on a first come first served basis.""  I guess security didn't get that message cause the long wait was due to roughly 20 people coming in directly from outside and getting a table ahead of us.  Again, a simple managing of expectations would have been appreciated. After getting in, I was pleasantly surprised to like the decor.  It was a bit stuffy but in an upscale, 'this is a place to be seen' type of way.  The bathrooms were very nice and the place in general was good.  I did think the music volume was too high.  They are presenting a loungy atmosphere but we couldn't really talk to each other given the loudness level.  The one saving grace was our server, Samantha.  She was extremely pleasant and friendly.  After explaining my taste preference, she said a drink that is no longer on their menu (the name escapes me at the moment) would be best.  My companions all ordered drinks as well.  All were okay but not great.  When going to a place such as this, I do expect fresh flavors and creative cocktails.  They really fell flat across the board.  Again, not bad, but not great.  I am used to inventive, balanced cocktails like from Punch House or Acadia.  Overall for the price point and wait, this place is overrated.  Also managing clientele expectations would likely help here.  Service was very good though.",0.9955,0.79,0.16,0.05,0.41811434450323337
2014-11-23,4.0,"I've been to The Violet Hour a few times. I love how the front door is meant to look undistinguished. The first time I went, my friend and I walked by twice before realizing where it was. I've heard this place gets pretty busy which is why I've always made it a point to go a little early and on weeknights so I can walk right in. (Full disclosure: as an early riser, 10pm is my cut off time).  The ambiance was trendy and the lighting very dim. The mood felt a bit contrived. The drinks were fantastic, I can't remember what I had except I went with one of their signature drinks both times. It was heaven in a glass.  I enjoyed myself at The Violet Hour both times I've gone. That said, I feel neither here nor there about going or not going back again. I'm giving The Violet Hour a solid 4 stars because it was really good. It wasn't exceptional, especially in this city where there is so much competition for exciting and unique places of the hour.",0.9819,0.823,0.166,0.011,0.5703933747412008

2014-11-16,1.0,"Wow. I'm still in shock at the racially charged comments that were told to me at this place. OK, I am Japanese American. I am 100% Japanese American. My family has lived here for decades, even fighting in WWII and living through the internments. I look Japanese; for those of you who don't get it, I look ASIAN. I am from California and I try to be as politically correct as possible, and I hate hearing people use racist comments, which is why I am so amazed by the Violet Hour. I honestly...don't know where to start. I came here with my friends, including a friend who was visiting from California. My boyfriend and I were the last to leave of our group and as we were leaving, the waitress approached us. The waitress wanted to know why we didn't tip well. I didn't partake in paying the tab, as my boyfriend was paying, so I had no idea what we had tipped. Normally, I tip 15% at minimum. Initially, I thought damn this waitress has balls asking us about our tab, but after really thinking about it, I thought that she had been a good waitress and I was curious how much we had paid. After a few minutes, her manager came over to take over the ""situation"". This manager questioned our bill, just as our waitress had, and in all honesty, listening to it, I wanted to hear why our group had tipped so poorly. I explained that I would love to pay more, even offering my card, because, really the service was immaculate and our server was great. I guess our friends just didn't agree with the prices and didn't really understand why this place was so....highly rated. I was one of the people who had suggested to go to this place; I was one of the people who told my friends that the drinks were good. I never expected to be approached and questioned about my payment choices. After discussing with this manager, he continued talking with my boyfriend while I was about to walk out and leave. My boyfriend continued to explain that our friends didn't understand the ""experience"", and agreed with the manager that this type of place is ""not for everyone"". During that conversation, my boyfriend asked, ""what exactly is the theme of this place?"", which in all honesty is a strong, real question, because, really, what exactly are you paying for? A dark room with tiny booths and expensive drinks. It's an honest question to ask what the general theme is supposed to be, considering what you're paying. The manager then turned to him and told him and the rest of us, ""Go ask your grandparents."" At first...this really didn't mean anything to me, but as I thought about it, I continued to get more and more angry. Most of our group look obviously Asian and those that had stayed for this conversation were obviously Asian. Who are you to say that to me? My grandpa fought and earned a Purple Heart in WWII, while his entire family was interned in horse stalls. He fought for FREEDOM, the FREEDOM that I have today, the FREEDOM that you have today as a minority, the FREEDOM to not judge others based on what they look like; I just...cannot believe he asked me that. If either of my grandparents were still alive for me to ask this question, they would probably respond that Violet Hour is a place that they could never attend. This is a place that only existed in their dreams, because a. my grandpa is out fighting in a war away from my family or b. my grandma is locked into a tiny horse stall and cannot even get privacy to use the restroom. Who the eff is this guy to QUESTION where my family had come from, where they had been? We are not some random rich family demanding ridiculous service. I had offered more money and this man REFUSED to consider the actions of his words; WHERE anyone other than him or his family had been. I am absolutely in shock and awe and will be calling tomorrow to complain. There is no reason that someone should be confronted with such blatant racism and lack of respect, no matter who you are. Please do not go here. I do think that people here work hard and deserve better pay, but please do not support racism and the attack of minorities.",0.9906,0.749,0.138,0.113,0.45557909604519764

2014-11-09,3.0,"The Violet Hour has been bookmarked as a ""to try"" place for a few years, but I've been putting it off because I don't really drink alcohol. The stars aligned in Wicker Park last night and we found ourselves waiting in line at The Violet Hour. I realized that I've walked by it several times, including the times I've been to Big Star, which is right across the street from it. The door is very nondescript. If it were not for the line, we might have had trouble finding it at all! There is no big neon sign that says ""The Violet Hour.""  We got in line at 10:15 on a Friday night and waited for ~45 minutes before we were seated. If it were any colder, we would have ditched the line for somewhere more casual, but after waiting 25 minutes or so, we realized we had reached the point of no return. We had waited this long; we just had to go through with it! We finally got inside, where there was another line behind a curtain. We were thankful that the heat was on full blast, but people kept standing with the door open, letting cold air in. They had trouble listening to the host/bouncer, so he had to wade through the packed-like-sardines crowd to close the door. We listened to The Clash playing in the other from our spot in line. Limbo. The host kept coming out and asking each of us how many were in our party. Some people were visibly frustrated that different-sized parties were being seated before them who were far behind them in line.  I'm on the third paragraph of my review and we haven't even made it to our table at The Violet Hour yet! We were finally seated with two in very high, comfy chairs and one sitting on a backless stool. I really liked that we felt enclosed in a booth with really high walls--almost like being in our own private section. Very intimate and, as others have mentioned, a worthy date spot. I didn't like that the third chair seemed like an add-on, though. I think there should be at least a few acceptable three-chair configurations. We perused the menu and each decided on a different cocktail. I had my first cocktail ever (trumpets were blaring; it was quite the occasion)! It had rum in it and was called national something (so descriptive, I know).  I tried all three of our drinks and found them all delicious!  Service was exceptional and completely on point. Our water vase was promptly refilled when we ran out. Service was swift; we didn't have to wait long for our drinks. Our experience was excellent after actually getting inside. I got a $13 cocktail, excellent ambiance, and excellent service. We weren't rushed at ALL even though we knew there was a boatload of people waiting just outside those curtains. I'm torn between three and four stars, based on our experience. I'm going to go for three this time because my guy's gin martini wasn't properly mixed. For that price, it should have been 100% on point.  I will definitely be back and next time I'll come at an off time on a weekday to avoid the line. I'm sure I would be more wow'd if I didn't have to wait for so long! I certainly understand the appeal of The Violet Hour and I definitely got sucked in.

2014-10-21,5.0,"Awesome place. We went for a date on a Saturday, arriving at 8:25pm and waited for about an hour before we made it inside. One annoyance was when people who were meeting up with larger parties who had already moved inside were ushered in with no explanation to those of us who were close to the door. But I get it.  Once inside, the interior is fantastic. It's a low-light loungy atmosphere, with tall chairs and intimate smaller tables, with some booths along the side of one room.  The decor is simple, but somehow makes the place more alluring (I know that sounds ridiculous, but it does).  We were seated at the bar (which seemed common for groups of two) which I was initially disappointed about, but I ended up really enjoying it because we had a front-row seat for the actual crafting of the cocktails. Watching our bartender was great. He was very knowledgeable and was able to make items off the menu if you told him what you liked. My fiance and I stuck to the items on the menu. I had the Rex Banner, which I highly recommend for bourbon fans. I then tried a dark rum drink, which was good but not great. I finished with their classic Old Fashioned (which is my favorite drink). It was very, very good, although I think I prefer Au Cheval's by a littttttle bit. My fiance had two vodka based cocktails which were fruitier (not my style), but very good. The drinks were very well balanced with a bunch of flavors rolling over the tongue as you processed each sip.  I was considering taking a star off because of how long the wait is, but that's really a product of supply and demand and not any fault of the bar itself. If they chose to, they could pack the bar with standing guests, but they do not allow any standing room and the experience once inside is much more comfortable. We also loved the no cell phone rule, although I did catch myself reaching into my pocket a few times to check the time.

We had the choice of sitting at the bar or in the lounge. We chose the lounge. The atmosphere was intimate, clean, and comfortable. We ended up sitting across from each other and close to two different parties on both sides of us, which was a bummer because we could barely hear each other. The drinks were great. I ordered two rum cocktails and they were beautifully made and refreshing.  One thing that surprised me was the attire of the rest of the people there. When we had visited the website, we got the sense that attire needed to be classy, but we saw a lot of people in jeans. Besides the few hiccups, it was a great experience and we are definitely going to go again! Next time, though, I know I don't have to wear my black cocktail dress and heels, and maybe pick a more intimate seating.",0.9927,0.762,0.222,0.016,0.6045454545454546

2014-09-15,3.0,"I came here with my daughter and her friend.  My daughter was especially excited to come here because it was considered a Speakeasy and something she wanted to experience.  I was curious what a modern-day Speakeasy would be like, since the originals where places to drink during prohibition.  So by today's standards it seems to mean a place that is hard to find, (no outside sign) which this place was.  Also they specialize in old-school cocktails, which I really had no idea what that meant.  They do have a small sign that gives an idea of what is not acceptable.  And I have been told that some Speakeasies require a password to enter, which this one did not.   There was a line to get in but we didn't wait more than 20 minutes and we were there on a Saturday night around 8 pm. Drinks are not cheap, $13.00 on average, but after all it is Chicago.  The atmosphere is very dark, and the music too loud.    The have light bites.  We sampled two.  I don't recall their names but one was similar to bruschetta but with goat cheese and the other was fries with aioli dip. I enjoyed both.  Our total bill for three people was $90 which included two mixed drinks each and the food. Our waiter was very good.  I am a cosmo drinker but those are on the banned list for this place so he recommended another drink that he thought I might like.  I don't recall all the ingredients other than vodka and blackberries, and it was good.   I don't know when the emergence of these neo-nouveau Speakeasies came into existence and I kinda wonder if it is just a fad and they will disappear.  Anyway, it was fun.   Worth doing once but probably not twice.",0.9767,0.851,0.114,0.035,0.5230072463768115

So they have a narrow entrance.  Yes. they probaly designed it that way and thought it was cool at the time. So when you let people wait in there, people are not going to stay in a rigid single file line along the narrow entrance.  So when BouncerGuy yells at people to clear the way in his douchy ""you're lucky you're near the front of the line and about to get in"" way, i'm kinda less excited to go in. Then you're in curtain purgatory - you've passed the first curtain, but there's still another curtain to go through before you get into the space.  The music is loud, so yelling is necessary to tell you to get out of the way because people are coming out.  Oh wait. or is BouncerGuy telling you to come in? I can't tell because I can't hear him and he's making some hand motion near the 2nd curtain/entrance.  Should i come in? I take a few tenative steps in BouncerGuy's direction to better hear him, but this is a mistake as ""PEOPLE ARE COMING OUT!!"" he yells! *Shoves us to the side*   Then i remember why I don't come here any more.  The BouncerGuys are rude! I don't appreciate being yelled at and herded like cattle, and the same sh*t happened the last time i was here two years ago!

As soon as we got in, the main room was VERY dimly lit really giving it that speakeasy sort of feel to it.

They have both a limited drink menu which seasonally changes as well as a regular menu featuring classic cocktails and a list of all liquor with descriptions of they have on shelf.  Original intention when stopping by here was maybe a round or two for a night cap, but ended up stick around for 4 rounds. Yup, cocktails were that great and our waitress knew each of the cocktails on the menu really well so no problem helping us find drinks we liked.

We all ordered different drinks and there wasn't a bum one in the mix. We got two rounds and all the drinks were artfully crafted and incredibly tasty. Also the drink size was good for the price.

We got in line at around 11 pm on a Friday night and waited for no more than a few minutes. The atmosphere was swanky, and we were greeted by our server, Benjamin. He was extremely attentive and had a very upbeat personality. The cocktails were out of this world. As a general manager of a craft cocktail bar in Omaha, I was very impressed by the creativity of their cocktails.

We did have to stand in line for like two minutes and then we were escorted in, which gives it a somewhat VIP feel.  The specs in this place are very simple and elegant, giving it not as much of a speak-easy feel as I had expected, as the tones of the room are very warm. Looks more like Classic French... Anyway we were seated at the bar near the fruit station, therefore, the smells were amazing as they zested oranges and lemons.  We tried a variety of drinks on their cocktail menu. My favorite was the ""la Papala"" (I think that was what it was called). It was a tequila drink with some bitters and lime and what tasted like cinnamon. It was very different and extremely tasty. I would get it again.  Overall the drinks were great and they had one of the mixologists acting as resident Dj. He was killing it with a good selection of chill wave that I'm sure every hipster and their cousin was enjoying. The guy was a little introverted and acted kind of like he didn't want to be bothered when we asked him questions, which is why I downgraded it. However, I would still go back because of the good chill vibes and great drinks.  The only thing that would have made this night better would have been if Big Star hadn't closed down their order window early!

If you don't know where it is you will undoubtedly pass the entrance by and this is far from a tourist hang out.  Once inside there are large velvet curtains and an intimately decorated bar and seating area.  We sat at the bar and found an incredible menu of one of a kind cocktails. We ordered a couple cocktails and the awesome bartenders worked their magic. I have had a lot of cocktails, some high end cocktails and even some that I would consider carefully hand crafted cocktails. The Violet Hour blows them all away.  Imagine tasting 10 different characteristics in every sip of a cocktail and you might come close. The flavors of the different ingredients was mind blowing. We had a blast sipping few cocktails here which are deceivingly strong. My favorite had to be the journey from Milan to Minsk. The staff was incredibly friendly, skillful and helpful. The drinks are priced on the high side but this is not a place you go for a gin and tonic or a whiskey sour. If you truly appreciate artisanal quality cocktails this is THE place for you.  I understand it can get pretty crowded on busy nights and due to the time and skill that goes into every drink I could see it taking a long time to get inside. We did not try any of their food but from what others ordered it looked good. If you can afford it this place would probably really impress a date.

The signature cocktails were all fabulous, and $13. Cell phones are discouraged, which make it a great place for date-nights! The service was prompt. The only downfall is the long weekend waits.

2014-07-07,1.0,"So i finally made it out to the Violet Hour to experience ""One of Chicago's Greatest Cocktails"".  Unfortunately, the four cocktails me and my group ordered fell well below expectations.   I ordered a cocktail named The Boss, being a fan of both whiskey and coffee I figured perfect match.  While the cocktail was not bad it was also not good; therefore not enjoyable just drank it since i ordered it a type of cocktail. It did however taste almost exactly as this Japanese Coffee that sells in a small black can called ""Boss"".     My friend ordered the Violet Hour Old Fashioned, anticipating a mix drink, since it was on the cocktail menu.  It turned out to be whiskey on the rocks with a little extra liquid spices mixed into it.  Another cocktail my other friend tried was the ""Erotic Journey through something, and it had a very overwhelming mixture taste to it to the point she had only two sips and made her BF chug the rest.  Lastly, my gf ordered a cocktail that turned out to be a bitter mojito, not sure what the name of it was.  Not terrible but it did make my face cringe after each gulp. The seating arrangements are okay, these chairs with high stiff backs that almost make you feel as if you are sitting in your own private booth.  The staff was friendly, it did however take the waiter 10 minutes to initially reach our table to take our orders.  The bar area is really well done and really cool.  Really draws your attention there when walking in.  The rest of the decor, while somewhat cool,  it does have a relatively bland and cold feeling to it,  So, to sum it up: Did not like cocktails, Bar area awesome, lounge area lifeless Try it out for yourself since it is an attraction in the Chicago bar scene.",0.9805,0.831,0.125,0.044,0.5859159159159157
2014-06-30,5.0,"Is this place pretentious?  Sure it is.  But is it worth a visit?  Absolutely! I write this review with full knowledge that this place isn't for everyone.  If you just want to chill out in a neighborhood bar and have some beers for a reasonable price, then steer clear of this place. But if you're in the mood for something different, this is worth checking out. I was visiting Chicago on vacation and wanted to visit a few places off the beaten path that aren't your typical tourist haunts.  I read about this place and decided that I wanted to go out of my way to see it for myself.  The website intrigued me, as well as the miscellaneous reviews I was reading about it. I do enjoy traditional speakeasies, and this place definitely fits the bill, but almost exaggerated to looking like something conjured in a David Lynch movie with its dark, gothic decor. I wanted to have fun with it and surprise my girlfriend when I brought her here by pulling her into a random door on the street into this place, but the fun was ruined by a doorman out front (not sure why he was out there -- there was no line whatsoever) and some employee poking his head out the door talking to him.  So it kinda ruined the surprise, but oh well.  She was still amazed at how random it was to have a nice bar behind an unmarked door. We were seated immediately and had fun looking over the menu finding the right cocktail.  At $13 a drink, you kinda want to get it right the first time. My first drink was a tad bitter, and my girlfriend had a similar reaction to hers.  But the following couple of drinks we got were delicious.  I always appreciate the art of mixology. We even got a couple of free drinks from the bartender when he heard that we were from Omaha, which is where he was from too.  This was a great gesture, especially because we weren't even sitting at the bar, but we overheard him talking about Omaha to the people sitting near him, and we mentioned to our waitress that we were also from there, which she passed along to him. Our waitress, Alyssa, was excellent and very cordial.  In fact, all the staff members we dealt with were all extremely nice, and not stuffy at all, like I had worried. The atmosphere is very casual and laid back.  I really enjoyed the music playing, even though I only recognized one song out of everything I heard.  All of it was very obscure, and it wasn't playing too loud to the point of being obnoxious and preventing pleasant conversation. The rule of not using cell phones is really a great idea, as it forces you to interact with your company.  So be sure you bring people with you that you actually enjoy conversing with! Overall, I really loved this place, and I am so glad I sought out this hidden gem.  Do your research before coming here to decide if this is the right place for you, and if you're on the fence, try it anyway!  This is a great experience, even if the prices are a tad steep.",0.9985,0.753,0.203,0.044,0.583160173160173
2014-06-29,5.0,"True speakeasy with a lot of rules, and a little bit of pretentiousness. But totally worth it. Note (that you may already know): There's no sign for the place. You just need to find it--but it isn't that hard bc 1. There might be a line around it already or 2. Just find a wooden wall with some kind of mural right across from Big Star.  It's really one of the best cocktail bars in the city. They really treat their drinks as a form of art. Their menu changes seasonally (so does their art/ mural outside), although there's few items that's always on the menu. If you had something you liked before, you can always ask for it again even if it's not on the current menu. Great old fashions, and they have the coolest ice too! I know it may seem silly but they have different ice for each drinks/ cups; for example, they carve the ice to be spherical for rocks glasses. And they use a special machine or method to freeze the ice so it's clear as possible. I know a handful of bars do this, but VH has been doing it quite sometime since been around, and it's still cool.  The wait might be long in the weekends but it's because they don't allow people in unless there's seating/ table available, so there's nobody standing around. Going on a weekday makes it stress free with no wait. If not, go a little early, make it a start of your night.

2014-05-26,4.0,"This review came a bit late, but during my short week in chicago, I have heard quite a bit about this place. And I have to conclude, that it is indeed a cool place to chill. Like many other modern-day speakeasy bar, the entrance is hidden. It blends together with a wall that is covered with graffiti (though I think the decoration on the wall may change occasionally). Once inside, you may find that you have to wait in line. If so, no worries! It will give you some time to review the rules for the place, i.e. stop texting the person that SHOULD have been here and hang out with the person that IS here. My friends and I went in the middle of the week so we did not have to wait so long. We were sat in a somewhat small booth with very very dim lighting and struggled a bit to read the menu. However, the cocktail server came over and gave us a very comprehensive description of what was on the menu along with a few recommendations. The menu was impressive, with a good variety for each type of liquor to appeal to different tastes (bold and strong vs. subtle and sweet or sour). Looking back, I wonder why I didn't take any pictures because now I can't exactly remember what I had for a second round, but I do know for sure that I had the Oaxacan Vacation as the first drink (mainly because it is a mezcal and I LOVE mezcal). It had a nice smokey flavor to it with a subtle sense of refreshment from the cucumber. The egg white along with the lime and agave always left a sweet and sour aftertaste on your lips after each sips. Definitely a good choice. As for food wise, I went with the poutine in light that the saltiness would go well with the smokiness from the drink. The different types of flavor (salty meat, cheesy/mustardy taste ) all came together to make a pretty decent dish. Though I have to say that it was a bit too salty for my taste. After a couple of conversations with the server, she found out that we were all from out of town and decided to give us each a shot of some sort of locally crafted liquor. The shot was strong, with a bold juniper berry-like flavor. It was a good way to close the night out. Overall, a great speakeasy place to be. Just be warned that due to its popularity and size of the place, I'm assuming that it is probably packed on the weekend. Do I recommend it?

Being from NY I felt compelled to go to The Violet Hour since I heard it was such a great lounge with exotic cocktails. I had a great experience it was intimate and reserved, so I could sit with my boyfriend and relax and not worry about anyone looking over at us. I've read a lot of the bad reviews and they're really petty and unjustified. One spoke about how pretentious the place was. It's a Speak-Easy inspired bar, it's not going to have their name on the door and the bartenders are going to be wearing uniforms to match the feeling of the restaurant. At $13 for a cocktail, which by the way, you won't find most of the craft and hard work that goes into creating a cocktail such as the ones on the menu in just about any other bar or lounge..not to mention the exotic ingredients and liqueurs. That $13 for a single cocktail is easily worth the price just based on that. And you go to any other city, especially NY and $13 couldn't buy you a cocktail of the same caliber. Stop taking the service industry for granted. Customers believe that they are gods gift to the restaurant they are visiting. Just relax, if they're busy that's a good thing your at the right place. The drinks are hard to make, give them some time to make it. Stop acting like your Jesus Christ reincarnate that just walked in and instead have a good time.

Every question about the menu was met with as short an answer as possible designed to try to make us feel stupid and be as unhelpful as possible while still responding to the question (""Giving you a recommendation would be like guessing your favorite song."" and ""How could i choose between those two dishes?"") Well after I finished my first drink our waitress was nowhere to be seen and no one in our party had any interest in speaking to her, so I walked to the bar to order my own. 10 minutes later (well after everyone was done with their round) our waitress finally showed up to inform me my drink was third in line. I was the only one who ordered a second and our group had dinner plans so I canceled our drink and paid our bill.  As we left I recounted our experience to the manager at the bar who stared at me like I was speaking a foreign language and was only able to offer ""uhhh... OK..?"" when I finished. I literally spent 2 minutes telling him how miserable our experience at his bar was and he was so dimwitted that he was unable to offer any words of apology or concern. What a manager!

The ambiance inside is awesome! It was quite dark, really intimate and had a cool setup for groups or dates. I almost needed a flashlight for the menu, but each table had a candle light that was just enough. The waiter had many recommendations and knew the menu pretty extensively. I tried a couple of the drinks and they were all pretty good. The price is a little hefty, but it is worth it. I tried the fries to munch on as well, which came out piping hot. I had a really good experience and it was a combination of everything the Violet Hour had to offer. I will be back the next time I am in Chicago!",0.9918,0.792,0.208,0.0,0.5325757575757575

Naturally, the cabbie that took us here didn't even know we were at the right place (there was a bank and a diner; the front door of this place was a painted-over plywood plank, with no signage).  As we were waiting in line, a schmuck (wannabe Zach Galifianakis) and his pothead girlfriend were trying to crack jokes and pulled a fast one on me (palmed my face during a knock knock joke). Too bad I was stunned thinking, WTF just happened, otherwise I would have gut punched the guy.  Anyway, we made it in (and the bow tied bouncer took those two hippies aside, possibly for violating dress code) and were seated at booths with high sides.  They do a decent job creating an 1890's atmosphere. But the drink selection is where this place falls short. First of all, the drink menu was like 20 pages. No joke. It was like studying for a final exam - by candlelight. At least they got the era right.  Each one of our seven drinks had some weird issue with it, from tasting like a wet bandaid (one of the whiskies), to an overly sweet tequila with egg foam, to a slightly medicinal-tasting brandy concoction.  My take: just because it is creative (e.g. Szechuan peppercorns in a cocktail), doesn't make it good. Sorry.",-0.3128,0.817,0.087,0.096,0.6213528138528139

Went to dinner, it was still early, so we decided to go somewhere for drinks.  When we pulled up, I was wondering, ""What the heck is this place, and why is there a line?"".  I hate places where you have to stand in line but it honestly was about a 5 to 10 minute wait and was so worth it.  Also, there was no sign on the door so I was really wondering about this place, we started walking away until a man came out of the door to ask us how many in our party, we said two and he said ok, it won't be long. He was right, it wasn't long at all.  When he spoke to us, he seemed so cool, calm, and nice (nothing like when you stand in line at a club) so we decided to stay. Anyway, this was Saturday around midnight.  You wait in line because you are waiting to be seated and it was well worth it. When you walk in you walk through these long curtains and when you get inside it is so dim and everyone is just sitting around drinking and forced to actually have conversations since no cell phone use is allowed. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THAT PART!! Especially since we are so consumed with our cell phones now-a-days.  Yes, humans speak to each other here, like real conversation. So after we walk through the curtains a hostess takes you to where you will be seated but while we were walking, she was asking us questions about our day.  She was the friendliest hostess I have ever met, EVER!.   We were seated by a fireplace, which was so nice, comfy and cozy.  We looked through the menus, ordered pickles and cheese and a couple of drinks to start with. I ordered some kind of punch that had cognac in it, and it was so GOOD.  The bartenders aren't just bartenders, they have to be mixologists.  Now I know the difference.

You will be lost, VERY lost, if you don't know where it is. The door hides in a mural & if there is no line outside, you will just keep walking by aimlessly.  2. We waited 15 mins in the cold until we were finally let in.  3. Once inside, there was another line, in a dark hallway, where the only thing you can see are curtains. The bouncer came and asked everyone in the ""inside line"" how many in their party. We said two and waited about 10 more minutes. I was determined, damnit. Don't judge lol. This also kept us in suspense to see wtf was behind the set of curtains.  4. Once in the front, we were asked if we wanted a booth or the bar. We opted for the bar and I'm glad we chose it. One of bartenders made the night. He was cool, with a seriously amazingggg mustache that belongs on the cover of hipster mag (does one exist? If not, one should).  5. Though Stache dude was right on, our particular bartender, assigned to take care of our side, was kind of rude and didn't make any suggestions. He seemed as if being at his job was a chore instead of a bad Ass job at a bad Ass bar. Get with the program, guy. He was not a people person like the other BT, unfortunately. But the drinks he made were legit so it made up for his bleh attitude.  6. The vibe in there is very swanky. You can't make phone calls, they don't let you use your phone unless it's for a pic. Rules everywhere. It's basically a speak easy.  7. The booths were cool, with some high chairs that reminds you of Alice in Wonderland.  8. The drink prices are STEEP. $15 or so per drink.  9.

I hope they don't reuse it, because it is SO tempting to lick it after you're done drinking what it was chilling. Conclusion: Definitely come here for the mood, and the strong drinks to boot.

2014-01-24,5.0,"Spectacular handcrafted cocktails!  I would list my favorite drinks, but they change the menu seasonally, so there is always something new and exciting that is begging for me to try it.  Every bartender and waiter/waitress knows everything about everything on the menu and is more than willing to talk you through your selection, with patience, without pretentiousness.  They have a small menu of appetizers and bar snacks that are really good as well.  We usually stop here after work, before we head to another place for dinner in Wicker Park.   The atmosphere and ambiance are amazing.  Great for a night out with friends or an intimate date, or a place to have great drinks, apps and catch up with a friend or 2.  They have rotating seasonal punches, that are served in a glass punch bowl, usually over a gigantic ice block, that are great for groups.  Very fun.  If you go during a prime time on a Thurs-Sat, you will likely have to wait (outside).  The wait for a party of 2 will be substantially less vs. a big group. In my humble opinion, the wait is well worth what you get inside the bar - a guaranteed seat, space to move and enjoy yourself.  During the early week or right when they open, we frequently walk right in.   Keep your eyes peeled for the door handle when you are looking for the bar, there is a mural on the exterior walls that changes frequently, and no windows.  Watch for the door opening and closing - your amazing cocktail experience is waiting for you inside!",0.9964,0.749,0.221,0.031,0.5167546897546899

Had to wait outside as there was a line, and since it was December, needless to say it wasn't warm. I think they need to rethink their 'no reservations' policy. I say allow reservations for groups of 5 or more. Their waiting vestibule with heaters is not that big, so a lot of people end up waiting outside. And for what?  Average drinks at a place with no particularly creative decor and no cell phone use?  Sadly, Violet Hour was one and done deal for me.  There are so many other places that you can get into without standing outside, that have better decor and at least just as good drinks.  So again, torn between 2 and 3 stars.

Downside tho, they stop serving food way too early. I remember asking them one time that I would settle for peanuts but they said 'Kitchen is close,' that kinda shock me bec how hard is it to get peanuts out of a jar/bowl .

Luckily one of the girls in our group of four knew exactly where it was and it's easily locatable just by looking at the long line out front. After waiting about 40 minutes, 20 minutes outside and 20 minutes inside we were seated in an incredible ambiance with incredibly high backed chairs.  Their drink list is long and very creative. I had the ""Well Traveled"" which was sweet but incredible. I'm not usually a big brandy drinker but this drink definitely hit the spot. After that I had to try their house Old Fashioned which is my favorite go to drink and they made it on point. I had no qualms with either of the drinks and definitely want to go back to try all the others. For food, we ordered: Frites and Aioli - Fries and mayonnaise to the max. How can you go wrong? However the fries were perfectly cooked and not soggy which seems to be difficult for some places to figure out. Smoked Arctic Char - This was good, but it seemed like the Char wasn't incredibly fresh. It's ""fishiness"" was kind of intense which is usually not found in fresher fish. Grilled Goat Cheese & Tomato Jam - After realizing that the jam and cheese are HOT and burning the roof of my mouth as a reminder of drunken pizza nights, the flavor was delicious and really hit the spot.  Smoked Prosciutto and Melon Skewers - They were good, you can't really mess this up. All in all, it was a great place. The only qualm I had with it was the music genre kept changing. When we walked in it was great, chill lounge music at around 930pm. Around 11pm though, it slowly transitioned into rap which seemed like it killed the mood.

2013-12-31,5.0,"Finally had my first Violet Hour experience and I have to say...this place is as cool as everyone says.  And I think the coolest thing about Violet Hour is that they don't try to be that cool.  They're just really really good at what they do.  I'll admit that getting in can be difficult depending on the time and day that you go.  We picked this past Saturday evening, but showed up early, around 7 and we were immediately seated (granted, it was probably the last open table available).  But the nice thing about VH, is that once you're in, you're in.  That means you get a table, enough seats for every member of your party, and a server.  You're not fighting for a drink at the bar.  You're not pushing through people to get some personal space.  There are no random bystanders standing up in all the open places, crowding the place up. There is something to be said about a place that could easily make much more money each night if they allowed their venue to get filled up. But they want the experience to be intimate for each customer.  They want each person to fully appreciate the artistry that is their drink-making, and I'm a big fan of that.  I had expected the atmosphere to be very trendy and modern.  But instead, I was surprised to see a very vintage and simple decor.  Violet Hour has the feel and atmosphere of an 1800s house, old and classic furniture and decor.   Our party of 5 was seated immediately, in a cozy booth.  Our server was very friendly and helpful.  I was expecting a bit of a snooty vibe from Violet Hour, given the hype.  But not so.  Our server had no problem taking time to explain to us what each drink was like and explain flavors and textures of various combinations. I went with the Figaro for my first drink, which is a fig flavored rendition of a Manhattan.  I typically find Manhattans just slightly stiff for my taste, and the Figaro offered the same punch in the gut of whiskey, with a light softness. The lighter and refreshing rum cocktail I chose afterwards was a nice contrast since it was clear that another one of their whiskey drinks would have me on the floor. We ordered a couple light bites and found that not only does Violet Hour have the best cocktails in town, but the best fries too. AMAZING fries. So amazing that we immediately ordered a second round before we were halfway thru the first order. Perfectly crispy and the right thinness. Violet Hour is always changing up their menu and adding new creations. I can't wait to go back soon and try their latest.

There were these two couples who sent their gf in to see if they could just get a seat right away, came back out, the boyfriends gave the gf about $50 and they were able to get a table without waiting at all. Bribery consists anywhere - just thought its interesting. I came with a party of 5. 3 of my friends got too cold waiting inside so they went some where else and now its just two of us. Got a table about 10mins after they left. We asked the hostess of my friends could come back and join us because they're from out of town. The hostess said she will check to see if there's an open table. After a few mins, she was able to give us a table of 5. HOWEVER, the guy/bouncer, came to our table telling us for future reference don't try to use that trick to skip a head of the line. I told him I am sorry, I didn't mean to. I found that very rude of him to say that to the customers. My theory of business is customers are always right, even if they are not. Drinks are decent at reasonable price. Atmosphere is nice. Music is kinda loud with lots of people talking. Wait service is great. I am just not happy with the bouncer guy and the wait. I probably would not come back if I have to wait in line again. If I were to spend $50 to make that happen, I'd rather go to a nice hotel bar and get drinks and better view of the city.

I remain as enchanted as I was that first time, when I walked right past the hidden entrance, and then finally, excitedly pushed past the thick velvet curtains to the coolest lounge I've ever been in. I can't say much that hasn't been said. The atmosphere is perfection - it's like if the Addams Family redecorated Wonderland for Alice, who insisted she get to keep the furniture. Looming blue couches and chairs of leather, elegant chandelier, and dim, dim lights.  The cocktails are incredible. Multi-layered, expertly crafted sips of heaven, all much stronger than they appear, and more delicious than their titles let on. Tonight I had the Apron Strings - I'm a sucker for their drinks that incorporate egg white - and I think it was my favorite yet. Sweet cherry bitters, spicy ginger syrup, and of course, vodka. I've heard the owners of Violet Hour are connoisseurs of whiskey, and actually do NOT like vodka (you'll note the fewest offerings on the menu are their vodka cocktails), but every vodka drink I've had there is to die for. They're more awe-worthy than satisfying, but their small plates are a treat as well. In the past, we've had nibbles of wasabi, charcuterie, and deep fried candy bars - all delicious. Tonight nothing caught my eye, but now that I think about it, I may need to try the pimento cheese toasts in the near future. If you want to impress a first date, or any date, or have an actual intimate conversation with friends, or want a deliciously stealthy drink, or let's be real - if you're within a 50 mile radius of wicker park - you need to try The Violet Hour. It's sophistication that's still fun, which is perhaps the most difficult atmosphere to create successfully.",0.9974,0.716,0.236,0.048,0.5045296167247388
2013-12-09,4.0,"This place is definitely a very cool and swanky bar. It's got the mood lighting (aka almost none), comfortable seats (kind of) and overpriced drinks.  Though, all joking aside, this place does live up to the hype. Now, that being said, I probably wouldn't come here again and wait for 45 minutes-1 hour just to get in (unless I'm on a date, in which case, this is a perfect date spot). Our waitress knew her drinks, and was able to rattle off a few of her favorites. I tried the Rum Diary, Kingmaker and Figaro. The Rum Diary was light and sweet, and would be a perfect drink to start your night with. The Kingmaker was pretty much a stronger Old Fashioned. Now the Figaro, that's a real drink. Smooth yet strong. Smokey and earthy. Pretty sure I grew a mustache after drinking it. Anyways, this place is awesome in small doses.

2013-12-03,4.0,"I do love this place. Like all hidden gems, it has become almost too popular in the last few months- and now it's difficult to come here without it being too busy. We heard about it in October of 2012 and got excited by the hidden door/door man/speak easy vibe.  It's still a great place, but I do miss when they used to quietly play old 1930's and 1940s music in the bar, and not the very loud hipstery remastered versions of popular music. It's hard to hear now, and before it was very quiet and subdued and with the low lighting and high backed seemed almost like a step back in time. Now it just seems like a hip Wicker Park bar. I miss the nostalgia.  But the good outweighs the bad, and I too am one of those people who still waits in line to come in - it's just slightly less frequent now, especially when it's cold because the line goes out onto the sidewalk.  The menu changes regularly, which I really like because they make many of their own simple syrups and bitters- so the cocktails are phenomenal. They raised the prices from 12$ to 13$, but we usually go for a cocktail or 2, and then head to dinner, or use this place as a nightcap.

2013-11-19,5.0,"Take some curtains and crown molding; lower the lights, and there you have Violet Hour. I must admit the first time I visited here it was hard to find the front door. I did have to ask people walking in the general area. In blatant contrast to the bar's interior, the exterior of the building has no windows that I remember. Much different than what you would expect, there is just a wall of graffiti. This is the perfect modern-day way to hide a speakeasy in plain sight. Especially in Wicker Park, where art is everywhere.  Once you open the door, you must pass through a curtain, and then, almost like a scene out of Twin Peaks, more thick and heavy curtains create a small lobby with a tiny stool situated in the far left-hand corner. You cannot see past these curtains at all. There is no space to peek through, just to check that nothing will be waiting to grab you from the other side. Nope, you must force your way through the curtains. If there is a host waiting in this little lobby, they will direct you through your last set of heavy curtains and into the lounge. Violet Hour has ""house rules,"" where the intent is to maintain the swanky environment; and to perhaps preserve a time in history. You will see a sign that tells you that you may not use your cell phone. Perhaps they'd rather you didn't; but texting and the sort is allowed. They just don't want you to try to make a phone call. For that, you must take it outside. I have had this confirmed by a ""mixologist,"" working the bar.  Violet Hour does not have bartenders. When you're working with as many ingredients as these kids do; you might want to call the seasoned employees alchemists. You owe it to yourself to sit at the bar and watch them work. Look closely, you'll see vials of ingredients with screw-top eye drop dispensers. It was hard to see every ingredient; but one of them was clearly labeled ""lavender,"" if that gives you any idea of how much work these magicians put into their potions. I really wouldn't want to sit anywhere else. The mixologists are adorable in their fitted button-down shirts, bow-tie, and simple vests with dress slacks. To polish the look, most of the guys working here sport mustaches.  For a speakeasy, you could overlook that this space is a very sterile environment. There aren't many knick knacks adorning the walls except for behind the bar. The wood floors aren't aged, in fact, they look like they were just installed a couple days ago. Even the tables are modern in design, mostly due to the high-backed chairs that surround them. Low-lit and moody, Violet Hour will also offer Sustenance along with their potent potions. Far from mere sustenance, Violet Hour offers ""Heavy Appetizers,"" to help you soak up all that booze they manage to cram, along with everything else, into a tiny cocktail or rocks glass. Any food you order will be just as appealing to your eyes. Presentation is key! I love the gender-neutral bathrooms. You know you're in a classy bar when people know better than to throw toilet paper all over the floor. I hope you're laughing. I'll also add that I like the fact that the bathroom appears no different from what you might find at someone's house. Basically, you don't feel like you're walking into a biohazard just so you can pee.  The best part of this bar is their use of curtains. Not only do they generate mystery and feminine energy; but they also control the noise levels in the lounge. There are 3 large spaces inside, and they are all sectioned off with the same heavy curtains you have to muscle your way through when you walk in. Smart move! It was much easier to listen to my friend after not seeing him for almost a year and a half. This is a great space to bring a group of friends or to bring a date.

2013-11-02,5.0,"Oh Violet Hour. You are so super classy and hip right now. Seriously, if you want to get the speakeasy feel in a little more of a hipster and less secretive setting, Violet Hour is the perfect place. You don't need to know a password to get in, but you do need to have some idea of where the door is. If you don't, it's incredibly easy to walk right by the entrance thinking it's another graffiti wall in Chicago without even realizing it. However, the super long line to get in might be a big tip off.  Basically, if you want to go to Violet Hour, you need to get there early, probably no later than 7:30pm. If not, you'll be waiting in line for a very long time since once people go, they tend to sit around and stay for a few rounds. The door man is awesome. He's a beautifully muscled guy who casually sweeps and cleans up the area while asking for the number of people in your party. When a table that's perfect for your group size is available, he swiftly comes to you, and gives you the ""come with me"" signal. He's pretty much a bada$$.  Once you're inside, it's DARK. People are sitting around in their designated spots (you're not allowed to roam around), and the lighting really only comes from the candles lit in the place.

2013-10-11,4.0,"I came to this place with no expectations, as I heard about it a mere few hours before I visited. So, for better or for worse, this review is pretty objective (as in, it wasn't overhyped for me, so not sure if it would've lived up to pre-set expectations if it had been hyped up). First thing I noticed was the interesting entrance: you'd probably pass by thinking you were walking by a mural/random wall if it weren't for the line of people waiting outside. Pretty interesting concept. Definitely piqued my interest.  My friend and I got there at around 11pm, and waited outside for maybe 20 minutes or so. We were eventually called in by someone up front. Since we were a group of 2, we actually got to go in before the group of 7 ahead of us.  Inside is very dark (almost a little too dark) and the setting is intimate. We were seated at the bar, which wasn't as intimate and secluded as the actual lounge area, but it was really cool to see the bartenders work their magic. I ordered a vodka drink (apparently one of their more popular ones) with Tito's, lemon, blackberry syrup, and bitters, and it was delicious. I'm not a huge fan of spending money on drinks (would rather spend that money on food), but I'd say that it  was a $13 well spent. My friend got something with gin and said she enjoyed it as well. Didn't try any of the food, but the people next to us ordered something and it smelled heavenly.  Having not visited many lounges, this was a great first visit to a nicer one. There isn't anything particularly interesting or creative about their drinks (think Aviary), but the drinks are delicious nonetheless. Worth a visit!",0.996,0.752,0.213,0.035,0.5190935672514619

After chatting a bit we realized grumpy but he didn't add to the experience and actually took away from it.

Love to take out of towners here, but the hype is pretty big, so go on an off night when there isn't a crazy wait and it will be worth it.

My friend liked the Juliet and Romeo so much she ordered two in a row. I had the PB& J-- which has gin and overall was very sweet and to my liking. Strongly recommend it. Also ordered the Off the Trail or Off the Beaten Path or something, which had blackberry flavors in it, a bit sour, but was also good! The other girls were very happy with that they got, which were some whiskey cocktails. The ambiance is very nice.

I told him that I'm also not a huge fan of whiskey. He couldn't really come up with a single recommendation except for a whisky drink that I ended up not loving - shocking.

2013-09-24,5.0,"I don't know why I haven't written a review for this place since I've been coming here quite frequently since I moved to Chicago a little over two years ago. Anyways, here goes: This place is great, they have great cocktails, the staff/servers/bartenders are friendly, and it's a cool environment. Be forewarned, this is not the place to come if your goal is to pick up hordes of ladies (or guys) for the night. The menu changes frequently, which I like since variety is the spice of life, but that can also be a bummer sometimes as they take my favorite drinks off the menu...Flaming Heart and August Revolution, I'm lookin at you. However, if you do ask, they can generally make you off the menu drinks as long as they have the ingredients and the bartender(s) working know how to make them. Also I have been here plenty of times where the bartenders will make you custom drinks if you're talking with them and tell them what you like. Now I understand that this place can come off as pretentious if you're here when it's really busy and you have to wait in line in the cold outside, but in my experience, if you're friendly and respectful toward the people who work here, they can be very accommodating. I have been seated plenty of times when our full party wasn't present, and I have also been the straggler that has come in later than everyone else and it's never been an issue. Some tips: If you can, get here before 8 pm, there is generally little to no wait. Sit at the bar, the bartenders here are some of the best, both in mixing drinks and conversation. I also have to say that my company has had a holiday party here and it was an amazing experience. Firstly, before we were sure we wanted to do our event here, two of my coworkers and I came here for a tasting to try a large variety of their food and drinks. We came on a Thursday night, sat at the bar and they made drinks for us to sample. I lost count of how many I tried. We also sampled quite a few food dishes and ended up staying for a good few hours. We were also very happy and sloshed at the end of that. Did I mention that all of it was on the house? That pretty much sealed the deal. Fast forward to the actual event a few weeks later, we had half of the back room from 6-9pm and everyone really enjoyed themselves, the staff was friendly, attentive, and no one had an empty glass in their hands. They even let us stay an hour past our time slot and kept serving us drinks. Aaaand, I think that's all I got. A+.",0.9964,0.83,0.144,0.026,0.46403318903318913

2013-09-15,5.0,"A handful of friends were raving about this place back home.  If you appreciate cocktails like you appreciate fine art (like I do), you'll adore The Violet Hour. Atmosphere is very dark and candlelit with the space being very open.  There are plenty of seats at the bars and a good amount of tables for larger parties.  As everyone else explained, the line forms quickly.  I arrived 30 mins before opening and was the first.  Fifteen minutes later and 10 more people were in line, so coming early is recommended. Now onto the best part: the cocktails.  I tried 6 different cocktails, and all were excellent.  My favorite was the Juliet & Romeo - a super refreshing drink that set the mood for the rest of the evening.  Each portion of the menu is organized by the type of alcohol, so there's a section for vodka, gin, rum, etc.  If you want something concocted just for you, let the bartenders know what you're in the mood for and they'll take care of you.  My specific bartender was Henry - very attentive and a pro at his craft.  Even though he was super busy making drinks, he would take the time to chat once in a while.  Each cocktail was $13 - for the personalized service and quality of the cocktails, I think the price is very reasonable.  They also have a food menu for the folks who want grub with their alcohol. I liked this place so much, I went back the following night.  There was a line, but I was welcomed in about 15 minutes, so I was again a happy customer.  This spot is an excellent date spot - good music that's not blaring, and the atmosphere is quiet and romantic.",0.993,0.816,0.184,0.0,0.5282258064516129
2013-09-13,4.0,"My first bar in Chicago as a first timer!  This place will definitely be remembered. After finding street parking on a quiet Thursday night, our party set out to find this popular bar.  There were no signs, so we pestered locals on the street as to where this infamous bar was.  After stumbling around and not finding it, a bouncer to another club finally pointed us to a yellow light on a hidden door that blending into the mural wall.  The entrance was SECRET!!!  Upon finding the elusive door and opening it, a magical sign appeared with VIOLET HOUR rules and more curtains: even more dark dirtiness. We wandered through curtains to find a charming interior brimming with the warm ambiance of a speakeasy.  It was around midnight on a Thursday and there was no wait at all. We were lead to a table in the corner that was lit with romantic candles and high backed chairs - we felt like queens and kings.  We began to break rule # 1 - NO CELL PHONE USE IN THE LOUNGE and began taking photos of each other and began to wonder if we we would get kicked out.  We were never warned. We ordered the Juliet and Romeo, Riveria and Dame's Delight. Juliet and Romeo - was good, but I expected shooting stars and rainbows, with everyone and their mom buzzing about this drink.  I've had better at ANVIL in Houston, IMO, which I attend as a regular.  It probably needed either more rosewater or more of an acidic kick, or else it just tasted like your typical gin cocktail that lacked a special punch.  Overall it was a very good and strong gin drink and very easy to drink. Dame's Delight - good and sweet for people that prefer this type of drink.  Over my alcoholism..er I mean alcoholsnob evolution, I've come to prefer less sweet drinks so of the three, I didn't prefer this one. Riveria - I actually appreciated this drink the best of the three.  It was complex, and none of the ingredients over-powered any of the others.  The gin-macerated pineapple put a naturally sweet finish to the drink, and the bitterness of the campari offset this sweetness.  The lemon added a perfect acidity, and the egg white was the icing on this immaculate cake; it made the drink frothy and delectable. I also had a chance to chat with a bartender and the bouncer who were very friendly and quick to offer recommendations on their MUST SEE/EATS/DRINKS etc for a first timer in Chicago. This is a place I'd want to come back over and over to try everything on the menu.",0.9983,0.777,0.206,0.018,0.5169684747876235

(Except for bombs of any sort) Munch on the beef jerky, chicken liver pate, and the aioli frites. They're tasty and perfectly prepare your palate those famous libations of theirs.

We didn't bother with the small food menu, but we knew it wasn't a food place before we went (and thankfully ordered Chinese the night before so had leftovers to scarf down when we got home). There were 5 of us, which was kind of an awkward number. So, being the awkward single person, I was seated on this uncomfortable little stool at the end of the table. I usually like something to lean against myself, but it wasn't a big deal.  It is dark. We accidentally blew out one of our candles and couldn't see the menu. Good thing the service is awesome. They were very solicitous. You accidentally blow out a candle and they will be by to relight it basically immediately.

Then again, I guess you come here for that purpose--intentionally crafted trendiness that is accomplished by a forced attempt at secrecy and underground glamour. Oh wait, that didn't even make sense did it? Yeah, it's because I'm trying too hard, just like the Violet Hour. When we first arrived, the doorman leaned up from his tree and got off his phone to tell us ""Let me check if there is even room for you guys."" We waited for a short bit, as people started gthering behind us. It felt like we were held waiting in the streets to create an illusion of crowding and popularity for this place. Then we were let in, and they were of course, not full. How predictable. It's all about appearances, isn't it?  Once you're inside, you sit nearly in the dark. You order drinks and......you continue to sit. There was no way to mingle. I get it, it's a lounge. But do I have to be imprisoned in one spot? You sat within the perimeter of your table and pretty much don't get up unless you're going to the restroom or exiting.

The place is cool without a doubt: Once you located the unmarked door, you enter a small hallway (I love the rules sign in there...too funny) and pass through a curtain into one of the larger speakeasy bars I have been too. The room is massive and divided into two by another massive curtain. The booths and high back chairs divide each area into a more private intimate setting. Like at other speakeasy's I like to sit at the bar. These mixologists take pride in their drinks and are great to chat with. They guy serving us was nice, but not the most conversational, which was OK. I was just a little disappointed because my Old Fashioned was OK. All my friends sin Chicago said I will love this place and I did, just not my drink, it just tasted like straight whiskey.   So I sipped on it for a half hour and then headed out. I'm sure the other drinks are very good, but I was just too let down with my first drink (about two hours earlier I had one of the best Old Fashioned and Sazeracs ever at dinner).  I still think this place is a great place to relax with friends or a date....",0.9974,0.668,0.3,0.032,0.540084175084175

After a few years, it seems they play their music louder and the overall energy level seems more rowdy and chaotic than in the past, but I'm willing to put up with this for the fantastic drinks.

Really classy place to sit and have a few drinks, whether you're at the bar watching all of the mixology magic happen or at one of the surprisingly private tables/booths. In my experience, the service has always been excellent and the potential to be bothered by obnoxious patrons fairly low. That said, it's not necessarily a great place to mingle with others outside your group or meet new people - privacy is definitely encouraged here.  The drink menu is, as it has always been, quite large and full of pretty interesting stuff. Prices, while not cheap, are extremely fair for what you get. I can't think of any bad drinks I have had at Violet Hour, except for when I ordered poorly because I was too stubborn to ask about some ingredients I didn't recognize.

No flares. I liked that. Then I ordered a peach julep. That's my real test as I've fallen in love with it at another venue. I've concluded that they don't do sweet very well as my girlfriend wanted something sweet & came with the same complaint.  Otherwise, it's your typical mixology bar. You can tell your mixologist your drink profile & they'll concoct a poison for you. It really isn't a gimmick. You can find that kind of thing elsewhere.

Long lines on the weekend -- come early, late, or on a weeknight. Only place I've had comparable cocktails is, of course, Grant Achat'z Aviary.

Lastly, and what stuck in my mind most: I remember the staff being outstandingly well-trained and almost regal before.  In this experience, ours was just a young, snotty...employee.  That was a definitely turnoff.

You have to be quite strategic about the time you arrive since you could possibly be in line for 45minutes to HOURS depending on your group size. Fortunately, I went with a group of 3 others and arrived before 10. Even though there was a line, we didn't wait more than 25 minutes. Don't even bother to ask if more people can join your party if they arrive later. Everyone HAS to be present, otherwise you get the cold shoulder and a phone call on when to arrive later (if ever).  Going inside, I felt like I was in a Mad Men-esque type of joint. Though it is very fancy inside with their oh-so-tall, royalty-like chairs, you do not have to dress that fancy! Just some basic nice attire will do. Their cocktail menu is broken down according to what liquor is used and the top of each subsection starts off with the sweetest drink. I'm a tequila girl and decided on the Tequila Sunset, which was the sweetest, it had Lunazul Blanco, pineapple, ginger syrup, Blue Curacao, and angostura Bitters. MAN it tasted nothing how imagined a sunset to. Honestly, with the first few sips I felt like I could be floored since all I tasted was the tequila. I decided to switch with my friend who got the Moscow Mule (vodka, ginger beer, and lime)- if you love ginger, then this is the drink to get. I would say for a low-key, yet nice atmosphere, Violet Hour is worth going to. Not too pretentious despite the surroundings. **Note: It is very hard to figure out where this spot is unless there is a line.

Will you encounter a line?  Very possible, since the bar is so outstanding, and everyone inside is seated.  No elbow to elbow battle to get a drink?  Amen. All the positives you see in other reviews apply.  They make their own bitters, create ice from fine water, refuse to serve amateur drinks, etc.  I'll add this:  My personal cocktail is a G&T made with Old Tom Gin -- a recipe from the 17th century that's rarely available, even at high-end bars. When I first settled in at Violet Hour, I asked the friendly, low-key bartender if he happened to have any Old Tom Gin.  His response:  ""Which kind?"" Sold. He spent about five minutes crafting the finest example I've had to date (rivaled only by a tiny backstreet bar in Tokyo).  After much enjoyable conversation and a couple more drinks, I expected a check of about $42.  It was $21.

Now when I bring friends from out of town here on a Saturday night and I see 20 people leave your establishment over the course of 25 mins and the line doesn't move at ALL, I'm going to get pissed. Then you let people cut in line? Either get your shit together and clear the tables faster or cut the bullshit and stop making people wait in line for the 'experience'. Your list of rules and people clamoring to get in is cute and all, but in Chicago we just want a fucking drink, and a good one at that.  If Scofflaw can pull it off, why can't you? Unfortunately your decent drinks aren't worth the constant BS. You're not the only place in town for a well made drink. Stop trying so hard.

Make no mistake your drinks are hand crafted, high quality and take awhile to receive. But the wait is worth it.  We weren't able to get in that first night (no patience!) so we decided to go down the road to the arcade bar (amazing btw), for a different vibe. We tried again the next day and got in without a wait and finally saw what the fuss was about. I had the Pimms cup that was made with molasses and was the best Pimms I've ever had. Their version of the Moscow Mule was also on point. Well balanced, creative and delicious drinks, you can't ask much more out of cocktail bar.

It feels like you're in on a secret that's really not all that secret, but hey, why not roll with it? After waiting in line for an hour on Saturday night, my boyfriend and I were led in and given a choice of where to sit, either at the bar or near the fireplace. I had read that there was a fireplace and chandeliers and candlelight in the past reviews, but the decoration didn't exactly meet my expectations -- in my head, I pictured Scofflaw's glamorous high-backed chairs, but these were more like blue, cushioned cubes in the shape of a chair.  The waiters and hosts were all incredibly sweet, and I really enjoyed their service -- they seemed to stop by at just the right moment. I followed the advice on FourSquare and got a Juliet and Romeo to start off, which was delicious -- I had to hold it so my boyfriend would stop stealing sips. My second drink, The Wavy, didn't know my socks off, but it was solid and A-OK, just like the 3-star rating says. There's a no cellphone policy in place, but the girls next to us continued to check their phones, so it's not really enforced. If the decor really brought me back to the Roaring 20s and the speakeasy lifestyle, then I would be a bit irked by the phones, but I believe that notion is more of a cute ruse than an actual dedication to evoking the speakeasy feel.

I said it before and I'll say it again, Chicago must just love mediocrity because this place screams it. Now I know the Violet Hour has been around for a while but I must have missed it's heyday because this place was an utter snooze. Now I get they are trying to have a relaxing vibe and keep out the dude-bros but the litany of rule assures you will not have any fun or spontaneity. Yes, if you enjoy regimentation and needless pomp, you'll LOVE this place. First off you MUST wait in line to enter.  A lot of places like this are seated only but you must go through this protocol even if the place is not that busy. The crudely constructed hallway is just quickly thrown up press bored and may have been acceptable for when it open but after a number of years, you'd think they would have constructed a more suitable area for people to wait. When you are finally deemed worthy to enter, you are supposed to bowled over by the elegance of the decor but unfortunately, it's already a bit dated. Muted colors and my most unfavorite thing to see anywhere, fake ""distressed"" furniture. There are velvet curtains but this is not so much for flair but because of the poorly built hallway allows the ever present Chicago arctic air  to enter the bar area. On VH's endless list of rules, they proudly exclaim ""No, we DO NOT serve Greygoose!"" With that I assumed they would have amazing brand of vodka's that you could get only there, perhaps directly from Russia. Nope, you got Tito's which you can get in virtually every bar in Chicago. In fact their entire bar stock is very average and mundane, with selections of liquors you can find any where and rather inexpensive selections at that. Now the drinks DO taste good but honestly, they just mix 5 or 6 different things and maybe ad some egg white and that's the extent of their expert mixology. There's no infusion of the glass or presentation like Angel's Share (which also has WAY better food). They just seem to have giant ice cubes and their ""mixologists"" are just guys not good looking enough to work in Boy's town with suspenders and arm garters.  I wish people would crack a history book before throwing around names. Speakeasy's were notoriously wild noisy places with loud music, dancing, and gambling. This is a seated room only lounge with tired interior, lame music, mediocre bar, and if you are expecting a well dressed sophisticated crowd, well you'll be disappointed in that arena as well. Over all, if you don't leave Chicago often, don't mind the common selections, bad music and love your fun tightly controlled, this is your place. However I feel as though they took on too many cues from Frank Lloyd Wright, who disliked guests so much he created uncomfortable furniture and atmosphere so people wouldn't stay too long. I think VH doesn't want you to feel too welcome so they can herd, and I mean literally herd, the next group in.",0.9948,0.746,0.164,0.089,0.6287884024577574

2013-03-23,5.0,"Hell, why not add my own rave review to the never ending stream of them here on yelp. I went to the Violet Hour again last night for the first time in a bit. If anything, it's gotten friendlier, chiller, and better than when I was last there. We got a table at 7 on a Friday night, and despite their signs, they were flexible about having a couple of our party show up a bit late. The servers know EVERYTHING about the menu: ask them to describe you a drink, and they'll give you an extremely helpful rundown. Ask them to let the bartender make you something and give them some preferences, they'll make you something delicious that's off menu.  And the drinks, of course, were phenomenal. I love how their menu ranks cocktails by ""daringness"" in each liquor category. You can always pretty much guarantee that the first one on any of those lists will be utterly delicious, and really really drinkable without being boring in the slightest. And you can always guarantee that the last one on any list will be knock-your-socks-off good, and like nothing you've ever had.  It's also the only bar that will get me to drink that venerable Chicago drink, Malort. Seriously, if you can make me a cocktail that makes Malort taste like something other than engine oil, you have to be some kind of wizard. But they do it. The price is exactly what it should be.

I love, love, love the vintage decor, dramatic high ceilings, curtains, candle lights, and especially the whimsical chairs.  It wasn't too crowded yet so we were seated immediately.  The drink menu is extensive, but organized by alcohol type and from light to strong.  My go-to is the Part & Parcel, but I also tried the It's Pronounced ""Beer"" and the Palomino, which were both good too.   Our server was not very friendly, more aloof, and had a slight attitude.  When one of my coworkers couldn't decide on a drink, she made some recommendations based on his preferences, which he tried.  He liked the first drink better than the second one she recommended, and she did offer to give him something else if he preferred. She just didn't seem patient with us.

2013-03-19,2.0,"Let me start by saying that I really like this place...it's awesome...In fact, when it comes to drinks and decor, I would say 6 out 6 stars would suffice, if possible.  HOWEVER, when it comes to the SERVICE as of late (particularly the door host staff), 2 out of 5 stars will do.  This past Saturday (3.16.13) I was having a few drinks with my brother at Big Star when he asked about the bar across the street. Realizing that he hadn't been to the Violet Hour before, I jumped at the chance to introduce him to the place. While waiting in line, I assured him it was worth the wait, as it almost always is...  Unfortunately, I spoke too soon...Enter the ""Door Host"". When asked how many we're in our party, I responded ""just two"". He then responded with a border line yell (in my face), ""we are under strict orders from management not to service anyone that's been out drinking for St. Patrick's day"". I assured him we were fine, as had only been across the street for an hour. I also mentioned I come to the place often, understood where he was coming from, and have always respected the guidelines, etc. He then responded, and I quote, ""That doesn't matter tonight""... That was enough for me, and I walked away in disbelief.   While I understand the door host may have been frustrated due to the past events of the evening, I don't understand why he had to be rude, especially when it wasn't warranted. Even more so, the negative attitude via the door staff has been a trend during my last few visits to The Violet Hour, which is why I felt it necessary to post this review. In short, I think its time for a SERIOUS reality check for some of the folks working here. Lastly, as someone who supports their other establishments on a REGULAR basis (my wife loves Avec & The Publican), one can only hope this isn't a reflection of things to come...and can simply be chalked up to a Door Host on a power trip.",0.8887,0.874,0.081,0.045,0.4505799755799756

It's not your typical dive bar but rather an elegant world that reminds me of a place Edgar Allen Poe would retreat.

Be prepared to pay a pretty penny for a luxurious cocktail with a starting price of $12. All of their drinks are made with precision and are strong!

Or the fact that the damn door doesn't look like a door, so I was just feeling up a wall for a long time on a cold and dark sidewalk until some jackass that was too cool to say anything before finally just opened the door for me. And the too-cool-for-school VH is clearly too cool to have a sign. Because God forbid anyone actually find the place. Even though some 1,110 people on Yelp managed to find it. So, the no-sign thing didn't really work.  So I won't say any of those things. But those un-said things, I definitely did say, in my mind.  The cocktails make you forget these transgressions. At least the good ones do. I'm on a gin binge right now and tried Pretty Please and the English Garden. The Pretty Please was my favorite with Bombay Dry, Lemon, Lillet Rose, Licor 43, Peychaud's Bitters; the English Garden was snazzy as well with Lady Grey Infused Bombay, Lemon, Orange Marmalade Syrup, Saline, but a little too sweet for my liking. I'm not cheating on tequila... for those that know my true passion. But tequila Bobbi Brown'd me last week and therefore we're taking a wee break.  I can't write this review and not give super danger ahead warnings of the mojito. It's served in a highball, as it should be, with a block of ice the size of Alaska. We extracted said block of ice to find that it only allowed for about two ounces worth of drink. $12 for two sips? If I were saying this review out loud I would clap every syllable of this sentence, but instead I'll use periods: That. Is. The. Most. Obnoxious. Transgression. By. A. Bartender. Ever.  Mojitos aside, the drinks are honestly swoon-worthy. You just have to find your way to the door, figure out how to open the door, wang-chung through six sets of velvet tapestries, turn your flashlight on to see where you're going, and make a reservation a month ahead to sit down for said cocktails.

Violet Hour is located in Wicker Park, if you do not expect hipsters around there, then go party north of Belmont on Halstead and tell me you wont see rainbow flags anywhere or drunk Cubs fans.

2013-01-29,4.0,"The Violet Hour knows what it wants to deliver and does it well.  In my own *personal* opinion, the ""wannabe-hipster"" (and bona fide hipster) crowd this place tends to attract is trying just a wee bit too hard.  And in turn, Violet Hour gives off a similar ""trying too hard"" vibe ..... but that's okay.  It is what it is.  And there is much to recommend the place.  The unmarked, beat-up storefront, the list of house rules, the theater that places out while you wait at the front curtain to be summoned by the door guy to join the ""chosen few""......it's all a little in-your-face obvious pandering to Chicagoans' insecurity complex, but hey.....so be it.  We aren't in New York, and sometimes we like to feel like we are.  And that's okay.  :)    I love the aesthetics ....heavy curtains, color scheme, white trim/woodwork around the bar, lighting, fireplace, chandeliers, mod/chic vibe.  The front room looks amazing....but practically, I find it annoying to sit in that section.  The ultra-high-back, immovable chairs and tiny tables, while hip and all, are mega-uncomfortable, and it all feels far too anti-social for my liking.  But if you just want to have a private conversation and gaze into your companion's eyes....it's super.  Just don't plan to get cozy.  You'll need to slip into the super-hip private bathroom stalls for that.   The back room with the fireplace is a little more inviting and social. That being said, you need to realize that you go to a place like Violet Hour when you actually *like* the company you came in with and primarily want to spend your evening talking to them.  This isn't Lincoln Park or a sports bar.  You are not going to be rubbing up against strangers and socializing while you fight for a bartender's attention.  (Really, why would you want to do that anyway?  But to each his/her own.) The cocktails are *amazing*....simple as that.  Unique, creative, tasty, nicely presented.  This is the primary reason to visit the place.  It's a subdued, unique (for Chicago) lounge with cool music (again, personal preference....think Joy Division etc.), a cool (though slightly pretentious) vibe, and really amazing drinks.  Definitely worth a visit.",0.9967,0.774,0.194,0.031,0.5243457300275481

But I was just happy to be going inside anywhere as it was -1000 degrees outside at the time. After going through a few draped entrances I realized we were at one cool hip bar. It had a quiet sort of ambience to it, and if you sit at a table it's almost like you're sitting on thrones as the chairs are so big.  As it was a cold night we tried their two warm drink options: the Forged Valley and the Aberdeen Sling. The Valley was a bit sweeter, but both hit the spot perfectly and warmed us up. I can't say I've ever had drinks quite like these, and I was impressed. We wanted more warm drinks and the waitress said the bartenders could cook up something new for us that wasn't on the menu. I can't remember what we got, but they were good too. Nice that they made something original for us.  This is a great place for a date btw!",0.9907,0.794,0.206,0.0,0.5695374800637958
2013-01-24,4.0,"Asking some younger - hipper locals, about where to head for a chill vibe and cool cocktails whilst in Chi-town, the answer appeared to be unanimous that the Violet Hour in Wicker Park was the place to be. It's certainly not an easy place to find so as an out of town visitor, you literally need to ask other folks in the area where to find it. From the outside the only identifiers (if you can call them that) were a boarded up wooden frontal facade, a single lamp and a small crowd of frozen would-be patrons.  The only star this places is losing is for its excruciatingly long line up, and for its arbitrary order (or lack there of) for how people are admitted. The line is long and frustrating and I was freezing my bits off - but as you will soon hear it was well worth it.  Pro-tip #1: Once inside the doors, listen up for when the doorman calls out a number of people for a table. If you happen to be in a party with that many and are the first to flag him down... you're the next to be seated. I told you, totally random! Once my friend and I got in we both LOVED the speakeasy style of this place. Run down and non-descript from the road.. (as I mentioned before: so much so that we walked past 3 times - Thank god for the line up).  Once inside, I felt like I was living an episode of Boardwalk Empire. Dimly lit barely by candle lights, high wing back chairs make every effort to make each area intimate. Floor to ceiling drapes/curtains and even chandeliers that were pretty much just for show. Another big plus for me was the amazing playlist of music playing. It set a perfect mood for imbibing, casual conversation and overall - chilling the 'EF' out! Loved it!! Pro-tip #2: Please observe ""the rules"". No cell phones is one of these and a great idea! Once we were seated, their extensive cocktail menu blew me away. Here is what I decided to have on the recommendation of our server. 1. The Violet Hour Old Fashioned. Served with an ice ball (size of a fist) there own in house take on this Old Man Classic was strong - Holy Hell! I'm a fella who loves his Madmen cocktails but this one had me buzzed by the end. Bravo! 2. Cold and Delicious - This was a strong recommendation from our server and I leave it to you who reads this as a SUPER strong recommendation from me. It literally tasted like Christmas and an apple pie in a cup. Flavours of Cinnamon, apple, and Egg white froth. Overall - smooth and delicious! BONUS: Shot of straight Jameson Whiskey provided for free compliments of our server. So terrible BUT oh so good. After this I wasn't sure if I loved ot hated our server... it was love! Between her breath of fresh air service, the venue, the cocktails and ambiance... I don't care what time it is when I'm home in Toronto because for me it will always be The Violet Hour!",0.9986,0.714,0.218,0.068,0.5240627362055933

My friend and I were catching up and found ourselves in our old stomping ground of Wicker Park. It was 6p and we made the wise decision of going to the Violet Hour. We were promptly seated at the bar (per request). Greeted by a cute and friendly bartender (Robby, seems to ring a bell). Then we got right to it! I got myself a Juliet and Romeo, which is a gin drink with rose and cucumber... and like the name suggests; it was to die for. My friend had a tequila drink, which had egg white in it, so there's that (it was also good, but mine was better).  Then we had the brilliant plan of ordering the punch bowl! WHICH WAS A GENIUS IDEA. Says it hydrates 3-4 people... but we ended up getting 3 glasses each. It was roughly $30 for the punch... (if you do the maths- that's only $5 per glass!). Pretty sweet deal.

I've heard from countless people since moving to Chicago that Violet Hour is THE place to get drinks. Those folks weren't wrong. However, the secret to getting in is really no secret at all: Try VH on Mon, Tues, or Wednesday, and you should be able to get in for after dinner drinks.  Now, what to get when you get there? So, I'd already kind of picked what I wanted by the time that I ordered, but the server gave a full explanation. There are drink specials on a paper separate from the cocktail binder--that's right, binder--and they are categorized by type of alcohol, and under there listed in increasing complexity. That didn't really change my order, but I felt like I would need an hour to go through the binder and decide what I wanted. That said, the drinks were ... WOW. Ambiance was cool. High chairs (think... minimalism alice in wonderland, kind of?), candles, dark lights, velvet curtains--it's the perfect place to meet your illicit, secret lover. Or take your husband of almost a decade to spice it up. You know, whatever.    OH, all the drinks are $12 a cocktail.

2013-01-10,5.0,"I came here on New Years Eve with my boyfriend and we were incredibly impressed. We called at around 3pm to ask how busy they would be and they had kindly told us they were booked from 8pm on, but to try coming before then for a couple drinks. So, after reading the reviews, we just had to try! After circling the area 4 times, looking anxiously for it, we almost lost hope. I hadn't read anywhere about their 'secretive' location. (Or were we just that unobservant?) We stopped at the 7-11 by their location to ask if they knew where it was and thankfully, a man who lived in the area kindly told us where we would find it. And after spotting the valet sign in front of the building, we felt a bit silly.  Anyways, entering The Violet Hour just took my breath away. People may say they 'take themselves too seriously', but honestly, they have all the right too. It's rare to find a classy lounge with a unique, chill interior such as their own.  When we entered, we were immediately greeted with open arms and were led to the seating area near the fire place. The ambiance was wonderful, I felt at peace here, and I just lovelovelove that they don't allow cellphone usage. It made me feel closer with my partner with no phones involved (aside from the few pictures I had to sneak in of the drinks!). Oh, and the service was FANTASTIC. All of the hosts/hostesses were so kind and our server was incredibly bubbly and outgoing. She even offered me some of her glitter after complimenting my outfit! How lovely~ On to the drinks: all of them were well-crafted, delicious, and beautifully arranged.  What we had: JULIET AND ROMEO - I had read reviews on this one, so I had to try it. This had to be one of my favorites of the night. It's so well-made and perfectly sweet! FIRST SNOW - Our server described this one tasting like a Christmas Sugar Cookie, so of course, my boyfriend ordered it on the spot. He really enjoyed this drink and he would definitely get it again. BLACK AND WHITE - This one wasn't on the menu when we were there, but our server suggested it. She compared it to a Key Lime Pie and, you know what, it tasted EXACTLY like that. This was my favorite drink of the night! So, I hope this was the name of it (I was a little tipsy at the time), but when you go, ask for the drink that tastes like Key Lime Pie (If you like sweeter drinks), I promise you won't be disappointed! (It was my boyfriend's favorite of the night as well)! LET GO LIGHTLY - This was probably my least favorite of the night. That doesn't mean it was bad, it still had distinct flavors that would make it a winner at any other bar, it was just a bit too strong for my taste :) Overall, a GREAT experience!

2012-12-31,5.0,"The Violet Hour is a really cool place to enjoy a drink. You have to get there early because if you don't, you will not get in. Once inside, be prepared to go on a cocktail experience that you will never forget.  The decor is very nice. It is a dimly-lit place, which is a perfect setting for romantic conversation. In addition, the people are not insanely loud, which is also a great thing.  The drinks here are outstanding. It is clear that the mixologists here take great pride in preparing a drink; preparing a drink is a work of art, and the mixologists deliver every time. I had the Smoke and Mirrors, Vato Loco, and a Redwood Martinez (I can't remember the other two drinks I had), and all of my drinks were sensational. I have been to a lot of bars and restaurants across this country, and I can honestly say that The Violet Hour has the best variety of drinks I have ever experienced. This is a true neighborhood hidden gem in Chicago. Now, I must talk about what to do here. Again, get there early. The Violet Hour opens at 6 PM, and the line starts forming around 5:30 PM. If you do not get there early, be prepared to wait in line for a long time because they only let people in when people leave, and people like me are NOT leaving early because the drinks are so good (I was there for three hours). Also, sit at the bar. If you sit in the booths, there's always a chance that you will not get served as quickly as you may like. For instance, I was already on my third drink at the bar BEFORE the people at the booth behind me got their first drink. So, for those on yelp who complained about the wait/slow service, let this be a lesson to you. Sit at the bar (This goes for most bars, but for some reason people sit at tables then complain when they don't get served quickly. Makes no sense, but people complain) and you have, of course, easy access to the bartenders. They do have a dress code, although they don't always enforce it. DO NOT go there looking like a bum, or there's a chance they won't let you in. Each drink is $12. At the risk of sounding obnoxious, don't complain about the prices. If you can't afford it, don't go. Trust me, the drinks are worth the prices; I spent about $100 there on drinks for myself and my lady, and I am not complaining one bit. Trust me, go to The Violet Bar.

It had a mild but balanced combination of cherry, lemon and cucumber with a frothed egg white topper. By far the best drink of the night.

There's no sign out front, and everyone I talk to has only heard of this place through word of mouth. You wouldn't know this bar was here if you were walking aimlessly down Damen Ave. One very cool thing about this place is the ice shapes that you receive in your cocktail - based on the type. We asked the bartender how they made them (my boyfriend has a slight obsession with talking to bartenders), and they told us that they fill up huge banquet serving pans with water and freeze them. Then someone spends 4-5 hours per day carving them into different shapes. I thought this was amazing.

The sirens certainly sang praises and lured me closer and closer. Over two years of hearing of this amazing place, I finally went on Saturday evening. There is no sign on the door. In fact, the outer door appears to be a painted piece of plywood - a mysteriously subdued entrance to a place of grandeur. We walked through two panels of thick, long-hanging drapery. The dark, heavy fabric had to be pulled aside for us to pass deeper and deeper into the rabbit's hole. The host greeted us and bade us all amounts of respect - especially considering that we were in our Halloween Costumes that involved me wearing rollers in my hair and a bathrobe. We were ushered through one or two more rooms to our friends who were already there. The speed of it all surprised me. I've heard that there is often a long wait to get in and also that they don't seat parties unless everyone is already present. For some reason we did not experience that when we were there. It also seemed as if tables of departing guests were not rapidly refilled. Our seats were leather-covered cubes - backless and somewhat uncomfortable. Other tables had high-backed chairs. There was a fireplace nearby. The ceilings were high and the dark drapes separated the otherwise large space into more intimate rooms. The menu changes so I won't go into the food and drinks too much. The drink menu was divided by alcohol type. I had two gin-based drinks and found them both to be delicious. The food we got was also yummy, but I thought that some of it was salty. My friends thought that some of it was so delicious that they quickly requested additional plates of it. Service was really good. I found the server to be well-informed about the drink and food menu. He was able to make sound recommendations and also to answer follow up questions. He did not visit our table often, but was always there when we wanted him for something. I don't know how the stealthy devil did it, but he was very, very good. The Violet Hour was a pleasant experience, but it wasn't magical by any means. It comes close, but there were a couple things that kept me from being blown away.

My drink of choice here is the Dark & Stormy. The sleek interior with its curtains and high back chairs allow privacy even when it is packed. It also allows you to easily carry on a conversation, which I really love. There is a nice selection of good appetizers, and I suppose you could make a meal out of it if you wanted to, but this place is a bar, rather than a restaurant. If you a looking for a full, sit down meal, go elsewhere. The vibe is hip, sleek & trendy. They do have some posted ""house rules"" which includes the following: No cell phone use inside lounge. Proper attire requested. Please, no baseball hats. Sorry, no reservations. If you have a party of four, we'll give you four chairs. If your party is eight, we'll arrange eight chairs for you. No ""party add-ons"" without prior notification. No O-Bombs. No Jager-Bombs. No bombs of any kind. No Budweiser. No light beer. No Grey Goose. No Cosmopolitans. And finally, please do not bring anyone to The Violet Hour that you wouldn't bring to your mother's house for Sunday dinner. These House rules scared off some of my out-of-town guests who thought they would not fit in. After some coaxing & reassurance, we went and they loved it. When I go, I am usually wearing nice dark jeans with a dressy top. And that is the norm. The Violet Hours does not accept reservations. And as the night progresses, the line and wait gets longer. The doorman is good about taking cell numbers and calling you once your table is ready. If you are really hungry, you can grab a great taco across the street from Big Star while you wait. Also, if you have never been here before, be forewarned that there are no signs marking the entrance. Just a light bulb above a door that blends into a wall with an every changing mural.

I went here with 7 other girls on a Thursday night for a special occasion.  This was probably a mistake; I believe our party was a little bigger than the norm there, so I am mostly understanding of the long wait we experienced (30+ minutes in line and 30+ minutes for drinks). Here is what I thought was cool about Violet Hour: it is nostalgic, almost like taking a trip back in time to prohibition.  I believe that is what they are going for and they hit the nail on the head.  I felt like I was in a movie or something.  The drinks are very strong and very good. Here is what I don't like about it.  The selection of beverages is, well, all cocktails.  Beer and wine do not exist, and food is scant.  A ""bar"" is non-existent; you must wait for an appropriately sized table for your party, TBD by staff.  This isn't so bad so long as you know this going into it. My least favorite part of this place is the condescending attitude of the staff, which I do not appreciate when I am paying $15 for one drink and waiting 1 hour for it.  This is just my personal preference - I like nice people in the service industry.

My date reassured me that one existed and yes, within a few seconds, one magically materialized from the wall. I did a mental jaw drop. Luckily, there was no wait that night, so we entered. The ambience was romantic and candle-lit. It was interesting to visit the fireplace and even the restroom; the House Rules were posted there, so I commemorated the occasion by snapping a picture of it. Yeah, I get oddly giddy over trivial things sometimes.  I have yet to try the food here, but based solely on the cocktails, I'm super impressed! I ordered the Sloop Don B. simply because the name sounded awesome. Needless to say, the drink was heavenly and definitely worth more than the $12! For the rest of the night, my date and I sat at the bar table to geek out and watch the bartenders do their wicked chemistry magic. While there, I was elated that my bartender was the inventor of my Sloop Don B.!  I'll definitely be coming back for more!",0.9895,0.728,0.205,0.067,0.5635338345864662

2012-09-11,5.0,"Love, love, love this cool speakeasy bar. Popped in here on a Sunday night while in Chicago visiting for my boyfriend's wedding, and it was such a needed reprieve from a crazy weekend. I came with the boy (who'd been there once or twice before), and our friend, for whom it was also a first.  Good thing one of us knew how to get in there, cause it's pretty hard to find. There's no sign and the door is in the middle of a giant mural on the side of a building. Makes it feel really legit! We all appreciated the nostalgic vibe. It was dark, yet welcoming and unpretentious, which was a relief, since the rest of the neighborhood is hipster central. We opted to sit at the bar so we could peek on the bartender making the drink, and check out the bar, rather than sit in the really cute, secluded, high backed booths.The velvet curtains all over split up the service area into two rooms and cut the noise pretty nicely. Our bartender was adorable in his striped shirt and suspenders, and he appeared to revel in the art of drink-making. I ordered the whiskey citrus forward ""Plumb the Soul,"" while the others got a ""Midnight Stinger"" (whiskey) and a ""Commis Sling"" (a scotch drink). Not gonna lie, we were more than a little impressed by the giant specialty ice-cubes that fit into our glasses (apparently, I'm easily impressed).  We were left alone to talk, and the bartenders came by and kept up our little glasses of water (given to us upon seating) throughout the visit. Bartender was even nice enough to leave us with the dropper bottle of tobacco bitters, with instructions on best tasting practices, when we asked to try it. All drinks are $12 and organized by liquor on the menu, and they have a fairly reasonable menu of small snacky plates (cheeses, croquettes, etc. that ranges from $5+) Overall, great, chill night spot.

First of all, we both despise bars. There is little else that I hate more than having to yell at someone to get them to hear me. My hubs feels the same way. Violet hour is different. In every way. First of all, there isn't a sign saying ""Violet Hour."" to let you know where it is...you just have to know or be told where it is. A guy checks your id and tells you to wait to be seated after going through the 2 HUGE and BEAUTIFUL curtains. Yes, no standing around, no yelling drunk people. It is a nice and classy establishment with beautiful booth-like seats coupled around the room and a bar area. Huge and beautiful curtains deck the walls from a very vaulted ceiling. Beautiful. The music was loud, but not shouting level. We could easily converse.  Drinks are GREAT, but are a bit pricey. 2 cocktails cost us $24+. So, good for special occasions.

2012-09-06,4.0,"This place is swanky!!! After our anniversary dinner (and dessert) I suggested that we go check this place out. My boyfriend was on board so we walked down by Big Star and couldn't find anything! Well after crossing the street we noticed that people were entering a mural (yes, a mural). The doorman was wearing all black and we had to stand in a hallway with a velvet curtain with another couple while they found space for us.  The house rules are hilarious, you can't use your cell phone inside. You must have proper attire, no flip flops please! The last one is definitely the best; don't bring anyone that you wouldn't bring to your mother's house for Sunday dinner. I haven't seen them enforce any of these rules, but everyone was generally well behaved on a Thursday night.  We waited about 5 minutes and then were escorted to a table with two giant (tall) green leather chairs with a tiny circular table. The chairs are set up to be private (so for just the two of us) but there are little pods and all of the chairs are connected. They also have a bar area to sit at as well as booths for parties of more than two. The chairs aren't all that comfortable and it is dark and dim in the place, but that goes with the whole speakeasy feel. It's loud inside. People are chatting, couples are romancing, and the indie music is blaring. Everything in this place screams ""trying too hard"" but it wasn't as if I didn't enjoy the extravagance.  I asked for something ""fruity and light"" and our server made the perfect suggestion, the Vodka Cobbler. I could drink this drink all night and my buzz snuck up on me fast. My boyfriend ordered something with root beer liquor. I am not a fan on root beer so I passed but he raved and raved. The service is a bit slow and expect to wait 10-15 minutes or more for your drink to come after you have ordered, especially on a busy night. Since the drinks are so involved (and there are a ton of options) it takes awhile to get your drink. We didn't have any food but the menu was short and to the point.

The high seating gives each table an intimate feel and the whole atmosphere is just sexy.  The first night, I went with my sister and we sat by the bar. The El topo was the first one I tried and I loved it. Very different, refreshing, and had that nice spicy kick to it. I brought my entire family the following night, and every drink wowed us. The bouncer in the front (Damien) was really nice, and I appreciated the fact that he let everyone in.

There is no sign on the outside of the building and the building itself does not look spectacular on the outside. The only way we knew we were at the right place was because there was a line and google maps said we were at Velvet Hour. The line appeared to be long; however the bouncer went through the line asking how many and we were able to go in even though there were about 25 people in front of us. (we were a group of 3, 2 guys & 1 girl). There was a guy behind us waiting in line who was smoking and the bouncer asked him nicely to exit the line to a designated smoking area in order to respect the other people waiting in line.  Upon entering, there was a very nice hostess that walked us through heavy velvet curtains and the atmosphere was very elegant. The place is pretty big (there are separate rooms with several bars).  The food was great, the drinks were great, the prices were $12.00 per cocktail, everyone had a place to sit (no dancing and no one had to stand). The place has dimmed lighting (with candles) so it was hard to read the menu. They do play music but t is not blasting. This place s great for groups and most of the people were dressed nicely and it seemed to be a good crowd.  Before going I checked out their website and ""rules."" People were using there cell phones and there were guys wearing jeans and dressed very casual so I am not sure how strict they are when it comes to adhereing to a dress code. This place is very different from most of the places bars/ounges in Wicker Park...it is definitely more upscale.  My only issue was it seems like its one of those places that wants to seem exclusive so if you go and there is a long line you never know how long you may or may not be waiting because they may be picky choosy.

The atmosphere is nice, but I feel like the music was too loud for the designed effect. I assumed it would be much quieter to allow for more intimate conversation, but it was just not possible.  Our server was friendly, however, I got the impression on multiple occasions that our table was being passed over on multiple occasions. We were well-dressed and polite, so I am unsure of the source of this inattention.  I am comfortable for paying a large sum for a basic drink, but the $12 here was not really what the quality or venue demanded. I had the Old Square Sazerac and was delivered something which tasted like it had far too much low quality liquor. For the price, I expected something much smoother.

2012-08-22,2.0,"I took my dad here on Father's day after dinner at Blackbird (which was excellent) and planned on sticking with the standards of that restaurant by getting cocktails at the affiliated Violet Hour. Expectations were not to be met.  The website depicts the Violet Hour as a decadent, intimate club designed to manufacture a feeling of exclusivity. In reality, it's a dimly lit open air environment that was playing eighties and early nineties music, which was barely audible over the din of the rowdy customers. Usually I don't blame the establishment for it's clientele, but the ""house rules"" are both told to you upon entrance and posted online and in parts of the lounge, they just aren't enforced. Most blatantly disregarded is the ""no cell phone"" rule, which was brazenly ignored by about a hundred dickheads flash instagramming their designer cocktails. They were the same body of inconsiderate jerks who interpreted the ""please dress appropriately"" request as ""wear white sneakers, plaid shorts and a wifebeater, because thats fancy. thats like what i would wear to my girlfriends parents house."" Ugh. I'd be more forgiving, but the service was straight up shitty. I noticed how long it took to get served once we were seated, so I decided to time how long it would take from the finish of my first drink to actually having my second in hand. I did this using my fiancees watch because using my phone would be a dick move. Anyways, it took FORTY FIVE MINUTES! This is a cocktail lounge, with servers and a bar. Yes the customer volume was high, but who cares? How the hell is the better part of an hour reasonable when you're talking about the production and delivery of ONE cocktail? Whatever. The server was passive and not interested in answering questions and didn't help the insane amount of time it took to get a drink by sauntering around instead of moving like he had the incentive of a tip to do so. The reason I gave it two stars is that the drinks were great. The problem with that though is that great drinks aren't a huge deal to me because you can get great drinks all over the place.

Overall, my impression is that violet hour has a certain amount of appeal, but I can't see myself being a regular here.  Unless you are seated at the bar, the set up is fairly antisocial and would put me to sleep.  They do a nice job with the limited food menu and the drinks, and the mural is cool.  That's why I give them four stars, even though it's not for me.

Our party of 3 gets seated at a empty 6, maybe 7, top table. We order drinks and an app. Digging the atmosphere. Good vibe...so far, so good. They tell us they may need to seat more people at our table. No problem, we think and say. Enter waitress/hostess 5-10 minutes later. Tells us that they are going to seat a large party next to us. She offers to move us to a ""better"" table, and provide a round of shots or a round of drinks - on the house - for our trouble. I look at my girlfriend, and we agree, sure, we'll move. Especially for a free round of drinks. Seated at our new booth table - definitely not a better table, as promised, by the way  - we continue to sip on our beverages and are having a good night. Soon enough, we're all running low and decide it's time to cash in on those promised drinks. We order, and the manager comes over and states - AND I QUOTE - "" Are you sure you guys don't want a round of shots?"". It's clear she's trying to cheap us out of the aforementioned round of cocktails. We say, ""No, thank you, we'd rather have drinks."" She says, ""Are you sure?"", to which we reply, ""Yes, we'd rather order from the menu!"" And so we do. And then continue our happy chattering.

We explain the situation to the waiter and he goes to talk to the ""manager"". 5 minutes pass. 10 minutes pass. FINALLY, this woman comes over to our table and says that she oh-so-clearly stated we were offered a ""round of shots"" or ONE drink. Which could not have been further from the truth.

Our server came by who was very nice, very helpful and offered us great suggestions based on our taste preferences. I had the public purse cocktail, which was a gin base (and even though I'm not a gin person by any means) the the rest of the flavors totally made up for it. It was a little sweet, but more tart, as I told our server that I really like lemonade like flavors in my drinks and it was topped with an egg white foam, which gave it a very sexy appearance. Plus, the overall drink was just adorable when it came out with another little extra side of the drink...VERY CUTE! My friend had the rosalita, which came out a little red and was tequila based, and she really liked it. I prefer the taste of mine, but boy were the drinks strong. And you could taste it from the start, so that is my only minus, I wish they were a little less strong because one drink was enough to get both of us tipsy.  Overall, great drinks (tad on the strong side), creative presentation and awesome service. Also, I felt like they were a tad pricey, but they at $12 so I guess you get what you pay for. Violet hour is a great place to take out of town guests and then hop on over to big star right across the street for when you get the munchies. Plus, it beats Aviary's prices. Definitely worth trying at least once if you live in Chicago.",0.9987,0.714,0.273,0.014,0.5337868480725623

The lighting is very dark so it's a little hard to read the drink menu, but boy, what a menu it is.  Easily one of the most extensive, crafty and interesting cocktails I've ever heard of! There were 3 people in our party and we each ordered something different-a pimm's cup #7, el diablo (not on the menu but the waitress recommended it to us), and a rosalita.  Each cocktail is $12, which we were a little taken aback by at first. As soon as we took the first sip, we could see why.  These things are delicious, beautifully constructed, and strong! If you're a bit of a lightweight like I am, one or two drinks is all you need.  The atmosphere is very dark and intimate-a perfect setting for a date, but I wouldn't recommend it for a group larger than 6 since most tables are smaller.

2012-07-10,5.0,"So, to start things off, I'm spoiled rotten by living in Nashville. We have TWO ""Alchemy Consulting"" - powered establishments, The Patterson House and The Catbird Seat - take THAT, Chicago. Second, we get our delicious booze for $2 cheaper in Music City!  Aaaand I personally think TPH has better and more food offerings.   One thing that is definitely better about TVH is that it has twice as many bathrooms, and they are located inside the bar, not out 'past the curtain'. But enough measuring.  So, there is nothing to call out TVH from the outside - just a blank wall with a mural on it with a lamp hanging down.  There was a line of people on the sidewalk right in front of it, so like the sheeple we were, we hopped to the back.  I was really surprised that it wasn't a longer line for around 7:30 on a Saturday, that would have you waiting for at least an hour back home.  Across the street is a nice restaurant by the same owners, Big Star; looks like it would be a good place to grab a bite before or after... After a bit, a guy came out, I'd call him a combo between a host and bouncer (Bost? Houncer?), and he was wearing small dark sunglasses, which at the time, I thought was kind of pretentious.  A huge hidden door at the corner swung open and we got inside within 15 minutes.  That was when I realized why the dude had on shades.  Holy crap, it is dark inside.  Especially when it was still light outside.  Maybe I need some more vitamin A, but we lost track of eachother and the guy that led us inside.  After about 45 seconds of fumbling around in the dark, we found each other and our guide and got seated up at the bar. The bartender that helped us out, Patrick, was very knowledgeable and truly a pro.  Nice guy to talk to as well, and while I stuck to the menu, I really got the feeling that he could have done just about anything for me if I told him my preferences. I started with their ""Black Sheep Julep"", which was an amazing brandy-based julep (that's actually what they were before bourbon), and my buddy got  ""Coffee & Cigarettes"" a rum-based cocktail that had coffee notes and tobacco bitters.  My julep was great, but his was fantastic - the tobacco bitters had such nice long finish - what a treat. Second round was ""Tobacco Road Manhattan"" for me, because I really wanted some more of those bitters, and while it was a damn good Manhattan, the tobacco notes really came out better in that first cocktail.  I also think they used Rittenhouse instead of the vanishing Wild Turkey 101 rye.  My pal got ""She'll Never Settle"", which was a bitter-based concoction - just fantastic and clearly the winner of round 2. Round three, because seriously, why not?  I went for ""The Public Purse"", which was a yummy plum gin(????)-based cocktail, and the perfect note to end on.  My amigo went down the bitters rabbit hole a bit too far and selected ""The Sam Spade"", another bitter-based libation, and I warned him that the Laphroaig in it might blow his mouth up, and sure enough it did.  Not my cup of tea.  But, because he is a professional, he choked it down. We stumbled out after paying our bill (FYI they don't take Discover), and the night air could not have felt better.  Thank g-d for mass transit.",0.9973,0.801,0.155,0.044,0.47725623582766424

I finally dragged a group of 4 here on a Friday night around 9:30. The wait took a good 45 minutes, which was relatively short, considering that the line had stretched down the block by the time we were almost seated. The house rules posted online were rather ambiguous (define ""proper attire"" more clearly please) but we dressed prettily because we were afraid to err on the side of underdressed. Fear not, if you find yourself outside of Violet Hour in shorts and tennis shoes, they'll likely let you in still because we noted a fair number of people in such attire. We each ordered one cocktail and split some sustenance. It was hard to choose because everything looks good. They have a list specialty cocktails, organized by lightest to strongest within each category, and also another huge book of all the other beverages they serve. We got a chance to try everyone's order: 1. Juliet and Romeo - my choice, and my god that was delicious. It was so incredibly refreshing (mint, cucumber, rosewater, you cannot go wrong), perfectly balance, and just not too strong nor too sweet 2. The Breakfast of Thompson - delicious and very fruity 3. Custom mocktail - fun fact: they don't have a mocktail menu, so instead they ask you what flavors you like and what your mood is, and then they design a drink to suit your tastes. My friend asked for fruity, sweet, and spicy, and the resultant drink was gingery, citrusy, and superb. 4. I don't remember what the fourth one was called lol, but it was also fruity although a touch too strong For food, we tried the salt cod croquettes, which were just okay and maybe a little too tough. My friend also ordered the chocolate plate for us because we were celebrating, and wow. It comes with four delicious truffles, a brownie (just okay, not moist enough), and the most delicious raspberry-rosewater (I think?) ice cream. The ice cream blew my mind, I don't think I've ever had ice cream like that before. Overall, amazing experience with some of my favorite people. The atmosphere is a little romantic, pretty classy, very hip, and probably way too cool for me but that's okay. Service was wonderful. They have a no cell phone policy, which is nice and conducive to actual conversation, but probably also the reason why there's always a line by the restrooms.

Drinks--- My friend and I got two drinks each.  Our waitress was fairly helpful, explaining some of the tasting notes to expect from each drink, and making (good) suggestions based on what kinds of tastes we each like.  I can't go into much more depth--I just know that I liked it.  The presentation was really nice as well.  Despite my friend not getting straight whiskey, they served her cocktail with a giant sphere of ice (minimal surface area to volume ratio = less dilution).  That same round, I had a the Slaughter Flowers (gin-based) which was served in a tall, narrow glass, with a matching tall and narrow beam of ice inside!  It's just ice, but that attention to detail made the experience feel that much better.  I was pleasantly surprised by the overall bill--each drink turned out to be just a bit above the $10 mark. Other thoughts--- I would love to bring a date here.  The bar seems like a nice place to be seated at.  At the con of it being less private, the seating can be much closer together than many of the other seating arrangements available.  I'd also just love to watch the bartenders/mixologists work their magic in creating these great drinks.",0.9982,0.759,0.215,0.025,0.5509803921568627

Maybe also because I was already happily buzzed and excited to finally walk through the velvet curtains....and didn't want to be let down by myself. So we find the door and walk in, lucky for us, there was no wait.  Allow the curtains to be parted!  Seated shortly at a small table with giant chairs we ordered a charcuterie plate, the spiced nuts and a couple rounds of cocktails. All cocktails are $12.   Short history lesson regarding cocktails - This is from a book I have called ""How's Your Drink - Cocktails, Culture, and The Art of Drinking Well.  The earliest mention of the word ""cocktail"" in print was in a publication called The Farmer's Cabinet, which only mentioned that cocktails are ""excellent for the head"".  The book also mentions a certain political candidate during the early 1800s who had a propensity for throwing elaborate drinking parties, and a local newspaper at the time tabulated the types of drinks he was serving, which included rum-glogs, bitters, gin-slings, and cock-tails.A reader inquired as to what a cock-tail was, and the editor of the paper wrote back, ""A stimulating liquor, composed of spirits of any kind, sugar, water and bitters."" I ended up ordering a Halfway Cross Town - Bourbon base with lemon, raspberry shrub, egg yolk, and cherry bitters.  The egg made my drink smooth and velvety, almost like chocolate milk, but not even close to being as thick.  Tart and strong flavored.  Very good. Also had the Violet Hour Old Fashioned - Bourbon with angostura bitters, syrup made from Turbinado sugar, and an orange peel.  Strong like bull.  Drink these if you want to put some hairs on your chest. The thing I love about these cocktails... They're well flavored and well thought out.  Inventive.(at least to me, because I'm no cocktail maker).  I love the ice.  Giant ball of ice in my glass?  Don't mind if I do!  They keep your drink cold and watered down as little as possible, so you can taste the full flavors of your cocktail for 10 minutes or so.  I also love that they make me want to drink them, no matter what they are.  Britt C.  ordered the Coffee and Cigarettes..wtf?  10 years, that was literally my breakfast on the way to school/work.  Figured I had to taste it.  It was like a time warp in my mouth, but with a touch of elegance and minus the stale smoky after scent.   Also have to mention Aubrey, our hot server, who referred to me as ""my darling"" and ""love"".  Old school mannerisms, I'm sure she might have been playing a part, but whether she is or isn't does not take away from her attractiveness and facial symmetry.  Just kidding about the symmetry.  I'm not obsessed at all.  Or am I?  As a lovely parting gift, she brought us a round of artichoke bitters on the house.  Sounds bad, but sweet and syrupy with a coffee-like finish, I could imagine drinking that over ice.   I'm going out on a short limb and say, I will return to Violet Hour.  I want to conquer this menu like Alexander the Grape!  I'm going to lay waste to the liquor, and show it who it's daddy is.  Like a boss!",0.9987,0.785,0.173,0.042,0.5562359943977592

Coming early is the key, and ask to sit at the bar, its actually more exciting that way. The guy who checked our ID and led us to our seats was awesome. He was friendly. However as we sat there we waited for a bit. Our server was such an ass. He was not very friendly and when I mentioned we waited about 10 mintues for someone to greet us he got offended and he pretty much said ""no you didn't wait that long."" After that remark he took our orders. He did not care to hear what I go to say. Cause he definitely got my order wrong. Okay, that pretty much ruin my expectation of this place. Lets back track a little, I love the decor the place is beautiful. But I believe its a bit dark at the tables. We all have to use the candle or our phones to look at the menu.  So our experience starts to get better when another waitress helped us out. She was way nicer and she actually listened.  But in the end I was a little disappointed. Oh forgot to mention, what is up with the hidden restrooms?  Needs better service, and a little bit of more lighting. I'm not talking about lighting the whole place up but just enough so we're not squinting at the menu.",0.9921,0.693,0.22,0.087,0.5400366300366299
2012-06-11,5.0,"I am not a fancy schmancy cocktail drinker. I will almost always favor a glass of wine or something simple like an extra dirty martini.  But when I booked my trip to Chicago, a friend insisted that I go to ""the bar with the best cocktails in the world,"" and he was absolutely right.  We sat at the darkly lit bar with the mysterious ambiance and let Patrick, a seriously talented mixologist, guide our decisions.  My stomach was feeling a little off from 3 nights of revelry, so he suggested a shot of fernet to soothe my belly, which was perfect.  We had the Juliet and Romeo, Dark and Stormy, and a custom Patrick creation which was a variation on the Manhattan.  Watching Patrick do his thing, I realized that the presenation of each drink was markedly unique, from the individually broken ice cubes for every champagne cocktail (yes, he broke each ice cube with the back of the spoon), to the precisely placed rose water drops in my Juliet and Romeo, to the adorable tennis ball sized ice cube in my Manhattan.  Relative to LA, Vegas, SF,etc., I think the $12 cost per drink is actually very reasonable.  Yes, it's hard to find and our cab driver had to circle the block a couple of times before we realized it was where a bunch of people were standing against the wall.

2012-06-10,5.0,"I really don't know how it took me so long to come here but I'm glad that I finally did. My boyfriend and I came here last night for our date night. We knew that if we came later in the night, we may have to wait in line, so, we came as early as 7pm. We were greeted nicely and sat quickly. My boyfriend insisted to be seated at the bar, which is fine by me. My boyfriend loves making cocktails, it's his new found hobby and he wanted to see how a real mixology works behind the bar. We definitely weren't disappointed. Patrick, our bartender/mixology greeted us, professionally, asked us for our orders. I ordered the Half Way Across Town and my boyfriend just told him a few of his favorites and pretty much giving Patrick the full confidence to surprise him. For me, my cocktail was amazing. It was delicious. And Patrick made my boyfriend a some sort of a variation of an Old Fashioned. According to him (my boyfriend) it was strong and perfect. We both shared some meats and cheese, which was also very fresh and amazing. Later on, Patrick just continued to make us custom drinks, off the menu, which all were very tasty and good. I was very impressed!!! Sorry, I can't recommend anything from the menu but I definitely recommend letting your mixology custom make your drinks, because those are normally the best. You're letting the master work their magic. I also recommend to sit at the bar because then you'll understand the work that was put into your drink.  We finished our little snacks and drinks with a dessert. I can't remember what it's called but it was 4 different chocolates balls, coffee ice cream served with homemade brownies. YUM!!!! It was so good!!! I loved everything that they offer at the Violet Hour. I loved those heavy drapes that separes the rooms, I loved the tall sofa/chairs that looks so mid-century-ish, the super dimmed atmosphere. Reminds me of Bourbon and Branch in San Francisco but less crowded and very minimal in design. I also appreciates the fact that I can enjoy the company of my boyfriend on our date night without having people trying to snuggle their way in to the bar to order their drinks by yelling out their orders like in other regular bars. This is actually very very nice. I find the variation of music that they're playing last night was a little odd. I wished they play something a little classy and dark to match the atmosphere but that didin't really ruin our whole experience. We left the Violet Hour very happy and definitely will plan to go back. Thank you, patrick for making our date night extra special :)",0.9995,0.679,0.299,0.021,0.5299176328721783

I also love postcards as business cards so I was sure to snag the one that came with our bill. Pretty reasonably priced (in terms of Chicago as I have seen) and the hidden door is awesome.

Dress up a little to be safe. Personally wouldn't recommend coming here with a large and/or cheap group of people. Booths can accommodate up to 6 people, ideally 4 people in my opinion.

2012-05-29,4.0,"I finally did it. I took the plunge. After years of walking past this place and getting scared and uncomfortable at a long line that leads to nowhere, I decided it was high time I suck it up and see what all the fuss was about. I mean, a bar with no windows, no hats, no sneakers, no plaid shorts, no popped collars (on purpose), no standing room and no Budweiser must be all right, right?  Well, the short answer is yes and one no. The no first: the absurd line waiting. While it does create a sense of super cool entitlement and class to those that finally part the curtains to the world beyond, the waiting is both boring and awful, putting the very definition of patience to the test.  When you finally make it into the doorway, you're placed in a small room fit for cramping and couples slowly pushing their way past you in an attempt to taste the sweet air of VH before you (this happened to me twice - where has all the human decency gone?) That being said, the bouncer was totally baller in recognizing the order in which people entered the doorway so as to thwart possible line-jumping jerk-offs.  The rest of the staff was also very cordial and inviting once finally we took our seats at the Tim Burton-esque tables. The menu of drinks is awesome; arranged first by type of alcohol, then by potency.  Regardless of where it lies on the list, every one of those drinks is sure to hand you three sheets you can prepare to toss to the wind. And the interesting selections will most certainly cater to any guest you might take here - friend, significant other, person you just met on the street, girl you're trying to date but just wants to be friends, friends of friends  - basically anyone. While admittedly the service was quite slow, I wasn't as concerned about getting my drinks quickly after a one hour wait (which I have heard is actually on the lighter side.)  Once you're in, it kind of feels nice to just sit and relax. It's such an effort making it through the doors, you might as well take a second to stop and enjoy life. And THEN drink heavily. Plus, in this case the slower service might actually work to your advantage, giving you time to assess how that drink you just inhaled affects your motor skills.  Well played Violet Hour.

By the end, I felt like this may have been a hostage situation to cause tables to remain full so the line can form outside the bar.....or lounge.....or speakeasy.....or dimly lit, heavily draped in grey (I am guessing that was the color....too dark in there to see).

2012-04-19,4.0,"One of Chicago's 'hidden' gems. Without sounding cliche, I can't help but say Violet Hour is one of the coolest bars in the Chicago. Designed almost as a modern day speakeasy, the windowless, signless facade is almost easy to miss when walking by. Most people don't even know there's a bar there. Once you walk in throw dark drapes you find yourself in a beautifully kept thoroughly private space to enjoy a few cocktails. Once you get over the theater of the space, kick back, relax, and enjoy some of the best drinks in town. The Old Fashioned is probably my favorite, but just about everything is pretty solid. They make the drinks stiff (as they should be) and they're worth every penny. Perfect spot for a quiet conversation or catching up with friends.

Be prepared on busy weekend nights to wait a full HOUR AND A HALF. We had to, but the drinks are so deliciously potent and the ambiance so calmingly beautiful that it's well worth it. The best seats in the house are definitely at the bar, where you have front row seats to the precise alchemy the bartenders practice to craft every single drink. The cocktail menu itself has the perfect mix of classics - most with a VH twist - and new inventions if you're feeling adventurous.  The quote from Bernard deVoto from which VH took its name sums it up perfectly: ""This is the violet hour, the hour of hush and wonder, when the affections glow again and valor is reborn, when the shadows deepen magically along the edge of the forest and we believe that, if we watch carefully, at any moment we may see the unicorn.""

However, once you are inside, it's a whole different story and you realize why this is considered one of the best bars in America and recently nominated for a Michelin Star.  It was a Thursday and  the a gorgeous sunny day in this crazy Chicago 'winter.' The sun was out in March and everybody was out on patios having a great time. After a few drinks at Northside, my friends and I were hungry so we went to Big Star for tacos. This, as always, did not disappoint. My friends are Wicker Park virgins and have yet to discover all the greatness that this neighborhood has to offer. They're yuppies that refuse to go West of I90. I told them about the Violet Hour across the street, and my one friend was so intrigued he paid the bill right away and said 'I have to check this place out.' He thought it was funny that there was no sign outside, but just a few people smoking. Honestly, if somebody did not tell you where the Violet Hour was, you would never know. I even tricked him to believing there was a secret 'knock, knock, kick' method to get in.  There was a short wait at 11pm on a thursday. However, my only knock came when the door man gave me a super pretentious and smug attitude when he saw I was wearing shorts and flip flops. I understand, this is not the type of place where you go to slam drinks but give me a break man, we were out since 3pm enjoying the beautiful weather. He gave me the look up and down and said 'ha, are you serious? Next time, no way they're gonna let you in."" I was with friends, so we went in anyway and the rest of the night was great.  As everyone as already said, you can't go wrong with the drinks. It's a bit overwhelming at first, but trust the waitress' suggestions. You really can't go wrong with anything. I got the Austin 75 because I'm a Vodka drinker and it was delicious.  We were amazed with the ambiance, feeling like we were in some Alice in Wonderland dream with the high backs to the chairs and the dimly lit front room. My friends were very impressed. We came to a conclusion that this is the place you take to wow a girl, no way they are not impressed.  Also, for the love of god please order the Chocolate plate. My friend's claimed not to be big fans of sweets, but by the end we were practically licking this plate. The truffles are delicious, but one in particular stood out.

Located in a neighborhood best known for being an extension of Lincoln Park (hip and trendy) and grunge (thanks to the likes of the Subterranean and Double Door), it's refreshing to find a place as refined, classy and upscale as the Violet Hour. I come for the ambiance, surround myself with good people and savor my cocktail. George the Door Host is tall, dark and handsome. He escorted us through the entrance and personally introduced us to the Hostess. We were seated in front of the working fireplace. While the ambiance was romantic, it was too warm to be comfortable. The drink selection is intimidating. The names and descriptions are confusing. It's like ordering sushi. You may not know what you're in for. Trust the professionals. There's true talent working behind the bar. Don't be afraid with what your Server suggests. You're guaranteed the only way you're going to be disappointed by your beverage is by choosing a whiskey drink when you already know you don't like whiskey! I say this but at the same time, I tasted a Gin (bleh!) concoction that my friend ordered and I LOVED it! All the mixed beverages are $12 each. It's worth every penny. My personal favorite: Mai Tai. It's served with fresh mint garnish and crushed ice. As the ice melts and the glass is less full, I mash the mint and it becomes a heavenly tasting Mojito! This is not a place where you slam down beers and make a spectacle of yourself. You have places like Six Corners and Tavern for that.

Now, the first caveat about this place is simple: you will wait in line for more than you expected it. Once they let you go inside, you'll have to wait again in a small room as soon as you step in. The second caveat is to not wear any frat-boy garb - this is a stylish and sophisticated lounge, not your average run-of-the-mill sports bar.

Anyway, moving on from the too-cool-for-school haters, I really enjoyed coming here. My boyfriend and I came for Valentine's Day and we showed up about 15 min before doors opened. I love the quiet atmosphere and the fact that they were playing soul and jazz all night. Between the two of us, we had six cocktails and four or five appetizers -- costing just under 100 dollars. The drinks were absolutely amazing. My boyfriend's favorite cocktail in the city is the old fashioned at Longman & Eagle. After drinking here he said he found a new favorite (or at least a rival). I tried a couple of the ""potable bitters"" drinks and they were all effing amazing. Appetizers were great. The best of everything we tried were the cod croquettes.

2012-02-13,1.0,"I went there with some friends one night.  I'm not sure why intelligent people would spend hard earned money to be treated like 6 year olds. Here are some of the things I learned were NOT allowed: - NO standing - You will be shown to your seat by a Violet Robot.  You are not allowed to move from your seating area.  I don't think you need to ask permission to use the washroom (I didn't have to go, but would have raised my hand if I needed to), but you are not allowed to move about your area.  Yes, you are in a group timeout. - NO Cell Phones - Now, I think this is actually a good rule.  Sitting around people constantly yammering into their phones is no good, but there are times when a quick text comes in handy.  Trying to coordinate a large group sometimes calls for improv, but no, don't think of texting here.  It's against the rules, and this is actually written and posted somewhere. -NO deviating from the menu - Don't even think that just because they have Vodka and Cranberry juice behind the bar, you'll be able to get a Vodka Cranberry.  What, are you crazy?  You have to order from the list of items on the menu.  I tried to get something else, no go, even though they had the ingredients.  So I dutifully ordered off the menu, like a good boy, lest I get sent to the Principal's office, or perhaps even expelled! -NO moving of the furniture - Ok, before anyone thinks I'm some aspiring interior decorator, let me explain.  We were seated in a large group, and I was on one end of our seating situation in some type of Alice in Wonderland huge chair.  The conversation at the other end caught my attention, and I leaned in to hear.  I already knew I wasn't allowed to actually walk over there, that would require standing, a punishable offense.  So I moved my chair in a bit, no more than a foot, and by no means causing anyone any inconvenience.  I was chastised by a Violet Robot - ""Sorry sir, you're not allowed to move the furniture"".  Ok.  Got it.  I just sat in my throne of isolation wondering what I could do, and thinking the drinks must be the stuff of legends for people to pay for this experience. Well the drinks came and they were tasty.  But the night was already ruined for me.  And, by the way, they were gracious enough to include the tip on the bill.  Yes, true to form and in the spirit of treating patrons like small children, they were nice enough to calculate it for us, and give themselves a tidy 20 percent tip in the process.  I guess that's the going rate for babysitting these days. DO go there if you need structure, if you have no social skills, if you don't value your money, and you are into being treated like a small child. Don't go there if you like choices, if you want something simple to drink, if you think waitstaff should actually WORK for tips, and if you want to just chill out and relax.  I found nothing relaxing about being chastised every so often... One star for the comedy.  I mean, it's kind of funny when I think of the absurdity of it all, but once was one time too many.",0.7629,0.757,0.124,0.119,0.5794954648526076

Expert level everything: Austin 75, In the Pines, and the Dark and Stormy. Sweet, interesting, bright, borderline deceptive alcohol content. Service is pretty hands off. Nowhere in Wicker Park that I've been to really had good service, though, and I have a couple theories on why. We ordered food - crispy fries, wonderful onion-y gnocchi, cod croquettes, and crostini. All were good. So why 4? I love craft cocktails and I've accepted this generally makes me sound like a douche extraordinaire. I generally am super easy to please with any well made cocktail - which these so, so are, and they're serious about doing them well.

2012-02-01,2.0,"Here's the scene - a beautiful bar behind a cool street mural and a thick velvet curtain, decorated in teal and white with chandeliers and high chairs built in Wonderland proportions.  The atmosphere is calm on a Sunday night and the decor makes it a little bit magical.  Your charmed heroine, Steph C., takes a seat at the bar with Michael K. and Janice K.  A young bartender comes over.  He has a patchy growth on his face that he thinks is a beard.  Your thirsty heroine studies the menu and settles on a drink called the Holy Mole, with tequila, sweet vermouth, Averna, and chocolate bitters. ""Can I get the Holy Mole?"" Patchy Face Growth tinkers with his tools, and says, ""Just so you know, it's a very strong drink."" Your just heroine notes that this is a reasonable warning, if not entirely typical, and says, ""Okay.  That's cool."" Patchy Face Growth disregards your equanimous heroine's response and puts her in her place.  ""Women don't usually like it.  Just warning you."" Your patient heroine feels a tingle of rage, but with saintly composure, she smiles and says, ""Got it."" Patchy Face Growth disregards your noble heroine's second assurance that she will not faint from the fumes, and says, ""I mean it's all booze.  Most women end up giving it to their boyfriends."" Your logical heroine notes with some generosity, ""I see.  Because it has chocolate, so I'm sure women order it expecting a milkshake despite the tequila and vermouth and Amaro.  We are so very silly.  But you need not be concerned, my dear Patchy Face Growth.  I have decent reading comprehension, despite my strong emotional reaction to the very mention of chocolate."" The bartender does not register that he has offended your gentle heroine, but he concedes and mixes her drink.  Your proud heroine grows nervous as she decides she must swallow whatever potent mixture comes her way - she will not brook Patchy Face Growth's smug expression should he see her wince. The drink arrives, and it is strong but smooth, with enough flavor and even tone to save her from crying at every sip.  She samples Mike and Jan's cocktails.  Mike's is The Violet Hour Old Fashioned, with Old Forester, demerara syrup, and Angostura bitters - it comes without a disclaimer for burly Mike, a good if unremarkable Old Fashioned.  When Mike asks Patchy Face Growth for an Old Fashioned with mezcal, the surly bartender advises against the concoction.  Patchy Face Growth looks uncomfortable with improvisation, as if he has just seen a woman in a pants suit.  Mike gets a Woolworth Flip instead, with bourbon, Carpano Antica, cynar, a whole egg, and root beer bitters.  It is frothy and thick, with root beer sweetness, but its lack of balance makes it unappealing to your sensitive heroine's fragile palate.  Jan's Pimm's Cup Variation #5 is a lovely refreshing drink, fit for a lady, with Pimm's #1, lemon, apricot liqueur, ginger syrup, orange, and blackberries. Your adventurous heroine almost never stops after one cocktail, but she decides that one drink is enough at Violet Hour.  She considers tipping light, but as her party has moved to a table to drink without the judging leer of Patchy Face Growth, she makes no protest at her waitress's expense.  As she and her friends leave, Mike slips away quietly and procures an apology on her behalf.  Your hasty heroine has already left the building, and she regrets missing that confrontation. Your pensive heroine sighs.  ""Violet Hour could have been so much better,"" she whispers to the winter bird that alights on her shoulder.  ""It was so charming, and the drinks were pretty good.  All tainted by a couple dumb words from one dumb bartender.  It's a shame, isn't it, Bird?"" ""Chirp chirp,"" says the winter bird. ""Yes, he apologized, but he had to get called out."" ""Chirp chirp chirp,"" says the winter bird. ""Yes.  I will write a review.  That is my best revenge.""

2012-01-30,5.0,"I was in Chicago for a girlfriends' weekend, and our cocktails at the Violet Hour were absolutely what we needed! One of my friends who is new to the city said she heard it was a great cocktail lounge, and once we got there, we knew it was perfect for what we wanted! It's luxurious, the drinks are delicious, the seating is quiet and private, the music is soothing and moody, the nibbles are tasty, and we were completely thrilled! Yes, some of the things the Yelpers write are true, though I don't think they were necessarily negatives. First, we didn't wait AT ALL. We arrived around 6 p.m. on a Thursday, and we got right in. Two of us were together, waiting on our third friend, and we stood outside for a bit because we didn't know if they would seat us if we weren't all there. But we were cold, and people kept going in, so we thought we better try or we might be waiting in a line; we went in and said there were two of us, and we would have a third, and they seated us immediately. We were given two of the very high-backed chairs (I loved those!) and an ottoman. We knew that our friend would probably not feel comfortable sitting on that ""footstool,"" so we asked if we could move to an empty booth, and the waitress said ""of course!"" immediately and helped us move. The booth was wonderful, and we felt as if we were in one of our living rooms all evening -- a living room with a hostess, a waitress and amazing cocktails!  Second, the lounge is not marked outside. We were a little flustered when we arrived because we weren't sure where it was, but we were waiting for our friend and watched people go in, so, with the help of Google maps, we confirmed it was the right place.  Third, other people on Yelp have complained that the Violet Hour doesn't allow for standing customers, and, honestly, I thought it was awesome! By the time we left, the place was full, but it never felt crowded or irritating. I appreciate that the hosts/hostesses keep the numbers down to preserve the experience for those who are seated. If you want to go, try to go early on an off night, as we did, and you'll get to enjoy it. The lounge doesn't allow cell phone use, and we took this so seriously, we texted from inside our purses! But, again, I really appreciated that some Loudy Louderson wasn't screaming into his/her phone at the next table over.  Finally, we all really liked the music! When we arrived, an older Rufus Wainwright album was playing, and my friend was thrilled with it, as was I. I found the music to be conducive to our conversation and enjoyment, not replacing it. What did we have? I stuck with the Juliet and Romeo all evening. It tastes like summer, and I just loved it, and didn't want to switch. It arrived in a champagne glass with a tiny carafe on the side with the ""rest"" of the drink, which I appreciated (these were not cheap!). My friend sampled more of the menu. They tried the raspberry cobbler, the Austin and  Pimm's traditional cocktail. The waitress worked with my friend and suggested things based on what she said she liked. We all liked all of our drinks, every single time. I also ordered food, the crispy pork belly and the goat cheese, and it was PLENTY. I shared and still couldn't eat it all. The pork belly was like ""pork belly nuggets,"" crispy on the outside and melty-tender on the inside. The ""dip"" was creme fraiche, and was amazing. The cheese came with PLENTY of bread and a fruit spread as well, and the prices for the food were reasonable. The only quibble I have/agree with is that they will NOT make you a standard cocktail. They will ONLY make the cocktails on the list, or, I guess, alternatives from their repertoire. My friend, after trying a couple of the menu items wanted a pomegranate martini, and the waitress said, ""we don't have that."" I think if you have a full bar, you can probably make a martini! That written, the cocktails we had were absolutely delicious!  Honestly, our experience was nearly perfect, from the greeting at the door, the service (from many people, the hostess, who checked on us multiple time, to the waitress, to the runners who brought drinks and food). The ambience and decor, the privacy of the setting, the luxuriousness of the decor, the pleasantness of the music, the secluded feeling of the whole setting.  I would absolutely go back to the Violet Hour next time I'm in Chicago. I've had lovely times at the SoHo Grand and the Brandy Library in New York City, and this definitely rivals those experiences.",0.9994,0.785,0.188,0.027,0.5492006531480216

If your date only drinks PBR or doesn't know how to appreciate a finely crafted Old Fashioned, this will also become quickly apparent.

2012-01-16,5.0,"I've been here a few times and every time, it's been great. The most recent visit was last week. There were four of us catching up (one of us was from out of town). We got there about 7 on a Thursday night and it was really busy. We had to wait for a four person table to open up. A couple groups of two went in while we waited, but the hostess was trying to figure something out for us. She created a kind of makeshift table for four at two of the high backed chairs, pulling up two stools for us to sit. About ten minutes later, a booth opened up, and we were promptly moved to be more comfortable. Much appreciated. The decor/ambiance is great. Very hip. There are dark, thick, textured curtains, tall-backed chairs, and lighting is dim. We saw a lot of dates happening that night. The best part of  all is definitely the drinks. The menu is arranged by liqueur choice - gin, vodka, brandy, rum, tequila, etc. You really can't go wrong with any of the choices. My personal favorites from the night were: 1. Juliet & Romeo. A refreshing mix of Beefeater gin, mint, cucumber, and rose water. This may just be my favorite cocktail of all time. 2. Blue Ridge Manhattan. If you like whiskey, you'll love this drink. 3. Poor Liza. This one tastes like an alcoholic pear. Much better than a pear martini. I don't think they take reservations, so be prepared to wait if you go.

2011-12-22,3.0,"3.5 I've been to some bars in L.A. where bartenders have told me they were inspired by the cocktails at Chicago's The Violet Hour. I've read some articles about this bar and it was my #1 cocktail bar I had to try. After dinner at Moto, we headed over and experienced a brief wait. It wasn't too terrible but some jerks were also waiting and causing a ruckus. It seems the three misters were drunk and/or high. And if we hadn't been let in at the right moment, I would have spoken to the bouncer as one of the house rules at the Violet Hour is not bringing anyone you wouldn't want at your mother's house for Sunday supper. These three were definitely not welcome guests. I lost track of them and perhaps they were let in after all. I saw someone with a baseball cap on and it was clearly against their house rules. Still, the Violet Hour speaks of a certain genteelness and charm. The highbacked chairs reminded me of the chairs on the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland. They afforded privacy and perhaps a few secrets were exchanged. Although they didn't entirely block your view. The booth next to our table was clearly on display and vice versa. The cocktail menu is short but the book of liquors was quite heavy. I opted for one of their signature cocktails since we weren't at the bar. I tend to like to sit at the bar and chat with the bartender to get a custom cocktail. The one I ordered from their list was fantastic.  Alas, we only had time for one before we disappeared into the night. But considering the pub crawl we had the night before, it was probably for the best.",0.9683,0.817,0.123,0.06,0.5932706766917294

2011-12-16,4.0,"In a burg with 4000 or so bars, how does one distinguish oneself from all the others? I had the opportunity to see for myself the other night, and the luck to visit the Hour with a friend who works there. So kind of an insider's initiation, if you will. All I can say was it was a thorougly enjoyable experience. While not much of a cocktail guy, and pretty boring and rut-like in my cocktail consumption habits (traditional martini, scotch and soda, margarita,) I am a huge fan of flavors and flavor pairings, and anything that dances on the tongue. So I tried both the Juliet and Romeo (or was it a Joliet and Romeoville?) and the Dark and Stormy. The first was Beefeater, Mint, Cucumber and Rosewater. The second, Brugal Anejo Rum, Lime Cruzon, Blackstrap and Ginger Syrup. OK, so I had no idea about some of those ingredients, but my chum Tyler educated me. They were both tasty new and  experiences for me. The ambiance, the vibe or esthetic I liked very much. It's classy, enthusiastic, sudued and intimate. And the postcard they have to describe the customers they want could be interpreted by some as a New Yorkish attitude: no baseballs caps, no Lite beers, and an actual dress and behavior code. Personally, I find it refreshing. As David Manilow from Check Please points out about restaurants, a place needs to know what it is. And sometimes that lack of identity leads to failure. Not true here. And those waiting in line on the way out attests to the success. The staff was pleasant and appeared to be enjoying the joint themselves. One price for all cocktails ($12.00) makes things simple. While I could'nt make this my neighborhood ""hang,"" it's surely a great special occasion place. Great for dates, celebrations. But be mindful that they do not encourage large groups.  If you don't like that, you can check out the other 3999 alternatives.",0.9929,0.753,0.184,0.063,0.5692573051948053

A tall curtain & a well dressed man greeted us. We walked through the curtains to see a beautiful sight. A room with dramatic tall backed chairs, lowly lit with tall curtains separating each room, chandeliers, tea candles at every table. There is a whimsy about the Violet Hour. There is something familiar, yet mysterious about it all. It wasn't at all pretentious. It felt easy & welcoming & I didn't want to leave! Juliet & Romeo: I substituted Hendricks Gin for Beefeater, Rose Water & Mint & Cucumber. A must must try. It is so absolutely well rounded in flavor that I'm certain I'll be dreaming of it for years to come. Pims Cup Variation #5 : Blackberry, Ginger, Apricot Liqueur, Lemon & Pims #1. This one had a nice range of fruity & sweet but was a bit too girly froofy for me to order again. Seasonal Sezerac : Rye, apricot liqueur, absinthe & Peychaud's bitters. An exceptional cocktail that I highly recommend trying. I don't even know how to categorize the taste profile. It's smooth & not too sweet, not too anything. Just a whole lot of RIGHT.  The Violet hour uses large square column like ice cubes in their cocktails. This I think lends to the insistence on making most well crafted cocktails. You aren't going to get a cup of ice with a touch of alcohol here. The ice, being more block-like kept the drink cool while not watering down the concoction. I like this attention to detail.

Just going to this place is an adventure for anyone who likes cocktails (seriously, who doesn't like cocktails!?!?) and a big part of the adventure is picking out which one you want to order. It is like one of those ""choose your own adventure"" books I used to read as a kid (am I dating myself by saying that? do they still make those or do kids just play video games now?).  The whole list is broken up into sections based on spirit. Brandy, rum, whiskey, tequila, bitters, and usually there are a couple vodka drinks for those who are scared. I always have a tough time choosing which one to order. I try to bring friends and then convince them to order something different, so we all can share!  The cocktails are very creative and stay true to form by typically using only 3-4 ingredients. They use purified water for their ice and make cubes specifically for different glasses or drinks. My favorite is the highball ice cube which is a ling cube that stands straight up in the glass. This place even has rules of etiquette posted on the walls. I wish some of them were posted everywhere sometimes...  If there is anything I don't like about the Violet Hour is that it can be very dark in there sometimes and at times service can take a while, but I just expect that. The drinks are handcrafted, pieces of creative art. You cannot rush them.  Go check out the Violet Hour if you are just visiting or live in Chicago. The drink list changes seasonally, so you can always come back and try something new.  What is your next adventure...",0.9524,0.853,0.106,0.04,0.5579338842975207

2011-08-23,5.0,"Violet Hour is one of Chicago's hidden gems. Totally  inconspicuous.my  friends and I waltzed in on a Friday evening before there was a line. This place definitely oozes that grown and sexy vibe. Although very dimly lit, the decor was that swanky vintage look with the white high back chairs and oldschool hollywood glamour vibe. I expected that hipster attitude from the staff but not so at all!  This is coming from someone who cannot hold liquor well and rarely thinks it tastes particularly good. I'd rather drink kool aid and keep my wits about me. But....that punch, my friend, the punch. I don't remember what it was called, but it was all sweet and fruity and just right sitting in a punch bowl with a giant ice block in it. I'm definitely not one for shots and feeling the burn, but whatever our waitress graced us with (just for kicks), was yummy goodness. who knew?",0.9842,0.756,0.21,0.034,0.5372698412698412
2011-08-23,4.0,"The Presbyterian is one of the best cocktails I've ever had. It had that ginger whisky bite I love. Spectacular. And Violet Hour has large ice cubes shaped to match the glasses, which means there's very little melting and watering down of drinks over time. Very classy.  So the cocktails were fantastic, but the service left something to be desired. It was a Monday night; we were seated and ordered quickly, but then our drinks took at least 20 minutes to come out. After we'd ordered a second round, we asked for the check and waited 30 minutes for it. Finally we just left cash on the table. Our server was very nice, but she either had too many tables or forgot about us. So I do not recommend Violet Hour if you're in a hurry, but I would definitely recommend it if you love a fancy mixed drink. The bar itself, in speakeasy fashion, does not have a sign outside the door. Just look for the red wall across the street from Big Star.",0.9618,0.831,0.136,0.032,0.4507591442374051
2011-08-21,4.0,"I'm not typically one for elitist type bars - I mean, I'm from Austin... It's all about the humble dive bar here! But I must say, there is a certain intrigue about The Violet Hour. The door doesn't look like a door, the exterior is regularly repainted to confuse passerby's, once inside, the minimalist hallway adds to the anticipation... What will it be like? Will the drinks live up to the hype? The interior is very understated and elegant, reminiscent of 20s glamour. Lush velvet curtains hanging from warehouse height ceilings dividing the large space, crystal chandeliers dot the room with low light. Our party of four was sat at a booth in the middle part of the lounge.  And then you hear the music. The only fail of this cocktail lounge. Not only too loud but very odd music selection. I want to talk to my friends, instead I was yelling. And then whispering. And then startled back to yelling again. Not what I want to experience in such an elegant space. Maybe jazz would be a better option? Or just turning down the volume? The drinks. Yes. The jewels of this establishment. Let me start by saying it did my Texas hill country heart proud to see Austin made Tito's as the only vodka on their specialty drink selection. Yes. Tito's is the best. Thank you for recognizing that fact, Chicago. At our table, we enjoyed Thick as Thieves, the Blinker, Austin 75, Old Fashioned, Fang's Out and the Juliet and Romeo. Each one was perfectly crafted and delicious. Our waiter was helpful but a little absent. The bartender catered to the pregnant woman at the table by mixing a delicious $5 mocktail. $12 for each drink is pricey but worth it when mixed as thoughtfully as ours were.  Some reviewers have mentioned the list of rules. Well, on a Tuesday night, it seems they weren't strictly enforced - we saw a young man in a wife beater (not that I particularly cared). We did wait about 20 minutes to get a table and I'm not sure I would wait in a line that went around the block, but overall, I believe the Violet Hour was a worthy Chicago experience.",0.9966,0.742,0.2,0.058,0.5378031206519579

I feel like Chicago lacks this option. We walked back and forth down the block a few times before I realized where the door was, but upon entering, our 7 person party was sat immediately. We had called ahead due to the size of our party. I'm still a little confused on this no reservations policy, because we definitely seemed to have a reservation.  The ambiance oozes romance, and would be my  go-to spot for setting the mood. The high back chairs, open spaces, dim lights and creative cocktail options combine for the perfect date recipe. I was a little shy with the cocktail list, but my cohorts were adventurous, trying the Pimm's Cup, The Moscow Mule and all variations of fruited cocktails. To start, I had an amazing glass of red wine, and split a bottle of champagne before I was ready to dive in. The Romeo & Juliet was amazing, the cucumber taste was absolutely refreshing, and I've been dreaming about it ever since.  We also ordered the Edwards Ham, Grilled Lamb Sausage, Artisan cheese plate and some sort of shrimp tartare. All the food was delicious, but nothing particularly memorable. However, this worked well alongside drinks that offer a medley of engaging flavors.  Overall, Violet Hour was a major win.",0.9959,0.727,0.239,0.034,0.5278595478595478

2011-07-31,5.0,"After waiting patiently for months to venture out to Wicker Park to try Violet Hour, I can definitely say it lived up to the hype that I had created for myself (as well as what others had told me.) As many yelpers have said, it is easy to walk by this place, especially if you're not careful to lookout for the address. It looks like a construction site with a peeling mural disguising the entrance which is literally just a door handle sticking out of a wall. Upon entering, you go through two sets of heavy curtains that unveil an extremely dark lounge. Needless to say, it took several minutes to adjust, as well as fumbling around in my wallet to find my ID to show the hostess. Upon being seated in high backed chairs with a great view of the bar, my eyes finally adjusted to focus on the menu. My boyfriend and I decided on getting a whiskey drink each--I chose the Barbed Wire Daisy and he went with the Summer Sazerac. Initially I was a little disappointed with my drink, as it appeared to be a pink girly drink that was quite sweet on the first few sips. Although, it redeemed itself as I tasted the complex flavors of the cinnamon syrup and orange bitters as they complimented the whiskey. My boyfriend LOVED his drink, and remarked that it was probably the best mixed whiskey drink that he has had to date. I too enjoyed his drink, as it was classic and simple, and extremely tasty. I would have loved to had another drink, but dropping $50+ on two drinks a person is a little much in one night on drinks alone.

2011-07-29,4.0,"Alright.  Let's get one thing straight, for all of you who love to overuse the word ""pretentious.""  A pretentious lounge is one that has all the trimmings and trappings of the upper crust, yet the bartender doesn't know how to make a stiff drink.  A pretentious person would be one who believes they're better than the next, yet gets their cultural fix from the latest trendy website.   Violet Hour is not pretentious.  It takes a shot at being classy, it has high-priced drinks, the lights are overly dimmed, but it delivers on almost everything it hopes to be.   If you don't want to learn how complex liquor can really be, don't go here.  Go to any number of bars in the area and get yourself a PBR or shot of Jack.  This is a place where you bring close friends to have honest conversations and enjoy the creations of some very skilled bartenders.   The drinks:  let's start here, as this is the most important part.  I am a whiskey man.  Bourbon, American, Scotch, Irish, I love them all.  As such, the Old Fashioned is my favorite cocktail.  The Violet Hour Old Fashioned is the best bar-made Old Fashioned I've ever had.  The other drinks are great as well, but I usually stick to the Old Fashioned because, as my grandfather always said, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it.""  The Old Fashioned has never been broken, and it certainly isn't here. The ambiance:  the other half of the VH equation, and the one most hotly debated (a drink can't be pretentious, can it?).  I'm not going to describe it (I'll let the pictures do the talking), but I'll tell you it's a love-it-or-hate-it deal.  Having been born-and-raised in the shadow of Manhattan, I love it.  It's one of the only serious lounges I've found in Chicago, a formerly classy city unfortunately now filled with hipsters, frat boys, and undersexed 50-year-old men (you know what neighborhoods I'm talking about).  I understand that not everybody wants to hang out in a dimly lit lounge and chat with good friends over a great glass of whiskey, but if you don't like it, just go anywhere else in Chicago.   To sum it up, Violet Hour is a fun place for mid-20-somethings who've decided they're done with college, and want to trade up for something nicer.  The music is a bit too loud, and the waitstaff can sometimes be aloof or unfriendly (the bartenders are great though), but overall, it's a must-try for anyone passing through Chicago.  If you're with a buddy, hang out at the bar and chat with the bartenders.  If you're with some friends, get a table and enjoy the company.",0.9986,0.76,0.214,0.025,0.5149958228905598

It is probably still one of the best cocktail lounges in the country as well, despite some of the highly publicized new kids on the block. If you are looking for a place to spend a few intimate hours with a small group of friends in a relaxed but sophisticated setting while sipping original, well-crafted cocktails, this is still your best place in the city. While you can get equally good drinks now at places like Sable, nowhere competes in terms of atmosphere and steady creativity. Over the years, I've been very impressed by their ability to keep creating interesting new drinks which complement a now growing number of Violet Hour classics. To name just a few of the classics: the Juliet & Romeo, the Lady Gray, the Miraflores, the Dogwood Manhattan, and the Negroni Tredici. Recently, I was very impressed by a tall whiskey drink, Arrows of Outrageous Fortune. Violet Hour also consistently makes the best classic cocktails in the city. My favorite is their rendition of the Martinez.  My only knock on the place is that I've noticed a consistent difference in drink quality and staff knowledgeability between weeknights and weekends. It seems the place went through period during which a bunch of newbies were cutting their teeth on weeknights. I haven't been back on a weeknight in a while, so I don't know if that situation has improved. But the weekend staff is still top notch.

My favorite experience involved the head bartender spending the same amount of time making a non-alcoholic drink for my boyfriend, who doesn't drink, as he did making the rest of our drinks from off the menu.  He seemed to put a lot of thought into it and even asked my boyfriend if he was okay with him adding bitters to the drink, since he knew it would add a nice flavor but also knew that technically they are alcoholic.  His drink was just as good as ours and you could barely even tell it was the non-alcoholic one in the bunch. A very nice experience, but only for every once in awhile.  You'll go broke drinking $12 4oz cocktails every night.",0.9902,0.821,0.15,0.029,0.530982905982906

This is not a place to bring your group of 12 crazy friends looking to get Drunk with a capital D. Instead, its a quiet, muted atmosphere with thick drapes hanging and seats for all the patrons.  All the drinks are $12 each, but very well worth it. The menu is divided into categories by spirit, and the bartenders are all extremely knowledgeable about their craft. They give excellent recommendations, and I would suggest sitting at the bar at least once to watch them create, mix and blend your drink. The line can be long (esp on the weekends) but the excellent service from the staff, relaxed ambiance and delicious drinks are worth the wait.",0.9897,0.726,0.254,0.021,0.6491228070175439
2011-04-19,4.0,"I'm in the industry and greatly appreciate the product, pace, and atmosphere offered by the Violet Hour. Any comments about this place being too ""pretentious"" and folks having problems with the ""rules""? Those folks should get over themselves. The rules? No cell phones, no baseball caps, no Jagerbombs or similar bombs. The other rules amount to something along the lines of ""order off the menu, drinks and otherwise"" and ""don't act like you're a complete ass and like the world revolves around you and you alone"". I know, it's asking a lot for some folks. If you want to order a pitcher of Bud Light, shots of Jameson, a mundane cosmo, or chicken tenders or a burger and fries with a kosher pickle accompanied by yellow mustard and Heinz ketchup, even though it isn't on the menu, this isn't the place to go, that's all.  If that doesn't suit you, trek out to the burbs or to the Gold Coast for some customer-is-always-king/queen-place-even-if-it's-not-on-the-menu-and-we-have-to-run-to-Jewel-or-Dominick's-to-get-the-ingredients place, and enjoy the perceived ""product"" and ""service"" you receive. But then, there are dozens of places to go for that kind of thing. If you want a well crafted cocktail with great ambiance, and waitstaff  that is attentive without being overbearing or intrusive, this is a great place. The music isn't so loud to inhibit conversation and actually adds to the atmosphere rather than dominating or detracting from it, which is rare enough in itself. Given the cost of a Captain and Coke in many places in town that aren't dives, $12 for a well crafted cocktail is far from outrageous, even if it takes a few minutes longer than it takes to pour an ounce of crappy rum into an 8 oz. Coke. You want shooters and $7 generic martinis in 37 seconds, go to Bar Louie or some such place. Here, you get a unique cocktail, staff that is aware but hands off, and a killer atmosphere. Well worth the $12 and a relatively short wait (although the last time I went was on a Tuesday around 9:00 and I didn't wait at all). The space provides a wonderful sense of privacy with the 7' tall chair backs and seating limited to the number of people in your party. It's a comfortable, relaxed environment, The smoked trout crostini is not only really tasty but it's a steal at $6. (The cheese plate ,on the other hand, was pretty good but over priced at $14). Don't let the nay sayers sway you, just understand that it isn't a high volume, drunk frat house bar that will do anything and everything to appease you, and you'll have a great time.

I felt like one of the chosen and paying $12.00 for a drink was wholly justified just to be there.  And then there are the drinks... The bartenders actually use real-live eyedroppers to perfect the taste of each drink that is prepared. The man who served me actually spend a good five minutes tinkering with something that at that point had become more of a concoction than a drink, as he siphoned drop after drop and in between tasting it some sort of mixing thing before he discarded it. When he was finally satisfied, I tried the thing.  The beverage was more bitter than I would have liked, which is why I almost rated this establishment a four, however, his effort was remarkable and his devotion unerring, which redeemed it.

I have to admit that I was a little taken aback by the non-descript entrance, as it's just as unnoticeable as most of the grafitti, bill-posted buildings in this area.  After giving the door gentlemen my Id, I had no idea that a luxurious underworld of a 60's inspired swag lounge awaited; laden with crystal chandeliers, high-back chairs, intimate votive candles and private gathering areas for all to indulge in. This was extremely decadent.  The waitress was good, although a little unfamiliar with a few of the cocktails on their menu, but it was a tad loud and I have a tendency to be soft-spoken, in her defense. She suggested a couple drinks and my boyfriend and I were far from disappointed.  The bartenders seem extremely knowledgeable, warm-spirited, and really have captured the essence of making you feel in a time warped vintage cocktail lounge parlor.  Although I didn't eat, they had a few ""creative"" appetizers on the menu that I would be curious to sample.  All in all a great time with fancy cocktails (not cheap) and an atmosphere that is unlike another that I have experienced in this city. Will definitely be back!

This place is great if you're looking for a very calm and intimate evening with a total of 2-4 people. It's very dark and relaxed in there. The seating is pretty neat. They have intimate tables and booths, but you can also sit at the bar, which I recommend if you are alone or with just one other person. It's pretty cool watching the bartenders make the drinks.  I've taken a nibble or two of their food. Nothing special - a bit over priced. Go out to dinner before you come here - come here for your before bed cocktail or two. Or three. (If you can afford it, hah).  They do not take reservations, and yes, you will have to wait in line.  I was aware of this, so I was not too peeved about it. My friend and I ended up waiting about 20 minutes, which wasn't so bad.  Though, I am confused as to why the host continuously kept going towards the end of the line to let people in ahead of everyone waiting. Maybe they were his friends? Interesting, considering how much they try to emphasize all of their rather pretentious rules of waiting in line, no reservations, etc. A total of at least 10 people got moved up ahead of me in line by staff, while I was waiting.  I would have given this place 4 stars, but after that experience, I feel that I have to knock another off. Don't try to be pretentious and post lists of rules everywhere if you are not going to follow them to a tee. But yeah. Great cocktails.

2011-02-24,2.0,"Pretentious. Right when you get inside you see a list of rules. Some of them are understandable, some of them are just plain stupid. This place tries way too hard, like the dude that walks around campus with a pink polo, popped collar, wearing aviators... except fancier than that dude. It also takes itself way too seriously. FYI Violet Hour: you're in Wicker Park, not at the top of the Park Hyatt Tokyo. It gets two stars because inside is really nice looking and unique. I've never been in a bar like it. But whoever said this place is supposed to take a hint from 1920s speakeasies... what are you smoking? Aren't speakeasies supposed to be... fun? Happening? Dancing? Merriness? The chairs are really cool looking but they're not comfortable at all. The drinks are ALL $12. Does that mean you're going to get a better cocktail? Maybe. Is it worth $12? No.  I ordered a whiskey old fashioned. It was damn good and had excellent flavor. For ice, they use a gigantic ball of ice instead of separated cubes. It's cool, but makes it so that you get even less drink for your money. That ice displaces so much liquid you're drinking half as much as you would be with cubes.  One of the rules on their little sign might as well have said, ""No having too much fun."" It's like a bunch of 20-somethings in a room together trying to be on their best behavior. Why? For who? Nobody is loud. Nothing is excited. It's snobby. It's yuppie. It's not for me. This place is for 21 to 30 year olds who want to pretend like they're rich and elegant for a night.

I'm pretty much satisfied with a draft pint of Fat Tire and watching a televised sporting event involving two teams I don't care about from a shaky bar stool.  I'm not a sucker for ambiance at all, but when a place makes a modest effort to give itself a swanky 1960s look, I'll bite. It's the closet thing I can get to proper time travel since Home Depot doesn't carry the flux capacitor I need for the time machine I built out of spare telephone parts and my old Castle Grayskull. You're not just going to see a couple of Andy Warhol posters and listen to The Beatles here.  Aside from the subtle hints of looking like a set on Mad Men, it's a very relaxing atmosphere. It's very dimly lit so nobody can notice your blemishes or any remnants of that facial tattoo you got after that ""anything but clothes"" party your freshman year. The chairs are probably the most comfortable things to sit on without having to pay a membership fee or overstay your welcome at The Sharper Image. Between the lighting, the seats and the potent cocktails, you might have to make a pretty good effort to not fall asleep.  Drinks are $12 each unless otherwise noted. It sounds overpriced, but a lot of time and effort is put into them, and they follow their recipes to the last milliliter. Once you taste their Old Fashioned, you'll know where those extra few dollars went. The term ""half assed"" is not tossed around freely at Violet Hour.  This is a great place to bring a date or a friend, but also not a bad place to drop in by yourself and sit at the bar. The bar men are very friendly and more than willing to talk to you while they mix your drink. One thing they won't take kindly to is phone talking. They have a pretty strict policy against them.

DRINKS:  Creative and delicious.  They mix drink ingredients in a way that maximizes the different flavors.  The drinks in and of themselves are an experience.   I was slightly overwhelmed by the menu so I gave the bartender a quick synopsis of what I had been drinking so far that evening, as well as what I like in general.

All interactions with the waiter were really awkward. He was too soft spoken for my liking. I enjoyed the music selection. My drink was good, and I did really appreciate that the waiter split the bill to charge all our credit cards - though I guess it's easy with each cocktail being exactly $12.

It's a vintage feel with beautiful white crown molding, pastel blue walls and giant wing back chairs creating a feel of intimacy. The gregorian style chandeliers and dim candle light add to the appeal with american folk style music playing in the background. The drinks are strong and meant to be that way so keep that in mind. And as previous posts say it's all about the ice. The chunk of ice in my drink was massive and it's all about sipping and taking your time. I have to admit I was apprehensive of egg whites in my drink, but that with the bitters and of course the rum was amazing! I have fallen in love with the ""hour of hush"" and cannot wait to go back. I definitely advise getting there early buddying up with the hostess and leaving your number to grab a bit to eat at one of the great restaurants in Wicker Park while you wait for a table.

It was brought out by a guy and not our waitress. The never served beer was on our check. When we were trying to get the guy's attention to make sure he removed it, the beer finally came out. However, it was too late and we were ready to bounce. And he made such a stink about it when we asked that the beer be removed.  Out of courstesy he probably should have left the beer behind, on the house, but no such thing.

2011-01-17,5.0,"This is everything I ever wanted in a bar and more. You see, I heard about this place 5 years ago when I was about to turn 21. I was determined to have my 21st here as my first legit drink. But I'm queue-phobic, especially during a Chicago winter.  Five years and many many legit drinks later, I finally made it. It was actually pretty easy to find -- look for the yellow light on the edge of the block, last notable place before a strip mall with the Lou's in it.  First -- the moment you step into the actual bar, past an unmarked door and 2 heavy drapes -- you smell this incredible honey-gin-lavender scent. Though I'm not a gin kinda girl, this particular smell was incredibly intoxicating. It's a smell I could huff all day, a smell I wish I could bottle and take with me, a smell that IS the Violet Hour. Then -- you are seated in a series of tables with the high backed chairs creating intimacy with an ounce of voyeurism. Your conversations feel intimate yet you can still see other patrons if you glimpse through the chairs. Two chairs. A table. A candle. A bottle of water. And drinks that will tickle all of your senses. Add a dash of conversation and you have the beginning of a great night. I want - no. I NEED more Violet Hour in my life.  Winter Julep Mint on the nose, made with rum. A little too boozey for me.  Mulled Cider Cardamom perfection. Not too sweet. Well rounded and full of warmth. Austin 75 Hibiscus syrup, vodka, sparkling, orange. I didn't get any of the floral, just a pleasing energizing citrus flavor. Really wakes up the taste buds. Coffee Ayay Looks like it will be a hot drink, but it's cold -- it's smooth, and warms you up with the flavors. Juliet and Romeo As I mentioned above -- I hate gin. Or so I thought I hated gin. This drink mellows out gin's usually overpowering juniper berry taste. The cucumber's coolness, the rose nose, and the mint. It's so refreshing. I could drink a million of these. I am now much more open to gin drinks because of this incredible creation. And the most amazing drink I've ever had: the Gilded Cage Tito's vodka, lemon, Peychaud's bitters, honey and egg white. EGG WHITE? In a DRINK? If I never made meringue before, I would probably avoid any drink made with egg white. But knowing that egg whites give a silky mouth feel without the weight of cream -- I had to know how it worked in a drink. The egg white adds a whole new dimension to a cocktail -- mouthfeel.  The Gilded Cage is the perfect vodka cocktail. All others pale in comparison. Way to raise the bar to new heights, Violet Hour. Overall, we spent $72 (without tip, after taxes) on 6 amazing and well crafted drinks. No cover, decent service, and an atmosphere unlike anything else? Then this place is a bargain. We came before 10pm, service was spotty at times, and did not wait in line. When we left on a Sunday at 10:30pm there was some line, but still inside.  My only regret is not coming sooner.",0.9666,0.853,0.1,0.047,0.5020467385721622

(knock on wood) I felt the need to celebrate. I had heard all the hype. Read about the rules. Heard varying opinions on this place. But I was ready to finally lose my Violet Hour virginity. And as soon as I walked through the curtains into this beautiful, sexy space, I readily handed over my VH v-card. My friends (who were no strangers to this place) suggested we meet up early. (Clearly they know Jo W. waits in line for no one.) We arrived around 6:30 and easily got a table, but one trip around the bar on the way to the restroom (which is adorable, btw) told me that everyone else had the same idea - open for half an hour and already full save for two tables. Impressive. (And on our way out we literally had to push through the crowd waiting to get in.) I admit that I struggled with their drink menu. My true love is vodka, and the mere three drinks they offered up with vodka weren't calling out to me. But I threw caution to the wind and started things with an Austin 75. When it arrived it looked and smelled delicious, but I have to admit this wasn't my favorite. It was too sweet, and something was just missing for me. While we sipped on our first round we ordered a cheese plate, which was delightful. As I type this my mouth is watering thinking of it, especially that white cheddar cheese... For round two I ordered a Moscow Mule. Because Oprah told me to. Kids, listen to Oprah, for SHE IS WISE. When I took my first sip I thought, ""NOW we're talkin."" Refreshing. Delicious. Smooth. This drink reminded me of summer for some reason, and I liked it. Service was outstanding. Our server kept an eye on us, but never bothered us unless he saw we needed something. When a friend asked for recommendations, he asked the right questions, clearly knew the menu inside and out, and delivered up a home run for my friend. Violet Hour made the night easy and relaxing, the perfect way to spend an evening with friends. When we left, we agreed we felt warm and happy without a hint of drunk. I like that feeling.

We had to wait about 20 minutes (maybe on a Thursday night?), then got seated in a delightful booth. All of their seating creates privacy in an otherwise wide open space. I think it's great. I'm in love with the tall backed chairs.  The second time was at 11 on a Monday night. We were promptly seated at one of the only tables open, and there was seating available at the bar as well. So in regards to getting in, if you hate waiting, don't go on the weekend. Sorry. Now to the real reason people go to Violet Hour: Drinks. The Hummingbird is amazing, Juliet & Romeo is delicious.

The servers also give great recommendations if you are unsure what to select due to the large selection. Be forewarned that the drinks tend to be very strong. Also expect to pay a premium as well, most drinks average between $10-$12.   I like to reserve Violet Hour for special occasions such as a date or outings with close friends.

2010-12-18,5.0,"A few months ago, one of my best friends told me about this nondescript place with the most amazing cocktails. Now for a beer-drinker, it took a while to put the cocktail-venue on my to-go list.  Last night, looking for a chill evening, drove to a couple of restobars but with no parking to be found, headed out to Wicker Park's famous Violet Hour adventure.  We drove past the block twice not being able to find the place. Here's where the adventure starts. Third time we're inching across trying hard to find this place and suddenly the wall opens up into a door and two girls walk in. We've located the secret entrance!  We park and walk in, into a secret corridor, with the mystery enhanced because no one in line has a clue what treasures the 15ft drapes hold behind. No host, no hostess. No signs, no directions.  After waiting for about 40 minutes, the drapes open, asking for a set of 2 and the people in front of us walk through. In the meantime, these 3 girls walk in as if they own the place, walk right through the drapes as if they belong, and when the host comes out, he assumes they're next in line. So we wait another 10 minutes. Host comes back out saying the bartender will let two people stand by the bar and my friend and I chose this option not wanting to wait any longer.  Walking in, the place has a unique charm to it - chandeliers, tall-backed chairs, lamps on the table, enjoyable music but at volumes where conversations can flow easily, well-stocked bar. We ended up spending 2hs at the bar and their drinks were indeed very good.  Supposed to replicate a speakeasy from the prohibition days, Violet Hour was a gem of a find and certainly a place top of my list to revisit!",0.9662,0.812,0.123,0.065,0.5281523809523809
2010-12-17,5.0,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THE VIOLET HOUR.  With that said, I have to say to my fellow Yelpers, DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT, visit this establishment.  It's only due to the fact that I am absolutely selfish and want the vibe of this place all of my self.  The sumptuous decor, the delectable drinks and the decadent, but oh so tasty menu items, how could anyone not love the Violet Hour?? First of all, the fact that is hidden by a large wooden facade is intriguing enough to be attracted to it.  As you walk towards the industrial size door and open, you are faced with plain old dry wall.  Still intrigued...just walk a few more feet, where right in front of you is a blue velvet curtain.  Once pulled back, you are taken to a place where sensuality and playfulness walk hand in hand and enjoy a cocktail or two...or three...You have just entered a modern speakeasy (I am convinced I was once a flapper in my past life). Your are surrounded by gorgeous hardwood floors, blue leather high-backed chairs, chandeliers, white tables with a ""crown-molding"" like look, a fireplace and did I mention blue velvet curtains!!!  The second I walked into the Violet Hour I knew I didn't want to leave.  The seating and layout is set up for intimate conversations; the music played throughout the lounge is hip enough that you can groove to but not so loud that you have to strain to hear your companion's every word. The vibe is close and sexy, I would recommend the Violet Hour for an intimate rendezvous with your sweetheart.  The dim lighting and fireplace will add a little extra romance to your evening out. The decor made me stay but the cocktails made me want to move right in.  The first time I visited the Violet Hour, I was mystified by the unique cocktails the mixologists were concocting.  A gin cocktail by the name of ""Juliet & Romeo"" and a rum cocktail by the name of ""Stewed, Screwed & Tattooed""; the names alone make you want to drink them.  But the mixologists are extremely knowledgable and experts in the art of cocktails.  The cocktails at the Violet Hour were oh so tasty; they put non-alcoholic drinks to absolute shame.  Which is why I was hesitant to visit the Violet Hour during my pregnancy; I didn't think a virgin alternative to the extensive menu would be available to me.  But I was wrong, the mixologists were so eager to experiment with the cocktails on the menu to make them mocktails for me.  That level of impeccable service was suberb and I definitely cannot wait to revisit the Violet Hour when I can have cocktails again. Not only were the cocktails and mocktails heavenly, the food was to die for.  Now the menu changes periodically, but the unique take on classic comfort foods gives this establishment it's hint of playfulness.  My last visit to Violet Hour, had me munching on a tasty version of deviled eggs, tater tots and a mini Chicago hot dog.  The items were delicious and sated me and my belly bump.  I cannot wait to try the new and adventurous takes on comfort food the Violet Hour chefs will be preparing. The overall service by the wait staff couldn't have been better.  The staff is friendly, courteous and willing to assist patrons with drinking and dining recommendations.  As I read my review, I have had a sudden change of heart...During the season of giving and because I want to remain on the ""NICE"" list, I encourage the entire Yelp community to visit the Violet Hour.  You will not be disappointed.  But please, visit in moderation, I still would like to have my wait to be seated at the Violet Hour at a minimum.",0.9984,0.763,0.185,0.052,0.5250516150516149

2010-12-05,4.0,"What can I say about this place that hasn't been said before?  I visited back in August 2009 and was pleasantly surprised. I had become enlightened to the trend of 'speakeasys' and had visited a few on my frequent trips to NYC. Living in Chicago, I wanted to get entangled in the speakeasy culture that drew comparison to the Prohib-era of the roaring 20's, Capone, etc.  I had been to the Green Mill (as most late-night Chicagoans have) and soaked up the jazz and flapper-style service you'd expect at a prohib-throwback, but the Violet Hour pays homage to the underground scene rather than the above floor burlesque-ing.  We didn't wait long, by the light on the side of the wall and passed the time chatting it up with a few others who were out of town or new to the speakeasy experience. Moments later a not-so-armed guard opened the side panelling hidden in the wall to let us through to a lobby area separating debauchery with a curtain. In this area we waited another 5 mins or so and were seated at the bar with our Wehman Bros. enlightened bartender and his aptly dressed cohorts.  Our drinks were pretty solid. Not the ""best I ever had (Drake)"" but I always appreciate the mixers that know how to use bitters (and not OVER use) as well as any variants of absinthe.  The only lacking piece is how distant all of the people here seem to be, physically and socially. With booths spread far out from the bar spread from the back rooms, it's more of a place to be ashamed of drinking rather than celebrating it. I'd prefer a speakeasy to translate into ""let's not have a tv on in the background and talk without being distracted by dbags flailing j-bombs"" which Violet Hour more than does, but how easy does one have to speak in this place? Overall: visit, it's trendy, it's legit, it's cool, but next time you visit, try striking up convos with those around you. Don't be bashful!",0.9887,0.86,0.124,0.016,0.43647535260438486

2010-12-03,5.0,"Yes, another glowing review for Violet Hour.  Thursday night, 745pm, no line, three of us were seated at the bar right away.  I had no clue what drink to order, since almost all of them feature words that I did not understand (like matsusalem or St. Elizabeth Allspice Dram).    The bartender gave me a taste of a rum I was asking about, and then helped me choose a delicious drink- Walsh's Rule. Y-u-m.  I recommend it for people who like tasty, not too too sweet drinks.  Before I even took my first sip of the deliciousness, I decided that I loved the place.  I loved everything about it... though if I had had to wait, I might not feel so warm and fuzzy.   Like others have said, it costs $12 for each of these incredible drinks, so I can't afford to come too often, but WOW, for my first experience with craft cocktails, I was so impressed.  Don't go to meet people.  Go to have great conversation and feel a million miles from your busy Chicago life.   One added bonus that saved me like $115: I was running late and parked in the 7-11/Lou Malnati's lot right next to Violet Hour.  I looked around for lingering tow-company people watching to bust bar-goers like me and didn't see anyone.  This friendly-looking guy near the door (I never would've guessed he was the towing informant!) said, ""Miss, I saw you leave your car in the lot, and I am the guy who has to call the company, and I wanted to let you move your car.""  I was amazed, and found a spot a block away.  Thank you, friendly towing informant!!!!  I will pay it forward :) May you have the great time that I did at this fine establishment!",0.9967,0.737,0.228,0.035,0.6327664399092972

2010-12-01,5.0,"Sad to say, I used to live near this Wicker Park gem for over a year and a half and never tried it. I always heard about how cool the place was, but the line outside the graffiti laced walls a little ways south of the Damen Blue Line stop never appealed to me. I am a guy that refuses to wait in lines. I found out about an event for the Michelin Food guide that was taking place here so I immediately RSVP'd. The line was not too bad and it moved quite fast. I enjoyed myself with friends old and new and enjoyed the swanky scenery and great drinks. I enjoyed it so much that I thought it would be a good idea to come back on a regular night. Me & my entourage showed up on a Saturday night around 8:30. The line outside was not too bad, but this time it did not move so fast. We stood outside for about 20 minutes and once we made it inside we were stopped right at the door with another line on the inside. We stood there for about 15-20 mins. We got lucky because they had room for three @ the bar. We wanted to get one of the cool, funny style seats/booths, but we were happy that we were able to get a seat and drink at that point.  While we were being seated we were told no talking on the phone, but it was ok to text and tweet. All of their drinks were great and the bartenders were very attentive...they made sure we got a nice buzz.  Dimly lit place and has a sexy vibe to it.

2010-11-13,5.0,"The Violet Hour is hands down my favorite cocktail bar I have ever been to. As far as price goes I, unlike others, think that it is an excellent deal. You are getting a drink made with freshly squeezed juices, hand carved ice, homemade bitters, generous pours, and the assurance that if you don't like it they will gladly make you a different beverage. To me, that is worth the 3 or 4 dollar premium over a appletini any day. I have gone roughly 10 times and the service has always been excellent and the wait staff nearly always know when I need another drink. Personally, this isn't the type of place I would want to come to when it is packed just because I enjoy taking it easy and enjoying a long conversation. So if you are like me, don't go on a Friday or Saturday night.  Couple words of advice. This is a place to talk amongst friends, not get wasted and party. Go with a group of friends and order different things so you can try a bunch. For me it is experiment for the first round and indulge in the second :). I have been disappointed with the famous Juliet and Romeo the last few times I have had it. A couple years ago it was from heaven, now I think it is average.

2010-11-01,5.0,"To preface this review, I must say that I am a bit pretentious myself, perhaps lending to my insatiable need to frequent The Violet Hour as much as possible.  That being said, I'm going to write this review as sort of a point-counterpoint to all the 1-star reviews I've been reading (and laughing at).  Playing the role of Point are the mongoloids that cannot discern the difference between mixology and oenology (and probably can't pronounce the latter), and playing the role of Counterpoint are my words, the reasons why I love this place so much. Point:  OMG, so, lyk, I tried to order a RedBull and Burnett's Cherry Vodka (my fav, totes!), and they got all snobbish and shyt.  What doz this place think it is?  Trump Tower?  OMG! Counterpoint:  You must be one of those people that goes to a restaurant and tries to order something that's not even closely related to a menu item.  The point of going to The Violet Hour is to try the drinks off the menu.  You can order a Red Bull - Vodka anywhere; however, try ordering an Oldest Living Confederate Widow at any other bar in the city.  If you really MUST have a vodka soda, keep reading the menu -- they offer a wide variety of specific spirits that the bartender will whip up for you with a mixer (one they have, obviously).  Sure, they don't have Grey Goose, but if you think Grey Goose is the best vodka ever made, go back to Manor, and stay there.  Please. Point:  So we r 15 hot gurlzzzzzzz and we got in line at like 11 on Friday nite and ther was a looooong ass line and the bouncer wouldn't even except a blowjob as a way of getting us in!  Terrible service like whoa. Counterpoint: Go earlier.  If you want to make a night out of The Violet Hour, you've really only got two options.  Go early and chill there for a while, drink some drinks, soak in the ambience, and chat your night away.  Option two?  Stand in line.  Don't like going to places early?  It's not my problem, nor should it be TVH's problem.  Maybe it's based upon my preference to arrive early and on weekdays (preferring to spend my weekends at house parties and the like, things that aren't available on a Wednesday evening at 8 pm).  Maybe I like to use my brain too much.  I don't know.  In regards to service, every server I've had there has been witty, not pushy, and incredibly knowledgeable about the drinks and mixology in general.  Call it luck of the draw, but I calls 'em like I sees 'em. Point:  There rulez on the wall r soo dumb.   Counterpoint:  Do you walk into a mosque drinking a beer with your shoes on?  No.  Do you go to your mother's house and piss on the floor?  I'd hope not.  You go somewhere - they have rules - respect the rules.  I might think it's dumb that my mother won't let me piss on her floor, but I'll respect that because I'm a guest at her establishment.  Perhaps working in a restaurant has sullied my opinion on being a ""guest,"" or perhaps I'm just respectful.  Either way, baseball caps at the bar are for douchebags and actual baseball players.  And perhaps hip-hop artists.  TVH's rules add a bit of classiness to a part of town that's being taken over by the nouveau college grads that still frat it up on the weekend, slaying ho's and whatnot. Point:  Y is it so dark?  And Y are the drinks sooo xpensiv?! Counterpoint:  Eat more carrots, and live within your means, respectively.  The ambience is classic and refined (refer to my earlier counterpoint on classiness at TVH), and their prices reflect the effort that not only goes into engineering the cocktails, but also the ambience.  It's not cheap to carry as many obscure liquors as they do, and to cut down on the number of original cocktails or the number of ingredients would do an injustice to the world of finely crafted cocktails and the overall theme of TVH.  I don't eat at Alinea because I can't afford it.  If you don't like 12 dollar cocktails that take time and effort to make, then go to whatever dive-y crap you prefer and enjoy your dollar beers, poser.  Spend money on your passions.  Some people's passion happens to be mixology.   --- Overall, if you're into a dimly lit, classy atmosphere centered around an experience that's best experienced at a slow pace (a pace that many people in America seem to have forgotten), then visit TVH.  You won't be let down.  I love it, and I've turned many people onto it in the times I've gone.  I will return until they stock Grey Goose behind the bar.  At that point, I will have lost all hope for humanity.",0.9971,0.814,0.134,0.053,0.45956284153005467

2010-10-27,5.0,"I've always been impartial to writing reviews.  I read a lot of them, but never found a reason to write and post my reviews.  My trip to Chicago (and especially my visit to Violet Hour) changed that.  Because of an amazing barman named Steven (Stephen?), I've decided to finally join Yelp and begin my long list of reviews. This was my first time in Chicago and I was visiting with a close friend, so I'd done all of the proper research thru yelp reviews and other sources to make sure we got the most out of our Labor Day weekend trip.  I jam packed our schedule with lots of touristy stuff, amazing food, and finally the infamous Violet Hour (infamous mainly for its long wait-time).  Prior to coming here, I was convinced this was like any other speakeasy I'd been to in NY.  There was nothing I was unprepared for after the ridiculous waits and selective treatment of the NY speakeasies.   It was a comparatively warm night, but as usual, I felt underdressed.  The wait outside was not too bad (from what I remember about 20-30 minutes until we moved into the vestibule area for another 30-40 minute wait), but the cold made it a bit worse.  The two guys in front of us actually were from out of town as well, and claimed that this place kept them coming back.  I was a bit skeptical at first, but now I know why. We opted for two available seats at the bar, not knowing how much longer a party of two would have to wait to be seated with the more private high-chairs.  I started off with the Pimms Cup since I am quite a fan of Pimm's.  It was well made, with a clean finish, but it wasn't exactly what I was in the mood for at the moment, so I opted for a different drink but didn't know what to get.  So I asked our kind barman for a suggestion.  He suggested The Riviera, which has egg whites, making the drink a bit frothy, but better tasting.  I'd never had a drink with egg whites, and after my trip to Chicago, I'm convinced it's a Chicago thing, because everyone in NY thinks I'm insane.  After that drink, I explained to the barman that I have a thing for strawberries, and that I'd like a drink with egg whites and strawberries, and he made me a drink which was really great (I don't remember the name or even if it had one, but I loved it). He also gave me a side cup full of strawberries to go along with my drink, which really made my night.  I was getting steadily colder by the minute in part thanks to the hand chipped ice blocks in each of my drinks.  What a night this would be! My friend was nearing his comfortable limit, so I had to get one last drink in before we could go.  ""Do you have 151, by any chance?""  I asked Steven.  Lo and behold, they had something MUCH better than Bacardi, and JUST AS STRONG.  ""El Dorado"" was the name, I believe.  The label read, El Dorado, High Strength Rum.  Apparently, nobody had asked for anything that strong in the last THREE YEARS.  So we were going down in history here!  In fact, everyone behind the bar was so impressed, we got the shots on the house!!  Yes, the crazy small Asian chick from New York and her friend who asked for 151 shots. Upon hearing that I was from NY, Steven told us he had a few friends bar tending at some of our local speakeasies.  But Steve, my dear, I can assure you, your drinks were MUCH better than the ones I've had at PDT.  I've been told I can be a VERY picky drink connoisseur, but coming from NY and having hit up a wide variety of speakeasies, I was STILL Impressed by the amount of attention and care given to each drink (and the barman's ability to actually mix me something I honestly enjoyed).  I'm planning to go back to Chicago in the near future JUST to hit up Violet Hour.  Thanks again, Steve!",0.9993,0.773,0.203,0.025,0.49843647745056197

I gave the hostess my phone number and she told me about the call twice thing, so I just waited outside the door with my boyfriend for about 20 minutes.  They called once, and fishing around in my purse for my phone I didn't get it in time, so I just went straight inside, phone in hand waiting for call #2. From the time it took me to walk from the outer door to walk up to the curtain they had given my table away. ""But,"" I explained, ""you said you would call twice and you only called once, and I'm here!"" I even showed them the call log on my phone. Nope, doesn't matter, not getting in, go to the back of the hour long line.  I tried to explain again that I had just been waiting right outside the door, and came in as soon as they called. That's when they called over a large bouncer guy to get in my face and repeat ""this is not a negotiation"" while he physically intimidated me out in to the hallway. I'm not a petite lady, but I really REALLY don't appreciate someone needing to escalate it to threatening to physically remove me, especially when I'm a person who is painfully quiet and polite when resolving a customer service problem.  It is to my chagrin that after about a minute of that kind of public humiliation I could feel tears welling up in my eyes, so I just threw up my hands and decided that I guess I'm just not wanted here. I don't know if you can indignantly slam a velvet curtain, but I sure as hell tried. I'm still flabbergasted that anyone there felt that kind of treatment was necessary.

We sat in the first room, which consisted of low lighting, high-backed chairs (think of royalty), and small, rectangular wooden tables with candles. Light music played in the background. It was just a very COOL place to hang out. I had a Pimms' Cup bitter, which was tanqueray, mint, blackberry, and orange. SO GOOD. We each had a drink but stayed for at least an hour. The atmosphere is so calming, so cool, it was hard to leave. Drinks are also pretty reasonable for a bar of this caliber - $12 each for cocktails.

Ever since then, this has been our destination for cocktails. What a wonderful place. Admittedly, getting into the Violet Hour can require the patience of a saint - since they no longer take phone numbers (sad face), standing outside and waiting in a big line is pretty much part of the experience, unless you go early on a weeknight. That aside, though, it's definitely worth it.  They've just updated their menu, and have some wonderful cocktails (I recommend the Moscow Mule and the Jimmy Roosevelt). The service is always fantastic, but if you can, I highly recommend that you sit at the bar - the bartenders are friendly, knowledgeable, and usually have some absolutely exceptional recommendations (it is as a result of this place and their wonderful staff that I now have an undying love for Pisco).

The interior is just amazing in terms of decor and lighting. The lighting is very dim and relaxing and so are the chairs. There is a lot of privacy because of the high backed chairs and placement of chairs. It is a great place to go at the end of the week when you want to relax. All their cocktails are $12 and they are very creative. They also list their cocktails by main alcohol like Rum, Whiskey, etc, so you can actually taste different cocktails without mixing! I have tried many different cocktails there and they are all equally delicious. The most important thing to try there is their food. It is very very very good. My favorites are the tots, which are amazing and most recently, their doughnuts! The doughnuts arrive warm and have a cinnamon coating, they taste like churros and very very yummy. I have ordered lots of other food and you can never go wrong with any of their menu items. They are small plates though, and just niblets, not dinner portions.

2010-08-21,4.0,"Violet Hour is your sheik, find me if you can, swanky, everything from scratch, wait your a** off in an, at times, imaginary line bar. Perhaps I should have thrown in a few more adjectives up there.  People were certainly in all levels of attire but pants and a shirt feels more appropriate than jeans and a Smurf T-shirt.  In my view Violet Hour will have you waiting on a list for at least an hour regardless of they have tables or not.  I'm not mad at it because it's a good psychological approach to building demand and desire.  What is important is that they'll let anyone in waiting so you don't have to feel cool enough or rejected.  The staff once inside is also quite friendly and not at all stuffy like you might expect. Once inside it's really a cool décor and set up.  The high backed chairs give you the feel that each tiny table is its own private booth.  These guys make every syrup, garnish, and otherwise that goes into a drink aside from the base alcohol.  This kind of preparation has to be respected because it's time consuming.  It is also art work.  The drinks are tasty and certainly something to experience.  I only had their hummus appetizer but it was very good.  The hummus had a very nice texture with just a hint of garlic which gained strength has I took bite after bite. The bathrooms are really nice in that they are completely separate; meaning that there is one door per private bathroom.  I suppose if you want a little boom boom time you could get away with it in private.  You'll probably be to buzzed to care if your caught anyway but the place does have an energy that will have you thinking what I'm saying. All-in-all if you're out for something very different and really cool this is a great place.  Good for dates or to show off Chicago to an out of town friend you can go wrong.  Just don't come if you're looking for a quick drink; you will be waiting in line for some time no matter when you go....it's what they do!

2010-08-21,5.0,"Key to this place: DON'T wait in line. We left our number at the door and headed across the street to Big Star for some delish tacos. We got a call (two actually), which we missed because the phone was in my boyfriend's loose pant pocket. Still, when we showed up at the door, despite our name being crossed off we were let right in and seated at the bar.  When you walk in you are immediately hit by the simple elegance of the place. Large, heavy velvet curtains separate the street from the bar, then the bar itself into three rooms. There are tables scattered about, and booths along the walls. The bar seats had big, cushy comfy bar stools.  And the bars were made of marble. Shortly upon sitting down one bartender (a term that does not quite match what the people behind the bar do here. Perhaps drink technician? Cocktail connoisseur? What would be the cocktail version of a sommelier?) poured us a couple glasses of water from chilled water bottles. We were given menus by a woman who was to be our drink technician. She gave us a minute to peruse then asked if we had questions. We asked for her advice, to which she questioned us about which particular spirit we were interested in. She was honest and straightforward about her opinion. For example, I was interested in something dry and not too sweet so asked about the bubbly drinks. She named one of them as being dry, but she said she thought it was boring. It was not elitist or condescending in any way. I felt that she was being honest, which is what I wanted--I did ask for her opinion after all. I also felt that if I did choose to order the ""boring"" drink I wouldn't have felt stupid or in any way lame for having done so. (I did not order that drink, rather another one that she recommended, to which she added extra tequila on top when she saw my excitement about the tequila I had no idea was in the drink in the first place.)  My boyfriend and I both had a couple drinks (ALL were excellent, made with good, and plentiful booze, and tasted yummy). She checked up on us occasionally (not in a pushy way), which was totally appreciated.  The reason she was able to do so was because they do not pack people into this place. It's just low-key and a good environment in which to sit, enjoy the company of others, and have amazing cocktails. There was no one standing around, and no one waiting for drinks. Everyone was taken care of at all times by the many servers/drink technicians, and the pace never seemed hurried or rushed. Me likey.  There were a couple more small touches which added to the elegance of this place. The ice. They say on the menu that all the water is twice-filtered to provide the purest ice for the drinks. They also have ice that has been made into big chunks to fit the specific glass for the specific cocktail. Let me clarify. For an old fashioned, which is a whiskey drink served in a short glass, they use one large round ball of ice (really like what you're SUPPOSED to get at a really nice place when you order a scotch on the ""rocks""). The dark and stormy came in a tall, skinny glass. For this they use one tall cylindrical piece of ice.  This is just the ideal and most logical way to serve a drink. The one large block of ice means the ice is not melting as quickly (less surface area) and watering down your drink.  (When you get a glass filled with small ice cubes those cubes melt pretty damn quick, especially if you're stirring your drink after each sip, as some tend to do.)   The bathrooms. The classy, simple, elegance carries over into the bathrooms, all co-ed single user rooms.  There was more marble in the bathroom, and it was clean.   ""The lab."" Behind the bar sits what I shall refer to as ""the lab."" It is a space filled with books (presumably about drinking, cocktails, maybe about spices, who knows). There are a ton of brown vials filled with who knows what amazing tinctures get added to drinks. There's a cabinet with even more bottles and ""tools"". Having a science background it looked like the creative breeding place for the delightful concoctions they create. I loved it! You pay $12 for a cocktail, but that is not so out of the ordinary in a city these days, and you get a lot included in that $12 (no tax). You get what I would consider pretty personalized and amendable service. You get engineered ice. You get good booze (not bottom shelf stuff here). You are not shafted on the quantity (or quality) of the booze. You get all fresh, nothing pre-mixed in your drink. You get a relaxed environment in which to conversate without feeling rushed, or rubbed up on by people trying to get to the bar to order a drink.  For being treated well and feeling like a million bucks, you might even have underpaid for your drink.   A note on pretension. It's not. I went in with a semi-nice shirt, jean shorts and flip flops. I never once felt looked down upon or that I shouldn't be there.

Were it not pouring buckets, the wait to get in the door and then to actually get in, may not have been as discontenting. However, I'll say that I think the wait was mostly worth it. I really dig the ambiance of the place.  It most certainly is a perfect date place. The lighting is right, the seating and level of intimacy in its setup is also just right. It's very conducive to you getting caught up in your own world, like it's just you and your companion(s), whether one other person or a group of people. The drink selection is pretty interesting (egg whites? really?). I ordered the El Diablo because it had ginger in it, and while I wasn't head over heels about it, it was good. The large block (not cubes) of ice in the drink was an interesting touch also. The bartender was really courteous and attentive also. $12 a drink is more in line with prices I'm used to (and hate) in NYC, but it's not the drink-a-lot-get-sloppy-and-sloshed kind of place anyway. Not to mention, that one drink did me in pretty well, so i certainly didn't need another. I'd come back again, for sure.

It is a very secretive.  It has no sign, and at first, I was not sure I actually found it.  When I pushed the door on Damen Avenue and it opened, I felt like saying ""Phew"".  Violet Hour reminds me of Bourbon and Branch in San Francisco.  But unlike Bourbon and Branch, you do not need a reservation and the bar is very large with plenty of bar seats and tables.  Basically, it has everything I like about the SF mixology bars with more space and intimacy. I'm all for it.  The drinks are excellent.  I particularly enjoyed their Juliet and Romeo cocktail, a cucumber, rose water, and mint gin cocktail.  My mother and I sat at the bar and ran down the entire menu with the bartender before ordering.  He was extremely patient and kind to us and guided us through the menu.  He also went out of his way to make me a mezcal drink later on  that was not on the menu.   All drinks were well balanced, and not the least bit too sweet.  They echoed the simplicity of the beverages that characterized early mixology. My mom and I even learned how this industry had changed over the years, and how The Violet Hour was bringing back cocktails that were made with freshly squeezed ingredients.

A friend and I went on Wednesday at 6:15 PM, just after opening.  The cool, dark interior was a perfect respite from the summer heat.  The place was still pretty empty at that point, with no line, and we had our pick of seats.  The high-backed chairs that everyone's already written about looked wonderfully comfortable and inviting.  We noticed that the bar was entirely empty, though, and couldn't resist grabbing two seats there. As we looked over the drink list, Henry (our bartender) wandered over to ask if we had any questions.  He was both extremely knowledgeable and very patient.  When I asked him about a type of vermouth I hadn't previously tried, he gave me a brief description, then walked away and returned with a small sample.  ""A taste'll give you more information than I can provide.""  Awesome.  His low-key but very professional demeanor fit in perfectly with the overall vibe of the place.  It was a nice change from some of the flashier cocktail bartenders I've encountered. The drinks themselves were remarkable.  I started off with a Hibiscus Old Fashioned while my friend had the Dark and Stormy.  Both were just beautiful.  For the second round, I tried the Blue Ridge Manhattan.  I love Manhattans and I love Laphroaig, but I was worried the Laphroaig would overpower the rest of the drink.  No worries, though.  The mix was perfect.  My friend asked for something a bit lighter and fizzier, and Henry came through with a variant on the Singapore Sling he called the Six Corners Sling.  Just what my friend wanted. I know recent reviews have been a bit up-and-down.  We had an amazing time, with terrific drinks and wonderful service.  We were there early on a weeknight, though, when the staff was pretty relaxed.  I'm not sure whether I'd have the same impressions on a Friday or Saturday night.  I suppose I'll have to try it again at a busier time.  Until then, though, definitely five stars.",0.9974,0.712,0.232,0.056,0.5995899470899472

Waiters/waitresses brought around a sampling of their food (the chili hot dogs want to be like Skyline SO BAD but they just don't come close).  We had a sampling of their signature drinks (the whiskey one was fantastic!).  Since I imagine they were getting paid a pretty penny and we were there for the ""party"", they didn't enforce the cell phone rule (it IS a computer company, after all) and let guests in even if they weren't up to the dress code. The little booths and heavy curtains were very enchanting and I liked the innocent yet dark motif they had going on.  However, after about an hour, we were all bored.  I don't know, it just wasn't as inviting and the staff acted like they were doing you a favor instead of getting paid for serving.  I'd go back, but only if someone else is paying.",0.9237,0.777,0.142,0.082,0.6838541666666667

2010-07-12,2.0,"There's a fine line between pretentious and sophisticated, and Violet Hour is on the wrong side of it. I went with a friend on a Wednesday night and signed in around 10. We were told it would be about an hour, so we went across the street to Big Star. To our surprise, we got a call in about 20 minutes, so we chugged our salsa beer and rushed across the street to the cool mysterious door. When we got there, two women who came in after us were seated, leaving us seatless. We inquired as to why we got shafted after rushing to pay our bill and dashing across the street. Apparently the girls knew someone important. Apparently that makes me trash. The hostess was as apologetic as could be and even offered free champagne, so I decided to be calm and stay. The champagne was terrible, but, again, no big deal. I've heard a ton about this place and wanted to give the experience a fair chance. The interior is beautiful, and is a great romantic date location. The private type booths and high backed chairs are unique and gorgeous. The drinks, however, leave quite a bit to be desired, especially at this price point. After one drink each, we were ready to head out. I don't even remember what the music was like, but I do remember wanting to fall asleep while I was there. I won't be going back to Violet Hour.

I heard many rave reviews prior to first going - and when I arrived, I realized that it is a little too pretentious for my taste. I am not a huge fan of waiting and big crowds to get into places, and for the idea behind this bar, I think it would be so much more intimate and Violet-Hour-esque if they did not cram a bunch of those tall individual booths in the middle of the floor.  It seems rather crammed. It takes FOREVER to get drinks here - every time I've come (3 times now), but I guess I've ended up saving money in the long run, because I can't get the attention of our server to get another drink.  This is not to bash on the serving staff - they seem friendly and knowledgeable enough - but each time I've come - it looks like one girl takes the whole floor SOLO.  So naturally she is forced to run around like crazy and not devote the necessary attention to each table.  I was expected an intimate experience with a very attentive server from the theme this bar promotes.  Have not yet gotten any of that. The drinks are tasty - and there is quite a selection - but it's just not worth it to me, unless there's some secret day where no one is there and I can go and get all the attention in the world.",-0.1318,0.876,0.055,0.069,0.4858974358974359

It was delicious, but I have to say, just a fancied up Margarita.  I also tried the Dark and Stormy, which I think was my favorite.  The drinks with egg-whites in them are also pretty special...they are frothy and delicious, and hey, extra protein:) Another gripe, or two....our poor dates had to sit on ottomans....what is that about?!  That sucks, buy some more high-chairs please, those are cool.

WE were the kind of people they wanted there, not to worry. Well, Well! With that formality out of the way, we meandered through the rich curtains where we met up with a super-friendly hostess who single-handedly set up and intimate table for two by arranging some hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh-backed chairs (almost to the ceiling!) around a low table. Dim candlelight and heavy leather bound drink menus rounded out the feeling that I was SOMEWHERE. It also made me feel utterly terrified of the green I was about to throw down for a drink. I didn't care, I felt like I was officially an extra in Gossip Girl.  Unsurprisingly, the menu was chock full of decadent sounding drinks of all varieties.

2010-06-01,2.0,"It is quite interesting that I can have such a dramatic difference in experiences at a bar, when only a week has elapsed. I suppose it is fitting, though, as the Violet Hour is one of the more visually dramatic and sophisticated establishments I've ever visited.  Too bad they can't consistently guarantee the same of their customers.  Before I begin, I should preface this by stating that I am not pretentious (at least not to most people's faces), nor am I opposed to bending the limits of attire guidelines for entrance into a bar. But when it comes to a place which is clearly attempting to set a standard regarding overall atmosphere? Either uphold said created standard, or completely let them fall by the wayside. I understand the variables likely involved in the lowering of Violet Hour's standards...but ironically, their price points and the ""aristocratic"" demeanor of the employees aren't directly correlated with that dropped bar.  Having said that?  I knew that I would fall in love with Violet Hour from the moment I followed its construction. When I finally had a chance to visit (and I have been many times), I was instantaneously impressed with its opulent appearance. Overly-tall chairs which unabashedly elevated toward the ceiling, lush velvet curtains dividing sections and adorning corners, shades of royal blue, gold and cream...it was as if I was transported to a chamber in the Palace of Versailles.  The bartenders consistently mix superb cocktails, there is quite an impressive wine list, and the food choices, while limited, match almost perfectly with the beverages. Which isn't called food, mind you--it's Sustenance.  Overall, the entire staff at Violet Hour ""get it."" They understand the environment they have created, and ensure that their clientele are well-appointed with their chosen menu items. I never waited for a refill of anything, I never had too many empty plates competing for real estate on my table, I never wished for a single thing.  Which is precisely how it should be. The main reason why I loved Violet Hour because everything was precisely how it should be. It is rare to find an establishment where the unison between initial goals and final results is almost perfected. Violet Hour was almost perfected.  And then the sliding standards come in. I won't belabor this point, as doing so is borderline crass. I'll leave it at this--visit Violet Hour's website. Then take a drive by their location on a Friday or Saturday night. Observe the people waiting outside. While I understand that they cannot cater to just the well-heeled? They can certainly limit the number of crusty-heels entering their doors.  Upon my last visit (a Friday night), I overheard a couple being told that they were not allowed to use their cell phones inside the seating area. Which is a fine request, one I wish more places would make. Unfortunately, however, I cannot abide by a doorman who would issue such an edict, but would then grant entrance to two women wearing ragged denim skirts with holes, beach flip flops, slightly askew blouses and disheveled hair.  Without even a hint of hesitation.  So my ears cannot be defiled or disturbed, but my eyes can?   I refuse to dismiss Violet Hour on the grounds of it losing its touch, mostly because I have not been able to find a comparable experience in Chicago (though The Baker House in Lake Geneva, albeit honoring a different era of history, gave me a good reason to consider making a weekly trip to WI).  But my last visit to the bar was simply unacceptable. But perspectives can be incredibly subjective...so my suggestion?  Go to Violet Hour on an off-night when there will be less of a wait, and a greater likelihood that the patrons inside are there due to an appreciation of the bar's overall aesthetic...and not because the bar is considered another stop on that evening's intoxication train.",0.9688,0.86,0.09,0.05,0.4979538690476191

The real kicker is that I hadn't been here yet.   I wanted to give Violet Hour three stars.  The secret entrance, dark hallways leading to dark heavy curtains, the pretension of a place where it's too dim to read the menu until after you've ordered some crazy thing you can't figure out what it is... I could go on.  The high backed chairs are silly and Alice in Wonderland-like, yet offer a welcome privacy for your tryst with a secret lover, or maybe just a butterface.  The dimness can help with that one.   All that said, at 6pm, we didn't wait, the staff were all exceedingly friendly, and the drinks were lovely.  My first drink, the Riviera, with pineapple infused gin, lemon, egg white and Campari was odd at first, but then it grew on me.  By the last drop, I would have ordered another.  The second was perfect in its simplicity.  I know it was a $12 simplicity, but I may or may not be able to replicate the Tattooed Seaman at home.  Plus it was fun to order.  I enjoy ordering things with slightly suggestive names.  I'm really a teen boy.  This drink was Sailor Jerry, Demerara sugar syrup, and root beer flavored bitters.  With a giant ice berg in the center.  It was the type of ice ball that would blacken the eye of your worst enemy.  Sipping this drink while listening to many of Tom Waits' lesser known and more ambient works just seemed right, and it's this little scenario that gives Violet Hour that extra star.",0.7684,0.848,0.091,0.061,0.47644897959183674

The Violet Hour serves up the most interesting drink menu I have ever seen.  I made a point to order at least 2 with egg whites in the ingredient list (The Riviera being a hit among the group, frothy and happy looking, served with some leftovers on the side).  I tried a Tequila Old Fashioned as well (not to my liking, but certainly not VH's fault- I should have known it wouldn't be up my alley and was just trying to branch out).  Everyone else seemed to adore their drinks.   We did order some food as well- the Tots were a great compliment to drinking in general, the Hummus was actually a pretty generous serving compared to what I had expected, and the Doughnuts rounded things out nicely. We had at least 4 drinks each, plus the food, and I can't remember exactly how much it cost us, but it was not nearly as much as I thought it would be, and was definitely worth it for a luxe night out - I am so glad I finally made it.  It completely lived up to how much I had hyped it up in my head.

As an example: This past Monday, I had the Spring Sidecar.  ('Spring' is important here--the menu is seasonal, with some cocktails appearing year-round.)  K, so your basic old sidecar is brandy, triple sec, and lemon juice.  This baby was made with a Maison Surrenne cognac (read: OM NOM NOM), house-made orange curacao, orange flower water, Lillet (this strange, sweet orange liqueur + white wine stuff), and lemon juice.  *moaning noise* Other good things:   Swanky, elegant, kinda trippy style.   Feels like you showed up at Alice's tea party, except Alice is grown up and has really expensive tastes. Service is mostly good. I've been 3 times.  The first two times were crowded weekend nights and the service was impressive, especially considering the crowd.  The last time was a Monday evening--8 people were in the place and the service was lame.  Really, really slow. Icky things: The music is horrid.  Late nights it's dark ambient techno stuff that would be fine at certain other places, but just doesn't suit Violet Hour at all.  It's jarring and abrasive.  When I went on a Monday, some kind of godawful country music was BLARING.  I mean, damn.  It was seriously chafing my brain.  The music really does diminish the experience.  This isn't the sort of place that needs loud music to make it feel like something's going on.  It needs music that is lithe and playful hovering in the background. The downside of Violet Hour's gorgeous aesthetic is that it is super pretentious.  Even intimidating. I've never had food that was better than so-so.  The ideas are good, execution hasn't been so good. It's expensive. Standard drink price is $12.  I think it's worth it, but others may not.  Probs a place to save for special occasions. There's a line.  Go early to avoid it.  The reason the line exists is that they only let in as many people as there are seats in the place.  One you've had the Violet Hour experience, you will agree that this is a very good idea.",0.9946,0.794,0.161,0.045,0.5290185657596373

First of all, there is the List.  The hostess was friendly enough, and after explaining the process (no standing, first come first served), kindly put us on it.  After which time, and having had just a mere glimpse of the space, we were relegated to the cube of doom, behind the velvet curtain, where you wait for your name to be called with a pile of other people, with the feeling of desperation mounting every minute.  The cube of doom is located in a mid-point between the outside door and the inside, making it a purgatory of competitiveness and self-hatred.  It's like Heidi Klum says, one minute you are in, and the next minute you are out.   Once inside, we were ushered to our table by the cozy fireplace, where the beautiful young things were basking all around us in the dim glow.  Our server, as pretty as a cover model, was at best...absent.  Over 1 hour and only one cocktail each consumed (45 minutes waiting time, 15 minutes drinking time).  But what cocktails they were - my Winter Sazarac was spiced well and body-warming in all of the right ways. When it was time to pay, I noticed that I had been charged for two separate bills - one for $25 for the drinks, and one for $100...for ???  I marched up to the bar and they corrected the mistake, but still, $100?  Major ooops?  And a sort-of apology, but not much of one. All in all, it's a great place, and the fact that they have food is a definite plus.  But that much pretentiousness is a bit much, and when coupled with terrible service makes me question whether the ""see and be seen"" atmosphere is really worth the humiliation of the cube of doom.   I think the trick might be to nab a seat at the bar, and where you can keep a close eye on your cocktail, as well as on the cash register.",0.9389,0.78,0.126,0.094,0.5675223214285714

We were seated in the back right near the fireplace which was pretty awesome. The drinks are listed according to the alcohol, which I loved. I ordered the Part & Parcel (Tito's, Grapefruit, St. Germain, Grapefruit Bitters) and it was absolutely delicious.  Appetizers: we had the herb tots and the mini dogs...AMAZING.  The mini dogs were especially delicious.  Service: horrible. I understand that it takes awhile to make great cocktails, but 45 minutes? Come on. We wanted to order some apps after the drink order and she didn't return for another 30 minutes. I can totally dig the pretentious vibe, but the service better be damn good.  Bathrooms: were totally filthy.  I went to three different stalls and they all had toilet paper all over the floor.  If this place wants to live up to its reputation it should start taking care of its facilities.

Some with odd ingredients like egg whites, but everything we had was absolutely delicious. The drinks were perfectly mixed and although the price tag was steep it was well worth every dollar. We got the hummus appetizer, pretty bland all around I wouldn't suggest it.  Overall I can't wait to go back to this place.

But, no matter, the cocktails inside are well made.  The bourbon/rye list is small but well chosen, and the manhattan was perfectly balanced between the vermouth and bitters.  I particularly enjoyed the custom massive ice cube with my manhattan - it doesn't melt, keeping the cocktail cold and strong.  The egg cocktail was excellent as well. You will, however, pay for the privilege of those well made drinks.  The prices are as tall as the high backed chairs in the first room.  And speaking of those chairs, they do create privacy, but at the expense of lounging.  I prefer easing back into a club chair when sipping manhattans, not practicing my posture.

On the lighter side of the egg, I opted for the gilded cage as my second, clear-liquor drink and LOVED the frothiness of the egg white and spices sprinkled on top, reminding me of a lighter version of egg nog. I sipped some of a few other drinks, but the only other one that really stayed with me was El Diablo. It's basically a margarita taste, but the best margarita you've EVER HAD. Recommended.  We were hungry, so we tried the food which isn't outrageously priced or terrible, but next time, I'll stick to the drinks. Their mini philly cheese steaks were on bread that was borderline toasted and burned and the hummus plate was standard and boring. The flavor all around the food was lacking and just couldn't compare to what we were getting from the bar.  I like the no cell phone policy and the atmosphere, though I'd stick to smaller groups since it would be hard to get a seat with a larger crowd and also hard to hear, I'd think. The candlelight is both romantic and 'exclusive"". Our server was great, though she did seem to get a bit overwhelmed as the night went on and we waited longer and longer for drinks, checks, etc.  Next time I'm looking for some incredible cocktails that are worth every cent of the price ($12), I'm headed to Violet Hour.",0.9801,0.836,0.123,0.041,0.5007113041996764

I don't recommend coming here with large parties, especially when it's busy.  It will probably take a long time for you to get a seat.  You have to order large carafes of cocktails and they don't  taste as good as cocktails made on an individual basis. Come here in a laid back mood expecting to wait a while for your drinks.  The bartenders are very serious about their cocktails and they take their time making sure they're great.  If you come on the weekend or see a line out the door, expect to wait to get in, maybe a long time.  I don't understand why people complain about waiting two hours to get a seat.  Why would you write a  poor review because the place is popular and you were dumb enough to stand around waiting hours to get in?  This is my favorite bar in the city, but I'd never wait over an hour.  If there's a long wait, go somewhere else, pretty easy. Consider this a fine dining bar.  If you went to Tru or Charlie Trotter's, would you ask for a hot dog with some mac and cheese?  These people are very good at what they do.  They have spent a lot of time learning about liquor and how to mix drinks precisely to great effect.  It's insulting when they've spent all this time constructing a wonderful cocktail list and you ask for a cosmo or a dirty grey goose ""martini"".  If you're not interested in their cocktails, there are plenty of near by bars that will suit your tastes.",0.9677,0.783,0.142,0.075,0.6128657228657232

I'm not sure if it's because I was already two cocktails in but El Diablo was possibly the best Margarita I've ever had.

2010-01-12,4.0,"I have to say that this is one of the more unique places that I've been in Chicago. Modeled after a prohibition-era speakeasy, Violet Hour is marked by a single yellow lightbulb outside of a wooden building and door. I went on a Saturday night around midnight, and there was a good sized line of people waiting inside already to be seated. However, my friends and I were joining a party already there, and the hosts were very accomodating in getting us to the front of the line and seating us in an already crowded booth!  The atmosphere inside Violet Hour is very dark and low key. The music isn't blaring, which is nice, and that seems to keep conversation at a decent level as well. They have seating at the bars and at tables for 2, however my friends and I sat at a larger table in the back. I tried a whiskey concoction, which was alright (not a huge whiskey fan), before we ordered our own vodka batch. There were no menus, and apparently they just serve all their drinks in small or large unmarked glass jugs, designated only by what kind of liquor is in them.  The drinks were great and pretty strong, the atmosphere was awesome, and the hosts and waitresses were very accomodating. However, one of those large jugs is $90! I guess you get what you pay for, but because of that, this place only gets 4 stars. Get some menus so I can tell what I'm paying for!",0.9455,0.884,0.098,0.018,0.5813809523809523

Everything about this place is thoughtful and sensible.  It's well-occupied, but not loud.  I think they control the amount of people inside.  Lighting is dim, but not dark, and the decor is haute, but you don't feel out of place.  The group spaces are wonderful.  You're given adequate privacy, so you can easily carry long conversations without screaming, and the music is tasteful. Their offerings were more impressive than other speakeasies I've been to (in NYC).  A wonderful variety of cocktails.  I love single malts, and I went to town.  Prices are actually reasonable, ranging from $12-18.  Drinks in NYC speakeasies are $2-3 more.

I've been to VH many times and always enjoy the experience.  It is a place which requires attention to the cocktail and the conversation which will ensure with your companions.  Perhaps I love it for the fact that you need to converse/discuss/interact with the people you are there with.  The art of conversation is alive and well at the VH.  But lets face it - they make an absolutely fantastic cocktail.  And the cocktail remains the greatest civilizing force in the world. The room is wonderful, with most of the space being devoted to small, intimate tables with high backed chairs, making sure that your focus remains on your drinking partners, and not the scene around you. It's a place to converse, not to cruise.  The seats at the bar are also terrific, as you can discuss/debate to merits of various drinks and ingredients with the knowledgeable staff. I remain in awe of the Zarzamora - combining both Bourbon and Fernet Branca - absolute genius!  As one of the few Fernet Branca drinkers in Chicago (as far as I can tell) it was a revelation. In short - this is a wonderful place.  It brings people together for conversation and sophisticated drinking.  It is clearly a throwback and not for everyone.  When I introduce friends to this place they are generally in awe, never having realized that this oasis of civility still exists in the modern day.  Go, you will not be sorry (unless Hooters is your idea of a great drinking establishment).",0.9974,0.771,0.222,0.007,0.6248730158730158

We all got different drinks. Four of us were new here, and coming to the Violet Hour on a college budget isn't very affordable. But we decided to celebrate the end of our exams and relax before everyone took off for vacation. This was a pretty good spot to do just that. Here's what we ordered: Zarzamora (ordered by me), Nickle Manhattan, Juliet and Romeo, special house drink requested by a bartender, Tequila Manhattan, and the Special Margarita. Everyone's drinks were really good. My Zarzamora was made with Wild Turkey 101, orange bitters, raspberry, and something else that had a fancy name. It came in a tall glass with an orange peel as garnish and an ice cube as long as my glass! It was absolutely delicious. Everyone else had simple glasses with adorable sidecars.  Every special mixed drink on the menu (and the requested drink) was $12. That's not bad, considering they factor in tax in the drink price already. My friend also ordered the tempura batter Reese's peanut butter cups. They were pretty rich and delicious, but I think I will just stick to tempura veggies. Of course this place is a bit pretentious and gimmicky. They don't want to be seen as ""just another bar,"" and they do a good job of setting themselves apart from the rest. It's all part of the experience, and I appreciate that they really put an effort into making the most complex yet delicious concoctions. You won't see any vodka cranberries here, and that is definitely a good thing! What also impressed me was the decor and the overall atmosphere.

The drinks are handmade and intricately crafted and tasted along the way by the bartender (request a seat at the bar if you can) so the drinks taste excellent every time. These are cocktails you won't be finding anywhere else.  There are 4 or 5 cocktails types, separated by base liquor and an extensive collection of tequila and whiskey I haven't touched yet. I have had maybe 1/2 of the vodka or gin drinks and have liked all of them excepted for maybe one. The drinks might be $12 a piece but they pro bably have twice the alcohol of a $6 well drink at another bar so you're actually getting a great deal.  The Atmosphere: The interior is a darkish blue atmosphere just nice and dark enough to create a good ambiance. The music selection is great enough to be in the background but you do not have to raise your voice to have a conversation. There are no cell phones and no baseball hats allowed so that also greatly helps out the atmosphere. The chairs are tall and comfy like something out of Alice in Wonderland. There are four bathrooms that are same sex so you have been warned ladies.  The Getting In: So apparently the waits here can be bad. The first time I went it was during the week I think so we got in with no problem with seats at the bar. The last time we went we put our names on the list and they called us a little over an hour later to come get our seats. There are plenty of bars in the area so the wait wasn't bad at all.

While your date would not be so impressed about the wait (be smart and dont do Violet Hour date in the middle of a snowy winter), the ambient once you get inside is pretty impressive. Its quiet, its dark, it has a nice fireplace, you can talk, or just watching the bartenders is entertaining.

2009-11-29,5.0,"For about a year or so, every time I have had a great or terrible experience at a restaurant, doctor, or auto body shop, I have said ""I am going to sign up for Yelp so I can review this place and tell everyone how awful/amazing it is!!""  My friends would say ""yeah right, you say that about every place and you've never actually done it.""   Well, I have finally found the place that made me quit procrastinating and do it.  I feel like a bit of a traitor to my beloved San Francisco, writing my first review for an out-of-state bar, but the Violet Hour truly deserves it.   While visiting my mother for Thanksgiving, things had begun to get a bit tense- as things tend to do while visiting one's mother.  Being a bit of a cocktail enthusiast, this bar was pretty much the only thing on my to-do list for the weekend.  We spent the day exploring Wicker Park in the blistering cold, and when Mom got tired, we decided we were ready for a drink.  I had heard great things about all aspects of The Violet Hour, but somehow wasn't prepared for just how gorgeous the interior was.  High ceilings, heavy floor-length velvet curtains, and everything in a stunning shade of dusky violet (with purple being a *very* close second for my favorite color, this earns major points).  The high-backed chairs reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland were enticing, but I always prefer to sit at the bar, chat with the bartender, and watch as my drinks are being made.  Luckily, we got there minutes after they opened, so there was no line or wait and we could sit where we pleased (I noticed maybe 20-30 minutes later the place had become completely packed). Always indecisive, I was a bit overwhelmed by the cocktail menu.  Everything sounded incredible.  I told our bartender, Henry, that while I normally drink the standard whiskey drinks (Manhattans, Old-Fashioned, Sazeracs), I was open to trying something new.  He recommended the Woolworth Manhattan, which was not on the menu- Buffalo Trace, Cynar, Carpano Antica sweet vermouth, angosturra bitters, and house-made bitters.  It was excellent- perfectly in balance, with a subtle hint of root beer flavor.  My mother, who had just been introduced to whiskey by me just two days earlier (and had not been a fan), actually found it quite palatable.  As for Mom, a non-cocktail drinker who I've never seen sip anything other than red wine, I picked out the Juliet and Romeo- Beefeater Gin, mint, cucumber, and rosewater.  I know her taste well, and she was thrilled with the selection, although she found it a tad too sweet- there must have been some simple syrup in there that the drink could have done without.  For my second drink, I wanted to try something totally different, that I wouldn't be able to find back home.  I asked Henry what he thought of Bankers, Beggars and Brides- a concoction of Cynar, whole egg, St. Elizabeth allspice dram and nutmeg.  He said it was uniqe and interesting, kind of a bartenders' favorite.  It sounded like precisely what I was looking for--and I was right.  It was perfect.  The cynar base gave it a pleasing bitterness and the allspice dram, a Jamaican rum distilled from fermented molasses and flavored with clove, cinnamon, and nutmeg, gave it a spicy warmth that made me almost forget about the freezing weather we would soon be venturing back into.  I wanted to text message this drink to my friends back home.  Since Mom had already downed her one cocktail for the night, Henry whipped up a non-alcoholic mixture to keep her occupied consisting of house-made grapefruit bitters and I think some citrus juices, free of charge.  It was delicious!  When the check came, Henry had taken care of one of our cocktails as well.   When it was time to leave, I was devastated.  Sure, San Francisco has Bourbon & Branch, Orbit Room, and Beretta, among many other places to drink fabulous cocktails in style, but never have I been to any other bar that gets EVERYTHING right the way the Violet Hour does.  Lucky for Mom--now I have incentive to visit again.",0.999,0.768,0.187,0.046,0.5874664714370595

He gave her the drink she requested, with muddled berries and some other liquor, after which she proceeded to drink 2 more plain vodka sodas(Thanks man, for being understanding). When I couldn't get my hot toddy, we worked together to make a blood and sand (BTW, Violet Hour, for a cocktail house, this should already be on your menu) but had to have the juicer in the back serve me up some fresh OJ. It was delish. i decided to make my next drink a Harling(I think that's the name) County bourbon drink, which will be my regular when I go back.

Around 8pm we got a call saying a table would be open at 8:30. Another call at 8:25 inviting us to come back. Very nice. That made me happy.  My smile quickly faded when we got there. The doorman immediately informs all of us that YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO USE CELL PHONES INSIDE and you'll be kicked out if you do. Are you joking me? What is this, high school? I thought that was completely absurd, and planned on using my cell phone all I damn well pleased. Then he tells me that if the rest of my party isn't there in ten minutes they won't be admitted. I felt like hitting him square in the mouth. It was my freaking birthday and my friends wouldn't be able to come because they didn't know to show up at exactly 8:30? A couple people arrived a half hour later and called me to let me know that I had to come up front to get them (and I answered my phone, so THERE!). Then they sent a girl back to our table to ""make sure there was room"" for them. Christ, how ridiculously pretentious can you get? Forget this place. I can make Moscow Mules at home and they won't cost me $12 a pop or come with a heaping side of attitude. Anyone who stands outside waiting to get into this place is an idiot.

2009-10-24,3.0,"10:30 on a Monday night and Violet Hour, larger than almost any cocktail destination in NYC, is at capacity.  Chicago obviously knows how to party, but do the folks at VH know how to handle the party?   Crowd control is not good here, not at all.  Sometimes there's a doorman in the velvet-curtained vestibule, but sometimes there's not (I went on Tuesday, too).  There's no clear delineation for forming a line, and they only take your name if you're going to leave and come back when there's a table for you.  The waiting vestibule is divided in two (I imagine to protect themselves from blustery Chicago winters), so if you're in the back part, you're constantly wondering what's going on in the front part, and the whole while people are coming in and sashaying past you even though you are trying to be a polite and gracious person who is waiting her turn like an ADULT!!! It's absolutely maddening, but once you are inside it's very nice, and you are well taken-care of.  Most of the seating is made up of armchairs with 6 foot high backs, which is very clever because it allows them to shift things around and create a semi-private space for any size party.  Also, you feel like you are in a tiny periwinkle blue leather spaceship.  The look is less Prohibition-era speakeasy and more funky-but-understated turn-of-the-century parlor:  high ceilings, hardwood floors, white molding...very pretty.   Now, the drinks...the drinks, I'm sad to say, were hit or miss, but you should take this with a grain of salt because I am really, really, annoyingly particular about my cocktails. Basically anywhere I go that charges $12+ for a cocktail gets compared to Milk & Honey here in NYC so...just keep that in mind.  Overall, I'd say that the menu is well-rounded and well-thought out, but it just didn't all translate in execution.   First, there is something strange about the glassware choices here.  Drinks that you'd expect to be up from reading the ingredients, like the Oldest Living Confederate Widow (Bombay Dry, Lemon, Honey Syrup, Absinthe, Orange Bitters) or the Sarsaparilla Sling (Buffalo Trace, Punt e Mes, Amaro Ciociaro, Sarsaparilla Syrup, Root Beer Bitters) were inexplicably served in a Collins glass over a giant ice cube, and drinks you'd expect to see over ice, like the Negroni, are served up.  Why??  Secondly, the drinks were often underwhelming.  The Autumn Sazerac was terribly one-dimensional, and the Sarsaparilla Sling was too sweet and surprisingly bland given the number of ingredients.  The Negroni was great, though, and probably the biggest hit of the night was the Little Red, a sharp mix of peaty and blended scotch, apricot brandy, and lemon.  Really, really nice. AND when we went off-menu and ordered an Aviation, it was made to perfection.  SO.  There are good and bad things to be said about Violet Hour, but I think in a city where there aren't a ton of classic cocktail havens, it's certainly worth a trip.  While in line, I chatted up the couple behind us, and asked if there were anywhere else in Chicago to go for cocktails.  They looked confused, saying ""well, there are lots of places that make cocktails, but Violet Hour...is different"" which I took to mean ""there are many places that will make you a vodka cranberry, but nowhere else you can go for a Nickel Manhattan.""  Judging by its popularity on every night of the week, I imagine that this is true.",0.9948,0.799,0.139,0.062,0.5216833333333334

At first glance it's a bit gimmicky - manufactured exclusiveness. On second thought, it's pure genius.  For this entrance is more than a door. It's a rabbit hole, the symbolic beginning of the Violet Hour experience, a portal meant to transport you away from the trains overhead and the text walkers below, a proscenium that separates two worlds...one where everything from cocktails to conversations are devoured quickly in Big Gulps and tweets...the other where time slows down, where the music is soft enough for people to talk and more importantly to LISTEN.  Which is the stage and which is the audience? Which world is real and which is the farce? The calm within or the chaos outside? All things best pondered over...  COCKTAILS  A no cosmopolitan rule; I'm already in love. I had a fight with a bottle of Tanqueray nine years ago, and I figured if I was going to give gin another chance this was the place to do it. I go with the Indian Summer, a mix of Plymouth Gin, lime, lavender syrup, and house-made tonic. First sip... Hello hello... light bulbs flash, my eyes open wide...I pause. This is delicious. My first reflex is to drain my glass dry, but I stop. I pause. I savor. I reflect. I smile. And I notice my friends are doing the same.  I end the night having had a wonderful conversation with old friends, expertly prepared cocktails, respectful and unhurried service, my world expanded to the wonders of gin, and perhaps a mandate to slow down and enjoy life more.  I will indeed be back and I suggest you do the same.  5 perfect, gin-soaked stars.",0.989,0.825,0.142,0.033,0.4280934343434343

Never has the quality of the cocktails even come close to that of the 1st visit. I'm forced to conclude they've gone downhill. Each time I've been there, someone in my group has ordered the Juliet & Romeo, a gin drink with rose water and a splash of lime. The first time it was perfect, maybe the best cocktail I've ever had. During later visits it was way too limey, obscuring the taste of everything else. Other drinks were similarly unimpressive and unbalanced after that first visit. Once, after waiting to be served for an HOUR at our table, our cocktails tasted like the dregs left over from other cocktails mixed together-- they were nothing like what we ordered.

Although I already had dinner, I was still craving one...and this place was the perfect place.  I had the seasonal Negroni, it was pleasant. I was told by our knowledgeable bartender/mixologist they had 15 Piscos on hand, therefore he made me the best Pisco sour I have had to date. I am also a huge fan of bitters, so I was impressed by their selection, and the way they were displayed in brown medicine bottles. It added to the whole feel of being in a different era for a minute, perhaps the 1920's, without the smoke of course.

The Kyle Blanks hits a 3 run homer a few batters later to win the game. Can you say fate? Ok, back to Violet Hour. So the rest of the group decides to go home and as we walked by the Violet Hour we spot a celebrity: Juliette Lewis. Me and my rotund friend decide to go check it out since its her favorite bar and all. We were sat in the back bar near Juliette and her entourage. The bartender seemed really knowledgable and took his time making our drinks. I got the Juliet and Romeo(if thats sounds girly, blame Michelle). The drinks were awesome, it's too bad we got there late and near closing time. Coolest bar I have been to so far.",0.9587,0.848,0.112,0.041,0.41064814814814826

If I was in the birthplace of the speakeasy, I knew I should check out Violet Hour based on the numerous yelp recommendations. In some ways it was identical to my favorite speakeasies of NYC, PDT and Death & Co. Extensive and creative cocktail menu? Check. Knowledgeable bar and wait staff? Check. The ways in which it differed from those familiar speakeasies were pretty much all positive. When the waitress asked if we'd been there before and I said it was my first time she started to explain the menu to me and some of the idiosyncrasies of Violet Hour. This would never happen at Death & Co or PDT for 2 main reasons. 1. The awesome drinks and atmosphere come with a healthy side of pretentiousness. 2. Nobody would ever show up there and ask for a PBR. The other main difference was that in spite of it's nondescript exterior, Violet Hour is a pretty large lounge space, which contrasts with the small, dark spaces I'm used to in NYC.

2009-08-13,3.0,"First off, the trick to getting inside is seeing the door handle sticking out of the wall.  And then to not go with a group of 10 - which we managed, but it wasn't exactly comfortable.  I'd recommend going with groups of 6 or less here.   We went on a Wednesday night around 7:45 to meet some friends and there were still some open seats at the bar and tables - when we left at 11, there was a line of 15 people or so outside. I will agree with a previous commenter about the music being loud - it was a strange mix of music that ranged from folksy to middle-eastern and some of it was way too loud. Drinks wise, I was pretty impressed with what I got.  I had the Piscoe Punch (smelled like tequila, tasted nothing like tequila, served in a giant bowl with a giant ice cube, hard to get the last drops!), the Sarsaparillo Slim (whiskey drink with root beer bitters) and the Riviera (lemon infused bombay + egg white + lemon + another ingredient or two).  The Riviera was a nice finishing drink since it was sweeter and light, the Piscoe Punch was a pleasant starter, and the Sarsaparillo Slim was something good in the middle. We tried the sammies which were... a range.  The salmon and veggie sammies were good, but the chicken wrap just got an ""ok"" rating.  The cilantro inside was a nice surprise, but I think the wrap was a bad choice. 10 people, fair amount of boozing and some eating, bill ended up around $350 with tip.  A bit pricey and a bit of a trek for me, but still something I'd come back to once in a while for the different flavors and ambiance.",0.9929,0.784,0.175,0.042,0.5696236559139785

2009-08-04,5.0,"Be prepared for a lengthy, five minute review, but I only do this for places that I really find which is one-of-a-kind. Therefore, I don't lie when I say that this is my favorite bar in all of the Chicagoland and Northwest Indiana areas. There are so many reasons why this is a great place. To me, it has a mix of personal history, unique experiences and great drinks, with a relaxing and fun ambiance. For those who are up for trying out a bar without knowing anything prior to going there, I suggest you stop reading this review (and others), and head over there to experience it yourself. That's how it was for me, and I couldn't have asked for a better time. Just a few quick recommendations before you go: 1.) Get there early. Preferably before 8:00 - 8:30 on the weekend. Otherwise you'll wait 30 min. - 1 hr, 30 min. to get in. They have limited seating, and allow only enough in as they have seats. They do take your cell number and call you when your table is ready.  2.) If you are in a party of 2 - 4, grab a seat at the bar. You'll get a great show by watching the bartenders make drinks, and will have a good time conversing with them. 3.) 2.) If you're someone who frequents places like McGee's, J. Barleycorn's, Hi Tops or any other Wrigleyville bars to find drinks specials, get sideways drunk and stay out 'til 4am every weekend, don't bother coming here. You won't like it. It's not for you. Now, more on why this place is great.  To start it off, Violet Hour is a bit snobbish and selective with their rules for attending their bar. I'm one who is easily annoyed by these types of things, but it's to keep their establishment exclusive while creating a truly distinctive experience.  I like the fact that Violet Hour is a bit difficult to find, since there isn't a name or sign on the building. Yes, it's a tad cliché to have an unmarked establishment, but unlike other clubs and lounges that try this same approach, it does fit in with the whole Violet Hour experience. On the inside, it's dimly lit and quiet, with heavy, purple curtains covering the walls. The furniture is something out of Alice and Wonderland; dark purple thrones with a high back to them.  As I mentioned before, if you grab a seat at the bar, you'll have entertainment to go along with the conversation and drinks. The bartenders look like they stepped out of a Vaudeville or Barbershop Quartet performance, into a time machine and were ready to take your drink orders. Aside from the vests, suspenders and mustaches, they all act a certain way; very mild mannered, polite and gentlemanly. As for the cocktails, the menu has many unique offerings that you'll find both delicious and strange. Their spirit selection is quite limited and precise when it comes to whisky, gin, vodka etc. They tailor each cocktail to a specific spirit, ( i.e., the 'New Carre"", which has Death's Door White Whisky in it). Plus, they have an assortment of fresh fruit and berries and various syrups in small vials with eye droppers that they use to make each drink. If you happen to come across a drink with egg white in it, try it. It's better than you'd think. Speaking of eggs, their bacon-whipped deviled eggs are really tasty and make a nice appetizer for two. One downside to the drinks is that they range from $8 - 12 each. However, you're not paying that much for a Grey Goose and cranberry; you're getting a cocktail that you won't find in 98% of the bars in the Midwest. So I didn't mind paying a little more for each drink. Last, for those who are still reading, this place has personal history for J. and I. This was the first place we met up for drinks before our first date. It was a great choice on her part, and one that I will never forget. So we have some ties to this place just from that. We've been back a few times since then with friends who haven't been there before. They always enjoy it just as much as we did back before our first date.",0.9989,0.79,0.175,0.035,0.4543098330241186

No music blaring and yelling to hear each other. You can actually speak in a normal tone of voice. The drinks are very expensive, so I guess that's why I knocked a star off.

Violet Hour is a place that is intended to make it's visitors feel cool, and that's exactly what they achieve.  For one, they don't have a sign nor do they advertise, so there's already the allure of being an ""insider"" that knows about the place.

However, I can't just give this place five stars.  The drinks were good - I will totally admit that.  However, other places make them better (Weegee's and The Whistler, to name two of my favorites).  Mixologists are a bit difficult to find, but not impossible.  Violet Hour, unfortunately, isn't in a class of it's own.  And though the drinks were tasty, they were totally watered down with ice.  I must have misunderstood the menu and what I was ordering, but both drinks that I had contained ice - 3/4 ice, to be (almost) exact.  For $12, I got a drink full of ice and a bit of booze and my boyfriend got an entirely stiff cocktail.  I don't really get that system of pricing - can't you have different levels?  Or, why even serve any cocktails on the rocks at all?  Mix it in that martini shaker with some ice and I'll be golden.  I just can't really justify paying $12 for a hand-crafted cocktail here when I can get the same thing at the Whistler for $8 or Weegee's for $6 (they are literally just as well-made and delicious).   Sigh.  As cool as this place really was, I just don't know if I'll ever come back.  Also, can we get some consistency with this quote?  Some say it's a Bernard DeVoto quote, others T.S. Eliot.  Though I've never read ""The Hour"" or ""The Waste Land"", I am almost positive it's a DeVoto quote.  That passage doesn't exist in ""The Waste Land"" but I'll read both just to make sure.  Sorry, it's just something that bothers me.",0.994,0.803,0.145,0.052,0.5770151651283727

Third, I love the intimacy.  Gentlemen, look no further than the violet hour if you are looking to take a lady out on a nice date.  The high chairs, the lighting, and decor of the bar creates an environment that will help set the mood for a great nite.

I understand that getting at table is tough and by 10pm, you're facing a line that's 10-15 deep.  But the bouncer is reasonable, if not friendly, and you tend to make single serving friends as you suffer through inevitable wait to enter.  However, said friends may be wearing a mind boggling choice of couture; golf polo, shorts and flip-flops.  Perhaps not quite the sophisticated experience that the owners are going for. Dress code faux pas' aside you step inside and take in the dark and mysterious interior.  A solitary bartender (in vintage gear no less) shakes cocktails under a spotlight of incandescence, and patrons in high backed booths sip cocktails and revel in a Chicago drinking establishment that doesn't have flat screen TV's above the bar, and Buck Hunter near the bathrooms.  At first glance it seems nice enough, but then it's time to actually get your drink on.  You order a classic such as a whiskey smash, or a caipirinha, and then you wait.  And wait.  Your wine buzz from dinner gradually fades, and you wait.

Violet Hour takes great care to use high quality liquor and brags that it makes its own mixers from fresh fruit juices, etc. The mixed drinks all seem to cost $12 each, which is very expensive for a cocktail in Chicago, but an appropriate premium to pay for the ambiance and attention to detail put into the Violet Hour experience. That said, everyone in my 5 person party was galled by the unapologetically slow service. I can understand waiting 45 or more minutes for a table at a chic club where space is at a premium because they won't admit you unless they've got a seat for you. Ok. They also shouldn't let you in unless they're prepared to serve you. We waited more than 30 minutes per round for drinks. On a Monday. After 10. And our server wasn't so busy that she couldn't stand around the bar chatting and watching the bartenders show off their mixological skills. Just odd that with Violet Hour's prices it wouldn't also put a premium on volume and pump clients full of $12 drinks as fast as they could. The food is unremarkable, but that's not why the majority mid and late-20's crowd was there.

2009-06-02,4.0,"I was in from NYC over Memorial Day Weekend and wanted to find some place that could compete with the usual speakeasy suspects of NYC. After doing a little google search, Violet Hour appeared when referencing Sasha Petraske (the proclaimed NYC cocktail god) famous for his cocktail dens Milk & Honey and White Star . It seems the owner of Violet Hour, Tobey Maloney,  used to work for Petraske at Milk & Honey in NY as well as spending time at other major cocktail dens throughout the 90's and early 2000's. That coupled with the gorgeous decor of Violet Hour made it a must-try on my list. We headed out around 10pm and were met with a rather long line outside the entrance. I had heard the entrance was hard to find ( much like most speakeasies are) but here, the line was so long we didn't have that problem. It was a bit of a turn-off as most places I've been either take reservations or if there's a long wait, you give them you're # and they call you when they have a table available for you (it actually said they did this on the VH website). Sadly nobody was taking numbers the night we went and we ended up spending about 45 minutes waiting for our table. I was pretty irked and was ready to leave by the time we were seated, but I figured we had already waited so long we might as well have a drink. I was just crossing my fingers that it was worth the wait. Well, it was. The drink I started off with was the Zarzamora. It had Wild Turkey 101 Bourbon, Lemon, Fernet Branca, Blackberries, and Orange Bitters. It was amazing! I usually don't like whiskey, but I asked for something with blackberries and this was right up my alley. I can't recall the second drink I had, but it was another off the whiskey menu. It was also superb. My friend had the Six Corner Sling with Old Overholt Rye, Punt e Mes, Lemon, and Green Chartreuse. Surprisingly it tasted like an iced tea. It was yummy!!  It was nice that if we weren't sure what we wanted we could give our preference of ""spirit"" to the waitress and she'd have the bartender do his thing. I tend to do things that way when I'm in a place I know is manned by excellent ""mixologists"" or bartenders :) I would have given this place 5 stars, but the line was unnecessary and the food needs some improvement. I had the deviled eggs and they lacked flavor, my friend ordered the hummus, which was good, but let's be honest, IT""S HUMMUS! The third thing we tried were the duck and goat cheese wontons. They were fine, but not of the caliber that the drinks were, which begs the question, if you're serving such amazing drinks, why serve average food?  The decor is really beautiful, two separate rooms, first room has the tall-backed chairs, gorgeous velvet curtains from floor to ceiling, violet blue walls with white picture frame moulding. The second room has booths and a large automan where you can sit with smaller tables surrounding it and a fireplace. It's really a beautiful place to take a date or some friends for a quiet evening with exquisite drinks and atmosphere.

I like to try different things and the drinks are definitely different. Each one that I sampled had a unique taste but not enough to keep me ordering the same thing so I tried 3 different kinds while I was there. Started with the Etiquette, made with a sparkling wine base, which was nice and refreshing and definitely a good compliment to the peanut butter banana bites that I had been dreaming about since I first saw the menu online. I will come back solely for the allure of those peanut butter bites! I didn't taste any banana in them but seriously the uber-weird combo of wildflower honey and crispy bacon bits on top of them was phenomenal! My friends refused to be as adventurous as I and did not sample these bites of deliciousness but that's ok because there was more for me! :-) The other drinks I tried were the Hummingbird, made with tequila though the tequila tones are muted by the other mixers, and the Hush and Wonder, which was un-noteworthy that I don't even remember what it tasted like (it was actually the second drink I had so it's not that I don't remember due to inebriation!). Anyway, we stayed longer than I had anticipated considering we arrived around 7pm on a Friday night (I didn't feel like waiting in line) and spent a bit but that's ok. The decor is pretty cool though it is very dark and difficult to see the menu but this just makes it a great place to go on a date when you're having a ""bad skin day"". We were moved from one of those ""shared"" table with the high backed chairs to a booth later on - I do prefer the booths - very roomy and you don't have neighbors hearing your conversations. Bathrooms are unisex with ""house rules"" posted above the toilets and  yes, I was asked to go outside to complete my phone call. Leave the cell phone at home here. Before we left the ladies ordered those chicken teriyaki sammies but I was most definitely not a fan. I don't know if it was all the acidity from the drinks but the teriyaki taste was way too much and too salty and just really bad. On the way out, walking from the middle room through the first to the curtained off exit, we were assaulted with a horrid stench of vomit in the front room. They lost a star for that.

Better value than innumerable other places where drinks are watered-down and carelessly or incorrectly prepared.  Also many tasty items on the food menu which are above-average fare. One of the bartenders went to culinary school and was apparently a chef before joining the staff.  I misheard something that one of the servers said:  ""The house cocktails are listed on the thirty-fourth page of the menu"" - actually what she said was: ""on the 3rd and 4th page of the menu"".  There might as well be 34 pages, though. For example there is an entire page devoted to varieties of mezcal, which was impressive because not many people drink it at all.   There are three large seating areas in separate rooms. Most seats are free-standing arrangements of high-backed square chairs covered with pale violet cloth, there are also booths with a similar minimalistic motif. There are two sections of the bar in separate rooms which have a limited number of additional seats. There are fireplaces with mantlepieces built into the walls.  Basically, come here with friends, or with someone whom you want to get to know better, because it's not a place to mingle with new people.  It is not a see-and-be-seen place, either, no one will be looking at you. Perfect place for quiet intelligent conversation.  Very subdued setting. Not pretentious, it is totally chill.  Almost surreal place which would take a lot of writing to fully explain, read some of the numerous reviews below, put them together, and you will get the general picture. Unique, and one of the rare Chicago bars that deserves the 5 star rating.",0.9854,0.861,0.108,0.032,0.5136343022057308

2009-05-20,5.0,"This is my first review and I figure why not review one of the best bars I've ever been to.  I must admit that I have just moved to Chicago and actually went to this bar the last time I was in Chicago visiting before I moved.   Let me start with the entrance.  I have been to many different cool clubs, lounges and bars and this by far takes the cake.  Not only is it not marked with a gaudy sign or any sign at all, but there isn't anyone even outside to indicate that there may even be a place here.  No velvet rope, nothing.  It is a speakeasy in every sense of the word.  The only thing that is kind of showing that there is something there is actually pretty funny.  A spray painted pictured of a man who is all decked out and pointing toward the door greets those in the know.  Also there is an old looking yellow light over the door.  In fact, it seems as though they have painstakingly gone out of there way to make it seem like there is nothing there.  Knowing what's going on and the signs makes you feel like you are part of a secret society....and maybe you are.   Once you go in the door you are greeted by a very dark hallway that leads to a set of plush, dark curtains.  All this mystery opens up to one of the best spots in the city.   The scene in here is like out of Alice and Wonderland.  Between the dark lighting, indie music and super high-backed chairs you really feel like you've fallen down the rabbit's hole.  This is a great place to go when you want to have a great experience and actually be able to have a conversation. The drinks here are fantastic.  The bartenders are more concerned with making your drink perfectly than to how many drinks they're cranking out, like in most places and they actually still practice mixology techniques that have long gone out of mainstream style.  This leaves you with a true sense of craftsmanship with every drink.   All in all this place is wholly deserving of their current place as one of the best drinking spots in the country.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a truly great drink.",0.9983,0.77,0.217,0.014,0.533501291989664

The bartender even does a little shake shake bootie dance just for you as he mixes the drink. The bartenders here definitely like to do what they do, and it shows.  This place was also hard to find. It was my first time in Chicago and our cab passed the place twice. Just look for a giant mural of a man outside on the side of the building.  The only thing I didn't like was that this place was very anal about everything. I guess it comes with the territory if you are visiting a speakeasy. There weren't enough seats to accomodate everyone, but still, I got yelled at for moving a barstool. Granted, I was a little tipsy, but I hate power trips. I don't think this place is fond of anyone who goes here to get their drink on. Its more of a fancy place to sit, order one drink, and look pretty.

Whether you want to show off to your friends or your date, or just care a lot about making a good drink--this place is for you.  Very hard to find unless you know what you're looking for. It's a grey building with wooden siding; siding even extends over the front door. There are no signs, only thing you can look for is a line out front if it's past 10pm. Definitely make sure you know where you are going before you take people there, otherwise the ""cool"" factor you get by knowing about this place goes away. Once you've found it, rules are as follows: All coats must be checked, cell phone use is strictly prohibited and no one can stand--there must be a seat for your entire group otherwise you'll be left waiting out front for a space to open up. So get there early. If you go after 10pm you'll be waiting. Once inside, you can either sit at the bar or at tables with VERY high backed chairs.

2009-04-05,5.0,"It's not a myth - this place absolutely serves the best cocktails in the city.  On top of that, it's also Chicago's most gorgeous bar.  The Violet Hour models itself after a turn-of-the-century speakeasy with its signless exterior and handcrafted Prohibition-era cocktails.  From the outside, the bar is unidentifiable with its unmarked wooden sliding door, save for the line that quickly forms by 10 pm.  Patrons are allowed entry only if open seats are available to encourage conversation, and cell phone use is prohibited.  The result?  A bar filled with just the right amount of in-the-know clientele who appreciate the extra effort.   Most of the seating consists of gorgeous dark blue high-backed chairs with candlelit glass tables.  Light blue walls with white accents and dark wood give the room a gorgeous sheen of color that pops beautifully through the candlelight.  Booths and seats at the bar are also available, but neither feels quite as elegant as the chairs.   Precision and attention to detail go into these drinks like I've never seen.  One round of drinks can take up to 15 minutes for your server to bring back to the table, but the wait is well worth it.  Violet Hour handcrafts its own bitters, syrups and even various ice cube shapes to best complement each type of drink.  It's impossible to go wrong with a cocktail here.  Two standbys I always try include their seasonal sangria (so far the summer sangria has been my favorite) and any of their drinks with egg whites.  The egg whites sound a bit strange, but they add a frothy, delicious texture to the cocktails that makes them truly unique.  The cocktail menu is divided by liquor type and includes extensive options based with rum, whiskey, brandy, tequila or other spirits.   Service has always been excellent here.  Everyone demonstrates a knowledgeable, friendly attitude, and I'm impressed with how familiar servers are with the nuances of each cocktail.   Some are turned off by the waits at the door that can last up to an hour or longer, but going earlier in the evening (around 9 pm) or with a small group can mitigate much of this.  Also, this is one of the ONLY bars I'll still wait in line for.  Considering that I stopped doing this at most bars several years ago, that's a pretty bold statement for me to make!  Many times, I've reassured curious first-timers next to me in line that the wait is worth it. And worth it the Violet Hour is.  If you're looking for a classy spot with drinks that taste as good as the decor looks, this place is a must-try.  You'll walk away feeling like you've just discovered one of Chicago's best-kept secrets.",0.9977,0.797,0.183,0.02,0.5399577572964669

Anyway...my enjoyment of this place is colored mostly by the following: 1. I really love a serious cocktail. The futher away from the watered down, plastic cup, regular bar slop - the better. 2. I really love a knowledgeable bartender! Any jerk can pull a beer or shake some things together in a bullet and hope for the best - but these people honestly love and understand booze. They've studied it in some form or another. They can answer pretty much any question you might have from the origins of cocktail names, to the history behind your favorite tipple, to the best way to make your own at home. 3.

The heavy curtains and low lights allow for a little bit of fancy. It's a retro fantasy you don't have to be tripping to enjoy. Okay, yes. If I had to wait, I'd be annoyed. Who likes wasting time in a queue? But it's true in VH's case that good things come to those who wait. The hostess is friendly and happy to explain the system, and she's going to be just as protective of your right to enjoy your time at the VH as she is of the pepole you're waiting for. You know what? Now that I'm thinking about it...I'm glad that some of you can't be bothered to wait for the amazing. That sounds like a shorter line for me!",0.9979,0.679,0.258,0.063,0.5701301408618481

2009-03-20,4.0,"The Violet Hour is a very special place.  I'm certainly no goth, but I've always had an affinity for the dark, and the Violet Hour caters to it quite well.  There's something about black, and leather, and velvet, and high-backed chairs, and dim lighting; walking into the Violet Hour is like walking into another world.  The ambiance is so enthralling.  It's somewhat like a cross between a speakeasy during the times of prohibition, and how I imagine a Vampire's den might be.  I've never seen anything else quite like it. As amazing as the Violet Hour looks, I imagine most people go for the drinks, and they do not disappoint.  They are expensive, but they'll probably be the best drinks you've ever had.  They're really not even drinks, they're more like art. The only thing ordinary about the Violet Hour is the service.  I've had varying experiences.  Sometimes great, sometimes OK, and sometimes really bad.  The worst time, we waited 20 minutes for the waitress to come by, and then another 20 minutes to get our drinks, and that was on a weekday.  So it's hit or miss, but still definitely worth it. My only real complaint, is that unfortunately the Violet Hour has become something of a novelty lately.  The people that go there don't seem to appreciate it very much, which I find to noticeably detract from the experience.  The first time I went it seemed more . . . authentic; there seemed to be a sense of awe in the room.  But now it's filled with people who seem to be unaware of how magical it is, and are only interested in the place because it's kind of a secret that other people don't know about.",0.9827,0.763,0.16,0.076,0.5966462585034013

One word comes to mind: Swanky. A date took me here, and I had heard great things but never really heard anything of their concept. First off, I couldn't find the place (which is awesome) because it adds to the appeal. There's basically just a door with no label.  You walk in, and it's kind of like walking into a haunted house with high velvet curtains and no lights. You open the curtains to a beautiful, dimly lit space with blue walls, chandeliers , a long sleek bar and high backed chairs to make you feel like royalty.  Violet Hour is the perfect place to go for a date because it's so intimate. When sitting in the chairs at the small white tables you feel as if you're off in your own little world. The music croons softly in the background and everything is super chill.  If you go here, you have to try their list of specialty cocktails. They have VERY unique spirit lists here and it goes by type of spirit. I was very impressed with the selection. I tried two of their cocktails: Juliet & Romeo Beefeater, Mint, Cucumber, Rose Water (Which was light and refreshing) and also the Part & Parcel, made with Tito's, Grapefruit, St. Germaine, Grapefruit Bitters (Also very refreshing). These drinks pack quite the punch, so get ready to be boozed up. This place has rules. Yes, that's right, I said rules. I came during the week, so I didn't see the weekend crowd, but I heard there can be a line and a long wait for tables. So this means that when the doorman tells you the place is at capacity, that means there are no seats free. PHEW..finally an establishment that doesn't pack em' in like sardines. Also, they don't take reservations, you can't use your cell phone, they don't serve Grey Goose, light beer, or bombs of any kind (rats). There's such an allure to this place that draws in the crowds. Maybe it's the speakeasy aspect, or the mysterious and sexy vibe that radiates from the building... It might be fun to just go in one night and sit at the bar. Rumor has it that they have 8 different kinds of ice which they use for different drinks as not to water them down quickly. Shaved, Blocked...to give some examples. This place is totally Alice in Wonderland meets the real world and I totally love every minute of it. When I love a place, I will rave about it and Violet Hour is an A+ in my book.",0.9964,0.818,0.148,0.034,0.6178800705467372

Firstly, I love the appropriate, slightly snobby insistence of no signs/traditional storefront windows outside. Those who know where the light is, open the door and step through the heavy, soft drapes into a very muted, initmate place. The darkness of the rooms are made further dramatic by the sweeping high-backed chairs that leave one feeling like a cross between Alice In Wonderland and Elvira.  Maybe that's just me.  I like the wide whiskey selections (on behalf of my whiskey-enjoying friend who does not Yelp, poor soul). I have only ever had one drink I didn't prefer from this place; and the reason I phrase it that way is because the drink was balanced/mixed perfectly; I just didn't like the flavors together. Many other people probably do.  This is a very unique place to bring someone to have an intimate conversation and to deliciously, inobtrusively gawk at the trixie nodding off in the chair next to you. The drinks are so perfect if there's something off about them, it may very well just be that your mouth is wrong.

2009-03-15,3.0,"One friend put it best when stating that Violet Hour's tag line should be: The only thing that will top your anticipation to enter is the eagerness to leave. Tru Dat.  Unfortunately, Violet Hour's appeal has worn off for me.  I had first gone to Violet hour a little over a year ago for my birthday and had a wonderful time. The drink our group got was the ""sidecar"" and it was nothing short of extraordinary. At the time we had gotten right in, maybe a minute wait for them to set up our area but that was it. I was especially impressed when the man who checks id's recognized that my b-day was only 3 days away and brought the entire group a round of small drinks on the house as a Birthday gift. We had come with a large group, I believe around 12 people and realized that the rule at violet hour is that we could not each order a separate drink. We got a different menu for groups that has a smaller selection (at the time about 6-8 different choices). i believe if you are a group of 6 or more, you can only order drinks by the carafe and everyone in your party has to have the same thing... a little gestapo-esque but our choice of drink was tasty and I think we all enjoyed it. This was my good experience.  Since then I've developed a sort of animosity for the place. I mean, it really isn't as cool as they want you to think it is with the hype of there being no sign, no reservations, no cell phone use, low lighting, big chairs, and small tables. It's really not that hard to get into and after going twice I'll be completely content to never go again.  My second visit was last night with a group of 4 other friends. The wait was about 15-20 minutes and we got to wait inside in the little hallway with heaters so it wasn't so bad. The doorman (a different one from the first time) checked our id's and wished my friend a happy belated birthday when he saw on her id that her b-day was the day before. We were sat at a lovely tall booth right across from the bar. Our waitress was nice but defo just okay as a server. We got the standard water to start and took a few minutes to select our drinks... the waitress took 20 minutes to come back. We order our drinks (which come standard- don't try to order a drink that's simple or not already a mix up anything not already on the menu- that's not allowed and for good reason) and our server tells us that it takes 20 minutes for each drink (that's the reason)... PS we ordered nothing out of the ordinary, they just take their sweet ass time. I think they wait for several tables to order and hope that tables order like things so they can mix a large batch rather than 3 individual drinks. Anyway, that 20 minutes was actually 35.  During the next 35 minutes (yes, we timed it... I'm sorry but 35 min is a long time off from 20 min, which was already very long) we watched anxiously as the bartender, oh pardon me, mixologist, made drinks. We named him ""chops"" for his enthusiastic mutton chops. We liked his method...until we tried our drinks, but for a few moments it was entertaining to watch him mix things like a salsa dancer. He had these arm movements similar to Ben Stiller's salsa dancing in Along Came Polly. We also noticed that he would side a bit of each drink for himself to taste for quality control, we assumed.... but after we tasted our drinks all found it hard to believe that he could have tried ours and still sent them out with a clean conscience.  2 of our drinks were horrendous - mine happened to be one of those. The 3 other drinks got a better rating of just plain awful. It's funny because when the drinks came a couple of us with smaller glasses thought something along the lines of ""great, of course we end up ordering the tiniest drink"" but after trying them were elated that there was such a small amount we'd feel obligated to take down. It felt like punishment and we all agreed that the drinks gave you a sugary, gross, hot feeling all the way down your throat to your stomach, much the way thick cough syrup does. We all had choked and gagged them down. We all felt sick and thought that calling them syrup would have been more fitting than calling them drinks. 2 of my friends ""drinks"" actually felt like it messed with their tooth enamel, which sounds ridiculous, I know, but if you'd tried them you might feel the same.  I don't want to say you shouldn't go there, you should. You should go at least once and hope for a less off-night because it is beautiful inside and while it's no longer the only or coolest speakeasy place in Chicago, it's worth a peak and the opportunity to form your own opinion.",0.9976,0.778,0.151,0.071,0.5099404761904763

At some point we'd begin fantasizing about the bar we would open, listing off the things that we would ban and encourage (white baseball caps - OUT, good music that's not too loud - IN). We jokingly named it ""Actually Fun."" Now I find myself, ten years later, discovering that Actually Fun has come true in the form of the amazing Violet Hour. I must confess. I love this place and frankly, am a little jealous that I didn't think to open it myself. Yes, the drinks are slow, yes the wait can be long, but actually, I think this helps the entire mood of the Violet Hour.  Don't like the wait? I don't want to be sat next to someone impatient anyway. Don't like the cell phone ban? No one really wants to hear your private conversation. This is not a place to come and get drunk and be obnoxious (which has its place of course!). The creative cocktail list should let you know that the drinks here are mini works of art, meant to be savored and appreciated, not slammed back. I love the fact that each time I've been here I've just randomly selected a drink and it's been fantastic. The dark and cozy atmosphere I have found works for celebrations, romantic dates, or long talks, because it sets a nice party vibe, while still allowing one to hear conversation.

2009-02-06,5.0,"I convinced a bunch of friends to try the mysterious Violet Hour. The whole hidden door, no sign thing really intrigued me. So we took the el and it was real close to the Damen stop. We opened a random, wooden door in an unassuming brick building and walked into a bare, dark warehouse-looking area. A heavy curtain blocked us from seeing anything. There was just a single, lone sign hung up on the wall with their ""house rules."" No grey goose, no Budweiser, no talking on your cell phone, and some other very interesting rules. So of course my group of 11 was really wondering what the heck we were waiting for and if it was really going to be worth the wait at all. After waiting for about 15 minutes we decided to just put our name down and head over to another bar. After about 30-40 minutes I received a phone call from them and we were finally going to experience the Violet Hour.  Once inside we were all very impressed with the unique set-up and dark ambiance. The motif was modern meets antique with a prohibition era-esque style. The place was very romantic, cozy, and very upscale. We were seated at a booth with ottomans added to the end to accommodate our large party. The menu was definitely different than any other I had seen before- pricey but creative. Our server was friendly and recommended something off their carafe menu. It was a Winter Carafe that served 9-10 for $90. Our server brought the carafe out and poured it out into each glass. She then started dropping a mysterious mixture from a vial, using an eye dropper- very rufi style. The drink tasted like a mixture of cognac and sweet juices. The mysterious drops were supposedly spices of some sort. Everyone in our party seemed to enjoy the unique winter beverage.  If your not feeling adventurous, they have tons of drinks options and a pretty lengthy menu for each type of liquor from vodka, rum, gin, tequila, whiskey, brandy, wine, and champagne. It was a great place to chat and catch up with our group of friends. It's definitely a change of pace from your typical lounge/bar/club with loud music and crowded spaces. I highly recommend it for an after dinner date night as well. If you're feeling up for something different and a little more on the fancy side, check out the Violet Hour.

We sat at the bar with my party of 6, so Henry was sort of our personal bartender for the night.  I didn't even bother with the awesome old-school menu- I told him I wanted a drink with whiskey or gin or whatever, and he would whip up some customized thing using all the medicinal-looking bottles and eyedroppers behind the bar.  Sitting at the bar was also great because Henry would let us try all the interesting bitters and liquers that went into our drinks, separately and for free!  My friend who doesn't like hard alcohol also got to drink champagne for free all night, a gesture that made us all love this place even more.  Although some might consider the drinks here a little pricey, they are STRONG and worth every penny.",0.9937,0.772,0.21,0.018,0.5717261904761904

I had a really good experience while waiting for the rest of my group to arrive with the bartender explaining about the drinks. Also he made a favorite drink of mine, the Pink Lady, even though it's not on the menu and it looked just like the ones in the movie Topper, where I first heard of them. Sweet! Anyways, it's pretentious and if you're a guy and you like it, that's kinda weird, but it's the kind of place girls want to go to because it's chi chi and sophisticated and art-deco-y.

2008-12-27,4.0,"How cool is this place? Way cooler than I am, let me assure you, but they let me in anyway. I'm pretty sure it's cause I said I would pay for the drinks I got. That seemed to win them over. I'm not quite sure what I can add. There are going to be people that love this place, and there are going to be those that hate it. I am of the former persuasion. From the moment I had to go through the ""secret"" entrance, to the dimly lit seating areas, the high-backed chairs, and the whole air of speakeasy exclusivity, I was in love. I was with a larger group, eight or so people, and we managed to get right in (early-ish on a Saturday evening) and seated in a relatively comfortable area tucked away at the back.  Let's talk about the not-so-great first: The waitress was super-friendly, but seemed to forget us at times, which sucked when we were ready to order drinks, knowing it would take about 20 minutes to see our orders come to fruition.  The music got a little overwhelming at times. They could definitely stand to lower it, put on a little jazz or something to fit the mood a bit more. I don't need heavy beats and technopoprockdisaster blaring my eardrums half to bleeding.  And the ""tables"" are super tiny. If you order food, prepare to hold either the plate or your glass with a group the size of mine. Onto the great: Seriously, aside from the music, the atmosphere is unbelievably cool. It's exactly what I want in a lounge when I go. It's dark, intimate, and inviting.  The drinks are out of this world. I had a Six Corner Sling (Old Overholt, Lemon, Punt e Mes, Grapefruit Bitters), and it is, by far, the best mixed drink I have ever tasted. I would recommend it to anyone, whether you like whiskey or not.  Also try The Berliner (Tanqueray, Lemon, Gilka Kummel, Apricot, Egg Yolk, Tangerine Bitters). This may be a little bit more hit or miss. It's extremely complex, but if you develop a taste for it, it's wonderful. I also tried the sammies, two of the duck confit and one of the BBQ pulled pork. The pulled pork was good, nothing special, but the duck? Wow. Can't recommend that sandwich enough. The best part of the night, though, had to be the Fried Peanut Butter-Banana Bites with Wildflower Honey and Bacon. I knew I was going to like these, because I'm American, so I'm a sucker for anything that's deep fried. Add bacon? Well, that's just not fair. It's a peanut buttery bacon banana explosion in your mouth. The flavors are perfect together, and everyone in my party loved them. Go for these alone and I promise you will not regret it. Overall, the few faults, which may repel others who find those things more important, were not enough to keep me from having one of the best dining experiences yet. Go to The Violet Hour.

Service was good if not overly attentive, and the atmosphere was fantastic.  It's unmarked from the outside, cozy on the inside.  The atmosphere to me replicates having a few drinks.  Everything's velvety and softened. Now for the food & Drink: The toddy was excellent.  I'm sure it's called something else, but I can't find it online. I hadn't had dinner, so I ordered the most substantial-sounding thing on the menu: The minidogs.  They were good.  The Chicago style was marginal and the Seasonal was excellent.  They're listed as Waygu. I then had a Sidecar, my cocktail go-to.  It was good but not the best I'd had. The Table then got hungry and we ordered the sandwiches. You have a choice of any combination of 3 of Duck Confit, Pulled Pork and Veggie.  We did 2 Duck and a pulled pork.  The Duck confit was unbelievably excellent.  The pork was nothing spectacular. I then had a Julet and Romeo.  It was mindblowing.  It tasted liek Honeysuckle smells.  My wife had a Slim.  It's a Gin-based drink with several additions that make it taste a bit like Ruby Red grapefruit Juice and gin, but leagues better. Our companions had a Dark and Stormy and and eyes wide, and it was roundly agreed that the dark and stormy was the better of the 2.   We closed with the rice krispy platter for dessert.  The Rice krispy treats with Giinger and Peppermint are the marquee item in this platter as it arrived, I predicted they'd be the most disappinting of the trio which included donut holes and spiced sweet nuts.  I was right.  It's a perfect dessert for $6. It makes for a costly evening at $12 a cocktail and similar for each plate of food, so beware of that, but do take in the Violet Hour.  If cocktails aren't your thing, their beer list was excellent and they had a good wine selection.

2008-12-19,3.0,"I've been to the Violet Hour on three occasions.  The first two trips opened my eyes to the potential of a well constructed and mixed cocktail enjoyed with gracious service and striking decor.  Michael, our bartender on both occasions, was knowledgeable and eager to please.  He mixed us his own, off menu creations and gave me samples of unfamiliar components like Cynar and Chartreuse.  Even without the extra free tastes I felt like I was getting my $11 worth from the large, strong drinks.     My most recent visit, however, was deeply shitty.  We had no problem getting in after less than 10 minutes in line, and this was the one positive moment of the evening.  My party of four were seated at the same table we had been at on our last visit.  I noticed that the furniture is starting to show wear and tear-the paint on the table was chipped in several places.  A minor quibble, of course, but attention to detail is what makes or breaks an upper tier bar.  Our waitress was slow in serving us, and didn't seem to know the menu well.  Some of our glasses looked the worse for wear, with scratches on the sides.  But the great disappointment was our bartender, who for the first time was not the supernal Michael.  The drinks we had were like night and day compared to what we had tasted before.  I had to actually explain what an Amber Dream is, and somehow the bar thought it was a good idea to make a Widow's Kiss with tequila instead of bourbon or calvados.  It came out tasting stale, like candy that's been on the rack too long, and we had no choice but to send it back.  The other drinks were unmemorable, or in the case of the Juliet and Romeo overly sweet and astringent.  As a parting salvo, they refused to let us add on two of our friends (I know, the rules list, but we had done just that on the previous visit) and so we left very unsatisfied.  Fortunately, beers at Jerry's helped to sooth our spirits.    I used to love the Violet Hour-now I'm not sure.  Weak service,  deteriorating decor, and a befuddlingly incompetent bartender are not worth the high prices.  5 stars when Michael is mixing your drinks, otherwise don't waste your time.",0.9863,0.77,0.157,0.073,0.3987952506430767

Being stumped by the lack of any formal exterior besides a somewhat greyish-blue door handle, I grabbed her hand and strolled on into an underworld of some swank cartoon. Violet Hour reminds me of Pepé Le Pew. The type of place most agree is laden with a scent of pretentiousness and an aggressive odor that says ""I'm trying too hard."" Poor little skunk. It just wants to be loved. Despite the turnoffs, this violet holds true to form - it has an elusive fragrance you can't seem to get enough of because they do some important things very, very well.  Cocktails are expensive so prep for dropping $10-20 on your poison of choice. Though the price is high, you'll probably see why after a few sips. No watered down booze here. They come nice and solid. Most good things are in this life--furniture, biceps, butts, vehicles, hearts, and then there's . . .you get the point. The ambiance and intimate space gives you and your better half a place to coexist while still feeling part of the apparent secret society thanks to the arrangement and open style of the seating apparatuses (so-called ""Wonderland chairs"") which give it this back-and-forth play. Two things done very well at the cost of high prices and waiting lines. I encountered an attentive and talkative waitress so the reviews of snobby service won't be coming from these lips.

2008-11-15,5.0,"I love this place!  Gorgeous decor, great ambiance, funky old music, amazing bartenders and the best cocktail this town has to offer.  I love that they don't allow the place to get filled up.  Everyone has a seat so there is often a line to get in.  Drink-making is an art at this establishment and only the best bartenders are hired.  A round of drinks for you and 3 friends might take them 10 minutes but it's fun to watch them take fresh ingredients, drops of secret ingredients from little eyedropper bottles, even egg whites, to come up with a drink that is utterly delicious.  They organize their drink menu by the type of alcohol and what I have found fun is to pick a drink from a category that you normally don't like: say Brandy or Gin.  Order it up and it will literally be the best drink you have ever had in your life.  Really!  I swear.  Go check it out.  You'll feel like you have slipped back in time.",0.9891,0.729,0.222,0.049,0.5285714285714286
2008-11-14,5.0,"My absolute favorite place to go out to in the city for drinks or for any reason really. Never go on a weekend because the service and drinks aren't nearly what they are on a week day, also the crowd is horrendous on weekends. My boyfriend I love to go on Sunday nights around 8pm when its nice and quiet and we can sit at the bar. I wish I could remember the owner's name, but he's always there on Sunday nights in the back bar and let me tell you he makes the experience. His drinks are perfection and he's always suggesting thing off the menu. His taste in music is extremely eclectic and he's introduced us to some great new stuff I would have never heard otherwise. Another thing I've learned from conversations with the owner is his concept. The reason there's a line is because theses are not your typical vodka cranberries and jager bombs, these are handcrafted drinks that take a good couple of minutes to make well. So, if you only have a certain number of bartenders making these beautifully hand crafted drinks you can only have a certain number of customers, hence the line. I'm a totally hater of bars with lines, but this is one that makes sense to me. If you want the line to disappear say goodbye to the tasty drinks. The weird hidden entrance is also there to weed out the wasted and unwanted, there's TONS of bars in wicker park for you to go to if you just want to get hosed and pick up a bed buddy.   So in short, best drinks I've ever had, best atmosphere I've seen in a bar, best food in a bar (the deviled eggs with pork belly are to die for). This is the way bars used to be and I only wish there were more like it in the city.  A word on groups, weekdays are fine for large groups otherwise since they don't do reservations over the phone you have to show up sometime before your event and tell them in person how many you're expecting and you will get a reservation. And one more thing, last time we were in the owner had just gotten in ""Old Tom"" gin which he told us hasn't been available for like 90 years or something. Its a sweeter gin and its what used to make the predecessor to the martini, the martinez amongst many other delicious treats!",0.9955,0.769,0.175,0.056,0.5561659831396673

2008-11-10,5.0,"One of my favorite places to go anywhere.  Don't let the exterior and the long line fool you, it's worth the wait, and it really just weeds out the annoying and too drunk.   Inside, you're seated at plush chairs or even at the bar.  Music is good, and at a perfect volume - no shouting necessary.  Limited seating ensures some intimacy and more of a murmur rather than, again, loud crowds. Sometimes it's just hard to find a complicated, entertaining drink in Chicago.  Cocktails are about $15, but they serve some really imaginative mixes and you can sip for hours without getting annoyed looks from the servers.  (just, you know, tip accordingly)",0.5756,0.812,0.106,0.082,0.6696778711484593
2008-11-09,5.0,"I really like this place, but it's not for all of the people all of the time. I am over standing in lines for places, so if there is a line (and there usually is), I consider myself SOL.  However, the doormen and hostesses have always been very accommodating regarding seating preferences Drinks come out S-L-O-W-L-Y. Unless you plan to camp here for an hour minimum, it's frustrating. Start thinking about your 2nd when you get your first. Waitstaff is usually very knowledgeable. This is helpful as they use hard-to-find liquors and unusual-sometimes because they are classic and time intensive to make preparations.  However, if your server *isn't* up to speed, it can be frustrating and end in an unpleasant surprise. It's DARK in there. The menu is really worth reading, but it's neigh impossible to see by your tiny votive and nearly non-existent ambient light. That gets frustrating. Love the decor which is minimal and cozy at the same time. It's never too loud in there. The music ranges from Sinatra to Bruce Springsteen (why?) but is loud enough to provide ambient noise, not loud enough to distract and a nice change from the ambient/techno/electronica or that godawful 'crate and barrel' jazz that get's played in 'hip' places. It's never too crowded in there. their strict no-standing policy keeps the place from feeling confining, while the arrangement of chairs and tables keeps you feeling both private and relaxed. The tables, however are another story - so tiny,that when you drink comes out-usually with a sidecar, it gets smushed onto your minuscule table along with a candle or two. Order food or another drink and-well, it's cumbersome. But it's better that a huge table between you and your partners. No place for your large partying mob who wants to round out the night with a bang. It's a good date place, a sophisticated pre-party enclave, or a post dinner romantic wind down. You will be disappointed if you've been partying all night or want to impress a large number of out of towners. It's not typically Chicago style entertainment (unless you mean old-school speakeasy style) nor worth the patience if you wanna get your drink on, dance your ass off, or rock the Casbah.  Behave - like really. I never found the door staff snooty, but they will pick a chic young trendy couple, a sophisticated group of chaps,  a trio of well dressed (not clubby as much as...well dressed), or a small group of young professionals over 'party people' no matter how much cash you flash. they really seem so want to work that vibe. I'm cool with that. In a city where you can get almost any party atmosphere you want, a space that caters to the come in, spend money, chill out, dont wait in line for (Immaculate-did I mention that?!?!?) restrooms. I'm happy to see this. Oh, one other thing, I have NEVER been rushed out of here. If you and you sit there and nurse one drink for 2 hours, they never make you feel rushed. The atmosphere is such that I have walked out of there shocked there was a line to the corner b/c the staff does not rush you. Damn, that's sweet. First times, skip a weekend night, treat yourself on a Wed perhaps, grab your date or buddy you havent talked to enough lately.

2008-11-09,3.0,"Totally mixed feelings on Violet Hour. Great food and drink, mediocre experience.  I have a strict ""No Bars With a Line to Get In"" policy, which I was willing to break as I've been looking forward to checking out V.H. for quite a while; plus it was Saturday at 8:30, so what do you expect? That said, we were standing in line with some of the worst people you can imagine: some crone tried to bypass the line saying ""We're restaurant people, we won't take up a spot long""; one girl held the door open (letting cold into the warm waiting area) so she could chat with the guy she was there with who was still in line outside; another girl made a quasi-racist comment about the guy working the door; and four loud cougars from the 'burbs were carrying on at shrill tones that should be reserved for experimental music. Ugh. Willing to let all of that slide, as the hostess totally hooked us up on our request that she not seat the cougars next to the open table next to us. Thanks!!! I think V.H.'s seating system needs a little work. Our group of four ended up awkwardly arrayed with two couples in a booth that would have been better for a group of 6-8. While I was glad not to be in the line anymore, I was a little surprised we ended up in the booth given that the process of selecting groups of 2, 3 (3???), 4, 6, or 8 out of the line as seating became available seemed fairly regimented. The menu was superb. Love the arrangement by booze, descriptions, etc. that some people seem put off by. Loved getting to try rare gins (Genevieve's) that I haven't seen elsewhere. Love devilled eggs basted in brown butter with candied pork belly. Great waitress. Her recommendations were spot on, and she quickly and willingly replaced my friend's gin and tonic when it came out with flat tonic. But that begs the question how a hardcore cocktail lounge could end up serving a gin and tonic with flat tonic in the first place? Sharing is our caring, and our group passed each drink around for sampling -- I loved everything I tried. Complaints about too-sweet drinks seem a little oversnooty.  I love to complain, so another word of complaint: when we ordered our first round, our waitress informed us that it would be fifteen minutes before the drinks came out. After forty-five minutes in line with a-holes, I was starting to get the shakes, so we decided to place our second round order when the drinks came. Strictly professional. Unfortunately, the second round (which seemed considerably more complicated in terms of required preparation) came out in five minutes, and since V.H.'s drinks are served in glasses plus a small vial of additional drink, our miniature table ended up packed full of glassware. The couple next to us bounced without finishing their tempura green beans, and offered them up to the girls next to us. I'd already been vulture-eyeing the beans when they arrived while the couple had been out for a smoke, and these girls were also cool with sharing, so we got us some beans and they were phenomenal.

I really liked this place, but didn't love it.  Two weeks later, I'm inclined to think it wasn't so much the VH's fault.  What started as a small gathering turned into a motley crew of nine (probably shouldn't have asked ""Who wants to go to the best bar in Chicago?"" during my business dinner).  After entering the unmarked door, I sashayed through the two velvet curtains (not my first rodeo, people) up to the host, Demetrius.  Apparently I wasn't channeling my inner Hermia that night.  ""Excuse me, could you and your party please step back past the curtain, and then I'll explain how this works?,"" he said.  Whoops.  We were put on the wait list, and Demetrius told us he'd call me when our table was ready.  Fine with me, but one of my (slightly over-served) companions wasn't having it, as expressed by an audible ""This place sucks!"" outburst while Demetrius explained.  Charming. Somehow, we managed to get the call back, and were seated at a spacious booth in the back.  Then our cocktail binders arrived.  That's right.  Binders full of libations classified by the main spirit.  Good stuff:  theviolethour.com/menu.p… .  Here's what I had: 1) Juliet & Romeo - Gin-centric, if you like the East Side Cocktail, you'll be into this Beefeater, Mint, Cucumber, Rose Water 2) Chicago Flip - Brandy-centric boozy milkshake Frapin VS, Whole Egg, Dow's Tawny Port, Cream, Nutmeg Fortunately, most of the nay-sayers in the group were silenced when the cocktails arrived.  Let me take this opportunity apologize to our lovely waitress (Aiden, was it?), because at one point I overheard one of my companions punctuating a ""joke"" to her with the word ""tampons.""  Whatever that was about, I'm mortified and terribly sorry. Two minor complaints.  First, they forgot about our order of snack sandwiches and when they arrived, they were badly burnt (maybe the servers were pissed at us)?  Second, I get that ""The Violet Hour"" is a lovely literary reference, but the place is BLUE (lavender blue at best, but mostly robin's egg).  Those of you who know me understand that I'm obsessed with the color purple, so this was a let-down. Cocktailistas, you'll definitely still want to stop here if you're in town, but even though it's bigger than NYC Petraske establishments, keep your group small (and sober) upon arrival.  And if you don't mind, ask them to throw a little Violet into the color palette.",0.9863,0.795,0.137,0.068,0.3942662779397473
2008-10-21,4.0,"I think I understand why the reviews are so polarizing for VH. On one hand, the place is basically Disneyland for booze. Most everything, right down to the ice is different. Further, at $12 a cocktail - it's really a good value when compared to places which are charging $20 for a Belvidere Tonic. Goes without saying that the room is swanky and with the guidelines for seated guests only it will never seem crowded. On the flip-side, if I had waited an hour in that hallway followed by another 30 minutes for my first drink...  this would have been a very different review. Simply, I would have been hugely disappointed - nothing is THAT cool. So, in total - I think VH is the sort of place that, even if you love it, you'll go 3 or 4 times and then be over it. In the meantime, get a seat at the bar and learn some of the history and background of what they're doing, it's pretty cool stuff.",0.8794,0.861,0.096,0.043,0.6184424603174603

Anyway the other good thing I have to say (the food and drink part counted as 1) is that even with the long ass line outside, the waitress never hinted that she wanted us to get the hell out.  And I would say we clearly sat there and shot the shit for long periods between rounds.  Nevertheless, she didn't' bring the tab (which was damn high.  5 people + at least 3 rounds each + random ""sustenance""= not a cheap date) until we asked for it.   Oh just to echo one thing most down to earth people are yelping: that sign in the bathroom about no Miller or Bud or Grey Goose is soooo unnecessary.  It's akin to the snooty BS that Juicy Wine Bar has in their menu about why their prices are so high and why you she pay up or stay the f away.  I yelped about that a while back.

Soft, dreamy music played in the background. The whole vibe was very whimsical.  The focus at Violet Hour is obviously on the cocktails, so naturally, the menu was full of alcohol I'd never heard of.

I summoned every shred of patience and focused on the lure of delayed gratification... all in anticipation of 'that' magical opportunity. Finally the occasion presented itself. My friend Devan, who lives in L.A., has probably been to Violet Hour a dozen times. Dev's friend, resident mixologist Kyle, was working the bar so after an impromptu phone call enticing us with the promise of bar seats and no wait in line, off we were.   As the 250+ other reviews detail, the feel is definitely vintage. Speakeasy-esque. Dark, intimate, just lovely. The music serves as purely backseat and creates a backdrop which highlights the big three--the cocktails, the ambiance and your own conversation. Expect a clean, brooding Indie sound-- think Leonard Cohen, Portishead, maybe a pick off of 'Garden State' and then a 'Pulp Fiction' track... deliberate juxtaposition. Follow the same rules when dining out: order the specials. So, there are no 'specials' at Violet Hour, which translates to mixologist's choice. Easy decision, he knows best. We talked with Kyle about our preferences and with that insight he created our cocktails. Between the surprises among us, we were courted with rye, house-made bitters, rum, campari, absinthe, gin, honey syrup, egg whites, pineapple, lime and more. The cocktail-crafting process itself is very methodical, unhurried, and personal, from precise eyedropper-rationed measurements, to letting the drink sit and breathe to choosing the proper cut of ice. Really, it was riveting to watch and get the history of each cocktail along the way. Violet Hour may be a bit too intense, too intimate for a first date.  I think this experience is better shared with someone you really... know. And yes, though pricey, you won't mind it. There's no standing, no cell phones: all specialness.  And a world far away from where you are.",0.9907,0.8,0.16,0.04,0.5316091954022989

It takes about 20 minutes for them to make you your drink, but that's because they are made with love. My favorite drink is a mix of orange pekoe tea, beefeater gin, honey suckle, and egg whites that make it a frothy and delicate. I'm not a light weight, but one drink gets me tipsy. It's an enchanting, magical, fancy, pre-prohibition style cocktail lounge with chandeliers, velvet curtains, and bartenders with mutton-chops and vests. It's better to go on weekdays when it's less crowded, but if you go on a weekend, make sure that you get there before 7pm or else the line could take up to 45 minutes. Also, request a seat at the bar -- it's much more fun to watch the bartenders make drinks than to sit in a big chair staring at the person across from you.",0.9814,0.85,0.15,0.0,0.587037037037037

Look for the hidden wooden door.  - Waited about 30 minutes on a Tuesday night, at around 10:30pm, for a table for 2. They don't take reservations either so it is definitely a bad idea to go in a large group. Also, there's no standing anywhere--they won't let you in unless they can seat you. This means there's almost no mingling amongst patrons and don't expect to meet any new people. - Drinks are slow. Verrrry slow. In fact, you should order second round as you are half-way through first round. - The interior is so dark that we had to use our cell phone light to illuminate the menu. Pros:  - Swanky, girly but sophisticated decor.  - Strong drinks! And at $11 a cocktail, they better be!  - Good place for a 1-1 date, or a night out with a few girls.

2008-09-07,5.0,"I just went to The Violet Hour for the first time and I am so smitten with this he place.  It was the perfect setting for my birthday and really set tone of my night.  I'm a sucker for anything vintage, and the design and decor of the bar were absolutely stunning.  The speakeasy vibe was mysterious and intriguing.  The chairs were like something out of ""Alice in Wonderland"" and are designed to keep the conversation inside the group.  No mingling, but I'm not a mingler, so it was definitely my style.   The cocktails are amazingly delicious, of course, and 11 bucks is well worth it.  Especially since at most bars in, I'll pay $8 for a specialty martini that tastes dirty compared to these.  The place is really closed off and if you get there after 9 on the weekends, be prepared to wait in line. Look it up online first because it's unmarked.  It's also really dark in there, so it's hard to read the menu- so check that out first too. There are rules, but the dress policy isn't crazy (no ball caps).  Not great for groups, as the couples get in way faster, but it was well worth the wait.  These guys are pretentious but they treat EVERYONE equally.  Some snotty brat tried to get ahead in the line with her looks and was told  that it was wait it out or leave.  She left.  Bravo.  Once you get in, they are extremely polite and the entire staff was on their game.  Music was great and eclectic, there wasn't a song I didn't like.  Classy, impeccable design-- but probably not a place for everyone.  This is not the place to get wasted, meet people, or move around, but it's a fabulous experience. Would be an amazing date.  I will definitely be back, though not too frequently because I am afraid the wait and atmosphere could get a little old.  Definitely plan and make sure everyone is there when you go in.  Even if it's not your style, you should check it out at least once, because it's such a classy and unique experience.",0.9952,0.773,0.178,0.049,0.5785353535353533

Downside: you have to wait in line, usually for quite sometime, to even get inside (there's no inside waiting room, just a sort of hallway/vestibule place, and the line usually spills out onto the street, giving away its ""secret speakeasy"" location). There are always a few douchebags who try to gladhand the bouncer and bypass the line, but the man won't budge, and said douchebags are appropriately reproached. Once inside, the ambience is nothing short of magical - Alice in Wonderland meets Reservoir Dogs, with a Louis XIV flair. The cocktails are pretty amazing - if you're boring and always order Miller Lite everywhere you go, these drinks are not for you. They include everything from house-made bitters to raw egg whites. And man, will they get you shitfaced, making the $11 flat cocktail price seem pretty darn reasonable. I ordered something to snack on: a peanut butter and bacon (thank you God) sandwich, fried in some sort of sweetish honey crust and vafdglkergasfjaraaejl...oh, sorry, my verbal abilities melted into nonsense at the recollection of it. I was really nervous that the people who go there, not to mention work there, would be typical Wicker Park snobs, but the servers are amazing, and really seem knowledgeable, and the way the tables and chairs are set up you basically don't have to deal with anyone.

Found the plywood, signless facade in the rain and made my way through a chasm of curtains to the hostess stand.  There were two of us and the rest of our friend's hadn't arrived yet so I broke out my phone to find their 20.  Cute British hostess kindly told me there was no cell phone usage allowed so I took my conversation back through the curtains. Broken Social Scene was playing and I complimented the hostess on this, because I was worried she was going to kick me out for wardrobe unbecoming a chach.  We thought we'd hang by the bar and have a drink while our friend's travelled, but at both bars there was only one stool available.  There is no bar loitering allowed, if you're not seated you're not staying.  So we were guided to a table in the back and handed an 11 page menu.  I wanted so badly to ask if they had a good deal on PBR just to piss her off.  Instead I ordered one of their five dollar microbrew's and my friend tried to order a vodka soda.   Server:  ""I'm sorry we don't have soda."" Friend: ""Seriously?"" Okay, can I just get a vodka cran? Server:  ""Sorry no cranberry either."" Friend: ""Flavored vodka?"" Server: ""No"" Friend: ""Cum cocktails?"" Server: ""That we do have.  Julio, mount up, we need another jizz julep."" Finally my friend was able to order a glass of wine.  I took a piss in one of the single person unisex bathrooms and as I was washing my hands I read the rules up on the mirror.  Essentially no bombs of any kind, no grey goose, no cosmo's, no cell phone's, no improper wardrobe, no ball caps.  Are you fucking kidding me with this place. We were booted after our second drink because apparently the night vision goggles I was wearing to see the person across the table from me didn't fit with their attire requirements.  It's too bad they don't allow bombs, because I'd really like to blow this place up.",-0.9829,0.745,0.093,0.162,0.493531746031746

2008-09-01,3.0,"Call me out of the loop, or perhaps just really down to earth, but I had been wondering what was going on with that boarded up store front on Damen just south of North Avenue for quite awhile. Turns out it's the speakeasy facade to the Violet Hour. I can't decide if the front is cheesy, or reveals that the owners and staff have a good sense of humor about their whole establishment. The funny thing to me is that there are probably people who loooove the ""secrecy"" of the place in the same spirit that back in 1992 I looooved the fact that you had to enter The Alley through an alley; it does add a certain amount of allure and cache. Just keep telling yourselves that.  So I was here for Jason E.'s birthday party, and overall, I had a great time. We had two booths in the most private room of all, the one all the way in the back, shrouded by the most velvet curtains. I did adore the fact that this was a party that was essentially at a bar, and I didn't have to shout over a drone or worry about finding a place to sit down. It's also lovely that you cannot be on your cell phone while you are here. I appreciated the soundtrack, which began with Bob Dylan's ""Blonde on Blonde"" and had worked its way to 1940s hits by the time we left several hours later. I found all of the servers and doormen to be extremely cordial and helpful throughout the evening too. When I arrived, our server asked me what kind of liquor I preferred, and whether I wanted something sweet, sour, or refreshing. Based on my answers, ""gin"" and ""refreshing,"" she returned with a Juliet and Romeo, which, with its initial punch of cucumber and citrus finish, was delicious. The miniature pitcher that accompanies the drink is really cute too.  I was not as pleased with the Sidecar. Don't get me wrong, it was good. I just think that the California Clipper's are better. What is funny is that I had no problem paying $11 for the Violet Hour's Sidecar, and balked at the Clipper's larger $10 one with the sugared rim. At one point I ordered waffle fries with the shallot blue cheese sauce. I probably should have ordered the deviled eggs, which always receive top notch reviews. But for some reason the eggs just weren't calling to me. The fries were generously portioned, crispy, and well seasoned. I was disappointed with the blue cheese sauce. It was served cold. I guess I was expecting a hot, bubbly thick sauce to create an upscale version of Cheese Fries. This was more like roquefort dressing. sigh.  On a side note, Yelper extraordinaire and emerging pastry chef Amy F. brought mini cupcakes to die for, especially the chocolate banana ones with the peanut butter butter cream. And, Coco Rouge whipped up a bourbon pear and chocolate 3-tiered cake, complete with ganache and 24-carat gold leafing. Can we see a new business in Coco Rouge's future? More importantly, can we make sure Amy F. becomes the super star she deserves to be?  Overall, I like the Violet Hour. I would definitely return with 6-8 friends for a night of good conversation.

2008-08-25,4.0,"I've been meaning to check out Violet Hour since it opened a few months back as I was an old-school NYC M&H patron prior to them having a website, contact info or for that matter anything more than word of mouth, amazing drinks, and what at the time felt like a nice secret society away from all of the usual nightlife. A place where you could escape for an hour or so, enjoy conversation, and get a taste of what Prohibition-era cocktailing was all about. It was pretentious, exclusive, and perfect. I was a tad skeptical when I learned of the Violet Hour - because I always find the originals to be better than the spin-offs however, upon finding out that some of the people behind VH were from MH, my expectations were again high.  We decided to finally check it out after dinner at Cafe Absinthe.  We walked up to the door at about 10PM which from all the reviews seemed liked ""prime time"" I introduced myself to DeCarlo at the door, exchanged pleasantries and let him know that I was a patron of MH from back in the day. He explained the procedure was pretty much the same and couldn't seat incomplete parties (we were waiting for two friends to join us) - he asked for our cell # and said it would be about 20 minutes. He also said this to the 5 or so other parties that arrived before us. Having been involved in both NY nightlife and Chicago nightlife for longer than I care to say, I knew this wasn't going to be the case. When our friends arrived, I gave D the ""nod"" letting him know we were all there and within 5 seconds we were escorted inside. For people that complain about waiting to get in here or anywhere in this city for that matter, you just have to know the game. I havent waited on a line in 12 years and this has nothing to do with being a dbag that pays off doormen. Be nice, be cordial, find a commonality, act as if, and you're solid. If you cant pull any of that off, why are you going out in the first place?  Once inside, the vibe was very MH. I loved it immediately. We had a nice corner booth, tucked away, private and comfortable. The music was low and unimportant as it serves as background to conversation and little else. The waitress was friendly, informative, and knowledgeable and made great wine selections to the girls even though I tried my best to tell them to have a cocktail since that is what VH is all about. I opted for the summer sidecar which was delicious and then opted for a second one even though my initial plan was to try a few different things. We didn't have a ton of time to stay that night, so we left after two rounds - in my opinion its not a place to stay for more than 2 hours or so anyway, but next time around I will surely branch out and give some different cocktails a try.

2008-08-18,5.0,"I went to Violet Hour this past Friday to celebrate the birthdays of my girlfriend and myself. The evening began with food and wine at Avec. We then caught a cab to Violet Hour. The line when we arrived at 10:30 stretched a good fifteen to twenty people out the door. People were mostly well dressed. There were a few middle aged yuppie types, a few groups of sorority-type twenty somethings, and a few horn-rim wearing emo types that looked like they were still in high school. We waited for a good twenty minutes with the line advancing minimally. (VH only lets people in as people leave; why this is becomes abundantly clear when you enter.) Eventually, however, a well dressed bouncer came out with a clipboard to ask whether there were only two of us. He proceded to escort the two of us in, allowing us to jump what appeared to be at least an additional hour of waiting. (Once you get in past the front door there is an additional, hidden line maybe some fifteen to twenty people deep.) The space was perfect. Very dark. 1950s music playing when we came in (although as the evening progressed they started playing indie-light types such as the Shins, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and other head-scratching choices). The layout is hard to describe but imagine tables laid out in the room. Around the tables there are straight-backed leather chaired with slides that are almost like horse blinders. Almost all the illumination will be coming from the two candles at your space. The effect is that you and your party feel perfectly sequestered. We felt so secluded that we were unsure whether PDA was accepted. We kissed fairly frequently and it did not feel out of place. Drinks were strong. I ordered a cocktail imported from Milk & Honey in New York and a Spanish Margarita. Both came out looking effete and immasculating; that's not how they tasted though. These guys make a stiff cocktail. The girlfriend ordered a Dark & Stormy, twice.  I cannot describe the experience any way other than magical. Violet Hour was the perfect capstone to our evening.  Lastly I want to note my puzzlement with regard to the sorority contingent, who could not have seemed more out of place. They were dolled up hard and looked more like they wanted to meet wealthy men than to have an evening to theirselves.

I was most concerned about waiting in an endless line, so I asked my fellow yelpers for their best advice about when the line turns from manageable to miserable.  After waiting out responses from several people who think they're funny and said ""go now!"" (yes yes, we get it, there's a line), one astute observer (thanks Rob L!) told me that the line starts ""as soon as the sun goes down"" - which I think is right on the money.  We showed up just after 8 and waited for about 5 minutes while they seated the few people in front of us.  If you want to show up at 11...

I wish every bar was the Violet Hour.  Because then all cellphones would be silenced, every venue would be dark enough to make me look extra pretty, I could have rousing conversation at a decent decibel, and I'd be drinking nothing but unique and fancy concoctions of weird liquors and full flavors. If you ask me, you can scram if you don't like this place.  But I'm just a sheba looking for a gin joint where I can tie one on and make some whoopee.",0.7414,0.89,0.08,0.029,0.4929894179894181
2008-08-05,2.0,"Well, I had a tough time trying to decide between 2 or 3 stars...On the one hand, I have been to places of this ilk that are executed much much MUCH more poorly than The Violet Hour, (See my review of Bourbon and Branch in SF)...On the other hand, there are bars like Cafe Absinthe in SF that serve expertly crafted drinks with absolutely none of the pretense, so.... I completely understand the whole speakeasy concept. Sorry Violet Hour, but you are not the first bar with 'mixologists' that want to 'recreate an atmosphere that harkens back to the days of classic cocktails, the likes of which haven't been served since the heyday of the American Bar at the Savoy in London' whew.....did I get enough speakeasy high-concept-y mixology type buzzwords in there? I sure hope so...I won't even complain about the line or the doorman or the service, because frankly, compared to Bourbon and Branch, this was 5 star customer service. However, this was indeed the first time I have been somewhere and seen people from the BACK of the line let in first. ""Darling, did I mention that I'm friends with Liza and Andy Wharhol? Jerry Hall is waiting for me in the bathroom with a gram of Columbian"" Really Violet Hour? Really?! That being said, the times I have been to this bar, the drinks are made well. They know their stuff, and they will respect you and make you a good drink if you know your stuff and dare to go 'off menu'. In fact, this bar could even be tolerable to mildly enjoyable earlier in the evening on a weeknight, but since I now live in Ann Arbor, I shall never know.... The minus 3 stars comes from the fact that my parents (tragically unhip company, I know dahlings) and I were seated on the edge of the infamous square-shaped ottoman that is about a foot away from the wall. For those of you who went to Catholic school, this is akin to the classic punishment of being forced to sit in the corner staring at the wall, but this is a very very dark corner that you pay to sit in. Unfortunately, this area does not come with complimentary neck massages, as you must constantly crank your neck around to talk to the waitress or your company. I reckon that the side of the square punishment ottoman facing out into the bar might be slightly more pleasant, but only slightly. In summary, for classic, well-made cocktails, you need to go to classic places; old hotel bars, places with some character and some characters, places that are still around for a reason. Don't bring your parents or any other 'uncool' people (under the age of 30) if you want to be treated decently.",0.972,0.858,0.096,0.047,0.44615176151761526
2008-08-04,5.0,"ok. so. i have no idea how a venue can be given one star for having a -line- just because someone in another city ""did it first"". hipsters need to go back to art school and re-study the concept of the trap of the pursuit of novelty.  not to mention, its a bar. if it has a line, that means it is a successful bar, and won't be closed a week from now. they have X number of seats, and so they let in X number of people, no more. get over it. we went on a saturday night, with FOURTEEN people and were seated immediately, no line. why? cause we didn't show up at 11pm, we went at 7pm. you know, during THE COCKTAIL HOUR. this is not a venue for closing down your evening. this is a venue for starting your evening. go early, leave early. miss the line, miss the wait, enjoy the drinks, then go somewhere cheaper and less interesting once you've got a few in you and can't tell the difference anyway.  moving on: everyone complains it is too dark in this venue. on behalf of those of us who are extremely light sensitive, this is the only venue i've ever been in where i actually wasn't in -pain- the entire night because of how freaking bright everything always is. i loved the light levels in this venue. they provide lamps for each table. hold it over your menu, read it, order, then put the thing down and just enjoy your evening.  moving on: any venue that has rules like ""no bombs, no grey goose, no cosmopolitans, no bud light, no cell phones, no baseball hats, don't bring anyone you wouldn't take to your mother's for sunday dinner"" is a venue that i'm likely to be very, very happy in. have i mentioned already what a total snob i am about food and drink? i'm sure i have. clearly they want to ensure this does not turn into a place for wannabe VIP room schmucks who think they're going to ""pop krys"" or whatever the hell goes on these days. this is a put on your nice clothes, put on your best manners, and be prepared for an evening of sotto voce conversation. any venue that serves drinks with actual foamed egg whites, actual orange pekoe tea, and fresh fruit juices is always going to get my vote for the place to meet for drinks every time. any venue that says ""ok, thank you for your order, those will arrive in about 10 or 15 minutes"" because they're going to take the time to make them properly instead of the usual bar tender behavior which is to slosh together your drink in the least number of seconds possible because the bar is inevitably under staffed, is always going to get my vote for the place to meet for drinks every time. all cocktails are $11. period. this makes splitting the check in a group much, much easier. for groups of more than 6, they will do a ""carafe"" at $90 which are quite large -- provided you all can agree on a drink of course. go. go early. dress nicely. turn off your phone for a few hours, let your eyes adjust to the atmosphere, relax, get to where you don't care that time is slipping by, and ENJOY yourself for once.",0.9832,0.805,0.123,0.073,0.48144257703081245
2008-08-03,5.0,"Although the name is better known for the literary reference to T.S. Eliot's text from The Fire Sermon, I think Bernard DeVoto's ode to the martini better encompasses what the Violet Hour is all about.   There is a point where the marriage of gin and vermouth is consummated. It varies a little with the constituents, but for a gin of 95 proof and a harmonious vermouth it may be generalized as about 3.7 to one. And that is not only the proper proportion but the critical one; if you use less gin it is a marriage in name only and the name is not martini. You get a drinkable and even pleasurable result, but not art's sunburst of imagined delight becoming real. Happily, the upper limit is not so fixed; you may make it four to one or a little more than that, which is a comfort if you cannot do fractions in your head and an assurance when you must use an unfamiliar gin. But not much more. This is the violet hour, the hour of hush and wonder, when the affections glow again and valor is reborn, when the shadows deepen magically along the edge of the forest and we believe that, if we watch carefully, at any moment we may see the unicorn. But it would not be a martini if we should see him. I tried the Part & Parcel, Cereja Rosa, Pimm's, and Sunburned Dane.  I thought the drinks would be stiffer, but they were all well balanced and smooth.  The smell of tequila gives me the shivers and flashbacks, but the Sundburned Dane was excellent.  If they can make cocktails this great, I may entrust Violet Hour to shift my the taste from light to dark liquor.   As far as atmosphere goes, I felt almost like I was in a colonial Plantation house with the white moldings, fireplace, and bluesy music in the background.  I have been to enough rockin' sports bars, untz untz dance clubs, and  lounges that play downtempo.  Violet Hour is definitely the type of exp I crave.  I also added a youtube link for you to get a sense of their dedication to making cocktails. youtube.com/watch?v=Le6e…",0.9952,0.839,0.149,0.012,0.5630952380952381
2008-08-03,5.0,"We actually made the very wise decision to show up at 7 here on a Saturday night because we had a big group. We got seated immediately, as it wasn't crowded yet. It took a while for my eyes to adjust to the candlelight, but when they did I was loving the high-backed chairs and cute stools, and the little square tables. I loved that the outside of the bar was deliberately nondescript, like a speakeasy should be. Big velvet curtains opened into a really tidy, modern looking but elegant space.  This is a place whose posted rules include no cellphones, no grey goose, no cosmopolitans, and nothing that ends in the word -bomb. It's a place to go for creative cocktails unlike any you can get at most establishments. It's all about the ambiance, and is a great place to go all dressed up and fabulous. There are no TVs in here. The music is quiet enough so you can talk without shouting. So basically, it's my idea of perfect. I had two $11 cocktails... a ""Julet and Romeo"" that was Beefeater, Cucumber Water, Mint, and Rosewater. It was delicious. Not a big cocktail, but amazing. I tried to savor it. I then had one that was hmmm Vodka, Grapefruit, Elderflower Liquer, and something else. My husband's cocktail had egg white and orange pekoe tea in it.  There's one back page of nibbly things. Little sandwiches and fried pickles among them. This is not a good place to show up at hungry, but it's not trying to be a restaurant.  Because we had a group of 6+ (we had more like 15) we were eligible to order drinks by the carafe for $90. I was surprised at the price until I considered how quickly the $11/each drinks add up.  Anyway, amazing cocktails.

My friend and I went on a Tuesday night and had to wait something like 35 minutes to get in -- and I do NOT wait on line to get into establishments. The little speakeasy feel of it is played out -- hello, Harry's Velvet Room was doing that almost a decade ago... I'm not going to say it was worth the wait, but I did enjoy the drinks. I like Sidecars, and I appreciate that their ingredients are fresh and in-house. But the Sidecar was a little tart, and took forever to get to the table.

First off, I kind of like the whole 'no signage' phenomenon.  I appreciate not being bombarded by advertisements from the time I reach the door until I get to the loo, and then until I leave.  It gets old.  I understand the appeal of Schlitz signs, but it does get old. I enjoyed a rather quiet (it was probably a Tuesday or Thursday) couple of drinks with my fiance.  I liked the high-backed chairs, so we were able to scoot them closer together and have it feel like a private room. I loved the drinks.  They were mixed to perfection - I didn't feel like I was drinking a ton, until I stood up (after two drinks).  They were both gorgeous tasting, and the boyfriend loved his as well. The only drawback was our waitress, who apparently graduated from The Bitch School with high honors.  She was nice enough at times, but I could tell that she wanted to be anywhere but there.  I kept waiting for the eye roll to make an appearance.  When you're serving unusual concoctions, darling, you must realize that some people like opinions and recommendations.  That should be part of your job description, a mini-sommelier for froo-froo (yet manly) drinks. I should also state that I swear that I saw several gentlemen with bottles of Red Stripe.  Perhaps there was something available under the table or they brought it in from across the street.

So I went across the street with my partner to Pontiac Cafe for some drinks outside while we waited. While we waited, we watched people entering and no one leaving as we sat outside.  Uhh, where is OUR table?  The doorman called an hour later. When my partner and I were finally seated, we realized half the bar was empty and most of the tables were empty. We were furious.  We waited that long so we ordered drinks. The drinks took another 20+ minutes to make. Again, the place was deserted.  I have never felt so insulted from poor service. It seemed very personal.",-0.9204,0.823,0.049,0.128,0.46222222222222226

2008-07-06,2.0,"I DO NOT get this place at all??? Our waiter at the restaurant we were dining at recommend a spot to go to afterwards.  We did not want a club nor a pub but were looking for something loungey and just chilled out where we could mingle and hear some cool tunes. He highly recommended Violet Hour and prefaced with ""Have you guys ever been to NYC"".  We replied with, ""We live there"" and he replied with ""I know a great spot I think you guys will really like"".  We were psyched!  Unfortunately he sent us to the wrong place.... The outside IS cool....I like the post no bills hidden doorway....fun! But then I did not get what was supposed to happen next. We were 3 ladies standing around waiting for a bouncer/host to help us out.  Some guy pushed his way in front of us and was trying to figure out if there was room for his party......room?  what do u mean room?  its a lounge it can fit you??? (this is what was running through my mind). So I stepped in and said that our party was 3.  We were told we had to wait because there was ""nothing"" available....nothing??  nothing what?????  Again, the 3 of us looked at one another in total bewilderment. While this waiting was going on we watched the people coming in and out....some people had on ripped jeans with flip flops while some men were in suits and women in dresses....then there was one dude in jean shorts, decks, and a flannel shirt??? OK????  We began listening to the music....I wanted to go back to bed.....yup it was time for lullaby central.....some slow crap which included ""lets get it on""....ok how about we get nothing on and you give me a damn drink (is what i was thinking at this point). We were loosing our buzzes by this time...... I put my hand in between the curtains and took a peek inside....ok so it looked kinda a cool....i like the blueish violet hue and the simple decor....cool times....but what I didnt like was the following: The place is big YET you HAVE to be seated.  you CAN NOT stand at the bar.....if the chairs are filled...oh well sorry just wait your turn! When it finally was our ""turn"" to go inside we were brought not to a table but to a flat square couch where we had to sit uncomfortably...we had no idea how to sit on this thing and we all had dresses on....I sort of awkwardly leaned on my side with hand pressed down on the couch...it sucked big time. It took our waitress a little bit to come over but when she did she was happy and smiley (something I do like about Chicago and its people...they are niceeeee).  We ordered 3 glasses of champagne...one was a specialty with some other alcohol in it.  When she was finished with our ordered she happily said with a huge smile: ""It will take about 10 mins for your drinks to come out""... Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh­hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh­hhhhhhhh OK???????????????? 3 glasses of champagne????  Mind you this place is not crowded!!!  there are 2 bars each staffed with 2 bartenders!!!!  This is unheard of in NYC and we crank cocktails out like no otha ALL WHILE DOING SERVICE BAR! Maybe NYC has taken over me and I expect NYC service which does not happen in the rest of the country but I'm sorry 3 glasses of champagne takes 10 mins. So we waited about 5 mins chit chatting and surveying our surroundings....and this is what we discovered: You need to be in a large group to enjoy this place No one cares how you are dressed You will wait a long time for a drink (maybe thats why its called Violet HOUR) The music BLOWSSSSSSSSSSS (I would expect from a place like this some jazz or downtempo or buddha bar...NOT MARVIN GAYE!!!!) You will be bored Anyway to finalize this we opted not to wait 10 mins for our drinks and to leave.....I rarely if ever just LEAVE!  And I felt sort of bad for the waitress but at this point we were bored out of our mindssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss So we tracked her down and my friend asked if we could cancel our order and the best part was she replied ""Oh, I think they are ready let me check""...hahahah LIEEEEEEEEE.  She had not gone back there since she had taken our order. When she came back she said no they weren't and it was not a problem to cancel it....thank you!

To get into the place, you end up feeling your way through the multiple layers of velveteen curtains that made me flash back to that scene in one of the freddy movies where the future victim is under the sheets of their bed, crawling and crawling through the sheets to try and get out of the bed but only finds freddy.  Well kind of like this anyways except at the end of the peeling back of the sheets there is a friendly hostess in the darkest room I've drank or eaten in. Was seated in the booth for the first time (well I guess thats the only place a group of 5 can sit).  This booth had the small window to the outside and as the sun went down we got to partake in the actual ""Violet Hour"".  Yet it was kind of annoying since the darkness of the place is one of its major selling points (yet at the same time an annoying point as you have to hold the menu's up to the candle light, basically setting them on fire to see anything). I try to make a point to get at least three drinks per visit (yes thats $33 clams).  One of which I usually want to be infused delitcately with Wild Turkey 101 (is there anything delicate about WT 101?  If so this is the place to get it).  No appetizers tonight, but last time I was there, they ran out of the crab cakes.  I would've gotten that fried BPJ thingy if I was givin the option.  Our group only had one drink all night that had the orange peel-fire trick performed as it was served(downer). Cool place to take friends from out of town or to experience a couple times per season as the menu changes.  Also notable, they have George Dickel whiskey for your pounding pleasure.",0.3007,0.862,0.071,0.067,0.44964157706093194
2008-05-27,5.0,"I thought this place was pretty fantastic. It's not really a place to just go knock back a couple of casual beers, but as one of my companions noted, ""This place would be the most money first-date bar ever."" Fun little adventure just to get into the bar and then really elegant setting inside. Really great drinks - I had the Spring Sazerac (stiff, apricot, delicious rye whiskey drink), the Daisy 17, and the Hemingway Daiquiri (which was pretty spectacular). The drinks are clearly made with a lot of care, using housemade bitters and other subtle ingredients. It wasn't crowded when we went (6pm on the Sunday before Memorial Day) so I don't know, but I've heard that they don't let more customers in than seats. To me, that's a big win - it seems like wall-to-wall crowds would really kill the specialness of the place.",0.9915,0.679,0.273,0.048,0.5607142857142857

2008-05-26,3.0,"When I decided to drive out to Chicago on a bit of a whim, I was pretty excited: I'd heard of this place and was keen to visit. I even tried to drag my favorite drinking companion along, as he is currently in Rochester, NY (which is right on I-90, so it was on the way! -I- thought it was logical at least). Finally, this past Thursday night I made it out here with the friend I was visiting, and I was hoping to provide him with a kickass introduction to this wacky craft-cocktail world I inhabit. We had to wait a little while, maybe 15 minutes. Totally expected, and our bouncer was very nice. I'd put in a request to be seated at the bar if possible but there was absolutely nothing available (nor for the couple of hours we were there) -- I like to interact with my bartenders and watch them work. Oh well. All the service-types were very nice, and our server was Krista who was very sweet and attentive. The ambiance: certainly a place you would come to with a group or close companion because on its own, there isn't any ambiance. The seating creates little cloistered pockets, which is great if that is what you are looking for. The space itself feels kind of empty, and I was expecting it to be more fantastical in decor based on other reviews -- again, this isn't necessarily a bad thing and again, had we managed to be seated at the bar it would likely have been a different feel to the evening. The foodstuffs: I had to try the curried Rice Krispie treats. My question: where was the curry? Does the Midwest have a thing against curry? I mean, they were yummy but I was expecting something with more of a jolt. We also had the breaded asparagus things and the waffle-cut fries and both were tasty and came out from the kitchen quickly. The drinks: ah yes, the drinks. The point, yes? I was planning on having two over the evening. For my first I went with a rye drink from the menu, the Summer Sazerac. It was wonderfully balanced, and I felt really butch with my rocks glass full o' whiskey while looking around at the other patrons with their pink things. ;) On to my second and final drink of the evening... Perhaps I am spoiled by my psychic 'tenders back home. There is a lot of communication lost when you're not interacting directly with the craftsperson creating your drink. Therefore I provided information that would be useful for a highly skilled bartender to go with in order to make me my second and final drink without having me sitting in front of him: 1. I announced my intention to have two drinks over the evening; 2. my first drink was a Sazerac (which is pretty much only rye whiskey sweetened and with bitters and an absinthe or pastis rinse); 3. I wanted some sort of rye flip for my last drink. I have heard amazing things about the bar staff at this venue and I wanted to put myself in their hands to cap off my evening. I told Krista that I don't do citrus, and I do like bitters (I mentioned that I'm a Fernet drinker). What I received: a tall glass full of what tasted like sweetened iced coffee with a slight boozy undertone, with ice and a straw. Oh, and it took forever. Granted, it was a flip and they take quite a bit of shaking to get right. But it wasn't, like, a Ramos Gin Fizz or something, and it shouldn't have taken over twenty minutes to arrive. It just... was entirely underwhelming and was nothing like what I enjoy drinking. Sure, I put myself into the bartender's hands but I gave what I thought was good information to indicate what sort of drink I'd enjoy. Krista was kind enough to take it off the bill at the end of the evening, but I still was disappointed to not have a second drink. To sum, the entire experience did not live up to my expectations (which were admittedly high).",0.9977,0.826,0.142,0.032,0.5911847250977684

There were clusters of candles and chairs whose backs reached up to the ceiling.  We were seated in a cozy yet elegant high-back booth, and enjoyed the laid-back swank of this place for the duration. After a few cocktails and sweet-treats, I found that the champagne cocktail was my favorite (well, color me predictable).  Oh yes and don't miss the peanut butter/ bacon sandwich *droooool* It's not a scene bar or a trust-fund clubhouse, although it could be if it wanted.  The no cell-phone policy pretty much filters out the people that would ruin it's intimate urban charm.  This could be a clever move for a second or third date- it's an absolute panty-dropper.   Now I've said too much. ***UPDATE*** This place now has a really long wait, and they tried to seat us at a big ottoman where we couldn't face eachother (?).  Also, do NOT order the ""americano,"" it's the only bad thing on the menu.",0.9894,0.714,0.203,0.083,0.510483870967742

I'm an out-of-towner, taken here by a friend who knows me and my joyous love of cocktails oh-so-well, so I can't say my experience was typical. But if service and/or waits are your problem let me say this: Show up at 7 p.m., or before. When we arrived at 7, there was no wait, no line, no nothing. ""But that's so early!"" you say. No. Not at all. Get a comfy table or booth, settle in, and laugh at the huddled masses crammed in the hallway and down the street. Planning on a $100 dinner after coctails? Screw it. Stay in your seat and spend that on 9 more cocktails. Seriously. I don't know how or why people need to eat when drinks this tasty are at your fingertips. I usually balk at the idea of an $11 drink, but the exceptional quality of these drinks is not to be understated. Cocktails have somehow fallen in bar culture from finely tuned and crafted masterpieces of mixology to ""bitch drinks,"" suitable only for girls who need the saccharine of juice to cover up the taste of the cheap alcohol they're chugging. No. No, no, no. Cocktails were originally genius blends of different spirits and liquers, bitters and sours, salt and sugar, fruits and herbs, mixed to evoke a season, a mood, or just a ""Mmmm!"" from the imbiber. The Violet Hour holds that standard above all else, and the cocktails you get are all the better for it. I had the ""Hush and Wonder"" and the ""Hemingway Daquiri,"" both on the Spring menu, both in the Rum section, neither of which attempted anything cloying or tropical, as so many rum drinks do. The ""Hush and Wonder"" was even BITTER (surprise, surprise, it's got bitters in it). My friend even got a whiskey drink infused with PINE. As in the tree. And it was delicious.  I'm sure you can order off-menu, and many reviewers here have mentioned custom creations from the bartender, but I don't know why you would bother straying from their seasonal selections. (Unless, that is, you've tried them all, and then, oh, how I envy you!) And if you get lip from the waiter, who cares? In the end, you get to drink your drink and they don't (at least, not until they're off), and the lip you're getting is probably annoyance and jealousy. Or maybe they just bumped their knee -- it is awfully dark in there. But to everyone and anyone who even thinks to bitch about the wait time -- cocktails are not quick drinks. The best ones are the slowest to make. It takes care, precision, attention to amount, temperature, ice, mixing, etc. to take a bunch of strong spirits and blend them into the kind of smooth and truly delicious concoctions that come from those bars.

It was simply fantastic; highly recommended. I'm definitely getting this when I go back. - ""Dark and Stormy"" - rum, lime and ginger syrup.

They're yummy. - Fried peanut butter/banana/bacon sandwich, drizzled with honey - definitely something to share with a friend, but surprisingly not as greasy or heavy as I was imagining!

2008-05-07,4.0,"Stepping into the Violet Hour is like stepping into a wayback machine.  In a good way... Back to the good era, where people didn't need to worry about what is going on with the stock market, they were just out for a good time, having a few drinks with friends. Walk in and you're in another world... Everything is dark tones, but not dark.  The chairs are very high, which gives you the feeling that you're the only table there because you can't really see a lot of the other patrons.  The music is now a nice jazzy music. The drinks are skillfully crafted to the tee, no detail left unthought of.  Their drinks are scientifically made, using the right liquors, ice, methods. The drink menu is organized by base liquor... there's a vodka, gin, tequila, sparkling, whiskey, brandy, cordials, and I'm sure I'm forgetting what other sections. All drinks here are $11 ...   If you think that's expensive, consider this....  the liquors involved are top shelf liquors.  Many of the drinks probably involve ingredients a lot of people have never even heard of these days, which is saying a lot right there.   If you want a cheap drink, go to any of the other 300 ordinary bars in the 4 block radius, don't pick on this place for doing something different.  But, ironically, the same drinks made with the same liquors at those bars would probably actually sell for more money than $11. So quit whining about that. I had the Spring Sazerac, which was a very potent sipping drink...  Of the drinks I tried, I can't actually remember the name of my favorite.  It was a reddish one that I think was named after a girl and I believe had Licor 43 in it (maybe it was the La Paloma?)?  Or did I make that up? I do want to try their Pimms Cup.  Their version has strawberry in it, which actually isn't part of a ""standard"" Pimms cup... But it sounds like a good addition (plus I don't really like cucumber, and sometimes they're too cucumbery for my liking, the strawberry would mask that I assume). ... and the Sunburned Dane??!? I mean, come on, it's name after me.. I'll have to go back and try that. I love the no cell phone policy.   If you don't, you probably don't ""get"" it.  You're also probably the one taking flash pictures across the room causing everyone to cringe.  For those of you who tote your camera along, STOP taking flash photos here.  It's annoying to some of us who are just out trying to relax.   VERY annoying. I don't know for sure, but I think the rush to this place has died down... I'm told mid-week there isn't a wait often.  I'd probably steer clear on a weekend though, unless you go expecting to wait a bit outside.

It took me a year, but it was well worth the wait. I was good at Violet Hour. I only had two drinks: The Juliet and Romeo (Beefeater, mint, cucumber, rosewater, possibly also juiced cherubim) and the Fairview Manhattan (Bulleit, pine liqueuer, Laphroaig. And let's just say if I could figure out how to eat it, smoke it, breathe it and hump it, you might never see me ever again.) I may also have had a deviled egg or two. I've already scheduled my return visit, despite the fact that it's in Wicker Park, and I don't do west side unless there is a very, very good reason--at this point, essentially Fluevs and VH. I don't see the pretension others spoke of. I mean, yeah, it's in an unmarked building that looks like a homeless squat from the outside, but that's to lend it that speakeasy flair, no? Our server was kind and charming. Last I checked, neither ""kind"" nor ""charming"" were listed in Roget's as synonyms for ""pretentious."" And, $11 for a drink is only overpriced in 2008 if you're used to drinking in bars in BFNW. Have I had cheaper cocktails? Yep. In Kalamazoo. And, they weren't nearly as tasty. The prices at VH seem pretty much cocktail standard, to me.  The bar itself is nice enough. There's no groundbreaking interior design there, but it's got a soothing, low-lit, Serge-Gainsbourg-will-be-played-at-any-minute appeal to it.

I can't afford to go here all the time, or have too many drinks, but it is an amazing place and if you are someone who is intrigued then I highly suggest coming on a random Wednesday and partaking in an experience. Also, sit at the bar. You get to see up close what a cocktail from back in the day might look like.  Other notes: Is it pretentious? Yes, but in a good way. Is it worth $11? Matter of opinion, but I think at the very least for one time it is. My bartender was also very nice and will talk to you and help you with suggestions.

Frankly, I think it is worth waiting in line to be someplace that is not ridiculously crowded.  The crowd at this place could have been annoying but I would never have known because I had plenty of room and never had to interact with anyone that I did not want to.   The music was great.  Given my druthers, I would not ahve to listen to anything recorded past 1966 while out in public.  I have a soft spot for jazz recorded in the late 20s and early 30s but also like much of  the popular music made through the 1950s and into the early 1960s.  What they were playing at Violet Hour was, therefore, right up my alley. The interior was attractive.  Instead of opting for the dark interior you find in most drinking establishments, the walls are cheerfully painted a light color that could be blue or purple (I could not tell) with white trim.  The large chairs were neat and I even liked the big square bar stools.  The long, dark curtains were dramatic but they were balanced by the lighter colors. Since we were seated at the bar, we got to watch the bartenders.  They looked pretty nifty with their vests and arm garters.  Heck, so did the barbacks.  I really enjoyed watching them make drinks.  I don't know that I would go so far as to call what they do an art, but it is certainly a craft.   The drinks themselves were amazingly good.  I had two drinks and loved them both.  My cousin had one and it was a bit too sweet.   Since it's hard to know what the drinks might taste like unless you are a mixologist and familiar with all of the ingredients, I would recommend asking for suggestions based on your likes.   I asked our bartender Troy for a suggestion with the caveat that I do not like gin.  He responded buy asking if he could make me a gin drink that he would happily take back if I were dissatisfied.  That drink, one of his own creations he called the Mademoiselle, completely changed my views of gin.  I loved it.  His second recommendation was also solid. The drinks were $11 a piece but I think that given the quality, this is more than reasonable.  I was a little tipsy after 2 drinks (which is rare for me) but I did not think that the drinks tasted too strong at all.    All in all, this was a singular experience.  Me likey!",0.9985,0.781,0.2,0.019,0.555150631681244

The feeling is lush, dark, and seductive, and so are the drinks. Every cocktail was superior, and completely unusual. The music selection was phenomenal.

All of it can go right in the harbor and out to sea.  You're dicks and I hate you.

How unbelievably surprising, then, to find out all of that uppity nonsense is actually worth it.  This is one of the only bars I have ever been in, be it New York, Philadelphia, Boston or elsewhere, where the quality of service, style and selection makes the curtain and the doorman and the rest of it make sense. It's set up like a speakeasy, hence the little yellow light and the lack of signage, not to mention the bartenders (who happen to be highly trained mixologists and genuinely good people) in their arm suspenders and steamboat attire serving some of the most inventive and delicious cocktails that more than merit their $11 (not $15) price tags.  The decor is somehow perfect, in powder blue and white no less, and it's appropriately dim, which I love. The ambience is subdued but not awkward, and it's very intimate due to the high-backed chairs/booths.  It isn't meant for mingling.  If you have three or four friends you enjoy talking to, actually talking to, rather than just getting sloppy and licking, you can't ask for a better bar to spend an evening getting good and tipsy and sharing drinks in. I've been here several times now, and each time I leave still surprised by how much it justifies its pompous approach.  When people complain about the Violet Hour, I can only assume they think it is going to be just another bar on the Wicker Park/Uki Village circuit and can't understand the wait/curtain/etc. All it takes is one trip inside and you'll get it.   Admittedly, it's pricey, but if you actually get what you pay for, who cares?",0.973,0.836,0.105,0.06,0.5409821762599542

After getting a drink you like I would recommend getting two or three different things, chances are they will be delicious.

I would also recomend sitting at the bar when it's not busy because the bartenders are nice and not that pretentious when it comes to drinks...  I guess the one problem with Violet Hour is that if you are expecting a normal bar you will be disappointed. Bartenders are kinda snobby here and seem to make faces about even using Vodka in drinks.

2008-01-30,4.0,"Before moving to St. Louis, I had a dream about Violet Hour.  I dreamed that their cocktail menu was like, 10 pages long because each drink had a lengthy discussion of their ingredients and such.  All except ""Pimm's Cup"" (which I believe Andrea W. mentioned in her review from quite some time ago).  Anyway, all of the drinks had these mammoth descriptions and then Pimm's Cup just said ""Punch"" next to it.  And of course I ordered it because Andrea W. said it was good.  I also dreamed that we had some appetizer that appeared to be worms.  Very bizarre, I know. I am happy to report that there are no worms on Violet Hour's food menu and that the cocktail list is much more condensed than I had imagined in dreamland.  I generally don't enjoy rum cocktails, but was tempted by one including creme de violete, I believe.  I can't remember what it was called, but it was delicious, as was the maple nut eggnog, which I ordered solely to be able to say I had a drink with a WHOLE RAW EGG in it.  That makes me proud for some odd reason. Justin enjoyed his gin drink, thought the custom-made ice cube was pretty cool and really enjoyed himself.  We went at about 8pm on a Wednesday, so had absolutely no trouble with lines and were content to sit in the darkened place sipping our masterfully-constructed cocktails and listening to what I thought was my stolen iPod (Zero 7, Radiohead, Neil Young, Portishead, Miles Davis and a variety of other fun odds and ends).  Our server was as sweet as could be, the drinks were really well-crafted, unique and delicious (a tad on the pricey side, but that's quality, I guess) and the consensus is we'll be back when we head back home to Chicago. Oh, and as for Pimm's Cup being just ""punch"", I have no idea if that's true because it wasn't on the menu when we visited Violet Hour.  Crazy dreams...  I do hope they keep that rum cocktail around though--what a tasty treat!",0.9888,0.783,0.151,0.066,0.5547179487179487

2008-01-07,4.0,"I have mixed feelings about this place they call Violet Hour. I was there last Saturday night to celebrate my friend   catb.yelp.com  's engagement to my main wing man Allen.  The cab pulls up to Violet Hour and I didn't know if I had the right address. There were no signs outside and it looked like a boarded up warehouse, graffiti and all. At 9:00pm there were already people forming a line out the door. Our party had a reservation so I skipped to the front and avoided the line. I felt like Paris Hilton as I wisted by all the people in line. They all gave us dagger eyes, which was great. Once inside you are greeted by a well dressed, remarkably polite door guard. Then you're escorted to a table or section by a separate hostess. You truly feel like a rock star because it is exclusive, dark, and very sexy. The decor is intentionally plain and calming. There are huge velvet drapes separating the rooms, large antique chandeliers dimly lit, and very plain sky blue walls. The bar is long and stretched between two velvet curtain rooms. They have a nice fireplace that we were lucky to have been seated next to. It did get a bit toasty though as it is a real fireplace.... No, that can't be right because I do not remember anyone throwing wood on the fire so never mind. All I remember is that it was raging. Now here is how they get you... to get a table you have to order a carafe of something much like bottle service at other classy clubs. The carafes are concoctions of all sorts of tasty juices and strange booze you have never heard of. All the drinks are on menus with fancy fonts, and are very ""martini"" like in taste and strength of alcohol (you are going to feel it in the morning!). I on the other hand am the asshole who asks the waitress for a Miller Light. She was very polite and instead brought me some weird $11.00 beer in a bottle. I had many weird $11.00 beers in a bottle while downing the carafes of jungle juice. Not much else to say about this place. Will I go back? Probably not only because I know if I do I would have to wait in a line and I have  a ""no waiting outside a stupid club"" policy. There are way to many bars and nightclubs in the city of Chicago to wait in a line, especially in the robust neighborhood of Wicker Park. Everyone says that Violet Hour is pretentious but I did not get the vibe. I had a blast and so did all the people in our group. The bill was out of control but what to you expect when you have a large party all ordering stupid $90.00 carafes of fruit juice and hooch. ***There was this one thing that happened though- as my friends were settling up the tab I snuck up to the bar to get one last beer. The male bartender gets me another weird $11.00 beer in a bottle. I slap down a $20.00 bill and stand there waiting for the change. This balding, old, and unattractive bartender passes by the $20.00 three times before picking it up, making change and slapping it down on the bar. He did it accompanied by a disgusted look of disappointment that I would DARE ask for change. Did this guy actually think I was going to give him a $9.00 tip for a single beer? For this old ass balding dude who was dressed stupid to get a $9.00 tip I not only want a beer, but my car washed. I woke up remembering him in the morning, feeling I might owe him an apology however. I was very liquored up at this point in the evening and can vaguely remember making fun of him a bit, even attracting a small audience of bar patrons laughing at my jokes. Maybe they had been treated the same way, and was just waiting for the right person to be embarrassingly inappropriate. That person is I.

You walk in and there is a foyer where you wait in front of lush blue velvet drapes for someone to peek out and invite you in.  It makes you feel like you are in the days of prohibition.  I felt like I should be in a flapper dress with a long cigarette holder. Then you walk in.  It is draped in velvet and the blue hue of the room is amazing.   You are seated by a hostess and all of the tables are lit with little oil candles that give each table an intimate and private feel, even though the room is large.  You really feel like you have stepped back in time with the style of this place.

I mean, I've seen Swingers, I live in LA, I know that no good bar actually has a sign identifying it. The problem here is that everyone seems to know where Violet Hour is regardless.  My friends and I ventured to Violet Hour around 11PM on a blustery Saturday night. I know that the doorman used to take down your number and call you up when a table became available, but that practice seemed to be totally MIA on this evening, so we waited....in line........ for almost an hour.  Yup! My friends wouldn't shut up about how great the place was though, so we stayed, and we waited and it somehow became the most awkward social experiment I've ever witnessed. Imagine a group of about 30 people, all standing in a hallway with nothing to stare at but each other and the splotchy drywall of the bar's entrance. Now imagine other people who repeatedly open (and then hold ajar) the door to the outside, letting in the freezing cold Chicago-in-December night air. Now guess how everyone inside responded? By yelling and getting super-hostile? Yup, that was about it. Add in people who somehow managed to stroll right past the line while ignoring the bitchy and combative comments coming from all the people who were waiting and you basically have the story of that hour of my life. It was horrible, really, like some weird prison psych experiment to see how long it would take everyone to turn on one another. I swear, things were about to get cannibalistic in that place!  Once inside, the atmosphere was cute, and I loved the table we got right next to the cozy fireplace. Although, the lack of dress code enforcement was a little distracting (plaid flannel shirts and old dirty new balance with dad jeans, really?????).  The drinks though, are entirely what earned all 4 of these little stars. My friends and I made sure to order different drinks each round and passed to the right so we all got to experience everything.

Why get one $10 cocktail when you could get five $2 beers at the local dive? While I love my dives, VH is an entirely different animal, and for me, an animal well worth a $20 bill. Everything about VH is class and style, from the velvety curtains to the high-backed chairs; from the drinks teeming with theatrics (flaming beverages, anyone?) to the top notch service.  Drinks are, indeed, pricey, but they are delicious, and the care that goes into each drink by the expertly-trained bartenders is evident. When I first read about the Lady Grey, with egg whites blended in, I balked, but my oh my, if that's not the most delicious cocktail I have ever had I don't know what is. In the end, it's an expensive night out, especially for Chicago standards. But when you're treated so well, in a place so posh, with drinks so divine, you won't find me complaining.",0.9888,0.803,0.197,0.0,0.47604166666666664

You may or may not appreciate the decor, and who could appreciate the ""give us your cell number, we MAY call you back"" waiting list, but the drinks are some of the best I've ever had. To give you an idea of the sort of cocktail we're talking about, take the delicious Chi-Town Flip: Buffalo Trace Bourbon, Dow's Tawny Port, Whole Egg, and Fee's Old Fashioned Bitters shaken to milkshake consistency and served in a highball glass. If that sounds too rich, there's the classic, reliable Corpse Reviver #2: Bombay Dry Gin, Lillet, Curacao, and Absente. Finally, there's my favorite, the Autumn Sazerac: Old Overholt Rye Whiskey, Berentzen Apflekorn, Herbsainte, and Peychaud's Bitters. If those drinks don't excite you, you still might appreciate the dark, candlelit, windowless Speakeasy atmosphere, with custom-made, high-back booths. The man standing outside the boarded up storefront, sporting a suit, sunglasses, clipboard, and Secret Service-style earpiece, taking phone numbers for the waiting list, may enhance your feeling of exclusivity. These things were fun for me the first time, but I can imagine them getting tiresome, especially if it's common not to be called back and having to check back later.

Now what I don't like: Speakeasy? Que? Come on, you're not that cool. Prohibition ended in what 1933? Why are they playing soft 50s and 60s music and marketing a sandwich as Elvis's favorite? Every third bartender or so had a striped shirt and suspenders on reminiscient of a poor vaudeville getup, but it wasn't across the board and they didn't match so it didn't quite work. If they really want to come off as a speakeasy themed bar, they have some adjustments to make. As far as the quiet relaxing factor - I suppose this is a nice change of pace from the typical Chicago bar, but I have to admit, I grew somewhat bored after the second drink and wanted some audio or visual stimulation. It was also sooo dark in the back room I could barely make out the people 5 feet away from us. Maybe you're not supposed to stay much longer than a drink or two?

NEVERMIND....

My friend looks up horrified and apologizes saying that she was so confused and really thought that her foot was part of the barstool - and really, who the hell puts their feet completely up on bar stools in a place like VH? At that point, nothing could have been more hilarious - especially because the woman was not at all pleased or amused... shocking because the hilarity of the situation was overwhelming and there was nothing the 3 of us could do to hide our laughter.

I am from LA and I cry if it's 50, so imagine the inner tears and shivers), I didn't really know what to expect. Our lovely CM tour guide, Andrea W, had said that it was cool, but she didn't say it was THIS cool!

Once he clears you, you walk into some of the heaviest and thickest curtains known to man. Luckily for us, we were strong drinkers and were able to push our way through to...sheer libation awesomeness. Dark, intimate lighting. Sleek designs. Absolute charm. A true win win. We were then seated at our booth and started looking over the menus. As soon as I saw drinks with things like egg whites and bitters, I was excited.  We then met our server for the night (her name escapes me, but she is totally adorable and was wearing one of the coolest vintage dresses ever! Seriously, I had to fight the urge to not throw down and claim that dress as my own!!).

After about 10 minutes we were seated in the back salon right next to the fire. Overall the atmosphere was different and cool and I liked how dark it was in there. Very moody. It felt very swank but not pretentious.  The first thing I noticed about the drink menu was that I had NO IDEA what 95% of the ingredients listed were. Our waitress promptly helped us and gave us some much needed suggestions. She also informed us that the drinks would take about 10 minutes, which they did.  I had two drinks - Hotel National and a drink who's name I cannot remember but the waitress said it tasted like a cherry milkshake (SOLD!). Both were good especially the milkshakey one. It was made with egg yolk which sounds weird but it was good. It wasn't creamy really but it really did have a milkshake flavor. My friend had an Amaretto Fizz which was good and then a Stingy Brim which was flavored like tiramisu. We both agreed that one was an orgasm in a glass.

I watched him use about 10 different tools to make just 1 drink and just had to inquire if the guy went to med school for all this. Those are some serious drinks!  But Kirk isn't the only talented bartender in this lounge- the bartender next to us was lighting a girl's drink on fire! You definitely don't see this at English and some of the other current popular bars around town! We ordered a few delicious appetizers to go with our drinks (my drinks being the Pimms Cup and the Hotel Nacional- both suburb!).  Everything on the menu looked scrumptious and so creative- you don't fried peanut butter and bacon paired together very often!  While peanut butter and bacon sounded interesting we opted for the duck meatballs, paninis and some type of pancakes instead.  They were all good, but the duck meatballs won the prize for the night! My one request for Violet Hour would be to provide small plates (& maybe even some silverware) for these appetizers- that was one big meatball I stuffed into my mouth!

There is a distinct electricity in the air and this place just makes me feel special. You really know how to WOW a girl... Momma taught you well.   Girls like a guy who can take their time, so I also appreciate the aspect of your controlled entrance.... the drinks are painstaking long to mix and having the bartenders overwhelmed by throngs of people trying to get their trendy sidecar consumption on just makes things slow and aggravating for the rest of us.

I do think some of the cocktails are quite good and some of them just have too much stuff inside of them.  I don't know if they really imported a professional mixologist from NY to design the cocktail menu or not but it makes no difference to me as I am a vodka soda girl or a perfect Manhattan girl.  Not into fancy stuff or sweet stuff in my drinks but I am sure others can appreciate it.

I first learned about the Violet Hour from a friend of one of the owners, and being a T.S. Eliot fan as much as a fan of the Prohibition era style, I admit I was more than intrigued by the inspiration of this lovely lounge. The mystique was enhanced once I set foot through the somewhat hidden door. And then there were the cocktails... Each time I've brought someone new to the Violet Hour I almost feel as if I am entering for the first time all over again. The setting is intimate yet engaging, and I highly recommend sitting at the bar. Talk to your bartender's - they know their stuff, and each went through 2 weeks of cocktail training before the VH opened. The NY Mixologist they invested in was definitely worth every penny - these old-fashioned cocktails not only hit the mark on ""the real thing"" they are so far the best I've had in this city. The ice block (not cubes) is triple-filtered and designed not to melt your diligently mixed glass of goodness, and the frothed egg white is a fantastic touch to the martini-style cocktails (don't worry, what doesn't fit in the tiny old-fashioned martini glass politely waits in the sidecar). I haven't tried the food yet, but the menu is small plates with complimenting yet unique ingredients.  Perfect for an after-dinner cocktail or evening topper, impressive for a first date you want to wow, and ideal for intimate conversation with your date, whether it be an evening out with a friend or romantic prospect. Expect to pay $11 per drink, but it will be worth every penny. Also try to go during the week if you want your pick of seating - I personally enjoy sitting at the bar, but the extreme highback chairs and booths are also enticing.  Generally, I've enjoyed the music played, but I can't help but feel that Duke Ellington, Cole Porter, or the Gershwin brothers would be more nostalgic to the theme.",0.9967,0.781,0.2,0.019,0.5661399711399712

Update: I am removing one star for my visit there on 12/26/07.  The waitress kept giving us attitude a plenty and seemed quite annoyed with us, for what reason we have no idea.  The 3 of us ordered two drinks each and some food, and we weren't trying to stay forever (we would have paid the check if she had brought it at anytime).  The two drinks I chose this time, the el diablo and the airmail, were good but not wowing.   The bartender, however, was very helpful when I asked him various questions.  Also, they were out of the fried banana/pb/bacon treat, so I was bummed.  We had sammies (olive with goat cheese, prosciutto with fig and mint, and crimini with (ricotta?) cheese, which were only okay, and the potato blini with creme fraiche and horseradish caviar which I enjoyed very much.  There were a few other drinks I wanted to try, and the menu changes, so I would still go back to try more cocktails (and hopefully the PB sandwich), but I would sit in a different section to avoid that server.  Hopefully they will earn that 5th star back.",0.9991,0.717,0.247,0.037,0.5255208333333335

My first impression was that it was way pretentious. Too dark, the music was worst than spa music and nobody was talking. I thought I made a wrong turn somewhere and walked into a morgue.  We made our way past the long drapes and into the back bar where we found enough seats at the bar for all of us. The bar seats could fit two people on them...easy (that was kinda nice). The bartender greeted us promptly. He was cordial. He was informative. The drinks were very tasty. It did take a bit of time to make six drinks.

2007-10-22,5.0,"The name ""Violet Hour"" implies to me a hazy dream-like time of wonder and possibility. And the bar pretty much lived up to that expectattion.  Had we not gone with someone who'd been there before, I think we would have walked back and forth in front of the door several times before realizing the blue boarded up wall was actually it.  Once inside I was struck by 3 things -  1) wow this is dark 2) wow this is quiet 3) those are some cool ass chairs We sat at the bar for our first drink and it was definately worth it to watch the bartenders work their magic. Eggs, nutmeg shavings, flame, bitters, sugar cubes - all of these ingredients, and many more I have never heard of, are fair game.  We then moved over to our own little table and took a seat in the Alice in Wonderland chairs. Immediately I felt like we were the only people in the bar. Everyone else faded into the background. The few other patrons that I could see ranged from an older couple sharing drinks in the back, to a group of 20-something girls in short-shorts and miniskirts at the bar. We were a group of 5 and they were easily able to accomodate us.  The darkness and quiet made for a romantic surreal feeling, though it did make it difficult to make out the drink menu without a flashlight. You can easily hear your companions and enjoy the modern jazz music. If you have a louder person in your group  you may feel self conscious - their voice will carry across the whole place.  As for the drinks, I can only say WOW.  Worth every penny of the $11, for the taste, the quality, and the artistry that the bartenders put into them. I started with a Rio Jockey Club with champagne and bitters. It was quite good, and a good way for me ( a margarita is an adventurous cocktail for me) to ease into things. My husband had a drink that consisted of bourbon, egg, and numeg shavings (and other things I can't remember) and was fantastic. Creamy with a hint of nutmeg, it was reminiscent of egg nogg . I said it tasted like Christmas.  Every drink we had that night was fantastic, with the exception of my husband's Dark and Stormy - it was a bit too heavy on the ginger syrup. My favorite of the night was the Red Moon Fizz - another concoction made creamy with egg white. We all had a great time passing drinks around, trying each other's libations.  The service was very good - the bartenders are more like drink chefs. The cocktail server we had was very attentive without being instrusive, but I was dissapointed that she often wasn't sure what went in each drink. I really hope that a large portion of the tip we left her went to the bartenders.  Between my husband and I we had 7 drinks, so its not the kind of place we can afford to come every weekend. But when I want an evening of atmosphere, conversation, and amazing cocktails, then there's no other place I'd rather go.",0.9894,0.855,0.118,0.027,0.5433730158730158
2007-10-21,4.0,"The Violet Hour takes it's name from a TS Eliot poem that describes that fleeting moment between dusk and dark.  And that light or lack thereof is captured in this lounge perfectly.  Suffice it to say- it is dark in there! Upon entering the Violet Hour you will feel that you are transported into a chapter of Alice in Wonderland.  ""Curiouser and Curiouser"" you mutter as you look around this blue space with square over sized chairs with backs as tall as a person all intimately grouped around tiny little tables. Large billowy curtains separate the space into intimate gathering areas. You'll be enticed like Alice to drink potions so interesting that they don't need a ""Drink Me"" tag like in the Wonderland tale. Master mixologists combine unusual ingredients to make unusual drinks with names like Hummingbird, Hemingway or any number of layered, frothed concoctions that your tablemates will marvel over and you will share a sip just so you can talk about the combination of flavors. The ice alone is masterful.  So as to not water down certain drinks with cubes melting- many of the drinks come with one large rectangle of ice that fills the glass and becomes invisible in the drink. Signature cocktails are pricey ($11) and a standard drink runs about $7. This is a great date place or for when you just want to relax with friends over a cocktail.  I'd suggest it as a start to your evening.  We got here at 8 and there was no line.  But since they do limit entrance (someone told me that 60 people was the maximum) so that everyone has the same experience, by the time we left around 10- there was a line to get in.  Another plus- no smoking and no cell phone usage allowed.

The staff. It takes on average 10-15 minutes to get two drinks. Are you kidding me? Oh but the mixology and the finely crafted oils, bitters, and syrups; it all takes time.  Yeah- I'm not buying it.  Three out of the five times I've been there it seems like our bartender is tweaked out of his mind, all twitchy and shaky, dropping glasses, jiggers, and bar spoons- very unprofessional.  That being said- the drinks are pretty good, not the best I've ever had but good. Try the bar at Sepia for classic cocktails and a much better atmosphere. Update:  I've had quite a few people message me about my review.  These people think I have some grudge against the Violet Hour.  The fact is, I don't have a grudge against the Violet Hour, if I did would I have been there five times for their $11 drinks? I appreciate what they do there.  I don't appreciate that I have to wait so long for a drink. The first time I was there was the week it opened it took the bartender 15 minutes to even acknowledge that we were sitting in front of him. It then took another 15-20 minutes to get our drink. Our bartender that night wasn't engaging at all. He wasn't talkative, he didn't offer any history behind the drinks, he didn't sell it. In a bar like this you're going there for an experience. Bartenders from that era were true entertainers. They were larger than life, not just some schlep slinging suds.  If you're going to open a bar like this and control who comes in, where they sit, etc go the whole nine yards. It starts at your bartenders and works all the way down from the wait staff to the hostess.  I chalked this up to them having just opened. So I came back.  On trip number two we sat at the bar. Twitchy was our bartender this time and he was great. Hands down, knew his shit, sat and talked with us for a long time even while he was mixing other drinks. I don't mind waiting the 15 minutes for my drink if the bartender is standing there talking about the drink, what's in it, how it's made, origins, etc. It was a great experience. I knew I would be back.  One week later we returned. We had the same bartender, but tonight he seemed off. He didn't know who we were yet less than a week prior we had an hour and half conversation about the effects of prohibition on American distilleries.  He was edgy, shaky, and just seemed like he was tweaked out.  He wasn't engaging, he took forever to mix drinks, it was just a completely different experience. We were admiring the ice in the glasses; they're perfectly square and crystal clear. We asked him what kind of machine they used for their ice and he refused to tell us!  Are you kidding me? It's ice. Whatever- maybe the guy is just having an off night.  We'll be back again since we love classic cocktails.  Trip number 4 came a week or two later and it was just as bad. I returned one more time just because a friend of mine had heard about it and wanted to check it out. I said fine, but for one drink only. And as it turned out, twitchy was our bartender and that was the night he was dropping spoons, throwing jiggers, and just basically didn't have his act together.  Bottom line- I respect what they do at the Violet Hour. I would respect it a lot more if they cleaned house with some of their staff. I would respect them a lot more if they had more bartenders and got drinks out faster. I would respect them a lot more if they took the speakeasy theme and really ran with it.  This is a concept bar and it has finally given cocktail culture in Chicago some much needed press.  But I'm afraid that unless they get their act together and become a place where people keep coming back to rather than a ""yeah- it's something you should check out"" type of place; they won't survive. People in Chicago won't stand to wait around for their drinks, and it's a shame because they make such fine cocktails here.",0.9968,0.818,0.131,0.051,0.45070546737213407

It's the direct opposite of a Wrigleyville sports bar, and is more reminiscent of a speakeasy than anything else I can think of. The man at the door who checks ID has a really hushed voice, and when he tells you the two rules (cell phones off, and no smoking), it sounds like he's briefing you on a spy mission. The entrance itself is rather secretive-looking. There are wooden boards on the front, with what appears to be the standard ""post no bills"" stencil spraypainted on, but actually says ""post no ILLS."" It makes me smile. Once you're inside, it's dark. Quite dark. There are very tall, wide chairs, clustered together in twos, and little tables with votive candles. Intimate and lounge-y? You bet. The menus are on single pages of parchment-like paper, and everything looks delicious and wonderful. They've got their mixology down. I ordered the delightful concoction known as the ""Daisy 17"" - Wild Turkey, house-made grenadine, and orange bitters. When the waitress brings that particular drink over, you get a little pyrotechnic show for your garnish.  The bartenders are well-dressed and precise. Every one of them wears a fabulous tie and mixes chemistry-set cocktails like he was born knowing how. My favorite cocktail is the ""Iron Cross"" because one of the ingredients is Pisco (a Chilean brandy) and I'm floored that they have that. It's not a drink for everyone - there are raw eggwhites in it - but I find it delightful. VH used to get 5 stars from me, but the magic has worn off a bit.

The interior has been described as ""Alice in Wonderland""-ish...sure I'll go with that. The drinks are spectacular, but as the Prohibition era cocktail thing is just being rediscovered in Chicago, the drink menu does not nearly have the breadth and the bartenders are not quite as virtuosic as their counterparts in New York. Needless to say, I'll give the guys some slack, they're still in training, and they have been trained well. In a few months I'm sure the products of their cocktail shakers will be as smooth as sounds from Coltrane's sax. My favorite drinks are the Whiskey Smash and the Gold Rush (not on the menu, ask Tobey to make it for you if he's around). One major problem I have with this place is that, unlike Milk and Honey, you can't call ahead to make reservations; instead of a ""secret phone number"" there is no phone number at all....cute. As a warning, this isn't a pick up joint, or a slammed crazy bar, but rather a place to enjoy a great cocktail... with a side of conversation.",0.9274,0.805,0.13,0.065,0.7421717171717173

I had a drink from the rum list with Pisco and an egg, and the egg lended a nice foam and flavor to the concoction.  Both the servers and bartenders have bartender training to understand and explain any of the drinks, and they are friendly and willing to answer any questions you have. They even made a drink for my friend who wasn't drinking alocohol that night.  We also tried the curry rice crispy treats with spiced nuts and homeade herb crackers on the side.  Very different and tasty.

I showed up at about 8:30 for a few drinks with friends, and didn't have to wait in line, though there was a 20+ person line when I left two hours later.  The entire time I was there, the place was open and not at all crowded.  Huge bonus to them for not packing the place and thereby ruining the atmosphere. The space was huge and airy, yet at the same time really intimate.  I never got a whiff of pretension from anyone, especially not the girl at the door checking IDs.  She was without a doubt the friendliest ID-checker-person I've come across.  Waitresses were the same way, and were good about making sure we understood that the drinks take a while to make. The drinks themselves were all really interesting and tasty too.  Nothing watered-down, nothing bland, and nothing extraneous.  I was impressed by the creativity and surprised by how good the drinks were.  It's easy to be intimidated, but try something crazy and you won't regret it.  My favorite involved Laphroig in some context... I think it was a Cognac base. While this isn't a place I would go to regularly, it does a perfect job of being what it is, and I will always be happy to go back.",0.9931,0.711,0.228,0.062,0.601982021809608

2007-08-05,5.0,"I completely love the atmosphere of this place. I went with a girlfriend of mine, and we were mesmerized at the drink making skills of the bartenders. The drinks were to die for - very yummy. The appetizers were very good, just the selection is a bit eclectic and on the bizarre side- try fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches (which do taste pretty good with a dark & stormy drink). The blue walls, the seating, and everything else is pretty cool, there is no smoking or cell phones, and it is actually the perfect place for a romantic start to an evening, as the lighting and decor sets a great mood for romance. I do recommend this place more for a date night rather than for a girl's night out, but we had a great time there just chatting as the music is not too loud like in most other bars.

There isn't really a line outside not b/c you'll automatically be granted entry, but because they'll take your name + number and call you when there is space available. We gave them our info and waited by the phone with bated breath. They called. It was worth it. Highly recommended: Dark & Stormy (ginger!), El Diablo (ginger + spice!), Golden Age (subtle and delicious), Iron Cross (perfumy loveliness), Hotel Nacional (beachy), Southside (classic gin drink),  Amaretto Fizz (dessert)  The drinks are phenomenal. They take an artesian approach, concocting their own grenadine and whatnot. Our ex-bartending friend agrees that the drinks are deeeeelicious. Ahh, LOVE!  milk and honey of nyc fame comes to chicago.

2007-06-28,4.0,"Attended the opening night tonight. Great presentation at the entrance, reminded me a bit of Sonotech. My friend, who is a serious mixologist, highly approved of all of the cocktails that were served. Obviously they have to work out some kinks being their first night. But it worked for me, for the most part. The pros: The drinks--different, awesome, 11 bucks, after a few you may be ""like a patient/etherized upon a table"". The food-my friends ate, I did not, they thought it was good. The service--was friendly, and they are really working hard to perfect every drink which showed.  The room--very well done (what I could see of it!) The no smoking, no cell phone policy. The name--based on a line from TS Eliot. If you don't know who that is,   do a little google before you go--your friends will think you are a smarty pants.  The cons: It is DARK. Really dark. So dark, I was kind of afraid that one of the servers was going to trip over something.  The seating--other than the bar, the seating is comprised mostly of booths that can sit six thin people relatively uncomfortably. There is some group seating in the back room but my spidey sense tells me that this area may at some point become VIP which means that you are SOL if you come with more than a few buddies.  Jury's still out on: The music. The choices seemed just a little random to me, though I will take Leonard Cohen and the Stones over many things, so I'm not really complaining. Also, there is no sign or indication that the place is there. Which is cool in theory, though it also means that you are going to have a lot of cell phone conversations trying to explain to your confused friends where it is. Great art always involves some suffering, no?  But overall, I'd say the place works well--something quite dramatic in what has become an increasingly bland neighborhood. The cocktails are really works of art in their own right, and I appreciate that. Will likely be overrun soon enough so get there while the getting's good!",0.9859,0.811,0.137,0.052,0.5548954703832752
2007-06-28,5.0,"""I feel like I am in Marie Antoinette"" I think I heard about 4 people say that last night in this place. Wow, what an amazing idea...someone is very creative in finding niches of nightlife that have not been filled in Chicago.  I feel a bit strange writing a review of this place, as the theme is definitely ""Speakeasy-esque"" But, it's bound to happen eventually. Last night I was incredibly lucky to be invited to the 'run through' pre-opening of The Violet Hour. You walk in and can barely believe that this space housed Del Torro, as it has been completely transformed into something straight out of a different era.  It is  dark with huge sweeping velvet curtains splitting the room into two parts, tall velvety looking chairs allowing the tables to be totally private, and a super long bar stretching the length of the whole restaurant. The Drinks! oh the drinks.... There is a menu with probably about 20 very special cocktails, all in original form...INCREDIBLE!!!! Apparently the bartenders studied and trained for weeks learning about the obscure ingredients and mixes under a fellow from New York (whom we met and was full of intriguing information). All cocktails are $11.00.  Which is pricey, but once you have watched the concoction mixed you'll understand why. You must come with a patience, because this ain't no Rainbo Club ... It takes a good couple minutes to make each cocktail, but it's fun to watch so whatever. I worry about when it gets really crowded, and wonder if they will need 10 bartenders behind the bar.  Last night it seemed there were about 6! I had 3 drinks, and so did my husband (yeah we walked out pretty tipsy) - My favorite...the Daiquiri and Champagne Cocktail (with homemade bitters).  I joked with the bartender and asked if I was being girly ordering the Daiquiri, and he said no and told me the history of it and how it's actually a classic cocktail, and some other stuff that I of course can't recall now.  Quirks need to be worked out, but I can't help giving it 5 stars, as it's such an awesome concept and even though it's pricey - I think it will be difficult not to stop by here a lot in the future.  Definitely definitely check it out! It opens tonight!! (6.28.07)",0.9916,0.817,0.148,0.035,0.5125402375402376
