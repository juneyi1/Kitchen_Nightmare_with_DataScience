I also got some corn chowder which was equally tasty and warm and real delicious with the sandwich.  There's not a ton of seating here and the seating they have is cramped.

2017-03-19,3.0,"Like the sandwiches, dislike the portion size. The sandwich fillings here are actually pretty good, and my personal favorite is the Sergio special, which is a delicious mix of freshly cut French ham, gruyere, avocado, sliced jalapenos, and mango chutney. Have also enjoyed the free-range chicken + avocado, as well as the Italian prosciutto di parma, the latter of which was more unique given the white truffle goat cheese which added a savory creaminess to the dish. If anything I'd say that the coldcut sandwiches are the best bets as they generally have pretty fresh charcuterie. Their namesake bretzels are as you'd imagine; to be honest I don't think they add all that much to the sandwich or sub. I do enjoy pretzel buns, though more so on a juicy burger where they can absorb the fat and flavor than on anything else. But as to my main issue, the size of the sandwiches for the price. You can get a Wecken, which is a normally circular sandwich, or a baguette. If you think a wecken is enough to fill you up, you're sorely mistaken. They're basically each the size of a small finger sandwich that you'd get in a tray at Jewel-Osco. Or half-way between slider and a real sandwich. For $6-7 you'd expect something a little more substantial. Which you can get if you an order a baguette, which will probably run you around $9-10. Ultimately they are still on the smaller side(a $10 baguette here is still half the size of a subway sandwich), but if you're ok with that or if you're getting company catering, they are fairly tasty.",0.9607,0.87,0.111,0.019,0.536326530612245

We both ordered breakfast sandwiches, mine veggie with avocado, my boyfriend's a ""loaded"" breakfast sandwich.  They forgot the avocado on mine, which didn't matter because the sandwich was unsalvageable anyway.  It was a watery congealed slop of egg and veggies topped with a hopeful bit of cheese, all on a whole wheat bun doing its best cardboard impression. With each bite, more egg/veggie water dripped out of the sandwich.  The cheese barely registered to add a bit of flavor to this monstrosity.

My only complaint is that I've tried ordering a ham and cheese sandwich two different ways, because that's really what I prefer -- both as a Sergio's special but with just the ham and cheese (no avocado, mango chutney, or jalapenos), and as just a ham and cheese sandwich -- and I've gotten various prices.

They have the best donuts that are GF that you can imagine. Flavors alternate but include maple glazed bacon, Pistachio, Chocolate, carrot cake and plain w/ cinnamon.  Mity Nice: Awesome GF hamburgers with in house made buns and free GF dinner rolls when you sit down. Also try the house made GF cookies for dessert ~ Served warm with vanilla ice cream. Big Bowl: Great GF Pad Thai and Kung Pao Chicken. Dedicated GF menu and knowledgeable staff.  Lou Malnati's: So we haven't found a true GF deep dish in the city but this is pretty close. This place serves a deep dish pizza that instead of dough for crust they utilize a thin layer of Italian sausage for the crust. My wife isn't a big meat eater but loves this pie. They also serve a great thin crust GF pizza that is tasty as well.  Sunda: Although this place can get a little pricy they are worth every penny. The service is great and the GF menu is extensive. Featuring both GF sushi and Asian selections. The service and atmosphere are excellent as well.  Hoppin Hots: This is a great hot dog place that features amazing hot dogs with GF buns. The fries are amazing as well. This place can do the traditional Chicago dog for you as well as many creative dogs such as the Ooh la la which has Duck confit, lavender-fennel aioli, goat cheese, & house-pickled celery. Although this place is a few miles north of the city its easily accessible by public transportation or a cheap taxi ride. Once there you are also located in a nice downtown area with local shops. Blaze Pizza: This is a great inexpensive place to get a GF thin crust pizza. They put the toppings on in front of you at your direction ~ think subway style. Great lunch or dinner spot on the cheap.  Chipotle: So I figured most people know about this place because they are a large chain but if not you must check them out. High quality ingredients and low cost make this a favorite inexpensive spot for us.  Frankies Scaloppine: This is a great Italian place with several GF options including GF Lasagna, Fettuccine with marinara or cream sauce and several other options.  Wildberry Pancakes & Cafe: Amazing GF breakfast menu including pancakes and other awesome GF breakfast items. Jason's Deli: Although this is a chain we love the GF sandwiches. They can make customer sandwiches as well as other classics such as Reuben's.   Jake Melnicks: This place has some awesome wings with multiple flavors (hot, bbq etc.).

The young man at the counter welcomed me to ""the best restaurant in America"".  I smiled, thinking this was schtick- then realized he wasn't kidding. I think he really believes he's working at the best restaurant in America.  He was very nice, answering my questions and urging me to take my time. I ended up going with a turkey club on a pretzel baguette. GOOD CHOICE. It was absolutely delicious- perfect combination of salty, smoky, creamy, chewy, crusty. I got salt and pepper chips on the side- plus they gave me a free chocolate! Not bad for a little Valentine's Day pick-me-up when I'm in Chicago and hubby's in PA.  They have lots of vegetarian options, various whole grain breads, and much (all?) of their food appears to be organic. It's a tad pricy but after a couple of days of hot dogs and deep dish pizza (no regrets but not exactly health food!), this was a very welcome and delicious change of pace.

On my way down Michigan Avenue, heading back to my car in a lot far, far below this place, I happened upon a dead sparrow. Sidestepping, and feeling bad for the poor thing, I lingered a moment too long, noticing that the little guy was breathing, and appeared structurally fine, other than the fact that he was down for the count on the cold sidewalk. I suspect he hit a steel/glass wall and knocked himself silly. Damn, damn, damn. I can't leave him. So I pick him up. He's breathing hard, and doesn't argue with me. Now what? Sigh....I walk into CVS, bird in hand, looking for a box. I find an empty Nutraslim bar box, about bird size, and buy some kleenex for a makeshift nest. I am now carrying my purse, a bird, a box, some kleenex,  6 steamed buns  and a Thai Iced Coffee from Wow Bao, sushi from I Love Sushi, and the 902 page September Vogue I ""borrowed"" from the doctor's office. I pause, settle the bird in his new nest, and head toward the car.  I can't carry all this crap very well, so I look for some place to get a bag. None of the news stands have any, and then I pass Hannah's Bretzel. I see bags. You know the kind....they have handles, and are big enough to hold  a box of kleenex,  6 steamed buns from Wow Bao, sushi from I Love Sushi, and the 902 page September Vogue, all while balancing a bird in a box. I ask the nearest employees for a bag, expecting the ""Sorry, you must make a purchase..."" speech. Nope. They immediately said, ""No Problem!"" (as well as ""OH MY GOSH! A bird!"") got the bag, and opened it so that I could deposit my foodstuffs, kleenex box, 902 page Vogue, etc. while still carrying the concussed bird with a minimum of jolts.

The beef was very mild in flavor as well. I saw what looked like horseradish on the bread and meat, but didn't taste even a hint of horseradish anywhere. There was no sign of any kind of seasoning on the meat.  Finally, I feel like a beef and cheese sandwich like this would benefit from being served warm.

The sandwich was a perfect size for lunch, and you could tell that the ingredients were incredibly fresh and that the combination of flavors was well-thought-out. I loved it. My only complaint was that they had no real sodas there - my lunchtime staple is a Diet Coke, and all they had were fancy sodas with all-natural ingredients (I am a generally healthy human being but I would like to maintain my artificial sweetener consumption once per day thankyouverymuch).  My gluten-free friend was ecstatic about the option to add gluten-free bread to any of the sandwiches. She was highly impressed by the employee's natural inclination to change into new gloves and clean his work station prior to making her sandwich to avoid contamination. She adored her sandwich and was taking pictures of the restaurant and her meal to send to her friends back home in Atlanta.

We have a few folks with dietary restrictions in my office, and I though of all places, Hannah's would be best to accommodate.  One of those restrictions is Gluten-Free.   In looking at Hannah's Catering Menu it clearly states ""Gluten-Free? If you have a need for GLUTEN-FREE sandwiches, please call our Catering Meisters at 312-621-1111.""  So I did!!  My call was answered and when I asked to speak with someone regarding dietary restrictions with my Catering order, I was told to go to the website and that someone would call me back to confirm.  I proceeded to ask if someone was available now to speak with and was given and name, asked if I could speak with that person and was given a different name of someone that would call me the next morning (the morning of my lunch delivery..)   I went ahead and placed my order on-line.  Due to the dietary restrictions, there were (2) sandwiches I needed customized and (while not directly available on their catering menu, but available for in-store pick-up) I asked to add a individual, customized Chopped salad.  When I receive my ""confirmation call"" I was very kind, but directly expressed my frustration regarding my earlier inquiry phone call regarding my order and how I was pressed to submit on-line and await a confirmation call, to which she responded ""What store did you call?"" HUH? Where did I just place the order, is what went through my mind.  I proceeded to tell her I called ""her"" store just 5min prior to my on-line order being submitted.  She went on to ""sigh"" with regards to my special requests, most notably the individual, custom, Chopped salad.  I was told that ""this time"" they could accommodate the Individual salad, at the price of their Lunch Box ($11.99, regularly $8.99 in-store), but they would not be able to accommodate this in the future.  Maybe it's just me, but if a last minute $335 order came into my store, I would be happy to accommodate a one-off request.  It's not like the salad is unavailable all together, it's just not directly available on the catering menu in an individual size.

It's really delicious, and won't leave you feeling like a lump afterward as a big ole' Potbelly sub might. If I want something light, or I'm trying to keep it cheap, I like their ""Über Special"": a large soup and a bretzel for $6. Though, not all their soups are that great. The vegetable barley is one I really want to love, but it could use some more seasoning. The corn chowder is really good when they have it. I also really like Hannah's for breakfast. They have bretzel bagels (or ""bragels"") and they make really great egg sandwiches. I usually get ""The Works"", which is a fresh veggie omelet, bacon and cheese.

I also wasn't aware that it didn't come with the pretzel bread so that was kind of a let down. Brie is a great cheese but I think it needs to be a stronger cheese if they plan to keep that cranberry chutney. The soup was good, I love barley and it was full of barley.

2009-12-09,2.0,"Just visited HB for the first time today and I'm a bit annoyed, despite the delicious sandwich. This is a pricey place at $9 a sandwich, but I had purchased the 2-for1 sandwiches groupon, and I took a friend to lunch expecting to use it.  She eyes the menu, steps up to the counter, and then unexpectedly orders the 1/2 sand/ cup of soup ($8.99) and I order a full reg sandwich ($8.99) only to be told at the register that I couldn't use my Groupon because the groupon specifically states 2 sandwiches. Really, HB? Really? You're going to be that particular? Why? In addition, you're making MORE $$ since soup is a bigger profit center. Annoyed. Big time. So, like a schmuck, I dole out $20 for 2 very good, but also very small sandwiches in an assembly line place.  I have to agree with other yelpers here- We could have gone to a cheap sit-down for the same price. In addition, I ordered the parma ham w/ goat cheese (it was very good) and the girl behind me in line got it with brie- and I ended up with the brie. It was later fixed. The whole thing kind of left a bad taste in my mouth, pardon the pun. I'll use my groupon later, but I can't say I'll go back after that.",0.9237,0.848,0.101,0.052,0.4772619047619046

I ordered the smoked salmon bretzel which featured a layer of deep, ruby red lox, red onions, lettuce, a creamy spread, and capers.  This was my first bretzel and I was delighted by the soft, slightly chewy pretzel bun.  The ingredients were all very fresh, especially the smoked salmon.  The prices seem a little on the expensive side...maybe $9.00 for the sandwich I got, but it was exceptional compared to the typical sub I usually get for lunch (with the exception of Pastoral). The sandwich also comes with a bag of homemade chips or roasted almonds.  I elected to grab the chips and they were very crispy and definitely homemade.

It's like an indoor mall filled with shops and food choices...After many twists and turns, Hannah's Bretzel's true location was revealed (lord knows if I can find it again) and tastiness ensued. I perused the menu on the web ahead of time, anticipating what I might order which my Groupon (yes, the same one Anne S speaks of). So many appealing choices! I was torn between the Club, Parma, and the one with the fresh mozzarella and pesto. Mmm...Many options for carnivores and vegetarians alike. In the end, I went with the Club...The ingredient that tipped the scale in its favor was the avocado. I LOVE avocado on sandwiches (hence my obsession with the vegetarian option at Jimmy Johns, and I'm certainly no vegetarian).  The proscuitto was an added bonus as well. Hannah's Bretzel is set up like Subway...Start at one end of the counter, order, watch the nice employees make your sandwich, meet at the other end and pay. Pretty straightforward and un-complicated. However, for those prices ($9 a sandwich), I would expect to be served. I mean, I can order a burger and fries at TGI Fridays for the same price and have it brought to me. Although, it would not be as healthy... The sandwich itself was delicious...The bread was perfect, not dry, good pretzel-like flavor without being overly obvious. The turkey was tender, proscuitto crisp (I can never get it to crisp like that at home!), and there were avocados! Again, love the avocados. Was it worth $9? Maybe...Am I willing to pay $9? Nah. It did come with a ""side,"" but the portions were miniscule...I went with the toasted almonds. They were good, and a welcome alternative to the usual sandwich side of chips. Overall, Hannah's Bretzel was a wonderful experience. People were nice, food was tasty. I really would like to go back and try some of their other sandwiches, but I can't justify paying $9...I'll wait for the next Groupon and hope that the trend of organic=expensive dies out.",0.9886,0.827,0.135,0.038,0.5210813492063491

I had the Club, and it was the best Club I've ever had.  The prosciutto is way better than bacon!  It was crispy, juicy, and had so much flavor.  That would make the greatest BLT ever!  I also love all sandwiches with avocado.  So putting great turkey, great prosciutto, fresh avocado on a delicious roll is going to make a winning sandwich! I read in the reviews that the sides were small, but boy were they tiny.  The roasted veggies looked like the amount of veggies left stuck to the dish when I make them at home.  Instead I opted for the way less healthy chips, because it looked like a normal size. I can't get over that this would have been $9 without the Groupon.  Even with the Groupon 2 sandwiches were $4.50 a piece, and 2 drinks came out to over $4 dollars.  So the sandwich, chips, and drink would normally come out to $11.  At that price I could go to a sit down Thai place!  But I'm really glad I got to try it, because it was an incredible sandwich.  Anytime someone else is paying for lunch, I will suggest Hannah's Bretzel :)",0.9928,0.778,0.208,0.014,0.5757936507936509

If you make your own sandwich you can have two free condiments such as onions and tomatoes. After that, each additional will cost you.  I had lettuce and cucumber with turkey and spicy mustard on their famous and outstanding pretzel roll. You can also get a wheat/multi grain roll.

There are complementary side options which we had the tiny side of roasted vegetables but you can also have an apple, almonds and a few other options.

All organic and fresh, fresh, fresh! Our sandwich was really what hit the spot though, that sucker was the bees knees, man... the 'Parma Noveau' was piled high with prosciutto de parma, arugula, fire-roasted asparagus and slathered in a truffled goat cheese all atop that chewy, salty pretzel bread.

The chocolate chip cookie makes me very happy, and the honeycrisp apple bread (which is seasonal) rules. The oatmeal cookie is not good. I don't know how they got it wrong when all their other baked goods are nearly perfect. The chocolate selection is what made me go here in the first place.

I returned after ordering a Cosi sandwich to eat with my friends, which only served to confirm my initial reaction was indeed correct. The bread did look tasty (which was confirmed by my friends) but there was no meat on the sandwich. And the kicker--for a sandwich, soup, and tiny bottle of water: $16. Sixteen people. It's a sandwich (and, in all honesty, a disgrace to the proud, meaty sandwiches everywhere forced to share their name with this anemic abomination).  The coup de grace was the bag of chips. It was nothing more than shavings you'd find at the very bottom of a huge bag. Practically dust. It actually made the meal enjoyable for everyone because of the laugh it provided. The fact that someone in the service industry finds it acceptable to charge someone $16 for a sandwich, and then pass off potato dust as a bag of gourmet chips is astounding.

It might not be your thing, though, depending on what kind of pretzels you like. It wasn't hot, for example, but that doesn't bother me. It tasted exactly right, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with just the right amount of saltiness. I got it with the organic butter, which was fabulous.

EDIT 5/1/07 I finally tried a sandwich here today. The pretzel bread is, in fact, incredible. Best pretzel bread I've ever had? Probably. It was nice and soft on the inside... yummm. Unfortunately, I didn't LOVE the sandwich, but maybe I'm just not enough of a gourmand or something. I got the parma ham with fresh mozzarella.

And the sundried tomato sauce was overpowering and had a strange sweetness to it... and I would have preferred basil to arugala. A lot of that is just me being nitpicky, but I thought it could have been done better. Still, I appreciate the fact that the ingredients are a cut above your normal sandwich.

Yum yum, it was like eating some candy that's good for you.  I'd go back for this.  And in defense of their $9 sandwich, they did pile a lot of ham on it.  I've made this my ""standby"" in my ""around work"" lunch dining circuit... The bread to me was very good.  I hate places that have bread that's so hard that it hurts your jaw to chew, this is definitely not one of those places...  This was soft, not too soft with good texture.   When I'm not tempted by cute ole Sergio and his yummy meat, I also like the Spanish Ham (which is more like prosciutto) and manchengo, with chopped fennel and a fig chutney.  Pretty darn good! I swear they used to cut the sandwiches in half, now they don't.  The Sergio's can get quite messy mid-way through so I prefer it cut in half At first this place was so packed the line was way way way out the door, now it's much more manageable, and usually not even any wait in line is needed.  Though on the wrong day, watch out.. It's like Trixie central and you'll wait 5 minutes once you get your sandwich to pay as Julie decides if she wants to get a side of berries. The menu has a lot of options and is somewhat overwhelming to look at.  But luckily they have all of the sandwiches set up so you can just look and see what looks good.  They have a 1/2 sandwich, soup special on the menu (edit: I used to be really annoyed that they had their soups written nowhere and you had to ask, but now they put them on a little plaque... it was an uber annoying problem as I had to ask when I was ordering and I felt like I was holding up the line ).  Disappointingly, the soups never seem to change, it's been cucumber and barley for as long as I can remember seeing the sign. edit: ... OK, I got over the expensiveness of this place and go there quite regularly now... it's just that good :!  They seem to have fixed mostly everything I complained about before (the soups not posted, one measily napkin, etc)...",0.9858,0.765,0.142,0.093,0.5316250089779501
2007-03-19,2.0,"It took me almost my entire lunch to FIND the place.  It is pretty well hidden in 233 Michigan.  You know I don't like a place when I break out the numeric list.   I left there with a very bad taste in my mouth, but decided to hold off until I ate my sandwhich and drank my juice.  Meal complete, here we go.   1. I could not understand the guy asking me which side I wanted AT ALL.  He repeated them three times, looked annoyed, but was not familiar with the english tongue enough to pronounce them understandably.  I think one was Roasted Vegetables so I asked for that one.   It really pisses me off when people hired to interact with the public cannot speak english.  It holds up the line, it is annoying, and it really detracts from the experience.  Not being to communicate with teh customers is NOT good customer service.  2.  ""roasted vegetables"" or whatever he said, were more like thawed frozen vegetables with some kind of sweetening agent on them (Sugar, juice, salad dressing, whatever) not impressed.  Just the side.  the sandwhich is the point.  3.  When I checked out I was told my order (just the sandwhich, no beverage) was seven and change.  Ow.  Doesn't matter if the sandwhich is great though!  I accidentally handed the check out girl two fives and two singles rather than a five and three singels.  She gave me the two singles back, and told me I could put it in the tip jar. It was cutely cheeky enough that she could get away with it.  If there wasn't a line I probably would have told her I was not leaving a tip and why..  But charisma goes a long way and I dropped a dollar.  4. Sandwhich time.  Bread: a lot softer than I expected.  A lot softer.  I was pleased at first, but then the bread seemed a bit generic and unsubstantial.  Supposed to be French farmer's bread, but just kind of tastes..  generic white non-crusty.  I was hoping for something heartier but that coudl be my fault.   Here is my biggest problem; the french herbed Boursin cheese tasted like my grandmother's french onion dip (she makes it with sour cream AND cream cheese) on it.  So a mushy sandwhich that tasted like superbowl party dip and cucumbers.   5. The price was WAY too m uch for that.  I am not a Potbelly's fan, but I will concede their veggie sub kicked this one's ass.  At half the cost for a significantly larger portion.  I have paid more for a sandwhich, but I also enjoyed those sandwhiches significantly more.  I paid as much at Milk + Honey and the sandwhich stands out in my memory as one of the best things I have ever eaten.  I cannot expect that EVERY Time but I can expect not to wish I had spent $2.50 at subway instead.     All that said, I will probably go back;  I really like that they are organic and have some interesting veggie options, and I am hoping to find a more amazing bread.  they are also insanely convenient to my work (once you find them).  They were not dirty, and they did not make me sick so I will try them again, and update my review.  I am also checking two dollar signs because if I had gotten my juice there, or anything else, it would have been significantly over $11.",0.8927,0.818,0.095,0.087,0.44949633699633706
2007-03-12,3.0,"**This place would get a 4 Star rating but I wasn't happy with paying more than $10 for a sandwich and water. Best sandwich that I have ever had in my life.  It was really fancy with turkey and cheese on pretzel bread.  Somehow they knew exactly the right combination to make this sandwich great.   However, the location is new and the people in line (like me) were obviously confused at the fancy sandwiches so it took a little longer than it should have.  BUT well worth it.  I will definitely go back for a special lunch sometime. Sandwich options here include:  Black Forest Ham & Swiss Gruyere Cheese On Bretzel Bread;  French Ham & French Camembert On Whole Grain Bread;  Italian Parma Ham & Mozzarella On Bretzel Bread;  Smoked Turkey & Swiss Gruyere Cheese On Farmers Bread;  Vermont Cheddar, Cucumbers & Watercress On Whole Grain Bread;  French Herb Boursin Cheese, Cucumbers & Tomatoes On Farmers Bread; and Vegetable Bomb On Whole Grain Bread.",0.9232,0.802,0.134,0.064,0.3569057926200784
