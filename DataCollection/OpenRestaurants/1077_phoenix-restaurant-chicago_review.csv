I will admit that the actual food served was at least four stars, but the mean delivery of customer service would never make a trip to this restaurant worth it.

2017-07-14,1.0,"I first saw Phoenix Restaurant when I first moved to Chicago summer of 2015. My friends and I noted that it was a Michelin Guide restaurant but never bothered to venture there. It wasn't until May 26, 2017, that my friend from out of state wanted to try a Michelin Guide dim sum place so we decided to go here. On their door, and hanging up on the terrace was a sign saying Dim Sum 20% off Monday - Friday, until 4pm, so we thought to ourselves, awesome. However, as the meal progress, the service got worst and worst, it appeared that we were forgotten, took forever to order additional dishes. When we asked for the check, I noticed that it wasn't 20% off like it had advertised on the door and then they decided to tell us that it is 20% off cash only and that it was posted on the door. I said it wasn't prescribed that in English and they said it is written in Chinese. I was taken back by it as my friend who has taken a few courses in Chinese said there's nothing on there indicating cash only on there. I asked why it was not written in English and they said that they tell people when they ask for the check, I felt offended as I was a paying customer who did not speak Chinese and felt it was false advertisement to be told something in a written sign and only to find the truth after asking for the bill. When I asked if I can speak to the manager, the hostess proceeded to speak to the manager and just walked away. I was taken back as I was not done with the conversation. I then called the hostess and she said she was busy doing her job, wasn't her job to help the customers? As I never got an answer nor talked to the manager. She then pointed to the manager but never got the manager for me.  Finally, the manager came over and asked what can we do to resolve this, I said that they needed to honor the 20% off. Evidently, my friend who paid for the meal received a $400 fraudulent charge on his credit card after coming to this establishment, but we don't know if it was related, so just beware..",0.9691,0.839,0.106,0.055,0.44855072463768114

There's two of us and we had a fairly small table. Yet she puts it on the edge of the side farthest from us. Went there for dim sum and during lunch they advertised for 20% off from 11-4pm. However when we ask for the check they said cash only or we don't get the 20% lunch special! That's not something that was noted on the poster anywhere!

I would suggest if you do consider coming here, maybe plan on the weekends, even though it is crowded. Everything was so slow yesterday. Ok that's fine. But then they didn't even bother making almost half of the stuff we ordered. One item wasn't even available (or maybe it is because they're too lazy to make it for us?), but they didn't tell us this until after we waited for nearly an hour. We had to call a waiter over to ask if they were going to serve the rest of our food or not. Of course he came back and said the kitchen hasn't started making any of those. We ended up still hungry when we left but were too exhausted to order anything else there. Nobody wants to waste time on a weeknight dinner. We drove from Evanston for the meal as well.  I'm sure Phoenix won't care about this review. Even though I have come here for dim sum for a while now, after my experience yesterday I won't be coming back.

Instead of just having tickboxes or carts, this restaurant does both: you check things off on a menu, but then they come out on carts.

As a consequence of this, the dim sum here is fresher than at several other institutions; everything that came out was fresh and hot, but you still get the atmospheric roaming of carts around the restaurant.

Once there, they kept seating people ahead of us despite the manager assuring me that we were next. The staff wasn't being apologetic or even understanding, they were rather curt and dismissive.  We have been coming here for 10 years and have introduced it to all friends and family but this experience has soured things for us.

Not exactly what we got- you mark your order on the menu and they bring it out on carts, maybe it's done differently on the weekends? Clean tables, clean bathrooms, not too noisy. Overall, it's a nice place to go for dim sum, but our go-to dim sum place is still Cai. Food: We got the Pan Fried Chive Shrimp Dumplings, Pot Stickers, and Shanghai Xiao Long Bao (which I was told was really good; also be patient and don't dig in until they give you spoons to pick them up with otherwise you'll lose all the tasty juices inside!)      - Sesame Ball with Lotus seed Paste: Good filling to outside ratio, came out warm, soft and chewy, not greasy      - Pan Fried Taro Cake: A bit oily, I personally prefer the versions at Cai and Minghin which is more taro shreds than rice flour. These ones are more like pan fried turnip cakes with chunks of taro and dried shrimp scattered throughout. It still had a nice flavour though.      - Pan Fried Crepe: Reeks of fish, incredibly bland if you don't use the peanut (?) sauce mixture they give you. Not worth trying, it's basically like a normal shrimp crepe with dried shrimp squished in the rice layers with a hardened outside and drenched in oil.      - Dried Scallop with Egg White Fried Rice specified without soy sauce: Also a strong fish smell, tastes pretty fishy as well. Pretty average...      - Choy Sum listed as ""Chinese Green"": Cooked nicely, tender, cut into mangeable pieces- not like some places that serve large tree trunk sizes and expect you to attempt to gnaw bites off like beavers. Service: It's very unclear how you're supposed to order because of all the carts being pushed around, we waited for a while until a person came by and asked if we were done with the menu. To be clear you're expected to mark everything you want, even if it's a noodle dish from the lunch special or congee sections on the back side of the dim sum menu. CHECK YOUR RECEIPT that they hand back with your marked menu, they were very sloppy with our order. They marked us down for Chinese broccoli even though we clearly had ""Chinese Green"" circled and later we noticed they had forgotten to write one of our orders down altogether but we were too lazy to point out their mistake again. They need to work on communication with customers-one of the ladies pushing the carts didn't seem to understand English or Mandarin- and be more organized; we had four people come up to our table one afte the other to ask what we wanted to drink.

2016-06-15,5.0,"This place just keeps getting better and better --- once again they've updated the tables and interior a bit to make this competitive to Cai and Ming Hin for great places to take large parties for a banquet type meal (or just really comfortable for dining with family and friends). The best change however is in the dim sum. Last time I wrote a review, they had already improved dramatically on the flavor, texture, food temperature, and portion size. Now, they've taken it up another level by having highly refined flavors, great texture contrast, great food temperature, colorful and attractive plating (more Western style instead of using bamboo containers), and beginning to offer more unique items. All the meat items seem to be a little bit more on the fatty side although prepared with less oil and marinated better. The beef ball has one of the best flavors in Chinatown, the roast pork is comparable to BBQ King House, and siu mai is juicy and has a great firmness. The best part is that the flavor is more dependent on the ingredient quality than on spices or sauces. The crepes also have among the most elastic and fresh taste in Chinatown. Both the beef and shrimp are better options than the other fillings. The BBQ pork turnover has a fantastic buttery feeling to it with lots of layers of flakey dough and a piping hot BBQ pork filling. The congee is creamy and flavorful, comparable to what you'll find at Ming Hin and in my opinion, better than both Chi Cafe and Ken Kee.  The sweets also standout here as well. The puffy egg custard tart has a nice egg aroma to the custard and the crust is very flaky with just the right amount of butter. Tofu pudding is spectacular here, super silky and not too sweet with a very nice soy aroma. The baked creamy egg yolk bun also has a standout custard with a very aromatic and delicious egg yolk filling. The mango pudding has a perfect texture of being soft but slightly firm -- with a delicious fresh mango flavor and a touch of condensed milk for a creamy element. If you have loved Phoenix all these years for great dim sum, you'll love them even more after all these improvements. If you haven't tried Phoenix in a while, definitely come back to try this dim sum as they've caught up to and possibly even exceeded many of their competitors on your favorite dishes.",0.9977,0.792,0.204,0.004,0.577229064039409

We planned our dad's 70th birthday celebration here and it was a colossal disappointment. We made our reservations weeks in advance for a banquet style reception only to find out when we arrived that they'd given our tables away to a different party. So instead, they ushered our guests into a cramped makeshift spot in the corner. We were confused, our guests were confused. The manager was hiding behind his desk providing no assistance. Staff were scrambling and didn't know what to do. And it was another half hour before anyone was offered anything to drink or eat despite the fact that the menu was preset. Once things were underway, the dinner service did flow better.  The entire time we were there, the manager didn't once check in our party or offer any apologies for botching up our reservations. So way to go! with making your customers feel insignificant.

2016-02-10,1.0,"I ate here once a couple of years ago and had a great experience. This past Sunday, my husband and I decided to treat ourselves to a funday and I suggested we go here. We have been to other dim sum restaurants before and always enjoyed ourselves and I remembered liking this place. I seriously regret the decision; what a terrible way to start out our day of fun! We got there knowing it would be crowded and expecting to wait. We were told 30 min, which did not phase us. We were handed a numbered ticket and we stood and waited. And waited. And waited. At least 6 groups of people that arrived significantly later than us got seated before us--WTH?? We kept seeing people walk into the place, put their names in and then get seated within a few minutes. I thought MAYBE it's because we were just 2 people and the staff was waiting for a small table to open up so we wouldn't be wasting a big table. But then when we finally got seated it was at a big table so that theory doesn't hold up. We got seated at a huge, dirty table while 2 employees were frantically cleaning it, then they hurredly threw a pot of tea down and some chopsticks and disappeared without a word to us. We were left with no waiter. No one brought us water. No one asked us how we were or checked in on us or took our order. For a REALLY long time. We were starving and trying to make eye contact with ANY employee but to no avail. Finally, a guy came over after I stared him down and asked if we needed something. HELLO?? YES FOOD. He didn't even apologize, just took our cheesy sheet of paper where we had filled out our order. Then we waited some more. A woman eventually brought out one plate with 3 super greasy spring rolls on it. She dropped it off and left. Still no water. No plates. No condiments. We were so hungry so we quickly ate the rolls-they were swimming in grease and didn't taste like anything. More time went by and we got a plate of three pork/chive fried patties which were really delicious. We were still waiting for most of our food though. I flagged down a different employee and finally got a glass of water which I drank and was never able to get refilled. A third item showed up and as the woman put it down, she made a remark about how long ago it was ordered. It must have been sitting around in the back because it was completely cold and congealed and inedible. We decided to just cut our losses and get out of there. We went up to the cashier and explained that we never got most of our food. She didn't even apologize she just voided the items. We ended up paying a little over twenty bucks and we were there for TWO FULL HOURS and were still starving, grumpy, and felt like we'd wasted a whole afternoon. The cashier then had the nerve to tell us to leave a tip. Who would the tip be for, exactly? We didn't even have a waiter! I have never been more disappointed with service at a restaurant. I will never go back to this place. There are plenty of other restaurants to spend my money in that actually respect me as a customer.

2016-02-08,1.0,"Abysmal service. Food was hit or miss. My wife and I arrived for dim sum on a Sunday at about 1:30 pm and was told it would be about 30 minutes for a table. No problem. We knew this place was popular and were totally expecting a wait (it ended up being closer to 40 minutes, but I'm not complaining). Phoenix Restaurant apparently no longer does the traditional Dim Sum experience of bringing carts around to the tables and allowing diners to select items; rather, the diner selects items on a menu and then the food is brought out, making it far more similar to a typical tapas restaurant than anything else. Not totally what I was expecting, but not a deal-breaker. After we were seated, it became clear that the restaurant operates under some degree of chaos. We were never sure who we were supposed to provide our order to and ended up with a few flummoxed servers (I think?) who took our order. Then another (that we had to flag down) for water and soy sauce. A few of our items came out. The spring rolls were good, if a bit greasy. The steamed pork buns were nice. The pan-fried chive patties were delicious. I would like to comment on the other things we ordered, but they never showed up. Except for some gelatinous-looking (and feeling, and tasting) shrimp and cilantro dumplings a full FIFTY minutes after ordering. Frustrated, we left, taking our order sheet to the cashier and paying for the items we actually received. They didn't charge us for the items we ordered and didn't receive, which was nice, but there was nothing in the form of an apology. At least comp us our tea (your cost on a pot of tea is what...four cents?). Then, the cashier told us we could leave a tip at our table. A TIP? For what????

Then when we tried to order other items they said the same thing. Clearly they were trying to move us out because the place was jammed packed.

I did not realize going into Phoenix that this was a tourist trap - in other words, a place where they can get away with seemingly higher prices for the same quality foods as its neighbors. Location/Decor - located on Archer, right across the street from what I call the Chinatown mall, Phoenix cannot be missed. With its loud lights in the window paired with the dominant moniker, it is no shock as to why so many people just migrate here. Inside reminds me so much a hotel banquet room. Very interesting. It is very spread out. One big open room. I thought that this would have been a two story restaurant but it wasnt. I liked the fishtanks at the entryway and in the dining room. It gave it a very modern feel. Service - yo, these waiters are all hot, ha! I felt as though they were all characters from Tekken! Seriously, one of the guys looked just like Jin Kazama. Anyway, they were all very prompt and courteous. No small talk. Which is fine.  Drinks -waters for all. So I can't say much else. Food - fabulous! Very pleased with what we ordered!  *Pork Belly in XO Sauce - took longer than anything else to cook. I believe they simply forgot about it and had to put the order in when we reminded them. The issue with this we had all of our other dishes already on the table so by the time we got the pork belly, everything else was warm not freshly hot. 4 stars however! The pork was tender, and fell right off the bone. Spectacular flavor. *Szechuan Chicken - Delicious. Standard. Chicken pieces were great in size. Juicy and the breading was not overdone. 4 stars.  *Chicken Fried Rice - THIS is what sold me. The chicken fried rice is the BEST in Chinatown that I have had so far! Seriously! Order this. Mixed with the pot belly...I was in heaven. 5 stars. *Steamed white rice - cooked perfectly. No crunch, but not chewy. 4 stars. Price - $40 for two people really is not that bad for the amount of food we received.

The first of these two visits took a total of two hours. The same food carts kept circulating with no refreshing of the selection. A couple of times we were asked if there were specific items we were waiting for, we put in our requests and were told they would be out shortly, but we never received those items. Both the kitchen and the service were slow and disappointing.  The second of these visits was on Christmas Day. We checked in for our reservation (made 6 months in advance) and were told our table would be ready in 15 minutes. After 15 minutes we were told it would be a half hour. Then about 20 minutes after that we were told it would be another 30 minutes-- putting us at more than an hour past our reservation time. We were finally called for our reservation and, as we were walking to the table a different group sat down there and we were told we would have to wait.

Granted, the elevator wasn't working around 945am so we had to haul the stroller up the flight of stairs. Thankfully it was working on the way down so we could bypass the huge crowd of people waiting for tables.  The first tip is to get there before 1030am for dim sum on the weekends. Everything looked clean and new from the ceiling fixtures to the tables, chairs, and restrooms.  The large round tables can seat 12.  If you make reservations ahead of time, you can grab a private room.  The bathrooms are clean, but the stalls narrow and there's no changing table. They switched to the photo menu which makes it easy to find what you're looking for and write down the number of each dish you want.  Bigger entrees located on the back page.  It's helpful to go there with a regular who can order what you want for the table...aka our friend's mother-in-law who is also not shy about flagging someone to the table for service.  The dishes come out pretty fast.  We started with several bowls of congee.  It was super flavorful, not watered down, and full of meat!  I was happy to discover they had decent soup dumplings.  The deep fried taro balls are also my favorite.  I really enjoyed the BBQ pork buns with the sweet and crunch outer bun.  The salted egg custard bun was also delicious, warm and gooey in the inside.  Everything else was standard fare, pork shumai, shrimp dumplings, tripe and chicken feet (for the Hubby), and Chinese broccoli.  I was disappointed in the quality of their fried dough crepe; it wasn't as crispy or covered in sauce like at Cai or MingHin.  The sweet tofu was a great way to cap the meal, and they made it fresh so it took an extra 10 minutes.  SInce there were 12 of us we ordered 2-4 of each dish and the total wasn't bad at all.  Glad to add Phoenix back to my list of go-to Dim Sum places in Chicago.",0.9973,0.774,0.203,0.023,0.5395298542037673

They had a printed menu on the table where you checked which dishes you wanted. We picked several things. We were able to add to our order as we wanted (we were still hungry).

2015-10-13,2.0,"For being one of the only cart-pushing, lady-yelling dim sum restaurants in the area, I am disappointed that I can't give Phoenix a higher rating. Where you are seated can make or break the difference, and in this case, not even the food could save the meal. A few of my students and I came at 11:00am and was able to be seated quickly. Okay, so far so good, until they took us to the table that was right next  to the cash register! It was a small 5-6 seater table that was away from the kitchen doors and next to the crowd of hungry crowds awaiting to be seated. Needless to say, it was incredibly difficult to flag down a lady to come wheel her cart over (since the main banquet hall was in the opposite direction), and whenever they did come, they usually ran out of items that I really wanted! It took forever to get us our first plate, and it wasn't until the end of our Sunday brunch that we got some har gow. I even needed to be assertive with my Cantonese to get them to come over. I wish I could have been happier with the meal, but looking at the other options available in the area for dim sum, you are much better off checking boxes off a menu instead of waiting for the cart to come. Perhaps dinner here is better since extra attention would be given, but for Sunday dim sum, I'll take a pass.",0.9256,0.912,0.072,0.016,0.4568310657596372
2015-10-05,5.0,"It's worthwhile to note that wait time on a Sunday at 1:30pm for Dim Sum can be a disaster. Our group of 7 scheduled to meet up at just that time and we expected the worst but fortunately enough, we received the best outcome. We all arrived within seconds of each other and were seated right away! If you're all about that 'instant' lifestyle, you'll enjoy this place. I've averaged about 30mins wait times at most other Dim Sum places (mostly at Cai), but not here. This is not to say that Phoenix is unpopular, it's one of the most talked about Dim Sum restaurants in Chinatown, the food and service speak for themselves.  Very authentic a la carte experience where the servers circulated the tables with small trolleys and make stops announcing what it is that is on the cart. Menus are also available if you don't see your favorites around. The cart wielders are friendly and take requests to cut items down to smaller sizes.  Our table aimed to eat as much as possible. We demolished all the traditional items such as seared dumplings, shrimp egg rolls, sticky rice with chicken, egg tarts, mango jello, shu mai, soft tofu, chicken feet, taro cakes, shrimp ho fun, crispy sesame balls, bbq pork buns, beef tendons, and this only covered less than 1/4 of the items available. In terms of food quality, I'd say it's excellent. The food all came out piping hot, resembling freshness and promptness. I didn't feel the typical after effects of MSG as I normally would at other restaurants, but since we all overate, we had a slight food-coma, but that's expected.    Attention couch potatoes, if you are reluctant to leave the house in fear of missing a big game, you can leave with a peace of mind because there are multiple TVs hung on the walls for catching all the play-by-plays, not to mention this location has a clean environment and not all the hustle and bustle of your typical Chinese Restaurant.

Maybe that was become they weren't busy? Whatever the case it worked for us. This was also our first time here since the remodel. The remodel was definitely needed and the space is nicer than previously and bathrooms are much cleaner. Oh, you want to know about the food? Everything we had was good to very good.

We gave up on them years ago, but heard that they were under new ownership and figured maybe...   Phoenix used to have some of the best Dim Sum in Chinatown, but their service was beyond bad and and the food got really boring. The only truly great meals we had there were when we were with Cantonese speaking friends or my mother-in-law who speaks Mandarin, but commands hella respect in the Chinese community.  Phoenix is now remodeled (lipstick on a pig kind of remodeled) and the old crotchety staff was replaced with younger English speaking servers. If you can fathom this, the service is actually worse. We were there early and the carts were not being pushed around yet, so they gave us a Dim Sum card to fill out. No problem until they left it sitting on the table for over 20 minutes as we watched the carts start to roll out. And the carts rolled right on by with nary a glance at our table. We had to repeatedly get up from the table to chase down the carts and get the food we wanted - apparently a HUGE inconvenience for the servers as evidenced by their surliness.  No water refills, no teapot refill and bland boring food that we had to chase down. This Phoenix is certainly not rising, it's a downward free fall.",0.8504,0.774,0.123,0.103,0.5144246699802257

They had a wonderful staff to match their exquisite food. They were packed ALL the time. But I guess all good things have to come to an end..  The Remodel was the beginning of that end. It went from an out-of-date, large but slightly cliché, 90s Chinese restaurant (just from appearance) to a lush, modern and shiny new establishment. Unfortunately, that's not where the change stopped... At the beginning of the sumer, ownership switched hands and let me say it was NOT for the better. My family has been coming here regularly for two decades and I think today may have been our last.  First, the entire staff that had been working there for the whole time we had been coming was replaced with a younger staff. Sure their English is better but they also stopped trying. Little things like walking around your table as they refill your water, not a huge deal, but when my 81 year old grandma is reaching a glass across a table to a 20 year old guy it starts to look ridiculous.  The lack of liquor license is certainly not helping either... I don't know how to put this best but the most heartbreaking part is the degradation of the food.

2015-04-01,4.0,"I came to Phoenix last night with a friend as she had never had dim sum and Phoenix was one of the few places serving dim sum at 6 pm (most places in Chinatown--that I know of--only serve dim sum within a certain time frame). My first dim sum experience was at MingHin so I was a bit skeptical as MingHin is amazing, but this place didn't disappoint. There were only a few tables filled and aside from what other reviews have stated, we were given a dim sum menu to order from vs. the cart going around. Given that it was an odd hour for dim sum, they only had a limited menu (for the most options, you need to go in the morning). I was happy to see that they had the basics (bbq pork bun, sesame balls, etc.).  I could see how the service could be a bit frustrating for some as the servers don't continually come to your table to check on you. I think things are a bit different in Chinatown as this was the same at MingHin. If you want something, simply grab the attention of your server when they're walking by. I didn't see a problem with that... it was actually kind of nice to be left alone to enjoy my conversation and meal. Our water was continually filled and the food came out hot, fresh, and surprisingly quick. Between the two of us, we ordered 9 dishes (don't judge) and the total came to $38! My favorite place is still MingHin, however, if you aren't looking for a fancy decor and high-end service, I recommend Phoenix for dim sum dinner.",0.977,0.82,0.134,0.046,0.5573359073359074

Wait until the food comes rolling around on a little carts that have amazing food. Be willing to try everything, even if it looks weird. I love the shumai and potstickers. It's like small plates, but Chinese style. I'm like, 10% Chinese or something so that could possibly explain why I'm obsessed with dim sum. Plus it doesn't even cost that much money! Parking is the only thing that super sucks about this place since it's in Chinatown; you really have to look around or else it might just be better to park in the lot that's only $2. The service isn't amazing either; really the only way to get a drink is to flag down the waiter in the beginning when they greet you in the very beginning before you start grabbing food. But when they start walking around with the little carts of food, they are pretty good at telling you point blank what they are. It's a definite place to go with a bunch of friends and especially family, or even a little lunch date with a significant other.

2015-03-19,3.0,"I had a pretty A-OK experience coming here for dim sum on the weekend, although I do have some complaints about Phoenix. We came here for dim sum because we wanted sesame balls. We checked the menu ahead of time and were thrilled to see them on the menu. We parked and came in, went up the stairs, and the hostess seated us right away.  It was pretty confusing because all the food was already prepared on various carts that were going around. I immediately didn't like that because it means the food isn't made fresh. Just seeing how many of each were on these carts (which didn't have any kind if warming tray either) had so many containers of the same dim sum dish that I knew hey would have to sit for a while before being consumed. My girlfriend doesn't eat meat, so we had to wait maybe 10 minutes before a cart came by that happened to have veggies. It wasn't fresh, hot, or even warm really. Not a good introduction to Phoenix.  I noticed there were a lot of staff working and someone eventually noticed that we had only ordered one of the many dishes, so someone was kind enough to say, ""What do you want? Let us know and we will make it for you."" Our remaining dishes were made fresh and I appreciated that. The lotus seed bun was steaming and hot. Delicious! The sesame balls were good, although I was disappointed to discover that there was no red bean paste in them. I think it was lotus seed paste, which was still good, just not what we were looking for.  I would be open to coming back here again, but maybe not until I try the other dim sum places around Chinatown to determine what the best place to go is. Next time, I'll just flag someone and order directly from the menu so we can bypass the carts.",0.9124,0.865,0.085,0.05,0.5428571428571428

2015-03-15,3.0,"Phoenix is one of the most inconsistent dim sum places in town. There's been many times where I've told myself that I'd never again return due to the service, but I still find myself coming back for the food. Almost everything is delicious. But be sure to sit in the right location (close to where the carts first come out).  A poor seating choice means that most of your dishes will come out cold. A bit disappointing, since their window views are actually pretty good -- you get a great view of Chinatown and the rest of Chicago. Timing also matters; you'll find that Phoenix pulls back their selection quite a bit in the afternoon.  Great inventory management on their part, but it leads to a very subpar experience if you go after 1pm. Service is generally abysmal. You'll largely be ignored unless you holler at the waiters. Be sure to ask for a menu, and be aggressive in indicating what you want. Even then, they'll forget to bring you half of the dishes you ordered.  The dim sum here is a bit more expensive than some other places, which is a little disappointing because I tend to not worry about prices when eating dim sum.

2015-03-07,2.0,"We decided to come to Phoenix for dim sum after craving sesame balls for months. After reading some reviews on Yelp, we decided this would be a good place to come. Generally, I thought, Chinatown restaurants have lower than deserving reviews because there are a lot of people complaining about how it's not ""authentic."" We parked in the paid lot, which is only $2 for 1-2 hours but ONLY if you get the ticket validated from. Select restaurant. Phoenix is on the list, so don't forget to ask for a validation like we did! (Otherwise, it's $10.) Positives:  -The employees who interacted with us were generally pleasant. When they sensed we weren't ordering a lot from the carts, they set a menu in front of us and said to pick what we wanted and that we would make it for us.  -This place has a great ambiance. It's clean and looks slightly fancy. I know they spent time on renovations previously and it definitely shows in a good way.  -Fried taro, sesame balls, and fried lotus seed buns were all excellent. They made the lotus seed buns fresh for us, so they were piping hot. They were perfectly sweet without being overwhelmingly so.  -It only cost us $20 including tax and tip for our whole meal and we left feeling very full.  Negatives: -After we were seated, we were generally ignored for almost 10 minutes. Our glasses were filled, then there was no waiter. We weren't familiar with the ordering process and no one ever informed us that the way they do things is for people pushing carts of different dim sum items to offer items (no waiter). Good customer service would have had a, ""Have you dined with us before? Here is the ordering procedure"" kind of spiel.  There should at least be a sheet of paper at tables or even something on the wall telling people in English what the procedure is.  -The women pushing the carts sometimes ignored us. We saw a huge cart of sesame balls (exactly what we came here for--finally) and the woman gave us a dismissive look when we inquired about them, instead moving toward a few larger groups toward the back of the restaurant.  -We were told that the fried taro was just that: taro, fried. I got 3/4 through eating one before I realized there were chunks of pork inside! I don't eat meat, so this was extremely disappointing for me. I like to know what I'm eating and it's unfair that what I assume is a language barrier would prevent me from following my chosen diet.  -The first item we ate, which we were informed was ""vegetable,"" was fairly disgusting because it barely lukewarm. It was tough to bite into when I know it's meant to be soft and chewy when fresh. This is another reason why I am NOT. Fan of the carts. You don't get to see all the items on the menu, you don't know if there's even a cart going around with what you want, and even if there is, you might be ignored or the food may not be fresh. It's a game of Russian roulette and it isn't my style at all when I want to sit down to a relaxing meal.  I definitely will not go out of my way to return here. I think the cart ordering is just not my preferred style. I prefer to have dim sum like at Ming Hin, where everything is laid out for you, and it comes made fresh and hot.

The placed was absolutely PACKED! Shoulder-to-shoulder packed. Good for them, but not so good for us. After waiting at least an hour, my party of 4 was seated. Then the real trouble started. We couldn't get a waiter. We finally flagged someone down and wanted drinks. They never came. Flagged someone else down, and finally got some. In the meantime, the ladies are passing us right by with their carts. No one is stopping at our table. We were tapping on shoulders, they'd look, and keep going. What the hell? Finally asked for a manager, and we placed our order off the dim sum menu. Since we were now starving, we also ordered fried rice. HELLO--$15 for an order of fried rice? And only so-so good fried rice? I thought that must surely be a mistake, but no, $15 for an order of fried rice!  Then, HALF the things we ordered from the menu were gone already.  To finish our field trip off, we couldn't get a waiter to get us our bill. The first person we asked for drinks finally showed up, asked if everything was good, and left. He showed up for the tip, but never provided the service. The service here, by far, was the absolute worst service I've ever experienced at any restaurant, and I think that's the smallest tip we've ever left for waitstaff. In the end, my husband hated it. Too bad since it was his first dim sum experience it was ruined for him.

If the line's too long, my family will usually bail. The atmosphere is spot on Hong Kong dim sum restaurant, full of noisy food carts and ladies hawking their wares. However, in terms of the food, it's not a whole lot given the price. Given the amount of food my family likes to order, it's not so fun when the wallets have to be emptied. They do a great cha shao (tsa xiu) bao, always piping hot and the filling is always dripping with sauce. Noms. My family also judges the quality of a dimsum place by its ""zhou"" or rice porridge. Here, it's hit or miss. Sometimes the pidan is too hard and hasn't settled or stewed in the rice enough to infuse it's richness into the overall flavor of the rice. Sometimes, it's just thick and soupy enough. If you have never been to Chicago and are planning to stick to main attractions, I'd say give it a shot.

If you're like me, and have fond memories of growing up eating dim sum by eagerly/impatiently anticipating the screaming Chinese ladies to push a cart full of goodies directly to you, then whether or not a dim sum place has carts is of special significance. Happily, this place has 'em! :D With that very important fact out of the way, I guess I should mention that the carts were probably also the highlight of the meal... Is the food bad? Well no, not really - some of the dishes are actually pretty good (e.g., the porridge ...though, how do you mess up porridge??), and there's decent selection. But is the food really good? Ehh ... The ""rice noodle roll"" (肠粉), for instance, was soggy, and not very flavorful. More importantly, I'm so used to actually great dim sum (Tim Ho Wan, anyone? :D) that this really doesn't really cut it. Even compared to other options in Chicago's Chinatown alone, I'm not sure Phoenix would be my go-to. (Ming Hin takes the cake for me, even despite its cart-less-ness.)

Still it took forever for my entree to come out. My girlfriend basically finished her dim sum before my food was served to me. This was not due to the dim sum being made quicker or anything like that. The entree just took forever, and I'm not sure why because it was only fried tofu. I had to ask where it  was at one point. Also, when I ordered the salt and pepper Japanese tofu, I asked our waiter if it was served on top of Egg (like so:  yelp.com/biz_photos/hing… ), and he replied yes. However, what I was served was not this dish. There was no egg. The tofu was fried solid and had super thick fried batter all around, and it was not spicy. The dish in the picture has thinner fried batter, and the tofu is still deformable even after fried, plus it's supposed to be kind of spicy. I asked several people if I was given the right dish and they said yes, so I guess the food here just isn't made that well. I did not enjoy my entree. The service was slow to bring the check as well.

My friend and I came on a Sunday around 11am - the place was already packed and there was a short wait. It gave us time to look around at the new digs - the place looked brighter, cleaner, and were filled with happy people so all signs were good! We were seated in about 15 minutes to a little side room to the right of the entrance (typically used for parties but is opened up on weekends for the busy hustle and bustle). Tea service was prompt and silverware was clean...but the food took FOREVER. Our table got shafted for larger groups (who seemed like they had connections to the owners) because all of the carts of food that came through went to them first despite us being closer. Also to note, they don't have the steam carts here which was disappointing as it's a part of the dim sum experience! It took us over 40 minutes for our food to come and it was definitely not worth the wait.  My friend and I got the usual - Siu Mai, spare ribs, chicken feet, hao gao, taro cake, taro fried puff, and chicken wings (the chicken wings was because we were so hungry and needed food). Out of all those items, the chicken wings were probably the best. Everything else was forgettable as flavor was lacking in everything. Even the hot chili oil tasted liked water. We left, still hungry and completely unsatisfied.

A lot of new competition has opened up in Chinatown but I always thought Phoenix would be an oldie but goodie like Triple Crown or Furama.  Went with a group of 8 for dim sum over the weekend.  It was just after 12 but the place was only 3/4 full. Not a good sign when most spots cite a 15-30 min wait time.  First up: service leaves something to be desired. That is putting it lightly! I used to wait tables so usually find the ""Chinatown School of Service"" charming. Not so here.  The waiter barked at us: ""Tea?! Tea?! Jasmine?!"" without pausing for our answer as he hurried away.  Despite the restaurant being pretty empty, we were seated next to the bathrooms.  It was bothering one of my friends and we haven't ordered any food or gotten drinks yet so we slid over to the next empty same-sized table.  No biggie, right?     Another waiter went bananas. Actually B-A-N-A-N-A-S: shouting at us ""No, can't!!!"" in 2 languages, moving our stuff back, herding us and waving his hands frenetically in the air.  At this point, the non-Cantonese speaking members of our party were getting a little scared.  We tried calming him down by explaining that we weren't comfortable and why.  Turns out, that specific table (aka, not next to the men's bathroom) had been reserved. Next time, lead with that?  Or put a sign on it?  Or redirect us to one of the other 3 tables that also seats 8?  Number of solutions aside from yelling at customers in multiple languages... Next up the food: pretty mediocre.  The selection was kind of limited.  At least a quarter of things on the printed menu weren't available including dim sum staples like shrimp chong fun and Sui Mai). Instead, the dim sum ladies continued peddling the same items over and over. Of what they did have, the chives dumpling, spare ribs and har gow were decent. The BBQ pork turnovers, tendon and chicken bao tasted stale like they may have been warmed back up.  The worst part?  Phoenix isn't even a good value! The per person bill was the highest we have had for dim sum in Chicago. Think that's a mix of higher prices (ie, what dishes are considered a large item vs medium) and smaller portions (needed to get more to be full).  The swing factors pushing this from a 1 star review to a 2 star are:  (1) they use pushcarts and that makes me nostalgic  (2) some of the cart ladies were kind of funny and made us think not everyone was mad to be working there  Too many dim sum spots in Chicago to recommend coming here!",0.9918,0.81,0.135,0.055,0.5065890736943369

Order something new.  Don't merely order dishes you know of but those that stand out or stuff you've always wanted to try.  I.e. beef tenderloin or seafood, something that you think could wow you. The other late afternoon I just got off a flight at Midway and was Jones'ing for Asian fusion or Chinese food.  I had left ""BFE"" California where their local five star Asian fusion spot had been such a hardship to try and visit.  Hardship merely because in that area of NorCal restaurants and businesses close at 9 pm even on weekends! So, I'm flying into Chicago and quickly scanning Chinatown on Yelp and found this place.  After visiting I would soon realize that I'd been to this restaurant some years before their renovation.  At that time, some two or three years back I visited during late night and everything we got was off the dim sum menu.  Two guys ordered a hodgepodge of items and shared everything.  The bill was light.   Fast forward to now, the restaurant dining area much nicer than how I remembered it.  Also, service was much more attentive.  At this time late in the afternoon just a day after the Blackhawk's win of the title once again, the restaurant started off quiet with families coming in one by one slowly filling the area to almost a maximum by the time our dinner service had ended at about 8 pm.  I started off the dinner with a few quick dim sum favorites like pot stickers, egg custard buns, pan fried meat buns and stuffed egg plant.. ah the recollection is making me hungry.  After which also ordered off the sizzling specialties; the beef tenderloin with black pepper as well as a noodle dish and one other entree.  Everything was tasty, prepared nicely and tasted fantastic.  The sizzling entree had a presentation with table top stove, sizzling dish, meat and onions prepared table side.  By the end we still had food remaining for take out and the egg custard buns to enjoy as dessert.  Didn't bother ordering any alcohol but did order a nonalcoholic favorite, the mango delight.  Very fruity, I bet they use a bit of mango nectar to take the taste to new heights.  Spent a bit over a Benjamin with tax and tip.  With photos posted to social media afterwards, I'm foreseeing a possible redo with friends in the weeks to come.  I might suggest the Peking duck.  On a table nearby a beautiful duck was presented, one waiter took time to cut portions for the table to share.  Another waiter emerged with another table for serving, on this he took some portions of duck and created a taco using egg roll wrapper and what I presume to be plum sauce. Newbies (those new to try the restaurant) ask for a dim sum menu whatever the time is.  I hate that the servers never think to ask if you'd like one nor will they offer up any assistance in ordering unless you ask.  Otherwise the dudes are like ninjas.  Fast when they bring that which you need but slow in response when waiting to place another order.

The food and atmosphere has not changed, which unfortunately cannot be said about most restaurants in Chinatown.

I wouldn't say their dinner items are outstanding either. Portions also tend to be smaller than your average Chinese restaurant. Dim Sum Musts: -Siu Mai, dim sum classic that you cannot go without -Shrimp & Cilantro Dumpling, so simple and yet so good; I love that it really emphasizes the sweetness of the shrimp -Crispy Fritter Crepe, this dish combines two of my favorite dim sum items and is coated with a sweet soy sauce -Seaweed Roll, if you like fried sushi, you will love this!

They did have a separate menu for noodle dishes and the like... we didn't order any, so I can't assess.  All I can say for sure is that I have had dim sum many many times, and I've had GOOD dim sum (Monterrey Park, CA) and this place really missed the mark.  I left feeling dissatisfied.  All the excitement I had, and it really was no better than the stuff hubby gets from the frozen food section and warms up on his own...",0.9855,0.758,0.179,0.063,0.5108644358644359

I didn't want to be the Dim Sum porker so I replied yes to less plates than I would have liked to have tried as it's a big commitment to want to eat all 3 pieces rather than nibble on one or a half.  It was still a great learning experience.  It was my first time doing Dim Sum so I want to come back now that I think I get the hang of it.  I am pretty sure I committed a faux pas when I said yes to something that sounded harmless and was in a steamer basket but when it was on the table I knew I would not want to eat it.  The woman graciously took it off the table. I would NOT recommend Dim Sum at the Phoenix to vegetarians or groups which contain a majority of  vegetarians.  The cart arrival was fairly random and we had to flag down a manager to get the two vegetarian choices delivered.

Chicken breast with grilled vegetables ($13.95) is tossed with a thick and very bland gravy; not that pleasant, but probably the best thing we ordered. Mushu pork ($13.95) comes in questionably stale mushu pancakes, the meat and vegetables are cooked to death such that one cannot tell them apart, and the flavor profile is dominated by the jarred plum sauce that gets mixed in.

Dim sum at Phoenix consists of the typical Cantonese dishes. There aren't any specialty dishes or at least, not that I know of. You can point at the carts for something that you find appealing or check off those colorful prints. Very user-friendly! Some of my favorites are the stir-fried egg noodles, shrimp dumplings, siu mai, braised beef ribs, potstickers, spring rolls, and steamed rib tips. It's approximately $15-20 per person.  Their wedding reception service is very accommodating. We were able to take over both halls after their weekend brunch ended for decorations such as center pieces, wedding favors, chair covers and sash, wall coverings, and lighting. Phoenix' wait staff was very quick and efficient with setting the tablecloths, linen napkins and utensils. Everything was ready by 5pm and boy, it was stunning! My heart even skipped a beat!  The food was served in a smooth flow. The stage table consisted of the groom, bride, and bridal party. Each person on the stable table was served individually and empty plates were quickly cleared from the tables. My personal favorites of the meal were the appetizer samplers, crab cakes, lobster, shark fin soup, abalone, steamed fish, and squab. (Yes, I love my share of seafood and exotic dishes!) The bar was also very quick with satisfying everybody's quench. I don't think there was ever a moment in which they could pause and take a break.

I think what must bug these hard working folks is that we show up and expect them to know the English names for things that are as unique to them as a confetti-sprinkled custard-filled donut would be to us. They just don't have English names...and they struggle to pronounce the few words they do know. I have had MUCH better luck drawing a picture of what I want on the paper tablecloth - which amused the server and we had a laugh about it. Today, I knew I wanted a special wonderful thing called a Shanghai Dumpling so I quick downloaded a Dim Sum app and showed my server the screen (it contained Chinese characters) She nodded and laughed and even said to me ""Good job!"" So its a little like being in another country - if you make the effort you will be rewarded. I am going to teach myself the names of our 5 favorites so I can ask for them!

2012-06-10,3.0,"Phoenix did not live up to the hype for me.  I lived in Hong Kong for a number of years so my standards may be overly strict, but here goes. The atmosphere is a bit dingy and the service once you get to the table is brusque to the point of being rude.  But that's to be expected at a dim-sum joint, so no points docked just yet. No, the stars started coming off as soon as our first dish arrived.  I was excited to see that they served crispy fritter crepes (#30 on the menu) because this tends to be rare in the U.S.  The great thing about this dish is the contrast of the crispy fritter on the inside with the soft noodle wrapping on the outside.  In the Phoenix version the fritter showed no hint of crisp, which pretty much defeats the whole purpose.  0 for 1. Next we went for the chicken feet (#7), which tend to be a staple at dim-sum joints and rarely screwed up.  As long as you like chicken's feet.  At Phoenix they use a noticeably different flavor profile from most.  It was more like a savory Texas BBQ sauce than the typical semi-sweet Chinese sauce generally served.  It wasn't bad, just different. From there we moved to #3, shrimp cilantro ha gao.  This turned out to be the highlight of the meal.  The shrimp was succulent and well cooked, and the dumpling was properly packed and seasoned. Number 33, pan fried meat bun was another flop.  The key point with this dish is steaming the bun first, then frying it at the end to add a little crisp on the top and bottom, leaving the sides on the inside warm and moist.  Phoenix seemed to get the order backwards, because these buns were obviously steamed after frying, so there was no crisp.  And the steaming process itself involved too much water, leaving the bun in a semi-sticky state. We finished up with an egg crepe, which was bland, and an order of the mini egg custard pies, which was good but not spectacular. After the meal we walked around Chinatown for a bit and noticed a number of restaurants that appear to be recently opened, as well as some that are off the main path.  We'll definitely be exploring the other options next time we're in the area.",0.9811,0.817,0.128,0.055,0.4961111111111111

Congee, Barbeque Pork Buns, Hot Chicken Feet, Braised Squid, Black Pepper Short Ribs, Crispy Orange Chicken, and steamed Pork Dumplings were our selections. Did we order enough? It was only breakfast/brunch time. While waiting for our meal to arrive, I couldn't help wonder how the tally was calculated on the dim sum, since the standard paper and pencil to pen down our selections was missing. The staff had a numerical coded method which was listed on the photograph menu for dim sum. Pretty clever, I must say. Though the language was certainly a barrier, the service was fast and efficient. Thankfully, for us, our previous experiences rendered us an expert to our palate, so pointing to pictures sufficed.  I am partial to congee simply because it invokes fond childhood memories of my school trips to Musoorie (hill station in India we visited during summer). For breakfast I relished eating English porridge with brown sugar and a hint of salt. I realize this has no similarity to the Chinese congee, yet it invokes similar sentiments. Congee, if made well is hearty, bursting with flavors, and with the addition of condiments such as soy/chili/ginger as per taste brings the dish a nosh above your bland porridge. An acquired taste I believe, but I did over time manage to get my family hooked on it too.

The fish, although both steamed, had different flavors and textures, and the chef prepared the fish perfectly! The snapper had a slippery consistency and was cooked just right.

2011-12-03,4.0,"I was introduced to dim sum a few years ago by my beloved who is Taiwanese. Phoenix will always have a place in my heart since it became my first and I fell in love with the culture, the people watching and the FOOD!  OMG.  The food is amazing!  Since there is not a dim sum restaurant in Milwaukee, we make frequent trips to Chicago to satiate my dim sum cravings.  Everytime we go to Phoenix, I find something else that becomes my ""favorite"".  As time as passed, this becomes more and more of a problem, since often just the two of us will go and there ends up  being more and more dishes that I must have.  It is fitting that Phoenix is my first review. We were meeting family and friends today in Chinatown and started out convinced that we were going to try out a different dim sum restaurant that had just opened.  After arriving to said restaurant and sitting down, my fiance's face became immediately sour.  No carts.  No go.  Something we had not realized.  We left quickly, texted the fam with our change of plans and arrived at Phoenix. We easily snagged a table for 6 which is great since I have waited over an hour at times on a Saturday afternoon.  Not as busy today, although I think we had just missed the rush. Note: I highly recommend going to Phoenix on a Saturday or Sunday since I have become a firm believer that it's not the same experience without a crass-faced cart pusher hasseling you about taking the last shumai so she can fill her cart with something more desirable .  It helps to have someone with you that is savvy in Chinese that can navigate the carts and locate the best items.  Also, try  couple of things that are out of your comfort zone.  My soon-to-be family jokes that I am marrying Chinese just so I can validate my appetite for eating the weird stuff! We normally for go the standard tea and upgrade to jasmine pearl. Not to miss. Curried Baby Octopus: Delicate, slightly chewy and covered in a viscous curry that is sweeat and lush. Shrimp Rice Noodle Rolls:  My BFF's fav.  The noodles are nearly translucent but flecked with shrimp and green onions and luxurious in texture. Tripe:  My favorite dish.  Usually we get the tripe with fermented black beans and sliced chilies, but today they had a preparation I had not had before that was amazing.   The tripe was accompanied by large stewed pieces of daikon in a soy, hoisin and vinegary sauce.  I admit that the entire table didn't get to try this because it didn't make it far past me. Steamed Beef Tendon: Gelatinous, rich and very tricky to pick up with chop sticks without ""stabbing"" which to me is cheating. BBQ Pork Bao: FI's childhood fav.  An airy bun stuffed with pulled BBQ pork. If they come around with these, take them RIGHT AWAY.  They tend to sell out quickly. Spare Ribs:  Tiny morsels of tender rib tips in a black bean sauce with ginger and green onions.  This didn't come around today and FI was still looking for it even as we were stuffed to the gills and ready to leave. Phoenix Claws: I find chicken feet really hard to eat.  It's impossible to pickthe small bones out of your mouth in a subtle fashion without appearing unladylike. Despite all that, I can never seem to pass these up. The chicken feet at Phoenix are moist and tender. Red Bean Sou: A flaky pastry stuffed with red bean paste.  A must have dessert. Turnip Cakes:  Mashed daikon with bits of savory pork.   Dou fu fa: Silky tofu in a sweet ginger syrup.  My new favorite sweet item.  I could eat bowls full. The dumplings, shaomai and gao are also all very good here but as I get more and more wrapped up in trying new things, I seem to pass these up.",0.9922,0.855,0.105,0.04,0.49965242905242896

Big disappointment.  The dim sum was below average.  For example, in the lotus paste bun, the dough was dry and the lotus paste had a too silky consistency.  The shrimp and vegetable dumpling filling was simply a glob of proteins awkwardly squeezed together, and the flavors did not penetrate through to the shell, my favorite part.  The char shui buns were under seasoned, and the vegetable crepe had a mushy and wayy too thick shell.  The congee was filled with oil and pork fat.

They do validate for parking (the lot under the el), but you can often find street parking if you're willing to drive around for a while.  Service can also be a bit inconsistent.  If you do one of the large group tables in the back, they often don't bother pushing the carts in there (too crowded) and will just bring one or two dishes to show you.

That being said, as a vegetarian, I don't expect to be able to eat much in China town, unless they have a Buddhist menu (which Phoenix does not).  I went with a group on a Sunday afternoon for dim sum.  I ended up ordering for myself instead of sharing with the group because all but two items on their dim sum menu are not vegetarian.  I got mixed vegetables, which is simply mixed veggies with garlic, with a side of white rice.  They do have a page that is for vegetables and tofu, which says that anything on the page can be made vegetarian.  Key words - ""can be made"".  From experience, as it is with Chinese food in China, just because it says ""vegetable"" does not mean it is void of pork shavings, tiny shrimp, etc.  I would make sure you ask before you eat if you are a veggie.

We have experienced many Chinatown restaurants that offer dim sum that is significantly tastier, but Phoenix did hold its own with most of these dishes.  However, there was a huge crowd so we had a fairly long wait time. The quality of the food did not justify that wait.  Also, it seemed like the waitstaff was pushing a few popular choices, instead of a broad selection. But I like variety when I do dim sum. I kind of felt like the waitstaff saw us as a Tourist table and so gave us the Tourist food.   I think we may have hit Phoenix after it peaked. A lot of times, when a restaurant gets super-popular, the quality of the experience suffers as the volume of patrons increases.  I'm not saying ""Don't go there,"" although I doubt I will personally be back.  There are lots of really good dim sum options in Chinatown, and I wish more people would give those places a chance.

Well versed in Chinese food, they were ready to go too. When we were seated (and they do have room for larger groups!) we watched a parade of dishes come around on little carts. My roommate would give us explanations of what the various dishes were, and we would then grab what we liked. There was truly something for everyone, from soup to dessert.

My mom and I have very discerning palates and together we have sampled dim sum in Hong Kong, mainland China, all over Asia, Canada and the US.  Of all the places we have visited in Chicago, the Phoenix, in our opinion has the most consistent quality dim sum.

It was very crowded. One of the best things I can say about the place is that they have a good system for moving people through the wait line. We waited an hour and it was the finest part of the experience. Once we got to our table, we waited half an hour for any carts with food to come by. At one point, I stood up and walked around to see where the carts were and there wasn't one on the floor! Where was the food, I asked the waitress, who grunted. The food in general is gelatinous, oily, mushy, very close I thought to downright awful. One dish that was good was the barbecued pork rolls, not greasy and the barbecue flavor was pretty tasty. Anything, such as a shrimp, that is surrounded by a noodle, is a no-no. The noodles are just way too rubbery and unappetizing.  Almost all of the dim sum is fried, most of it is meat, so if you like to go light on those, that's another reason to stay away from this restaurant.  Another thing disappointing about the restaurant is the irregular way the food comes around. As we were paying, about an hour after we sat down, some carts came around with new foods we hadn't seen before, and some of it looked better than what was available to us in the past 60 minutes.

Feeling like I had a lead on the real thing, I called Phoenix and made the reservation. When we arrived-early on a Sunday evening-we received a friendly greeting and were taken to our table. There were four of us, and we had already made arrangements for the duck when we made the reservation. For appetizers we ordered spring rolls, crab rangoons, and fried dumplings. The spring rolls were flat and a little on the tough side. The other two items weren't anything special. When the duck arrived, it was carved tableside by one server, and placed into the pancakes with hoisin and scallions by another. The remaining duck was taken back to the kitchen to be turned into the second course.  The duck in the first course was lukewarm, a little tough, and the pancakes had a noticeable raw flour taste. Underwhelming is probably the best way to describe that course. Round two featured the rest of the duck, chopped and sauteed with garlic, scallions and crispy rice noodles. This was served on lettuce wrappers. The second course was tastier-and warmer-than the first. It wasn't really worth the hour-long drive. The atmosphere didn't do anything to enhance the experience. There wasn't any music, the lighting was bright fluorescent, and the decor consisted mostly of Tsingtao and Lee Kum Kee paper lanterns hung from the ceiling. All of that would have been easy to overlook if the main point of our going there-the crispy duck-had been what we have been trying to find.",0.9822,0.853,0.111,0.036,0.4862504162504164
2011-02-15,4.0,"My husband and I love dim sum. We've tried out a few other places around Chinatown - Happy Chef, Triple Crown and Shui Wah. And amongst these 4 places, we ALWAYS return to Phoenix! Happy Chef was our worst experience. Triple Crown and Shui Wah just didn't have the quality of taste that Phoenix gave. What's good there? These are the usual items we order: Malay Cake, Har Gao (shrimp dumpling), Steamed pork ribs in black bean sauce, and Carrot cake (super good!). Recently we tried the egg tart and found that it was good too. The best of the best would be the bean curd but that's only served on weekends. SADLY so, because weekday the crowd isn't that bad. Weekends, the crowd is INSANE. and because the place is not very organized, it's rather chaotic when you step through the glass doors on the ground floor. You have people queuing up on every single space you can imagine even on the stairs leading to the restaurant. For that, we'd rather visit it on weekdays. And for that, I took away a star.  Also, on weekdays, you can place orders. Weekends, it's the usual style of pushing the cart from table to table. That can get really slow and annoying especially when your stomach is growling loudly.",-0.6862,0.829,0.084,0.087,0.5965167548500884

2011-02-02,2.0,"I'll start out by saying this place used to be ""the place"" to go for dim sum and for dinner. As the different selections increased in Chinatown, Phoenix failed to keep up with the times, so it was a pretty disappointing experience when we went there for dinner a week ago.  About the only thing good about this place was the service. The decor is old and outdated; clearly that's not a priority on their list. I was hoping having good food may be higher on that list, but the food was disappointing as well. We ordered the Peking Duck as the appetizer. The wrapped duck portion was ok, but the stir-fry portion was definitely over-cooked and lacked flavor. The sweet and sour pork and vegetable dishes we ordered were over-cooked as well. We also got the scallops with garlic and rice noodles, and that was actually not bad...however, they charge $9.50 per scallop.  That's right. You read this correctly. $9.50 per scallop. Whereas other restaurants in the area charge $3.00 for a giant scallop, this place tripled the price. In fact, everything was over-priced at this place...which, would make you wonder where does all that money go if they are not spending it on the decor or on making good food.  To be honest, the only reason this place still stays in business is probably because it is a tourist trap. It's at a good, centralized location, and it has an English name that is easy to remember. For everybody else, you can pass this place right up as it is clearly a ""has-been"" that is on it's way to closing it's doors (hopefully).",0.9863,0.809,0.153,0.038,0.5630952380952382

The staff and the management were very nice and very accommodating throughout the whole event.  But the main event, and why people were really there, was for the food. This is a once a year event and something I always look forward to. Phoenix had put out an awesome, I mean AWESOME !!! Chinese New Year Spread consisting of a 14 course meal.  Holy shit !!!  If that's not enough to make one shit in your pants from too much gorging !!!!   We had Pecking Duck, Mongolian Beef, Gigantic Shrimp, Sea Bass, and so on.  When we where all full and thought that was all the food, still more food came out.  They were not at all skimpy with the food either.  The food was hot and fresh and ohhhh so good.  I was so glad to take home all the left overs; its been 5 days since the event and Im still enjoying the left overs. When I think of Great Chinese Food, I think of China Town and of course Phoenix Restaurant.   One of the best place around  for great Chinese Food.   I Also Recommend  Joy Yee's in China Town  (read my review) and don't forget to bring your appetite !!!",0.9975,0.746,0.226,0.028,0.4657478805916307

Anything after that on Sundays, be prepared for a wait. But if you have a large group, reservations are the way to go.  I've always had friendly service here. They are very good about refilling water and bringing fresh tea.  Sometimes the hostess seems a little frazzled, but who can blame her with the masses of people that descend on this place on Sundays.  Sometimes it's a little hard for me to understand the sweet ladies that push the dim sum carts, but I find that smiling and gesturing to see what lies in the bamboo steam bowls work just fine.  Don't let the carts pass you buy just because of a slight language barrier,  you might just miss a tasty morsel.  I love the steamed BBQ Pork buns, the shrimp dumplings, fried crabclaws,shrimp and green pepper and congee. I try to make a point to have those every time I'm there.  Sometimes you see the same cart roll by a few times before some new items make their appearance.  To me, that's what makes it fun--the oohs and ahhs and ""yes, please, we'll take one"" when a cart comes by.  Some items we tried that we usually don't get--the fried chicken wings and the hot dog wrapped in Chinese bread roll.  Despite the moanings from my dining pals that they were full, somehow the plates were cleaned.  (Yes, I'm looking at you David G and Sheryl)  Desserts are good too--my favorite is the almond jello with fruit cocktail.

I go dimsum at least twice a month, and my hubby and I leave always happy with good food.  With less than $50, two of us can enjoy many kinds of dimsum!  Among all, I love Hagao (steamed shrimp dumpling), pan-fried shrimp dumpling with chive, silky tofu, shaolongpau (pork dumpling with hot soup inside), and ... and... and... I guess it's safe to say that I love everything except chicken feet.  lol. Their dinner menu is very good, too.  This tofu dish with veggetable, OMG, it melts in my mouth.  Peking duck is ,,,ok, maybe the top notch here, but definitely different from beijing style.  If you are not scared of having shrimp with heads, try the twice-cooked shrimp.   I give 4.5 star to Phoenix.  I took 0.5 points off because their mapo tofu is not szechuan at all (I go to Lao Szechuan for that), and their fried rice is not consistent.  Sometimes it's really good, and sometimes not.  I am serious, it has been consistantly inconsistent!!  I don't like it that I almost feel like betting whenever my hubby orders it.

They mainly cater to large parties of people but I've seen many occasions with couples and singles enjoying the cuisine. One thing people must realize with Dim Sum is if some dishes have been on the cart around the restaurant they will cool off. Sometimes this happens but the food is so good when it does I don't mind.

2010-09-06,3.0,"Phoenix is quite well known, by now, for their dim sum.  Yes, waits can be crazy on weekends. And it doesn't help that Chinese people are not very good at estimating wait times.  This probably stems from the fact that Chinese people are typically late to everything.  You know how most restaurants overestimate your wait time (1 hour probably = 20 minutes)? In Chinese restaurants you'll probably notice that there is only one wait time they ever give you: 15 minutes. It's the Chinese way.  Unwilling to gamble with your time?  Try Happy Chef, Mayflower, or Shui Wah. Anyway, the food is good for Chicago, not the best dim sum ever, but in Chicago it is considered good.  The service has improved over the years, to cater to their more diverse clientele -- and they even offer a picture menu now.  If you don't see something offered on one of the rolling carts, you can usually order it from the kitchen -- but sadly I have not had good experiences with doing so -- usually the item tastes stale, and not freshly made, like you might think. I'd recommend the following dim sum items, if you want to be more adventurous than the usual shu-mai and shrimp dumplings: - Nio Bai Yeh/Beef Tripe (sounds gross, but it's seasoned really well and the texture is crispy/chewy) - Ja Leurng (it's a chinese fried dough wrapped with sticky rice paper) - Cha Sao So (the inside is bbq pork, the outside is flaky baked deliciousness -- the better-known, steamed bun version of this is also delicious) - Yu Tou Jiao (taro and pork wrapped in flakes and deep fried -- it has the consistency of deep fried carpet, but it is addicting, TRUST!)

2010-07-27,2.0,"my first experience with dim sum was here. but as i've continued to go back, i get more and more disappointed. the dim sum tastes okay.  not bad, but not amazing.  here's the thing. your seating can dictate your entire experience here. the servers come out in waves. they do not necessarily tend to every table. they'll hit bigger tables with larger groups, but if your back is turned towards them they will NOT come up to you. Waiting for a cart with an item you might want to try is like waiting for lightning to strike. You'll stare at the menu and visualize it in your mind.   You can wait and wait and wait and if you're lucky, the cart with your dish may come to you.  If you're super unfortunate, the cart with your dish could get to you..... but then they might have run out of what you wanted.   I'm like 4'10 so I can't eat a whole lot. which makes me picky, since what I DO get, i have to make sure i'm satisifed with. but i've gone to phoenix and waited and waited and waited.  There have even been times where i just request the dish to be made (without waiting for the carts) and it would STILL take an excessively long time to receive. service is a nightmare. Yes the servers come around with carts. But all they'll cater to is putting a dish on your table and running as fast as they can away from you.  Good luck finding someone for extra napkins. Or soy sauce. Or a drink refill. I've never known this place to have a single waiter assigned to my table.  The worst hit: paying to get the hell out. 15 minutes from being completely done eating just to receive the check. then another 15 minutes and no one even returned to the table to see if our payment was ready.  So my bf and I walked towards the exit, uninterrupted.  We waited for 5 minutes near the door exit before some hostess arrives to our now-empty-table and looks around frantically for us.  We wave her down and apologize ""Sorry, I just can't keep waiting any longer."" Again, the food isn't so bad.  But their cart routes are terribly coordinated and their service is otherwise really far from attentive. Like chickens scrambling around unless they have a cart to ground them down.

I'm doing mah own thang. . . which is stamping this spot with just three stars. I only want to give it two! Let me tell you my story. Once upon a Saturday bright,  I hurried to Phoenix with all my might. Upon my late arrival there,  I saw the main table had no empty chair. At another table I then sat, but quickly wondered where the food was at. The other table had food o'plenty, while our lazy susan laid so empty. To the other table the waiter often would go, but attention on us he would barely bestow.  Then annoyed I began to grow. When the last people did arrive, to order directly we did strive. Spent effort and time on what to choose, but only to later be greeted by the blues. The lady in black who took our order card, treated us with such rude regard. She completely forgot what she did, and spoke to me as if I were a kid.  Pissed off I then became, the lady in black is all to blame.  So, I will say that our waiter did make a point to apologize to me for her behavior. Which is why I'm giving three stars instead of two. However, I believe that lady is a manager/owner/something since she was in plain clothes instead of a uniform. Her, the lack of items on the menu, the lack of attention my table received for a while, and the lack of yummy factor of the custard rolls make me not want to return. Since I dislike Phoenix, AZ, the band Phoenix, and Joaquin Phoenix too, it seems to remain the only phoenix I care for is the fiery mystical bird.

Otherwise, well, my advice to you is to go out a bit, read books, watch movies and GET A LIFE.) I didn't exactly go to such extremes last Saturday - I am good at self-containing around people. Had I been alone, things would have been slightly different but I have a lady-like reputation to keep. So I kept the lazy susan moving, picked a few items here and there and did a pretty good job at (moderately) stuffing my face without being noticed.

It's a little more complicated than that, I imagine. While the offerings weren't the best I've had in Chicago (although they're very very good), the service was the best I have had in any dim sum experience. Our reservation was honored right on time.

And while my family and I were formerly consistent patrons on our bi-weekly Chinatown treks, over the years it has dwindled to a halt.  You initially walk in to the ground floor sub-lobby. You can either walk up the single flight of stairs, or wait in the inevitable line for the semi-sketchy elevator. As soon as the elevator doors open up, you find yourself in the upstairs lobby, as well as that of a giant dining room.  The food is very good, the dishes are tasteful and clean looking -- it shows that they have a deliberate care in mind for the aesthetics. And furthermore, this is definitely one of the cleanest restaurants in Chinatown. With its nice views from the second story, to the clean bathrooms -- which to be honest, is actually very nice for Dim Sum and China Town first-timers.  It's pitfalls though are primarily within the cost and portion size to which they deliver you. The service is scarce and waiting lines get tedious, especially since they often reach a highpoint of 45 minutes to and hour and a half on weekends.  A standout dim sum dish though, is that of bamboo flowers that have been stuffed with shrimp. It is by far my favorite and a spectacular dish to boot. If you ever stop by you are required to consume this dish. The Phoenix is the only restaurant to have it in all of Chinatown and it is a dish that will inevitably bring you back here, if not for this one alone. The non Dim Sum dishes are very traditional Cantonese dishes, which is very nice, especially since we all live in a world of over-diluted Americanized Chinese restaurants on every street corner.  To sum it up, The Phoenix is good but not great. It's clean, it's pricey, the food is not as generous and the staff not as attentive.",0.8847,0.88,0.088,0.032,0.6578988095238094

2009-08-27,5.0,Eat the head... I was fortunate enough to receive an invitation to an engagement dinner party at the Phoenix.  I arrived fresh and clean dressed for success as we were about to embark on a twelve course feast.   The scene was elegant and classy.  All the tables were prepared with a flourishing center piece and rotating centers which made dining a delight.  Each table seated 8-10 guests in the upstairs banquet room.  The view was glorious overlooking Chinatown square and the Chicago skyline. Dinner began with a Fresh shrimp fruit salad.  The shrimp was of the highest quality and surprisingly large.  The fruit was crisp yet juicy complimented with a light sweet sauce for a fantastic starting dish.   The salad didn't last long but don't worry because the Golden fried crab claws were working their way to the table.  Wow this was the best crab ever.  The claw was sticking out from the fried crab ball nice touch.  I would have to say this was my favorite from the twelve items served. At this point I still did not realize how much more food was about to arrive.  To my pleasing a large plate of Sautée scallops with X.O specially sauce presented itself.  I was hypnotized by it's luring aroma.  The taste was a sparkling infusion of orgasmic flavors with a supple texture and immaculate glazing.  Shark fin soup I was waiting for this.  Very well made this was only my second time eating shark fin soup.  This was slightly different than the other one I tried but Phoenix has a very good crabmeat shark fin soup.  The soup was really rich and arrived at the perfect time.   Abalone with pea spouts:  They look like little pancakes on pea sprouts.  I thought is was OK a nice complementary dish.   Crispy Chicken was served this was my second favorite dish.  To my curiosity I was looking at the chicken because something didn't look right.  Then I realized the Chickens head was on the plate and it was looking at me.  The others tried to convince me to EAT THE HEAD but I did not.  Despite my amusement with the head this is truly some of the best chicken I have ever tasted.   Onion baked whole lobster are you kidding me.  The gourmet entrees kept on coming.  I have only tried american style lobster in the past.  I'm now officially a fan of Chinese style lobster.  The flavor is superior to the  bland butter dripped lobster I was accustomed too.  The lobster was slightly smaller but more than made up for it in flavor.   After the lobster a fish crashed our feast.  The Steamed fresh fish of the day sorry I don't know what it was but it did have a head.  The fish complimented the lobster very nicely and the lobster said thank you very much.   Dinner wouldn't be complete without Yang Chow fried rice.  Fluffy rice not too oily just right.  I was getting the sense that desert was on its way.  Soup is served.  I didn't expect more soup since we had the shark fin soup.  The soup was the Shrimp dumplings in e-fu noodle soup.  I was unexpectedly delighted the soup was fantastic.   The evening was coming to a close and desert was finally served.  The first desert course was the Red bean sweet soup.  It tasted better than it looked and I'm not a big fan of bean.  Then the petite cakes and sweets arrived.  To be honest I felt they had little flavor much different from European style deserts. I left the Phoenix thoroughly satisfied.  I was able to have an experience of a lifetime with great food and wonderful people.  The party was garnished with Pina coladas and Chinese beer.  Every one seemed to have a blast especially the guests singing Chinese Karaoke.   During the festivities I was able to capture the essence the the dinner with my Sony Cybershot.  A Picture is worth a thousand words and I have posted them for your viewing pleasure.

2009-07-10,4.0,"Dim Sum: One of the best places in Chinatown for dim sum.  To people unfamiliar, I always say that dim sum is ""Chinese tapas.""  Wait on the weekends (around 12noon) is usually 30-45 minutes depending on the size of your table.  Try to go early. The restaurant is on the 2nd floor and it quite large.  All tables get their choice of hot tea.  Good staples are jasmine or chrysanthemum.  The ladies with the food carts come by quite frequently with a good variety of dishes.  The ladies try, but not all of them speak the best english, so they may not be the best at explaining things ""try it, it's good!""  So if you are adventurous, go ahead try everything. If not, if it looks like chicken feet, it IS chicken feet (but try it, it really IS delicious!).  Eyes can get bigger than stomachs though, since everything looks small, but it adds up! Make sure to leave room for dessert, they usually have 3-4 kinds.  The soft tofu with the water syrup is the best!  You also don't have to order just dim sum, you can ask for a menu and they will make things for you in the back, i.e. a noodle or rice dish. Dinner: They aren't known as well for their dinners, but I was here for a wedding banquet about a month ago and almost all dishes were delicious.  About 10 courses - they had to roll me out at the end.  The only thing bad was the soy sauce noodles at the end, they were very plain and didn't have a lot of flavor.  Lucky for me, our table only had 8 people instead of 10 so I got to take 1/2 a lobster home with me. Street & meter parking is virtually impossible on the weekends for dim sum.  Evenings are a little better.  You can try your luck and circle around the residential area that's behind Chinatown square (but you'll be wasting your time).  Just grin and take it and park in one of the 2 pay lots.  I believe they validate.  Make a day of it and walk around both Chinatown Square and Wentworth when you are done to pick up some cheap Chinese stuff you'd pay triple for at trendy furniture stores.",0.9936,0.825,0.139,0.036,0.536784791435954
2009-07-10,1.0,"Ok, this restaurant made me to log in the YELP.  First of all, it's very negative. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!  I'm not going back that restaurant EVER!!! I went  this place for brunch today, which is July,10,09, Friday.  with my mom, brother, my baby girl and my friend and her 2 kids. I'm a big fan of Dim sum. Every time I can get a chance to go eat dim sum, I'm ( well, I should say 'was' ) thrilled!! We ordered at least 18 dishes and as usual, we were enjoying our delicious food.  Until we found out there was a piece of STAPLE!!!!!! My brother just pulled it out from his mouth while he was eating fried squid. well, people, I'm telling you, I've occasionally experienced hairs, bugs, flies from the authentic food. But Come on!!! A STAPLE???? So, I called waiter, he said  'What do you want me to do with it?' with that attitude and his position of the restaurant, it wasn't worth to fight with him, so we asked him to bring a manager. She brought that EVIDENCE; a piece of staple in the kitchen and told us she would tell a chef.  Wait a minute!!  They don't even feel embarrassed or even didn't say ' I'm sorry'. I couldn't believe their attitude of that incident.  I've worked in a restaurant in the past for a part-time, and whenever that kind of things happen, I wasn't told that we should be ignorant and act like it's happening all the time!  The manager came to us and said if we want to complain, there's owner in the front desk, so go and complain. We did!! we went to front desk and told him about what happened. What he said was unbelievable. I just couldn't believe that kind of person is running a restaurant.  He said  "" I'm not gonna charge for that. so we are good, right?"" with that arrogant pose and acting like 'he's busy, don't bother me' attitude. I couldn't just go away with it. I've told him ""'you are the owner of this restaurant, and we are regular customer. Is that how you treat your customer?.""  He seemed pretty shocked, maybe he didn't expect that Asian woman would speak out in that way??  And then his answer banged my head, he said "" This things happen all the time. You will understand me. and I will not charge you tea, either.""  He even gives business card and saying ""Next time, when you come we will give you discount.""  All those time, his attitude was bugging me so bad !! EEUK!!  What's up with his work ethic???  Well, I don't know about everything on restaurant business BUT at least it's common sense that customer should be treated respectfully. Also, they should be ashamed of having dirty restaurant hygiene. I'm really curious how come that staple could enter the fried squid!!  All in all, I don't necessarily want to be minus effect on their business but I think they should take responsible for it. In fact, they've earned it.

2009-06-24,4.0,"Phoenix is an interesting entity because it's more than just a one trick pony.  Most people associate it with dim sum, and depending on your personal preference of foods, you just may find something there that you enjoy. For example, my latest trip this past weekend included items of: bbq pork buns, deep fried shrimp wrapped in seaweed, lots of shumai, dumplings, pot stickers, and other doughy items, tripe, and of course my favorite cultural item that's not too terrible to eat - chicken feet.   I'm not trying to toot my own horn here, but I would highly recommend that if you go with a group of friends, that you take one native speaker with you.  Or at least someone who can ask questions in Cantonese or Mandarin.  I don't claim to be a native speaker, though I was born in Taiwan; however, I'm conversationally fluent and can discuss food options.  Don't ask me about nuclear physics, or even what I do for a living because I'd really have to search for the words, but food...I'm ok. Service has gotten much better here over the past few months.  The horde of waiters and hosts were quick to refill both water and hot tea, and when a glass of water was haphazardly spilled by a dining mate, they were right there to clean it up.  Of course, I appreciate the paper tablecloths, because inevitably some clumsy oaf will get sauce on it, or spill something, or make an all around mess.   Dinner/Entree options aren't bad either.  It's definitely pricier than dim sum, but you can get a table side Peking duck service at reasonable prices.  Notice I didn't say, ""reasonable by Chinatown standards"" pricing - think more of Red Light when you think of Peking Duck service prices and you won't get a case of sticker shock.  Their sizzling rice/meat dishes are consistently well-cooked, as is their eggplant.   The only thing that I would recommend is to carefully choose the time you come for dim sum.  Anything past noon or 12:30 and you'll be struggling to find a seat right away.  Anything before 11:00 and not all of the delicious items are out and about on the carts yet.  The sweet spot is probably 11:15 or 11:30.  After you get seated and get some initial food, you can probably wait around for items such as bbq ribs, etc.  Just a thought.",0.9902,0.85,0.121,0.03,0.5412103174603174
2009-06-24,5.0,"Good Dim Sum in New York City is virtually impossible to find.  Whether the applications are over salted, over sauced, or over applied with MSG, the trend is common.  Ultimately, Dim Sim has been the scour of the Chinese community and embraced by tourists alike. Of course, being presented with the opportunity to consume Dim Sum on a completely ubiquitous front is one that cannot be overlooked.  After discussions with friends in Chicago as well as Rachel, it was decided that Phoenix Restaurant is THE hot spot for Dim Sum in Chinatown, Chicago, IL.  With that in mind, we're off to consume the Chinese version of Tapas. The Decor:  There's little that needs to be mentioned regarding the setting of Phoenix Restaurant.  As with most other Chinese establishment, the typical white table cloth, flimsy chairs, and Chinese spirit statues are on full display.  Of course, not taking away from the interior design of the establishment, one must note that the set up (specifically table spacing) made the restaurant appear vast and open.  More importantly, the establishment was remarkably clean, with little debris on floors.  Not to mention the restrooms are well maintained and inspected throughout the day. The Food:  A note on the Dim Sum.  Since Rachel and I dined on a Friday morning, Dim Sum is ordered via menu and brought out directly from the kitchen.  The Dim Sum carts are not operational for this time, which is a good thing.  One other note that needs to be mentioned, each of the following individual Dim Sum dishes tasted remarkably fresh.  In a manner of comparison, the taste of each of the offerings had a slight representation that each of the dishes were made earlier during the day and steamed to order.  Unlike the use of the Dim Sum carts, which excessively steams the food, the made to order dishes provided the probably cooking temperature and texture. Fried Dumplings:  Perfectly cooked and luscious!  The slightly charred exterior provided the mild smoky flavor for this application.  The noodle wrapping contained the perfect density, which worked to introduce the savory pork meat confined in the application.  Accompanied with the tangy soy sauce, the dumplings provide a remarkable balance of saltiness and density. Shrimp Wrapped Flat Noodles:  Remarkable execution in cooking and flavor.  Patrons will find that the noodles are perfectly cooked.  The subtle softness of the noodle produces a profound comfort when consumed.  The warmth derived from the noodle accompanied by the subtly smooth texture provides the principle of a well steamed noodle.  The shrimp used in the application were juicy and contained a sweet texture found through proper cooking.  The mild sweet soy sauce served with the dish acts as a binding agent for the noodles and shrimp as this further enhanced the texture and flavor of the ingredients. Har Gow (Shrimp Dumplings):  Similar to the Shrimp Wrapped Flat Noodles, this rendition emphasized the shrimp as the main ingredient, instead of the noodle.  The juicy and tender nature of the shrimp exemplified a perfectly cooked Har Gow.  During consumption, patrons will find nothing but a perfect balance between the soft texture of the noodle wrap coating and the shrimp used in the application. Fried Rolled Rice Noodles:  Similar to the Flat Noodles, this application possessed the mild texture contrast that helps bring out the flavors of the noodles.  The noodles were mildly salt, but were balanced out by the sweet BBQ and Peanut Sauce mix for which it was accompanied.  Patrons will discover that the textural contrast allows for the crispy noodles to have a more pungent flavor, which introducing the soft and velvety texture.. Steamed Buns w/ Red Bean Paste:  Perfect texture and accompanying flavor complements.  The buns provided a nice starchy flavor while accompanied by a mild sweetness.  The red bean paste within the buns interior further emphasizes the mild sweetness of the application.  Most notable attribute of this dish is the texture of the bun.  Perfectly soft, but enough to hold its contents. Shumai:  Meaty & hearty!  The petite yellow wonton wrapper played an intricate role to the introduction of the pork and shrimp used in the application.  With each bite, the savory and luscious flavors derived from the juices of the meat work to enhance the flavors of both the pork and shrimp used in the application.  Most important regarding this Shumai, true ingredients used in the application, no fillers. Beef Balls:  Hearty!  Each individual Beef Ball provided the satiety that's found through its consumption.  The texture of the meet was semi-soft, thus indicating the proper balance of fatty / lean beef used in the application. Notes on Phoenix: 1) Total Bill = $36.00 (After Tax & Tip) 2) Service was speedy, then again, it was Friday morning 3) Water and Tea were refilled constantly",0.9973,0.887,0.107,0.006,0.4986465781409602

Maybe it was because we showed up really early (wanted to make sure we were able to grab decent bleacher seats at the Cubs game).  We asked for fried rice, but that wasn't ready to be ordered yet.  A slow trickle of food made their way to our area, but it wasn't the onslaught of selection we were used to at other places. I will give props for the food we did get.  The shomai, my favorite dish at dim sums, was a good size and terrifically meaty.  They also had a dish that my sister and I got crazy excited for when we saw wheeled out - baked BBQ pork buns.  They don't have these at Jockey.  I'd give this place 5 stars alone for that if it wasn't for the fact we were in Chinatown and could hit up a nearby bakery pretty easily.  Still, it was a great treat to see.

2009-01-26,2.0,okay - you have you take for granted that i've moved from san francisco - where dim sum is something you find on nearly every street corner - kind of like how you find a mcdonalds on every corner here in chicago - but this dim sum really sucked.  the 2 things i desperately wanted - and dragged my bf - down to chinatown was for the taro root and custard tarts. they didn't have any. i was so sad. i love dim sum. i used to go to dim sum nearly once a week.  the wait was at least 45mins and the food wasn't great. not really sure its worth it...,-0.8839,0.713,0.11,0.177,0.5545751633986928

The basic steamed big mouth bass (purportedly caught fresh out of Lake Michigan) had great tender flaky meat, but the flavor was... fishy.  Not in a bad way.  Just not in a way that indicated it was prepared very well. The two plates of greens - gai lan (Chinese broccoli) and dou miao (pea shoots) - were pretty measly portions.  Especially considering each one was at least $13 a pop.  Seriously?!

The only drawback is that it's a little bit pricey, but the food and excellent service are well worth it.  The staff is extremely accommodating, especially for how hectic Chinese restaurants get on a dim sum morning.",0.9699,0.814,0.186,0.0,0.6512857142857144

The Peking duck is served as two courses; first they cut off the breast meat and serve it in pancakes with plum sauce and scallions. Then the rest of the duck goes back to the kitchen where it is chopped up and stir-fried with veggies and brought back mixed with crispy noodles and served in individual lettuce leaves. The black bean shrimp was not as good, but still better than most. The service was incredibly efficient, considering that the place was packed with large extended families of Jews (like us) out for Christmas Eve dinner.

The dishes were either steamed and bland or fried and oversalted (as was the case with the fried octopuses), so take your pick.

They push carts here - which is amusing if you're a tourist/never seen it before, but not so much when you just want food. . There seem to be only 2 master carts - unclear how they set up the cart-pushing hierarchy, but I swear, there are only 2 popular women in this restaurant and they're the ones shoving around all the ""regular"" items . The xiao long bao (soup dumplings) are not terrible for Chicago, or for the US in general.  Despite being big and prone to skin-break, the meaty part was ok-tasty.  Perhaps my bar was too low, but it was not bad. . They have dan-tah (egg custard tarts) here.  These were actually really really good.  The crust was flaky and not solid, adding to the appeal. Overall I think Phoenix has some items that Happy Chef doesn't and each does a few things/dishes better than the other, but it's just really hard to get food at this place b/c of the 2 master cart reason.  Be prepared to wait when those 2 lovely ladies don't swing by.",0.9698,0.771,0.15,0.079,0.5589414858645628

2007-12-21,4.0,"I have eaten dim sum in San Francisco, New York, and Chicago, and this is my favorite (actually, the best was in a northern suburb of Michigan, of all places).  THE LOCATION - First, it is a BIG Chinese restaurant.  They serve a LOT of people during the weekend (busiest time).  If you get there at 11AM (when it starts), you'll get a seat and it's not an issue.  Any time after that, expect a wait of 30-45 min.   DIM SUM FOR DUMMIES - Okay so what is dim sum?  For all you non-asians, this is bascially a brunch served on rolling steam carts.  You sit at your table, you WAIT for the cart to come by, then you pick and choose what you want to eat, either by name or looking at it.  I know most of it, but I like to look.   Food is either steamed, fried, or in a small dish (like a bowl of fried rice or noodles).  The fried or small dish stuff you can see right away and you know what it is.  Fried can be an eggroll type dish OR a dessert, so ASK.   The items in little round containers (metal or bamboo) are steamed.  They hold enough to taste for 3-4, share for 2, or as half a meal for 1.  Standards are siu mai (shoe-my, a very tasty pork dumpling) and har gow (shrimp dumpling) and chicken feet.  Why chicken feet?  Why do you eat wings?  Same reason, they are tasty and you can flavor them.  Why am I listing it as a standard?  Because they are tasty.  Am I, like, a Fear Factor finalist?  Oh yeah, bring on any kinda foot, just make it tasty. But seriously, most things on the cart are made of: bean curd, vegetable, meat or fish, meat or fish wrapped in bean curd or vegetable.  Some of the things on the menu are: - Ham & Chicken wrapped in bean curd (tasty!) - Stuffed bean curd (also tasty!) - Stuffed rice wrapped in Lotus leaf (tasty!) - Curried baby octopus (racquetball of the sea!) - Curried whole squid (chewy!) - Char siu (bbq pork) - Roast duck - Sliced Jellyfish (like eating a plate of rubberbands) - Steam spare ribs in black bean sauce (ok) - Fried shrimp balls (big and tasty!) - Fried crab claws (also big & tasty, like the shrimp with claws sticking out) - Green pepper stuffed with shrimp - Char siu bao (bbq pork in a sweet steam rice bun) - warning - if you eat them you won't be able to eat anything else.  But they are GOOD... THE STUFF I WON'T EAT - Radish Cake.  Yes, it is made from a vegetable.  Yes, I eat radishes, and cake, but not TOGETHER.  This dish has its own cart.  It is made from radishes (big daikon type), a little ham, and flour.  It smells like sweaty FEET and damn near taste like it.  It has the CONSISTENCY of coagulated library paste.  Now, peasant food is one thing, but MAN, I cannot stomach this.  Yet each time I go, people continue to eat this.   OTHER DIM-SUM -  Congee - no, not a snake or a fish from the deep, but simply a rice porridge.  Don't eat this unless you want to waste stomach space.  It is good with ginger, green onion and sliced fish, if you are sick. Sweet tofu - okay, this is in a big wooden barrel thingy.  It hold hot, homemade tofu, and they put a simple syrup in it.  It's good, but plain. Almond tofu - almond flavored jello with fruit and milk.  I can eat this ALL DAY.  Great way to end a meal. Mango custard - Mango pudding, not very good, orange, looks cool, kinda pasty.

To be totally honest, on this particular Sunday I was incredibly grateful for a non fancy-eggs-french-toast-chicken-sausage brunch option.  The place was bustling hardcore on a Sunday morning at 11:30. My dining partner knew the ropes, which was helpful. We didn't have to wait, which was welcome and unexpected.  I would say the 'Sum was decent, but not extraordinary. They did keep the carts acomin', and there were many many options, but nothing haunts my dreams with its deliciousness.   Total bonus: you can order whatever tea you want! We had jasmine, which was great, but how do you screw up tea?  I'm beginning to think I have a problem with... understanding stairs? Suffice to say: go up the stairs on your left as you enter to get to the restaurant.    If you want to, you can ask the ladies to show you the food before you sign on the dotted line. Like, to lift the lid off the little pots and such. Cuz the cart lady totally will, and then you learn that ""chicken feet"" are made of actual chicken feet.  Going to new places sometimes makes me want to double up on the Valium, but this one was easy to handle- it's conveniently located to the red line stop (like a block or so, at most, and clearly visible when you get off). Also, there was public Chinatown parking available for $3, as well as metered spaces. It was upscale-feeling enough that my persnickety family would have enjoyed it (except for the eating Dim Sum part).",0.9921,0.771,0.181,0.047,0.5479960899315738

2007-11-25,3.0,"At one point in my dining history with Phoenix in the last eight years I've been living in Chicago, it was a regular Saturday brunch spot for my roommates and my good friends.  We seemed to go almost every Saturday, and nobody seemed to mind.  That was about seven years ago, and although I've cut down my dim sum addiction quite a bit, I'd still go once a month or so.   However, the relationship steadily slid downhill as the years wore on -- the wait seemed to get longer and more hectic and the service becoming even more spotty, and other dim sum alternatives were working harder to win me over.   Then, this Saturday, as I caught a cold stare from my wife as I found myself spending more time craning my neck to catch the carts as they were consistently being routed away from my aisle and trying to flag down a waiter for a refill, than to actually EAT, I knew that this was the final straw.   It's perhaps not as much Phoenix, that it forgot about the lil' ol me, but the fact that it's a victim of its own success.  Perhaps even a mound of scathing reviews won't halt the steadily increase in the patrons still in their honeymoon phase with their own dim sum dining rituals. If you're like me, however, and you've been served one too many cold, hardened ""sticky"" noodles (it gets that way by the time the cart makes the round on the dining hall), it's probably time to give up a little bit of the (sometimes genuinely fun) cart-in-the-aisle experience for the order-by-menu convenience and consistency from other places. Dining experience at Phoenix really depends on how fast you were seated, and where you're seated.  You can control the first by showing up EARLY (before 11AM for sure), but the latter, no.  Unfortunately, the food quality and your dining experience (food coming to you, rather than your eyes tracking after carts going the wrong way) really depends on latter.   Still give it above-average rating for dim sum in Chicago (hey, it's not Vancouver or Hong Kong, and NOTHING will change that in the near future), since for the diners on the first leg of their dim sum journey, for the better or worse, Phoenix is still a rite of passage.",0.4767,0.901,0.053,0.046,0.45803846153846145

I had been looking forward to this experience all week, as I had dim sum on one prior occasion and LOVED it. I guess the dim sum I had before was very Americanized (it was called Dim Sum and Then Some, in Albequerque) because I had no idea what I was getting myself into at this place. If you want authentic Chinese dim sum, I suppose you would like this place. I am giving it three stars solely because my boyfriend and his family really enjoyed it. They are Indian and have traveled all over the world, and are very adventurous eaters. Kudos to them! They eagerly devoured the chicken feet, pig intestines, pig stomach, and beef tendons while I smiled awkwardly, feeling as though I was watching an episode of Fear Factor. The first thing I tried was the bean curd. My boyfriend's mother insisted I would enjoy it.  Perhaps I would have, if I didn't put such a big piece in my mouth. It was slippery, greasy, slimy, and very hot. Also, my appetite was somewhat ruined by the bowl of juicy red chicken toes directly in front of me. The next thing I tried was the eggplant. I was excited about that, because I love eggplant. Learning from my bean curd experience, I took a small bite and chewed thoughtfully, while my boyfriend and his mother closely watched my facial expression. I struggled to swallow it. I do love eggplant. Honestly. But not when it tastes as though it has been marinated in fish guts for 3 months. Ugh. Next.  The rest of my meal was good though. I liked the lotus paste, the shrimp spring rolls, and the vegetable spring rolls (even though they were a bit greasy...I guess that is the nature of dim sum). Overall, I would recommend this place to those who enjoy dim sum, but I want to throw a word of caution out there to people who are pickier eaters. Don't be afraid to try new things...but don't shove a huge piece in your mouth when you have no clue what it is. It may taste like fish guts.",0.9665,0.837,0.12,0.043,0.4989177489177488

My Hong Kong sidekick best friend's favorite are: shrimp rice roll and turnip cake.   Her husband loves: black bean garlic steamed sparerib, BBQ pork pastry.

2007-06-27,4.0,"All I have to say is if you decide to eat dim sum at Phoenix on a weekday, do so at your own risk.  Here's why: Unlike during the weekend, they don't push around the dim sum carts during the week.  Consequently, if you go during the week you have to order off of a menu, which just so happens to have lots of pretty pictures of delicious looking dim sum dishes like siao mai's (steamed pork dumplings) and lo buo gao (fried turnip cakes).   As you start to write down how many servings of each dish you want, you start to worry that you might be ordering too much food.  But then you rationalize how each dish usually only has three or four bite-sized pieces of food.  The more rationalizing you do, the better you feel, despite the fact that you've now ordered more or less half the items on the menu for your party of six.  The smart thing to do would be to count up all the dishes but that's far too much work for you and your hungry coworkers. As the food starts to come out one by one, your eyes get big and you start to get excited about all the tasty dim sum that you're about to eat.  You try some fried goodies here and some steamed goodies there and it all tastes so damn good.  As you happily stuff your face you realize that they're still bringing out dishes and you start to wonder, ""How much more food did we exactly order ...?""   Answer: Apparently a lot.   By the time all the dishes have come out, there is practically no free space on your table.  Your suddenly start feeling sorry for the guy who has to wash all these dishes later but then you snap back to reality and the task at hand.  You give it your best and start to inhale your food but the mountain of dim sum seems as ominous as ever.  30 minutes later, you feel dazed and confused, not to mention completely stuffed to the point where it hurts.   You sheepishly ask the servers to wrap your food up and you swear that they are looking down on you because, seriously, no one takes home a doggie bag of dim sum (the stuff just doesn't reheat that well).  You get the check and realize that despite the ginormous quantity of dim sum that you and your party have consumed, the final cost is barely $20 per person after tip.  Plus you have enough leftovers to last at least couple more meals. As you walk out the restaurant, you feel the onset of food coma and you think about how great it would be to take a nap.  But then you realize it's only 1:00 PM on a Wednesday and you have to get back to work.  Damn you Phoenix for making me order waaaay too much of your delicious dim sum because you don't push around carts during the week.
