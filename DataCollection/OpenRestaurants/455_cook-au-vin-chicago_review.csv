2017-04-28,5.0,"Went here last night with my mom. We had a fabulous time. Ryan was an excellent teacher and a lot of fun. We made broiled oysters which I didn't think I would like because I like them raw instead but they were delicious. The seafood gumbo with the rice was very good and I can't wait to try to make at home. My favorite was the pecan pie it was sooo delicious. Ryan taught us different skills to have in the kitchen (cutting skills, cleaning and opening oysters, etc.). I definitely recommend this place very intimate and the BYOB is an extra bonus. Definitely worth the money. Also, enough to take home leftovers",0.9915,0.668,0.309,0.023,0.6242628205128204

There was enough room in the kitchen for 12 of us but there was lots of standing around so consider reducing class sizes? This would be perfect for very laid back date, would probably rate this 4-5 stars, but if you are expecting to be cooking the whole time this is not the class for you. Ryan, the instructor, gave good directions but I did not really learn anything, could have just read a recipe (but to be fair I am very comfortable in the kitchen). Some of the things he said was a thin line between funny sarcasm and condescending, take that as you will... You have to somewhat interact with other people so it was a bit awkward in the beginning, but luckily it's BYOB and people are generally friendly. Probably more fun if you booked a private lesson with people you knew. The food we made was great, but not enough for everyone to take leftovers.

He leads the meal prep, gives you great cooking tips and basically sets up stations with tasks.  You can pitch in and help or kick back and sip on your wine. It's BYOB.  You can bring tupperware to pack leftovers to take home. The only downside is getting reservations for the Bordeaux Menu was difficult.  We had to book 2 months in advance just for a Wednesday night class, not even a weekend class.  You start at 6pm and end at 10pm.  You spend most of the time cooking and it's time and money well spent.",0.9646,0.791,0.161,0.048,0.5884615384615384
2017-02-13,5.0,"Cook Au Vin was the most fun I've had in a while.  Ryan, our cooking INSTRUCTOR, was sarcastic, witty and so fun. He was very informative, and made sure to show us the skills and then let us all practice. We learned knife skills (dicing an onion, mincing garlic, chopping celery), shucking skills (both corn and oysters), and life skills (adding a pound of butter makes everything taste delicious ;).  We participated in the Creole Cooking MENU. We started with Broiled Oysters, which was crazy. I've never eaten an oyster, let alone shucked and prepped it. Some of them had little crabs in it, which was hilarious. As a main we had a seafood gumbo, and the roux alone took almost an entire 3 hours so you know how fantastic that tasted. It was crammed with shrimp, sausage and crab meat. We topped it with a basmati rice and vegetable medley, which made it extra hearty. Last but not least was the pecan pie; heaven on earth, my friends!!  We attended on a night where the CLASS SIZE was 8, but they can get up to 12. Not everyone can try every last skill, but at least you're exposed to everything. Plus, they send the recipes through email, so it's easy to try again at a later date.  Pro Tip #1: BRING WINE. Classes are always more fun with wine involved.  Pro Tip #2: COME HUNGRY. They serve fresh baked bread and multiples cheeses before class even begins, and you will have a VERY hearty portion to try at the end of your four-hour class, too. Pro Tip #3: BRING TUPPERWARE. There are so many leftovers, and the instructor wants you to take it all home. It's a great lunch to make your coworkers jealous the following day. On the night we went, they even sent my friend home with a whole leftover pie crust! Pro Tip #4: CHECK GROUPON for deals. (Honestly though, Cook Au Vin is well worth the splurge even if they don't have something running through Groupon at the time.)

2017-02-12,1.0,"Sadly, this french cooking class was not a class at all. First of all the cook leading our class, Ryan, was not a chef nor was he trained in french cooking.  By his own admission, his culinary training included working in a kitchen as a child and reading Alton Brown cookbooks.  He held a degree in fine arts and journalism with no culinary training.  This was evident as the class progressed.  He did not have any knowledge of food science and could not answer a culinary related question aside from the menu. There was also very little hands on work by the attendees.  Ryan was not an instructor - he did not teach and allow us to complete the task.  He did most of the cooking himself instructing us to season and stir. He was not enthusiastic or  motivated to teach.  I also found it unprofessional that he was drinking wine and had a shot of whiskey during the class. The menu and cooking techniques led to an inconsistent meal.  The scallops were the highlight of the evening as they were sweet and well prepared.  The beef tenderloin, however, was put into a sous vide and did not have a good texture to it.  The meat ran blood red juices on the plate - very unappetizing.  The lack of steak knives made it difficult to cut.  The potatoes were excellent and the addition of asparagus to the meal helped to give it some color but one bunch of asparagus for 10 people was not enough.  At $240.00 a couple there should have been 3-4 bunches of asparagus to go around. Dessert consisted of pate a choux piped into hearts and filled with pastry creme.  This would have been better made into profiteroles as the choux did not expand enough to hold the pastry creme. The facility was also lacking in ventilation and space.  Each work station did not have it's own stove so we could not actually cook, only chop.  Ryan controlled the actual cooking.  Because there were no draw fans, when he heated the pans and filled the kitchen with smoke he had to open the front door as we were coughing from the fumes. Overall, very disappointing. My husband and I have attended many cooking classes for much less money and they have been in a better prepared kitchen and instructed by a trained chef that has attended and completed culinary school.  My suggestion for Cook au Vin is to hire chefs trained in french cooking to teach your classes or change your website to reflect the actual service being offered.",-0.4947,0.883,0.05,0.067,0.4682051282051282

This would have been okay if the chef was instructing as he went along but by the end of the ""class"" we didn't really know how the sauce was made. The potatoes even looked different... between the time when they were put on the stove to when they were served, the chef had added several ingredients while we were already eating at the table. He finished making the potato dish without telling the class what he was doing so you can only imagine how confused we were when we saw the potato dish on the table. The chef barely spoke to the group throughout the night and did not seem very prepared.  In a nutshell, I felt like it was more of a social event where someone just cooked for us. If I had wanted that, I would have hired a private chef and had a dinner party in my own home. I paid more for the end meal rather than the experience, which did not meet my expectations.

It is a pretty vacant block and I received some unwanted attention from patrons of the business next door. Not Cook Au Vin's fault, but it sure would've been nice to not have been locked outside.  The class itself isn't super hands on. Everyone crowds around one table, so you don't get to really learn how to make each dish because some things are going on across from you, etc. and a lot is going on at the same time. You take turns taking part, so not everyone gets to actually participate. When someone asked if the recipes would be shared with us after the class, we were informed the chef was months behind on that...aka no. The food was good, but I felt like I could've gone to a restaurant at that point, since I didn't get to really do much.

2014-10-29,1.0,"My recommendation is that people not support this business.  If you do, enter at your own risk.   I attended a cooking class and had a nice time.  When I arrived, it was a chilly October morning.  By the time I left, the day had warmed up, as October days are prone to do.  The temperature change combined with the heat in the kitchen from all the cooking surfaces led me to forget my brand new jacket ($130) hanging on its hanger in the room.  Yes, I take full responsibility for this mistake.   When I realized I had forgotten my jacket, I called Cook Au Vin that night (Sunday) and no answer.  I called the next day and they confirmed that they had it---the employee specifically said ""I am holding it in my hand.""  I said I would come some time that week to get it, around 6 pm.  I did not make it Monday night, but when I went to go on Tuesday, I called ahead to make sure someone was there.  The same employee told me the jacket was gone and he suspected an employee had taken it.  He apologized sincerely which I do appreciate. I asked him if he could contact the employees via email and see if anyone has it and to please turn it in.  I told him I would follow up in a few days.  Upon following up, no one had returned the jacket.  I spoke with the owner who also said it was likely an employee had taken it, they had no way of knowing who, and they did not anticipate they would ever find out.  I patiently and kindly gave them several opportunities to see if they would do anything to help remedy the situation.  They declined my request.  Rather, the owner went on a tirade where she berated me as irresponsible for forgetting my jacket.  She was condescending, stubborn, and rude. To suggest an employee stole the jacket, and then not have a desire to right this wrong, is egregious.  The owner told me there are 20-25 employees and she hired them.  How does she not have a better handle on them??  Seems fishy to me. This business has no control over their employees and absolutely no care for their customers, without whom there would not be a business. If you want to retain customers and grow your business, you cannot rudely brush people off when they accidentally leave something at the establishment, and you certainly cannot tell them you are holding their belongings for them and then lose them.  Yes, accidents do happen, but any business owner with integrity would want to remedy the situation, not make it worse.",0.677,0.769,0.117,0.114,0.5718990500240501

We walked in - no greeting - just a bunch of other patrons standing around looking as confused as we were. There were nice snacks to munch on before class,  however. Once the ""class"" started, we all gathered around the cooking area and the chef assigned groups of 2-3 to work on different sections of the meal. My job was cracking eggs and slicing meat - not exactly the type of things that require any skill or chance to learn new techniques. At no point were we shown a recipe or menu, and it was mostly up to all of us in the class to ask the chef what the heck we were making. Everyone was working in a silo, so you didn't get a chance to see how other dishes were being prepared. The instructions were vague -- ""chop this"" or ""add pepper"". Like, how should it be chopped? How much pepper? Very frustrating and not at all the learning experience I had expected based on classes I'd taken before at the Chopping Block.

I happen to love authentic French food and was even open to the fusion idea, not expecting spot on cuisine out of Le Cordon Bleu.

Sometimes it is less risky for them to rescue a bowl of ingredients than to try to talk someone through each step :) So in that sense, in the future I might pay a little more for a smaller group lesson, but if you watch closely and ask questions you can pick up the right technique.   As another reviewer said, it is more like preparing a meal with a chef with a dozen other people rather than a full-on lesson. You essentially get what you put in- if you pay close attention and try to play a role in preparing every dish, you will leave with a lot of knowledge. If you sit back and drink wine and let your classmates do the work, then you will get much less. I've gone back and forth between these two behaviors and enjoyed myself immensely.

We took turns doing the prep work, after instructions and then on to the actual mixing an cooking. A potato leek soup with truffle, sauteed shrimp with lobster champagne sauce over just made linguine and chocolate lave cake to finish up, This was all prepared under the expert direction of Chef Benoit who was entertaining and very knowledgeable. The last hour was spent eating the fruits of our labor and enjoying the conversation with our new friends.  This is an event that is more social than a technical cooking class. It is very much suited for individual or groups that want a relaxing but fun filled experience surrounding food. Bring what you intend to drink. Iced water was available. Bread an cheese was offered to start the evening.

You're among a group of people with varying cooking skills and are expected to cook together (a couple of people will dice onions while a few others chop strawberries, etc), so you can't really do everything unless you're bouncing around the kitchen and disrupting the other participants. I recommend picking a few things you really want to try and making a concerted effort to participate in those particular tasks. The chef encourages moving around and speaking up, so be polite but don't be shy. The end result was a beautiful meal shared with happy strangers. Though I didn't learn any new techniques, I did walk away with a few cooking tips.

2014-03-11,3.0,"Perhaps the classes differ based on the instructor, but this was definitely more of a ""prepare a meal as a group"" than a ""learn new techniques"" experience.  I'm far from a master chef but I walked away from our 3 hour class (was supposed to be 4, keep reading) having learned absolutely nothing. I purchased two class passes from Gilt City at a heavy discount.  I'd originally hoped to book a class somewhere around Valentine's Day, but those filled up almost instantly.  I really wanted the Chanel menu, but those were also all filled, so we opted for the Gaultier menu.  That menu is vegetarian, and my boyfriend and I are not, but the food sounded so delicious we didn't care.  We signed up for a class that began at 4 pm on a Sunday. I'd read all the raves about the delicious bread and cheese served during class and anxiously awaited them.  I'm not sure if the afternoon classes are different, but we never got any.  In fact, there was nothing to eat until the meal was served about 2.5 hours in.  Our class was a little odd, which our instructor, Vincent, kept commenting on.  We had three mother daughter teams (with one underage daughter) and three couples.  Only two of the groups brought wine, so we didn't have the raucous atmosphere described in some of the other reviews. Basically we all went and stood by a station, having no idea what skills would be used in each.  We then went about preparing some part of the meal.  My entire Cook Au Vin experience involved dicing tomatoes and pulling basil leaves off a stem.  Really.  We never rotated stations so I never got to learn anything about making souffle or custard, which were the skills I was really interested in.  Vincent walked around to help each station, but he didn't point out techniques or teach anything.  we never even learned what type of cheese was used in the souffle (we asked the women at that station, they didn't know either). Our class finished cooking really quickly (possibly because no one was drinking).  We sat down to eat at 6:30.  The food was delicious, I have to give Cook Au Vin that.  By 7:15 everyone was done and out the door.  I was emailed recipes the next day, but, again they lacked important detail like what type of cheese to use in the souffle and all the units are in metric.  They're essentially useless. Overall I was really disappointed in this experience.  I expected something totally different - to learn how to make ALL the menu dishes.  My boyfriend and I still had fun, but if I'd paid the sticker price for the class ($260 for 2 people) I'd have been furious.  I'd way rather spend that money on a nice dinner out or a cooking class that actually has, you know, instruction.  Sorry Cook Au Vin, the only thing that's even netting you 3 stars is that I bought these classes on super sale.  There's a reason they're constantly on Gilt City and Groupon.",0.9817,0.843,0.098,0.059,0.6200595700595701

2014-02-11,5.0,"I love to bake.  I don't consider myself very good at it, but lord knows I am more than willing to make a new attempt.  Cinnamon rolls, cookies, cakes...I just gotta try.  Much of what I attempt I judge as failures, but failures I can learn from.  However, certain things were utterly beyond me. Like Macarons. And Lo and behold, a sibling of mine sees a Groupon for a pastry class at Cook au Vin, and it covers macarons and pate a choux and a respective filling for both; the table was set.  I was going to learn Macarons. The class was eight people, of varying ages and cooking levels, and we paired off into two teams.  We were all gathered around a central table, with a work area on either side centered around an overhead power conduit used to power the stand mixers and eventual induction cookers used in class.*  The class was organized well, with a nice flow of the schedule.  The material that needed the longest to set (the macaron) was prepared first, followed by the pastry shells, a short break for everyone to check phones/have a smoke/etc, and then making the fillings and filling the goods.  At no point did the class seem either rushed or dragging, and that is an impressive feat in itself.  And the results?  Oh yeah, the macarons came out like professional macarons.   And stupid me, I failed to take a picture of the eclairs I made that night at home...they were consumed before I could think, 'hey, I should get  a picture of this"".  So, on pretty much all levels the class was a success, although lacking a stand mixer, I have yet to try the macarons at home...but i have no fear of them now.  Their time will come.  Soon. * the late comedian Richard Jeni had a hilarious bit about watching cooking shows that  contained the gem, ""cooking with utensils you don't have in a kitchen bigger than your whole {expletive} house.""  I've always done mixing by hand, or in the case of whipping egg whites, via hand mixer.  I nodded at the stand mixer that we used in class, as I've been meaning to get one for some time now (bye bye kitchen counter space), but when the induction cooker was brought out, I couldn't help but snicker.  Indeed, utensils I don't yet own ( amazon.com  was mentioned more than once during class) in a kitchen bigger than my house.  Once again Mr Jeni spoke the truth.",0.983,0.798,0.135,0.067,0.5533076799743466
2014-01-06,4.0,"Go to Cook Au Vin for an awesome time with a significant other or a friend, but don't come if you want to learn how to make everything on the menu. The group of 14 was fairly young (no one over 30, which the chef said was not typical).  We were all super optimistic to learn how to make everything, and then things kinda got chaotic (not a bad thing!) Here's my breakdown of the class: Arrive at 7pm prompt (doors don't open before because the chef is preparing the goods). When you arrive, the chef has a great cheese spread and baguettes ready for your consumption.  The spread had brie (duh), roquefort (exquisite), light yellow cheese, and two or three other ones.  You munch on those apps and sip of your BYOB wine for about 45 mins while you mingle with the others and wait for the chef to prepare everything.  Great so far... Now, here's where the chaos hit.... The structure of the class was more communal rather than individualistic (perhaps a reflection of French society?) in the sense that you do not work on your own meal.  Rather, each person works on a separate part of the meal.   For example, one person was separating the eggs to whisk into merengue.  Another person was scooping potatoes for the mashed potatoes. Another one was dicing mushrooms and onions for...I have no idea (the sausage maybe).  She was in tears for a good 20 minutes.  Someone else was chopping meat... It wasn't ""every man for his own""..more like ""I'll do this, you do that, and then we share.""  So French. Anyway... By this time, everyone had figured out that we weren't preparing every dish.  I think everyone was bummed out because we all wanted to do everything (quite the enthusiastic group, weren't we!)  Most of us had done other cooking classes where you do cook your own meal instead of partaking in only a small part. So we all expected that.  But to be honest, the 3 course meal set-up does not lend itself to making every dish on your own.  It would've taken FOREVER!  This was probably the BEST set-up if you wanted a little bit of everything. Back to the review....We spent about 2-3 hours prepping the food.  Here's what I can remember: 1) Home-made sausage links- YUM!  One couple diced meat.  Then we fed the meat and two other types into a kitchen aid. That took about 45 minutes because there was so much to make! A few people put the casing on the machine. We all took turns stuffing the casing with the meat. 2) One group made some type of baked apple with mashed potatoes on top.  We all took turns ""icing"" (not sure if that's the proper word, but you get me) the apples with the mash-p, which was quite fun. 3) Another group whisked the merengue, shaped them it into balls and boiled them as part of the desert.   4) There were a few custards and sauces that I have little recollection of seeing being made (either because I was tipsy by that point, was not paying attention to the other cooking stations, or had no idea what was being made). 5) There was something with a pastry and a mushroom cream sauce but I have no idea how it was made...it was called something like boush reine   Then, we all sat down and were served each dish. Everything was beyond exquisite! We had a really fun time ""cooking"" and mingling.  We finished almost by midnight!  But hey, that wasn't a problem for the young group. One thing that kinda bothered me was that we were told that we could have leftovers.  When we asked for them, we were told that they were given to the other workers...  That was kinda shoddy in my opinion.   All in all, I would recommend Cook Au vin to anyone looking for an awesome time and a delish meal, but not if you're super into learning how to make EVERYTHING.",0.9967,0.841,0.122,0.037,0.5352366255144032

2013-09-16,4.0,"I took the bread class here this past Saturday, and it was a lot of fun.  This is not necessarily Bread 101, so I would recommend it to people who have at least made a couple of loaves before.  You will get a lot more out of it that way.  If you have no experience you can definitely do it and have a ton of fun, it will just be more meaningful to those to have perhaps tried (and maybe failed at) some bread.  Then you can get good advice from the baker.  This time it was a baker named Rafael who was teaching the class.  He trained in Lyon and has been at Cook Au Vin for about a year.  He was really nice and personable and ran the class very smoothly.  He also makes bread at home, so he can give tips on baking in a home oven, which certainly is different from using their awesome professional equipment.   We made different shapes with traditional baguette dough (baguette, boule, flower), then did stuffed batards with sourdough, and then stuffed brioche-like breads.  The doughs were already made and risen, so we just shaped and baked them.  After that, we got into teams and mixed and kneaded another baguette dough by hand.  He taught us to knead by slapping the dough on the table, which was a lot of fun (as well as loud and messy).  At the end, we got to sample the fruits of our labor with a cheese plate, then everyone collected a HUGE amount of bread to take home.  We each got about 12 loaves!!  I had heard we'd get a lot of bread, but I was surprised at the quantity.  Some large shopping bags would've come in handy to manage the paper bags that they provided.   All in all, this was a really fun way to spend a Saturday morning, and I'd definitely recommend it.  I will happily go back to take another class.",0.9888,0.855,0.134,0.011,0.5216748768472906

Our entire group had a great time learning to cook new things and hanging out. We started off the night with some cheese platters and wine that everyone brought.  Then we cooked, chopped, kneaded and baked a variety of different things. Very hands on, very informative although hard to actually recreate when you get home because they don't give out any of the recipes. That's why I knocked it down a star. You will have fun inside the class, but don't really plan on making the things you learned again. Especially since you are cooking while tipsy from the wine. After we were done cooking, we all sat down and feasted on the dinner we made. The chefs brought out the courses one by one. The sauteed zucchini and red peppers  with herbs de provence and a creamy sauce were just beyond amazing.

2012-01-17,4.0,"I am basing this review off of Dior menu with Chef Scott. Overall, the glass is a lot of fun for anyone no matter what your culinary experience is. If you are a novice, then that's fine, you will learn a lot. If you're an experience cook, then this may produce some knowledge you haven't been exposed to before, but in the least it will still be fun no matter what.  Things to note: Bring 3 bottles of wine; two is too little and four makes you look like an alcoholic. Also, DON'T DRIVE! You're going to be sporting a pretty heavy buzz and drinking and driving is just very stupid. The cabs are VERY accessible on the corner down the street.  We started off the night be opening our first bottle of wine while we ate some VERY tasty cheeses and bread and cured meats. It was a good change for everyone to get to know each other and get settled in with a glass or two. We started off by making our desert first, basically a French version of an upside down apple pie; a tarte tatine, however I digress at that description. Scott was very informative on how to handle the dish and how to prevent common errors. We then moved to making a Flamekuche (think of a personal pizza) with bacon, creme fresh, herbs de provence and parmesean cheese.  Ratatoullie was next.Simple and very easy to make for the most part.  The muscles marinieres was pretty damn good.

Scott our chef was incredible - a laid-back instructor that gives easy-to-follow instructions to make fancy complex-sounding dishes. I learned so much about everything from vegetable-cutting techniques to ingredient chemistry.  The kitchen area was had just been remodeled and the space was warm and inviting. We brought a few bottles of wine to complement the cooking process/dinner and had a nice little buzz when we sat down to our meal. There were ten people in our class, big enough to have a fun group and small enough to provide an intimate experience. I can't wait for recipes to be emailed out because I'm so excited to recreate it at home!  I would absolutely do this again and am looking forward to trying out the other menus!

2011-12-18,3.0,"My husband and I took the Champagne and Truffles class. We were given a Groupon as a gift. My husband's work is tricky for scheduling stuff like classes, but they were BEYOND accommodating, which was really nice.  Our class was on a Saturday from 3:00-7:00. We started late because a few people were late, but that's ok because when you arrive, you open your wine and they have a long, beautiful table set with amazing bread they bake in-house, cheeses, great butter, nuts, cornichons, etc...We spent that time getting to know some of the other couples.  Once everyone had arrived, we jumped right into the cooking. Our instructor was Scott, who was funny and knowledgeable, and also very casual, which played well with our crowd. We made vegetable soup with truffles and puff pastry, shrimp in a lobster veloute with homemade linguine and molten chocolate cakes. This class compared with others we've taken was much more focused on cooking and didn't dumb anything down. Also he wasn't trying to sell us anything - I know, shocking! We did a bunch of chopping, separated eggs, mixed some stuff, made pasta dough by hand and drank A LOT.  We sat down to eat as a group. The soup was good, but let's face it, it was vegetable soup with puff pastry on top. When you broke through the flaky pastry, you got a whiff of truffle. Kinda nice. The pasta was yummy, the shrimp were perfectly cooked (though Scott cooked those while we were eating soup.) The veloute was finished with champagne. We're still trying to figure out how homemade pasta is French, but it was good none the less. The cakes were a bit dry. The melty ganache inside was nice and gooey though.  Our group is really what made this a great time. We all laughed and gabbed like we'd known each other for ages. Scott was a great instructor. We are pretty experienced home cooks, so for us nothing was ""new."" We make homemade pasta all the time, and that seemed to be the star of the show. So I think if you have some knowledge of cooking, this could be a really great experience. Two things stood out as troublesome:  in the confirmation email they send, they recommend bringing 2-3 bottles of wine per couple, as the class is four hours and sometimes runs long. They say it's better to have too much than not enough. While this is true, and we did bring two bottles, there is no public transportation to speak of, and you're definitely driving home impaired. Quite honestly I'm not sure how cops aren't scouting this place out. The second concern is the cost. Our night out was a gift, and it's my understanding that the Groupon was $150 (the original cost being $300.) If we had paid for this, it would have been a different experience entirely. If you haven't chopped shallots before, if you have a lot of money and if you plan ahead and take a cab, this is a great night out.  PS Wear a very warm sweater. Even with the ovens on and all the chopping and booze, it's ice cold freezing in there.",0.9992,0.733,0.232,0.036,0.5767640692640692
2011-12-15,3.0,"Ok.   First let me state that I cook a lot.  So, I might come off as a complete and utter snob.  If you are a beginner, by all means please take these classes you will enjoy. I took the class with my step-mom who is also a cooking fiend and therefore is no stranger to the kitchen. We were there with three other couples, and made a complete menu. We started off with wine and cheese and bread.  Which was a good thing, as we weren't done cooking until about 11:15.  But then again I don't think we should have had about 45 minutes to sit around and eat cheese as they prepped in the kitchen.  I would have prepped ahead of time, and gotten out of there earlier on a weeknight. The food was good.  The scallops that we made were genuinely amazing and that was a dish that I learned on the spot.  The chicken smelled ok, but I don't eat chicken and I was told by fellow classmates that it was under=seasoned. The chef was helpful, however most of the knowledge that was being passed on was not very high level stuff.  Again, if I were a beginner I would have enjoyed this class a whole lot more.

2011-12-04,1.0,"Did the bread backing class toward the end of October. My review echoes Falon G.'s almost exactly. I went to this class with some bread baking experience. I was hoping for a chance to ask some questions and further my skills. I wasn't expecting it to be an expert class, but I was still very disappointed from the start. About 15 of us gathered in a drab looking kitchen/bakery. Our instructor rushed in, didn't introduce himself, didn't tell us what to expect for the night, just said ""Read the recipes and we'll start in a bit"". He then just started having people measure out ingredients and throwing them into the mixer with no explanation of what we were making. Until I started asking him questions (which I knew the answer for) to get him to start talking about the recipes and so that people could learn something. Another person asked him if they need an industrial mixer like theirs to make bread at home. He actually told them YES! I was flabbergasted.  Yes, there are limitations to a stand mixer such as a Kitched-Aid, but come on. Civilizations have been making great bread for hundreds if not thousands of years without a $5K Hobart mixer. Someone asked the instructor how they know when bread was done, he said ""in 30 min and when it sounds hollow when tapping the bottom."" I asked him if that is for all types and sizes of bread and he said yes. I asked if you can use a thermometer to check the temperature for doneness and he said no. Wow. The only thing the instructor seems to say without prompting was to point out the different things you can't do without bakery grade equipment. So.....we spent $100 to come here and find out that we really can't make good bread at home. WTF?? On a positive note the bread did turn out really well and the meat and cheese platter to eat at the end was amazing. So, I guess if you are looking to spend 4 hrs watching bread being made without learning anything but drinking lots of wine and eating good food, then go ahead and do this class. If you are looking to learn anything, avoid this class, or at least the worthless instructor that I had.",0.9324,0.823,0.105,0.072,0.5585227272727272
2011-11-22,1.0,"My brother and I participated in the prestige champagne class last evening. Sorry but I would not recommend this as a cooking class.  Was it a good time, yes- but it is marketed as a cooking class in French cuisine with chef vincent--every time you call you speak to a woman with very heavy french accent- the website implies all that  is French--so the expectation was an ' evening in Paris""  kind of---  but the evening was extremely casual with emphasis on fun rather than cooking lesson.  so if you are looking for fun- the chef was entertaining and the group was extremely fun (wine certainly helped) but the instruction was basic- the food mediocre and not the 'finest ingredients' as advertised..  the soup--- saute' carrots, celery, mushrooms  (basic white portbella) and onions-- literally!  $2.00 worth of ingredients at best- actually the chef emphasized the cheapness of ingredients- the soup was all based on the truffle mushroom- 1 - reconstituted-  and then some premade puff pastry covered the individual tureen.  we made pasta- linguini- which if you have never done before than interesting i guess- but this was supposed to be the top class. not a basic lesson.. sauce - heavy  creme and lobster soup base-- onions-- that's it! shrimp--chef prepared- we did nothing-- he just sauted'   dessert- choclate lava cake-- again basic as the presitge class i expected more - at least more ingredients per dish- for $350- which i think all of us did groupon thank God- i expected more 'fine' ingredients. so if you are looking for instruction- go to Chopping Block-more formal but still fun cooking fools is also great and you learn more. heaven on 7- but not hands on- but lots of food for the $$$$ this was more expensive and really only offered a fun nite out- but mainly because of the great crowd that was gathered there that evening.",0.9978,0.748,0.23,0.022,0.4415836101882613

As the class started, there were about five pairs and the instructor.  The instructor was very informative and patient with the students.  He was quite funny too.  We had the opportunity to stir, whisk, chop, slice, etc...(the correct ways) in the course of the three-hour class.  At the end, we made a three-course vegetarian meal that was to die for!  Double YUMMY!!  After we finished cooking as a team, we all sat at this French country style dining room table and enjoyed the rest of our cocktails and meal by candlelight.   There was a feeling of accomplishment and achievement as we left that warm and stormy evening.  Can I cook any of those items again?  Not me...but I loved every minute of the experience and would love to embark on that journey again!",0.9749,0.821,0.144,0.035,0.39682539682539675

2011-10-17,1.0,"Bread making class. What a disaster.  When I arrived to the school, I was 20 minutes early for my 7:00 pm class.  The door at the front was locked, so I flagged down the person mopping inside, who instructed me to go to another door.  I apologized profusely for being early, since the man was acting so put off about it.   He pointed out that I was early about 7 times before offering me a place to wait.   I felt very unwelcome. The class was...well....strange.  I love to cook and was really hoping to learn how to make bread at home, but took with me absolutely nothing I could use.  The instructor seemed uncomfortable, was awkward and unorganized.  The first part of the class was mixing  ingredients listed on our recipe page (HUGE, unusable portions--5 kg flour, 6 liters water, etc).  This consisted of ""ok, now who would like to add the flour to the mixer?""  and we took turns, standing around drinking wine and talking in between.  I tried to pick up tidbits I could do at home, mostly asking questions, since the instructor offered nothing up willingly.  I asked if I do this at home with a dough hook on my mixer and he said ""Yes, but it doesn't work very well in a small mixer.""  So, I asked about hand-kneading.  He smirked.  ""You would have to knead for 40 minutes!""  So much for trying... After about 90 minutes of this, the 3 types of bread had been mixed and given time to rise.  We all pitched in and shaped the bread, which was fun.  Around this time, the guy that criticized me for being early came into the class.  I shall call him ""the Frenchman.""  He showed some people how to roll the dough, then caught me over by the sink rinsing my hands.   He said ""oh, you are the girl that was early.""   Uh, yes.   ""Did you come by yourself?""   Yes.   ""Well, most people come here as a couple--it's a very couply thing to do.""   Ummm....what do you say to that?  And what business is it of his? Once the bread was shaped and ready to be put in the oven, the Frenchman scored the top of a loaf and offered me a try.  I swiped the knife across the bread and he said ""NO!  That is wrong!  You are cutting at the wrong angle!""  Ok, so I tried his angle.  ""Now, look at the way the bread puckered!  You are going too slow!""  Jeez!  After practically being yelled at, I figured I should give back the knife and step away.   By this time, it's around 10:00 pm, we have all consumed copious amounts of alcohol (mostly out of boredom), and have eaten NO bread or food of any kind.  I am starving and spot a large chuck of cheese on a side table.  Of course I went for it and cut myself off a piece.  No sooner did the Frenchman come over and slap my hand!  He slapped my hand like I was 5 years old and took the cheese away.   I didn't get out of there until 11:30.  They didn't bring out a cheese plate to enjoy the bread until 11:00 pm.  From 7:00 to 11:00, the only activities anyone participated in were adding an ingredient, rolling dough, loading the oven, and getting yelled at.  Every other excruciating minute was spent standing around and drinking, like a bar.  Oh, and did I mention this room was 80 degrees the whole time?",0.9285,0.835,0.093,0.072,0.47442365835222977

Some students left before the baking started. 2- The chef did not speak English well which made the process much longer. 3- The ingredients sheet was passed out which had multiple errors and no recipe so it took pretty long to figure out what we were doing.

Seems like every 100th I'm talking about my hobbies, the things that bring me joy, my passions in life, things that wet my whistle, and this one will be no exception. So without further adieu, I give you... COOKING!!! I dig it! Cooking for me is like a combination of things, an expression of who you are, it can be a form of art, it has the precision of dance, and it has the thought and preparation of a play.  As like most hobbies natural talent will only take you so far, this is where Cook Au Vin comes in. Just a little sample of French cuisine and how to prepare it. Though, if you have few amateur chefs in the group and or are smart enough, you will ask a lot of questions beyond French cooking.  I'll be honest, I came in here with a Groupon and expecting one of those watch them prepare the meal, then eat it kind of deals. But at Cook Au Vin, you're all hands in. Chef Scott is hilarious and yet professional. He was fearless with letting us all handle knives and made it a point to have every one involved and everyone getting their hands dirty. He was playful yet descriptive when explaining the do's and don'ts of French/ cooking overall. I can't even begin to explain how much fun was had by all and then we got to eat. We went with the French Riviera Menu which was vegetarian.         Starter - Vichyssoise Classic: French-American soup made of leeks and potatoes with crème fraîche. We actually made this two ways, cold and hot (a real Vichyssoise is cold). Entrée - Napolenta: Polenta-based Napoleon with layered of roasted vegetables and topped with a fluffy tomato and basil emulsion. Side - Tomates Provençales: Roasted tomato halves topped with garlic and herbes Provence. Dessert - Tarte Tatin: Upside-down caramelized apple tart. The class is three hours and they encourage you to bring some wine or whatever you want. Before the class even begins they set out a cheese and bread platter. The cheese was great and the bread is actually made fresh from their bakery of which they also have a bread making class. I'll admit the classes are a little pricy but you do get a lot out of the class.

The instructor did most of the ""hard"" stuff and made sure that everything came out the way it was supposed to, but it was still hands-on in a fun way.  Everyone kind of cooks as a group and we all took turns doing different things. After you finish cooking everything it's time to eat!  Dinner is family style, which might not be your thing with a small group of strangers... but after a few bottles of wine during the course, you'll all be best friends.  After all, everyone else is there for the same thing as you so it really doesn't matter if you're all from completely different worlds. And remember, it's BYOB so make sure you bring a couple bottles.  The cooking class is about 3 hours long so you're going to need them! Also, if you are a cheese or bread lover, they gave us an awesome cheese plate and delicious bread before the class started, and you can snack on that throughout the class.  In fact, I'm pretty sure I finished most of the cheese myself.

We've done cooking classes at Sur la Table and The Chopping Block before and this was by far our best experience. At previous classes the Chef will give the steps and instructions and then you and your partner are off to do your jobs. At Cook Au Vin it still is very hands on but the tight intimate space makes for quick work and more time to drink some wine, have some homemade bread and great cheeses and enjoy good conversation with friends while preparing your meal. Chefs at other cooking classes were to the point and knowledgeable. Cook Au Vin's chef, Chef Scott is the MacGuyver of chefs!!! :) He is super knowledgeable in, well it seems everything. The way he teaches class is really laid back but he also is great at staying on task so we enjoy our food in a timely fashion. The class started at 3 and he wanted us to be eating at 5:30. I think we sat down at 5:35. Chef Scott knows his shitake mushrooms. While cooking he gives great tips to implement at home and has ideas so you don't break the bank when it comes to cookware and ingredients. He doesn't push his ideas on you he just tells it like it is and it all makes sense. The food was awesome and I know my wife and I walked away with a lot of great ideas to do in our kitchen. Again though the best thing about the class was Chef Scott. He didn't seem to be just collecting a pay check and on to the next class.

2011-02-06,4.0,"Putting the ""Vin"" in Cook Au Vin: If you're already a gourmet chef and looking to learn a few new French cooking techniques, this probably is not the class for you. If you're more of a novice, and want to have a change-of-pace night out with your sweetie and meet a few like-minded others, then Bon Appétit! We really enjoyed ourselves here, and although my epicurean wife didn't learn much from the cooking instruction, I found the class to be quite educational, not to mention fun. I enjoyed preparing the French onion soup and wielding an uber-sharp knife to slice potatoes and onions, but the highlight of the night was brandishing a torch to caramelize the sugar on the crème brûlée. My inner-9-year-old-pyromaniac greatly relished in the opportunity to mix flames with food. Fire! Fire! Be sure to bring at least one bottle of wine per person to this BYOB event, as the class runs at a nice, leisurely pace. You can always take a leftover bottle back home! Everyone in our class brought red wine, but they do provide an enormous ice bucket for those of you who prefer your Pinot Grigios and such. Good beer would probably be fine too while hard at work in the kitchen. I find myself craving a Sierra Nevada whenever I'm standing close to seared meats and sauteed onions while wearing an apron, but perhaps I'm in the minority on that one. Chef Scott was informative and a lot of fun. The food was probably 3 stars at best (let's be realistic here...all of us amateurs had a hand in making this), but Scott made the class so enjoyable that I'm kicking it up to 4 for the experience. Returned home with a pleasant wine buzz and clothes that reeked of scorched olive oil and kitchen smoke. It was bliss! Also, the baguette bread served with dinner was delicious. They prepare the bread here on site, but sell it out of the La Boulangerie Bakery and Café located at 2569 N Milwaukee Ave (Milwaukee/Logan Blvd). Good stuff! Have to go check it out next time I'm in the Logan Square neighborhood. PS- taxicabs are a little sparse on this area of Elston, so be prepared to call a cab after dinner.

We had a Groupon and picked the Paris Class - we made French Onion Soup, Potatoes Dauphinois (sp?), Coq au vin, and individual creme brulée. Everyone was really friendly and the wine flowed. Definitely bring 2-3 bottles per couple (it's BYOB)! The food turned out really delicious, too. Unfortunately, I am taking a star away because for a cooking class, I did not come away with a ton of knowledge. I suppose some of the information might come in the recipes which are going to be sent to us via email, although I have not received them yet. For example, the Coq au vin came to us already marinating with the vegetables in a red wine sauce. We were taught how to take out the meat and sear it, then to add wine as necessary to create a thick and rich sauce. However, when I asked what prep had already been done to the chicken, the Chef just mumbled something about ""in the oven with salt and pepper...."" it was not very clear, and that is definitely information that we would need to know in order to recreate these dishes at home. I understand the need for a shortcut when the meat needs to marinate for 6 hours, but please at least very clearly tell the class what you have done to already get it to that point. My creme brulée was also not properly torched because the Chef didn't really show us how... just gave us the torch and let us go to town. I also had to ask questions such as what type of onions we were chopping for the soup, and what type of wine was in the Coq au vin (information I feel should have already been given when the onions came out). All around I had a great time, and the company and food were great.

2009-11-13,4.0,"I loved this place! The reason I am not giving it Five Stars is because we weren't provided the proper attire that is advertised online-apron instead of the chef's coat and burger king hat instead of the fluffy white chef's hat. The venue isn't anything spectacular, but has a very rustic Parisian feel. Also, if our dinner could have been done in 2-3 hours versus 5-6 this may have made my Friday and hangover less miserable.  When the bubby and I walked in, we were greeted with candlelight and the tunes of Nina Simone, Madeline Peyroux, and Edit Piaf, to name a few. Chef Vincent then brought out 3 types of fresh baked bread, fresh churned butter, duck mousse, country pate, french pickles, shaved parmesan, and cherry tomatoes. It took all of my willpower not to go to town on the bread. The best part is that later in the night Vincent was discussing how he wants to start a breadfix service similar to netflix, to deliver freshly baked french bread at home. I have never had bread as good as this-ooeeey gooooeeey inside and heartily crusted on the outside, I would definitely subscribe to this service.  A bottle and a half of wine goes by and we haven't yet started cooking, so we're all feeling pretty good. We then make our way into the kitchen and start arming ourselves with the proper utensils to start making our meal: Escargot, Sea Bass, Duck Fat Potatoes, and Il Flotante.  Il Flotante-We started off making this since it had to cool for a while. My ""islands"" of meringue apparently were awful since I accidentally let the milk and sugar heat too quickly so it became chunky---a big no no for the presentation of the dessert. Quite tasty though and a very informative demonstration. I'm not a huge dessert person and don't have much experience with sweets and pastries so I found this very helpful.  Escargot-We kind of forgot about the escargot so we had to do this twice since the little snails were burnt to mini coals. The bubby's arms were kind of tired softening the butter, but these were buttery and garlicky the second time around and I was really turned on watching him beat that butter to death. Anyways...I digress...  Duck Fat Potatoes-MMM...this was sooooo good. Golden russet potatoes cooked to a light crisp with duck fat, garlic, and parsley. This is O M G and the preparation seemed easily repeatable.  Sea Bass: We first started by charring red and orange piquillo peppers, chopped them, and added diced tomatoes and parsley and heated the mixture. We then deglaced the pan with a light wine and in parallel cooked the fish. Vincent then added Spanish chorizo and mussels for some added spice and variety.  All in all, this was a great meal and I am confident I can repeat each course at home-a very important quality to look for in cooking classes. Cook Au Vin is intimate and a good substitute for the group classes at the Chopping Block and Sur la Table-you're the only ones in the kitchen. While I did enjoy classes at the more corporate locations, I didn't necessarily like eating with strangers and sharing food.

But I did get a cafe Au lait, it was very well done, and I plan to get over there for their sandwiches soon. Why four stars? I figure I need to try more before I can give the ultimate five star review, but I recommend you go over and try it out.  Oh, and the bread. Yea, tore into a loaf in the car as I was driving away. Awesome.",0.9871,0.816,0.147,0.037,0.3625603864734299
2009-05-09,4.0,"On the way home from breakfast, with a trunkload of fresh meat from Columbus Meat Market, we pulled in here to buy some fresh baguettes and coffee.  They aren't normally in the business of selling their bread, preferring to use it to make the delicious-sounding sandwiches which are their specialty, but after a little initial confusion about what we wanted, they were happy to oblige.  We got three hot, fragrant baguettes and three cups of cafe au lait.  The service was a bit slow but it was explained that one of the counter gals was out sick so things were in a bit of a mess.  Nevertheless they were nothing if not polite, and the wonderful scents rising from all sides were like tranquillizers.  Even if we were inclined to be American and anxious, the smell of cooking crepes and fresh bread would have lulled us into accepting the wait and the minor confusion. In conclusion:  Superb bread with a tender crumb, a crisp but not chewy crust, excellent scalding hot cafe au lait, and very nice people.  I don't think you can go wrong.  I plan on getting back there to try sandwiches, crepes and anything else that takes my fancy.",0.8854,0.755,0.141,0.105,0.6044913419913419
2009-04-22,5.0,"I was born and raised in Paris (France) and I really think their baguette sandwich is close to what a sandwich tastes like in France. They are simple, tasty and authentic! I was told they make their own bread. The Parisian sandwich, Atlantic sandwich and Crepes are great. The prices are fair too!",0.8585,0.829,0.171,0.0,0.6595238095238095
2009-02-09,5.0,"I forgot to mention in my review, that Cook au vin also does traditional boulangerie stuff and while we didn't get to sample the pastry side, the baguette showed me (having lived in Paris for two years, I know of what I speak) that they know what the heck they're up to. Try it. First batch comes out around 10AM, according to Chef.",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5416666666666666

Cook Au Vin starting coming towards the end of the summer so we only got to try them once but my son's were hooked! To the point that I had to find the place to take them.  They love crepes, why? I don't know! I make them at home but only one likes them and the other one doesn't. I guess I don't cook as a true French does ;) The owner speaks French, Spanish and English I might have missed another language but needless to say he was very nice and charming!",0.9779,0.706,0.24,0.054,0.5592105263157895
2008-11-17,5.0,"My boyfriend and I went to Cook Au Vin for lunch this past weekend. I had a baguette sandwich with ham, brie, and mustard,  and my boyfriend had one of the crepes. We have been looking for a casual french cafe in our neighborhood since moving to Chicago from Seattle. This place exceeded our expectations! The baguette was the perfect texture and everything was delicious.  We also picked up a chocolate croissant, which was one of the best I've ever had. I am looking forward to visiting again soon!",0.9323,0.85,0.15,0.0,0.5694444444444444
2008-11-17,5.0,Just went there this weekend. Had a really good crepe and a chocolate croissant. The crepe was real good and very traditional lunch style with whole wheat batter with ham & cheese. Very tasty. The chocolate croissant was the crown of the meal. Soft and flaky and still warm. Best I have had since I was in Paris. Doesn't get much better than this. The prices were a little high for the sandwiches but worth it for the baguette it is served on.,0.7839,0.852,0.127,0.02,0.5054166666666666

The croissants are marvelous, same crunchiness and fluffiness you get in France, the selection of cheese is small but exquisite, the baguettes fresh and the ostrich pate delicious.",0.8789,0.741,0.223,0.036,0.6464285714285715
2008-06-12,5.0,"Out of curiousity and driving down Elston daily, I stopped by to check this place out and took away a very French sandwich, probably one of  best I've ever had.  Brie et Jambon on an incredible baguette. It took a bit of time to make, but was quite comfy sitting and perusing the cookbooks (en Francais) and other delicacies.  The following week I ordered some croissants for a breakfast meeting and they were to die for.  They offer cooking classes, but that's not for moi!",-0.6696,0.888,0.03,0.082,0.28055555555555556
2008-05-06,5.0,"This is the real deal. Walked in today and thought I'd entered a Paris cheese shop (I think that's a good thing). The sandwiches are prepared to order and exactly like those we get over there, down to the best baguette I've had outside of Paris and the right ratio of bread to fresh and delicious ingredients. They've got the crepe wheels heated and ready and if we could have eaten there today, we would have ordered the ham, cheese and egg galette. I can't wait to go back for one of those and a croissant and a cooking lesson. The staff was warm and welcoming (even offering us tastes of perfect pate with cornichon).",0.9788,0.778,0.222,0.0,0.4557387057387057
