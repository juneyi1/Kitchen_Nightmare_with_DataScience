The biggest complaint is that the bouncers were very rude and unreasonably pushy!  I understand that as a bouncer, you're dealing with extremely drunk people all the time and probably get jaded from that kind of job.  But seriously, you don't have to be an asshole to every person that walks in.  And when people are leaving, you don't have to help them by grabbing them by the neck and tossing them out.

We ordered car bombs and vegas bombs and she used a very short plastic glass and put the bomb part in a small shot glass... Usually with vegas bombs, you can just add the red bull right in... It didn't fit in the cup and overflowed.  2. She spilled my friends glass that was half way full with a vodka cran and just said ""sorry"".. didn't even replace it!. 3. The bus boy took my gin and tonic that was more than halfway full as well as my friends beer (I have NO CLUE why as it obviously wasn't empty). I told her about it and she replied with ""the bus boy took that, not me""... OKAY, well you're still an employee here so do something about it! That's NO excuse...  4. My friend ordered a miller light and paid for it, she put it in front of the wrong person so my friend never knew... he said ""can I have the miller light I ordered"", she said ""4.25, and popped one open. He mentioned that he already paid for it, and she said, oh well I put it over there (wrong person).. She made him pay for another one anyway.. (shouldn't be charging people for your mistakes).

Rando people asking you where Trace is. Trace is a decent spot if you're in Wrigleyville and want a late night spot. Key words are ""late night"" and ""wrigleyville"" so you can conclude that you're gonna get some random riff raff from drunk frat boy types but the security handles them fairly easy. You can also conclude from those key words that this place is gonna be packed, and it is especially after 2:00 am or 3:00 am on saturday night. It gets really hard to move around there and if you don't have a table it kinda sucks. This is like the only spot I've never closed.

2010-09-04,4.0,"Definitely a step up from other bars on the Wrigley Strip of Bros*.  My friends and I were not the most experienced Wrigley-goers, so we followed a few people when they said that Trace was a fun bar that they liked. We had a nice time at Trace. It was not too crowded or too loud, but far from dead or boring. There could've been more seating, but somehow we managed. The bartender was nice and very prompt. Her pours were a bit weak, which was fine by me since I'm a lightweight, but it's just a helpful tip for all of you normal people out there. :) Needless to say, it was a good vodka soda. I thought she said it was $9, so I handed her a $10, but then she gave me $5 in singles. Although I thought it was $9, apparently it was a loud bar since the weak vodka soda was really $5. That sort of surprise is always fun. (But $5 for a drink in Wrigleyville? I'm starting to think that that's a decent price. Good for them.) The upstairs area had bartenders that were much less attentive. It took about 15 minutes just to get shots, but it might also be because a bunch of men were sitting at the bar and slowly sipping beers, not, you know, letting other people order. Ugh. Trace was overall a lot of fun, and around 2am, it gets a bit crazy, but it was a fun time, and I'd probably go back. *I may sound snarky, but let's be real, some of the bros we observed were good looking.

2010-04-03,4.0,"Trace is not what I would have expected from an after-hours Wrigleyville bar. Not even close. We arrived just slightly before the 2am rush and were able to snag a booth on the first floor of the chic little lounge. The elevated U shaped booths are HUGE and easily fit 6 people while being wide enough for the 3 remaining standing members of our group plenty of room to stand around the outer edge. It was a great setup for a large amount of people to be able to talk to one another while remaining stationery.  The music wasn't very loud, so we could actually hear what the person next to us was saying. Has that ever been true of any late night bar? The crowd also isn't what you'd expect. Apparently the patrons of Barleycorn and Moe's Cantina haven't gotten the memo about the newest late night bar on the block yet. Gone were the Chads and Trixies and in their place, an older (if only by a few years) more chilled out scene. The average age of a patron here is probably 28 and isn't killing time trying to sober up before heading back out to the burbs.
