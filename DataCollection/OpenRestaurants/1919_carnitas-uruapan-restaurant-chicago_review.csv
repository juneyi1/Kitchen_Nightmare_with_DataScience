I saw this place on Munchies/Vice Network on a chef's night out episode. You can see how they prepare their carnitas by rendering it in its own fat (amazing!). It's a local business being passed down from the father to the son which is very cool!  1 pound of carnitas with all the fixings = heaven and more than enough for two people and its under $10. You can get the carnitas with just meat or add skin, stomach, and even brain (no additional cost). The carnitas include fresh hot tortillas, two types of salsas, pickled jalepenos/ carrots, cilantro, diced onion, and lime. I'm not sure if this is included but we also got some Tacos Derados with our meal (fried tacos). So basically you make your own taco with all the ingredients and just prepare yourself flavor explosion in your mouth. I'm not sure how many tacos I ate (over 7) with my buddy, but there was still leftover meat. They will also give you more tortillas if you ask! However, make sure to order a side of beans (frijoles refritos) and even guacamole. Don't forget the Mexican Cokes to wash it all down!

Service: restaurant is small but everyone is very mindful and wait time isn't bad bad-we waited no more than 5 minutes for a table on a Saturday during brunch and were expecting a much longer wait time. We were brought chicharrones and chips to munch while we looked over the menu - very easy to follow btw. Food: we were a bit hungover from the night before so we ordered menudo and carnitas. By far one of the BEST if not THE BEST menudo I have tried in the entire Chicagoland area.  The menudo was very clean and had a great flavor.  To top if off, when I asked for it to go they even added more menudo! These folks are so generous!  Carnitas were also very flavorful and the salsas they make are very different than your basic salsa but compliment the carnitas well. Owners of the restaurant checked on us a couple times and we chatted a bit - these folks really care about your experience as you can tell they are very downtoearth folks that are in business for the people they serve.

It's a classic style that simply tastes better than everyone else's. They're moist, tender, and salty the way carnitas should be. And their salsa pairs perfectly with this incredible meat. Take it from me, because I've been eating carnitas all my life. My mom made them, I've made them, and have tried plenty from other places. These are the best.

First, the papa con chorizo and papa con queso. These are potato-filled fried tortilla deliciousness. The queso (cheese) one was a little disappointing on the flavor side. It was fried mashed potatoes with cheese and that's tasty, but it had basically no seasoning! The chorizo (sausage) version was divine. It tasted like cinnamon rather than sausage but was absolutely delicious.  I also grabbed the free chicharrons, which was a HUGE portion.

There is the crunchy crackling skin (chicharrones), which snaps and crackles in your mouth with the slightest sliver of port meat tucked underneath to deliver an extra punch of flavor. Or there is the Sesos, a crispy taco stuffed with perfectly spiced pork brains, onions and jalepeno. It is so good, time to get food adventurous!",0.9871,0.795,0.192,0.013,0.63125

2016-09-09,4.0,"Made a stop here to get some carnitas and the fixin's for lunch at my mom's house. At first I was a little worried because many reviews stated that mainly Spanish is spoken here.  I do OK with Spanish, but am in no way fluent.  I know ""por favor"" and ""gracias"" go a long way so put away the worry and planned a visit.  Saturday abut 10am, there was a line and all the seats in the house were taken.  I found the line for take out and pretty much salivated at the pile of roast pork the cook/owner was carving up for the customers.   From their website I read that you can ask for different sections of the pork and figured I couldn't go wrong with shoulder.   Once it was my turn, I asked for ""dos"" (they sell by the pound) and said ""shoulder"".  He smiled at me and gave me and my son a sample to taste while we waited.   Moved up the line and asked for ""dos tortillas"" and the lady knew I wanted two packages of their tortillas.  Moved up again and the cashier asked if there was anything else I wanted.  Oh yes, one salsa verde and one salsa chipotle and a couple of their potato empanadas.  She gave us the empanadas for free ""so we can taste them""--very cool!  My whole order was packaged nicely and made it to the suburbs still warm and intact. Our order was very reasonable (cheap!) and worth the visit.  We dug in immediately at la casa de mi madre and everyone enjoyed it.  The meat was tender, the tortillas fresh, the salsa super tasty. It was a wonderful lunch.  If I had to change it, I should have asked for a little pork belly along with the shoulder to add a bit of fat/richness.  We made some margaritas on the rocks and it was just the perfect touch.",0.9954,0.793,0.18,0.028,0.5663461538461537

2016-08-01,5.0,"Came here for a couple of take out tacos while exploring 18th street for the first time in FOUR YEARS of exploring Chicago neighborhoods(which was such like... what?! where have I been). We walked in on a whim because on a relatively quiet Sunday, we could see from across the street that this place was busy. So... it must be good! And it was! The giant tacos, which we opened later at the park down the street, were huge. I thought they gave us the wrong thing. It was just tortilla, a giant wad of delicious shredded pork, and salsa/cilantro/onion. It was almost the size of a small burrito and filled us up way too quickly and may have cut our eating adventures short that day.  We came back for a sit down meal recently, and I would definitely come back again.. The service is probably more friendly if we spoke more spanish. But the owner both times was just so friendly and happy to see people enjoying this food. Next time, I would skip the ""value meal"" and just get meat by the pound (extra non-meat organ parts) and maybe an order of those fried potato tacos. The chicarrones were really crispy, porky, and satisfying to eat dipped in salsa, but maybe I'd only split a piece with friends because they're only good in small doses...  The salsas they put on your table are awesome. My favorite is still the fresh salsa, which is the one that came with our to-go taco. And juices from the pickled jalapenos.

You get carnitas by weight (it's cheap like $9/lb for the most delicious pork you'll ever have) and essentially build your own tacos with it. You can request certain parts of the pork or (like me) you can get a mix. Don't be afraid to try pork skin/belly/anybodypartyoucanimagine.

If you're not much one for brains, though, they have plain old ""meat"" carnitas (excluding stuff like ears).

We split a half pound, which was plenty. It was good, the price is fair, the corn tortillas were excellent, and the refried beans that are only available weekends were AWESOME. I think their house recipe must use lard and pork fat; they were incredible!! Oh man. I only restrained myself from eating the entire serving for the sake of my companions later on.

The side salsas/guacamole are very good. The spicy salsa has a good kick, but will not overwhelm you. The pico/salsa is light and fresh.

My husband and I have such great admiration  and appreciation that Marcos and his father have been able to keep Caritas Uruapan a timeless sub-culture of what local community truly as if we were in Puerto Rico.

I did my duty to both the United States of America and the United Mexican States and wrapped the goodness into the plentiful, hot fresh tortillas (they asked me at least twice if I had enough), spooned on some salsa and sighed with appreciation.

2015-05-04,5.0,"First of all, Anthony M.'s review of Carnitas Uruapan is so wholly amazing, you should go read it. Read it now. I was turned on to Carnitas Uruapan by Food Network's Aaron Sanchez, who you may know from Chopped. My historically favorite Food Network show is the lesser known Heatseekers, where Aaron and Roger Mooking go around stuffing the hottest possible things in between their lips. Right now, Chef Aaron is seen hawking tacos on Taco Trip. The show's debut city was Chicago, and Sanchez did indeed visit Carnitas Uruapan. I don't have much more to add to Anthony's review other than noting that everything he writes makes these carnitas sound extra delicious. In addition, Carnitas Uruapan offers a ""value meal,"" which is a half-pound of carnitas (you can pick the cuts or ask for a sample medley), a side of chicharron, and a bottled drink (go Jarritos), all for an astoundingly low $5.99. The half-pound comes out to 4 tacos, which is more than enough for one person. You can also order by the pound or by taco. The former is a great option for group dinners and easily taken to go. The to go option also holds some appeal, as the gentleman slicing your meat up front gives you a handful of tastiness as a sample. Of note, Carnitas Uruapan is a bit of a hike on the far west end of the Pilsen, but has quickly becomes one of my favorites in the area. It's also just off the Pink Line, making it one of the easier places to get to via public transit.",0.9527,0.905,0.083,0.012,0.5179112554112555

2014-08-03,5.0,"Sometimes when you want great food, you have to distill it down to its core. And that's exactly what they do here. The menu is as simple and straightforward as it gets: carnitas of your cut choice at $7.00/lb or $2.50/taco, frijoles, chicharrones and cactus salad. That's it. No fancy ingredients, no catchy hook or gimmick, just plain simple food from Michocan. And good Lord, it is amazingly delicious. I came on a Saturday morning and was greeted by a young girl at the counter who told me to sit anywhere. It's a very cozy interior, meaning it fills up fast when people get hungry for good authentic Mexican pork and coolers with Jarritos in the back. I decided on three tacos, one from the shoulder, one from the belly, and one from the loin. They were all delicious and juicy, with the pork loin taco being particularly tasty, with the skin of the pig still on the meat. I also got a free order of chicharrones, or fried pork skin, with a check in. It's not healthy for you at all, but it's a very tasty snack.  I recommend coming early for breakfast on the weekend, as they also feature crispy tacos with potato, which I am a fan of after the girl offered me one for free when I asked what they were. So tasty.

We refused the meat and explained why     Handling the food with bare hands is bad enough but his unkempt appearance further repulsed us.

It was just a disappointing experience and the food was flavorless and cold. The owner was attentive and the salsas were good in flavor, these two reasons are why this place gets 1 star.",-0.4391,0.92,0.032,0.049,0.7095238095238096

2014-02-23,5.0,"KNOW YOUR PIG I have been looking at this place on line for a few weeks. They are really social savvy and that is what caught my eye. I noticed on Facebook that they post a weekly secret word on Wednesdays. All you need to do is mention the word and you get 2 tacos for the price of 1. I then went to there website where I learned that they only serve carnitas. I thought to myself if they make one kind of taco, then it must be amazing. Time to read reviews on Yelp and with a 4.5 star rating I knew it was time to bookmark and visit this gem.  As soon as I walked in, the waitress approached me speaking Spanish and I attempted to use the secret word...""La Serena"". I think my high school Spanish paid off because she smiled and spoke to the owner who was walking out the door.  The owner Marco was nice enough to stop and talk to me. I love meeting owners because you can see there passion for there business. I pointed out to Marco how socially savvy his business was and informed him that is how I got to his front door. It is good for them to know that the social posts work on creating awareness and getting new customers. Marco then informed me that I could also get a free order of Chicharrón, if I checked in on FourSquare or Yelp. I showed him my app already checked in and said, ""I know and thank you!"" I love check-in gifts.  I asked Marco to help me order. What I learned is that you must know your pork when eating here. There is a chart on there menu, at the tables and I posted it as a tip. You can pick where you want your carnitas meat to come from for your taco. At first I thought that is so cool and then I panicked. I wasn't a butcher! What do I choose? Where do I start? I thought all pig was created equal? Marco was a huge help and he ordered 4 tacos for me in Spanish. He suggested for my first time I get Pork Shoulder and Pork Rib. So I decided to get two of each. While I was talking to Marco his cook, who was slicing the carnitas to make my 4 tacos, offered me a sample of the meat. I thought that was really nice. I had already ordered but he wanted me to have a sample still. I think he was proud of his pig. The process of roasting the pig is two hours until it transforms into succulent pieces of pork.  Marco suggested I get the shoulder and rib because those were the safest choices for my first visit and because they are mostly meat. He said as I get more adventurous I can start adding more fatty pieces of the pork like belly. So you really need to know your pig. Don't look at this and be afraid. Look at this as a culinary challenge to make the most delicious carnitas ever.  I was carrying out my food and got my 4 carnitas and a bag of fresh Chicharrón all for $5 and some change. Thanks to the secret word and checking in. Social Media Rocks! The bag was very heavy. They do not mess around here with there meat.  When I got home my wife remarked at how delicious the smell was. I had to prep her on the know your pork, before we dived in. I explained which tacos were which, before our eating adventure began.  I must say we enjoyed them. We loved the pork rib carnitas because they were the juiciest. You must be careful with this one because the bones and cartilage are still on there. I quickly pulled the bones out and saved them for my home made stock. Score! The carnitas came with a nice big container of green salsa that was very delicious. I wish I could make the salsa they make here. It worked so well with the carnitas. Yes I'm having salsa envy.  There was so much food we couldn't finish it all. I think one taco might be enough for one person, in fact I was stuffed. I was just happy that I had a meal of carnitas waiting for me the next day.  These leftovers are worth it. You definitely get your monies worth when eating here.  I also enjoyed my Chicharrón. This was the first time I ever had real Chicharrón and not out of a processed bag. It was yummy and I've been nibbling on it all week. For those of you who have never had it, it is deep fried pig skin and it is so delicious. I'm sure it's not healthy because something that tastes that good can't be healthy.  Thanks to Marco and his friendly staff for making me feel welcome on my first visit. I can not wait to return. The menu also expands on the weekend (Sat & Sun) with more available dishes. I'm now thinking that those items must be really special and I'm sure this place is packed on the weekends. This is also a family business. Marco's Dad started this place in 1975 and 39 years later they are still pumping out quality food. Congrats to Marco for keeping the family tradition alive and to another 40 years of carnitas love in Chicago.  So know your Pork, pick your meat & get ready for the best carnitas that Chicago has to offer. Enjoy because I know I did.",0.9995,0.8,0.188,0.012,0.5107391087748229

I've had this place on my to-do list for nearly a year and it lived up to my expectations.  The decorations are a little unusual with cartoon murals of pigs cooking other pigs and some unsettling festival masks.  It's supposedly the city's best carnitas place, and while they don't have much variety (it's all pork, as far as I could tell), they're the best at that one thing.",0.9392,0.825,0.139,0.036,0.5522727272727272

I was not disappointed.  Especially with the price.  Between the two of us, we devoured the 1 pound of carnitas that came with tortillas and three types of very spicy salsa and jalapeno peppers.  Being the biggest spicy food enthusiast, I doused my carnitas in all that spicy goodness and I have to say that this place has captured my heart in terms of carnitas.  I've never been a big fan of pork until this place.  Although the meat is a little dryer than what I am used to, it does the job when you're craving carnitas or just tacos in general.  The guys serving us were very nice and made sure we had enough salsa and tortillas.  The owner is also very nice and would offer samples to his customers when they wait for a to-go order of carnitas.  The menu is limited but it's a nice low-key place that gets the job done!

I've just now uploaded a photo of Carnitas Uruapan's kitchen, so that you see her description in slow-simmering action.

But, after a trip to Carnitas Uruapan, he'll be happy to jump on anything that gets him there again. And that... is as good a review as it can get. Some notes: - One orders carnitas by the pound whether dining-in or taking-out, for about $7 per pound. - They'll ask you if you want your carnitas ""mixta,"" which means ""with meat, skin and ear""... so just say no if you want all meat. - If you're dining in, know that Carnitas Uruapan doesn't serve alcohol and has no sodas which begin with the word ""Diet."" - Oh, and those empanadas-looking items they also offer?

Not only are the carnitas delcious, but also their chicharron, beans, fried tacos, and nopales salad are yummy! Like other reviewers mentioned, you order the carnitas by the pound and you can choose if you want them mixed, just maciza (leaner meat), boronas (bits and small chunks that are very well done), cuerito (fatty pork skin-must try!), etc. I always order boronas because they're packed with flavor.

It's family owned, and all they do is pork- carnitas and chicharones. Operates like a taqueria, so service isn't even an issue. I dined in on a weekend once, and there was literally a steady stream of 6-10 locals grabbing it to go for the entire 30 minutes I was there.  I hop the blue line from work downtown (its right off the 18th st stop), order 1-2 pounds with some buddies, and they bring out tortillas, salsa, and the meat. Its like $7 a pound. We usually get one pound mixed (Mitze?) which includes very fatty parts and other parts that some people might not wish to try. 1 pound feeds two dudes. I'll often order a pound on the way out to take home (keep in mind, good carnitas is pretty greasy). It's not the best carnitas I've ever had, but its very well done. Excellent even.
