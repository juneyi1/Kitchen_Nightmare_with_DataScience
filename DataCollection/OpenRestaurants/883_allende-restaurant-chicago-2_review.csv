2017-08-05,3.0,I usually eat here after partying along the strip of bars down the street. The burritos are BOMB and I am always in the mood for one. My go to is the steak with everything in it. Delish! The only downfall that I do not like for this restaurant specifically is that they do not carry green salsa AT ALL. No salsa verde in a Mexican restaurant ?!?! I literally will never understand. It makes absolutely no sense to me and it is my favorite kind of salsa. It compliments all Hispanic foods perfectly ! This is the only place I will eat a burrito without green salsa. The red is very VERY hot but not unbearable. GET SOME GREEN SALSA YOU GUYS !!!!!,0.5283,0.863,0.078,0.059,0.5884920634920635

But when I'm done sipping so much coffee, I always get hungry and look for somewhere good and affordable to eat.  Enter Allende Restaurant. This is quite possibly one of the cheapest Mexican restaurants in Chicago - nay, in the entire country - for the amount of food you get. If you don't know what to get, I strongly suggest their tortas, which are a version of Mexican tacos that come in the form of a sandwich. Undoubtedly, the best torta is the al pastor one, but the chorizo and steak ones are awesome too.  One of the things that I love about this place is that they cook the food as soon as you order it. That way you know it's fresh and it hasn't been laying around and waiting for next customer.  Allende is not necessarily the best place for a date or for any important meeting. But if you're looking for a cheap place to eat something substantive and on-the-go, I can't recommend Allende enough.",0.9795,0.841,0.145,0.014,0.4951754385964911

Allende is the best place for Mexican food in this area of Lincoln Park.  Portions are huge, food is excellent, and prices are low.  I love the veggie burrito here...... its my fave work-time lunch. This location can get a little crazy at lunchtime with Lincoln Park High kids... so avoid between11-1 for the most part.",0.9403,0.656,0.257,0.087,0.5783333333333334
2008-12-11,3.0,"Generally pretty good. It depends on what time of day or night you go there. When there's more drunks in there  the food quality will be much lower than on, say, a wednesday night. I would highly suggest the tacos, they are quite delicious and very fresh. It has been in Lincoln Park for quite a while, so if you go to DePaul, I suggest you get really drunk and stumble in their at about 4:40AM to get the true experience.",0.8908,0.775,0.171,0.054,0.624
2008-12-05,4.0,"The tastiest burritos in Chicago! Yeah- I said it! I've had 'em all over the country, and Allende's stands up to the Pepsi challenge every time!   My favorite's the chicken burrito with avocado.  Their fresh ingredients are what separate them from the other taquerias.   And the nicest burrito Lady in town!",0.8469,0.819,0.181,0.0,0.70625
2008-12-03,4.0,Awesome burritos and so cheap. Allende is the bomb! Open late for those who need something to absorb all the alcohol they consumed on Lincoln Ave. I am almost ashamed to admit I used to frequent Chipotle which in my opinion is like Americanized Mexican food. Then I discovered this little gem in the neighborhood! Waaaaayyyy better and more authentic too. I love the mural of the little man on the horse.,0.9537,0.727,0.239,0.033,0.5375

2008-10-16,4.0,"It's the littlest of things that distinguish one taqueria from the next.  Here it's the thick, smoky, chipotle salsa and 3 fresh juicy lime wegdes (one per taco) wrapped up in a piece of foil that came with my carry-out order.",0.3182,0.943,0.057,0.0,0.325
2008-09-30,2.0,"To be fair, I'm a big fan of the late night burrito and Allende has long been one of my favorite post-bar stops.  BUT BEWARE: I have noticed recently that the woman that works the register every night is a HUGE SCAM ARTIST!!! She will majorly overcharge anyone that looks like they're either drunk OR an unsuspecting first-time costumer. I'm so sick of being ripped off that I won't go to this location anymore. I'll either go to the one farther up Lincoln or Taco Burrito Palace II on Halsted. At those places I don't need to worry about getting charged $20 for nachos and a veggie burrito.",-0.7769,0.721,0.124,0.154,0.6507142857142857
2008-09-05,4.0,"OOOOOOOOO. I love me some Allende. Upon moving to Chicago years ago I was guided towards Allende. Everytime I eat here I come out stuffed full of delicious Mexican food. I reccommend burritos, tacos, and tortas. I mix it up and I am never dissapointed with their food.",0.836,0.832,0.168,0.0,0.5375
2008-07-13,3.0,"Allende is right around the corner from my house and open late, which are probably the 2 main reasons I'm a fan. I love being able to come home after a late night out and grab a tasty burrito. Allende serves all of the standard Mexican staples and serves breakfast too. I've had the veggie burrito, quesadilla and the nachos and all have been very good. Their prices are also really reasonable too, which is an added bonus. The only real negative about this place is the ""salsa"" they rightfully call hot sauce because (1) it is quite hot and (2) it has more of a thick ketchup consistency, than a chunky salsa, which I prefer (if I grab my food to go I usually use my own salsa at home). Note: Skip the cheese fries, it's just chihuaha cheese melted over fries. So not worth the price!",0.8334,0.873,0.089,0.037,0.5399523809523809
