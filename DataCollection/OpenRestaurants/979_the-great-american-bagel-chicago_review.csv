They're all good, in their own way. How could they not be? They're fresh, chewy, and filling. Slap on any of a wide variety of cream cheeses, add coffee or juice, and you've got a meal. I'm usually here for a sandwich in the afternoon. I work nearby, and on a long day, I dash over to Great American Bagel for a vegetarian sandwich. Yes, I am addicted to this sandwich. A choice of cheese, lettuce, tomato, green pepper, carrot, and baby, that's a whole meal. Add a cup of coffee, and I'm good to go till the late evening. Recently I had the grilled cheese Panini, and that was a mistake. It was so hot, the cheese actually ran like liquid. I didn't get much cheese texture, and it was more like toasted bread. Fail. I only try the vegetarian sandwiches, so I can't rate those sandwiches that contain slices of dead animals. Yuck. There is a parking lot in front, which usually isn't terribly crazy. The other businesses in this little strip mall don't get as much traffic as the GAB.  GAB also offers free Wi-Fi, and I've taken advantage of that lately. It's been a great help. Two small complaints, though. You can get a ""frequent flyer"" type card for the sandwiches. I used that a couple times for the vegetarian sandwich, until the occasion when a manager was there and said, oh no, you can't get that deal with the vegetarian sandwich. What gives? That sandwich costs less than the sandwiches with dead stuff on them. Still I keep going. However, last weekend, a co-worker said, oh no, that's wrong. She uses the frequent flyer card all the time for the vegetarian sandwich. She thinks it just depends on who's working. Again -- what gives? I'm there so much, the staff recognizes me. How about some consistency, GAB? And some fairness? They close at 3:00pm on Sunday. Could you please be open another half hour? Or an hour? I have to scramble to get there before close, and sometimes I don't make it. Yes, I keep going, even though I don't get the Frequent Flyer card and others do. Gggrrrrrr. . . .

The tomato was fresh and the cream cheese was good.  The center, as many Chicago bagels, tends to be overly dense, but still above average as far as local bagels go.  Beyond that, I like the small shop and the grunge-salon feel of the place.  Metropolis coffee is a BIG plus here as well.  Did I mention really good coffee!? The Bagel also had a decent crust, similar to Beans & Bagels, but the center was still more dense and had a cake-like rather than doughy consistency.  It was a little light on the poppy seeds as well.  The tomato was under ripe and the cream cheese was block-style Philadelphia brand. It was too heavy and thick and has a particular acid/sour flavor to it - which is why I don't use it at home.  Ambiance here isn't much to speak of: sturdy diner but rather unremarkable.  I'd meet up with someone here, but I would never choose it outright. Great American Bagel was neither ""great"" nor a ""bagel"".  Aside from being round with a hole in the middle, it had no real crust or crunchiness and the middle was a dense wonderbread style center.  The totmoatos were mealy but the cream cheese was good.  The place has a ""franchise feel"" to it, but today it definitiely got points off for a sour smell that seemed like someone hadn't cleaned the mop water before mopping the floor and a server at the counter who kept hocking up mucus in his throat while preparing my bagel.  If I get sick, I know who to blame.  This is a place I wouldn't go back to.",0.9963,0.79,0.164,0.046,0.42908008658008656

They also make awesome sandwiches with tons of fresh meat and veggies.  I love their turkey sandwiches on whole wheat bagel-- SO good!   The workers here area friendly and make everything fast.   Also, the $5 minimum purchase for credit cards does NOT exist anymore!  I'm always embarrassed when I used my card for $1 purchases but hey, I hardly ever have cash on me.   I really love this place and you should come here to get your bagels and/or sandwiches!",0.9964,0.696,0.265,0.039,0.5412698412698412
2008-02-12,1.0,"I'm not a fan of Great American Bagel for two reasons..  1) They call them bagels?!?!  I call them rubbery pieces of dough with a hole in them.  They are terrible! 2)  The place is always dirty.  The back counter where they prepare the sandwich's looks like they are cleaned once every 5 hrs.. The floors have crap all over them.. the trash is overflowing half the time..the place smells. I would not recommend this place to anyone... And like a previous reviewer of this establishment, I live a block away and i still drive to Sheffield/North for NYC Bagel- now that's a real bagel..",-0.9337,0.774,0.045,0.181,0.44833333333333325
2008-01-31,4.0,"Since the city of Chicago severely lacks neighborhood jewish delis that serve bagels, this is the next best alternative. Lox bagel w/everything with cucumber cream chese is a great treat, if not somewhat pricey; it kills Einstein's any day. Yes the decor stinks and the employees are a little spacey, but the bagels are high quality and very tasty.",0.4993,0.776,0.137,0.087,0.36124999999999996
2008-01-21,1.0,"If cleanliness is any sort of indicator in terms of how a restaurant is run, then avoid this place. It's a holy mess in there and the employees appear to wish they were anywhere else - and treat your food the same way. I was actually a little nervous eating my toasted bagel with cream chese, hoping I didn't come across a hair or a bug.",0.4005,0.78,0.123,0.098,0.26666666666666666
2007-10-22,1.0,"These are some of the worst bagels I've ever had.  I live a block away and we drive to NYC Bagel!  We used to go out of laziness alone. The texture of the bagels is all wrong (too bready, not chewy or crisp  enough).  And the coffee often tastes bad... like they forgot to clean out the coffee maker.  And several times the milk for coffee has been sour.

2007-07-12,4.0,"Oh the days of bagel consumption, how I miss thee. :( 1. Parking Lot! Yay.  2. Doggie bagels shaped like bones! (even though my dog only wanted the cream cheese and left a half gnawed, soggy doggy bagel on the floor).  3. All cream cheese is reduced fat. 'Cause seriously, it doesn't taste any different...and it's so much better for us folks! ;) 4. Good, wide selection of scrumptious bagels, bagel sandwiches and anything you can imagine bagle-wise.  5. Friendly workers, usually.  6. Fountain diet coke, hits the spot at 10am on Sunday...mmmmm.  Good place, quick, efficient, no frills, good food. $5 min for cc.",0.9692,0.7,0.233,0.066,0.555952380952381
2007-07-06,1.0,"This place is disgusting!   I'm a huge fan of Great American Bagel.  When I lived in the burbs, I went there every morning.  My addiction was so bad, the workers saw me in the parking lot and had my order waiting for me.  I was so excited when I moved to the city and saw a Great American Bagel.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with this location. It's dirty.  You walk in and are overpowered by this funky smell.  When I got my bagel, it tasted like cleaning fluid.  Even after my first horrible experience, I still decided to give it another chance.  I can't say things were better.",0.2556,0.65,0.183,0.167,0.6349999999999999
2007-07-05,4.0,"A few things worth mentioning: - The everything bagel has just the right amount of salt on it.  The salt is a crucial element of the everything that a lot of establishments leave out. - The veggie cream cheese may look bad, but it's really rather tasty. - The Tomato Cream Dream is a fantastic sandwich, even if it's just a bagel with cream cheese and a few veggies. - I think the Tomazzo bagel is disgusting.  Prove me wrong, Yelp.",-0.5023,0.75,0.105,0.144,0.5502380952380953
2007-05-01,3.0,Love the variety of bagels they have at Great American Bagel. The pizza bagel is so good oo and their jalapeno cheese bagel...delish! They also have a variety of not so run of the mill cream cheeses and their flavored coffees are super yummy. Wish I still worked in the area so I could come here more often but I guess it's better for my figure that I don't.,0.9448,0.758,0.242,0.0,0.5166666666666667

2007-02-13,2.0,"I need to go back again to make up my mind, but my first experience with this place was sub-par.  I had been by it thousands of times and had eaten at one 5 years ago.  I had some Tomazzo (pizza bagel) melt with provolone, roasted red peppers, onions, and spinach.  It had absolutely no taste.  I am not kidding.  Tasted like I was eating a hot tire.  I thought that it would be toasted or something, but I came right out of the microwave.  The rold gold pretzels were good, but I can't give GAB any credit for that, can I?",0.2267,0.856,0.071,0.072,0.4598639455782313
2006-09-20,4.0,"This is my absolute favorite place to get my breakfast. Sometimes I don't eat my breakfast until around 3 or 5:00 in the afternoon and they have really terrible hours. They only seem to be open at 10 in the morning and they don't have hours posted outside so it's always a gamble when I decide to make the whole 2 block excursion to see if they're open. They have sooo many delicious flavors to choose from! My favorites: everything bagel with regular cream cheese, sesame seed bagel with strawberry cream cheese and the everything bagel as a ham and cheese sandwhich. Delicious! They also have doggie bagels in the shape of bones which I always buy for the puppy. Although he doesn't seem to like them alot, I still think it's fun to pick something up for the dog while I'm at a resturaunt. I just hope I wasn't lucky enough to get a chocolate milk the morning after Jewlia K turned the refrigerators off.",0.882,0.823,0.115,0.062,0.6306837606837608
