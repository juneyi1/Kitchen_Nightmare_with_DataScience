Their menu is so long with so many items you're bound to find something you'll love. The inside has an old diner vibe which is A nice change of pace compared to other chicago restaurants. It's also very cheap! Each skillet is big with eggs and toast and only $12. I'd definitely recommend trying this place!,0.976,0.726,0.258,0.016,0.6345555555555555

Started coming a couple of years ago randomly and ALWAYS feel like family when we come in.  Now, even though we've moved downtown, we make the trip to come up for breakfast at least a few times a month. It's our treat to ourselves.  The family owners are a riot. Always funny and old school chicagoans. They'll give you are hard time if you're difficult but it's more like your family busting your chops. On slow days you can get to know the owners and long time staff.

2017-04-25,2.0,"I come here after German mass on Sundays and it's almost always packed. I don't mind waiting but it can get a bit hectic because there are so many tables and people bustling about that if you are a with a group of 4 or more I recommend NOT coming at peak times with the after-church crowd.  The food is decent - the omelettes and skillets are a bit greasy for my taste, the pancakes are good, the whipped butter is delightful - the coffee is strong (and bottomless, if you don't tell them no, you will have 15 cups of coffee before you know it) and the menu has so many options! They even offer beer, mimosas and bloodys if you're feeling frisky.  I wish I could give this place more stars but because of the grease (we've had tummy aches post-meal), the crowds and the grumpy owners, I feel two stars is justified. I know he deals with a lot of people and I never like writing about service unless it's consistently poor, but the owner makes me feel like I'm a bad kid who is holding up the line. He doesn't greet you in the friendliest manner and he once flat out rudely stated he can't split checks without explaining what we should do. I have no problem with the not splitting checks part - it was the way he talked to me that I disliked. We figured it out on our own and all was well, but I feel like they need to make that policy clear. Write it on the menu or train the servers to tell people they will only split checks if you ask at the table and not at the register.  It's a conveniently located breakfast spot when you leave St. Al's. Maybe we'll try the Golden Nugget or Apple place on the other side of the street next time...",0.8981,0.775,0.127,0.098,0.5595238095238095

There might be a wait on the weekends especially on Sunday but since there are a lot of spots and they serve the food fast, the wait is not too long.  The few times that I have been here, I've ordered the waffles and a few skillets. Waffles are delicious and simple which is how I like them. They have an insane list of skillets, a full page long, probably close to 20 or more. The skillets are great and huge so it is a great choice if you want a little bit of everything.

2017-01-11,1.0,"It bums me out to write a bad review about this place because I love an old school diner. But, there is no excuse for an owner to treat customers in such a rude and unacceptable manner and to embarass them? No.  I stopped by on a weekend for brunch only because my best friend's Mom had been admitted to intensive care that week and I wanted to bring her liver and onions, which she loves so much - and because  hospital food. There was a long line and we waited patiently. The owner - an unpleasant, mustached, loud Greek man was behind the counter and a call came in as we were waiting. I (and anyone within 10') heard him yell at the person on the other end (who I guess was asking about the wait time) ""If you're in a hurry - don't come here!"" (click) he hung up on the caller!  It was one of those uncomfortable moments where people don't know how to react (soup Nazi anyone?) so most of us waiting in line or sitting at the counter looked at eachother in amazement and some nervous laughter. I thought, 'Wait, am I at one of those joints where the schtick is to be rude to customers?' If it hadn't been for my friend's Mom - we'd have left then. We were finally seated and I ordered an omelette with hashbrowns 'well done' and a to go of liver and onions for my friend's Mom. My friend had an omelette too. When it came out (finally) the hashbrowns were far from well done or brown for that matter - but the omelette was super brown, dry and over cooked. It just looked extremely unappetizing. My partner in brunch wasn't thrilled with his either. I told the waitress and apologized - because I couldn't eat it and I rarely send things back unless I can't eat it. It's awkward. She said no problem, she would have them re-do it. I would've passed but It was 1 pm by the time we sat down and I hadn't eaten a thing yet. About 5 minutes later the owner walks up and stands  at least 6' away from our table and shouts angrily (loud enough you could here a pin drop afterwards) ""We're too busy, we're not going to remake it for you! We'll take take it off your bill, but THAT'S IT!!"" And turned on his heels muttering to himself as he stormed back behind the counter. I could still hear him going on about it for a minute or so to himself after he was back behind the counter and we were not close and it was packed. Totally unprofessional. The whole place was looking at us. I could feel the blood rushing to my face from embarrassment. He didn't apologize, ask what the issue was - it was insane! He was so rude, LOUD and dismissive. I was livid. I was so frazzled I ended up with a parking ticket too because I forgot to check my app. Jerk.  I love a good dive and personality - but this was just wrong and this guy owes me an apology. Can't believe this place has 4 stars! Enter at your own risk. As far as me and my friends?

I hate adding salt to my dish after all of the ingredients blend together because IMO it alters the dish to taste like nothing but salt. Had the hashbrowns been adequately salted before wedding the peppers, onions, tomatoes, italian sausage, and mozzarella, the dish would have been perfect.

Like many people I don't generally carry cash anymore so I say ""on the card,"" then they ask ""how much?"" and enter it directly into the card machine. So you're forced to declare your tip verbally, often in listening proximity of several people. At all restaurants I give a decent tip of around 20% (unless I have a very good reason not to) so it's not that I feel pressure to give a good tip, or that I would like to stiff the server and feel deprived of this opportunity. It's just, why do it this way? Why not let people write their tip on the payment slip like everywhere else? It just feels off-color to force diners to say the tip out loud. Whatever, maybe a silly complaint to some but it's a shame to cap off a good dining experience with something kind of weird and off-putting like that.",0.8383,0.809,0.118,0.073,0.5562280701754386

When you first arrive:  Sam & George's gives the classic diner vibe with ample booths which is a plus. Sam & George's is extremely spacious with tons of seating in the front and in the back room. No matter how busy the restaurant is you will not have to wait too long to be seated.  Service:  The waitress we had was very pleasant but one waitress was extremely overbearing and made my friend and I feel uncomfortable.  Food:  I ordered the avocado skillet which is essentially hash browns, avocado, eggs, toast, and four cheeses.After receiving my food I noticed that they gave me a ton of avocado which is typically a great thing but 70% of the avocado they gave me was brown. I decided to remove the brown avocado and place it on a separate place and a waitress that was nearby started questioning me as to why I didn't eat it. She even tried to force brown avocado on my friend that I was with. She obviously wasn't doing it out of malice but she couldn't take the obvious hit that we wanted her to leave us alone.  Aside from the brown avocado the entire meal was cold and lacked so much flavor. I was both disappointed and impressed with the food. I was disappointed because everything I order was so basic and left little room to mess it up. I was equally impressed because they found a way to mess up a basic skillet and make me dislike my first diner.

During the 65 minutes I was there this week, he *continually* chastised his staff over minor matters. He was very rude to a customer about the doneness of a steak or something he ordered. He moped about the place and generally cast his negative voodoo vibes all over the restaurant. I could not believe how he addressed his staff .... Very rude! This individual needs to retire or go away or something. He made me feel so uncomfortable that I left before I was finished eating. I had indigestion, not from the food, but from his shit-ass attitude.",-0.96,0.77,0.085,0.145,0.5610526315789475

But the night before, when we were about to go to sleep - completely exhausted from our 82 mile Chicago walking day - I turned to him and said, ""How about we get 4 hours instead of 3 hours of sleep tonight, ditch the schfancy reservation, and walk around Lakeview until we find a place to eat breakfast at?"" And that's how we happened upon an incredible breakfast at Sam & George's. At this super duper laid back diner, they specialize in the friendliest, chattiest servers in the world, the freshest fresh-squeezed orange juice in the Americas, and the most robust, incredible egg skillets to have ever graced my lips. It was a beautiful accident ending up at Sam & George's, and the bf will probably still affirm that this was his favorite meal we had in Chicago.",0.9067,0.84,0.112,0.048,0.5658119658119658
2015-07-20,1.0,"My friend and I have been going to S&G for months now and the experience has always been cute and quaint, like that of a typical American diner.  Last weekend I ordered a their avocado, bacon, lettuce, & tomato sandwich and added cheese.  The waitress taking our order was rushing and looked annoyed after she received word, from the owner (right in the middle of talking to us), that some other customer was in a hurry and she should hurry up with us.  Fine.  We could overlook that. Once the food came, I noticed that my sandwich was missing the cheese.  I waived the waitress over and she took the sandwich back to get it remedied.  The sandwich came back completely falling apart.  There was no way I could hold it.  Furthermore, when I did squish things back into the relative shape of a sandwich, every time I picked it up, all the ingredients would fall right back out. Despite all my attempts, I could no longer ignore the sandwich-less qualities and soggy bread from the side of cole slaw.  I saw the waitress and asked her to remake the sandwich because this one was unsalvageable.  She apologized and took the sandwich back. Within 30 seconds the owner comes over to our table, stands 5 feet away, and starts yelling to us that this is an ABLT and that's just how it is - it will always fall apart.  We calmly replied that an ingredient was forgotten and when the sandwich came back it was in pieces and the bread was soggy.  He continued to shout loud enough for the rest of the customers to hear - ""that's what the sandwich is, I'm not making you a new one.... choose something else from the menu because I'm not making you this sandwich again.""  How embarrassing and rude!  I felt like a little kid getting reprimanded for being too picky at the dinner table.  The other customers seemed to feel it too as they looked around and down at their plates nervously. I have NEVER experienced such rudeness in any restaurant.  I was willing to put up with his smoking in the restaurant but not with how he spoke to us. We will never be going there again. Notice: the negative reviews of this place usually reference their average/sub-average food or the rude behavior of the owner/manager older man with the mustache.",-0.9019,0.895,0.036,0.069,0.3754371445547916

The menu had pretty standard breakfast options with a pretty huge selection of skillet options. I got the ""Godfather"" which has Italian sausage, onion, hash brown, and mozzarella cheese. At first, I thought it tasted a bit bland, but I added a little ketchup on it and it was good to go.  I definitely agree with the post about feeling a bit rushed.

From asking me if I know how to read, to me initiating a greeting as I walk in the door, only for him to roll his eyes and answer me with, ""It's terrible. What? You expect me to stand here and lie and tell you it's good?"" Then proceeds to yell at the staff for them to do their job. Once, I went in looking for my keys that dropped and the older man (no mustache) greeted me and was the absolute sweetest. And the wait staff has always been friendly as well.  I'd give this place 5 stars if it weren't for that one man who is clearly in the wrong industry and definitely in the wrong position. Serving is not your strong suit, sir.

I sat on the porch myself which was lovely. Dog friendly! :) Service: Friendly host with NO wait (does that even exist on a Saturday morning?) for outdoor seating. Score! The waitress was also very attentive. Food: For their, brunch, skillets are king. I got the chicken fried steak skillet which was yummy. The biscuit that accompanied it could have been flakier and the white gravy would have been creamier, but I have to keep telling myself I'm not in the south. Overall: Great neighborhood brunch spot that I would recommend for a quick meal with (at least in my experience) little to no wait on a weekend summer day.",0.9833,0.745,0.206,0.048,0.5392857142857144

2014-08-04,5.0,"So let me set the scene. I live in the neighborhood and have walked by this place a thousand times. I've always assumed that it would be a crappy diner best saved for those seeking an average bite given the number of brunch spots nearby (i.e. why would I go to S&G when I could go to the likes of Batter & Berries or Bakin N Eggs).  On a Sunday which happened to be my girlfriend's birthday, she suggested we check out S&G and the look I gave her was no doubt incredulous (yes, I can be a brunch snob). Nevertheless, I hardened up and prepared for the disappointment that was to come...my girlfriend amused at my discomfort and my stomach readying itself for the impending disaster. Before I continue, I should preface by saying I have no problem with eating at diners. I had anticipated going somewhere a little ""nice"", however, given the state of our hangovers, my girlfriend made an executive decision not to wait in line at some of the nearby establishments. We arrived at S&G and were promptly greeted by a friendly middle aged waitress who asked us to take a sit wherever we liked. Not having to wait was refreshing and I looked around with unease at my surroundings as we took up seats at one of the booths. Family photographs and 50's decor splattered the diner. Jeez this place had been around for a while.  Another friendly staff member took our drink order, a couple orange juices, which arrived promptly. They were fresh and refreshing, my brain notifying me that this was likely to be the highlight. As we looked through the expansive menu, I couldn't help but overhear the owner, or who I'm assuming to be the owner, having conversations with groups of customers who were no doubt regulars. He came over and asked how we were doing and I gave him a nervous smile. Moments later the friendly waitress that sat us took our order, we both ordered breakfast skillets (I had the greek style gyros skillet and my girlfriend ordered one with steak). While we were waiting I couldn't help but feel the friendly family vibe within the establishment. A cute older greek woman manning the cashier, the owner with his thick accent (sounded New York), regularly checking up on customers and thanking his staff for picking up the slack. A 90's Richard Gere flick, First Knight playing on the sole television by the entrance and another woman paying close attention to customer coffees which needed a top up.  Our enormous skillets arrived, the gyro chunks didn't look great....but as I took my first bite of the eggs/hash/gyro/tzatziki combination my taste buds fucking exploded. WTF!! JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!! THIS IS FUCKING DELICIOUS!!  The next 10 minutes were very special, I gave that skillet the attention it deserved, I devoured it with the sexual aggression a cougar has towards her prey. I did look up now and then to acknowledge the comparatively insignificant conversation my girlfriend was attempting, while at the same time trying some of her delicious steak.

But you know what?  The service was unfussy, fast, and accommodating.  They let us move to an outside table even after we'd gotten coffee and water inside, they came by frequently to refresh coffee and water, and they were very friendly.  Most importantly, this is the kind of place that you can walk in and be seated immediately for brunch at 11:25 a.m. on a summer Sunday morning in Lincoln Park.  For all of that, I think they're worth four stars after all.

2014-05-25,2.0,"Stopped by Sam and George's today, and was *terribly* unimpressed.  The advertisements on the wall convinced me to get iced coffee instead of hot. Sadly, my iced coffee was served to me in a dirty glass. You could still see the lip prints from the last customer who used it. When they replaced it, they filled it so full of coffee and ice that it was impossible to take a sip without spilling it. They left absolutely no room for sugar or cream, despite the advertisements being of coffee with cream in it. I personally hate the taste of plain coffee, but I had to drink several gulps to be able to fit in any cream or sugar. My husband ordered the country fried steak & eggs with a side of corned beef hash. He only ordered the corned beef hash because we were assured that it was made fresh and that it did not come out of a can. It most certainly was *not* freshly made. It was a plate full of salty mush. His sunny-side up eggs were so under-cooked that when he put them on top of the hash, I couldn't help but remark about how gross it was that there was so much runny, uncooked egg white and that I would be afraid to eat it. There was so much of it that he was able to remove 2 gooey forkfuls. As for my breakfast, based on the suggestion of our waitress, I ordered a chicken finger skillet with gravy. It was passable. As other reviewers have mentioned, the skillets are humongous. I couldn't even finish half of it, and I am not a small lady. I don't think I'd order it again unless I was out drinking late and had someone to share it with. Lastly, they offered my husband multiple refills on his hot coffee, but never once offered me a refill on my iced coffee, so I drank a lot of water. The only reason that I'm giving 2 stars and not one is that our waitress was sweet and funny.

The menu is positively giant but I always find myself coming back to their egg casseroles (otherwise known as skillets) and I'd have to say that Porky's Cousin may be the best hangover cure I've ever found outside of a McDonald's. It's a ton of food that is always perfectly prepared and you never have to wait too long. Need I say more?

Then when trying to scramble to pay, he told us he did not have time for this and that one of us needed to pony up for the $50 tab. He rushed one of us into paying on a card and after we comented on how rude he was being he told us he will chalk this up as a terrible experience for the two of us.

The wait staff was courteous and the owner(?) at the cash register was super sweet, but the food wasn't what I expected. The split pea soup was pretty good, but I didn't care for the croutons that came with it. They were greasy and didn't really do much to complement the flavor of the soup. I also ordered the chicken Philly which was a real disappointment. The chicken was rubbery and didn't have much flavor, the melted cheese had the same consistency as the chicken, and even the grilled onions and mushrooms lacked flavor. The French bread was OK, but I didn't really care since the rest of the sandwich was so bland. I got a side of tater tots, which I guess was the best part of the meal.  Normally I would give a place like this 2 stars instead of 3, but I'll give it another try someday and order something else.

While we were eating they threw Sam his shirt. And there was no charge despite offering. You just don't see that much these days. Great people... Now onto the food...it was AMAZING. The toast and english muffins are addictive. Their omelet was the perfect balance of cheese, meat and egg. The mickey mouse pancake face is a hit with the kids.

If you're a regular, it seems, they're all over you.  If you haven't been there enough to be a regular (read: once), service isn't nearly as good. I went there for lunch today.  Beautiful day, wanted to sit outside. The sign outside said go inside to get seated out there.  So I did that.  The cashier (an older man, maybe an owner?) was chatting with the two customers at the register. I'm guessing that more than a minute passed before finally a woman came out (maybe another owner -- not dressed like waitstaff, probably my age) and said I could choose a table out there.  There were two occupied tables outside and I didn't see anyone seated inside unless they were in the back.  Still, it took a little while to get service.  Owner lady was leaving with her daughter and mentioned that my waitress was on her way. She seemed like the only one for whom customer service was a concern. Once the waitress did take my drink order, it was quick with both a carafe of water and tea from her and the busboy.  I had several minutes to peruse the lengthy menu and made my choice.  *twiddling thumbs...actually, looking a phone* Menu closed.  The other waitress asked if my waitress had been by.  Yes, to get my drink order. So she finally comes out and takes my order.  Asked if I wanted toast with my skillet. Yes, please. She also took the time to chat with table next to me -- clearly regulars based on their conversation.  Order comes out pretty quickly minus the toast.  The Gypsy Skillet was good and it was hot.  Didn't exactly miss the toast but did order it. Again it took a while before the waitress came back with the check.  She asked if I wanted a to go box.  Yes, please. She then went to the new table seated on the patio and chatted with those gentlemen for several minutes. Wonder if she has short term memory issues --- no toast, no box for the to go.  The busboy came by to ask if I was done. I told him that I wanted the to go box that he brought quickly.   When I went inside to pay, there were 4 tables occupied so busier than before. Still, there were at least two waitresses and not that many tables. The owner man wasn't rude but not exactly friendly.   I'll probably return at some point because the skillet was so darn good but as close as I live to the restaurant, I don't see myself becoming a regular.",0.9441,0.893,0.076,0.031,0.418499555999556

Neither of us had been before, but BOTH of us will be back :)  The staff was very friendly, and we were seated promptly on the patio.  We brought our own bottle of wine and were provided with glasses.  We also got a pitcher of water for continued hydration. Yippee.  Our fur-children were received warmly, and were not the only ones. Now for the food. We got 2 skillets and shared both. Variety is the spice of life! Kevin L's Special skillet, with gyros and feta and jalapenos, because my friend was craving spicy. Amaaaazing. La Bamba skillet, with chorizo and cheese and 2 eggs on top. Again, AMAZING. Both skillets were very flavorful. It's very possible to ruin a skillet by putting too much faith in the potato, but S&G goes big with the flavor.  I'm not sure if we were just enjoying ourselves so much surrounded by the flower boxes, sitting right next to the lovely St Alfonsus church, or if the food really did come out that quickly, but we were starving and happy that the food seemed to arrive very quickly.

I went in with the plan to order the skillet, and goshdarnit - I shoulda stuck with it. I saw a corned beef omelet on the menu and it reminded me of this creation that I had in Vegas with a giant thing of corned beef smothered in swiss cheese with eggs on the side. It was by far the most earth shattering breakfast I ever consumed and actually was far too rich to consume something like that upon waking up from a hangover, but come on, it's Vegas! I got that vision in my head and wanted to re-live it all over again. Sadly, this was nothing like that. When I walked in, I was convinced that I wasn't in the right restaurant. For such a successful restaurant, I would think they would have remodeled at least once since the 70's but I guess they want to stick with the original charm. The owner was a bit brusk with us due to the fact it was so overwhelmingly busy, but he wasn't brusk in a mean way - just in a hurried way. We were seated and immediately poured a couple glasses of water, while we looked over the menu. It took a few minutes for the waitress to come over to us, but we were both able to decide what we wanted. My mom opted for the eggs benedict and I went with the freshly squeezed OJ, Greek toast (upon Yelp recommendations) and the corned beef and swiss omelet. Our food was out rather quickly, so we were pleasantly surprised.  The OJ was fabulous in the way that the freshly squeezed sort always is, albeit a little sweet. I devoured it rather quickly and found myself wishing I would have savored it. The greek toast was also really good. I normally find myself not eating the bread, but I ate all of theirs. I liked the hashbrowns a lot, as they were half crispy and half soft. My mother on the otherhand hated them as she prefers hers ""extra crispy."" The omelet was way overcooked and almost that rubbery texture that eggs can get. While corned beef normally adds an over-saltyness that I'm quite fond of, this variety didn't add much salt to it. Supposedly there was swiss on it, but I couldn't taste any. For our breakfasts, it was only $23 plus tip. I thought this was a great value for two huge breakfasts that filled me up till dinner. Next time I will return and get one of those skillets. The people next to us ordered them and they looked wonderful!",0.996,0.811,0.158,0.031,0.5512566137566138

While it might be more of a walk to S & G than our previous joint, it's so worth it.  When we went every table was full and only 2 seats open at the counter.  But we only had to wait for about 3 minutes before a table opened and we were seated.  We were greeted warmly and genuinely by both the cashier/hostess & the owner/chef.  The wait and bus staff were all just as friendly.  Skillets were the order of the morning and they were excellent, filling to the point of not being able to finish. The most impressive experience was not ours but one we witnessed.  A couple was seated two tables away from us.  They were sitting there for a pretty significant period of time without being approached by a server.  Ordinarily, I'd say that's unacceptable.  But to be fair, the place was sardine-packed and there are times when a turned table gets overlooked.  A manager approached them and asked if a server had taken their order.  They politely said no.  The manager apologized and assured them someone would be right over.  She left their table and went directly to a server.  That server immediately went to the table, also apologizing, taking their order, and placing it (I had a full view of the kitchen pickup window).  Then the chef/owner came over, apologized and said that their breakfast would be on him.  Their breakfast was expedited and they were dining within 5-7 minutes of placing their order.

We tumbled across S&G because the other restaurant closed without a warning and my boyfriend was about to pass out from hunger. The place was empty, but it was also 6:00pm on a Saturday afternoon. We sat outside and enjoyed the nice weather. The waitress came over momentarily and bought us 2 glasses and a huge bottle of water - a plus for her. Now since the man was about to pass out - I didn't even have a chance to look at their extensive menu - I was forced to order right away!  I got a mushroom burger and he got a reuben sandwich. The interesting part was the meal comes with fries and soups, and pickles. We told the waitress to bring out the soup right away or else someone might lose conscious. She was taken back but seemed to understand.  However that was unnecessary. Within 2 minutes the waitress came back with our soups, plenty of crackers, and some dinner rolls with butter. When we started burying our face in the food, she quickly came back with our sandwich, burgers and fries. So within 5 minutes of ordering, we literally covered our table with foods. There was enough food to feed 4 people, not 2.  Even though I was very impressed with the quick services, and very much enjoyed the soups and rolls, my burger was yucky! Yes, yucky! It tasted like old frozen patty near its expiration date. I ate not even 1/2 or it, but I was so full from everything else. My boyfriend's sandwich was a little bit better, but the sauerkraut was tooo sour, another yuck!  Everything was cheap - and for the amount of food it was very cheap.

2010-10-13,5.0,"I recently got up one particularly groggy Saturday morning to make steak and eggs using my stove and charcoal grill. I charred the steak beyond recognition by leaving it on the grill too long. The steak was then thrown out in pieces after trying to cut it up into some sort of useful, somewhat tasty meat, as this hapless effort failed miserably. Thankfully, S&G was right down the street, and what a delicious breakfast/brunch gem of an establishment this place is. Extremely fast service, great servers (the place is owned by three families and it always appears that everyone is related to one another), great coffee, countless menu options, and everything served fresh with every possible spread you could imagine for toast, your entree, etc. To top it all off, every single table in the place contains two bottles of random hot sauce. (Being a huge hot sauce fan, this is a major plus). You know how when you walk out of a mediocre breakfast place and upon exiting you turn to your friend/significant other/spouse/partner and say something to the effect of, ""you know, that kinda sucked, we shouldn't go back there - I can't put my finger on what was wrong, but it was just, blah."" Well, upon exiting S&G, you will feel a) full of delicious food, and b) counting down the 24 hours left before it's breakfast/brunch time again. Do not miss the Athenian Egg Casserole. Feta+gyro meat+eggs+hash browns+onions+peppers = pure breakfast bliss. Turning back to the steak debacle, upon returning from S&G that fateful Saturday morning, we discovered that the dog got into the trash, devoured what was left of the charred meat and ended up with explosive diarrhea for two days.

2010-07-28,2.0,"Three of us woke up on Sunday morning with a serious need for ""diner breakfast"".  After a quick Yelp search, we were on our way to Sam & George's.  There was a line, but it moved quickly and the owner was constantly there to take care of anyone who was waiting. Did we want coffee, water or pop? If so, it was brought in less than 30 seconds.  They turn tables pretty fast here and the bus boys are seriously some of the quickest and most talented I've seen. After 10 minutes or so, we were seated in a booth in the front of the restaurant.  The menu is a little overwhelming. Just because you have 200 ways to combine your ingredients, doesn't mean you should list them all.  My two companions each got one of the famed skillet melt things while I ordered a bowl of soup. I know. Weird. BUT while waiting in line, I had seen at least 6 people order the soup with a little basket of rolls and thought they must know something I didn't.  Our server was young and probably inexperienced. She didn't remember who ordered what or that I'd asked for the rolls with my soup (the rolls cost extra). My soup actually didn't come out until about 5 minutes after everyone else's food cause it was forgotten.  The ""homemade"" chicken with rice soup tasted... okay. I didn't have a single piece of chicken in the whole bowl, and it didn't taste too terribly different than Progresso, so I'm not sure what the big deal was. After my rolls were forgotten, I asked for a side of hash browns instead. These were also forgotten in the window for some time, but when they finally did come out, they were good. You can tell a LOT of butter went into the making of those potatoes.  Both the skillets were pretty gross. Both guys I was with are pretty big eaters and they both left more than half their meals on the table. The quality of ingredients just wasn't there, and at a pretty high price for diner breakfast food, I expected more than undercooked bacon and what tasted like canned mushrooms thrown on top of hashbrowns and covered with globs of cheddar cheese and scrambled eggs. Yuck.  Sorry Sam & Georges.

A fellow gastronome and myself headed here this morning with high hopes, based on the Yelp rating.  One of our favorite places, Bakin and Eggs, is just a few doors down, but we decided to pass in favor of a new adventure.  Boy, were we disappointed. The food was sub-par, something you might expect at a Denny's or Ram's horn.  I don't understand what all of the buzz is about.  The only thing that was exciting was the kitschy decor - local teams plaques hung on the wall and random art scattered about. So, we agreed it was ok, and would probably settle on rating this eatery a 2 or 3 on Yelp.  Until we went to the front to pay.  Yikes. Well, the itemized bill said .50 next to potatoes well done and I asked what the extra charge was for.  They told me it was probably for the sourdough bread I ordered (is there really a valid reason for an upcharge on 2 slices of sourdough over two slices of white or rye?  REALLY?)  My friend said, okay, well you should tell people that when they order.  The owner came over and snarled that it was written on the menu.  We explained that we read it pretty thoroughly and did not notice and suggested waitresses might mention that there is an upcharge whenever someone orders something that requires one - just a friendly piece of advice; feedback from a customer. Well, that didn't go over so well.  The owner started yelling us and telling us we should eat somewhere else then, including some obscenities.  He also went on a tangent saying that we had four dollar drinks from Starbucks in our hands, so we could probably handle paying the fifty cents and that fifty cents is not a lot of money.  Thank god he didn't notice her Louis Vuitton bag.  My friend responded that we might next time, but that it wasn't about the money, it was just the principle and that we couldn't understand why he was so upset about our suggestion.  He then screamed, ""Please don't come here ever again"".  Whoa - what an idiot.  Oh, and by the way, it cost just as much money to eat at this dump as it would have to go to Bakin and Eggs or Bongo Room or somewhere else delicious.",0.9911,0.794,0.152,0.054,0.45362758014931925

But food was in order and as we looked up and down the street, S & G's came into view.  ""A diner! Yay! We shall feast for little money"". . . .or so we thought.  As we pushed open the door of this corner establishment and heard and saw the bustle and din of a diner my heart leapt. Food and drink were only minutes away. We quickly seated ourselves by the window and perused the menu.  I could hear the cooks shouting out to their regulars encouraging people to order this or that before they ran out of it that day (probably should have listened to them). Now after looking at the reviews on Yelp- I probably should have gone with breakfast but it was lunch I was craving so I stayed focused on that part of the menu.  I ordered a turkey club sandwich with tots and a bowl of potato soup and my friend had the chili and a patty melt with fries. Still sounds good to me but the execution on a few of the items needed a little work. While my sandwich was good (and tots rule any day!) my soup was just okay- hot but tasting more like green peppers than anything else.  My friend didn't fare as well, however. He had asked for his chili to be topped with cheese and onions and when it came- not only was the chili not hot- the cheese was a slice of American cheese laid across the top! Never saw that before. And of course it never melted as the chili wasn't hot. And his patty melt? Came on white bread. A patty melt is only a patty melt when it comes on a nice rye in my book. Very odd for a diner of this type. And to make it worse- his fries were old and cold. Usually diners nail the basics!  Service was quick (thank heaven as I needed FOOD!) parking was a breeze on this stretch of Lincoln and the ambiance of the place, while a little 1980's was clean. Check out the bathrooms-as nice as they come.  The downside- it was a little pricey for a diner. We ended up spending almost $40 on lunch. Guess it might have been worth it if all the food had been great.  The good news? The gremlin in me was sated regardless and we were able to continue on our day without it rearing it's ugly head again.

2007-05-01,4.0,"I love the Golden Apple when I'm drunk, but if I'm sober I'll usually head to the S&G instead.  None of the non-breakfast items at the Apple are any good, whereas everything I've had at the S&G is pretty respectable for diner food. The turkey dinner plate is unbeatable if you can't wait for Thanksgiving to get your turkey fix. Burgers are average and the other sandwiches are decent. They also have homemade soups daily which are always really good. The fries are the only downside to their menu. For breakfast, there's a million different choices. They have upwards of 30 different egg skillets with every combination you can think of. My only complaint about their breakfast is that the hash browns aren't as good as the Golden Apple. I think it has to do with them actually cleaning the grill. Overall, it's one solid place that I would visit during drunk hours if they were open late. What's really great about this place is the atmosphere. John is almost always there and is really friendly, at least when he's not yelling at one of his workers. I've overheard some of the most interesting conversations of my life while sitting at the counter here. One time I heard two older women discussing strategies for winning at Lottery scratch off tickets. I'm still trying to wrap my mind around that one. Another day two people were arguing about which casino offers the better frequent players benefits and has looser slots.
