We chose a table right by the windows so felt like we were outside, which was wonderful as the weather was perfect that day.  The decor inside felt very French and the music was very charming. Our waitress was very professional, and the service overall was great. She brought out bread and butter to start, and both were delicious (although the bread wasn't warm). We ordered 2 cocktails: the Alliance Française (like a Old Fashioned) and one with gin and cucumber puree. Both were delicious, but the gin and cucumber puree one in particular was incredible and very refreshing. Highly recommend it! We ordered the Pâté Traditionnel (duck liver), Salade Lyonnaise, and Salade Anchoïade. All were delicious and very fairly priced. I have had better versions of all 3 at other restaurants, but have had to pay much more for them as they were at more expensive restaurants. For the price and quality, Bistro Zinc is a great value.  I would definitely come back here again and recommend it.",0.9915,0.753,0.217,0.031,0.5875573192239858

2017-04-14,2.0,"I've been going back and forth as to whether to post a review of a recent dinner experience at Bistrot Zinc, my first visit in at least 10 years. The service was excellent, so no complaints there. The atmosphere and decor was above average, so also no complaints there. (I do think they could step it up a little with the chairs, serving ware and decor, but it was acceptable).  My main complaint is the food quality. I had the liver (foie de veau)  and my dinner companions had the beef stew and steak frites. The liver was below average in quality and taste. The method of preparation - placing the calf liver on a bed of mashed potatoes with two fried onion rings on top - is also questionable. I tried the beef stew, which was not much better, if any, from a can of Dinty Moore. Both dishes were also over salted. I did not try the steak frites so I cannot comment, other than the portion being small. We split the bill and I paid for 2 plates and a bottle of wine. With tax and tip, that came ro $120. It was not worth it.  I am born and raised in Chicago and I also lived in France for 3 years. What bothers me most is that it not only does this restaurant not do French cuisine justice, but also Chicago's version of quality French food. Simply put, they can do better and if you are looking for a genuine French culinary experience in Chicago, I do not recommend Bistrot Zinc.",-0.9243,0.867,0.034,0.099,0.3711080586080587

2017-03-31,3.0,"This is the largest of a number of French bistros in the area. Because it is large, it tends to be noisier, but not unbearably so; it just affects the intimacy, which seems better at the others. The decor is traditional, and the menu also looks fairly traditional. However I found the execution of the food to somehow feel a bit like Americans trying to make French recipes using American ingredients. As a result, there wasn't anything that really came together with the clarity and complexity of flavors you'd find in Paris. We started with the mussels, which were in a creamy broth, however some of them were quite fishy. The Salade Lyonnaise was a traditional preparation; the dressing was quite vinegary and the lardons were extremely smokey. Smoked salmon was a fairly small serving atop a giant mound of potato salad... a bit odd. The chicken crepe was fine. The special, Walleye with almond brown butter, was probably the best entree. Poulet Grand Mere, a house specialty, was just okay; the mushrooms, onions and potatoes in the accompanying stew were very, very cooked. Our server was very busy, so his visits to the table seemed rushed and infrequent.

We went there for a birthday dinner a Saturday evening at 8.30PM. We sat down and started to order our meals and everything was great. Then, the waiter denied us drinks because he thought we were ""over served"". We clearly were not. Yes I had some stains of wine on my shirt but it doesn't give the restaurant the right to judge you. Clearly, we went in, sat down and order part of the meal. If we would have been over served, we wouldn't even have made in. That's the definition of over served. I chatted with the manager who couldn't be more rude about the situation. Nonetheless to say you ruined our night. We decided to leave while the appetizers were put down on our table. I paid what was cooked but we didn't even eat it. I think that if you do not want to serve alcohol to someone, you need to be a better judge than you were and handled the situation appropriately. Nonetheless to say, I will never recommend this restaurant again to anyone, and thankfully for us, there are many others french restaurant options in Chicago, therefore we will give our business elsewhere and not be ever back again.

Chalk it up to the lack of good bakeries in Chicago, but the bread is dismal--cold, tough, and bland, and served with a ramekin of rock-hard butter. Service also suffers from the (perhaps authentically French) lack of warmth; the spirit of hospitality is as feigned as most people's church attendance. Voices rise and fall in an almost patronizing manner, and smiles don't come easily.  But the focus of a restaurant is the food, is it not? And BZ's sumptuous bistro fare makes it easy to love. The soupe du jour--one day a chunky melange of summer vegetables, the next a rich potage of potato, carrot, and caraway--is a hearth for the soul. I can never resist ordering the shaved endive salad, crisp and with a delicious bitterness offset by pungent Roquefort and a sharp Banyuls vinaigrette. Accompanied by zesty watercress and pickled onions, juicy slices of lamb leg find a righteous home between soft, toasted slices of pain de mie. And the impeccable frites--thin, crisp, and judiciously salted--almost steal the spotlight from a perfectly chewy hanger steak with herb butter.",0.9495,0.718,0.171,0.111,0.6203703703703702

2016-04-24,5.0,"My favorite French place.. Definitely the most authentic French restaurant I have seen so far in Chicago.  Appetizers: duck liver pate.. Yes, bread is hard for American standards, but that's how it goes there... It's toasted baguette. (Btw. Complementary baguette and butter is already wort going there).  Entrees: we had poule grand mere (half chicken with stewy sauce) and the second time the vol-au-vent (stew with puff pastry similar to pot pie) Dessert: creme brûlée, only point for improvement. This was good too but could have had a little less caramelized sugar topping.  Wine selection is great, very good German, French and Italian wines for a good price.  Great value for your money if you think about the complex French cuisine. Appetizers ~$10, entrees $20-30, dessert $8. Especially for river north this is priced very well.  Last but not least..

Set amid the rolling hills of construction and questionable outfits that is the viagra triangle, Bistrot Zinc's red-hued facade invites one in and then locks the door behind (...figuratively, usually). And thank goodness that they do, because the interior is relaxed with the timeless hipness that the world used to do so well. One of the few restaurants I've been to that invites you to sit at the bar and sip coffee, read the newspaper and casually dine. The croque monsieur and the vegetable crepes were quite tasty, although the waiter was somewhat standoffish and seemed to be inconvenienced that he had to serve us (a rude Frenchman? Well, I never!). Also never refilled our waters even though both were empty within minutes of sitting down, all of which caused a loss of a star. To ensure a preserved ambiance, it is highly recommend to wear a tucked-in post-war shirt and pants with a vest and fedora. If you can bring an umbrella and a mustache, too, that would be tres magnifique.

As we came in, there was nearly no noise level and the waiters were extremely nice as they even let us switch spot due to a little inconvenience.  We were really happy to find on the table real bread and real butter à volonté. As we ordered, we took a full course starting with the appetizer: my father took the Salade d'Endives which was very good. My sister took a Gratin de Pommes de terre et fenouille to die for. As for my mother and I, we shared the Moules marinières who weren't Marinières but more crème de Safran; not being disappointed though because the taste was new and as a different style. Next was the entrées. My father took a steak   Frites and was mostly satisfied with the meat but the frites were extremely salted. My sister took a Croque Monsieur which totally dissatisfied her because the bread was not grilled as it needed due to it being stuffed and puffed with the Cheese or the Béchamel they put in. My mother took a Quiche du Jour which was quite nice except it was enormous- frankly I have never seeing anything like that- and the crust was overcooked. As for myself, I took the Tagine de Légumes which greatly satisfied me. The taste was smooth and well put together an the plate was not as big as my family's. The entrees being big made us a bit disappointed because it doesn't show the true French cuisine. By that time more people arrived making the noise level higher and in between supportable and headache maker. But what happened is that the waiters were overflowing with work making them have little time for each table they serve. Lastly, the desserts which were the Baies à la Mascarpone and the Gâteau au Beurre d'Amandes. We were very glad we took them and let our bellies pop out!

The place didn't look particularly busy but who knows what the servers actual situation was, but some acknowledgement of that is always nice because then I'm not assuming the worst. He was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and took our order right away. Never saw him again until we almost finished our meals. Typically if my meal comes out correctly or I don't need anything I don't really mind but my burger was cooked medium well instead of medium rare and I would've loved some Dijon. I don't blame the server for burger being overcooked, I do fault him for not checking on our meals to make sure they were correct. Overall it was a nice place and I live right there so I'll give it another shot and hopefully the service aspect was a fluke.",0.9894,0.759,0.223,0.018,0.5593149540517962

In addition to my ginormous plate of fries, I will usually also enjoy the rainbow trout with spinach and cherry tomatoes or the poulet grand-mere.  Those two are my favorite. Both are wonderful dishes.  I am a creature of habit so I tend to always get one of those two dishes.  I rarely deviate, and when I do, I tend to regret doing so.   The service is always wonderful.  The staff is incredibly attentive, not pushy. The atmosphere of the restaurant is charming and sweet (very much in line with being a french bistro), but it is also very comfortable and relaxing.  I never feel rushed, and that's important.   The last thing I want when I've had a stressful week at work is to feel like I'm being rushed at dinner on a Friday night.   On top of that, I've rarely ever had to wait for a table.  There's usually always a small table or seat at the bar to munch at.  For someone who rarely has the foresight to make a reservation, I know I can walk in here on a Friday or Saturday night, and not have a problem.  Bistro Zinc = comfort, easy, tasty.",0.9899,0.764,0.199,0.037,0.6869230769230767

We were seated immediately and brought our menus. The selection is nothing spectacular but had some unique things- the croque monsieur and a lamb sandwich as breakfast dishes which my girlfriend and I both shared. The croque monsieur was a fluffy french toast hamd and cheese sandwich. Very savory and the cheese used was quite sharp- tasty dish.  My lamb sandwich included thinly sliced lamb piled on and had a good charred favor. It was definitely different and I appreciated the smokiness although I don't think I would ever get it again. What was disappointing was that it came with chips instead of french fries! Luckily my girlfriend was nice enough to share hers with me (they came with croque monsieur). My friends at the table got a mushroom crepe, a quiche, and french toast. All seemed very pleased with the meal. Afterwards we split a banana nutella crepe which was divine!

My party of four tried many different dishes, including the escargot, a first for all of us, and we were delighted for the experience and surprised by the light taste.  Another first for everyone, pate - it was quite good, too.  I am a super fan of French Onion soup and am always trying to find the best of the best.  Bistrot's was pretty fabulous, with gruyére cheese coated in every delicious bite.  I had the Croque Monsieur for my entree and was impressed with the taste of this simple grilled ham and cheese sandwich, it must be the gruyére cheese.  One of my counterparts had the La Crêpe au Poulet, she was impressed at the size, expecting only a 'regular sized' crêpe, not one the size of your head.  We were all so full from our dinner and lunch earlier in the day that we opted to skip desert, but I can't wait to go back to give a couple a try. We all had drinks too, but heck if I can remember what they were now.  All I can say is they were good, however one was so strong it was difficult to finish.  Our water glasses were always full though, so we just followed a swig of martini with some water and we made it work.

Just want to stop and say I ate Pate here bc of that line in Ace Ventura...you know the one...and I now think as a whole it's gross. Can't fault Bistrot for that, but it's something to know.

Too much puff pastry and mashed potatoes overwhelmed the stew. Almost perfect!  Braised beef short ribs (6/10): Sauce was too salty and the short ribs weren't fall apart yet.

Since I wasn't feeling too adventurous on the day we dined here, i chose the Vol-au-vent: yelp.com/biz_photos/bist… which was filled with a great chicken stew. it was a like a french chicken pot pie - great chicken and carrots served in a flaky puff pastry over mashed potatoes. it hit the spot (though it's a lot of carbs!). then i had dessert - split a Gateau au Chocolat with the wife. yum!

The windows along the street were open, they had fresh flowers on the tables, and I almost felt like I was back in France.  While my sister waxed poetic about the french toast, I couldn't deny the Croque Monsieur. I've had a hard time finding a decent version of the sandwich in Atlanta so I couldn't pass up the opportunity to get my hands on a good one. I don't regret my decision in the least. The sandwich was the right amount of creamy and crunchy, fatty without being greasy, and as decadent and flavorful as I could hope. The skinny fries were equally addictive.  Our server couldn't have been nicer and everyone in my crew seemed delighted with their dishes. Chicago has so many delicious eateries it will be hard to pick what to hit up on my next visit, but Bistrot Zinc will likely be on my short list.",0.9317,0.843,0.127,0.03,0.5674908424908426

2013-06-13,3.0,"Traditional French Bistro (in Chicago no less). Had lunch there on a nice late spring day. The restaurant has a large shuttered front, which, when open, makes dining near the front almost like dining on a patio. It's actually nicer as the climate is more controlled than a patio. The tables are a little close together, but that too is an authentic touch (it would be nice if rich people had more interesting things to talk about). I began with a bottle of sparkling water and the duck liver paté. The paté was smooth and creamy and was served with a mustard, some very crispy rounds, and some cornichons. I wasn't entirely convinced by the paté and I would have liked to have been told if it was made on premises, and, for that matter, if the cornichons were made on premises. That I had some doubt was to me an issue. The waitress did help me to chose another dish and that was helpful. I had salmon crepes, but the smoked salmon was served much too cold. I believe that the crepe was whole wheat, which is something I do not care for in a crepe, but I can see how some people do. It was accompanied by a coarse julienne of radish, capers, and some crème fraîche. The radishes were underpowered, which is odd since they could, conceivably, have been local short season radishes. A spicy note would have been welcome in the dish. I finished the meal with an almond cake and some coffee. The coffee was excellent and the almond cake was warm from the oven. It was served with whipping creme and some sliced mixed berries (unless I am very much mistaken, the menu promised me macerated berries and did not deliver). The berries were intensely weak. The strawberries only barely ripe and the blue berries a little past their prime. I did not eat more than a few before realizing that they were slightly musty. The restaurant was not tremendously busy, but the service was both slow and inattentive (though quite pleasant). I was annoyed enough by it to lower my usual 20% gratuity to 15%. I think the issue of slow service has come up in other reviews, so perhaps some work could be done on this area. The prices were reasonable for such a ritzy neighborhood. In the end, Bistrot Zinc is a quite valid little bistro, and its pleasant, unpretentious ambiance makes for a relaxed lunch.",0.9786,0.81,0.124,0.065,0.48944885361552043
2013-06-09,4.0,"Restaurant Review French Bistro in the Gold Coast! I came here for my three year wedding anniversary for lunch with my wife and son. I was not disappointed. You would think having a 8 month old with you would be a problem in a french bistro, but no. The staff was super friendly and placed us at a table where we could easily fit the stroller. The menu prices for this area were quite good. We started off with the house pate, a bit gamey for my taste but ample portions for the price you pay. I wish they would give you more bread with the pate. I ended up with a lighter meal by selecting the Gigot d'Agneau (Sliced leg of lamb, grilled onion, watercress, rosemary aioli) As other's commented the onion was way too much and had to be removed from the sandwich, but otw the lamb was cooked well and the seasoning went well with the protein. I can't say it was the best sandwich I ever had, but I will be back to try the other french bistro items. 4 stars as being a promising restaurant that I will have to come back and try more items.

Absolutely nothing to rave about. The veggie crepe tasted exactly like that - the veggies were covered in cooking oil, no garlic or additional flavors (the menu says they add basil, but I couldn't taste it), and a little dollop of goat cheese.

The escargots were delicious and I would definitely order them again. I was a little surprised by the portions, they were large for French food. The brûlée was outstanding, if I had to nit pick, I would say that the top was too thick but the texture of the cream and the taste was perfect.

Practically a souffle it was so light and custardy.  I had the onion soup and the tuna salad, both terrific. The soup: I never order french onion soup; it usually gives me a headache it's so oniony. Glad I did today - this was sweet and rich, the onions totally caramelized. And LOADED with melted gruyere (I omitted the bread as I don't eat wheat). Almost a fondue. Yummy and a surprisingly rich, filling first course.  Then Salade de Thon: barely seared slices of delicate tuna over a little fennel salad with wedges of roasted artichokes, with an amazing coulis of green onion on the side. And a nice kalamata olive tapenade on toast.  Just delightful, and original too.  The service was prompt, attentive, friendly.

There were some aspects of my dining experience at Bistrot Zinc that were absolutely phenomenal (our server was really top notch) and other things that we frowned at (the mussels). A lot of the evening was just okay. Duck Confit - It was a really tasty combination of duck, greens, bacon, and raisins. Potato Soup with Haricots Verts - A nice blend of potatoes with an earthy garlic flavor. Chev Salad - Hit the spot: crumbled goat cheese with pickled (?) pears. Mussels - Low quality and over cooked. Fries - I could make better at home. These were plain as plain can be. Chocolate Mousse - M didn't comment about it, didn't finish it, but chose to take most of it home to sit in the fridge untouched. Almond Cake - surprisingly well balanced. I don't usually like cake that much but thought that this one had good almond flavor, nice texture, and wasn't too sweet. With drinks, our bill came to $120.

Had a glass of champagne and half a turkey sandwich with french onion soup and homemade chips. The soup had way too much cheese in it, but really... is that so bad? It tasted really good.  The turkey sandwich was good too - it had some fig jam on it or something.  Cheap lunch.  Staff wasn't the best or anything.

2012-11-01,1.0,"Lousy experience here. Food was good but we made the mistake of sitting at the bar  and for whatever reason, the bartender - Lisa - a woman with very short brown hair, decided that she hated us but loved everyone else who we assumed must be regulars.  The people sitting next to us said, ""Oh Lisa is a mixologist, ask her to make you something special!"", so when we asked for her suggestion on a drink using tequila and orange she said, ""Ugh, I don't know, I hate tequila so I don't make those drinks"". Umm, okay. The mood was chilly throughout and finally just turned cold to the point where we knew we were not welcome.  It's a shame because the food was good and we all like French cuisine but no food is worth feeling like you're an unwelcome sack if merde. I actually called the restaurant because we wanted to go back and try it again this weekend so I asked if she was working - when I realized I was talking to a manager (he identified himself as a co-owner) I told him I was asking if Lisa was working because she was so rude to us and we didn't want to come back if she would be there.  He said, ""yes, she's working on Friday"", to which I replied, ""Well I guess we won't come in because she was very clear that she hated us"" and he said, ""OK""... Well screw you dude. I'll take my cash elsewhere! Businesses aren't run the way they used to be and a place like that shouldn't be proud of a mean bartender.

We were lucky enough to find parking right away, which we realized on our way there may be an ordeal considering the location of the restaurant (poor planning on our part and just dumb luck). The restaurant is cute, standard french style cafe (similar to those in Paris, but way bigger and more spacious). It was a gorgeous day so we had sat by the windows which were open. Apparently this was also the couple zone as every table was occupied by a couple (except for the ladies next to us).  For our meal, we had the following: French onion soup - Definitely cheesy, very sweet onion flavor. However a bit salty to my taste, and was served warm (almost room temp), as opposed to piping hot. I am a fan of piping hot soup, so was not loving this...but my husband, who prefers lukewarm food, loved it. Lamb sandwich - Simple lamb flavor, highlighted by onions and the creamy spread. Perfect for those lamb purists. I loved the waffle chips that came with the sandwich, which I devoured not very stealthily from my husband's plate. Pan-fried trout - This was perfectly cooked in butter. It even turned my husband around, who up to that point did not see trout as a viable food option. However, I thought the fish was lacking a bit of salt, which was easily remedied (as I was seasoning my eggs). The one low point of the dish were the potatoes, which I think were supposed to be roasted, but I couldn't tell as they were drowning in olive oil/butter? I love potatoes, I love butter...but even I couldn't really enjoy the soggy potatoes.  Overall, superb experience in dining. The food came out extremely quickly, which was much appreciated as I was starving. Will definitely go back to check out the crepes.",0.9958,0.751,0.198,0.051,0.5385775335775337

I got to admit, I like French food but I don't love it. I figured I should at least give it a try. Bistro food is very predictable. There's escargot, steak frites, ratatouile, poulet roti, quiche, you get the gist. It's really how well they prepared it. My trout meuniere was cooked quite well. In fact, it was my first fish a la meuniere and enjoyed it that I tried making it at home the next evening.  Overall, it was a good dinner in a very French setting but nothing spectacular. The decor did remind me of Paris though. Definitely a place to check out if you're in the neighbourhood.",0.9577,0.797,0.172,0.031,0.3488095238095238

We were seated right on time for our 7:30 reservation which was I wasnt expecting since it's such a busy night.  They had specials for valentines day but didnt force you to do a prix fixe menu which I really appreciated.  I want to make my own choices, especially the first time at a restaurant. We shared the escargot to start, baked in garlic herb butter, it wasnt chewy at all, cooked perfectly.  And they brought plenty of french bread to dip in the extra herb butter. My bf had the duck that was on special, it was tender and flavorful.  I had the steak frites.  Cooked medium rare as i requested and the frites were crisp.  The only downfall, there was a piece of plastic wrap on top of the herb butter on my steak.  The waiter offered to bring me a new steak, but by that time my boyfriend had almost finished his duck and i wasnt going to have him sit there while they cooked another steak. they brought us a complementary cup of chocolate mouse for dessert.  It wasnt incredibly flavorful, but it was free so i cant complain. I love french food, and bistro zinc definitely hit the spot.  Nothing had an especially unique flavor profile, but I ordered escargot and steak frites, so I was happy that the classics came out tasting the way i was expecting them to.  We were looking for a charming french bistro and thats exactly what bistro zinc is, nothing too fancy.  I give them 4 stars, even with the plastic wrap incident, so obviously i really enjoyed my experience and meal overall.",0.9944,0.819,0.167,0.015,0.5559902597402596

I started off with the Twice-Baked Goat Cheese Soufflé with Sun Dried Tomato Tapenade. The souffle was delicious, but the sun dried tomato was a little too tart. I got to try the french onion soup too, but it seemed too wine-y tasting for my liking and didn't have enough onions.  For the entree I was really looking forward to the grilled salmon but they were completely out. Instead I tried the Coq au Vin with Buttered Egg Noodles and fell in love! There were 2 giant chicken breasts that had been marinated in red wine over a bed of shallots, bacon and pasta. It was absolutely delicious. I let my mom try my leftovers the next day and she loved it as well.  For desert I had the Chocolate Mousse. It was so overly rich I was wishing I had some milk. I recommend the Coffee Pot de Crème instead. That was way more delicious, creamy and just the right amount of sweetness.

The inside is quaint and the menu offered a reasonable bistro fare. Something must've gone wrong in the kitchen. Who said that salt and excessive spice are substitutes for subtle flavor? And, contrary to a common misconception, vast quantities of butter alone can't rescue a mediocre dish. Yet these are the tricks on which the chef seems to rely. How about a French Onion Soup that neither contains any onion nor is a soup? I love cheese as much as anyone, but a clay pot full of molten tasteless cheese-like substance does not make me a happy diner. And if you want to offer a tagine, please get the flavors right!

The mosaic floor is a disaster. Totally off putting both in color and design. Looks like somebody puked up a pepperoni pizza. Service was good. No complaints. As to the food. One word comes to mind... Salt. Or, more accurately, the lack thereof. Actually, seasoning in general was lacking. A few slices of bread were delivered. Pretty uninteresting stuff. Not much flavor. Good crust, but totally forgettable. The butter was warm and thus, way too soft. I ordered the frisée lyonnaise salad. Needed lots of salt and pepper. If the salad was dressed with anything besides the poached egg sitting thereupon, I couldn't detect it.  It came with many croutons despite the menu making no mention of their inclusion in the dish. The entree of trout had 1 thing going for it-- abundance. It was a huge specimen, served over sautéed spinach. The trout, like the salad needed a heavy dose of salt and pepper. Once uncovered, the spinach, too, needed help from the shakers. That which was most bizarre and actually, to a fair degree, shocking, was that the tomato vinaigrette  (halved grape tomatoes in a vinaigrette)) was served atop the steaming hot trout and was in fact refrigerator cold. Were they trying to go for some temperature based juxtaposition? This was supposed to be traditional French bistrot, so I think not. The result wasn't especially pleasant. A mouthful of hot fish with very cold tomatoes wasn't what I had in mind. Dinner consisted of a glass of wine, the salad and the fish. With tax and tip the total was just about $50. As I'm in Chicago infrequently, I don't imagine revisiting this establishment.",0.9058,0.833,0.102,0.065,0.60546875

Now, on to Bistrot Zinc.  This quaint little French spot wasn't a premeditated dinner, an elaborate date, or a scheme to impress any old girl.  It was simply a random choice for a late dinner after a night out at First Fridays at the Museum of Contemporary Art.  We needed food at a good price and BZ was highly rated. So we sat down around 9:30/10 to a relatively empty place with friendly service and class.  I ordered a Chardonnay, and Tarra T. kept to the water (she was already feeling a good buzz). The meals: she had the burger, which was very flavorful and on a Hawaiian bun (if I recall correctly).  The main drawback: it was heavy on the bleu cheese, which was pretty overpowering. I had the beef short ribs (I mother effin LOVE a short rib!).  They were flanked with mashed potatoes and carrots, rightly sized, not too filling but left me very satisfied.

(Escargot BZ: French snails, herb garlic butter, Pernod, pesto crumbs).   The Escargot was fantastic and served in very French style!  I would definitely go back and see what else this restaurant has to offer.   Good for a meeting, 3rd date or later and to catch up with a girlfriend.",0.969,0.799,0.187,0.014,0.31153846153846154

Normally I don't care about ambiance, but I have to point this out as I'm used to the stuffy feel when dining at French cafes (note Froggy's in highland, it was rank). Coffee was great too. I joked that it reminded me of Vegas' Paris shoppes, but I kind of meant it. And I appreciated that nostalgia. We came here for brunch upon a friend's request as it has the ""best quiche"" he's ever had. Brunch menu was short and sweet. My fiance got the quiche of the day (mushroom and leeks) and I got the smoked salmon benedict.  The benedict was perfect. Eggs poached perfectly, plenty of smoked salmon, and a muffin that you can actually cut through without breaking out the chainsaw. It was hard having to switch plates with my fiance when we both made it halfway through our dishes. But, alas, we did. My fiance's quiche. He lied. He ate more than half! But I understood why. It was incredibly fluffy and rich and the ingredients each stood out on their own. It definitely is up there in quiches I have tasted.

Fathers day was particularly poignant for me , for a number of reasons that I shall not dwell upon in this review. So I wanted to honor my Pop, who is far away from here, by doing it up right with Auntie Fab - a true Francophile and a recent returnee from an extended trip to Paris.  I loved the restaurant's ambiance - while others have dismissed it as ""cheesy"" , I have been to Paris a number of times and found the restaurant both authentic and charming.  Is there anything better when one is dressed for a fancy brunch and ones hair is behaving, to be seated by an open window between two tables of handsome men? To be quickly attended to with water and menus, to be promptly given delicious coffee and cold rose wine (which we asked for errr - let me not mislead you with a false magnanimous gesture)  The menu was very french and I dithered mightily before deciding on the pan fried trout with scrambled eggs and potatoes. The trout was cooked so beautifully it almost made me weep with gratitude, the eggs fluffy and golden yellow ( real eggs! REAL EGGS! That even tasted like ....EGGS) Auntie Fab had the Chicken Crepes - also delish.  Never rushed we ambled through our Brunch chatting and toasted Fathers far and near, alternating between people watching and chatting - the restaurant was PACKED. yet our service remained attentive and professional. We wound up our meals with desert, I had a chocolate cake that I had to take away from myself before inhaling the plate accidentally. SO GOOD!!!!

2011-05-27,2.0,"I'd really like to understand what the heck happened here.  Let me preface this review update by saying that I am an educated, cultured, and successful professional who has worked many years in the service industry while in university and grad school.  So I am always a great customer, smiling and easy, and very low maintenance.   I'm also a very good tipper.  And before you start scoffing, let me just say that prior to cabbing it to Bistrot Zinc, my friends and I kicked off our Friday-before-Memorial Day at a River North bar that featured drink and appetizer specials.  The bill came to $46 and I left a $40 tip to ensure the very attentive and friendly bartender did not lose out because of the special prices. My two friends and I arrive at Bistrot Zinc around 7ish pm and were promptly seated.  Our server shows up, tall with a shaved head, and at first is friendly and engaging.  I immediately say, ""We would like a bottle of champagne.""  Translation: ""We are celebrating.  We are spending money.  You will get a good tip."" The server gives us a nice run down of their selections and offers to bring us a sample of one of them, which we find perfectly fine.  So we order a bottle.   A few minutes later the server shows up, opens the bottle, and pours each of us our first glass. We place an order for escargot to get started.   Then.......................nothing. No follow up.  No offer to make a second pour.  No appetizer.  We had to flag a bus boy to inquire about our escargot.  The server comes over and makes some lame excuse like we were so engaged in banter about the champagne that he forgot to put the order in.  He then looks like he's about to walk away and we tell him we would like to order entrees.   He takes our orders and I say audibly ""What's left in the bottle?"" Translation: ""You didn't bother to check on us, and we have emptied the bottle by pouring it ourselves, but shockers, we are still interested in ordering another one.""   Nothing....no acknowledgement, no follow up, the server just walks away.  One of my friends is then so fed up he walks to the front and asks for the manager.  The manager comes over, we voice our concerns, and then ask for another server to finish out the evening.  He complied nicely and the replacement server (and his trainee) were a dream, thankfully salvaging what would have otherwise been a disappointing evening.  We also had our three desserts gratis. So my question to the original server is what the heck did we do to put you off?  I'd really like to know.  And by the way, I'm an Asian guy with a shaved head.  I was wearing a navy and white checked shirt.  The friend to my right was a lovely Asian woman wearing glasses, and my other friend was seated facing her.  He's Caucasian, salt and pepper hair, and glasses.   I want you to know exactly who we are.  And I hope to goodness that the lovely replacement server and trainee collected our tip.  Because you don't serve a penny of it.   I ask again, what did we do to put you off? The two stars are only because the situation was somewhat rectified with the exceptional replacement server.   I have loved Bistrot Zinc for many years,  but frankly Chicago has many options now, and I won't be back.",0.9978,0.792,0.177,0.031,0.4540645052347181
2011-05-11,4.0,"A quiet French restaurant seemed like the perfect place to escape the Gold Coast frenzy during Cinco De Mayo and that's how I wound up at Bistrot Zinc. Initially, we were just looking for a place to have dessert, but upon seeing the menu we just had to order more food.  I ordered the Onion soup which was divine. I often find when I order French Onion soup its either too salty and straight from the Campbell's can and drowned in cheese to cover the taste, but that was not the case here. The soup was a perfect balance of saltiness and a hint of sweetness from what I assumed was sweet onions. The gruyere cheese baked on top didn't overpower the soup and it was just all around lovely. I also  sampled a few of their mussels steamed with white wine. I love mussels and these were great!  When it was finally time to order dessert, the reason for going to Bistro Zinc, I ordered the almond butter cake with macerated berries. I almost started this review by raving about how amazing the cake was. The berries were a nice touch and all, but the cake itself, I almost have no words!

Now, the inner Camus in me is struggling between three and four stars for a variety of reasons. I think another visit might clear that up, but with so many great bistros to choose from, dare I come back? Ah, the never-ending struggle yet again. So let's just get down to the Bons and Mals. Bon: -Atmosphere: by far the best part about the place. From the second you step up to the front door, you feel like you're entering a comfortable old bistro next to the river Seine. Inside it only gets better, with dim lighting, classic Parisian art and design, tucked away booths and spartan tables. You just feel like you're back in Paris. Loved it. -Bar/Wine: I like how the wine list was non-pretentious. Just good pours (many by the glass) of tasty, yet affordable French wines. The bar itself is obviously the centerpiece of the restaurant, as it's a classic Zinc topped bar (Bistrot Zinc, get it?). Bartender was polite and friendly and I thought the little tree of hardboiled eggs at the bar gave it an eggs-ceptionally authentic feel (that pun can go in the 'mal' category). Mal:  -Price: Now, everything is relative, so don't get me wrong here. I don't think the prices are outrageous - especially for French dining - but they are a tad pricey for what you get. Bistro food is supposed to be simple, tasty and (again, relatively) cheap. It's what the French eat when they don't want to make a extravaganza of a meal. What you quickly realize is that you're paying a premium for the ambiance and the Old Town location, so I get that. I just wish it was a little more out of the way and a couple bucks cheaper for what you get... Comme si, comme ca: -The food: Again, think RELATIVE here. I think overall, the food is exactly what I was expecting: savory, quality bistro grub that warms the soul but doesn't have to be a show stopper. The estargot was excellent, huge snails and piping hot. I had the classic steak frites - steak was very thin, but cooked well, frites could have been a little more flavorful. My friend had the stew of the day, which was a beer and beef stew, which was very tasty. Finished with a chocolate mousse that was a nice light touch to the end of a meal. So why just so-so? Again, it was just tasty, standard bistro fare for a slightly inflated price.  Overall, Bistrot Zinc certainly tickled my francophile taste buds and is a great place for a leisurely, classic French meal, but just be forewarned that you're mostly paying for the location.",0.9977,0.815,0.165,0.02,0.42845175107079875
2011-02-28,4.0,"Few regrets... I have few in life -- but admittedly, passing Bistro Zinc up as much as I have over the years until today's lunch certainly counts as one.  We love to lunch as early as possible in order to beat the crowds and arrived a few minutes before the scheduled 11:30am opening. Our server was cheery, generous and patient as we had a hard time picking from many of the tantalizing apps and entrees.  We settled on escargot and french onion soup to start and my friend chose the salmon gruyère quiche and me, the pan fried trout over a bed of cooked spinach capers and cherry tomatoes as the entree.   We rocked the chunky escargot and sopped up all its buttery juices and soup with fresh bread.  The quiche was mouthgasmic with it's buttery middles and heads-of-state worthy crust.  The pan fried trout tasted just-caught and perfect over a steamed spinach bed with capers and tomatoes.  It beamed, white, yet slightly buttery and crispy. We had tears in our eyes and were in need of this culinary fix on a dark, bleak, icy Chicago Monday morning.  Just as we approached Bistro Zinc, the sun came out and all was well in our world. We debated over dessert and after mulling a few different options chose chocolate mousse balls and also their almond butter cake with macerated berries.  Now I don't know what the hell macerated really means exactly but these berries were very rich tasting... almost marinated in a rich watermelon juice as my friend noted, wonderfully.  The cake was reminiscent of my elders cooking old-fashioned tea cakes and was most wonderful and complex.--hot out of the oven. It was a struggle to keep my shoes on and remain seated in my chair in a civil fashion. I was definitely having a moment! The exact blend is a ""state secret"" but they brought to the table a fresh pot of Intelligensia decaf.  Panamanian and Guatemalan beans are in there and it was the best cup(s) of coffee I've had. If that wasn't the kicker, we left with a complimentary $25 gift certificate for dinner.  NEW. BIG. FANS. Waistlines be damned. :)",0.9976,0.756,0.205,0.039,0.4656977942692228

I think I was just a little uncomfortable at the table we were given, which started me off on the wrong foot.  Our table of four had the onion soup, pate and goat cheese for our starters. I think we all agreed that the goat cheese was the winner. The pate wasn't bad, but I'm not really a fan. The onion soup was a little heavy on the cheese, and I love cheese!  I can't speak for the other girls entrees. I was stuffed by that point and didn't share. I had the Steak frites. Other than the fact it was cooked medium well as opposed to medium it was delicious.  Desserts were all wonderful! I loved my almond cake. Wine list was nice and very reasonable as well. Service was nice. Completely honest though...I've had better service.

Also, we had reservations and yet got seated at the worst table in the whole restaurant.   We also felt so rushed it was rediculous.  When we are spending that much money for drinks and dinner on a holiday I don't want to be rushed.  I mean our food came out in literally three minutes.  Then the waiter kept walking by eyeing our plates to see if we were done.

My ratatouille crepe was divine and hit the spot (extra points for the goat cheese). Finally, I tried multiple desserts and they were all delightful!

2010-12-16,5.0,"I have to agree with Reed N. here - the negative reviews are a little unwarrantedly harsh.  Let me enumerate all the reasons why I love Bistro Zinc. For background information, my parents live right around the corner and this is one of their favorite neighborhood spots (in a neighborhood of easily accessible good food). They're here on average at least once every two weeks.  1. The service. The host, Michael, always greets us with a smile and seats us promptly, despite the fact that we never have a reservation. He's totally sweet and attentive, and most of the servers are pretty damn good as well. They space out a little on occasion, but Nothing major, and the bus boys are always quick about serving and clearing.  2. The ambiance. Cute and cozy. Dark enough to talk intimately, quiet enough to not have to shout to be heard. And the tables are actually not on top of each other, a real luxury these days.  3. The food. Believe me when I say I've never had a bad meal here, and I really find just about everything on the menu appealing. On my most recent visit, we tried... - Bread and butter. I know, I know, every French place and almost every dinner restaurant serves bread and butter. But the butter here is particularly good.  - Green salad. Just simply dressed butter lettuce. Crisp and refreshing and light.  - Salade au chevre. A goat cheese salad served with red onions and pears on a bed of mixed greens. A little too big for me, but super yummy. Great balance of flavors and even though the dressing looked a little much for me, it was just perfect.  - The Mussels. A big steaming bowl of large, tender mussels in a garlic sauce. Expertly prepared and oh so delicious.  - Butternut squash risotto with fried sage leaves. First of all, I love risotto. Second of all, I love butternut squash. What could have been better? The small chunks of squash in the risotto and the slight crunch of the fried sage leaves were nice touches.  - Steak au poivre. Deliciously covered in pepper and cooked just to the medium rare side of rare. Yummy yummy.  - Roasted vegetables. A little known secret - these potatoes, carrots, parsnips etc are actully cooked in duck fat, so don't pride yourself on being virtuous by ordering these. So good though. Totally worth it.  - Profiteroles. What more can be said? Three perfect little pastries filled with ice cream and covered with chocolate sauce. Who could resist? - Almond butter cake with macerated berries. The perfect finisher to a night of good food. Warm, luscious almond butter cake served with whipped cream and the requisite berries, a delightful mouthful in every bite.  Yes, we did eat way more than three people should have, but it was all so good and worth every bite. I would recommend ordering any/all of the items we tried.",0.9992,0.729,0.252,0.019,0.5380349608197712

Comments about what patrons think... like they read minds or something. Complaints about portion size... not true. Complaints about prices... not true. Complaints about vinegar, but not asking the server to fix it... not fair. Complaints about a server not taking a picture. Uh... SERVER, not photographer. They have other work to do sparky. So let me give you a REAL review. I have been to France 7 times. Yes. Seven. For a total of about 70 days. I know French food quite well. So... We were seated at a gloriously fortunate table all the way against the back wall away from the noise of the center of the place. It was a busy Saturday night. Our server was an enthusiastic gentlemen who was honestly working his ass off. He helped us narrow our choice of food down to: Burger with blue cheese and fries. The frite were brown to perfection and the burger was a lean patty cooked to medium rare state... but still warm throughout and not bloody. Just as tender and delicious as you will find. Not a huge patty, but just fine. My girl and I do not do buns, so no comment there. Cassoulet was a looser than a traditional version... a little more liquid is what I mean. Served on a plate in a large portion. Traditional servings are a bit smaller in a crock with breadcrumbs on top. The beans and sauce were slightly smoky and were excellent. The duck quarter was excellent as well. The sausage was odd, but still positive and flavorful meat. Call it uniquely spiced. The lamb... good GOD the lamb. I have eaten dozens of pounds of lamb. The lamb chunks were the absolute best lamb I have ever eaten in my 43 years... Ever. Tender. Flavorful. Just perfect.  The side item was brussel sprouts with bacon and prunes. The french use prunes [pruneau] to offset earthy dishs like potatoes and, well brussel sprouts... and with with proteins like pork and chicken. The sweetness is just wonderful with these items. Anyway, the salty bacon, sweet prunes and earthy sprouts combine to create a trio of fun on your pallet.  Really, for a bistro, we received more than we expected in flavor and value.

I decided to sit at the bar, and Jon was very attentive, filling my water up at least 20 times because those glasses are so ridiculously small. What started out as just ordering the spinach and brie crepe (good, but too thin of a consistency for me) turned into a ""I'm going to treat myself to whatever I want.""

I lived in France for years and grew up on basic French food and this place is pretty much perfect for me.  I believe in all my times there, I've only had the steak and frites and glasses of red or white wine. Here is why - it is very difficult to find a good steak frites in this town. And by that I mean, the actual specific dish, not just a steak with a side of french fries. The steak needs to be thin, little fat, topped with a little of that fabulous butter mix or other sauce if you prefer, and the fries need to thin and rich and crispy and addictive, but the steak is so good that you keep alternating back and forth and add in a little red wine from time to time. That, to me at least, is the dish. And they do it quite well.  I also like the atmosphere - I think they do an excellent job with a cafe setting.

When she suggested we meet up for dinner, I had no idea where to go because honestly I haven't had the opportunity to explore much around that neighborhood. She had noticed Bistrot Zinc while walking around in the Gold Coast, so we decided to go on a Wednesday evening. It turned out to be a great decision, we had an excellent restaurant experience. Decor is lovely, beautiful tile floor and big traditional lithographs for aperitifs, funky little photographs, and a handful of paintings. The large open space is tastefully lit with overheads and candles on the tables.  The menu is traditional bistro- steak frites and au poivre, roast chicken, liver and onions, some crepes, sandwiches, etc.. A modest wine list that was perfectly in character. We started with a salad, simple with boston lettuce and a vinaigrette, and a bottle of Chablis. Our server was named Hunter, who did a good job of suggesting the wine, even bringing us a taste before we decided on the bottle as the wine he suggested was on of their glass pours.  We then ordered pan fried trout and the mussels, which were served perfectly for us to split. The food was great, the trout in a cherry tomato and caper relish and the mussels in white wine and cream sauce. Well balanced dishes, with the emphasis on the fish itself. Overall, the service was very good, the pace of the meal was perfect, and the rich tradition of bistro dining upheld very much to our satisfaction.",0.9937,0.804,0.176,0.02,0.6085281385281385

They were not crispy at all but instead kind of chewy like it was taken out of the fryer too soon. Needless to say nobody at my table ate more than 1 ""chip."" - Service was at a bare minimum.

2010-06-01,4.0,"Hard not to have a good time when you're out with a great group of friends which is exactly what I was doing this afternoon when I visited Bistrot Zinc. A quaint little French spot tucked in Chicago's Gold Coast that refreshingly has it own personality and is perfect for an afternoon get-together with friends or family. This is not to say they don't serve dinner which they do; actually they have breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus. I know they serve breakfast throughout the day but I'm not sure about dinner. I should have asked since now looking at the evening menu it looks wonderful and I would have loved to have tried a few of the dinner items. In any event, its simple bistro atmosphere which is inviting and nice to me has the feeling of being a brunch or afternoon place to hang out rather than your evening main event. That said if you're just looking for a nice causal place to get together with people you know, this might be a good choice any time depending on your mood.  Food-wise, I loved the diverse menu and the items I tried were definitely above average but not absolutely amazingly so though the sliced leg of lamb sandwich was pretty darn close. Other items I tried were the Croque Monsieur, Eggs Benedict, and Mussels. I only sampled the Mussels so hard to say how wonderful this dish really was but the one mussel I did have was excellent. The Croque Monsieur was also very good though I found myself thinking this one could have been better and the Eggs Benedict despite how the staff raved wasn't any better than what I'm accustomed to which is not a bad thing just that it didn't blow my mind.  Not all was bon however, the pomme frites tasted just a touch burnt and I found the staff to be a bit in-personal and mechanical. That said, it either wasn't that bad or just having a good relaxing time overshadowed these issues so it didn't detract much from the overall experience.

Bistrot Zinc is really spot on decor-wise...the atmosphere is quite authentic and highly reminiscent of some of the Parisian brasseries I visited in my time - minus the noise and crowd.

I had forgotten that the tuna was 'marinated' in what I can only suppose to be herbs. Weird. Other deception: it wasn't big chunks of tuna. Just....tuna. Green tuna. Potatoes were very scarce: 3 little bites. I had much better salade nicoise, even in Wisconsin. No lie.

I realize that messing up a salad is hard, but the dressing was fantastic and clearly homemade.  My friend on the other hand ordered the steak (which was a mistake). She had asked the waiter if their Medium Rare was true to temperature and he said it was so she decided to order Medium. Needless to say, the steak came out Medium Well and it was a let down.

Other standouts are the onion soup, (which is pretty much just an excuse to eat gobs of cheese), the steak frites, the coq au vin, and be sure to finish with the crêpe au chocolat. It's a chocoholic's wet dream. I'll still mourn the loss of the BZ on Southport, but I'll gladly brave the Viagra Triangle for BZ's très délicieux nourriture!",0.9933,0.689,0.269,0.042,0.4507716049382716
2009-11-28,5.0,"I came here today with a fellow yelper and friend for brunch. I ordered the potato leek soup (their special of the day) and half the gigot d'agneau (lamb) sandwich.  The bread and butter that they served us was delicious. The butter was soft and creamy. I don't like it when the butter is hard-to-spread, so today's butter was really, really good. Loved it. I also always enjoy a freshly squeezed cup of orange juice.  I always worry about ordering soup at non-Asian restaurants because I think westerners have a tendency to add milk to soups, and well I'm a bit lactose-intolerant. Our server told me that there's a little bit of cream but not much in the potato leek soup, and he was right. It was very delicious. I'm glad I ordered it as opposed to the french onion soup (my friend got that, and it looked really, really cheesy to me).  I've also never had a lamb sandwich before, which is why I ordered it. And to my surprise, it was really good too. The meat was tender and juicy. I really liked the watercress that was in the sandwich too. It was a good combination of ingredients. I was pleasantly surprised. The only thing that I didn't like was the potato chips that came with my order. It tasted a little overdone -- imagine almost burnt fries... I probably ate roughly two chips and decided that I didn't want the rest. And actually, I think it turned out well that I didn't like the chips because my friend and I were both very full after we finished our meal.

It was a lively Friday night and we walked around Loop and Gold Coast, starting Hubbard st all the way up to Goethe St up north, walking in blocks to find a new restaurant we haven't tried. We walked for 2.5 hours. We walked around Rush St. It was about 9pm and most restaurants were full besides Bistro Zinc. We decided not to try it, but after walking for another 30 min, we came back since there is no waiting line. The atmosphere was above average, but the food as absolutely horrible that I can't give it more than a 1 star.   I ordered Liver Pate (around $19) and my boyfriend ordered a quite expensive steak ($25), and it turned out that they looked like the same and tasted like the same. The steak was even smaller than my Pate. I am a Liver person, but this is not right.  As I was about to finish my tiny Live Pate dish, I GAGGED because It was so gross and salty and full of a smelly taste and blood dripping out. I could not finish the dish and my poor boyfriend finished it for me since his steak was tinier. The waiter told me the Cyder drink I order was $3.25 and it turned out to be a small bottle and it was $4.50.  We walked away, spending $30/pp, feeling that we just wasted so much money and time.

We started with a traditional charcuterie plate (delicious) and amazing goat cheese souffle with a sun-dried tomato tapenade. I am not a lover of goat cheese (unless it comes from the milk of the goats I stole from Krsna V.), but this was one of the best things I've tasted in a long time. It should be noted that the souffle is only on the dinner menu but lucky for us Dennis knew to order it. For my entree, I had the Poulet Grand-Mere, which was a leg and breast of chicken on the bone in a broth with mushrooms, potatoes, onions and tons of garlic. The bones did make it a bit difficult to eat but the chicken was well seasoned and tender and the accompanying vegetables were great! By the time dessert came around, 2 (maybe 3) bottles of wine had been consumed and we decided to pass our desserts around so that we could try them all. I ordered the Millas de Bordeaux (cherry & vanilla custard in a pastry with cream and caramel and dried cherries). I was also able to sample the Profiteroles (amazing), fresh berries with mascarpone (fresh and delicious) and the chocolate crepe (good but too much chocolate for this girl).   BZ is a very bright and open space and the bathrooms were perhaps the cleanest public restrooms I've ever seen. Our waiter, whom I chose to call Guillaume (totally not his name--I believe it was Nicholas) made good recommendations, was properly attentive and put up with our giving him a hard time and being generally full of wine on a Friday afternoon.

Even this close to closing time, we received very good service.  I had the carmelized onion tart for an app: oh so rich (almost too heavy). It was very good. My wife had the onion soup (as usual). It was not quite up to our standards. The cheese, crouton, and onions were very good, and the stock had a nice flavor to it but needed more body. Possible they were using a dark chicken stock instead of a beef or veal stock.  I had the foie de veau (I love organ meat). Ordered medium rare. The insides were good, but the outside was a little too seared (to the point of being charred). Pommes puree were good. My wife had a chicken and mushroom crepe.

2008-10-29,3.0,"Last Friday Kelly and I made our second trip to Bistrot Zinc, on what would seem to be an annual event.  Our first experience here was the summer of 2007, and it was a delightful time, with a warm, playful decor, filling charcuterie, succulent venison medallions, and a superb gigondas from the reserve list. . . .  Nostalgia, however, can be a cruel, cruel mistress. Which isn't to say the second time around was a total let down.  The decor, ambience, and service remain superb.  Bistrot Zinc has a classic layout, with wicker chair enveloped tables in the front, a gorgeous zinc bar in the center, and a cozy yet uncrowded back room with standard tables and banquettes, touched off with a multi-colored tiled floor, bright but not glaring yellow walls, and vintage prints, all of which take you out of the hustle and bustle of the Viagra Triangle waiting outside. We were not, however, rewarded in our food choices.  The French onion soup was disappointingly bland, and the escargot did not taste fresh, at all -- it reminded me of frozen escargot I purchased at Paulina Meat Market. Dinner was similarly disappointing.  I had the chicken grandmother style, while Kelly had the grilled poussin -- the baby chicken.  My chicken was tough, and while the dish had a wonderful smoky flavor from the bacon, I was surprised at how brothy it was -- the dish advertised rosemary garlic jus, but I expected a better balance with the Parisian potatoes, resulting in a ragout.  Instead I got a large soup.  Kelly's dish was similarly disappointing, but mostly from lack of flavor. In retrospect, I'm not sure exactly why I went with chicken -- I was probably recalling fond memories of the cornish hen at Kiki's Bistro, which is tender juicy and flavorful.  Next time, I will go more conventional bistro and get the lamb pork and duck cassoulet.  After all, when in doubt at a French restaurant, go with game. The dinner was not a total loss however, because our dessert -- the apple tart -- was superb.  Additionally, they have a fine, if albeit short, wine list with a very affordable negociant Chateauneuf du Pape.  So why do I give it three stars?  In large part because of my first trip, where the specials were more adventurous (i.e. venison), and because they had a few special reserve bottles, which were not that expensive as far as reserve bottles go.  I hope this is a reflection of the tough market restaurants are currently going through, and that when we return for the cassoulet, we are rewarded with our persistence. Regardless, if you are in the neighborhood and want a moment of European respite, you can do much worse than stopping in for at least an apertif and appetizer at the bar.",0.8107,0.805,0.106,0.089,0.5308627752176137

2008-08-16,4.0,"My wife and I were wandering around last night and made it up to the Gold Coast area looking for dinner.  After passing some extremely crowded restaurants from the looks of the outdoor seating, we came across Bistrot Zinc.  After looking at the menu outside, we were impressed and sat down (despite a worry of being under-dressed in T-shirts and jeans, but the hostess insisted they do take all comers).  It was after 9 pm by this point (which in my wimpy opinion begins to enter the late night range) and the place was rather crowded, though the numbers definitely dwindled as our meal went on (which is to be expected).   I thought the menu was rather diverse while not being overly extensive.  The wine list looked rather interesting to me and though I have been almost a teetotaler lately, I couldn't resist and grabbed a glass of a Gamay Beaujolais.  We started with an Octopus Salad and a French Onion soup.  I thought the soup was very good with a different cheese (gruyér) and a more interesting, flavorful broth than we were accustomed to; yes, we probably order this quite frequently and usually have some rather bad ones elsewhere.  I have never had an octopus salad before. It came out as a compact cylindrical hodgepodge on a bed of leaves and I enjoyed it though the roasted peppers kind of overwhelmed the whole dish.   For our entrees my wife had a chicken & mushroom crepe while I had the Stew du jour (beef on this night - and I would assume on a lot of others).  I have to admit that I am not overly familiar with crepes (or French cuisine in general), but I enjoyed the bite of it I had.  My wife thought the quality of the chicken was not the best and while I admit it might not have been breast meat, I thought it was fine.  I enjoyed my stew, but was not amazed by it.  It reminded me of my mother's (which I do enjoy, but she admittedly is not a professional chef) with nice chunks of meat, carrots, and tomatoes, but not a flavor I find memorable.  The pastry puff and mashed potatoes were good (especially when soaked with the ""gravy""), but did not have a distinctive taste (though I guess most people would claim they should not have a distinct taste).  The portions of both the stew and crepe were quite generous (at least after the appetizers) so we boxed about half of them to take home.   My wife was full and I was full, but I figure being at a French restaurant we had to try a dessert.  There were several interesting items on the menu, but a decision was made and I ordered the chocolate crepe.  This lead to a debate between my wife and I over whether a chocolate crepe is truly French (I say it is) or some Americanized creation (as my wife says), but I will let an expert and Google tell me later (I still say it is).  The crepe was served with a nice ball of vanilla ice cream on top plus smothered in a chocolate (fudge?) sauce - and let's just say none of that survived the trip home with us.   Overall, we really enjoyed the place and I imagine we will find our way back there eventually - at the minimum to get some appetizers and desserts.",0.9953,0.828,0.131,0.041,0.47928721174004196

2008-03-18,2.0,"This was one of the most disappointing dining experiences we have had during the eight months we have been back in Chicago.  We had really been looking forward to going to B. Zinc, for the reviews on Yelp are really strong and the atmosphere (from looking in the front window) appeared to be incredible.  Well, the atmosphere is amazing.  The food - well, the night we went it really wasn't very good.  The mediocre food combined with our expectations meant that we left disappointed. We started with a drink at the bar, and they had a nice selection of French wines by the glass.  That being said, you are much better off ordering a bottle of wine.  Their wine glasses are small. So, while the prices on their ""by the glass"" selections seem reasonable, they aren't all that reasonable when you consider the glass size.  The bar has a great feel to it though, and they place what appear to be homemade potato crisps on the bar for you to have as a snack. When we were seated we ordered a salad and an appetizer to share.  Given the cost of the salad ($9), we figured that it would be enough for us to share.  Wrong.  The $9 goat cheese salad is definitely a one person appetizer size salad.  It was our fault for not asking if it was a large or small salad, but $9 for an appetizer salad (given the price of the entrees) is really steep.  The salad was good, but not great.  I definitely would not order it again.  We also ordered the escargot.  The escargot are great; the bread that they serve with your meal is not.  The poor quality of the bread (for me) makes eating escargot much less of a treat.  I wouldn't order them again simply because the bread on the table is so bad.  (Of the ""bistros"" we have been to - Kiki's, Mon Ami Gabi, Brasserie Jo - Bistro Zinc's bread is by far the worst.)

2007-10-04,3.0,"Hate to be a downer, but everything except the food is great.  I went for my first time and ordered the steak frites (steak + fries) because it was pictured on their $25 coupon and because the word ""frites"" just tickles me.  Disappointingly, it tasted like yesterday's impromptu BBQ leftovers.  My dad cooks a much meaner steak than that.  Perhaps French people like their steaks thin and dry with just a pat of seasoned melted butter?  My friend ordered the salmon with mushrooms and turnip ""mashed potatoes,"" which wasn't appetizing either.  On the other hand, the appetizer mussels in a buttery broth were delish!  They were plump and clean.  Entrees range anywhere from $14-24 which is a fair price to pay for what you think would be stuffy food. On the upside, the atmosphere at Bistrot Zinc is just perfect for any intimate setting.  The lighting is dim, the window up front opens up to the sidewalkers on State Street, and the tile floors make you feel like you're in a hole-in-the-wall local diner in France.  The service here is also superb; we didn't have to ask for a single thing.  And best of all, they let a party of old friends stay till 11 PM without rushing us.",0.9946,0.745,0.224,0.032,0.5225056689342403

2007-08-14,5.0,"Oh, how I miss Bistrot Zinc! My husband and I spent a year living in Chicago, just a short walk down State Street from this cozy little Gold Coast gem, so named because of their handcrafted zinc bar. OK, I must confess, we went in the first time after getting one of their coupons in the mail. The place looked so charming, and it was just too good of a deal to pass up! But we fell in love with it on the first visit and kept going back.  Anniversaries, birthdays, date nights, Thursday afternoons...we were always finding reasons to go to Bistrot Zinc. We brunched, we lunched, we dined, we drank and we always felt like we were in our own little secret spot. Never touristy, Bistrot Zinc feels like a tucked-away neighborhood spot in an area that's overrun with trendy bars and expense-check restaurants.  My menu faves included:  the Brioche French Toast (with vanilla marscapone and fresh berries...yum!), Le Royale (a fantastic burger, which, while it's only on the lunch menu, you can get at dinner if you ask), the Tarts au Saumon Fume appetizer, the Vol au Vent stew (which changes daily), the Steak Frites, the Steak au Poivre and the Nutella crepes (hold the banana, please). Adding to the charm of Bistrot Zinc is an authentic French bistrot vibe and a great staff, including Wes, the day manager, a total sweetheart of a guy.  The next time we can make it back to Chicago, Bistrot Zinc will definitely be one of the first stops on our list. But for now, tell Wes we said hello.",0.9891,0.842,0.14,0.019,0.4789272030651341

I also absolutely love the people watching here!  You see everything, from fallen socialites (or at least that's the story the charming little old lady who sat next to me at the bar once told me), to flamingly obvious homosexual designers and the rich ladies who employ them, to the usual Gold Coast suspects walking buy the street outside.  The staff is usually very friendly as well, though it can occasionally take awhile to get your food, but never obnoxiously long.  If you don't have time to enjoy your meal, there is a Subway, Corner Bakery, and Chipolte near by to provide you with fast food.",0.9916,0.715,0.25,0.035,0.47840909090909095

Two words:  Tres Bon!  This place is absolutely wonderful.  Cozy, but not small or claustrophic, charmingly decorated and the service is the best I've had since moving to Chicago.   Case in point,  I made reservations for six (6) this past Friday.  We arrived (30 minutes late) and our reservation had been given to someone else -- that, plus they thought we were a part of two.  Thus, we had to wait a bit (no more than 15 minutes) for them to prepare a table.  Not an issue in my world, but apparently it was in theirs!  They provided not one, but THREE, complimentary appeitzers by way of apology!?  As for the wait staff, they were friendly and attentive, but did not hover.  Oh, and the food.  Divine.  The wine...great choices and not terribly expensive.   In short.  A very good restaurant.",0.787,0.73,0.144,0.125,0.5978125000000001
