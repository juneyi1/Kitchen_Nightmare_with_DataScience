2017-08-11,5.0,This place is amazing. One of the coolest atmospheres in a restaurant I've ever seen. Food was so good. I want to tell people about this place because you would miss it if you were walking by. Definitely go on a special occasion it's worth it. Little pricey but a ton of great food and great service.

2017-08-07,5.0,"We had a perfect anniversary here, literally everything was fantastic. The staff was so nice, at least four people wished us happy anniversary. The private booths with the curtain, lighting and lamps are what makes this place so unique and romantic, we are already looking forward to going again. The fondue was delicious, we had a main course with lobster tail, shrimp (gigantic!), pork tenderloin, chicken and veggies. The sauces were great, some classics and some that were pretty unique/delicious. Huge drink selection and fairly reasonably priced. And loved the graham cracker crumbs to spoon over the chocolate fondue desserts",0.9881,0.706,0.285,0.01,0.7817708333333333
2017-08-02,2.0,"We went because we had a Groupon and because I love fondue! We thought it would be a fun date night out. The atmosphere was very cramped and claustrophobic, as well as very noisy because of the portable AC unit they had running. Another table nearby asked to be moved because all they could hear was the AC. Yikes! It was also so dark you had to read your menu by candlelight and you literally couldn't see what you were eating! One table over from us, a poor guy thought he was cooking a potato and was really severely overcooking one of his scallops! Lol We opted to just do the cheese and chocolate courses, no protein, and when our server took our order, she asked if we'd like vegetables with our cheese. Well, of course! Everywhere else I've ever dined, veggies are a part of the cheese fondue experience. What she failed to mention was that it was an additional charge of $4.50 for  a blah tray of raw veggies- half of which we didn't even like (raw onions and mushrooms in cheese fondue? No thanks!) The food itself was OK, but I've had a LOT of fondue in my day and I wasn't that impressed. The salad was literally just lettuce, two slices of cucumber, and a house made dressing (which was tasty). No other veggies. No croutons. No nuts or seeds. Rather lame.   The dessert was by far the best. They let you toast your marshmallows over an open flame set by the orange liquor burning off on your chocolate, which was a fun and unique experience from other dessert fondues I've had. They also give a little pot of graham cracker crumbs to create a s'more dessert. Overall, I'm really glad we had a Groupon as this place is not worth it at regular menu price. We won't be back as it is too expensive and not worth the value. Before our Groupon, our bill was $100, and that's without ordering protein! (We did have sangria). I'm all for paying for a delicious meal if it lives up to the quality you're paying, but this did not. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.",0.833,0.804,0.103,0.093,0.45931372549019606

2017-07-28,4.0,"This is a place where you go on a special occasion, like an anniversary. It is SO romantic, with rustic decor and VERY dim lighting. It was definitely hard to read the menu by candlelight, so I needed to use the flashlight on my phone (showing my age haha).  We did the dinner menu, and started off with the cheese fondue. There was a variety of food, such as grapes, apples, and bread to dip into the cheese, all of which were great! Next we had a side salad, which was lettuce and little else. They put the dressing directly on the salad, and don't have an option to have it on the side which sucks.  Next, we did the meat fondue. He got beef and shrimp, and I got chicken and scallops. Since it was so dark, I was a worried about our food being cooked all the way through. There were 8 dipping sauces, all of which were amazing. The Sriracha sauce was the best one I think!  Finally, the chocolate fondue was the highlight of the dinner experience with strawberries, marshmallows, rice krispies, etc.  I would only come here for very special occasions, because $150 for two was a little intense.",0.9752,0.83,0.141,0.029,0.5621882086167802
2017-07-27,2.0,Not impressed. Come for everything but the meat. Don't waste your money on any meat or fish. No flavor it's very bland. The dessert and cheese is the only part I found worth it.  Named most romantic spot in Chicago because it's so dark and each seating area feels like you're in your own world. Not bc of the food. I felt like I wasted money.

2017-07-22,4.0,This place was absolutely amazing! I went with my sister on a Monday night with a Groupon voucher. We arrived early and were able to be seated right away. We each ordered the chicken and shrimp. The cheese fondue starter was awesome. I loved that we had different types of bread and fruits to go with our fondue. The salad was a little peppery but I liked it. Our fire kept going out which would make our oil or cheese cool down but our servers would happily relight it. The 8 sauces were delicious. It was something for whatever your taste were. I'll admit that I thought we didn't receive enough meat for the price but I was wrong. We were so full after every course that we just needed to sit before we left. I loved the experience so much that I came home and bought another Groupon voucher the same night.,0.976,0.771,0.186,0.043,0.6147546897546898
2017-07-22,4.0,"My first time trying fondue was in Switzerland and I can say that Geja's Cafe was better! I had purchased the Groupon, otherwise it is a little pricey for the premier dinner. I chose the boneless chicken breast while my boyfriend had the vegetarian. He did not mind using the same frying oil as me, but if you are vegetarian you can have a separate pot however our small table was already very crowded.  The salad was a decent plate of greens. The cheese fondue was very delicious, probably the best part! The main dishes were large and you cook your vegetables and meat in a pot of boiling oil. The variety of 8 dipping sauces were unique and fun to try. We were so stuffed by this point and still had the chocolate fondue to try. Desserts are my weakness so I was very excited for the flaming chocolate fondue. It was so good and the variety of dipping food, including fruit, marshmallows, Rice Krispie, among others was great and hard to stop eating!! We both left almost unable to move with how much we had eaten.  As for the atmosphere, it is definitely very romantic and cozy. We came on a weekday so it was not crowded. The service was decent, however our cheese fondue pot did go out a couple times and I had to ask them to fix it.

My fiancée had dined at Geja's before, however, it was my first time and I was very excited to check out another of Chicago's highly rated establishments. Since it was a sunny summer evening they had a champagne and sangria bar setup out front where we had drinks prior to our scheduled 19:00hr reservation. The food was incredible, we had the aged beef tenderloin - the meat was so tender and flavorful and was accompanied by something like 9 or 10 different dipping sauces, perfect for someone like myself who likes lots of different flavors and tends to have trouble choosing just one when selecting a menu item.

2017-07-12,1.0,"While I had enjoyed this restaurant for years, my most recent experience (last Sunday) was terrible. I with my guest ordered the extreme seafood platter. The seafood arrived on the platter swimming in tepid water. The lobster was in small pieces and very stringy. Basically inedible. Impossible to cook as instructed by waiter. The shrimp and scallops were equally water soaked and frankly disgusting. There was no air conditioning which they attempted to compensate for with loud noisy portable hvac units, which did not help the temperature problem. Waiter was terrible. We had to stand up to get his attention every time we needed something. We were both ill from obviously cross-contaminated food that night. Talked to the manager today who did little except to say ""let him know next time we are coming in"", then conveniently hung up before giving me his name. Nice.

2017-07-08,2.0,"I've been wanting to try Geja's for years. My only other fondue experience has been at the Melting Pot, but I prefer to support local Mom and Pop type places when I can, especially when they've been around Chicago for years. After reading the great reviews I figured I was in for a solid meal. Although the food was alright, I feel we could have had a much better meal for a lot cheaper at another restaurant.  We had made a reservation days before but we were seated in the first table which is essentially behind the host podium and between two narrow aisles, so I spent the meal tucked as close to our table as possible trying not to get bumped. Being so cramped, you also had to speak loudly if you wanted to talk. The table next to us was so close that I didn't feel comfortable having any type of romantic or private conversation, it sort of felt like being at a work meeting before it had begun. Our server had a robotic personality and did very little to explain how everything worked, although we told him I had never been to Geja's and my date had never been to any sort of fondue restaurant. I suppose that added a certain exciting challenge to spice up the meal. On to the food. You don't get a choice on the kind of cheese or chocolate fondue you get, which wasn't as fun. The cheese had a chalky consistency that I didn't mind so much but my date didn't like it at all. The bread dippers seemed a bit stale, my date said his lobster wasn't very good and my $38 vegetarian meal included baby carrots... something I wouldn't expect to see at a nice place (basically the reject carrots that get washed in bleach). I saw another review that complained about the vegetarian meal but I'm pretty easy to please and assumed they were just being a ""Yelp critic"".  Unfortunately, they were pretty spot on with their review. There was a nice selection of dipping sauces which we liked and the chocolate seemed good quality. Really, the only part of our visit to Geja's we enjoyed was the guy who came to check on the fondue pots. He was able to answer the couple of questions we had after our waiter disappeared, and he was really friendly. I found every step of the experience to be lacking and uncomfortable.... I'm really not sure how so many people find this place romantic! Had we been seated at a booth it would have been more comfortable but I still would have been disappointed with the service and the meal. We drank water and I got the cheapest meal and still spent enough to cringe when the bill came. All in all, a big disappointment. As we left, we gave each other a ""well, it was worth a shot"" look.

We do fondue at home and our children know how to behave in a nice restaurant. Sadly we had to cancel our reservations because our children were not allowed.

It wasn't even that loud, which is a feat for a restaurant like this. Food: Uh. May. Zing. First course of cheese fondue... I would bathe in that honestly. The gruyere was rich and flavorful and we asked for more bread and fruit so that we could scrape the pot. Second course,  my boyfriend and I ordered the tenderloin and then the seafood and split both. Perfect amount of food. The tenderloin was the most tender piece of loin. I love my steak rare so I cooked it for about a minute as per Mario's instruction and it was perfect. The scallops, shrimp, and lobster were all incredibly tender as well. Very high quality food. The dipping sauces... all of them were incredible. Lastly, the chocolate fondue was SO GOOD.  Ugh, Geja's you have ruined me. I can't stop thinking about this meal. It's not cheap, but totally worth the price in my opinion. Perfect date spot where you can have a meal that's also kinda fun.

2017-05-04,5.0,"When it comes to price in regards to food, in my opinion they need to be in perfect marriage. This was my first fondue experience, and I was glad I chose this place. First, the service was great! I mean all the way from the call to verify my reservation, to being asked if I was celebrating a special occasion (which I was) and with no question the caller mentioned a booth seat that could be available and that he would put me down for one. Upon arriving I waited no more then 5 minutes to be seated from the time of my reservation. The booth option was a hit! Not only was the booth a great romantic setup, but even the ambiance of Geja's was romantic. We received a card from the restaurant placed on our table wishing my wife and I a Happy anniversary.    Now, the price.....it is steep, your gonna spend a bit over a 100.00 dollars for two people without drinks if you go with the four course meal, but it is the best bang for your buck. I will be honest though, I was a bit worried that I was in a place only using the area as a mask to be high priced, but I said ""meh, YOIO It...""    So, getting to the point...delicious, eat here, everything. The quality of the food was perfectly matched to the price, I saw perfectly why they would charge the price they charge. The portions were perfect, even for fat guys like me (chubby, cant speak for bigger than that sorry). The four course meal included the most delicious cheese fondue with bread and apples. Now, I have never had melted cheese on apples, holly s$%t is it a party in your mouth, and every freakin cheese flavor, ans apple cider was invited. My wife and I literally left the fondue pot so empty, that the scrapes of cheese leftover hardened. Lastly, we got a sexy chocolate fondue for dessert with a plethora of fruit, marshmallows and wait for it....rice mutha f'in crispy treats. WOW!  Now, they were normal sized portions so I maybe exaggerating a bit, but OMG.           So if your reading this, go spend your money, don't be a negative nelly, and enjoy the flavors. Yes, its only fondue I get it, but this place is definitely the place to go to pop your fondue cherry. Awesome environment, and staff. I suggest you top it all off with a White Sangria but they do have great selections of wine.  TIP: DO NOT EAT DIRECTLY FROM THE POT OR STICK....(you will understand that comment when you go...)

Salad: was okay, dressing was nice but nothing to write home about. Cheese fondue: omg this was delicious. I think the waiter said it was gruyere cheese with a mix of other things. We wanted to take a bath in this it was so good. It tasted so good with grapes and apples. It also came with bread but I'd recommend asking the waiter to give you more fruits over bread. Veggies in oil: this was also really good. They gave us an assortment of veggies like broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, bell peppers, potatoes, onions, and tofu. After frying them, you can dip them in 8 different dipping sauces. I forgot how good fried veggies are. I'd recommend asking them to give less tofu, bell peppers, and potatoes and get more onions, broccoli, and mushrooms.

Since fondue is not your typical type of restaurant, the waiter explained how to order and was was included and how it all worked. Although pricey, it is worth the experience. Although I felt I had to pay way too much attention to how to best cook everything, I knew what I was in for.  ( how long shrimp, chicken beef etc have to stay in the oil to be cook properly ). It's easy to lose track and lose some veggies in the oil! The oil over time gets diluted and loses temperature towards the end of your cooking your last bits.Franky the cheese course I thought was the best. Next time I may just do that. The oil smell in your clothes the next day has to be reckoned with. Be prepared with with more than just febreze... you will need to wash and dry clean.",0.9677,0.792,0.159,0.048,0.40873015873015867

We were so excited because it had so many good reviews and the pictures looked nice. We got there 15 minutes early and apparently the best sitting they had for new customers and celebrating is the one right next to the kitchen. I mean, it definitely was a mood killer from start to finish, I can't quite figure out why in the world that would be the best place to sit someone that made reservations in advance, it would've made sense if we just had dropped in. I am disappointed and I will not be coming back. The food was ok, if you like strong cheeses you would love it. The place smells like raw fish and fried food. The service was ok too and I guess it didn't help that we gave our sever the gift card, it definitely showed he was giving just average service and was just waiting for us to go already, he even gave us the check before we finished the dessert. I don't know if this is the same for all, I would hope not but we are definitely upset at this and we go to many places to eat, we do understand and we are patient whenever things go wrong but when we are treated like this for no reason, it surely leaves a bad feeling; like I said, there is no logical reason to think that the best sitting for a new customer and someone that made reservations, is the table by the kitchen where everyone comes in and out and you can see all the dirty floors, etc. They did give us a card congratulating us and the place is romantic.",0.9811,0.741,0.182,0.078,0.49826664348723176

This might have been the smaaaaallllleest table I've ever sat at in the back end of the room. It was so cramped that the fondue pot with hot oil ended up being directly in front of you, you had to move your drinks and water all to the side so it all fit on the table. There was hot oil in the pot which ended up splashing my face, which didn't feel great. As far as the food and the service we received from the waiter, all great. But if we are spending $200/ meal for an anniversary,  I had hoped for more. There was plenty of cozy booths seating we have walked past and where more space was available and the seating was more intimate. Last, though the food really was great, there was only one option as far as what your food gets cooked in, and it's hot oil, essentially deep frying it all. I would have appreciated some lighter broth options that I've tried at other fondue restaurants. I don't know that I'll be back.",0.4977,0.885,0.065,0.05,0.49761904761904757

Reservations are pretty much essential. It's on the small side, so it can be a tight fit. But it's still intimate and romantic. This is absolutely nothing like the Melting Pot. The service is fantastic. The servers are friendly, knowledgeable, and they never rush you. I recommend going with a wine flight that's paired with your courses. You can do a full, typical meal of three courses - cheese, meat/seafood, and chocolate (it also comes with salad). Or you can choose just cheese and chocolate or some other combo. The cheese fondue was really yum. For the main fondue, we opted for beef tenderloin, lobster, and shrimp. It also came with lots of veggies and, of course, 8 dipping sauces. My only two thoughts here: bernaise would've made a great dipping sauce and I would've like more beef. But neither are really complaints. And, of course, the chocolate fondue was delicious too.

It had been my first fondue experience ever. Upon going back, I was kind of underwhelmed. I've moved around a lot so Melting Pot has been the primary fondue option in other places. I'd rather love the local non-corporate one like Geja's....but my Melting Pot experiences have been far better. Service: really good. The waiters are really attentive. They know where you are in your meal and when it's time for the next part. Even when you are not their table, they're helpful. Ambiance: it's romantic and cozy for sure. But they use sterno cans for the fondue, which takes away from the romanticism. Plus the entire place ends up smelling like fuel in a way I've never experienced at Melting Pot. It did not smell good. The low red lighting also made it very difficult to judge the doneness of the meat, so we had to frequently whip out our cell phone lights and kill the ambiance. Food: decent. You get to pick the kind of meat/seafood you have...but everything else is standard and already set. Compared to Melting Pot's options for the cheese, cooking pot, salad, and dessert...this seems less exciting. The cheese was good, but we had to cap the sterno pot ourselves because it was boiling the cheese too quickly so it would have cooked and hardened had we not stopped it. The salad was pretty tasty. The cooking pot....I think it was just a huge thing of oil? So we fried everything? I hate to keep going back to Melting Pot...but they have broth-based cooking pots, which I strongly prefer. Lastly the chocolate part was probably the coolest part here. I thought it was really fun that they gave us marshmallows to roast on it. My one big suggestion would be that they need to give you a spoon for each course. Some of the dippers for the cheese and chocolate rounds would do better having it drizzled on top on the plate rather than trying to dip and lose it. We also lost a lot in the cooking pot and had to try really hard to find it with just the skewers. It was a lot more difficult than I had remembered. I'm not sure I would be excited to go back :/",0.9662,0.818,0.122,0.06,0.5252267573696145

2016-10-12,5.0,"I took my boyfriend here for his 36th birthday and I am so glad I did. We had a great dining experience with exceptional service. Geja's lived up to it's reputation as Chicago's number 1 romantic restaurant. I bought the Groupon to save $20 and made a reservation for Saturday night. We arrived a bit early so we sat at the bar and ordered drinks while we waited to be called. A must try is the cheese spread at the bar, absolutely delicious. The bar is relatively small and the bartender this evening was fabulous. We had requested a booth upon arriving as other reviews had recommended and the request was met. It was definitely worth it, especially for a more private and romantic dining experience.    Our server was Mario, and he was exceptional from beginning to end. We ordered a bottle of sparkling wine to celebrate and Mario made sure our glasses were never empty. To start, I really enjoyed the cheese fondue, it was rich, creamy, and smooth. Geja's salad was also very good, I really liked the dressing. As our main course we both chose The Connoisseur, which included aged beef tenderloin, jumbo gulf shrimp, and succulent lobster tail. The meat and seafood were all very fresh, and delicious. As a sauce person, I couldn't have been happier with the selection of eight to choose from. After, my boyfriend received a birthday dessert and our server set up our chocolate fondue to roast our marshmallows. Pretty full by this point, so we just dipped a few items. I have to say this was the ultimate fondue dining experience. We will definitely be back for another special occasion!",0.9963,0.759,0.228,0.013,0.6351140873015875

2016-10-04,5.0,"I took my partner here for a romantic date night. I had always wanted to try fondue and when I saw the Groupon for Geja's + the high reviews I couldn't pass up the chance. The Groupon is just a dollar value, so there isn't anything unique about it, but it's a really great deal and available often. I suggest looking it up. My initial opinion when I walked into the restaurant was that it was a tad too dark. But as we walked to our table and were seated, I grew to like the lighting. I thought it made the experience super romantic and intimate. The whole interior of the restaurant gives off a cozy romantic feeling. Our waitress was super nice. She came over and explained the whole process to us. She explained how to order off the menu, and what to expect during each course. We got the cheese + meat + dessert combo. Both of us got the meat option that came with shrimp, chicken, steak, scallops, and lobster. The first course was a salad with a vinaigrette. I found it to be very delicious, but wished it had a little more veggies on it. Next came our favorite part, the cheese fondue. It was delicious. The cheese was gruyere mixed with wine. You can definitely taste the wine, but it works perfectly with the cheese. The concoction was creamy and rich. With it they give you a basket of apples, grapes, and an assortment of breads. Personally loved dipping the pumpernickel bread in the cheese, but all of the dipping items were good. Neither of us wanted the cheese ecstasy to end. Fortunately they give you more bread and fruit if you happen to run out, so don't be shy. The next course was the meat. The presentation was pretty. They bring the meat out on a platter with everything organized. In the middle is a mound of veggies. Along the sides were about 8 sauces. I won't go into each sauce since I can't even remember them all. My favorite was a chive sauce that I just about dipped everything in. The meat was tasty, but there wasn't a lot of it. Ordering the meat adds a giant increase in cost which neither of us thought was worth it. It really just tasted like typical meat. I mean by all means order it if you like that; it isn't bad at all, we just found it lacking when compared to the cheese. The dessert was another winner. We loved it almost as much as the cheese. They give you melted chocolate with brandy mixed in it. For the dipping items they give you pound cake, rice crispy treats, marshmallows + crushed graham crackers, strawberries, cherries, and pineapple. I think there might have been more but that's all I can remember. I personally loved the rice crispy treats and the marshmallows. Just like the cheese, the dessert was over before we wanted it to be. In the end we loved the place so much that we got another Groupon and went just for the cheese and dessert. The Groupon covers that combo completely (minus the tip). The food tasted just as good the second time around, but our waiter was a little rude. He made us feel rushed, like he wanted us to leave as quickly as possible. The romantic ambience was completely lost. But the food still tasted damn good!",0.9992,0.754,0.222,0.023,0.5510138888888891
2016-09-28,4.0,"Took my wife here the other night for her birthday (she's been requesting this for years!) We have been to Melting Pot a couple times before in other cities, so we were excited to try something local in Chicago.  First of all, the atmosphere is amazing. Romantic, dimly lit, old school restaurant. Just awesome. Our server was equally great. Attentive, nice, and helpful. Also, the live guitar is an extremely nice touch. A+! The wine list was solid. They had a decent amount of wines by the glass as well as a couple pages of bottles. We ended up getting a bottle of their house reserve for ~$30---not too bad.  The food is what you'd expect. I am never blown away by fondue and usually shy away from fondue places if it's my choice. I enjoy the experience, but I would much rather pay the same money and hit up a steakhouse or seafood restaurant. That's just me.

Luckily, because of groupon, otherwise I don't think we would ever be able to afford to step foot into this place. Seriously. It is extremely romantic and the upscale prices remind you that you better enjoy your time here.  The first time we went, we had a nice little trifecta of fondue: appetizer(cheese fondue, bread squares, grapes), meal(shrimp, beef, chicken, lobster, fish and a medley of vegetables to be fried in the oil), dinner(chocolate fondue, bread squares, marshmallows, strawberries, and crumb toppings). This entire process took a while, but it was extremely delicious, and surprisingly filling! The ambiance is really smooth and romantic: dimly lit, with just a nice little candle lighting you and your partner. The tables are rather small, the booths are much spacier. The service can be good or bad, the first night we had a female and she was spectacular, but the second time we went we had a male, and he just wanted us gone quickly, which spoiled the experience and made us weary of going back. Though we enjoyed it all, we really much preferred the appetizer and dessert as a standalone, which is why we skipped it the second time. I would say that this is a nice, romantic date idea for two.

We got the 4 course meal which included tasty gruyere cheese fondue (with bread and fruit for dipping), a simple salad with a light vinaigrette, a main course of meats of your selection (we did steak and chicken but there were lots of seafood options) plus a variety of veg which you cook in hot soybean oil and dip into 8 flavorful dipping sauces, and lastly the flaming chocolate fondue which comes with pound cake, fruits, rice crispy treats and our favorite, marshmallows. You toast the marshmallows in the flambé flames, dip in the chocolate fondue and then sprinkle with graham cracker crumbs....just magical! All courses were included for @$45 pp (your meat selection determines the price though you can order a la carte if you'd like.) Service was friendly and prompt and you get the sense they have this down to a science but it still didn't seem stale. There's prompt and efficient valet parking for $12, very convenient given the difficulty of street parking in that area. You should definitely make reservations, this place didn't have an empty seat. We were there on a Sat night and they had a talented guitarist playing Spanish music. If you are mobility limited I don't think this place would be easy to visit....it's a flight down to the entrance from street level, aisles between tables are very narrow, some with beams in the middle of the aisles, and the one unisex bathroom, while roomy, has a step up and a low toilet with no bar. My only complaint was our table was directly behind the host/-ess station in the middle of a busy aisle, so my chair kept getting bumped by passers by and there was not a lot of privacy. The table behind me dropped a glass and I got sprayed from behind. Also we were basically sharing our long table with another couple with no true partition, separated only by a large wine bottle and some buckets of wine corks in the middle of the table. If they offer you this table, tell them you'd like to wait for a different one.

Positives: The atmosphere is super cool. It's a very old school vibe, dark, and cozy. Love the decor and ambience inside. A booth looked like it would have been perfect to have a private conversation. The waiters were very pleasant. The cheese fondue appetizer was AWESOME and the dessert was AMAZING, until the chocolate started to burn. Negatives: Our table was small and crowded in with several other tables, it was uncomfortable. We would have liked a little more privacy for our anniversary. The service was very SLOW. The waiter offered me another glass of wine but didn't ask my husband if he wanted one and walked away. The food was fine, we ordered the Princess Geja combination. I didn't realize that we had to cook the food in plain (sort of burned tasting) oil. I thought there would be dipping food in cheese involved, my mistake. I wasn't a fan of the seafood at all, and made the mistake of not salting the beef before cooking it. The dipping sauces were very oily and I didn't like them.  Also, I kept smelling cigar smoke periodically throughout our meal. That wasn't very appetizing. I would try it again and just get the cheese flights or maybe just the beef tenderloin.

2016-07-06,3.0,"My boyfriend knows how much I love fondue so we decided to try this place out. We googled it to see what the reviews were like and we saw that there was a groupon for the place and bought the $50 value for $30. It said one Groupon per group so we just got the one. We completely missed the part where it said we had to call and make a reservation when it's a groupon and made a reservation online but when I called to let them know, they were really nice about it and let us keep our reservation. We assumed there would be a hard time parking so but we actually found street parking pretty quickly and got to our reservation 15-20 min early. It was actually a little confusing because we didn't know we had to go downstairs to get to the restaurant at first. The hostess seated us right away but sat us in a very cramped tight area that I felt like I couldn't move at all in, even though there were more spacey spots available. The whole place seemed really cramped actually and only the booths seemed spacious. The table next us was really close to our table so I kept praying that no one would come sit at the table next to us. The restaurant was really dark too...like way too dark. The waiters actually used flashlights when explaining the menu and a few other times. I'm not kidding. They really used flashlights. But I digress.. My boyfriend and I both went with the ""Prince Geja's Combination"" for our meal since it had a little bit of everything. The salads came out first and it was SO BAD. The salad was very plain, dressing was way too bitter, and the 2 pieces of cucumber in it tasted spoiled...even though it looked fresh. The cheese fondue came next and it was amazing. I love cheese so they couldn't really mess that up though, I would've eaten the whole 4th courses with cheese fondue if I could've. After the cheese fondue was the main course with the assorted seafood, chicken, steak, assorted vegetables, and a number of sauces. I thought it would be cooked in a broth but I think it was being fried in oil (but I was hoping we'd be cooking it in cheese). But I'm not 100% sure on what it was exactly. The downside to the oil was that the residue from the foods kept frying and burned and floated around the pot and would stick to the new foods we were trying to cook. By the end, all this black residue kept sticking onto our food and it was gross. The meats and vegetables were good but didn't taste AMAZING like I was hoping since the prices are pretty high. I also wish the sauces were better...I didn't really like any of the sauces and some of them even seemed similar to each other...I just felt like there definitely could've been better options. The meal was definitely filling though, by the time we got to the middle of our entree, we were both full and we could barely eat our dessert. The dessert was pretty good but I was too full to enjoy it. I do kind of wish they had a milk chocolate option for the dessert because I don't like dark chocolate but it was still really good. In case you're wondering, a couple did end up sitting next to us about halfway through our meal and yes, it was uncomfortable. I could hear everything they were saying and I actually had to stop myself from joining their conversation. It didn't completely ruin the experience but I did feel like I couldn't just talk to my boyfriend comfortably. I feel like a 3.5 is a better rating for this restaurant but since I can't do that, 3 will have to do.

2016-06-30,4.0,"I kind of feel bad only giving this place four stars, but I docked them for terrible parking and over packing the place.   If you don't live in the area you can either pay ten bucks for valet (plus a few extra for tip) or you can roll the dice and look for parking in the area.  The couple times I've been here with the wife we had a rough time finding parking since a lot of it is permit parking and it's a congested area.  We could have valeted, but I'm just not a fan of the practice. I would recommend that you make reservations and, even more so (and this is important), ask for a booth!  Both times I've been here the wife and I always reserved a booth and we always felt so bad for the people in the center because the tables are ridiculously close together!  The first time I went here I was convinced that all those poor souls in the middle of the dining area were part of a big group, but then I saw them all leaving at different times which made it obvious that Geja's was just packing them in.  If you've ever seen the movie Valentine's Day, then the middle seating is very reminiscent of the first date scene with Anne Hathaway and Topher Grace.  If you haven't seen the movie, just know that you'll pretty much be eating shoulder to shoulder with some strangers making it a little more difficult to have a conversation with the person you are there with. Another reviewer pointed this out, but that oil that you use to cook the meat does not smell good and it gets all over your clothes and body.  Not bad if you're going to go home and get out of those clothes and/or call it a night, but not ideal if you're going somewhere afterwards.  Plus, there's absolutely no seasoning on the meat.  You need to use the half dozen or so dipping sauces that come with it to give the meat some flavor.  The meat and sauces were ok, but not $50+ dollars per person worth it. Those negatives aside, though, I was going to rate this place a 3 because of the items above, but the cheese and dessert fondue along with the frangeliccino (sp)(after dinner drink) make this place an easy four!  They use a gruyere cheese with pumpernickel and other crusty breads and it is AMAZING!!!  The dessert is pretty good too.  You get fruits and poundcake for the chocolate fondue and it is pretty awesome, but not as awesome as the cheese fondue.  If you get anything, get the cheese fondue!  Finally, the frangeliccino (sp).  This thing is amazing!  It comes in a very large snifter glass and is made up of a brandy and chocolate that goes down really smooth!   If you can score a booth along the wall and avoid the center of the dining area where you're packed in like cattle, this place is amazing and is definitely worth trying at least once.",0.9849,0.793,0.126,0.081,0.5610886492961964

2016-06-25,1.0,"This was the worst dinning experience I had on my last trip to Chicago. Right off the bat, we were paired with the worst waitress in the restaurant. She essentially ignored us almost the entire time we were there. (We were a party of 2, and the smallest group she appeared to be waiting on) She took our order, and then disappeared. When she came over to light one of the burners on our table, she dropped the cap and lit the table cloth on fire. The biggest issue was when the bill came. We had a groupon, (Like most the patrons that night) and it took her 20 minutes to figure out our bill. When it arrived, she did not treat our groupon like a gift certificate, (Which is how they are normally treated) instead she just deducted from the bill's total. This means we paid about $10 more than we were supposed to, because she charged us for tax on the original total, not the total after the groupon. When I brought this to her attention, she told me, ""I can't control Uncle Sam. What do you want to do, talk to my manager?"" At this point, we had already been at Geja's for a couple hours, and I really did not feel like fighting over $10. Besides the above mentioned poor service, the prices are high, and the restaurant is more about the experience then the food itself. While the cheese fondue is okay and served with a lot of bread, the main entree course is very light on meat, and pretty overpriced given the portion sizes. (Averages about $50/person) The dessert fondue is very good, and really the only part of the meal we enjoyed. In a nutshell, unless you like overpaying for small portions in a dimly lit cramped room with terrible customer service, spend this money at a good place that will treat you well.",0.7491,0.819,0.102,0.078,0.6045391705069123
2016-06-20,4.0,"Right when we walked in, we were surprised by how dark it was! Dark in a super romantic way.. except the tables were so close together that idk how romantic you can be when another group is a foot away from you frying their lobster. But, cute ambiance nonetheless. We came on a Thursday for a pre-anniversary dinner. We were seated to our table with an adorable Happy Anniversary card from Gejas. Great touch! Since it's also Geja's anniversary, a TON of their wine bottles were only $20.. WIN! We got a bottle of cab and were so content. We were recommended to only do the cheese and chocolate fondue so thats what we went with and O.M.G we were SOOO full by the end of it. I couldn't move. IDK how people do that plus real meat/veggies.. They started us with a salad, which was really underwhelming. Bunch of soggy lettuce with 2 pieces of cucumber and dressing. Common.. add some tomatoes. It's not that hard. Maybe some red onion? Such a sad looking salad. As for the fondue, I LOVED the cheese fondue. It was thick and ooey gooey and delicious! The apples and grapes surprisingly went well with the fondue. Bread filled us up quickly. The chocolate fondue tasted like melted hershey's chocolate, but we still loved it. They burn orange liqueur on top first and you can use that to roast your marshmallows. Loved it! We also got clever and threw a marshmallow on the chocolate after we were half way through and made s'more fondue! Maybe they should add different varieties on their menu..  Overall, delicious! Cute ambiance and great amount of food. We had purchased a groupon for $22 and paid $30 afterwards for extra/tip. Not sure if I could justify paying $90 for cheese and chocolate, but definitely worth it with the Groupon! Go try!",0.9966,0.775,0.216,0.009,0.6212207105064248
2016-06-15,2.0,"Came here with my boyfriend. Apparently it's one of his favorite places. I wasn't a fan. Before I begin, this is a very opinionated/one-sided point of view review so if you liked the place I'm sorry! If you don't - I understand, and if you've never been here; I would still say try it at least once! Usually I try not to be picky but with this place it was hard to stay positive. First of all when you come here expect to spend some good money (per person). Definitely don't come here on a budget.  Secondly, the experience they seem to be going for is romantic and unique/different but feeling I got was: too dark and crammed.  Not a vast amount of food choices. You have a few selections to pick from. Not a huge amount of combinations either (if even).  The dinner style is fondue. Fondue cheese, fondue dinner, fondue dessert. Sounds pretty innocent/interesting but take this into account: extremely hot oil boiling on your table. Really hot. Third degree burn from oil OR silverware - hot.  Main course is raw meat and vegetables... yes raw... Meat of your choice that YOU cook on the spot in that boiling table side oil (god forbid you choose chicken but don't keep it in the oil for the full 4-5 min). Also warnings for the clumsy ones in the audience - this isn't something everyone suffers from - however this is not the place for you [and me]: Pretty much everything you stick your skewer in and try to cook will probably end up floating in the oil. Not so romantic. You're now struggling with two skewers to try and juggle the veggie or meat out, whilst clumsily avoiding getting burned and meanwhile the smell of the cooking oil is wafting through the air and sticking to your freshly laundered clothes and washed/styled hair (which if full of hairspray will smell like oil for the next week). Sorry but not so romantic.  Also seating is a bit of an issue to me. This place looks like a basement. Location wise ambiance is what they were probably going for. Cold dirty basement is what I saw. Tables were tight as if they were just trying to fit as many as possible without any particular design in mind. Trying to walk around them just to get to the bathroom was an adventure itself. I feel bad for the servers.  Overall its too much for me. Not going back any time soon. Only good part was desert. But I can melt chocolate and dip fruit in it at home for a quarter of the price. It's a shame because my boyfriend actually really enjoys it.",0.9929,0.792,0.146,0.062,0.5456033164366497

Cons- The menu is on the pricy side of things, but that being said I expect to have high quality food. We had some bell peppers with out cheese fondu and some were a little wrinkled, a sign that those peppers had seen better days. It's strawberry season right now, so I was expecting some nice bright red strawberries to go with our chocolate fondu, but sadly they were a light pink/white.

2016-05-27,3.0,"The restaurant is very nice, and the food was delicious.  I'd never done fondue before, and this was a great introduction.  My only issue was that it was touted as this very romantic place, most romantic in the city, etc. - my boyfriend and I were sat at a two-top approximately 6"" away from the 4-top next to us.  The place was super crowded (it was a Tuesday).  We had to practically yell across the table to each other and almost every time either of us said something, it was followed by ""WHAT?""  Not the most romantic setting if you ask me... Some of the other seats (mostly booths) did look very romantic, but we weren't lucky enough to have one.  I made a reservation in advance, so I'll just have to remember to ask for a booth when I book next time.  We asked the server if we could move one of our seats around to the side so that we could hear each other (and hold hands, because romance), but they wouldn't let us.  There were so many tables crammed into the space that if we moved the chair around it would block their only aisle to walk.  I personally do not like when restaurants are set up that way.  I understand that they want to make as much profit as possible (i.e., more patrons) but it kind of ruined the experience.  To be fair, our expectations were high because everything we read about the restaurant said that it was ""the most romantic.""   That being said, the chocolate fondue was beyond amazing.  My boyfriend and I decided we probably will go back, but we'll go at 9:30 pm when it's a little emptier, get a booth, and just have the chocolate fondue dessert.  :-)",0.9321,0.839,0.108,0.054,0.5861428571428572

Each time he has taken great care of us and we don't have a single thing to complain about.  The food itself is wonderful. The starter which consists of cheese fondue with apples, grapes, and an assortment of breads to dip in the cheese are delicious. The entree which consists of oil to cook your choice of protein and veggies in is wonderful! This last time we did the seafood proteins and it included scallops, shrimp, and lobster. And the dessert is great too! Fruits and sweets dipped in chocolate fondue.  The drinks are amazing as well. We usually order a bottle of wine and a drink each and this last time we both got yummy drinks. I believe they were a strawberry mojito and a pineapple mojito and they actually stuck real cane plant in it! I thought that was really neat. The atmosphere is a bit dark when you first walk in but once your eyes adjust its very romantic and comfortable. It's almost like because it's dimmer you feel like the only people there are you and your date.  Because you take your time dipping your food into the cheese, oil, and chocolate, it extends the dinner and I love that. It's a slow pace and much different than your usual dinner.

Be sure to ask for one of the booths, which are more like private little rooms.

Along the way your waiter will keep everything on fire and at the right temperature--at one point we had four flames going on the table at once, a record, I believe.

2016-04-20,3.0,"Never been a huge fan of Fondue(just seems like more expensive hotpot to me), but friend was incredibly excited about the idea of dipping foods in hot bowls of stuff, so came here on a Monday Night. Décor is intimate...but probably don't need to say anything more on that front. I mean, there are 1,000 other reviews here. Will say that the lighting is interesting; it's as if they decided they wanted the entire place to look like the inside of an attacked submarine. A romantically attacked submarine. With ambient guitar and excellent service.  As for the food, dinners range from $37-$53, which include the cheese and chocolate fondue as well as a salad. Was pretty disappointed with hot little food came with the actual entrée, but I suppose I'm not very used to eating this much cheese and chocolate(Lactose intolerance is a dangerous mistress). The Geja's platter came with two scallops, two pieces of steak, 4 pieces of chicken, 2 oz. of lobster tail(I'm just estimating here), and two large shrimp, along with a much of vegetables. For that price point, I'm expecting a little more but at least the quality of the food was solid. Also came with 8 dipping sauces, and I found they were all quite good. Big fan of the Garlic Aioli. As far as the cheese and chocolate fondue, I wasn't particularly impressed. Cheese comes with grapes, apples, and sliced bread, while the chocolate comes with assorted fruit, rice krispies, marshmallows, and pound cake. The Orange liqueur on chocolate was interesting, and the presentation was nice, though after the initial lighting I thought the flavor of the liqueur could be a bit strong. Got a free piece of cake because it was my birthday. So that + the service was nice. Protip: There's a Groupon ($25 for $65 Mon-Thurs) that can knock $40 off your check, which can go a long way in making this a bit more affordable.

2016-04-09,5.0,"Simply one of the best fondue spots in Chicago. I have visited Geja's numerous times in the past and have always had an outstanding experience there. A little history, my father took my mother there on one of their first few dates. Since I was young, my parents have took me there. Tonight, was my mom's birthday dinner. I booked a reservation ahead of time on Opentable without a problem. I highly recommend other Yelpers book a reservation at least a few days ahead of time. This place fills up quick! My mother and I valeted the car and headed in for a memorable evening. We were seated immediately without any issues. We were seated at a half table/booth since it was just our two. We normally get a booth, but those are first-come, first-serve EVEN with a reservation. No biggie. Our table was surrounded by tons of wine bottles. The venue was dimly lit, for a intimate vibe.  We started off by browsing the extensive wine list Geja's has to offer. My mom started off with her favorite Pinot, I ordered a Ketel One Soda on the Rocks with Limes. (I wish they had Tito's Vodka - my go to). We both decided on the Prince Combo. The Prince Combo consists of Cheese Fondue, Geja's Salad, and a nice sampling of meat, seafood, and vegetables. To top it off, fruit and chocolate fondue, plus their amazing hot coffee. The Cheese Fondue was phenomenal as usual. Nice chunks of assorted bread, grapes, and apples. The creamy Gruyere cheese was melt in your mouth amazing. Next, we dug into the Geja's Salad. Phenomenal. However, I did have to ask for a little extra dressing.  Next, we were brought are decadent platter of shrimp, scallops, beef, chicken, potatoes, peppers, mushrooms, and lobster. The portion size was more than enough for two. We enjoyed conversation over the delicious fondue. We asked our waitress for a little extra chicken and mushrooms. No problem, as she brought out our request with a smile.  Feeling stuffed, we asked our waitress to give us about twenty minutes before dessert. No problem.  Since it was my mom's birthday, they brought her out a special birthday treat. They brought out chocolate dipped pound cake with whipped cream, a cherry, and a candle on top. Our waitress happily took some pics for us.  Finally, we received the chocolate fondue. Decadent and smooth semi-sweet chocolate with a nice selection of fruit, pound cake, and rice krispys. We loved the marshmallows that we were able to roast while the chocolate was ""on fire"".  Unable to move, we couldn't pass up Geja's excellent coffee. They pair the coffee with a side of super-rich whipped cream. You won't need half and half or cream here.  I know a few family friends that have gotten engaged here. It's a great spot for a romantic night out or to celebrate a special occasion!  We had a great time and got a great deal.

Everything was wonderful. And the dessert was fantastic.  I already want to return. You HAVE to come here!!

2016-04-02,3.0,"Just this month we went to the Melting Pot and then I stumbled onto this Groupon, not knowing it was so similar. In comparison, Gejas has more of a unique flair compared to a chain like Melting Pot. However, Melting Pot gives you unlimited items to dip so you can actually eat all the cheese/chocolate and not waste half of it since you are done with things to dip (especially at those prices).  If they had an option to get more without paying, they never told us. Even with the Groupon, it was still more than we normally pay. Plus, there are no options. Only one kind of cheese fondue. One kind of dressing for the salad. One kind of broth. One kind of chocolate.",0.3031,0.933,0.038,0.028,0.6277777777777779

This is normally where I would stop, because I like to keep things short and sweet. However, I can not in good conscious not mention an incident which occured on Wednesday, April 30th. A couple, who appeared to be intoxicated was very abusive to the waiter and manager, going as far as calling the manager a ""fucking bitch"" under her breath. I obviously don't know all of the details, but I believe it had something to do with their Groupon coupon and the check. It appeared that the manager was trying to rectify the situation, but this couple didn't seem to want to resolve anything. Maybe they wanted a free meal, who knows. I will say that this incident came pretty close to ruining a very expensive and enjoyable evening. Luckily, the service level, as well as the food was excellent, otherwise I would have made a scene of my own.

I have had authentic cheese fondue probably a hundred times with Swiss friends in the US and Switzerland where they use real Swiss Gruyere, Emmenthaler, etc. Though Geja's claim their Gruyere is ""real and imported"" I highly doubt it is anything other than some cheap processed cheese.

In a city like Chicago, with some the best food and restaurants in the world, you're money can get you a lot more. We were appalled by the prices! I understand fondue is an 'experience' and can be slightly on the expensive side but our bill ended up being over $300 with tip!!  I might have been able to swallow this a little better if the environment was awesome but it was not. Every decoration in this place was purchased sometime in the late 70's/early 80's and was covered in a pretty thick layer of dust. They keep it so incredibly dark in there that most people wouldn't notice but they can't fool me. It was so dark in fact, that we couldn't tell if our meat was done--some was undercooked, some was overcooked...when I'm paying this much money for my food, I'd like it to be cooked adequately.

2016-03-02,3.0,"I went on a Saturday with my girlfriend for her birthday dinner. We had resevations at 5pm and got seated right away as the restaurant had just opened. It is extremely dark inside! Only light being the flame under the fondue pot and some red light bulbs scattered throughout. It was very hard to tell if our food was properly cooked. The staff were great and never left you wanting or waiting on anything. It took close to three hours to get through the whole meal. The restaurant is very poorly laid out, tables are cramped and crammed in to seat more people than can actually fit. A table for two is essentially a single occupancy table as mine was ungodly small and we did not fit at it. And the hallway to the bathroom is literally only three feet wide and becomes  impassable if more than one person is traversing the hallway at a time. Major fire safety concerns with how hard it is to move around in this place. I can't stress how bad we felt like sardines in a can. The tables are so close together that they need to eliminate about ten or so to make it only moderately comfortable.  About two hours in people started filling up the bar area directly behind my tiny table and it got loud!!! I could hear nonstop grumbling about how long people had to wait past their reservation time (about an hour) before they got seated So get reservations for as early as possible to avoid being crammed shoulder to shoulder in the tiny bar area! The food though was great. The cheese fondue was fantastic! But the price is a little inflated for what you actually get.

2016-03-02,4.0,"Dined here last evening with a Groupon deal, as I don't typically seek out meals starting at $55 per person, but for all it comes with (cheese fondue, salad, entree fondue, chocolate fondue, & coffee), it's not actually a bad deal even at full price. Valet parking is $12 if you're driving. My fiance and I took advantage of the complimentary coat check and were seated right at our reservation time in a back corner of the dimly lit restaurant. And by dimly lit, I mean so dark not only was it impossible to read the menu, it was lit approximately as well as a photo darkroom in a cliche horror movie. Even the servers carry small flashlights, so come, on, turn the lights up just a little bit. Since it's dark and fiery with all the open flames for the fondue pots, children under 10 are not allowed at any time, so silver lining of no crying babies ever.  Speaking of cliches, our dining companions at the tables to the left and right of us were 1) an elderly couple blinding everyone in our corner with the flashlight feature on their cell phones to not only read the menu but also throughout dinner to see what was happening in the fondue pot, and who loudly informed the server that they are old enough to know what they like and would not be eating any salad pre-dressed with dijon vinaigrette, and 2) a stereotypically NY (I'm gonna guess Long Island) couple complaining about how much lobster came on their ""CONNA-SEWER"" tray. Once our opinionated fellow patrons had finished, however, we were able to better enjoy the soft flamenco music and the intended date night atmosphere.  Both the pineapple and the strawberry mojitos ($10) were delicious; the strawberry was a little sweeter/sugarier than the pineapple, though both tasted fresh, with the right hint of mint, and with a strip of real sugar cane as a garnish.The Swiss/Gruyere cheese fondue with white wine and garlic was delicious, and the apples were my favorite to dip. Mixed greens salad topped with two cucumber slices and a mustard vinaigrette was next. My fiance and I then had the Deluxe Seafood (shrimp, scallop, lobster) and the Connoisseur (beef, lobster, shrimp) dinners, served with potatoes, peppers, onions, and mushrooms. Food takes anywhere from 1 to 3 minutes to fry up in the fondue pot, and I loved being able to have piping hot food for each bite cooking piece by piece as I was ready. Servers gently remind you not to eat directly off the skewer that has been sitting in boiling oil (good plan), and clear plates and refill water promptly. The final chocolate fondue is melted with some orange liqueur and served with fruits, marshmallows, and some crumbled graham crackers.  We were there for about 3 hours total for the several courses, since you can't really take home leftover raw food and we gluttonously toughed it out to take it all down, and were so incredibly stuffed when we left.

2016-02-26,1.0,"We don't usually seek out fancy restaurants but after reading up on reviews we thought we'd try this place since it received such high praise. We were disappointed with our experience and will not be going back.  We had online reservations and we arrived a few minutes late but the host was welcoming and our coats were checked in quick which was nice. We were seated in a very cramped tiny area and had to request switching tables. We requested to switch to a booth but were denied and they told us there weren't booths available. When the server came to greet us we also asked him as we saw an open and clean booth right by us. The staff seemed to be be under the impression that we had asked to NOT be seated in a booth which isn't true. Why would that ever be a request, when we're clearly not sitting in a booth. Atmosphere: The area is quite small and very dark. We had one dim light above us which made reading the menus close to impossible. Thankfully we had scoured the menu beforehand and knew what we wanted. The waiters have little flashlights which help but the fact that they need flashlights will tell you a lot of how dark it is in there. I assume this is to create an ambiance but there's a line between ambiance and just too dark. You couldn't even tell when the meat was cooked.The music was quite loud and we had to talk very loudly just to be able to hear each other. I am not sure if this is just because of the table we were seated in. The table was quite small as well which made things cramped. If you do not have a booth just leave. There is only enough room for your food in a booth and you won't be 3 inches away from the next table.  Food: We ordered a Boneless Chicken Breast dinner, Gourmet board and a Chocolate fondue plate between two people. The salad had quite a lot of dressing on it as well. The Gourmet board came with a mixture of bread, cheese and a few types of meat (2 types salami and Spanish chorizo). The place involves cooking the food but it was very very difficult to tell when the chicken was cooked due to the place being so dark. The chocolate fondue not only was barely enough for 2 even though it was 2 separate orders, but had an overpowering taste of alcohol throughout. We were charged $22 for 2 coffees at the end of the meal even though one was to be included in the dinner.  At the end of the day the price we paid was too high for the experience we received. We will not come here ever again. I recommend Italian Village for quality food, excellent service, and very romantic atmosphere.",0.9869,0.857,0.102,0.041,0.5371445105820105

The place itself is very dimly lit and made of lots of dark wood, so it is a great winter place to dine :) Would recommend the premiere dinner (tons of food for one. The share plate charge is worth the lack of waste and lost-waist ) once to get a taste of many things. Keep in mind that all of your entree food is essentially deep fried in the pot of oil/water/broth which is why many reviewers mentioned the lingering smell on clothing. Totally true. Check your coat! If you like veggies, would recommend you get an additional side (if you are plate sharing) as I would have liked more. Wine selection impressive! I had THREE glasses while dining slowly. Ha! Red sangria was excellent, and my girlfriend would highly recommend it.  In short, each course was good and our server was solid. We also had a better lit table than others, which was a bonus in such a dark space. Would recommend with confidence and return again for fun.",0.9948,0.681,0.295,0.024,0.5058333333333332

We went on a Saturday night to find several hundred people lined up for a show at the concert venue next door (Park West I think). So parking was nonexistent. Valet $12.  We arrived about 10 minutes early for our reservation, took advantage of the complementary coat check waited about 15 minutes, so pretty good there. We were seated in the deepest darkest corner of a small dark restaurant. The table was pretty close to the wall and being over 6' tall, I was a bit cramped.  When we started looking at the menu, I realized just how dark it was inside. I could not read the menu AT ALL!! I tried using the table candle and it burned out, so I was left using my phone for light. How romantic.  Salad sucked. Some lettuce and 2 cucumber slices and almost no dressing.  Cheese course was nice.  Here's the real problem. Our main course had, chicken, beef, and seafood. How in the world am I supposed to tell when the food is done when it's PITCH black in the hobbit hole we are sitting in? I had again used my cell phone several times to make sure my food was cooked. This resulted is the food being either undercook or over cooked. Also, the table was so awkwardly arranged in the servants quarters that we could barely reach the fondue pot, resulting in numerous things falling off the skewers. Nothing like spending $55+ per person to wonder of you will have food poisoning tomorrow.  Dessert was good. Lots of great things to dip in the chocolate and complementary coffee.

2016-02-12,1.0,"I absolutely love fondue restaurants and normally find that you can't go wrong when wanting a romantic date.   Geja's proved that is not always true.  The one star goes to our server because he was nice.   Everything else about this place gets a zero star rating.   #1) Upon walking in the door:  You will find a snarky hostess. Management (defended her) needs to realize that because someone has been a hostess and employee for years does not make it ok to get snarky or lie to customers.   She was snarky with me after I told her 3 TIMES I didn't want to check my coat.  I understand that grease can spill and smells can linger.  As a hostess your job is to warn customers that this can happen and tell them it is at their own risk, not to bully or get snippy. If you post signs in a visible place it takes the liability off of you.   She also lied when I questioned her when I saw that others had their coat w them in the restaurant.   She lied by saying, ""I told you it is because your coat is real fur.  Their coats fur isn't real"".  If she had told me that, I would have told her that my coat is wool and has a faux fur collar.  In fact, one lady I had pointed out had (faux?) fur around the sleeves as well as the collar of her coat.  #2).  During dinner, we were consistently interrupted and felt rushed.   #3). The cheese fondue was not melted or hot when we received it and didn't get very hot.   #4).  The beef, scallops, lobster, veggies and sauces were ""ok"" and nothing great.  They were comparable to low end fondu establishments.  #5). Tables or the pot stands in a fondu establishment need to be easy to reach. Both the table where we were seated and the stands the fondu pots rested on were high up. This made reaching the pots and dipping food into the grease and cheese cumbersome and  impossible to retrieve if anything fell into the grease/cheese. This is atypical of the fondu restaurants I have been to in the past.  #6).  The chocolate they used for the desert fondu was not quality chocolate.  It tasted watered down and cheap.  I really can't think of any other time we have not finished our dessert because we just didn't like it.  #7). If you buy a Groupon for Geja's, read the fine print.  There are blackout dates.  We were there on Thursday, 2/11/2016 and did not see that this was a blackout date.  By the reaction the manager had, this happens often.  If this was an honest establishment, they would have told us about this when we called to make a reservation and notified them that we were going to use a Groupon. Not waiting, then rejecting it and pointing out its in the ""fine"" print when we hand over the Groupon when it's time to pay.

2016-01-22,3.0,"The food is good, but nothing special and way overpriced.  When you consider what you're getting, for example, with a ""chicken premium dinner,"" which is the cheapest option:  a couple cut up chicken breasts, a handful of veggies (plenty of them, but still -- a cheap ingredient when it comes down to it), bread, apples, and grapes to dip in a cheese fondue, and then dessert of a couple cut up strawberries, marshmallows, half a banana and a slice of pineapple, a small handful of cubed store-bought cake, with some chocolate fondue for dipping...it's good, yes, but why the $37 price tag PER PERSON?  I just wonder where they come up with their outrageous prices: maybe higher insurance costs for them since you're dealing with hot oil and flame at each table?  I don't know. Also, our waiter last night was TOTALLY ABSENT.  On the bill, it said ""Horacio"" -- not sure if that was actually our waiter, since we saw him at the beginning and end of the meal, and he seemed rushed and not very friendly.  And I know the restaurant was busy, but the fact of the matter is we saw THREE other tables get sat right around us and served their drinks and first courses before us.  So for some reason, our waiter just didn't consider us worth his trouble.  That being said, there was some kind of waiter's assistant who was very attentive to us, to the point that we ended up guessing (mistakenly, it turned out) that we had misunderstood who our waiter was to begin with.  I never caught his name, but he was friendly and attentive, despite being very busy.  At the end of the meal, when I asked about a discount we were supposed to get on our bill, he said, ""Let me get your waiter"" -- and I was surprised to find out that the guy who had basically sat us and ditched us was our waiter!  I hope they pool tips, because he did NOT deserve a tip from us.",-0.941,0.864,0.047,0.089,0.5586621615931961

2016-01-17,1.0,"This is a response review to Mr. Kirby's (General Manager) post Mr. Kirby,    While I appreciate you taking the time to write this post and admit publicly to some of the comments of my post, I do not believe it is your position to judge my liberty to speak my mind through this or other forums. As you know, this particular forum is made to ""connect people with local businesses"" as well as to allow customers to review these businesses (See Yelp's ""about us"" section). My review was simply the description of my experience at this particular restaurant. The fact that you judge this review as an ""out of anger"" review is simply discouraging. As you mentioned, my experience was not as I expected, nor to the standards that you continue to claim your restaurant has. I do understand that people have bad nights and we all make mistakes. However, I believe the level of professionalism and respect towards its costumers relies heavily in the way in which these mistakes are handled. Unfortunately, the hair situation could have been prevented and managed differently. The hair was literally in between the pineapple and the little white container. The service situation could have definitely been avoided. However, as I said before, I can understand that Mario was having an off night or whatever the reason was for his poor performance. We all have those days! Nevertheless, I believe your attitude towards it was highly unprofessional and insulting. The water issue... well I live in the city and know about Chicago's tap water. I am surprised to hear that I am the only person in 17 years that has had an issue with this. Fortunately, there are health department records available to the public that can account or not account for such claim.  We do appreciate your ""compensation"" of the meal. It was unfortunate that it came with a discriminatory comment about the restaurant not being for everyone. As you mentioned, many people ask and contrast the melting pot with Gejas café. There might be many qualities that one has over the other one. Which one is better? I think that is up to the costumer to decide and for the managers and owners to respect. Your comment came after we refused to eat the chocolate fondue and it came out in a very un-polite manner.  The bug issue is what scares me the most about your comment. I want to remind you that you and Mario had a flashlight available when we showed you the bug. You chose to take the bug into the kitchen and return 20 seconds later with a piece of broccoli claiming it was not a bug. Why was that not shown at our table? And... lets pretend it was a broccoli. Why is there a piece of broccoli on my brand new plate that Mario had just brought from the kitchen for our desert? (After the table had been cleaned). Was that my broccoli? What that someone else's broccoli? Was that a broccoli hanging in the kitchen that somehow made it to my plate? Either way, there is a HUGE health concern here.  I want to remind you, that my post was not out of anger. I have the freedom (just as you and everyone else) to speak my mind and use this and other forums and/or media to express my opinion. The pictures are there for people to judge. They can believe it was a broccoli, or they can believe it was a bug. That's not for you or I to decide.  Although I find it interesting that you judge that my bad review is based on anger rather than on the bad experience you admit we had. THESE ARE NOT FALSE CLAIMS, as you have admitted to all of them. If you are choosing to make such statements to demerit my post, it's your decision. Please do not involve the workers at this or other business, as they are not the reason why this happened. As I said, what shows respect and care is the way these mistakes are handled.  Lastly, I want to make clear that if I do seek or not resolution with the owner of the place, as well as the time in which I make that call is entirely my decision and DEFINETELY not for you to judge. Similarly, the way in which I seek resolution to this issue is entirely up to me. Whether I file a claim with the health department, or call the owner, or write a review in this and/or other forums and/or magazines, or do nothing about it... is ENTIRELY my decision. I guess you never know whom you are serving... it could be a yelper, it could be a person with a health department connection, or simply a visitor looking for a nice evening. I do not need to let my server know who I am to receive quality service.  Thank you,",0.6628,0.855,0.08,0.065,0.47974953617810756

We got the seafood selection fondue. The server explained how it work and how we should work the fondue. And cook the food to the right temp. I got say is a fun date experience to share with a loved one. But not a cheap one.

Typically you go for one the premier dinners which is served in 3 courses. In the first course you're given a platter of bread and pot with a mixture of cheese cooking. You cook the cheese fondue yourself (don't worry you are guided through all the necessaries). The bread dipped in the cheese is heavenly!  Then the pot is replaced with a pot of oil and you are given a platter of meats and veggies based on your choice of dinner. The portions are not too generous and I felt I could have done with more pieces of beef and lobster and less mushrooms and potatoes. Still it must be said it was delicious! I will say however that it is so dark that you can't really see what you're cooking and you can easily lose your piece of meat in the pot. The last course is a pot of chocolate fondue that you can dip different pieces of fruits in. Perfect way to end the meal. AGAIN, taste is amazing. Apart from the lighting issue and the less than generous potions of the main course, some people say that there's this smell of oil that is always present. I didn't really feel anything of that sort.

I was a little miffed we were seated at such a small table when others were given the large booths. Were we discriminated against because we were young? We weren't that hungry. I ate a large lunch. We ordered a cheese fondue and one dinner, the combination platter. We both felt the portions were sufficient for two, and I was getting full towards the end. Two hours and s walk later my stomach is complaining I ate too much.  The food was good. I absolutely loved the cheese fondue; the wine gave it a wonderful kick. I did not like the black bread or the hard white bread, though. We lost some of the items on the forks when we were boiling/frying the food, so hunting it in the boiling oil was a pain. The scallops were delicious. They gave way too many filing sauces, though. I only liked two, but the mustard one was delicious, too. I got my cup of coffee with whipped cream after I finished my chocolate fondue, which I felt was strange but I can understand that some situations are like that. At least I didn't get the feeling of being rushed.  I took a picture of my salad because I thought the dressing was a cheese based sauce. My friend laughed at me. It was a basic romaine lettuce with house made vinaigrette.  Our receipt came with a $40 celebratory gift certificate for s birthday or anniversary, but neither of us took it. There are some many great places, I want to try them all. Geja's is good for the fondue experience. Pricey, but lovely. Lighting was definitely too red and black.

Did not see any seasoning on the ingredients so I thought it was not gonna be good but wherever they buy their ingredients from is well worth the money and wait!  The set up is very very nice. The lights are very dim and they have candles at the tables. There's enough space in my opinion between the seats to have enough privacy where you are seated. Great for anniversary dinners or any other special occasion! Needless to say we will be going back because it's too good not to go, however, probably won't go as often as I would like because it's a bit pricey for my budget but very well worth the experience!",0.9935,0.717,0.213,0.07,0.6048579109062981

The manager said that it had something to do with cows milk at that time of the year. I've been coming here for a while now, during every season, and the cheese never tasted like that.

I didn't realize how small the establishment was. It's not a great date setting if you are going with your date because it is literally, elbow to elbow. You could hear other customers talk about their day. It was hard for us to get comfortable which is why I recommend asking for a booth seat. (the booths give more privacy while conversing.) We ordered what the waitress suggested, food was good. Fondue was subpar.  Walked out paying $150 (after tip, and we used a groupon)  There are definitely better restaurants around the area.

The other seafood we had (shrimp and scallops) was amazing, especially the scallops.  We found a groupon deal for $30 off, but didn't purchase it early enough to use.

2015-08-09,3.0,"I really wanted to love this. We went for the first (and last) time for my birthday yesterday.  Here were the problems I had - Hostess was awol. We waited at the door for 3-4 minutes before she came back We (party of 2) got the worst table. It was a 2-top on the right side / half booth. Why did it suck? There is not enough table space for the type of restaurant. As a result, our cooking oil was so close that I got splatter burns. The bench side of the table is also uncomfortable. Church-pew like.  We ordered the prince combo. The cheese course was good enough but they did not light the sterno. So the cheese set up pretty quickly. The bread basket was (obviously) prepped well in advance because the ones on the top were dry. Buried under there were pieces that were not dried out.  The salads - um, don't bother. Lettuce cucumber and vinaigrette - his over dressed mine under. The proteins - good quality meat. But I suggest you avoid the lobster and scallops. They simply are too slippery (not a comment on freshness, but about the smooth texture of those) to stay on the skewer. So you're likely to leave your food in the oil or broth too long because you are trying to fish out (see what I did there?) the food while its overcooking.  My server had such a thick accent I didn't understand him half of the time. Not anyone's fault, but it made the evening more challenging.  The chocolate course came out - but not before a slice of birthday pound cake covered in chocolate sauce. The pound cake is atrocious. Again, dry dry dry. This is clearly the result of prepping too early.  The chocolate course came out and it was delicious (barring the pound cake) for a whole 3 minutes. Then, because the sterno was full-on burning the chocolate starting boiling then burning. Inedible. The chocolate continued to burn for about 5 minutes (that smell!) until one of the runners came and covered half the flame. Didn't matter, it was past return.  Then my sassy gay server (not a criticism, but probably the reason I tolerated his lack of attention) came back and tried to convince us that he knows better than to come between a woman and her chocolate. -- implying he didn't want to remove it. Dear god, take that smelly ruined mess away!!! So, no. I won't go back. I understand why people like it because of the service from start to finish had been more aware of us, I'm sure it would be a grand experience.  But with those prices, I'll go to a sure thing instead.

2015-08-08,5.0,"Geja's is the ultimate restaurant. It has been around for 50 years, and it is going strong. I have been to Geja's four times now, and each time has been fabulous. My sister originally recommended Geja's to me when I first met my boyfriend. She told me that it was the most romantic restaurant in Lincoln Park. My boyfriend and I decided to give it a try for our Christmas Date Night. IT. WAS. AMAZING. We decided to do the full fondue meal which consists of a salad, cheese fondue, main fondue, and chocolate fondue. It is served in courses that are paced perfectly.  The restaurant itself is very intimate. It is small and very dark. The lights are red which makes you feel warm and cozy. The first time we went, there was a live flamenco guitarist. Every other time we have gone, there has been quiet guitar music playing in the background. I honestly can't say that I minded not having live music. The overall ambiance of the whole restaurant is so perfect that no live music didn't make too much of a difference. On to the food. The salad is good, but I wouldn't mind if they didn't bring it out. Let's be honest... I'm not there for a salad... The cheese fondue is the next course. It is served with bread, apples, and grapes. At this point during the meal, I am so hungry and so excited that I dive right in. I try not to eat too much because I am saving room for the main course. For the main course, my personal favorite is the beef and scallops combination. The beef and scallops are served with an array of veggies and eight magical dipping sauces that I could eat with a spoon. On to the chocolate... SO GOOD. The server lights the chocolate on fire (don't worry, it burns out in less than a minute) so that you can roast a marshmallow on the flame! Then it's on to the rest of the goodness. strawberries, bananas, rice krispy treats, pineapple, and pound cake to dip in the chocolate. I have had to resist licking the fondue pot clean. On one occasion, I ate so much (like everything they put in front of me) that I felt like I needed to be rolled home. Along with the amazing food, they have a great wine selection and yummy cocktails. The service is always great, and they make sure that each guest feels welcomed and special.

Since lighting at the restaurant is too dark, it was hard to tell wether my food was undercooked or overcooked. Service also was very slow and I would say ""bossy"". When our waitress was explaining us how to cook in boiling oil, she sounded like my least favorite teacher. She also checked couple times in very rude manner during the process. I felt like I'm passing some test, not enjoying my dinner. For example, she took my already cooking beef out of the pot, and put potato instead, saying that that's going to be better! Really?  Another awful thing is restrooms: only TWO for such a big place. I had to stay in lane for almost 15 mins. When it was my turn, I almost threw up, because toilet didn't flash and smell was horrible. I hardly could thing about food after visiting their dirty restroom. I highly discourage you visiting this place.

2015-07-28,5.0,"TIP: arrive in Lincoln park early and take a walk through the Lincoln Park nature Boardwalk.  If you're going on a romantic date or just looking for a nice night, this really adds to it :). Geja's is only a few blocks away! My boyfriend went here for our first date and we have gone for our subsequent two anniversaries since then.  We love Geja's.  It's one of those great places where not only is the food good, but the people at the restaurant legitimately try to make your experience special.   We went here for our second anniversary last night and it was so wonderful.  When I made the reservation on opentable, I requested a booth and informed them that we were celebrating an anniversary.  When we arrived for dinner, they seated us in a private, beautiful booth next to racks of wine bottles.  On the table was an anniversary card signed by the entire staff!  It's these kinds of little things that make the experience really special. We started with the cheese fondue, which is always my favorite part.  The flavor is just perfect -- a mix of strong and sweet.   For dinner, boyfriend got the connoisseur and I got the seafood deluxe.  What differentiates this place from somewhere like the Melting Pot, is that even though you're cooking the meats/ seafoods yourself (which had the potential for disaster and over cooked food) is that you can really taste how fresh and quality their food is.  They tell you where all of the meat and seafood comes from and you can taste the quality and it's delicious.  It doesn't look like a lot of food, but we couldn't even finish everything because we were so full.  My personal favorite part were the scallops, but the shrimp and lobster were also super delicious. I do wish the lobster was in smaller pieces, because when I cooked it for the length of time they recommended, it was completely undercooked due to being too thick.  The dipping sauces are also GREAT - my personal favorites are the dill and sriracha ones, but the butter is also great because, I mean, it's butter.   Another tip: ask for paper napkins and dab off the cooking grease once you pull things out of the pot.  It'll make everything taste better!! For dessert, there's chocolate fondue.  I love how you can roast the marshmallows over the chocolate flambé and coat them in graham cracker crumbs.  The chocolate is rich and delicious. The food is all great, but the truly greatest part about the restaurant is the atmosphere, of course. It's been voted the most romantic restaurant in Chicago for a reason.  It's romantically lit and beautifully decorated.  The live guitar playing in the background provides a really nice setting - not too loud but still a great part of the noise background.  The booths are very nice and intimate. They have a rule about no cell phones on loud in the dining area and I wish people would listen to it.  The couple next door to us were really loud and had their cellphone going off a few times, I wish the restaurant had asked them to shut it off.  Our waitress was great, but to be honest, I found her quite abrasive.  However, the service is super attentive.  They changed the flame under our oil during the entree portion so it'd keep hot and they took really good care of all of our fondues.    We had a really, really nice time at Geja's.  They really make sure you have a special time there and it makes the experience that much better.  Can't wait for anniversary #3.",0.9997,0.704,0.283,0.013,0.6354312169312168

2015-07-08,1.0,"I came here for an anniversary with my SO. The atmosphere is more crowded than comfy, and seating is elbow-to-elbow with other diners so do not expect an intimate dining atmosphere. I honestly wish I could rate Geja's higher, but found the food disappointing. We ordered the cheese board as our appetizer and were greeted with six bite-sized pieces of three cheese types, enough bread and meat cubes to cover one persons serving, and about 4 fistfuls of grapes artfully bunched on either side of the platter. There was also a thimbleful of jam not worth mentioning that my SO and I tried to make last between the two of us.  As for the fondue, there is but one cheese fondue choice served with your choice of meal. I opted for the International, which consisted of two shrimp, and three thumbsized cubes of beef and chicken respectfully. The meat you cook yourself and are given a side of not 2, not 4, not six, but EIGHT dipping sauces- a not so fancy array ranging from bbq and mustard to ranch and mayo. These are what you dip your meats and veggies into-I hope you enjoy paying upwards of $50 for a platter of mostly raw green bell peppers and broccoli to dip into three varieties of ketchup.  The actual fondue is served with enough deflated grapes to fill a good sized bowl-the rest of your bowl will actually contain an ounce of bread and a few nuts. The bread is the only part that remotely lends itself to dipping in the fondue, and you'll run out of both soon enough until you sit at your table, hungry and ignored by wait staff bumbling around in the dark, noisy room you share with 30 other people until you give in and eat the rest of your deflated grapes. Dessert is hot chocolate fondue served with orange liquor burning on top of it, for show. The fire slowly fades and you dip one of four marshmallows into the fudge, then a bowl of crumbled graham crackers, which is quite tasty. Then you realize the generous slices of pineapple you've been served are mostly rind, and the six AGAIN thimbleful sizes of sponge cake you are served cannot even make the small amount of fudge last. You end up pouring graham cracker dust into the chocolate fondue drippings until your waiter finally returns and gleefully hands you the $140 bill.  Overrated! Overpriced!

While I think this place is reasonably priced for a fancy night out, check groupon or living social for and special deals but make sure you tip your waiter off the full amount of your meal pre discount. 3. They are happy to bring extra bread, veggies, etc. so don't be afraid to ask! 4. Go with people you can talk to for awhile, the meal takes between 2-3 hours and no one wants awkward silence for half the meal. 5. Ask for a spoon to fish out anything that falls of your fondue fork (if you're anything like me, that's gonna be half your meal) 6. You're going to leave smelling like oil. A quick spritz of perfume is a must if you're heading out after  and you're not going to be able to pull off wearing your outfit before you wash it - the smell is that strong.  7. Have fun! Great experience and can't wait to go back. This place is much better in my opinion than any fondue chain in the area (while the melting pot is also great) and I love the history of it - when I posted on Facebook that I was heading to Geja's, my mom (who lived in Chicago 30 years ago) was so excited because she used to come here when she lived in the city, and you definitely can't say that about many places in the day and age of chain restaurants.",0.9938,0.801,0.173,0.026,0.5213327859879583

2015-06-28,5.0,"Geja's Cafe is a treasured dining spot for us in Lincoln park. Yes, it is quaint and dimly lit and romantic...part of it's charm. It is also small, and reservations can be hard to come by, so you may need to be flexable on dining times or plan well in advance. Parking is also an issue, but valet is available,  which we happily utilize. The staff is friendly and will gladly assist you with cooking suggestions and wine pairings. They will also leave you to yourself if you are enjoying the experience. The cheese fondue has a slight tangy bite, which we really enjoy, and comes with bread and apples for dipping. There are 8 different dipping sauces for your meat and veggies. Try them all, if you have your favorites, they will happily bring you more. The food offerings have always been fresh and tasty. We have the combo offering shrimp, scallops, chicken and aged tenderloin. If you do not wish to fry in oil, they will also provide a flavorful broth as an alternative to cook your meats and veggies in. The chocolate desert fondue is a set standard offering of milk chocolate with an assortment of fresh fruits, cake squares, marshmallows, etc for swirling in the chocolate. They do not offer different chocolates or mix-ins, as some other fondue restaurants do, but their version is quite tasty. The full experience of multiple fondue courses and wines is an investment of time and money, that we have so enjoyed. As mentioned in other reviews, they do sometimes have groupon deals. Also, you can signup for their club on their website, they will send you info on special theme nights and 25 percent off coupons for your birthday and your anniversary.  If you are looking for a romantic, slow dining experience, where you can cook togeather, with several courses that could stretch over a few hours and conclude with roasting marshmallows over flaming chocolate...then Gega's is the fondue spot for you.",0.9945,0.831,0.151,0.018,0.49068144499178973
2015-06-25,2.0,"This was our second time to Geja's, the first being a few years ago.  Our takeaway this time was that it is just so-so, and was actually surprised to see all the positive reviews here.   The good: You will leave feeling full.  We both got the Prince combination which, after 3 courses, is pretty filling.   While others have complained about the quantity of proteins, we were actually quite pleased with the amount of each protein that was served, particularly the lobster.  The ambience is nice, but it is quite dark.  The homemade sauces were excellent. The bad: The beef tenderloin had a distinct flavor that tasted like it had either been in the refrigerator or freezer for too long.  Was not enjoyable and considered not eating it.  In some ways, it didn't matter because everything that comes out of the oil tastes like, well, the oil.  You will definitely smell like a deep fryer when you leave here.  The first course of salad was good.  The cheese fondue was nothing memorable.  The cheese appears to just be a white sauce, bread in first course was rather stale, nothing impressive. The main course was a lot of vegetables and the meat/seafood.  All the seafood was fresh, but the beef as I mentioned was questionable.  Texturally, the chicken was rubbery.  Dessert course was decent, chocolate was good.  Marshmallows were delicious, but the pound cake and rice krispie treats were stale.  Again, not impressive.  Service was so-so.   Summary: Given that they don't actually cook anything, one would think that the focus would be on ensuring that all proteins are fresh, and bread, desserts, fruit, etc aren't stale/old.  We left full, moderately happy, reeking of oil, and in agreement that it is just over-priced.

2015-06-21,5.0,"I went to this place as it has been recommended to me multiple times. I chose to celebrate my mom's birthday here.  I don't regret my decision.  Thank you so much Geja's for making my mom and my family feel special.  I ordered the Prince's combo for my family.  It was perfect!   Ambiance: INTIMATE!  if you're on a date...this will probably get you laid.  LOL. Jk.  honestly, this kind of interactive dining, when done sparingly, never really goes out of style.  The place is in a basement-like setting.  It's dark and potentially feel like a dungeon.  But, on the flip-side, it just further promotes the sensation of relaxation. I can't really place the motif of the decor into words...I can say that they had a lot of wine bottles displayed, LOTS of red and black tones and white table cloths.  I won't deny, the place could use an update...but at the same time...decorations are a bit low on the priorities list for me.  Personal experience:  it was SO...satisfying.  Pure indulgence!  You have several options as far as how much you want to eat and how much you can afford.  This was a special occasion so I wanted to make my mom feel special.  The Prince Combo starts with a salad.  It's just a basic romaine lettuce with house dressing ( or was it cesar..I can't recall) Next, they start you on a cheese fondue that has sherry, white cheddar, smoked gouda and I can't remember what the other cheese was.  It was SOOO good.  It definitely gets the appetite started.  While you're eating that, they start heating up the mixture of stock/broth in the pots with oil so that it's hot by the time the main course comes.  So they bring a platter of assorted meats and dipping sauces and you cook these things in the pots.   You end the experience with a DECADENT chocolate fondue that is flambeed with orange liqueur.   Service: OUTSTANDING!  The waiter who was taking care of our table made a lovely recommendation of wine for my mom.  She said she wanted a sweet and grapey wine (it's my mom...back off)  and he suggested a Riesling and a sweet red blend...he even brought her a taste of BOTH.  They were good selections.  I had a sangria and dad had a beer.    In addition to the waiter being attentive and precise with his instructions, the supporting staff were just as attentive..filling our glasses with water, helping to keep our tables clear of clutter, replacing plates when it looked like they were getting over-filled with things, and just general warmth all around. I have to younger brothers that were here and they treated them with just as much warmth.  They were exceptionally nice to my 9 year old brother.   I had called ahead and let them know that  it was my mom's birthday...and they presented her with a cake for her birthday at the end.  It was very sweet.  Then, they offered us a gastrique/ coffee and one of the gentlemen made a suggestion as far as coffee with a liqueur...it was AMAZING.  I had the mint/ almond -like tasting liqueur.  It was SOOO good!  It was warm and just lovely...like a cappuccino almost.   I cannot recommend this place enough.  This is a perfect place for a VERY special occasion/date night/ or just to take yourself out for something nice.",0.9986,0.804,0.189,0.007,0.5017610837438423

Cocktails are expensive but delicious-they make a great Cosmo. Their coffee cocktail with cinnamon is amazing- have with chocolate fondue at the end. I enjoy the scallops and beef the most.

It is an awesome date night place but don't purchase the Groupon and only go with a few bucks in your pocket. You will be screwed at the end of the night. I came here with a Groupon and still ended up paying $180. The place was beautiful and well worth it but I didn't anticipate the addons without knowing they were add ons.

I could not believe how rude this ""man"" was, and it astonishes me that it was crowded because of his attitude. I'm sure 99% of the people were there because of the groupon.

I am a strict vegetarian, while my boyfriend eats meat; they refused to give us separate fondue pots, so I had to only eat the cheese and chocolate and couldn't even get a main course. If they said this was due to the fact that the tables  are sized for infants, that would make sense, but instead they just said that it's their policy and they refuse to make any exceptions. I guess their policy is also to be as rude and unaccommodating to guests as possible.  I've eaten at Fondue Stube, The Melting Pot, and several other small fondue restaurants and have never experienced the problems and disrespect I was served with at Geja's Cafe. I'm so taken aback by their horrible service that I almost forgot to mention that the cheese fondue was pretty gross - I can't speak to the main dishes since I wasn't allowed to have any, but the cheese fondue tasted like a foot at best.

Now, the entire place is very dark as it is; they have very dim red-ish lamps in the ceiling and a couple of candles per table. However, they didn't even bother to put the normal super dim lamps under this particular corner since the ""ceiling"" is part of the heating. To make matters worse, only one of the candles in this tiny, scrunched up corner-table was lit, which mean that we basically in almost complete darkness. I have perfect vision but i couldn't even read the menu at all until I used the flashlight app in my phone. The waiter comes in and recommends one of their multi-course combos, which are +$50.00 bucks a person, but I figured they featured meat and seafood so what the hell..... but the portions are tiny! and I mean like 5 bites worth per food type. Not to mention that you apparently have to cook them yourself in a pot of boiling oil, carefully watching the different cooking times for the different types of meat/seafood...which would be fine except you are almost in almost complete darkness trying to juggle your cellphone in one hand and squishy raw food items in the other, while being near boiling oil in a very tiny table. They were also either unusually busy, or severely understaffed because our waiter barely came to check on us AND it took close to half hour to get the check, pay and be able to leave after we were done eating because the waiter was busy with other tables and took forever to charge my card. All in all, the experience was pretty terrible. Which you know, whatever, you can't win them all right? Except that the check was close to $140.00! I feel absolutely robbed.

Recently, I organized a surprise dinner for one of my best friends and Geja's sounded like a fun option for all.  I live a unique circumstance as I don't eat meat, and the main reason I would not recommend to a friend is because I felt that for the price tag of the ""Vegetarian Delight"" entree it was not quite as delightful as it really could have been. All of the protein entrees include the vegetables that come with the veggie entree. The only extra bit you get is Tofu. Solid. White. Tofu. Pretty pitiful.  Overall the food was fresh, but I had a hard time tipping the waiters 20% of our bill when they really didn't do much for us. (mostly poured the wine and kept asking us if we wanted another bottle or glass or etc...) Regardless, the cheese and chocolate fondue is hard to screw up -- we laughed over dinner, ""The only thing better than cheese is melted cheese"".

I'm just going to act like no one knew about this little hidden gem tucked in a Lincoln Park basement.  I'm going to act like I discovered it myself. Because, honestly, that's how both my girlfriend and I feel, every time we leave. It's OUR place.  It's too personal and intimate of a place to be well known for years. It can't be.  But it is.  We've been coming here since the very beginning of our relationship, and as much as we'd love to hide it away, it's the best fondue restaurant in Chicago and everyone knows it. They bend over backwards to please their customers.  I tried to make a reservation two weeks ahead of time,  and apparently it wasn't enough.  Have no fear, the host assured me.  He took my contact info down, and vowed to me that I'd be the first person he'd call if they had a cancelation. Lo and behold, they did. I immediately got a phone call and was bumped up, like I was the mayor.  That's the kind of service that wins a customer for life. If that isn't enough, the food will seduce you.  I was very skeptical at first.  It was one our first dates, and I'd never been to a fondue restaurant before.  I thought I would be dropping her off and heading to McDonald's on the way home.  I was dead wrong.  I couldn't have been more stuffed. The courses are timed perfectly, and what doesn't initially appear like a large amount of food, levels you with flavor, and fills you completely.  The atmosphere is romantic and cozy, if I'm going to be polite. If I'm going to be frank, it's cramped.  If you don't make it a point when making a reservation, and roll the dice, odds are that you'll be shoe-horned into a tiny back corner table. It happens.   But despite that sometimes annoying aspect, I always leave happy. We save Geja's for the special occasions, not because it's expensive --it is-- but because it's OUR place, and I don't care who else knows about it.",0.902,0.853,0.094,0.052,0.5082491582491583

Don't get me wrong, it's very unique, romantic, and something everyone should experience, once.  But at over $50 per person (without drinks), you're paying a huge premium for what you get. The opener is a cheese fondue, with some sliced apples, grapes, and bread chunks. Then dinner - let's face-it, you have to cook yourself, so all they're doing is bringing the raw food to you on a platter (and it's not much food - for the $50, you get 2 shrimp, one piece of lobster, and 2 small pieces of steak).  The platter includes some dipping sauces and vegetables, but that's it. Dessert, is just some more cut fruit, packaged Rice Krispy treats, and pound cake, with a chocolate fondue. I'm not a big eater, and do prefer quality over quantity, but for these prices I'd rather not do the work, and be able to enjoy a master chef's creations.",0.8413,0.906,0.076,0.018,0.4213247863247863
2015-03-26,3.0,"Having grown up with the tradition of a cheese fondue on New Year's Eve I was very excited to try this place. My friend had a coupon for any of their premier dinners at $35.  Overall I paid $52 for drinks, food and tip.  The food was three courses followed by a coffee. The first course was a cheese fondue. Now in my mind it should essentially be emmental  and Gruyere cheese melted into dry white wine with a tot of cherry brandy added. What we got was a bowl of béchamel sauce... I really felt cheated. Part of the fun of fondue is the stringy cheese you pull from the bottom, not a white sauce dip. Not impressed.  The main was various meats and veggies which you cook yourself in bubbling oil. It was okay and the staff clearly explained how to cook the various meats and took care to ensure we were aware of the hazards of eating raw meat.  Finally the chocolate fondue came, with some alcohol on top and set ablaze it was fun to roast marshmallows before digging into the sauce.  Would I return here? No, am I glad I tried it? Yes. I had a very enjoyable evening here but it didn't live up to my expectations One tip for them, at oil fondue restaurants in japan they offer a spray or two of febreze for customers leaving.

You go here because you aren't going to have the best meal of your life, but you're going to have good food, good service and a hilariously fun dining experience.  We had a great time ""trying"" to cook our own food. Yup, pieces of food kept falling off into the vat of oil and between conversation we forgot about the onions and ended up with the most fried onions ever, but that's the whole fun of this experience! We were laughing and giggling the entire time. This place also gets super busy and you can tell the servers are trying their best to help you ""eat faster"" so you don't end up like us taking 3 hours to eat our meal. BUT we kept that last potato cooking for 20 minutes just so we could keep the servers sweating wondering if this couple was ever going to ""understand"" cooking fondue. heheh What you get  for the multi-course meal: --Cheese with bread & fruit --Salad (basic) --Meat options: I have a seafood allergy so I just got the steak, my BF got the Connoisseur. His portion was extremely small, which is my guess due to the cost of lobster & shrimp? Mine was huge so I gave him some of my meat. 8 different dipping sauces. I was allergic to them all but 3 and only ate the butter & herb, which tasted like heaven.  --Chocolate on fire with fruit, marshmallows, pound cake, rice krispie treats, graham cracker crumbs.  We kept starting our marshmallows on fire to the dismay again of our server. oops! So ya, food is basic, portions are small, but plenty, and we left STUFFED. Wine was good. Experience was so fun.

Fondue was a very small portion considering its the main draw of the restaurant. The main course is a very small amount of protein with a heap of low-quality vegetables. The idea of cooking your own food, while kind of fun, is a complete failure. The reason I go to restaurants is to have an accomplished staff of cooks prepare my food to the best of their ability - not to fry bunch of things on my own. Everything came out mediocre at best, undercooked at worst. Also the ""chocolate fondue"" was a dead ringer for hersheys chocolate syrup - and the strawberries we dipped in it were weeks short of ripe. If you're looking for a romantic break from cooking dinner at home, avoid this restaurant. Save yourself some money and cook up a steak the right way(not frying it in soybean oil) - then stop by gejas for the cheese fondue if you're still hungry. BUT if you like confusion, hot oil, low lighting, and maybe food poisoning then hit up gejas.

I'm still not sure what kind of ambiance Geja's is going for (European? Spanish?), but be prepared for a cozy, romantic experience.  I came with a friend and we both decided to get the chicken breast dinner set (includes salad, cheese fondue, chicken fondue, and dessert chocolate fondue). The salad was pretty good, just some mixed greens and a nice light dressing. I'm always a huge fan of cheese fondue, and the cheese had a deep but not too overpowering flavor, which I enjoyed. The main course, the chicken, came with assorted vegetables (bell peppers, onions, broccoli, potatoes, mushrooms) as well as 8 dipping sauces (my favorites ended up being the aioli, dill, horseradish; basically all the creamy ones). Everything was fresh and delicious. Dessert was absolutely wonderful; you first have a chance to roast your marshmallows on top of the chocolate fondue for a few minutes as the alcohol burns off, and then there is assorted fruit and cake and Rice Krispie treats to dip in the chocolate.  Service was very friendly, but the gas canister lighting our pots kept going out and we often ended up with not very hot fondue.

2015-02-10,5.0,"As Teena Marie would say ""Ooo La La La""! Intimate. Romantic. Delicious. Geja's was all three wrapped up in a bow. Thanks to restaurant week, I was introduced to my first fondue dining experience without totally breaking the bank... and it won't be my last time there. When we arrived for our reservation, we had to wait a few minutes before our table was ready. We were asked to the bar to wait where we ordered a glass of wine. I knew it was going to be a great meal as soon as I tasted the yummy bar snacks - cheese and crackers! I wish I had taken a picture of the cheese... it was a soft cheese spread in large communal bowls of sorts. The restaurant is fairly small and tables are tucked in any corner possible. I wonder if they've ever been hit with fire code violations?! The tables are bolted down so don't try to nudge away from the table next to you, it won't work. Believe me, we tried. If you're so lucky though, there are cute booths with privacy curtains in between. Our server was Mario or was it Miguel. I think that technically Mario got the tip but Miguel actually did all of the work. Miguel was very attentive, explained how everything worked and checked on us throughout the meal. It was definitely appreciated although towards the end it felt a little overboard. It was nearing 10pm and we felt like we were being kicked out although there were plenty of other tables left in the restaurant. That was the only downer part of my experience but it wasn't annoying enough to drop a star. The food. Surprisingly very filling! For starters, you get cheese fondue with a tray of fruit and breads as well as a side house salad with a Dijon vinaigrette (I wasn't a fan of the dressing so I wish I was given the option for something else). For the main dish, we ordered the chicken breast and jumbo shrimp combo and the deluxe seafood, which came with jumbo shrimp, scallops and lobster tail. With that order, you also get a bunch of vegetables and some potatoes and a variety of 8 different dipping sauces. For dessert, there's chocolate fondue with more fruit, marshmallows, rice crispies, graham cracker crumbs and pound cake. I tell you what... it was all delicious! After we got the hang of how long to dip our food in the boiling hot oil without getting burned!!! it was smooth sailing. We concurred that the best tasting item was definitely the jumbo shrimp!! but again, everything was tasty. Well, the only thing I could do without next time is cooking the broccoli. Broccoli is my favorite vegetable but not when fried apparently... the head had this weird crunch to it. Oh and the best dipping sauce was... well I have no idea what the name was but only 3 of the 8 were in the spicy category. I enjoyed all 3, but the one on the end (do they also present them in the same order? LOL) was hands down the best. We both stopped using the other sauces halfway through and just devoured that one. Before you leave, they invite you to fill out a card with your email, birthday month and anniversary month so that they can email you a $40 gift certificate and invite you to come back. Why not?

2015-02-04,1.0,"I did not want to write this review.  I tried to send them a message via their website, but it did not work.  I called the restaurant and nobody answered and the system did not accept messages.  So, as a last resort, I am doing this.   I brought my girlfriend there last night for our 6th anniversary, so it was a very special occasion.  Having read some reviews, I picked this restaurant for its reputation of a romantic setting and fun atmosphere.  However, the execution of the staff fell so short, that it made the evening nearly impossible to enjoy.  After being seated, we did not see a server for 25 minutes. Literally, 25 minutes. The wait assistant, who was the only bright spot of the evening (a fellow with a braided pony tail - I do not recall his name), did his absolute best to help us out but was just clearly under trained to adequately provide service expected of a restaurant that is charging $52 per plate.  After 20 minutes, after his 3rd or 4th stop to our table without seeing an actual server, we ordered a glass of wine from him .  Unfortunately, because he was a wait assistant and it was not his job, he did not have a recommendation or any kind of description of any of their wines available, which is an extensive list.  We basically just blindly chose a random glass and hoped for the best.  He did tell us that our server was having problems with their computer system they use there, however, this is an unacceptable excuse to have not stopped by our table even once in nearly a half hour.  Having worked in fine dining before, I understand problems arise, but it is common sense to at very least stop by our table, say hello, explain a thing or two, and figure out the problem behind the scenes.  Finally, after about 45 minutes of not seeing a server, we put in our order with the wait assistant.  Now, we had never been to a fondue restaurant before, so we really had no idea what we were doing.  We received absolutely 0 guidance, 0 recommendations, and 0 description of items at the restaurant or how things worked.  Finally, after putting our order in (we each got the prince's combination) and having received our first course (a salad), a server from another section came over to again explain there was some problem with the computer system.  We had already put our order in and the evening had already become sour.  We really didn't receive any kind of apology or reasonable explanation as to what was going on.  The next course was a cheese fondue, which was fine.  The bread seemed very dry and almost stale, the fruit was decent.  At this point, we still had no idea what we were doing or what was going on.  After finishing the cheese fondue, our entree arrived, delivered by the wait assistant.  He again did his best to explain what the food was, but did not know every sauce we were being given and had absolutely no recommendation as to what went with what.  Now, the food comes completely raw and you deep fry it yourself at the table, which is fun in theory.  However, the wait assistant really had no useful information as to how to actually cook the food, so the first portion of our meal we had absolutely no clue what we were doing.  The food frequently slipped into the frying pot and became inedible.  Finally, mid way through our entree meal, our server came over.  I still don't know his name, or anyones name for that matter.  I asked him what exactly we were supposed to do with the food and if he could explain the process.  He did, and the food after that became a bit better because we had an idea of what we were supposed to be doing.  Again, the mood and the feeling was completely destroyed by this time so it was really not much of a help to salvage the evening.  After we finished, the dessert course came.  It was a chocolate fondue with fruits and other sweet treats.  This was quite good, probably the best part of the meal, but the flame under the pot kept going out so the chocolate quickly became cold and thick before we could even finish. Overall, I feel incredibly ripped off.  The bill came to just under $140 for 2 glasses of wine and 2 entrees.  For such an expensive restaurant, I expect absolutely outstanding service, frequent check ins, and over the top descriptions and recommendations.  Instead, we literally got no service.  I could have gone to whole foods and purchased all the same food, cooked at home and been just as satisfied, all while saving $60.  You go to these restaurants to be waited on and guided through your meal.  I feel like a fool for having left any sort of tip.  What I should have done, and what I wanted to do but couldn't because I had no cash, was give the wait assistant a $20 and leave nothing for our ""server.""  I would absolutely not recommend this place especially for a special occasion, because if the service we got is any indicator, your evening will be ruined before your first sip of wine, which may very well not be taken for an hour after your reservation.",0.993,0.816,0.112,0.072,0.4766163555320181

Instantly while we were waiting for our server, we labeled it as one of the most romantic places we have ever been to. We had groupon and opted for vegetarian foundue course. It started with cheese foundue and fruit/salad/bread, moving on to vegetable platter which we need to fry in oil - finishing with chocolate foundue with fruits/sweets. Main course can become overwhelming sometimes with oil frying. You're distracted between what is in the pot and what goes next. We tried to just eat first and let oil sit idle for a while but our server said then it will become too hot. Keep on putting something in it. But cheese and chocolate were AMAZING. We loved it. Four stars because they kept on rotating our servers. I had three servers asking us sometimes same questions.  But this is a great place.

If I want to cook my own food I'll just stay at home and save the money! First off, as soon as we walked to the door, hadn't even stepped inside yet, it reeked of old stale oil. Almost turned around, but had a reservation and didn't know if we could get into anywhere else at that hour. The smell only amplified inside, but you do get used to it (don't know that that's a good thing). They seated us at one of the smallest tables, right behind the hostess station and where the front door opens.  The dinners are priced anywhere from $43 - $64 per person, it includes a salad (which was alright), cheese fondue with bread and fruit (glorified Velveeta), then the main course of your protein choices and veggies with many dipping sauces. Cooking shrimp in hot oil is one thing, cooking beef or chicken and not being able to see because they keep it very dark in there is very unappetizing, hard to tell if it was done! Scary! Then was the chocolate fondue with fruit and marshmallows. The best part of my meal was the fresh whipped cream they brought with my after dinner coffee.  Left feeling that I had been ripped off and unsatisfied. Plus I had to strip off all my clothes and take a shower because I smelled of the oil so badly.

2015-01-25,4.0,"I do agree this is a very romantic restaurant - low lighting and a pleasant din filling every room would also make it easy to converse (and fill any awkward silence) on a first date.  However, it is also great for groups of friends because the food is interactive and also delicious... as long as you don't bring too large a group because then you would be shouting to be heard.  The first time I was here the whole place smelled a bit like wet carpet but that is now rectified and all I could smell was the enticing aroma of different foods cooking.  How it works:  You order a fondue meat option and all of these come with the cheese fondue appetizer and chocolate fondue dessert to share at the table.  The cheese fondue and the dessert fondue are clearly the most delicious parts of the meal - the fruits used in both were also of very high quality.. I don't believe I've ever bitten into a more delectable grape than the ones served here.  The main course is an array of uncooked meats that you then fry yourself in the fondue oil.  I do wish they had a broth option because my hair and clothes did smell like oil afterwards.  The meats are of high quality - my favorites cooked were the shrimp, lobster and scallops.  I believe chicken and prime rib are not really meant to be cooked in this manner so they came out a little tough (although the prime rib went very well with the Worcestershire sauce.  So many dipping sauces!  And I do love a good dipping sauce.  After you've eaten your fill of the main course they bring out the dessert fondue.  I constructed little s'mores by roasting the marshmallows in the flambe (as recommended by our waitress) and then dipping in the chocolate and graham crackers.   Only a few drawbacks - we had a reservation and had to wait 25 minutes to be seated (but that is expected on a busy Friday night so I'm not deducting stars for that) and we had to wait a long time for the bottle of wine we ordered early on.  Even though we ordered it immediately (I like to have a glass before I begin to dine) they brought it out with the cheese fondue - which you can't really delay eating because it starts to burn on the bottom.  I did eventually blow out the flame under the cheese so I would be able to eat every scrumptious morsel.   I believe next time I go I will just get the shrimp and scallops - or perhaps the cheese and dessert alone... as those were really the stand out courses.   And I'll request a delay in beginning so I can have a leisurely glass of wine before digging in to the cheese fondue.",0.9967,0.847,0.144,0.009,0.5070374149659864

But def glad I bought the groupon for here for one it saved me some money and I got to experience it with out leaving broke :) the sangria was very good. And the cheese and chocolate was good too.... I only tried the chicken and beef which was good and U make it your self which is a cool experience. My fiancé had the shrimp he said was good no sea food for me tho.... But it is pricy so I'm warning but def worth it ONCE just because of the price,0.9881,0.711,0.235,0.054,0.6844642857142856

If you don't, things come out a bit raw. I like med rare beef but not so much with lobster.  Just give it an extra few seconds. Cheese fondue with apples....awesome. Finish with the Chocolate fondue. And you will smile as you roll out of the place. Fair price and great service. Very romantic too.

Our table felt very cramped the place was full but they were nice enough to squeeze us in when someone else did not make it to their reservation, and our plans didn't work else where so we were kinda lucky. This might sounds silly but If you are not familiar with fondue, read a little about how long it takes to cook everything and see how it looks when certain things are cook. I personally never cook with scallops, so i'm pretty sure my husband and I ate some raw stuff lol. Horacio did tell us how long it takes each piece of meat, poultry and seafood but I could not remember all of the different times. The dessert was delicious I really have no complaints.

Servers take the time to explain the sauces and how to cook the food.  They also check back periodically to replenish plates, sauces or vegetables, but they never are in the way.    The fondue dining experience is unique.  It cannot be hurried and there are some who don't like the oil cooking, but it's traditional.  My first fondue experience was in  Quebec, followed by Montreal and Geneva.  Geja's is definitely in the same tradition and has not really changed since it opened.",0.9463,0.89,0.11,0.0,0.471031746031746

We ordered the premier fondue dinner, which is a four-course dinner with a variety of different dishes. It includes free coffee, too. The first course was a cheese fondue appetizer served with fruit which was really tasty. The second course was a salad. The third course was a variety of meats and vegetables served with dipping sauces. Our server, Nate, walked us through the cooking process and it was fun to cook the different parts individually and try the different sauces. The sauces had a variety of flavors and they were all tasty. The final course was a chocolate fondue and it was a nice wrap-up to the dinner. They even gave me a slice of cake for free for my birthday, which was really sweet! We ordered a bottle of wine for the table, too. Nate answered all the questions we had about the wine and even gave us a couple of recommendations.

2014-10-31,4.0,"Geja's Cafe was recommended to us by my husbands coworker so we decided to try them out for my birthday last night. I came in skeptical because I read some bad reviews about this place on Yelp. I kept an open mind though because there were a lot more good reviews than bad. When you first walk in, it strongly smells of oil. I suggest you wear something you wouldn't mind washing the next day and be mindful of potential grease splatter. The smell may be an issue for some people, but I didn't mind.  We were lucky to get a booth seating because there is more lighting and space. The other tables I saw were very close together and didn't have much lighting. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful with the menu and wine choices. We went with the international meat choice which was steak, chicken, shrimp and vegetables. That also came with a cheese fondue, salad and chocolate fondue dessert. If you have been to The Melting Pot, you would know how many fondue options they have for everything. Geja's Cafe does not have as many options, but has equally, if not slightly better quality food. The cheese fondue was very tasty and I can see why people would complain about the bread being stale. I'm not sure if that is how it is supposed to be to make dipping easier or if that's just how the bread is. It didn't taste bad or anything. The salad was average. Just an olive oil and lemon type dressing and fresh greens. The chocolate dessert was very cool and delicious. The waiter flambés the chocolate and allows you to roast marshmallows over the flame. It was a fun experience overall.  We chose an ""around the world"" wine paring with our dinner. It was three different kinds of wine with each meal. We started off with a very light white wine that was good. With the meat, we got a very dry red wine. I am not a red wine person myself, but my husband really enjoyed that. Then with dessert we got a very sweet dessert white wine. That was my favorite.  I saw that there is valet parking available. We used public transportation though. Another thing to keep in mind is that this place is on the pricey side. $50+ per person plus wine costs. Overall I had a great meal and experience, but I will also keep The Melting Pot in mind when I want a less fancy and cheaper option.",0.9931,0.822,0.135,0.042,0.4769560185185185
2014-10-29,5.0,"I went to Geja's back in early September the night my fiancé and I got engaged and we had an amazing meal.  First of all the service was outstanding from beginning to end. I wish I could remember our server's name because he was truly wonderful. He was attentive without being overbearing or annoying. As for the food...it was delicious. We had a groupon, because we're thrifty even when celebrating, so we each got a premium dinner that includes the cheese fondue, salad, entree, and chocolate fondue. We added 2 glasses of wine to that also, since it was a special night. To start, the cheese fondue was perfect and honestly, I could have eaten just that all night. The pretzel bread served with the cheese was fantastic and my only wish is that there had been more then 2 pieces of it total. The salad served after was good, but it was nothing special or crazy. For the entrée, I got the deluxe seafood which included scallops, lobster, and shrimp, while my fiancé got the prince geja's combo which had beef, lobster, scallops, shrimp, and chicken. Along with the meat, you get a ton of fresh vegetables (potatoes, broccoli, onions, mushrooms, peppers) and 8 dipping sauces. My favorites by far were the scallops, broccoli, and onions. The scallops were perfect with the butter dipping sauce, while the broccoli and onions were great with the dill one (which was my favorite sauce of the 8.) At this point in our meal we were already close to stuffed, but we had chocolate fondue left! It came out with a tray containing pound cake, rice crispie squares, fruit, graham cracker crumbs, and marshmallows, along with a cup of coffee with whipped cream instead of your standard coffee cream. Before the server left us to gorge ourselves on all the sweets, he lit the chocolate on fire and with the flame that lasted for a minute or two, we were able to roast our marshmallows and then dip them into the chocolate and graham cracker crumbs. It was delicious and the perfect ""s'more."" After the chocolate and coffee we had to practically be rolled out the door like Violet in Willy Wonka, but it was absolutely worth it.

We usually get there early to hang out by the bar because they have this great cheese spread and the bartenders are always friendly, even if you are just walking by. Best time to go is in the winter, its super cozy and I enjoy the decorations outside.  Go for a bottle of red wine at dinner. Their prices are fair and with all of the courses, the bottle is perfect for a table of 4 or 2. Even if we pay full price or have a discount, the staff ALWAYS treats us like we are the only table they are serving that night. The staff are great, and I'm sure with all the traffic in there, it isn't easy. 5 stars to them! They could probably mix it up with the sauces a little more. We have been going there for 2 years now, almost every month and its still the same dozen sauces. They should bring back some of the sauce winners from this summer.

First, let me say 13th century France does not automatically equal romantic, but to each his own.  It is dark, but not necessarily romantic/seductive dark...just frickin' dark.  There was no music!!!, and it was dark. We had an early reservation.  Service was friendly, but I felt an undertone of being rushed.  At one point, management was walking around, not seeing how things were, but looking as if they were in need of tables and people who have overstayed their welcome should take a hint. Awesome wine selection!  Bar drinks are nothing to write home about and were slightly overpriced. Now for the food... If you order a premier dinner, you are given cheese fondue, salad, your meal and a chocolate fondue.  Unlike other places, it is not your ""choice"" of cheese, salad or chocolate, but rather a house blend.  The cheese was good; the chocolate, not so much; both portions small.  Salad was basic field greens with vinegar and oil.  The base for the cooking pot was plain hot oil!!  What?!  With all the wine options, I can't even get a drop of white wine or SOMETHING?!  I added salt, pepper, all the veggies and lemon to try and give it some flavor, to no avail!  You are given four skewers for the meats.  My patience (or stomach) doesn't allow me to cook four pieces of meat 3 min at a time, however there is no ladle to scoop out your items to truly cook more than one item at a time.  I did anyway, and it was quite the show.  Finally, the birthday cake: sponge cake with chocolate syrup all over it... I understand not being a chain, the need to charge more, but give me more to want to pay for.  There was a wine tasting event coming up which looked to be more worth the money, had my taste buds been happy this experience!  But...no!",0.9854,0.834,0.123,0.043,0.5224386724386725

A few tips/things to remember - There is not a doggy bag so you are not bringing home leftover cheese and chocolate.  Please tip accordingly.  Our bill was close to $300 and the tip was accordingly to the 18/20/25% gratuity standards.  The service is great.  If you give the valet a $20, he will keep the change.",0.9987,0.774,0.222,0.004,0.6422077922077922

It was a perfect creamy flavor, served with apples, grapes, and two kinds of breads. Yum Yum Yum! I was sad to see them remove it from the table.  Then I got the sampler platter that came with steak, lobster, scallops, and shrimp, and served with an assortment of veggies. This was good, and the biggest chunk of the evening, however it was my least favorite out of all 3 courses. Everything was yummy, but I just couldn't cook the proteins as perfectly as if a chef had. The experience was great, but for the money I probably could have gotten a much more yummy meal.  The final meal was the chocolate, and it was quite tasty! It was served with rice crispy treats, marshmallows (that you could roast in the orange liquor), fruit, and pound cake. It was very yummy, and was topped off with coffee.  We (4 of us) shared a bottle of red wine and a bottle of white. It lasted the whole meal, and was very good. The server made sure our glasses were always full, which was a nice extra touch.

The restaurant explained it was for safety reasons which I somewhat understand, however it's quite discriminatory to not allow children to be seated. Needless to say we should have read the fine print before purchasing the Groupon but I still will NOT visit this restaurant ever due to that practice. Sad we wasted our money but I'll take that loss for a restaurant that won't allow my 5 year old to be seated",-0.9249,0.824,0.029,0.147,0.525

The blonde with glasses and ponytail was very rude and was stuck-up when I asked her why we couldn't get the booth with the curtains. Other than that the food was great. Tastes better than it looks.

2014-08-22,4.0,"When we first arrived, we were warmly greeted by manager, Kirby Matthews. He invited us over to the bar where our bartender, Arturo, treated us to a few of their cocktails including a chocolate martini and a tropical drink, along with a few tastings of their wines. Kirby sat with us to share the history of Geja's and to provide some really insightful information about their wine program. The restaurant has an extensive wine list and every other month, they have a featured wine list based on a theme. This is such a fun and creative way to showcase wines and to help folks find something they enjoy. Another way they make wine tasting and pairing fun is through the monthly Winemaker's Dinner they host. These dinners usually held on the first Monday of every month brings a winemaker to the restaurant to meet and share their wines along with a four-course fondue dinner for $55! Each course has a wine pairing and the four-course dinner includes: Geja's house salad Cheese fondue with fresh fruit like grapes, apples and a variety of zesty breads Hot oil fondue with Beef tenderloin, chicken breast and jumbo shrimp, as well as a mountain of fresh vegetables served with 8 house made dipping sauces Flaming chocolate dessert fondue with roasted marshmallows, buttery pound cake and a variety of fresh fruits Each course is paired with an appropriate wine along with a lively discussion lead by a representative of the featured winery. These are highly popular interactive dinner events where space is limited and reservations are only accepted by telephone only. If you miss the November Winemaker Dinner, no worries - the next one in December is featuring Laurent-Perrier! So after having our fill of wines and wine education, our table was ready. We started our dinner with the first course - Geja's house salad. It was a nice light starter where the greens were dressed with a tangy Dijon vinaigrette. Shortly after, our second course arrived and the cheese fondue was heavenly. We had a pot of bubbly, creamy Swiss Gruyere cheese fondue set on our table, melted over an open flame. To enjoy with our cheese fondue, we also had a basket of assorted breads and fresh apples and grapes. y now, we were content and probably weren't ready for the feast in store. The third course came and we were presented with an amazing platter of fresh meats including aged beef tenderloin, delicate lobster tail, jumbo shrimp, plump Atlantic sea scallops and tender boneless chicken breast. They were all cut in bite sized pieces for us to easily cook in a table side pot of sizzling vegetable oil. Hot oil fondue was intimidating at first but Melissa and I soon got comfortable. Perhaps too comfortable lol because we were cooking things left and right. Granted, we may have lost a few things in the oil but we found them eventually and had fun fishing them out with our skewers! Oh, and did I mention the buffet of sauces we got to dip our succulent meats in after cooking? Sauces ranged from horseradish, apricot, garlic dill, teriyaki and a few more, eight in total. And of course, we balanced things out with a mountain of fresh vegetables including onion rings, broccoli, bell peppers, mushrooms, etc. Last and definitely not least, was the amazing dessert course. Geja's famous chocolate fondue is flamed table-side and presented with marshmallows for roasting, along with buttery pound cake, fresh strawberries, banana slices, pineapple and cherries. It certainly was a perfect ending to the meal and we both felt like a kid again simply for the opportunity to roast marshmallows over an open flame at the table! Now Geja's Café is known for being one of the most romantic restaurants in the city with their dim, soft lighting and flickering candles. There were certainly a fair share of love struck couples around us but at the same time, Geja's Café is also a great place for a night out with the girls or guys, which were also seen the night we dined there. If you think fondue was just a thing of the past or more of a retro dining experience, you really need to come out to Geja's Café to understand and experience fondue at its finest. With an extensive menu that's fun and delicious, as well as educational and insightful events such as their monthly Winemaker dinners, definitely check out what Geja's Café has to offer!

The meal started with a mixed green salad with a Dijon vinaigrette.  Next they brought out the cheese fondue with chunks of bread and fruit for dipping, so delicious.  That cheese would have been great on macaroni, i'll have to try duplicating that.  Following was the main course, I opted for the shrimp, beef and lobster platter which was amazing.  He chose the beef and chicken.  When they brought it out it looked like the veggies took over the plate and we were worried it wasn't enough meat. However it was the perfect portion, being that we already had cheese, bread, fruit and salad. Our server gave us great instructions on the time limit for cooking the different meats and veggies.  We had so much fun experimenting with the different meat/veggie/dipping sauce combinations.  Finally it was time for the chocolate fondue.  We enjoyed pound cake, rice crispy treats, pineapple, banana, strawberries, apples and marshmallows to dip in the chocolate.  To my surprise when i took the lid off of the chocolate pot, there was an engagement ring at the bottom!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  What a FABULOUS surprise.  Of course no chocolate was in the pot and later they switched the empty pot out for the chocolate.  Geja's Cafe is the perfect restaurant for such a grand occasion.  Hopefully we will be back for our 1 year anniversary.",0.9961,0.761,0.219,0.02,0.6083333333333332
2014-08-16,5.0,"Geja's is one of the few places that despite overwhelming popularity, hasn't lost its charm, become a cliché, and turned into a tourist-filled nightmare. Everything about Geja's is fantastic. It's fully deserving of every accolade and the high praise it regularly receives. The fondue is incredible. They have multiple types of cheese and dessert fondue, but I can only speak to the kind that comes with the standard three course fondue meal. Based on how good those are, I would assume all of their cheese and dessert fondue is great. They use high quality meats and veggies for the main course. It's fantastic. The ambience is perfect for a date. It's dark and relatively private with soft live music. Unlike what some have suggested, Geja's is not good for a first date. It's a too intimate, too dark, too expensive, and too time consuming (expect to be there at least two hours, not counting any wait time) to be ideal for a first date. The bartenders, hosts, and wait staff are all very friendly. They know the majority of guests are there celebrating something or for a romantic occasion, and they're very respectful of that. I really can't say enough good things about Geja's. People who complain about the prices are wrong. It's fondue. It's going to be more expensive than an average meal. If you don't already know that going in, blame yourself. The one and only downside to Geja's is the oil smell that permeates clothes and sticks with you after you leave. Whatever is worn there will need to be washed ASAP. Still, that's a small price to pay for the greatness that is Geja's.",0.9928,0.747,0.185,0.068,0.5754127579737334

I got the combo that included beef, chicken, scallops, 2 shrimp, and a couple hunks of lobster. The seafood was ruined, I overcooked it, and the lobster was first raw, then like rubber. Stick to the beef! The chocolate pot tasted more like Hershey's syrup than good quality chocolate. The cheese pot appetizer was good. I don't know what type of oil it is, but it's probably not super healthy to eat all your veggies and everything with oil. The sauces were fantastic, that is the only highlight of the meal.

2014-07-27,5.0,"It's been six years since my first review of Geja's and it's time I give it its well-deserved bump to five stars. This is a great spot for a date or double-date with friends you actually enjoy.  There's always quiet guitar music playing (sometimes from a live guitarist) and the lighting is dim, so it's sure to be an intimate evening. I've seen some people suggest this for a first date spot.  I disagree.  It's very dark and you should be able to see a first date clearly.  It's also very expensive and time-consuming.  A first date should be neither.  Save Geja's for an anniversary or a special occasion with someone you know is worth the experience. If you've never had fondue, the deal is that YOU handle the cooking.  Raw food is brought to your table, you skewer it with a long fork and dip it into molten cheese, oil or chocolate, depending on the course. Select your main course - filet mignon, chicken, veggies or seafood - and your fondue consultant handles the rest.  You can mix two meats and every choice comes with a ton of veggies. You start with delicious gruyere cheese fondue.  Apples, grapes and two kinds of bread await their cheesy, golden bath.  Outstanding. Then comes the main course.  You'll get the meat you selected, plus a ton of veggies and eight different dipping sauces.  Dill is the most amazing with any of the veggies - broccoli and mushrooms, especially.  Teriyaki is great with chicken or beef.  Garlic Butter is the bomb on potatoes.  BBQ works well with chicken or beef.  There's also a horseradish, a spicy aioli, a super-hot one with chili flakes and an apricot dip, too.  Sample everything! Your desert is a molten pot of chocolate.  Your server lights it on fire and you can make s'mores right there at your table!  (The fire goes out in about 90 seconds, so act quickly.)  When the fire is out, you can dip your marshmallows, rice krispy treats, cherries, shortcake, pineapple and banana in the chocolate.  It is amazing. I'm also a fan of their sangria - $32 for a carafe that works out to about 5-6 glasses. Geja's tends to be very expensive, but they *always* have Groupons, so check for that. WARNING: Because you're cooking with oil, you'll smell disgusting when you leave.  That's a small price to pay for a night of delicious fondue. In case you're curious how Geja's stacks up to its fondue rival, The Melting Pot, here's a handy cheat sheet... * Geja's is a place for dates, The Melting Pot is a place for friends. * Geja's uses an open flame, The Melting Pot uses in-table stovetop-style burners. * Geja's gives you several post-cooking sauces, The Melting Pot gives you different pre-cooking batters, but skimps on the sauces.",0.9568,0.852,0.098,0.05,0.6280941527608193

2014-07-23,5.0,"The reason I give this five stars is because it is simply the best Fondue Restaurant in America. I have been to places that are better, but they are all in France or Switzerland. So to eat here is a real treat (and a bargain if you add the airfare and hotel to eat Fondue in Europe). First, the ambiance is amazing. There is low lighting, candles, beautiful decor, and soft but lovely live music (usually classical or flamenco guitar).  If you are lactose intolerant or a vegan, there are things here for you to eat but my suggestion would to not come, because this place is all about great cheese. If there is a wait, you get cheese. Once you sit down, you get cheese. All through the meal, you get cheese. And the best of the best here is, shellfish, and excellent beef. Oh, and did I mention, also great cheese. This place blows the Melting Pot away. In fact, Geja's Cafe is like a success insurance policy: for friendly gatherings, impressive business meetings, and Romantic Dates. Especially Romantic Dates! There are a number of selections but the price margin is so slim that unless you are going get the chicken or cheese fondue by itself, you might as well spent the extra ten or twenty bucks per person and go for the big combo dinner. It includes a cheese Fondue, an oil or broth fondue, and a chocolate fondue for desert.  The cheese fondue is one of the best I have ever had... even compared to the ones in Europe. It is a perfect blend of Gruyère, Emmental de Savoie, and other amazing cheeses and then finished with a shot of Kirsch. It is divine. And you can do it like they do in Switzerland: let the cheese burn a little on the bottom and then ask the server to scrap the pot for you. You'll have a delicious crunchy chewy treat of crusted cheese: yum. The main fondue is an oil or broth fondue, served with cubes of beef and seafood, as well as assorted vegetables (in France they add Chacutarie, or sliced cured meats, but not at Geja's). The higher end orders offer better beef and also lobster and scallops. Your final course is the chocolate Fondue, which is a bubbling pot of chocolate/fudge liquid and a pile of fruit and cake to dip into it. If you are going here I suggest that you splurge on the best of the best. You probably won't come here every day so why not try their most successful offering. This is a fine evening. Geja's is located in the basement/lower lever of an old Lincoln Park town house on Armitage Avenue, in the heart of Lincoln Park. Take a stroll after dinner. The area is lively.

I believe you get apples, bread, and grapes with the cheese fondue. Just wasn't a fan of the cheese fondue. Next up is the main course with various veggies and various meats cooking in the boiling oil. You have to eat this not worrying too much about the fact that everything is cooking in hot oil. The plusses here for me were the variety in meats - steak, chicken, lobster, etc. and lots of veggies. Last is the dessert chocolate fondue which is really great.

From the aged cheeses in the fondue to the fresh, high quality meats, you cannot go wrong. I recommend getting the first item on the entree list which is a combination of all the meats. The scallops lobster and shrimp tasted so fresh without any fishy smell which indicates lack of freshness or quality. They were so tender that you could literally cut them with a spoon. The tenderloin and chicken were juicy and was just the right portion. There are also 8 sauces from melted garlic butter to creamy sriracha to dip your meats or vegetables into.     Geja's service is so attentive and the servers/waitstaff always have a smile on their faces.

That said, the presentation of the dishes was fantastic, and this was a great choice for a memorable bridal shower.  For a special occasion where you're looking for ambiance with some panache, this place is for you!  If you're a big foodie, however, there might be better options in the city--especially for the price.",0.976,0.839,0.161,0.0,0.6028571428571429

Services was fan-tastic.  Shannon was our accomodating, friendly and fun server.  Blake kept the wine flowing.  Management was fantastic and accomodating when we made a mistake in reserving a spot. The ambiance is kind of weird.  It's definitely a date spot, and I would guess not a date with your significant other...  The lighting is very dim and has a weird feeling, but our table was lively enough to make it less awkward.

Mainly done so by the glowing Google and Yelp reviews that were posted. It is only romantic in the way you can hear everyone's conversation in a few foot range. Also the waitstaff is inattentive and the gentleman at the valet parking had more charm.  Seriously, since I could hear every table in the restaurant, I heard the waiter have the SAME conversation with everyone, no deviation.  Also the food was about as good as any other fondue place. Great cheese and chocolate, but mediocre meat and vegetables. Really feel let down by the rave reviews and awards. I cannot get back my one year wedding anniversary dinner. Wish we had gone somewhere else. Hopefully this will help another couple peruse more options in Chicago. Also, do not expect them to be happy for you on your special event.

2014-05-26,3.0,"I returned here because my girlfriend really wanted to come back, and bought the groupon. Let me reiterate my previous review. If you are looking for cheese fondue, don't come here. The cheese fondue here is only an appetizer. If you want it to be the main course, or if you want to choose from cheeses other than Gruyere for your fondue, don't come here. I even asked if I could replace my main course with another round of cheese fondue, and I couldn't. If you want the cheese as only an appetizer, a main course where you cook your food yourself, and chocolate fondue dessert in a romantic atmosphere, come here. The setting is dark, there is a guitarist, and the wait staff is really good. The food is good, and you'll leave full. This place provides the full romantic dining experience, and it's great for that. If you're looking to enjoy a ton of cheese fondue, it's pretty bad for that.

2014-05-18,5.0,"My initial review of this place was not so good (it can be found below), but the manager took note of our dissatisfaction and sent us a gift card to give the restaurant another chance. Frankly, I'm glad we did because our second time around was much better and I wish this was our experience on our anniversary a month ago. I really appreciated the manager noticing our dissatisfaction and caring to make it right for us, because based on the popularity of the restaurant, I feel they easily could have ignored us as well.  We had a booth this time and our server, Shannon, was more energetic and friendly than our server from the first time. She did a great job of making us feel attended to and welcome and really, she alone made our experience 10x better. The food was great and Shannon made some very helpful suggestions on meat and sauce pairings that tasted wonderful together. After this experience we would definitely consider coming back for future special occasions.  I also have to add that the booth made a HUGE difference. It had a great ambiance, and actually had room for us to enjoy our meal without feeling squashed into a small table. The booths need to be specifically requested though before you get there, so thats just a tip for anyone coming here. My first review can be found below: ""Let me start out by saying that the food here was alright, and based on food alone I would give this place four stars. The service and lack of attention to issues ruined my anniversary experience though. Mainly, there was a LARGE BUG in my SALAD, and they didn't seem to care much.  My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate our two year anniversary here after hearing how romantic this place was. I made reservations two weeks in advance hoping to be seated in one of the romantic booths I heard about. Even though the hostess walked us past an open booth or two, we were seated under a large air conditioning unit, and they refused to give us another table.  My biggest issue was when i found a LARGE BUG WITH ANTENNA in my salad. It was dead and wrapped up in some of the lettuce. By large I mean about an inch and a half long and a quarter inch thick. The manager came by and apologized to me and promised that this never happened before and that she would make this right when we received our check. When we received our check though, they only took our drinks off, which totaled $30, and left our two meals on there. Since the issue wasn't with the drinks, I was just floored that they expected us to pay for my meal when there was a large bug in it.  They paid no attention to the fact that it was our anniversary, didn't care about our requests, and worst of all, didn't seem to care there was a BIG BUG IN my food. I was very disappointed after leaving, but at least the food was alright so it wasn't a total disaster..""",0.9967,0.71,0.193,0.097,0.47589285714285706

2014-05-16,5.0,"We had a great first experience here. We were excited to finally get to try Geja's by using a Groupon, and we like to celebrate special occasions at unique places like this. We weren't disappointed. The drive from Lombard, on a Thursday night, was an hour and a half! Yuck. (The drive home was only 40 minutes). We had a 6:00 reservation and were still 4 miles away at that time so we called and were told that they have a policy where they hold a table for 20 minutes but if we weren't there by then they couldn't guarantee our reservation and we'd have to see if we could get a table as a walk-in. It made sense but we had never been there and were worried we wouldn't make it and would have to drive back another time! Fortunately, we made it just in time. We apologized that we were late and explained that it took us longer than we expected and the kind young hostess said ""Believe, me, I know."" I think I thought ours was a unique experience but we were seated right by the hostess station and person after person who came to the restaurant said the same thing we did- it made me chuckle. Geja's is almost 49 years old! It's a small place with many tables. We were surprised that the tables weren't more private (we'd been to the Melting Pot before where it seems like there were mostly private booths). It's a beautiful place and I liked all the curly-q's in the decorations and light covers. The seating is tight and I was very impressed by all the servers and how aware they were when people were walking by to get to the bar or restrooms or to their tables- they were very gracious.  Our server was Mary and she had such a friendly face and demeanor- we really liked her and she gave us excellent service.  The Groupon was for two premier dinners which includes the cheese fondue, a small green salad with yummy/tangy dressing, your choice of meat/vegetable fondue, and then chocolate fondue. My husband loved the cheese fondue- it was his favorite part of the whole meal. I don't care for cheese so I just ate some of the bread (including pretzel bread- yay!), grapes, and apples in the basket. I chose the beef and chicken and my husband got the shrimp and chicken, and I liked how it was divided evenly on each side per person. It comes with 8 sauces and it was hard to remember what they each were but there was a dill, teriyaki, sweet and sour, garlic butter, chipotle, horseradish, and BBQ and something else. The meat also comes with a lot of vegetables like potatoes, onions, peppers, broccoli and mushrooms. The beef tenderloin was my favorite and I loved it with the teriyaki sauce. Both meats were very tender as you cook it yourself. The onions were also surprisingly good. My husband especially enjoyed the mushrooms. Like other people shared, the food kept falling off the skewers into the oil and we had to dig them out but that was part of the fun. We had decaf coffee with the chocolate fondue- they brought whipped cream to put in it- WOW- my new favorite thing! The coffee was delicious and went so well with the dessert course. The chocolate fondue was great. Getting to toast our marshmallows in the flame was fun- and they were the best taste of the night- warm roasted gooey marshmallows in chocolate and graham cracker crumbs - yum! There were strawberries, bananas, apples, fresh pineapple, marshmallows, rice kris pie treats, and pound cake. It was all really good but I think I prefer darker chocolate for fondue- it was missing a ""bite"", in my opinion.  The service was great and always right on time- our waters were filled frequently and Mary and the other workers were courteous and helpful. There was live guitar music and it was fantastic!!! We regretted not having the chance to tell the musician how much we enjoyed it. It was perfect. The women's restroom (only for one person) was very pretty and quite large, but my husband said the men's room was quite cramped. The valet service was well worth the $10 (plus tip).  We appreciated getting to eat at our own pace and thoroughly enjoyed all our food, the ambiance, the excellent service and finally getting to experience such a great restaurant- it felt really special.",0.9997,0.729,0.247,0.024,0.6218365925262478

Loved the whole experience. The service and food were impeccable. We were a little early for our reservation, so we stood by the bar and ordered a drink. Standing there wasn't much fun because that space is super tiny, felt like I was in the way of the employees and guests on their way to the bathroom. But all was better when we sat at a table at the bar when it opened up. Shortly after we were seated, right at our reservation time if I might add. Environment is dark, small and snug, so prepare to be close to people. However, we were celebrating a birthday and being that it was our first time visiting, we asked to be moved to a booth when we were sat directly next to another couple. I was pretty able to touch elbows with her. Lol. We were told to wait and low and behold... they were able to accommodate us! We were so pleased. The booth was absolutely spacious. Our server was Mark and he was absolutely great. He let me sample a wine because I was undecided on which to order. The bus boy was just as great. Very attentive and courteous. All and all, I will definitely be returning.  Ps. We ended up getting valet that the restaurant offers. Highly recommend. It was only $10 for cars (a little higher for bigger vehicles).

2014-04-17,1.0,"I would like to write about the Winemaker's Dinner Program. In the past this once a month event cost $55.00 to INCLUDE tax and gratuity, As the offer stated - this was a good deal! This year they have raided the price to $60 ++tax and gratuity and STILL want to call it a good deal! Are you kidding? So last year $55.00 bottom line for a GREAT evening. This year it is $60 + $6 + $11 = $77.00 each! People - that is a FORTY PERCENT INCREASE IN PRICE! You cannot use a groupon or any other coupon for this event so they are just getting 40% more this year than last. Why would you want to pay that? Think about it - just go - whenever, with a groupon and here is what you will pay: 2 premier dinners say $50 each and a $35 bottle of wine. So $135 + $13 + $24 = $172 MINUS THE GROUPON value of $93 =  $79 for 2 as opposed to the $154 total for 2 at the winemaker's dinner! Clearly - have ANOTHER bottle of wine and you are still ahead! I cannot imagine how this place can survive without groupons bringing their ridiculous menu prices back to earth! Just look at what you actually get and add up the actual value: a small salad with only a couple of cucumber slices over lettuce, a basket of a slice or 2 of bread, a couple apple pieces and some grapes to dip in a cup of cheese, a platter of cheap vegetables with maybe 6 oz of meat or even less if seafood plus 8 containers of dipping sauces, then finally the chocolate fondue served with some fruit and other dipping offerings. I estimate ALL THAT to COST Geja's maybe $20 for 2. They also charge around $30 for a $10 bottle of wine. So their total cost for a meal you paid $172 for is $30.00!! OH, I forgot they will give you a cup of coffee too!  If you absolutely must have fondue - then go here and pay the price.

Our server suggested a wine for us, the cheese fondue was fabulous, we ordered the Beef, Scallops and Shrimp for an entree and all three were amazing, along with the veggies of course.  We were so stuffed after the cheese fondue and the main course... but then the dessert comes!  Chocolate fondue with fruits, cake and marshmallows. OH MY GOD... fabulous.  We were SO full and slightly uncomfortable when we left..   Alot of the reviews seem to think the prices are high but for a three course meal at $43-58 pp in the city; I dont think its too crazy.  We did have the Groupon so that took $84 off the total bill.  IF we didnt order the $45 bottle of wine our total wouldve only been about $40.  Next time its on Groupon I will def purchase again!",0.9299,0.893,0.084,0.023,0.5936684303350971
2014-03-24,3.0,I decided to check this place out due to the many positive reviews and the awesome Groupon deal. So the positives...we left stuffed and there was so much food left over from each course. The white sangria was delicious! The waiters and hostess were great. They have free coat check. Very romantic setting with live violinist the night we were there. They do have valet parking which is nice since parking in this area is tough especially on a weekend. The negatives..be sure to book way in advance if you want to go on a weekend.  Without the Groupon totally over priced. The place jams so many tables into one space it was almost like family style! Not a lot of menu options and they make you cook your food in oil not the healthiest option.  I would go back again but only when they have another awesome Groupon deal!,0.9701,0.826,0.166,0.008,0.604212580348944
2014-03-24,1.0,"I received a groupon of geja's cafe as a gift and decided to take my mom, my sister and my cousin there last night. It was my second time there, the first time I wasn't really impressed but since I had this gift I thought we can check it out again. The groupon deal was for 4 Premier Fondue Dinners. At first when the waitress described how we can use the groupon we were surprised because 4 Premier Fondue Dinners is too much food for 4 ladies that are not big eaters. But we decided to order anyway. Right then we noticed that my menu prices are about 2-3$ less than other people at the table. When the waitress comes to get our order, I told her that the menus are not the same and how she is going to charge us? She said she needs to talk with her manager. Not long after she left the manager came by and without saying sorry or anything she started to rip the menu to pieces and while she was doing it she said this was an error and this menu is not usable. She didn't even say SORRY. I said I would expect you charge me based on that prices I saw on the menu you gave me when I sat at the table. and she said (in a very rude way) I will only charge you based on the price in the wrong menu and everyone else on the table will be charge based on correct prices and she immediately left the table. We were sooooo disappointed at her behavior. We decided to leave the dinner and I walked at the front desk and told her: ""it was very rude that you ripped out the menu in front of us. You could just explained the situation in a nice way and apologize and leave. She said: ""I know you were not happy about the fact that you need to order 4 Premier Fondue Dinners so that's ok!!!!!!!!!""  I was even more disappointed from her response. What is the relationship between this two???????????? We were ready to order the food anyway.... so she thought she can make us unhappier by ripping out the menu!!!!!!! I am so disappointed and confused of her reaction and her explanation. so rude. I will never go back. .",-0.989,0.828,0.048,0.124,0.5295535714285715
2014-03-22,5.0,"This is such a cool place! My step mom and dad surprised me with a birthday dinner here. Along with my husband, the 4 of us had a great time.  When we went on a Saturday night it was VERY busy and we had a reservation but still ended up waiting about 15 minutes after our reservation time. We had a good seat at the bar, some great mojitos, and awesome company so it was all good.  Once seated our waiter explained the menu options(although we did have to clarify a bit). But it's pretty simple. You dip stuff in melted cheese to start(amazing). You cook your choice of meat, seafood and vegetables in hot oil. Then to finish you dip things in chocolate for dessert. This was my first time ever doing fondue and I managed not to burn my tongue too badly or stab my self terribly with the cool little food skewers.  I definitely recommend the aged beef tenderloin, and the red sangria.  But all of it was good. I can see where this would be a great place for a date. As a group we had a great time cooking our food and occasionally fishing things out of the molten hot oil.  The waiter told us to cook the beef for 3 minutes in the oil. I think 3 minutes will give you a nice medium rare. So if you prefer well done, I'd go for 4 minutes. Try not to leave the potatoes in too long because they do disintegrate. The other veggies do much better in the oil(not that I'm arguing with fried potatoes). Also, all the sauces they offer(8 I believe) were great. My favorite was the spicy aioli. And dessert...wow. The waiter brought out our chocolate fondue and set it on fire so we could roast marshmallows over it. I had mine burnt to a crisp(just the way I like it). Also enjoyed the strawberries dipped in chocolate and rolled in  graham cracker crumbs.  The whole experience left me wanting to work fondue into at least one meal a day.",0.9961,0.737,0.206,0.057,0.608253968253968

2014-03-15,1.0,I agree with what the two reviewers said about their experience with this business and groupon. I called looking to make a reservation and everything just happened to be booked up for weeks. I finally got a reservation about five weeks out and not at a prime time. I got the distinct impression that no reservations were available sooner  only because I mentioned I would be using a groupon and that had I been using cash there would have been dates available sooner. So finally five weeks later my friend and I dine at Gejas. We both were disappointed with the food which we found just so-so but we were more disappointed with the service. Again it appeared as if we were second class customers because we were using a groupon. If the idea behind a company offering a groupon is to woo new customers Gejas certainly failed.

For dinner, I went with the seafood supreme option and loved cooking all my seafood and veggies in the oil. But again, even with the great assortment of dipping sauces, it was just fine. So-so. Dessert was also fine - not bad, but not great. Melty chocolate and plenty of marshmallows, pound cake and fruit to dip in. (Rice krispie treats too.)  Overall, it was fine.

2014-03-09,4.0,"Amazing food, attentive service, great experience! Pros: The food. Everything we had with the premier dinners was delicious and fresh, and the variety of sauces that came with the entrees were all delicious. But the chocolate fondue at the end... Oh man. What I wouldn't do for that chocolate fondue.   The experience. I have never had fondue before, so it was great fun to be able to cook our own food at the table. My date and I opted to use both oil and broth, which was nice because the broth gave us a healthier option but was just as delicious. The service. All of the staff whom we interacted with were top notch. Our waitress was very nice and friendly, and explained how to do everything since we had never had fondue before. The busboys were also on top of things and made sure we never waited long for our next course, or for more water.  Cons: The only major thing I disliked was the darkness of the place. We came at night and had a corner table, which we soon realized was the darkest table in the whole restaurant. This made reading the menu extremely difficult, and at the end of the night my eyes felt a bit tired from having to strain to see everything. We also had to pull out our cell phones to use as a timer when cooking our food, since we couldn't see it well enough to know when it was ready to be taken out of the oil/broth. Our waitress did give us a little flashlight to use, but I would have preferred to not need a flashlight at all! Also, the place does leave a bit of an oily smell on your clothes, which was not a big deal for me, but just something to be aware of. Consensus: Our whole experience at Gejas was fantastic and the food was amazing! Definitely recommend (with a groupon though, if you're on a budget!).",0.9893,0.777,0.161,0.061,0.6475396825396824

If you arrive early, sit at the bar in the back. Get a drink (I recommend the white sangria)  and have some cheese and crackers. Just be careful not to fill up.  One last tip I have... If you tend to be a messy eater like me, don't wear a shirt you care about. Both times I've been, I've spilled oil and other sauces on my shirt. If you tend to them right away, you can salvage your shirt but it's still a pain.

2014-02-23,4.0,"I have been using Groupon for quite some time and love it. We have enjoyed many restaurants  and outings that we probably would not have known about or thought of visiting had it not been for purchasing a Groupon. That being said, I just had my first bad experience.   I purchased a Groupon for Geja's Cafe for four premier dinners for four people (up to $167.80 value). A Groupon for four people should generally feed four people for the price listed on the Groupon. It states a value of up to $167.80, but the only thing those four people could eat for that amount is a boneless chicken breast or tofu and fresh vegetable medley.  This Groupon was very misleading. Had it said that I was buying a Groupon with a value of  $167.80, that would have been fine. I would have known that whatever the bill came to, they would deduct $167.80. But this Groupon said that it was for four premium dinners for four people. My anticipated cost when I used it was for the drinks, tax, and tip.  While the food was very good, I could not enjoy the experience knowing how much more I was going to have to pay at the end of the meal. Our server, Horacio, was also not very friendly and had a very strong accent. After he explained what we needed to do and walked away, I asked the rest of my group what he said and none of us totally understood him. When he returned and we asked him to explain it again, he just said, ""all of you just pick what you want"".  When our first course was done and the utensils were taken, we were left without a knife for our main course. When he brought the items for the chocolate fondue, he put a marshmallow on each of our skewers, but in doing so, he dropped two on the table. He took them, but did not bring us two more. I liked the food and therefore would recommend this restaurant. Just know that if you buy a Groupon for the restaurant, it will not cover the cost of four meals as it infers. I also hope you don't get Horacio as your server.",0.9641,0.871,0.09,0.039,0.562937062937063
2014-02-22,4.0,"Dark and romantic - Two things you will need for sparks to fly. All you need is BYOD (Bring Your Own Date). The magic will happen pending you don't screw it up because Gaja's Café will set the stage for you. Do not be afraid to arrive earlier than your reservation. There is a small bar in the back with massive wine selection that matches the complementary cheddar cheese and crackers while you wait. Warning - the cheddar cheese is addictive! As soon as your table is ready, they will call you over. The small bites and the many dipping sauces from the fondue selections will add up quick and you WILL become full fast. Keep this in mind when ordering because you MUST save room for dessert. Gaja's Café will keep the pace going and they will not rush you at all. They will even take the time to tell you how to fondue so you do not have to be an expert to impress your date. A couple of things you need to be aware of though. It is dark which maybe a good thing for Gaja's Café. Gaja's Café uses hot cooking oil for their fondue and the oil is all over the walls. Since it is so dark, you cannot see it. If you dare, flash one of the table candles along the wall. Secondly, it is a small place and avoid if you do not do well in cramped places.

My Mom was a huge fan and even prepared it as 'Christmas dinner' for my family most years. She got the idea/her passion for it from Geja's itself after visiting it many many years before I was born even. To me this restaurant represents my family tradition and I will never forget my first time getting to eat here as an adult.  Geja's never disappoints. I mean really how could it? Romantic ambiance, live music, great times! Make sure to request a booth! If you're coming here, go all out: pick a platter option with a wide variety of things you love (I'm a fan of the Prince Geja one which literally comes with a little of everything) that includes the beginning cheese fondue and ending desert. Plenty of veggies and delicious sauces will be provided as well! The food is always very fresh and their aged beef is so amazing and tender. Geja's own brand of red wine is also very, very good and definitely worth getting a bottle for the table as well! Final Verdict: I will forever be a fan, supporter, and overall enthusiast of Geja's because it's more than just a restaurant to me - it's a tradition! Good for small groups or just with your partner.

2014-02-04,4.0,"Stopped in during restaurant week. Im surprised this place is soo small. It really does seem like a fire hazard.. but they have been in the same location for years, so I guess Im just worrying too much.  Just so you know.. I have a phobia of fire. So.. if you do too.. this place may not be for you... I had to drink a lot of wine to be able to stay in this restaurant. The restaurant is situated in a wine cellar. Its VERY dark; lit only by dark red lights and candles. Its really hard to see what you are eating. The restaurant week deal was pretty much their regular menu at a discounted rate.  We had the cheese appetizer, dinner, and chocolate fondu dessert. The cheese is delicious. The fondu pot is positioned in the middle of your table and they give you breads and fruits to dip. The main course is your choice. I choose beef and chicken, others in my group tried beef, chicken, and seafood. The raw meats come out on a big platter along with various fresh vegetables (broccoli, mushroom,s peppers, potatoes, and onions).  A fondu pot with boiling oil is turned on and you dip your food in there to cook it.  This is where I think a little light would help. The chicken has to cook for about 3-4 minutes. Id like to be able to look and see if its pink.. but that wasn't really an option. TIP: We used the timers on our cell phones. They give you tips on what to put in and how long as well.  Everything was delicious. When the dessert came I almost passed out. They put liquor on top of the chocolate in the fondu part and light it on fire so that you can roast marshmallows. It was VERY difficult for me to be that close to a burning fire.  After the alcohol burnt off I was able to enjoy the chocolate.. which was delicious. It included pound cake, marshmallows and various fruits for dipping. All in all, Im glad I went. The dinner was very good and I (sort of) conquered my fear. I can't say if I will go back. Everything was soo good.. it was just a lot for me to deal with. TIP: dont wear a coat that you need for everyday use. Because of all the fondu frying.. you smell like frying when you leave.

2014-01-25,3.0,The concept of this restaurant is great. It's a romantic way to share food with someone. I give them that. But it's overly small and the tables are crammed in. It's dimly lit which I understand goes with the romantic atmosphere but its overly dark. We were told to pull the chicken out of the fondue when it was golden brown. We couldn't see it to tell if it was golden brown or not. The food was good for what it is. The cheese fondue was our favorite and you get lots of veggies with your meats. The dessert fondue was lacking I feel.  The reason other than being in the dark at a tight table that I gave gejas a three was our server. We were greeted right away but she did not come take our drink order for over ten mins. She acted like she was waiting on us to be ready. The tables beside us that sat down after us got their drinks and food first.  I had asked if they could surprise my gf for our anniversary and she was kind enough to bring out complimentary champagne but when we went to pay she ruined it by saying just so you know we don't normally do this so if you come in again please don't expect this to happen. Why would I expect it to always happen??  If you want to try a new place it's worth it but its not something you will dash to every month.,0.9892,0.813,0.166,0.021,0.49692784992785

I've been to other fondue establishments before and paid the same prices and got much more and better food. We got the international and the consuuser and for $48-$52 per menu we thought it was a rip off to get 4 pieces of chicken, 3 pieces of beef, and 2 shrimp with a shared dessert, shared bread, and so forth. You're essentially paying nearly $120 for 2 pieces of cut up bread, 20 grapes, a cut up apple, 1 chicken breast (divided in half among 2 dinners), 1 steak (divided in half among two dinners), and 2 shrimp per person. Along with about half of an inch of melting chocolate with 4 marshmellows, 6 strawberries, and 1 cut up rice krispy treat. I'm sorry to say but melting pot gives you way more food, each person gets their own bread starter and their own dessert and  you get much more meat for the price.

2013-11-27,5.0,"I doubt there is any place more romantic than this in Chicago! I loved my first time at Geja's for our 2 year anniversary on November 12, 2013. It was so memorable and so special.  When I made the reservation online they asked if there was any special occasion for the meal and I noted it was our anniversary. When we arrived the hostess seated us promptly and congratulated us on our anniversary, and so did our server- who also put a rose on our table and an anniversary card! It was so sweet and thoughtful.  Geja's atmosphere is romantic. The lighting is low, we had a small booth with Indian decor or mosaics on the walls and curtains on either side of the booth seats. The table was lit by candles and low lighting above us and we had a view of the small stage where a guitarist placed live acoustic classical guitar. Our server was gentlemanly and lovely, and was very aware of what we needed (like advice on how to cook and do fondue for our first time) and aware when we wanted moments alone. The aisles and booths are a bit small, and there is a lot going on on the tabletop, but overall we were comfortable.  The food is pricy but so worth it. I am hooked on fondue now! We started with a light red wine recommended by our server for the meals we'd be having, a Geja's house wine, and a house salad. We then had an appetizer consisting of Imported Gruyere cheese blended with white wine, Kirsch cherry brandy, and spices. We dipped red and golden apple wedges, sweet grapes, French, pumpernickel and pretzel breads.  For the entree's I chose the CONNOISSEUR with beef tenderloin, jumbo shrimp, and lobster tail. My SO chose the Prince Geja's Combination with beef tenderloin, lobster tail, jumbo shrimp, Atlantic sea scallops and boneless chicken breast. Along with the meats a tray of raw veggies like potato, onion, mushrooms, zucchini, red, green, and yellow peppers, You cook the meat and veggies at the table in hot oil on skewers.

It is flamed with orange liqueur and served with strawberries, apples, banana, pineapple, graham cracker crumbs, pound cake, and marshmallows for roasting.

2013-11-26,5.0,"It is always a treat when we go to Geja's!  It 's a lovely combination of fun, romance and delicious food. The basic dinners are three courses, cheese, main - with proteins and veggies and dessert.  They have some add-ons listed on the menu but the meal is so filling I don't know how anyone would have room for more. The cheese course is good but probably my least favorite.  Lots of gooey cheese with bread and fruit dippers.  For the main course you have a choice of different combinations of proteins. While I love lobster I do tend to stay away from it here.  It is very hard to get it cook properly in the oil, so I generally stick to the steak and shrimp combo.  The main course comes with plenty of veggies like peppers, potatoes broccoli, onions and  mushrooms.  They give you so many sauces for dipping.  It definatley depends on my mood as to which is my favorite.  This last time it was the chipolte aioli.  For dessert, of course it's chocolate fondue!  They start with helping you to toast marshmallows to make a s'more tasting bite.  Then onto the real chocolate dipping with fruits, pound cake and rice krispie treats.  On my most recent visit the waitress asked us if we wanted any additional items for dipping.  We mentioned that we really like the pound cake.  She told us that the center pieces  were favorite and asked if we wanted her to bring us some.  We took her up on the offer and the center pieces were fantastic.  It was so nice of her to do that for us! On occasion when we come and we want to splurge a little, we order a wine pairing to go along with the meal.  It's fun to do and complements the meal well.

Anyway, we were going to be in the city on a random Tuesday so we decided to finally give Geja's a try. I'll be honest, I actually REALLY REALLY love fondue. Like, I own 3 fondue pots and I go to The Melting Pot for my birthday every year. So I had high expectations of Geja's, one of Chicago's ""most romantic restaurants"" and allegedly home to awesome fondue. Maybe I would even like it better than my beloved Melting Pot? Well... no. When you walk in, the place smells like an old person's house. And grease. We had a reservation but were asked to wait in the awkward little waiting area for a while. First course, cheese fondue. They bring it out pre-melted and it tastes like crap. After a few bites, I figured out what crap it specifically tastes like- jarred Alfredo sauce. Ewww. It has a definite fake processed cheesy flavor. I did like the dressing on the salad, though. The main entree: hmm. At first I thought the portions looked a bit small, but it's actually just that the various meats were cut into REALLY HUGE sizes so there were only a couple pieces of each. This made it difficult to control the cooking times. We had some scallops on the plate and as soon as they were cooked we realized something was wrong... The REEKED of ammonia. This is what happens when seafood decomposes and it means the fish is not fresh and is, in fact, going bad. The ""unobtrusive"" service meant that we had to wait 15+ minutes to get them replaced with some shrimp (and that was after we asked another server to get out waitress). The dessert fondue was good- I liked how they set the liqueur on fire so you can roast the marshmallows before digging in to the chocolate. It's a cute touch. The bill (before our expired groupon was applied for face value and before tip) was about $125 for two four-course dinners and two glasses of sangria, which is about what I'd expect.

2013-10-25,2.0,"My expectations were not met. I was pretty excited to check out Gejas, as it is known to be one of the ""most romantic"" restaurants in the city.  My expectations were quickly brought down from the start.  First off, I felt like I was walking into someone's garden apartment or basement. It smelled like a combination of basement mustiness and rancid oil.  It was also pretty dark inside, which is probably why people think it's romantic.  I truly don't find a dimly lit dungeon without a view, a few candles lit and tables set side by side of each other very romantic. That's just me though.  The food itself is undistinguishable at best.  For starters, I ordered the cheese fondue.  It was okay, but nothing amazing.  As a main course, I ordered The International, which consisted of aged beef tenderloin, jumbo shrimp, and boneless chicken breast.  Again, it was okay, but definitely not worth the almost $50 for food I have to cook myself.   Not to mention having to worry about the possibility of coming down with salmonella from undercooked chicken.  For dessert, I ordered the flaming chocolate fondue.  This was probably the best item out of everything I ate that night.   One thing to add (especially for ladies), be  careful with what you wear.  I wore a nice dress and it was ruined by all the splattering grease.  Very annoying to say the least.  Overall, I really think this is an overrated place.  Not only do you come out smelling like grease, but the prices are ridiculous for what you're getting.  With two glasses of wine, an appetizer, two entrees and dessert, the bill came out to over $200.  Seriously?  Kudos to whoever owns this restaurant.  They really have a good thing going.  From word of mouth to reading the reviews, people seem to be hypnotized thinking this is the best place ever.  My guess is that it's either herd mentality, bad taste, a high intake of alcohol or a combination of some or all that dictate the high ratings.",0.9426,0.769,0.138,0.093,0.5483994708994709

2013-10-20,5.0,"Came here with a Groupon, but can honestly say will probably go again paying full price.  The place is super romantic: dimly lit with nice (not tacky) decorations, and we sat in a semi-private booth by the window (it was raining outside, which made it extra nice).  The service was great: the server took care of us while being very discrete and professional. I really hate it in the US when a server comes and interrupts your conversation (or worse, catches you while you're chewing your food) to ask how it's going.  The food was delicious, balanced and a lot of it. For around $45 each (no booze) we each got  1) appetizer salad - pretty standard mixed green salad, but with house made dressing that was tasty 2) cheese fondue with fruit and various breads 3) main course. This is cook-it-yourself on a pot, kind of like a chinese hot pot style but where a pot has oil instead of water in it. The main course consisted of your choice of meat (obviously seafood/beef costs more than chicken) and a bunch of veggies that you deep fry yourself 4) dessert: chocolate fondue with marshmellows, fruit, rice crispy treats and other goodies to dip. The fondue is lit on fire at the beginning, so you have a couple of minutes to make smores before it goes out.  By the time the thing was over we had been there for 2.5 hours, and were pretty full although not over the top. The only downside: the place smells heavily of fried oil, and it gets in your clothes. That doesn't subtract from the romantic atmosphere though.  5 stars!",0.9845,0.787,0.149,0.064,0.5599537037037038

It was surprisingly busy on a Wednesday evening. Our waitress was great. She checked on us every so often. The bus boys kept our waters constantly filled.  We started off with the Gourmet Board. It was good, but nothing unique. For the fondue dinners, I had the Connoisseur and my friend had the beef tenderloin with chicken. The salad and cheese fondue were both good.  I loved that the oil we cooked the food in didn't  transfer any flavor into the meats and veggies and it didn't seem greasy. The dipping sauces were really good. My favorites were the BBQ and sriracha aioli.  My friend loved the chocolate fondue. It came with marshmallows, fruits, rice krispy treats, and pound cake. The chocolate was slightly dark which I enjoyed.  By the time we finished everything, we were so full! Def had a nice time there :)",0.9947,0.743,0.251,0.006,0.6600000000000001
2013-10-03,5.0,"Hey you -- looking for a super romantic restaurant? One full of candles, low-lighting, softly playing music, curtains, private booths, sexy ambiance? Try Gejas.  I've been here 5-6 times and every time, it's been super romantic. I've used a Groupon twice and they are so not snooty about it. However, don't be fooled thinking you'll just use your Groupon -- with the romantic vibe, you'll probably end up ordering a bottle... or two.. of wine and all of a sudden, you've got a high bill again. The first course of cheese and bread/fruit is probably my favorite course. The cheese is soft and full of flavor. The pairings match the cheese perfectly and I always end up eating way too much.  I've tried a lot of different options for the second course, but the tofu/vegetables is my go-to. I've tried their meats as well, and while they're great, tofu and vegetables seems a bit lighter after I've downed all the cheese and bread in round 1. The second course comes with 8 different sauces, so no matter if you're into spicy, sweet, or salty -- you've got plenty of dipping options.  Dessert is also fantastic -- chocolate fondue with marshmallows, graham crackers, fruit, and oh geeze... just amazingness. It never fails - I always eat too much in round 1 and 2 to full appreciate the dessert course. Dang you, big eyes! So while this is a super romantic place, I've never left feeling like I haven't just gained 5 pounds. It's one of those places where your stomach is literally pushing against your clothing! And not to mention, you'll definitely smell like food. Your clothes, your hair, your skin. But it's worth it. Honestly, the food is good, but the ambiance is what keeps me coming back. It's so romantic and cozy. You feel like it's just you and your date. It's the best. Make sure to grab a reservation before coming -- if not, you may end up waiting. The last time I went, I didn't make a reservation and was politely shown to the bar in the back. My date and I grabbed a table near the bar and sipped on wine until our table was ready. So put on your pretty dress and go!",0.9971,0.753,0.209,0.038,0.4892149758454107
2013-10-02,4.0,"After hearing rave reviews about Geja's from my friends, my husband and I were quick to snatch up a Groupon and check it out for ourselves. The previous reviews are spot on: the space is small, dimly lit, and smells strongly of oil. Somehow, it still manages to be very romantic...the decor and the live Spanish guitar music help the ambiance. Our server was bubbly and helpful, and promptly brought us our wine, salads, and Gruyere cheese fondue. Salads were okay - slightly underdressed, actually, and I am I'm pretty conservative with my dressing application. The cheese fondue was possibly my favorite part of the meal...sharp, creamy, and flavored with white wine, it went perfectly with the bread and fruit. I want some now and it's not even 8 am. For our main course, my husband and I decided to go all out, ordering Prince Geja's Combination and the Deluxe Seafood, respectively. I've done oil fondue before, but it had been awhile, and I forgot how much EFFORT it is, constantly having to keep in mind how long your scallop and pepper have been in the oil, balancing your enjoyment of dinner with a skewer plan so you're not sitting with an empty plate for four minutes while you wait for a potato to cook. You can't do this shit drunk, y'all. Dessert was predictably delicious. I enjoyed roasting my marshmallows over the flambéed chocolate fondue. No surprises here. I do have a couple minor complaints: the dim lighting made it very difficult to determine whether our meat was cooked all the way, so we just kinda had to cross our fingers on that one. Also, we were seated at one of the freestanding tables in the middle rather than in a booth, which was not the most conducive for a private conversation. Overall though, we had a lovely time and will probably be back for a special occasion dinner. Just be prepared to empty your wallet (yes, even with a Groupon) and leave smelling like oil (and maybe wearing a few drops). Also, if you do the three-course dinner, you will be too full to (ahem) feel like doing much else for the rest of the evening. Plan accordingly. ;)",0.9776,0.801,0.138,0.061,0.45301771871539315

The only nitpick I had was with the sauces: none of them seem particularly good for seafood. I was surprised by how full I was at the end of the meal, even though the entrees didn't seem that big in portion. At regular price perhaps a bit steep, so take advantage of their deals.

The food is incredible and we will get to that soon, but if money is no object then yes, this is a five star place.  That said, if you joint their email list they send you some pretty great coupons, so I end up here more often than I would expect (given my budget). Geja's is a tiny dark little place that's cute and cozy and very cave-like. Think intimate. It's very nice. They usually have a Spanish-looking dude playing the guitar, it's a classy joint! The service is typically prompt and the servers keep the place running like an extremely well-oiled machine. I like it. It's a fondue place. Do the premier dinner, it doesn't make sense to do anything else.  First course : basic salad, mustard vinegarette. I'm a big fan, my mom usually skips it.  Second course : the cheese fondue. Grapes, pumperknickle bread, white bread, apples. The cheese fondue is heavenly. It's hard to watch it be taken away when you are finished. I could honestly just live on the cheese fondue indefinitely. Once I start diving into this stuff, I completely forget that there are delicious steaks and seafood up next-- all I can see is the light, fluffy, melty cheese surrounding my luscious grapes and oooooooooohhhhh.... Third course : oh yeah, we ordered actual food. Steak, shrimp, lobster, scallops. Forget about the scallops; they're fresh and everything but the steak, shrimp, and lobster are better suited to the pot of boiling oil thing. The steak is tender. The shrimps are big and flavorful. The potatoes get nice and crispy when you fry them. Oh yes, life is good. Fourth course : chocolate fondue. This is why you really came here and everyone knows it. They top the chocolate with some Grand Marnier then bombs away. It's encouraged at this point that you toast your marshmallow over the Grand Marnier flame engulfing your chocolate, and that is when you truly understand how lucky you are to be an American. Yes please.  When the flame dies out, you have all sorts of delicious dessert things to dunk into your fancy chocolate. It's divine. You're full. Who cares? Your stomach was made for this moment.

If you want a plate of food to show up at your table and you go to town stuffing your face, this is not the place for you. But, if you want to sit, relax, enjoy a glass of wine and eat at your own pace, then check it out. As for what to order, having ""fondued"" a number of times you learn NOT to get the cheese, meat AND chocolate. You will literally explode from over consumption. Stick with cheese and chocolate and you won't go wrong. And at $22 per person, it's a deal. I'm sure adding the meat will bring the price way up, especially if what other reviewers are saying is true and they give you seafood.  They also have a very nice selection of wines in a variety of price points. You can look like a hero and still get a decent bottle of vino for $30. Try that at any other Lincoln Park restaurant. Good luck. At the end of the day if you go with cheese and chocolate and get a reasonably priced bottle of wine, you can expect to spend $35-$40 per person. if you compare that to going to the movies and buying stale popcorn and a flat soda to watch the latest Hollywood dud versus spending a bit more to sit across from your partner and actually talk (there's no TV's and the place is set up for intimate conversation) I think it's a steal.",0.9765,0.841,0.132,0.027,0.6042397660818714

I came here last week with my boyfriend for a romantic night out.  We made reservations for 830, showed up about 820.  The host said it would be a few minutes, that there was only one couple ahead of our reservation and to have a seat at the bar.  We grab a few glasses of wine and a seat at the bar.  And waited.  We watched not one (like the host said), but multiple (like 8 couples) get sat, while we waited.  It was after 9pm before we finally got a table (this was a Wednesday, btw). Seating is very cramped (I requested a booth, but it was unavailable) so we were seated at a table in a corner, basically on top of the couples next to us.  We were given water promptly, and again waited.  We looked over the menu and picked out our entrees.  The waitress arrived about 20 minutes after we sat down to introduce herself/take our order.  We were both newbies when it came to fondue/Geja's, and we never received an explanation of what to expect, what came with each dinner, nada.  We literally said I think we'll both have the Geja's combo, she wrote it down and ran off.  I'm not sure how spacing is supposed to work, but a couple sat down next to us (after we already ordered our meal) and was greeted within 5minutes, got a full explanation of the fondue experience, and recommendations.  They ordered about 10minutes later, but still received their first course before us. (At this point, I was pretty much unimpressed as far as service). Food: Cheese course -can anyone really hate melted cheese? (this is a trick question).  Entree- we both ordered the Prince Geja's combo and maybe it's just me, but I felt sick by the end of it.  You're expected to stick raw vegis and meats into a crock of oil. Then to add flavor, you dip it into the sauces provided.  If it weren't for the different textures of the meats, I honestly couldn't tell you the difference between the chicken and the lobster (which seems like a sin if you enjoy good seafood).  Dessert- I believe this is the reason why this place consistently gets good recs.  You kind of forget the middle portion of the meal, you're tipsy from all the wine you're drinking at dinner, and then someone plops down a bowl of chocolate and suddenly you're dining at a 5star restaurant.

2013-08-13,4.0,"Great dining experience, a restaurant with staying power must be doing something right and from my one time eating here, they did right by me.  Pressure was on a little bit as this was the Significant Other's b-day but they came through. Had a reservation and used a groupon which is a great deal here.  Seems lots of folks work that action.  Our server Shannon was very amiable and attentive, and did a great job of explaining the fondue ins and outs.   Food? It's really good melted cheese (Gruyere) on fruit! What's not to like there? Main course was the most challenging for me personally, you have to wait a while for the meat to cook in the oil, no instant gratification, but I dealt with it.   Dessert is more fruit and goodies to dip in melted chocolate.  Again, what is not to like there people?   I would definitely come back to Geja's and would definitely make sure I used the groupon.  Oh yeah, no TV's in Geja's which is a bonus as far as I am concerned.",0.9874,0.726,0.213,0.061,0.5721877156659765

2013-08-10,5.0,"Taking my girlfriend to her birthday dinner at Geja's Cafe was a Very Good Decision (as was bringing a fry thermometer: More later), as the service by Shannon and the other well-trained waitstaff earned the five star rating and a Big Tip: Since moving from Philly a few months ago, it was the best dining experience by far I'd enjoyed since arriving in Chicagoland. For example, when my napkin accidentally dropped on the floor & I leaned over to pick it up, the waiter saw this, and immediately came over with a fresh napkin to replace it: Little things like this shows good training. What's more, both my girlfriend & I are hearing impaired, so our idea of a romantic date is dinner in a quiet, well-lit place (so we can hear & read each other's lips), followed by a captioned movie -- And when I requested this while making reservations, manager Kirby Matthews came through, putting us in the quiet southeast corner next to a front window with southern exposure. Using AudioTools on my iPhone, I measured about 65-68 dBa during our meal. [However, if it's dark outside, this particular table will still present an illumination issue.] We had the standard four course dinner of salad, cheese fondue appetizer, meat & seafood fondue entrees, and flaming chocolate fondue dessert. When we ran out of the spiced cheese, Shannon quickly brought out a fresh pot. The first pot had a note of nutmeg; however the second pot had pretty strong nutmeg flavoring. Also, although the spring mix salad with honey mustard viniagrette used good ingredients, only some of the lettuce and neither of the large diameter cucumber slices were coated.  The dessert chocolate fondue course was quite good, but don't dip the fresh pineapple in it: Save it for last to clear your palate. We liked the pineapple so much, Shannon brought us out some more. The dinner course had it's up & downs. Being hearing impaired, we appreciated the offer for a printed sheet of instructions. Even though we demurred on the written instructions since we'd been to a Melting Pot, Shannon made sure food safety was covered, including cross-contamination of dipping sauces & utensils, with an offer that if we accidentally did this, they will replace it immediately. However, when she talked about cooking times, I was a bit puzzled: How would we know? We whipped out our iPhones to use the stopwatch in the Clock app, so we we were covered... Or so we thought. Remember when I mentioned that you bring a fry thermometer? You'll need it, as although our waiter knew when to serve the entree by feeling the lid and I then measured the oil temp at the proper 350° with my turkey fryer thermometer, my GF & I were taking our time, and the heat loss with the lid off caused the temp to drop to an unacceptably low 250° causing the food to be oily as we progressed in our meal -- And this completely explains the greasy food complaints in several other posts here on Yelp. When I asked the waiter to bring out the lid so the oil could heat back up, and even though we were almost done our entree, he & Shannon brought out the ""Super Sterno"" kit which included a fresh can, and also a metal collar to act as a chimney; and in about 5 minutes the oil was back up at 350° and we finished our entrees. SUGGESTIONS:  1) Put in a minimal dress code of no shorts and no T-shirts or tank tops, as we saw several people dressed like this, detracting from the ambience; 2) In the cheese fondue, cut back on the nutmeg; or better, replace the nutmeg with less-aggressive allspice, which has a flavor in between cinnamon & nutmeg; 3) Put a clock with a second hand on the tables, so the cooking of the entree can be properly timed, preferably with a small card indicating the recommended fry times: Especially since the oil frying temps drop because of the sterno running low, this is an issue; 4) There just is not enough heat energy from the sterno to keep the oil at 350° with the lid off:, and this experiment will prove it: Place two pots with fry thermometers side-by-side, cover, and allow to come up to 350°, marking down every minute to create temperature profiles for each. Uncover both pots, and in one pot cook a typical entree portion for two, over the average time a two-topper takes, probably about 25-35 minutes, continuing to record the temperature in both pots every 60 seconds. What you will find is that although the oil temp of the pot cooking the food will decline more, so will the oil temp in the unused, uncovered pot. If you are with Geja's, e-mail me at  Dan@Snip.Net  and I'll show you several ways to fix this problem; 5) All the way back in the spring of 1988 while at Georgia Tech, I worked for a short while at one of the original Melting Pot franchises in Atlanta at Howell Mill & Northside. The tables inside had sealed electric single element electric hotplates built into each table; while outside on the deck we used restaurant-quality single-burner butane stoves.~",0.9904,0.869,0.09,0.042,0.36843617259110223
2013-08-10,5.0,"My boyfriend and I had a blast here, we had never done fondue before but decided to grap a Groupon and go out to celebrate the start of a new school year. We arrived right at 5pm and were lucky enough to grab a booth so it felt a bit more secluded and I think definitely added to the ambiance. We ordered two glasses of sangria, he had the white and I chose the red. They were both fruity and flavorful. The cheese fondue appetizer was rich and we actually needed two bowls of it because we were seriously dunking our bread and fruit into that cheese. The salads were not much to write home about but also not disgusting. We got the Prince Geja's Combination which gave half a platterful of raw veggies and then a piece or two of lobster, shrimp, beef, scallops, and chicken per person. My first impression was that it would not be enough food but by the time we got the hang of cooking the skewers in the oil I was starting to feel stuffed. Then, there was dessert. It was really good and I wish I had saved more room to enjoy it, even the coffee was full of flavor. Overall, I highly recommend at least trying this place out with your significant other or special friend.

2013-08-10,1.0,"I'll start out by saying this was my fifth time at Geja's, and I went there with my wife this evening for our first anniversary -- obviously, we like the food, and we've always had good service experiences in the past.  However, we had a terrible time tonight, and it deserves public mention.   We ordered their first wine flight with dinner -- glass with the first course, glass with the second course, glass with dessert.  The first glass in the sequence was a Pinot Grigiot.  Instead of bringing us the wine we had ordered, the bartender brought us two glasses of generic white wine, and said something the effect of, ""We don't have that Pinot Grigiot anymore, and actually we don't have any Pinot Grigiot, but here are two glasses of other white wine -- and the good news is, it's two dollars cheaper!""  It was a swilly Chardonnay.  When our waitress came, I explained the situation -- the restaurant was out of what we ordered, and instead of letting us know that and asking whether we wanted some other type of wine instead, just brought whatever; we don't like it; please take these glasses away and let's go with the second flight instead (which I would have ordered in the first place had she mentioned that they didn't actually have the wine we were ordering). So she brought us a different glass of white wine for the first course (what I thought was the first wine of the second flight, as we had discussed), and it was pretty good.  Then the second course came.  No second course of wine.  10 minutes passed without any service.  When she came back, I asked her if the second glass of wine was on its way, and she said something to the effect of, ""Well I already brought you your second glass of wine.  You don't want your dessert wine already, do you?""  Obviously there had been some miscommunication -- No, we don't want dessert wine, we just want the second wine in the sequence -- we're still expecting three glasses of wine.  She apologized, and said, ""OK, of course I don't want to cheat you out of a glass of wine. I'll bring you another glass."" 5 minutes later, she came back with two glasses of Muscat dessert wine.  At this point my wife, who is very reluctant to engage in any sort of confrontational behavior, explained again to the waitress what the situation was, and tried to resolve the confusion by explaining what we had already explained.  No, what you just brought is the third course of wine; we just want a second course of wine to go with our entree. This was when the waitress rolled her eyes, left our table, and as she was doing so, said, very clearly, yet under her breath ""You talk to me like I'm an idiot.""  So this really pissed me off.  Neither one of us treated her like an idiot.  In fact, I thought we had been more than understanding in explaining why things weren't right.  I immediately got up and found the manager, and explained the problem to him outside the front door of the restaurant so as not to make a scene.  When I did, he did not apologize for the error, or the poor service that ensued, but said, ""I just don't believe it.  She is so usually so sweet."" Eventually, we got our second course of wine, but not without being mean-mugged by the entire wait staff -- with the exception of Shannon, our replacement waitress, who did a really great job in salvaging what had, until her arrival, been a really miserable experience. It's a shame because we have really liked this place, despite its priciness.  We won't be back again.  Definitely the worst restaurant service experience of my life.  Don't let it happen to you on *your* anniversary!",-0.6917,0.823,0.083,0.095,0.32946633825944177

I was just lucky to get in on a Saturday at all. The decor was okay, to be honest I don't remember much of it because I was so blown away by the service. Our waiter (whose name I really wish I remembered) was awesome. He went over the options for the fondue, suggested a bottle of wine from the specials list (we ended up ordering 2, it was so good) and then left us alone to make our decisions. I was nervous that we would have to order the same thing (the bf HATES seafood, I love it) and was very thankful to learn that we could order our own. We ordered one chicken/steak combo and one lobster/steak/shrimp combo.  One thing I noticed is how efficient the staff is, I was chugging my water (perhaps a little hungover from Friday) and I don't think it ever reached the half full mark. They were on it with everything and every single person was smiling and polite and made me feel happy to be there.  The food- OMG.  The first course was the cheese with bread, apples, grapes etc.  I could probably eat that cheese dip everyday and not get sick of it. It was delicious. Definitely worth getting, if you are just there for apps.  I was a little concerned when the food arrived that there wouldn't be enough. (This after eating an entire thing of cheese and bread) but it ended up being almost too much. Our amazing waiter (Tony??) explained all the cooking times and how to do fondue properly and the 8 amazing dipping sauces and set us on our way. Now, I love to cook and love food but my bf is never the food enthusiast- though in this case I have never seen him have so much fun at dinner. It may have been the bottle(s) of wine but we had such a good time cooking our veggies/proteins and trying them with new sauces. Our flame went out during the meal, and there was a buss boy at the table to relight it within seconds. By the time we were done with the entrees we were both stuffed and happy. Then they brought out the chocolate. On fire. With marshmallows. Sold. Done. Best restaurant ever. The bf isn't even a dessert person and he was all over it.

2013-07-28,5.0,"My 5 star rating is based on a very unusual set of circumstances... Many years ago I had an unfortunate experience at Geja's - it was an accident and could have happened anywhere. When I reached out to the manager at the time (years ago) he responded very, very poorly. Insult was added to injury and I walked away from the experience with really bad feelings towards Geja's. Recently I had the opportunity to speak with one of the owners of Geja's, Mr. Jeff Lawler. Still bearing a big grudge, I came on pretty strong with my complaints. Mr. Lawler handled the situation with 100% grace and professionalism.  He explained that the previous manager I'd had the terrible encounter with had been let go from the company a long time ago. Mr. Lawler has been with the company for many years, as have Geja's other owners and managers. This crew clearly takes a lot of pride in what their restaurant is doing (community involvement, high quality product, good service, etc.) and appear to be very personally invested in continuing to move Geja's in a positive direction. Jeff Lawler (and Geja's, as a whole) responded to my outreach in a manner that left me feeling hopeful that some people really do still care about doing the right thing and the general well being of their fellow humans. It was that human touch and genuine Chicago-style good heartedness that has earned Geja's a 5 star rating in my book.

2013-07-25,3.0,"Simply put: Geja's is only worth your visit if you have a Groupon. Otherwise, it's definitely not worth the price. This isn't to say it was bad. The seafood tasted extremely fresh, the chocolate fondue sauce with brandy, red wine, and nutmeg was extremely complex and delicious, and the cheese fondue was pretty awesome. However, you can expect to pay around the $50 per person if you opt to get one of Geja's signature fondue meals, and while I was by no means not full by the end of the experience, it was because I had loaded up on the salad, the cheese fondue, and the desert fondue. The actual protein part of the meal (where you dunk your seafood, beef or chicken into the hot oil), I thought the portion sizes were pretty small. We only received 3 small-medium-sized pieces of each with a plethora of veggies. I had looked at the pictures on here before, and it appeared that that was going to be the case -- and unfortunately, indeed it was. As many others have pointed out, it is extremely dark in there, so it's often hard to tell if your protein is cooked all the way through. Kudos to the wait staff for explaining how long it takes to cook things (the GF and I busted out the stop watches on our smart phones), but we found that the recommended times resulted in our food being cooked on the outside and raw in the inside. Maybe our oil wasn't hot enough or something, but had to cook things 30 seconds to a minute longer to ensure the food was properly cooked. Also, I would hardly call this Chicago's Most Romantic Restaurant... maybe if you're in one of the booths, but if you are sitting in the middle like we were, expect to be elbow-to-elbow with the couple next to you. So yes, Geja's wasn't bad, but it wasn't a 4- or 5-star experience as well. It gets a solid 3-stars with the Groupon, 2-stars without it.",0.9706,0.848,0.112,0.04,0.5202279202279203

However, this place is definitely not the spot for a good fondu experience.  The interior of the restaurant is old and outdated.

We got there right before the restaurant was open and there was literally one other table but they would not sit us because our reservation was at 530 and not 500pm.

Once we sat down we were given a list of all their prices for the different fondu options. All over priced for what they ended up being. We ended up just going for the cheese and chocolate option as it seemed like the best deal and we weren't starving. The cheese was all basic vegatables; onions, green peppers and mushrooms and basic bread.  The chocolate desert was simple as well; graham crackers, marshmellows, rice krispy treats, one strawberry on top of everything. I had hoped that for the price(this is more expensive than the melting pot which is a chain but definitely better), and the fact this is supposed to be a local favorite there would be something unique or interesting.

Fig jam and brie are amazing together, and Geja's Cafe's presented delicious, soft brie and stunning fig jam.  The five of us also ordered the chocolate and cheese fondue, and personally, I  loved the cheese more than the chocolate. Dipping grapes, apples, and pretzel bread into the rich, savory goodness was much fun.  More than the bread, I liked the grapes and apples with the cheese fondue (classic combo, right?).

2013-06-20,2.0,"Never having had fondue before, I eagerly purchased the Groupon, which was $30 for $70, quite a good deal. Although they offer reservations via OpenTable for the ease of the customer, they require Groupon users to call in to make a reservation. This isn't a big deal, but it does make you think - after all, Groupon users should be treated just like a full-price paying customer, especially if they want me to come back in the future and pay without a Groupon. So why would they want to know ahead of time that I'll be using a Groupon? Unless they have a specific policy of segmenting customers and discriminating against those who intend to receive a discount - just an observation from a marketing professional... Nevertheless, we went there with another couple last night for dinner. The valet parking out front was very convenient and reasonably priced - only $10 plus tip. Going inside, I can definitely see the romantic atmosphere the second we walked in. It was very pleasant and dark inside, even though the tables are all very squeezed together. When we went up to the hostess' booth to check in for our reservation, we were instantly treated in a negative manner. Now, I am an extremely patient and courteous person in a restaurant because I know how hard it is to work in a busy restaurant.  Unfortunately, there is NEVER an excuse to roll your eyes, huff and puff, and be greatly rude to customers on multiple occasions. The two hostesses were not helpful what so ever, and they made it all out to be such a headache just to be seated. They were rushing us, were inconsiderate, and rolled their eyes at us many times. We did not ask for anything special nor did we give them any reason to react poorly towards us. Maybe we shouldn't have mentioned we had a Groupon? Regardless of the horrible service, the food was delicious. It was definitely what I had expected from fondue and I would really like to go again for fondue - just not here. The good food is the only reason why they received two stars instead of one.  I hear the melting pot is pretty good, we will have to check it out.",0.985,0.791,0.143,0.066,0.5186607142857144

After a while I got comfortable there, but since the atmosphere is dark and romantic, I wanted to be tucked away in a corner or something, instead of seated next to another couple less than a foot away.  The food is fresh and delicious. I got the aged beef and really enjoyed it.  I also loved the cheese and dessert fondue at the beginning and end. The waiter tells you how to cook everything and walks you through it.  The waitstaff does a good job of being attentive and available for you at all times throughout your meal. My one complaint is the weird smell of the place when you first walk in. Its definitely not a pleasant smell. HOwever, once you are seated you cant smell anything. Its just a quick whiff when you walk in.  You should definitely take a lover here or a close friend that you haven't seen in a while so you have plenty of time to catch up.

It's really the only way to make it worth the price. We made a reservation weeks in advance but still got stuck with the table next to the hostess stand. My husband was basically blocked in the corner and my chair was constantly kicked throughout the night. People say it has great ambiance, but it's so loud and tables are packed on top of each other. It wasn't exactly romantic.  Regardless, our waitress was fantastic and we were determined to make the best out of it.  The food was pretty good. We did the Cheese and Chocolate deal (which comes with a house salad) as we have done fondue before and knew that Cheese, Chocolate, AND oil fondue was way too much to consume in one seating- Though we also ordered the Gourmet Board which gives you a choice of 3 cheeses and several different smoked meats and that was a great compliment to cheese fondue. We also enjoyed three glasses of wine. WIthout a groupon, this meal would have cost about $120 (including tip). Without it, it came to about $45. $45 is a reasonable price for what we received. $120 is definitely not.  We ended up having to leave in a hurry with plenty of the chocolate fondue left. We were prepared to just leave it and go, but our waitress offered to wrap it up for us and said it would reheat easily. It took them about 3.5 seconds to wrap it up and get us out of there which was really appreciated. We did reheat the chocolate the next night in a little crock-pot and it was just as good.   I would come back here, but only with a groupon, and I would specifically ask for a booth or a table in the back to avoid any of the three tables right by the hostess stand.",0.9953,0.779,0.175,0.045,0.4784013605442176

We walked in at 8:00pm on a Friday night with our Groupon, asked for a booth (anticipating a 30 min wait) but got right in!!  I was worried about cooking all my food in Oil so I asked the waitress about it and she offered broth.. not only broth but BOTH broth and oil pots so that my boyfriend was happy too :) Our waitress was VERY knowledgeable, letting us know that we didn't have to order the same dish even though it says ""per person"" on the menu.  They were EXTREMELY fast with our food and was very tentative to the flame, making sure it wasn't burning our cheese or anything.  The cheese was my favorite part... SO rich and yummy. They don't skimp on portion sizes either!  TONS of wedgies, potatoes, meat and sauces. My favorite was the Ginger Chili. BE CAREFUL- when they say ""coffee"", they offer cappuccinos, lattes, etc. We got 2 cappuccinos thinking it was the included ""coffee""- WRONG. 14$ was added to our bill.  Our bill was 38$ after the previously bought groupon for 35.

The place has a nice, warm vibe that makes you comfortable and is also very romantic if you're with a date. The waitstaff have also always been very kind and do not have any qualms if you've never eaten fondue (or just simply can't cook).  The food is top notch. Again, while it is a bit expensive, it's a pretty good value considering you will leave with a food baby. The cheese fondue starter is excellent. Personally, I always get the combo which is 2 pieces of steak, chicken, lobster, shrimp, and scallops plus a mountain of veggies. It's intimidating at first especially cooking the seafood but its easy once you get the hang of it. Finally, the dessert fondue is just out of this universe. I mean, who doesn't like dipping stuff in melted chocolate? If it were socially acceptable, I would probably bathe in that melted chocolate- it's that damn good.  It is a bit expensive, but hey, first world problems right? Also, my girlfriend and I made reservations for our one year anny and they gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne.

The chocolate and cheese fondue is so delicious and totally the way to go. I haven't actually tried their main course fondues just because its a bit pricey (I might give 4.5 stars if I could because of price) but if the main courses are anything like the chocolate and cheese option, I imagine its just as wonderful. The service has been outstanding every time I've been there. I actually just visited here again this past weekend and we made reservations via Open Table at about 6 or 7pm for 9:30pm. We arrived promptly at 9:20pm (which seriously never happens, I feel like I'm always late), and had to wait until about 9:55pm to be seated. Of course, waiting 25 minutes past your reservation time is annoying but the atmosphere is so great and the food is also worth the wait, plus I wasn't in any hurry. The manager came over to us at about 9:45pm and apologized for the delay and explained that all of their reservations starting at 5pm had all been behind because of the storm that day, which I guess I understand. Still, I wasn't really in a hurry and didn't mind. Once we got seated, our waitress was wonderful and right away told us that the restaurant wanted to buy us our first round of drinks for being patient. Being that we love the sangria and usually get the carafe because its a good deal, we ordered that and they ended up taking the equivalent of two glasses off of our bill. That's awesome customer service and totally sets them apart from other places in my book. Just to touch on the atmosphere, I absolutely love it. It reminds me of Spain/Europe which I love and I also really enjoy Spanish/Flamenco music. So, the live music is always great. Plus it feels cozy and they ask that you stay off of cell phones/electronics which I think is great. Overall, I really love this place and try to go back every couple of months to get my fondue fix.

2013-04-30,2.0,"This review is a little biased because I was never a big fan of fondue.  I really really wished that this place was going to change that.  Unfortunately, it did not--not even close.  The atmosphere of this restaurant was nice with the simple decor of wine bottles and the dimmed lighting.  It's a romantic place to bring your significant other.  The staff are were all pretty much polite and courteous.  So why the 2 stars?  If it wasn't for the staff and atmosphere, I wouldn't even give it a one.  My wife and I got the dinner set that was recommended by our server.  I believe it was called the connoisseur where it has the beef tenderloin, lobster, and shrimp.  The dinner set comes with cheese fondue and a mix of fruits, bread, etc as an appetizer.  The main dish comes with whatever you decide on and with assorted vegetables and 8 dipping sauces.  Then you get chocolate fondue with strawberries, marshmallows, etc.  You will find a lot of the pictures in the photo section.   There was no ""wow"" factor for me.  They give you so little ""meat"" so I felt like I got ripped off.  If you are a meat lover like me, it'll be hard for you to appreciate this meal, too.  I literally got 3 small pieces of the beef tenderloin, 4 small pieces of the lobster tail, and 2 ""jumbo"" shrimps.  The rest of the plate was filled with my wife's portion of the meat that was nearly identically as mine,  the 8 dipping sauces, and a lot of vegetables.  The dinner set also come with ""coffee"" after the dessert.  Just get the coffee and say no to whatever else they offer because they charge extra for that.  We were foolish to thought it was the ""coffee"" that came with the dinner set and got the special bailey coffee or whatever, so they added another $11 each cup towards the bill.  The price of the dinner set was not adjusted to accommodate the coffee. What the heck? Not totally the server fault, since we should've asked. I just wish they would at least... nevermind.  By the way, we came here because of a groupon my sister got us for Christmas 2012 and noticed that it was expiring.  Even with the $70, i still felt like I wasted my money here because the bill came out to be waaaay more than seventy dollars because of the stupid coffee and ""sangria"" which was average at best.  if you are looking for a good amount of food, don't come here.  If you are a fondue lover and like romantic settings, for sure come here.  This place is just not for me, so I do not plan to return any time soon.",0.9846,0.832,0.114,0.054,0.549764384920635

He walked to table never asked how the meal was and just opened by saying I heard there is a problem. So, we explained to him what the problem was.

He was like that's not how it works. We said fine we will pay it as it is and he walked away. He then came back to prove to us that the printed out Groupon said they weren't responsible for taxes.

They made us peel off our winter coats, throw them in a garbage bag and take them down to the laundry room. I had to wash my coat twice to get the smell of oil out of it.

We did the four course and the dijon dressing on the salad is to die for!  The food was great, service was well paced, and the experience was great.  Until we went to leave.   Now, as is often the case with ladies nights, two of us girls cried.  We were quiet about it, and acted like ladies the entire time.  In fact, we went out of our way to keep our usual shenanigans to a minimum.  However, when we left, two of us went t the front door and two to the bathroom in the back.  Where we caught our waitress talking crap about us to two other servers.  As soon as she saw us she shut up and looked ashamed of herself, but seriously?!  We were nothing but courteous, gave her a very generous tip on the total bill (even thous we had a coupon that saved us $70) and she has the nuts to talk about us before we have even left the building?  Not impressed.

I would recommend the sangria which was one of the best I've had - it was bursting with flavor. There are 8 dipping sauces you can try for the main course, and the chocolate fondue dessert course was delicious. They light the chocolate on fire for a few minutes so you can make s'mores as well.

It's super romantic - low lighting and candles, tables spaced far apart so not noisy (at least on the East side of the restaurant where we were sat, definitely not in center of the restaurant), great wine selection, cozy decor, and you can spend hours. The staff is very friendly and attentive, your water glass will never empty. We ordered the premium 4 course dinner - this is certainly more food than 2 can handle. The cheese fondue and salad come out together. The salad is well dressed and refreshing in contrast to the cheese, but it's simple and you'd be best served reserving your appetite for the fondue. The cheese fondue is delicious, yummy gruyere. The pumpernickel is the best for dipping. I would suggest eating the grapes on their own just as a palate cleanser. For the dinner we chose a combination of beef tenderloin, lobster tail, jumbo shrimp and scallops. The shrimp and scallops were the real standout meats. The beef was good but more just served as a canvas for the dipping sauces (like the bbq), and the deep fried lobster just reminded me of chicken. Easily the best sauces were the spicy aioli and the spicy thai chile/garlic sauce. The broccoli, onions and mushrooms were the best vegetables to fry (try w the dill sauce), potatoes and bell peppers were nothing to write home about. The chocolate fondue desert platter is great. I'm not a chocolate person but I thought the chocolate was delicious. And definitely cook the marshmallows while the chocolate has flame. I'd try heating the bananas too. The pineapple seems unnecessary however. I'll be going back for another romantic evening, and requesting a booth.",0.9975,0.763,0.229,0.008,0.6002164502164503

They had a lot of sauces for dipping and lots of different fondue options. The portions were perfect, as sometimes you can get too much food when you're at fondue.

I would have liked more chocolate, but it was perfect. Something to keep in mind if you have been to one of the Melting pots, Geja's is oil based cooking.

We were originally seated at a table that really did not feel great.  When we asked to be reseated somewhere else, the staff was really accommodating and did not hesitate to move us seeing our displeasure.  Our new area of seating was wonderful! The restaurant's menu consists of different platters of raw meats/seafood.  Their selection was all meats, all seafood, or a mix of both.  I ordered the seafood platter which included lobster tail, scallops, and shrimp. Our meal consisted of an appetizer (which had small slices of bread, apples, and grapes) dipped in cheese. It was delicious!!  Our appetizer also included a house salad with dressing. Our entree was served on one huge plate with each of our orders on it.  The plate included veggies to cook with our meats/seafood. We opted to cook half our food in broth and half our food with oil.  I did not try the oil, but I really enjoyed the broth. It was flavorful and is a much healthier cooking option. Our dessert was a mix of rice crispies, marshmallows, and pound cake.  It was delicious!! While we were eating our three course meal, there was a guitarist next to us playing live music.  The ambiance here was great! The dim lighting in the restaurant made things very romantic. The restaurant allows BYOB but charges a corkage fee of $15. The restaurant offers valet parking for $10, but there is some street parking available (but not much).

2013-02-04,2.0,"After reading the reviews, i was pretty excited, but I have to say I was extremely disappointed. I love fondue and we've been to fondue places multiple times, so this isn't our first experience.  First, it's not ""romantic"" really. You're so crammed in there you're pretty intimate with your neighbors unless you're one of the lucky few who get a booth. Otherwise, maybe this would be fund with a group, but with a date, it kind of sucks. The table we sat at was also so small, I was afraid to move for fear of knocking something over. In addition, they seated us next to the ""musician"", so I was right next to his butt the whole time. Talk about romantic.... Also, there is a horrible fried oil/fishy smell and you can't get it off your clothes or your hair. So overall, not a good date place unless you plan on jumping in the shower soon after. As far as the menu goes, you don't have many options. The cheese fondue is what it is, nothing special about it. The main course is just a vat of hot oil. No flavor, nothing. Just oil. You stick your meat in, your vegetables, etc, and everything comes out fried. The dipping sauces also left a lot to look forward too. I expected some fantastic, unique flavors, (especially since you're cooking in flavorless oil), but no..it's just BBQ, dill, butter, teriyaki, etc. The usuals. I stopped putting the vegetables in because it was doing nothing for them except make them slimy. I literally had my napkin on the table so I could blot everything as soon as they came out before I actually ate it. The dessert is also just OK. Like i said, you don't have many options to pick from so it's just basic melted chocolate. and I'm sure they just put some of the apples from your cheese entree into your dessert plate. I would say if you're going to spend the money on fondue, just go to the melting pot and get some more flavorful cheese, better broth to cook your entree in, and a dessert fondue that you can customize yourself! (Like dark chocolate and caramel) Needless to say, I'm probably never going back there again! Sorry yelp. I forgot to mention the wait staff! Not the best, but decent. One guy reached over my husband's salad to turn down the heat on our cheese...I have no idea why he couldn't just go to the other side and be a little less rude. During the entree, our waiter came by once to see how we were doing. If we didn't have a bottle of wine on the table, I'm pretty sure our drink glasses would be empty. It also took a while for him to take our entrees away and even longer to get our checks.",0.954,0.824,0.102,0.074,0.5319727891156464

I was a HUGE fan of the cheese fondue- I wish it was available for the entire meal.

They have been here before but it was our first time to experience one of the ""most romantic restaurants in Chicago."" Romantic, it certainly was. Dim lights, music playing, gorgeous wine cellar, beautiful decor throughout, it has a very whimsical, romantic feel even to the minor details such as the curtains in the private booths.  We were first given kind of a crappy table so we asked to wait for a better spot in the booth. Once we were sat, our server was very nice but we told him we were only there for dessert. He was totally cool with that even though he knew his tip wouldn't be as high with just us order chocolate fondue.  Fondue we wanted and fondue came out, sizzling hot with an orange liquor to the gooey, melted dark chocolate. The chocolate itself was very good, however the assortment of dip ins were just a okay in my opinion. There were strawberries, bananas, pineapple, cherries, marshmallows, rice krispies, pound cake and graham cracker crumbs if you wanted to have a s'mores like experience. It was all okay, but I have to say that the quality of the add ins seemed a tad better in the melting pot. Yep, I said it. I mean you get cheesecake in melting pot, what's better than warm gooey chocolate on top of vanilla cheesecake? Nothing, that's the problem. So, if geja's could add some cheesecake to its add ins, that would make it that much better.  The food on the other tables looked just okay, I'm glad we didn't order actual dinner since dessert didn't overly impress me. It was tasty and beautiful, but I am not dying to go back.

2013-01-29,4.0,"Geja's Cafe seems to have a Groupon offer every couple of months, and I buy it whenever it's available. With that in mind, it's a fantastic romantic evening that can be incredibly cheap. And since I've never been here without a Groupon, it's hard for me to not factor that into the experience -- each time I've visited, I've had a wonderful evening that felt like a steal. If you're dining there without a deal, you could easily pay upwards of $100 for two people, depending on your drink selections. Still, though, it's a great place to have a special evening for two. We always get the cheese and chocolate fondue, which allows us to try both the savory and the sweet. This comes with a fairly large salad and a coffee with the dessert. (Of course, not every available coffee is included in the price. Our waiter rattled off a list their coffees the first time we dined here, and I made the mistake of ordering a latte and then paying extra for it.) We've also had the ""add to the pleasure,"" which is a plate of bell peppers, onion rings, broccoli, and zucchini that is served with any of the cheese fondues. The onion rings are fantastic, but there really isn't enough cheese for these additions along with the standard grapes, bread, and apples that come with the cheese fondue. The dining room is dimly lit, and I'd recommend requesting a booth or table in the room with live entertainment. Whenever I've been there, this has been a Spanish guitarist, who is difficult to hear from the back room. Service is always friendly, and the waiters are quick to visit your table to clear plates, refill drinks, and relight the flame on the fondue pot.

We were seated at a table for two and it was very crowded.  Also since we were by a window, it was a bit drafty as well.  It seemed to warm up when they brought out our fondue though.  We both ordered meals.  I got the meal that included Lobster and steak... yum. The service was pretty sporadic.  Our water glasses remained empty.  At the end of the meal we waited a good 20 minutes to hunt down our waiter to get the bill.  Part of me just wanted to leave because it was ridiculously long.  I loved the cheese dip.  But, I did not like it with the fruit.  I only liked dipping the bread in the cheese.  As Valerie W. mentioned, the meat took a while to cook and came out tasting a bit greasy, so I also wonder if the temperatures were off.  The temperatures must have been a bit weird because they pulled the flame on our cheese and chocolate when they started bubbling. I really liked how the meat and shellfish came with 8 different dipping sauces so we had a variety of flavors. The chocolate fondue was pretty good, but I only liked it with the fruit.  I wish there was a way to customize it because we didn't end up eating the pound cake and I wasn't a fan of the s'mores either.  It also made me sad that they didn't bring our coffee out until we reminded them.  And even then we had already finished our dessert and the coffee was cold.  This was my first fondue experience so I do not have much to compare it to.  I would give them two stars if it wasn't for the novelty of a cute fondue restaurant.

2013-01-17,3.0,"I purchased the groupon ($30 for $70) for Geja's a few weeks back, very excited to try it, as it's been recommended by several of my friends over the years. About halfway through the Yelp New Shirt Showcase and Un-wanted Gift Exchange, it was evident that the BF and I were going to have to find alternative means of sustenance.  Thanks to the fact that I had the groupon, and that Geja's takes open-table reservations, Geja's won. We arrived 10 minutes prior to our reservation and were told to wait at the bar (which was fine.)  I couldn't believe how busy they were at 8:30 on a Tuesday night. Is Geja's romantic?  Depends on where you sit.  The booths looked very romantic, the tables, a little too close-set to be lovey-dovey.  We were sat in a booth, but right next to the kitchen, so a lot of hustle and bustle for us. Is Geja's good?  Yes, 'good' is the word I'd use, but not 'great.'  The vinaigrette on the salad was great, light and very flavorful.  The cheese fondue came pre-melted (I'm used to The Melting Pot doing this tableside?) and was very salty, it didn't taste like gruyere.  The fact that they use sterno's to heat everything is cute, but I felt like our oil was having trouble keeping temperature, leading to overly-greasy food. The horseradish dipping sauce was probably the highlight for me, which is a little sad to say for a meal I was so looking forward to.  I'm all for going to independent shops rather than chains, but I think I'd almost rather go back to the Melting Pot. Also, why did I receive a notification from  opentable.com  after our meal that my reservation was cancelled?  This means I didn't get the dining points, and makes me very sad.  They had my name when we walked in, so they had the reservation in the system.  I certainly didn't cancel it, which means they did.  No dining points.  Why?  Bad form, Geja's.",0.9045,0.812,0.115,0.073,0.45252757994693477

I'll take it!  Apparently this must be a popular restaurant because I had to make my reservation several weeks in advance, it's packed even on weekdays.  First impression of the place was positive.  It is quaint and romantically lit with wine bottle decor on the walls.  It did feel cramped though as the dining tables in the middle of the room are right next to one another.  This makes conversation difficult as you feel like you're on a date with the table sitting next to you.  I'd suggest putting in a request for a booth if possible.   The food was good, not great.  Portions were small so you could pace yourself from course to course without getting too full.  Being a picky eater, I mainly enjoyed the appetizer and dessert fondues.  The main course was nothing special. Just cooking your own meat and veggies in oil with a variety of dipping sauces to choose from. It was fun being interactive with your meal, but overall I think it's overrated.  Worth a try for sure, but not necessarily a place I will be begging to return too anytime soon.",0.8902,0.873,0.102,0.025,0.4764816532673676

A few of the sauces are interesting, but that's about it. Their bread is stale and soggy. They only have one type of cheese fondue. They only have one type of chocolate fondue and it is too sweet and no better than melted Hershey's that I could make at home. Finally, they mix raw meat and vegetables.

My husband had never been either so we were fondue virgins. The place itself is very cute. Super romantic, tiny little place in Lincoln Park. You can tell it has been there forever. I was stoked when we got a seat off the beaten path. It is a bit cramped in there, but we got a table right in a window nook, perfect!  Our waitress was super friendly and gave us tips so we knew what we were doing/ We both got the chicken and lobster meals (which come with cheese and chocolate fondue) The cheese was sooo good, I mean, how can you go wrong, bread and warm melty cheese? Sign me up! Love that they had pretzel bread in there too and the apples were a nice addition. Grapes?  Eh I ate them on their own, haha.  The meat was interesting. Very choice cuts, they gave us a ton of lobster and chicken. It came with a bunch of veggies too and dipping sauces. I was a little nervous I wasn't cooking things long enough, although she gave us a  little lesson, haha. It was a fun experience for sure. The only thing I didn't like was how oily it was since you cook it in oil, I wish I had a place to kinda blot it off.  The chocolate fodue was awesome too! They flambe the chocolate so you can roast marshmallows too, which was a neat touch. I loved the pound cake and the rice cripsy sqaures, oh and I guess the bananas, ha, I was such a fat kid that night! Overall. great experience. The meat was good, don't get me wrong, but I probably would go back just for the cheese and chocolate, those were the big hits in my opinion. I think I just am not really into fondue meat in general. I love the ambiance, you can't beat it for a date place, kinda interactive and fun. It is kinda expensive, but was worth it. I think they do groupons a lot so that would be an option.  Oh and I saw someone say they leave the pots of oil out, they definitely do not.

It had a romantic, cozy feel to it and yes it was small, but I didn't feel like it was too small. We were seated at a booth which was definitely a lot nicer than the usual 2-people tables that are stacked next to each other.  Now, I read all the reviews that said it's a ton of food, and you can go without the meat, and to share... but we were afraid we wouldn't have enough food, so we each got a dinner (I got beef and scallops, he got beef and lobster). We were SO full we could barely finish the dinner, let alone even start on the dessert. Each meal comes with 8 ounces of meat (a typical serving is only 4 oz). Top that with the included veggies, potatoes, a salad, lots of bread and fruit to dip in the cheese, and you really could get by fine with sharing one full meal.  Anyway - our server was very attentive, it was a really fun experience - I recommend it for anyone who hasn't had fondue before, and the food was good. I agree with everyone else - if it wasn't for the Groupon it would have been too expensive for what you get, but it was definitely a great fun dining experience!",0.9935,0.774,0.206,0.02,0.48611111111111105

The Fondue is incredible, and I don't just mean that as someone uneducated in it. It's rare I find something new that I instantly fall in love with. The cheese and chocolate both being superbly made. For an intimate gathering of friends or a date, this -IS- Chicago's finest. Just note.. I will say the dinners aren't so good.. but that is my taste.

2012-12-02,5.0,"First time at Geja's and not to be over dramatic....but simply one of the best, most divine and lovely meals I've had.  This place is definitely up there as my Top 5.  I always wanted to try this place but when a Groupon rolled around, it was no questions asked, GOT TO TRY!. The food isn't exactly ready-to-give-up-my-left-arm but the entire experience and ambiance was simply phenomenal.  I usually don't take the time to write reviews (sorry fellow Yelpers) because I never think I have anything witty or useful to add but I just wanted to review this place b/c I loved my experience there. After reading reviews, I was prepared on what to order.  I went on a Friday night 7:30 pm with the bf.  Parking was a little hard but we did manage to score free street parking (there is also plenty of meter parking as well).  We arrived early at the restaurant, approx 7:10pm, but we were able to be seated right away.  The seating area was so cozy, we had a booth and were greeted by a knowledgeable, friendly waitress.  She took the time to explain the menu to us and we were both first-timers there.  Live music/guitar playing, dim lighting (but not uncomfortably dark where you're straining to read the menu and/or cook your food and checking to see if your meat isn't all red inside) and Christmas lights made me feel like I was somewhere in Europe :) Originally, after reading other reviews, I was prepared to order 2 Cheese & Chocolate fondue ($22.95 per person).  But being there, and being hungry....me and the bf were like ""naahhhh...we need some meat!""  Haha, so we ordered Beef tenderloin w/scallops a la carte (the waitress was so nice to point out that if we ordered just Beef Tenderloin w/scallops, it also came with a smaller version of cheese & chocolate fondue). So we opted for a la carte which saves us $10 ($31.95 instead of $41.95).  Kudos to the waitress! Cheese fondue was delish! With just a hint of wine which wasn't too overpowering, we had plenty of bread (3 kinds), grapes, and apples to dip. The beef tenderloin and scallops were also very good along with the assortment of veggies.  What topped it all off was the mouth-watering 8 sauces (ranging from salty to spicy) you were given!  If paired right, you seriously have an explosion of the palate.  My favorite sauces were the horseradish, dill and Geja's spicy sauce for the beef.  Yellow bell peppers were excellent with the apricot sauce, onion and mushroom with the teriyaki/soy sauce, scallops with the garlic butter...etc....but that's just my preference =D  and I've been to Melting Pot before and I don't remember having such a wonderful time. So after the cheese fondue and beef/scallops...we still had dessert!  By now, we were comfortably full.  And remember we got a la carte too!  But who can resist dessert....chocolate fondue with strawberries, pineapple, pound cake, rice krispies, marshmallows and graham cracker crumbs!! YUM!! It is a more ""romantic"" atmosphere the way the lighting is set up but I think groups will be just fine as well.  The noise-level is loud and chatty but not to the point where you're screaming across the dinner table for a conversation.  I'm not all for the mushy-gushy romantic places, but this place didn't feel that way.  Overall, it was romantic but I also had a lot of fun.",0.9985,0.799,0.175,0.026,0.5581776556776558

I'm sure all tables were taken. And I understand why. Shannon, our server, was great. She was funny, very knowlegable and she took the time (even though she was very busy) to take a couple of pictures for us as 3 Veterans (Army, Navy & Air Force) enjoyed our celebration. The place has a great ambience.It doesn't look big from the outside but on the inside there is a bar, lots of tables and the restaurant staff get around very well and are very conscience of each other as they are moving around with hot fondue plates and the like. Shannon also had a partner she worked with that would also check on our table if she was tied up with other customers. That means we never had to wait very long for anything, from water to replacing a sterno that had gone out. At this place you are responsible for cooking your own food, which I wasn't aware of, and I thought that would suck but it was actually really cool. How to cook the food was explained to us in great depth and all of us felt pretty comfortable doing our own thing. All in all I would go back to this restaurant.

We came early in the middle of the week with reservations for a pretty late dinner time for us, but still came regardless for a Groupon that I was redeeming before it expired. We basically waited an hour, and chilled at the bar getting served by JB, who is extremely nice and friendly. I am glad that I came with the Groupon, otherwise I wouldn't have felt that it was worth the experience fo me. It is certainly a romantic spot, but romance doesn't really fill my belly. I don't think there was a table that sat more than 4 people together. It's dimly lit and very cozy. I got the Prince Geja's Combination while my boyfriend just got the beef tenderloin. We opted not to have the cheese or chocolate fondue since we just wanted to cut to our meal and didn't want to have filler food and it was already late to eat as it was. So, this is very similar to Asian hot pot for me, except I make this at home and I make my own soup and sauces. This is one thing that I make that my friends really like and talk about ever since I was in college, so this soup kind of was very light on flavor if there was anything in it at all. I felt like I was boiling my seafood, meat, and vegetables and really the 8 different sauces just didn't please my palate. I am a sauce person too. I love to dip stuff, but the sauces weren't agreeing with me either. In my opinion - you have a good marinade or soup/stock and it could be good enough to be a soup on it's own, which is like how I make my hot pot. So, I forced myself to eat all the seafood and veggies and took home the beef to have with my eggs for breakfast the next day, but the bus boy actually convinced me to take it - and that was an indication to my boyfriend that I didn't really like the food here.

My boyfriend and I shared one of the Premier Fondue Dinners: 4 courses - cheese fondue appetizer, Geja's salad, fresh vegetables, eight sauces, chocolate fondue and coffee/tea. Even with sharing we were both stuffed.... $51.95 plus a $10 sharing fee = $70 after tax = $84 after 20% tip.... $138 if we didn't share the dish...  Not worth the money at all!! In Chicago you can get a much better dinning experience for that money! Food: Honestly overall it was pretty decent, but just not worthwhile or the money Ordered: PRINCE GEJA'S COMBINATION (Aged beef tenderloin, delicate lobster tail, jumbo shrimp, plump Atlantic sea scallops and tender boneless chicken breast)        Salad: Very simple, some weeds with a circle of cucumber.               Cheese fondue: Delicious. We are usually not cheese fans, but it was good. I would never think of dipping grapes and apples into cheese - yummy though! I wish we were given a choice of a cheese for the fondue.                    Main meat/fish dish: Had a pair of each meat/fish. Everything was very tender, but not spectacular....I wanted a timer! We overcooked some food, and some had to put back in the pot because it wasn't cooked through!                          Chocolate fondue: Yummy! First lit it on fir, we roasted marshmallows and then dip in chocolate and put on crushed graham crackers on top - mmmm! I wish we would have gotten a choice of a chocolate for the fondue. Service: No explanations, just cooking times for each item... We kept listening to the waitress next to us, she was amazing! To get server to our table we had to ask other servers to bring him! Setup: Way too many tables for such a small space! All of the dishes and pots are cramped on the table, there is no room to move. It is very dangerous to have hot, boiling pots at the edge of tiny tables. We witnessed this very unsafe situation go disastrous, a table not far from us dropped the whole setup on the floor!

2012-10-28,4.0,"First, unless you have an outing going on near Geja's, don't expect to find parking because Brookfield Zoo is very close by. Just pay the $10 valet parking ($16 if you'll be 4+ hours) and save yourself a headache. Second, when you make your reservation, ask if they can pencil you down for a booth if one is available. They'll probably tell you they can't do that or they have others waiting for one but if one becomes available, you can have it. If they say no, once you're there, ask if you can get a booth if you wait a bit to be seated. Chances are, you'll get that booth and right around the time of your reservation too. Third, arrive 15 minutes early if you'll be asking for a booth on site. Now, to the restaurant itself. It's not as horribly crowded as I was anticipating after reading the reviews. The decor is soft warm indoor lighting, candles and some wine bottle decorations. If you know what cooking oil smells like, you'll probably identify it right away when you walk in the door but honestly, it's not all that. It's not like walking into a room of noxious cooking oil. If you don't know what cooking oil smells like, you probably won't notice it. Oh, and btw, maybe this is new or maybe no one really noticed when others left, but you get a fresh pot of oil before you're seated. I watched a few tables being bused and one guy took the oil at the end of your meal and another guy brought a different pot when the table was being re-set up for the next diners. Anyway, it's very cosy and intimate. You don't have to yell to be heard. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. The food! Here are some helpful pointers. The more meat items in your dinner choice (such as the Prince Combo, you're going to get less of each meat so the total weight of the meat will equal the maximum amount of meat you'd get if you ordered one of the single entrees. For example: I order the tenderloin by itself, that's a max of 8 ounces of meat. If I order the chicken & tenderloin, I'll get 4 ounces chicken and 4 ounces of beef (4+4=8). So when you order the Prince, you get 2 ounces each type of the four meat that comes in it. All the entrees come with the salad, cheese starter (fruit & bread), entree w/veggies and dessert. If you're a little uncomfortable, the wait staff will be happy to show you a few times how to do it. The Gruyere cheese is a bit strong for a starting off if you're doing the four course entree. I haven't tried just their cheese fondues but I'll be going back to do just that next time. The meat and veggies are very fresh, the tenderloin was a delicious cut of meat. the sauces and spicy dips weren't too bad. The spicy dips were a bit lack luster in heat but tasty in flavors. The sauces are very good. The chocolate. Here's where I think people get hung up and don't like it. The chocolate you get is DARK chocolate, not milk but dark. Less sweetener and more cocoa. I'm a huge fan of dark chocolate and this was some very smooth chocolate. It was a little thin, but I guess it can't be too thick or it'll burn fast in the pot. Anyway, delicious! I'll be back and next time it'll be just cheese cheese cheese... and dark chocolate!",0.9964,0.85,0.12,0.03,0.454931398292054

The romantic ambiance, dim lighting, live guitarist, attentive service, and sensational food makes Geja's perfect for any special occasion.  Due to their extensive wine menu, we were undecided as to which wine to choose for our meal. However, our wonderful server brought us three tastings to see where our pallets were. We agreed upon a bottle of Petite Syrah (if your going to have more than one glass definitely get a bottle). For our meal, we ordered two Prince Geja's Combination Premier Dinners (4-courses) (highly recommended).  For starters, we each had a salad with a lovely homemade dressing. Following that, we enjoyed a rich cheese fondue over an open flame that we dipped our red grapes, green and red apples, and pumpernickel and Italian bread in.  Afterwards, we were brought our main course which consisted of beef tenderloin, chicken, lobster, scallops, shrimp, and a bed of fresh assorted vegetables. Our knowledgeable server explained the cooking times, demonstrated how to cook our protein and vegetables, and broke down the eight different dipping sauces. (truly made the meal) By the end of our main course, we barely had any room left for anything else....that is until we were brought our dessert. Who could resist roasting marshmallows over an open flame, then dipping them in graham cracker crumbs? Or fresh strawberries, pineapples, apples, bananas, pound cake, and rice krispies dipped in delectable and oh so scrumptious chocolate?! You then end your night with freshly brewed coffee.

Maybe it was because I wasn't on a date, but it felt a little seedy to be in a very dark restaurant where you were handling raw meat.  We arrived at Geja's on a Monday night before the dinner crowd got started. As others have mentioned, Geja's has a distinct odor to it, and I was VERY turned off at the fact that they keep their oil on the tables. If you're not switching out your oil, you should not charge me so much for this experience. At least pretend like you're using clean oil and store it in the back, yikes!  Anyway, getting back to the food. We went with the beef and chicken dinner. I loved the cheese course with the apples, bread and grapes. The chocolate dessert was also good, but the quality of the chocolate was a bit iffy.  Now, the meat and why I kept wishing I was at Fondue Stube. First, we were seated in a back table, where the pot of oil was pushed back against a wall. My friend and i felt a bit unsafe was they never moved the pot! It would have made way more sense to move it to the center of the table. It was a hassle to get to our meats and veggies without feeling like oil was going to get everywhere. Also, because tables are crammed in, we spent the whole night overhearing a very awkward...date? Meeting between married people who weren't married to each other? I don't know, all I do know is the guy said he hated Nirvana, are you for real? The meat and veggies all tasted fresh, but again with it being dark it was a little hard to tell beyond the time of 3 minutes we were suggested when our meat was fully cooked. The sauces were okay, my favorites were the dill and spicy aioli.  Other high points of the evening included the service, which was great and very prompt. Waters were refilled regularly and we never felt ignored.

The main course also came with bellpeppers (all three colors), mushrooms, broccoli (which was delicious in the oil!), potatoes, and onions. It was fantastic. We also got a bottle of wine which was house, and it was delicious! It really complemented the food nicely (it was a red, but even still it went well with all of the seafood.) Final course brought us pineapple, strawberries, cherries, marshmellows (with graham cracker crumbles to dip it in.) and a coffee. It was so simple, but elegant. The courses were appropriately sized, ( I ate a light lunch, and only had a coffee for breakfast and found myself very contently full, not overly so.) Trust me, I can throw down on food too.

2012-10-03,3.0,"I finally lost my v-card and got fon-DONE! At an uber romantic spot, naturally.  Too bad all that romantic ambience almost made me miss the festivities entirely.  Let me preface this by saying that I am notoriously horrible with directions. You know that story about the Massachusetts couple that wandered a bit too far on an apple orchard...got 'lost' and had to call 9-1-1? Yeah, I totally laughed on the outside when I heard that story...but on the inside, I was silently empathizing with them. I too have felt that familiar panic when making my way through a haunted house, a maze of any sort, and most recently -- while trying to find my way back to my table after a trip to the ladies room at Geja's.  Here's how it went down. I asked the server where the ladies room was, and he offered to walk me over since it was ""a little bit far."" My pulse quickened a bit, but I resolved to focus on the path he was weaving through the dimly lit restaurant and told myself that it would be fine. I should have been dropping bread crumbs along the way. When I left the ladies room, the restaurant seemed even more dimly lit...the tables more closely packed than I remember...corners where I swear there were none previously. My first attempt landed me in a dead end, which I tried to play off (I'm sure completely unsuccessfully) by acting like I was looking for someone. By pure luck, I found the front-of-house - and was able to stumble upon my table shortly after. Whew! Crisis averted. I vowed to stay in my seat thereafter. Being my first time at Geja's, hubby and I decided to go all out and get the 'Deluxe Seafood'  (shrimp, scallops, lobster) dinner, which includes: cheese fondue, salad, fresh veggies, a plethora of dipping sauces, chocolate fondue, and coffee.   Geja's famous cheese fondue was lovely! Though admittedly, I found the gruyere with white wine mixture to be a bit heavy - enjoyed best with a half dip (instead of the full dip-and-swirl that our server demonstrated). Surprisingly, I was a fan of apple dipping! My only gripe with this course was the absence of the pretzel bread promised on the menu - because even I (sauce-averse that I am) know that pretzels dipped in cheese are divine.  And just when I was getting cozy in my dipping experience, our main course arrived. [Flamenco music screeches to a halt.] Oh...the food is raw! Duh. I obviously didn't do my homework, as I thought the seafood would arrive cooked, our only job to put it on a stick and dip. I quickly tried to hide my surprise, and began skewering some seafood. Most pieces took only a few minutes to prepare in the piping-hot broth - each batch getting even yummier as the broth began to collect a little bit of goodness from each cook. I couldn't quite perfect the timing for the scallops, which always seemed to come out just a bit too tender...though the shrimp came out perfectly each time! Some friendly advice - save your lobster tails for the very last cook, when the broth is nice and brown. We dunked a few tails too early on, and they came out super white and kinda weird-looking. Speaking of flavor, holy dipping sauces! We were brought an entire tray of sauces for our dipping delight.  In all honesty, it was a bit wasted on me - as I found the one that I Loved (chili!) and stuck with it through most of the meal. But I did enjoy the aioli sauce for the potatoes - and my hubby seemed to get a kick out of the sauce spread. Alas, here's where I have to explain the lack of stars. Though our service was pleasant (albeit, a little stuffy for my taste) for most of the evening, when it came time for coffee - we were a bit tricked by our sneaky server. He cleared our dinner, and said ""And for your coffee, we have lattes...espresso..."" And I know we should have clarified, but the way he said it just seemed to imply that any of those options would suffice for the coffee which is 'included' in our meal. But then the bill arrived...Nope. So we humbly brought the matter to our server, knowing that we we likely misunderstood our coffee options - but hoping at the very least to get a couple cups of the 'included' coffee (because no one likes feeling like they got cheated out of something they're due) - and he totally shamed us. In a voice loud enough for all the surrounding patrons to hear, he proclaimed ""THAT is a latte, and THAT is an espresso - you have to PAY for those."" No offer to bring us some of the regular coffee, no apologies for the confusion, just some coffee-shaming to leave a bitter taste in our mouths for the rest of the evening. The chocolate fondue lost some of its luster after that. Yes, I Love a good toasted marshmallow. Sure, graham cracker crust crumbs are pretty genius as far as toppings go. And the pound cake bites weren't bad. But we were so irked by the whole coffee fiasco that dessert was basically a bust.

2012-09-26,3.0,"My girlfriend, being obsessed with Groupon, bought a deal to Geja's Cafe ($25 for $50 of food).  The decor is fairly ...romantic-ish but I wouldn't call it full on romantic at all. The decor is kind of old and reminds me of a neighborhood dentist's office from the 1980s with candles instead of overhead lights.  The dining room itself is a little cramped too and could be perceived as a catacomb if someone 500 years from now discovers it. Onto the actual food experience. Neither of us were terribly hungry, so we ordered the Combination and decided to share it. We were told by the wait staff that there would be a $10 charge for sharing if we didn't order something else on the side more than $10.  Their wine list wasn't bad and had some for less than $10/glass on there that were okay. I settled for the Malbec, which is a favorite of mine. The first course was the cheese course and was a blend of Gruyere and something else. It was not too bad and I liked the taste, but overall it was nothing to write home about. You are given some fruit, vegetables, and bread to dip it in. Not bad pairings, although a few were weird. Fruit and cheese can go well together, but I'm not sure if red grapes and the cheese were the best pairing. Now for the main course, the meat plate. This consist of about 8 ounces of meat (Beef Tenderloin, Scallops, Shrimp, and Lobster), or 2 ounces per meat listed right before, and some vegetables (mushrooms, red and yellow peppers, broccoli, etc).  I wasn't impressed at all by any of this. First of all, none of the meats were seasoned with anything.  You basically cooked them and the seasoning comes in the 8 or so sauces which they give you. That would be fine IF the sauces were anything good. The dill sauce tasted like it came from a super market, the garlic aioli barely had any garlic in it and the BBQ sauce was OK. I did like the sauce with Sriracha in it though.  The meat itself were decent cuts of meat, but definitely not top of the line. The beef looked like it would be, but once you bit into it, it was slightly disappointing. The dessert course was the chocolate and fruit. Not bad, and the chocolate sauce was okay. Nothing amazing, but it is not Hershey's syrup. It's a step above that. Now, onto the price. This place is way overpriced. Sorry managerial staff or owners if you're reading that, but it is.  Take into account the meat, for example. Lobster, Beef Tenderloin, Shrimp, and Chicken.  For these purposes, I'm going to way overestimate the price of each meat on purpose to show you just how overpriced everything is.  Remember, you get 2 ounces of each meat, or 1/8 of a pound. Lobster - $25/pound. $3.13 for 2 ounces. Beef Tenderloin - $20/pound. $2.50 for 2 ounces Shrimp - $20/pound. $2.50 for 2 ounces Chicken - $8/pound. $1 for 2 ounces. Fruit, Vegetables, bread, and sauces (main course) for all courses - $3 total. Total, that's $12.13 total. Add in about $1 for chocolate sauce, and $3 for the cheese and we're talking about $16.13 now in total food for the entire meal.  At $51/person, that means they're charging about 3.2 times the price of the food. Actually, it's probably more because I'm way overestimating the price at which they buy their meat. In reality, the total price of the food is probably more along the lines of $12 total, which means you're being charged 4.25X the price of food for this.  They could easily get away with charging $33-$40 for this, but $51? Give me a break. Overall, the place's food is extremely average. I thought the decor was kind of cool, and the live guitarist was very good. Our wait staff was also very nice and helpful. The food though, the food. Very average, and way overpriced for what you get and the quality.  I would like to give this another chance, but there's no way I'd come back here unless they lowered the prices and/or actually started seasoning their meat a LITTLE bit beforehand.",0.9975,0.822,0.134,0.045,0.5454048769266161

I grew up near an amazing fondue restaurant (not a chain), and maybe got a little spoiled, but whether that's the case or not, Geja's did not live up to my expectations. Sure, the ambiance makes a cute date night, but I don't think the food and service come even close to justifying the price. First of all, there is only one cheese option- if they're telling me what cheese I've got to eat, it better be really good, but to my husband and I, it was pretty bland. Then I got the chicken and steak, and my husband got the shrimp and steak. The waiter told us the time it would take to cook everything, and all those times were WAY off. We put our beef in for the amount of time he said, and it was still moo-ing at the end. The whole experience is kind of annoying when you have to keep cutting into your meat, only to find it still raw and having to put it back into the pot. Finally, chocolate- what's supposed to be the best part of the meal. Here's the recipe for the ""delicious"" chocolate fondue, so that you can make it at home: Buy hershey's chocolate syrup, put it in a pot on the stove, turn the stove on. There you've got it.

I wouldn't mind spending that type of money on a special occasion or celebration, but we didn't have one that night. Anyway, this is by far the most romantic, coziest, undergroundish restaurant I've ever seen. The ambiance is unlike any other... I felt like I was in a dungeon, but not in a bad way.

This is def the place I would tell people about if they need a night out in a intimate setting. Now onto the food...we both went with the combo dinners. I had the chicken breast with pacific lobster tail and my boyfriend had it with scallops. It's a steep price option, but it included the cheese fondue appetizer which had all sorts of goodies you can deep into the cheese and a salad. There were different breads, grapes, apples, and a few other items as well. Never thought that apples would taste good in melted cheese,  but it was delicious! The meats/seafood came with a bunch of vegetables, potatoes, and eight different dipping sauces. There was also the dessert - which was the chocolate fondue. We were soooo full by the time that dessert came around, we ended up taking it home. It came with marshmallows, strawberries, pineapples, small pieces of rice krispy treats, and other things. Everything was amazing... Our waitress was the best! I wish I remembered her name... she answered all our questions, helped us ""cook"" the first part of our meats, and was very attentive. I usually don't need help with dinner, but fondue is an exception when it's your first time. All the other staff were also extremely friendly too. When I first called to make a reservation, the man on the phone was rude, so I was taken back by that. However, we had to reschedule twice since, and everything else ended up going great. Only complaint that we both had is that we were worried we were under cooking the meat, but the waitress ended up leaving her little flashlight for us so we could check on the color of the meat. Since this place is a bit out of my price range for normal dinners, I don't know how soon I would be back for dinner, but I def will be back for dessert, esp since we didn't save enough room the first time around!",0.9926,0.843,0.123,0.034,0.536094224924012

The whole romantic atmosphere is great, I'll give it that! Great ambiance. And service was spectacular! But what we didn't find impressive was simply the food. We went all out and had the Prince Geja's combination, the whole three course thing (or four if you count the wimpy salad). Cheese fondue was good! Meat platter was decent at best. Dipping sauces were fine, nothing impressive. We enjoyed the experience of cooking your own meat the most, not so much actually consuming it. BTW, our server gave us times for cooking our meat... please multiply them by 3 if you're avoiding contamination of raw meat. I left the beef in there for five minutes and it was still red (when we were told 3 was well done). But maybe it was just our oil was not hot enough? Who knows. All we know is all the timing was completely off. The chocolate fondue however was phenomenal. That's probably what got this review 3 stars as opposed to 2. Great goodies to dip into the chocolate, and the whole high flame for a few minutes due to the orange liqueur was awesome to play with! Overall, we didn't find the food to be that amazing and it ended up being pretty pricy for something we could've done without. Maybe we would've been better off with just a cheese and chocolate fondue, and maybe a cheese platter.

2012-09-08,4.0,"We visited Geja's for our anniversary. I decided to check it out since everyone raves about how romantic it is. For the most part I found that romantic meant that it was dimly lit and had a guy playing the guitar...but I definitely love the cozy ambiance of the place. The narrow walkway to the bathroom kind of made me feel like I was in someones house in Greece or Italy. If you are indeed going to be romantic, be sure to ask for one of the private booths. They are kind of secluded so it really gives you that special touch. We ended up at a regular table and I kind of felt cheated. On to the food...the cheeses that we had with the first course were absolutely wonderful. When choosing which meats to get, I would suggest sticking with the seafood if you are anything like me. We chose the option that had chicken, seafood and beef but we are so anti-salmonella that we stressed the whole time over whether or not the meat was actually done! Not romantic at all! The accompanying veggies were a great touch and the various dipping sauces really completed the meal. The dessert platter has something for every sweet lover...they even allow you to roast marshmallows which was an epic fail for my husband and I. The service is impeccable and they even take the time to ensure that you are well educated on cooking your vittles. Overall, we had a really enjoyable time.

2012-08-29,2.0,"My boyfriend and I got a Groupon for this place.  Overall, we had a nice dinner and the food was fine. However, a couple key things kind of made the night awkward. First off, the place smells bad when you walk in.  And when you leave, you smell like fried seafood.  If we hadn't been going directly home, this would have really ruined the evening.  Still, I have to get my outfit dry cleaned now.  Kind of unfortunate. Second, it's really dark and maze-like.  This would be fine if there were clear paths, but people at tables had chairs really far out and visibility was poor.  It could have easily ended in hot oil being spilled on someone in a collision. Third, you don't really get a choice in cheese with the dinners and the cheese they served was a bit much for my taste. Lastly, the chairs were ripped and old and cheap quality.  For a place that boasts a romantic evening, this was just an awkward claim. For fondue, I would suggest the Melting Pot.  They're well-ventilated and you won't go home smelling like a fryer, you'll be safer in their well-lit restaurant with locking pots and staff that announce when they're rounding corners, you have more choice and the restaurants are less worn down.

2012-08-29,3.0,"Geja's Cafe is a solid fondue restaurant, and is dependable for a nice romantic evening.  My boyfriend and I tried this with one of their Groupon/LivingSocial deals (they have them frequently, so if you don't have one, I suggest waiting until their next offer).  The restaurant is as dark and cave-like as other people have mentioned and the tables are quite close together.  We followed another yelper's suggestion and requested a booth (to have a bit more space and privacy)  when we called to make our reservation.  They did not guarantee the booth but were able to accommodate us upon our arrival. Dining at Geja's is just about identical in every possible way to dining at the Melting Pot.  I had hoped there would be a unique quality that separated this fondue experience from every other, but that quality just wasn't there.  The wine selection is vast and includes both affordable and more upscale options.  The menu items are also solid choices - the cheese fondue is tasty, the entree combinations are plentiful with broth options, and the dessert choices are standard but dependable.  I had hoped there would be different choices and I'd be able to experience more original fondue flavors.   I also have to reiterate some other reviewers - unless you are going for a truly gigantic meal and have a huge appetite, the cheese fondue and dessert fondue are more than enough (and they are the best parts anyway!).  We went with the cheese flight to start as we drank a bottle of wine and then had salads, cheese fondue, and flaming chocolate fondue.  We could barely finish the dessert, and I think we could have easily avoided the cheese flight (which offered a good variety of cheeses and was nicely prepared) and still left with our bellies quite full. If you enjoy the Melting Pot, you'll enjoy Geja's, but don't expect an experience any different from what you've had before.  The menu options are basically the same, the tastes are similar, and the prices are comparable.  The space is nice for a romantic evening (though a little cramped) and quite honestly, I would recommend it over the Melting Pot for no other reason than the constant Groupon deals.  We will go back the next time we have a craving for fondue and a coupon in our hand.",0.9963,0.819,0.164,0.017,0.4918560606060606

2012-08-15,3.0,"I don't understand why everyone thinks this place is romantic. I guess it is dark and wicked expensive and there is a guy playing the guitar most of the time which I guess could set the mood. Otherwise, this place is ok. First, there is a lot of food if you order any of the meat dishes. And I mean A LOT of food.  Second, I wasn't kidding about the wicked expensive part. A dinner for two will EASILY send you over the bill mark. Throw in some wine or other cocktails and it could send near the two bill mark. Third, if you are using a groupon or  restaurant.com  certificate (hey its expensive and I HIGHLY recommend you get some sort of discount), make sure you print it out. The place is a dungeon, and they don't allow customers to use their wifi which means you probably won't be able to download the groupon/certificate on your phone. Fourth, consider getting just the cheese and chocolate fondue instead of the meat dinners. Ok yes the allure of going out to eat involves eating meat for most of us omnivores but seriously you will be wasting a lot of food if you decide to eat some meat even if you arrive HUNGRY. If you do decide to order the meats then here is what happens. They start you off with a small and un-alluring salad, in fact, tell your waiter to just skip it since really you are wanting meat (since you decided against my advice to not order meat) and you will be getting plenty of other veggies and such that some lettuce and cucumbers on a plate will simply take room, albeit a small amount of room, in your stomach.  Then comes the cheese fondue. AWESOME! I mean who does want cheese like all the time save those poor souls who are lactose intolerant? Then comes the big plate of meat with all kind of veggies. Since they only give you four skewers per person, you tend to eat very slowly. Which is good right? I mean anyone who reads weight loss articles knows that you should eat slowly to prevent overeating. Which is exactly what will happen, before you know it, you will be stuffed and there will be extra veggies and meat on the tray that you cannot finish.  But wait, Geja's is not finished in tempting you to fit more food in your mouth as then chocolate fondue comes out! AWESOME! Except for the fact that your pants are about to burst and you've already got the feeling that any post-romantic dinner activities with your significant other will be limited to sitting on the couch letting your food digest.  But SERIOUSLY who can deny a pot of melted chocolate with a bunch of goodies surrounding it? So you attempt to have more and more realizing there are starving children somewhere in the world and you've eaten enough food in the last hour that could have fed one of those kids for 3 days. But resistance is futile as you see the chocolate dripping from the marsh mellows as you roll them in graham cracker crumbles and think you have room for a couple of more. Alas then the bill comes and you realize you should have eaten everything on the plate since it may leave your wallet empty for the next couple of days.  So please, take my advice, arrive about 20 minutes prior to reservations. Sit at the bar and have some great cheese and crackers. Order just the cheese and chocolate fondue.

GETTING THERE: You have to look for it a little bit just to be sure you don't miss it (it's not quite on street level), but they've got $10 valet parking.  A real deal. AMBIENCE:  REALLY nice for a romantic evening out.  Spanish guitar, the feel of an old world taverna, lighting straight out of a Rembrandt.

2012-07-31,4.0,"Always a pleasure to spend a few hours at Geja's! They've been pretty savvy with discount sites - I've seen both Groupons and Travel Zoo deals - not bad when it takes $30-40 off your bill! The best part about getting their deals? It's encouraged us to try a few pricier items - pricier bottles and some of the more varied premier dinners. Don't get me wrong, I still love my tofu and veggies, but lobster and shrimp is lovely too! We always make a reservation, arrive pretty close to the time, and usually kill about 10 minutes in the ""lounge"" in the back corner. It's usually a bit crowded with people also waiting for tables, but the bartender is quick to get you set with a glass of vino while you wait. The one downside? You'll have to settle up here before you get to your table. I understand that from their side, but it's a little hiccup in a system that's usually flawless. Wish they could just take that tab and add it to our dinner. As of late, we took the opportunity to try the veggie broth instead of oil. I must say, it's so much better!! No over-fried veggies! We rarely can finish off all of a course, but with the veggie broth everything felt a lot lighter. We actually were almost able to finish the main course! My one frustration with the main course - I wish they'd switch the sauces more often. I'm a big fan of the dill, horseradish, and butter sauces, but I get annoyed every time I see teryaki and bbq on here. Do people really use those?? A little more creativity would be nice - as well as some smoky flavors. Some of the ""spicy"" ones are more bitey than smoldery. My favorite thing here?? The cheese fondue. Hands down. I get so excited about it the moment we walk in. Crusty bread and that cheese? AMAZING. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!

The guitarist is much better than is required and an interesting guy - I'm a concert musician and introduced myself.   Non sequitur, do thank the musician(s) when you eat out.  I put myself through graduate school playing lounges, and those that thanked me made my dismal time at the venue between school and Bach more enjoyable.   So why just three stars?  It was my partner's birthday - he turned forty-five and I'm forty-one.  A percussionist friend who has strong kung fu with the ladies (I'm gay but amazingly impressed by his powers) had long recommended the place.  By chance, we received a groupon the day before we were to go - awesome, $60 off for $25.  The food was ehh.  We got the steak and lobster premium meals.  The cheese course is just a basic mornay sauce made with gruyere.  I make it all the time for mac and cheese (no, I'm not a fat ass).  I'm quite familiar with the flavor and it was well done.  If you haven't had a cheese sauce like it it's pretty delicious.  The sauces for the main course (8 of them) were the best part of the meal; we particularly liked the Thai, spicy thousand islandish, and teriyaki sauces.  You yourself cook the meats and veggies right there on the table.  Can't bitch about the cooking cause you did it.  It was fine.  The dessert, as has been mentioned in other reviews, is just plan ol' chocolate syrup with some fruit, marshmellows and (dry) pound cake.  While others who have reviewed refer to the chocolate syrup as nothing more than Hershey's, they are correct but I happen to like Hershey's (have some in the fridge now for emergencies - again, I'm not a fat ass).  It's about a two hour meal and the total price was around a buck fifty.  I'm fine paying a fair amount for a great meal, I'm a foodie and cooking is a hobby, but, for what we got, I'm glad we had the coupon.   Will we go there again?  Nah.  However, if you're in the target demographic, please bring protection.  We've been together fourteen years, and I have it on demand.  Just sayin'.",0.9986,0.74,0.231,0.029,0.6234877734877735

Now the food... first when you walk in this place you can smell a strong oil base from the fondue. Broth that this place uses is oil base., not a fan of that. I like my fondue cook on just regular broth. It's healthier and it doesn't leave a taste of oil in your mouth. Our meal was suppose to come with coffee at the end, but we had to ask for it., and the server was like "" oh you want coffee?""

2012-07-02,3.0,"Went here for a late night dinner last weekend with my boyfriend, his brother and his girlfriend. We had two Groupons (thank goodness) and made a reservation for 9pm. Even at 9pm at night the place was still very crowded and people kept flowing in throughout our meal. We did the full meal deal, started with salad/cheese fondue, had a main entree fondue and then chocolate fondue to end.  We ordered the Geja Cabernet, it was a very good wine and was a good choice in my eyes. I am not a fan of cheese, so I opted out of the cheese fondue and just ate the dipping items (the pumpernikel bread was my favorite). The salad was just okay, nothing too special, leafy greens and cucumbers and some fresh ground pepper.  The main fondue was great, 3 of us ordered the beef tenderloin and chicken, 1 of us ordered the beef tenderloin and scallops. It seemed that we received quite a bit of vegetables compared to the actual meat. I would have liked a bit more meat for the price we were paying, even with the coupon. However, fondued broccoli is delicious!  The chocolate fondue was tasty, I really liked that they flambe it so you can roast a marshmellow and create a ""S'more"" with the chocolate and graham cracker crumbs. However, I wish there were more marshmellows. The pound cake was my favorite to dip in the chocolate, but we devoured just about everything on our plates.  The restaurant itself had a slight oil odor, but that is expected in a fondue place. The tables were very close to one another, and I understand that they are a restaurant in the city and seem to be a popular location, but I would prefer to to join the couple next to me that is trying to have their first date. A little more space between tables/booths would have been nice. The lighting in the restaurant was very dim, this made it extremely hard to read the menu. Additionally, when I lost one of my vegetables in the oil I could not find it until the waiter came over and turned on a flash light. Highlight, they had a live musician; however, I am not sure that many of the patrons even noticed him which I'm sure made it difficult for him to get tips.  The price was quite expensive per person, and as I said, I am glad we had two Groupon's to use towards our meal. I did sign up for the birthday/anniversary club  because I think it would be nice to come back for those special occasions in my life, but I probably would just opt for dessert and get the chocolate flambe fondue.",0.9655,0.861,0.093,0.046,0.5926280663780665

I shared a bottle of wine (their summer special which was good) and even with the groupon it was pricey! There are a lot of improvements that could be made to enhance an experience. #1) lighting (it was so dim I couldn't read the menu) #1a) lighting contd (if the waitress needs a flashlight to show you the raw food on your platter for cooking in the oil, they should just give everyone flashlights #3) timers (waitress says 3 min for potatoes, 1 min for shrimp, 3 min? for chicken, etc. If they are concerned about the diner cooking their food properly they should give everyone timers. It was distracting to look at my watch or phone to make sure I didn't under cook the food #4) better chocolate (I agree with other diners saying that the chocolate fondue is more like warmed hershey syrup.

I wasn't so much a fan of the grapes in the cheese.  Of course bread and cheese always go together! I had the scallops/beef and was super impressed with the scallops.  Perhaps it was my fabulous cooking in the oil but they really melted in my mouth and were absolutely fabulous.  The 8 dipping sauces were all great.  My friends had the shrimp and chicken and there were no complaints from either of them.  The veggies were great as well. We ended with the chocolate fondue...even though we were all full we managed to find room for the chocolate!  The highlight for me was the pineapple...ever since I had an edible arrangement with chocolate pineapple I've been obsessed!  The marshmallows with graham cracker crumbles was also great.

Service wasn't special.  They were timely about changing out pots but didn't really spend too much time explaining the menu or tips on cooking.  If doing the Premier dinners that come with salad, cheese and chocolate fondu, you probably don't need another appetizer.  We did the sausage and cheese combo app and although delicious, made it hard to finish everything else.

They only seat complete parties, so be sure to plan for that.  We had a reservation and I am glad we did. The place was packed on a random Wednesday night. OK, first the bad. The place is super teeny and very cramped. Our table could barely fit our food and the fondue pot. Waiters were constantly having to backpedal and wait to scoot by one another. And the ambiance wasn't the best, in my opinion. Just too many people in the space. Oh, and the guitarist didn't really help much. With so many people, it was kinda loud in there, and the music made it even harder to hear. Finally, I had the white wine sangria and it was super watered down. I didn't think there was much wine in there at all. The food made up for all of the above though. We started off with the cheese fondue and a (very small) salad. The cheese was very tasty and it was served with grapes, apple, and 2 kinds of bread.  For our main meal, we had 4 different meats/seafood: beef tenderloin, chicken, jumbo shrimp, and scallops and all of that comes with veggies (onion, pepper, broccoli) and potatoes. They give you 8 kinds of dipping sauces which were all really good. For dessert, we had the chocolate fondue served with rice krispie treats, pound cake, apple, banana, strawberries, pineapple, marshmallows, and graham cracker crumbs. Delicious. The one food con I can think of was that I was surprised they only offered one kind of each fondue. Maybe I'm just used to Melting Pot, where you can choose your different kinds, but here, it was just one of each. They do each fondue well, no complaints there, but I thought there would be more of a variety. Our server was very friendly, attentive, and helpful. She was very familiar with the menu and wine list and made some excellent recommendations. The rest of the waitstaff was very kind too, always asking if we needed anything, always filling up our waters, taking our plates away quickly, but I never felt as though they were hovering. Out whole meal ended up taking about 2 hours. It was a great date night, and would be perfect for a special occasion. I would recommend reservations, and I would think twice before having a group of larger than 4 eat here together. Some final stray observations: It's a fancy place.

This place does NOT blow melting pot out of the water.  After reading the reviews I was expecting Geja's to at least match the impressiveness of Melting pot.   First of all, my boyfriend ordered a beer which was $7 (for a goose island 312 beer that is way too much).  The cheese fondue was OK but not spectacular, and the items to dip in the cheese were strange/not fresh.   The meat fondue tasted great, it was a little irritating to have to keep track of everything without a stop watch (sea food takes one minute, chicken takes 3 minutes, steak takes 1 minute 45 seconds, etc) all in the middle of dinner conversation, but I guess that is to be expected at a fondue place.

Chocolate Fondue:  Didn't even finish it.  Like one reviewer said, it's like Hershey's syrup.  For the record, I have a serious sweet tooth.  So me not finishing was quite a statement. That said, the service was good and the atmosphere was romantic.  It's not going to make me come back here because the price (for the quality of food) is asinine.",0.9621,0.728,0.193,0.079,0.5742424242424242
2012-05-07,3.0,"Great spot for a romantic date. Many of the nice-r Chicago restaurants are SO loud, making it hard to carry on a conversation without yelling across the table. This was not the case with Geja's.  However, SKIP the seafood/beef/chicken course! It is extremely overpriced and it is FRIED. Fried food + fondue = not so romantic nightcap.  Order the cheese fondue (add some vegetables) and chocolate fondue. This is more than enough for a hearty appetite, and you won't need a nap afterwards.",0.8553,0.867,0.116,0.017,0.6212962962962963
2012-05-07,4.0,"The atmosphere is very romantic with low lighting and nice music playing. We were seated within 15 minutes of our scheduled reservation. We had the Geja's Merlot ($26 per bottle) and red Sangria for drinks which were both very good. The wine list is exceptional. We ordered the combination dinners and started with the appetizer (cheese fondu with bread and fruit). The cheese, to us, was not very good. It seemed over powering and took over the taste of the bread and fruit. We decided to dip the food just a tad at that point. The combination dinner was very good. The cooking time that the waitress advised, we feel, was a little less than what we cooked as we felt the meat at times was still not fully cooked.  The variety of dipping sauces provided were all very good. My husband especially liked the spicy dragon one and I liked the honey and dill ones the best.  For $51 per plate you would expect more food though. The dessert plate was the best and the waitress did bring out a small piece of cake with candles for my husband's birthday.  We also recommend the Frangelico Latte for after dessert. SO good!!  Our waitress was nice but seemed put out at times and almost fake.  She barely came by and we saw the waiter/bus boy more than her. He cleaned up all of our plates, he brought our dessert and he brought our Frangelico latte (and recommended it). She did show for payment though.  I do recommend signing up for their emails because you will get coupons emailed to you and you will get a $30 anniversary coupon which I definitely recommend using. Our bill was approximately $177 for 2 of us but $143 with the coupon (before tip). And beware: you will STINK when you leave there. You will smell it as soon as you walk in and it will stay with you until you get home. We decided to go straight home. We even felt oily haha. But overall, it is a good date spot, romantic and the food was very good although very pricey. We probably will not go back but it was an experience that we will remember (anniversary and birthday).",0.9913,0.827,0.145,0.028,0.5249439102564103

I book my reservation and thru negative reviews to the wind and decided to have a open mind. Okay had a reservation at 7:30 got  there about ten Min's late but there were okay I did request a booth so it was a twenty min wait was okay because the tables are cramped like many have stated. okay the smell , I did notice it but it was not like a gross smell it was like a smell of a deep fryer, Yes there was a faint smell to my dress  Is it ruined NO!  The booth was so spacious and the booth has more light due to a shaded light fixture above our heads.  Okay the food I got the Gejas sampler with all their offerings , the chicken shrimp beef it can with scallops, but the let me sub for more shrimp . Okay the portion as I was told its 8oz total so on my platter was a palm full of chicken 4 shrimp because I sub out the scallops , 2 pieces of beef and 2 bites of lobster = not a lot at glancing but when you add the vegetable and the stater fondue of cheese you will be full ! I read that the meat was basically raw which it was  but I brought my own seasoning ! Yes , i did I had my granny purse filled with a sweater ( for a draft) a bottle of lemon pepper seasoning , some fish batter , and a marinade !  Did I need all that NO, but my food tasted good to my liking because ultimately (you are the chef ) so you are in charge! The shrimps were huge my fave of the meat and seafood the chicken was good with my specials seasonings on it !  My beef I gave to the hubby it didn't taste like any special when fried so maybe try it in the broth , which you have to request! The cheese fondue was good , again it doesn't look like a lot but eaten with the apples and bread and salad its filling. The taste of the cheese was unique but tasty even with the grapes, which sounds weird but good. If you run out they will bring more ! Next the chocolate its was okay it did taste like Hershey too me but that's my opinion , the marshmallow toasting was fun and dies down quick so toast fast ! and dint stick anything straight in your mouth ( it will burn you up )! my hubby and i had one cocktail each nothing under 8 bucks in there and the wine glasses are small ! I love it as a special occasion spot but I cant see my self going back no time soon ,the  cost is up there even with the discount but I had a wonderful time and happiness is priceless !",0.9971,0.752,0.191,0.057,0.5506131782447572

The cheese fondue course was not gruyere and ementhaler but rather tasted like cheese whiz and roux with the kirsch and white wine. The chocolate fondue tasted like warmed Hershey's syrup. The meat seafood course did not save the day reaching the oxymoronic pinnacle of mediocrity. Our theory, given the large number of tables that seemed to have a GroupOn, is that the kitchen decided to skimp on ingredients to make up for the lost leader, which in any case marks it as a restaurant on the decline. In this time of excellent, accessible fine cuisine, Geja's only proves that those unable to adapt deserve their extinction.

2012-04-29,5.0,"What can't I say about this place?  The food and service is excellent!!  The food may be pricey to some with your average premier dinner costing about $45.00 a person.  However the amount of food you get is enough to feed you for a whole day.  Having just recently celebrated our 1 year anniversary plus taking my wife here for her birthday for the past 7 years, this place is the best.  Would strongly suggest this place for anybody to take their significant other to.  It is dimly lit, with a person playing Spanish acoustical music quietly.  Perfect for an intimate conversation.  If you order the premier dinner they start you off with a basket full of apples, grapes, and small pieces of bread to dip in their signature cheese.  I am not much of a cheese person but this cheese has the most incredible taste.  During this time you also receive a Salad which is tasty as well.  Once you are finished with this appetizer your main plate is brought out.  If you order the international which is my favorite you get 3 pieces of chicken, beef and 2 pieces of shrimp.  I'm addition you get potatoes onions and other veggies to cook in the oil.  You also receive 9 different sauces to dip your cooked meet or veggies into.  The sauces range from a garlic butter, BBQ sauce, tyriacki, dill, roasted pepper plus others.  After dinner you are offered free coffee which is by far the best coffee I have ever tasted.  Then for the finale they bring out a basket of marshmallows, pieces of cake, pineapples, apples, bananas and cherries to dip in a warm bowl of chocolate.  They first set the top of the chocolate on fire so you can roast the marshmallows.   Also for those that love wine, Geja's has a variety of different  wines to have with your meal.  You have the option of buying a glass or a bottle.  Bottles range from $40-$100+ dollars while a glass can cost you $6-$16 dollars.  This place blows The melting Pot out of the water.  If you are looking for a very romantic dinner whether a first date or married for years, please try this place.  It is very unique and highly suggested!!!",0.9924,0.865,0.127,0.008,0.5525877192982456

This normally would not be an issue, but if you opt to go with chicken or fish as your main course, then seeing if it's completely cooked is crucial. The ventilation is poor, so prepare for it to be warm and a strong smell from the friers. Caution, the booths are hard and cramped. As several others have mentioned,  the price is out-of-hand for what you get. A couple can easily spend one-hundred on their meal and leave unsatisfied.

2012-04-24,5.0,"I think once your dinner lasts over 2 hours it transforms from a meal to an experience, which is the best was to categorize dinner at Geja's.  My partner and I decided to go for our anniversary, a friend had told me that this place was phenomenal (and we happened to find a Groupon a few months ago!), so we decided that this would be the perfect place to celebrate our anniversary.  To start with the atmosphere--it was *dark* which I know other reviews have mentioned, and this definitely adds to the romantic feel. There are lots of candles, dim lights, and (of course!) plenty of sternos glowing throughout the restaurant. I will make the remark that the place had a little bit of a funny smell when we walked in--a little seafood-ish, which is not my favorite smell, but as time went on, that was overcome by scents of chocolate, so we definitely got used to the place. My biggest complaint about the atmosphere though is that the tables were all too close together. Both where we were sitting (I felt like I was sitting in on the the date of the couple at the table next to us) and when I had to walk through the maze of the restaurant to the bathroom. I really felt like I was walking through other people's meals--it was a bit crowded. Once we sat down, we were met by our very helpful, very nice waitress who walked us through the entire menu (both food and wine) and really helped us make a decision about what we wanted. My partner and I each did a premiere meal (entree plus cheese fondue plus chocolate fondue for dessert). We also had some trouble deciding on which wine was right for us--the waitress was really  helpful and gave us a taste of both wines we were choosing between, and really helped us make a good decision. :-) The starting course--cheese fondue (and salad) was really good. I loved the cheese and they had some fruits and breads to eat it with. It was wonderful.  When it was time for our entrees (which included beef, shrimp, chicken, scallops, lobster and a bunch of vegetables), the waitress was very helpful in giving us a quick overview of how long to cook our food, which was very much appreciated. She was also great in giving us a quick overview of the etiquette and safety procedures for not burning ourselves. She was very helpful. Once we started eating, it was all amazing. The portions seem a little small, but by the time we finished eating, I was stuffed! All of the food was great. I did end up leaving my phone on the table to check the time periodically to see how long I was cooking everything (the idea of eating undercooked seafood or chicken kind of freaks me out...).  All the food was great though--the food also comes with 8 dipping sauces. Some of them were great--there was a red chili sauce that tasted great with everything (especially the shrimp) and they had a Geja's sauce that was spicy and delicious. A dill sauce that tasted great on the veggies, and a BBQ sauce that was perfect for the chicken. Basically, everything was great. The dessert course was marvelous--they bring out the chocolate and flambe it for you at the table so that you can roast a marshmallow to start the course--it was adorable! The chocolate was amazing, but by the time it came out I was so stuffed from the entree that I could barely eat, but of course I had to force myself to eat some chocolate! Overall, this was a wonderful experience. It was definitely pricey (and looking over the wine list especially, I was worried about a little bit of price inflation--this is pretty standard at most places, but some of the bottles of wine were a bit overly pricey...). Although it's not a cheap meal, it was definitely worth it. It made for a special night with a meal that was a bit different. My partner and I really enjoyed ourselves. I am very happy we went--it will probably be awhile until we go back, but definitely an experience I will have to try again.

Between the wine-bottle decor, low-but-sufficient candlelight, and live spanish guitar, the place oozes romance. Based on other reviews, I specifically requested a booth, which offered us lots of intimate privacy (at least visually -- I could hear conversation from the booth behind us pretty clearly, but not to the point of being bothersome), but looking out at the regular tables they didn't seem as crowded as other reviews had made them out to be anyway. Bonus: They had a nice card waiting on our table for our anniversary :-). Food was excellent. We both ordered premiere dinners, with come with a salad, cheese fondue, an main (oil) course with meat, veggies, and dipping sauces, and chocolate fondue for dessert. I think the cheese fondue was the highlight -- a delightful blend of gruyere and swiss with a basket of breads and fruits. The steak, chicken, shrimp, and lobster in our main course were all excellent. I didn't find most of the dipping sauces all they are talked up to be, but a few of them were particularly good and that's all you need. I'm a weirdo who doesn't care for chocolate, but my girlfriend loved the dark chocolate dessert. They initially ignite the chocolate fondue so you can roast a marshmallow on it and make s'mores, which I thought was a nice touch that added to the romance and novelty of the experience. The strawberries in the dessert basket were bland but the other treats were fine. Even without eating much dessert, I was stuffed to the gills by the end -- while the meat portions of the main course had looked small initially, once everything starts adding up in your stomach the meal proves quite a lot. Service could not have been better. Our waitress was friendly and helpful in walking us through the whole meal, and she helped us pick out the perfect bottle of wine despite my complete ignorance on the subject. Even the busboy was adorable and charming. My only complaint about Geja's is that the prices, straight off the menu, are pretty high for what you get. Yeah, the food is excellent and there is enough of it to utterly stuff you, but the meal component that really merits sky-high prices -- the meat -- makes up a relatively small proportion of the meal. As much as I enjoyed the meal, if I had to pay full price I think I would have considered it unreasonable. Fortunately, Geja's offers coupons and specials very regularly. At least right now, you get a $25 coupon for liking their Facebook page, and they advertise other promotions on the Facebook page as well. If you sign up for their newsletter, it seems they email you coupons of similar value frequently. With $25-30 off I think the place is worth it for a romantic occasion.

Geja's isn't the first overpriced place we went.  It was just absurdly fake, just selling this idea of fondue as some exotic thing, wrapping it all in a ""romantic"" glaze.  And at some point, looking at the rest of the people in the room, you start wondering how many of them actually enjoy their meal and how many just pretend so not to disappoint their friend/date who chose this place, because , again, it's  so romantic.",0.9868,0.831,0.133,0.036,0.523045267489712

Good tip - get on their email list.  They send out incredible deals ($20.12 per Premier Dinner in January 2012, $35 premier dinners in March 2012 if you present the coupon on your phone) and they never make you feel like a criminal for using them.",0.9068,0.76,0.159,0.081,0.4831168831168831
2012-03-08,4.0,"This was my restaurant of choice for restaurant week. I've been wanting to come here for a long time, but Geja's is a special occasion type of restaurant. I decided to go with the chicken & beef, the bf had the chicken & shrimp.  The first course was the bread & fruits with cheese fondue & a salad. I really liked this course. I would take a bite of the salad and than a bite of bread dipped in cheese. Super yummy. The second course was the veggies and meat. It was a little hard keeping track of everything that we put in the pot of oil, but it was fun. It came with 11 different sauces. My fave were the bbq, dill, and some spicy sauce. My favorite course was the chocolate fondue. I'm not going to go into detail since most reviewers have. The reason why Geja's doesn't get 5 stars from me are the fact that the cocktails were weak and very small. I had a martini and it was the weakest and smallest martini I've ever had. If I'm spending $12 for a drink I expect it to pack a punch. I had another drink that I can't remember and it was weak and small too.

Went out for a date night during restaurant week and took advantage of the seafood menu.  Started out with a basic salad, then an appetizer fondue course wtih fruit and bread to dip in a cognac gruyere sauce.  Who knew that grapes dipped in gruyere was the most amazing combo?! The seafood platter was massive!  The restaurant week menu was intended to be ordered individually, so we got 2 seafood platters... it was enough food for 4!  Shrimp, scallops and lobster that we ""fondued"" in oil, then dipped in our selection of 12 dipping sauces.  The seafood was delicious and the waiter gave good instructions on how long to cook things for and how to use ""anchor vegetables"" to prevent your seafood from slipping off into the fondue pot. The dessert course was a brandy chocolate sauce with a mixture of fruits, marshmellows and poundcake for the dipping.  They included a little pot of crushed graham crackers so you could make s'mores, which was really fun. The wine menu was solid - we enjoyed a bottle of the Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc.  Even though we went during restaurant week, we walked out of there $175 in the hole! The ambiance of the place is really nice - lots of sectioned off little rooms and alcoves, which makes it ideal for a date night.   I enjoyed my dining experience thoroughly, but given the novelty of the concept and overall expense, I doubt I'll be going back any time soon.  More likely you'll find me at the library researching how to start my own fondue restaurant.  Really wish I had jumped on that trend back int he 70's... this place must make a killing!",0.8996,0.864,0.098,0.038,0.5169642857142857
2012-03-01,3.0,"I was really struggling with the 3 or 4 star rating, but unfortunately I had to round down. My date and I tried Geja's during Restaurant Week this year.  Overall, I had a really great time, but I think it is just a tad pricey for a dining experience. Let's start with the things I loved. The very dim-lit ambiance was a little drastic at first, but once our eyes adjusted, we ended up embracing it. It set quite a romantic feel, and everywhere I looked there seemed to be couples. The fire truly looked beautiful against the dark background, but again, it was a little strange to experience all of this at 4:30pm. Everything from the vegetables to the dessert was extremely fresh, and quite tasty. My personal favorites were the Sweet Chili dipping sauce, shrimp, aged beef, and of course, the entire chocolate fondue dessert spread. It was truly phenomenal. Now onto the things I wasn't so crazy about...the cheese fondue appetizer was just a bit too rich for my taste pallet. I could only enjoy a few pieces of fruit and bread with it, and overall a disappointment. The main course seemed a bit small in size. Also, after I learned the boiling pot of liquid that we used to cook our meats and vegetables in was soybean oil, I'm not quite sure if my metabolism is my friend anymore. Again I want to emphasize, I had a wonderful time at Geja's and a fabulous date doesn't hurt either. However, they really could be much more generous on their entree portions, especially for the amount they charge. With that said, when you think of Geja's, think dessert-only!",0.9966,0.711,0.236,0.053,0.5297067901234569
2012-03-01,4.0,"A very enjoyable experience, buoyed up exceptionally well by the staff and ambiance. As mentioned in an earlier review for this venue, ordering one appetizer (the chocolate and cheese one) and one main course will satisfy a party of two easily and, with a few glasses of wine, will keep your tab in the low three figures.  The food is fresh and well presented, though of course, how well it's cooked is strictly up to you.  It did take me a few times to get the tenderloin to the right level of medium rare. About the ambiance.  You might have heard this place is dark.  While still light enough to see people on the other side of the room, the illumination is definitely set to ""intimate.""  We had piped music - a simple guitar - which added to the calmness and coolness.  And, as mentioned, the staff - both in the bar and on the floor - were genuine and attentive. The only thing preventing me from giving this 5 stars was that the restaurant feels like an experience, and not one that I, personally, would have to have repeatedly.  It's a good experience, mind you, and ideal for quiet nights out.  But just not enough to want to return in a week or month or a few months. P.S. Do not bring kids.  They (and presumably you with them) will be turned away.  This is firmly an adult establishment.",0.9845,0.829,0.148,0.022,0.5302806122448981
2012-02-28,3.0,"I love fondue. I grew up eating the stuff. In our household it wasn't considered fine dining. It was more like a quick and inexpensive way to feed the whole family when mom didn't feel like cooking a huge dinner. When I found out that Geja's was a fancy fondue spot, I was really excited to see how they might elevate such a simple dish. Sadly, the experience and food just do not justify the price. Before I get into the specifics of my experience, let me preface my review by saying I came here during Restaurant Week. If you've never heard of it, RW is simply a week in February when many Chicago restaurants create special price fixe menus. For $33 or $44 (per person) you can sample signature dishes and try new places you wouldn't normally eat at. First the good news. The fondue is savory. From the cheese appetizer, to the meat-heavy main course, and chocolate dessert, Geja's left nothing to desire. The highlight of the meal were the 8 different sauces, each one better than the last. The other thing I found Geja's did well was to create a romantic atmosphere. The place is seriously dark, and the flickering blue flames of the fondue pots make for an intimate and beautiful setting.  But everything came crashing back to reality when we got the bill. The total bill for two was $75 after RW discount. Drinks not included. Yikes! I am all about paying top dollar for a chef to prepare a world class dinner. But... this was just sliced up raw meat and veggies on a plate. Mom was right, fondue is not that fancy.",0.9839,0.832,0.14,0.029,0.4907832066922975

2012-02-27,4.0,"Delicious. Came here for Restaurant Week and was not disappointed. Ambiance is so nice. Dimly lit, romantic and very relaxing (which is good because you will be there for a couple hours). Food is very good. The Restaurant Week menu included a salad, cheese fondue app, a selection of meats for the entree and a chocolate fondue dessert. The cheese wasn't my favorite (found it to be a bit gritty in texture), but the husband really liked it. I ended up eating some of the bread, apples and grapes without cheese and was happy with that. The salad was good, but the lettuce at the end was soaked in the vinaigrette, so I would request light dressing next time. Entree was awesome. Almost perfect portion of meat and veggies for the two of us - only had a couple of pieces of chicken and veggies left between us. Husband had shrimp, beef and chicken; I had chicken and beef. Very good (especially the choices of sauces) and directions were clear - even for a fondue newbie like myself :) Dessert is where it's at. Fresh strawberries, pineapple and bananas, as well as pound cake, marshmallows and rice krispies (meh). Be sure to save room! I'd go again. Yes, it's a bit pricy, but you get very fresh ingredients and will have a great time. Service was very relaxed and non-pushy, though I wish we could have moved through the process a bit faster. You will smell disgusting afterward, so make sure you have some Febreeze on hand at home if you don't want to wash/dry clean everything you wore at Geja's!",0.9982,0.681,0.296,0.023,0.7344444444444445
2012-02-24,4.0,"Been here twice - loved it both times. First time we ordered way too much food and were very uncomfortably full (like I made my husband sit at the table for 30 minutes after our meal until I could move) but the second time we knew the perfect amount of food to order.  The first time my husband and I each ordered a premier fondue dinner, which comes with a cheese fondue appetizer, salad, your entree with oil for cooking, and chocolate fondue for dessert. This was way too much, we could barely ever touch the chocolate by the end (and i can eat with the best of them). So here's the perfect amount of food that you still won't be able to finish it all but won't be uncomfortably full. Order 1 premier dinner and then an order of cheese and chocolate fondue for the second person. Also, I recommend asking for broth instead of oil to cook your food. It doesn't taste any different and everything is less greasy and you don't get oil all over your plate (and maybe yourself). As far as the food goes, I think everything was great. Now you could probably replicate a lot this meal at home if you really wanted to but a lot of what you're paying for is the ambiance. The salad was very good but, of all the courses, was my least favorite. The cheese fondue is just amazing. I would be happy if my entire meal was cheese fondue. You get apples, grapes, and bread for dipping. I think the cheese fondue is the best part of the whole meal but I also really like cheese. A lot. For entrees, I've gotten the deluxe seafood entree both times and it's delicious. You get lobster, shrimp, and scallops. They give you 8 different dipping sauces as well, so it's fun to try them all. It might look like you don't get very much meat, especially if you split an entree, like I recommend, but they also give you a ton of vegetables (which taste great in the dipping sauces) and you still have a huge dessert coming. Dessert is chocolate fondue with a variety of fruit, pound cake, and marshmallows. All very good. They flambe the chocolate and you get to roast marshmallows in the flame until it burns out.  I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but love fruit and marshmallows, so I was happy. Any chocolate lover would absolutely love this dessert. This is definitely a very intimate, dimly lit restaurant meant for a celebration or romantic dinner date. The fun of this place is the experience. The service was great and I never felt rushed or ignored. They have no problem delaying courses to give you time to let your food digest, as I heard a lot of people ask (I'm telling you people, it's A LOT of food). Overall, definitely a great date spot!",0.9992,0.724,0.24,0.036,0.5663194444444445

2012-02-22,5.0,"My boyfriend and I went here last night for our anniversary. I've never written a Yelp review before but this place was so good I was inspired. We had a Groupon for $30 off, but even without it I would go back for a special occasion since the quality of the food and the overall experience were worth the price. I'll admit my favorite food groups are cheese, chocolate, and fruit, so perhaps I'm a bit biased, but if you like fondue, I'd definitely recommend this place. We both ordered the beef and scallop combo, which came with a salad with a nice dressing, cheese fondue (with fresh fruit and bread), meat and veggies, chocolate fondue (includes flames at the beginning for roasting marshmallows for s'mores), and coffee. We also got a bottle of Geja's Chardonnay, which went really well with our meal. I only ate half of the salad to save room for the other three courses, but in the future I would only have a couple bites, since I was borderline uncomfortably full after finishing dessert.  The quality of all the ingredients was top-notch, the service was excellent (fast, helpful, but not overbearing), the ambiance was romantic and cozy with pleasant music in the background and mood lighting (but not too dark in my opinion). I really enjoyed having 8 different dipping sauces with our main course. It was such fun to try out every conceivable combination of veggies/scallops/steak and sauce. Every bite was a delicious gustatory adventure. I'm glad we decided to go with a combo instead of just the cheese/chocolate deal, since the cheese was more of an appetizer and not really a main dinner course. They also had a Happy Anniversary card waiting on our table for us when we arrived. Such a sweet gesture. As other reviewers have noted, the place does have a slight aroma of oil when you first walk in, but we got used to it quickly and no longer noticed it or cared since the food and wine were so good.

And if you go get the cheese and chocolate fondue, its the best thing on the menu. The other offerings are just OK  in my opinion (the meats and seafood) as you cook them in oil, the flavor doesn't really shine through. We ordered the meat, seafood and veggies on our first visit. There are other fondue places where you cook the meats and veggies in a flavored broth which I think is more tasty. But all things considered if you order the cheese and chocolate fondue and a nice bottle of wine it is not only delicious but also a good value. We not only ate well on Valentines Day but escaped with a bill under $100 with gratuity! Our server was very nice and knowledgeable about the food and the wines although she did have a bit of trouble keeping the Sterno lit.  The atmosphere is very intimate and romantic. The tables are very closely placed so it can be a bit uncomfortable navigating your way to the restroom.

2012-02-13,4.0,"Good for a fancy romantic dinner. I am giving this place four stars as an average of three and five from me and girlfriend. The meat/seafood was good quality. But, your basically cooking it in oil and deep frying all the great flavor right out of it. Everything is cooked by you, which is kind of cool, but not really. One thing I did like was all the condiments to pair with the food. I love my condiments so this was right up my alley. The chocolate dessert pot was the best part for me. I had a frangelichino to accompany that, which was amazing. I feel the food is over priced. I don't mind dishing out that much money for a nice meal for the experience, but i feel I should be a little more happy with the actual food. The cuts of meat are great, its just the way they are prepared that bothers me. Maybe I should have tried the broth they offer instead of the oil. We got the most expensive meat/seafood combo, so maybe that is why it was so expensive. Although, I don't see much of an alternative on the menu without feeling like I'm missing out on something.

It's definitely on the pricey side but the food and experience is worth it. I especially loved the 8 dips that came with the entree...and the sangria was also pretty good.

I was looking for something fun, a little different than the usual steak/seafood situation. He LOVED it. Geja's, I owe you one.  The ambiance is so unique - I can't even think of a place that compares, it's like a romantic, unmorbid catacombs. It's not trendy or fancy, its old school chicago romance. Does it really get any better than that? The place was a little overly blinged out for the upcoming valentine's day, but so is the entire city.  After doing my yelp due diligence, we ordered the prince geja's to share but went with the oil because it was pretty late and apparently the broth takes longer to cook the meat, but definitely want to try it next time. The house bottle of cab was A-MAH-ZING. Such a nice, affordably-price little surprise. The service was attentive yet scarce, my favorite! First, the cheese is fantastic - i love gruyere. I could do with a larger serving of fruits in the basket, but the pumpernickel bread was also a winner. We literally finished the whole thing. The salads, meh, probably my low point of the meal. Just lettuce, great dressing but not enough of it.  Second, when we first got the dish I was concerned we didn't have enough food, two pieces each of chicken, steak, shrimp, scallops and lobster and a smattering of veggies. In the end, I was wrong - we were both satisfied and didn't feel stuffed after dessert. The shrimp, scallops and steak were MOUTHWATERING. If I return, I'd order a dish without chicken and lobster - chicken is just boring and it can be tricky to cook lobster to perfection on a sterno - It came out a little tough both times. The vegetables were all great, I was tempted to order the additional veggie tray.  The sauce deserves its own shout out. There is nothing in life i like more than sauce. So much variety! So delicious! They offer everything from dill to chili to bernaise to herb-butter.  Following dinner, which was lovely, the flambe chocolate continued to wow us. The marshmallow smore situation was a little tricky, but the bananas and strawberries were hands down the best. Again, I wish they had put a little more in the basket - only two of each, I'd have gone with more banana and less apple/pineapple. Overall, it was incredibly fun - makes for a very interactive meal, and you're not going to find a more romantic, cozy location. Fondue is fondue, in my eyes - while the melting pot might have more to offer in terms of choices, which is probably my only complaint with Geja's, I'm always going to pick ambiance and great wine over a chain restaurant on State street.",0.9986,0.751,0.21,0.039,0.5703703703703703

My boyfriend had never tried fondue (!?) and I was curious to see what else was out there beyond Melting Pot. At over 500 reviews, I was very curious to go here. ""I want to try fondue sometime!"" ""OK how about tonight we do fondue?"" ""If your plans fall through, want to get fondue?"" My boyfriend said all of those and we still hadn't gone. Then the other day I saw a Groupon for Geja's. Sold! By the time I noticed it, their $25 for $50 was sold out, so I opted for the $30 for $60 worth of fondue and wine, a better choice in the end. So, parking around here is difficult to find. If you can't, I saw a parking garage near the PNC (I forget the street), and Geja's will valet for $10. Upon walking in, we were warmly greeted and given the option to check our coats (Free!). As many of the reviews say, this place is ro-man-TIC! Small, cozy, dimly-lit...I personally love that. Combined with the flamenco guitar player taking me back to my days of living in Spain, and I was already ready for a great dinner. I chose to have a glass of the Spanish rioja while the BF got some African sweet shiraz. After two glasses, I went to the bathroom. There's a step, so when I stepped out, I fell out. The bartender was chatting with a server and they totally judged me...so be warned! Anyway on to the food. I was starving, but we chose to do the cheese and chocolate fondue. You're started with a salad, and when we finished that, they set up the cheese fondue. I was stuffed halfway through. You get apples, grapes and two types of bread. When we were nearly done, they offered to bring us more to eat - we got more apples. Already full, we moved on to chocolate. DELISH. You get marshmallows, the first of which they start to roast campfire-style and give you crushed graham cracker crumbs to make your own modern s'mores. You also get bananas, strawberries and pound cake. I had to be rolled outta there. Sign up for their e-mails and you'll get $25 off for the next time you visit. Also, our server was a doll. I believe her name was Tracy? I can't wait until to go back! The BF said he wants to try their full dinner but honestly, I don't know if I could eat that much unless I pace myself...and when it's that delicious, it sure is hard to pace yourself!",0.9589,0.886,0.08,0.035,0.500997150997151

The cheese fondue is amazing.  It was a delicious combination of spices and cheese, but the Gruyere and nutmeg really stood out.  It was the highlight of the meal.  The vegetables and meat were fresh, crispy and delicious. I really liked that they gave us a variety of sauces to dip them in.  Dessert was very fun.  They give you a flame with which you may roast marshmallows, and then dip them in the chocolate.  The fruit, like the veggies, were fresh and tasted good.   The wine list is very unpretentious.  In fact, it is downright user-friendly.   I give this restaurant 4 out of 5 stars.  The prices are a bit much, but the service was great and everything was well-prepared, fresh and generally met my expectations.   Quick Notes: Gejas does *not* wreak of oil The cheese fondue is Gruyere (not some *weird* taste) Bread served with fondue is *supposes* to be slightly crunchy/crispy instead of soft When using a Groupon you *always* tip on the pre-discounted amount",0.9938,0.772,0.222,0.006,0.5904710144927536

Started with valet parking ($10) but there is a TON of meter parking along Clark if it is not too cold to walk.  Met our friends in the bar where they had already started on a glass of bubbly and a sangria.  Before we could even order our drinks, the hostess came to seat us (which was good, actually, because the bar is not terribly large).  Snuggled into a booth, the incredibly entertaining busman lit the cheese fondue flame WITH HIS FINGER.  Cool, but kids, don't try this at home.  We had another round of sangria and ordered an inexpensive red from Argentina suggested by the waitress.  It was tasty and an excellent suggestion. Cheese fondue starter was good, especially on what was a very cold night.  For the main course, we had beef and lobster with all sorts of veggies.  Sauces were very good, especially the spicier ones.  Service was prompt without interrupting either our meal or conversation.  It was all super enjoyable. Suggestion, then?  This is a great place for romance, but it ALSO a great place for couples on a double date.  Intimate and cozy so conversation is easy, cooking your own in fondue provides its own entertainment, and roasting marshmallows for a quick Gejas S'more is a great finale.  So was the coffee and Frangelico.   Advice?  Don't wear a freshly-laundered suit or sweater - the oil you will be cooking in creates a certain aroma that will follow you home...",0.9981,0.732,0.268,0.0,0.6441666666666667

The food here is beautiful.  I've done the fondue on multiple occasions but I prefer ordering off their regular menu unless I'm with a larger group.  My reasons are personal as in ""I will risk burning my tongue licking the bottom of the fondue pot to get every last bit of cheese"" versus a quality issue.  The fondue is spectacular, delightful, enchanting cheese wafting out of quaint little pots for you to dip your sticks into with the protein of your choice.  But its dangerous.  As in no control and I might stab someone if they try to block my dip dangerous. The wine list here is EPIC.  Seriously one of the least pretentious and well thought out wine lists in town.  There I said it.  And if you are a smart cookie, you will dine during their Wine Festival where there are bargains to be had.  And if you are an incurable romantic, you can catch a carriage ride during certain ""lovey"" holidays like that Vday that shall remain nameless.

Here, we didn't pick the cheese, it was too salty and tasted bad and it was premixed and not fresh. The bread not tasty nor fresh, grapes ok, apples eeeh. no veggies! *The meat: I don't have any complain about the meat quality, there were the same at both places, BUT in melting pot you choose your broth and the guy again makes it in front of you. Here it was already in there before we sit and it was water and oil I guess! nothing tasty and you had to use the various dips to make the seafood and meat tasty. which makes you think why are you even here you could do this in home with brand dips and seasoning sauces! *The chocolate: Again, you have options in melting pot, we chose dark chocolate and Irish cream. It was very delicious with great marsh mellows, rice chips, and fresh fruits. Here, the chocolate was really bad and watery, some crappy cake cubes, and the pineapples weren't even peeled and not cut all the way.

Be sure to request a booth so you have more space since the table and chairs are kind of cramped. We both had premier dinners. I had the beef and scallops and my husband had beef with shrimp and lobster. The cheese fondue was tasty and made for a really nice appetizer. I wish that there had been a bit more bread to dip but I guess they don't want you getting too full before your entree arrives. Now for the meat and fish. They bring you a platter of your raw meat as well as raw veggies and dipping sauces. You place the meat and veggies on skewers and cook it in the hot oil and then you dip it in the sauces. It was very tasty but it seemed like there wasn't that much meat. The scallops were definitely the highlight. They also give you 8 dipping sauces so it adds a little flavor since otherwise the meat isn't marinated and is cooked in plain oil, so the sauce is kind of necessary. Then came the chocolate fondue for dessert.  It was good, although a bit too sweet. The strawberries that came with it looked kind of sad, but I guess it's not really strawberry season right now. It was fun to cook the marshmallows over the flame though. I think I would have preferred if they had given us whole graham crackers instead of graham cracker crumbs to make s'mores.

We tried the broth this time instead of the oil since we always come home smelling like it. You need to cook for twice as long, to make sure we didnt overcook we used our cell phone timers.  It was good except I tried most of the food without sauces and realized the lobster quality was very poor, probably a warm water lobster. For the price and portion they should be able to afford quality lobster that you don't need to cover in sauce. The recommended time in lobster was 4 minutes, tough lobster, so i tried cooking it for 3,2,1 minutes. Nope, still tasted awful  The potatoes also were awful unless you dipped em in sauce. Guess the sauces are a good cover for poor quality. I don't eat meat so I don't know how the quality is.nDowngrade from 5 stars.  Service 5 stars.",0.3133,0.82,0.099,0.081,0.655940170940171

This is the best fondue, great salad, cheese, quality of meats/seafood, deserts and the dipping sauces are by far the best. I won't even go to the Melting Pot anymore. As for those that say Geja's is a rip off, the Melting Pot is actually MORE expensive and the quality does not compare. I have been coming here for over 10 years now and I have never once had bad service! The staff is always friendly and willing to accommodate. I moved away from Chicago and every time I come home, I make it a point to go to Geja's .  It also has a great atmosphere, it's not as dark as some other reviews say.. I definetly can see people, but it is a bit on the dimmer side, lit by candles and amber lights. To me, this adds to the romantic element of the place. It is very small, so that may be why some say it ""smells"" like grease.. they use oil for the main course of the fondue, so the later you come, the stronger the sent may be.. just from so many pots cooking all night. I don't find it overpowering or unpleasant. There is only 1 bathroom per male and female, so come prepared to wait for that.

It felt more intimate due to the low lighting. We greatly enjoyed our meal and it was definitely enough food to leave full. Our service was amazing, as our server provided us with all kinds of tips and recommendations from how to cook the food to wine suggestions.  The restaurant as expected is a little pricey, but we had a groupon that we had saved for the occasion so our food was totally worth what we paid.

Service was fantastic.  We had an early (5pm) reservation, and I requested a booth when I placed it on OpenTable.  They let us in right at 5 and led us to a booth, which was super quiet and private even with another couple seated behind us.  Our server was nice and really helpful, and everything was cleared right as we were done and the next course brought promptly.  I am a server, and I really appreciated how he was always available when we needed him but not overbearing.  Once we were done with desert, he brought us the check but didn't make us feel rushed to leave, which was nice.  They also set the desert plates on the same side of the table after they saw that I had moved over to my date's side of the booth after dinner, so I didn't have to move them myself.  All in all it was a really romantic, relaxed experience.  It's really a great spot for a date. Oh, and my date and I thought we would hate live music while we were eating, as it usually tends to be overbearing, but it was actually really nice.  My date didn't even notice it was live until like halfway through the meal, it was that unobtrusive.  We also definitely didn't leave smelling like oil, which seems to be a common complaint on here, but maybe that had something to do with the fact that we had an earlier reservation.",0.9981,0.756,0.213,0.031,0.5755835667600373

I have always been dying to go here and my girlfriend and i got a groupon so we hit it up. First off you only get one choice of cheese for your fondue which is some type of swiss, brie combo. I am not a fan of swiss but it wasn't horrible, it was very intense but good. You do not get a choice of broth/oil to cook your food in so even though the food they bring was very fresh, it had no flavor and you HAD to dip it in one of the sauces. The reason they are getting such a low score is not the food, nor the service, which was actually pretty decent, but the seating. We were about 5 inches from the guitar player seated on a raised platform. This not only made it difficult to hear each other but it was very awkward knowing that the guy is able to hear every word we say. The seating arrangement's are absolutely horrible and you are at such a tiny table that it makes it difficult to eat.  If you are into dessert fondue, its not horrible but again you only get the one option of dark chocolate with a light orange rum that they burn off. They sent us a $25 coupon and we wont be back to use it. On top of everything, i think their food is way way over priced.

2011-08-19,3.0,"Preface: I should note that I made my reservation using  savored.com  which allowed for us to take 30% off our entire food and drink bill. The server handled this perfectly and brought out the pre-discount bill as well as the discounted bill so we were able to tip on the full amount (we left more than 20%, BTW). As I write this I am wondering if the hostess was rude to me because I made my reservation using that service, which the restaurant voluntarily participates in. I really hope that she was just having a bad night. If you read my other reviews, I really don't complain. I was really taken aback last night though.  It's 8:26PM. Candice G., Dana G. and I were desperately trying to hail a cab to make it to our 8:30PM reservation at Gejas. No cabs in sight. Crap. I get on my phone right away at 8:26PM and apologetically let the hostess know that we were running approx 10-15 minutes late just as a cab rolls up for us to hop into. It is important for you to know that I hate being late for anything - it is rude and I do everything I can to be 5 minutes early or right on time no matter where I go. I also understand that at busy restaurants, late arrivals can ruin their whole schedule and cause issues. Therefore, anytime I am going to be late for a reservation at a restaurant (even 5 minutes), busy or not, I always call to let them know the situation and 99% of the time they are really appreciative of the phone call and very accommodating. Well, I guess Gejas prefers people not to call and fall into that 1% other category because when I called to explain my situation, I was scolded by the person who answered the phone and told in a rude tone that I was clearly going to be more than 10 minutes late and I needed to call back again once I was closer. I calmly stated that we were getting into a cab in River North and would be there in 10 minutes as I once again apologized for the inconvenience.  We arrived precisely at 8:38PM, walking triumphantly to the hostess stand to announce our arrival. The look of shock on her face at our arrival EARLIER than my ETA was priceless. I love proving rude people wrong.  Unfortunately, this conversation/interaction set a bad tone for how this meal might end up playing out for August 2011 Gurrls Nite. However, our server saved the day by treating us with respect and kindness.  Our server arrived and she explained the fondue menu and how the whole experience would work. She was knowledgeable about the wine selection (we picked out a half price bottle of Chenin Blanc which was light, smooth and a nice compliment to the meal) and attentive - she definitely saved our evening from going down the tubes. She clearly explained how to properly cook everything and got our marshmallows roasting at the end perfectly.  This was my second time doing fondue and I have decided that if I ever do fondue again, it will be for the appetizer and dessert courses only. This is due to the fact that it takes quite a long time to cook all of the food and it can be quite tedious when the veggies refuse to stay on the skewer. +'s of this experience:  +Service was excellent  +Live Guitar Music was soothing and not distracting  +High Quality Food  +Chocolate Fondue  +Roasted Marshmallows  +Chocolate Fondue  +Strawberries  +Chocolate Fondue  (yes, I loved the chocolate fondue. Had there been a spoon on the table......well I'm sure you can imagine what I might have started doing)  -'s of this experience:  -Hostess tone of voice  -My hair/clothes still smell like Gejas (the oil has a way of permeating through everything)  This would have been a Four Star Review if not for my experience with the phone call. Maybe I should have just showed up 10 minutes late without calling. Who knows? To me, customer service is a huge aspect of any business, especially a dining experience. We could stay home and cook our own food, but we choose to go out and spend considerable money to eat in their fine establishment only to be scolded. Contact with the Hostess is a person's first impression of a place - I think that experience at Gejas could have been better.",0.9734,0.865,0.091,0.044,0.5850783068783069
2011-08-12,4.0,"So my boyfriend took me here on Monday to celebrate our anniversary. I had heard of Geja's but never had the chance to go. We get there a few minutes earlier than our 9pm reservation, and were told that we had to wait at the bar. There was a small table nearby so we sat there and got drinks, pineapple infused vodka for me, strawberry mojito for me. The restaurant is not as big as I'd imagined, and with the dark wood, dim lighting and flamenco guitar, (which that night happened to be live), makes it feel very intimate and romantic. After waiting about 20 minutes, the boyfriend and I were led to our table, and we opted to sit on the same side of the table so we could enjoy the view of the windows. We ordered the International, which was beef, chicken, shrimp and veggies, and it came with a cheese course, and a salad. The salad came out first, and it was simply greens tossed in a vinaigrette topped with cucumbers and some other veggies. Not memorable. However, the combination of swiss, guyere and another cheese in that first pot, combined with the different breads, fruits and veggies was great. We had a little trouble seeing what was there because of the darkness, but it almost didn't even matter because it was just yummy. After nibbling on that, the time came for the main course, and we happily dug in. With the flamenco guitar playing right across from us, I was afraid it would be too loud to hear or make declarations of the sentimental kind, but it wasn't. Boyfriend got full off the main course, so I ate a nice portion of the chocolate course myself...which is fine with me as I love sweets. Him, not so much. I love the idea of fondue, and I loved the experience of Geja's. It's more like eating in the middle of romance...and boyfriend got major points for bringing me here. The blingy ring I got too...that was even more major.",0.9966,0.801,0.179,0.02,0.528199767711963
2011-08-10,4.0,"When I need to feel better, I buy a dress, or a pair of shoes. When I am recovering from a break-up, and desperately in need of a great pick-me-up, I take my girlfriend out to Geja's. Geja's and I go way back. I have heard, from many people and sources that it is the most romantic restaurant in Chicago, and it seemed to me that lots of gentlemen picked this place to propose. I have been in love with Geja's since the moment I visited their website, and I dreamed of a romantic dinner here. Who would ever thought I'd pick this place to get over someone. Ohhh the irony in life! But hey, let me tell you, whatever your purpose of coming here is, Geja's will help you complete it. Reservation is required - yes, they say highly recommended - but if you really want to eat here, make a reservation, and make it a week in advance.  I arrived before my reservation time, and waited outside. The place was popping for a Wednesday night. As soon as my friend arrived, we were seated. Now I have spent more than enough time looking at (and drooling) over their menu, so I knew what I was going to get. My friend, who had been here before, also helped with her wise advises.  Instead of going with the traditional premier dinner, we decided to just go with the cheese and chocolate fondue, and put some vegetables with it. I won't go much into details about the fondue - but here's the truth: I'm Asian, I didn't grow up eating cheese. I like American, provolone and cheddar cheese, thats it. Sooooo, the cheese fondue was a little bit of an ""acquired taste"" for me. My friend, however, was in love with it (the second time around). The vegetable tray that we ordered extra was standard - but I'm glad I got it, because it made me feel a bit ""healthier"" after just eating melted cheese and bread.  Readers, if you make it this far into my rambling, please take note: stop eating the moment you feel like you're a bit full - because the cheese is just the beginning.  We didn't have the main course (the meat and veggie cooked in oil or broth), so we shifted straight to the chocolate fondue. It very good - but I mean how could it not be? It's fruits, pound cake and marshmallows dipped in CHOCOLATE!! By the end it was a bit too sweet for me, but I enjoyed it.  The little secret? If you are feeling fancy, order a bottle of wine. We got the Nivasco Brachetto - which was a sweet wine (girly I know), and it was delicious! The price is steep (I think 46 for that bottle), but hey, go big or go home! Also, another secret? Stop eating when you're just a bit full - because there are more than enough food.  I had such a nice time here. The hostesses were so nice. Our server, Tracy, was super friendly but not overbearing. She was informative, attentive and funny. The ambiance could have not been better - very romantic, intimate and cozy. The price? Prepare to pay 50-80 per person depends on how much you drink, but it's one of those place you need to try. Bring anyone special here, you'll be sure you have a good time.",0.9989,0.781,0.203,0.016,0.5392850417002959

2011-08-08,2.0,"Geja's is romantic. Dim lighting, candle-light, light guitar melodies wafting to and fro. Maybe it is all designed to distract from the dust and cob-webs on the walls and decorations. I was very put off by all the dust around our booth. It definitely killed the mood a little bit. Their white sangria was delicious, but it is sangria so you can't really mess that up. The red sangria was just okay. My date and I much preferred the white. I've been to the Melting Pot before and I have to say that I prefer the options of the Melting Pot a lot more than Geja's. First, the cheese fondue was not to my liking at all. It was too overwhelming after a couple of bites and I just ended up eating the fruit and bread by itself. I would have liked to have had an option as to what went into the cheese fondue---and I'm a big cheese lover, so this was very disappointing. As many others have mentioned, although the meat and veggies are fresh and of good quality, the meat/veggie fondue is not worth it at all. I would skip the meat all together. They use oil and not broth. I much preferred the Melting Pots option of broth or oil. I prefer the broth, but that's just me. My date was not impressed by the use of oil either. We both actually used the lemons provided and the pepper to marinade our meets before we cooked them in the oil to give the food some much needed flavor.  The chocolate fondue was nothing special, either. I make my own chocolate fondue at home and mine is much better. However, the service and atmosphere were wonderful.

It really doesn't matter but sometimes the camera flashes combined with all the mirrors on the walls gets a bit overwhelming. The cheese fondue is pretty good except that they use way too much cheddar. The cheddar overpowers the gruyere which is the more superior cheese. It's too bad that they don't just leave out the cheddar altogether.  The meat fondue is not worth it at all. If I did it again (which I won't), I would skip the meat all together. The problem is that they don't use broth, they use oil. Who deep-fries their meat and fish? The cuts were good but it was a huge waste to deep-fry lobster. They give a nice variety of dipping sauces; however, the butter dipping sauce is a disappointment.  The chocolate fondue was excellent. Also, the service and atmosphere were wonderful.

I don't eat meat, he does.   There was a table next to me that got a separate cheese pot because they had to bring their own gluten free bread.   And the strawberry mojito was tasty.

I.e it's nothing different from what you buy at the grocery store. And if anything is over or under cooked... Well that's your own fault but also part of the fun. The cheese fondue was very rich.. Too rich I think.. Could only eat a few bites before it was too overwhelming. Grapes and hot cheese- ick. Same with apples.  The 8 dipping sauces were good, but again, nothing house specialty- I can get this at a grocery store.  The choc fondue course was the coolest especially the flambé portion and the smores were sooo good- somehow better than those roasted at a campfire. They had a very nice selection of pound cake ad fruit- very good.  Price- I struggle with the value I'm getting ecause literally i could do this myself at home minus the ambiance.

The cheese fondue was pretty good and tasted wonderful with the fruit. The entree comes out on one big platter. On first looks, you would not think that it's a lot of food...but trust me you will get full since it is a slow dining experience. Between the two of us, we were able to sample everything except the chicken. The scallops were, in our opinion the best. I supposed the lobster would have been good also. Too bad we overcooked it each and every time! The entrees come with 10 different dipping sauces. I cant remember them all, but pay attention when your server makes suggestions because the suggested pairings are actually pretty good.  The flaming chocolate fondue was a great way to top of dinner. The best part were the marshmallows! So, in conclusion: 5 stars for the GREAT service and experience, but only 3.5 for the pricey, average food.

2011-06-24,1.0,"I have learned that I'm not a fondue person based on this experience. I must say that I am conflicted in saying that because I'm a total foodie, and appreciate all forms of cooking.  In a nutshell here are my issues. We were late for our reservation but the host said he would find a table for us...and he did...TWO HOURS later. At the hour mark we already had our car in valet ($12) and had invested too much time not to see the whole fondue experience through to the end. So we waited, and waited some more while nibbling on the cheese and crackers by the bar, which were in retrospect my favorite part of the meal!  Finally we were seated, however by then I was naseous from smelling the gross scent of oil for two hours. So the first course arrived, and it's important for you to know that I use gruyere all of the time, and this did not taste like gruyere. I'm not sure what it was exactly but I did not enjoy it. Then the oil came out, and maybe because I'm a germophobe, I felt completely grossed out by all of the raw meat and seafood on one plate. All I could think of was a deadly combo of e-coli and salmonella swimming around on the platter. Then the injuries occured...both my date and I were each burned by spattering hot oil. I quickly realized that I simply do not enjoy having all of my food deep fried...and my stomach let me know that quite powerfully later in the evening if you know what I mean.  Lastly the dessert came and besides the cheese and crackers at the bar, the roasted marshmallow were my second favorite part of the meal.  As far as this being one of the most romantic places in the city, I must vehemently disagree. The oily residue, the dustbunnies everywhere, and the raw food definitely did not come across as romantic to me. The first thing I did when I arrived home was to take a shower and wash that oily scent that stuck to me like a skunk right out of my hair!",-0.4121,0.865,0.063,0.073,0.5005445126768655

And after my experience with Geja's a couple weeks ago, I can say that Geja's is just that - an exceptional restaurant with great food and excellent service. Once you walk down those steps to the rustic hideaway, rest assured you will be taken care of.  Two nights before my bf's bday dinner, I went on Opentable to book a reservation for two (I know, woulda coulda shoulda planned ahead). After realizing the only available reservations are at 5PM or 9PM on the night of my bf's birthday dinner, I called the restaurant in desperation. Jeff (the owner?) was super nice and accommodating, after listening to me explain that the bf's surprise party is at 10PM and that we can't possibly make the 9PM res, he told me rest assured he will make it work for whatever time I needed. He even worked backwards with me to see how long it would take to get from my apt to the restaurant, from the restaurant to the party! Talk about dedication to his customers!  When we arrived, I was just glad we got a table. I had no idea Jeff also included a note in the reservation about preference for a curtained booth! I won't go into details about the decor or food since the previous posts give you a pretty good idea, but the service was amazing. The waiters were knowledgeable, helpful, and made sure we were done with one course before bringing out another. If I had it my way, I would probably have preferred the meat/veggies to be pre-seasoned and marinated before dunking it into the pot, but that's just personal preference. The eight dipping sauces offered plenty of flavor/variety. As the evening progressed, it became apparent the Geja's hospitality just goes on and on. The candle on top of a gratis chocolate drenched pound cake for the bday boy was a nice touch. When we figured out there was alcohol in the chocolate fondue (bf is allergic), we sent it back and the waiter quickly replaced it with a non-alcohol one without any fuss or question.  All in all, people come to Geja's for the romance and the experience (except for the four linebacker looking dudes squeezed into a tiny table, still not sure on that one). Fondue is just as much about the experience as it is about the food. While the food is good, fresh, and plenty, (it's fondue people, not Alinea) it's the experience that really makes this place 5 stars.

Yes, it is very romantic and you feel like you are in a different world.  However, the tables are very close together (a bit cramped) and it can be quite noisy for a romantic place.  We also got seated next to the guitar player.  At first I thought this was going to be a bad thing, but it ended up being one of the highlights.  He is amazingly talented (and it wasn't too loud).  Also our table was very small.  Our waitress had to put our wine bottle on the floor next to our feet.  Maybe its me, but that is a no-no.  Not only is the wine not in easy reach but I was really worried about it getting knocked over.  I think that contributed to the cramped feeling.  Also, I am not sure I liked the flame fondue pots.  Not only does that seem like a huge liability but we had to have it adjusted several times because it went out or what flaring up towards our hands and faces. The food was just okay.  They only have one cheese fondue to choose from albeit it was very good.  The salad was bad.  They just threw some lettuce and a cucumber on the plate and called it a salad.  I expect more.   We got the sampler platter to try a little bit of everything - the steak, the lobster, the scallops, the shrimp, etc.  I personally thought the seafood was the best.  The steak did not taste all that great and tasted a little chewy.  I also didn't like that you cooked it in oil - I feel as though it was less flavor than broth (we only later learned you can request broth - our waitress did not do a good job).  The veggies were good and fresh.  I did like that the portions were manageable and I didn't leave stuffed.  Next and most importantly - the chocolate fondue.  It was good but nothing to write home about.  I also would have appreciated if they brought more dippers - although truthfully I was stuffed and really needed to stop eating dessert anyway.  I guess I expect for what I heard and the price, that the food was be exceptional and it just wasn't. Another thing - service.  It was just average.  It was a little slow and they really didn't explain things well (i.e. the broth option).   We had a great time, but we made it a great time.

My boyfriend and I went here recently to celebrate an anniversary.  He made the plans and reso.  Needless to say, I was delighted with his choice.  When we sat at the table they already had a ""happy anniversary from Geja's"" card on the table which was a nice touch.  The server and staff were very curteous and friendly but definitely made sure to give you your space.  They had a Spanish guitarist there playing live which sounded beautiful and was great mood music.  All around great atmosphere.  There was a table nearby where a couple had brought there two children who were junior high aged and I overheard one of the kids say that it was the ""best night ever"".  That's impressive to get that out of a kid at a place like this.  Big up's! On to the food.  I love melted cheese.  And melted chocolate.  So they had me there.  The app and dessert were both amazing!!!  I will have to say the pound cake with the chocolate was a weird combination/texture for me.  I couldn't hang.  I loved the fruit with the cheese!  Yum!  When they first set the chocolate down they light it on fire and tell you you have two minutes till it dies out on its own.  They are not lying.  Its 2 min or less.  So don't waste that precious time trying to take pics - cook your marshmallows!!!  We were bummed that we didn't get to finish cooking all our mallows but alas, the fault was all our own.  For the main course the server gives you a tutorial on how long everything needs to be cooked in the oil, which is very helpful.  And they give you like 8 sauces!  All delish!!  My boyfriend was so excited with all the possibilities and how hands on it was.  He was like a kid in a candy store.  He got so excited he stabbed himself witha  skewer!   It is a wonderful spot.  I absolutely loved it and can't wait to go back!",0.9974,0.716,0.223,0.062,0.6005802469135801

But my American-educated side is telling me ""It's called fondue. It's supposed to be expensive.""  Think: A cozier, more romantic, Melting Pot. Just don't let them turn the lights up. We started off with a small salad and a basket of grapes, apples, and cubed bread. This was all to be dipped in super hot Gruyere cheese flaming in a little Le Creuset pot. Adorable and surprisingly delicious. The cheese was really strong, but I was shocked at how tasty sweet plump grapes go with stinky melted cheese. The $50 seafood deluxe platter comes with 2 scallops, a lobster tail, and 2 prawns. The sides also include an assortment of raw veggies, including potatoes, broccoli, mushrooms and peppers.  The bf and i ordered the broth, which our server said would take 2x the amount of time oil would take. I'm glad we still picked broth!!!  The huge assortment of sauces we fun! Without it, the food would have been bland. My favorite combo: Horseradish + BBQ.  The best part is most definitely dessert.  DO NOT PUT THE MARSHMALLOW SKEWER DIRECTLY IN YOUR MOUTH POST-ROASTING. I had a big fat blister to show for it.  A small platter of bananas, strawberries, pineapple and poundcake. Plus 2 marshmallows each. A tiny bowl of crushed graham cracker crumbs so you can make your own ""smore"".  I managed to lick the chocolate-filled Le Creuset clean...with a spoon of course.  P.s.

The tables are packed pretty tightly, so if you can get an alcove/booth of sorts, it is optimal.  The water service was frequent, until we were done with the chocolate fondue - then the guy sort of disappeared on us.  The server was fairly busy and did not stop by often, but we weren't wanting much server attention so it was okay. The dipping sauces were delish.  Not a big fan of the teriyaki dipping sauce, but I'm sure it goes well with something.  My favourites were the dijon mustard, horseradish and the dill dipping sauces.  Of course the classic butter was delightful with the scallops. The cheese fondue was tasty, very well seasoned.  The chocolate fondue was enjoyable and sinful.  The flambe was fun with the marshmallow toasting.  The entree was deep-fried in soybean oil - the only option.  It was tasty, but there really wasn't a good place to dab/drain the cooked items of oil.  Still it was delicious and you just need to be careful of what you do with them fondue forks after it comes out of the oil. Side note comparison of Greja's v Melting Pot: - Melting Pot provides more options for the cheese fondue.  Result: eh, that's nice. - Portions: Melting Pot will provide refills on dipping items for the Cheese and Chocolate courses.  Result: you eat through the bottom of the pot and probably over-stuff yourself; it is nice to have more dessert items to dip though.  Greja's provides reasonable portions that are still quite generous. - Melting Pot provides other media to cook the entrees aside from oil - Greja's has better flavor and the dipping sauces are more enjoyable. Bottom line summary: - Greja's - for a romantic fondue night out that you want to be able do something afterwards - Melting Pot - glutton's night out and you want to feel like a roly poly",0.9956,0.8,0.168,0.032,0.5475041771094403

We had planned to bring a bottle of our wedding wine to share over dinner, but decided against it when told of the $15 ""corkage fee"" and got a couple of glasses of red sangria for about the same price and saved the wine for later.

I had a very enjoyable time and I liked the food but I guess I wouldn't say that it was amazing? I went with a friend rather than on a date, so perhaps some of the romantic atmosphere was lost on me. Anyway: The good parts: I liked the cheese fondue a lot. I'd read some reviews saying that it was bad but I liked the flavors a lot. I thought it tasted good with the bread and the fruit. The meats and veggies were good too but the dipping sauces confused me a bit, seemed like there were too many flavors going on. Also, mmm I loved the chocolate dessert fondue. I love chocolate in general and it tasted verrry good with everything they gave to eat it with. We also had a nice bottle of white wine that was very decently priced. I also loved the salad that they gave us and thought it was nice that they finished with coffee. My friend used a groupon but I still don't think it was all that expensive (without the groupon) for the amount of food we had.

Here's another tip, there's a fondue game that if a piece of food falls off your fork into the urn you have to kiss someone. I learned that from a The Babysitters Club Book. The Cheese tasted best with the fruit. The cheese is kinda sharp but very good. The Meat and Seafood was super. The dips really made this course phenomenal. The Chocolate was just ok.

I didn't need them at that time but, and the restaurant never got crowded enough to need reservations, but overall crowded for a weeknight. Based on someone else's recommendation, I requested a booth, which wasn't a problem. I would recommend a booth, which is much more intimate than the tables, which were close together. The restaurant definitely earned it recent spot in a list I saw of Chicago's most romantic restaurants. The lighting is dark and there is romantic music playing.  We ordered the 4 course meal. The waitress pointed out that we did have to order the same items so I would recommend ordering different things and sharing. The salad was standard. Then we got the cheese fondue which was great. We used all of our bread and the waitress asked if we wanted more. We used the additional bread to scoop up any remaining cheese in the bowl. Next for the main course, we got a good portion of meat and variety of vegetables. The waitress gave us great instructions on how to cook everything. It was served with 8 sauces which we equally amazing. Last course was the chocolate fondue with a good variety of things to dip in it.  Overall it was a great experience.  It was my first time going to a fondue restaurant and didn't realize the commitment it takes to keep track of the different items and different cooking times.

I will state my only gripe here in the beginning, as it was when we were first seated that I came across it.  A lot of the tables are way too close together, especially in the little alcove where we were seated.  It's a little difficult to have a romantic date when you're a foot and a half from the next table.  My boyfriend and I spent a lot of time listening to the conversations of the tables next to us, which is always fun, but there's a time and a place for everything.  Next time, I know to request one of the little secluded private booths when I make my reservation, because all of the booths looked quite appealing. Everything else was great.  The service was friendly, the busboy was really on top of his game.  The fondue, of course, was amazing.  We opted for only cheese and chocolate fondue with a cheese plate in between, and next time we know to order both of our cheese courses at the same time so that we have more stuff to dip in our fondue!  (""We could dip our cheese in cheese!"" says my boyfriend with glee.)  I only say this because there was only just a little bit of cheese left when we were finished with all of the dippables - not enough to really warrant asking for more bread or fruit but definitely enough that we were sad to see it go.  :) The chocolate fondue was, naturally, sinful and delicious.  I kept thinking I was going to get outdone by the richness, but since there was such an array of different things to dip in it, I was able to keep truckin' til the bitter end.  Although I'd call it more bittersweet, since I was sad to see it go but knew it was time to say goodbye.

The meal was what it was: interesting and fun, but basic and simple. (Veggies and raw meats) After getting the bill and attempting to redeem our Groupons, the waiter announced that we could only use one for table - even if we were getting separate checks. I asked for more explanation about the ""one per table"" rule because if our friends sat at the table next to us, we could have redeemed it but if they sat with us, they couldn't. The waiter suggested that we speak to the manager; he came over and tried to be super intimidating. I asked him about the rule and asked for more explanation. He proceeded to rant about how it was the policy, pure and simple, how he had already redeemed 24 of them and how he couldn't afford to redeem all these Groupons and how he was losing all this money and couldn't afford to make an exception for us. Because I still didn't understand the rationale, I asked him again to explain how it is that if we were getting separate checks it wasn't the same scenario as if we were sitting at separate tables. If it was a point about the bottom line, the guy was going to get the same amount of money than if he accepted than if our friends had sat at a table next to us.

I felt feeling incredibly full and satisfied.  It's true it's a little pricey if you want a meat plate, but I'd argue that the ""smaller"" options are even better (ok, so I'm biased as a vegetarian) and plenty of food.  Definitely worth it for a nice night out.",0.9306,0.725,0.211,0.064,0.6228758169934642
2011-04-01,4.0,"Stopped in last night with friends for dinner. Romantic atmosphere, kind of dark but nice overall. In my opinion it is a little cramped. Tables too close together. Can make it a challenge getting to your table.  Fondue is fun and a totally different dining experience. I do wish they offered a different cheese choice. The gruyere/swiss combination is a little strong. Good selection on main courses. Beef, chicken, shrimp, lobster, and scallops. Choose your combination and get to cooking.  I have a shrimp allergy and they accommodated me by bringing fresh oil to the table so there was no chance of having a reaction from the previously used oil. Excellent selection of dipping sauces for your veg and meats. Service was outstanding. The waiter explained everything as each course came out.  The dessert fondue was fabulous. Would be nice to have a white or dark chocolate alternative but not a deal breaker. The flambe they do on the chocolate so you can toast your marshmallows was so fun. All in all we had a great meal and a great time. It is a bit pricey but worth it for a special occasion or a nice night out with your significant other. Even be a fun stop for a glass of wine and just the dessert fondue at the end of the evening. Keep our eye out for coupons. Makes it much more affordable.  Geja's is a place I will be going back to and would recommend it to people.",0.9977,0.69,0.284,0.025,0.5337184873949579

It's downstairs and pretty dark with low ceilings, so it has kind of a cellar-ish feel to it. But the staff is so friendly (and there's a coat check), and the candles are just so warm and inviting....and something about it is just so relaxing.  I love fondue anyway but I have to say I was blown away by this place. My girlfriend and I came here to catch up and had the most wonderful meal. We were seated  by the patio where it was quiet and we were able to have a great conversation all night. We got the Veggie Platter (which actually is more a four or five-course meal). You get a plated salad, cheese fondue with grapes and apples and bread, a veggie platter with hot oil for cooking and various dipping sauces, and finally the chocolate dessert fondue. The whole process just engenders a relaxed conversation, sharing, and enjoying the finer things in life - i.e., yummy food. In other words it's freaking awesome.

If you're looking for a new type of restaurant experience, and want a dimly lit romantic basement type feel, then Geja's might be a good choice. Again, the food is actually pretty decent - I mean you cook it yourself so how could it be bad?  But, they do give you a decent spread of items and they seem like high quality items, although nothing out of this world.  I just find it terribly overpriced for what it is, so wouldn't recommend others shell out $50/person for it.  There are much better places in Chicago for this price in my opinion.",0.85,0.736,0.16,0.103,0.5167213203463203

I'm giving this place 4 stars because atmosphere and service were 5 stars, but food (for a fondue place) was probably a 3. Solid restaurant, but compared to the Melting Pot there was just no selection. Only one type of cheese (that was kinda weird...), one plain salad, only one type of chocolate (whaa???! no choices of dark chocolate or regular milk chocolate or to add peanut butter dark chocoate??). Though pricey, i do think the value is well worth the cost- I mean, c'mon, you get 4 courses of fun! The food was very good as were the dipping sauces, but I didn't like that Geja's uses all oils for dipping whereas Melting Pot feels lighter and easier on the stomach the next morning by using broth-like liquids to cook the food in.

It was getting crazy; we were buying all kinds of certificates and coupons like the end of the world was approaching with the end of King Daley's reign.   With an Open Table coupon, he made a week day reservation and we ended up in a very romantic booth, in the corner of the dining room was a guy playing a guitar - classical/Spanish music. It was perfect: dark and dreamy, candlelight and soft guitar music wafting over us.   We both ordered the premiere dinners at $45 - $50 per person, included in the complete dinner is a small but tasty salad, cheese fondue starter, entrée, chocolate fondue dessert and coffee.  I picked the beef and shrimp and my bf went with the chicken and shrimp. I loved the cheese fondue and the shrimp were large but as someone else said ""cooking your own food wears off fairly quickly"".  I do like the idea that someone else posted about having a choice of a vegetable both for the cooking liquid in place of only oil.   All in all we had a nice experience, food was good, service was excellent and the ambience is perfect for insuring an amorous night with a starry-eyed first date.    I don't think we would return anytime soon but I would recommend it to anyone that has never done a fondue place or just wants to turn back time.

I do want to point out that the cheese fondue is delicious (an excellent mix of gruyere and swiss), and the service was excellent throughout our entire meal.  Unfortunately, another miss for this place is that you leave REEKING of grease. And when I say reeking, you stink to the high heavens.

Ambience/Space: Very tight quarters if you are not in one of the booth enclaves that they have. I basically had to listen to the entire conversation of the couple next to me, because the tables were so close together. I mean I couldn't tell which tables were seated as a group vs. couples sitting so close at different tables. If I were to go back, I would definitely wait for/ request a booth by reservation. It was almost a bit clostraphobic. Those who claim this is one of the most romantic restaurants in chicago, have a strange definition of romantic.  Service: Host and Manager nice, prompt, and professional. Bar staff friendly. Wait staff friendly and competent.  Food: It was a nice change to the typical melting pot, and the cheese fondue is good, but the basket they served the bread and grapes in was definitely old and worn out and needed changing. The main course we had the international and the conouisseur which basically included beef tenderloin, chicken, shrimp, and lobster. The portions were small and also there is not choice of cooking liquid. Just the oil. Protein quality was good, some of the dipping sauces were excellent (dill sauce, horseradish). Teriyaki and garlic aioli type sauce were decent also. Veggies were standard but good. Dessert was definitely the highlight. The chocolate was delicious, although I would have preferred less strawberries and marshmallow and more bananas and pound cake instead. But that's just me. All in all dessert was very good.  Price: Definitely a little high for the value and quantity of food, but both my hubby and I were definitely full when we left. I'm not sure we would go back here if we had to pay full price, but I can see the appeal.  Parking: It's lincoln park.... had to valet for 10 dollars.

We split a bottle of the Geja's house chardonnay to start, and it was perfect!  For our meal we went with the Prince Geja's Combination, and it was delicious!  We started with a Geja's salad, which was simple yet tasty.  Next we savored an excellent cheese fondue appetizer which came accompanied by various breads and fruit.   Our main dish came on a large plate and included aged beef tenderloin, delicate lobster tail, jumbo shrimp, plump Atlantic sea scallops, tender boneless chicken breast, a mountain of assorted fresh vegetables, and eight dipping sauces.  Now this may not look like a ton of food to some, but I left stuffed (and I can eat!).  Each item on the plate was high-quality and tasted wonderful after its hot oil bubble bath.  For dessert, the flaming chocolate dessert fondue and coffee sealed the deal on a great evening.

I love Gruyere and all the dipping accompaniments were perfectly matched.   While eating the cheese fondue, the oil was heating so it was hot and bubbling when the platter of our beef tenderloin, shrimp and veggies were presented.  This platter took up half the table.  The cooking directions were given as well as the times.  I noticed the beef and the shrimp needed a little longer than the 1-2 minutes they stated.  The food was phenomenal.  The veggies were tasty although the broccoli gave us the most difficult time.  The darn thing kept falling off the skewer!  The beef was tender and the shrimp were huge.  We cleaned the entire plate but was able to pace ourselves and enjoy every bite.  No one rushed us. The chocolate fondue was a great way to end the already delicious meal.  The flambe was a nice touch for me to burn my marshmallows.  I like them that way.  The crushed graham cracker was perfect to make a version of smores.  The chocolate was decadent and the fruit delicious.  The coffee was strong and excellent.  I like the whipped cream instead of cream.  I think I might even do that at home.

Not too much alcohol, but it will creep up on you! When our food came out, it was all on a plate with vegetables like potatoes and green peppers. They told us how long to cook what and what not to do. Obviously, don't use your eating fork to cook the raw meat! Salmonella = bad! The only thing I didn't like was that I don't think their cooking times were accurate. I feel like the pieces were super big and needed to be cooked longer unless you like things bloody.

I would have given 5 stars but unfortunately my darling Geja's loses a star for their potatoes.  Why did you change the potatoes Gejas?  Why why why?  I loved the new potatoes, now they serve plain old baking potatoes and they are not good.  It is impossible to cook them through!     PLEASE bring back the new potatoes, I beg of you!

We arrived at 9pm and were told there'd be a wait and that we could wait at the bar.  No problem - we were seated within 10 minutes of arriving.  Our table was cozy and I was happy about that as we were celebrating my fiances 30th birthday. The food was unimpressive.  The options for vegetarians were vegetables, vegetables, and more vegetables - which is fine because I do like them, but at least Melting Pot offers a pasta along with your entree course so you feel full by the time you leave.  They only offer one type of cheese and chocolate, which I found kind of boring.   My biggest complaint of the night was, I had worn a new outfit and jacket as we were celebrating his b-day, and 4 days later it still smells even though we had given it to coat check.  So now I can add a dry cleaning bill to my already expensive night.

At Geja's, it's the atmosphere that will wow you. I came here with my wife for one of our anniversaries and it was the most romantic restaurant we have ever been to. There are numerous private-like tables, and a few more geared towards larger groups of four or more as well. The interior is perfectly lit with a nice old world reddish hue about it. The food itself is typical fondue, and it is certainly too pricey if food is your main goal of the evening. The appetizer and dessert fondue pots with respective cheese and chocolate dipping pots were both excellent. The main course is somewhat bland as it is just what seemed to be non-marinated meat and an oil fondue pot. No big deal, it was still a nice evening. To cap it off, Geja's was kind enough to offer my then-girlfriend-now-wife and I complimentary champagne, and it wasn't the low end stuff either.

I attempted to take my girlfriend there for her birthday celebration since she had never had fondue coupled with the fact that Geja's has this glowing rep for being the most romantic place on earth ever since I started keeping track. I made a reservation long in advance specifically requesting a booth. So where do they seat us upon entering? We're placed next to a drafty window right smack on top of another table, hardly what you'd call ""romantic."" I asked the hostess to give us a booth. She replied it would be about an hour wait for one, even with my reservation. Obviously, I'm less than thrilled with this outcome but since it was more about the special occasion then myself, I was willing to entertain this. So we decide to sit at the bar and wait it out. About ten minutes later, I had the great displeasure of meeting rocket scientist/general manager Kirby. He babbles to us that while we could wait the hour for the promised booth that we in fact would be displacing someone else's reservation, so in fact we couldn't have a booth no matter what that night. Huh?!? No offense dear Kirby but I couldn't give a rat's ass about your other reservation woes. All I know is you failed to honor mine. But it gets even better. The coward attempts to blame it on the poor female hostess, claiming that she spoke out of turn and was inexperienced. He then tried to get us to settle on two other crappy non-booth tables. I probably would've taken them but it was my girlfriend who was so incredibly put off by this horrendous service that she stated she'd prefer to eat dog food then be treated like one.

And then the night turned very sour.  The manager raises his voice in defense and tells our friend that she is wrong and she can't use it until January 2.  She says, okay well that is what I was told, but its not a big deal.  The manager continues in a rude tone that bordered on calling my friend an outright liar, saying she must be making it up because he will not allow us to use it.   My husband then got up from the table, after seeing how much the rude man upset us, and told the manager that he understood we couldn't use the Groupon, but that he felt the manager was rude and abrupt to us and basically called us liars.  The manager shrugged his shoulders, and told my husband that he told his staff that you can't use the Groupon until after Jan. 2, and that he knows his staff, so obviously someone was lying. We decided to leave because this man had made us so uncomfortable by making harshly worded accusations toward us.  And we were ready to come back to Geja's AGAIN in January to honor his instructions, and pay full price last night.

Never fear, we had fun but we could probably find a good time just as easily anywhere else...   First impressions? It does not smell good and you will not smell good when you get home; I'm assuming it's the cost of being able to deep fry, errr, fondue, scallops and the like in hot oil but it's problematic when you have to take shower before bed to get the smell out of your hair (and annoying to have your husband ask why you smell like Chinese take out).  Let me interject, I'm pretty sure I've decided that fondue for dinner/appetizers isn't my thing... So, I set aside my issue with the smell after we were seated and decided to enjoy the food. I did, for awhile. I've had an ongoing love-affair with cheese for a few years but had a hard time eating a lot of the cheese fondue here, it was great the first few bites and then it got boring and, eventually, started to bubble and spit, and tasted a little gross (burned?).  I covered the sterno to stop the cooking process and couldn't put one more cheese covered anything in my mouth for fear of getting sick. Oh, and then they finally brought out the veggies we paid extra for... too large (please, people, cut them to BITE size), too late even though I asked three times where the veggies were. Fail. Out comes the chocolate, another mistress of mine for years and, sadly, a similar experience was had. The highlight was most certainly the ability to roast a marshmallow at the table and the ground graham crackers were great, I sprinkled them on all 4 bites I had. Perhaps the experience is different if you can afford the $50/person dinner and have the variety of the hot oil in addition to the cheese and chocolate? I guess my point is, if I'm going to cook my own food for dinner, I'll do it at home next time and save the money (and time in the shower).",0.9845,0.748,0.16,0.092,0.5285307285307287

We heard it was a great place and we visited for my husband's birthday. Valet was $10, and a tip on top of that. Consider it. But... it is downtown in Lincoln Park, so what do you expect, right? We weren't seated until about 20-30 minutes after our reservation time, but I can't complain much because they gave us a great seat and we didn't have to sit in those old, uncomfortable church chairs they had at the other tables. We were given a booth. Salads were brought out just after drinks. The dressing was a bit horseradish-like. No options to choose from but luckily we enjoyed the spice. Immediately our hot oil was turned on (sad they didn't offer a hot broth instead like The Melting Pot does) and our cheese was brought out. It was Greyere, but had a bit of a cheez whiz taste. Hate to say it. It was okay, but not amazing. I guess I'm just really partial to them making it fresh at my table like TMP. The sides were decent. There's something about a beer base and cheddar that is just so much better than whatever they were serving. It's a shame because usually the cheese is my favorite part of the meal courses. Not much time after our cheese was removed our meats and veggies came out. A bit odd deep frying vegetables. I love cooking them in broth and wished that was the case here. Instead, the hot oil made what would be a healthy choice of fresh veggies and turned it fatty. The 8 dipping sauces were okay and I ate most of the veggies raw with some sauces. Chocolate fondue was brought out with an assortment of dessert items. We received a few marshmallows, strawberries, bananas, pound cake pieces, grapes, maraschino cherries (yuck! what about fresh?), and graham cracker crust crumbles. The brandy needed to burn off first and then we ate.  The check was dropped off with our dessert which we didn't love. It was as though we were being rushed. Before we had even finished out dessert, we had our credit card slip signed. It was clear that they wanted to seat our table for the 3rd time that evening. For full course fondue, we were in and out (from sitting at the table to getting our car) in less than 1.5 hours. That's record time for fondue which is meant to take a long time! Another complaint is the amount of dust I saw hanging on lamp shades and curtains. It just seemed like that place needed a deep clean. Since the lighting is always dim, it may be hard to notice.

Meat course: Went with a mix of beef, scallops and lobster.   Was too much food for the two of us.  Could have probably went with a cheese/chcoloate for one and meat course for the other and had plenty of food.   The scallops stole the show.  Paired with the lemon aioli, they were to die for.  I was a bit disappointed with the lobster - just didn't seem to lend itself well to this style of cooking.  Beef was excellent with the roasted red pepper balsamic vinagrette, Chocolate Course:  OMG Graham Cracker Crumbs rock!   Dip banana in chocolate and imediately put in the graham crackers and eat.  HEAVEN!

We both got the ""Prince Geja's Combination"" and substituted the chicken for more seafood. Even after putting a veggie at the end of the skewer, the seafood still managed to fall off and float around in the hot oil, which was a little tricky/dangerous to ""fish out"" (no pun intended). It was fun and we laughed until we cried. It was absolutely delicious -- and memorable! Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the menu, especially the wine selection -- which is extensive. She was very informative and gave us her best practices for cooking fondue. I didn't give Geja's the full 5 stars, because the chairs are kind of low -- or at least my boyfriend's was.

I'll start with the bad and end on a happy note.  I find it really annoying that you can't request a certain type of table.  We made reservations probably two months in advance and they would not let us request a booth.  They said the tables were first come first servce, which makes no sense to me if you have a reservation.  Even though we had a reservation, we waited 40 minutes to get a booth, per the recommendation of other yelpers.  It was so worth it. We waited in the bar and had some nice wine and cheese/crackers for a snack.  I didn't mind waiting at all once I got over the initial annoyance.  The hostess also told us that there would be a booth opening in 10 minutes only to tell us 1 minute later that she was wrong. Once we finally got to the booth, we ordered the Price geja's premiere and then an additional seafood a la carte.  We almost ate all of the protein, didn't even eat half the veggies, and we were too stuffed to eat hardly any of the dessert. EVERYTHING WAS AMAZINGLY DELICIOUSLY GOOD. For the people who say the cheese is too strong - I mean these people obviously don't know what gruyere cheese is.  It's strong with a distinct taste but it's good!  Cooking the food was super fun (I highly recommend the broccoli with the dill sauce and the garlic butter sauce was perfect for all the seafood).  The scallops were amazing.  The beef tenderloin tasted great with the teryaki sauce.  Also I found the atmosphere very romantic, which I appreciated. I would definitely return.  Just make sure you get a booth b/c the other tables are close together (where you're literally brushing elbows with the people next to you) and get there early if you want to wait for a booth.",0.996,0.782,0.185,0.033,0.5531338183421516

2010-10-26,4.0,"Last Friday Erica and I decided to have a nice, romantic fondue dinner at Geja's. I'm surprised there are not more fondue places in Chicago. The melting pot is fine but has the obvious feeling of a chain restaurant and none of the charm of a neighborhood gem like Geja's. Writing a food review of fondue is tricky similar to a ""build-your-own stir fry."" Many of the flavors are self directed along with your success or failure. However, what separates Geja's, and makes it a fun and worthwhile meal, is the quality of experience. The setting and decor is great, the wine list superb, and the main course options extensive. Geja's does have an a la carte option, but most people choose the full premier dinner - salad, cheese fondue, main course and chocolate fondue. For our meal we both selected the beef tenderloin and scallops, even though each person can pick different ""proteins."" Everything was great and we left unable to finish our chocolate (a rarity, but Erica was too stuffed to help me). The cheese course was amazing and it took self-restraint not to kill our appetite on bread dipped in melted cheese. Our meat and scallops were also fantastic, especially when I did not overcook my steak. The main course is served with a variety of vegetables, including broccoli, peppers, potatoes, onions and mushrooms. The vegetables were especially important while cooking the scallops so the scallops did not fall off the skewer. Once cooked you have a choice of eight dipping sauces to flavor your treats. I enjoyed the BBQ sauce (sweet baby ray's) and teriaki sauce for my vegetables and tenderloin, respectively. The butter sauce and dill sauce worked well with the scallops. Everyone has their favorite, but they are all very good. Lastly, the chocolate course is the most well known fondue experience. You get a basket of marshmallows, pound cake, bananas, strawberries, etc to dip into a warm pot of melted chocolate. There is no good explanation why dipping treats and fruit into warm chocolate is so much fun. Marshmallows and bananas were my favorite chocolate transporters. Geja's remains my go-to fondue spot in Chicago and highly recommended for first-timers or experienced masters of hot oil skewer cooking. It is a romantic dinner experience at a good value if you arrive hungry (most Premier Dinners are $40-$50 per person). Weekend nights usually feature live guitar music as well. Next time I might stick with the favorites and try the cheese-chocolate option. (Last note: be prepared to dry clean your clothes afterward- similar to Japanese teppan style, the cooking oils and flavors permeate everything :)",0.9989,0.724,0.248,0.028,0.5330952380952382

The hostess, bartender, and our waiter were all very welcoming and attended to all of our needs, and I could tell the manager himself felt honored that we chose Gejas to celebrate our engagement. The reason I didn't rate Geja's any higher is because I just didn't enjoy the food there. The cheese to me was too pungent, and as a first time fondue goer, it became a little too much. The second course included surf and turf and my fiancé and I started feeling queezy because of all the oil that we cooked our food in, it was just a little too much. By the time the chocolate came by, our stomachs were too unsettled to be able to enjoy it, and it was a shame because from the little bit we had it was really good.

Tastes great, fun to cook, and expensive!  There are a couple highlights that I want to accentuate. 1)  Quality of food   This place has great quality meats and veggies.  I've tried all of their proteins in Prince Geja's combination ($49.95) and was pleasantly surprised (chicken, steak, lobster, shrimp, scallops).  Dipping sauces for the protein are excellent.  Horseradish is my favorite!  Great with steak and potatoes.  They also have butter, dill, BBQ, teriyaki and a few others.   I also like the variety of food you get.  I'm sure you already know but it comes with a Gruyere cheese fondue appetizer and a chocolate desert fondue. 2)  Atmosphere I usually don't care about atmosphere.  If the food is good, I have and will continue to go to ""hole in the wall"" restaurants.  There's just something about this place that I like in terms of atmosphere.  It's a good romantic date place.  You go down the stairs to enter the restaurant.  It's dark, cozy, and comfortable.  Only thing I would complain about is that it can get a little hot when you're cooking but I figure that's the nature of fondue since the oil pot is on the table.

However, if you're looking for a cute, fun, and romantic time, this is definitely the right place.  I've heard so many things about Geja's, and jumped all over the Groupon. The trick with Groupon is  to wait until most of the hype has died down, then go. Seriously. There is an expiration date, it's ok to be closer to the expiration than the purchase date.

I originally thought it was a little pricey, but they give you a TON of food.  And the waitress was very helpful, although it would have been nice if she could have made her schpeel seem less rehearsed.  The only confusing part was trying to figure out how long to cook the food.  The waitress told us how long everything should cook for, but a timer or clock or something would have been nice - I didn't want to take my phone out at the dinner table so I just had to guess.  My only other complaint is that it was pretty cramped.  Granted, I wasn't really walking around but between being seated, using the washroom (the drinks were excellent!), and leaving, I'm sure I rammed my rear into multiple people's chairs.

2010-10-02,2.0,"First impressions : Expensive and Romantic!  Pretty outside seating, inside it's old school and super dark ....candlelit and romantic- really kind of cute....  Husband and I sat at a booth that was cozy and of course romantic, we could even close the curtain for more privacy!  The menu is a bit confusing if you have never been, but the waitress did a good job of explaining. We got 2 dinners- chicken and scallops & shrimp and chicken.. The dinners include a salad upfront, cheese fondue to share, the entrees, a chocolate fondue to share and plain coffee to finish your meal.  To start, we split a pitcher of Red Sangria- Excellent..some of the best I have had in the city. It was well done with the combo of fruit, liquors, wine, etc...very tasty and easy to drink! WE WOULD GET THIS AGAIN.  Salad- Mixed green salad with a honey mustard dressing. It was fine-fresh but nothing special. PASS.  The Cheese Fondue - extremely creamy - pretty good. The flavors were of swiss and maybe some cream cheese with liquors-not as much straight up cheese as we would have preferred, but it was tasty and interesting to eat. The rye bread and onion bread weren't of exceptional quality BUT were a tasty way to dip. Also the apples and grapes were good in the cheese too. Overall the cheese fondue was decent and we WOULD GET THIS AGAIN.  The Main Entree Dippers- You are given good quality, raw pieces of seafood, chicken breast, veggies, a vat of oil and told approximately how long to cook things. Overall, I am not a fan of this style of food preparation, but my husband didn't mind cooking. I prefer to have the restaurant do the cooking if I am paying so much to begin with! Anyway, after the meats are cooked you are given a choice of 8 mediocre dipping sauces-thumbs down These seemed to be out of jars - bbq, red pepper sauce, teriaki, dill, garlic butter, spicy - this stuff wasn't very good on it's own and paired with the bland, oily, unseasoned meat , it barely made an impact ... Overall disappointing. They do provide salt and pepper at the table, but I prefer my meat marinated for maximum flavor- so even when I did add some salt and pepper it didn't do much. This is definitely not my style of eating b/c the sauces aren't very good, the food was too oily and the meats aren't seasoned or cooked for you. The shrimp was the best b/c it cooked quickly and absorbed more flavors...Chicken was the worst since it was a thick chunk and it all tasted so bland and took so long to to cook.... Oh well, it's a cute idea...and can be of fun...but we prefer to have good food and have fun too! This was not for us and WE WOULD NOT GET THIS AGAIN.  Chocolate Fondue - a seemingly dark chocolate base with strong liquor flavors accompanied with various dippers- marshmallows, pound cake, strawberries, melons, bananas, pineapples, etc. We didn't really like the flavors of the fondue- too dark and too strong tasting. Also, while the fruit dippers were good in terms of quality and freshness, the marshmallows were obviously store bought and I can only assume the same for the mediocre dry pound cake... WE WOULD NOT GET THIS AGAIN..  Coffee- Fine I guess-just plain black...PASS  OVERALL - WE WOULD NOT COME BACK. BUT if we do - we would sit at the bar and get a pitcher of the Red Sangria and The Cheese Fondue!! My recommendation for a fondue place is Melting Pot- here you will find a huge variety of Cheese fondues- swiss, cheddar, Mexican combo, etc AND a ton of chocolate fondue combos including White chocolate Amaretto my personal favorite, chocolate peanut butter, orange chocolate,etc. - you get the idea, HEAVEN! The dippers at both places are of about the same quality fruit, veggies, bread,poundcake marshmallows- but the fondues at Melting Pot of are of a much higher quality and great taste!  We can not recommend going to Geja since it was expensive and food was just average or below for us... Plus both our tummies were not very happy with us after- all the grease I assume is to blame...and possibly under cooked food?!  Bottom Line - Skip IT...try Melting Pot instead and stick to their yummy drinks, cheese and choco fondues, I doubt you'll be disappointed. Enjoy!",0.9984,0.801,0.158,0.042,0.5337452966534599
2010-09-30,3.0,"Maybe my expectations were too high to begin with, but I thought my experience at Geja's was just OK.  Foundue is a really fun way to eat, so the fondue experience itself and my fun date were 5 stars.   We are new to fondue and I personally felt like the waiter was trying to sell us on the more expensive options on the menu, rather than finding us the dinner that would best suit us, when we said we wanted a little of everything. He was really pushing the $50 dinner, which was a good idea but we both didn't have to get it, and prices are labeled as ""per person,"" so if you're new you don't really know how it works. The staff was friendly, but the waiter seemed slightly condescending to me.  I heard other people questioning his recommendations as well. We got one premier combo and one vegetable medley a la carte, and that was more than enough food. However, we ended up splitting the cheese and dessert and could have used more of these and less veggies.  Recommendation: Get one premier combo if you have to have meat, then get an order of cheese and chocolate only for the second person.   The premier combo comes with vegetables anyway, and the cheese and dessert were the best ones in my opinion.   I don't really understand why fondue is so expensive- you get a few bites of meat (the best one comes with 2 shrimp, 2 scallops, 2 bites of steak, 2 bites of chicken, and 2 bites of lobster. Good, but certainly not $30 worth of meat!) and then you do the cooking yourself. You probably don't have to pay full price when you come here. We had a Groupon, and other people around us had a deal from OpenTable and I know  restaurant.com  does deals from time to time.  Overall the atmosphere is really nice and different, very old and gothic feeling and a fun outing, especially since the weather is cooler now.  I would try Melting Pot for my next fondue experience, but am not opposed to giving Geja's a second chance.

2010-09-29,4.0,"Geja's Cafe reminds me of a haunted house due to its narrow hallways leading to dimly lit faces boiling meat and veggies like a witches' brew. The atmosphere and activity is unique, making for a great dinner. My date and I were sat at a table in a bay window with ample privacy. Our waiter came over and his English was slightly hard to understand, but he explained the menu to us since it was our first time. REALLY CONFUSING! 4 course meal? Raw cheese? Cheese fondue? Premier combo? It seemed like the waiter was almost doing a sell job on us to get the most expensive combo, but we are budget diners. I'm pretty sure we ended up ordering correctly since it was more than filling for the two of us. Our order: -Prince Geja's Combination - $50 -Fresh Vegetable Medley A la Carte- $21 What came to our table: -Salad with honey mustardish dressing -Cheese fondue with fruit and bread- we cleaned out the pot of cheese, but it was barely enough -Tray of meat - beef, chicken, scallops, lobster, jumbo shrimp -Tray of vegetables - peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, potatoes, onions -Eight Sauces -Coffee -Chocolate fondue with fruit and pound cake Favorite items from this feast were potatoes, beef, shrimp, and chocolate. The potatoes basically turn into french fries. The beef is tender and you can cook it as rare or well done as you like. Shrimp maintained great flavor. Pound cake and strawberries dipped in chocolate was good for obvious reasons. They also have an extensive wine list. We picked a couple glasses randomly, but the waiter seemed like he could make good selections. We smelled of oil and felt like cows when we left, but it was enjoyable and a rare experience.

2010-09-27,4.0,"i noticed a trend in most negative reviews...they tend to nitpick on certain things and then overlook everything the restaurant did right...to support their need to tear them down.  Now at Gejas...I did not hear many naysayers talk about the atmosphere, quality of the entrees, chocolate or cheese..and the superb wine list.  They grumble about not getting enough choices for dipping or a waiter reaching over them to refill a glass (and they got some water dripped on them).  Are you serious?   This is not an objective review in my opinion... Let me start with why I decided to dine at this Chicago icon (that has been around for 45 years)...OpenTable sent out a special coupon and even though I couldnt redeem it on Saturday night, I thought that my girlfriend and I deserved a romantic FONDUE adventure.  We took a nap...overslept past our 8 pm res...and had to have some delicious Spanish wines in the bar while waiting for a table (the bartender had a sommelier's knowledge of wine...and made IMPECCABLE selections).  Bravo on the intimate, well appoiinted bar. The atmosphere is really charming and conducive to intimate conversation.  The flamenco guitar player added more romance and class to the already BEAUTIFUL setting..  This is hands down the most european-like restaurant that I have found in Chicago...it could easily be somewhere off the beaten path in Barcelona.  I cant think of a more beautiful date night spot... The food was super.  The gruyere based cheese fondue was perfect in every way.  White wine, garlic, all added to the flavor bouquet...and it doesnt get much better than a crisp, tart apple smothered in melted goodness...we had the aged tenderloin, shrimp and lobster for a main course...and it was succulent.  The dipping sauces were diverse and tasty.  The chocolate fondue for desert was the perfect cherry on top of the evening...grabpes, banans, pound cake...and decadent gooey chocolate... So let me finish my review by simply saying this...Gejas should get 3-4 stars on ATMOSPHERE ALONE.  Add in the superb fondue and a diverse, well priced winelist...and you have a real winner.  Go back and visit the grand dame of Chicago date restaurants...and you will remember why she is so special.",0.9953,0.782,0.178,0.04,0.5616468253968254

At melting pot when you arrive your table is always ready for you, here we were forced to sit at the bar for over 20 minutes. One good thing did come from this though, and that would be that they have absolutely delicious cheese spread in the bar. I would definitely recommend it. The wine list was good although there was a definite lack of South American whites. The salad was quite good, my hubby liked it better than MP's, I like the variety at MP's better. The cheese course is definitely better at MP's, there is obviously more selection there, but all of the cheese fondues I've had at Melting Pot have been better too. This cheese fondue is WAY too runny for my taste. The meal itself is far more expensive at Geja's and the portions are smaller so it is definitely not worth the money. The chocolate fondue wasn't bad but I like the options at Melting pot better as well as the cheesecake, brownies, and covered marshmallows. Additionally, this place is very dark, too dark in my opinion since you are cooking meat afterall. Lastly, the tables are very close together so you can hear the conversations of everyone around you.  The service is significantly better at melting pot.

Ok that could be just me, but I did it anyway last night for my review of Gejas. And now here it is... More like 3.5 stars, but since I am in love with Fondue I'll bump it up to 4 stars. Valet was easy and only $10 and we didn't have to wait for a table (it was a Tuesday night mind you). Luckily we got seated next to the window so lighting was not an issue. What was an issue was the table we sat at...it was tiny and the waiter was constantly moving things around to make room for the food. We got the Premier Dinner which is their 4 course meal. Do it...you will thank me later. Also, they have their own house brand wine which is much less expensive and still decent. Get this too...once again you will thank me.  Cheese course - Delcious! came with bread, apples and grapes Salad - Had a honey mustard vinegarette as the dressing. Sweet with a small bitter bite. Very good but it was just lettece and cucumbers. No tomatoes, carrots, or spinach. Boring if you ask me.  Entree - I had the beef with chicken and my boyfriend had the beef, lobster tail and shrimp combo. Veggies included mushrooms, broccoli, peppers (scrore! They had green, red and yellow ones!), potatoes and onions. Now my gripe about the meat is that it was not cut evenly. Some pieces were super small and some were so large that I had to cook the piece for a few min, then take it out to cut it in half, to finally put it back in the oil to make sure it was all the way cooked. Also, my boyfriend only got one piece of shrimp and not much meat. I think getting just 2 things to the combo means you get more meat.  Dessert - Ok, I am not embarrassed to say that usually I ask for a spoon and scrape the bottom of the chocolate fondue pot. But this time, I actually didn't even want to eat the chocolate. It tasted like they took Hershey syrup, squeezed it into the pot and warmed it up. Yuck! And the pound cake bites were so small they broke off it the fondue pot never to be seen again! For all the hype I was disappointed. I expected more, though I do have to say the service was great. Waitstaff was friendly and tried very hard to get our fondue pot back to boiling temperature when the air came on and blew out our flame! (ladies, bring a sweater....it does get cold in there!) But any place that you have to use a flashlight to see your food automatically gets -1 star in my book! Long story short....so would I go back??

Yes.  Start off with a pot of bubbling hot cheese. Dip your bread, grapes (yes grapes) and apples into the glorious cheese, and find that the best thing you may ever taste in your life is a cheese covered grape. Next move onto a boiling pot of oil to cook your meat and veggies. You have a nice selection here. You can stick with premium cuts of beef or chicken, or you can go with the good stuff: jumbo scallops and lobster tails. The veggies include all your favorites: broccoli, onion, mushrooms, peppers, and potatoes. This will also include a ginormous array of dipping sauces. Just when you think will explode from too much yum yum fun time....they bring out a large pot of melty chocolate...light it on fire and give you marsh mellows to cook in the fire...when you come to your senses and try to figure out what just happened, you will realize that you have just devoured a pot of chocolate and several marsh mellows, strawberries, and cherries...mmmmm  Then the bill will come...I suggest you make a mad dash and don't bother getting your car from the valet....just run Forrest run!  This is a perfect spot for you to impress your newly acquired girly friend to show her how much money you can spend on her. Also, it is very romantic with the guitar player and the lighting.  If you are not trying to impress anybody, and want to experience the best of this place without paying a fortune, the following is up to you:  Sit at the bar and order a wide selection of great wines. Take in the atmosphere and snack on the crocks of free cheese and crackers. I am a cheese and crackers guy...these rock! If you want to sit down at a table, I suggest you get yourself a nice glass of vino, and go with the cheese fondue only.

The restaurant itself is located below ground, creating a cozy vibe to the place. The seating is private and the decor adds to the romance. I also thought it was a really fun place for a date because the dining experience was interactive. (I should mention that this was my first fondue experience.) I liked that there were 3 courses included in the basic menu. It definitely felt like a formal dinner without being too stuffy. The food was excellent. I especially liked the cheese fondue. I could've eaten that with my whole meal! It was definitely the best part. The main course was a little bit more work than I would've liked. I know I just mentioned that I enjoyed that it was interactive, but it was kind of stressful making sure the pot always had skewers in it (to keep the temperature regular) while also paying attention to how long the various types of proteins were being cooked. It might have been nicer to enjoy a more relaxing meal without worrying about the food so much. But that's the nature of a fondue restaurant I suppose, and definitely nothing against Geja's. So the restaurant was very romantic and the food was delicious....but the combination of the two did not exactly equal a romantic night.

While wondering what I should wear, she told me it didn't matter because the lighting was so low you can't see anything.  Wow, she was right.  I could barely tell if I was skewering a piece of bread or an apple for the cheese fondue.  Really, if your wait staff needs to point out what your food is with a flashlight, then maybe you should turn the lights up a tad.  I couldn't even see my watch to try to time the cooking of my meat.   One thing on the menu really grabbed my attention, and not in a good way.  Under the meat selections, they made a point to highlight that their beef is USDA Prime CORN FED BEEF.  Uh...no thanks.  Why would you point that out on the menu?!  I also thought it was strange there was only one choice for the fondue, but it didn't matter because swiss is my favorite anyway and chocolate is chocolate. Everything was very good, besides the occasional cooking grease splatter, and our waitress was attentive and nice.  We did have a little trouble flagging her down during dessert to ask for some bananas and strawberries...resulting in our chocolate burning.  I used one of my skewers to cover up the flame myself.

The fondue was not noteworthy at all.  First, there aren't a whole lot of choices.  We each ordered a fondue 'meal', consisting of salad, cheese fondue, meat/fish fondue, and chocolate fondue.  There's no choice of what dressing comes on your fondue, only one variety of cheese fondue, only one variety of oil fondue, and only one variety of dessert fondue. This is not the case at a place like Fondue Stube or Melting Pot, where you have choices in ALL of those categories.

2010-08-18,5.0,"I love this restaurant.  First let me start by saying that the waitstaff here is one of the friendliest and most polite in Chicago. They, alone, are reason enough to become repeat customers. This place is romantic so it's a given that on any arbitrary night you'll find young couples sitting on one side of a both smooching and enjoying chocolate fondue. It also seems to be a hit for ladies' nights. The premier dinners are filling and delicious. Salad, cheese fondue, fondue, chocolate fondue and coffee.  I LOVE their green salad and their house dressing. It's honestly the salad I'd want served at my wedding. The cheese fondue is so authentically Swiss. So if you're expecting loads of ooey-gooey, neon yellow sticky cheese then you've come to the wrong place. This is Gruyere, good Gruyere at that. And booze. White wine and brandy. It's delicately bitter and smooth, as it should be and it pairs well with the assortment of breads and fruits that they give you.  The oil fondue is to die for if you do it right. First time fondue-ers (is that a word?) might end up overcooking or undercooking the meats and veggies, burn their mouths on the fondue forks, LOOSE their food in the pot etc. etc. It pays to listen to your waiter's tips. You'll be doing it right in no time. And when you do it right, it is oh-so-good. Wonderfully tender cuts of beef and chicken. Tasty and crisp veggies. Flavorful shrimps, scallops and lobsters. It's a lot to cook and eat (the food comes out on a huge tray) but in the end it's fun and it lets you really ENJOY both the food and the company. And the sauces. Don't get me started on the sauces.  The dessert fondue is a bittersweet chocolate with orange liqueur. I think it's the cutest thing how they set the chocolate aflame, allowing one to toast their marshmallows like a camp fire. The assortment of things to dip are varied and tasty as well. Morsels of pound cake, cuts of melon, pineapple, strawberries and bananas as well as maraschino cherries all work well with the chocolate. My girlfriend likes to scoop a little bit of the chocolate into her coffee as well. The coffee. I noticed that some people pass this up, and that's understandable if you're still trying to top off a glass of wine or two (their wine list is very extensive). You really shouldn't, however. You can get your coffee black, decaf, espresso, cafe au lait, cappuccino...every which way and it's good coffee. Like really good coffee.  In the end, if you wanna fondue with a big group and want a festive and lively atmosphere, well...don't go here. Go to the Melting Pot or something. If you want romance or something a little more classy with your food, then this is the place. Sign up for their E-mails for some AWESOME coupons.

2010-08-15,4.0,"Geja's is about the experience. If you read the reviews they are very polarized, so it depends on what the standard you hold it to. I really enjoyed Geja's because it was timeless - it better be because the wait can be long and the meal is to be enjoyed slowly / casually. That tends to either endear or repel people. The food is OK, the sauces are fun, but again, it's less about the food and more about talking and relaxing over a meal. The alcoves and lack of a dining room type area make for a very romantic setting. Start with a cheese fondue with your wine, select an entree meat (beef, chicken or seafood) with many different sauces to dip and sample, and conclude with a flaming chocolate fondue to roast a marshmallow or dip pound cake or strawberries into. Add a coffee or cappucino and you need a wheelbarrow to wheel you back to your car. The entire experience may be three hours so you need to be with someone you enjoy being with and can hold a conversation with. If you plan on looking at your iPhone the entire time, or have somewhere else to be then you need to go elsewhere.

I went with 2 friends and we got the cheese platter for 2 and the chocolate fondue for 3. Overall, we liked the cheese platter better. It was definitely a lot of cheese, more than enough, I'd highly recommend it. The chocolate fondue was okay. We thought we'd get more food then served but didn't. And it's fruit with chocolate. I'm not sure what I expected, maybe something more extravagant? We thought the cheese was fairly priced but fruit was a little expensive.  The best part, or worse for some, of the dinner was when this guy started screaming, crying and making a huge scene. We had no idea what was going on but found out later that his partner broke up with him during their dinner. Talk about the most dramatic dinner in the most romantic setting.

It was sour tasting and neither of us ate any of it.  We got the beef and chicken fondue for the main course and it was DELICIOUS. I was so happy with it.

However, as we worked our way through the platter, the oil began coating the food a bit more.  It was less of a problem with the meat, but oil coated broccoli?  Oil coated peppers?  Not so hot.  It started to feel VERY heavy when we were around 2/3 in.  The chocolate course was tasty, but nothing special.  I kept trying to place the flavor of the chocolate...and it was kinda like chocolate syrup.  A little too sweet for my preference.

You know like at Melting Pot or Fogo de Chao they introduce themselves and how the restaurant works and what they suggest etc...  We had to ask for things multiple times and every time we said we were ready for the next course he would ask us if we were sure like 3 times. ""Are you 100% sure?"" ""Really?"" YES!!!!  Throughout the meal the server and his back waiters kept spilling water on us! They would reach entirely over our plates with dripping pitchers and then overfill the glasses till they ran all over the table.  The food was really not that great either. The cheese was disappointingly plain, and the salad was so soaked with dressing I could hardly eat it. You cook everything in oil for the entree and can't even eat your veggies raw if you wanted because they are mingling on the plate with raw meat. I honestly thought the chocolate just tasted like melted chocolate chips. Nothing special at all.  You also got a very weak variety of dippers for both the cheese and chocolate courses. Just apples, grapes and bread for the cheese then apples, bananas, strawberries, cake, marshmallows, and pineapple for the chocolate. The Melting Pot gives a far superior selection!  In terms of the price I think if the food and service was actually good it might have been reasonable.  I would not return to this restaurant or recommend it to anyone! Go to the Melting Pot.

Although I was not seated at a booth, I did not find the table seating to be too ""cozy"" because the table was located in the back corner of the restaurant. That being said, it was particularly dark in that area because there was no lighting overhead. I would highly recommend bringing a flashlight (I did, and that made cooking a lot easier because I could tell when the food was fully cooked!). The service was excellent. Our waiter kindly explained how everything worked, and told us about any additional charges (e.g., $8 plate-sharing charge). I only ordered one premier dinner (the Prince Geja Combination), which proved to be enough to satisfy two people.  The cheese fondue was excellent. I didn't think it was too rich, which is usually my main concern with dairy foods.  The main course had at least two of each of the meat options, and a good assortment of vegetables. I was not bothered by the smell of the oil, and only noticed it when I sat down. The oil never splattered out of the pot. The chocolate fondue was not very special, but I still enjoyed it.

2010-07-05,4.0,"I'll break my review down into sections, so that I can rave about Geja's fantastic atmosphere and food, but also make a critical comment about the service. ATMOSPHERE: Geja's is a very romantic fondue restaurant, the kind you would see artfully constructed on a film set. Dim lighting, warm tones, textured walls, dark wood & glass, rich fabrics -- all come together to give it a sense of an old and classy Southern-Europe place. Reserve a booth, as the tables are cramped. It's a great place for a date, but I've also impressed out-of-town guests by taking them here. You don't have to dress up for this restaurant, but it's a great reason to put on a good outfit and have a classy night out. You can easily spend 2-3 hours here if you're having their full four-course dinner, so don't come here with people you can't have a conversation with. The length of the average meal is also why it's best to make reservations, as they have limited seating per night. FOOD: At roughly $50 per person, the full dinner seems just a tad pricey, but the amount is generous: starter salad, full cheese course, full meat/fish course, and chocolate dessert course. The salad is simple, with a lovely dressing. The cheese course is my favorite, with a nice kick  to the cheese, and a selection of breads and apples. The main course is intense, and includes all kinds of seafood, meat, and vegetable options. They give you 10 sauces with all of that food, but I think only three or four would suffice (still, you have options). The chocolate course comes with marshmallows, cake, and fruit. It's a great selection, but the chocolate course is my least favorite, as the chocolate itself tastes cheap. Some reviewers did not like the main course, because it involved preparing your own food inside a hot oil pot, but I think that's part of the charm. You really take your time, sampling and eating a bit at a time, all the while enjoying relaxed conversation.  I'm clumsy and I've never hurt myself or ruined the meal.  However, I would easily recommend not having the full dinner and just having the $20 cheese & chocolate option. You will be SO full after the full dinner that you will want to just go home and pass out (so not ideal if you're picking Geja's for a date!). The cheese & chocolate option is still quite a lot of food, but not as heavy and massive as the full meal. After your first visit, if you sign up for their guest list, you will constantly get updates about deals and promotions. So if this place is so great, why am I not giving it the 5 stars that I would like? The service: SERVICE: Service here is polite and efficient, particularly the ""extra"" table staff. However, the servers themselves are unpleasant. Every single time I have been here (and I have been here on many occasions, bringing in different guests) my servers seem alternately bored or angry.  In particular, if you do not pad your bill by ordering a lot of alcohol, they get downright surly. If you say ""no"" to their offer of a drink, they often get this look of resignation and yank the drink menu out of your hand. Last time I came here was the first time I opted just for the cheese & chocolate menu, and my waiter seemed to boil with a silent rage. I actually felt pressured to make up for my choice by ordering a drink, but that didn't help. He pouted and frowned for the remainder of our meal, making it very unpleasant. I understand that with the length of the meal they do not get many tip opportunities. I understand that customer gift certificates might further bring down the tab. But making their frustrations so obvious to the customers hurts the atmosphere of the restaurant and it does NOT help their cause. I tip generously for good service and experience, and don't appreciate it when a server makes an assumption based on my order.  For a restaurant that is as much about atmosphere as the food, the service at Geja's deserves a critical note. Extra note on WINE:  I can't say too much about the alcohol. I got wine here twice and was not too impressed with it, but it wasn't terrible. I got a sangria once, and though it was fairly decent it was tiny.",0.998,0.755,0.167,0.078,0.5909424603174607

The fanciness is a uniquely American thing.) The cheese and chocolate combo with a bottle of wine won't make your wallet cry like the oil-boiled meat dishes will. The guitarists add to the atmosphere, and I enjoy them more than I do at most restaurants.  They keep it classy.

Not so much.  I gave the hostess our name, and she said there was no reservation.  I mentioned that I had just confirmed it that evening, she checked her records again, and said that she had given away our table since it took us so long to park.  No phone call, no ""but we'll make sure to get you the next table available.""  So much for our special evening.  We waited around for a half an hour to try to get seated anyway, but eventually gave up and left.",0.3071,0.812,0.099,0.088,0.534018759018759
2010-05-13,5.0,"I have been here multiple times and absolutely LOVE it! This place puts Melting Pot to shame. I've never been a fan of fondue until I've been to this restaurant so you have to give it a chance if you're unsure. One great perk is signing up for their email and you will always receive coupons.  We always make reservations and have never had to wait when we show up. The portion of food is a lot, especially for the price!!! The ambiance is relaxing and romantic. Although I've also booked dinner there once with a bunch of friends for a birthday and we all had a blast. Sometimes there is live music which is nice.  Make sure to ask for Michelle if she's there. She is such a great waitress and always checks up on us. I love her! They are so quick to refill your drinks and pick up your plates. There is literally someone standing around just to do that, seriously? How much more attentive can they be? It's great!!

2010-05-05,4.0,"For a special night out, my girlfriend and I recently used a $25 off Geja's coupon I had lying around. Since she and I are both vegetarian, this meant our entire 4 course meal totaled around $30, pretty much a steal in the city. They run offers like this all the time, and while the surf and turf style meals are pretty pricey, veggie or chicken lovers can really come out ahead on these things. The full meal includes a salad, cheese fondue with fruit and bread, the entree of your choice, and chocolate fondue with coffee or tea. The meal was epic. I mean, aside from the lovely cheese and fresh bread, the amount of vegetables we were given for our entree was intimidating. We definitely left about an entire eggplant behind (don't hate, we had to limit ourselves somewhere, and between mushrooms and eggplant, mushrooms will win every time).  All in all, the service was excellent (we lucked upon a fellow vegetarian who didn't judge out non-meat loving ways or think we were trying to skimp out on the expensive stuff. The food was great.

They were 3 times larger than the scallops in the PG Combo.  I'm not usually into cheese, but the cheese fondue was phenomenal as it was admixed with white wine. It was definitely the highlight of the meal. It was served with apples, bread, and assorted veggies. The chocolate fondue was okay -- would've liked more pound cake for dipping.

My girlfriend and I ordered the cheese & chocolate 3-course meal and split it.  Having already eaten a pretty heavy lunch, this was more than enough food.  The salad was good and the cheese fondue was excellent; the bread and veggies were too big to dip and eat so we had to cut them ourselves - food here is labor-intensive!  I'd say, at least for this course, the work was worth it. We were expecting the chocolate fondue to be like melted Hersheys chocolate chips.  What we got instead was more like Herseys chocolate syrup - good...but not as good as it could have been.  If i wanted to dip stuff into chocolate syrup, I could do it at home for $5.  The fresh fruit, berries and marshmallows were great and the pound cake was good, but I wish that the chocolate could have been melted rather than syrup.

2010-04-29,4.0,"Having experienced at-home fondue and Melting Pot fondue, I'm a fan. When I saw this place come up with a fantastic deal on Groupon, I had to jump on it. And it ended up working out perfectly for the ""date day"" my girlfriend and I had planned. Not wanting to spend over our allotted $50, we got the cheese/chocolate fondue special (roughly $20 each) with extra veggies. We later learned I could have ordered a meat fondue a-la-carte, and she could have ordered the cheese/chocolate special so we could have tried everything. Oh well, next time! The waitress was very helpful and friendly, and I hardly event noticed she was training someone at the same time. She was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. The atmosphere was cozy and dark. Once you adjust it isn't so bad, and it certainly was a nice romantic spot. Plus it has to be dark so you can be awed by the flaming food of awesome! Now on to the food. The cheese fondue was amazing. None of the liquor ""bite"" that I've experienced in some fondues - just smooth cheesy goodness. I liked the mushrooms, onions, and bread the best. I would definitely say go for the extra veggies - the apples, grapes, and bread just don't give you the full experience. After having had a large late lunch, we were already feeling full after the cheese fondue. The chocolate fondue was good but...honestly, I was a little disappointed. It tasted a little like hot fudge or chocolate syrup to me - not real melted chocolate. Personally I think Melting Pot does chocolate fondue better. This just wasn't what I hoped for. The fruits were super fresh though, and I had no problem eating them up with only a little bit of the chocolate. While we didn't try the meat fondue, several of our neighbors did and they seemed to really be enjoying it. When we got our check we were given a flyer to get a $25 gift certificate for special occasions- hell yeah! We will definitely return for our year anniversary and have the meat fondue.",0.997,0.742,0.222,0.036,0.5637877373171494

2010-04-28,5.0,"Geja's Cafe was my first fondue experience ever. Once the bar is set here,  it's an almost impossible act to follow.  My dining experience at Geja's was actually in the summer of 2009, but I'm happy to say I can still remember many fond memories from that night. My friend and I had just come from the Ginza Festival over at the Midwest Buddha Temple and were feeling a bit peckish for some bonafide Lincoln Park cuisine. We'd scouted out some high-end places to eat beforehand and decided Geja's would be the perfect fit to end the day's excursions.  We walked down the steps to the lower level entrance (which was simply adorable, adding a hint of exclusivity to the experience). We were greeted right away by the hostess and were asked if we had reservations. Unfortunately we hadn't thought that far ahead, so the wait was going to be about 20 minutes. We stuck it out and sat in the ""waiting area"" (which was barely big enough to hold 4-5 people). Thankfully we were the only ones there. Eventually we were seated, rather ""cozily"", in between two other small tables. If anything, my biggest complaint was the size of the restaurant. Unless you get a booth, you'll literally be rubbing elbows with your neighbor -- a little too close for comfort for my taste. Once we were seated, we examined the menu and realized we were going to be dropping some major moola on our meal. Turns out you had to order a 3 course meal in order to get the full experience. The price left both of us a bit shell shocked, but we agreed it would be a nice treat to indulge ourselves this one time. They started us off with the cheese fondue (paired with bread and fruit) and it was simply delicious. Feeling practically satiated, I'd almost forgotten we still had a main course to get through! They soon came over with the pot of oil and ""heavy duty"" skewers, which intimidated me a little bit. They brought out an enormous platter full of raw beef, chicken and vegetables with 8 dipping sauces. We dove right in, skewering our meat and veggies and ploppin' 'em in the vat of bubbling oil. It was fun fighting over who's skewer was whose and sometimes even losing what you were cooking and have it succumb to the depths! I can see why people say this is a perfect date place. It's great because it *is* so interactive and you can have fun with it. A truly memorable dining experience! Just when we thought we couldn't possibly eat anymore, there was still dessert. Needless to say, we made the room! Absolutely delectable chocolate fondue with fruit, marshmallows and pound cake. I have no idea how we piled it all in, but it was so worth it. We rounded out the meal with a simple cup of coffee and some time to unwind and digest. I could have spent all night there, taking in the warm ambiance and just simply enjoying the moment. We didn't want to leave. I can see why Geja's has been a mainstay in Lincoln Park for so many years. I remember my parents talking about going there 25 years ago and saying how great it was. I'm happy to report not much as changed, from one generation to the next. I can't wait to go back!",0.9981,0.783,0.17,0.047,0.5815219895408574

The 12 or so sauces they give you really makes you feel like you've had 10 different meals. I don't like to work too hard for my food, so keeping track of the cooking times was a bit frustrating, but I would assume that is to be expected from any fondue place.  The wine list is overwhelming, so I just randomly picked something. Cheese and fruit starter was the bomb too.  So don't bring your buddies here after a pick up game of basketball or anything, cause this a intimate low lit spot. Space is kind of tight, but in a good way.

2010-04-15,5.0,"I don't have a whole lot of 5 star reviews, but this one is by far the most deserving.  Comparing the Melting Pot to this place is like comparing McDonalds to the Weber Grill. Geja's Cafe blows the Melting Pot so far out of the water it's ridiculous.   Normally, when you go out to eat you will end up at a place that can be considered amongst one of the three following categories:  1. expensive with very good quality but hardly any quantity. These are your typical ""artistic"" looking meals for presentation 2. not very good, but you are given a whole crap load to eat 3. ""Just ok"" with a decent amount to eat that will leave you feeling somewhat full by the end of the meal. This is your, ""Sure, I'd go there again"" type food because it was totally affordable, you were able to eat it without feeling like you'd throw it back up, and once again it was totally affordable! THEN, there is Geja's Cafe. This place is for the fondue lover whether it be cheese or chocolate. I heart both cheese and chocolate, so it was heaven. The quality was matched perfectly with the quantity that it was almost sick. The food here had us saying ""mmmmm"" after just about every bite AND we were so full by the end that we were breathing heavily the whole way home. It literally took us about 2 hours and 45 minutes to finish our food (which btw we didn't finish it all), partly because we were savoring each bite. This place can be somewhat on the pricey side, or it can actually be very affordable. You have your options. Just like the chocolate? Stopping by for the dessert platter might set 2 ppl back at about $15 (incl. tip). There is sooo much chocolate, fruit, cake, etc. though that you will consider it more than well worth it. The same goes for those just getting the cheese fondue (which comes with and endless amount of bread, grapes, and apples). They only have the original Swiss fondue here made with gruyere cheese, but that doesn't even matter. The fondues are also not your typical ""chain"" fondue places that serve the types of mixes that remain somewhat thick even after having been on the burner forever like *cough* The Melting Pot *cough*.  Like meat, seafood and veggies? Well, cook the lot in oil and dip it in any of the 10 or so unique sauce choices they give you and you got yourself a party!  The actual meat/seafood dishes can be pricey per person (depending on what you get since lobster is incl. in some of them), but I have definately spent more on a special occasion and have had less both in quality and quantity. Going out for a birthday or anniversary? It will not break your bank. For two people (we ate for about  three) we had 3 courses of different types of delicious fondues to share (1. cheese, 2. meat/seafood/veggies, and 3. chocolate). This included all of the dipping food for the cheese and chocolate fondues, and four glasses of wine = a little over $100 w/out tip. I can go on about the food, but I think the service and atmosphere deserve as much credit. This place is so cute and romantic that it makes you all smiley when you walk in. The lighting is very dim and much of it comes from candle light, the tables are surrounded by bottles of wine stored in the walls, the hanging fixtures are very ""hip"", and the booths are semi-private with nice drapery along the sides.   The service is also excellent. They are very polite, and they make you feel very welcomed. I highly recommend that you give this place a try over another fondue restaurant is you are considering this type of cuisine.",0.9984,0.829,0.15,0.021,0.5655573570327669

Your first thought is if you are trapped in a wine cellar and where's the nearest exit. The food is especially ""meh"". I like fondue, I don't love it, but the main entree doesn't warrant this place to have amazing food. You are cooking the meats in oil so you'll have to be careful of the splatter. It doesn't really give the food that much flavor. Yes, there are sauces, but I think its worth coming here for cheese or chocolate fondue and just skip the meal. I hate to say this, but I think the Melting Pot has better fondue. At least you can cook your meats in different flavors of broth, which gives the food more flavor than just oil.  if it hadn't been for a  restaurant.com  coupon, I probably wouldn't have come since I don't think the full price is worth it.

2010-04-11,5.0,"Cheese, oil and chocolate? Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner! I took my boyfriend here for our anniversary on Friday night and upon walking into the cavernous space that is Geja's Cafe, we were immediately immersed into a one of kind romantic dining experience. The dark red lighting only complimented our sensual surroundings as we made our way to the bar.  I made reservations on  opentable.com  for 7:30 and called in advance to request a booth. Going on a date? I highly recommend calling in advance and requesting a booth -- they are first come, first serve, but once we walk ed in, the host confirmed our booth reservation. Waiting only about 15 to 20 minutes (enough time to enjoy a fantastic mojito at the bar) we were led to probably the best booth in the house - true story. The hostess who led us there asked us if we thought the booth was worth the (minimal) wait -- to which I emphatically replied,  ""Absolutely!""  Sitting across from one another with wine racks as our backdrop in our private booth, the most romantic dinner of my life thus far was only just beginning. While waiting at the bar I ordered an original mojito and my boyfriend had a glass of the house cabernet (yes, they make wine too!). Deciding beforehand to ""go big or go home,"" I knew I was going to order the Prince Geja's Premier Dinner: A wonderful sampling of aged beef tenderloin, sea scallops, lobster tail, jumbo shrimp, and chicken breast. My boyfriend ordered The Connoisseiur which is comprised of beef tenderloin, shrimp and lobster tail. Mmm, I'm getting hungry just writing this review....anyhow, the premier dinners are combinations and come with a cheese fondue appetizer, a main course and a chocolate fondue dessert.  Up first was the cheese fondue that comes with a basket of apples, grapes and several varities of cut up bread. The gruyere cheese was salty and peppery and it perfectly complimented the cold, sweet fruit and piecesof bread. This course also came with lightly dressed and seasoned salads -- which we both finished. We couldn't eat all the cheese and the goodies that came with it before ordering a bottle of the house cabernet sauvignon. Fantastic, fantastic wine, it was bold yet smooth, ideally matched to the multi-faceted flavor of the cheese.  The main course came out to us side by side on a silver platter comprised of various vegetables and 8 dipping sauces. I can't name the other 7 for you because I was enamored with the horseradish sauce. I mean, phenomenal -- with the steak, chicken and scallops! Our server was amazing and told us exactly how to cook each meat which of course, is really based on individual preference.  We took our time cooking, talking and eating, really savoring both the food and one another's company. I couldn't believe it but a leisurely meal such as this made me fall even more in love with my boyfriend. After our main course aka a total wipeout of our food, they brought out the flaming chocolate. FLAMING. CHOCOLATE.  With about every fruit known to man, slices of poundcake and such, we happily, though nearly comatose, dipped our new fondue forks with skewered fruits into the bubbling chocolate. Also, I should mention, that after we finished our bottle of vino, I then ordered a Mexican coffee (read: coffee with tequila). I can't remember much of anything else as at this point  I'm a 5'0 Filipina with a good amount of rum, wine and tequila in her...I do know that my boyfriend lovingly and graciously escorted me through the cave that is Geja's once we finished our 3 hour dinner. I also do know that our server was highly knowledgable and very friendly. Actually the entire staff from the host and hostess to our server and the lady at the coatcheck was very kind.  I love Geja's and I'll definitely be back -- no place like it exists, and don't give me that Melting Pot bullshit.

The ceilings are low, the table are JAMMED in. Going to the bathroom was like an obstacle course. That goodness no one was coming down the aisles opposite of me. It would have been a game of chicken. Top this off with very low lighting. Now, I understand the ambiance thing. But, seriously, I can't see if my chicken is cooked or if I was sitting across from the correct person!

Geja's supposedly one of the most understandably romantic restaurants in Chicago. The Fondu was Fontastic!  Anyhow food was great. For App: we had a plate of 6 cheeses and a bottle of the house wine...extremely reasonable considering...cheeses were delicious! And we even talked about coming back simply for a cheese and wine outing sometime.  For dinner, I ordered ""the connoisseur"" which translated into surf and turf. Pure awesomeness...the veggies were great...and we both loved the idea of cooking our own food in minutes. I think that is the primary reason it was such a neat place for us...the simple idea of a unique dining experience with a romantic atmosphere... That said, I would recommend bringing glow sticks or a phone with a good reading light because the menu is extremely difficult to read with the lighting. In addition, my wife freaks out about meat that is undercooked so when the waitress (who was extremely sweet) said, ""chicken is about 3 minutes, steak is 2, shrimp and lobster 1, give or take"" we kind of just looked at one another... the whole give or take comment meant add at least one minute to make sure...ease her mind more or less.

This place is SERIOUSLY romantic and I'll probably never come back here unless I'm on a date. However, my poor judgment in dinner companion aside (I still love you girl, but next time I'm coming here with a man), Geja's is absolutely to die for and I can't wait to make a return visit. I can't say much past what has already been stated here. The cheese is absolutely the most divine thing I've ever put in my mouth and when we ran out of ""dippers"" for the chocolate, we simply asked for spoons so we could eat the rest of the fondue straight out of the bowl. That's how good it was. My only complaints are that this place is definitely a type of 'catacomb' so it's incredibly difficult to maneuver through between the tables and it's super dim and hard to read the menu. That's part of the mystery and ""romance"" of Geja's though and you should know that going into it. Also, my roommate and I sat at our table for 10 minutes without being greeted by a server although two walked by and made eye contact with us.

I thought the apple and cheese was surprisingly the best. I could taste the liquor they put in it. Not that I wanted too. The chocolate was fondue was fun when we were able to roast marshmallows on the flame. The chocolate itself was too bitter for my taste and I dont think all the items complimented it. Melons & grapes? ew. The service was great. Sucks that they only have a one bathroom stall and it is hard to navigate to get there.  Worth the $25 i spent using my groupon.

You just want to stay forever. However, the food was also notable. The cheese fondue was THE BEST. My philosophy in life is that everything is better with cheese, so I basically just wanted to drink this stuff. I restrained myself, but wasn't happy about it.  Besides being delicious, the whole meal was just fun. My boyfriend and I are not very good at managing our fondue (stuff was falling off those little sticks left and right), but honestly that was all part of the fun. Here's a little lesson we learned: don't put too much stuff in the pot at once. We ended up cooking everything pretty quickly. Next time I'd only do one or two things at a time to slow down the pace of the meal. You get so much food here that taking it slow is the best way to make sure it all fits in your tummy! My only tiny complaint is that the smell of propane does take away from your romantic meal a bit, but what can they really do about that? All in all, this is one of my new favorite places in Chicago.

I has pictured something looking more like an upscale opium den, but in a good way. What we got was this gorgeous cave with lots of little nooks and crannies to sit in. We were seated in the open space though. It's got a very ambient lighting as well and nice soft music playing throughout the place (no live music when we were there). Let's go step by step. Cheese Fondue was awesome. I didn't want to stop eating it. My only complaint (which will surface a view more times), is that it's a little too dark. If you're picky like me, you like to be able to see your food. I could not tell between onion bread and french bread without smelling it, much to the annoyance of the girl. So I just stuck to pumpernickel and they were happy to bring us extra.  Next was our meats. I have beef tenderloin and chicken and the girl has beef tenderloin and scallops. It was good. Again, my complaint would be, it's hard to tell if my beef was the right color in the center or if my chicken was cooked through because it was so dark. The dipping sauces were ok, but nothing to write home about. Too thin if you ask me. They didn't really stick to the meat too well.  Let's finish up with a bang. CHOCOLATE GOD DAMN FONDUE FOR THE WIN! Oh man, it was sooo good. I loved the short term fire and the ability to roast marshmallows that it afforded us. To quote the lady ""That there is a marshmallow dipped in pudding"" I also enjoyed the pound cake and the apples, but I think my favorite dipper would be the maraschino cherries. Very tasty.

We got the International and I would most likely go for straight shrimp and steak next time as scallops and lobster don't hold up as well when essentially deep-fried.  The array of sauces complimented the meats and veggies quite well, with brocolli and dill being my favorites. Chocolate fondue was almost too much but a romantic way to end the meal.  We were supposed to meet friends out afterwards but declined because I almost killed the bubby when I nearly busted a button that would have shot him dead. Side note:  Only annoying thing here are the uber lovey dovey couples.  We were blessed (note the sarcasm) to sit next to a couple of barely legal nerds non-stop feeding each other fondue all night.  They'd purposely miss the other's mouth so they can be of service to clean up the mess in whatever way they chose.  BARF.   Not to mention they had a ton of pimples and the guy was wearing a Texas flag tie.  They prob got the pimples from all that hot oil splattering on their face.

The included coffee and whipped cream were a nice break before the chocolate fondue came out.  The chocolate, pound cake, pineapple, strawberries, and cherries were quite indulgent but truly enjoyed.  We were so full by the time we left that the belts definitely had notch released.  Both of us dined, with two glasses of wine, and tip for just under $100.  I see this as a great value for the experience.

Yeah, I know... pretty messed up, right? That's how much food I ate.  Anyway, I took the BF here for a taste of romance and since I can't offer to cook for him because of my less than stellar cooking skillz, I figured I could sort of play this off. We had never done fondue before so it was defo a learning experience. The food was all delicious, our servers and even bus boys were entertaining and really went above and beyond to make sure we had a great night. We enjoyed the cheese appetizer, the BF got the scallop meal, I got the veggie meal (which I will say is overpriced for just a handful of veggie pieces- FYI), and we got the dessert plate full of marshmallows, pound cake, grapes, apples, strawberries, and pineapple, and a pitcher of sangria. We enjoyed everything but overall, I think it will likely be my last venture into fondue... well, maybe I'd be up for just an appetizer int he future but, the thing is, I'm a lazy person and the kind of person who just likes to enjoy the actual eating portion of dinner, not the cooking. The whole date reminded me of the time I thought it'd be cute and fun to go rock climbing on a date... until I realized how much f*cking work it is. It was all just very stressful and sh*t kept falling off my skewers, I kept having to try and fish things out of the oil, Operation style, with the skinny azz skewers. It just helped me realize that cooking, in any capacity, is not my thing.  It is romantic though. The lighting, the decor, the curtained booths... it would have totally set the tone if I hadn't eaten so much that even I was scared to see myself naked as I changed into my PJs that night. I'd say it's a great place to stop for an appetizer plate before a movie but not something I'd want for a full meal before a date. Between all that cheese and oil, I thought I'd have to be rolled outta there. Seriously, if there had been a fire, I wouldn't have been able to get out in time, I was moving so slow after. Also, you stink like a grill when you leave... might as well have gone to a greasy spoon. Your whole body and all your hair is just caked in that oil smell and makes your eyelids heavy and just want to pass out. Not for me.

2010-02-15,4.0,"I wanted to go to Geja's for Chicago Restaurant week. I had done Melting Pot for the same occasion last year and enjoyed it, so I thought I would stick with my made up tradition and go to Geja's this year. In passing, I mentioned it to my gentleman friend two days before Valentine's, and lo and behold he got a reservation for Valentine's Day weekend. I'm sure you can see how this was difficult given that this, according to some, is one of the most romantic restaurants in the city. He was very persistent and the manager took pity on the poor guy that wanted to impress his girl. For this alone, I would give the restaurant 5 stars but since this site is all about being honest, I have to say my piece. Negatives- -Cramped tables: Unless you get a booth, you will probably run out of room on your table. With the wine and water glasses, small plates, oil pot and cheese pot, there is just not enough real estate to be comfortable. -Heating mechanism: Melting pot does this so much better and safer. Their pots actually sit inside special tables and aren't heated by an actual flame. I'm a fan of this because you don't run the risk of catching on fire and there is more even heating of cheese/oil/chocolate. Also, at Geja's, the pots sit so highly up on the camp fire stoves that I felt like I was peering over and into the pot....not safe with the oil. -Fondue forks: Didn't really spear and hold on to the food as well as I would have liked. We would loose a lot of things in the oil and have to go fishing for them. Again...hot oil and poking around with a blunt fork=not safe Positives- -Great atmosphere: Dimly lit, candle light, and Spanish guitarist will definitely help set the mood. -Good Service: Server was knowledgeable, but then again, they have a limited menu (Fondue, Fondue, and Fondue) so it's not like the server had to be THAT well versed. -Valentine's Day: Before you walked into the restaurant on Valentine's day, they set up a photo-op where you can get a complimentary picture taken with your and your date. They print out the photo and give it to you during dinner. All very Carnival Cruise Line, but the cheesy girl in me came out and loved it.  All in all great experience, especially because they were so accommodating, but the food was not as good as the Melting Pot's.",0.9974,0.762,0.194,0.045,0.5220505375383424
2010-02-07,4.0,"Arguably the most romantic restaurant in Chicago, as suggested by the Tribune, Geja's Cafe is fondue spot that is definitely worth visiting..and here's why: - Stellar ambiance for an evening with that special somebody. - Cheese fondue...AMAZING. A gruyere served with a variety of breads and fruit. - Meat and seafood were primo..particularly the scallops, lobster tail, and aged beef tenderloin. - Chocolate fondue flamed with an orange liqueur tasted so good. Beyond all of the food though, the service was excellent. I've been to Geja's Cafe multiple times, one of which was an anniversary. During that visit, the house offered a complimentary bottle of champagne. Come on, you can't beat that. In addition to that, the restaurant sends gift certificates via mail and sends email notifications of special events. The only thing I would peg Geja's for is the lack of selection of broths for the main entrees. It is an oil fondue, just to cook the meats and seafood. They do, however, make up for this with a tray of sauces. I would give Geja's Cafe 4.5 stars, but yelp doesn't like halves.",0.852,0.86,0.103,0.037,0.4866300366300366

It was probably the most romantic place i've been in the city, a dark, dimly lit, cozy cave.  My wife didn't like the amount of nutmeg in the cheese fondue, it was a bit overpowering.  The chocolate fondue was excellent. The service was top notch, and the waiters have deadly accuracy with a water pitcher, they can hit your glass from across the room without spilling a drop. That being said, i guess the only thing we didnt like was the amount of nutmeg in the cheese fondue, and also the fact that it was a bit too cramped, oh there was one other..... yeah...I was ear raped.  The fucking whores in the booth next to us that couldnt keep their voices under 90db about cheating on their boyfriends, and how their sexual needs hadn't been fulfilled and a whole bunch of other bullshit that was forcefully shoved into my ear without my consent.  At one point my wife used the restroom, so i decided to count how many times they uttered the word ""like"" throughout their conversation....208 in 6 minutes..........

I'll take one of those, a side of adorable mandolin player, a dash of dark sultry curtains, heaping portions of meat and seafood to dip in vats of cheese... and I'm pretty sure that's the way straight to my heart.  The portions here are really big, so you'll have to exercise your stomach before you make it in. The best bet is to go with one of the combination meals, which comes with an appetizer, entree, and dessert fondue. One portion is enough for two people, but when I make the trek to Chicago to see a particularly gluttonous friend of mine, we order two of those bad boys. That's just how we roll. I digress. The highlight of my meal at Geja's is always the coffee, which is paired with endless cups of fresh whipped cream. It comes with the meal, and actually may help in preventing many a food-coma induced accident. Genius! Also, service is incredible, and, in my case, the afterservice as well. At the tail end of my last Chicago trip, I dropped my wallet in one of the booths.

Very smoky so you will need to dry clean whatever you wear. And a bit pricey for cooking your own food. You will be more full and have better service at Zed451 but of course, that's not Fondu!

As the previous yelpers have mentioned, this place can only be romantic if you have a booth. Otherwise, it's just like any other dimly lit restaurant - still perfect for a casual date or any get together. Actually, it wasn't ""dimly lit"". It was dark as hell. Fortunately, the candles provided just enough light to get around...so I really don't know what everyone is complaining about.  The food wasn't orgasmic, but it was definitely above average. I think the only way a person cannot enjoy it is if they don't pay any mind to the cooking times given by the waiters because everything I cooked accordingly came out perfect. If you're a seafood lover, DEFINITELY go for the ""Deluxe Seafood"" and then dip everything in butter...because everything tastes better with butter. They include 8 other sauces...but I still dipped everything in butter... I'm such a fatty.... ANYWAY, if you're confused and can't decide whether you love meat more than seafood, then go for the Prince Geja's Combination - you get a little bit of everything but just enough to get you full. Speaking of which, the food is PERFECTLY portioned for the average person. So don't be a fat-ass and complain about not having enough because this restaurant made me nap afterwards. Cheese and chocolate fondue with every meal.  The service, on the other hand, was orgasmic. I fell in love with our waitress.

My wonderful mother brought me here to kick-off my bday week. We had such a splendid time. I'm not even sure how to describe the decor. It's dark in there and on purpose, but there's a soft orangish lighting that complements the wood carvings and curtains on the openings to their comfy booths. Ah, but let's talk about the victuals! We both selected a premiere dinner which is a wonderful choice if you want a full meal. It includes a small salad, cheese fondue w/bread &amp; fruit, your selection of entree, and dessert fondue. The salad comes out with the cheese fondue. It's lightly dressed with a vinaigrette and just enough to get your palette ready for the glorious parade of flavors to follow. The cheese fondue was a little sharp for my liking with the bread pieces, but was easily balanced when eaten with the fruit. The entree comes out next which you cook yourself in a thin broth-like oil base, much like a hot-pot at Chinese restaurants. With your meat selection (entree) comes great veggies cut into bite-sized pieces (i.e., potatoes, mushrooms, onions) and 8 different sauces for dipping. My fav sauces being the dill, spicy mayo, garlic, and teriyaki. Although, I feel I got more dipping sauce on my shirt that I did in my mouth, lol. My entree was The International and consisted of bite-sized portions of chicken, beef tenderloin, and jumbo shrimp. It was so great! Last was the ""piece de reistance"", the chocolate fondue! It's accompanied by a platter of fruit and cake pieces, along with marshmallows that you can roast when they flambe the chocolate. Oh, that chocolate is absolutely divine!!!!!! Mmmmmmmmmmnnnnnnnnnn. . . . I seriously dreampt about it when I went to sleep that night. I recommend letting a cake piece sit in the pot for like 10 seconds so it soaks all the way through. You'll taste all the unique flavors in the chocolate at once. I'm trying to re-live that moment as I type this. Sigh. Even though I had a peach of a time with my mother, Geja's would rank high on my list of great romantic date spots. The ambiance and intimate setting is great for romance.

Dessert: melted chocolate fondue pot with a generous plate of pound cake/apples/pineapple/grapes/melon/toasted marshmellows   If there is anything overrated about this place, it is probably the portions.

Melting Pot wins on dollar value for meat, you get way more there in the Big Night Out than you do for the full dinners here. The two tie for meat selection. Melting Pot also wins hands down on desserts - so many different selections and you get to make your own if you desire.

While people say it is small, I think that gives it a more intimate setting.  We were a few minutes early, and still waiting for one of our party members, so we waited around the bar area, and took in the beautiful flickering candles and general ambiance.  Once seated... we were in a comfortable booth, which was perfect because their were 4 of us.  Our waiter was very helpful, as we had never been there before. He explained all of the different dinners and combination.  Fortunately, I was with a group that really liked to eat, so we went all out and ordered the Prince Geja's Combination. Wow, talk about a lot of food:  We started with a salad and the cheese-fondue... the melted cheese was full of flavor! Very good! Then came the meats: Aged beef tenderloin,  lobster tail, jumbo shrimp, Atlantic sea scallops and boneless chicken breast. I especially appreciated the variety of assorted dipping sauces that accompanied the dinner course.  Once word: ridiculous. But in a good way! It was a ridiculous amount of food and it was ridiculously good. We enjoyed doing our little meat-cooking session, even though we were all a bit apprehensive at first. Our waiter answered our questions and was very helpful. All of the meats/seafood were excellent, it was hard to pick a favorite!  We all ate so much, it was difficult to eat much dessert, we all had one or two dips of the yummy flaming chocolate dessert fondue then had to call it quits before the food-coma set in....

2009-09-09,4.0,"Geja's Cafe is a pretty darn good fondue restaurant and don't let anybody tell you otherwise. What it lacks in space it more than makes up for in ambiance, food quality, and service.  Upon entering you are greeted by the Maitre D' dressed in a sleek suit and are asked if you have a reservation. Our reservation was for 8:30 on a Sunday night. We arrived around 8:15 and were told they were running about 10 minutes behind. We were pointed to the lounge area (more like a small bar with a few seats and a table in the corner) and we waited there until the Maitre D' called our names around 8:45.  We were seated at a small table towards the back of the restaurant and while we had enough room to be comfortable, we could tell that people in other sections of the restaurant were crammed for space.  A quick look over the wine list (they had a pretty decent selection, though nothing to write home about) and we were ready to order our wine. My GF ordered a glass of the sweet Riesling and I ordered a glass of the pinot noir. The pinot was delicate though not terribly complex (to be expected from a $8.50 glass of wine) and my girlfriend's sweet Riesling was, well, sweet (I'm not a huge fan of sweet white wines).  We ordered the Connoisseur for dinner which was a combination of the cheese and chocolate fondue, a side salad, and the beef tenderloin, shrimp, and lobster tail for the main.  The cheese fondue came out at the same time as the salad which was a little upsetting because I wanted to enjoy the salad first but the cheese fondue was quickly heating up to the point of almost burning, so I wanted to get to that quickly. The salad was actually delicious for as simple as it was. Just mescalin greens with a mustard vinaigrette. The cheese fondue was a Gruyere cheese and was absolutely fabulous. The breads and fruits that came with it were very fresh.  The main course was next and there was plenty to share for two people. Everything was very fresh which was much appreciated and, as instructed, everything on our plate (with the exception of the potatoes) was able to be cooked in 2 minutes. The cooking oil was the proper temperature and we were each given 4 skewers for multiple items. The plate came with a ton of veggies (all of which were also very fresh) and everything tasted delightful.  I should also note that during the main course I ordered a glass of the red Zinfandel from California and I have to say that it was much better than the pinot noir. Great spice in this wine with dark fruit flavors and a deep ruby color. Very pleasant.  Finally, on to dessert. The meal comes with a chocolate fondue which they flambee with orange liqueur for a minute or two and invite you to toast your marshmallows in the flames. You are given an assortment of fresh fruit, pound cake, and marshmallows, all of which taste amazing in the chocolate. The meal also includes their coffee which is very tasty and we ordered a glass of sparking dessert wine (don't remember exactly which one) which was great.  All in all, a terrific meal. The only thing that was not to my liking was that we were not seated on time and that the restaurant on a whole was very cramped.",0.9978,0.836,0.149,0.014,0.5287442396313363

2009-08-17,4.0,"For our anniversary, my boyfriend surprised me by taking me to Geja's Cafe for dinner.  I had been craving fondue for a while now and was SO excited at the prospect of dipping food into yummy cheeses and chocolates.   We had reservations, but when we go there we were invited to go the bar for a drink so we could wait for a private booth.  It's pretty dark, but I thought it was romantic.  We were seated about 10 mins later and immediately became intrigued at the pot of oil over a flame in the middle of our table.  We grabbed our menus and pondered over them until our very friendly waitress came to explain it all to us.  We ordered the Premium Dinner-- which includes cheese fondue and a salad for an app, you and your companion's (separate) choice of meats, seafood and veggies for the main course and chocolate fondue for dessert.  It runs an average of $45 for each person depending on what you get.   I am a Fondue novice and was comfortable when they brought the cheese fondue and bread, grapes and apples to be poked and dipped.  The cheese was so delicious...it went so well with everything on the plate.  Next came the main course, which made me a little nervous because it was basically a platter with raw meat and veggies to be dipped and cooked in the now boiling oil on our table and then dunked in the 12 dipping sauces offered.  This was very new to me.  Our waitress was so nice and explained cooking times and tips for all of it.  It took some time to get the technique down, and though many a vegetable was lost in the bottom of the oil, the dinner was really yummy and quite entertaining.  My favorite was the shrimp. I was so full after dinner that I could barely choke down the flaming chocolate fondue and fruit, cake and marshmallows that came with it.  But oh, it was so good.  I would definitely just come back for dessert so I could enjoy it properly.     All in all it was one of the most fun dinners I have ever been to, and highly recommend it for a special occasion.  However, if you're looking for a super mellow evening and are not into literally working for your yummy food (or being semi-awkward), then you might want to venture elsewhere.",0.9975,0.794,0.185,0.021,0.46666631208297876

You immediately hear soft music playing, sometimes from a live flamenco guitarist, and sometimes from a music trac. Either way, it is relaxing and inviting. You check in with the host/hostess, and usually have to wait a while for a table. It is soooo worth it! If you continue on through the restaurant in the back, you will find the small bar. These people are known for their knowledge of wine. Take their advice, trust me! You can snack on cheese and crackers at the bar while you wait.  Once seated, you can choose from a wide variety of foods from their wonderful menu. I usually have the connoisseur. This consists of beef, lobster, and shrimp, and a variety of fresh vegetables. They set up the oil pot, so it is hot enough when you're ready to start cooking.  Your meal starts with delicious cheese in a pot, and a basket of grapes, apples, and pumpernickel bread. You also get a salad to start. Once you are finished with that, they bring your entree. They fully explain how to cook it, and how long to cook each thing. It is fun, even when you drop food off of your skewer.  The perfect ending to your meal is a pot of chocolate, and a basket of chunks of pineapple, pound cake, strawberries, and bananas. Oh, and I can't forget marshmallows. They light the liquor on top of the chocolate on fore which burns for a short time, so you can roast them. This is the best meal I've ever had, and the service is impeccable!

It's like you've descended into a cave and are worried about what lurks around the corner. Perhaps a trogloditic creature, or if you're lucky a fondue pot of hot cheese. You don't really know. Maybe the thought of that is thrilling to some, but to me it was a complete distraction. I imagine the intent is to produce a romantic ambiance, but the reality is that it makes you wonder what they are trying to hide. We showed up at 7:30pm, (in July, so it was still very bright outside) so trying to find our way to the table before our eyes adjusted was almost dangerous. I came within about a half inch of running straight into a pole. One of the corner booth seats has a pole nearby (which for some reason they attached a MIRROR to at about eye height) that's nearly impossible to see and only my instincts allowed me to evade it in time. I had to sit for 5 minutes to let my eyes adjust before i could even begin to see the menu. Overall the food was good. The cheese and dessert fondue were as expected, although the cheese tasted a bit ""off"".  I can't really describe why.  I was too pre-occupied with trying to see what i was doing to really enjoy the meat/veggie/oil fondue. The waiter said ""the chicken is cooked when its not pink in the middle"" (which I already knew). Herein lies the problem - The human eye cannot distinguish color at the level of darkness in the room. I think i cooked my food OK but I suppose I'll find out in a few hours. Really unnecessarily dark. Did I get my point across yet? Not sure if anyone at Geja's reads these reviews, but it seems to be a common theme. Turn the lights up and I'll be back.

Then the proportions were off, and we ran out of cheese way before we could finish the veggies. We had started rationing the cheese early, which made that course pretty anticlimactic and damn near stressful. The salad is nothing to yelp about, but the coffee is delicious. Loads of freshly whipped cream to dollop and heavenly with a few spoonfuls of chocolate fondue (of which there was plenty; it outlasted the dippers). This course was really well done--the pound cake was my favorite, with toasted marshmallow with a cherry on top as a close second. The servers and bussers were excellent.

2009-06-16,4.0,"My girlfriend and I decided to head to Geja's Cafe for our 4-year anniversary after some helpful research online(thank you yelpers). I'd say we had high expectations given some of our previous dining experiences in Chicago and Boston. Well, these expectations were definitely met and surpassed. I would not compare it so say...Everest as they are completely different. Geja's was definitely one of the most memorable and easily makes it into my top ten dining experiences.  We walked into the restaurant and were directed to the bar as I had a reso for 8:00pm, but the hostess suggested we grab a drink or glass of vino because a booth would soon be available. If you're presented with this option, I would highly suggest waiting it out for two reasons. First, the non-booth seating looked a little tight for a fondue experience. Second, the bartender was extremely helpful and pleasant. He suggested trying a glass of wine that we enjoyed so much I went with a bottle of it for dinner(some syrah-combo).  The waitress was very nice and attentive(but not too attentive). My girlfriend and I decided to go with the premier fondue flights which we well worth it in my opinion. I cannot recall which of us ordered ""PRINCE GEJA'S COMBINATION"" and who ordered ""THE CONNOISSEUR"" as we both shared the entire meal.  This was sooooooo much food and definitely somewhere fun and romantic to spend an entire evening. The fruits and breads were a great start with the Gruyère and Brandy fondue. The main course was a massive presentation of meats and seafood. I was a little skeptical of the seafood(scallops and lobster) given that I live in Boston now and am surrounded by some of the best seafood one could find. My skepticism was quickly squashed as the scallops and lobster were top notch.  I believe I read earlier in a review that you should be careful about what you wear as the oil can splatter. I wore a nice tie and blazer and walked out unstained (a feat I was quite impressed with myself since we had an absurd amount of wine and complimentary champagne). So I would not worry about leaving Geja's cafe stained unless you plan on throwing your food at your date.  The meal finished up with pound cake and fruits with the decadent Belgian chocolate. Feeling like gluttons, we ignored how full we were from the meal and indulged in the perfect and overwhelmingly chocolaty conclusion to our meal. The waitress heard us mention it was our anniversary and the next thing we knew she was back at our table with some complimentary champagne.  We struggled to finish the chocolate fondue, so the waitress wrapped it up so we could take it home and heat it up later. I'm only mentioning this because I was surprised to see this at a fondue establishment.  The bill was modest when you think about how much food and the great experience we had. In all reality you could not find a better meal for the price range at Geja's (around $200 if you go all out for two of you).

I had a cosmo and it got my approval for the amount of alcohol! We got a nice booth and had a very sexy and romantic with chocolate fondue and lots of delish treats that went with it. There was an acoustic guitar player there that gave the place a nice rustic and romantic feeling. The staff was very attentive and helpful.

2009-05-18,3.0,"The booths are backed by shelves of wine bottles and highly uncomfortable, and the place sounds and smells of sizzling hot oil, so I would hardly call it the most romantic restaurant in Chicago...just a decent one-time experience.  They also keep it really cold inside...which makes sense later when you have to cook your food in a vat of hot oil in front of you...but I was freezing at first. Not romantic. I suppose the most romantic aspect of it all was the interactive dining.  Having to cook our own food kept us pretty busy throughout the meal, and we found it to be a rather fun experience. The meals come with eight dipping sauces, and it was a good time mixing and matching and figuring out what tasted best with what. I suppose I might recommend it to those with poorer social skills (and deep wallets) who need a place to take a date. The food by itself, however, only tasted okay.  It's just stuff cooked in oil - LOTS of oil. For the cheese fondue, I found the bread a bit stale, and some of the fruit in a questionable state.

2009-05-11,5.0,"I've been wanting to go to this place for a long time and finally got the chance to last Thursday night.  I've had fondue before, but never been to a fondue-specific restaurant, and my friends had talked this place up so much that I was pretty excited to check this place out. We made a reservation for 8PM and when we got there were given the option to hang out at the bar and wait a little bit longer for a booth because they were more private.  No biggie so we grabbed two seats and two glasses of wine at the bar.  The atmosphere was much like everyone has said; dimly lit, soft overhead music, 6-inch voices of people, etc.  The decor was straight out of the 70s (well, what do I know since I was born in the 80s, but that was it seemed like!) and I took particular notice in the bartop which was covered in little tile hearts.  Ooo la la.  The wait was a little longer than we expected so we ended up ordering a bottle of the Geja's house cabernet at the bar and took it to our table. The hostess came up to the bar and took us to a booth.  It wasn't entirely private, but much better than being right on top of another table.  It was difficult to read the menu because of the poor lighting, so I'd suggest taking a look online beforehand to plan ahead.  Depending on how hungry you are, you can order things a la carte; if you are hungry, order one of the premier dinners because it comes with the cheese fondue, a salad, your meats/veggies, and the chocolate dessert.  We were hungry so we went with two premier dinners:  the beef tenderloin and chicken, and the beef tenderloin and lobster. The cheese fondue was awesome.  The waiter brought out a post of hot cheese and a decent-sized basket of breads, grapes, apples, and other various foods.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE apples dipped in cheese, and I'm a HUGE fan of pumpernickel bread, so I went to town.  It was quite filling, but I couldn't stop eating, and hoped that I would have plenty of room for everything else that was coming. Once we were done with the cheese fondue the meats and veggies came out.  WIth that came a huge pile of assorted veggies and 8 dipping sauces (props to the spicy garlic sauce - YUM).  To be honest, I was a little surprised at first because it didn't appear to be a lot of meat.  There were the 4 rows of meat and about 4 chunks per row.  Since I'm a big eater I expected a bit more, but once I started digging in I was pretty fulfilled.  Since the meats and veggies take a few minutes to cook in the oil, it was a slower eating process, so by the time we were done I was full.  They said to cook the meats for 3 minutes or so, but to get mine closer to well-done I let them sit a little longer.  I also made a new discovery - broccoli is super tasty when you cook it in oil! A few minutes after finishing the meats the chocolate fondue and goodies came out.  I am not a big fan of chocolate, but seeing it right in front of me with a plate full of pound cake and assorted fruits was too tempting not to indulge.  After we made it through about 2/3 of the plate we hit the wall and were DONE.   With two premier dinners, a bottle of house wine, 2 additional glasses, and a $40 gift certificate, our bill still came to about $85... so assume about $75 per person with tip if you dine like we did.  The experience was top-notch, the food was great, and the staff was friendly.  It an every-so-often type of restaurant, and I wouldn't suggest bringing large or loud groups of friends to this place. The only oddity of the night was the couple to the far right of us in a booth on the opposing wall.  I couldn't help but notice the awkward lack of conversation and staring over at our table.  I'm not sure if it was a bad first date, a breakup, or what, but that being said, Geja's really isn't a place to stage either one of those two events.  Hopefully everything worked out between the two of them!",0.9984,0.82,0.145,0.035,0.5722880734785495
2009-05-08,4.0,"We went to Geja's Café (pronounced Gay-Ha's) for my girlfriend's 25th birthday. I had a $25  restaurant.com  gift certificate (actually I bought four thinking that the bill would be around $100 until I realized you can only use one at a time, d'oh!).  First things first - they have valet for a reason. It is impossible to park over there even on a Wednesday night. We eventually did find some meters along Clark St which wasn't too far away. Beware the LAZ parking meter rates though (25 cents for 15 min until 9pm). The building that Geja's is in is shared by another restaurant. Just remember to go down the set of stairs rather than up them. When we entered, the place seemed a bit cramp. The Maitre'D recommended we hang out at the bar which we did. The bar was small but had assorted crackers and a bowl of this delectable cheese spread which was delicious. We were seated shortly after at a booth. This gave us time to check out the atmosphere. Although the place seems cramp, it seems that it was part of the master plan. Everything about the place invokes intimacy. From the Spanish and Moorish décor, subtle lighting (maybe too subtle, more on that later) and Flamenco guitar (live on some nights) playing in the background, romantically challenged guys could breathe a sigh of relief. It was definitely more romantic than the only other fondue place I've been to (Melting Pot). Our waiter was Ramiro - who every waiter should model themselves after. I would say his charm and inviting demeanor made half of the evening.  I ordered Prince Geja's Combination - beef tenderloin, lobster tail, jumbo shrimp, sea scallops and chicken breast. My girlfriend ordered the International - the same as Prince Geja's but without the lobster and scallops. The first course of our meal was a cheese fondue dip that was a mixture of cheese and white wine - it basically tasted like a much better beer cheese. On the side was a plate of grapes, apples and white and dark bread. Who knew fruit and cheese went together!? Everything went together perfectly. I give this part of our meal 5 stars. The second course of the meal was our main dishes. Ramiro came out with a large platter - our meat on one side, vegetables (onion, mushrooms, red/yellow/green peppers, potatoes, and broccoli) on the other and 8 different dipping sauces in the middle (horseradish, sweet chili sauce, teriyaki, barbeque, can't remember the rest). Our waiter was very thorough about how long to cook everything - very important if you are wondering why your chicken is way too chewy. Then the fun began. It was little tricky getting the food on the prongs (especially the meat), but we managed and dropped them into the pot full of soybean oil. Tip: To keep the more tender meat from slipping off the prong while cooking, add a vegetable to hold it in place. Of course, as fondue beginners, we ended up with pieces of food at the bottom of the pot and had to fish them out. Now as far as the food went, I must say that I did not enjoy this part as much. I think it required way too much coordination - 1) Wait, how long have I had it in for? 2) Is it cooked? (I couldn't tell because it was so dark in there)  3) Did I touch the raw meat with the fork I'm about to eat from? See what I mean? Anyway, the sauces were such a life saver as they helped mask my fears of contracting mad cow disease. I would say in this case, this portion of the meal was 4 stars - just because I was eating in the dark so to speak. The last course was a chocolate fondue dip which was awesome. Ramiro brought it out and set down a platter of strawberries, pineapple, pound cake cut up in cubes, marshmallows and cantaloupe. Then, the highlight of the evening for me - he lights the pot of chocolate on fire and tells us to roast our marshmallows like we were camping. Too cool. I think I was having way too much fun when my marshmallow lit on fire and I sorta freaked. Anyway, at that point our bellies were way past capacity and we ended up getting the dessert to go. I give this portion of dinner 5 stars. The value of dinner was pretty good - great ambience, a lot of food, presentation and welcoming staff. We ended spending a total of ~$105 w/ drinks and without gift certificate deducted. I only gave it 4 stars because of parking, the price and the restaurant being too dimly lit for my liking.

The place was dark and you do come out smelling like the restaurant.  As for the romantic atmosphere???  Um, I don't really know.  I went with my fiance and it didn't feel romantic.  Maybe because we didn't have a booth but were instead seated at a small table right by the entry way (crappy area)....I don't know.  Or maybe it was because we were dressed like bums.

Had GREAT FUN cooking and enjoying our three courses! Cheese, Surf and Turf, Chocolate and Fruit. Lots of variety. It was entertaining and very romantic.  After dessert we were enjoying the glass of champagne that came with the package and gazing into each other's eyes, when we were asked to move to the bar to make room for the next seating. Not nice.  I guess we lingered too long, but it takes a while to do all that cooking and seatings are scheduled only two hours apart.  Because we both smelled like fried fish when we left, it wasn't really a problem. Although for this reason I wouldn't want to hook up with others after going to Gejas. We had our clothes cleaned the next week. No problem, the enjoyment still outweighed the drawbacks.  I was VERY satisfied until I found out later, how much it had cost:  Two people with the fixed Valentine's menu and a very modest bottle of wine: $290. Holy moly, we could have gone almost anywhere for that! It didn't seem to justify the Olive Garden caliber service (we had to pour our own wine), or the old pizza parlor atmosphere (cramped fuddy-duddy interior with greasy dust covered wine bottles), or the unspectacular dipping items and presentations.

My bf and I had reservations, but waited at the bar for about an hour on a Sunday night for a booth. Ok, fine, I can deal with that as long as the food is good. However, I was hugely disappointed by the food. The Melting Pot is seriously 100 times better than this place. First off, I was not impressed by the taste of the cheese fondue, it was just, meh. On to the meat course, I was told that we could only cook in oil, which I really did not want, but went with it anyway. Right after the oil was put down on the table some of it shot up and hit me in the face. The waitress was still standing there when this happened. I said to her, ""um, ouch, this oil just hit me in the face"". She is like ""Oh yeah, it happens"". Okay, wtf. I have been to the Melting Pot a handful of times and have had fondue at other places, I have never had this problem before. The oil continued to shoot out and burn us at random points during the meal. Also, your meat does not stay on the forks they provide, it falls off into the pot quite often.

The Chicago Tribune named Gejas Cafe the Best Fondue Place in Chicago and since I walk past it every single day I decided to gather up a crew and give it a whirl. To people who have never gone the fondue route before, be prepared to drop some dough. If you add in alcohol, tax and gratuity to your meal, it comes to around $80/per person. It's really an experience like no other and I think everyone should try fondue dining at least once and Gejas is the perfect place. Lets just start with the ambiance of Gejas. It's almost like you are walking into a romantic cave when you open the doors. It's dimly lit with candles on the walls and tables, live music was playing softly in the background from a man with his Flamenco guitar. They have these beautiful curtained booths which are perfect for dates and their little bar is tucked in the back. I wouldn't mind coming in for a glass of wine sometime. It's such a charming little place with a lot of character. I had a group of 5 people and we were sat at a larger table in the middle. We were approached right away by a very friendly waiter who took our drink orders and shorty after that, the wine began to flow.  The menu has several options that come out in different courses. Every premier dinner that you order comes with a cheese-fondue appetizer, salad, an assortment of fresh vegetables, eight of their classic dipping sauces, and a flaming chocolate dessert fondue (yum!) I chose The Connoisseur which is aged beef tenderloin, jumbo Gulf shrimp, and succulent lobster tail and it will run you $48.95 per person. The meat was wonderful and the lobster just melts in your mouth. They have so many different dipping sauces and it's so fun just to try out all the different combos.

The food was good but I've definitely had better fondue. Their famous cheese fondue tasted a lot like alfredo sauce, and some of the fruit dippers weren't that fresh. The entree portion was good, but I prefer fondue made in a broth other than the pure oil they use. Also, the chocolate fondue tasted a lot more like the alcohol they put on top than the chocolate.

2009-01-01,4.0,"LOVED IT!  Celebrated an anniversary here with the bf.  It was a great fun experience - something new and different.   After reading other reviews - I requested a booth for the romantic atmosphere...the booth was great - but it is SUPER DARK!  It was hard to see well!  But guess that adds to the mystery and romanticism.  We went on a Wednesday at 6:30PM - when we got there, only a few other patrons were there - by the time we left it was fairly busy!  And they also had a guy playing the guitar.  Adds to the cute atmosphere. They have valet service, but when we got there there seemed to be a lot of street parking available on Lincoln on that cold, snowy day. Our server was great - it was our first time there so he explained everything really well from the food available to the cautionary message of not using the same fondue fork to eat off of after putting it in the hot oil.  :) We ordered the premier dinners.  It's great because you can each pick your own premier dinner!  We just happened to get the same beef and scallops dinner with vegetables.   Our dinner started off with a small basic salad and the cheese fondue with bread, grapes, and apples.   Then the main entree came with the dipping sauces that everyone talks about - try them all to find your faves!  It's nice b/c our server told us which goes best with what food.  Our dinners came with about 3 big scallops and 3 pieces of beef - seems small but with all the other food I think it's a good portion b/c it's not like you will be taking that home as leftovers!  For the veggies - they served onion, green peppers, potatoes, mushrooms, and broccoli.  They were all great except for the broccoli!!  When you cook the broccoli, the florets hold all the oil - so when you eat it you sure do get a whole mouthful of oil!  But everything else is awesome - I loved the crispy potatoes.  The onions are good but only if they are cut wide enough - otherwise when you spear them they break and it's hard to do anything with them. For dinner they give you instructions of how long to cook everything...like 3 minutes for the potatoes, 1 min for all the other veggies and scallops, 2 mins for the beef tenderloin...  They're smart to tell you to add a veggie under the scallop so the scallop doesn't fall off your fork, and not to eat off the same fork that you just cooked your food with lest you want to burn your mouth!  The tips are all helpful. The chocolate fondue dessert ends with marshmallows (the fondue has alcohol in it that they flame so you can roast the marshmallows first!), strawberries, honeydew/cantaloupe, pound cake, pineapples, bananas and apples.  What an awesome way to end the meal! Oh and their coffee comes with a cup of whipped cream!  Delish. I'm sold.  It was a great place to go to - especially for a special occasion.  It's also good for small groups of friends because it's fun.  Children under a certain age are not allowed.

2008-09-13,4.0,"I've been to the Melting Pot but always wanted to try Geja's (pronounced Gay-Ha's) because people would say that Geja's was the better, the older, and the more Chicago of the two.  It's like listening to people compare Gino's and Giordano's, or any two steakhouses.  So last week I was in Chicago on a business trip and even though I have a list of Chicago restaurants that I love, I needed something new to Yelp.  In the end, I ate really well at Geja's, I had a great time, service was terrific, and there was nothing I could complain about.  But next time I'll do it differently. I don't want to see another long skinny fondue fork for a while.  I loved the cheese fondue.  I could have dipped cardboard in there and I'd be thinking ""this is a five star experience"".  Cooking the beef, chicken, and shrimp was fun.  We'll see if as a result of Geja's, my upcoming physical is followed by a lecture about cholesterol, but the food was all tasty.  And the chocolate fondue at the end was a really nice dessert.  But when I add it all up, it was fondue overkill.  There were just too many little forks for one meal.  Really, if you want to do this right, go early and get the cheese fondue.  Then wait a few hours and go someplace else where they do the cooking for you.  The oil wasn't all that smelly, but it was a pain.  Stuff falls off the forks and if you forgot to bring a flashlight, you're trying to fish the food out of boiling oil in the dark.  More about the ambiance later, but don't feel weird bringing a flashlight.  The waiter has one because he's smart, so follow his lead.  And then there are the dipping sauces.  Eight sauces that are each supposed to be for specific foods, but they're unlabeled and you'll forget which one is for what within minutes.  One or two make sense, but mostly you'll end up just dipping everything everywhere. Okay, this place has atmosphere.  The entire restaurant is dark, when you're in a booth it feels like you're in your own little world, there's a guy gently playing classical guitar somewhere nearby, and the waiter always reminds you that he's coming back soon.  The thing about this business trip I was on is that, well, I wasn't traveling with my wife.  I was traveling with a woman from work.  Not only was I looking for new restaurants to review, I was scouting out new places to bring my wife on our next trip to Chicago.  Hmmm, was that a good idea?  Bringing a woman from the office to Geja's?  If you're planning to come here with someone, realize that Geja's really plays on the romantic theme and your spouse or SO is a really good choice when you're wondering who to come here with.  Venture in here with a colleague, and you'll want to be sure that they know you really well and they're not going to misunderstand.  If the cute intern that you barely know says that she's never heard of fondue, she's probably not secretly hoping to show up here with a stranger from the office.  Get this wrong and an HR person will be ask you to drop by their office to talk about sexual harassment.  In my case this wasn't a big deal.  I brought someone who I've worked with for 9 years and we can pretty much read each other minds.  I could have just as easily shown up with a male coworker and I have no idea how that would have gone.  The restaurant seemed to be full of straight couples except for a guy who brought two girls.  I saw people of all ages, and it seemed like most were in their late 20's or 30's.  I'm not saying that the place wouldn't be friendly to gay couples or to two people of the same sex that were checking out good restaurants to bring dates, I just didn't see any. So will I bring my wife here?  If she wants to check it out, sure.  But we're usually in Streeterville and the Melting Pot is closer, just as cozy, and a bit more modern inside.  I don't think Geja's interior would look like much if they turned on the house lights and I don't know how they keep it clean.  There's a lot of surfaces for dust to settle and all of those little oil droplets flying around... ugh, it can't be easy.  I don't remember food falling off the forks at the Melting Pot, and it was somehow easier to look into the fondue pot.  Geja's has a much simpler menu, because they want you to order everything and just decide which meat, chicken, and fish you want.   So the reasons to pick Geja's are because they've been in Chicago since 1965 and they're not part of a big chain.  Reasons to visit the competition instead are because their interior is more modern and because at the end of the meal, I don't remember thinking that I didn't want to see another fondue fork.  Both restaurants had tasty food, and I think the biggest factor is location.  Pick the one that's closer and have a great time.  The cheese fondue was five-star but the overall experience was between 3.5 and four.",0.9982,0.823,0.132,0.045,0.480311619597334

2008-08-23,4.0,"To celebrate my 200th review on Yelp, I am writing about the wonderful experience I had at Geja's (pronounced ""GAY-HAS""). Every month, my husband and I plan a romantic Date Night that is just a bit more special than the usual ""whaddya-wanna-do-tonight-let's-go-see-a-movie-and-get-takeout"". This month, I planned a night at Geja's and both of us agree it was one of the best dates in a long time! Expect a 2-3 hour experience when you plan to go here. Make reservations if you can. They are only available Sunday - Thursday, and for limited times on Friday and Saturday nights. Expect romanticism, a darker dining room with a lot of romantic ambiance. Tables for two are everywhere, and be sure to ask for a booth for a more romantic (read: Private) experience. Service is impeccable. The server did an excellent job accommodating my gluten intolerance. I thanked him and the host as I was leaving and we left a good tip.  We had the premier dinner - it is a LOT of food. We choose the dinner with beef tenderloin and chicken breast. And for $38 per person, we had a lot of food. I was stuffed halfway through! Cheese fondue (swiss, gruyere) with red grapes, red/green apples Mixed greens salad with dijon vinaigrette Beef tenderloin and chicken breast and an assortment of vegetables (onion, pepper, mushroom, potato, broccoli) which you cook at the table in oil served with 8 different types of dipping sauces (I could only have the herbed butter sauce & dill sauce because the others had gluten) Chocolate fondue (flambe with orange liquer) with an assortment of fruit (melon, apples, banana, strawberry, pineapple, cherry) and marshmallows Coffee with whipped cream Although my husband and I did not drink, they have an amazing and extensive wine list. Definitely take your time to peruse the list. Highly recommended. I cannot wait to go back in the winter for a cozy, warm, romantic meal.",0.9938,0.826,0.161,0.013,0.547015392015392
2008-08-18,5.0,"I'm going to tell you about some of the harsh realities of the dining experience at Geja's, so brace yourself, you might not be prepared for what you're about to hear in regards to this superior dining establishment.  Geja's is a dark, cozy love dungeon where people take turns feeding each other. Live mandolin music trickles into your ears from an unknown corner, and you can scoop giant lumps of cheese onto crackers at the bar while you sip wine and wait for your table. All around you hot tubs of scalding oil bubble and pop while people laugh, giggle, and satiate themselves into oblivion. It's the ultimate in romantic, which means this: if you are not going with a date, you better be prepared to fall in love with somebody regardless because that kind of thing happens here. If you are going on a date, you better have a ring ready, or at least a really good love speech. Dig deep.  You will be dipping super tasty vegetables and choice cuts of meat into hot oil, all night long. You might end up smelling like oil. You might even get permanent oil spatters on your new $150 designer shirt you just bought from Nordstrom, but will realize that the sacrifice for that one moment -- that look on her face -- was worth it 100%, so next time be careful.  For desert you roast marshmallows in flaming chocolate. Flaming chocolate is chocolate that has a thin layer of brandy that has been SET AFLAME. Flaming chocolate deserves a 6-star rating on Yelp which I don't see as an option, so I'm contacting the developers. Geja's is great, if only because there is no other place like it in Chicago. It's definitely a special event and/or hot date kind of place, and I urge you to try it at least once.",0.9883,0.823,0.15,0.027,0.6065578565578565

Yes, the guitar playing was lovely, and the grotto atmosphere was romantic and less Disney-fied than I'd feared.  The middle-priced wines by the glass were tasty.  My husband and I went for just the cheese and chocolate fondue specials, which (with included house salad) proved to be plenty of food.  I can't imagine having gone for the ""premiere fondue dinners"" that included shellfish, beef, or chicken to be cooked in oil.  And honestly, none of it smelled so great--do you really want to boil shrimp and beef tenderloin in the same pot? So, while the service was excellent and everything that we ordered was tasty, I still couldn't shake the feeling that this place was a little gimicky and might have been more at home in the burbs or a smaller town.  There are too many restaurants in Chicago with really excellent food for me to make another trip to Geja's.",0.9901,0.775,0.173,0.051,0.6432194616977225
2008-07-27,5.0,"Obviously this is a date place. Don't even think about coming here unless you're with someone special (and looking to impress). That said, however, some of their tables place you very far apart from your companion, which blunts the romantic edge a bit. I have no idea how some people can possibly get a cheese, meat/vegetable, and chocolate fondue in the same sitting. What I usually get is the cheese/chocolate fondue for two (which comes with a salad to start), and we split a cheese plate. This is a f*ckton of food, and I am always stuffed. The salad is not memorable. The cheese fondue, on the other hand, is delicious. Purists may note that the ingredient mix is a bit different from what they enjoyed in Neuchatel (Geja's has a garlicky-peppery baseline to the gruyere and kirsch waltz) though I highly enjoy it. You dip in it various types of bread and fruit. The pumpernickel works especially well here. Be sure to make up some sort of game to play when one of you loses your morsel in the cheese ocean. The cheese plate is a good bargain (I don't remember what it costs but it is a very large portion of cheese), though some of their cheeses are better than others. Ask your server for the best stuff (ie the raw milk stuff). The chocolate fondue, is of course, delicious. Dark and cocoa-ey, not too sweet, and with the perfect dipping ingredients. Yes, you get to roast your own marshmallows, but you also get bananas, strawberries, angel cake, pineapple, and much more. So a dinner for two like the above, with a bottle of wine, could be done for under $100 w/ tax and tip (I think the food, tax, and tip alone would be around 70, so enjoy the wine!) A good deal considering the quality and quantity of food you get, plus that atmosphere.",0.9929,0.81,0.164,0.026,0.5993437118437119
2008-07-21,3.0,"Not sure if it's a ""guy"" thing or if it's just me......I suck at fondue. The food is always falling off the screwer, I burn myself and the others around me, and I always wait too long for the food to cook....I'm a mess. Oh and somebody had to find me because I got lost in the dark maze that is this restaurant.  Every single woman I know and it's seems like most yelp women love Geja's!! I understand it's ""romantic"" even though you are packed in like sardines and then it's like a dark dungeon maze. A trip to the bathroom is like an adventure complete with obstacles, people refusing to move, hitting other tables and trying to dodge the staff who will run you down. Don't get me wrong the booths are comfortable and can seat 6 people it's just that the guy on the end will get his foot stepped on all night. I guess you can call it mood lighting even though when you leave you feel like some sort of mole person and your eyes burn in the day light or even in moon light.  The staff is quick and attentive I guess, they weren't terrible or anything but I've just have had better service from places where the staff actually have more to do. They do know their fondue and my waitress was very knowledgeable with the wine list. The food was fresh...I think. I mean you really can't see it, so how would you really know except by taste and it's dripping with oil so there goes that. I also don't understand how people can say the food is great here, cause really YOUR the one cooking it so the only way it's good is if YOU cook it right. I will say that they give you a lot to eat and the dipping sauces are fantastic. Great wine selection and the mix drinks are strong. The only thing that really upsets me with the place, that gives you raw chicken to cook yourself but don't let you see if it is cooked all the way. So is it romantic to eat in a dungeon where you have to cook the food yourself, getting burned multiple times from the hot oil (well maybe that kind of thing does it for you), you end up talking to somebody else other then your date because it's so dark that you sat at the wrong table, and you pay an arm & a leg. Then you leave smelling so bad (from the oil) that even a cab driver says ""hey what stinks in hear"".

The wait was FOREVER.  They try to ease the pain with some amazing cheese and crackers though which helped. The place in general is very crowed and cramped.

We both ordered from the premier menu, almost all of which runs about $50/person. But we were tourists after all, we wanted to splurge. We order from the deluxe menus that also include cheese fondue appetizers. We then ordered the deluxe seafood and a chicken with more seafood. One note, I would not order the deluxe vegetable dinner as our dinners came with plenty of vegetables. They also offer 9 different sauces to dip all your gooey goodness into. YUMMY IN OUR TUMMIES!!!  After all this, we somehow still ordered the flaming chocolate fondue dessert. It had fruit, pound cake, and marshmallows. I don't know that we really had the room, but we made room.  OMG!!!! But I think we were also there for 3 hours. Definitely not cheap at $50 per person for dinner and another almost $25 for dessrt (for two) But when back in Chicago I would make time to come back.

I've been dozens of times over the last ten years and have nothing but good things to say about the place. The service has always been impeccable, the food is consistently delicious and the music - oh, the music. A few things to think about if you're going. First, make a reservation. For real. The last time I called they didn't accept Friday/Saturday reservations after a certain time (7?) so just avoid it on weekends if you can. When was the last time you went on a Thursday night date? Second, request a booth. This will solve any overcrowding problems. Yes, the regular tables are close together but I have never had any problem ignoring (or making friends with!) my neighbors. Once I learned that you could request a booth I have never had a problem. They can't always honor it, of course, and you may have to wait a few extra minutes but the space and privacy are worth it. Third, you will smell like oil when you leave. There's simply no getting around it. To be honest, though, I've never understood this problem. Your date smells like oil too - what's the issue? Embrace it. It's not a foul smell, and it reminds me of Geja's the next day when I do laundry. Mmm. Finally, enjoy the music. The guitarists have always been happy to chat with us on their breaks, and they are phenomenally talented. They're interesting folks, and finding out about their backgrounds and training always makes listening to them more enjoyable. One last point: you will leave STUFFED.

They should hand out polyester lounge suits at the door - at least then you wouldn't stink when you left. If you equate romance with being crammed side by side with other couples into a dimly lit space with smoking oil stink working its way into every fiber of your clothing and hair, while being serenaded by wandering minstrels 2 feet from the side of your head, then by all means, have at it. I'm a huge cheese fondue fan, and have made classic fondue many times, and the cheese fondue here isn't anything to write home about, but on the other hand its cheese fondue, which is great way to start any meal, which is what keeps this place from one star. The various meats for cooking in the oil is just too oily, and its so dark its impossible to tell if something is cooked well or not... which might add to the intestinal discomfort you inevitably feel afterwards. Also, drinking what amounts to a glass of castor oil has a tendency to lube up the ol' intestinal tract. The chocolate fondue at the end is so-so, but since my girlfriend is a chocolatier I've been spoiled by good stuff, so low quality melted chocolate doesn't do much for me. I'm really suprised by how many people seem to like this place, noone I know does. I would never recommend this for a romantic dinner, and for the money there are literally hundreds of places in Chicago that would be better destinations.

Cheese fondue - nice flavor in the cheese but all the items they provided for dipping were stale.  Stale bread, limp grapes.  Yucky.   Meat - Beef that tasted like beef.  Chicken that tastes like chicken.  All cooked in a vat of oil that splashes onto your women friends.  Sure, they give you dipping sauces and they taste okay but are you really paying to cook your own food in a vat of oil and to flavor it using a variety of McDonald's dipping sauces?  (I think the Honey Mustard from McDonalds is better than most of them...) Veggies - Take the same vat of oil that you cooked your meat in and add raw veggies.  What do you get?  Fried veggies with no flavor.  Oh right, you can dip them in Teriyaki sauce to make them taste better.  Ewww.   Chocolate fondue - How can anyone screw this up?  It wasn't bad but man, they really need to do a better job of providing fresher dipping ingredients.  The pound cake tasted like...cardboard?   Now, to sum it all up: my friends and I had a good time.  We drank champagne, which was pretty good and it was fun playing with the foods but c'mon, do they REALLY think that people fall for the novelty and just forget that they actually are paying about $50 to $80 a person for this stuff?   I think this meal is worth maybe $15, tops.  At the prices they are charging, you are better off going to Chinatown and finding a hot pot place and whispering sweet somethings in your girlfriend's ear.  With the money saved, you can even buy her flowers to achieve the same romantic effect.  Skip this place and thank me later.",0.9982,0.735,0.217,0.048,0.5230561660561661

With the Melting Pot as it's only major fondue competition in the city, Geja's offers a considerably more unique experience for special occasions. For those unsavvy about fondue dining- Geja's starts each meal with a small salad, and then has three different types of fondue- cheese (with apples and bread to dip) to start, oil for the main course, and chocolate for dessert. Though Melting Pot offers a few more variables (particularly with the dessert options) you still cant go wrong with Geja's, it's less expensive without a drop in quality, and an infinitely better dining experience. Factor in more time (3 or more hours) for a meal that involves the patron in the cooking process. (Apparently, some people don't like the idea of having to cook your own food.) I think it's fun- part of the experience. Geja's has top-notch service, an extensive wine list, and usually a live guitarist playing (non-obtrusively) in the background. Look for nightly specials and local coupons that help bring down the cost, which for what you're getting, is still fairly reasonable. Make it a point to try Geja's if you haven't already.

2007-10-21,2.0,"So, my husband and I got a little card in the mail saying ""Get $25 off your dinner."" We decided to give it a shot. We are somewhat experienced fondue-rs, so we had high expectations. They really weren't met...and here's why.  First of all,  the environment is very nice, except that we got stuck in the corner of a little side room with no light and no space to breathe. They actually had to give us a small flashlight to read our menus. Some may call that romantic, I just call that creepy. Give me the big, secluded booths of the Melting Pot any day... Second, the menu is very limited. You can have one type of cheese and one only! It was good, but barely enough (we're used to the Melting Pot where you get an ENTIRE pot of cheese, not just an inch at the bottom). Their selection of meats was alright, nothing special, but not as broad as Melting Pot. AND, for the price you pay, you really don't get enough. I selected the tenderloin (for 39 dollars) and got a total of 7 pieces of beef. Sorry, but that's not worth 39. Get this, my husband got 2 shrimp, 2.5 pieces of tenderloin and a piece (not even a full tail) of lobster for 45. Granted, you get some veggies and many dipping sauces along with it, but really...45? One of our biggest problems was the lack of choice in cooking methods. Soybean oil was the only option...only after asking for coq au vin (our preferred method) did they mention vegetable broth (with no wine or herbs...blah). After eating the meat, we found that we DEFINITELY needed all the sauces we could get because there was absolutely no flavor from cooking in oil. The chocolate fondue was as good as any that I've had...no complaints there. Oh...and you get your choice of a coffee drink - nice touch. One last complaint...they didn't cook at your table - total bummer. I enjoy the interaction with the waiter/waitress. So...overall...it boils down to (sorry...fries down to. remember, no coq au vin...just oil): over priced, not enough menu options, and only oil (or boring broth).

2007-10-14,4.0,"We headed back to Geja's for our annual trip for a night of sticking food into pots of warm liquids on Saturday (10/13/2007).  This time we brought my parents who, are more adventurous and will try anything once. So this wasn't a romantic night out but you know what, this place still rocks for a good time out of eating and talking with friends, family or loved ones. We had a reservation because we needed a table this time.  With MK in the 8th month of pregnancy, the booths don't cut it at any restaurant, let alone Geja's where they CAN be tight.  Additionally, my Dad doesn't do well with booths given his arthritis and his back.  Geja's were more than accommodating, given the few tables that they do have. We all went with the Premium Dinner service which includes your ""appetizer"" of the Gruyere cheese fondue, in which you dip an assortment of apples, bread, and grapes.  It's a good starter because if you've never ""fondue'd"" before it's easy to understand and you basically can practice what to do for the main course.  This was a good thing for my parents who admitted that they hadn't done fondue since ""the early 70's at best"". For the main course, we actually all ordered the same thing, the Beef Tenderloin with Chicken.  The more than ample platter of beef, chicken, potatoes, onions, peppers, mushrooms, and broccoli was delivered.  It can be quite intimidating but the waitstaff does a FANTASTIC job of explaining how long to cook things and how it all works.  My parents were really nervous about under cooking the chicken and so I think they didn't enjoy the chicken as much because they let it sit in the hot oil MUCH longer than they should have. But this is where my 4 stars is justified.  This time, the pieces of meat and chicken were extremely large.  I don't remember the pieces being that large.  They were so large that I actually would cut my chicken and beef before putting it into the oil.  To prove this point to myself prior to digging in, I took a hunk of chicken and put it in the oil for the 3 minutes the waiter said and it was still raw in the middle.  So I'm not sure if management of Geja's reads these, but you might want to rethink the size of at least the chicken hunks on the platters. This ONE thing aside, the meal was fantastic, my parents REALLY enjoyed it and we had a wonderful meal together.  Please don't get me wrong, my food was excellent and as usual I left here extremely full. The final course is the unbelievably fantastic Belgian chocolate fondue with orange liqueur.  You get to dip pineapple, melon, marsh mellows, pound cake and apple into this amazing dark chocolate.  There's ALWAYS room for this at the end of the night and it basically puts you over the edge on the full tummy scale. Everyone is describing the atmosphere accurately and on a weekend, they get crowded very very fast.  Reservations are mandatory here and if you're not there when they open (which is pretty early around 4:45), there probably is a wait.  This was my fifth trip here and MK and I try to make an annual pilgrimage. I believe they are in their 42nd year of service and that, my friends, is a true test of time in a city where restaurants come and go as quickly as Bears' QB's. ;-)",0.9979,0.814,0.153,0.033,0.5688087948535705

The food was decent, but certainly not ""amazing.""  First the salad was two slices of cucumber with lettuce and some generic vinaigrette.  Then the cheese course, which was very good.  Then the main course: the presentation was terrible, and cooking it was worse.  They provide you with soy oil, and just soy oil, to cook your food.  Our waitress confirmed that it was JUST cooking oil.  They don't try to spice it up with some pepper, maybe throw a sprig of ANYTHING in there?!    I love fondue, but this was bland as bland can be. We were really looking forward to desert at this point, it HAD to be better.  The coffee was fine, but instead of cream or half-and-half on the side we were given a cup of whipped topping.  You might think this is cute, and if it were real whipped cream I would agree.  They gave us WHIPPED TOPPING from a spray can.  Let me reiterate:  I spent $100 on food for two and they gave me whipped topping from a can. Finally desert comes out: the fruit was terrible and the chocolate was Hershey's syrup with orange liquor.  At this point we just wanted to get out, but it took our waitress 10 minutes to come with the check and another 5 to return to take my credit card.

So the food is great, but don't be fooled; fondue isn't just cheese and chocolate.  You'll be cooking your own meal in a pot of hot oil.  The wait staff will let you know exactly how, but how well the food turns out is very much your responsibility.  Don't worry if you, like I, didn't do so well;  they have a large assortment of sauces to cover up your little foibles: Dill, barbecue, yellow curry, honey mustard, teriyaki, butter, horseradish, and one that I can't remember.  I won't say that the sauces are special, because I don't know anything about sauces, but I was just thankful that they were there.

(Perhaps being the Wisconsinite that I am?) But alas, there is much more to this fine style of cuisine!   We decided to do the three-course option and started out with cubes of bread and fruit dipped in a cheesy-red wine fondue.  Then I ordered chicken, steak, and veggies while the bf went for the deluxe steak, shrimp, chicken, and lobster option....all served with a smorgasbord of sauces. We're talking LOTS of sauce, from horseradish to mustards to curry to barbecue and on and on.   And one thing that you should know about me is that I love, love, LOVE me some sauce - so my taste buds were hopped up.  The only downfall was that you had to cook your own meats and veggies in a vat of oil, which was a tad unhealthy, not to mention difficult, even though the waitress was kind enough to share the different cooking times.  Plus, I did rather get a kick out of watching Alex N. try to fish out food that slid off his skewers from spattering oil -ha!   We washed all this down with white sangria and prepared for the delicious finale of chocolate fondue.  The waitress perfectly toasted a marshmallow for us before we enjoyed the other fruits and cakes.  The dessert course also came with fresh coffee and real whipped cream. Delish!  And the final perk, being our first time there, we received a $25 gift certificate to use on a special occasion in the future.  Gotta love it.  Enjoy this night with a hot date. ;)",0.9946,0.807,0.176,0.017,0.603882453882454

We really enjoyed it a lot- the cheese fondue appetizer, the salad, and the chocolate dessert were outstanding. They brought her a slice of pound cake drowned in chocolate which was absolutely sinful. It sounds clicheed, but I'd never used that word before to describe food, so I really meant it- this was incredible. Their red sangria was perhaps the best I've ever had. The server was very friendly, helpful but not obtrusive- well done. However, I was a little disappointed with the main course. We got the Connoisseur, which is shrimp, beef tenderloin, and lobster. The quality of the items was tip top, but they were wholly lacking in seasoning, leaving the sauces to do all the work of flavoring the meat. Though the sauces were good (especially the dill, teriyaki, cocktail, yellow curry, and, of course the butter!), I think something to enhance the meat would have gone a long way in improving the overall taste.  My only other complaint was that the tables are really close together. We sat in a really nice section of the restaurant, with a wall of wine bottles separating us from the booth next to us- nice ambience. On the other side, the next table was literally seven inches away, making conversation a bit awkward, especially when the second group that sat next to us was a bit loud.

(BTW, if I missed something its because its already talked about enough in the other reviews... soo keep reading!)",0.9953,0.695,0.294,0.011,0.6436349206349206
2006-04-17,2.0,"I'm not sure why people think of fondue as romantic: it's greasy, it's messy, and you have to do all the work.  That being said, there is some element to bonding with someone over a bubbling pot of oil.  Just think of the conversation starters: how long should I cook the meat so it doesn't make me sick?  Is that type of cheese from France or Wisconsin?  The place is full of dark corners, lit by candlelight, which is inviting for couples who want privacy.  And the food is excellent, although you are almost guaranteed to leave reeking of cooking oil.  And I'm always a fan of dunking things in a pot of melted chocolate.  If you want the experience without the long waits, go EARLY and on a weeknight.  It may kill those visions of a romantic Saturday night out, but so does an hour wait and a loud, crowded restaurant.",0.5043,0.843,0.105,0.052,0.5830026455026455
2006-03-09,4.0,Very romantic and intimate this place shows your date that you care.  Must make reservations early any day of the week.  I especially enjoy the half-price bottles of wine of Monday and the food is divine.  I can't wait to go back soon.,0.9229,0.736,0.264,0.0,0.51

2006-02-23,5.0,"Geja's is probably one of my favorite restaurants in the city!  The food is amazing and the dessert is even better!  I'm not a huge fan of the cheese, but I always seem to find a way to still eat it!  Cooking your own food makes for a great experience, and the variety of sauces to dip it in tops it off!  The chocolate fondue is the best, so save room for dessert!  Or just eat it anyways, like I usually do!  It's a small romantic place which makes it great for a date night.  However, my girlfriends and I love to treat ourselves if it's a special occasion or during the summer during their anniversary special.  That's the biggest secret I could share with you - go then b/c the prices are so cheap and the wine is priced from back when they first opened!  Makes the meal that much better when the price is right!!",0.9967,0.654,0.33,0.015,0.6058897243107769
2006-02-04,5.0,"If you are like me and prefer to go out to eat instead of cook- fondue is a great option!  For the ultimate fondue dining experience- head to Geja's on Armitage.  This fondue restaurant was voted as Chicago's most romantic restaurant and for good reason.  The dimly lit atmosphere is the perfect place for a date with a special someone.  The cheese fondue is delicious and we enjoyed the beef and shrimp entree.  The food is amazing and it's a great time to cook it yourself.  The chocolate fondue is out of this world and is too good to resist.  To top off the unbelievable food, and the great service, there is a live guitar player to create the perfect romantic dining experience!",0.9945,0.653,0.347,0.0,0.7169172932330826
2005-12-08,4.0,"A fantastic choice for couples and those looking for a romantic dinner date with an atmosphere for getting close to someone. The food is excellent; unfortunately the proportions are somewhat small. If you're an impatient eater, Gehas it's not for you since it also takes awhile for the meats to cook properly, so eating is slow on the positive side this leaves lots of time for getting to know someone more intimately. You'll also lose your food in the fondue pot repeatedly, although half the fun is digging around the fondue pot with your date looking for lost pieces of meat or veggies. If you are a fan of fondue or want to try something different and romantic, this is the place. My favorite was the cheese fondue, followed by the meat sauces. Overall, my date and I had a wonderful time. On a side note, at the height of the evening it gets little crowded so try to get a corner seat away from everyone.  Pros: Good Food, Romantic, Valet Cons: Pricy, Small Portions, Crowed, Poor Parking Cost: $$$ of 5 Overall Rating: 4 of 5 Recommendation: Recommended",0.9738,0.763,0.177,0.06,0.5380050505050505

2005-09-27,3.0,"Chocolate and cheese has the highest proportion of the love chemical, which is probably why this is considered such a date hot spot. With the below street level, dark cavernous, semi-private rooms, it feels like an old European joint. The food isn't all that exotic though. And for $100+, why should we have to cook our own food? Screw that. Rather than boil stuff in oil, how about they offer some variety to people who want something healthy -- maybe bring out food cooked on high-temp stirfry on light olive oil, then they can dip in cheese to their protesting hearts' content.",0.7579,0.864,0.097,0.038,0.5750000000000001
2005-08-11,5.0,"This is a cozy and very intimate fondue place.  The food is excellent and the wine selection is great.  Geja's is way too romantic for an ordinary dinner out, so save it for a special occasion with that special someone.  Just remember to NOT make this a first date otherwise you could end up wrapped up in the romance of this place and lose judgment.  Consider yourself warned.",0.9629,0.663,0.28,0.057,0.6395767195767195

2005-05-25,4.0,"This a fun place to go, though you go there much more for the fun and atmosphere (and wine) than for the food.  Menu consists of different combinations of beef, chicken and shellfish.  Dinner is cheese fondue, entree (meat or fish) fondue with plenty of veggies, and then chocolate fondue.  It's lots of fun.  I get a kick just thinking about it .. big pot of boiling oil, crowd of friends poking forks at each other, the occasional floater ... ahhh.  The scene is nice too.  Very dark, heavy wood everywhere.  Warm and inviting on cold Chicago nights.  And oh yeah ... the wine list is phenomenal!",0.9661,0.81,0.19,0.0,0.4913333333333333
