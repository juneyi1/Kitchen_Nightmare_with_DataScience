Yes, I got a nice Long Island at half price, but I also had some of the best bean soup *ever* in a big bowl, plus a nice salad and turkey burger. A good turkey burger at a pizzeria? Who knew? Good friendly service by the bar keeper helps, too. I won't make the mistake of overlooking Pizzeria Ora again.",0.9909,0.633,0.367,0.0,0.45151515151515154

No, we were the only people there, so it was not because it was busy. Mediocre service. Had a Hawaiian Pizza, it was okay. Yes, I actually like Hawaiian Pizza, but nothing stood out. Kinda light on cheese and toppings. If a review had mentioned that I would gladly have paid for extra.  Just mefiocre, nothing to make me think of going back.

It was the fullest it was ever during my time here and it was only one waitress for the whole place. Her name is Kim and I watched as she bounced from table to table to telephone to keypad and back again. What astonished me is she kept her smile and she remained so pleasant and never complained. This is what customer service is. The mark of a successful business is it being busy. But when it happens, it's the employees that have to deal with the hard part of that. But even in that, there are still the same expectations. Kim showed that. It was obvious that she, like any human would be, was exhausted but you wouldn't know unless you watched the moments she stopped to take a breath before getting back into the cycle.

They said in 45-60 minutes and came in 40 minutes - very not bad, even though it was ordered around 9:30 pm. Shrimp cocktail was good, included a couple of lemon wedges and cocktail sauce - shrimp was tasty, not fishy or stale, seemed a bit small sized but included 7 or so pieces. Pizza was decent but not remarkable - crust was sorta a hybrid of Lou's deep dish crust and Giordano's stuffed crust, except not quite as tasty though the crispiness was good. Toppings included sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, onion, and green pepper - had a nice tomato sauce on top with a decent amount of cheese. It won't be in my top 5 Chicago pizzas, but a decent pizza nonetheless. Since Gino's, Lou's, Giordano's, and Uno's are all close by, I'll go for those places instead. Ora's is not bad, but a decent choice if the other aforementioned places are closed for the night - Ora's will stay up a bit later, closing at midnight.

2014-11-06,4.0,"In all honesty I didn't expect too much from this place but I ended up being pleasantly surprised! It's attached to the Best Western that we stayed at (though separately run I think) and I guess the most that I was hoping for was that it wouldn't suck and be a decent option if I was too lazy to venture far from the hotel one night. Now I can't promise that I would come back if I didn't stay at the same place again (after all, there are SOOOO many other pizzerias I didn't get a chance to try) but certainly will if I'm at the Best Western again and be happy to do so (and if I'm lazy). So on our first night in the city my wife was pretty beat and ready for bed after a lot earlier than I was, even though I'm the one who drove the whole eight plus hours! Maybe I was too excited to sleep. So I've got to find something to do for an hour or so before I'm even considering bedtime and I'm at Pizzeria Ora before you know it! My first dinner wasn't enough and I'm in a hurry to try local pizza, so why not? It was a bit late for deep dish and I didn't want to wait 45 minutes (not to mention this was my second dinner) so I go with a small thin crust, tomatoes, onions and garlic...stinky, I know! It was about 10:30 on a Sunday night so the place wasn't exactly humming (it was me and one other guy at the bar when I walked in) and you never know what you're going to get at that hour, but it was actually one of the better pies I've had in quite a while. Good cheese, good dough, good sauce, good toppings...good pizza! After that and a couple of pints I was finally ready for a good night's sleep and only felt a little guilty for ditching my wife in search of pizza and beer! So I'm only rating the place based on ordering my meal / snack from the bar during the most off-peak time possible (the bartender was so bored that he was drinking, too!) but that's enough to give it a solid recommendation.

For its location, it's actually the only place that I have found that sells deep dish pizza by the slice. It's ideal if you need something quick for cheap. Unfortunately, all of the major Chicago chains like Giordano's, Gino's East, Uno's, and Loumalnati's make you order a whole pizza for deep dish and it can take a while.

Our deep dish pizza order was going to take over a half hour to prepare and we were exhausted, hungry and thirsty. Ora's tall margaritas did the trick as did a comfort food ""fried mac and cheese"" appetizer with a wonderful marinara sauce--more on that below. When the pizza arrived it was everything we could hope for--piping hot and crusty with a rich tomatoey sauce, spicy pepperoni and the gooiest of cheese toppings. Our waiter ""Freud"" kept close watch over us and answered our questions about their terrific tomato sauces--the marinara we had with our appetizer, the deep dish sauce and a third sauce reserved for their thin crust pizza. One pizzeria, three sauces--we knew that this was serious pizza business. We were so enamored with the rich and thick marinara sauce, redolent with aroma, peppers, onions and seasonings that we asked if we might be able to get the recipe. Freud didn't know about that--but did indicate that if we returned in the morning the owner Walid would be present and he was certain that he would ""take care of us."" Walid couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful--or happier to hear how much we liked his sauces.  He truly took pride in them and in the hours spent in their making. While he was reluctant to part with their recipe (understandable trade secrets) he told us that he would prepare some for us to take home the next morning. That he did--offering up two large containers, about a half gallon each, one for us and our travelling companion. And he charged us virtualy nothing for them--surely less than the ingredients alone would have cost. So we had a wonderful souvenir of our time in Chicago and at Pizzeria Ora to take back home with us to Columbus, Ohio--where we have since enjoyed the wonderful marinara sauce with two different fresh pasta dinners as well as using it as an upscale ""salsa"".

Our room was not ready so we decided to go to the restaurant to wait and have a small bite and some beverages. It was about 2 pm and no one was in there. It took about 10 minutes from being seated to the guy taking our drink order. He was the only worker it appeared. I saw him several other times during our stay and I think he is the owner or manager. Anyway not the least bit friendly. We told him we just wanted something small before our rooms were ready, so he was aware we were guests of the hotel.   My husband and I were the only ones eating and we  ordered appetizers, the nachos and some mac n cheese bites. My kids had lemonade, I had a beer as did my hubby and one other adult. The other two kids and one adult had nothing. I know this is a pizza place, so don't expect awesomeness from the rest of the menu, right? But we knew we didn't want to eat or wait for a pizza. The food we got was small in portion. The nachos were not edible. About 15 stale nacho chips covered in way, way too much cheese. They even put their 'pico' under the cheese so it was warm and gross. No beans as the menu stated there would be. I didn't eat them, for fear all that cheese grease would ruin my first night in Chicago via my guts. My husband ate them just to hurry us out of there to get our rooms. We ate the mac n cheese bites, all 5 of them between me and my kids. Our food took about 20 minutes to get to us. The guy did not check on us but to take the plates and get the bill. Did not ask how the food was.  Ok, now this is where the one star really shines. Our bill had an 18% gratuity added automatically. Even though only 2 appetizers were ordered. Even though 3 of the people were not eating and merely seated with us that were eating. Even though he knew we were staying at the hotel and may come back to eat there. On top of it he was not friendly at all and I know he knew he served us some crappy food. Our friend was hungry one night and got a deep dish from there out of convenience. I did try a piece and it was not that great. We ate at Gino's as well and it was much more flavorful. Ora's sauce was bland, crust had no flavor or desired texture. None of us finished a slice and we tossed it in the trash. I travel frequently. In the past 5 years I have been to Vegas several times, Toronto, Orlando, Tampa, L.A., and live in Metro Detroit. I can't say I have ever been that insulted as a guest in a restaurant. I tip well enough, always 15%, even if the service is poor-and very often much more than that.

It's very stark and generic, when it could play up its place in Chicago pizza history. It needs a little pizza pizzaz (ha!). Go for their deep dish.  It's really great. Their thin crust, not so much.  Subscript: Pizza is a major preference-driven thing in Chicago. I prefer Lou Malnatis. You may prefer this place, who knows.",0.9141,0.848,0.152,0.0,0.49

The mozzarella cheese was average. We ordered jalapeno poppers which seemed to be the same as the ones you'd buy at Costco. My friend asked for a side of ranch dressing and we were charged for it. I think that was lame. Our server was very nice and prompt.  I had a  restaurant.com  certificate so I'd go back if I had another one. Actually I do so I guess I am.

2009-10-05,4.0,"My wife suggested this place for dinner as we were both craving pizza that Friday night. I met her after work and we headed out. I started thinking about where this place was. River North + Friday night = a ridiculously long wait. I started getting crabby and very irritated just thinking about it.  We walked in the place and I realized that all of my crabbiness and irritation were all for naught. The place was only about 25% full on a Friday! The decor here is really no frills, nothing flashy but and not even the most comfortable. Our server actually seemed genuinely pleased to wait on us (probably because thee was hardly anyone else in the joint) She did an excellent job of taking good care of us.  We ordered a fried appetizers, which was pretty much fried appetizers. What more can you really say about them? They adequately did the trick and satisfied us until our highly anticipated Hawaiian pizza came out. My expectations for the pizza were not the greatest, I have never heard of this place and it was only 25% full on a Friday, so that kind of biased my initial opinion. My mind was completely changed when the pizza arrived. It was very good. the crust was outstanding and it had a good amount of toppings. I feel that this place put out as good of a pie as anyplace else in the city. That is saying quite a bit with all of the options available in Chicago!",0.9898,0.776,0.166,0.058,0.5925806451612904

For the two times I tried the pizza the sauce was consistent, having a sweet flavor.  It was good pizza at the times.  Both times I'd been looking for street parking and out of exhaustion, desperation for food and placement nearby, is what caused my visits.  LOL, plus I can't pass up pizza, if it's there I'm willing to try it.  This is Chicago! Consistent with good service and taste, although the overall pizza is just standard.  Good at the time, but not something I'd go out of my way for.  Due to the location, it's never so busy that you would have to wait for a table, at least that's how it was when I went.  Tables were readily available.",0.937,0.853,0.109,0.038,0.41842105263157897

Work had been consuming my life and it was time to say EFF OFF and go to lunch with my ladies. We decided to stop in for the lunch special.

I went with the cream of mushroom. Comforting. All I wanted with it was a bread bowl and my bed. The pizza was nothing out of the ordinary but satisfying.
