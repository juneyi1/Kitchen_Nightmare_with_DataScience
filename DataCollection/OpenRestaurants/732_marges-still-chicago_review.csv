This down-to-earth neighborhood spot serves its salmon with far superior service to its trendy neighborhood counterparts. Come to Marge's on Mondays and Tuesdays to grab a half-priced bottle of wine. But don't just come to get popped: Order the aforementioned Atlantic Salmon, which takes creative license on comfort food. It's equal parts rich and tangy, with a buttery honey-mustard cream sauce and balsamic drizzle over shredded veggies and pasta.  Emma is a delightful departure from the lull of a Monday-- she's full of music suggestions, life advice and has smiles to spare. If you don't catch her, Meg is wonderful and accommodating. Highly recommend Marge's to both visitors and to the people who call Chicago home.

I'd echo what another reviewer said about the vibe when you walk in: this place was not 'super welcoming'. The place serves up standard bar fare, with a fairly good-sized burger section. Nothing you haven't seen before. Here's the kicker though. The waitress comes around as we're finishing up our food and asks if we need anything. 'Just the check when you get a chance'. Ten minutes go by and I'm wondering where she is. I notice her in the back of the bar, in view, putting together silverware, ostensibly for the next day as the bar's crowd had started to thin out.

FINAL VERDICT: It's a great neighborhood spot that is rarely, if ever full.  They've got great food specials on the daily and of course their weekly specials like  1/2 price bottled wines on Tuesday (just check their website).  Maybe they deserve 4 stars (instead of 5) because of the service, but quite honestly, I'd be devastated if they went out of business.  Where would my parents and I spend Tuesdays nights?",0.9985,0.721,0.226,0.052,0.6173354423354421

This place came recommended because it wasn't going to be crowded, and it definitely was not - on either night.  On both nights we were greeted with shock that a group of people were coming in. On both nights they were out of the special, which was weird because there were maybe 7 people in there.  On 11/16 they didn't have any cash to make change. There excuse was that they were a ""neighborhood bar"", well my thought is aren't most bars in Chicago neighborhood bars? Having worked in a bar I found that very confusing, but wasn't surprised with Marge's.  The nice thing about them not having change was they were giving out free drinks for anyone that tried to buy with cash (which didn't last long as they started asking for credit cards and eventually caught up with a little bit of a bank.)

The fried calamari was basic you-can-get-it-anywhere stuff, and was served with a crappy bland watery marinara. The side salad was plain, murdered with too much red-onion, and overall too large for the plate it was heaped upon. The burger was average, a bit too much char taste for my liking. The fries were soggy. My friend's crab cakes were ok. Probably the best of the fare we ordered.  Still, they were not good enough to warrant any praise. Fortunately, we liked our server very much, and this made our meals more bearable.  It was nice to see Stiegl on tap. It's a great beer and sometimes difficult to find. The Stiegl gets five stars!

I must admit that we spend far too much time here as it's a local establishment and I wasn't around for when it really was Marge's Still and so I don't appreciate a lot of the old-timers who pine for those days.

The bar and the tables tend to be populated by different crowd and there is clearly a Cheers-style atmosphere here with many people being regulars. That said, those that are not receive the same service and friendliness. We actually go here to eat and it should be noted that the food is a step-up from normal bar food. Not in an attempt at pretentiousness but merely in that the quality is higher than what you would expect - you get an actual burger, for example, if you order one - with a decent amount of meat and the toppings you requested (again, better quality and selection than at a typical place but not over the top) - and I love that the sides include sweet potato fries - which, by the way, are excellent.

When my friend arrived he ordered a beer.  $6 for a pint.  That's just too much for a corner bar in this neighborhood.  We ordered dinner and sat at the bar - all of the tables were full.  We each ordered a cheeseburger of some sort.  My friend's was a standard cheddar burger, and mine had avocado and peppers on it.  It was fine, but nothing special.  The bun didn't survive for more than a couple of minutes so I ended up going the knife and fork route.  The fries that came with it were good.  Actually, they were probably better than the burger.  My burger was $10, and my friend's was $9.  A bit pricey for the quality.  I also ordered a side salad - $6 - and that was very mediocre.  The dressing was nearly tasteless, and the salad was overwhelmed with mushrooms.  A terrible deal for $6.

But then my meal arrived, and this is where Marge's fell short for me.  The lettuce/tomato/onion pile was meager and not terribly fresh.  I had the Wisconsin St burger, which comes with muenster, honey mustard and pickles.  Delicious-sounding, no?  There were three weak pickles, a dab of the mustard, and a thin slice of cheese.  All I could taste was the super bready grocery store bun and the burger, which although ordered medium well was burnt on the outside and bright pink in the middle.  Maybe they forgot to defrost it first?  I took a bite of another friend's pulled pork - it was tasty, but the sauce to pork ratio was high, and the meat to bread ratio was sadly quite low.  A redeeming point was the cole slaw, which was spiked with golden raisins and pineapple.",0.9628,0.815,0.129,0.056,0.48297619047619056
2008-01-13,3.0,"This is a great place to go on a cold night when you just want to sit with your friends and chat. The bar itself is very attractive, although kind of narrow at one end. And if you're sitting near the back door (as I was) it's kind of chilly because the staff keeps exiting through there. The people who go there are in their upper twenties/early thirties and a few upwards of that so definitely not a young twenties bar. The fries, which were the only food I tried, were kind of burnt but the menu had a good range of food.",0.8988,0.866,0.134,0.0,0.6166666666666667
2007-12-08,4.0,"I find Marge's to be a great neighborhood bar.  Seems like a casual place to hang out.  They have a great menu and the burgers are tasty.  Also, in the bathroom, there is this hand-dryer that is seriously out of this world.  It's like one of those dryers at the car wash for your hands. **After visiting Twin Anchors, which is across the street and down a block, I noticed that a lot of drunk and satisfied rib eaters head over to Marge's to hang out after dinner.  It's definitely a better bar scene.",0.9468,0.712,0.222,0.066,0.7277777777777777
2007-10-29,3.0,"I had been wanting to try this neighborhood place for a while now and on a recent Saturday night- I got my wish as I met up with a friend for dinner. Marge's Still is located in a space that has been occupied by a neighborhood bar for over 100 years.  They have done a nice job with renovating the space including tin ceilings and a long wrap around bar.  I also liked the tiled floors and the large windows in front so you can watch the people walk by. Since I was running a little early, I had the opportunity to check out the place as I sipped my drink and waited for my friend to arrive.  For a neighborhood joint- I actually thought that the bartender was a little aloof as it took her awhile to acknowledge my presence at the bar. The good news?  Once I was served, she knew how to pour a good drink! Tables are available on a ""first come, first served"" basis- so if you see a table and want to eat- grab it!  Since it wasn't too busy, we had a couple of drinks at the bar and then settled into a table in the back. The entire restaurant smells like a rib place.  At  first I thought it was wafting in from Twin Anchors up the street but it turns out it is from the smoker for their ribs and chicken!!  It only seemed natural to order some type of BBQ with all that anticipatory scenting going on!  While I wanted ribs- my better judgment took over (too messy!) so I went with the pulled pork sandwich which ended up being less pulled pork and more chunks of rib meat slathered in sauce on a bakery bun.  It was actually pretty darn good, and the coleslaw served as a side was tangy and tasty.  The only down side was that the fries were limp and undercooked.  Too bad for my friend that his food was not as good as his came overcooked and a bit tasteless.  Maybe he should have tried the PB&J instead! As for the service?  While the server was not particularly attentive- the food did come up quickly.  The only hiccup was that I had to ask the manager at one point to send our waiter over to the table so that we could get a drink refill. All in all- I liked the feel and ambiance of this place.   I think it just needs some more time to work some of the bugs out.  Judging by the amount of families in here- it's well on it's way of keeping its place as a neighborhood gathering spot.",0.9899,0.88,0.109,0.011,0.5493629908103591
2007-07-24,4.0,"I was able to experience Marge's Still on their grand opening night (7/23) ... and I was very happy upon leaving. I agree with the other reviewer about there being to many burger options on the menu, they need a little more variety in the sandwich department - the only non-burger choices are a turkey burger, buffalo chicken sandwich and grilled cheese. I would like to see more chicken for sure. But I opted to split the ribs and wedge salad with my sister and we were very happy with the food - not to mention we got complimentary Gorgonzola chips and mascarpone/chocolate dipped strawberries that were both delicious! I loved the atmosphere - the floor is almost too pretty to walk on! And the beveled windows give it a very old-world, classy feel. And you have to use the hand-dryer in the bathroom - it's an attraction in itself! The only minuses were the menu options (which I mentioned), the drinks were pretty expensive for the neighborhood bar scene, and the wait staff seemed a little wet behind the ears - but I'm sure that will get better as time goes on.",0.982,0.822,0.178,0.0,0.739917695473251
2007-07-23,3.0,"We went this last Friday (the first Friday night that it was open) and it was still a soft opening.  They had there full menu available.  Being that I live in the neighborhood, it goes without saying that I will be in attendance a lot at Marge's Still.  I never had the fortune of attending the REAL Marge's, but I am super excited about it coming back.  The owner's (who I hear also own Pepper Canister and Garrett Ripley's) did a really nice job on the interior.  The light fixtures, the marble on the floor and the beautiful woodwork make this place feel special.  In typical Chicago fashion there are plenty of TVs to take in your favorite Chicago team.  Although, I will say that they only had one TV up and running and it was all the way in the back and they didn't even have the White Sox/ Red Sox game on.  A little disappointing.  Another thing that was disappointing to us was the service.  They only had 1 waitress for the entire place!  I understand that this is a ""soft"" opening, but shouldn't they be a little more prepared than this.  We watched many people come in and sit at a table only to leave after waiting several minutes without any service.   Also, I think the burgers and the kids menu are priced extremely too high.  $10 for a burger seems pricey especially when you order it medium and you get it well done.  Like I said, I understand that it is a 'soft' opening.....I also thought they had too many burgers on the menu.  Kind of Weird and could have had some pasta dishes.  Although, we didn't order the ribs we saw some come out and they looked really good and priced @ $19.00 that seems like a really good deal, especially if they are good!   Not once, did we see the owner or manager walking around making sure that everyone was satisfied.  I personally think in a neighborhood place such as this you would want to befriend your clientele as much as possible.  A lot of influential people live in this neighborhood and it would behoove them to show some neighborhood appreciation.   I know there is room for improvement here and i am totally willing to give them more than one shot and not judge this place on its first week.  Hopefully, I will be coming back and giving it 5 stars!",0.997,0.799,0.176,0.025,0.5786421356421356
2007-07-16,4.0,"Tonight was the ""soft opening"" of Marges Still. Once known as a dive bar with shuffleboard and dogs allowed, it has taken a new turn in reviving an old neighborhood haunt.  The inside is simple, with a little touch of its rustic goodness - a long wooden bar, a large antique mirror, simple wooden tables and high tops, as for artwork: illustrations of Chicago from long ago and taking a step into the modern age - two large flat screen tvs. Because tonight was only their soft opening it was appetizers only. We tried the calamari, which was served with giardenara - it was good, but a tad over battered and over cooked. Then we tried the chicken and filet sliders - oh my tastyness! They were great - and the sauteed onions sauteed to a perfection - tender, tasty with a hint of that oniony sweetness we all long for. Our final taster was the homemade chips drizzled with Gorgonzola. Being a Gorgonzola lovah, I appreciated these chips to the highest caliber. They were so flavorful - and for the most part crispy. I wish there was a tiny sprinkle of sea salt on the top - you know, just for effect. However with my nosy ears, I overheard the owner saying that had spent a pretty penny on purchasing a smoker and rotisserie just for their ribs and chicken. If that isn't dedication to flavor, I'm not sure what is. Their menu consists of a wide variety of novelty Chicago named burgers - including a Kobe beef version. I personally have my eye on the Lincoln Park - decorated with jalapenos and avocado... But if you aren't a beef lover, their salad selection looked really tasty - including a pear and apple salad with dried figs. Overall the experience was good, I understand it was the first night and kinks will be ironed out soon - I offer a gentle golf clap and a high five.  Because I live literally two doors down I know fo' sho' that I will be back - in fact I can't wait to try more items from the menu. *****EDIT 8.20.07******* I have finally been able to have dinner here, at least once. The burgers are outstanding - they aren't a little patty on a little bun - these things are big, meaty, juicy burgers - served on a homemade bun, piled with a variety of accouterments. They are big enough you could split them. And they have ""slider"" specials -  we had the pleasure of tasting a meatball slider. We tried it, we loved it, just like a mini meatball sub. Because the owners used to own an Italian restaurant there are always Italian specials, but we have yet to try any specials. My cousin tried the ribs and I got to have a little sample - they were tender and smoky with a great BBQ sauce. Overall any time I have eaten here I have been a happy, yet very full, lady!",0.9971,0.836,0.147,0.017,0.4815658893078248
