2017-04-15,2.0,"Call me crazy, but here it goes: I compare the deliberation and experience of eating Indian food to shopping for clothing at the store.  Now, just follow what I'm saying: when you go shopping and find a dress that looks amazing, you try it on, but find out that it's a little too tight...despite this imposition, you try with all your might to make it fit and at a certain point you either have to convince yourself it looks good or tell yourself to get over and find something better.  Indian food is the same exact way!  You look for delicious looking curry, find some, buy it and then when eating it...well, it's not exactly what you expected.  You try with all your might again to say, ""it's good, it's interesting"", but at the end of the day, it's not that good and it's not that interesting...so it's time to move on to different Indian restaurants. This was what happened to me when ordering Paprika.  From the pictures, it looked great and when bringing it home to my fiance, we tried so hard to find pleasure in eating it, but it was lost and nowhere to be found.  I had ordered the mango chicken curry (and I agree -if I'd gotten something else that is more typical I may have liked it more) with rice and garlic naan.  The mango chicken curry was a disappointment, and though the sauce was kind of good (in a tangy untraditional way), there was barely any curry...it was just lumps and lumps of chicken.  I can totally appreciate the generosity of adding more meat when paying a higher price for a dish, but I actually wanted more curry to soak all that rice up with!  Speaking of which, the basmati rice was actually our favorite part of the meal.  That's a red flag in of itself - the rice should never be my favorite part of an Indian meal.  As for the garlic naan - it was chewy in all the wrong places, the garlic was barely noticeable and it simply didn't taste too much like pita.   The food was not terrible by any means - the chicken was not fatty, nor was the curry itself bad.  It was all just kind of ""blah""...but I also feel spoiled because I've recently found some amazing Indian restaurants that place the bar very, very high.  The service here, though friendly, was also somewhat of a downfall.  There is no one waiting to serve you, and because  there are no windows from the kitchen the staff don't see you when you walk in.  Yes, there is a door chime that rings when you walk in, but despite this it still took about 10 minutes for someone to wander from the kitchen to bring out the food I had ordered.  For all the food I did order (as mentioned above), it was about $20, but I wouldn't say the food was worth the price.

We ordered an eggplant dish, a chickpea dish and a chicken dish with a garlic naan on the side.  Everything seemed to have a sour, almost vinegar taste to it.  I thought that was odd and something I've never really experienced in all my years of eating Indian food.  I didn't like it at all , my ladyfriend thought the vegetarian dishes were good. Nothing was inedible but the naan was close.  It seemed undercooked and sort of soggy, again something I've never experienced.  It had a industrial looking pattern on the bottom that almost made me think they were mass produced.  I guess the tandoori oven could have had a textured side but the only time I've ever seen a similar pattern it was on premade frozen naan.  It sort of tasted premade too.  I don't want to make any accusations but that was my feel.

I was torn between palak alu pannir (spinach, potatoes, and cheese) and the malai kofta, which the menu described as cheese with vegetable balls in a traditional sauce. I asked the waiter, who without asking anything about my preferences, immediately recommended the more expensive kofta. He said it was popular. When it arrived, it looked like 8 unappetizing meatballs in a chunky brown gravy. There was no cheese in sight. I managed to choke down two before I gave up. My gf got the chicken vindaloo, her ""go to"" at any Indian restaurant, and it was also terrible. Spicy yet somehow without flavor. This is definitely the worst meal we've had in a long time.

That being said, the food is FANTASTIC and well worth the wait.  We ordered the butter chicken, the lamb vindaloo, and the cheese/garlic/onion naan (I can't remember the name).  It took about an hour for our food to come out, so they gave us an order of meat samosas on the house, which was a nice touch.  The butter chicken was easily the BEST Indian dish I have ever had.  The basmati rice pilaf was also cooked to perfection.  The lamb vindaloo was also tasty, but I was so blown away by the butter chicken it kind of got overshadowed.     They are cooking all food to order here, so it's literally like you are visiting their home and they are cooking for you.

We can't have dairy and they can make any dish without dairy.  (3)  I never get an upset stomach after eating here like I usually do with other indian restaurants.  I don't know what it is about other indian restaurants, but Paprika's preparations just seem so much more fresh and light than other places.  They seem to use much less oil, which could be why.  But that doesn't mean that there is less taste --- the shrimp saag has a great spinach sauce which actually has spinach you can see in it.  The shrimp is really high quality, and so is the lamb we got in the rogan josh.  Very tender and flavorful.  We have gotten delivery, carry out, and have dined-in.   If you dine-in, don't expect anything fancy.  This place is a very plain store in a strip mall.  But what it lacks in decor it makes up in taste!  Also, it is a few dollars more per entree than most places, but it is totally worth it.  You can tell they use high quality meat and take extra care in preparing each entree to your liking.  We hope this place stays in business for a long time!!!!!",0.9903,0.843,0.157,0.0,0.49707307060755324

On the way to the washroom we both saw the small crammed kitchen quarters which looked pretty unsanitary and messy. This is not an Indian food kitchen, see for yourself. My friend said that all the counters looked like they were not cleaned at all. So the server brings us papard chips and plates. After I picked up my first chip and brought it to my plate a hair fell onto my plate. Definitely not mine or my friends or the servers. At that point we almost decided to leave but unfortunately we stayed hoping that it was just a bad impression. We alerted the server and he brought us new chips and me a new plate.  We ordered the paprika tandoori chicken, palak paneer, rice pilaf, veggie samosas, and lassi. The tandoori chicken was cut in cubes had some kind of curry sauce on it and was very very bland. Not even close to real tandoori chicken. The palak paneer was okay but the spinach was not liquified like it is traditionally. The veggie samosa were small and somewhat flavorless compared to any other samosas. They were out of mango lassi so we got the regular lassi which came very warm. We had to request a cup of ice to get it cool like it's supposed to be. We also had to stir it very well to get rid of the curds at the bottom which should have been done already. I brought a friend here for her to experience indian food for the first time and it was a pretty bad experience. I should have checked all the negative reviews for the place before going but I was starving. Also everything on the menu is extremely overpriced for the measly portions they give.

For those who order the coconut curry chicken, note that the curry does not have a coconut milk base. It's curry gravy with shaved coconut in the recipe. As to the chana aloo, I should have ordered poori or bhatura instead of the naan. The naan also had a baked texture as opposed to that of naan baked tandoori style. The kheer was ""the"" best. I actually ordered some to go. I think it may be that it wasn't excessively sweet, so I got to taste the ingredients without my gums throbbing. The service is fantastic.

Before we left the owner came out and gave us some of his homemade rice pudding which was sweet!  Being fans of Indian food and living near Devon ave. we have had our share of experiences with this cuisine and now we have a new favorite spot.

2014-02-06,2.0,"I had been here once around the time they first opened and again just recently.   The first visit was about 3 or 4 stars but my recent experience was ZERO stars so I am averaging it out to 2 stars. I can understand that when the four of us were there (November 2013) it was coming off of their Check Please exposure so maybe they were very busy.  But not all of the seats were filled and we had a reservation so business alone can't explain horrible service.  Shorty after we sat down the waiter (an American) placed 2 appetizers in the center of the table and started explaining them.  We let him know that he was at the wrong table and that we hadn't even gotten menus yet.  Later when it was time to order we ordered the same two appetizers he had almost given us earlier plus our main courses.   After a short while the waiter brought by one appetizer but not other, the ""Chutney Appetizer"" -- some sauces and wafer/chip-like bread for dipping.  As time went on we reminded him about the other appetizer then reminded him again after the unbelievable delay of 30 minutes.  The latter time he responded with ""I'll bring it with your dinner"".  We reminded him that it was an appetizer and, get this, he says ""it's sauce, I'll bring it with your dinner"" and disappeared.  The four of us took a reality check and assured ourselves that it was the appetizer that he almost gave us before we ordered. After a lot more time went by it really hit us.  We were hungry, the BYO wine we brought was long gone, the people at the next table (who were seated after us) were having desert and we realized that we had been there well over an hour and maybe even a full hour since we placed our order.  So we made the extra effort to get our waiter's attention again.  At the point where apologies are due, if not an offer of free desert, our waiter started overtly ignoring us -- two regular quiet couples.  When we got up to leave (and put down some cash for the one appetizer) he stopped and looked at us but didn't say a word.

I asked her if she could please shut that door as it is freezing ... she did not , she told me the cooks wanted it open, as they felt it was too smoky for them in the kitchen ... so I made my way back to my table and noticed that everyone else there was freezing ... luckily after the two other tables complained the door was shut ...  but by then the waitress was really upset and service really went downhill.   I got my drink (a coke) after 20 mins. of sitting there, there was no ice ... sorry we are out ... no straws (sorry we are out) ....

I was really hoping this place would wow me since my favorite Indian restaurant Standard Indian Restaurant closed last year. Well sad to say but I was extremely disappointed. Food: We had the meat samosa's, which were bland and the dough was too thick. Our main dishes were lamb and a chicken and they both were bland for Indian food. The chutney sauce we had unfortunately had s RUBBER BAND inside of it and the male server tried to make light of it as if we didn't know the difference between a rubber band and food when we clearly had the rubber band on the plate. Service: the female server was ok, but I can see how different the male server addressed us as we entered compared to everyone else and we had reservations.  Ambience: the place is small and dark and the ventilation is horrible. They really need to build a door to separate the kitchen from the dinning area. They should also consider a weather protective door before the main entrance. It gets too cold quickly.  Needless to say that I paid way more here than at my other place and it was not worth the money I paid, I rather find a small ma pa place on Devon than coming here ever again. They need to contact Nick from Standard Indian Restaurant so he can show them what real Indian food taste like and what makes a great service and ambiance.

After waiting another 20 minutes (over an hour after I placed the order), I called back again.  I spoke to a man.  He said that the delivery guy just left 10 minutes ago and he should be there any minute.  He claimed he had no idea who I spoke with during my earlier call and he had no way of contacting the delivery person and giving me a more accurate estimate.  (Really? Ever heard of cell phones?)  At an hour and 40 minutes, I called the restaurant again and asked to speak to a manager.  I was told the manager was too busy to talk to me but I could leave a number and he would call me back.  I insisted and was put on hold for about 20 minutes.  I never did get to speak to a manager but when someone finally came back on the line, I told them to cancel the order and wished them a Happy New Year. Obviously this business does not care about customers.  Seriously.  If your delivery time is 2 hours, just be honest.  I wouldn't have canceled the order if they had just been up front.  But lying to your customers is not a good idea.  Not to mention a manager who would rather put a customer on hold for 20 minutes, hoping they'll just give up and hang up, than getting on the line to accept responsibility for the restaurant's mistake.   Bottom line, if you don't want to starve, go elsewhere.  We did.  Ordered sushi from Fin.  It was delicious.   We'll be going to Tiffin on Devon (less than half hour delivery time on average) for delicious Indian food and, more importantly, honesty.",0.945,0.799,0.115,0.086,0.48030303030303034

This was the Sunday after the show aired, and the restaurant just seemed out of sorts. First off, they were out of lamb. For a restaurant that has three menu sections (Chicken, Lamb, and Veg), they were basically out of 1/3 of their menu. I very much enjoyed the meat samosas, but the potato ones were not as good as I've had elsewhere. The butter chicken had a brown sauce...still decently flavored, but lacking that wonderful cream that I enjoy. The naan (like others have said) was more like a mix between pita and pizza crust. Overall, the food was just okay. And the service was abysmal...there was one waitress with just us in the restaurant, but she seemed very frazzled. The restaurant also did not turn the heat on, so it was about 50 degrees inside. Even after mentioning it was chilly, nothing was done to improve the temperature. I so wanted to love this place, but I would go to any number of other Indian restaurants before eating here again. I fully admit that they were probably overwhelmed by the crowd from Check Please...so maybe they will improve as a result of the notoriety.",0.9825,0.799,0.161,0.04,0.6152777777777778

We waited 2 hours and 15 minutes from our order time to receive our entrees, which was painful.  The service was abysmal; our waiter was aloof, absent, and unapologetic for the many errors during our meal.  All of the above would perhaps have been forgivable had the food been excellent. The food was mediocre at best. I am Indian and found each dish to be utterly bland and absolutely not worth the 2 hour wait. Either this place was completely unprepared for the crowd after Check Please and remains horribly understaffed, or the positive reviews represent an entirely different place.

Seriously, we spoke at length with two waiters and the owner's son. As a vegetarian, I cannot vouch for their renowned Butter Chicken or other meat dishes, but I can tell you that Malai Kofta -- vegetable and cheese balls in a thick, slightly sweet curry sauce -- were heavenly, and the Mixed Vegetable Curry, which was much lighter, tasted as fresh as if the vegetables had been cut to order, as confirmed by our waiter. The garlic Naan and fragrant basmati rice were both as good as any I have tasted, and the Kheer, a rice pudding with raisins and pistachios, was fresh and light and delicately spiced.

Like other reviews have noted though, the service is so, so, so painfully slow that it's really not worth it in the end.  The reason why the service is slow? They have a tiny kitchen and they are being absolutely destroyed by GrubHub. While we sat there (for over an hour waiting for out entree) we saw no less than 7 GrubHub delivery drivers come, stand in line, and have their orders fulfilled before the 3 tables that were seated in the dining room. We eventually wandered back into the kitchen to ask for our food to go (it was brought to the table with to-go boxes 10-15 min later....). As a restaurant, it might be tempting to flirt with letting GrubHub account for a significant portion of your customers. Problem with that model can be seen here though -- eventually it's all you can do and you'll never attract a different audience until you detach yourself from that money-and-resource-leeching service.

As it is a small place, sometimes the owner gets mobbed with delivery orders, and if you are eating in, this may slow you down.  Either way, the food is delicious. Amazing veggie & meat samosas, and we have loved everything we have had, from the Rogen Josh that is spiced to perfection, to the other classics like butter chicken & chicken tikka.

I have seen places that re-heat the leftovers of previous day and serve them in the lunch buffets.  I have never dined in @ Paprika. Always had my food delivered.

The service could have been more attentive as we were there for quite a while waiting for our check as the waiters were the owner & a young guy who had to leave for a delivery (when he came back, we were still there waiting for our check). Nonetheless, the food was outstanding, the owner still very nice. We ordered delivery tonight, received our order in about an hour as specified, main dishes were chicken tikka masala & malai kofta, the herbed basmati is out of this world. As far as the naan is concerned as others have said it's more pita-like, they are correct, but I wonder, just like Mexican food varies region to region, maybe the naan does too. Still delish. It's nice to have a place to get great Indian food comparable to that you find on Devon without having to battle their traffic and lack of parking in that neighborhood.

In the end, for me, I'd rather have good food and less then stellar service, then less then stellar food and great service.  So, with that said, I've dined in twice at Paprika and ordered delivery a few other times. The food has always been consistently great. Indian food to me, is all about the spices and how they play off each other to create all the wonderful & tasty curries and sauces.  And all the dishes I've tried at Paprika are flavored & spiced to perfection. So on the food side, you can't go wrong.  Now the service on the other hand, has not been the best. The thing is, it's not that they are unfriendly or rude, they are actually very sweet, they are just slower then a Nordstrom shoe salesperson on the day after Thanksgiving. But at least at Nordstrom it's expected because the place is mobbed. But at Paprika, it's a small place (can serve maybe 20-30 people) so the lack of speedy service is a little disappointing. It just seems to take forever for someone to stop by and take your order, bring water, drop off the check, etc.  So here's the thing, I want you to support this place because the food is really great and the owner is very sweet and I want them to stay in business. Just make sure if you dine in that you plan for some extra time, bring another bottle of wine to chill out with, and don't go if in a rush. Or, get takeout!

Since it isn't cheaper or better located, Paprika's food had to be seriously slammin' for me to oust Essence of India in its favor.  The chicken tikka masala was good, but not good enough.  The lamb vindaloo was unimpressive.

Today I recieved plain white rice with my entree, instead of the AMAZING cardamom and cloved seasoned rice that came with it last time. Bummer. Maybe ask for it special next time? Service is slow when you dine in (EDITED on 4/20/13 to say: they have fixed a lot of their previous service problems, but since the chef makes everything absolutely from scratch, don't be shocked that your food doesn't come out five minutes after you order it like most other Indian places. Go with friends or a date that you can stare into the eyes of, and enjoy yourself. When you go with a group, order a bunch of different things and they will come out when they are ready. It's a nice steady flow of tons of different flavors and textures. The veggie dishes are never soggy, the meat is always tender, and everything is always beautifully spiced and balanced. I have made (and seen friends make) special dietary requests before, which the chef has always had no problem fulfilling (which items are gluten free, can this be done without an ingredient, etc.). ...so don't stop by hoping for a 20 minute dinner experience. Carry out also takes about 30 minutes, but in both cases, the food comes out piping hot and incredibly fresh. Sometime, when they start to become more popular, I have a feeling that their one batch at a time style might change a bit...but I'll wait the extra 30 minutes and enjoy the lovely atmosphere and pretty music that they have playing. I think that service problems will work themselves out in time. No one has ever been rude or unpleasant to me.  The place is very clean, though sometimes you can smell that the floor had just been washed. My favorite thing on the menu is the matar peneer. The peneer is soft and flavorful, not rubbery or hard like some other places that I've been to. Their chicken dishes also have tons of flavor and are wonderfully juicy and falling off the bone. My newest favorite is the lamb with spinach. This is one of my new favorite places. The chef is very visable, and likes to come out and say hello. For how much food you get, the price is right and it's in a somewhat hidden, but great location.  Hoping that they'll add a lunch service someday.

We're vegetarian, and there is a nice section for us. Several of the dishes were just a little different from the standard -- saag alloo panir (spinach, potato, cheese), for example, instead of saag panir (spinach cheese).  The difference here, again, was freshness.  Regular old saag panir is one of my favorite things, and is usually made with frozen spinach and so ends up as delicious green goo with cheese floating in it.  Here, the spinach was fresh, in long pieces and tasted like spinach.  The potatoes, delicious also, make up the volume difference (it'd take pounds of fresh spinach, and forever of washing, for an all-fresh spinach dish).  Other dishes were similarly themed, with pleasant surprises, real vegetables and delicious seasoning.  The malai kofta is miles above any other I've had. I made the comparison to another recently opened restaurant, Taxim, which is ""Greek"" but is nothing like the Halsted Greek consortium.  Completely surprising, seemingly more authentic (though I don't really know), and most certainly one of my favorite new places.

The samosa pastry was light and flaky, not too dense like it can often be. The veggie curry was bright and not too heavy and had an interesting assortment of vegs, and the dal was nicely spicy, and had big leaves of spinach or some kind of green in it.

However, my first experience was carry-out and was fabulous. I forgot to specify the heat level of spices when we ordered (doh!). Usually, I like Indian food nosebleed hot, but having food that is just gently spicy does allow you to appreciate the excellent quality of fresh food and spices used at Paprika.

We also ordered a couple of chutney selections, also top notch, mango, coriander, lime, cucumber raita and tamarind.  We got the alu gobhi tamatar-  tomatoes, potatoes and cauliflower were all fresh, and the spice combination excellent. We also went for the palak ki turka dahl, a spinach lentil dish which was more subtle and creamy. It all came with some sort of pilau rice, a nice bonus. We also ordered just one plain nan- just as well, as the order we received was massively outsized. It  was more yeasty and flaky than the nans we were used to,  and definitely tasted newly prepared. Most importantly, everything tasted even better the next day- the leftovers went on forever. Also we got a couple of the rice pudding dessert, the kheer. Danger, Will Robinson. One would have been enough for two, but why stop there? Take one home, at least.  The man who prepared the order- presumably the owner-  had it ready on time. It was early Saturday night and they were doing a good trade in carry out. You can tell customer service is a priority and i would certainly recommend this excellent little place with its friendly service and fab food. One word of warning, if it's wet out, watch yourself on the laminate floor, it gets slippy.",0.9977,0.721,0.242,0.037,0.566222374117111

Service was polite and efficient and as other reviewers have noted its BYOB, without any corkage fee, they give you a corkscrew at the table and you are on your own ! There is a corner liquor store across the steeet if you come unprepared, its not Binny's but you can get a straightforward Reisling or Chardonnay and you are good to go. A free assortment of chutneys is provided as you sit down, that's offered on the menu too, so when I enquired the waitress advised me not to bother as the menu item just gave a few more options. Food is cooked to order so there is a wait, but it worth every minute. I had probably the best lamb dish of my life here on my last visit.

Certain dishes have tasted as though something was burnt, perhaps the masalas, perhaps the onions, and rather than using paneer, they seem to be using Mexican queso blanco, which is quite a different thing altogether.

Service was nice.  Water, bottle opener, appatizers, table clean-up, and check were all delivered promptly, but the entrees took much longer for some reason. The mango chutney was out of this world!  The samosas were good, definitely better than average.  The entrees were average at best, but we might not have picked the best ones either.  My wife had the dish that had eggplant (the better of the two) and I had the cauliflower & potatoes, but it looked more like soup.  We both thought they're nan was well below average.  We had the garlic and the regular.  Not very fluffy or flavorful either. While we were there, a couple of byob groups showed up, and while our time there remained chill, I could see it getting loud after a couple of glasses of wine and there would be no escaping it in the small dining room Overall, I think we'll go back for another try.  I would like to sample some different entrees and see if we just made bad picks the first time.  I definitely need to have the mango chutney again.",0.9941,0.746,0.219,0.035,0.4481262327416174

Upon entering, you're embraced by by the aroma, cozy lighting and the owner's warm greeting. It's clear the food is cooked from the heart.  In fact, the owner, Shah, told us how much his family has always loved cooking together.  A very good sign.  While many Yelpers don't seem to tolerate waiting very well, we found it relaxing, with sitar-induced reveries swirling in our heads, and believe you me, the food's well worth it. If you don't want to wait, just call ahead to order your dishes, so your meal is ready when you get there.  They've relocated from a robust, mostly carry-out, delivery and catering operation on Devon.  Rich and balanced, each individually prepared dish is true home cookin'.  Choose from lots of vegetarian dishes alongside a good range of full-on lamb, beef, seafood and chicken dishes.  For our first visit, we ordered Baigan Ki Shag, or spinach and eggplant, which was elegantly seasoned; Chana Tamatar Mushroom; and Chicken Tikka Kabob.  The copious portions filled us both and we brought some home, along with extra menus for our neighbors.  Note that you can request any level of spiciness you desire:  mild, medium, spicy, or very spicy, ensuring an authentic experience for those who know their chutneys.  Speaking of which, when seated, you'll nibble on complimentary pappadum, lacy flatbreads - delicate yet strong - with slightly spicy coriander chutney, sweet mango chutney and raita (yogurty dip with cucumber and a hint of tomato).   We loved the  variety of toppings for the naans - also available in whole wheat.  The dessert  was deliriously delicious:  Mango custard sprinkled with chopped pistachios bathed in a rosewater syrup that must've been made in heaven:  they should call it  Aphrodesia.  It worked for us!  Can't wait to go back, in the name of research, of course - we've got to plow through every dish on the menu.  AND they're open on MONDAYS!!  What's not to love?",0.9974,0.772,0.217,0.012,0.5449166666666667

After dinner, the owner brought us a little dish of a mango custard they had just ""invented"".  It was amazing.  The delivery driver (?) sat at a table in the very tiny dining room and made strange, Godzilla-like noises whenever he moved.  It's BYOB, and there's NO corkage fee.",0.9841,0.737,0.201,0.061,0.6752941176470588

If you have the time and want to relax, this place was pretty good. The papadam's and chutneys were really delicious. The vegetable samosas were some of the best I've had. For entrees we had the vegetable vindaloo and the chicken madras. They were both HUGE portions. The flavor was good, but certainly not the best I've had. Maybe I'm spoiled when it comes to Indian food. Having Gaylord's lunch buffett so close to my office kind of makes every other Indian restaurant have to work really hard just to please me.

2010-01-30,5.0,"Okay, so I have to admit that my 5 star rating is based more on the awesome customer service than it is on the food, but that is not to discredit the food at all. My boyfriend and I went to Paprika last night with some friends of ours.  The place is very cute, but as other reviewers mentioned, very small, so we had a bit of a wait.  The place is byob, so we pulled up to the bar, opened a few bottles of beer and entertained ourselves.  After a while of waiting the server (who I believe is also the chef/owner?) gave us an appetizer of papadum and apologized for the wait.  How nice!  We were all pretty hungry when we got there and this certainly tied us over.  After waiting even longer, he gave us another round.  Super nice!  Finally, when our table was ready, he gave us samosas on the house and thanked us for our patience.  Now we did have over an hour wait, but I would say they certainly made up for it. I certainly don't suggest anyone go there and expect appetizers in exchange for waiting, but I do want to mention that this was a reflection of how we were treated the whole night.  They were extremely courteous, attentive, and just very sweet people. Now on to the food.  The meat samosas were delicious!  I liked the selection of nan and am glad we tried the Shahi nan which I'd never had before but absolutely loved.   We ordered chicken tikka masala which was good, channa alu masala which I thought tasted more authentic than in other places I've had it, but it was either missing something or had too much of something.  We also had chicken jalfrezi which I really enjoyed.  And we finished it all up with a nice cup of chai.  All the prices were very reasonable. The atmosphere was perfect for a night with friends - the decor was very nice, the lighting was just right and the volume was perfect on the Indian music in the background. All in all it we had an enjoyable experience and I will certainly be going back.  Welcome to the neighborhood Paprika!",0.9991,0.708,0.286,0.006,0.678883597883598

Both restaurants seem to take awhile to deliver, so I highly recommend carry out. I should also mentioned that at least twice, the delivery guy seemed befuddled by our credit card. Maybe he was delivering from 1940 -- but I think they replaced him. The guy who takes your order couldn't be friendlier, and he's been refreshingly honest about how busy they are and how long a delivery might take.  Hmm..it's probably a disservice to the food to not mention it until the 3rd paragraph, but it's REALLY good. Very bright, fresh and good portion sizes. The herb naan is great, and the samosas aren't leaden, like at a lot of places. Is it better than any place on Devon? I dunno.

2009-12-30,4.0,"We (a couple having Indian origins) joined a couple of our friends (who aren't Indian but love Indian food/culture) for a dinner at Paprika this past week. It was a relatively cold and quiet night, so we wasted no time enjoying some fine wine from my friend Doña Paula (she makes some of the best Malbecs) and getting to work on the ordering.   Well, ok, it does take awhile to get around to ordering here, and I think this might be the ONLY reason for me to give four stars, even though the food definitely qualifies for 5. I'm usually in no hurry, however, so if you are in a rush to get to the ER or something like that, you might not want to come here. But hey, you've gotta love BYOB, especially when you can get food THIS good. So we started with papadum and onion bhaji. You'll find yourself wanting more of both and the lovely tray of chutneys (you get more than 2 varieties here) but please don't. You need to save room for the main courses, which you will find to be generous. We enjoyed more dishes than we needed, suffice it to say, so if you are in a group of four, you're going to find that 3 dishes might be sufficient, especially if you opt for appetizers. You'll find this menu ""peppered"" with dishes familiar and not-so-familiar. We were particularly taken in by the Chicken Tikka Masala--a ""UK Indian"" dish--which was richly spiced and less richly creamed (thank you!) I was particularly taken in by the Bengali fish curry, which reminded me a lot of fish and chicken dishes that I grew up with (my father is from Kerala) but never rose to the level of the cooking here. We all liked the Lamb Vindaloo. Although the menu is fairly concise, you'll find a lot more variety here than in most Indian restaurants in Chicago, and you're going to find a consistently good taste. As I mentioned, service in the dining room is not going to break speed records. We met chef-owner, Kabir, the night we were there, and he made it clear to us that he and his family (whom we spotted in the kitchen) spend most of their day in the kitchen. He's truly in it for the love of cooking, and you can see it in his face. I only see upside potential for this restaurant, and this place reminds me a bit of an Indian restaurant on Lawrence (over a decade ago) that didn't make it (Banana Leaf), which specialized in South Indian cooking and inhabited a similar storefront space. So I hope that Paprika will continue to maintain its high standards when it comes to the food. We still love going to Devon, of course, but it is nice to be able to go to a part of Chicago where parking is amply available and not have to fight the crowds.  Oh, I almost forgot. I concur with one of the earlier reviews. You've gotta try the rice pudding here. These guys make it the same way I used to do so at home. They make sure to sprinkle powdered cinnamon on top.  And the pistachios add a nice touch.  You'll leave with a great taste in your mouth, even if you arrive late wherever you were supposed to be in half an hour after ordering your appetizers.

Picked up a menu on the way home from work yesterday. My wife and I were really impressed by the offerings. They have all the standards, but they also had a lot of southern Indian dishes (more vegetarian stuff and a lot of fish dishes), as well. But fear not, meat eaters. They still have loads of chicken, beef, and lamb. We ordered our meal, and were told it would be ready in a half-hour. After 25 minutes, I put on my coat, hiked the strenuous 3 minutes, and was back with a big bag of food in about 10 minutes. (The place itself was very clean and the service was friendly. The chef/owner came out of the kitchen to say hello and thank me for the order.) On to the food! We ordered Alu Gobhi Tamatar (a curry of red potatoes, cauliflower, and tomatoes. Very tasty.), Chana Tamatar Mushroom (chickpeas, tomatoes, and mushrooms. My wife preferred this one. I liked it, but thought the Alu Gobhi was much better.), and Tilapia Dhanshak (This was freaking awesome--tilapia, lightly fried, in a thick, spicy lentil stew. I loved it.) We also got naan and raita. The raita was terrific, the naan was good. Not great, but good. Rice came with the three entrees, which is a nice touch. That said, the rice was a tad dry.  Other than the rice, I have only one minor complaint. When I ordered the tilapia dish, I was asked how spicy I wanted it. I said, without hesitation, ""Very spicy."" I was questioned, ""Very spicy, really?"" ""Yes, please!"" The dish (which, as I already mentioned, was delicious) was only sort of spicy. I think they were going easy on me. They shouldn't have.  If a place offers a ""very spicy"" option, they should make sure it's ""very spicy!"" While I certainly haven't visited most of the Indian restaurants in Chicago, I have been to seven or eight of them over the years. (Several on Devon, one in Lincoln Square, a couple downtown.)

2009-10-22,4.0,"So, after several years' worth of prayer, incense burning and virgin sacrifice, the food gods have finally answered with an Indian restaurant in the neighbourhood. Okay, I'm thinking that some of those virgins were non-practising, otherwise Paprika Indian Gourmet would be a lot closer to where I live. But who am I to question the wisdom of the Food Gods? Actually, it's less than a five minute bike ride from my flat in Albany Park so maybe I should shut up and light another stick of incense. The food at Paprika seems very much what you'd get as a guest in someone's home. For instance, the spinach in the 'shag alu pannir' isn't pureed as is common practice at most Chicago Indian restaurants. The vegetables are chunkier and less cooked down. The flavours are brighter. There's evidence of caring hands at work here. For someone who works late, as I often do, Paprika is a foodgodsend with its late hours: 4 - 11p (Mon - Thurs), 4p - Midnight (Fri), 1130a - Midnight (Sat) and 1130a -  1000p (Sun). Yup, they now serve lunch at the weekends. By my estimation, they put in more hours than god. Well, more than the food gods, at the very least. They also deliver for a small fee of $2.95. After several takeaway runs, the following are emerging as standouts in my book: - Basil Ki Chicken: boneless chicken with chunky vegetables and basil - Murg Dhanshak: boneless chicken with lentils and spices - Alu Gobhi Tamatar: cauliflower with potatoes, tomatoes - Shag Alu Pannir: spinach with cheese - Basmati rice pilaf - Cheese naan - Salmon tikka kabob: perhaps my favourite, salmon cubes cooked with chunky vegetables in a spicy, tangy tomato sauce Mains come with complimentary steamed jasmine rice. Basmati rice is also available for a small price. In every case, the spices are balanced perfectly. The food has heat when it's supposed to and is complex at every turn. As someone noted, some of the dishes were slightly undersalted early on but I haven't noticed that lately. To be honest, I prefer it when chefs are conservative with salt. It's so easy to correct the seasoning to your taste, while an oversalted dish is invariably ruined. That, I cannot stand. Every time I enter the place, it's like falling into a pillow of warm, spicy aromas. Then Shah the owner ambles forward with a welcoming smile. It really is a great experience, every time. Well, I'd like to keep rambling on but there's a shipment of virgins I have to check on.

That said, there are some kinks to be worked out in this place.  As another reviewer said, it is freezing in there.  I know the kitchen can get hot, but there still needs to be warmth in the dining area.  Our samosas were not thoroughly cooked.  To their credit, we were not charged for them, nor were we charged for our mango lassis.  And they cooked the samosas thoroughly after that.  They were very good, and were not greasy at all. About those mango lassis.  It was a most generous serving, to say the least, and it was delicious.  I had the paprika chicken, because I figured that had to be the plate to have at a place that has paprika in its name.  Very tasty, and a huge serving it was.  If I was less hungry, there would have been leftovers. It is BYOB, as has been mentioned.  As much as I love to have wine with dinner, I just can't do it with Indian food, because I need that lassi to handle the spice.  If I brought a wine in, I'd probably try a riesling, though.   Basically, they have the food part down.  They need to hire more staff so the place can run more smoothly.  I really hope they can get this issue squared away.  I felt so bad for that kid who worked the front, because he worked his ass off and he had to handle everything himself.  He waited the tables, handled all the takeout business, and cashed everyone out.  If they can get the operations part down, this place will definitely make it, and I'll add another star.",0.9882,0.828,0.138,0.034,0.5770555555555557

On the other hand, in a city chocked full of delicious Indian spots, you gotta be good to really represent.  We basically had an ok dinner at Paprika. Nothing earth shattering, mind blowing or even exceptional. The space was nice and cozy, albeit sweltering with heat and humidity, which made eating spicy curry a laborious chore! It was obviously our servers first day of waiting EVER in his life. He didn't know how to use a corkscrew and ran around like a chicken with his head cut off practically all night. We ordered the food and it took about 20 minutes to come. All in all, they were good, homemade curries. My major complaint was that EVERYTHING lacked salt and was very bland...which sort of ruined my dish for me. My girlfriends Tikka Masala was good but lacked the sauciness that makes the dish so appealing. The portions were big, which is nice for a change.  We did notice a lot of service errors, which i'm assuming will get ironed out as they get going. They seemed to have a lot of deliveries that were backing the kitchen up. Nonetheless, I always thought it's poor form to put your deliveries in front of your seated customers. There was one table who ordered 5 minutes after us, but still hadn't gotten their food when we paid and were leaving! They were pissed and rightfully so!

2009-09-12,5.0,"We are so happy this restaurant moved into the neighborhood!  The food was excellent, and the service was great!  The spices are slightly different than the Indian food I am used to (based on other reviews it seems they might be Himalayan?), but they were delicious.  The paratha was excellent, and the veggie curries we got were flavorful but not oily (we got the chickpea, tomato and mushroom curry and the pea, tomato and cheese curry).  The owner was really friendly and the waiter was nice and responsive.  Also, it's BYOB!! My only warning is that the restaurant was really cold--bring a sweater!",0.9828,0.731,0.244,0.025,0.7659090909090908
2009-09-05,3.0,"Yay! An alternative to Essence of India in Lincoln Square. Paprika is within a 5 minute walk of Rockwell CTA, so super convenient.  They left menus at my apartment door, so I had to check it out. I came in and ordered take-out. The owner, I assume, is friendly and welcoming. I had the Mattar Paneer and Malai Kofta, but there are other vegetarian dishes. Rice is actually included. (Don't you hate it when restaurants charge extra for it?) They even had vegetable vindaloo, which I seldom see on menus. The restaurant is modern, slightly dark with brick red tones and soothing sitar music in the background. It's definitely not a hole-in-the-wall Indian joint. I think Paprika is casual date-worthy. I have a few quips about the food. The rice was overcooked, so it was a little mushy. Not fluffy and slightly firm. The koftas in the Malai Kofta were plentiful, but there was little sauce. Other than that, everything was spiced well and delicious. Paprika also offers delivery, and the fee is $2.95. If you prefer to drive, the restaurant is located in a tiny shopping center with parking.",0.9795,0.853,0.147,0.0,0.3901515151515152
2009-09-03,5.0,"Food is very fresh and delicious! I went twice in one week! The owner was very nice and brought out dessert on the house! It's BYOB and they now accept credit cards. They're still working out a few kinks as it's only been open 3 weeks, but the food was so good it's worth it!",0.9513,0.704,0.296,0.0,0.6187499999999999
2009-08-21,5.0,"The food here was delicious.  The service was super friendly.  It is because of those two most important categories that I give this brand new establishment 5 stars.  The Chutneys were delicious and the Naan was soft and warm.  The Chicken Tikka Masala was just the right level of spice and the flavors were well balanced.  Everything seemed well prepared but don't expect much in the way of presentation as our food was given to us in take-out ready plastic containers. The decor here was minimal so I wouldn't go expecting ambiance either.  Also, they don't have credit card processing yet so bring cash.  Conclusion, if you're in the mood for some very tasty Indian cuisine at good prices THIS is the place to check out. They are B.Y.O.B. and they deliver!",0.947,0.813,0.168,0.019,0.6098079004329005
2009-08-20,4.0,"This place just opened and hasn't started advertising so we had the whole place to ourselves.  I was impressed by the quality of the ingredients and the balance of the spices.   They still have a few new restaurant kinks to work out (no credit card machine yet, no liquor or byob sign) so the final vote isn't in, but according the Magic 8 Ball, all signs point to yes!",0.7263,0.87,0.108,0.022,0.6590909090909091
