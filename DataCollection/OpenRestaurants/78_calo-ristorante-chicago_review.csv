As for the food - wow delicious!! Very generous portions and fresh and hot!  The wine was affordable and yummy. The decor of the restaurant was very well done and cozy and classy.

2017-08-26,4.0,"Can't beat this place for a good solid meal and a guarantee of either a great late night snack after being out all night or a very good lunch the next day.  I highly recommend the Ziti Molese (House-made ground Italian sausage, green peas, San Marzano tomato sauce, garlic, EVOO).  Ask for extra Italian sausage and get a side of meatballs to add to it.  Rigatoni Barese is also another favorite of mine (Italian sausage, chicken, asparagus, roasted red pepper, tomato sauce, garlic, EVOO). And I can't recall the Italian name for the one appetizer we get, but it translate to Fruit of the Sea.  Get that for real!  It comes with grilled octopus, calamari, shrimp and scallops on a lovely bed of garlic spinach and lemons.  Grilled to perfection.  There is a full size (serves 3-4) and a half size (serves 2-3).  My daughter and I get the half size and I am telling you that there is not room for sharing with a third person if you all love grilled seafood. Great bar because they carry sparkling wine by the bottle or splits. There is street parking but Calo has parking across the street in a parking lot.  The entrance is on the west side of clark, next to where the Swedish Bakery use to be and Replay.  You can also access it from Balmoral (one way street going east).  Calo will validate your parking ticket, so it is free parking.",0.9918,0.814,0.175,0.011,0.3770512820512821
2017-08-20,5.0,What an incredible meal! A friend suggested the restaurant as we were debating where to go- one of the best experiences I have had. We didn't have a reservation so was asked to have a drink at the bar- as we walked down to find our seats the aromas blew me away. Thank goodness we didn't wait long as my mouth was salivating. The focaccia they supply is sooo good but save the space! The green salad was fresh but the egg plant dish I had and the two different risotto meals my partner and his best friend had-were unbelievably good!

Most of the entrees I have had have been very good, especially the pasta entrees and I enjoy their pizza/foccacia bread that comes for free. The reason I down-graded the review is because I tried their house salad (included with the entree) and I just couldn't believe how not fresh it was-- the server said that some of the lettuce could have been on the bottom of the veggie box in the fridge so it could explain the dampness and cold, but even when I had a replacement salad, it wasn't much better. I have a feeling that they don't make the salads as fresh as they could (despite the fact we were eating at an off-hour @2:00 pm), and compared  to the wonderful other things I had, this was hard to accept and kind of disappointing .",0.7208,0.805,0.118,0.077,0.6103508771929824

2017-07-02,2.0,"Went to dinner at Calo's tonight for the first time. We were pretty excited about it, checked out the menu a week before when in the area and decided to come back to the area just to eat here. I ordered a glass of wine, primitivo, the waitress had no idea what I was talking about so I pointed it out to her and she still brought the wrong wine, twice. We ordered an antipasto, rotolo mozzarella, a pasta, pappadelle fughi, and a carbonara pizza. Both the mozzarella and pasta were just what we expected, delicious! Unfortunately we were delivered the carbonara pasta instead of the pizza. Easy mistake and understandable. We got our pizza 5 minutes. Excited to try their Neapolitan pizza we were very disappointed. Considering the fact that they serve thin, pan, stuffed, and Neapolitan pizza we figured they knew the difference. Their Neapolitan pizza is no different then their thin. It's not soft, elastic, or thinner. Not cooked differently, and should not be considered Neapolitan pizza. After eating one piece each we talked to the waitress about it possibly being a mistake. She did not seems to care about our concern and we just had her take the rest of the pizza away and got the check. Still confused on the style of pizza we talked to a manager. She was nice, understood our concern but still charged us for the pizza we didn't eat and didn't like. It's disappointing to pay for food you didn't like or eat. We work hard for our $$$. As nice as the manager was she did not handle the situation in what I believe is the right manner.

While I appreciate a good Chicago deep dish pizza, I rely on Calo to get my fill of delicious thin crust pizza. I always order the thin crust, typically with cheese or pepperoni (I know, so boring), but you don't need to get fancy with this pizza. The pizza is no frills, the dough is cooked perfectly, and it's just hands-down a great pizza. I also order the mozzarella sticks and wings, both of which are great as well.

2017-06-15,2.0,"I have been going to Calo's for years and this is the first time I can say after spending $200-- on dinner that my experience has be anything but exceptional. I have never been to an establishment where the staff sides with staff when the server screws up. So what happened, I took my family to Calo's for a going away dinner tonight. My sister could not join us for dinner, so I ordered her a rib dinner to go. I preordered the ribs with the server the same time we all ordered dinner. the server brought the check to me and left with my visa, she was gone a few minutes then came back asking to see my ID. Not sure what that was about considering I wasn't carded when I order my beer. After I paid the bill we all left the restaurant and walked to the parking lot- I put the food in the back of my car when I realized the server never gave us the rib dinner. I went back to the restaurant and told the hostess and she called the server over to ask about the ribs I ordered. I asked the server what happened to the rib order and she said, ""well, I didn't charge you for ribs"". I said that charging me for the ribs was not the issue. I ordered ribs and she failed to give me the order. I also tipped this server 20+ % and for what? Another, employee standing at the front desk sided with the server making excuses for why the server forgot the to-go order. She scolded me like a child and basically told me that everyone makes mistakes and I should not put the server down. Ok, I never put the server down. She dropped the ball on this order during a time restaurant was not slammed. there was no reason for the server to forget my extra order. The other staff member wouldn't stop with the scolding. She went on about how she was going to give me the ribs for free and not charge me to basically get over it. I never asked for anything for free. I expect good service from Calo since this is considered a better quality eating establishment. Tonight, I have learned that the customer experience at Calo's comes last and their employees come first. I won't stop going to Calo's because I love the food, but I won't forget the experience.

First, once you sit down, they offer you complimentary bread- and not just sourdough or white bread, but focaccia bread, which was absolutely amazing. For the entree, I ordered the rotolo di melanzana, which is eggplant rolled and stuffed with ricotta and garlic, topped with marinara sauce and baked with mozzarella cheese on top. The entree was great and the portion size was huge that I only ate half and took the rest home.  Only downside is that there was A LOT of cheese for my liking, which probably isn't a downside for others. The entree came with a choice of soup or salad, and since their minestrone soup was made with chicken broth, I had to get the salad. The salad was good, but their italian dressing tasted bland.

2017-04-12,1.0,"I have been looking for a new pizza place for delivery and decided to try Calos based on the reviews. Our pizza was thirty minutes late, which means that it took a total of 1 1/2 hours for the delivery of a single large pizza. When the delivery did eventually arrive, the delivery man literally just handed me the pizza and walked off. Both the box and pizza were ice cold. I called Calos to complain, and they refused to refund the pizza or the tip to my credit card.

2017-04-05,2.0,"We decided give Calo a try because we had seen positive reviews posted.  However, our experience was not quite as enthusiastic as others.   I called for a reservation and we  were seated upon arrival but the hostesses were not overly friendly or welcoming.  We thought we would be seated in the main dining room but she placed us  near the back of the bar area next to a large table with a flat screen TV. Minimally she should have asked if we wanted to be in that space.   The waitress however, was very nice and efficient as well as the rest of the wait staff.  Food:   COZZE with marinara sauce was excellent.  The mussels were very generous, fresh and plump cooked to perfection.  It went well with the bread basket they served and we did not leave a drop.  Pasta - although the entrees were served in huge portions they sacrificed quality.   BUCATINI AMATRIGIANA with shrimp, pancetta, onion, spicy tomato garlic, EVOO. The bucatini was huge (like fat pieces of rope) and undercooked.  The entree would have been better with a smaller size bucatini.  It actually  seemed like they were trying to fill the bowl with oversersized pasta so it would not appear to be skimping on the main ingredients.  The 4 shrimps were cooked perfectly but there was not enough sauce for the entire dish.  The pancetta was almost all pieces of fat and the onions were very large slices...not appealing at all.  FARFALLE BUTERA with Italian sausage, green peas, cream gorgonzola cheese sauce. The entree arrived totally immersed in cream and cheese sauce.  It was actually gross.  My husband generally loves this dish but he barely touched it because he said he as never seen pasta drowned in sauce like that before.  We passed on dessert because we had had enough and decided to head elsewhere to finish the evening.   The restaurant certainly has a great family history and seems to be a neighborhood magnet.  However, there are way more restaurants in the area that seem to place more on the quality.",0.9972,0.774,0.202,0.024,0.4761963261963262

The male employee informed me that my total was $46. 85 - I said ""great"" - I have a coupon for $5.00 off when your order is $40.00 or more - he then told me that that offer is only good for your ""subtotal"" before taxes - and my ""subtotal"" was $38.85- ""Really?"" I stated in defiance. You are going to nickel and dime me for a dollar and change - I can't use the coupon? I felt their advertising coupon was deceptive in not stating that fact. For some reason, this went through my head. I think it's utterly disrespectful to hard working people everywhere - I am a loyal customer who has paid Calo's a small fortunate in the last ten years - I love your food, the leftovers are to die for, but this type of false advertising that lures in a loyal customer who believes he is getting a 'break' - only to be told told, ""Sorry. Your subtotal falls short."" is bullshit. Rethink your strategy or spell out your  lame excuse for rewarding loyal customers - or enticing in new customers. After reading several other reviews, I will venture to state that Calo's conduct is unethical in some business practices - stop it. Don't gouge Valentine's Day diners and don't tease customers in on a deal that is not realistic - be upfront if you have to - but better yet, offer a sincere offer that makes your customers feel appreciated - especially wen they return time and time again.

We got a party pizza with artichoke, mushroom, and prosciutto. It was delivered in a timely fashion and was REALLY delicious. It was also the perfect amount of pizza for four people! Yay. We also got the fried zucchini appetizer. It tasted fine but the presentation was a bit odd to me. I expected circular slices of zucchini, but instead it was long strips (the length of the zucchini). Made them a little tough to eat since they were very floppy and the breading fell right off -- had to enjoy with a knife and fork. This may have been a product of ordering them for delivery, though.

2017-02-14,1.0,"Went to Calo for Valentines dinner and was extremely disappointed to learn that prices were raised for the Hallmark holiday.  Why? Because it was a ""special"" menu. When the check came and noticed the $5 up charge for the meal I asked the server why prices were higher? He said because it was a special menu. I asked what was so special about it except the higher prices and he smiled and said ""I have no idea why the owner does that."" I asked again why they kept on referring to it as a special menu and he could not give me a logical answer. Nothing about the evening was special ... ordered the same Ziti Vodka dish that is normally $16.95, special price-$19.95 and my boyfriend ordered his staple Fettuccini Alfredo normally $14.95, special price-$19.95.  As you can see his dish was $5 more and mine was $3 more. No continuity in the up-charge.  A dish normally $2 less on the regular menu is now $2 more in the special menu??  Price gouging is not only amoral but it's unethical. Companies are consistently sanctioned for practicing it. If the ""special"" menu came with a drink ... that would be special. If there was a flower of any kind on the table that would be special. If romantic music was being played instead of Def Leopard-Photograph, Dead or Live-Brand New Lover and Michael Jackson-Dirty Diana ... would be special. Maybe a dessert with a ""special"" menu would be very special.  However charging people more to eat the same food, same portions just because it's Valentine's Day is reprehensible.  This has NOTHING to do with the food or service staff. This is about the owner price gouging not only the ""special"" menu but the carry-out menu as well. When I brought it up to the manager he said ""I'd be able to help you out if you said something before you ordered but you saw the prices so I can't help you.""

After it was mentioned that various family is from Turkey and this being their last night after a 18 day visit, the already friendly manager became even more engaging and friendly. He being from Pakistan, told us various and somewhat humorous tales of travel and his own personal foray into the restaurant business. He claimed to be the kind of manager that pushes up his sleeves to pitch in where he's needed. My daughter having formally worked in hospitality, turns out, she and the manager both know the same person at another high end establishment...Small world. A shout out and a great big thank you to the reception staff, the attentive bus and wait staff for their extra efforts, to the great and varied menu selections to the wonderful food, to the friendly, knowledgeable and humorous manager who comped a delicious dessert. Weather wise, mother nature provided a special moon and balmy chicago windy weather that made the relatives last night in chicago a wonderfully memorable experience. We will be back to this restaurant oasis as the food and staff it employs is uncommonly good. Thank you Calo Restaurant.

2016-10-09,3.0,I have been going to Calo for 15 years and ordering pizza for home delivery for the same. The food is always good and the ambiance of the restaurant is great. I would have given 5 stars in years past but the delivery has taken a drastic turn for the worse. In the last year I would estimate that 80% of the pizza deliveries have been terrible. The pizza is all slopped around. We usually don't figure it out until the delivery person is gone. Not in the mood to wait another hour for another pizza. It's really a bummer that the delivery service has become so careless.,-0.9325,0.821,0.038,0.141,0.47416666666666674

I brought my wife and child and they were very accommodating to my year old son.

When we arrived, the restaurant was almost full with people starting to wait for tables to open up. We were seated promptly at our reservation time and were greeted by our waiter to take our drink order.  Next came three big baskets of bread for our table, butter included. The menu was quite extensive with a huge variety of pastas and pizzas.   The appetizers and main courses came out in good time, served by the waiter and other table helpers.  The main courses were huge, definitely big enough to share and were accompanied by a good sized salad.  The dish I had, Linguini Carbonara, was amazing.  At a price of $15.95, this is a definite value with the bread and salad that comes with it.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant and would put it in my return list for next year.",0.9927,0.773,0.227,0.0,0.4637820512820513

2016-07-13,5.0,"CLASSIC ITALIAN I never knew this restaurant existed. My wife & I were sitting in a dive bar called Grayland Pub - aka Kennedy's when a stranger walked in and offered us pizza. The bartender/owner Patrick seemed to know the guy and we decided to go against our parents wishes and eat food from a complete stranger in a dive bar. As I write this sober, I feel like our beer may have clouded our judgement at that moment but I must admit the pizza was really good. In fact, it's a great testament to a pizza that can travel well. These two locations are very far from each other and I think the guy took a bus too.  Wow we are lucky to be alive. Ha! I did instantly bookmarked this place because the pizza was so good.  I finally was able to come to the restaurant for an event recently. I must admit all of the food was really good. We started out with the meat and cheese platter along with vegetables. I loved the roasted red peppers and all of the Italian meats. I was a very happy Sicilian boy. Then came out some deep fried calamari. The calamari was very good and everyone gobbled it up. They also had some beautiful looking platters with burrata wrapped in prosciutto and drizzled with balsamic. Then the pizzas started coming out and I was so excited to try them warm because if you remember my first experience was with some stranger serving me cold Calo pizza in a dive bar across town.  The pizzas were perfect. They reminded me of a perfect simple thin crust Chicago style pizza. I was completely happy with my trip here and I can hardly wait to come back.  Before leaving, I decided to grab a drink at the bar. The bartender was really nice and the Cubs game was on. I then realized that most of the people at the bar were flying solo. Some were drinking while others were having a full dinner at the bar. I then realized that this place is a total neighborhood joint. It's a place where families can sit at a table together or complete strangers could dine solo at the bar. The best part is all of us solo drinkers & eaters started talking about the Cubs. We had bonded over food, drinks and baseball. This place is comfortable and a perfect setting to bring people together. Then it reminded me of the guy who brought that pizza into Grayland Pub. It was this kind of bar room friendship that makes Chicago special. We connected over great Italian food and that pretty much sums up an Italian family. Thanks Calo for connecting people. We could all learn something about the World from hanging out here. So if you're looking for some Old School Italian then make your way over here.

Let's face it some nights you don't want to drive to the heart of the city for Rosebud's, Carmines, RPM, or whatever else your stomach desires.  Calo's is the answer to that. Easy street parking or parking right across the street in a lot. It's a medium size restaurant so usually you can get seated within a decent time even on a busy Saturday night. If you have a small party 1-3 sit at the bar. The bartenders are great! And you can eat there too.  They give you bread and butter and a pizza type bread before dinner. Don't eat a lot because their portions are large and delish. They have great pizza and I love their lasagna. But the best dish there and sometimes it's not on the menu but just as for it is the farfalle butera. It's bow tie (farfalle) pasta with a white cream sauce that is so cheesy and rich along with Italian sausage cut up and cooked in it and peas. It's one of my favorite dishes in all of Chicago.  Plenty of tvs and always has great music playing. A little dark but I like that in a restaurant.  And that's all I have to say about that.   Jackée",0.9857,0.826,0.157,0.016,0.5551948051948051

However, no stars off for that, it's not their fault that people love this joint. Okay, so a table in the dining room.

Nice size chunk of fish, in a delicious, creamy sauce, but sadly a tad overdone. Garlic mashed potatoes for my side, those were tasty, if a tiny bit dry. My fabBF had the Canelloni special and he really liked it. Pasta crepes stuffed with chicken, in a tangy red sauce. That was tasty well.

I scrolled down and looked at all the delicious food that previous customers took of and decided to get delivery.  WORST.DECISION.OF.MY.LIFE. For a pricey and well-known restaurant, Calo has the WORST food in delivery.  I ordered Veal with mushrooms and Ravioli stuffed with lobster because the photos looked bomb, except those were taken inside the restaurant, not in the comfort of your home.  The veal seemed to have been drenched in what it looked to be a soup of whatever it was marinated with and the mushrooms were floating on the soup. Yes, it was edible. I give it 3/10  The ravioli which I thought would be more appetizing, turned out to be piece of shit. Seriously they put the cream sauce on the container and just put the ravioli on top of it- meaning that they did not cook the ravioli with the sauce together. The lobster filling tasted like vomit- I couldn't even take another bite of that disgusting fake pasta. All my 3 roommates said it tasted like shit. I give it a -10/+10  Oh yah, I also got fresh Tiramisu cake- all smushed. Delicious but smushed. 7/10 I assume because the restaurant is so packed that they don't give a flying duck about preparing delivery food with the same quality as the food delivered inside.  I am paying the same amount as those customers(actually a little more cuz grubhub fees & delivery but anyway)- don't I deserve same quality food as the customers who dine in?

2015-07-27,3.0,"I was hoping to give a higher rating on what used to be one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I have been coming to Calo's for over 20 years.  Many for special occasions, such as birthdays. This past Friday I took a friend for his birthday there and was looking forward to a great experience. When we arrived our reservation was not recorded properly so we had to wait. I will say they were very quick in accommodating us and this was appreciated. I have always had exceptional service here and if I could rate that separately I would give it 5 stars. They are always friendly and know what they are doing. The problem with this visit and the last several has been the taste and quality of the food. I know Calo's is much busier than when I first started going. I am thinking that maybe kitchen has not been able to keep pace with the growth of customers and turnover of tables. After a cocktail we started off with my favorite, the fried calamari. The order came out and it seemed to me that the portion was less and it was warm at best. For the main course, my friend ordered one of my favorites the BBQ full slab of ribs with garlic mashed potatoes and the minestrone soup. His soup was bland and he mentioned it to me after the first bite. I accepted a taste and agreed with him. With this being his first visit I was disappointed as I was looking for him to have a great dining experience. I ordered the salmon special, baked potato, and salad. In a nutshell here is how I would describe the dishes: My salmon was cooked okay, a bit on the underdone side, which is okay because if needed I can always ask to cook a little more. It was a good size portion but not very flavorful. The baked potato was over-cooked and small sized for a restaurant. My salad was okay, not like they used to have, a big salad with lots of veggies in it. My friend enjoyed his ribs although when I tasted one, I thought they were over-cooked and dry. His mashed potatoes came to the table cold. He decided he couldn't eat them but would take him home and heat them up for lunch the next day. So overall I am giving tonight's meal a 3 and that is weighted heavily because of the service at the table and their ability to quickly rectify the lack of the reservation being taken. I know I will go again, I just hope they can bring the quality of the food back to where it was. Calo's is not cheap and with drinks and a bottle of wine the price adds up quickly. I hope the management will keep closer tabs on what comes out of the kitchen as they have a great history and hope that can keep it and build on it.",0.9949,0.839,0.142,0.019,0.47383381924198253

2015-05-19,5.0,"Why did it take us so long to stumble upon this Andersonville gem that has stood the test of time for over 50+ years (1963), from generation to generation.  My 7 year-old daughter and my ex make it a point to have ""family"" dinner once a week and we thought we'd venture to a different neighborhood to try something new. We found parking right in front (though I believe they have a lot across the street). We took a look inside before we made up our mind. The menu suited our tastes but what truly sealed the deal was, that for a Tuesday night, every table in the dining room was filled with loyalists and eclectics alike.  Don't get me wrong, we sat within minutes; the time we did spend waiting for a table afforded us the opportunity to chat with Victor (the founder's son). This guy should run for office! A consummate gentleman who made us feel just as proud of the legacy his family created as he was. My daughter's ears perked up and may have even learned a lesson or two about tradition. Noting it was our first visit, Victor checked on our table after we sat down, and even sent over some prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella to welcome us into his ""second home."" This guy is a class act and the main reason I chose to come home and sing the restaurant's praises on yelp. Ok. Ok. The food. We each had house salads, the grilled octopus (Polipo Griglia) and the Rigatoni Alla Barese (Italian sausage, chicken, asparagus and roasted red peppers in a zesty tomato, garlic and olive oil sauce). I actually ate less than I wanted to just so I could eat it again for lunch tomorrow. My daughter had buttered noodles (I know, kinda lame) but she finished her plate and scarfed down a miniature chocolate cake within minutes of its placement on our table. By the way, our waiter, Vasile, was attentive, helped guide us through the menu and seemed as much a part of the legacy as Victor and his family.  If you haven't been, go. If you are already a fan, we'll see you the next time. Which, I can assure you, will be soon.",0.991,0.893,0.107,0.0,0.4583904521404521

I have always liked the look of the restaurant and appreciated the cleanliness. It has its own parking lot which is a plus as well. My partner Chris and I prefer sitting in the booths. Bar side is usually louder than the main dining room side. The attentiveness and overall speed of service are well above average. The complementary focaccia bread is tremendous and one can never have enough of it. Everyone should take advantage of the specials. They are an excellent value. Each entree comes with soup or salad. My partner Chris and I usually order a salad with creamy garlic and ranch respectively. Veggies are always fresh and the dressings are delicious. Calo knows its pasta and sauces. From linguini to ravioli, everything is always cooked perfectly, the sauces addictive and the portions large. I usually take leftovers home for the next day. Fettucine Alfredo with chicken, congealed. So good. The BBQ ribs on the specials menu are a pleasant surprise! Sauce has a sweetness to it that is simply wonderful! Unfortunately, many people have found out about this place (they are in the know!) and it is usually mobbed on the weekends. During the cold months, waiting in the cramped entryway for a table amongst tons of hungry people can be quite irritating. I agree with other yelpers, the hostesses can be fairly abrupt and unfriendly which contrasts greatly with the liveliness of the place. Very odd.

When I'm not in the mood for pizza, Calo's Rotolo Di Melanzana is delicious with lightly fried eggplant rolled with airy ricotta and topped with mozzarella.

The pizza bread/focaccia was great and made me want to try their pizza one day. We had prosciutto wrapped melon for an appetizer and loved it! I was leery of ordering melon (cantaloupe) in the winter because I feared it wouldn't be ripe, but it was! It was served over fresh, lovely mixed greens with shaved parmesan and a simple vinaigrette. Yum. The husband had ravioli and I had gorgonzola stuffed gnocchi. Both were good... nothing ground breaking, but good! Remember, this is an old school place! For dessert, we had killer tiramisu. It was rich, dense, and purely delicious. The husband also had espresso which he enjoyed. It was served with lemon peel...this is the way to do it! No one does this anymore.   Our waitress was fantastic. She was upbeat, friendly, and attentive with not a snooty bone in her body. Loved her! The rest of the staff seemed very on top of their work.

(Bummer that late-night options in Chicago are only greasy spoons, fast-food, Fireside, and Smith & Wollensky's downstairs dungeon). Yet they always seem to find us a table so long as the kitchen's still open. I have been a low-carb eater for several years now, but they always accommodate me. The menu offers many options that don't depend on pasta, pizza, risotto or starchy breaded or battered fried stuff: two cuts of steak, grilled seafood, zuppa di pesce (bouillabaisse Italiano), shrimp de Jonghe, even Caesar salads sans croutons but with proteins added.  Big props for serving real espresso made from freshly ground beans in a professional dual-group machine, instead of from capsules or pods.  Ditto the free parking, a vanishing commodity everywhere but especially in Andersonville.  My only culinary gripes are that they no longer put a rudimentary antipasto (radishes, olives, cheese cubes, salumi) in the bread basket (the insanely good freebie pizza bread sits there and taunts me); all the chicken dishes use only skinless breasts (not as juicy or flavorful as thighs & legs); the ribs aren't real BBQ (but they make no bones--pun intended--about that, since traditional Chicago-style baby backs are boiled and then baked in sauce) and thus not offered sauceless (would be unpalatable if they were); and they don't offer a fruit cup, cheese plate or berries for dessert for those of us who shun sugar.  What I don't understand is how people can consistently post scathing one-star reviews based solely on delivery, when they've never set foot in a restaurant; or that they are scandalized by prices higher than those charged by the corner thin-crust-and-Italian-beef-sandwich joints.

2015-01-20,3.0,"Coming from someone who really loves Italian food, this review of Calo Ristorante may be more critical as it's Americanized Italian.  Nice ambiance that brought in plenty of couples on a date on a Saturday evening, and the service was lovely.  The food was fine - nothing to rave about, but I can't say that we didn't enjoy it as the three of us were in food coma for the rest of the night.  Free lot parking across the street was very helpful. The grilled calamari came with three large pieces of charred calamari on sauteed spinach, which was simple but delicious.  This was the highlight of my dinner!  Rigatoni with chicken and mushrooms was extremely creamy and rich - tasted good, but no standout flavors.   Finally, the Calo Special thin crust pizza was loaded with sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, and onions.  It had a crispy cookie-like crust and a generous amount of cheese. However, I would find ingredients clumped together and get a slice with all green peppers or just sausage. It tasted like typical pizza you could get anywhere else.",0.9892,0.75,0.211,0.038,0.5582857142857143

Calo did an absolutely AMAZING and FANTASTIC job and the reception was just amazing!!!  WE cannot begin to thank the Manager Saqib enough for everything. We reserved the party room back in May and he assured us everything would go off without a hitch and he was correct!!  The staff was amazing and the food was superb!! We ordered a large sampling of their appetizers, Bruschetta, Mozzarella sticks, Mediterranean Salad, Rotolo Di Melanzana, Fried Calamari, Buffalo Wings, Artichoke and Spinach Dip, Sausage and Peppers, Grilled Seafood Platter, and several Pizzas.   Saqib helped us in determining how many platters of each would be needed for the size of our party and made suggestions that they would only bring out as much as necessary and not overcharge or bring out more food than was needed for the reception. The staff did a great job of checking to make sure the food was in adequate supply and quickly brought out more when needed.  Our guests raved about the food and absolutely loved the sampling and choices available. We were very impressed with the amount of appetizers available at Calo and we were correct in deciding on this kind of reception instead of a sit down individual plated entree choices as we felt we were able to offer a wider variety of the food that Calo has to offer with the appetizer and cocktail reception choice. We had an open bar for the first two hours of the reception and the bartender did a great job of keeping our wedding coordinator appraised of the bar tab as we had requested. The bartender was great, she was very friendly to everyone. We highly recommend Calo for your wedding reception. Saqib the manager was great to work with and he and the staff definitely know how to plan the right amount of food for different sized parties. The party room is absolutely beautiful with a large full size bar and the floor to ceiling windows looking out onto Clark st open up in nice weather to allow fresh air into the room which is unique to most indoor reception venues.

We arrived a little later at night but were seated and ordered the Monday rib special. The food is good, just see my previous post. But they cannot get anything right the first time. Almost every time I have ordered for delivery or pickup over the last 2 years something is not right. Tonight there were a few things that were just inexcusable.       First when I finally got to eating my side of pasta I found my Marinara sauce was actually meat sauce. I wouldn't be upset except this is the SAME ERROR that happens every time we order delivery or carryout AND when I asked our waitress to switch it for pasta with marinara, she went back to the kitchen and told me, ""sorry the kitchen is closed for the night"". So I am now stuck with the WRONG order. Didn't eat my pasta. You served it to me wrong, and now your kitchen is closed so you cannot make it right.       Second was when our waitress took our order at about 9:45pm and my friend ordered a pitcher of beer and I ordered a bottle of cider she never mentioned that they were closing in well.... we still aren't sure when they close as there are no hours listed on the door, the menu or anywhere for that matter. But after she only drank about a third of her pitcher and asking the waitress when they close and her telling us whenever the last customer leaves they began to make it VERY CLEAR it was time for us to go. Lights turned up really bright, chairs being put on all tables but ours and all the t.v's turned off. Except, we hadn't received our check yet. So my friend paid for a $16 pitcher of beer. Wasn't allowed to finish it.  Calo, if you want to be an Italian restaurant know the Italian traditions. Make me feel like I'm at my aunties house.

The neighborhood itself is obviously great, because there are so many good places to eat, and it's just a cute area to begin with. With all the choices of restaurants, we end up at Calo everytime. First off, when you go to Calo, MAKE A RESERVATION. No matter what night you go, whether you are in a group, or if it's just a twosome, always make a reservation, because it's always packed.

Not to mention STRONG. -Calamari. It's real calamari. Not the crispy imitation rings you get at other places that claim to be calamari, but their really a pig's sphincter. LOL. I don't know how much of that is true, but I will say the calamari at Calo is tender, and very tasty. The best calamari I have ever had actually. -Pizza bread.

Almost upscale but all guests, and staff, are dressed in street clothes. Some of their hostesses are quite questionably dressed, it's kind of strange but that's OK, just saying.  Their pasta is pretty great. I wont call it authentic. I mean it's authentic American-Italian. Giant portions of pasta slathered in sauce with meat and veggies etc. My boyfriend and I have had quite the variety of pasta dishes here and they are all super super tasty. Their rigatoni con pollo e funghi is my favorite. Rigatoni with chicken and tons of mushrooms in super fat cream sauce, so delicious. A bit pricey for sure, could prob shave at least $2 off every dish on the menu. But you always get leftovers (and then when you take it home and warm it up the next day you get to see how all the oil has separated from the sauce, Oh yum!). They do a really good, quite large, Mediterranean salad. Plenty of greens, kalamata olives, very very tasty heirloom tomatoes, cucumber, feta, onion. I love it. I added chicken once, very good. This is my go to meal now because it's really hard not to fall into a severe depression after thinking about how many calories you must have consumed from their pasta dishes (but they are so gooooood).  We have not tried any steak, fish, seafood etc. Always pasta or salad. We split a small thin crust pizza once, I barely remember it. Not sure it's noteworthy but would try again. Apparently they have ribs here and apparently they are good. As I am currently on a HUGE BBQ kick I want to try their ribs. I'm sure they aren't as good as ones you can get at a real BBQ joint but maybe I'll be surprised. Lastly, they bring a nice basket of fresh bread to the table. Free bread!!! It's really quite good. French rolls and some sort of foccacia, tomato herb bread. Yes please.

Hard to even fathom but breaking it down over a 10 year period it's an accurate number.   Last night we sent back a pasta dish and told the owner the dish was not good. Instead of fixing the problem, the owner insulted us for not liking his food.  Last night's bill-including drinks at the bar before dinner-was about $170. The food cost on a meatless plate of pasta is about $5.00.  I explained to the owner that he was sacrificing all of his future business with us by behaving this way.  From an economic standpoint, wouldn't it have made more sense-either in the short term or the long term-to eat the $5.00 pasta cost rather than sling insults?  We spend a lot of money at restaurants in the Chicago area. Unfortunately we have already spent a great deal at Calo but we will surely not be back.",-0.7427,0.817,0.079,0.104,0.36686111111111114

2014-07-27,3.0,"I had eaten here before but didn't remember until I walked in the door and recognized the place.  That should have been my first clue about how I felt about the experience.  The decor is very cool and definitely nice for a date night or an evening out with friends, dark and candlelit but not so dark you can't see to have a good conversation.  The staff was very nice and we were seated right away.  We ordered some drinks.  I got a mojito, which may be a strange drink order for an italian restaurant but it's summer and I was in the mood for one.  The drink was not great.  It was strong so I'll give them that, but being past the point of wanting to drink just to get drunk, I actually prefer flavor to my drink.  All I could taste was the vodka.  No lime or mint or mixture of the two came through at all.   We ordered Calamari for our appetizer and it was delicious.  It was served with more of a cocktail sauce than a mariner sauce and I actually loved that.  It was a little bit sweet and spicy, not a typical cocktail sauce but something more original. I had cream of spinach soup and it was delicious as well.  Not too think and very flavorful without being heavy. For dinner I ordered the Chicken Francese.  I knew it would be a lot of chicken, it said it in the description, but holy cow was it a lot of chicken!  I was already full from the calamari and the soup and honest could have not even ordered dinner but I Love chicken Francese.  This one was not my favorite. My favorite thing about this dish is how light it is, thin chicken breasts in a lemon and white wine sauce but this one seemed heavy and there was too much batter.  The egg batter on it was way too thick and a little overcooked.  I had about 3 bites and was done.   The mashed potatoes were amazing! All in all, I would eat here again, but it would not be my first choice for italian.   I also think they should advertise it as family style or the wait staff should explain the giant portion sizes so you know what you are getting into.  We would have ordered differently if we had know.",0.9952,0.799,0.157,0.044,0.6147424684159378

2014-07-06,5.0,"The lasagna that I have had here reminds me of the pasta fresca that my grandmother used to make when I was a young child. She would take hours to make it the old-fashioned way with a rolling pin (no pasta machine), but in the end it was well worth the wait. Calo definitely knows how to make homemade pasta with lightness and a buttery texture. Its suave entry into my mouth was a deeply satisfying cohesion of pasta and sauce. It delivered a buoyant, palate-caressing richness of taste making for the perfect amalgamation! The calamari is incredibly tender and fresh with a crispy and light exterior. This is the only restaurant where I order calamari. Why? It's excellent. It's fresh. It's consistent. It's delectable. Simply the best. Period. If you are not in the mood for pasta, I highly recommend their pizza, which has a wonderful thin and crispy crust. The quality of cheese and toppings are worthy of five stars. Also, the gnocchi is heaven in a bowl... velvet-like cushions in every bite... a revelation in my tongue followed by a creaminess and a persistent taste that lingers around for a while. The gnocchi is light and delicate.  The best wine to pair with gnocchi is a central Italian one, such as, Trebbiano or Grecchetto with enough fruity, flowery and spicy aromas and is pleasant on the palate. We have an aunt who lives walking distance to this restaurant and have been more than 10 times over the years. We have always received excellent to very good service here. Depending upon your server it can be 4 to 5 stars. Plating receives 4-stars, while the cuisine receives 5-stars. The price-point is 4-stars. They have a fairly fantastic wine list (worthy of 5-stars). IF you are unsure about what kind of wine to order, please ask your Server. He/she will make recommendations for pairing wine with your meal. This is a great restaurant for a date or for catching up with friends. It is dark, romantic and cozy.  Parking: Park across the street for free. The parking lot is worked and watched by Calo employees so if you are not going to Calo's for lunch or dinner.  TIP: If you are seeking an authentic Italian restaurant that is not filled with ""tourists"" and interested in exploring one of Chicago's fun and interesting neighborhoods, then check it out. This restaurant is filled with Chicago locals, mostly from the area, but also from other parts of the city. The ""Swedish Bakery"" is across the street, and has been a staple, for over 50 years, in the ""Andersonville"" neighborhood.

Another favorite is the Gnocci Asiago. Veeery yummy, the sauce is amazing. I'm not usually a Gnocci fan, but a few bites of a friends dish and I think i'll have to try it again!

Cut the portion sizes in half (us Americans really don't need another reason to get fatter) and cut the prices in half.  I had broccoli with shrimp and fettuccine in a white wine, lemon, garlic sauce. It was $21. I could have made that exact dish for a dinner party and spent less.

My Wife and I had a few drinks at the bar and enjoyed mingling with the Andersonville locals. The bartenders were wonderful and they poured a generous drink but as much as I hate to say it, the food was disappointing.   After browsing through the menu I decided to go with the house specialty which is the Ribs. Maybe I'm used to a different kind of BBQ rib. Calo's Ribs were very small and kind of bland. There wasn't a heck of a lot of dry rub and the sauce was caked on. Maybe they were overcooked? Calo is a beautiful restaurant and the service was top notch, but the Ribs were a disappointment to say the least.   I'm more than willing to give Calo another shot. Maybe this is a case of me ordering the wrong thing. Based on the service and old world vibe, I would gladly go back. I just won't order the Ribs.",0.269,0.78,0.126,0.094,0.6056944444444445

I would probably come back again sometime, but there are many better Italian restaurants in the city. I don't think I would take out of town guests here. Parking - We arrived before 7pm and their somewhat large parking lot across the street was already filled. I'm sure the parking is a big draw due to the densely populated area and the number of seniors living in the neighborhood high rises along the lake. We found a close spot on the street that was free after 6pm so we were fine. Ambiance - The atmosphere was very nice, mood lighting with candles on the tables was relaxing. Our table was spacious for our party of three, and we were able to linger comfortably after our meal. Drinks - I'm more of a beer drinker so I can't comment on the wine and spirits. Calo's had only one beer on draft that was acceptable to me, but $5 for a pint of Three Floyd's Alpha King is a good deal. I think they had around 8 beers on draft. Food - A nice bread basket was presented immediately and included crusty French bread and a soft focaccia bread. I ordered the linguini carbonara which came with a decent house salad. Soup was also a option. It was very good and the portion was huge and I took more than half home. My dinner mates had the baby back ribs and the lasagna which were both average tasting.

If you're coming in for beer, they have a few standard selections but not a ton to choose from.  There's a decent wine list and they also have cocktails.

Located in the andersonville neighborhood, it was very busy and they do have a private lot available for parking but it was full when we got there and parking was a bit harder to find. What I found unusual was that they didn't have a valet service available. For such a bustling restaurant, I think that should be an option. Luckily I finally found parking a few blocks away.  We were seated and had drinks in our hands, pronto! We ordered the calamari (both friend and grilled). Both came out very delicious and not over done. The grilled calamari was my most favorite since it came with a bed of greens under it. They were succulent and seasoned perfectly. As a main entree I got the vodka cream penne with chicken and it was delicious and the portions are huge which I love because I have lunch for the next day. SWEET! My best friend had the rissotto and it was creamy and executed very well. I commend any chef that can cook a risotto because when I tried, it was a near disaster.  The pricing is in the moderate range but the quality of the food is well worth it. They have a full bar in a great neighborhood. The service was good even with a packed house.

Several friends recommended Calo and we just moved within walking distance so we decided to give it a try. I'm really glad we did. Our evening was excellent! To start we ordered the grilled calamari. The whole tubes--not sliced rings--were grilled perfectly and served atop a bed of sauteed spinach. The was the perfect way to start the meal. I could've ordered another plate of it and been satisfied to eat only calamari that night. Of course, then I would've missed out on the delicious minestrone soup. I only had a cup before my main course but it was so good that i considered ordering some more to go. I should have! For my main course I had the pappardelle with shrimp and mushrooms. My husband had the chicken saltimbocca. Both dishes were delicious and plentiful. We each took home enough to have lunch the next day. The pappardelle was fresh and cooked perfectly. The shrimp were huge and succulent. My husband's chicken was tender and juicy. Also, our waitress was very attentive and informative about the menu.

Our server, Sandy, was attentive, but not pushy. She gave us plenty of time to read the menu but not so long that we were left waiting for her to come back. She was wonderful. Two of us had one of the specials which was a pasta filled with gorgonzola and fig with a sage oil,and both of us agreed that it was PHENOMENAL. The other two in our party selected items off the regular menu and agreed they were outstanding. The portions are plentiful. We selected a wonderful bottle of merlot off of the special menu and it was great. I ordered a root beer beer on the special menu and didn't really care for it. I had never had one before and just didn't care for how sweet it was. The salad that came with the meal was standard but was very fresh tasting and we enjoyed them. One person in our party had the minestrone soup, which she had during a previous visit, and loved it. Our water glasses were constantly being filled, dishes cleared and more baskets of bread being served. The bread is also wonderful! I would like to hear a more traditional Italian music in the background, or something instrumental . There is a singer/songwriter type of music on, but it is not overwhelming. Over all, this is a great dining experience. We adored the food, the service was perfect and we would definitely return.

I of course still managed to enjoy the pappardelle con funghi (shitake, porcini and portobello mushrooms with chicken and a hint of white truffle oil). The pasta was just the right texture and the sauce rich and creamy. And I'm not exaggerating folks when I say the leftovers fed me for a full 1.5 meals.

After two glasses of wine, one martini, and two entrees, our bill was only about $55 (before tip). Maybe that's why they were bustling! What was not impressive was the service and the food. It's not as if either was bad - just not good. Our server did her job. She took our order, brought our drinks and food, and delivered the bill. She was not coquettish or personable. In fact, she was a bit slow in her initial visit to our table, but was adequate in timeliness after that. M got the Rapini E Salsiccia pizza and I got the Gnocchi Gorgonzola which came with a cup of Split Pea Soup. I loved the soup! M liked my gnocchi whereas I wasn't a fan. Neither of us liked her pizza. I thought the bottom of the crust tasted burnt and she didn't like the broccoli (rapini). I liked the flavor of the broccoli but I couldn't bite through it on the pizza. The texture was chewy and whole pieces would come away from the rest of the slice when I took a bite. M was satisfied with her wine and my peach martini was okay. It was a little too syrupy sweet for me.

We asked for extras multiple times and they kindly obliged. The fried calamari makes for a good starter dish and the 6 of us were able to share one order.  The gnocchi gorgonzola was good as well, just not what I was expecting. I was expecting a more traditional gnocchi but this one came stuffed with gorgonzola cheese, I asked for vodka sauce and they had no problem with the substitution. Not bad, just different. I don't think there was any potato in this dish, although on the menu there claimed to be. The caprese salad was fresh and on par with others I've tried. The salad was huge though, definitely share-worthy.  Overall, great experience and traditional Italian fare. The staff was courteous and efficient, the food was hot and fresh.

Calo has been around forever (and by forever, I mean fifty years), long before Andersonville was a hot and happnin' neighborhood. Its staying power in a town where restaurants open and close in just a couple years' time speaks volumes. There's a good reason it's been a mainstay in Chicago. The food is reliably good and the ingredients are always fresh. The portions are generous, and the prices are reasonable. Even if you're not a huge fan of Italian food, you'd be hard-pressed not to find something to whet your whistle; there's truly something for everybody on the menu. You can't go wrong with any of their pizzas (pan, Neopolitan, thin, stuffed!), and the calamari (they serve both fried and grilled versions) is above average as well. There's a plethora of pasta dishes from which to choose, as well as a number of meat and seafood items (including Alaskan king crab legs!). Everything is executed well. As if Calo didn't have enough going for it, they serve until 11 pm, they also offer carry-out and delivery, accept reservations, and there's a free parking lot across the street.

I had the lasagna and it was some of the best I've had. they also gave us enough bread to stand as its' own meal. everyone was happy. My second experience was less thrilling. I decided to try their thin-crust pizza since it's labeled on their menu as some of the best in the city. I called and they said it'd be a half our. 15 minutes later I was out the door. I'm only a 5-minute walk away, but I'm the kind of person who likes to get their food fresh out of the oven. When I got there, sure enough the pizza was ready. Another 5 minute walk home and I opened up the pizza to find it... cold. At best it was lukewarm. I had to eat the middle pieces because of how dried-out the crust ones were. I'm not sure what happened, but I wasn't thrilled. If we go again, I'll stick to the entrees. Three and a half stars rounded up to four, I suppose.",0.9786,0.83,0.148,0.022,0.5315462315462315

Tried  the cappuccino panna cotta - pricey at $7.95 - but DELISH last night had the Chicken Piccante - in a lemon caper mushroom sauce - it was very good - 3 nice breasts of chicken. You never leave hungry with the portions - and they arent just a pile of junky food - the bummer was choice of sides. potato or pasta. No substitutions allowed... but $5.95 for a side of spinach? C'mon guys. It really shouldnt be that hard to get some fresh veggies. You want to charge me - Ok - but anything more than $3.00 when I am already spending $18-20 ... that borders on ridiculous. I heard it happen at another table when we were there - and the couple were about to leave. Some of the waitresses are very apologetic - but some are numb to it so their explanation is a bit harsh.

2013-02-16,3.0,"Last evening (Friday) my husband and I excitedly went to Calo after I had seen it featured to rave reviews on the show Check, Please the weekend prior. We had a reservation and were seated promptly. Our waiter, who was obviously from the motherland, was fun, friendly & very attentive. We started w/ the Scampi De Jonge, fried mozzarella & sautéed black mussels in white wine sauce ...  The cheese arrived first in a square form that was lightly breaded & fried. Dressed w/ the house marinara, it was definitely a step up from the fried sticks variety at popular chain restaurants. The marinara was more acidic than sweet (I prefer the latter), but tasted fresh and not overly seasoned. The mussels arrived next and blew me away. They were plump & plentiful and the wine sauce was more of a broth which I happily soaked chunks of focaccia in! My husband ate a couple that were a little more pungent than he would've liked, but I ate one as well and didn't find it SO off putting. The scampi - my most antipated selection - arrived last! The diners on Check, Please had sung such praises about it, but I didn't get why. It was just okay. The shrimp was a bit tough and I kept asking myself, 'Where's the garlic???' By far, the mussels saved the appetizer course & I'd go back for those in a minute. Alrighty then ... Entrees!   We were already near full from 3 apps, an endless supply of spongy-buttery focaccia, Matilda's & French martinis, but in we dove. We ordered a meat/pasta dish and a veggie dish to share w/each other. Their Ziti Molese boasted a house made Italian sausage which was abundant throughout the ziti in large crumbles. The sauce was sweeter like I like it and it was a large enough portion to have leftovers to share, and I swear it tasted even better re-warmed the next morning! Our second dish was an eggplant rolled & stuffed w/ricotta. The menu didn't say it'd be fried (I assumed it'd be grilled), but it was. It was fried so delicately though, that it didn't feel too heavy, which was our goal after all the food we'd ordered - something light. The cheese stuffing was a tad dry, but flavorful. Picking in it cold just now, it too is delicious next-day.  Despite wrapping most of our entrees to go, I still felt I'd bust. That's when the waiter returned w/tiramisu on the house! I had announced at the start of our dinner that we were first timers & visiting thanks to the Check, Please episode. Since I didn't want to be rude (lol), I dug deep & found room for this SO delicious dessert! My husband doesn't drink coffee or appreciate it's essence in desserts, but even he nodded in agreement that this was something special. Light. Airy. Sweet, but not too sweet ... Yum, yum, yum!  So here's the recap: 3 apps (2 good, 1 eh), 2 Matilda's, 1 French martini, 2 entrees (good, not AMAZING - which included soup or salad) & 1 comp'ed tiramisu ... $90 before tip & good enough to warrant a repeat visit.",0.9982,0.792,0.185,0.023,0.5083858543417366

Service is prompt and servers are pretty knowledgeable. But I never look forward to going back - everything is just okay and nothing more. Nothing is particularly excellent or memorable.

Now the food; I was impressed with the bread given at the beginning of the meal. We got pizza bread!! It was yummy and free! I've never been to a restaurant that gives you pizza bread in the bread basket.  Apparently the ribs at this place are a huge hit, however I don't like ribs so I passed on that.

The woman I was speaking to put me on hold. When she came back she told me that they would send a driver to pick up the remnants of the pizza and then credit my credit card. When I asked if the driver would take an hour and a half to get here, she just chuckled. I told her that if they really needed the used pizza I'd put it out side of my door as I really didn't want any company tonight. As I said, I've been ordering from Calo forever.

One of my dining friend's asks is there another IPA type of beer you can recommend? Server chops at the air with her hand while snapping- ""I told you there is NO BEER! There is no IPA!!! Unfortunately this set the tone for our service for the rest of the night. Every time she came to the table you could feel her resentment of us, we were afraid she was going to snap on us.

I reluctantly decided to try a piece because the Italian bread looked boring....sweet jesus am I glad I did. Light as air, crispy on the bottom, tomato goodness on top. You've made me a believer Calo. Everything, literally everything on the menu sounded so good. It was sooo hard to decide, but angry server was rolling her eyes so hard I thought they were never going to stop. I ordered the something Italia- shrimp, broccoli, linguini, garlic, wine and olive oil. Pasta-cooked perfect. Shrimp- huge, lots of them.

Plus, they serve a mean grilled calamari--four big pieces marinated and cooked to perfection, served atop some steamed spinach.  Their mediterranean salad is basic but good; however, recently we got their caesar salad for delivery and it was a major downer--anemic lettuce that didn't resemble romaine, plus a sparse few grape tomatoes and oily croutons.

If not the ribs for when I am super hungry than it's the eggplant dish.

2011-11-22,5.0,"BOOKMARK THIS PLACE....to try...over....and.....over. Calo's is one of my favorite restaurants. It's one of the reasons I come to Andersonville. Intimate dinners, dinner with friends, dinner with family...I love coming to Calo's for dinner.  Sure, I could come here for lunch...but my memorable meals at Calo's usually result in blissful food comas. Dimly lit and very spacious...the place is divided up into two main areas: The bar area, which also has high tables and booths...and the dining room which has plenty of dining tables and more booths. There's also a private dining area for large reserved parties.   They have a great drink selection here. I like to wash down my food with Boddington's pub ale or Birra Moretti's La Rossa (I dare you to find another restaurant that has both these beers). They have an ample wine selection of course and a great selection of martinis. I've had their Snickers Martini & their Creme Brulee Martini and I'm not ashamed. Both were good. -It always begins with the free warm focaccia bread they bring out...which almost tastes like a pizza. This bread is so good I don't even know why they put that other bread in the same basket. If you find that your bread basket is out of the fabulous focaccia, fear not...they will gladly restock your focaccia upon request. Oh, and those aren't scoops of ice cream that come with it...that's butter. While the focaccia bread is buttery enough, I'm a big fan of overkill. -I highly recommend starting with the Cozze alla Crema: black mussels sautéed with scallions in a creamy chardonnay wine sauce. These mussels aren't your average mussels...they are on steroids. (I uploaded a photo for you non-believers)  If you find yourself using the spoon to devour that sauce, don't be embarrassed. It's not uncommon. It's so good that I've had this ""appetizer"" as a meal. I've planned meals at Calo's specifically because I was craving these mussels. Pizza & pasta? Pffft. Mussels. All. Day.  -Pasta? Order the Ziti al Vodka: ziti pasta tossed with grilled chicken, green peas and sun dried tomatoes in a vodka tomato cream basil sauce. You seriously can't go wrong with this dish. The sauce is bomb-diggity, the chicken is grilled perfectly, and the portion is rediculously awesome.  Other meal alternatives include their ribs! The ribs here are fall-off-the-bone. Get the ribs with a side of garlic-mashed and it's game over! Better yet, get the side of garlic-mashed no matter what you order.  ***If you left room for dessert, finish your meal off with their homemade Tiramisu.  WARNING: It is probably the best tiramisu you'll ever have. You may want to order your own. Relationships have ended over the last bite.  When you arrive there is a free private parking lot across the street next to the bakery if you don't want to park on the street.

2011-11-02,4.0,"It's about time I reviewed Calo. The first time I went here was in '97 or '98. My friends and I stumbled upon it while searching for the Neo-Futurarium. Back in the day, Calo had a live band that featured a female vocalist in a one-piece pantsuit, as well as a Casio synthesizer (maybe more than one). I can't remember what the food was like, but I got really into the band... Before I moved to Andersonville, I ordered thin crust pizza (the Chicago special) from Calo all the time. It's really good. Since I moved to the hood about 5 years ago, I regularly frequent Calo. Since 1997, the restaurant has undergone several upgrades. Most notably (and somewhat sadly), they have reinvented the bar area, and it no longer has space for the Casio keyboard band. For most people, this is probably for the better. Calo has really good food. The asiago gnocchi is extraordinary. One of my friends and I refer to the gnocchi as ""pillows' because they are light and airy (unlike traditional gnocchi, which is dough-y and heavy). The asiago version used to be a special but is now a regular menu entree. They also have a gorgonzola version, but I swear by the asiago. So good! Calo also has an extensive spirits selection. They have some really lovely cocktails. I love the raspberry martinis, but I'd stay away from the basil one. It had a strong anise undertone and kind of tasted like detergent. Go to Calo.

I want to give them five stars but honestly Calo's food is merely good, not mind-blowing or the ""best"" Italian in the city.  It's not even the best Italian in the neighborhood (the place across the street gets that honor).  But it is always a reliable, pleasant and enjoyable (if busy) place to go out for dinner, either with a date or with a crowd.",0.976,0.802,0.168,0.03,0.4663287250384026
2011-09-07,4.0,"This was my second time at Calo.  My second visit was late night after a trying day. I wanted some yummy and filling food around the way. I walked in about 7:30pm and was seated promptly for one...yay! I was scared it would be packed. I stayed with the water, but the bread in the meantime was a varied selection of white bread and a pizza-baked item with butter. House salad was nothing to rave about. My entree was the ROTOLO DI PESCE, colorful pasta with shrimp, cheese and crab meat. It was tasty and very filling with a great presentation. It was served as two big rolls that I could only get to one.   After getting my entree packed to go, I asked for the HOMEMADE TIRAMISU, which was ok. I'm really not into tiramisu, tho. I just needed something sweet without being chocolate cake. I was overall happy with this visit and can't wait for dinner today to get back to the second roll of the rotolo.  Quickly, The first time to Calo, I went with the hubby after a mentor of mine recommended the place . We loved it! I had the cheese ravioli that time, which was very taste and a big dish. The had wine, which he enjoyed as a random wine-drinker. We had a great time and thought it was a good 'date' restaurant that was OK for the price. Service is always good and prompt.

I can't remember their salads. I enjoy their garlic bread and love their stuffed pizza. The best thing I've had though was some special called sacchetti or something. It was almost like cheese ravioli, except shaped like little purses, and it had peas and a buttery sauce on it. I thought it was phenomenal.

They have regular bread as well as something I can only describe as pizza bread. YUM!  Each main dish came with soup or salad and we all chose to have the cream of mushroom soup. This was an EXCELLENT decision. The soup was clearly homemade, with the mushrooms freshly cut and the soup was clearly made with real cream. The flavoring was spot on and amazing. For my main course I had the lobster ravioli with mushroom, asparagus and sun dried tomato cream sauce. The ravioli were clearly house made, none looked exactly alike and the filling in each was fresh well cooked lobster meat. The lobster was perfectly cooked, not in any way chewy and was well flavored. The sauce was excellent and although i was hesitant about all of the ingredients, they all went very well together. My wine was chilled to the right temperature and my parents liked their drinks, they were large and poured well. They also loved their main course. My dad had linguini with clams, which was delicious and had just the right balance of garlic. My mother had gnocchi with red sauce.

I went in the late morning as I was just gonna slowly work down a pie over the next two days. I made sure to stick with the thin crust and went with prosciutto, garlic, and onions. It took about 15 minutes and I was on my way.  The pizza was extremely good and held up to my memory. On top of that the people there were extremely nice too.

Comfortable, relaxing, classy. One caveat, the candles are fake!  The service averages out to good. On my most recent visit our server was rather absent later in the meal, but at leas the bus staff was attentive so we didn't feel totally neglected.  The menu is extensive. Surely there is something for everyone. And they seem to have some good specials too, so there's always something new to try! I've been pleased with each of my meals there. Not like blissful ""OMG BEST FOOD EVAR!!1""! pleased, but it's above average. The prices seem a touch high at first. However, two things to consider: 1) Most entrees come with a soup or salad, for which many places will charge you another $3-4. And 2)The portion sizes are quite generous. If you eat a little of the free bread (and the focaccia is quite good) you could probably make two meals out of most entrees there. Those things considered, I think the prices are reasonable.

My party got there around 9ish and had to wait about 15 minutes to get seated. Which was good for me because I found out they served DT( delirium tremens). God I love that stuff! Once seated, I looked over the menu and wanted so badly to try the ROTOLO DI MELANZANA but once I saw veal on the menu i shifted my focus on that dish. I ordered the VITELLO CARCIOFI which was veal medallions sautéed with artichoke hearts, mushrooms, tomatoes and onions in a white wine sauce.  Obviously bread is given first which I think was the best part of my entire meal. That Focaccia bread was insanely good. I must of had 6 large pieces of this God given bread. Moving on with my meal, I went with the clam chowder which is what I always pick as a soup because im obsessed with it. Ever since going to Fisherman's Wharf in SF, I have been trying to find a place that could compare. But that's a whole other story. Calo was good but lacked the spice I was looking for. I asked for cayenne but gave me Tabasco instead. Made it a little better but not the taste I was going for. On to my entree, veal was overdone. Not crazy overdone but was probably left in the pan just a little longer than it should be. Artichoke hearts were good, sauce was ok but on the buttery side. At the end they had brought out a birthday tiramisu cake which was damn good. Thanks to the Calo and my friends for that one.  Over all my meal was good, but i would definitely give this place another try. 3 stars seems a little low for all the great reviews I had read about this place but that's my two cents.

If that's all I had to eat I would have been more than satisfied. I'm not sure specifically what salad we got, but it was on top a piece of bread(a crostinni I believe). It was good but it was way big-we easily split it between the 4 of us and it was still a lot. Then the pizzas came. The thin crust was very tasty-the flavors of the cheese, sauce and crust all blended and complimented each other very well. The stuffed crust was really good too but I could only have a slice otherwise I think I would have gotten sick of it. We definitely had some leftover pizza afterwards. The meal was definitely filling, but it was some seriously good, tasty Italian food and I could recommend this place in a heartbeat to anyone.

We've also been very happy with their linguini in clam sauce, the buccatini con pomodoro (really tasted fresh and light and delicious, though I'm sure it added about 3 inches to my waistline), and the pasta alla Milano.   My only negatives would be I think they're a bit pricey (maybe more worth it when dining in if the atmosphere is really nice), and the majority of the pastas had meat in them (though they may be available without meat).

Our water glasses were topped off regularly, and dirty dishes were picked up quickly, but not so quickly that we felt rushed. Everything was paced well. The restaurant itself is beautiful. I understand that the old Calo was remodelled several years ago into the place it is today. Whoever the designer was, they did a terrific job. The lighting is low and intimate, but there is still enough light that you can read the menu without a flashlight. I appreciate that. Again, everything just right.

We decided to order from here because I have a cousin visiting from Poland who wanted to try some Chicago pizza.  Because we needed it delivered, we couldn't get it from my favorite, Pequod's, so I looked for some reasonable alternatives.  Calo was very highly rated, so we decided to go with them.  And, like I said, the pizza was good.  The service left something to be desired, though.  I don't think my order was overly complicated.  I wanted a pizza that had mushrooms, green pepper, and onion on the whole pie, and pepperoni on half of it.  I went over this with the woman taking my order over the phone about five times to double check.  It was really important because at least two of the people eating the pizza were vegetarians who didn't want pepperoni or any kind of meat touching their pizza.  The woman taking my order was, somewhat understandably, getting a little annoyed that I was triple and quadruple checking this, but, like I said, it was important.  Did I mention that this woman wasn't particularly nice to begin with?  But, whatever, if the food was going to be good, it wouldn't matter. So, about 45 minutes or so later, we got the pizza.  And it was really good.  But it had sausage on it.  All of it.  To be fair, it also had all the other toppings, but the sausage made it inedible to the vegetarians.  If you're going to have an attitude about the way I'm ordering, at least get my order right.",0.9876,0.835,0.131,0.033,0.5921235119047619

Nonetheless, I can recommend the pasta dishes and can say that the portions are large and filling and they are generally good.  However, the olive oil based sauces are not so exciting.  I prefer the cream based even though they are quite heavy.

Reheated the chicken and ribs for me and my Honey.  You get a choice of two sides with this, I got the cole slaw and pasta with olive oil (not offered on the menu, but I asked).  The cole slaw was pretty good, I have to admit (!?!) I'm a bit of a slaw snob, being that my Mom makes the best and all.  Creamy, flavorful and not too vinegary, very nice.  Fried chicken was good enough, salty and re crisped nicely in the oven.  My Honey loved the ribs, he let me have one and I must agree, they're pretty tasty.   Calo will always have a place in m heart for saving this girl from dayafterdom:-)",0.9967,0.722,0.264,0.014,0.7089841269841269

The steamed mussels in red sauce were DIVINE!!!  Hot, tender, tasty, the sauce not overbearing the seafood.  We ate every single one and then sopped up the remaining sauce with the bread.  YUMMMM!!!! Next came minestrone soup (for my partner) and salad with balsamic vinaigrette for me.  Love that the salad comes on a cold plate and the salad was very fresh & crisp and tasty!  Partner totally enjoyed the soup.   Now on to wonderfulness - my pillows of heaven (asiago this time) and lamb chops for my partner.  We shared both and both were just amazing in both presentation, taste, temperature, etc.    And last on the list - dessert.  Obviously after that big meal, there wasn't room for much else but I need something ""clean"" - perfect answer:  Italian Lemonade (really a lemon ice).  Slightly sweet & tart .. perfecto!   Juan, our waiter, was absolutely the best - so attentive, we never had to wait for anything.  As I said, it was a really busy night but he managed to keep up with our needs as well as what seemed like a 1/4 of the main restaurant.  The manager came over & introduced himself about half way through the main course and inquired how things were.  It was my partner's first time there so he got a little more attention.  Manager (can't remember his name damnit!) was very nice & actually came over one more time right when we were ready to go. I would recommend this place to anyone that is going to be in the Andersonville area.  It's prices are reasonable and the ambience and service as well as the food are worth every penny!   Enjoy!",0.999,0.8,0.2,0.0,0.4647435897435896

2009-10-11,5.0,"I've lived in Andersonville for over a year now and have heard so many people heaping praise on Calo that I decided it was finally time to check it out. Went on a Saturday night and made the mistake of not making a reservation, so we waited an hour. The bar was packed, so I just got a drink and we hovered wherever we could find room. It was a little claustrophobic, but I guess that's to be expected. To start, the bread was freaking fantastic. I'm not one to rave about a bread basket, but this was probably one of the best bread baskets I have ever encountered. Warm, fluffy focaccia bread, deliciously seasoned white crusty bread, and a huge mountain of salty whipped butter. Yum. That was worth the wait alone. We got the mussels as an appetizer, which were to die for. I've just started eating mussels, but they were amazing by even general food standards, and my boyfriend (the mussel expert) loved them. Huge amounts of meat with tons of garlic and wine cream sauce. I got some sort of chicken piccata-like item that was on special. Chicken piccata is probably one of my favorite Italian dishes, and this was a good one. The chicken was thicker than most piccata dishes have it, but it was soft and juicy and my knife ran through it like butter. Boyfriend had the gnocchi with asiago and goat cheese, which he said was great. One other reason I liked this place: the service was impeccable. The hostesses were friendly despite the overwhelming crowds, our server was always there for anything we needed and made sure to check in with us any time he passed by, and water was refilled quickly. This was really great to see in a crowded restaurant in Chicago on a Saturday night, where poor service is so common anymore. It was a little pricey, but for the portion sizes and quality of the food, I think it's just about worth it. I'm so glad I finally tried this place.",0.9967,0.752,0.204,0.044,0.6240321331784747

I stuck with the traditional Lasagna which was great. The menu is full of enticing combinations of pasta and chicken and seafood and veggies, and sauces. I could not make up my mind.  I love the clubby atmosphere. One of our group was unhappy with the service, since the waiter, who was right off the boat from Naples, never returned to the table to refresh drink orders.

Some of their food is good (ribs, pizza) and some of their food is pretty boring tasting (spaghetti).  My favorite thing is actually the foccacia bread served with your meal and their creamy garlic dressing. There's really not room for appetizers or dessert because of this. The new-ish renovation is nice, and the interior is now updated and more modern.  Anyway, it's a neighborhood joint that attracts an older crowd who come for the weekly specials.

With the exception of the thin crust pizza(as pizza that's extra greasy isn't my normal style, but tolerate it once in a great while), the majority of food I've had here over the years has been great.

I'm also a very big fan of the BBQ ribs, and the sauce that comes with it is so good, that it makes me wanna track down the chef to get the recipe for it! Unfortunately, their BBQ rib special is no longer $10(likely because of rising food prices), but they still have it at $13 from time to time.

2008-08-22,4.0,"4 1/2 stars I've been holding back a little bit on my review of Calo because it has a very deep, soft spot in my heart. Calo was on of my first nights out when I moved to Chicago. My new neighbor, looking back, was trying to woo me and taking me to Calo was a bold, calculated move, if not completely effective; nonetheless, I was wooed by the restaurant, the staff, the décor and most importantly, the food. Calo was where I learned that I like octopus, marinated and grilled that was perfectly piquant and smoky. The octopus itself was remarkably tender; if I'd closed my eyes I might have sworn I was eating chicken, but there was a taste to it that wasn't anywhere near the ubiquitous taste of chicken. Fried squid is another Calo favorite. These people know how to treat rubber bands so that they are the farthest thing from rubber bands. You'd be wise to take advantage here, you just never know where you might run into octopus or squid and how extremely disappointed you might be. That's not the case at Calo. The Rotolo di Mozzarella is a can't miss: fresh mozzarella rolled with prosciutto, served with plum tomato, basil, the best balsamic and just the right touch of garlic and extra virgin olive oil. If you want to cure what ails you, opt for Fried mozzarella, served with Calo's light but flavorful Marinara. And if you want to throw down old school, you have to try their version of Shrimp De Jonghe. I don't know any other place in Chicago that sells this classic dish. Minestrone is worthy any great-great Italian grandmother; or check out the soup of the day, always with an Italian bend to it. Stand out salads include the Smoked Braid Salad and the Mediterranean salad. The Smoked Braid start with smoked mozzarella as the base and arugula, prosciutto, grape tomatoes, and Italian vinaigrette expertly portioned on top; a garlic crostini accompanies. The Mediterranean is leaf-less, nothing gets in the way of this mix of classic Mediterranean vegetables in vinaigrette. Ribs are a specialty, and with good reason: they're crack-tastic. Rotolo di Melanzana, eggplant stuffed and rolled, is a personal favorite as are their outstanding Center Cut Pork Chops, perfectly season and grilled to nirvana. Entrées include your choice of soup, salad, pasta or potato; if I haven't already had salad or pasta, I might choose one here, but otherwise I love how the treat the spud at Calo. Whatever they do, they bring out the best of the potato and I want lessons. The Zuppa di Pesce [fish soup] is an Italian version of Boullibaise and better than many Boullibaise dishes you can find in and around town. Shrimp De Jonghe moves from the appetizer menu to a full on Entrée; this rich shrimp and spinach dish is not only delicious, it is incredibly rich in iron and protein. Be sure to ask about the fresh fish of the day. Scallops on Farfalle is wonderful due in part to the light basil cream sauce, and Lobster Ravioli is an indulgent and luxe dish punctuated by my favorite, sun-dried tomato. If you're a gnocchi fan you have at least 3 to choose from a Calo, it's hard to go wrong. Soft pillows of potato dough, perfectly cooked and expertly sauced, my favorite is the marina where the gnocchi are paired with friends pancetta and Parmesan. The rest of the menu is punctuated with Italian American classic like lasagna and a bevy of risottos. You can't miss, but opt for one of Calo's many specials and save the pastas for the kiddies. I've never had lunch here, I've never ordered pizza for delivery from here, Calo has always been a destination restaurant for a great Italian dinner from people who care about you and the food they serve.

2008-08-04,4.0,"I'm told Calo has been around for a VERY long time (an old woman I was chatting with on the Clark bus actually told me this), and I can certainly see why.  The weekend dinner crowd is decidedly...older (you could almost mistake yourself for being in the suburbs from the looks of the clientele), but for good, simple Italian food at a reasonable price and a great dirty martini, you can't find a better place in Andersonville (or I'd venture to say the Northside). The atmosphere is fine, nothing too special; and the service can be a little slow, but they had a singer crooning some good tunes (think Frank Sinatra and Cole Porter) that livened things up a bit.  The food is heartily portioned, and all entrees come with soup or salad, a perk that seems to be dying out in most good restaurants.  I had the ziti alla vodka -- the sauce was fantastic and packed with sun dried tomatoes and chicken and basil.  And enough food for three meals.  My fiance had the carbonara, which wouldn't be my pick, but it was rich and creamy goodness with crispy bacon.  Our friend had the gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce which he seemed to love -- he was the only one to clean his plate! Calo is a fantastic place to take visiting parents, and I imagine it would be great for large groups as well -- I've often seen large parties there.  Parking lot across the street makes for extra convenience, though parking in Andersonville never seems to be a huge problem (and I should know, I park there every day).  For us, it was a nice meal on a Friday evening before hitting the bar scene.

Even Nana enjoys the fair- feasting on the linguini with clam sauce, while Papa enjoys the Rigatoni ala Barrese (spicy red sauce with sausage and peppers).

After making my way thru the bread basket (so much for that light lunch) I ordered the grilled calamari from the lunch specials menu.  This meal, which I believe was supposed to be an appetizer also came with a soup and a side of pasta. All that for just about $12.  Hello...good deal!  And the meals of my 3 dining companions also came with soup or salad and a side of pasta. Where has Calo been all my life during very hungry times? Not the best grilled calamari I've had, but pretty good. I also enjoyed my minestrone soup and the pasta was a nice treat being the carboholic that I am.

2008-07-22,4.0,"Last week, my husband and I were really busy with work and being in a wedding the weekend before, we hadn't had a chance to go grocery shopping. I think our cupboards were more bare than Old Mother Hubbard's. So we had ordered thai the night before and we were looking for another and hopefully new delivery option. And it's slightly more tricky because I'm a vegetarian.  So I trusted my fellow yelpers to help me out. I searched around and came across Calo's. They have such a large and pretty diverse menu that I knew I could find something very easily to please the taste buds. And it just so happened, their special of the day was baked lasagna, meat or veggie for 8.50. Now if anyone has ever attempted to make lasagna, you'll know it's sort of a pain in the butt. So any chance I can get to eat lasagna without having to make it, I'll take it. Just call me Garfield. (If you didn't get that reference, than you didn't watch enough quality tv when you were younger! :0) ) According other Yelpers, the delivery was fast and the food always comes to your door pipping hot. And duh, of course the Yelpers were right on both accounts. It was burning hot actually. Like burnt my hand when I pulled it out of the bag hot.  But it didn't matter because the taste of the lasagna would have made up for third degree burns. It was SO yummy-tons of flavor, just the right amount of cheese, sauce and spinach together. And the portion was enough to fill up any fat cat. But I knew better, and saved more than half for a meal the next day. And it was just as tasty!  My hubby had the Italian beef sandwich w/fries and it was ridiculously massive too. It was quite comical watching him try to eat that thing. It blows any sandwich shop's attempt right out of the water. And it was only 6.95. An excellent deal.  The only thing I would say isn't fantastic is their bread. It's so so. Not crusty or soft, sort of chewy and there wasn't any flavor to it. Oh and we also had a salad to split, the Mediterranean, and it was huge and delicious and also was another meal the next day.  All in all, great food experience. Next we will have to experience eating in at Calo's.

2008-06-14,4.0,"I grew up in what is now known as ""Andersonville."" Calo was the place I went to on Friday nights or whenever all the people from my parish got together for a ""fancy"" dinner. I would dance on the disco dance floor, get all the cherries from the bar I wanted, and sugared up on kitty cocktails till my parents fought over the bill with their friends and I passed out in one of the plush leather booths. It was dark enough to make anyone think it was nap time. Those were the good old days.  So now they are all ""fancy pants"" and no live entertainment. Soooo I kind of refuse to go in there. HOWEVER.... Last night I ordered from their take out menu, which happens to be almost the exact same as before the renovation. I was really in the mood for BBQ, and after a not so good 1/2 slab from Fireside on Ravenswood, I needed to go elsewhere. I ordered the fried chicken/bbq ribs combo with minestrone and a baked potato. I also ordered Tiramisu. The bbq ribs were so much better than I remember- the meat was tender and fell off the bone. The sauce was tangy, and the temperature was perfect. Definitely not the most amazing ribs ever, but really hit the spot. The fried chicken was so tasty... the only problem I have is that the 2 pieces I got was a breast and a leg, and I *hate* legs, but no big deal, I was only eating half of the meal anyway, since it was rather.... ummm... large. The fried chicken isn't crispy, it's more tasty batter skin- it's got a lot of spices. The bake potato was great, fluffy and full. I got all the condiments I asked for, and the packaging was done nicely. I ordered it at 9 and they said ""in an hour"") and it arrived at 9:50. The delivery guy was very nice. It was a bit expensive, (came out to $30 with tip) but I saved half of the food.  My one complaint with the food was Tiramisu, it was frozen. The edges were fine but the middle was not thawed, so I only had a few bites and it's in the fridge for later. It was also not the best Tiramisu I've had (that honor goes to Leona's).

Or, you might have a younger, nervous guy who forgets stuff and is frazzled over small things, but lovable just the same. I've never had really good service here, sadly. The pasta could be delicious and satisfying. Or, it could be flavorless/too soft and not authentic.  Desserts are ok. Some good, some a tad bland, nothing not good. The bar is usually just ok. Mixed drinks seem to be watery, or crazy strong. So why do I still give it 4 stars? When it's good, it's good. And even the uneven service is ok with me.

I like the atmosphere most of the time, I like that it's been there forever and after 10+ years of coming and going, I will keep giving it another try I 'spose.",0.8963,0.711,0.164,0.125,0.5441666666666666
2007-06-15,4.0,"Calo and I have had an on again-off again relationship. When I first moved to Andersonville, oxty-nine years ago (as my mother would say), it was a very Sopranos-y kind of joint. Early 60s supper club, heavy booths, older crowd, fair share of goombahs. Good food, big portions, dirt cheap. Nice. Then, in 2000 (I was surprised to discover it was this long ago), Calo went upscale and split off a portion of the restaurant as Finestra di Calo. Finestra was a big deal for about a year or so. I was never a big fan. It was ambitious, but I suspect they had the same kitchen staff turning out meat lasagna and veal scaloppini, and I'll give you one guess which one didn't turn out so well. Time passes, shit happens (I suspect the chef left), and Finestra get reabsorbed into Calo. But now Calo realizes they can raise their prices on everything if they do a quick remodeling job. ""Same great food, new high prices."" I lost the love. Okay, this is a simplification, but you get the point. Well I'm happy to report that Calo has found their way again. The new look is still supper club, but both more modern and a bit more traditional. High ceilings, burnished wood, high gloss floor, exposed brick, tall front windows. Three separate dining areas, one with a bar, one (the old Finestra space) which is open on weekends and for private parties. The service is great, with friendly servers, and active and organized bussers. (Bus service can make or break you.) The menu has settled down into a combination of old favorites and some more upscale dishes. They had me at the grilled octopus. If that's too extravagant, there's always the caprese salad or the baked clams. Pastas range from spaghetti and meatballs to farfalle with scallops in a basil cream sauce. They have gnocchi and risotto, and usually a special of one or both. I think their thin crust pizza is the best of their pizza choices, and they do a decent pie. And yes, they still serve the veal. Come early on a weeknight and you're likely to be surrounded by regulars eating the BBQ ribs special. The ribs are nothing special, but they're a steal at 10 bucks Mon-Thurs. The rest of the food ain't that cheap, but it's reasonable. I'm happy to have found my love for Calo. For a while there, it looked like the newcomers might squeeze out the regulars, and for a place like this, that's too bad. Last night, I heard a woman tell the managers that she had been coming to Calo since her mother brought her there as a child. There were two older women sitting at the next table who were on their regular night out. That's the atmosphere at Calo, and it has survived the renovation.",0.9973,0.77,0.18,0.05,0.4997364764864766

I am not the biggest fan of pasta and only marginally interested in most other Italian food , so take that into account. I ordered the chicken parm , which did nothing to garner a reaction , either good or bad , it was ok. I also got the Chicken Vesuvio , this one was a boneless breast (I prefer the bone in skin on kind) , and again it was ok , nothing exciting. The linguine with red clam sauce was pretty good , the baked clams my favorite thing there and the fried calamari ... OK to a little overcooked (i ordered it a few times , and the results were inconsistent. When we ordered the pizza , I neither objected nor was I really excited , are you seeing a pattern. Sorry if I can't say this place sucks , because it doesn't. I also can't rave about this place either , I've had better .

2007-05-22,5.0,"I love Calo.   It's partly sentimental for me 'cause this is where my partner took me on our first date too many years ago for anyone to care, but it has remained a favorite.    The ribs and penne a la romano (with angel hair instead of penne) are two of my default dinner entrees here, but my absolute favorite is the rack of lamb they do on Saturdays.  Oh my Allah, it is bone-suckin' good!   They also have a good creamy garlic salad dressing, and coupled with the focaccia in the bread basket, it's a perfect starter to your meal.   Finish with a tiramisu and a snifter of Frangelico, then sit back and listen to the live music and watch some of the old-timers mix it up on the dance floor with the newcomers.  OK, so the ""bands"" are cheesy, but that's part of the charm.     The service here has always been top-notch.  (are Sandy and Luis still there?)  They aren't overbearing with the ""you're my-best-friends"" crap, but they just seem to know when to appear at the table.    When they did the remodel job (which is fantastic, IMO) I thought they were going to go way upscale.  The place looks like it's going to be expensive, but it's really reasonable considering how cute that neighborhood has become.  They actually tried, but the experiment failed.  It's too long a story to go into here, but if anyone remembers ""Finestra"", they'll know what I'm talking about.   I haven't been to Calo in at least three months, and just writing this is making me crave a visit.   I see a rack of lamb in my future!

The service can be a problem as I have on multiple occassions been subjected to a very inattentive waiter.

That said, I must admit that I miss the OLD Calo's -- the one with the 60's neighborhood pseudo-supper-clubby atmosphere.  It had great character!  On the weekends there was always a band and cute neighborhood couples would trip the light fantastic on the dance floor. Now Calo's has been remodeled (actually it was a couple of  years ago) and the remodel is nice.  The problem is that it's just a little too generic-yuppie. Last time I was there, there was a ""light jazz"" combo (which is OK), but no one was dancing. The ""old school"" atmosphere is definitely missed (at least by this nostalgic ol' queen!).
