The food and service are always top-notch, the staff are always polite and professional, and they have an extensive gluten free menu.  If you're looking for a brunch place with a great cocktail and breakfast selection, professional and organized service, and indoor and patio seating, this is it. You always get their free signature chocolate chip bread pudding cake (I don't know the real name, but that's what I call it) that also has a gluten free option.  It's delicious!  I've tried the gluten free waffles, pancakes, benedicts, lox plates, and corned beef hash. All are exceptional. The hash browns are just the way I like them-crispy but not dry with a buttery flavor. Also, I've worked in numerous restaurants and can tell this place is well-managed. I'm lucky this place is in my neighborhood. Just a heads up-it's cash only, but if you didn't bring any, there are 2 ATMs. Go check this place out. It's within walking distance from the lake, there's street parking, and it's a local landmark in itself, as the home of Big Chicks.",0.985,0.836,0.164,0.0,0.6008771929824561

I had the Santa Fe with a side of avocado and chorizo, hash browns with my eggs poached. They nailed it on all dishes. My partner had the GF pumpkin pancakes - delicious!

It is hard to find a bad item on the menu. Even the burger is delicious! This is a bit of an eclectic place for out of towners. The bar you wait in is a lesbian bar at night and there is a lot of interesting art on the wall which just adds to the charm and artistry of this place. You will for sure wait about an hour or so to sit down but the wait is worth it. They have all kinds of board games while you wait. There is an indoor and outdoor area which is nice although outdoor area is pretty small. The fruit cups that everyone gets are delicious with high quality fruit. They also bring a little cake kind of like a coffee cake to the table as well for everyone. Each time it is a little different and they are all amazing!

We were quickly greeted by a bunch of smiling faces that led us to our table immediately. Along with the menu, we were given some kind of pastry that went perfectly with a cup of black coffee. I ordered a corned beef hash because I am a sucker for those things, and my girlfriend got the lax protein platter. The proportion on the plate immediately spelled the word ""WORTH"" when it arrived in front of me. Everything tasted to be freshly made and it was prepared with the utmost care. It's a shame that my stomach has a finite amount of room, otherwise I would have loved to extend my stay to try a few more things on the menu.

2017-04-16,4.0,"We stopped in for Sunday  brunch--thank you to my fellow Yelpers for the great recommendation. Tweet is a fun neighborhood restaurant with a great, casual vibe.  The menu was very large and had something for everyone--vegan, gluten-free, organic and really really bad for you but delicious.  The service was really great and that is huge for me. I ordered an egg white omelet with hash brown and my boyfriend ordered a chorizo breakfast burrito.  As soon as we sat down, there was complimentary chocolate chip coffee cake on the table and they brought the cutest little cups of fresh fruit while we waited.  The coffee was delicious and bottomless with lots of people offering refills. My omelet was delicious.  The hash browns were nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  My boyfriend's omelet was a little disappointing.  It looked like a deflated balloon.  It was probably the most under-stuffed burrito I have ever seen and it was not rolled evenly.  One side of it was almost completely flat.  I wish I had stopped to take a picture.  He said the flavor of the burrito was fine. I will definitely go back and give Tweet another try for lunch.",0.9946,0.707,0.251,0.042,0.5581746031746031
2017-04-09,3.0,Tweet has delicious food and drinks. Unfortunately they don't have a system that texts or calls you when your table is ready. Instead they have a gentleman with a mr microphone turned up to the highest level announcing your table and simultaneously shattering the nerves of anyone in the restaurant who may be hungover from the night before.   They need to either abandon this process or start crushing up Xanax and serving it on the free fruit cups.,0.3182,0.784,0.11,0.106,0.8400000000000001

I had a spinach & cheese omelette- let me tell you they did not skimp on the spinach! There was almost too much & I love spinach. Better too much than not enough.  My friends both got the Cobb salad. That was HUGE and the dressing came in cute little pitchers.  I would eat here again for sure. Staff was very friendly & attentive.

I've also tried their lox platter which was presented beautifully and was a great portion size.  One thing to note is that this is NOT the place to sit and enjoy breakfast for hours and hours.

But it's easy to see why, this is a fun spot. The breakfast menu is epic. I mean, epic, epic. So many choices it's nearly impossible to pick. And then if that wasn't enough, they velcro on the things they're famous for on top of the menu, giving you even more choice. I was going to go for the biscuits and gravy but our very friendly server pointed out that if I got the biscuits and gravy benedict (basically what it sounds like), I could have some hashbrowns and fruit cup as well. So I went with that, and it was damn good. Thick gravy, sausage patties, excellent eggs, and perfectly cooked hashbrowns, all on one spot. Mmm. This is not a slow place, so if you want to sit around and enjoy a coffee, this ain't it. They want you sitting, eating and out so they can turn around that table.

Though this totally threw off our whole day, it seemed like it really was an urgent need. Of course, I then turned to Yelp to start our quest. After scrolling through a few places, Tweet jumped out at me. We decided to head out in the middle of Sunday brunch time, which is generally a terrible idea.  We circled around the block a few times, finding a relatively convenient parking space and wandered in. We put our name in and headed over to the bar to spend the 40 minute wait time with the bartenders. We found recently vacated seats at the bar and started boozing. Bloody Marys for me - they can really vary the spice on this one, from mild and delicious to holy fuckballs that's hot, but delicious. The fiance went with some bourbon lemonade drink which disappeared immediately, and a Smoky Maria, which he also loved.  They have a fantastic loud speaker system that gives an old school feel, and when we heard my name we wandered over and were seated next to some really interesting folks. Some of the tables are HELLA close, like you're basically brunching together, which was ok, because they were interesting and provided much entertainment.  You get a little amouse bouche of sorts - today it was some sort of appley bread which was DELISH! I ordered the classic eggs benny with hashbrowns and a side of bacon and also a soy chai latte. The chai came in a giant ass mug, which was perfect for it. I need to get one of those mugs at home! Fiance face got his meaty breakfast burrito and loved every bite.

The gluten free menu was extensive and everything on it tasted amazing. I can't say enough about the Pumpkin pancakes. I'd go back just for the pancakes to be honest they serious took the cake.

Comes with a fresh fruit cup!  - biscuits & gravy ($7): 2 buttermilk biscuits covered in a creamy pepper country gravy with Hebron Farm Amish Country Sausage the corned beef hash was a bit too salty for my liking but the eggs that i ordered over easy were beautifully cooked. and the hash browns were probably one of my favorite things about this place. i love crispy hash browns and the texture on these were perfection. i probably wouldn't order the corned beef hash again though. my friend really liked the chilaquiles. the biscuits and gravy were served piping hot and very tasty, a perfect depiction of southern comfort food.",0.9948,0.773,0.216,0.01,0.6598039215686275

The waiter was pushy when I tried to pull the tables apart and then unfriendly when we asked to be seated at an open 2-top so we decided to leave. Communal dining isn't for everyone and sometimes you just want to have a private conversation with the person you're with without random people being all up in your business. Knowing what I know now, I definitely won't be going back. Again, this kind of seating situation might be fine for some people - it's just not my thing.

(b) Gluten Free, Vegetarian and Vegan options - Great place to go with your friends who have dietary restrictions (c) Wait - You will probably have to wait to get seated but hang in there - it is worth it.",0.9941,0.794,0.206,0.0,0.5513888888888888

Came here on a Friday with my boyfriend and friend and got a nice table on the front patio.  Rex was our server, and right off the bat he was friendly and attentive and hysterical.   Coffee cake is served immediately, and coffee mugs filled with delicious, high quality brew. We all ordered bloody marys, out of which my favorite was the wasabi! Rex was quick to volunteer to take a picture of our group when he saw me taking a photo of my friends- very sweet.   While we sat with our drinks outside, it started to rain.  Not one minute of light raindrops had fallen before Rex returned and told us he had a table for us inside.  The bus staff wuickly scooped up our drinks and helped with our umbrellas and purses and sat us. Our food came immediately.  I ordered the veggie benedict, and can tell you it was probably the best vegetarian benedict I've had!  The hashbrowns were crispy and plentiful, and the fruit cup was fresh. At one point Rex had noticed my boyfriend's coffee had sat for a while, and offered to bring him out a new cup with fresh cream.  Impressive. The bill for three people having a huge, delicious brunch with drinks was very reasonable. We were in Chicago for four days, and I wanted to go back every single day.  My boyfriend even hugged Rex by the end of our meal, we enjoyed ourselves so much!   Five happy stars.",0.994,0.784,0.193,0.023,0.6506980519480521

But there are a couple of minor demerits.  The corn arepas is unique and worth ordering, and the omelettes are certainly acceptable. The ""Bib Im Bop"" is expressly not authentic bibimbap. Although it wasn't necessarily bad, having had so many delicious, authentic bibimbaps around the city, I'd go with something else next time. The Santa Fe special - poached eggs on black bean patties with hash browns and tasty homemade salsa - is like everything here listed, a large portion of a unique meal that won't actually blow your little brunch mind.  I'd also warn you again about the highly alcoholic drinks. Some may favor this, but two of our friends found the Rum Fizz drink (whatever it was actually called) undrinkable - the John Daly went down much more easily.

We thought it was someone else's table, so we hesitated for a couple seconds. She gave us a snarky comment, saying that it's up to us if we want to sit on the clean table with the menus, and plates, or the dirty table next to it.

We were pleased with the complimentary coffee cake at the table waiting for us when we were seated. We were also pleasantly surprised when our entrees included a fresh fruit bowl that was brought out for us while we were waiting for the rest of our food to be served. The waiter was great... super friendly throughout our meal. The food was okay. We've definitely had better brunches in Chicago, but the food at Tweet was fine - nothing to complain about. In general, we were having a decent experience.  Until the end of the meal...  Before we were even finished eating our entrees, we were given the check. We each put in our cash (while one of my friends was still finishing her food), the waiter took it and ask if we needed change, and we told him to keep it. (It was a 20% tip.) As soon as the last of us finished her food, her plate was cleared and the hostess came to our table.  ""How was everything?"" ""Great,"" I said, thinking that it was nice of her to make sure our experience was good.  ""Did you get your check?""  ""Yes, thank you,"" I said, smiling - again under the assumption that she was just making sure we were being taken care of.  ""Okay, well I've got a thousand hungry people in line,"" making it completely clear that the only thing she cared about was getting us out the door as soon as possible.  A minute later, someone came and cleared away our water glasses and napkins. I fear they would have taken the coffee cups if we hadn't been actively trying to quickly finish our coffee before scurrying out the door. As I left, I noted that the number of people waiting was significantly less than a thousand... and even less than was waiting when I arrived.  I get it - Chicago brunch spots are busy and have limited space and it's necessary to keep things turning over so people aren't waiting unnecessarily long. But what began as an adequate brunch ended in a way that left me with such a negative impression, I'll never go back.  In contrast, one of my favorite brunch spots on Damen puts signs on their tables actually asking patrons not to linger during busy times out of consideration for their limited space and the people in line. I've never found this to be offensive. The service is always stellar there, and the food is amazing. (Over Easy Cafe... check 'em out!!)

There are stores with atm machines right across the street in case you're only carrying plastic. Expect to spend about $15 for an entre w/ taxes and another $10 on each drink.

Lox & Cream Cheese Scramble -  Lox and cream cheese! w/ eggs n hash browns. So delish! The Santa Fe Special which comprises of house made organic black bean patties topped with organic eggs topped with choice of house made salsa (green, red, roasted); hash browns or salad. Tweet has a great ambiance, lively and loud and perfect for people watching. The servers/staff are just as fascinating personalities as the regular patrons.  Go for the food, stay for the fun and the energy. :)",0.993,0.78,0.181,0.039,0.5384897154127923

There was a family playing Uno (lots of games available in the bar) while they waited. Every member of the staff is sincerely friendly. And the food is homemade and delicious.

A couple times, they've been left under the warmer too long or something because they were hot and became rubbery.  Other wise, the fresh fruit is awesome, the little sweet bread they give you the moment you sit dosn is something all breakfast restaurants should do!  The have a good variety of breakfast items and some tasty cocktails.",0.9786,0.75,0.25,0.0,0.5596153846153846

It was fairly packed considering they close at 3 and the last seating is at 2:45. We were seated as soon as we walked in. I'm not sure how many seating areas they have but I believe they have 3. However, for our visit they only had the most left side open.  The wait staff was friendly and attentive. Our waiter, Rex, was awesome. He was very friendly and personable. He gets 5 stars for customer service. The entire time we were there he was very attentive and made sure we were never thirsty.  Here is where the 4 stars comes into play: the food. My wife ordered the croissant platter and I had the skirt steak and eggs. Both dishes comes with side choices. We both had the hash browns. They were nice and crunchy but they were bland. I ordered my steak medium well and parts of it were over cooked. The eggs were ok. The meal was pretty cheap. We paid around $34 for both our meals even after adding extra stuff.  Wild we come back?

Denver Omelette - there was SO MUCH egg in this omelette. So much. Huge portion. Pretty good.  Egg Foo Feel Young Omelette - again, SO MUCH egg. Very flavorful, quite good.  Biscuits + Gravy, with two over-easy eggs ($9) - definitely not the best I've had. I usually like my gravy with a little more sausage, and my biscuits a little less dense. But still good, very filling, eggs perfectly cooked.  Hash browns ($2.25) - really delicious, with a great crunchy exterior, but an absolutely massive portion. In hindsight, would not have gotten these.  Service was really good, if a little slow to start, and we were greeted at our table with a delicious coconut cake. Our glasses and coffee mugs were kept full throughout our meal.

The eggs Benedict was legit (my friend corrected me - they say on fleek now, wtf I'm so old) and my husband loved his corn beef hash. Everything was just so good!

2015-11-08,1.0,"Wow. Absolutely the WORST SERVICE I have EVER received in the restaurant industry!! I am still in shock and honestly had to wait a moment to cool down before writing this review.  First off - it took about an hour and a half to get seated. Please note, this would have been a non issue and wouldn't have bothered us had the remainder of our time there been pleasant. We enjoyed their Bloody Marys while waiting - which were great. Finally we get seated. After a moment of checking out the menu we order with our server. Food arrives lightning fast. Our server does not check in with us about the food at all - in fact, the only time we see him again is for the check and for taking our plates while we are barely even finished. At this point we had only had one coffee refill, and I was hoping to get one more. I look at my watch and notice we have literally only been seated for 15 minutes. The whole interaction feels so rushed!! We are told that we can close out at the front desk, but a woman comes up to us twice after our plates have been taken to let us know she can ""give us change"" or ""get the check out of the way whenever we are ready.""  Our server comes up to us finally and asks us if we need anything else before closing out. I ask for my one coffee refill. He leaves to talk to a man with glasses and the mic - he was in charge of seating guests initially. The guy comes up to us - and (I still can't believe this) has the audacity to tell us ""we can no longer serve you coffee. If you ladies want to sit here and talk all day, you can do so at the bar. At this point we can no longer serve you at the table."" His tone was BEYOND rude, and when we confronted him about only being seated for 15 minutes after waiting for an hour and a half - he is uninterested. ""I don't need to deal with this,"" and ""like I said if you want to talk all day and drink coffee all day, you can go back there."" is the last thing he says before he storms off like a little child. WOW. Just wow.  The food was mediocre at best, and certainly not worth the crappy, crappy service. There are MUCH better brunch spots that I will bring my business to in the neighborhood - ones that know how to manage their guests.

2015-11-08,1.0,"I'm not even sure they deserve one star!

We get there and there's a wait, but figure it's a Sunday in Chicago and that's to be expected.  They take our names to their list and send us over to a busy bar section to wait.   We drink bloody marys and wait for about an hour and a half.  They finally call our names and we were seated. As soon as we're in our seats our waiter is there to take our order.  The rest of the meal was rushed.  The food came lightning fast and then as soon as we even looked like we were going to put our forks down,  he was there to almost remove our plates at last bite.  That was the only other time we saw him.  He never inquired about our meal once. He wrote the check out at the table and left it in the middle of the table.  He told us to check out up front when WE WE'RE READY.   We both still had coffee to finish, so we continue our conversation when the hostess comes to our table to tell us she ""can make change for us"" whenever were ready...odd considering we were just told to pay at the front and we never asked for change.

I couldn't believe it. It was so rude, even the people next to us noticed and commented.  When I  commented on his rudeness he got huffy and walked away.  We had only actually been seated for about 20 mins after waiting an hour and a half.   Needless to say,  weekend brunch is busy, but that is no excuse to treat customers like they're doing something wrong by wanted to have a nice meal, conversation,  and finish their coffee!",0.8912,0.844,0.087,0.069,0.5039569160997732

They give you a piece of breakfast bread when you are seated. GF one has chocolate chips in it and it was delicious!! I ordered the corned beef hash and a side of gf pancakes. It has been so long since i have had a really, really good gf pancake and this place nails it. My non-gf husband even gave his approval ans he pretty much doesnt like anything i try that is gf. You seriously cannot tell it's gf. There is also an apple compote that comes with the corned beef and since im gf it was just the filling so i had it put on my pancakes and it was perfect. No syrup needed. The hash had some bell peppers in it just fyi. Easily the best hash i have ever eaten. Husband ordered a benedict with sausage patty and sausage gravy on it. He basically licked his plate clean.  Our server was really great. His name escapes me but i enjoyed our conversation about movies and tv shows.

2015-09-30,3.0,"I wish there was a ""Meh. OK."" option. Like 2.5 stars for this place, but I'm erring on the side of generosity.  Tweet is in the part of Uptown/Edgewater where nothing else is. Great place for a business that wants to have the most happening thing in that part of town; not so great for, like, literally anything else. A fellow veggie friend and I visited Tweet based on a recommendation from a coworker. We went around brunch time on a Saturday and we didn't make reservations. We waited for maybe 10 minutes or so until our name was called for our table. Not bad at all for a packed restaurant.   There were two things that were really great at Tweet: the staff were all very friendly and the portions were generous. They had a snack of some sort waiting on the table when we were seated and we both got fruit before our main dishes (we both got the vegan burrito #7) were brought out. I didn't, however, enjoy my burrito. There was a funky taste in it that I know I've tasted before and it was when I kept some beans refrigerated for so long I hadn't realized they'd spoiled.  I'm saying there were old beans in there. Slow-ish service is totally understandable on a Saturday afternoon, so that's not even a factor. However, there was some kind of mix-up with the cash we gave a passing staff person (not our waitress) for our bill. It took a long time to get that taken care of so I had to go feed my meter again on top of having had to leave to get cash (my own dumb fault for not having noticed that there was an ATM inside Tweet), it all added to a kind of jumbled up situation. Also, I'm sure Tweet's building is pretty old, but there's something unsettling about a cracked ceiling with water damage.  I love that this business exists where it is, but I don't think I'll be returning until I've heard about some improvements.",0.8145,0.773,0.125,0.102,0.6016203703703703

The wait may be long if you hit the place during peak hours but it's entirely worth it. The Bloody Mary's hit the spot just right and are served in a huge tiki goblet without all the crazy gimmicks most places have for garnish just simple celery, carrot stick, olives and lemon. As a vegetarian, brunch can be a bit harder to manage but vegetarian options are MORE than enough to satisfy and even more for the meat-friendly. I almost always get the Veggie Country Benedict which is a biscuit topped with veggie sausage, poached eggs and smothered in veggie sausage gravy. It's so hard to pass up and branch out because it's that good.  I can't forget to mention how friendly the hosts and staff are.

2015-08-29,1.0,"This is not a food review***  I didn't want to leave a review, but I was too far to check in so here it is. Pretty disappointed about our experience at Tweet earlier today. It was raining out this morning when my boyfriend called the restaurant asking what the wait was like. We were told that people were scared of the rain, and if we came in soon we should get seated almost immediately. Not even 10 minutes later we pull up and there is a line out the door. We decided to give it a shot anyways. (Maybe everyone was showing up because the rain just stopped).  We were greeted in a friendly tone, were told we would be seated as quickly as possible and to take a seat at the bar. (I go to school/work in hospitality. Send people to the bar to make some $$ while people wait + distract them from waiting. Yeah, got it) Quite a few tables were cleared so we thought we had gotten in just in time. Once heading to the bar, we realized we were sadly mistaken. The bar area was packed. We remained optimistic and figured we'd let our 20 minute parking meter run up before we got restless.  20 minutes later my boyfriend asks the same gentleman how much longer the wait would be. He told us that there was 1 more table for 2 ahead of us and that the wait would be less than 10 minutes. 15+ minutes, 4 tables for 2, 1 table for 5 and 1 table for 7 later we decided to leave. My boyfriend made it a point to say something to the staff (our rule is whoever picked the spot leads the meal and talks to staff if something is screwed up. So it was his turn). The gentleman swore up and down that our table was ready and that he was going to sit us and buy us cocktails, but at the end of the day we were so frustrated by the made up info previously that we left.   This was SO disappointing. My boyfriend is a stage manager and I work in events so our time together is limited and brunch is our thing. We have an epic list of places and were excited to return to Tweet. Long waits I completely understand. Just don't give out made up info and waste people's time.  *ultimately, we went to Mariano's and spent $25 in groceries. Spent much less than I would have at brunch, but was willing to drop a lot of money for the meal I remembered from our last visit.",-0.9633,0.836,0.065,0.099,0.387073112073112

Be prepared for a bit of a wait (30 minutes - 1 hour), but it's worth it and you can get a drink at the bar or free coffee and water while you wait.  We started off with coffee and hot chocolate. Coffee is bottomless and the hot chocolate might as well have been - this cup was the size of a large soup bowl. At least 16 ounces of hot chocolate in there, if not more. And it was tasty.  We started with the aebleskivers as an appetizer (mistake! you do not need an appetizer!). These are essentially bite-sized pancakes. I thought they were quite good although not really doughnuts as billed. My friend, who had tried these Danish tasties before other places, said they were a bit more dense than he was used to.  Every breakfast entree comes with a fruit cup or compote for free, so add that into your meal calculus.  I had the french toast, which was simple but sublime (and, again, quite large). I also had the turkey sausage patties (again, TOO MUCH FOOD, rookie mistake), which were perfectly cooked and tasty although nothing special. My friend got the chilaquiles, which he said were pretty good, especially the bite with avocado. His was so big that he couldn't finish it, and he's a hearty eater.

We waited a few minutes for our table, got seated. We wanted to fit an extra person in our table after we ordered, but the server told us we would have to leave our table, wait back in line for maybe 25-30 mins and reorder with the extra person. They didn't want to make any accommodations for us. Fitting in an extra chair was not an option. So we decided to just stick with the original table leaving the extra person behind.  We are waiting for our food and notice the tables near us continually get coffee refills and get asked if everything was good, do you need anything else. We only got asked once if everything was okay. I don't appreciate being ignored. I ordered coffee and only got one refill that I had to ask for.  The people next to us ordered later than us and got their food way quicker than us.  I got my food. I ordered the Santa Fe special. Black bean patty, eggs, salad. It was delicious. Big portion. So worth it. UNTIL towards the end of my meal, I crunched in EGGSHELLS in my egg. My appetite was spoiled.  My friend ordered the portobello Benedict and found a hair on her hash brown. AGAIN, APPETITE IS SPOILED.  Overall the food was good minus the eggshells and hair in the food, but the fact that I can't bring on an extra person....that's ridiculous. This used to be my neighborhood spot, after today, not so much. I get it, it's a busy Saturday so maybe servers can't check up on us as frequent as a slow day, but I'm over it.

First, the wait was a little over an hour which I completely understand, it was a Sunday I get it, I'm not a monster. During this wait I was chatting w/ someone on the street when our table was called, my friends went in and I followed literally a minute later. As I walked in, I was stopped by the hostess, I explained that my friends were already seated, she replied with ""that's a lie"".  I tried to explain that they just walked in a minute before me and she rolled her eyes and said that an incomplete party would not be seated. I get it, I've been to brunch, no incomplete parties are to be seated but I was there, it just took me a minute to say goodbye to someone else. So when the person who did seat my friends came over and interjected the hostess gave me a dirty look like I was the jerk. I knew I wasn't getting an apology, but the look after being called a liar was a bit much. If you hate people or being decent it too difficult find employment that does not include dealing with human beings.  The waitress was very nice. My plate was taken before I was finished. I should have said something, but I was caught off guard considering half my omelette was still on my plate. At this point I wasn't surprised.  The staff was trying to push us out. Once again I know brunch is high stakes but we waited the hour for our table so we should have been afforded the right to finish our food. The kind waitress just refilled my coffee and my friend was finishing her Bloody Mary when the host (different one) on a microphone, let us know our time was up and needed the table.  The food was fine, but if a nice, relaxing, fun brunch is what you are looking for, look somewhere else.",0.9476,0.785,0.128,0.086,0.6040165631469979

I get it.   Right behind the waiter the host/manager person came by and asked, ""Do you need anything else?"" and we said no, to which he replied, ""I need the table, so....""   Sorry, I have never been treated this way.  As we left I asked if I could speak with him, and he immediately became defensive stating they were really busy and he had other diners to think about, they can't just let people sit at the tables forever.  I asked him, ""Since I am the customer, could I speak now?""  I pointed out what I mentioned above.

The bar area--or holding tank, I will call it--was very packed and loud. We stood around awkwardly but there is water and complimentary coffee you can pour yourself. My friend ordered a Bloody Mary, which she said was very tasty. And then we waited. And waited. And waited.

2014-10-11,4.0,"Tweet is a cafe connected to the Big Chicks LGBT-friendly bar. My friend recommended the cafe for our first get-together in two years. It was so good to see her, and to share a good meal again.  When I arrived, my friend had already put our names on the list for a table. We were told to grab a drink at the bar inside Big Chicks, which you can walk through a door into, while waiting for our table to be set. Even before we had sat down at the bar stools, our name was called and we made out way through the packed bar back to the cafe.  We were seated immediately, and given a small plate of pumpkin bread, dusted with powdered sugar. Such a nice touch. Coffee was offered, but we refused, having already had our caffeine fix in the morning. The coffee is $2.75 for bottomless cups (unlimited refills) of Intelligentsia hot coffee, though.  I ordered the vegetarian biscuits and gravy ($8), and my friend ordered the corn arepas. These are cornmeal pancakes, topped with a whole avocado, 2 organic eggs your way, housemade guajillo sauce, creme fraiche, cilantro, a side of black beans, and a fruit cup (pineapple, strawberries, etc). My friend's corn arepas reminded me of my mom's Indian besan parathas (flatbread made with corn flour), which she often made for breakfast. My biscuits were thick and cakey in texture, perfect to absorb the veggie gravy. I added a dash of Tabasco sauce, and this carb-loaded dish hit the spot.  The food was good and filling-my friend couldn't finish her food. The service is what makes Tweet stand out-everyone from the hostess to the wait staff are friendly.

Why the 4 stars instead of 5 if I liked everything you say?  I'm not really sure....perhaps because it is simply a breakfast place and I wasn't wow'd out of this world.  Perhaps because if I come back to Chicago soon, this place won't be top of mind.

I arrived on a Friday morning (9/19) around 1045.  I was meeting a friend at Tweet for brunch, he suggested we try it.  It is my first and last time I anticipate having any interaction with Tweet.  I have been to Big Chicks many times and had a stellar time, however the service and friendly nature sadly does not translate to the restaurant.  When I arrived I walked in and the hostess asked how many, I responded two, and she started to walk away.  I requested an outside table to which she responded in a nasty tone there were bees outside.  I am used to eating outdoors and so I said, that is ok.  I was not sure of my friends preference, so I stated that when my friend arrives if it is too much outside with the bees we will move in right away.  The  hostess looked at me and said in a nasty voice, 'well we start to get busy around this time so you may not have any tables inside for you.""  She then stared at me so I said again Id like to try outside first.  Well it did turn out that the bees were a bit intense, like there were 3-4 buzzing around me with just a cup of coffee, so my friend wanted to sit inside.  There were at least 3-4 tables open but we were sat squished next to another couple.  We wanted to move to have a more private conversation and were immediately shuffled back to our table.   The menu looked amazing and we ordered, our food was great, the food runners? or staff that was cooking seemed ok.  Midway through our meal another gentleman comes and removes my backpack from my seat, as I was eating, and informed me that it was in the way and he would be moving it.  The attitude of these few people really killed the experience and I will not be back to Tweet.  It only takes a smile, some sense of humor or just a relative positive attitude to make a difference.  My friend kept apologizing for the entire meal because of the nasty energy put forth by some of the staff members.  That itself was embarrassing to me because he felt bad for suggesting we try it.   First impressions make a world of difference.   J King",0.9511,0.799,0.127,0.073,0.4536521679378823

2014-09-07,2.0,"I was really excited to come check Tweet out because I have heard such good things about it and a brunch spot with a long wait is always a good sign to me. This was all of our first time there. Disclaimer - I am in the restaurant and bar industry and have been for a while 10+ years, so I am quite picky about service and food, however I do keep an open mind and hardly ever complain and decide to make a Yelp account to write a review reflecting a sub par experience, which is what I'm doing now. I hate Yelp but decided to write a review anyway. Alright so to get the good out of the way, the manager/owner was very kind to let us know that there were a ton of bees outside so the patio wasn't the best place to sit so we sat inside.  The food was good, not amazing but I was satisfied. The mini ""doughnuts"" (forgot the term..A-something-skis) aren't really doughnuts..they're more like those pancake balls but were still alright. Wanted to order fresh squeezed OJ (what it says on menu) but it's not squeezed in house (asked the bus boy)..Why do places do that? Try to fool you? I even worked at a place that lied about that and it was annoying to have to explain that it's not freshly squeezed in house. Anyway... We sat down and were immediately greeted with water and coffee. The server Lorena came by and asked if we wanted drinks but we didn't so she walked away without saying ""ok"" or asking if we had questions of been there before, no suggestions, but I had a question so I called her back. I asked her if their chicken sausage was apple chicken sausage and she looked at me with wide open eyes like I was crazy and didn't even say anything to me!! So i looked at my friends and was like, ""Uh am I saying it wrong? No yea..is your guys chicken sausage apple chicken sausage?"" And she goes..uh no it's..not it's not. It's just regular chicken sausage. And I was like..alright!..thanks... And she walked away. I felt like I was crazy for asking her..I mean a lot of places serve apple chicken sausage or other kinds so I wanted to know! What if I had an allergy or intolerance to apples and that was why I had asked? I actually asked because I love chicken sausage. Well lo and behold, by the lower right corner of the menu where the omelets were, there was a suggestion to add their ""maple glazed apple chicken sausage"" to the side. So I showed my friends, and said, ""Look! it IS apple chicken sausage!"" So I decided to be a B and order it with my food so I could point it out to her when it arrived to the table. (Something else prevented me from being able to be a B about that, though.) When the food finally came later on, our food was auctioned off by the food runner. Go figure. Also, my sausage was not in sight. Well guess what!? It was sliced and UNDER my eggs/tomato/avocado (California Benedict) on the benedict!! So when Lorena came back. I asked her why the sausage was IN my benedict when I indeed ordered it on the side. (That's a typical thing, plus you should always ask the guest to confirm if its ON the entree or on the SIDE.) Lorena goes ""Oh yeah when you order sausage it goes ON the benedict."" I WAS LIKE WTF!? I tell her basically that. But that I'd keep it and just pick it out. And she walks away. Thanks for suggesting something to make me feel better or taking something or a percentage off the bill! Yeah right. Last but not least, I asked for a different dressing besides their white balsamic(?) vinaigrette. So my thousand island dressing was on the side in a ramekin. I put some on the salad and took a bite and tasted the vinaigrette. The salad was tossed in it already and I also had the thousand island on it, so I had TWO dressings on my salad and they didn't mix well together, like me and Lorena. (Could potentially be a kitchen error but an error nonetheless.) Overall - I just wish we had a different server. Lorena's service sucked (although we still left a 20% tip cause we know that doesn't all go to her and only her) and she gave me attitude and got the dumbest smallest things wrong on my order that should be thought out better. My friend didn't even like her and was ""afraid"" of her so she told me to ask her for straws for our water since I was the ""one with the balls"" :P I'll go back for the food and have to try the drinks next time, just not revisiting my girl Lorena. Learn the ingredients in your sausage, and pay more attention to detail. Also care more about your guests and their needs and don't give attitude especially if it isn't given to you in the first place. Thanks Lorena!",0.9952,0.798,0.129,0.073,0.5664348018800074

It used to be more novel when it was only one of a couple restaurants that used sustainable and organic ingredients, but now this is common.  In addition, it is a disorganized hot mess. It's so loud you can barely hear yourself think, if you arrive after 9 am on a Saturday you are waiting in, what could be loosely described as, the Thunderdome for an hour. The final straw, for us, is the fact that it's 2014 and this place is still ""cash only"". What? Seriously, if not for the other things I may be able to look beyond this, but clearly any type of convenience for their customer is foreign to the management.

2014-09-06,4.0,"Went to tweet for brunch on a Saturday and had only a short 10 minute wait at around 10:20AM. The restaurant has a big bar where patrons can wait and serves free water and coffee until your table is called.  The menu is enormous - took us awhile to even decide on what we wanted with so many good choices. My friend is vegetarian and also doesn't eat eggs and she commented that this brunch menu is one of the best she's seen for non-egg eaters! They also have a ton of gluten free options.  We ordered the vegan chilaquiles with soyrizo and tofu instead of eggs and the steak breakfast burrito, both with hashbrowns. Our waitress was very accomodating and let us sub hashbrowns for the fruit cups and they were delicious! The burrito comes with an array of condiments - pico, salsa, sour cream, chipotle mayo. They were all delicious, but the burrito was fairly standard. I've also had the chorizo, avocado and chihuahua cheese burrito and it was definitely a better choice.

Ironically, my mother was mistreated from the moment we arrived because she talks too softly for the owner/hostess to hear her.

Henry's for example. However, the noise level is unbearable and the owner was rude to us from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. She is pushy, loud and uncouth. We almost forgot about her because the staff were so nice and attentive while we were eating...until she came and basically asked us to leave the table the moment we had finished our plates.

Ok no problem- moved to a small table and took a look at the menu.

I know that everything is supposed to be fresh, cage free, organic etc.... but that doesn't mean it needs to lack salt or seasoning? A place with so many hot sauces lined up on every table always makes me a little wary as well - is it there so I can cover my food to add taste?

2014-05-07,2.0,"So disappointed by my visit to Tweet. Brunch is my favorite meal of the day and I have been wanting to brunch at Tweet for over a year now. I finally found the time to go today but it left me wishing I had gone elsewhere instead. I'll start off with the service which was impeccable. The host was more than pleasant as was the waiter and everyone else who stopped by our table to make sure we had enough water and coffee. Maybe a little too much. Except at the end when I needed some water and no one came by--the waiter refilled the water for the girl at the table next to us but not for us. Why. The layout of the place seemed fine but as the meal progressed, I realized the tables were WAY too close. Well, we were way too close to the table next to ours. I felt as if the four of us were having one conversation as my mom and I were not as loud as the two next to us. I definitely did not need to hear about all about the woes of the woman's retail job. Now for the food. I'm going to start by saying that the best part of the meal might have been the fruit cup and the cake like things they gave us at the beginning of our meal. Womp. We ordered the portobello benedict and the pumpkin pancakes to share. The portobello mushrooms were burnt and the eggs overcooked--the yolk wasn't runny at all which is how a poached egg should be. I always order eggs benedict wherever I go--some places are a hit and some aren't. The hashbrowns were fine, however. The top was beautifully browned and crunchy; the bottom layers were moist and delicious. As for the pancakes, the best part of this dish was the cream. The pancakes were weirdly a bit salty and rather than being fluffy, they were heavy and undercooked. My mom and I didn't feel like asking the kitchen to redo the dishes as that is such a pain but maybe we should have and tried to enjoy the dishes. Maybe other dishes here fare better and we just ordered two that just weren't as exceptional but I probably won't be coming back to try.",0.9934,0.807,0.15,0.043,0.5384548611111112

Today we were told by the hostess (and I think she is the owner too) that she had other people waiting for a table.

I was worried about parking (no issue, found metered parking out front) and having to wait since it was about 10am on a sunny Saturday (we literally got called right as we were about to sit down at the bar/waiting area). We were greeted very warmly by the ladies at the entrance, and then again by our server. Everyone working there seemed so happy to be there and so happy to see us. We also got a prime seat by the front window. Be warned: there are a LOT of menu options and they all sound good. I was in a savory mood but almost changed my mind when a nearby table was served with delicious-looking pancakes and french toast and some type of small donut/pastry thingys. I noticed all the servers (including ours) took the time to go over the options and make recommendations. I ended up getting the Veggie Country Benedict, which are poached eggs on top of veggie sausage patties on top of a biscuit and then smothered in veggie gravy. It came with hash browns and a fruit cup. Oh my goodness, it was so good. I must have looked like a total pig eating my food, but I don't care. Everything was also really fresh. Other things to note: -We were served very quickly -Our coffees were topped off often -CASH ONLY but there's an ATM inside -There were several parties waiting and I could sense that people were politely and subtly encouraged to leave once they had received their checks I loved my experience at Tweet so much that I signed up for Yelp just so I could write about it.

I will never ever ever come back to Tweet or any restaurant owned by the same people. Gross/bland food, ninja wait staff, rude service. The wait wasn't long for 2 people, we were seated in about 30 minutes on a  busy Sunday. We were quickly served the complementary cake (?), fruits, water, and coffee.  Looking at the menu, there are way too many items. 2 pages packed full of, (what seems like) size 8 font, breakfast and lunch items. Additionally tacked on are 2 smaller pages of specials, and then one more small list of specials on the table. It was a bit overwhelming, but also exciting that there are so many options.  The Food: 2 out of 5 stars Gluten-Free pumpkin pancakes: my friend adored it, and thought it tasted great.  Omelette - it was the blandest omelette I've ever had in my life. On top of that, they added a whole pound of butter, and it was absolutely disgusting. I wiped it all off and it was still really gross. The ingredients that were supposed to be in my omelette, the red peppers, etc. sounded really promising, but good luck looking for those ingredients. I think I may have had 5 small diced peppers. The service: 1 out of 5 stars Ninja waitstaff- Throughout our one hour stay, we had several different wait staff. They appeared and disappeared like ninjas. It was extremely hard to track them down, as they were also dressed like the customers. But, they were all friendly!  Non-English waiter- We asked (one of) our waiter about the dairy free options among the gluten-free dishes, but we had major communication issues.  It seems like he doesn't speak English very well. WE WERE ASKED TO LEAVE OUR TABLE- After a quick one hour brunch, we were getting ready to go, but got caught up in an extra 15 minutes chatting. A lady came by, with the biggest attitude you can imagine, and said ""Do you need anything? WE NEED THIS TABLE."" I know the place is busy, but to be honest, I brunch every other weekend at the busiest Chicago places downtown, i have NEVER, EVER, EVER been treated with such rude behavior. I have never been asked to leave before, and definitely not with that attitude. I understand that you need the table to accommodate other guests, but there are a million other (nicer) ways to ask your guests to leave.

First let me say that I know how busy and popular this place is for brunch on the weekends. I get that. No one however wants to feel like they're just another number to get in and out as quickly as possible. Long story not so short, we came we had one cocktail and food. Our server was friendly for most of time we were there (which wasn't long. Definitely les than an hour.) We had mentioned it was my birthday (I know who cares but....) We wanted to get one more cocktail before we headed out. When we said this to our server her face completely fell. Her demeanor changed. she paused and then said well you could always have a drink at the bar. We were a bit taken aback as we had always felt welcome and now we felt like we were being a pain to ask to have one more drink at the table we were already sitting at. now we get that it was super busy but we hadnt been there that long. Normally we are both people that will absolutely say something if we felt wronged but this place has always been wonderful and so we were genuinely surprised. I looked at the bar and it was packed. I even said there's no room at the bar. our servers response was ""aww sorry!"" really? that's it?  I wish we would have stood our ground.  This is some place I always loved. I work downtown in a store and I'm constantly sending tourists here when they ask me where to go for brunch. They always come back and tell me how much they loved it.

2014-03-12,5.0,"This is, hands down, the best brunch in the city. This is literally the ONLY place I will willingly wait an hour (or more!) for.  The menu is gigantic, with a completely separate gluten-free menu if one is so inclined (this one is not, but to each their own). There's no way you can't find a delicious, satisfying option here.  My personal favorite is the crab cakes hollandaise - basically, crab cakes Benedict. Words cannot describe it - and even though I'm certain it's got to be 3,000 calories of heart attackey goodness, it's so worth it. And it comes with a fruit cup so, you know, healthy!! The lox platter is also a winner, served with a lovely salad! Arguably the most important component to any brunch is the Bloody Mary - Tweet doesn't mess around. The wasabi Bloody is pitch perfect - such a great profile, yet so simple. Brilliant.  I love this place. I write this review to show my unqualified appreciation and support of their business...and while I want everyone to eat there to support them, I don't want to increase my wait time so if you could please see clear to not go on MY brunch days, that'd be great.

After about a 35 minute wait we were seated.  They offer an entire gluten free menu and a fair amount of vegetarian options.  There were also several items that could be made vegan!  Which is great for me since I'm vegan. I ordered the croissant sandwich with tofu scramble, vegetarian sausage and vegan cheese (they offer cheddar or pepper jack)  The sandwich comes with a healthy sized mixed green salad and side of fruit.  Both the salad and fruit were very fresh and the selection of fruit was great! (blackberries, blueberries, pineapple, large red grapes, strawberries and a slice of orange) My boyfriend ordered the #8 Burrito, the dirty man.  It had, ham, bacon, chorizo, scrambled eggs and hash browns inside, topped with cheddar cheese.  It came with a side of apple compote.  I sampled the compote and it was delicious!   All in all with the two meals, $3 vodka/lemonade, bloody mary and a cup of coffee our total (before tax & tip) was $35.75.  It's CASH only so if you don't want to pay a foreign ATM fee, come prepared!!

After looking at the menu online I knew we had to try it! We went on a Monday morning around 10:30 and got a table right away. We were nervous because of prior reviews complaining about the wait. Maybe it was due to the snowy snow or the president holiday. They gave him a coconut cake slice of cake and me a gluten free chocolate chip slice of heaven. This was to start off with. He ordered the veggie country Benedict. I got the gluten free pumpkin pancakes. We also got little fruit bowls which were a nice surprise. He licked the plate clean. The only thing he mentioned was that the ""sausage"" was a little tough. Other than that the was very happy with his meal. My pancakes were great!!! I got it without whipped cream and added butter. The powdered sugar and cinnamon sugar were a nice compliment to the cakes. I also got a gf BLT to go. I ate that later for lunch and it was great. Maybe a tad bit too much lettuce but easy to take off. As we were leaving we asked for more of the gf ""slices of heaven"" to go and got a chance to talk to the owner Michelle. We both thought she was really friendly and gave us recommendations of some books to read.

We had a fantastic time, the food was delicious and the portions are INSANE.  For $12 you are going to get a BUCKET of salad that you can eat for days.  And it's not all lettuce, it is quite the hearty dish. Another one of my friends got the quiche platter - which could have easily fed 2.   The atmosphere is awesome.  We were sat in the front being cascaded by sunshine, which was absolutely lovely.  The food was delicious.  The coffee was strong and our cups were constantly filled. The service was perfect.  Our server was very friendly and attentive, which I know constantly filling up 7 coffee cups can be a bit daunting. He brought our bill and we promptly gave him cash and waited for our change.   This is where the experience completely changed for us. From the time we were sat at our table until this point was probably about 45 minutes - a perfect allotment of time for brunch.  As we are waiting for our wonderful server to bring back our change, we were just finishing up our coffees and chatting.  Then, the owner comes up.   She inquires how everything was, we all respond it was fantastic. Then, she asks us if we got our bill, we replied that we had.   She goes on to throw her arms up in the air and exclaim, ""Great!  Well, I've got people to feed!""  - encouraging us to get up and leave.  Before we can say anything, she abruptly marches away. Well. We in no way took our time lingering at our table after we were finished eating.  We were just waiting for our change.  And to be hurried off like that is pretty unacceptable.  We understand it's a busy restaurant - we're not going to dominate a prime table for an excessive period of time.   I understand that her sass may be part of the culture and I appreciate it- but the way she handled the situation was just rude. We had a wonder meal and a great time and she came in and sort of ruined the afterglow of the experience.

The fruit compote (which were peaches) were a good little treat before the main dish.  It did take about an hour to have our meals come out, so while that was quite a long wait, the meal itself was quite yum to overlook that part as well.

I will say, it's nice to check out the bar and get a little drunk while you wait. Probably good to go if you're catching up with friends you haven't talked with in a while. The bartender was so friendly and the music was great. It was terribly crowded though, so playing games and reading the magazines was a bit uncomfortable (which I loved - cool art and photography zines and old school, classic games). Great ambiance and decor. The food and drinks were delicious - why yes, I'll have another Sassy Bitch please - it was so difficult to choose what to order because they have so much on the menu! Overall a good experience but I'll probably go back in the summer when I can wait outside and feel like spending a lot of money on brunch and booze :)",0.9726,0.738,0.207,0.055,0.6069444444444444

I've had the chilaquiles, quiche platter, and the eggs benedict with great results. The drinks are also very good.    If there was a 4.5 option, I totally would have put that down. The only reason I didn't give Tweet a 5 was because sometimes the servers rush you through your meal. I understand when it's the weekend, and there is an hour plus wait to get a table.

2013-12-17,5.0,"The food is awesome, the bloody mary is the best I've had, and the fantastic service put this place into a very short list of my favorite brunch places ever. Five of us showed up on a Saturday at around noon and had only enough time to walk over to the bar and hang our coats up before our table was ready. We were greeted at the table with some pieces of a delicious dense cake that were quickly devoured. The service arrived quickly and we had drink orders in. It was bloody marys for most of us, and the selection of 5 or so different varieties made for a difficult decision. The regular, sriracha, and wasabi varieties all ended up on our table, and I would recommend each of them depending on your taste in spiciness. The different additions to the already delicious mix gave each one a unique profile of flavor and heat that branched out from what you normally get anywhere else. If you are more exploratory, the drink menu has a lot of offerings, and the bartender was bragged about by our server for coming up with unique combinations, but it just wasn't in the books for me that day.  The food menu is large and has a lot of options from healthy to heart-stopper and from sweet to savory, and the decision was made even more difficult with some additional specialty items. My order came with a fruit cup, and it wasn't what I was expecting (in a good way). It came out early and was a big cup that included watermelon, honeydew, cantaloupe, blueberries, strawberries, banana, blackberries, and raspberries. All of the fruit was delicious and tasted fresh even in the middle of December. The variety was much greater than I am used to getting with a side order fruit, and nothing was soggy like it had been sitting around for much longer than the time it took to put in our order and bring it out to us. Being on vacation, a healthy main dish was not an option so I went with the country benedict which was so good that I don't even regret putting into my body. It was composed of a biscuit cut in half, topped with sausage patties, two perfectly poached eggs, and a generous layer of sausage gravy. Along with that was a side of crispy hash browns. The portion size was just large enough that someone who likes to eat (me) could put it all down, but I was beyond the point of being comfortably full and could have easily stopped earlier and been very content. The whole meal was delicious and seemed on par or better than I would expect for the $12 price tag. The service that we had, and I regret not being able to remember the guys name, was as good as any I've had. It was busy and the food and drinks were certainly not coming out at a record pace by any means, but his personality was awesome and he had us all laughing while making sure to cover all the bases of getting us what we needed. Being able to make recommendations for both food and drink goes a long way in a restaurant with a large menu, and I'm pretty sure he knew all the details about every dish and could make sure you got what you were looking for. From my own experience, I think he saved me from ordering a drink first thing that day that would have been higher on the Scoville scale than I actually had a taste for, and I appreciate that.

2013-12-15,2.0,"Tweet easily has the ability of getting 4 or even 5 stars but the owner /manager, whomever she is, quickly eroded that possibility. Let's start with the good because that's how things began... The Good The food was excellent and our waiter Rex was phenomenal. He alone made our experience at Tweet great. He was very personable and made us feel right at home. Despite being one of his final tables for the afternoon, we felt like his first. The hush that descended on the table after our food quickly arrived was an indication of how good it was.  The Bad We were seated at 2:30 with our final friend arriving at 2:45. The owner passed by and politely informed us that the kitchen was closing at 3 PM so we needed to order quickly. We obliged but her niceness didn't last for long. At approx 3:30, she told us we needed to ""shovel our food down"" because they were closing.  The Ugly At around 3:45, as our waiter was tallying our bill while chatting with us, she swooped down on us and said, ""Ok, ya'll really need to finish because you're the last ones in here and we are closed."" Note that the table next to us literally just finished and got up. Rex noted he was preparing our check to which our gracious host replies, in what seemed to be a joking manner, ""Well Lord knows how long that will take... you know public school education. I may need to help you."" As a product of a public school education, her comment was rude and offensive. At this point, we were annoyed and quickly grabbed our items to pay at the cashier. He asked if we were ok and we told him no, pointing to the owners behavior as the culprit. He seemed completely indifferent and even laughed. We were done.  In short, if you're into good food but being treated poorly, Tweet is the place for you!",0.9859,0.765,0.157,0.078,0.4779866332497912

For breakfast the biscuits and gravy are one of my go-to picks, serves with a side of their crispy hash browns if I'm feeling extra carby. Other favorites of our table are also the various Benedict's or the larger-than-your-arm breakfast burrito.  For lunch I love to split the Cobb salad. It's too big to eat alone.

However, it was nearly TWO HOURS before we were seated.  Now, when someone says an hour, I can understand anything between :45 and 1:15.  However, as a group of three, we were particularly miffed that a LOT of groups of 4 people, who clearly came in after we did, were seated before we were.  And, I'm not making this up or guessing -- at one point, I went up to check to ensure we hadn't been missed, and the entire sheet of paper that had our name on it was crossed out, and names onto the next sheet were crossed, but we were still listed along with two other tables of three.  Now, I can understand that the restaurant can make more money by sitting groups of three ONLY at tables with three seats, and not four, but our experience in having such a long wait made the whole thing rather annoying.  Maybe they are just so busy that they don't care about the customer experience, but I'll be significantly less likely to go back, just because of this experience.  Which is too bad.",-0.5856,0.903,0.051,0.046,0.4506944444444445

When we finally got seated, we were pleasantly surprised with complimentary coffee cake placed on our table.  There was also a basketful of toys and complimentary bananas for my little godson.  Nice touch Tweet, greatly appreciated.  For food, my friends ordered the Portland omelet and the crab cake benedict, while I ordered the gluten-free pumpkin pancakes.  With each entrée, it was accompanied with a cup of fresh fruits.  The fruits were really sweet; tastes like it was just picked from a garden out back.  For my pumpkin pancakes, they were delicious.  It doesn't taste gritty like other gluten-free subbed entrees. Overall, my friends and I had a delightful time at Tweet.  The waiter was nice and a ball to joke around with.  The only thing I have to complain about is that everything was really cluttered.  The tables were so close to each other that we could hear everything the group next to us was talking about and the table had so many condiments that it was hard to put our entrees on the table.  Thanks to our waiter, he cleared most of the unused condiments off the table so we would be a little bit more comfortable.  Go check this place out, you won't regret it.",0.9976,0.745,0.24,0.015,0.5623737373737374

The boyfriend and I had no problem getting an outside table, which I definitely recommend if you stop by when the weather is nice. Our waiter was friendly and very patient when we literally could not decide what to order! Good luck here, the menu is massive and we could barely make a decision.  To start, they leave two small pieces of coffee cake on your table which is such a nice touch! Also, fantastic that they have their own blend of Intelligentsia coffee, it really hit the spot. For breakfast, after pouring over the menu multiple times, neither of us could resist ordering a breakfast burrito. They have a whole menu section JUST for breakfast burritos, we figured they had to be good. And they were, they were delicious. First, do not order this if you aren't hungry because these breakfast burritos are huge. I went with the numero dos (added chorizo) and was thrilled with my choice. The ingredients were all so fresh and the combination of veggies, beans, chorizo, cheddar, eggs was unbeatable. The boyfriend went with numero seis that had skirt steak, potatoes, etc., and came with a phenomenal chipotle mayo on the side. This was a must-add to the burritos. Overall, delicious brunch. As everyone has mentioned, cash only, but they do have an ATM inside and you're obviously reading reviews that provide this info...so bring cash!

Got a response and they use Udi's breads, Food for Life English Muffins, and Pamela's pancake/baking mix. IN CASE YOU NEEDED TO KNOW. All of which I can consume! Awesome! Last time, I had the GF eggs benedict. My sister and I were stuck on the red line (it was Pride Sunday, I should have known better) and had my friend order for us. By the time we got there our food was already out. Seriously crazy. I think most of the regular clientele was at the parade, so we had the run of the place. Today was a little more typical, I think. It took about 45 minutes to get a table for 4 (we drank free coffee and water and played Uno on the back porch. Yes, they have cards and board games). The hostess was extremely friendly when I went to check how many tables were between us and being seated. Once we were seated, we had a really great/kind server, despite him seeming a little overworked. He made sure to come back and tell us the status of our food a couple of times. Probably another 45 minutes for the food, but the little fruit cups and breakfast pastries helped my gluten (and pineapple) eating friends (yes, I am also allergic to pineapple). I ended up with the gluten free waffle, a side of bacon, and split a side of hash browns with my friend. Surprisingly inexpensive and all of it was delicious. Two other friends had the breakfast burrito, neither of which could finish it. I think it might have been bigger, and certainly denser, than your typical Chipotle burrito. Third friend had the arepas and enjoyed. If the gluten free menu was less extensive it would probably be four stars, but the menu is RIDICULOUS and I haven't gotten sick from any of it, which is great.

Here however, I had so many unique options it took me longer than my meat eating bf to decide what to order. Final decision: Hot-Hot-Hot Bloody Mary and the Santa Fe Special with Poached Eggs. I couldn't have been happier.  The Bloody Mary was SPIIIIIIICY! For me even! But it accompanied the Spanish flavors of my meal perfectly. I was in love with the black bean, corn, pepper and spice patties. Topping them with two perfectly poached eggs and traditional saucy salsa pushed the plate over the top. The creamy egg yolks were the perfect amount of richness to even out all the spices. I loved it! The hashbrowns were classically done with griddle top crispiness on both sides and the fruit was fresh. There was so much food that I actually left with a doggie bag; a very rare sight.  My bf ordered the Wasabi Bloody Mary, and we both loved it. The perfect amount of wasabi to enlighten your sinuses. Ha! He went with the Biscuits and Gravy as his meal and love all of it as well. He said the biscuits were light and buttery while the gravy was hearty but not too rich.  We cant wait to go pack and try some other things on the menu!

We walked in and were seated immediately, even though the restaurant appeared full. The hostess was really nice. Everyone that was in the place seemed happy - lots of laughing people and cute babies. The menu is a bit overwhelming, but EVERYTHING sounded and looked delicious.  Within about five seconds of sitting down, a guy approached our table with a smile and a ""WHO WANTS COFFEE?!"" (three of the four of us did). Intelligentsia, I love you.  I got the country benedict (I think that's what it was called?) - eggs benedict on biscuits instead of English muffins and with sausage gravy instead of hollandaise. Incredible. Our friends both got the avocado eggs benedict, and my husband got the biscuits and gravy. Everything was delicious - all was seasoned well, and the hash browns were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I loved that the server brought our fruit cups out before the breakfast was served. Such a nice touch!  I'm not vegetarian/vegan/g-f, but I have a lot of friends that are and I always appreciate and make a note of places that have options for those that are on diets or have allergies or whatever.

2013-07-21,5.0,"My First Five-Star Review for a Sunday Morning Brunch! As a gourmet chef myself, I know a mediocre offering before I taste and then refuse it, good food when I've enjoyed it...exceptional food when I rarely come across it in a restaurant setting. Tweet as it turns out, is the real deal friends. First, everything is fresh or freshly prepared, even the complimentary sponge cake they serve with breakfast was top shelf. Next, the coffee is a religious experience as for one thing...it's actually the proper temperature of +/- 190 degrees! I drink Jamaican Blue Mountain at home, so this part of my meal was a very pleasant surprise as their house blend was wonderfully flavorful with just the right amount of strength and full body flavor. I ordered a plate of corn beef hash and two eggs, which in a word was flawlessly prepared as I requested, served piping hot, and with a wonderful fruit cup and all the fixings.  I arrived at the restaurant before it opened and was quite shocked to see that just before nine, the sidewalk began filling up with apparently repeat patrons waiting for the joint to open...now I know why. By the time, I left my car and walked  to reception at four minutes past nine, the place was beginning to become mobbed...which now I find far from surprising. While I'm no psychic or medium...I predict great things for this boutique eatery.  P.S. This restaurant also featured the best service I've had since my last meal at Jean & Giorgetti's...which as anyone familiar with that fine establishment knows...is no easy feat.

I think the spot is great however the bathroom is like its still 2 AM/Big Chicks.   I have to question all of the gluten free/organic things on the menu.  Its not even an option to avoid it if you want!  I suspect this is marketing so they can mark up the costs.  I did find it a tad expensive for breakfast but everyone does get that fruit cup starter and some coffee cake to snack on. I tried a cocktail which was good.  So good I would have ordered another if I had been asked. I found the menu to be overwhelming.  I went with the recommended pumpkin pancakes which were good.  Were they $8.50 good?  I dunno.  I couldn't tell if they were pumpkin flavored but they were cinnamon-y and moist.

So, despite the very enticing gluten free menu, I could eat eggs and a salad (which were delicious!).  I really appreciate the staff's help in finding me a meal that was safe but the menu is incredibly misleading.  Celiacs beware---cross contamination everywhere!  Clearly this is meant as a health trend.  Not safe for anyone with celiac disease or allergies.

There was already a wait, but the host was friendly and took our names down immediately.  From the list there were only 4-5 tables ahead of us.  Ambiance was lively and loud.  They offer free coffee while you wait for your table.  We were seated in a reasonable amount of time, however, it took forever for our server to come greet us and take our orders.  Since we waited a while, we were all ready to order drinks and entrees.  He did thank us for our patience.  While waiting, they did serve complimentary bite-size cakes: ours was a delicious brown sugar cake. Then we waited. And waited. And waited.  Finally we flagged down our server and asked how long it will be to get our food.  He said there were 5 tickets ahead of us and it will be about another 12 minutes.  Our food arrived 7 tickets and 20 minutes later (we kept seeing other people's plates passing us while we waited).  Hubby had to add more money to the meter since we exceeded our 2 hour limit.  This time the server did not apologize and just said that it's been crazy with Pride week.  I'd like to think any popular, decent brunch place will have the same amount of traffic and chaos regardless of events and be able to manage time and staff effectively. I did not have high hopes that the food was worth the wait, and I was right.  My Belgian waffle, though buttery and rich, was soggy and cold.  My side of bacon was also soggy and cold.  Hubby's porkchop was dry and tough.  Only our guest's eggs benedict was acceptable - he ate the whole thing, but I think it was because he was so hungry, doesn't like wasting food, and was being polite.

My first visit was only a take-out order but was so impressed by the vast vegetarian options they offer that I took my (vegetarian) friend for brunch on her birthday last memorial day. Already expecting a slight disappointment just because I knew it would be very busy due to the holiday, we arrived and of course there was a wait. We ended up waiting about an hour for a seat which was in no way inconvenient. They offer free coffee by the bar and there is plenty of space to stand so we didn't feel like we were in everyone's way.  My friend, who doesn't drink, ordered some OJ in a champagne glass to feel fancy and I just grabbed a cider from the bar while we waited. The bartender was pretty busy but never made us feel ignored while we waited to order and even gave my friend her beverage for free because of her bday! how sweet!  Then we finally got seated and didn't have to wait long at all for our server. I got hot tea which was served in a unique pot and I was presented with a large assortment of teas which I could choose from. We ordered a special to start with which had a very long name but was basically little dough balls served with maple syrup! Which was so warm and fluffy and delicious! Then I ordered a special that came with two black bean patties, eggs, and choice between 3 salsas!!! It was the best breakfast I've had hands down ever. We also got some fresh fruit and a single pancake while my friend ordered the veggie benedict. We were way too full for dessert but on our way out I made sure to tell the man at the host desk who I think was the manager how wonderful our service was and how impressed I was with our server Teddy.  As a server, I was also incredibly impressed with how much the servers helped each other out. Everyone was moving constantly filling waters and checking everyone's tables because everyone there pools their tips so it made us both feel extremely welcome knowing that everyone there considered us as their table because our tip would be everyone's tip.

For four of us, we ordered a stack of traditional pancakes, corned beef and hash, french toast and the country benedict. The best one of them all? The country benedict! I could go on about how fantastically delicious the gravy and biscuit were with the eggs and meat, but I shall resist. Though I will bid you to try it. The french toast is a fluffier version that what you get at most places and good. The pancakes were alright. The service at Tweet is really good!

We went on a Saturday morning and it was quite busy. Store policy indicates that they will only seat your entire party. No worries; the adjacent  bar provides all the essential brunch beverages you need before eating and the complimentary coffee was a nice touch!.  Caveat- the entire restaurant is CASH ONLY! Though they do have an ATM inside, not at an outrageous fee, there is a Chase bank just two blocks away.  The menu is accommodating for vegetarians, gluten-free and us omnivorous. I had the arepa pancakes with sour cream, chorizo, egg, tomato and avocado. It was great! Those savory arepa pancakes were fantastic.  The country benedict, a play on biscuits and gravy, also looked delicious, as did the homemade corned beef hash. Much like the portions, the menu is quite large, if you're like me, pretty indecisive when all the items look great, ask for a menu while you wait.

2013-02-04,5.0,"Like Tweet really needs another review (and from a suburban interloper, no less!). ;)  Except...except it managed an amazing feat. A friend used to live not far away, and suggested we go here for brunch one weekday morning. This place managed to get busy, yet still seem relaxing and inviting -- we were, in fact, invited to take our time paying up after we'd clearly finished eating. We weren't rushed out the door so they could turn over the table. Nice. It was pretty late in the morning, so the place was starting to fill up with lunch traffic. Still, we found street parking (metered) easily, and we were seated fairly quickly.  While waiting for our table, I fell in love. Not with my friend (although she's awesome); with the display of beautiful, delicate teacups and saucers in the glass case underneath the register. You may be forgiven for missing those if you're too busy focusing on the desserts above; those looked fabulous, too.  But those cups! So adorable. None of them matched; at least, that I could see. And that's what made them so charming.  When I ordered hot tea, our server brought me one of those beautiful little cups and saucers, and then brought a lovely wooden box full of tea over for me to pick out my own. All Mighty Leaf, which I appreciated -- as a big tea fan, I really get tired of places that only serve the bagged pencil shavings known as Lipton.  And then the server brought a lovely little teapot full of hot water, asked if I needed cream or sugar, and proceeded to bring out our selected brunch dishes shortly thereafter.  The food was fantastic. My friend really loved the veggie biscuits and gravy. It's one of her favorite things there. I tried the country Benedict, which is one of their house specialties. I can confidently say that both the sausage-full and sausage-less gravies were flavorful and nice; not bland or pasty, like some can be.  And dessert! We didn't have room for it, but we couldn't resist a slice of carrot cake, which we took to go. Later on, we split it. Moist, light, flavorful -- the veritable queen of carrot cakes.

She wasn't super hungry so she decided to order just french toast and coffee. Needless to say, her portion was more than enough to fill you up and kept her meal below 7 bucks.

It came with hash browns, choice of sliced tomatoes or toast (went with tomatoes to be healthy...right??), and a fruit cup (which had pineapples, strawberries, blueberries and blackberries in addition to the customary melon and cantaloup). You should definitely be warned that some of their specialties give you more than enough food so if you are into splitting, it might not be a bad idea to share your meal.

2013-01-01,5.0,"Tweet came highly recommended- it's my sweetie's favorite brunch spot, and the reviews seem pretty good.  So we had to stop by when in town, and I am very glad we did. Interesting eclectic decor, a big menu with lots of options, a welcoming atmosphere and friendly service.  So, off to a good start.  Since we were taking the train, and had no responsibilities, we started off with drinks.  She had a mimosa, which I tried- OJ and champagne, a good breakfast drink.  I had a ""smoking hot"" Bloody Mary, with sriracha.  I still say the tomato juice, plus the veggies in it and my fruit cup, made for a healthy breakfast.  I could stick to that story if that were all I had... But I followed it with the country benedict: biscuit, sausage patties, sausage gravy, a beautifully poached egg, beside hash browns.  Typically I would add hot sauce to something like that (and there were several on the table,) but the heat from the drink balanced things out nicely. Sweetie had French toast, massive slabs of good bread done just right.  It's easy to make French toast wrong, but this was expertly done.   The place is not huge, and the food's good, so I can see how it could get packed most times.  We went in the early afternoon on a weekday, and it was about 3/4 full.",0.9835,0.763,0.19,0.048,0.6253015873015874

I had the Veggie Biscuits and Gravy, which was blah.  I feel like other items would have been much better choices, but this entree was less than OK.  I didn't really like the bland flavor of the gravy (it really is just better with sausage) and it actually made the biscuits seem dryer, if that's even possible.   My mom got some kind of chilequiles entree and also thought it was blah. The entire dish was soaked in salsa, which just covered up the taste of everything else and made the eggs and toast all soggy.   Everything else on the menu looked great and the drinks were so good that I don't want to write Tweet off just yet.  I will definitely be back since the service was stellar, the outdoor patio was really great on a cool fall day and their other entrees look delicious.",0.996,0.677,0.28,0.044,0.5467261904761905
2012-12-19,4.0,"Chicagoans appear to have an obsession with brunch--there are hundreds of options in the city that all always seem to be busy during peak hours on the weekend. Tweet was no different on a Sunday morning around 11:00 am, as it was bustling with patrons all ready to get their brunch on. We put our name in with the host when we arrived, and we were told that there was complimentary coffee at the bar where we could grab a seat and choose any of their board games to play while we waited. Luckily for my boyfriend and I, we had about a five minute wait and we were promptly seated. Tweet has a very eclectic crowd, considering it's in the heart of Uptown, bordering on Andersonville and the Vietnamese strip that is off of the Red Line Argyle stop. Considering that Tweet serves as a brunch/lunch spot during the day and is a Lesbian Dive Bar (Big Chicks) at night, makes the venue all the more interesting. There is a lot of interesting art work and loud colors, so this may not be the best place to take your conservative grandma for a post-Church Sunday brunch. Regardless, I enjoyed my trip to Tweet thoroughly. Upon being seated, the waitress filled up fresh mugs of coffee for us and allowed us to peruse the menu as we happily munched on the complimentary coffee cake. The coffee cake was dense, moist, and delicious, pairing nicely with the coffee and whetting our appetite. We put in our order as follows: 1) Chilaquiles which are made with orn tortilla strips smothered in roasted homemade tomatillo sauce topped with scramble organic eggs, cheese, organic black beans, creme fraiche, onions and peppers. Try and say that one without taking a breath! There was A LOT going on with this dish, but I loved it, and I kicked it up a delicious notch by adding the chorizo. It was a little soupy at times due to the black beans, but luckily the tortilla strips served to soak up all the flavors of the dish. This dish was incredibly massive as they threw on slices of oranges and lemons for garnish (and height?), so I found myself working around these and picking out the bites of beans, chorizo, and egg. All in all, a great signature dish. 2) Side of Hash Browns: Considering this was my first trip to Tweet and I was unaware of the massive portion sizes, I decided to add on an order of Hash Browns. The hash browns were perfectly cooked--slightly browned and crispy on the outside, and moist and hot on the inside. I dowsed them in ketchup and happily munched my way through to a carb overload.  3) Country Benedict: Fluffy biscuit cut in half, country sausage patties, two poached organic eggs smothered in amazin' sausage gravy; hash browns: I just had a small bite of this off of my boyfriend's plate, but it was delicious. But c'mon, who are we kidding? Anything smothered with sausage gravy is delicious, and Tweet took that to the extreme. I would highly recommend this based on my one sole bite! 4) Fruit Cups: Both of the plates were served with a fresh fruit cup which was exactly what you'd expect--a few pieces of melon, a strawberry, a slice of a banana, and a few other mixed berries. Light, delicious, and fresh. The service was fantastic as well, our waitress was pleasant and friendly. She was incredibly enthusiastic about our choices throughout our time there, which was odd but welcome.

My family and I came here for brunch the other day after scouring the internet for solid locations that served a multitude of options.  We've been to M Henry and Yolk and all of the other typical brunch locations but had never been here.  So... easy choice.  Tweet it was. First impression - HOLY COW! SO MANY OPTIONS FOR FOOD!  There are a large number of vegetarian and vegan choices, but if you can't complete your brunches without a plate of bacon - they've got plenty of meat selections ready and waiting.for you. After spending nearly 20 minutes trying to convince myself that I couldn't order everything off of the menu, I decided on the following: -Vegetarian Biscuits and Gravy (So hard to find this ANYWHERE these days) -Bagel and Cream Cheese -Spicy Bloody Mary -Bowl of Fruit Delicious is an understatement.   I can't tell you how absurd this sounds but... I haven't had a bagel that crispy, yet soft at the same time, since I went to New York for work a few years ago.  The entire meal was delicious and left me craving for more... but, alas, neither my stomach nor my wallet had room for more. The only downfall of a place like this is that if you have a party of 3 or more, you have to wait FOREVER to get a seat.  I won't knock any points for that, however, because that's how it is every Sunday - no matter where you go for brunch.  If you put your name in, you can wait at the bar and order drinks if you'd like. ::::::::::::::::THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW:::::::::::::: -THIS RESTAURANT IS CASH ONLY -Close to the Red Line -Easy Parking on Argyle nearby -Get there early on the weekends ::::::::::::::::FINAL VERDICT:::::::::::::::: -Good Food -Great Service -Hard to get a seat right away on the weekends -Order a Bagel on the side.",0.9894,0.818,0.139,0.043,0.5072510822510823

Unfortunately, I can't eat eggs in omelets or anything like that, so I am usually relegated to the pancake and waffle section of the brunch menu. Tofu makes a tasty egg substitute, but not too many places offer it as an option. I was super stoked when I saw not just one but a handful of dishes featuring tofu in everything from burritos to scrambles. Awesome!  The portions at Tweet are HUGE (I think my meal came with a fruit cup and home fries, and I was also offered corn tortillas to go with my scramble), and for what you get, the prices are reasonable. It's not very often that you can satisfy your vegan, gluten free, vegetarian, and carnivorous friends all in one spot. The venue is a little loud and the waiting area procedure is a little confusing, but the people dining as well as the employees were all very friendly and patient in regards to the commotion. I think they even had free coffee (and board games!) in the bar if you had to wait awhile. As some reviewers mentioned, they won't seat your party until everyone is present, but since there is usually a wait on the weekends, this wasn't a big deal since it took everyone in a group a while to arrive.

The fresh fruit cups were great, but the complimentary coffee cake I could go without.  We did love the brunch cocktails, though!  Mimosa and peach mimosa were equally delicious. The worst part of the experience luckily didn't happen at my table. At the table next to us, a women ordered something gluten free and ended up with something containing gluten in her meal. The person I'm assuming was the manager apologized and got her new food, as well as comped both meals I think. So the situation was handled as well as it could have been.

So, here's the deal: they will not seat you until your entire party is present, no exceptions. Our table came up and one person was trying to find parking outside-- no dice. We lost the table and ended up having to wait another half hour. Go there knowing this important rule! Waiting was fun though-- you get to wait in the adjoining bar where complimentary coffee and tea is offered and you get to sit in a funky, loud scene that buzzes with great energy-- what a vibe! The music was fun and blaring, the place was packed like a bar at midnight, filled with artsy, spirited people. Offering free coffee and playing fun music really makes a crowd perfectly happy to wait, I must say. We sort of loved our time there! Finally, we got a table. The menu is lengthy and filled with fabulous-sounding dishes including a ton of different kinds of benedicts. We got California Benedicts with fruit compote and bacon. The compote was chilled and served in darling little dessert cups (loved that touch). My issue is this: the hollandaise is truly bad. We all agreed at a large table that it was nasty-- there's no citrus added to cut the richness, and it was a pale peach color so it looked exactly like that nacho cheese you get at a movie theater. It ruined the entire dish for every one of us as none of us could stomach it.  I wish I had listened to my friend who recommended the Chilaquiles.

I normally would have doubted that but I totally witnessed it for myself. Then when we finally got seated I asked the host that was filling our water if they had a grilled chicken. He said that he was not sure and in depth conversations need to be held with my server!  Who knew a simple question was considered in depth. Either you do or don't have one. Then the only reason why I came here was for their sweet potato fries. Well they don't use the fryer on the weekend!!!  Apparently they only offer them on days when they use the fryer.

Since I was having breakfast with two people that eat meat, I figured this would be a great breakfast spot. Plus I was curious about their veggie sausage.  I know I'm aiming to be adventurous but I wanted pancakes, which I know aren't adventurous. I figured I'd be coming back again so I went with something boring. I ordered the buttermilk pancakes which were delicious along with the veggie sausage patties. I had asked the server if I should order the links or the patties and she was emphatic that the patties were good. If I could come to Tweet every morning for just pancakes and veggie sausage, I would. This breakfast occurred almost two weeks ago so I don't remember all the details.

My brother told me it was ""right up my alley"", and he was right.

I also got a fruit cup, which ""Rex"", our waiter, brought out before our food arrived. My brother ordered a ""Build your own"" and got the gluten free pumpkin pancakes, and my friend ordered the Corn Arepas  and coffee with chorizo which he and my brother really enjoyed.

No. Expect to wait over 45 minutes to get a table, be served quickly, and asked to leave before you finish because they have people waiting. If you're a paying customer, you're a paying customer. I hate places that have a bottom line in mind over customer satisfaction. I just ordered food, a side, and a drink, if you have people waiting...that's your problem, learn how to manage. Don't offer liquor if you aren't prepared to manage what comes along with it. It has been proven that people who order mimosas actually stay to enjoy them. Typically, they don't leave halfway through their meal so the 45 other people waiting can have a better experience. Chances are you can probably get up and leave without paying...I'd like to see someone chase you down the street when there are so many people waiting to be seated.

While we were sitting outside, one of the umbrellas came unhinged in front of us and I caught it mid-flight, keeping it from hitting a few tables and several patrons.  Not even a thank you; although the busboy said ""good catch"" -- but I would think we deserved a slice of Red Velvet cake on the house for that at least if not the terrible service and extreme wait. We may go back to see if it was just an off-day, but being that it is cash-only and the ATM charges $3.00 (srsly, it is called ""tweet"" complete with a blue bird logo and has no CC machine??) we probably won't.",-0.3264,0.841,0.076,0.083,0.46512345679012346
2012-03-18,2.0,"Don't get me wrong, the food is amazing. Very eclectic menu that will suit multiple diets. I've been here 3 times and always gotten the Veggie Country Benedict. However, my partner and I recently went on a very busy Sunday. We waited for a table for 45 minutes, which was completely expected and fine. Everything was going great until the check came.  One of our servers (we had 4, which did get chaotic) asked that we pay ""up front."" About 2 seconds later, server #4 came and offered to take our check. We hadn't had time to get our wallets out, but she impatiently stood there and waited until we got out our money. She asked if we wanted change, and we said, ""yes."" (Meanwhile,  server #3 came twice and tried to take my partner's drink, which he was clearly not finished with.) Fast forward about 6-7 minutes later, sever #4 never came back. My partner went to check on her so that we could leave ( my parking meter was running out after the long wait.)  As soon as my partner left, a lady (who I'm pretty sure is the owner, I'm not sure) came over to me with a big list of names and stated, ""Are you okay? You know we have a lot of people waiting."" Excuse me?? I politely explained to her that server #4 never brought our change. That seemed to be an acceptable answer for me to be allowed to sit at the table another 2 minutes. No apology, no offer to correct the situation. I really will not tolerate waiting 45 minutes for my own table, paying $40 for brunch, and then being rushed out the door and literally asked leave as soon as I set my fork down. If you aren't prepared for your weekly brunch rush, you probably shouldn't be open. Just sayin'. P.S. My partner did come back with the change about 30 seconds after my interaction with the owner.

They also have free coffee and ice water for those who wait, which is a plus.  One of my friends brought her 8 year old son, and as soon as we were seated at our table, they gave him a huge kit with crayons, books, trivia games, etc. to keep him entertained. We were impressed!

I thought that cream cheese was a little bit peculiar, but our waitress said that it was delicious, so I tried it....wow. The cream cheese on the omelette was the thing that took it over the top.  They also serve fruit cups with many of the dishes, and the fruit cup is not one of those gross cafeteria-style assortments of fruit that might have been sitting there for a few days. This fruit was freshly cut that day, and they gave a decent portion as well. One of my friends ordered the french toast, and it was fantastic. The bread was nice and thick, and it was seasoned with cinnamon, and a touch of sea salt. #Winning! I'm getting the french toast the next time I go. I ordered some hot tea, and they brought out the tea in such a lovely tea cup - it was real china - and the tea pot was adorable too! I just love the details.

2011-12-17,1.0,"So we got here on a Saturday morning at 10 am. It was CROWDED. No big deal. Most good brunch places are.  The hostess tells us its a 40 minute wait. I wasn't too happy about that but given that there is literally NO other option close by, I decided to get a drink at the bar and wait it out. My girlfriend and I got lost in conversation but were reminded by the rumbling in our tummies that we hadn't gotten a table yet. Then i started staring at the clock.  45 minutes. I started whining. My poor girlfriend started to feel bad. I was antsy and started looking around. The decor left a lot to be desired. Everything was old and creaky. The bar counter was kinda filthy. 1 hour. My girlfriend starts getting antsy. We consider leaving, but decided that instead of trekking back to lakeview would take us at least another 20 minutes and surely we had to be the next person in line.  1 hour 30 minutes. I was gonna pass out from the claustrophobia of standing in a waiting room that had 10 times as many people as it should.  1 hour 45 minutes. FINALLY they called our names! We sat down ready to order a feast. However a look at the menu was absolutely underwhelming. Everything was so... ummm.. ordinary. I ordered the biscuits and gravy and my girlfriend ordered an omelet. The food arrived rather quickly and i dug right in. I was NOT impressed. I have had better biscuits at Popeyes. And the gravy was mediocre at best. My girlfriend reported that her omelet was MEH! In short, it was the most traumatizing brunch experience i have ever had and rest assured will NEVER go back again.

We arrived at Tweet on a Sunday morning after celebrating my sister in laws birthday.  Everyone was in need of a drink and some comfort food to get the day started off right.  We thought that we arrived to Tweet early enough to avoid a wait, however we still ended up waiting around a 30 minutes.  Warning number one-if you don't want to wait, get there early...and by early I mean like 9am.   However, if you are lucky enough to be there at 11am, that is when the bar opens.  Their garnish laden Bloody will cure what ails you on  Sunday morning or my husbands personal crutch, the Beermosa (Blue Moon and Orange Juice).   As far as breakfast goes, I have a couple suggestions.  If you like Eggs Benedict step outside your comfort zone and order the Crabcakes Hollandaise (think minus English muffin and add crab cakes).  I am a sucker for early morning carbs so I suggest the blueberry pancakes with blueberry syrup.   My husband barely finished eating the Numero Uno breakfast burrito, because it was enormous!  However, from what I tasted with the little bit I was able to steal it was super tasty.  It was basically a  ham and cheese omelet conveniently wrapped to make it easy finger food.  It comes with a homemade salsa my husband was obsessed with, pico, and compote.   Finally, I would be remiss if I don't take a moment to applaud Tweet for also being responsible to foodies everywhere.  They use cage-free eggs, hormone/antibiotic free meats and dairy, and local vegetables and fruit.  It always makes me happy when I can eat out the way I prefer to eat at home, so often restaurants choose cheep supplies over healthy/quality supplies.

Great vibe throughout this charming space. Lots of visual stimulation from random hanging art or simply the diverse crowd clanking mimosas and bloody marys. This place has an awesome soundtrack. Definitely not for those looking for a quiet cafe atmosphere. The service was good but the food was better. I ordered a colorful plate of arepas that blew me away. We had a party of 6 and enjoyed the experience until the very end when the hostess rudely rushed us to pay because people were  waiting.

On Sunday we were asked to clear out our table in the absolute nicest way I have ever been asked that, and only after we had finished our meal, gotten the bill, and were still sitting there (I was waiting to ask if a server could take our picture).  Everything I tried was very good. The pumpkin pancakes themselves were exquisite and the cinnamon sugar topping just made them even better. We tried another seasonal special, ableskiver (Danish donuts). These were very good but more of a novelty to me - I probably wouldn't get them again. The arepa dish was delicious. The least impressive items, I thought, were the omelettes. There wasn't anything too special about them and somehow I wasn't crazy about the options of add-ins that there were. I also liked how good all the fruit was, both in the fruit plates and with the entrees. Especially the blueberries! I appreciate they make sure to use quality ingredients.

It's not life altering breakfast food though, so I'd cap my max wait at 30 minutes if would have had to wait. Food: Ordered Burrito Numero Cuatro and Pumpkin Pancakes.  The burrito is simple  - eggs, black beans, avocado, and chihuahua cheese - but delicious and ginormous.  The eggs were cooked perfectly - soft and fluffy.  The spicy salsa that accompanied the burrito was extremely flavorful. The pumpkin pancakes were amazing.  Again, perfectly cooked and spiced. The fruit compote that came with it was tasty as well. Service: Super friendly service.  Waitress was chatty and fun.  She seemed to know everybody else sitting around us and made every effort to get to know us without ever being annoying. Ambiance: A little cramped with the tables basically right next to each other, but the place has such a friendly atmosphere that everyone seems to enjoy chatting with each other.  Board games and Where's Waldo books are available for those who have to wait (or like me who choose to play while eating...).

I let that go due to the place being really busy, which really shouldn't matter. The food was very good and the service was friendly and Tweet has killer bloody mary's of various kinds in huge tiki glasses. The first time I went I had the danish blue cheese omelet. It was tasty but a bit overpowering - I should have known based on the cheese.  I did like the fact that when you sit down you get two small pieces of delicious coffee cake to tie you over.  You also get a fresh fruit cup or fruit compote (actual cooked fruit, not that rooty tooty fresh and fruity iHop compote crap). The second time around my wife and I went on a Saturday morning and only had to wait about 20 minutes. We were directed to the free coffee (a nice bonus for waiting customers) or the bar that's connected called 'Big Chicks.' We really wanted a bloody mary (all the drinks with liquor come from Big Chicks) so we each got one made with siracha.  We chatted up the bartender and sucked down these ridiculously tasty and huge bloody's. They are a bit pricey at $7.50 but they are worth it.   I do need to mention that the owner/hostess is very very friendly and accommodating. She really does a little bit of everything, from checking people in at the desk to seating people to taking checks to cleaning tables and asking people how their food is.  Being greeted so warmly is a nice way to start off your meal. Since it was such a nice day we sat outside and ordered the house made corned beef hash and eggs and some scrambled egss withe their house salad and house dressing.  We also got some compote this time, which was a nice surprise. Chunks of cooked fruit had a nice flavor and texture. The food itself did take a long time and it seems that the kitchen is a bit slow. However, a couple that came in 20 mins after us got their food shortly after ours so perhaps it was our server. I had the same guy the first time I came to Tweet, so maybe he's slow.  A nice guy and attentive, perhaps he just leaves the food in the kitchen too long. The food was really excellent and I scarfed down my hash and eggs. My wife really enjoyed my breakfast as well and was impressed with the house dressing used for the salad.  We thoroughly enjoyed our time here with the nice October weather and are looking forward to coming back soon.

I also think it's fantastic they had interesting & different vegetarian & vegan options (veggie biscuits & gravy, Bib Im Bop, tofu scramble).  We had to wait about 1/2 hour for a table to open up. But in Chicago, just about any brunch spot has a wait between 9-1 on the weekends anymore. Once seated, I really liked the fun, festive vibe of the place. Next time I'm hungover, this is where I'll go. Order some hair of the dog and let the busy, noisy, fun atmosphere knock that hangover right out of ya. My friend & I ordered up a bloody mary and it was really good. It was just a tad spicy and came loaded with lots of stuff - just the way I like it. It took us awhile to decide on what to order, but we were not rushed at all. There were too many good sounding things on the menu to make a hasty decision. But in the end, we both went with one of the specials which was their homemade black been burger with avocado, salsa, and eggs on top. It was fan-freaking-tastic. I'm much more of a savory then sweet person, and when you combine three of my favorite foods - eggs, beans, and avocado, you've pretty much won me over. And if I recall correctly, you also get a fresh fruit cup to start and it had a good variety of fresh, yummy fruit. Bonus! Overall the service was A-Okay. Our server did mix up one of our orders but brought it back and promptly brought out the right thing. On the way out when we were paying, the owner (or one of them) also made a point to ask how our meal was and if we enjoyed our experience.

We got to Tweet during church hours, so it wasn't as busy [though by the end of our meal there was a nice waiting list]. We were greeted by a friendly staff which extended to our server; he was great. To my surprise, the meal started before it even began...they bring out a nice breakfast pastry-thing.

Fresh with various melons and berries, the fruit was a pleasant start to what eventually was a great breakfast. The girlfriend ordered the crab cake benedict. I thought it was [summoning my inner Derek Zoolander] really really really, ridiculously delicious. The crab cake was arguably the best I've ever had. The hollandaise, as my girlfriend said, was a little mustardy, though it didn't bother me much. With her benedict came a generous portion of hash browns...cooked to perfection.

Our host (possibly one of the proprietors?) was delightful and made the suggestion of having iced coffee on the hot Saturday afternoon, and I couldn't help but agree.  She added and cream and sugar to it, per my request, and brought it out to me in a carafe, in addition to my already full cooler glass.  How incredibly smart!  I've had iced coffees at places in the past and they always need to take your glass away to refresh it with ice and liquid energy before handing it back; this was a greatly welcome difference.

I was debating what I wanted to eat, so asked my boyfriend to order first since I needed just a minute more.  Our server, sensing my frantic rush, asked my boyfriend questions as slowly as possible, then repeated everything back to him (""So, white toast?  ""And you want the Portland Omelette... with white toast...?"") to give me as much time as possible, which my boyfriend didn't catch on to until afterwards when I had made up my mind and started laughing. :) Overall, the ONLY thing that gave us a reason to frown this visit was that the bf had to wait about 20 minutes for a coffee refill (he had hot coffee).  Other than that, it was great and we both look forward to coming here more often in the future.",0.9963,0.81,0.165,0.026,0.506904761904762

It was black forest cake and was just as delicious as the brunch even though we were all completely stuffed. The portions are huge and prices pretty reasonable for all of the food that you get. They make their foods organic, cage free, etc. where possible. That was a huge plus for me.  The fruit is fresh, delicious and a great variety. I think that everyone gets one with their meal.

Yeah, it's a heart attack on a plate, but my birthday only comes once a year! The food was excellent--probably the best biscuits and gravy I've had since I've been in Chicago. The biscuits had a great flavor and were fluffy--not dense or greasy. The sausage was organic and also full of flavor. The hash browns were hot and crispy; the only thing missing was a bit of melted cheddar cheese on top (hey, why not?). The addition of tomato and orange slices on the side made the meal feel slightly healthier. ;-)  The staff was great as well.

I had the special arepas with chorizo, black beans, guajillo sauce, avocado, creme fraiche, cilantro, and oh yeah 2 eggs. Now, arepas are supposed to be cornmeal savory pancakes the size of a coaster. These were full out flapjacks the size of a salad plate with corn and green onions thrown in the batter. Not what mama had in mind, but very tasty. I asked for my eggs scrambled, which apparently means an omelet with nothing in it. All other ingredients were heaped on top, except for the chorizo and the black beans, which were served on the side.  Now, I love me some cilantro but I've said it before and I'll say it again: don't serve me the whole freaking stem of it. I'm not a brontosaurus, pull the leaves off please and discard the stems. Still, it was fresh, and the avocado slices were ripe. The guajillo sauce was not bad (I didn't feel the need for supplementary hot sauce) and the chorizo was well seasoned and not too greasy! But way more than I could possibly eat, and honestly the mammoth portion staring at me like a brunchy volcano took away my appetite a bit.

The cream cheese omelet was overcooked. The hash browns weren't seasoned. The fruit cup was yummy though...I really enjoyed that.

First of all, when you get seated at the table by the host, you get a full glass of water, and a free cup of coffee that isn't crap.  The two first things I want when experiencing a hangover.  And they give you a plate with pastry bites thats FREE!

There were 5, not 2 or 3 but 5! kinds of hot sauces on the table.   All ready, I am hooked.  The ambience was cute and warm.   The waiters/waitresses were amazing and nice to look at!  Another plus!    The menu was pretty vast and it had many different kinds of eggs benedict, a thing I look for when trying to find a great brunch spot. I am somewhat of a eggs benedict connoisseur, it is my most ultimate favorite meal! I always order eggs benedict at every brunch place with hollandaise on the side(trust me it is the way to order eggs benedict..especially a new brunch place you've never been to).   I ordered the crab cake eggs benedict.  It was delicious.  The hollandaise sauce was phenomenal but it is quite rich, with a hint of lemon- (order it on the side due to its richness). My boyfriend ordered the chilaquiles and he said it was wonderful.    We also ordered Bloody Marys- they make their own mix.  It was great!   Not as great as Wishbones, (in my opinion) but I did order the Ecstasy which is the hottest- habanero, sriracha, and wasabi(maybe I ordered it too spicy?).  My boyfriend ordered the Wasabi and he said it was the best Bloody Mary he ever had.  So I would suggest ordering the Wasabi Bloody Mary.  And they serve it in a Tiki Glass! I love it!  The portions are generous, you definitely feel satisfied when you leave.  The bathrooms are clean.  And I love that fact that the owner.(at least I assume she is), this older woman sits at the front by the door next to a counter filled with old tea cups....

No folks, I am not kidding.  As a matter of fact it happened AGAIN this morning as I was brunching with 4 friends and sadly enough - although it is in my neighborhood THIS time I promise I will NEVER go back.   Michelle is extremely rude - I have never experienced this hurriedness anywhere in my life - If I wait for a table for 20-30 minues then wait for my food for another 20 plus minutes - please DO NOT rush me out the door as my fork hits the plate after my last bite of food.

Luckily, this place had ample room to wait around; a huge bar area in addition to their restaurant seating area. The decor is great with incredible photography prints from well-known journalistic & documentary photographers like Diane Arbus. There's two self-serve coffee stations which is excellent if you're waiting to be seated. Upon being seated, the service was good and I love that each table gets seasoned bread and a fruit cup while waiting for their meals. I ordered something healthy, the tofu avocado burrito, whereas my friends ordered hash-browns, eggs, etc. I was surprised at the variety of choices from both savory + healthy. Kudos! Everything was tasty and I would definitely like to come back to try some egg dishes. Prices are average for good Chicago brunch spots. Not sure if this place is as good as M.

Add the fact that my GF's burrito also tasted fantastic I easily walked away thinking of the next dish I will have when I come back here.

Any restaurant that has Where's Waldo books, Mastermind and dozens of other 70's and 80's games gets major thumbs up in my book! I am going to make this simple: - Food - ehhhhh not all that great. The pancakes were kinda dry and the fresh fruit cup we got only had one banana and one strawberry. It was mostly melon....yuck! - Service was over eager and I was asked about 50 times if i wanted a refill on my coffee. My friend had been asked about her coffee just as many times and at one point the 'hostess' just filled up her cup even though she repeatedly said she didn't want a refill. I guess this is better than never getting a refill...but kind of annoying. Our waiter was decent but did take awhile to take our order.  - Prices.....WOW! This is why only 3 stars. $2.50 for a cup of coffee? It wasn't even good! I thought it might be like $1 - $1.50 so I only had one cup. Hardly worth $2.50! So 2 meals, 1 coke, 1 OJ and 1 coffee later plus tax and tip was about $38. I could have had fairly nice dinner out for two people for that price.

I think the only difference between the two was one had white vegan cheese and the other had orange vegan cheese. The rest was just bland tofu and avocado, with salsa and cilantro on the side. Virtually none of the vegetables listed existed in the burrito, and the hash browns are cooked in butter so I can't eat them. :(  I think that the real problem is this: the cook is obviously not a vegan cooking vegan food as if it contained regular-ass dairy. Vegan cheese is still not cheese, and you can't cook with it as if it were the same. Even if that new Daiya brand stuff melts and stretches, It tastes like salty crayons so please don't fill my burrito with it. A little bit is good for texture, a lot makes the burrito taste bad.

2010-08-08,4.0,"I've gone to Tweet twice now, both times under similar conditions (recovering from wicked hangovers on Sunday mornings...) The first time I came it was just the two of us. A lot of things were going right for this restaurant - we found parking right away, Big Chicks is attached (which for me served a dual purpose, to get rid of that nagging hangover headache AND have a tasty Bellini, which is hard to find in a brunch place...) and our wait lasted only 10 minutes.  The hubs ordered a wasabi bloody mary, which was good but not really my cup of... alcohol.   As we sat down the waitress handed us a plate of these little parallelogram shaped spice cakes as an appetizer.  They were tasty, but a little dry.  I placed my order for the Sundays' special which was the Corn Arepas.  It consisted of three corn arepas, which are essentially corn pancakes with jalapeño, with 2 organic eggs your way, avocado, creme fraiche, house-made sauce, black beans and the addition of chorizo for a $1.50 more, which by the way is WORTH IT.  The hubs had the country benedict with the two biscuits, sausage patties and poached eggs with a thick layer of sausage gravy and hash browns on the side.  My corn arepas dish was a home run. Filling, tasty and savory with a little kick- perfect for that Sunday morning. The other dish was pretty good too, though he did say that the sausage under the gravy was a little less than what he expected.  Worth a trip back we thought, and that trip led to today. Second time around we came with some friends. The table of 7 included duplicates of three dishes including the arepas, the country benedict and the Portland omelets which included tomatoes, bacon, cream cheese, scallions and cheddar cheese. Arepas were a hit, country benedicts fared well, and the Portland omelets got mixed reviews.  I was one of the two that ordered the Portland omelet.  Not sure what happened here, maybe it was because they were closing down shop soon or what, but I did not enjoy this omelet at all. Ingredients were super sparse and a little bland, and the eggs were way way overcooked, which made the entire dish dry.  This was one of the worst omelets I'd ever had, I didn't even finish it.  The ingredient list sounded awesome; c'mon it had bacon and cream cheese!! Maybe it was my dish alone because the other person who ordered it had a more positive review.  All in all I would still probably come back.  I am still rating this a 4 star simply because service was good and everything else I sampled besides the omelet was good.  Next time it will be to conquer the crab cake benedict and another Bellini...",0.9926,0.845,0.117,0.038,0.4817424242424243

2010-08-03,4.0,"I'm a long way from being a brunch expert, but I know good country sausage gravy and Tweet is the place to get it.  On a bright Sunday afternoon my fiancee and I decided to head out for brunch to decompress after a busy weekend.  We got to Tweet around Noon and there was about a 30 minute wait for a table.  In hindsight, the wait was well worth the meal to come.   The fiancee and I have been long time fans of good country sausage gravy - likely a product of our affinity for the Merry Ann's Diner Stack from our days as Fighting Illini - so naturally we were drawn to dishes that featured biscuits smothered in several ladel-fulls of that tasty white concoction.  My fiancee went with Mary Lou Zelazny's Biscuits & Gravy and I went with the Country Benedict.  The Country Benedict was like Biscuits & Gravy's cousin, and featured an open faced biscuit, two flavorful breakfast sausage patties, and two poached eggs smothered in country sausage gravy, along with a side of hash browns.  The dish was gut-bustingly good and I can honestly say I was tempted to lick my plate clean.  The biscuits were uber buttery and the aforementioned gravy was rich, heavy, and perfectly seasoned just the way I like.  The hash browns were also nice and crisp, and I saved the cup of fresh fruit (which came out before the Country Benedict) as a nice, refreshing end to our meal.  My only knock (and the only reason this isn't a 5-star review) is that my poached eggs were quite overdone.  The yolks were cooked all the way through, depriving me of that runny, cholesterol-laden golden center that I was hoping to save for my last bite.  In the end there's no way in hell an overcooked yolk will keep me from coming back and I look forward to a return trip once I'm off this wedding diet.  Tweet is cash only, so make sure you hit the ATM before you stop in.",0.9949,0.744,0.194,0.062,0.5397569444444444

It was a late night yesterday so I ended up having a late brunch. I arrived with a friend at 1:30PM and there was no wait.

We were seated right away, but say inside because the clouds were dripping all morning. Seated right away and there was a nice little piece of coffee cake waiting for us.

Let's start there: DRINKS! Amazing list. We came for brunch and the 45 min. wait was delightfully spent checking out the ambiance, poking around at the art and enjoying some truly well crafted drinks. My boo had the Wasabi Bloody Mary (yum) and I picked out the Salty Dog (vodka, fresh squeezed grapefruit juice and salt rim) - yum, best cocktail I had in a long time. The fresh squeezed juice was beyond this world and the bartender even gave me a tip on where to get it straight from their purveyor. I really liked the layout of the bar and all... I'd come more often, buuut I might be giving off the wrong idear. Next: AMBIANCE. Really fresh, kitschy and cool. Liked the vibe a lot. Tons of boobs on the wall was sweet and ironic (I get irony). It was drizzling but I snuck out to check out the patio and it looked like an amazing place to share a couple summer drinks with friends. Lots o' birds around. I get that too. FOOD. One of the better brunches I've had. We got the Chilaquiles (yum... maybe needed a bit more cheese) and the Crab Cake Benedict, which was incredibly fresh and delicious. Well done. The menu looked phenomenal... just packed with great treats. I'd like to try more if I can get past the Chilaquiles... which I can't. SERVICE. Awesome, attentive, peppy, nice. From the bar staff to the servers to the owner who greeted us at the door. Top notch and I truly appreciate that. Any downsides? Well, the wait was a touch long, but that just goes to show we picked the right spot. The price is a little rich for brunch, but that just means they use the best ingredients. So really, the ONLY gripe I had with the place is that they're cash only. I know it goes with the kitschyness of the place, but I hate that places are still cash only. Granted, a little foresight will help next time but I think it's rude to make your customers pay $5 or more to get cash out of an ATM. Just my two cents (so that's $5.02 total). Tweet tweet tweet.

I met 2 friends and a toddler for brunch, and we pretty much had the place to ourselves. The staff was super-friendly and gave us plenty of time to look at the menu while running our mouths. The portions? Holy hell, so big! I had the lox plate that came with a bagel the size of my head (and quite tasty), lox, cream cheese (duh), olives, cucumbers, tomatoes, and a large fruit assortment. I also had hash browns with my lox plate (it came with!) and I love love LOVED them! I like my hash thin and crispy and Tweet didn't disappoint.  One of my dining companions had the quiche..again with the large fruit assortment, and, a croissant which no one really understood. Quiche and croissant? Seems like overkill, but, at least it was good. My other friend has hummus..again, huge serving of food.  They have a great drink selection, and my greyhound with FRESH grapefruit juice (only way to have it) was delicious. Their prices are a bit higher than what I consider to be upscale diner food, but, you definitely get your money's worth.

For starters, my friend and I ended up here after a rough night and morning. Also, it was our third pick for breakfast, as #1 was closed and #2 was too far.  I read many good reviews here on good ol' Yelp, so I was excited. At press time, over 400 reviews and 4.5/5 stars. Must be fantastic! I also loved the idea of mostly organic food and ""uncaged eggs"" (Hormone and antibiotic-free!). Upon arriving, I was very pleased. The atmosphere is awesome! I expected a wait, and we were told we had time for a cocktail. That was simply not gonna happen, so I had some of the complimentary coffee. We were told that the patio out back was open, so we went out there. It's adorable! We came back inside to get seated, and with a ""here you go, you wild women!"" (Oh she don't even KNOW.) we were led to a table...which we shared with three other randoms. Uh. Cute place, lots of birds around (Tweet. Get it. Birds. Tweet tweet.) and a big picture of our president above the doorway. Had ""Sexual Healing"" and then ""Love Train"" come on the stereo...perfect ambiance. Our server, whose name I couldn't catch and couldn't really read from our receipt, was a doll. She was so peppy, happy and attentive. So, the food. Huge menu, and very customizable. I wanted eggs with hot sauce so bad, so I dunno why I ordered the burrito numero cinco, with added eggs (It doesn't come with them.). It was very healthy: brown rice, black beans, avocado and tofu all wrapped up in a flour tortilla and served with two salsas and sour cream. I devoured that baby with as much hot sauce as it could handle. It was delicious and kept me full all day. I also had a side of chicken sausage, which was pretty good, but kinda greasy. The coffee is very good as well. Oh, and the fruit cup=da bomb. Y'know how most fruit cups you get are just honeydew, cantaloupe and like, two grapes? Well. I hate honeydew and cantaloupe. This cup has those (urgh) BUT it also has pineapple, strawberries, a raspberry, a blueberry, a blackberry and a slice of banana. THANK YOU. Next time, I'd try the Havarti omelette.

2010-04-07,1.0,"Of all the places I ate in Chicago, this was the most disappointing. OK for all those who raved about the fruit bowl --- are you guys from a 3rd world country or something?!? It was NOT fresh, NOT sweet, nothing about it was special at all except that it came in a lil cute bowl. It wasn't even cold fruit! I was seriously like WAT THE F when I got the fruit bowl. ALSO, this place is ALL ABOUT AMBIANCE. The food is something below average. So I'm amazed that it has so many stars!  I swear the people are raving about the cutesy environment and the sweet service (which I agree with) but purely based on FOOD this place is pretty terrible.  My eggs benedict with biscuits and gravy tasted SO BAD. The sausage was rock hard and about 2 inches thick. My gravy sauce tasted really bland and heavy. It needed about a teaspoon of pepper and something else. The eggs were just ok, not super fluffy or anything special.  The hash browns (which I usually LOVE) were so gross! They were fried weird and the crunch parts tasted stale and brittle. It tasted like the scrapings of yesterday's burnt leftovers that was left out overnight. The best part of my breakfast was the toast... which was just... toast. My friend's omlette and salad was SOO whatever. She barely finished it.  The eggs were nothing special. So disappointing! We were also told that the wait was 40 minutes, but we waited for about an hour & a half in the stuffy crowded room full of people.  They won't let you stand anywhere else. People are really sneaky about wanting to sit, so claim a seat if you can find one! I think they were pretty smart about offering free coffee and having the ""waiting area"" the bar area so people will buy drinks while they wait. They also have a bunch of board games to play, but er... NO SPACE to play it! We were elbow to elbow with people. Yes, the people are darling and the decor is fun. but for someone who LOVES brunch (and I'm from New York where brunch can be AMAZING) I thought this place was on the bottom of my list.  When I want BREAKFAST, I would like a succulent meal!

2010-03-28,3.0,"Would prefer to give a 2.5 but I round up. We got here at about 11:40 and waited just over an hour to be seated which seems to be par for the course if you arrive after 10 and I don't have a big problem with it.  There was free coffee at the bar, and it wasn't bad, but tasted like it had been heated for a really long time and had gotten overly acidic and bitter, but I am not going to complain too much about free coffee.  This place was extremely loud and playing extremely loud music, so if that bothers you keep it in mind.   When we were seated we got the famed little bites of coffee cake, which I thought was delicious but everyone else at the table noticed a weird aftertaste,and thought maybe it was sweetened artificially (I pretty much only use artificial sweetener so I am used to it) or used overly bitter orange rind.  The service was fast, and very nice.  We really liked the waiter, and all of the staff. They stayed very on top of water and coffee.  I ordered the numero cinco with vegan cheese- I was really happy to see vegan cheese. Two people got the biscuits and gravy and one got buckwheat pancakes.   My burrito came and the vegan cheese was just a fresh out of the wrapper slapped on top of the burrito, no attempt to disguise it. . I don't have a problem with it being slices, but you would think they would do something to make it look a little more appetizing rather than slapping it cold  and un-melty on the burrito plastic wrap marks and all.  Maybe put it IN the burrito??   It also came with real sour cream, which didn't make any sense as they sell it as ""vegan's delight"". The burrito itself was ok.  I liked it, but it was not remotely special, flavorful, or interesting.  Even the salsa was bland.  Bland salsa.  I added a ton of hot sauce to everything.  You would think they would do SOMETHING to make this flavorful, marinate the tofu maybe? Cook the beans with some seasoning?  It was very healthy, and tasted like it.  It was also very cold.  Chipotle makes a way better, cheaper,  burrito.  Chipotle.   At ten dollars this was a massive rip off. One person got eggs over medium with his biscuits and gravy and they were extremely undercooked and sent back.  The new eggs were still undercooked but acceptable.  The most surprising? Both people with sausage and gravy thought they were flavorless, bland, underseasoned, boring, not worth the money.  They both felt the gravy was too flour-y and tasted like the sausage was added later and not cooked in, and the pepper was also put on the gravy rather than cooked in.  Very disappointing, since I picked the place I got the blame :(.  Reading the review maybe this is an anomaly, was anyone else there today and felt they were different than usual?   The person who got the buckwheat pancakes and chicken sausage felt they were both very bland, but admitted she just got them because of her diet and expected pancake blandness.  The sausage was surprising.  Bland sausage?  Seriously though- every single thing was bland all of us had felt bland.  Overall the taste-wise whole experience came off as charmless (outside the waiter), pride-less, thoughtless, and personality less.  I am floored by all the great reviews.  This is not special or delicious food.  I have not written a review in forever, but had to write this one just because I was so stunned to see all the fantastic ones.  Did we just get a really off day?  Way to expensive to give it another whirl.  While I don't consider $12 or a person an expensive meal, the value is pretty awful.  This is nowhere near 5 star dinning.   Great staff, fun decor, bland bland bland food.   How does this place have better ratings than Sola (same price points, significantly higher quality) or Milk and Honey (way cheaper, more delicious) EDIT: It's creme fraiche, not sour cream.  I didn't taste it, just ask if it was vegan or not.

I've got several times due to the proximity to my home. It's ideal when I have out of town guests and don't want to prepare a large breakfast. :),0.8771,0.839,0.126,0.035,0.5419642857142858

2010-02-14,2.0,"Based on the reviews you'd think Jesus himself cooks for this place. Everyone loved it so much that we gave it a try and had an experience that was, at best, mediocre. First the good: the decor is fun and the staff was lovely. As others have mentioned, it's extremely crowded for weekend brunch (to be expected) but our part of six was seated fairly quickly and there's plenty of interesting stuff on your walls to hold your attention while you wait. The art is terrific. But then there's the bad. I had heard nothing but rave reviews about their brunch offerings but (frankly) thought the food was awful. Like almost bad. If it weren't such a zoo I would have probably sent it back. My Havarti omelet ranks among the worst I've ever had: the eggs were tough, the cheese was weirdly waxy. I did about four bites to be polite.  Even worse was the fact that the food was super bland not seasoned at all. Who doesn't put any sort of salt in their hashbrowns? I didn't have a Bloody Mary but those who ordered them (and waited 25 minutes to be served) said they were pretty bad and that the tomato juice was slimy.   Glad I went but don't think I'll be back.

2010-02-11,4.0,"We were looking for a new, but not so far spot for breakfast over the weekend when Lois remembered reading about Tweet...let's eat (5020 N. Sheridan)in the Trib a few weeks ago so we decided to give it a try. This place, which is part of Big Chicks, is cool. The restaurant is several rooms cobbled together with all types of awesome work by local artists on the walls. The crowd is eclectic and there are some pretty enormous, delicious looking cakes under glass by the cash register. They basically had Lois sold when the hostess gave us two complimentary slices of some kind of breakfast cake (think spice cake with a dash of some kind of fruit...we're still trying to figure out what it was) when she seated us and made good, strong coffee appear in less than a minute. Lois had her heart set on French toast and sausage links, but breakfast selection was more of an ordeal for me.  I wanted a breakfast burrito, but there were so many other interesting things on the menu. After a lot of deliberation, I ordered the Portland omelet (I've heard of the Denver omelet, but never knew Portland had a signature breakfast dish). I was intrigued. But before you get to the main course, you get the option of compote or fresh fruit to start; I ordered the fresh fruit, Lois ordered the compote. These little fruit dishes just looked wonderful, and made me feel like I was at some sort of upscale restaurant. The fresh fruit cup had  banana slices, orange wedges, pineapple, raspberries, strawberries, black berries, blueberries, and cantaloupe. And the compote had a delicious apple taste. Seriously, this was where it was at. And it's not like they gave you a whole boat load of fruit -- they were the perfect size to hold you over until your main dish arrived (which only took about 10 minutes, by the way). The Portland omelet and I fell in love at first sight. I don't think Lois felt threatened by this new found love, because she would be around after this meal and the omelet would not, so she let me bask in this love the same way a wife would let her husband join his friends at a strip club. This omelet consisted of eggs, bacon, chives, and tomatoes, with cream cheese slathered in the middle of the omelet and also smothered across the top. This thing was the bomb. Seriously. I'm so used to having cream cheese on carb-based breakfast items that I was blown away as to what other things we can spread cream cheese on. And although this omelet was bigger than my head (I had no problem finishing it), but it also came with fried hash browns, which were good but were too crunchy as a unit; I like my hash browns loose so I can pick at them, not fried on one side so I have to cut them into squares. It doesn't matter, because I had this giant omelet to fill me up. While I was loving on my omelet, Lois was going to town on her French toast and sausage links.  The first good sign...a good old fashioned mini ice cream scoop of real butter on top of the three large French bread slices of French toast.  These huge slices of toast came with some fresh fruit on the side and real maple syrup, so you had a choice of toppings. Lois went for the syrup while I not so discretely took all of her fruit piece by piece.  Too bad this dish kicked Lois' ass -- she managed about two slices (ok one and a half...I ate part of her French toast too) and all three sausage links and that was it. We loved Tweet...let's eat but we're going to have to put it into the ""treat"" category, but a very, very worthwhile ""treat"".  We spent almost $35, including tip, which coming from two people who usually spend under $20 for breakfast is kind of extravagant.",0.9988,0.78,0.177,0.043,0.5077261939937995

I would suggest ordering tea as they give you cute antique teapots and cups/saucers.  Also a nearby table ordered the lox platter which looked awesome.  It could feed a table of 4.  So could the quiche platter.  They both looked really good and definitely frightened the people who ordered them. Do not come here if you can't afford to wait over an hour.  The only reason I gave Tweet 4 stars and not 5 was because they told us the wait would be 30 minutes for 3 of us, and we waited an hour and a half.  Ridiculous - they should have been honest with us.  I was mad because I work in retail and had to work at 3pm on a Sunday, unlike every other leisurely diner.  Someday, I'll be one of those diners... maybe on a weekday morning.",0.988,0.771,0.171,0.058,0.6918103448275862

My friend loved her biscuit benedict, and my eggs florentine was fantastic . . . until about 5 minutes in, when we both looked up and realized that we felt like we were going to die. The hollendaise sauce was perfect and velvety - and must have had about a stick of butter in it. The hash browns had a beautiful crust across the top - and the slightly salty, savory warmth of another entire stick of butter. The complementary banana bread bites were some of the best I've ever had - but left telltale diamonds of oil on their doilie. By the ride home, we were both beginning to feel a little ill.

As we were with his family, the first trip had a lot to do with touristy attractions, as well as eating at the touristy(, expensive, and not-so-memorable) restaurants near them. But not this time around. Oh no no no no. Going on our merry own way, we decided to find a place for brunch on good ol' yelp. And that's where we were hit with a blow to our fiendish hearts: Tweet, I beseech you! What sold it for us was reading about the gay bar in which the restaurant is connected to. After being happily greeted by the hostess and being put on the list, it was suggested that we head over to Big Chicks for drinks and board games. You can literally walk to the bar without leaving the restaurant, which was alright for us since cold weather is completely unfamiliar to us while we're in Florida. We both ordered special mimosas, though it breaks my heart that I can't recall the names. They were both absolutely delicious and the bar tenders were absolutely charming, that's all that matters! -- After about 20 minutes, our table was ready. There, on the table, was a small plate of complimentary pieces of cake. It tasted like pumpkin loaf, but I can't be so sure. Either way, it was moist and very scrumptious. I ordered the Crabcakes Hollandaise and Joe ordered the Numero Seis (steak burrito, he sure does miss California), both with fruit cups. I was skeptical about the fruit, since they were generally fruits that are out of season. Surprisingly they were all really sweet. I mean, it really did surprise me!  I can't say much more than Joe actually liking his own burrito. He didn't complain, and he ate it all, but nor did he say it was over-the-top fantastic. As for me though, I can tell you that I am a die hard fan of eggs benedict, and the absolutely incredible idea of substituting canadian bacon with crab cakes was more than enough to rock my boots off. The crab was real, moist, and flaky with just a little bit of crispness, even with the hollandaise sauce on it. The flavors all meshed well together and it's no doubt that they put thought into creating that recipe. I positively adore this place! From the art decor, the service, and the food..

2009-10-15,4.0,"Well I rocked my mother and myself on over to Jaybird St. . . . . . .alright alright Sheridan Rd,  to treat her to brunch for Mommy's Day.  Like the good Yelper I am, I read the reviews before going so I was prepared for a bit of a wait when we got there. Arriving at about 1:50pm (they close at 3pm), our wait was like 35 minutes.  We played checkers and drank complimentary coffee as we waited in the adjoining bar Big Chicks. I had viewed the menu online, which I was happy for, and had a bit of an idea of what I wanted to order. I really liked that you could just order 1 pancake or slice of french toast for a taste rather than a whole plate. That scored big points with me.  Mommykins was really happy about it because she's the type that likes a little bit of everything.  She was also beyond pleased that things were organic. It's great when you can make your Mom happy. She ordered the Short Stack, these fluffy scrambled Egg Whites, Chicken Sausage, and Hashbrowns.  After much more self-deliberation I ordered the Quiche Platter (sun-dried tomato, basil, goat cheese quiche), Hashbrowns, and a slice of French Toast.   Her food was pretty much how you would expect it to come, but when I saw my platter I said ""whoa.""  It really was a small platter, lol. A huge slice of quiche, a perfectly crisp croissant, mixed greens w/ vinaigrette, and a small side of berries and grapes.  That alone was quite a feast, but luckily I hadn't eaten all day and  was able to consume my whole order. I'm such a piglet.  The Hasbrowns were great. I loved my croissaint. While I like the consistency of the quiche, I wished I would have gone for the other flavor-of-the-day (bacon and swiss). The crust kind of fell short for me too.  The French Toast was like a brioche toast, it was somewhat rich, but airy. I liked it.  And this may seem strange, but I judge a breakfast place by the butter they provide and Tweet isn't just sitting out little packets at your table. Your food comes witn a nice mini scoop of fresh, creamy butter that just melts on your food. Loved it! My Mother couldn't eat all of hers and happily enjoyed it the next day for breakfast at work. She said it still tasted fresh. She very much liked the place and said she would return. Our service was great and our waitress was an absolute doll. I wish I remembered her name. I'd want to get her again when I return. Now my only big problem was that it's CASH ONLY.  I had no idea and felt there should have been more/bigger signage at the entry to inform me of that.  I hate carrying cash and certainly didn't like having to go to an ATM across the street at the end of my meal to get some.  That came close to turning me off to the place, but I just had to remember my meal to feel better.  It just means this can't be an impromptu brunch spot for me. I'd have to plan in advance.  Overall, I was happy with my visit, but more importantly Mommykins was and that's what really mattered that day,",0.9989,0.751,0.223,0.026,0.5700234192037471

Town.  I'm vegetarian and this place has all kinds of options for me, including veggie sausage!  Most of their ingredients are organic (and wow can you tell) and though their fresh fruit bowl is varied (screw some pale watery melon-- we're talking blackberries, strawberries, kiwi...) and fresh and yummy, I never miss their compote.  Made in-house, it's like dessert before brunch.  They keep the coffee flowing, and they serve their tea in antique cups and saucers.  I recommend coming on weekdays because then you don't have to wait.  I also recommend taking home a GIANT slice of amazing red velvet cake which is incredible, and the size of your head.",0.9799,0.773,0.227,0.0,0.5780000000000001
2009-09-27,5.0,"I'm all about the brunch lately... it's weird because I don't have much of an appetite in the mornings.... *shrug* I've been to breakfast here twice and even had dinner here once (the dinner was actually a fluke).  They don't take reservations here, but the I don't think I've had to wait more than 10 minutes both times I had brunch here (both Sunday mornings I believe).  They send you off to the bar next door for a refreshing cocktail, and have random books for you to peruse while waiting (like I Spy, Where's Waldo, etc.). I ordered  Mark Jackson's sunrise granola (both times), and was pleasantly surprised at the portion.  It had lots of fresh fruit, some dried fruits, and yogurt and honey on the side. Everything here seems to be very fresh, organic, and healthy.  Well, I guess I wouldn't call their cocktails overly healthy, but you can't come to Tweet without trying one of their signature cocktails =P The wait staff here is AWESOME!  They're always super friendly, and just cool, cool people.   Dinner here on the other hand... ehhh... not so much.  I was around the neighborhood and decided to try it out.  In my opinion, they should stick with what they do well.  My friend got the fish taco's and I got the veggie burger.  Both of the dishes were... meh... the taco's seemed kinda dry and tasteless and the burger was just ""meh"".   To sum it all up, definitely check Tweet out for breakfast/brunch/lunch, but try elsewhere for dinner.",0.996,0.788,0.207,0.005,0.5663194444444445
2009-09-27,5.0,"As the saying goes, the devil is in the details. So let me sum up what makes Tweet so wonderful by describing their fruit cup. This is the holy grail of fruit cups. Whereas most fruit cups are 3/4 melon (which I hate) and a few dry, white strawberries, this fruit cup has FRESH pineapple, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, watermelon, and honeydew melon. I have never been so excited for a fruit cup. Which probably makes me really lame. The wait was about half an hour for two at noon on Sunday, but that was made much more pleasant because we took a table at the bar, grabbed a game of Battle Ship, and drank the free (!) coffee. (Only free when you're waiting, but what a nice way to wait.) Our table was ready right when all of my battleships had sunk. The staff is wonderful. They really work as a team, with one lady seating us, one guy bringing the water and coffee, another guy bringing the food, and the waitress taking our orders, checking on us, and bringing the check. Oftentimes this system can become disjointed and cause either too much service or too little. But it was flawlessly executed. The food: Very good. I categorically love breakfast food, so it doesn't take much to impress me. But they have a great selection, with classic favorites plus creative specials. The egg on the eggs benedict was poached perfectly: not the uber-runny egg that can turn your plate into egg soup. And their hash browns are my favorite hash browns ever. They're perfectly crispy, and made so that they're not piled very tall so that you get a lot of crisp in every bite.",0.9973,0.73,0.232,0.037,0.6356216931216933
2009-09-27,3.0,"As soon as I stepped foot into Tweet, I thought it would be a place I would really like. The place is like eating at your smarmy aunt's house...cases of cakes and pies on display, kitschy vintage tableware, six kinds of hot sauce on the table, quick service. The menu is also very extensive and appealing, with all the comfort breakfast items I like: biscuits and gravy, hashbrowns, omelets, all kinds of benedicts. The portion sizes are out-of-this-world enormous...with both disgusts and excites me. With the fancy fruit salad and the plate of toast and the enormous 3-egg omelet and the brick of hashbrowns that came with my order...three people could share one meal.  The food, however, was not the best. My gigantic omelet was more cheese than egg (and i don't think anyone could eat THAT much melted cheese) and extremely bland. The toppings (asparagus and shallots) were so sparse that I hardly noticed them.  They added no flavor to the tasteless omelet. I guess that's why they supply you with so many bottles of hot sauce on the table. And the hashbrowns had a frozen taste to them...egh. The experience was not bad enough to completely drive me away...I'd probably like to come back and try something different as there were many items on the menu that sounded very tasty, and they had great vegetarian items.  I might liken the quality to that of a diner, which, though far from top-quality, is excellent when you're in the mood for it.",0.9636,0.856,0.111,0.033,0.571875

2009-09-15,5.0,"I can't believe that it has taken me this long to write my review of Tweet! Breakfast is by far my favorite meal of the day, and I was excited to try out this new place in my neighborhood after having found it on Yelp. Thank you, thank you, thank you, yelpers! I have taken many friends- local and out of towners there, my brother, my parents, and everyone has raved. In fact, I feel like Tweet is somewhat of an Ace up my sleeve- ready to pull out when I want to impress someone with my insider knowledge of the truly great, unique places in this city.  Ok, down to the nitty gritty- the food. For a while, I always got the Caprese Omelet, which seems to be a regular special, (thank god) but I've also had the french toast and corned beef hash, all of it delish. Skip the compote- it's WAY too sweet and syrupy- and just get the fruit cup. And by god, if your menu item comes with your choice of toast or hashbrowns? Get the hashbrowns, everytime. They are always cooked perfectly.  My dining companions have had the eggs benedict, other omelets, breakfast burritos, and my brother has more than once tackeled the  Lox platter. I need to stop myself here. The Lox platter is amazing. Not just because it is absolutely huge and could easily feed 2+ people, but also because it is a gorgeous presentation on the plate- a huge rosette of Lox! Yumm. The servers are always very nice, and much cooler than I will ever be. I have a mini girl-crush on this one server who is so sweet, always remembers me, and has these funky tattoos and a bandana and vintage clothes. She looks like she could have just jumped out of that 1940's Rosie the Riveter poster? Yeah, that cool. They are attentive and funny. though I do stay out of the (owner's) way- she looks like she runs the list and I don't dare cross her! Finally, some tips. Go at 9am, when they open OR 1-ish. The wait is worth it, but standing in the bar as your stomach growls drinking (a-hem) somewhat expensive breakfast cocktails ($9? When my omellete is $11?) is simply a diversion from the main attraction. Another tip- bring cash. They don't take cards. Boo. Also, go hungry. Portions are big- you most likely will take some of your meal home. Finally, there are a couple of parking spots in the back adjacent to the alley if  you don't want to pay for a meter/brave the characters on the sidewalk.

They have some great sidewalk seating as well. They have REALLY GOOD biscuits and gravy. Their crab cake sandwich is good, but the crab cake is a little small.

I doubt I need to repeat that you should be prepared to wait and bring cash.  Bring a lot of cash.  Tweet is not particularly wallet-friendly (i.e. $3.50 for a side order of organic bacon, which amounts to 3 small strips), unless you stick with some very basics, don't order extra sides, and avoid anything from the bar.  Sounds like fun, huh? Will that stop me?  No.  Watch for me at the table with a high chair.  I'll be enjoying those biscuits and gravy everyone raves about.  If you don't like it, beware of my deadly stroller.",0.9926,0.745,0.187,0.068,0.5316021825396825

Hash browns -- crisp and yummy.  The bacon -- get it (but ask for it slightly crispy.)  Oh, and incredible little fresh fruit cup that comes on the side and tastes like the fruit was just off the truck and rinsed that morning... blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, banana, pineapple, and (sadly) a little melon.  The only thing to improve is gettign rid of melon (its not bad, I just don't like melon). Lunch...  Every sandwich is good, I love the club.  As a side, get the chippers...   They offer a very healthy menu, but you can be bad if you want.    They only serve dinner on Fridays and I have not tried it yet, but hope to soon.  A great reason to go to Uptown.",0.9979,0.694,0.28,0.026,0.6333333333333334

There was about a 30 minute wait (they said they were short staffed), but we didn't even notice because we were entertaining ourselves with multiple rounds of Boggle (which I've learned I suck at) in the Big Chicks bar area which was also home to many interesting pieces of art that generated discussion.  After perusing the menu we both decided on the same dish the Country Benedict which is a genius concept of buttermilk biscuit, sausage patty, poached egg, and country gravy.

You'll probably have to wait for a table--but that's okay, because there's free coffee and a bar.  The Bloody Marys are amazing, especially if you ask the bartender to use wasabi instead of tabasco.  Yum. Some people here have complained about the service, but the waitstaff has always been friendly and helpful when I've been there.  The hosts and hostesses can be a bit rude, but frankly, I find them entertaining while I wait for my table. But the food--the food is why I overlook any minor flaws and give five stars.  Everything I've eaten there is amazing! The *best* sausage gravy I've ever tasted, the Portland Omelet is delicious, the fruit cups and bakery they bring out before the entrees are perfect for preventing the inevitable pre-breakfast blood sugar crash, and the portions are huge--I always take home leftovers (which reheat remarkably well).  You just can't go wrong.",0.9822,0.745,0.193,0.062,0.7073099415204679

However, this isn't an Amish facility.  So why in the world does Tweet refuse to enter the 21st century and accept credit/debit cards?  I get the fact that there are transaction fees associated with them - fine, but what does piss me off is the $2.00 ATM fee machine parked right up front and waiting for any and all unsuspecting patrons so not only does Tweet get to avoid the contemporary costs of doing business, it appears they get to prey on unsuspecting customers at the same time.  This isn't some hot dog stand or start up lacking customers where the two cent transaction fee on the cards would push them into financial ruin.  I get not wanting to be coopted by the corporate overlords, but seriously - you have an ATM inside.  Cooption has occured.  Carrying cash is dangerous in some parts of the city I inhabit, so that is why after my delightful meal when Tweet pointed my boyfriend to their greedy fee charging ATM I died a little death after my brunch Nirvana. I suppose the moral of the story (burying the lede here) is bring your bankroll with you.  In the event I do happen to ever have cash, I may visit Tweet again (because after all ATM fees are said and done $4 to get my money is outlandish).  Or hey, sweet Tweet folk, a POS machine with a minimum could be a nice compromise? 4 star to start; -1 star for the lack of customer friendly payment options.",-0.8812,0.811,0.082,0.107,0.48030753968253975

Dollar burger mondays...  Free BBQ sundays...   Boom it happened I ate at Tweet and the rest is history!  Today once again I ate brunch at Tweet and once again I was thoroughly blown away!  We arrived right at 9 AM which is a great time to get there if you don't want to wait a prohibitive amount of time on a sunday... They kick off the experience with a lil baked nosh of sweetness and delight it is always something different from the last time...  Today the opening act was a very mild and moist spice cake of sorts quite delightful for sure!  Act 2 was a pear compote for me and fresh fruit for my friends, which is such a great touch virtually every dish comes with your choice of fresh fruit cup or fruit compote of the day... My guests had omelets off the brunch special menu...  They were both awesome (of-course I tried them both)  A caprese omelette with the obvious fresh mozzarella roma tomatoes and fresh basil, the other was a Portland presentation of the omelette variety including bacon,  green onion and a very different effect of cream cheese which was a pleasant texture and great flavor!  both these came with fresh tomatoes on the side as well... pretty much all the dishes on the menu also are garnished with fresh veggies and fruit!  I had the Lox platter which I have had at least 10 times and every time I am blown away!  The Lox platter comes with a staggering bloom of wonderful smoked lox salmon in the center of a huge platter flanked on all sides by flavor and goodness!  The platter includes boiled eggs, capers, cream cheese, mini pickles, with increasing caches of, lightly seasoned mixed greens, cucumbers, and beefsteak tomatoes, and then an equally impressive mound of fresh fruit, today it was sweet grapes with berries abound, and 3 miniature bagels...  The Lox platter is amazing for sure big enough to share but I never do! The service here is better then great, the drinks are harder then stiff, and the atmosphere is full of museum worthy photography and an overall vibe of welcome and warmth!

The wait was quite pleasant as there were boardgames and kids' books to keep the kids entertained.  There was also some amazing coffee to hold us over.  There are some quirky stuff on the wall, which definitely made my parents feel uncomfortable.  The crowd was mostly edgy and urban with the majority of clientèle between 25 and 40 yrs old.  When I finally went to check the status of our table after waiting for 30 minutes, the kind lady (owner I believe), said our table was ready.  Only my parents were bothered by the long wait ... the kids were just dandy!  We had two baskets of toys, books, crayons, etc, just waiting for the kids at the table.  Score another one for kid-friendliness.   The options seemed endless. I went with one of their specials, which was the Portland Omelette.  My wife ordered the Steak Breakfast Burrito. The same owner lady also offered sliced bananas for the kids.  Good thinking.  Though we had to wait for what seemed like awhile for our main dish, we were quite overwhelmed when we saw the quantity of food that arrived.  And once we took a bite, it was simply amazing.  Each one of us loved the food we had ordered.  We were full before we finished even half of the main dish.  But we kept eating because it was sooo good.  In case I wasn't clear .. the food was VERY good!   So in the end, the food and service were fantastic.  Yeah the wait time for the table and for the food were long, but they did a good job of keeping the kids and even the adults occupied.  The decor will not be agreeable for all, but ignore it, and enjoy the food.",0.9956,0.804,0.154,0.042,0.619006734006734

I ordered the eggs florentine and tasted my friend's corn arepas.  The first thing I noticed about my food was that everything tasted like butter.  This includes the hollandaise sauce and the hash browns.  Thankfully, the fresh fruit came first and was not touched by butter.  While I am a fan of butter, and use it liberally on bread or potatoes and when I bake, I do not like my breakfast to be cooked in too much butter.  It's not that it was greasy, it just tasted like butter and wasn't salted sufficiently for me to appreciate the flavor.  Next time, I would ask for the hollandaise on the side, because they give you a bit too much of it (if that's possible, right?).  After dousing my hash browns and eggs in ketchup and chipotle Tobasco to get more sodium, I enjoyed my well-made breakfast.  I think this would be a good dish to share, since it's very filling. My friends arepas were a little better.  The arepas were supposed to be corn meal pancakes, but I couldn't really tell there was cornmeal in them.  They were soft, just like regular pancakes, but they had green chiles in them, which provided a nice savory flavor.  They were topped with eggs (your choice of cooking), avocado, some other stuff, and guajillo sauce.  I thought it was a good alternative to a breakfast burrito--more refined and fulfills your morning pancake craving, but still has the Mexican-inspired flavor.

2009-03-09,1.0,"I've been to tweet dozens of times for brunch and loved it. I've raved about it to everyone I know and taken every opportunity to take out-of-towners here. My last visit was very disappointing and I'd hesitate to return.  When my sister came into town for her birthday, my girlfriend and I didn't hesitate to take her to Saturday morning brunch. There was the usual 45-minute wait, but it turned into nearly an hour and a half (they were quite busy). The additional wait was expected and not a big deal. However, they had turned the room in between the dining room and bar into restaurant seating - half a dozen or so two-tops along a bench on one side, and in between the coat racks, walkway, and next to the ATM, one four-top. They seated the three of us at this isolated table, only feet from where we were waiting before, and we were quickly handed menus and served beverages.  They must have then turned a lot of tables in the dining room, because soon there was a person getting cash, then a few, then ten people in line to use the ATM at this cash-only restaurant. Additionally, the wait for food was almost 45 minutes, unusually long. It seemed as if packing this room with seating slowed down the kitchen and in fact made service slower. We received no attention from the server between ordering and the check, either because she couldn't fight through the line of people separating our table and the rest of the restaurant, or because she knew I was going to request to be moved to a different table.  It's quite uncomfortable eating with ten people lined up inches behind you, accidentally bumping you and your chair as they shuffle very slowly forward to withdraw cash and having strangers naturally stare at your table and watch you eat. We ate very quickly as a result. It was absolutely not relaxing at all, which, if you're going to spend two hours and $75 on breakfast and cocktails, is really what you want.  Unless they seat people at the pool table or have a two-top in the men's room, this was probably the worst table I've ever seen at any restaurant. I don't mind much being a few feet from another table, but sitting next to a cash machine? Really? Who thought it was a good idea to put a table two feet away from the ATM in an already otherwise full room at a CASH ONLY BRUNCH?  When I mentioned it to the server and hostess, they gave me a canned frown and a ""next time when you are being seated ask the hostess to be seated somewhere else."" However I get the feeling that this really isn't the kind of place where they'd gladly accommodate that request during a busy weekend brunch.  Packing 'em in might generate more cash right now, but not if their management doesn't realize that absolutely no one wants to eat right behind the ATM line, and that any reasonable customer would wait five more minutes to eat at a real table.  I'm in the restaurant business and was shocked they would seat anyone next to an ATM and only accept cash, guaranteeing an ATM line on weekend mornings. I was even more shocked to realize that no one at a seemingly successful business like Tweet understood this.",-0.8898,0.881,0.05,0.068,0.47389476778365663

We walked in at about 11am on a very rainy Saturday and were warmly greeted by the hostess who joyfully quoted us a 35 minute wait and suggested we head to the bar and get a cocktail while we waited. Cocktails BEFORE brunch? Hell, I'd already knocked back a mojito and a spiked oatmeal shake that morning before we got to Tweet, so what harm could a little more booze do? The bartender was so nice and poured up a mimosa just how I like it... heavy on the champs, light on the OJ. I dug that I heard my favorite Grateful Dead song Sugar Magnolia and didn't think twice about singing along. It's just that kind of crazy, energetic vibe up at that bar.  After being seated, our lovely waitress came to fill us up with delicious coffee and talk about the menu. One of my dining companions and I were Tweet virgins, so we needed the scoop on what was good on the menu. I'm pro eggs for brunch, so I decided on one of the special omelets, the Portland. It's free range organic eggs (YUM), tomatoes, bacon, peppers and, get this, cream cheese. With eggs. Can they do this? Do they dare? In case you're wondering, they can, they do and it was fantastic! And so were the hash browns with their crispy crunch on the top and warm, silky smoothness in the middle. Absolute bliss.  The service was top notch. The boys I brunched with were totally crushing on our server, which I thought was hilarious. She made excellent suggestions, checked in often and even brought the one person who didn't get a fruit with his meal a fruit cup with everyone else so he wouldn't feel left out. She was a doll. I wish I remembered your name, honey. I'd totally give you a shout-out.  In the end, it was the makings for a perfect brunch.

I used Yelp to pick a place that is good for groups, good for vegans and good for brunch.  (BTW Yelp, 5 stars to you for making that search possible.)  I decided upon Tweet for is ability to handle all my requirements with ease plus the clincher, it's a block away from my g.f.'s house.   The g.f. and I got there 1/2 hour early to put the 12 party name on the list.  Michelle told us she was telling everyone 40 minutes at that time (12:15pm Sunday) and since we were to be a large group we should ""belly up to the bar (Big Chicks - next door) and start drinking.""  We should ""aim to be drunk by the time the rest of the guests arrived.""  Don't have to tell me twice! The first spicy Bloody was delish and on the house for my b-day delight.  My friends trickled in, timely and lovely, and Michelle pointed them my way until our table was ready.  We had a grand old time at the bar waiting for our table and drinking either booze, water or the (AMEN) gratis coffee.   Before being seated, one of the sexy bear bartenders presented his wooden paddle and asked me, ""How long do you want it to hurt?"" I know my shit and told the man not to worry, no holds barred, ""Give me the full 27.""  Following the extra hard extra smack on my ass for good luck he even obliged a few of my other pain-slut friends with whacks of their own while my own cheeks tingled and my flush subsided.  And then, our table was ready! The corn cake brunch special was really great for my money - plus the poached eggs were done perfectly.  I heard, at turns, that the fruit cup or compote, waffle, vegetarian biscuits & gravy, burritos, omelets, vegetarian Benedict and the rest were also mighty satisfactory.  One guest got the ""only Korean"" dish she saw on the menu and enjoyed it as well.   Then Michelle and the masses of hottie staff members came to my seat bearing a giant piece of red velvet cake with a candle in it and the whole effing restaurant sang.  A tear to my eye, it nearly brought.  The cake was also some of the best red velvet I've ever had, so mysteriously good.  We were there for a total of 4 hours and had fun every minute of it.   I even got to see my first pierced scrotum, but that wasn't on the specials list.",0.9869,0.847,0.129,0.024,0.5434027777777777

2009-01-03,4.0,"I'm not big on New Year's resolutions, especially about spending fewer $$$, imbibing less, shedding pounds or kicking a bad habit - and it's proven those don't last anyways. So I decided to spit in the face of all that and started off 2009 by hitting up a brunch spot and trying a traditional drink I've never had: a Bloody Mary. We woke up long before Stanley's brunch started, so that was out...lo and behold, Tweet.   Upon walking in the door at Tweet, a joyful sight awaited: a cake dish of red velvet at the cash register. And to further perk us up, we got a complimentary amuse bouche-like chocolate cake with our menus. Who needs coffee when you've got Tweet? I spent about 10 minutes deciding between the Lox Platter and Country Benedict: Biscuit, Gravy, Sausage and Poached Eggs, with a side of hash browns. Finally, I just gave up and asked the waitress for her suggestion, and she immediately said ""Country Benedict - our biscuits and gravy are the best in the city."" So I went with it, and I liked it - I wouldn't call the gravy the best in the city, but their biscuits were delicious, and they know how to poach an egg. Hash browns are a very subjective food, like fries - some people like them thin and crispy, others big, thick and moist. Apologies to the people with their minds in the gutter - there's no other way to describe it! So to say I'm not a fan of Tweet's hash browns isn't to say they're not good, just that they're not my style. Fried to the point of no return on one side, particularly rare on the other, Tweet's hash browns are in the no man's land of breakfast potatoes for me. But I was a big fan of the complimentary fresh fruit, and I'll try the lox platter the next time I'm up there - or any dish sans hash browns. Boyfriend checked out the Burrito #6 - nearly Chipotle-sized with steak, eggs, onions, potatoes, cilantro and chipotle mayo. The mayo was seriously smoky, and they didn't skimp on the cilantro - always a plus for fans like me. Tweet's cash only, but they've got an ATM and great service - the woman at the counter was totally nice to my boyfriend when he asked for change for the meter. Next time you're in a mood to clog the arteries with a fresh, organic, hormone-free, perk-full breakfast, do it at Tweet - I know I will. Although the bar next door, Big Chicks, may be well-monikered if the patrons are frequent regulars of their sister restaurant...",0.985,0.842,0.111,0.047,0.4674053030303031

Their breakfast/brunch items are very good and well worth some praise. Anytime I've had their pancakes(I love the buckwheat ones), they have been pretty tasty and rich. Their egg dishes always taste fresh and cooked just right. Anything I get with fruit is also fresh but I can do without the compote versions. Their menu is actually quite extensive so you should be able to find the usual suspects and some creative ones as well. Now there are some things that I don't like but it only happens once in a while. Certain servers are better than others but they are all nice ... some have a knack for dealing with more tables than others. Generally I've been attended to quite well and they are all friendly. Long wait times will happen to the best places; as, word of mouth is a Chicago and Yelp tradition ... we just need to deal with it but Tweet does have the bar area available for mimosas, bloody Marys and complementary coffee while you wait.

I was excited to try this place because of how many vegetarian options they have but from the start it was one ridiculous thing after another.  We were a party of 3 and got there at 12:30pm, we weren't seated until 2pm after many people who got there after us were seated already.  We got our food at 2:30pm and parts of it were inedible.  I got the vegetarian patties with biscuits and eggs/gravy.  I couldn't eat the patties because they were too burnt to cut through.  I can't complain too much about the rest because it was my first time eating biscuits/gravy + eggs so that's not their fault I didn't like it but to wait over 2hours to eat and then not be able to cut into a veggie patty with a serated knife is just ridiculous!  When the waitress asked if I wanted it bagged I told her no and why but she didn't even apologize or seem to be bothered at all that it sucked.  I will never go there again and I would not recommend it to anyone, If you want a real breakfast for half the price and wait walk up to Clark and go to Svea! Svea is the absolute best breakfast in the city and can't even be compared to Tweet. ****I have to add  that after we ordered, the people next to us (who got there way after us+got seated at the same time) asked the waitress to speed up there food because they were going to a movie.  I couldn't believe they had the nerve but what's more amazing is that the waitress actually did push their food ahead of ours.  I couldn't believe it !

My first visit to Tweet was, like many of my visits to brunch places, on a weekday morning.  The place was, of course, not crowded, and my friend and I were seated right away.  The server was friendly and attentive and helpful with suggestions.  I had the eggs benedict, which was delightful and served with a delicious fresh fruit cup.  It was apparent that the food was extremely fresh and carefully prepared.  Coffee was good and refilled often. Second visit:  Sunday at 1:30.  Pretty crowded.  Sat in the next door bar and played checkers while we waited.  They have tons of games.  That was fun (except the fiance was beating me), but we were both really hungry and neither wanted a drink from the bar.  I'm not a big brunch drinker but seems like this would be the place.  The hostess told us to go next door to the bar and start drinking while we wait. ?!?!  She said it would only be ""a few minutes"" but time ticked on and it was 2:00 before we were seated. Luckily, they gave as a little ""snack"" as soon as we were seated -- two little bites of a yummy lemon cake with chocolate chips.  Thank God for that...because what proceeded was the slowest service I think I've ever had at a brunch place.  Waitress was friendly enough, and our drinks came quickly.  House brewed ice tea was great.  I ordered the Cobb salad and the fiance a burger.  And then the great wait began.  It must have been a good thirty to forty minutes before our food finally came out.  By that time my hunger pains had passed and I was more into the light headed phase (how do people fast?  I will never know). The lunch food was not exceptional.  The Cobb Salad was decent, and the house dressing was very good.  In my extreme hunger, I devoured it before realizing they had left off the blue cheese.  I guess that's good for my waistline, but I thought something was off about it.  Turns out that the blue cheese really brings the salad together.  Oh well.  Fiance's burger was alright, and the accompanying hash browns were terrific, with a great crusty top that crunched. The waitress pretty much forgot about us after that, and we sat waiting for our check for quite some time.  I don't know, maybe I'm becoming stodgy in my old age, but I have not been impressed with waitstaff lately.  I need a really fabulous waiter/waitress to turn that around for me, and very soon.   The decor in this place is lots of fun.  Very quirky but charming and cozy.  One complaint is that it is cash only.  I'd say come for the breakfast food on a less busy day of the week.  If you like board games and day time drinking, you might not mind the wait on the weekends.",0.9983,0.774,0.191,0.035,0.5655330490405118
2008-09-21,2.0,"Food 3 1/2 stars; Service 1 star I was so excited to try Tweet after seeing the high marks it had received from other Yelpers so I suggested it for my monthly book/brunch club meeting. Unfortunately, my party and I weren't blown away by the food; however we were blown away by the crappy service we received. When I arrived I checked in with the hostess who was short with me. I'm not sure if she missed her morning coffee or what, but when I inquired if my party was here she snapped that they don't seat until the whole party was here and when I asked where they were waiting she snapped that the ones who had arrived were in the bar (which BTW is super cute). I get the seating rule, it's not that unusual; what I didn't get was the need for attitude. I let it go, hoping the rest of my dining experience would live up to the hype - it didn't. One friend was late and we missed her text (oops!) so we changed our reservation to 5 figuring we could just add another chair if she showed, and so were seated. Initially, our waitress seemed really nice, but it hit the skids from there. Our 6th showed up a few minutes after we'd ordered so we asked if we could add a chair. We knew it would be tight, but we were ok with it (we even rearranged our chairs to make room) - Tweet was not. Our server and both hostesses gave us attitude about not adding on to parties. Since no one was inclined to give us another chair we squished 3 on to the bench side of our table and made do. After situating, it literally took us 10 minutes to find someone willing to give my friend a menu (thank you busboy)  - were we supposed to recite it to her from memory? It took another 10 to find our server to take her order; when we did get her attention she said she'd be there in a minute and then proceeded to check on EVERY other table and take a few orders BEFORE coming back; it's one thing if she was in the middle of something, but this seemed very unlikely. After taking the order we heard her mutter under her breath that they don't add on to parties and make a face as she walked away. WTF? Had we commintted a cardinal sin or is their shtick being intentionally rude to customers? If so, we obviously missed the memo! Finally, our food came and it was fine, not out of this world, but fine. We got the Chilaquiles, lox bagel plate, hummus plate, Corn Arepas and the Country Benedict. The friend and I who got the lox and hummus plates and liked our food, but let's face it, it'd be hard to mess up either dish. My friends said their egg dishes were good, but nothing to write home about. When we finished, tracking down our waitress for our check was another 10 minute ordeal after an already trying brunch.

They came out at lightning speeds. His was perfect, with an unbroken tasty hollandaise, which Ann Sather's is almost always gross and broken without repair. His hash browns were even perfectly browned. My biscuits and gravy was heavy goodness.

They also drop a paper tarp under the high chair so you don't have to feel too bad about the mess all babies leave. I will say that there was so much going on in there that our baby did seem to be in a bit of a sensory overload, but in a good mood. We had a little wait, nothing I haven't experienced before, but we were allowed to take a little plate of banana bread outside with us, and that was really nice. The staff is so friendly, it has such a happy vibe. The fresh fruit cups are so fantastic and refreshing, and they bring the coffee pronto, just the way you need it. I had the crab cakes benedict and my partner had the biscuits and gravy.  I thought the hollandaise was fantastic, though the portion was ridiculous. The biscuits and gravy were good, very, very heavy and again a massive portion. We took our leftovers to offer to the many homeless people who live in our neighborhood, and they really appreciated such a big breakfast. That is my recommendation for the left over food, which you will have, please don't throw it away, plan on feeding a hungry person out there!

The most obvious change is that Tweet no longer serves dinner. And hasn't for quite a while. Which is too bad, because I had some lovely dinners here. But it does mean that Tweet can focus on breakfast, and that's a boon to all of us. What's good on the breakfast menu? I would have to say ... everything. It's hard for me to order anything other than biscuits and gravy, because I love it so and they do such a great job with it. I'm also a sucker for hash and eggs, and of course their corned beef hash is homemade. They do a handful of Benedicts, including one with crabcakes, a veggie (obviously not vegan) version, and a low carb version with steak instead of an English muffin (!). And this is just the tip of the iceberg, not mentioning the pancakes and waffles and wide selection of vegetarian options. There's frequently a wait for brunch, especially on the weekends, but the bar is open at Big Chicks, next door, for your mimosa and bloody mary needs. The marys are spicy and served in giant goblets.

My friends loved their burrito and omelette . . . and my eggs benedict was quite possibly the best I've ever had.

2008-05-31,5.0,"There are plenty of brunch places in town, but none make me as happy as Tweet.  They are so friendly and the food is SO good!  When someone calls and asks if I want to go, I practically get giddy.  I love the little touches like starting you out with bites of coffee cake and giving sides of fresh fruit or compote.  I usually go with the fresh, but I will get the compote when I am doing French toast or the fluffy buttermilk pancakes so I can pour the fruit over the top of them.  Yum! By far my favorite eggs benedict/eggs florentine in the city.  The eggs are cage-free and perfectly poached. The sauce is light and smooth.  I always try to let some leak over onto my hashbrowns so I get to enjoy the goodness on them as well.  Oh, the hashbrowns -- I wish more places had them figured out so well.  Grated, lightly seasoned, crispy on the outside, but tender underneath, never dry or overdone.   One particularly rough morning, I decided to try the country benedict which is like a combination of eggs benedict and sausage gravy and biscuits. Holy smokes!  Definitely not a low-cal dish, but oh so worth it as a once-in-a-while treat. The item on the menu that surprised me the most was the chilaquiles.    I would have never thought to try them here, but my friend's husband had them and graciously let me have a bite.  Fantastic!  Even better than some that I've had in Mexico. If you are a red velvet cake fan, make sure to get a to-go piece for later (you probably won't have room right after your meal).  The cream cheese frosting with the little nut chunks in it will have you glad you took it home so you can lick your plate without an audience.   Yes, there is a wait sometimes, but I never mind it.  Brunch is generally a social event for me any way.  There is a coffee station and wait-time seating on the Big Chicks side.  But why just do coffee when you can have a delicious bloody mary?  I still don't know what you put in your ""secret"" mix, my friend.  It is pretty darn close to perfection though.  Zesty, tangy, spicy.  mmm...   I could go on and on, but I'll end by saying that Tweet was the inspiration for my friends and I to start a monthly brunch club.  We're going on three years now.  We've definitely found some other great places along the way, but Tweet is always going to be number one.",0.9992,0.703,0.275,0.023,0.5378697691197691

Tweet was middling in the price department - not as cheap as some places, not as expensive as others.  The service was great, the decor was lovely, and the spacing of tables and such was pretty friendly.  Plenty of room for people of all sizes, and there was even enough space in the packed restaurant for a wheelchair to navigate!  Also, the vibe was alternative and diverse and really welcoming.  I highly recommend Tweet, and will probably be back.",0.9979,0.769,0.227,0.004,0.5175873015873015

The not-so-good: 1.  I'm not one of the health-conscious people who ask for the Hollandaise on the side.  If the Good Lord decided someone should invent a sauce that is like 2/3rds butter, then I think it is my duty a Christian to eat it all.  But my Eggs Benedict came absolutely smothered in Hollandaise.  The english muffin was completely sopping and the Hollandise covered over half my hash browns.  I had to scrape some if off just to be sure that there was an egg and lox in there. 2.  The hash browns were disappointing,  They tasted frozen. 3.  My mom and I were sitting at what was basically a table for four, with two people we didn't know.  Kinda puts a dent in the topics you want to talk about. So, I'm willing to put the Hollandaise down to an over-enthusiastic ladle and give this place another try, but I don't know if I would choose it over other places with a good brunch, like Feast.",0.9527,0.838,0.115,0.047,0.5524074074074075

They were AMAZING for lack of  better word to describe the utter delight and pleasure I received from eating them. The rich creamy gravy with good size chunks of sausage smothered the homemade biscuits and I must say it again - AMAZING Actually everything I had here is worth a detailed review:   1) Started out with a apple compote that reminded me of the apples my great aunt used to jar in Wisconsin, brought back some great childhood memories - delish!   2) The coffee was fresh and had a rather full and robust flavor but not overpowering - delish   3) You all know about the biscuits and gravy but my scrambled eggs were very flavorful compared to most eggs you can get at restaurants.   4) The service was great.

2008-02-21,4.0,"I would highly recommend you brunching at Tweet but I think it is advisable to go armed with a couple key pieces of information.  You will have to wait a while on the weekend (in my experience, an hour on average, especially in good weather), but you will get to do it in Big Chicks (the bar that Tweet is attached to), where they have lots of interesting art on the walls and free, good coffee (is there anything worse than shitty coffee at breakfast?).  Each member of the party will get a small diamond-shaped piece of cake while they peruse the menu which I find to be sort of mediocre/dry but my friends generally enjoy it.  Also you will probably eat it since you were just waiting for an hour.   Everything on the menu is tempting, and I haven't gotten a single dish I didn't like a lot.   I have especially enjoyed Breakfast Burrito #4 and the Quiche Platter.  I am a big eater and can honestly recommend considering splitting a dish between two people - the portions are huge and you can always get more if you need.  This particularly helps with cost, which creeps up a bit to the expensive side here.  One thing I especially appreciate about Tweet's food is the menu is full of organic-ness, which makes me feel that much better about my luxurious, brunch-eating ways.  Also a great place to dine with those kooky vegetarian friends of yours.  Regarding the oft-discussed fruit cups, I don't really get the policy on 'em since it seems sometimes they'll throw it on for everyone and sometimes not.   Perhaps it's a personal server decision. Speaking of which, I have a particular server at Tweet that I loooove, he is super jolly and always remembers me even if I have not been in for a hot minute.  This may or may not be related to the fact I drew him an elaborate ""Thanks!"" napkin-illustration, but I digress.... In general I have found the service to be great: the busboys are super friendly and quick, my table was once gifted with a giant piece of cake when our food was just tear-worthy slow, and another time when my friends and I were reading kiddy stories to each other as we waited for our meal, the owner brought her favorite one over to the table (they provide a few books that I suppose are meant for actual children.)  I only come to Tweet once every couple months so as not to get burnt out, but I like to take my picky out-of-town guests here.  It's a keeper.",0.9983,0.764,0.206,0.029,0.5847564935064935

The quiche look incredible--like something out of the cookbooks I never have time to use--as do the pancakes.  Let's just say my mouth is watering as I type. Be sure to get a bloody mary or mimosa--you can have one at the bar while you wait, or your server will bring one to you.   Expect to wait, and bring cash.  Also, you may want to plan to purchase a slice of red velvet cake on your way out.  You're going to want to.",0.9458,0.874,0.104,0.022,0.6197845804988662

They essentially start with an Eggs Benedict concept but instead of ham they use sausage and instead of hollandaise sauce they smothered it in Sausage Gravy. I mixed it all together with my hashbrowns and it was exactly what I needed. The other nice things are that they serve you a cup of fruit while you are waiting and the service was excellent.

Pro:  Extremely friendly staff.  Best breakfast I ever had in my whole life. This means alot about this place.  Fresh food.  They didn't even charge extra fruits cup and fruit on the pancake which would have been extra cost.  Also I didn't even complaint about the wait but I asked if Sunday was a bad time to come.  Waiter later took 2 grapefruit juices off the tab which was very nice.  These people really try hard to make this place very special. I can't never forget it now.  I have to say again how good the food was.  Fresh and organic...they take their time to make this stuff.  It's finest.

The menu has your standard American breakfast fare but we decided to order off of the specials which were all traditional Latin breakfast dishes -- and I whole heartedly recommend going this route.  I went with chilaquiles while my girlfriend had...  I forget the name of the dish she had, but they were both amazingly tasty and even beautiful to look at.  The chilaquiles was an entire plate packed to the edges with sliced avocado on top of chorizo on top of black beans on top of perfectly cooked scrambled eggs on top of tomatillo sauce on top of tortilla, on top of a red mole.  (I'm sure I'm forgetting a couple of ingredients.)  All this plated so perfectly that for a good few seconds I simply had to admire it before diving in. To go along side of this was the best bloody mary I've ever had.  And I've had my fair share of 'em too.  The day before this I had a terrific one at Lula -- one that would rank up there alongside some of the best -- but this one takes the prize.  I don't have the photo with me now, but I will post the picture that was taken of the awesome tiki glass that it comes in.  It makes you feel like a champ when you drink from it, like you're imbibing from a nectar of the gods.

I have to lower my rating to 2 stars from 3 because it is not inexpensive and the food is just not that tasty. Sorry, not trying to be a hater... ((First review)  Eh, it is OK.  We went there for breakfast. The service was great, no complaints at all there. Very attentive, nice folks. The food was average. Nothing to write home about, nothing to complain about. If I was hungry and walked by it, I would probably go back, but I would not seek it out either.

Glorious day and lovely patio aside, I found everything else to be average or okay.  And after seeing all the love that other Yelpers have left, I feel like I'm missing something.   Maybe it was waiting 45+ minutes for our food?  Maybe it was having the bus boy set my food down with his thumb sticking into my eggs and later finding hair in my otherwise yummy corn arapes?  Maybe it was not having my water filled up at all during the 75 minutes or so we were there?   Not all bad, but not exactly brunch heaven that I was expecting.  My boyfriend and I enjoyed the meal, but I know I've had better elsewhere.",0.9482,0.765,0.175,0.059,0.4697668650793651

We had to wait a while before anyone took our order even when the place was no where near filled up. I ordered the corned beef hash (I had better) and my friend ordered an omelet (which he complained to be rather tasteless). Our breakfast came with either freshfruit or apple compote. The apple compote was yummy (even better with some icecream!) but the fruit in my cup was sour and unripe. As the late morning crowd arrived, we recieved less and less attention from our waitress. The bus boy began to help with taking orders. I sat with a nearly empty cup of coffee for half of my breakfast. When our waitress had a chance to refill it, she only filled my friend's cup and forgot about mine. Before I could even say anything, she was preoccupied with the customer's waiting to be seated.  If you're into everything organic though, Tweet is the place to be. They try their best to prepare all their dishes with organic ingredients (thats what their menu says anyways).

The omelet was bland and rather tasteless. I also had a cup of chilli, which was pretty good. Joyce had the cornbeef hash which wasnt bad either. It took forever for us to get our checks also.

I was also desperate to impress my partner with my excellent brunch choice. (He wanted to go somewhere else). After an hour's wait.......I was eager. Mouth watering in anticipation. But my heart was crushed. Crushed because: 1. The fruits in the fruit cup was dry and ...shall I say it, looked like it was left on the counter for 2 hours 2. The crabcake & bacon sandwich I ordered was the worse crabcake I've ever tasted in Chicago (worse than the crabcake you buy from Whole Foods to bake yourself). The bacon was overdone. The bread was over-grilled. 3. How could they get pancakes wrong? The ultimate brunch taste test; yet I was dissapointed. The pancakes were crumbly and worse, the maple syrup seriously sucked. I have better syrup in my fridge. I kept looking at other tables, at their food, they seemed happy....or were they blown away by the hype so much that the food tasted good when it wasn't? Or was my table an anomaly? They gave my order to a novice perhaps? Add to this the fact that they seated us so close to the toilet (in my opinion any self-respecting place should not have customers seated within 10 feet of the toilet door) ....it made the experience all the more, well, heartbreakingly bad.

2007-01-15,5.0,"This has become quite possibly one of my favorite brunch spots in Chicago.  Where as Orange tends to be a little bit too avent-garde for my liking, and I've become a bit jaded of the likes of Toast and Ann Sathers, what sets Tweet apart is how they consistently do the fairly straight forward breakfast fares with focus on quality and special little touches that helps me start a weekend with a bright smile. The place is a lot bigger than you'd think, considering its small store front, but smaller than the other popular brunch spots.  There are a lot of framed photographs and art work that adorn the walls, and place reminded me a lot of typical cozy Mahattan cafes than other diners in Chicago.   When you are seated, you're immediately served a bit-size pastry and a server with a carafe shows up and offers coffee -- the pastry is on the house, but coffee is not.  (It's $2.50, unlimited refill, and VERY good coffee)  I noticed that most patrons ordered some very good looking alcoholic drinks, but we stuck with coffee.   I shared an omlette with side of fruit and two slices of pancake with my girl, prepared to order more if they weren't enough, and we ended up walking out with enough leftover for another breakfast!  The portions are huge, with the omlettes studded with sizable chunks of the ingredients (we ordered ham and mushrooms) and the pancakes incredibly think and fluffy.  They were thoughtful enough to split the fruit into two different cups (arrived before the food), with strawberry, raspberry, blueberry, pineapple and melons, and the fresh quality as well as generous portions were delightful.  Unlike the other reviewers, I thought that the hashbrowns were not anything extraordinary, but they were very good, nonetheless.   Service is very prompt, attentive and very friendly, and there was a separate server whose sole responsibility seemed to be refilling coffee and water, so we never waited or asked for a refill.  This was especially nice, as I find that in many other popular spots, sometimes you have to crane your neck and flag down any passing servers to get a refill.   I thought that the prices were slightly high ($4.50 for two pancakes, $9 for omlette with two ingredients and a side + hashbrowns) until the food arrived -- the portion, quality and obvious attention to proper preparation were well worth the price.  Couple that with the cozy atmosphere and excellent service that had us smiling the whole time (and the whole day after, even), and you'll understand my reasons for giving Tweet a solid 'five stars.'",0.9981,0.795,0.196,0.009,0.5553762492651381
