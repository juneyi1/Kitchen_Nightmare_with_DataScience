It's hard to fend off a Cuban sandwich craving when your first experience was from the Columbia Cafe in Tampa, FL. ( tinyurl.com/yb62fycw ) Seriously Tampa has some great Cuban Food. We were craving some delicious Cuban sandwiches though and after drooling over some of the Yelp photos we decided to give it a shot.  We walked right up to the counter and were greeted by a friendly server. After ordering our sandwich, Cafecito and iced chai tea latte we grabbed a table and waited for the delicious goodness we were about to receive. It didn't take long and we regretted splitting just one sandwich. The sandwich was great and the drinks were also tasty- the cafecito was very sweet but fun to try. We hung out for a while chatting and sipping our drinks before reluctantly leaving to meet some friends.  If we're in town again we would definitely hit up Cafecito and I could totally see us becoming regulars if we lived in the area. Very tasty and worth the trip in!",0.987,0.781,0.191,0.028,0.6146536796536797

2017-08-15,4.0,"So many sandwiches to choose from--the variety is definitely a plus, since you can definitely choose something you like or something fun from among them. We had the chivito and tilapia criolla, both of which were top-notch. Lots of flavor and very satisfying. The tilapia was especially good; it was lighter than the chivito, which was quite meaty, but that allowed the fish flavor and texture to stand out. The fish was so soft that it broke apart quite easily, and everything was also very fresh.  For a drink we ordered a colada. Though called a pitcher for sharing, it really came in a small-ish cup. I was a bit surprised at the beginning (one wouldn't typically expect to share a drink of that size!), but it made sense given the amount of caffeine in there. Not sure I'd call it a pitcher, but that's okay. It was surprisingly sweet too--while the sugar was subtle, I would've been happy to have a bit less.

I've never had Cuban food before and now I feel like I need to try it all, aha!!  The shop was quite small, not a lot of seating but people usually order their food to-go.  The Jerk Sandwich: (5/5) Chicken was very, very flavorful. It was seasoned really well and was moist. The bread was toasted; so it came with a crunchy shell but instantly soft inside  Now here's my warning, if you can't do spicy - do not order!!! The habanero lime sauce was amazing, but the heat does creep up on you!!!! So be careful!  Boyfriend's Review- Steak Chimichurri Sandwich: (5/5) This was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.

2017-08-09,5.0,I got take-out for breakfast since a friend and I are staying at a nearby hotel. They are located next to the HI Chicago hostel and nearby Roosevelt University. Their decor inside is very simple and they were not busy around 8:30am on a weekday morning.  I ordered their Cafe con Leche and it's a great coffee option for those who like their coffee sweet! It's among the best coffees that I've tried and I'm contemplating ordering again tomorrow morning! Their prices are super cheap and their portions are reasonable.

2017-08-03,5.0,"A taste of Cuba in the heart of the Loop. Finally made my way to Cafecito to see what it was all about. And like everyone has mentioned, it's as good as it gets! I got the cubano and an iced café con leche. It was the perfect combo. For such a simple sandwich, it was FULL OF FLAVORS! Thinly slices of roasted pork & ham, melted swiss cheese, pickles, and mustard all sandwiched between bread... it's a winner. Even during the busy lunch hour, I was surprised that my order was ready within minutes.  Since I was so impressed with my first visit, I decided to come again the next day during their less busy hours except the service this time was less than subpar. I ordered an iced café con leche and decided to try the chivito. The coffee came out right away but wasn't iced, so instead of making a new one, she throws in a few ice cubes making the drink lukewarm, which was kind of disappointing. Not sure if my order got misplaced or what since we were waiting for about 15 minutes and one of the guy notices that we haven't gotten our food yet and asks what we had ordered.

2017-07-28,4.0,"Good sandwich but did not live up to hype.  Before I visited, I had read many of the review here in which people talk about how this place has the best sandwich they've ever eaten. My jardin was not the best sandwich I've ever eaten. But it was pretty good and cheap for the quantity/quantity.  The inside of my jardin sandwich was roasted eggplant, roasted red pepper, mozzarella, and jalapeño hummus. I was disappointed to find my eggplant was still cold, and my mozzarella was not melted. There was barely any hummus but plenty of spiciness. The filling was unique but okay. The bread however, really pulled up the sandwich game. It was not greasy as I had expected it to be. The outside was very crispy while the inside was super soft and fluffy. The bread had also absorbed the juices from the filling and was delicious to eat on its own.  I came by at ~1:30 so lube was very short and service was fast, but I heard someone say that at noon the line is out to the street...",0.9865,0.812,0.168,0.02,0.537283950617284

Bad second impression: My friend got her Tilapia Sandwich and opened it up to find... lettuce and tomato. She went to the counter and they seemed annoyed, with a ""Sigh, not again"" kind of reaction. She got her sandwich but seems they've run into this problem before and they really should be more apologetic rather than annoyed with another member of the staff. Bad third impression (though not really their fault): Their bathroom is shared with the hostel. You get a key card, go across the hall, up the stairs, swipe to go through the doors, go through a lounge area, and finally to the bathroom. Way too inconvenient.  * Chopped Salad - 1.5 stars Ingredients weren't fresh, dressing had way too much vinegar. Really not appetizing. * Jerk Sandwich - 3 stars Tomatoes & lettuce were old.

My boyfriend got their iced Caramel Latte (soy) and he loved it! We both agreed that coffee here is not on the sweet side like how you would get at most places. It's smooth, rich, and not too sweet. The taste of the coffee here is just so creamy, it's not dependent on sugar at all. It's more of an experience with coffee and milk than sugar and I appreciate that. Also, prices are very affordable! Both our choices were $2.95 for a small and not only do they serve coffee here, but they're actually known for their Cuban sandwiches as well!

We just walked everywhere and explored. We checked into our hotel and looked for a place to grab a bite to eat. We stumbled on the Yelp for this place and decided to get a Cuban sandwich here for lunch. Then we noticed they had coffee. This place changed. my. life. The cortadito was this small, cheap double shot of espresso that was sweetened with creme, and it was a flavor explosion in my mouth. The shot was excellent, the sweetness was a perfect combination to the size of the drink to make it delicious, cut the bitterness, and give you a sugar rush that faded into the caffeinated buzz. Perfection. I was an instant addict.  We came here more often than all of the other restaurants on our trip combined and doubled. We had it bad. The sandwiches were stellar as well, and they just seemed to have flavor balancing down. Many people think about deep dish pizza when they think of Chicago.

The palomilla's flavor could pass as Cuban, but it wasn't as good. The lechón was really something else. Traditional lechón is served in chunks and smothered with onions and mojo. This lechón was like cut in thin, flat ribbons?? ‍ I'm still trying to figure that one out...the flavor was lechón-esque, though. The rice was clearly old. It had like the harder parts to it that you get when you refrigerate rice and reheat it. The beans were okay, and the maduros were good.  To be honest, I am kind of disappointed if people think this is real, authentic Cuban food because it isn't. I saw many items on the menu that are not used in Cuban cooking at all - chipotle, chimichurri, arugula, aioli, Latin ""slaw"", etc. Maybe they should change their label in Yelp from ""Cuban"" to ""Latin"". Not saying it doesn't taste good, they're just using wrong label...And come on, give us fresh rice at the very least. Not sure I'll be back.

Instead of a restaurant, think of it more like a cafe (with more food than Starbucks but the same idea).

The breading is super thick and dense (not exactly yeast friendly), the filling is unique and varied in textures and flavors (definitely some unique combinations!), and the sauces are ethnic.

It was a pressed sandwich with a rather tasteless, over cooked roast beef and some of the worst plantains, I've ever had (the bread was not that great either). My wife had the Mary Tiera (sp) which was a shrimp, chorizo sandwich with Arugula, tomatoes and supposedly aioli.  What was good was the shrimp surprisingly was fresh tasting and well prepared, cooked perfectly.  The chorizo was again those small slices that you had to look for on the sandwich and the fresh arugula overwhelmed the sandwich's taste and some had to be removed.  The aioli was not much better tasting than mayo, maybe that is what it was.  Note  - The bite I had did not have any chorizo.  This is not close to a 4 or 4 plus star place.

Flavors were on point, but definitely the portion no where near as generous as the Streeterville location. Either way still delicious. For additional sides, I shared an order of their hearts of palm side which is our favorite. Anyways, food is great and as I said service not so much.

2017-02-23,3.0,"I actually came here twice in a span of a week.  The first time I ordered Palomilla platter (sliced steak).  The shredded steak (seemed like skirt steak) was seasoned well and was pretty tasty, but I didn't really care for the beans or sweet plaintains on the rice.  I actually asked if they had tostones, but they said they didn't - odd considering there's a pic on yelp w/ it. The second time I came, I ordered their famous cubano and honestly, it was just alright.  I'm not sure what everyone is raving about.  I actually thought the sandwich had a bit too much mustard on it, which seemed to overpower the entire sandwich.  To top it off, it was quite crowded this day with service being incredibly slow.  I think it took almost like 25-30 min just to get a regular sandwich made!  I even had to go up to the counter to ensure that they put in my order.  Hell, customers who ordered after me got theirs before me. So overall, this place is just alright.  I'm not sure if I would really come back to this place again in the immediate future as there are so many other options to choose from in the area.",0.8986,0.797,0.135,0.068,0.38652136752136745

2017-01-11,4.0,"The hype of Cafecito was unbearable.  It sits just 2 blocks from my office, but I'm just not willing to wait in that line to get a... sandwich!  I've had Cuban sandwiches before and they're good, but not necessarily any better than any other sandwich.  But the hype defeated my will, and I broke down and went to the more cozy version over on Dearborn.  Now, I've been here before, but only for the coffee after a meal not long before close (their coffee is okay).  Pleasantly surprised that at dinner time this location has only a handful of people, so I'm able to order right away. I ordered the Chivito, which has beef, cheese, fried egg, some veggies, and sauce.  I wish they had beer & wine... I get my sandwich in just a few minutes.  It's a decent size, about a foot long, and comes piping hot.  Eating in, but they offer no plates or utensils, just the sandwich wrapped in paper.  Plates would be nice, especially since the sandwich is messy... It's fairly difficult to eat, but it's at some point after the first bite the messiness is forgotten and you become a convert.  This is some good s**t!  The ingredients meld in together and with the bread that's crispy outside and soft inside, held by the cheese.  The combination of the flavors go well together, and combines into one unique taste.  Very impressive sandwich.  At $6.50ish for this size, why would anyone pay virtually the same for Subway or Jimmy John's?  Now I understand why the line at the Wells location is so long for lunch... Still, I'd skip the lunch line there and head here for dinner, where you can get the same thing with much less wait.  After all, no sandwich is worth a 30 minute wait in the cold...  I'm giving it 4-stars based on the less-than-optimal eating conditions and the averageness of their coffee drinks, but that sandwich is a winner.  Need to try a plate dish next time, and if that's equally outstanding I may up it .2 stars to round up from 4.6 instead of rounding down from 4.4...

2016-12-27,3.0,"I have now been twice, and they have good options for Loop office workers but otherwise aren't worth a trek. I first tried the much-acclaimed Cuban, but found it lacking flavor. Not enough mustard! Not enough pickles! Not enough spice on that meat! It left me woefully missing the more substantial and interesting version at Nana and other restaurants.  Having taken some advice from friends, I went back and got the guava-q with chicken. The sauce here was pretty good, no better than any other BBQ nearby. The caramelized onions were undercooked (and not particularly caramelized), but the chicken was cooked properly. Before Smoque opened at Revival and Blackwood opened close to the River, this probably would have been the best way to satiate a barbecue craving in the Loop.   As it is, I sort of doubt I'll be back soon.

Unfortunately, I find the dark roast coffee too astringent and depending if I need coffee or food more, could cause me to eat at Dallop, whose food I haven't tried yet.

My friends ordered some of the plates, which featured crispy plantains and other delicacies. Everything was wonderful, and I was so impressed with the size of the sandwich I got for around $7-$8! I ordered a Guava and Dulce de Leche Cheesecake to go, and was less impressed with it because it seemed the only guava component was the syrup on top; the cheesecake was yawn-worthy in my opinion.

It's creamy, rich and comforting. I know I will be craving it once the cold weather hits. The ropa vieja sandwich was an excellent first timer choice. The beef was slow roasted, shredded and tender with bites of black bean and tomato creole sauce to balance out the flavor, all tucked between two toasty buns for individual bites of perfection. When the flavor gets boring (like after devouring half the sandwich without coming up for air) the chunk of sweet plantain on the side cuts through the heaviness. A fabulous sandwich. So Yum!

Still good, but IMO not as good as Chivito.  Enjoy... I know you will.",0.9848,0.725,0.275,0.0,0.5285353535353535

Inside you'll find a coffee & sandwich shop, the atmosphere is a totally laid back coffee shop.  Spacious seating that includes a sofa and coffee table, along with plenty of tables for dining and working. The list of sandwiches on the menu is truly impressive. The Chimichurri is by far my personal favorite; the chimichurri sauce is one of the best I've had found anywhere, seriously. The Cuban sandwich everyone knows, of course, you have to try the Cubano; roasted pork, ham, swiss, pickles, and mustard. The roasted pork here is incredibly tender and seasoned to perfection. Another surprisingly great sandwich is the Chivito; steak, ham, bacon, fried egg, mozzarella, lettuce, tomato, onion, and citrus mayo. You also have to try the Black Bean Soup; it's amazing.

2016-04-20,3.0,"I stopped by Cafecito for lunch today, as I was in the area, and had a decent meal. Décor: It's a small place, with not much to it, but it seems that most grab and go (so while the line can get long there was ample seating at the handful of tables). The menu is large and easy to read, hung right above the register, and the case of ""sweets"" looked very tasty. All the tables and counters were nice and clean and the place, overall, was inviting. Bathroom: unknown Staff: The cashier was friendly, the food was prepared rather quickly, and they even had a guy taking orders from the semi-sizable line that had formed so that, before you paid, your food was already in the works. It was a very nice touch. Food: I had the Pollo Chimichurri platter. In addition to the grilled chicken breast (which was sizable) it had a small (but just about perfect) side of rice and beans plus a few plantains. Overall it was fine... I had it to go and it was still warm by the time I got back to the office. Except the plantains... those were, sadly, cold. Value: For what I received it was decent value. However, I think the price should come down by a dollar or two. My meal was just so-so but I'd give them another try with one of their sandwiches (which is what it seemed like nearly everyone else was ordering).",0.9849,0.842,0.139,0.02,0.5024083196496989

Cafecito is located right next to a hostel so it is always booming with business. It is a really cute cafe, very comfortable seating and just a very positive, hip atmosphere. Originally I had ordered Cuban coffee and elveez but then I changed my mind last minute and told the cashier I wanted the lunch special for that day which was Cuban bean soup. However, the cashier was very unprofessional, she kept laughing while taking my order and goofing around. She kept turning around to her colleague to exchange looks and giggles and as a result, she ended up charging me for the Cuban bean soup and the elveez. In addition, I specifically asked to drink my coffee from a regular coffee cup that coffee is served at cafes in and instead she put it in a to-go cup even though I was really vocal about not wanting a to go cup. I kept my cool but I was furious. It was a really cold day in Chicago and I had walked over seven blocks in the snow/slush so that I could get overcharged and ridiculed? I already didn't like the service. I really didn't like the Cuban bean soup; I thought it was anything but a soup, it was just ride and beans, it wasn't a soup at all!

I literally just left cafecito after giving them a second chance and am even more disappointed this time around than I was the first time.  I ordered a palomilla Steak sandwich. There were about eight tiny pieces of flavorless Steak on each half of the sandwich I was given. The bread was soggy, the shoe string potatoes were stale, and the tiny bit of lettuce they did give me, was so sad looking I almost shed a tear.  Even after adding salt, I just couldn't enjoy it whatsoever. I'm not one to say, ""I just can't do this"" when it comes to food but I could not believe the lack of presentation and the lack of effort they put into making this sandwich. I went up to the counter and explained the aforementioned issues and Caroline said that all she could do was give me a gift card and no refund. I opted for the gift card but will give it to a friend that works nearby the other cafecito because Jesus Christ, I will never visit their establishments myself again!

2015-09-29,5.0,"If not for the otherworldly Montreal-smoked pastrami at Fumare Meats in the French Market, the Loop's Cafecito might get my vote for best sandwich in Chicago. It's arguably the best thing you can get in the Loop, despite being neighbors with a hostel and a dairy queen. Adds to the charm, I guess. The Cubano gets a lot of love from the local publications, and rightfully so. I've had a handful of Cuban sandwiches in my life and Cafecito's is as tasty as I can remember. The roast pork is slightly too dry, but the ham is juicy and the rest of the sandwich measures up. Personally though, my hands down favorite is the ropa vieja. The nicely marinated skirt steak is just the tip of the iceberg, as the addition of very nicely caramelized plantains and and delightful tomato sauce make this sandwich absurdly good. The guava-Q comes in a close second for me, based almost entirely on the strength of its sweet-slightly-spicy barbecue sauce. In fact, all the sauces on the board have been delicious. My wife rotates between the jerk chicken when up for spicy and the pollo arugula when feeling more mellow. Finally, I love the addition of a cortadito or cafecito (sans milk), which is a nice afternoon shot in the arm. Like any proper espresso, it should be downed relatively fast, so it's not a with-your-meal drink. The lines are never absurdly long here, which is strange because the food is so dang delicious.

I'm a sucker for plantains.  The sandwich was great.  The plaintains gave just the right amount of sweetness to go with the salt and spices of the meat.  The bread was well toasted on the outside, and soft on the inside.  For $6 its hard to go wrong.  Expect to pay $5-$7 per sandwich, and if you've never had a cuban coffee then give it a try.  The free wi-fi is nice, and the service is fairly quick.  It can get busy during lunch time though, so finding a place to sit can be difficult.  I'l be back.  You should too.",0.9461,0.77,0.135,0.095,0.5230850980850982

Hate to say, but even the tuna at Potbelly or Jimmy Johns has more flavor. For the price, the sandwich was pretty small and if you don't want a salad, side options are limited.

2015-08-14,4.0,"Mmmm their namesake Cubano is a must. I've stayed next door at the adjoining Hostel a few times and I grabbed some Cafecito on my way out in the morning of my most recent stay.  I settled on the Cubano and it lived up to its name. They stick with the classics; nothing but roasted pork, ham, swiss, pickles, and mustard. The bread is pressed in a way that makes it proportional and doesn't dwarf the rest of the sandwich as often happens. The meat is marinated and roasted up so that it takes on a caramelized quality. The cheese is melty and the choice of Swiss makes it not too overwhelming in terms of taste. The pickles and mustard are not an afterthought; not the type you'd just pick off the sandwich and cast aside. These are condiments you will want more of. As a whole, talk about flavor.   Can't wait for a return visit so I can dabble into some more sammies.",0.1154,0.991,0.009,0.0,0.40625

It was perfectly flaky and crispy on the outside but warm and yeasty on the the inside. They also weren't stingy with the chicken portion which is also very nice. It was also prepared fairly quickly!

A little extreme, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. The one thing to keep in mind - if you get the jerk chicken sandwich, make sure to tell them light sauce and to give you more on the side. The first time I got it and the entire thing was soaking in sauce. The next time I ordered and said light sauce, they hardly put any on there. So to be safe, tell them light, and ask for some on the side to add more should you need it.

The espresso was great - nothing extravagant, just a great caffeine boost.  The only knock on this place is that it doesn't have a lot of seating, but I came pretty early on a sunday afternoon so we managed to find seating.

2015-04-20,4.0,"On a recent business trip to the Chicago area, I decided to stop by Cafecito prior to attending the HIMSS conference. What is there to write about Cafecito that has not already been said? It is an excellent place to get some authentic Cuban sandwiches and food. Food: Being that this was the first time I had ever dined here, I felt it most appropriate to get their flagship sandwich, The Cubano. It definitely delivered. The flavors were authentic, the pork was moist and, and the bread was AMAZING. For me though, I felt like everything was a little under-dressed. Though the flavors were great, I had expected a little bit more of a flavor-punch from the mojo-infused pork, or in the form of some sauce, or maybe just some additional salt/seasoning on the whole thing. Mind you, this is strictly a personal preference, and the flavors were excellent -- I just wish there was a little more of them. That said, and as stated above, the pork was nearly perfect. It was fresh, moist, and had a very subtle flavor that coaxed a lot of additional flavors out of the additional components of the sandwich. The bread was the star. I nice and crispy, yet tender outer-crust, yet a soft and pillow-y interior locked all of the flavor into a beautifully-pressed capsule of awesomeness. Lastly, I also grabbed a Chocolate-Chipotle cookie. I was a big fan of it. It was not very moist, but the real experience was the slow-burn of the chipotle in the back of your throat after you had consumed the cookie. It was really very interesting because you get none of the flavor upfront. It all comes later after you have swallowed (That's what she said?).   Food: 4 / 5 Service: I thought they went above and beyond in terms of service. For how absolutely-nuts and busy this place was, the staff was smiling, talking with customers, and providing an experience that I personally wish was present at every small business restaurant across the world. That type of hospitality, regardless of how seemingly small and obtuse it may be, still sets them apart from a typical establishment. I could tell that they took great pride in their product because it showed through their confident and friendly service. Service: 5 / 5 Atmosphere: As mentioned above, this place is nuts-busy! Why wouldn't it be though? They serve some excellent food at a fair price. That said, don't expect to find a place to sit during prime time lunch or dinner hours. It was packed with a line that travels well outside the door and out to the sidewalk. For me, there are waaay to many people, and waaay too much going on for me to even want to sit down and dine there. I would always get a sandwich to go and enjoy it in the calmer comfort of my home/hotel room/the park/etc. Despite that though, their attitudes and general demeanor really help in creating an atmosphere where you feel valued and welcome. Atmosphere: 4 / 5 Price: I feel like I got more than what I paid for. My sandwich was 5.79, and was worth every bite, and then some.  I was thoroughly impressed with the product I received for what I paid -- especially in a city like Chicago! Price: 4 / 5 Final Thoughts: Though I wish that my sandwich packed a little bit more of a flavor punch, that is purely personal preference and could not possibly take anything away from the excellent food, top-tier service, and overall enjoyability of this experience. I firmly believe that if I lived in the area, I would eat here at least once or twice per week.

2015-03-31,4.0,"The Cuban sandwich--a tasty delight or communist propaganda infiltrating our fair nation? The Chicago Swallow has crossed into enemy territory and reports back.      First, allow me to allay your fears with a few facts. The Cuban sandwich as we know it today is not at all part of the Red agenda; rather, it was invented in the continental United States by Cuban expatriates bent on leaving that oppressive socialist state. Industrious immigrants married ham, pork, cheese, pickles, and mustard. The marriage is consummated on a bed of Cuban bread. Like the crushing vice of economic oppression, the sandwich is then pressed to give the crust a satisfying crunch.      The options available at Cafecito go far beyond the traditional jamon (ha-MON) and queso (KEH-so). A full 20 sandwiches grace the menu as well as a handful of platters, served with rice, beans, and plantains (a delightfully curious, lightly fried banana). With the cheapest sandwich selling for a mere $4.99, the adventurous eater can come back again and again to try them all without so much as a pinch on the pocketbook.       Alas, the popularity of the restaurant may be it's greatest enemy. Coming in at noon on a Tuesday felt like queuing for government rations. The Swallow waited patiently half inside and half outside the restaurant. Thankfully, it was on a spring day when one needen't worry about blustery Vortices or Northerlies. A well-dressed comrade working at the restaurant took the patron's orders while in line to expedite the process. But, to change one's order before reaching the register would probably be received with something akin to a firing squad.      Finally the sandwich comes. The Chimichurri comes with a choice to make. Chicken, the delicious, squawking bird of Cuba or the most American of meats, the noble steak. The long-time reader knows what this Swallow prefers. Tender, juicy cuts of beef were drizziled with a healthy portion of Chimichurri sauce, an import from Argentina containing parsley, garlic, sunflower oil, and vinegar. How was it? It is this author's opinion that if President Kennedy tasted one of these in 1962, every blue-blooded American would be eating one for lunch followed by a Cohiba as a digestif. 4.5 Swallows.",0.9843,0.801,0.14,0.059,0.5156565656565656

2015-03-02,5.0,"Cafecito deserves to be around 50 years from now, and if it is it will probably be the last good cuban sandwich shop in Chicago.  Okay really though, you cannot go wrong stopping in at cafecito. The cafe con leche is my go-to and i will probably die double fisting two tall cups of it clenched in my espresso fueled fists. The regular cafecito itself (espresso with a lil bit of sugar) is also great.  The first sandwich I had here, I went out on a limb and blindly ordered the jerk sandwich, having never had jerk chicken before or a cuban sandwich, and was instantly love-stricken with a passion for both. The jerk sandwich is excellent, with well portioned red onions, plenty of flavorful and tender chicken, appropriately thin sliced tomatoes and a great sauce all sandwiched between what is now maybe my favorite sandwich bread. This bread is SO good that I order it with butter when I have the black beans and white rice (an excellent vegetarian option). The Cubano is also excellent, very meaty with good tang and is the only sandwich I enjoy having mustard on. I'm confident that if Cafecito only served espresso and their cubano sandwich they'd have near the same level of high business. I've also had the pollo chipotle sandwich, a great combination of fresh ingredients that doesn't taste cuban as much as it just tastes, well, good.  The service is great as well, cafecito is not a sit down restaurant. It's a walk-up-and-order restaurant that should probably stay that way. The longest I've waiter for anything at cafecito is maybe 7 minutes. Also, decent cuban music.  For a first timer I recommend a small cafe con leche and a jerk sandwich, and for a veggie first timer i recommend the 16 oz black beans and rice with a side of buttered bread.",0.995,0.755,0.205,0.039,0.5545925263367123

Located next to and in the same entrance as a youth hostel, it's a must check out for anyone who loves them some Cuban food. A couple of us tried a Classic Cuban as well as a Ropa Vieja. That action hits your mouth and it gets real! Great flavors, all mingling as friends on your taste buds. The sandwiches aren't huge, but are good size and for $6.50, it's a good deal! Crazy good and very fast service. Low key type place were there's a decent number of seats and lots of people getting stuff to go. I paired mine with a Cafe con leche and it made for a great walk back on a dreary afternoon.

Great Cuban coffee, whether you get the sweetened espresso, a cortadito, or a cafe con leche. Soymilk's available too. But the real standout is the food. This place was my introduction to Cuban sandwiches and I haven't had a better one yet. I've tried the Cubano (ham, roast pork, and cheese with mustard and pickles), the ropa vieja (beef stew, plantains, black beans), and the lechon (roast pork with veggies). I'd skip the ropa vieja, but I loved the Cubano and the lechon. I also love the caldo gallego soup (sausage, white beans, and spinach in chicken broth), and you can order a cup of it on the side as a combo deal. Also tried a spinach salad with avocado and shrimp and hearts of palm, which was equally as amazing as their sandwiches. On the sweet side, they have great Mexican wedding cookies and milkshakes in all kinds of unexpected flavors, like passion fruit. All the sandwiches are around $5-7, which is a great deal considering you're surrounded by boring and expensive chain restaurants.

It has steak, grilled onions, tomato, lettuce, and shoestring potatoes. I LOVED it! Granted, the steak was more like chopped up 1 cm x 1 cm squares (they were so tiny, they kept falling out!), it was wonderfully seasoned and went very well with the veggies in the sandwich. Folks go there to chat and study, so a free table was rather scarce. The acoustics of the cafe make it a poor choice to get anything done in my opinion.

This place has been on my radar since this yr's Lolla, but I read ""cafe"" and ""coffee"" and have never had Cuban food before, so I was a bit off-put, despite the awesome reviews b/c Native Cafe also had amazing raves but was pretty disappointing.  Anyway... pretty empty, 5 other customers there the entire time I ordered & ate. Definitely college-town hippie cafe vibe w/ bare ceilings, chalk menu, TV, & coffee.  The gal working the register was nice enough. Ordered the POLLO ARUGULA. Waited 5-10 minutes for the sandwich, told her I'll have it here, but got it in a paper bag anyway. They also sell pastries and deli-style pre-made salads, which looked really sad & empty at that hour... oh well. It's 7:30pm. The sandwich arrived cut in half, which was appreciated, and IT WAS GOOD. The chicken was very flavorful, bordering over-seasoned, the arugula plenty and fresh, and a bit heavy on the ""citrus"" mayo that didn't taste like citrus at all, but it an all-around GREAT SANDWICH.  BUT... I would also say that Corner Bakery & Panera serves a great sandwich too. Nicely seasoned, toasted... nothing wrong with it, but nothing earth-shattering either. Would have been nice if the server stopped by while I was eating to follow up since it wasn't busy, but hey, it's a college/hipster hang-out.  It's worth stopping by for something more interesting & to support a local business, esp. for such a great price ($6-7).

They said that it was the equivalent of 4 shots and I said sign me up. I did not share it other than give the wife a little tasty taste. It does come with some sugar in it and while I felt that it was not necessary, I ordered it as it was described. The wife chose her standard non dairy latte and she enjoyed it. I tasted it and it was smooth and creamy, and I usually don't like lattes. She also got a coconut dulce de leche tart, which she thought was phenomenal in flavor.

2014-07-22,4.0,"I knew that pressed sandwiches  awaited me as I stepped through the doors of this establishment. They are conveniently next to an international hostel in the University district of the Chicago. Let me tell you - I've never had a Cuban like this before, and I loved every second of it. The three sandwiches ordered by my group were the Choripan, the Guava BBQ, and the Pollo Chipotle(mine). The only downside to my experience is that my sandwich came out maybe 10 minutes after my friends' did. I'm pretty sure it was up and ready, but no one grabbed it and called my name for 5-10 minutes. That was frustrating because I was just making awkward glances as my mouth was salivating from staring at the sandwiches of my compadres. Lucky for me though, I had some tasty plantain chips to snack on. When my sandwich got to me, it was so warm. As I pulled apart the halves, the cheese stretched through the center and all that time I spent waiting was forgotten. The chicken was a little dry, but it was covered in the saucy nature of the chipotle mayo that it didn't really matter. It balanced it out more than anything. The basil was fresh and added so much delight to the experience. The only thing I would have done differently would have been adding a guanabana milkshake.",0.9045,0.828,0.105,0.067,0.5321759259259258

I ordered a Jerk Sandwich, a small order of mixed olives and a flan for my desert.  I walked back to work, (I am on lunch) opened the bag and what was in it ???? A completely different sandwhich and a completely different side was in it, THAT'S what was in it.  I do not like pork, and of course I got a sandwich with two types of pork, one of them being ham and I think the other was lechon. And the side order was some roasted red peppers. What can I eat that with? She got the flan part of the order correct (lucky me!! food for my hungry stomach). So basically all I will be eating today is flan.  I would also like to add that the woman, with the light curly hair did not have the best customer service skills. Maybe if she was a little friendlier, she would have been in a better mood to get my order correct. After I paid with my debit card and signed the receipt, she just starred at me for a few seconds (about 30 seconds) and then realized I needed my receipt. I thought we were waiting for the second copy to print during the stare down but then she finally figured it out. If she would have been kind and just asked if I needed anything else, then I would have known that the receipt wasn't printing, and she would have been able to move her line a little faster.  If I was having a lighter day, I would have went back but that is not the case. I am so not happy that I did not get to eat lunch today.",-0.5498,0.924,0.03,0.046,0.4335748792270531

The Cuban, while somewhat small, was packed with good flavor, the kind of flavor that let's you appreciate the subtleties of flavor vs. some over the top combination.  While I didn't get a ""Cuban"" coffee, my American style house brew was fine.

2014-06-22,3.0,"Came here for dinner with a friend on Friday night around 7:30.  Walked in and all the tables were taken, so I waited on one of the cute couches. Didn't get any dirty looks for not ordering, so that was a plus. They probably didn't even notice, since there was only one person working the store at the cash register and maybe one cook in the back. When my friend got there, we went up to the counter. We were first in line and it took about 5 minutes for the worker/barista to acknowledge our presence, even though we were literally right in front of her, with our wallets out.  Service: Barely passable I ordered a cubano and cafe con leche, which came out to $8 something. She made the cafe con leche on the spot and it was wonderful. Definitely more of a coffee-flavored drink than actual coffee, but it was delicious and the perfect texture and temperature, so I didn't burn my tongue on the first sip. I went to get a table and the only unoccupied one had the last patron's trash all over it, so it was up to us to clean up if we wanted a table. Definitely did not add to my dining experience. The patron was at fault for not cleaning up after herself, but Cafecito should really look into hiring extra help, especially on a Friday evening.  Food: OK The cubano was pork, ham, swiss, something else, and mustard. It was really chewy, unpleasantly so. I like my sandwiches to have a 2:1 middle to bread ratio. Instead, it was the other way around, mostly really thick bread. It was just bland and the only flavor came from the mustard. I didn't taste any ham, only pork, and it seemed tough and overcooked. I'm wondering if my sandwich was a fluke because everyone else seems to be a big fan of their sandwiches. Even the cubano at Panera Bread was ten times better than this mustard pork sandwich. My friend ordered the exotic salad, which looked like spinach, shrimp, and avocado. It looked really pretty, but I don't think she was blown away. Atmosphere: Excellent The only winning point of Cafecito is its ambiance. It has a comfortable, relaxed feel, and isn't too loud or quiet. Next time, I might forgo the sandwich and just get a drink.  We ended up staying past 9, their closing time.

2014-05-01,2.0,"This review calls for a disclaimer as I do realize I am judging a Cuban cafe on Argentinian fare. I know this. I still give Cafecito 2 stars because putting this on their menu is fully on them. I had the Choripan and am sad to report it failed on several levels. The chimichurri is overpowering. This would be ok if it was delicious chimichurri. It is not. Too vinegar-y, not enough garlic, so runny it turns the bread green and soggy -- generally a bit sad. The chorizo itself is dense and bland, nothing like the fresh, tender and herbalicious Argentine chorizo I grew up with. I would give this place even fewer stars if not for the fact that the dulce de leche roll I got was pretty nice. I may come back and try the Cuban sandwich before I write this place off.

I've been coming here for years, whether it's to hide from a busy world for the length of a café cubano, or to chow down one of the tasty, pressed sandwiches, like the classic cubano.       But I was hungry the last time I dropped by. I needed a meal. And the lechon sure hit the spot. It was cooked just the way my abuela would have cooked it, had I had an abuela. My German oma had a way of cooking schweinfleisch that was grandmotherly perfection; but this puerca had that cuban touch: a little crisp on the outside, very moist on the inside. Complete with some healthy black beans and rice. Oh, and the plantains. I love a good caramelized plantain.       Bonus points because their refrigerator reminds me of the time I spent in Medellín, Colombia: cans of Colombiana and Postobon soft drinks, the latter being the sponsor of Club Athlético Nacional, one of the Medellín area's four soccer teams, and the national champs last year. While people were parading through Chicago for the Hawks, I was a fair weather fan in Medellín, trying to dodge flour being thrown in the street. That's how they do.      Ah, the memories you can have with Cuban lechon, of your non-Latina grandmother and of a country just across the Caribbean Sea.",0.9878,0.839,0.155,0.006,0.35846560846560843
2014-04-22,4.0,"Cafecito has been on my list to try out for a LONG time. I heard they had inexpensive Cuban lunch food so I was excited. I finally made it out here last Friday when it was decent outside and I had time to make the trek from work. It's in a building right next to the hostel off of Congress. The seating area is small... there are a few tables and couches and really has an informal, chill feel to it. It was busy the entire time I was there (I arrived around 1pm) and you need to be strategic in finding a seat. As my tip said... have a friend scope out and hold down a spot while you order or vice versa. They will call out your name and deliver your food to your table. It was about a 50/50 ratio of folks getting orders to go and dining in. My friend eats here often so I followed his lead on the menu. We each got the Tilapia Criolla pressed sandwich and it was really good. The fish was well seasoned and prepared. We also got a side order of plantain... it's not listed on the menu, but if you ask, you shall receive... well provided it's stocked. The lady at the register said that it's not on the permanent menu because they don't always have it available, so really, you do have to ask. Good to know! Unfortunately, the plantain was over ripened and gross. I really wanted it to be good too! I thought I was on the come up on finding a hidden item on the menu! I know how hard it can be to find good quality, perfectly ripe plantain in the city and I guess Cafecito has the same problem. If I were them, I would have kept that off the menu last Friday though. No bueno. They have a variety of pressed sandwich options on the menu as well as platters that come with rice, black beans and, I hate to say it, plantains...

In fact she was a bit scared and creeped out because the night before she watched World War Z and walking through the city filled with tired, hungry people who had just finished running a marathon was bringing back some rather frightening memories of zombies and chaos. However one taste of the jerk chicken sandwich took all those terrors away. Juicy chicken, delicious jerk spices, creamy mayo... It also chased away any thoughts of wanting some over salted fast food Chinese. On top of that, I got us a chocolate cookie to munch on.

Since this was my first time, I got a cubano sandwich to kick off this cafecito tasting the right way.  While my friend, a repeat diner, got the Guava-Q sandwich (also amazing).  The cubano was exactly what i was looking for-- pork, ham, cheese and pickles all sliced thin, melted between pressed spanish baguette bread.  I got a limonata pelligrino, but they offered choices like jarisco and sangria (the non-alcoholic soda).   Service was wonderful too.  As soon as you walk in, they take your order and ask your name.  You wait for your food and it comes in a brown bag and you just grab your drink on the way out.  Music in this place ranges from anything from spanish rock, bachata, salsa, local favorites and etc -- great cultural ambiance.  And let me talk to you about location.  The one on East Congress is located right next to a hostel.  Keeping it on the ""DL""  there's seating both in their location and next door.   The bathrooms are also located in the hostel.  Great way to get up and work off a little of that cubano sandwich you just ate.   I don't know about you, but a cup of coffee after a great meal like this is always deserving. Their coffee menu is just as amazing as their food menu.  They offer classics like 'cafe con leche', 'cafe cortadito' and much more.  Their hot chocolate (i kid you not) smelled just a like a churro-- that is what you call heaven.  It was a perfect balance of chocolate and cinnamon and they don't offer this drink in small, only in large-- now i know why.   Overall, this place is a great place to kick back drink a cortadito and enjoy a cubano.  Definitely will be stopping back to try the other sandwiches and coffee :)",0.9979,0.796,0.199,0.005,0.5210648148148148

It's very warm and inviting establishments with some of the best latin tunes ever! You will find students eating, studying, and conversing over a lovely cup of cafecito. The owner's son is very personable and a charming fella. If you need a recommendation, he has got you covered!  I adore the menu...the plethora of Cuban sandwiches. My goal would be to try each one (although this might take me awhile) but thus far, my alllll time favorite is the chivito. If you are on diet, who cares get it! If you don't like a sandwich with all those meats, again, who cares--get it! It is so amazing! Crunchy bread, fried egg, lovely potato shoe strings, and citrus mayo smothered on steak and ham! It's like breakfast on all freaking occasions! Now, who wouldn't be crazy about that?!  I've also tried :  steak chimichurri which was good... the cubano which was amazing as well! Probably the best damn cubano I had thus far!  the ropa vieja sandwich, and this was my least favorite. Sorry. :/ It just tasted like the meat and sauce was burnt. It didn't have that abuela love I was looking for.( If you want good ass ropa vieja in the Chi, you go to 90 miles or Siboney) Now, I'm a huge fan of a good ass espresso drink...so I would recommend a lovely cafecito or even a cafe con leche. It had me at hello...and will seriously help you forget that Starbucks exist. Not to mention, you will question why Starbucks exist.  Lastly, YOU MUST GET those Mexican wedding cookies that my fella's mom bakes herself. He did warn me that those little gems of goodness are the best...and boy, was he right!

Totally amazing.  The second time, I had the Aton (tuna) sandwich, which was also great... although the vegetables might take the cake on this one. Who knows. I'll just have to go back and try them both again to be sure. If I have one/two complaints, it's the seating area and the lack of bathroom.

2013-07-26,5.0,"Great sandwiches and other yummy stuff at a fair price. I ""discovered"" this place as I have just started a job nearby and was referred to the place by co-workers. I am hispanic myself and am more than well-acquainted with rice and beans and other latin fare and am not easily impressed with offerings from restaurants - even the five-star places - that are out there in Chicagoland. But Cafecito has not only won over me completely but has made my family - even more picky than myself - into huge fans. My mother, whom formerly managed a restaurant and is an excellent cook herself, loves the Cubano and several other sandwiches and is a Hearts of Palm Salad fan too.  The sandwiches feature flavorful meats and trimmings on perfectly toasted Gonella bread. I pretty much love all of the two dozen or so sandwiches they serve - they are better than any fast food fare downtown and shame nearly any of the myriad other Loop sandwich makers as well. And you get all of this at quite reasonable prices. The salads are equally fresh and feature ingredients that you don't often find in the average restaurant salads served in this country. My favorite are the Chopped Salad and yes, the Hearts of Palm salad, but you'll undoubtedly find other as well to your liking - they are all good. The flavorful and zesty rubs and sauces that are in the sandwiches take already good ingredients and make them that much better tasting.  Service is reasonably fast given the large crowds and long lines that form at the location with which I am familiar (located by the Chicago Hostel entrance on Congress Parkway.) But if you are getting carry-out as I usually do, you might want to check your order before you leave the register as I have run into some issues with forgotten items. (Not to excuse this on their part but they are very, very busy almost all the time and are rushing to serve everyone as fast as they can so forgetting an item here or there is probably inevitable. So just check the bag quick to make sure you are getting the right amount and type of items.) The only other caveat to eating here is for those whom are sensitive to spicy food should be wary of the Jerk sandwich and the Black Bean Soup is definitely not for the shy of spice! The Beans and Rice can also be a bit much for those whom have a tender stomach. I am okay with the ""heat"" level myself but fair warning to those whom are spice-intolerant! I have not had breakfast here yet but I intend to rectify this oversight soon! Not much of a coffee drinker but the cafe con leche is really good. If you haven't had this blend of coffee and milk - try it, you'll find it quite a treat.  Five stars - there are few places in this city with this much quality at this fair a price.

Our sandwiches were ready pretty quickly. The bread was authentic pan cubano and the meat was tender and well-seasoned. Good frijoles negros (black beans) and maduros (sweet plantains). Sis and I were pleased with the portions and the food was such that it stuck to our ribs (which we needed to brave the wind outside).

It's about the only part of the sandwich I could taste, however - pickles lacked punch, swiss cheese was fairly bland, the ham was just alright. Furthermore, while it is inexpensive, it's also fairly small - not really enough food, even for lunch.

Cute little place - tiny, really.  Sandwiches, salads, coffees and pastry.  Order at the counter and your items will be brought out to you.   I really like Proveletta a lot - lots of cheese, roasted red peppers and chimichurri sauce that was pretty outstanding.  We also tried the Choripan, which has chorizo and grilled onion along with the same chimichurri sauce.  Very tasty, as well.  I like the dulce de leche roll I had as dessert and would go so far next time to maybe only eat a couple of those with the delicious coffee.  Loved the Cortadito, which had a smidge of foamy milk in it.  My only complaint is that the double was still pretty small for the price - also good coffee?  Yes I would like a bucket-size of it because, well, why not.  It would have me stopping in every day if I could. It took a few minutes for our food to come out but the place was pretty packed.  It was also fairly inexpensive, coming in right around $20 for two people to eat a rather filling dinner!

I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but from what I understand and smell it is fantastic. My personal favorite sandwich from the place is the Pollo Chipolte it is a wonderful blend of spicy mayo, sweet basil, tomato, melted mozzarella cheese, and chicken all pressed into a nice bread. Very tasty and the price is amazingly low. I'd be willing to pay almost 10 bucks for that sandwich but it is more like 7. (I probably shouldn't tell them to up the price!) The place will make you an instant fan of Cuban food and their dessert tray on the right will make you consider making so many unhealthy and bad decisions (but also being so good!) while you wait for your order. The time it takes to get food can be a little slow which is acceptable as they're making it pretty much on the spot for you so expect about 5 minutes or so to get your food depending on what it is.

2012-12-13,4.0,"Wow, thank you, Yelpers! I discovered Cafecito when I was in Chicago on a business trip last month because I checked Yelp to see what was near my hotel. Lots of people spoke highly of this place, and y'all did not lead me astray -- Cafecito is fantastic. In fact, I went back a couple of days later with colleagues because it was so good. I had the steak chimichurri the first time, and it was so good that I got the chicken chimichurri the second time. Liked the steak better, but both were delicious. The chimichurri was a nice blend of herbal flavors and garlic. It's toasted like a panini. I got some stuff to go, as well -- black bean salad, a mango pastry, Mexican wedding cake cookie (yum!), and sweet Jeebus, an alfajore that was so good it should be a controlled substance. No, really. If you go, you must get one of these. I insist. The folks who worked there were very kind and welcoming. Cafecito's next to a hotel lobby (like a lot of restaurants in the South Loop), but it feels like a neighborhood cafe where college students might hang out to study or something. I liked the combination of tables and comfy chairs, which gave the place a casual, homey vibe. The ONLY reason Cafecito's not getting 5 stars from me (and I wish I could give it 4.9 stars, not 4!) is something that, from a business perspective, is a reward in itself: Both times I went, it was crazy packed with people. The first time I managed to find a seat, because it was late in the evening and people began clearing out just as I got there. But the second time, I went at lunch, and it was slammed. People were lined up out the door. The staff did a GREAT job of taking people's orders in line, and by the time you got to the counter your order was pretty much ready. But there was nowhere to sit at all. So I'm delighted for them that business is so great, but they really do need more space! Here's a suggestion: Maybe they could buy out the Dairy Queen next door. The world does not need another DQ, but it definitely needs plenty of Cafecito. TL;DR: If you're in the South Loop, don't miss Cafecito. It's wonderful. Just don't go at the lunch hour.",0.9986,0.755,0.232,0.013,0.5493333333333335

Now, I'm not sure that I've ever actually had Cuban food before, so I don't really have a base to compare this to, but both the sandwich and soup were delicious! The tangy pickles and mustard on the sandwich were the perfect topping for the ham, pork, and swiss. I put a little bit of Frank's Hot Sauce on a few bites when I got back to the office too. The soup was pretty good as far as soups go, and it had a few more zesty flavors I haven't been accustomed to in soup. A nice surprise!

2012-12-04,3.0,"Cafecito is a little over a mile from my office, so it is far yet not far. There's no point in grabbing a cab or jumping on the el, but it's quite a hassle to walk that distance (times two) when there's only an hour for lunch.  The amount of stars and awesome reviews for Cafecito got me up out of my seat, though, and walking all the way over for some sammies and whatever else I could get my hands on. Disappointingly, however, Cafecito is only three stars for me. I base these stars on wait time, accuracy of orders,  quality of food, and the staff members.  I docked a couple of stars because the wait was quite long. I came in half past noon and the line was piling up. Luckily, I crammed my way into the front of the line and even avoided dirty looks from others! I waited about 5 minutes, gave my order, and then waited for about 15 minutes. I don't think the wait should have been so long considering I had one of the bigger orders at the moment (I peeped what was going out to people) with only two sandwiches and a soup. I also docked some points due to the fact that somewhere between the cash register and delivery counter, I got the wrong sandwich in my bag. I didn't even think to check before leaving as I was in a rush to get back to work. When I sat down at my desk super excited to try my jerked chicken sandwich, I saw that I had a Tilapia sandwich instead. Considering the fact that I put quite some thought and time into choosing my two sandwiches, I was really annoyed. I mean, I still ate it, but yea, I was totally annoyed.  The only thing that brought my mood back was that the Tilapia was really very good. It wasn't plain like some fish sandwiches often tend to be, and I just loved how much lime or lemon flavor there was that I tasted. I can also say that the Ropa Vieja was delicious with the combination of meat, sauce, and the perfect plantains. The black bean soup didn't disappoint either.  A few other positives about Cafecito are that the prices are reasonable, the employees are all really friendly, and the bald guy behind the counter running things is a kind of a hottie.  I guess three stars is a bit harsh considering they have good food that is undeniably Cuban and the vibe is casual and friendly, but I don't think I can bring myself to give it four stars when the wait is so long and I'm not even getting the items I ordered.",0.9898,0.804,0.132,0.064,0.6430477915804004

Price.  Place is reasonably priced, which obviously is great. Now the cons: Flavor.  I had both the Cubano sandwich and the Jerk Sandwich (yes two... don't judge)  The problem, they were kind of bland.  The jerk had a little bit of heat from the spices, but not enough.  The real issue though was the chicken was overcooked.  Only thing worse than overcooked chicken is under cooked chicken.  So if you had to error one way, thank you for making it that direction. Overall: Not terrible, but definitely nothing special.  We'll order from there again, but more out of lack of delivery options rather than loving the food.",-0.69,0.74,0.116,0.144,0.6553854875283446

I was not disappointed!  The Cuban bread was flat and toasted well, while the pork and ham were both tasty with individual flavors.  I liked that the mustard wasn't overpowering which I've often found in Cuban sandwiches.  I ordered the pickles on the side.  Service was quick and efficient and I brought the sandwich home.  Damn, it was good!   One star off for lack of ambiance - I think this place could get really popular if they invested in decor with old school metal tables and chairs and maybe some memorabilia or flags or something on the wall.  It is a bit of a weird location inside the hostel but I think if you spruced the place up, it would be on a lot more people's radars!",0.6309,0.902,0.062,0.036,0.6263961038961039

Cafecito is the oasis in the Sahara that is the culinary scene of this neighborhood. The coffee is GREAT and the pressed sandwiches are delicious and a bargain at under $6. The Cuban is, of course, good but a lot of the other sandwiches are worth checking out too (I'm partial to the pollo arugula which comes with a delicious citrus mayo). I have yet to try the chimmichurri sauce, but I suspect it's the bomb. This place is legit. Also, the salads, oh, the salads! So good. I hope they make the Exotica Salad, which has been on the specials board for a few weeks now, a permanent menu item. For $7.49, you get a giant salad with spinach, tomatoes, red onion, corn, hearts of palm, and grilled shrimp tossed in a lemon vinaigrette. And they do not skimp on the shrimp. It's healthy, it's filling and it's fresh.  Only qualms -- $5 credit card min (which bums me out when I just want coffee and have no cash), no bathroom in the restaurant (you have to get a keycard and use the one in the adjacent hostel), and the black bean soup was a little watery for my taste.

2012-08-07,5.0,"If you are going to try one restaurant in Chicago and don't want to spend big money, this is your place! This past weekend was Lollapalooza in Grant Park, which is just a few blocks from Cafecito. My boyfriend and I planned to eat at Cafecito before heading to Lollapalooza aroud 5 pm on Saturday. As all Chicagoans now know, a massive storm hit around 4:30 pm, causing Lollapalooza to be shut down for a few hours. Due to its proximity to Grant Park, Cafecito quickly filled up with frustrated, wet, tired Lolla-goers. The employees at Cafecito handled the crowd BEAUTIFULLY. They provided extra chairs for people to create their own dining area since all of their tables were occupied by those of us that got there before the storm hit. It was such a comfortable environment to be in, which was quite the contrast to the dark, stormy streets outside. There was salsa music on in the background and the Olympics were being broadcasted on the restaurant's TV, so we sat back, enjoyed our incredible food (I'll get to that in a minute), and waited out the storm before making our way back to Lollapalooza- once it re-opened, that is. So, the food. I ordered the Pollo Arugula sandwich, my vegetarian boyfriend ordered the Jardin, and we split the Black Bean Soup. HOLY CRAP. My sandwich was incredibly delicious. The chicken was the BEST I have ever eaten in my life. It was perfectly marinated and juicy (their menu says they marinate all of their meats in their Cuban mojo sauce) and was perfectly complimented by a generous helping of arugula, fresh tomatoes, and red onion. Not to mention, the sandwich had a perfect amount of their homemade citrus mayo, which I would eat with a spoon, no matter how disgusting that sounds. It was all surrounded by their bread, which was like nothing I've ever had. It was almost like a thinner, less chewy foccacia. They press the sandwiches while they cook so that the bread gets crispy on the outside and holds everything inside wonderfully. Seriously, I cannot stop raving about that sandwich. My boyfriend's sandwich had mushrooms on it, which I am not a fan of, so I didn't try his. However, he said it was amazing. It had red peppers on it, which he normally hates, but he left them on the sandwich because they added really nice sweetness that complimented the eggplant, and he didn't even mind their texture, which is normally why he won't eat them. The black bean soup was magical. I consider myself a black bean soup aficionado- it's always been one of my favorite foods as it's so easy to make and so damn delicious. Cafecito's black bean soup is the best by far that I have ever eaten. It didn't have that gummy texture that some bean soups tend to have, no- this soup had a lovely, lightly spicy broth with WHOLE black beans. None of that mushed garbage that you get at most restaurants. It was so warm and delicious and wonderful on that rainy evening, we were both sad when it was gone! And if it wasn't great enough on its own, it's served with a side of their bread that I raved about earlier.  The storm was still raging on after we finished our meal, so I saved our table while my boyfriend got back in line to order some dessert while we waited. The line was winding out the door, but it didn't take him more than 5 minutes to come back with a Dulce de Leche pastry and a slice of Key Lime pie. (I didn't mention this earlier, but when busy, Cafecito takes orders Portillo's-style, which speeds up the ordering process immensely). I tried a bite of the Dulce de Leche pastry, and it was great. Flaky dough surrounding creamy, dense, slightly chewy caramel center. Seriously good stuff. The Key Lime pie was my favorite though. I had to slow myself down from eating it because I wanted to prolong the magical experience. It was perfectly tart, and the lime flavor came through strongly. The sour was balanced by creamy sweetness, and everything was held together by the perfect amount of graham cracker crust. I never wanted that slice of pie to end. Well, clearly I am a fan of this restaurant. As long as I am within 1.5 miles of Cafecito, I will walk there. If I ever lose my legs, I will crawl there. It is that good. Go.

2012-08-01,2.0,"Okay... Enough of the Gringo hype... Lets keep this real. The Ropa was decent. It was cooked a bit too long for my taste, but its not unlike Ropa I've had at a relative's house. 4 stars to that. The filling for the cuban sandwich was probably the best I've had outside of the caribbean or florida. The bread was most definitely NOT cuban bread, which in my opinion really hurts the sandwich. Cuban bread is not as dense as other breads which helps the flavors of the meat and pickles come through. I mostly tasted mustard. Now I imagine it might be hard to find decent Cuban bread here, so I forgive this mistake, but I would suggest more mojo or something on the meat to have the spiced pork flavor come through. I would say over all not bad of a sandwich. 3.5 stars there. The pastries are not made in house, but are not too bad. Just okay... 3 stars.  The BIG issues I have with this place are just a couple ones that no decent Cuban would ever allow to exist in his/her restaurant...  1) The maduros were friggin verde... Not ripe enough by any means to come close to being called maduro. They may even have been frozen. Any caribbean latino should know how to make this (super easy) dish correctly. Its like screwing up a fried egg.  2) My husband asked if they has tostones. The yes got him very excited until they handed him a bag of plantain chips. Again, any self respecting Cuban knows the problem here. And if you don't, then you are probably among these people rating this place as 5 stars. They are not the worst I've had, but I certainly will not come back. Back to the mission of finding decent Cuban food in the area!!",0.9866,0.799,0.145,0.056,0.47710317460317453

Hint, those were all the vegetarian sandwiches haha). Their artichoke salad and Chocolate chipotle cookies (yup) are also worth a try. They even have smoothies! I had their Guanabana smoothie and it was delicious---one might think that means guava + banana---not that I thought that or anything.....but it's actually a Cuban fruit that tastes like strawberry, pineapple, citrus, and coconut all rolled into one.

2012-07-02,5.0,"Mmmm, Cafecito! Where do I even begin? I thought I would give Cafecito a shot since I am interning in the hostel adjacent to it this summer, assuming it would be your typical run-of-the-mill, convenient cafe. Boy, was I in for a tasty surprise! First of all, the Cafe Con Leche is absolute perfection. I have developed a habit of getting a large size of this tasty coffee treat a few times each week before work. I usually am not a fan of sweeter coffee drinks, typically preferring my coffee black, but after taking the suggestion of a friend to give it a try, I am sold! It is incredibly reasonably priced for a coffee, and has a smooth, creamy taste that isn't too sweet or harsh in the morning time.  My only complaint (and it is so tiny that I almost feel I shouldn't mention it, but in the spirit of full disclosure...) is regarding the desserts and pastries. For me, they have been hit or miss. I really enjoyed the ""Mexican Wedding Cookies"" (my mom makes them and calls them Snowball cookies, so I may be partial to this taste of home); you get a box of about 10 or so for $5 and the manager told me that his mom makes them. They aren't always available, but if you see them by the register, give them a try! However, I tried a Coconut Dulce de Leche pastry the other day, and to be honest, it didn't do it for me. The crust was chewy, not crunchy, and the taste was bland. This is a small issue compared to the rest of the amazing menu, however. I will continue to try different pastries and see what hits the spot! Now, onto the mother of all bites to eat, the pressed sandwiches. I have absolutely no words to properly describe how in love I am with these sandwiches. So far, I have tried the Cubano, Palomilla, Pollo Arugula, and the Margarita, and I plan on trying many more. The Cubano was rated the #1 Cuban sandwich in Chicago, and for good reason. The Pollo Arugula stands out to me, due to its delicious citrus mayo and healthy amount of arugula (which I love). What makes these sandwiches the best is the bread. It is crispy, crunchy, soft in the middle, and flavorful. The sandwiches are ready quickly, and are astonishingly inexpensive for the value. I mean, you could order a sandwich at Subway for the same price. I am dreading the day that Cafecito's manager wakes up and realizes how outstanding his sandwiches really are, and jacks up the prices. (I would still buy them.) Well, my long-winded rant is over.

On the last day, we were in a rush so we decided to eat here and I was so sad that I didn't come here earlier. First, there are a lot of sandwich options. I ended up getting the Pavo sandwich, which was avocado mayo, turkey, bacon, lettuce and tomato.  I love turkey bacon sandwiches, but this isn't your ordinary turkey bacon sandwich. The avocado mayo is super genius (I never had it before) and it was quite creamy and made the sandwich less dry. They also didn't stack up the sandwich with bacon, which was good because it overall felt really light. The sandwiches come out all nice and toasty too, which was awesome. The panini bread is so goodddd, with just the right amount of crunch.  I also got an iced coffee and my friend got a iced chai. They're both really good!

2012-05-19,4.0,"FANTASTIC sandwiches, great milkshakes, okay desserts.   Thank you yelp for directing us to this awesome sandwich place.  We ate here twice during a conference trip, once for breakfast, once for lunch.  As recommended on here, we ordered a Ropa Vieja sandwich, and a passerby told us we had to have the Jerk chicken.  Both were fabulous and spicy.  The Ropa Vieja was sweet and smoky, thanks to the beef and fried plaintains; the Jerk chicken tasted crisp and fresh: it was spicy grilled chicken and lots of a creamy dressing and fresh veggies.  I was glad we got two things that didn't compete with one another and were fantastic in their own way.  The next morning, we each had a breakfast sandwich (eggs, cheese, steak), which were also good.  I think their secret, besides the great filling, is that the bread is perfect: crisp and buttery on the outside and chewy and soft inside.  I got a guava milkshake, which was perfect with the spicy sandwiches, and I believe that it was made of sweetened guava pulp and milk, so not terribly unhealthy.  We tried a tres leche cake and were not impressed.  There wasn't anything wrong, it just didn't live up to our high expectations based on the rest of our meal.  We didn't end up having coffee, which I regret bitterly and will remedy next time I'm in Chicago. We were lucky that it wasn't packed either time we went because it was absolutely full two other times we happened to walk by.  There's a lot of foot traffic because it shares an entrance with a hostel, but I enjoyed the people watching.",0.9855,0.798,0.17,0.031,0.6564351851851851

You have to try the food at Cafecito. I don't know if this is authentica Cuban or not but all i have to say is that it is absolutely delicious and tastes like momma's cooking.  I had the Ropa Vieja...so much flavor and spices. I wish they gave more beans with the rice though. THe beans also had a nice flavor to them. I was a bit disappointed with the rice though. It was on the tough side. And of course I had to try the cafe con leche. WOw, best coffee ever. I had it as decaf and even that was delicious. Lastly, I had the Chipotle cookie for dessert. That mix of spiciness in the chocolate sweetness was so nice. I would certainly go back here.  I did not choose to sit and eat here as it is not really the place you go for the ambiance.

The ambiance: It's right next to Robert Morris University and adjacent to the Hostel International Center. The atmosphere is a weird mix of lounge, art exhibit, and/or break room (you know, like the ones at work). Whatever it is, it's bright and clean. I've only been here for studying, and it's a great environment if you need to work aloud with someone. The food: I've had the Ropa Vieja plate, sandwich, and a Cubano sandwich on my three visits. All three are good. I actually don't think the plates are worth the price given the sandwiches are pretty comparable in size and a better value. The ropa vieja is full of burnt caramelized flavor that it's ridiculous (my mouth is watering as I type this, actually). The ropa vieja sandwich has some pan-fried plantains inside it, which goes beautifully with the savory pulled beef. At less than $6, it's an amazing value. If you have Google Offers, you can continue printing out unlimited (as of 4/15/2012) coupons for a free soft drink/house coffee with the purchase of a sandwich. It's a nice way to save almost $2 on your lunch.

Located right off Congress, it's accessible for countless folks (students, young professionals, librarians, etc.). Do a couple circles around Wabash and you can find some parking. The interiors small, so if you're looking to sit down try to avoid the lunch rush.  1:00PM, defiantly rush time. They handle it well. The barista/coffee station gal' asks everyone in line if they want coffee. Get a Cafectio, Cafe Con' Leche, or your favorite poison. They'll add an uppercut of flavor to pair with that roundhouse kick by whipping up some fresh brew. The manager (possibly the owner) asks everyone in line if he can get a sandwich, salad, pastry, or side worked up while you wait for the cashier.  I'll get my one complaint over with. I simply got the wrong sandwich. I originally ordered the Ropa Vieja and their Valentines Day special sandwich (chorizo, shrimp, arugula, red onion, tomato, and citrus mayo), with a side chopped salad combo. With out  checking my bag (my fault), I walked to the car with a Tilapia sandwich and full chopped salad. When I went back, they quickly addressed the mistake of the wrong sandwich and got me the special, but not the Ropa Vieja. I think there was just some mis-communication, not a big deal. They let me keep the tilapia sandwich, so I didn't bother to bring up the Ropa. Mainly because my car was flashing hazards on Congress. DA GRUB: The special was fantastic. Nice plump  tender shrimp, spicy chorizo (not crumbled, the actual cured sausage, bonus points!), plenty of arugula, and just the right amount of that harmonizing citrus mayo. Their bread is perfect, not too thick as to take away from the sammich and not too light to fall apart as you scarf, plus it's got just the right crunch.  The tilapia, I only took a couple bites and gave the rest to a friend. Sadly, I cant say the same for this sammy as I did for the special. They don't lose points because I never asked for this, just a case of crossing wires during a hectic part of the day. The tilapia was a little dry and the accompaniments didn't exactly make it all better. Again, NBD.  They've got a nice selection of pastries like churros, croissants, and other goodies. Plenty of fresh sides like hearts of palm salad, potato salad, pasta salad, and more. A great cold drink selection that consists of South American canned juices and sodas.  Cafectio is fantastic sandwich spot that offers a whole lot more than a Cubano sandwich. Great prices with even better value and accessible for anyone commuting to and from downtown.

I had the Guava-Q: rich pork belly in a savory yet sweet sauce with guava pressed into a delightfully crispy sandwich. I also had the cafe con leche which was very good even if its not quite the best coffee I've ever had, and finally some sort of turnover (strawberry and cheese?). The turnover was the only thing I found lacking because despite its flakiness, it wasn't sweet at all and there was barely any filling.  The cashier was very helpful and kind but seemed a little miffed when I asked for a plate for my turnover. Only 'plate' meals get a plate apparently and the pressed sandwiches are wrapped in just paper. When I want to eat in I like to have a plate between me and the table that people eat on etc all day and the turnover was just handed to me in a thin transparent paper bag, so a plate was a necessity. I think for at least the desserts they need to give out plates without people asking. The sandwich without the plate was a bit annoying too.

They serve Cafe Bustillo for all their coffee drinks, which tastes great and is very affordable. Sometimes, the drinks are inconsistent in quality--I typically order the single cortadito (espresso shot with a a spoonful of milk and sugar, as it states on the menu), but depending on the barista it could be a spoonful of milk or a while 4-6 ounces of milk. It still tastes good, so I don't complain. The one qualm, if you could even call it such, is the place gets PACKED around lunch time during the school year because it's right near Columbia College and it connects with the hostel.  So I usually go early or late and it's all good.  Go.  It's great.  Support a locally owned business and protest the overpriced and/or fast food in that neighborhood.",0.9934,0.776,0.183,0.041,0.4920952380952381

I came in for an early dinner and the place was not too crowded, just a few college kids or maybe some from the hostel next door. The service was quick and extremely helpful.  I had a mate soda, a Cuban sandwich, and a milhoja (a dessert made from puff pastry and dulce de leche). It was all fantastic. Filling, but didn't sit too heavy in the stomach.  The decor of the place was not overdone. I was kind of expecting something kitschy, but it was simple and comfortable. The sandwich and dessert even came simply wrapped in parchment paper with plenty of napkins.  I'm already making a list in my head of what to try the next time I go back. Number one is the ""Elveez""- sweet plantains, peanut butter, and guava on a sandwich. Heaven, basically.  They also had flan and other pastries that I'm sure will be just as delicious as the milhoja.

The sandwich I had is the Chivito - steak, ham, bacon, fried egg, mozzarella, lettuce, tomato, onion, shoestring potatoes and citrus mayo.  It's almost a hybrid of an Egg McMuffin and a Big Mac -- Cuban style.  But better.  Waaaaaaayyyyyy better (and admittedly, I'm no enemy to fast food).  A shelf of hot sauces give you a choice of zazzing up your sandwich.  The heat pressed bread is crisp and firm, perfectly sealing in its inner contents.  With each bite, one is guaranteed crunch, the right measure of gooeyness, and a dense layer of flavors.  And it's a decent sized sandwich for the price to boot.

Conveniently located in the South Loop and just a few short blocks from Depaul, Roosevelt, and Columbia College, it is the perfect place to grab lunch with a small group of friends. Decor: Simply fantastic. The space is a bit small, but the hand-painted murals really add some fun charm to the room. The comfortably mis-matched furniture pieces and tables are spread out evenly and allow for easy navigating. They have all sorts of cute lanterns and reviews of how much everyone love their food (and trust me, EVERYONE loves their food) on the walls and from the rafters. My only complaint is about the row of two seaters - the people who have to sit against the book case can't lean back for fear of knocking them over! Maybe those should be bolted in place...? Service: I always see the same two girls manning the counter and they are the sweetest people I've ever met. They're very friendly and chatty, making the best recommendations. They walk the food out to you, know you by name, and make sure you always get what you want. One of the girls is dark-haired, wears it in a braid, and runs trays/makes coffee. The other one works the cash register has lighter, curlier hair and she is always smiling. These girls rock. Seriously. Best service ever. Food: Okay, the Jerk sandwich. The Cubano. The Ropa Vieja. If I got stranded on a desert island, these sandwiches (and an italian beef from Portillo's) are what I would request for food. The cubano is as every cubano is: ham, pickles, cheese, pressed bread. But the cooks in the back must have some magical fairy dust that they sprinkle on - it is the best damn cubano sandwich I've ever had! The Jerk sandwich? Amazing as well: spiced chicken breast, lime mayo, lettuce. And the ropa vieja? Yummy shredded beef in a great hot sauce with a suprise plaintain! So good!

(But I will definitely be back for the sandwiches too) Only bad thing is the sandwiches took a little long to prepare. I suppose this is good since they are making them fresh, but next time, I will do with several others do and call ahead if I only have time for a short lunch.

Well worth the money. Their tuna salad, olives, and hummus are all delicious and very reasonably priced. The hearts of palm salad is a bit too salty for my taste.  Their sandwiches are great, I'm especially partial to the Chivito. Meat, egg, potato strings, cheese... a contradiction of artery clogging goodness without the heaviness. Even the pan con mantequilla (bread with butter) is fantastic, especially when dipped in their coffee as my friend suggested to me. Also, their deserts are deliciously deadly.

I went at a down time and am happy I did because the amount of seating in that place is incredibly minimal. The interior is darling for a cafe-type setting, but it's not exactly adequate when you watch a line of at least 50 high school students charging into the hostel next door. This place could probably survive on the hostel's business alone, but then Cafecito had to go and do something crazy - they actually made food that tastes delicious.  Although I really wanted to try the Chivito (three meats, an egg, cheese, and shoestring potatoes on a sandwich just sounds deliciously evil) I opted for the Jerk Chicken. The bread is delicious, the chicken was tender, and the habanero lime mayo was perfectly spicy. Just the right amount of lettuce, tomato, and red onion was added to my sandwich, and I found myself picking up every last piece of lettuce that fell onto the wrapper and eating it just so that I could prolong the enjoyment of my meal. Lunch buddy had the Palomilla - steak, shoe string potatoes, and grilled onions - and it was also very good. I think that would be an awesome place to go with a friend and order two sandwiches that you both want to try and then split them. We also both had a churro, but they were really nothing special (could have been better if actually warm). Even though I really want to go back and try other sandwiches, the sign advertising plated dishes intrigued me even more. This place offers comforting cuban food in a really accessible coffee-house type venue. I can't wait to go back and try a plated dish (and maybe get a Chivito to go!) because I'm sure another visit, so long as it is as good as this past experience and so long as I don't have to deal with 50 patrons of the hostel beating me in line to order, will turn review into a 5 star experience.",0.9935,0.786,0.161,0.053,0.48507936507936505

And the Choripan (Argentinean chorizo) is very tasty and the sausage is of very high quality. For me on a latin sandwich, it all starts with the bread. The bread used here is very fresh and not the typical stale french bread youll get at other sandwich joints. For a nice kick, add the chimichurri sauce to the sandwich. Cafecito has been consistent in my experience in providing good food and service. The only thing that keeps it from a 5 star review is that they have very few side dishes.

Being a DePaul student, you get your fair share of the usual places (Subway, MyThai, Corner Bakery, fast food places). He yelped the place and mentioned ""Cuban food,"" ...hello! I was so there.  Only a block and some walk away from DePaul's main loop campus, Cafecito is right by Hostelling International. It has a small interior but very quaint. Music in the background. Flat screen on the wall with news going. And always bustling with people, which tells you that it's a big hit around that area.  My first time at Cafecito, I had the Chivito sandwich (Steak, Ham, Fried Egg, Bacon, Mozarella, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Shoestring Potatoes, and Citrus Mayo - per their menu) and Chocolate (as described on their menu, another word for Spanish Hot Chocolate). My friends and I sat while we waited for our food and drink to be served to us. Yes...they brought it to us! Through all of the hustle and bustle, even if you get a small drink, they still have time to serve it to you while you wait...that's quality, I'd say.  The sandwich was amazing! I wasn't sure what to expect because I have never had a Cuban sandwich before, but my first time experience was a good one thanks to Cafecito. The bread is crisp and packaged tightly around the sandwich filling. Everything blends together very well. Egg isn't runny or anything, just a nice bite.  The Chocolate, which is Spanish Hot Chocolate, reminded me a lot of Mexican Hot Chocolate...full of spice but slightly different. My friend had the Cafe Con Leche, which I tried the following time and needless to say, it was fantastic. You can really taste the potentness of the Cuban espresso. I once tried Cuban espresso in Miami...but since then, haven't really had anything like it at coffee shops like they have it here.  They also a wide variety of desserts if you're looking for a coffee and something small to snack on.  (+): upbeat atmosphere- fits in with being in the Loop, friendly service, and good quantity and quality for the $$.  (-):  Maybe more seating for busy hours Other add-ons: If your in the loop or a student at one of the many colleges located downtown, why not swing on by and try something aside from the typical sandwiches that are offered everywhere else in the city?

The Chivito sandwich is a sandwich that has everything in it - steak, ham, bacon, eggs, cheese, lettuce, onions, shoestring potatoes - a bit too varied for my tastes, but it was like eating steak, eggs, and bacon all together... which is never a bad combination.  At $6.00, it's a bit pricier than the Cubano, but also solid.",0.9352,0.813,0.159,0.028,0.46156462585034014

Yea, they have wi-fi - and it's free! This place is super fabuloso! I really mean it. I love the Latin music. It makes you want to linger here as long as you possibly can. The woman at the counter is a gem. I called since the little side note here on Yelp told me this place was located between State St & Plymouth Ct. - which didn't make sense since that's W. Congress and the address for here is E. Congress - she nicely explained to me how to get here on the phone.  She nicely greeted me when I got here. She nicely offered to walk over to the cooler to help me figure out what can of pop was what (they were in Spanish). She nicely brought me my sandwich instead of calling from the counter to let me know it was done. Put her in a ring, and show her off; a gem! I played it safe and got the Cubano. It was delicious. Came out hot, but not to the point that to eat would mean sacrificing my taste buds for the rest of the day. The bread perfectly embraced all the goodness inside. The meat was tender. The pickles, not too tart. Mustard and cheese were just right. If I didn't have a dinner party later, and was already stuffed, I'd get a different sandwich. Mmmmn, but I just took a bite out of my cookie. Almost tastes like horchata made into a cookie with nuts and danced in powdered sugar! hor-chat-ahhhhhhhh I am happy.

2010-09-22,3.0,"I ran across a number of five star reviews for Cafecito, thought it sounded great, and was astonished to learn that it's in my hood. How did I not know about this place? Probably because it's tucked away on a lesser-traveled section of Congress between State and Wabash, next to a youth hostel and a Dairy Queen.  From the ""Cuban cafe"" description in some of the reviews, I expected a place with a little more flair. So I was little taken aback when I walked in. Based solely on decor, this could have been any chain coffee shop. What sets Cafecito apart is everything else: The pressed sandwiches, the array of deli salads, and, of course, the ""cafecito"" itself (Cuban espresso with a teaspoon of sugar). I was impressed to see no less than five vegetarian sandwiches on the menu. And not just plain-jane grilled cheese types, either. They have a grilled veggie (the Jardin), a margarita, a sweet plantains with peanut butter, and a guava. And yes, a gilled cheese, but with roasted red peppers and chimichurri sauce to dress it up a bit. Tons of delicious-sounding meat varieties for you carnies (especially the Cubano...roasted pork will never not sound amazing). I opted for the Jardin. It came with eggplant, red peppers, mozzarella, mushrooms, arugula, and jalapeno hummus. The eggplant was overly vinegary but everything else worked really well. Especially the arugula. I wish more places subbed this in for spinach, the peppery flavor is so much better. My favorite part of the sammie was the bread. Tastes like French, nice and chewy and crispy. Not being super hungry, I skipped the sides. They looked great. I'm definitely taking home some potato salad and jalapeno hummus next time. They also sell Jarritos and house made milkshakes in healthy sounding flavors like mango. The place skews pretty young, thanks to the low prices (most sandwiches are around $5.50) and the proximity to several colleges nearby. The register and kitchen were run by what looked to be students and the rest of the dining area was populated by students, as well.  I wouldn't call this a five-star experience but Cafecito will definitely be on heavy rotation from here on out. Highly recommend if you live in the area.",0.9969,0.806,0.183,0.01,0.4923148148148148
2010-09-08,5.0,"WONDERFUL. I love trying new places but once I came here I didn't want to go anywhere else for lunch out during work. The atmosphere is great, always fun music playing, plus a mounted CC TV. The owner is an alum of Columbia College Chicago right down the street, which is awesome not only because I go there but knowing I'm supporting a local is a much better feeling than tossing my money toward McDonald's or some other ridiculous national chain that only cares about their profits.  Alright so as for the food. They have everything. Their pressed sandwiches are all made to order, natural, and with such great ingredients! I'm a vegetarian and there are surprisingly tons of options - my usual is the jardin (eggplant, mushrooms, peppers, arugula and their HOMEMADE jalepeno hummus). I like to get a salad combo and take their hummus to go to have for the week. You can also add plantain chips for a quarter more than the chips. Great selection of salads like black bean, pasta, tuna, potato, you name it. There are desserts in the fridge case like mango pie and flan too. They really know how to make cafecito. I mean come on of course they do, it's their name. I usually get the cafe con leche. Make sure to grab a punch card: buy 8 coffee drinks and get the 9th free! I can't say enough about their sincere service either. Only twice in all my times of going there (at least once a week) have they gotten something of my order wrong. The first time she simply forgot to give me my chips with my to-go meal. I came back and she apologized about 19038764 times and offered me a free bakery item. Another time I brought my mom during the crazy lunch rush, and the girl got caught up in everything and forgot about my iced coffee - I stepped up to the counter to remind her after about ten minutes and she immediately stopped what she was doing, brought it out to me with one of their alfajores (sp?). So kind and really unnecessary, I know they know that there are people out there who would get angry to have to wait or whatever, and everyone who works there is truly loyal to their customers and have a great passion for what they serve.  Whenever anyone comes to visit me we go here. There's no deciding, it's that awesome. Bonus: they have wi-fi! The only ""don't"" advice I have is to go during the lunch rush unless you don't mind waiting in line. It gets really crowded - for all the right reasons!  I know I'm leaving out plenty more wonderful things I could say. Bottom line, go see (and eat!) for yourself. You'll be back again. And again. And again..",0.9989,0.731,0.23,0.039,0.5916351894293069

2010-08-21,5.0,"When school is in session and I'm downtown every day, I think that the majority of my salary from work goes to cafecito.  The sandwiches and coffee are DELISH and CHEAP, especially for downtown.  I get a cafe con leche (less than 2 dollars) or a chai latte almost every day in the winter.  If I'm downtown and need a meal or snack, they're my first place to stop, every time.  I've had the heart of palm and potato salads, as well as a decent number of their dessert options (alfajores- YUM) but the real hit here are the sandwiches. I've probably had almost every sandwich here but my favorites are the provoletta, cubano, jerk chicken, and ropa vieja.  The provoletta sounds simple but it's really outstanding, especially if you're a vegetarian.  We're talking about grilled provolone cheese and chimichurri sauce, pressed on their crispy and delicious bread.  YUM. I've heard great things about their breakfast sandwiches too but have never tried them.  I'm sure the occasion will present itself this year!  Cafecito is in the hostel and has a very laid-back vibe.  I go in there sometimes just to have coffee and get away from the hustle and bustle of school.  The owner and all the employees are very friendly and it's a nice place to have as one of your ""regulars.""",0.9861,0.836,0.144,0.02,0.6375116713352008

My main reason for the update though is that the owner told me the other day that they now have BIGGER SANDWICHES.  They are 7 inches I believe and the same price they originally were.  I thought this place was already a great lunch spot, but now you are getting a better bang for your buck.  If you previously felt that you weren't full when leaving, the new bigger size may satisfy your appetite.  Give it a shot...get a Ropa Vieja.",0.9765,0.834,0.154,0.012,0.4806820080504291

So there are three of us that take a nice walk over to Cafe Cito.  The place is pretty empty for an 11:30 lunch.  My buddy DJ A starts by ordering the Cubano sandwich (Roasted Pork, Ham, Swiss, Pickles and Mustard) for $4.99.  He said it was good but he has had better.  Of course I didn't get to try any, he's a work buddy, not family.  DJ A also orders a drink and some desert.  I did get to try the desert (I had my own fork!) it was a three milk cake that was moist but heavy on the cake taste. I'm up next, so I order a Ropa Vieja (slow roasted Skirt Steak, love me some skirt steak; Sweet Plantains, I usually like the non-sweet ones better but their on a sandwich so what the heck; Black Beans and Tomato Creole Sauce).  It was $5.99 for a six inch sandwich cut in half basically.  It was good but I have definitely had better (read my earlier review on Senor Pan).  I also ordered a Batidos (Cuban Milkshake).  There were roughly five or so  flavors available and I got the Mango.  I've been having Mango smoothies and shakes lately, just one of those moods I guess.  It was a good shake, icy and thick, though it was a little bit light on the mango flavor.  Also I did notice the really cute young woman taking my order, for those who are interested in eye candy while they get their lunch.  She was pretty hot guys.  In talking I did ask her if the owner, who is working in the kitchen in back is Cuban and she told me no. Finally our other workmate, who was in from our offices up in Wisconsin and has never had Cuban food before ordered the Pollo Chipotle (Chicken, Basil, Tomato, Mozzarella and Chipotle Mayo).  Her sandwich was $5.79 and she said it was good.  She also ordered a soda.  Again I didn't try any of her food as she is a workmate and not family. So by the time we finish our lunches and started heading out the door the place was getting packed.  DJ A and I were asking each other would we head pack to Cafe Cito for more Cuban food, I think next time I would rather take my buddy over to Senor Pan, sorry about that Cafe Cito.",0.9951,0.85,0.129,0.021,0.5506565656565657

Our first impression was of the awkward service.  There were a few people ahead of us in line, they placed their order and went to sit, and while the server was making an espresso drink she didn't even acknowledge us.  We ordered, and as first timers weren't quite sure what to expect, and received no further instructions.  We sat down in the mall food-court-like atmosphere and waited. Food-wise, we were clearly not disappointed!  We hoped to start off with a Mamey shake but it didn't arrive until our food did.  I believe the server said it was made with sweet potato and cherries and it was awesome; there was definitely a battle for who got the last sip! I had the Guava-Q sandwich with chicken, he had the Chimichurri.  Both were fantastic!  The paper wrappers soaked through very quickly but neither sandwich tasted greasy; in fact, the seasoning of the sauces was more perfect than anything I've ever eaten (cilantro done just right, for instance, and I'm very picky about cilantro).  I would absolutely recommend both sandwiches but  I think I liked the Chimichurri more. For dessert we grabbed a slice of the Tres Leches cake.  We didn't eat it until a bit later and it was very good, but I would try something different before I ordered it again.",0.9899,0.798,0.158,0.044,0.5422270322270324

So our first weekend, we went and was just blown the hell away. It's a small, family owned business (Phillip and his wife) and produces some of the most amazing food I've ever tasted. They offer sandwiches, salads, coffee and fresh bakery goods. Our first visit we tried the Cuban and the Chuvito. The Cuban was excellent but the Chuvito I have to say, was thee best sandwich I have ever had. It was a food orgasm. It consisted of steak, ham, bacon, lettuce, tomato, shoestring potatoes, fried egg, mozzarella cheese and finished off with a citrus mayo and put together by freshly baked and pressed Cuban bread. They have at least 10-12 other sandwiches I have yet to try but passing up on this one is gonna be tough. After experiencing total bliss, we then had cafe con leche and guayaba (guava) danishes and all I gotta say is...serious? The coffee was some of the best I've ever had. Phillip makes this homemade sticky sugar mixture that he uses and then the danishes...amazing!!! We've been going every weekend since finding this gem of a restaurants.

I was surprised that there is a Cuban Coffee and Sandwich shop in downtown, and upon reading the good reviews I had to give it a try. Cafecito is on Congress Pkwy in between State and Wabash. The place was filled with College types from the surrounding campuses.  I walked in and felt a warm, comfortable vibe right away. Its nice and bright in there with the usual tables and chairs. They also had a couch, coffee table, and a couple of leather seats. I ordered the Chivito sandwich, and a piece of flan for dessert. I wanted to try the Café con leche, but I was still buzzing from the Starbucks I had earlier. The woman behind the counter was all smiles and very friendly as she took my order.  Afterwards I sat on the nice comfy couch and started watching CNN which was playing on the TV. I guess I didn't hear her say my sandwich was ready so she walked it over to me. That was a very friendly touch and very much appreciated. I went in reverse order and ate my dessert first. The flan was so good I wanted to lick every last drop of the syrup, but I fought off that urge. After the delicious flan it was just me and the Chivito sandwich.  That sandwich was so good I felt like getting up to exclaim, ""Ah mi dios esto es delicioso!"" I probably would have said it wrong and ended up saying, ""My God the pants is delicious"" in Spanish. The blend of steak, ham, bacon, and fried egg pressed against the bread was pure satisfaction. I will definitely be back here to try the other superb sandwiches, and the Café con leche too.

First off, I'd like to let the world know that I am not a sandwich person, and my appreciation for sandwiches rarely comes around. This might be my first sandwich that I've ever had cravings for. Be warned that it's Cubano style and the sandwiches come in torta bread; I'm not complaining. My work is just a block and a half from it, and I make sure to come here at least once a week. I recently found out that I am a Cafecito addict when I caught myself driving to the loop just to have a sandwich on the weekend when I wasn't scheduled to work. Wow, you got me good. My personal favorite is the Chivito sandwich. It consists of Ham, Bacon, Steak, Fried Egg, String Fries, Tomatoes, Red Onion, and Cuban Mayo, and the most important ingredient of them all is EXCELLENCE! I could seriously have a Chivoto every day. Other items that I've tried is the Guava-Q and Jerk which I thought were good but didn't live up to the Chivoto which was my love at first sight. Employees here are nothing short of nice and efficient. I see the owner there a lot during lunch time, and he seems like a nice and genuine guy despite his money-making sandwiches. Lunch gets crowded every day, but be informed that the line moves pretty quick, so you won't have to worry about getting back to work late.  When you're standing in line, please consider trying their Alfajores in their big glass jar. It's a South American cooking whose texture reminds me a bit of shortbread and will definitely crumble in your hand and melt in your mouth. The inside is filled with something that resembles caramel and the sides are coated with coconut flakes. Give it a try, and if you don't like it, feel free to punch me in the box.  Anyway, before I can't stop rambling about this place, all in all it is AWESOME. Work in the area, live around this hood, Chicago tourist? Check this place out even if you're not a sandwich lover like me. It'll change your mind forever. And yes, please try the Chivito.",0.996,0.773,0.187,0.04,0.5528268799102133
2010-02-05,3.0,"So a friend of mine recommended this place to me the other day. As a Depaul student in the Loop, there are limited options so I try to find new places to quench my palate. This Cuban cafe is  tucked just off of Wabash, right across from Columbia College. They have an array of sandwiches (their specialty) but also offer soups and different deli salads. I love pork and nothing screams pork like a Cuban restaurant. After much debating I settled for the Guava-Q. A monstrosity of roasted pork, jicama slaw, carmelized onions, and guava barbeque sauce. My friend went with the Palomilla (Steak, grilled onions, tomato, lettuce, shoestring potatoes). I got the combo which for a 1.49 more gets you chips and a drink. They have plantain chips which you can get for a quarter more, which I highly recommend.  The sandwich in itself is not bad, but it also wasn't very good. The pork was tender and had a good flavor. The BBQ sauce was tangy and delicious, but definitely messy to eat. I was not impressed by the ""jicama slaw"". All it seemed is that they took some jicama and diced it up and put chunks on the sandwich. I was expecting more of a coleslaw shape not chunks. If they julienned the jicama and then tossed in their sauce it would be a lot better. The carmelized onions went unnoticed. It's a nice place in the Loop, and I will go back because I want to try the Chivito or heart attack (Steak, Ham, Bacon, Fried Egg, Mozzarella, lettuce, tomato, onion, shoestring potatos, citrus mayo).",0.9786,0.771,0.155,0.073,0.5473706452277881

The sandwich was packed with the standard lettus, tomato, and onions, but the chicken made it great!  The place looses their one star because of the cost of a sandwich and a drink will run you 8-9 dollars and the size of the sandwich is a bit small for my hunger.",0.9719,0.74,0.191,0.069,0.5735294117647057

You can get their salads in different sizes, so you can even take some home. The prices seem roughly on par with what you'd pay at the Jewel deli...maybe a bit higher, but you're gonna get something much better at Cafecito.

Fast forward to Chicago. Cafecito HERE is a lively Cuban boite serving up an array of pressed paninis and rich coffees to a slightly less inert crowd of international travelers (it is on the first floor of the massive Hostelling International Chicago), area students and cubical bees. While the decor verges on corporate blah, a booty-shaking soundtrack will get you in the mood for some seriously delicious tropical grub. Their sterling take on the famed Cubano is near peerless: equal parts Gonella bread, mustard, pickle, Swiss, ham, and mojo-marinated roasted pork shoulder. It is cut on the bias, which makes it all the easier to dip into some perfectly balanced chipotle aioli (my own preference).

Even though it wasn't exactly what I expected, it was still a cute place that hit the spot. Free Wi-fi and fun salsa music make it a nice place to grab a coffee, Cuban pressed sandwich or dessert after work downtown while catching up on your emails.

Sandwiches come out in a speedy 3-5 minutes, and believe me, once you've had one sandwich, you'll need another fix as soon as possible.  I can personally vouch for the Pollo Arugula, Jerk, Pollo Chipotle and Atun. I keep meaning to try new things, but one of those always sucks me in before I can scan the menu. The seasonings for all of the sandwiches are just perfect, sometimes spicy, and never bland.  The coffee (especially con leche) is good too. As others have said, the owner is a great guy, especially since hapless budget travelers (and impoverished interns) at the hostel get a discount. Don't miss this place, its one of a kind!

When I moved to Chicago, where the standards are a) Starbucks, and b) Dunkin' Donuts, I basically gave up coffee. Sure, some of the local roasters like Metropolis and Intelligentsia are pretty good, but I can't always make the trip! Then I discovered the clean, welcoming atmosphere at Cafecito during a rough week of finals at Columbia College. The cuban-style coffee is both delicious and affordable! Though it's a bit different depending on who makes it (at true sign of hand-brewed coffee or espresso), it is consistently wonderful.  Their pressed sandwiches and sides also blew me away. The soup was a great compliment to the sandwiches. All of the sandwiches I've tried have struck a perfect balance of spices, and the jalapeno hummus and bread has made for me many a quick snack between classes. The owner and the employees are very friendly. They are more attentive than I would expect from this casual dining experience. There is a television that usually shows CNN with closed-captioning, so you have something to watch while you wait for your food. There are even some comfy couches encircling a coffee table. Stop on by to grab a bite to go, or sit down with some friends and dip some bread in your cortadito (cuban-style!). You will not be disappointed.",0.9958,0.744,0.236,0.02,0.6410628019323672

Come on Cafecito you can't fry these up in the back? I ended up ordering the Cuban, it was alright but the biggest problem with it was that it had a ton of mustard... all I could taste was mustard. And I happen to love mustard, just not in this quantity. I also was able to try the Choripan and it was a lot better then the mustard sandwich they call a cuban.

I had the day off a couple Fridays ago, and I planned to pick up my guy from work and then pick up some famed cubanos from Cafecito on the way home.  I am aware that this place is not located in an area that is at all conducive to street parking, so I called Cafecito earlier in the morning to be sure I knew where exactly they were located, along with any pick-up/temp parking suggestions. I said it just needs to be a space where I can have my hazards on for the 2 minutes or so it will take me to run inside, pick up and pay for my order. I also asked how far ahead I should call in my order for pick-up and she said she could take it right then. I gave her my order, she gave me the total and I told her when I expected I'd arrive. She said they'd be ready. Easy, or so I thought.  We got down to the location, and it was a madhouse. Pouring rain, and there was absolutely NO parking on Congress, not even a delivery lane. My guy ran in to pick up our order while I drove around the block. He finally called me 15 minutes (about 4 times around the block) later saying he had everything and was ready to go. He got back in the car and I asked him what in the world took so long, and he told me they had to make it. I told him I'd called it in, they had my name, they knew when I was going to pick it up, and he told me the girl at the counter said they never make stuff in advance; they only make it once someone arrives to pick it up.  Well, what was the point of even calling it in?!  To add insult to injury, I'd ordered the cubano, a steak chimichurri and some plaintain chips, which were simply bagged plantain chips - something lost in translation, I imagine, when I'd asked if they had house-made plantain chips.

First off...please tell customers if they should take a seat and you'll bring the food to them.  I stood like a fool in front of the counter for 10 minutes because a couple was doing the same...then I found out there food was to go.  A small gripe, but one I think all restaurants should be aware of. The Cubano tasted great, and I really liked whatever marinade they used on their pork.  I like how pressing the sandwich compacts the bread (who wants MORE bread in their sandwich) and gives the whole thing a satisfying crunch.  The black bean salad had a refreshing bite to it that contrasted pretty well with the sandwich (oh, and it was a pretty mighty portion, by the way). There's a lot of variety here and the dining area was really nice for kicking back with food and reading material.  I'll definitely be back soon...that lechon sandwich is teasing me to try it...",0.9899,0.841,0.146,0.012,0.5905797101449276

Basically, Cafecito makes me want to jump up and do the Macarena! I'm not sure about all the lyrics, but the song is about feeling good and dancing. Cafecito creates such a feeling. As I stood in line an unfamiliar scent ascended through the air. Sunscreen? YES. What an absolutely delightful smell. I never liked the aroma of it before now, but the fact that it's hot enough in Chicago for the girl in front of me to be wearing sun block makes it as good of a smell as the sandwich that was about to put me in an even better mood. Hark the Angels Come! I ordered the ChimiChurri Sandwich w/ beef and for less than an additional $3 dollar, threw in a Tuna Salad and a bottled water. Talk about a combo! I was pleasantly shocked when the tub of tuna they brought me was a portion I would pay $6 at Whl Fds for alone. At Cafecito, I can get a perfect sized sandwich, soft bread and good quality meat along with a tuna salad fit for a prince for less than $10 bucks all together! Revolutionary lyke Karl Marxxx.  Tropical days bring out the the bikers, and Cafecito is a prime location to watch them ride. All around me bright tattoos that hid under lengthy sleeves and long underwear all winter make their spring debut today, as I converse about the lack of class participation in my cultural studies class with my class chum. Enjoying the café almost as much as I, he was slightly distracted observing the kids coming jumpin' jivin' and wailin' to and from the hostel upstairs.

Upon walking in, I was definitely relieved to hear real Cuban music and see that there were no exaggerated or fetishistic Cuban decorations either.  The only moment I was disappointed was when I realized this was a sandwich joint.  I know, I know, Cuban sandwiches are awesome but I am definitely more into the big Cuban meals- I'm just not a sandwich type of gal! Anyway I realized I was really hungry and ordered the Atun sandwich, and my boyfriend got the traditional Cubano. We both got cafe con leches. I have to say, that sandwich might have turned me into a sandwich person. My boyfriend's sandwich, although equally delicious, was not the best Cuban sandwich I've had (sry, I did live in Miami after all). The cafe con leches were also good, but not the best I've had.

2008-12-02,5.0,"My mouth was salivating after discovering, courtesy of Eddy C., that there was a Cuban sandwich shop near the Loop.  I decided to make the trek during lunch, and what can I say, it was a total smash!  At first glance, the place looks more like a cozy coffee or tea shop, I probably wouldn't have thought twice about the food if I just randomly walked by.  That said, I would totally come here to study, surf the internet on a laptop, or read.  I decided to have the Cubano for lunch, which is roasted pork, ham, swiss cheese, pickles, and mustard.  It was totally delicious, crusty and warm on the outside, and tender and wonderful on the inside.  I got a bag of the spicy plantain chips on the side, which were out of this world!!  The menu is pretty substantial, w/ about a dozen pressed sandwiches, specialty salads, breakfast sandwiches, pastries, and cuban coffees.   I can't wait to go back, it's so worth the walk :)",0.9757,0.847,0.153,0.0,0.5822222222222222

2008-11-20,5.0,"A few months ago, I was on a mission for a GOOD cuban sandwich. I searched everywhere and never found a really good place.  I have felt a void ever since.  Until now !! When I read about Cafecito here on Yelp, I just had a feeling that this place would be the one to fill my void.  I was hooked at first bite ! I literally savored every bite of my cuban sandwich.  The aroma was even intoxicating. :-)  Yummmmmmmm. Their menu offerings all look sooo good - sandwiches, salads, and coffes.  I havent had a chance to try other sandwiches, but I am dying to try them - especially the chimmichurri!  And the cafe con leche is made perfectly.  Cafecito is a great chillax kind of place.  A great place to meet up with friend for coffee and snadwiches.  Or a great place to chill with your laptop and coffee in hand.  It has that homey feeling where you just want to linger for a while.",0.9905,0.74,0.231,0.028,0.6737179487179488

My tummy right now couldn't be happier as there is that most wonderful and delicious combination of pork and ham, along with pickles, mustard and cheese in there. The Cubano sandwich here is simply delightful. The sides are awesome (tried a few - the olives: TO DIE FOR) and you get a ton of them! One side is really enough to split with a friend. The hot chocolate? Oh my! Creamy, chocolaty, spicy and not too sweet. And everything is reasonably priced, which really should be a prerequisite for a lunch spot, however not too many places in the loop think so.

2008-11-13,4.0,"Are these low prices for real?  Is this exceptional service for real?  Yes and yes. The food isn't your usual cafe fair, especially when it comes to the more exotic sides.  And the prices can't be beat.  A small hearts of palm salad costs less than $2.50 (for at least 1.5 cups of hearts of palm)!   On my most recent visit, I was having trouble deciding what side to get when the server offered to mix the pasta salad with the heart of palm salad.  What a nice gesture - to save me the money of buying two separate salads.  And the mixture tasted just right; probably better than each alone. This server was exceptionally thoughtful when interacting with other customers too.  A girl next to me bought a canned fruit drink which she found too strong, so the server gave the girl a cup of water to dilute the drink.  The server even told the girl she could grab a different drink if she still didn't like it. This is the way to get repeat customers!   Because Cafecito is connected to Hostelling International, Chicago you are likely to run into many travelers.  I would even encourage you to head upstairs to check out main floor of the hostel after you finish at Cafecito.  It's always fun to explore new places.",0.9699,0.835,0.128,0.038,0.48615838184803706
2008-11-11,4.0,"On a typical gray, cold and rainy November day- like today, I tend to crave simple things to warm me up.  Being as I am- usually anything I seek out for pleasure comes in the form of something I can eat or drink.  Fire places are nice; warm blankets and fuzzy slippers- they are OK too.  If you want to make me happy and feel warm though- get me something delicious and comforting and warm to eat and drink! Knowing that I needed to head downtown today for an appointment, I decided to get out early and grab some lunch in the loop.  Where to go was the question on my mind- something that plagues me quite frequently.  I guess you can call me indecisive (OK- the reality is, I can't make up my f-in' mind about ANYTHING).  Luckily, I was able to find this place off of Yelp, and remembered seeing it listed in Time Out Chicago as the best place for a Cuban sandwich.  With little hesitation, I made a decision to seek out Cafecito- something that even 8 hours later I am still happy with myself about. Little victory for little me anyway. After arriving here in the rain my  choice for what I was going to have was already done as well- Cubano with a cafecito (I'm on a roll with my quick decisions!).  I figure if I go to a place known for their cuban's and their cuban coffee- I might as well try it out!  My partner (the lovely Aurore L) wanted something different and went with the Jerk sandwich. Both sandwiches were quite good- and for the price, we were quite happy!  I think it is a great option if you go to school or work around there, especially considering some of the bland alternatives in the area. For me, it was the simplicity of the sandwich and the sugar-laced coffee that really hit the spot.  A good cuban needs a crunch to the bread (check), tender pork pieces (check), salty ham (check), gooey cheese (check), and a nice acidic contrast with a sour pickle (check).  Sounds simple- but I can't begin to tell you how many times I have had a cuban with soggy bread, or dried out pork, or cheese that somehow hasn't melted even though the sandwich is put on a hot press- or a combination of these things. The cafecito is a delight in itself.  I tend to like my coffee with cream and never take sugar- but the dark, bold and strong espresso with a nice crema done here- with seemingly as much sugar as there is espresso is done very nicely- and was a good accompaniment to the crunchy sandwich. They say it is the little things that count- and these two little simple things brought about some warmth and pleasure ""on a cold and gray Chicago day"" (yes, I know- Elvis lyrics from a very cheesy song).  I will be back- if I am in the area, or if, rather, when I crave a cubano con un cafecito.",0.9968,0.827,0.158,0.014,0.6069826007326008

2008-11-04,5.0,"My coworker and I hiked well over a mile to try the Cubano (Cuban sandwiches/media noche) at Cafecito during our lunch hour.  Verdict?  Definitely worth the trek!   The Cubano had the perfect combination of moist, juicy roasted pork and nice crispy bread.  The portion size is more than adequate for the price (around $5).  You can add chips and a drink for another $1.50, though I would suggest passing on that and going with some plantain chips and a Jarrito (Mexican soda - Tamarind is my favorite flavor).  Trust me -- you won't regret spending the extra money.   Service at Cafecito is decent, though I suspect it might suffer a bit if a lot of people came in at once.  Seating is not exactly plentiful, especially since it seems like they don't mind if you settle down at a seat with your laptop or a book (makes sense considering Cafecito's proximity to Robert Morris College).  When we went, there weren't a ton of people so service and seating were non-issues.  My only complaint is that it's too far away from my office.  It looks like I'll have to take a couple more extra long lunch hours in the future.",0.9638,0.815,0.147,0.038,0.5033625730994152
