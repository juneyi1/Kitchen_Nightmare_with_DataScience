2016-03-17,4.0,"What can you say about a true old school diner.  In a world of ever growing hipster high end restaurants and gastro mumbo jumbo it's hard to properly give this place it's due respect.  It's not fancy.  It's not pretty.  Heck, depending on where you're sitting one might even say it's not clean.  But this is exactly what its supposed to be!  An old school working class Chicago greasy diner.  Owned and operated for decades by the same old Greek guy who manages day in and day out to open the place at 4:00 am and make the local deliveries himself.  The local factory workers filter in pretty early so be ready to share elbow space at the bar if the booths are all filled up.  The motif is very old school white tile diner with no pretension in the decor or service ware.  The mood is fairly high speed, turn and burn eggs and hash browns.  If you want a true, quick, Chicago diner experience please stop in and get your bellys worth.  No local blended coffee, no organic local rare breed chicken eggs or humanly treated pork sausages.  Eat and get to work people!!!",0.6522,0.816,0.102,0.082,0.3897311827956989
2016-03-07,2.0,"The food is good. However, you need more than a good product in order to run a successful business. Customer service is key. I ordered delivery. Im a first time customer and was excited to try and looking forward to being a regular. But my order was messed up. I was sent something completely different than what i asked for. Had to wait another hour for my correct order just to get it and they didnt give me syrup for my pancakes. Probably wont be ordering here again unless its a last resort one day. I am disappointed.",0.7579,0.826,0.119,0.055,0.5660839160839161
2015-12-23,1.0,"I ordered online through GrubHub. The food was 30 minutes past the maximum wait for delivery (on top of the hour I had already waited after placing my order). They called to replace something I had ordered because they were out which would be fine but it was a simple exchange, not something to increase the wait time.  When I called the restaurant to check in, the hosts were anything but clear and helpful. Whoever answered the phone was hard to understand.  The food came lukewarm and the order was wrong. The lettuce was old and our mozzarella sticks weren't cooked all the way through. The to go boxes looked like they were molding. It was altogether an unpleasant experience.  I would not eat here nor would I recommend it to a friend.",0.3489,0.778,0.119,0.102,0.5091269841269841
2015-07-28,3.0,"This place is pricey for a breakfast joint. For about $8 you will walk out with 2 slices of low quality bacon, 2 eggs, and some hash browns and eggs. The grease that comes with it is free though.  It's edible, but don't expect to be wowed.",0.7579,0.827,0.142,0.031,0.55

Pancakes, coffee, OJ all great!  It's only one lady that serves the entire resturant so you may wait 15mins if you need something, she is a nice lady tho.",0.95,0.731,0.269,0.0,0.753125
2015-04-20,1.0,"Listen, this place is fine if you want a bottled soda pop or candy bar.  The staff are nice and prices reasonable.  But that's about it. I love diners and really wanted to like this place.  I ordered a breakfast burrito.  Listen, I get diner grease.  I love Diner Grill and Jeri's.  Tommy's, however, had so much grease that I couldn't actually taste anything.  It's like they dipped my food in motor oil.  However, one bad meal doesn't make the restaurant.  A glutton for punishment, I tried them a few weeks later for lunch rather than breakfast. They fried my hot dog.  No, this isn't some troll prank.  I ordered a hot dog, dragged through the garden.  They took a lonely, scared little hot dog out of the cooler and dropped it into a vat of magma-hot grease.  I don't really know what happened next because I paid, left, and threw the whole bag in the garbage. Not Tommy's Grill, ever, no matter how drunk I get.",0.2089,0.766,0.12,0.115,0.47222222222222227

The coffee is so good, admittedly I've had the same meal all three times - corn beef hash skillet - only because it is so good! I always take enough home for breakfast the next day. I'll explore the menu more but it's tough for me to stray from what I know is good.",0.7649,0.795,0.132,0.072,0.4850233100233101

2013-11-22,3.0,"I am always attracted to these littleout-of-place truck stop diners in the city. This one drew me in for lunch. Decidedly downwardly mobile, and divey, too, it's just south of Damen and Grand. Easy parking, and no reservations necessary. The menu is all breakfast and lunch fare, and there are dinner-type entrees. A pretty extensive menu with the most expensive items being Tilapia and Fried Shrimp at $8.95. Breakfast for $3.00- 7.00. Sandwiches, wraps and salads. You can get a Cobb Salad with Chicken here. Or meatloaf. I opted for my standard diner lunch of a Corned Beef Sandwich with fries and coffee. Around $7.00 total. At lunch, there were a number of people eating breakfast here, so I'm guessing it's a good place for same. Breakfast sandwiches are what they should be, about $3.00. Nice friendly servers with table or counter service. Good cheap eats here in Ukie Village/West Town. And P.S., if you're a coffee aficionado, have a good cup before you get here. It's diner coffee. You'll give yourself a hernia trying to suck the flavor out of it.",0.9618,0.819,0.144,0.038,0.6583333333333333
2013-04-15,4.0,In a world with IHOPs and Denny's its great to have nice local spot to grab breakfast. Portions are plentiful and service is fast. Seating is limited (no more than 4 per table) but I've never run into a problem finding a chair. Definitely a daytime spot do check them out!,0.8667,0.765,0.208,0.027,0.4989795918367347
2011-04-19,4.0,"Having only a McDonald's and a Popeye's Chicken close by on those days you forgot to bring a lunch to the office and tried of Jimmy John's I order from Tommy's Grill. I have ordered mainly breakfast items off their menu and have loved everything I have ordered. I would not recommend the Chicken Breast Salad - I wasn't as satisfied with this.  Iceberg lettuce served with green peppers, broccoli, tomato, egg and the grilled chicken.... I was expecting more or something better than what I got. Although I didn't like my salad, I say that everything else I tried was great!",0.7848,0.82,0.115,0.066,0.7303030303030303
2010-07-22,4.0,"For a 'truck stop"" I have been coming here for many years, and usually I stick to the corned beef hash with sunnyside up eggs and hash browns with a side of wheat toast. Just had one and WOW, I always go back to the places that give me an attack of taste buds.  Although Tommy was not there, there is a new crew who really care about how a place is run while the cats away. These ladies are just so pleasent and willing to take care of the customer.  As all truck stops go, this is one of those that got stuck between times. But its so refreshing to know that the integrity of the place and the fidelity of the food is still the same.  I go every once in while and today is no acception, I LOVED THEM. I rarely give 5 stars so of course this goes into the 4 as almost there. They take you to the place that your mom took you too for breakfast thats for sure. And they now deliver for lunch! WHAT!",0.9265,0.829,0.113,0.058,0.5723695286195286
