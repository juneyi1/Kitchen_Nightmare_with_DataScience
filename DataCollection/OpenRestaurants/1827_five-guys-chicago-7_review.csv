I tried all these restaurants, expect for In and Out Burgers, and Five Guys Burgers. In and Out is only in California, and Five Guys started out in D.C. Luckily, they opened a few restaurants in Chicago. My wife and I visited the one on Clybourn. Parking sucks, there is none...welcome to Chicago! The inside is very clean and bright. The order taker was nice. We told him it was our first time. He explained the burgers and that the small burger is not really small but only one patty as opposed to two beef patties on the regular size burger. I asked about the calorie count on the regular size bacon cheese burger. He said that the burger is known to have the most calories out of any fast food restaurant. We decided to go with the small...which is only one patty of beef. Fries are not included. We ordered Cajun flavor instead or regular. We paid about $14 bucks with no drinks. We realized we only paid for one fry. Good deal because the fries are plentiful. I was happy that the order taker did not try to hustle us and ring up two fries knowing that they are large. Not only did we not finish them because there are so many fries, but the Cajun fries are weird to say the least. Tasted like a bunch of spices, including seasoned salt mixed together. YUK. The burgers are very tasty. Fresh ingredients, steak n shake type meat patty. Buns are very soft and melt in your mouth. I got my burger with everything, and it was very good. Wish I got the regular size minus the fries. At the same token, I saved a bunch of calories I don't need to eat. The inside of the restaurant is an advertisement about how great everyone thinks their burgers are. Kinda reminds me of a sales letter with hundreds of testimonials. It works because people talk about this place like it is the best. I enjoy their burgers, but I have had better. (Obama should of warned us here back home in Chitown). Nothing for them to toot their horn about. They seem to attract a bunch of Abercrombie college kids, but maybe that is just the location - DePaul area.",0.9951,0.832,0.143,0.025,0.5216974895023676

The burgers (sans toppings) rate anywhere from acceptable/mediocre to bland/school cafeteria-ish. There are tons of toppings to choose from but when it comes down to it, a burger is only as good as it's meat and bun. And ... the buns are awful. They always have a pretty stale consistency and dry taste that no amounts of toppings really help to improve.  Also, the fries. Meh. They're fresh cut but bland and I really hate how you order a ""small"" which consists of an 8 oz cup of fries and then your entire brown bag is filled to the brim with a ""topper"". If I wanted that many fries, I would have ordered 20 of them. Please, keep your crappy excess fries away from me.  Fountain cherry coke + friendly staff  = additional star.

I ordered a bacon cheeseburger and a regular sized fries.  To go (not enough seating...and I wanted to enjoy my burger, not be rushed out the door while someone hovered over me).  Only toppings I wanted were grilled onions and grilled mushrooms (I'd sauce it myself...took ketchup to go). I'm not going to say that the grill guys/gals are artisans and they lovingly prepared my burger with grace and finesse.  There are people waiting on their burgers, and the crew is more GM auto assembly line than sculptor and painter.  Yes, folks, they cook burger patties on the grill, and they look great.  That grill was clean, though....one of the fellas came by with a scraper and got the gunk and crispy bits off as quickly as the grill guy could get burgers onto buns.  The assembly gals were efficient...and quick....too quick if you ask me.   The fry guy was hilarious.  He's also the expediter AND calls the order numbers for pick up.  Sheer entertainment...IF you can find a spot to stand and wait.   And, he got those orders out quick.....too quick if you ask me.   ""Order 73,"" was the call.  ""That's me,"" I cried with delirious excitement.  I grabbed my greasy bag, check the order slip and headed home.   Quick....too quick if you ask me.

C'mon guys, the fries are simply NOT that special.  And to compromise the balance of the order for this?  Priorities need to be seriously reexamined.  After all, I paid over $5 for the burger.....

I only went with a few. I didn't want to drown out the taste of the meat. The meat is juicy and flavorful. Everything on the Burger tasted fresh. I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious it was.  The fries are hand made right on site. You can tell this by two things. One is the fresh taste, and the other is the piles of potato bags that line the restaurant's floor.  The only negative thing that I can say about five guys is that it's a bit pricey. But considering the freshness of the food it was well worth it. I would not hesitate to go back. Hopefully they have the same guy programming the I-Pod.",0.9931,0.726,0.208,0.067,0.4292809042809043

Don't even get me started on McDonald's.  On the rare occasion I am in Wisconsin, Culver's was really the only place that was acceptable to me, but there is no way I could even stomach that more than once a year.  I just was never a ""fast food"" person. Now there is this freak of freakin nature, Five Guys, that I tried for the first time the other night.

The jalepenos were fresh which was a very nice feature.  The mushrooms were forgettable, so don't bother with them.  But everything else was really fresh and worked great on this burger (which as it turns out is actually a double decker...you have to order the ""junior"" to get a single patty).  It was friggin DELICIOUS.  Holy crap! Fries are RIDICULOUS.  First up, they are really good, fresh cut, with the skin on.  They are a little greasy, but come on!  That;s why they are called FRIES, not BAKES or NUKES.  The insane thing though is they show you the size of a large cup which you think ""oh yeah, thats plenty to share between two people"".  What they don't tell you is they put that much, if not more, EXTRA at the bottom of the bag!  Does anyone really need that much fried potato?  Who knows, but damn, that was a hilarious find nonetheless.   Yeah, this is a dangerous place, people, and if you know what is good for you you will keep far, far away from the 3 city locations and the 2 suburban ones.  Because this has the potential to be a problem...aw man, I now eat fast food.  And I like it!",0.9876,0.728,0.173,0.098,0.6014117826617826

So, when I got the attention of one of men on the line and told him my order number and that it was for pick up, he said ""Oh!

Basically, I turned my hotdog into what tasted like a bacon cheeseburger with all the trimmings...and it was completely worth it.

So when I was recommended Five Guys I was very eager to try out this new hip spot. I knew all about the prices so when I walked in I just wanted to find out how good these burgers really were. Well, I have to say that they were just ok. Not really worth $5 dollars. While I do like the fresh & plentiful toppings, the overall taste was really not as good as I thought it would be. They are fast but not really friendly, I guess I wouldn't be either if I had to deal with the traffic that they have during the lunch rush. It is very clean and it is nice that you can dine in if you wanted.

2009-08-18,4.0,"I believe I have found my favorite fast-food burger in Chicago, and the Number 3 spot on my list of best fast-food burgers in America. 1. Fatburger 2. In 'N"" Out Burger 3. Five Guys This place has character. You walk in, they shout out the number of people who just walked in with you. Look around -- sacks full of potatoes are neatly stacked in the dining area. A chalkboard proudly proclaims the origin of today's potato shipment. Glowing reviews, mostly from the DC area and points east, are prominently posted on the walls. The menu is pretty straightforward -- burgers, hot dogs, fries. You order a regular burger -- it's automatically a double patty. At this place you can truly get it your way with a respectable array of toppings. There's a wait, because your patties are cooked fresh at the moment of ordering. (NOTE: There's a little sign proclaiming that all meat is cooked well-done, so forget about requesting it medium-rare.)  Hungry right now, and need a little arginine fix? Free peanuts in the shell while you wait. But I encourage you instead to indulge in that ""best pickle"" called hunger, because if you ordered fries with that burger, get ready to freak. The mounds of fresh, peanut oil-cooked french fries will overwhelm you. A regular-sized fries can easily feed 3 people or 1 1/2 teenagers. And they are good, make no mistake. But on to the burger itself... Unimpeachably fresh -- the meat and the toppings. It's a big 'un, and a wee bit messy. Though the meat was without the slightest trace of pink, it was still juicy enough. My only druthers is that they should season it with a little salt & pepper. That would kick this burger over the edge into my #1 spot in America. Otherwise, this is two-fisted fast-food eating at its near-finest. You will pay for the high quality, but you will be generously rewarded. That said, the prices are not outrageous. This ain't no dollar-menu joint, mind you. I did notice that they serve a Kosher-style hot dog split lengthwise on a French roll. Must be a Mid-Atlantic thing. Betcha it's good, for those who need a change of pace from the ubiquitous Chicago style. Nice, long hours, especially on weekends. Not a long wait to order, a moderate wait for one's food, and maximum satisfaction upon receiving it. The people behind the counter all smile frequently, looking like they actually enjoy working there. Crowd-pleasing music, bright and clean-looking. Have I convinced you yet?

If you like quality greasy thin style burgers at relative fast food connivence, you must check it out. As a point of reference, I'll note that 5 Dudes uses much higher quality produce than Steak & Shake.  They don't fuck around with gimmick burger condiments either. Expect tasty grilled onions and mushrooms if you order. Like any burger or pizza though, I caution too many condiments/toppings on the dish. The fries are by far the best item on the 5 Guys meal. The fries are always fresh. Fresh like they have been recently delivered, and, perhaps most importantly, they just came out of the frier when served. They are also larger than your average fry and unpeeled (still have the foreskin on), two of my favorite qualities in a good fry.  Unfortunately, because of the good feeling one gets after a great burger and fries meal, the place often attracts a fair number of ugly people. Needless to say, there can be uncomfortable moments when standing around waiting for a burger. So, have fun avoiding contact with these trolls for the 10-15 minute it takes for your order. They play sweet music too if you fall into their 35-50 year old loser male target audience.

It's nothing fabulous, but it's not horrific.  The fries are pretty good though I'm not sure the peanut oil brings out the best flavor (and totally not greasy or soggy at all -- guess we had a different fry cook).  The meat doesn't have a whole heck of a lot of flavor but it wasn't roadkill either.  I had the little one with BBQ sauce, bacon and grilled onions and it was rather decent.  The hubs had the regular double cheeseburger with a bunch o' fixins and said it was fine.  It is very hard to stop eating the bountiful peanuts in the shell they've got everywhere.  Even though we were rolling-out-the-door stuffed, it's nothing we'd rush back over for as a destination. Do bring your winter coat, hat and scarf with you as it was freakin' freeeeeezzzing in there.  Like meat locker freezing.  Even the hubs, who is a portable space heater, was cold.  And do bring your winning lottery ticket with you -- for the two of us it was $17 which seems steep for two burgers, fries and one beverage.  We could have had burgers at home all week for that price.",0.9699,0.848,0.106,0.046,0.5624592999593
2009-07-24,1.0,"So I guess you can't give 0 stars.  People who are giving this place 4 or 5 stars need their head examined.  Stop drinking the Kool-Aid people - this food is way overrated and overpriced.  I ordered a burger with grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, jalapeno, and BBQ sauce.  After waiting for 15 minutes (good thing they have peanuts, since they seem to not understand they are quick serve establishment), I finally got my greasy lump of dough, sans the BBQ sauce (had to go back to the counter to get it).  So, for slightly over $7, I got a 1/4 lb burger with absolutely no flavor, with american cheese, OK produce, and a bun that was about the same quality of the store brand buns you buy at Jewel.  And, I got a mountain of fresh cut fries.  I appreciate the fact they just throw the fries in the bag, so I can dig thru the hot greasy things to extract my burger.  Very classy.  The fries were OK - nothing to rave about.  Hope no one you know is allergic to peanuts, because you will contaminate their digs in less than 5 seconds.  But I digress. So, basically what I got for $7 was a marginal quality burger and fries (I drank water), with a wait time longer than if I had just gone to a casual dining establishment or bar.  Some suggestions for Five Guys: 1.  Get better buns - the one I had was like eating a dough ball, wasn't even sure it was fully baked.  You also may not want to place them so close to the grill, as they will absorb the moisture 2.  Jalapenos - raw jalapenos do not add any flavor to the burger, use marinated jalapenos instead 3.  Meat - season it with something, ANYTHING!! 4.  Service - your operational model is a complete frickin mess.  Since I had a good 15 minutes of time to wait for my burger, I sat and watched your prep area.  There are 3 to 4 guys bumping into to each other in the 10-12 ft of prep space, and they must have looked at each order tag 5 to 6 times to make sure they put the right topping on the burger (guess thats a disadvantage of the custom order model).  I had no idea how the prep area was arranged, or if it was arranged.  Reco - go visit a Subway, and use a modified assembly line process. I will say this, they have done a good job picking real estate.  Put your building in areas where there are lots of trend following sheep (like the city, and Naperville), and reinforce that you are better than everyone else.  Its like Walmart and their Everyday Low Prices messaging - if you repeat it enough, people start to believe it.  You will not hear any bleating from this poster.",0.9435,0.859,0.085,0.056,0.49354937177517827

Five Guys' burger itself was a rather thin patty, cooked well (as the sign indicates they cook all their meat). This is where it lost points. I like a fat burger cooked medium. Toppings are great, but all the toppings in the world can't make up for a substandard patty.  Fries were terrific. Strange potato sacks around the floor where fries come from, not so much. Simple menu with unlimited free toppings was beautiful. Letting everyone choose each of their toppings for every order, not so much.

2009-06-13,3.0,"A really simple menu is not always a bad thing, especially for an over-thinker like myself.  For that reason, I like the concept of Five Guys.  Burgers, hot dogs, fries, fountain drinks (oh- and complimentary peanuts).  That is it. In honor of Five Guys simple and short menu, I will try to keep my usually long-winded bellowing down to a short, but sweet review. I really liked the burger.  It is, what I consider to be, the best ""fast food"" style, counter service, grab it and go burger I have had, maybe ever. For just that reason alone, I would go back many times.  Then I started thinking (and thinking usually either gets me in trouble, creates a sense of maddening over-analysis, or is a complete waste of my time)...   As much as I like the burger, and the fries are decent, I still spent just slightly over $20 for two burgers, one order of large fries, and two fountain drinks/sodas/pops. The price killer, in my opinion, is the fries.  It isn't like the large order is not large- because it is quite big, and it will feed more than one ""normal"" person (no offense to anyone that can knock off an order solo...  I probably could too by the way); but $5.00 for fries?  Just a bit too steep. The burger itself is fairly reasonable considering you get two meat patties and as many burger toppings as you want (after you order your base: either 1) hamburger, 2) cheeseburger, 3) hamburger with bacon, and 4) cheeseburger with bacon).  I think the most expensive of those four options is the cheeseburger with bacon and I believe it was around $6.50 or so. Not a bad price for the burger itself since I loaded up quite a few toppings (my veg or salad for the meal, if you will), and the burger alone would probably fill me up by itself. If I lived anywhere near a Five Guys, it would probably become a staple in my diet.  Thankfully from a wanting to keep cholesterol levels down point of view, they are nowhere near me, so I probably won't come here too often (thanks to my never ending hatred of driving down Clybourn).  For me, I still have Epic Burger a bit closer to my 'hood.

Now... i've read the other reviews on how pricey this place was... and I'd have to agree that it isn't cheap. The burger was ok. A little sloppy (maybe because we got everything on it) but it consisted of the normal stuff that goes on a burger PLUS grilled onions and grill mushrooms. I would give this burger a B grade. It's not great... but it's not that bad either.  The bacon cheese dog was a different story. If you like regular hot dogs... do not get this. It's literally a hotdog, in a bun, with a slice american cheese (not very well melted), and a couple slices of bacon. It's like a breakfast sandwich but made of a hot dog. Did I like it? No. I will not be getting this ever again.... especially for $5. I was actually expecting the gooey melted cheese with chopped up bacon sprinkled on top of it.  I feel like I'm rambling.  Sorry.

First things first: The burgers.  These Guys obviously learned a thing or two in Burger Grilling School (or frying as it were).   Rule # 1, DO NOT over handle the ground beef whilst forming the patty; the less handling, the better (and juicier) the burger will be.  An uneven and imperfectly formed patty is the sign of a legitimate burger.   Rule # 2, fresh, never frozen, high quality ground beef with just the right amount of seasoning to allow for the burger taste to shine (the fry guy could learn a thing or two from the burger boys about prep)   Rule # 3 endless (FREE) toppings that are equally fresh (and generous in portions) Well, check all three, because Five Guys hits a home run on the above three rules.  Darn tasty and I [x] will be back. Fries: OVER SEASONED!  My BP went up 40 points in the time I was there.

2009-03-01,2.0,"If I could give a half star, this would rate 2  and 1/2 stars in my book.  Five Guys is all about a back to the basics approach.  Fresh ground beef, made to order, choice of toppings and more fries in a regular order than any one human being needs to eat. What's good about the Five Guys.  Well, I liked my Bacon Cheeseburger.  Liked it a fair amount.  I'd give the burger four stars.  They use two patties, and fairly thin ones.  They do nothing special to the burger itself. It reminded me a bit of Rotier's in Nashville, but not up to that high level. But that's about it.  To call this fast food would be a stretch.  The fresh cooking means a fair amount of waiting.  Eventually, the burger is made and then the fries are put in a cup (shades of Stuckey's) and then the rest of the bag. Moreover, $11.13 for a bacon cheeseburger, fries and a small soda is a bit much.  The main bite is the fries.  A regular order is $2.59.  For that price, they give you enough fries for three or four people, which is a waste when you are dining solo. The fries are also basic.  And I thought they were a bit undercooked.  They met the bare minimum for a good fry.  I'd give the fries 2 stars.   So a good burger, blah fries, wasted food, too long of a wait and too pricey for what I got.  Maybe 2 stars is the right rating.

Other than the never frozen patty, they have fries fried in peanut oil If you've never experienced that and love fries, it's worth checking out. Crisper, tastier and a cleaner taste then the fries found at the char place on the corner, you can actually taste the peanut oil. One more thing, they offer free peanuts while you wait and any toppings on your burger free. Yep, hot sauce, jalapenos , BBQ sauce, whatever..  The food is expensive, I caught something on the TV one weekend about this chain, so I went in thinking I'd check out the double cheeseburger with bacon, regular fries and a large drink. $13 dollars +/-. $13 dollars !! Crap. Big ass, improperly prepared falling apart burger wrapped in just enough aluminum foil - more food than I cared to eat (if there's a next time I'm going for smaller), small fries in a solo Styrofoam cup and a large drink, which was dumb to order since it's free refills on fountain soda. I think as a standard everything is packed to go, so that there is less cleanup on their part.  The dine in experience is plain, think white tiled walls like a hospital bathroom, with checkered red tiles, I start to think of a butcher or deli, throw around a few cedar tables, stacks of heavy bags of potatoes and drums of peanut oil in sight. Nothing special, stopped in on one of those below zero nights, it was cold inside (brrr), we kept our jackets on while we ate.

But like another review stated, if they had a drive-thru I think their business could compete with the other chains, one thing Chicago lacks are more drive-thru options.",0.9881,0.808,0.145,0.047,0.450511881281112
2009-01-17,4.0,"For a fast and casual burger place, Five Guys is the place to go.  Their burgers are simple but great - you can choose whatever toppings you want - and their fries are delicious too (both plain and Cajun).  They have other things on the menu (like hot dogs & grilled cheese) in case you're in the mood for something different.",0.9267,0.796,0.204,0.0,0.6395502645502646
2009-01-16,1.0,"I was craving a great burger, so i stopped in here to try it out and thought the burger was verrrry bland no taste (hate biting into a burger and seeing that is't grey inside) and dry which leaves the buns are to doughy and not distinctive to make me want to go back, i know the main difference is always fresh never frozen but thats true with a bunch of other burger joints the fries were great though (over priced), rather make the hike to steak'n shake for a great burger next time but burger king or wendy's will do sad to say but not there at 5 guys which reminds me alot of great steak!!",0.9652,0.723,0.206,0.07,0.5527777777777778
2009-01-13,4.0,"I think I like Epic Burger better. That said, this is a SOLID choice for an LP burger, and since Epic is a haul, I think we'll be eating more Five Guys than Epic.  This stuff is far better than most fast food; it's just too bad there's no Five Guys drive-thru.  I'm not a fries person, but I suppose if I were, I'd say that Five Guys are better than Epic, but you can't really count on my opinion, since I don't really eat fries. I would suggest getting the little cheeseburger if you don't want a double.  Rookie mistake, I guess.  I think I'll like the burgers more as singles, to be honest.  I'm sure I'll find out in the coming months.",0.9265,0.767,0.169,0.064,0.48277777777777786
2009-01-13,3.0,"I love meat. I tried to stop eating it, but hamburgers, all beef hot dogs, and bacon just kept creeping into my mind. So I find myself on the prowl for meat more often than not, and I read about this place online. I thought it might be a quick fix to the typical thinner-than-a-pancake-and-just-as-tasteless burger that is fast food. It fell short. I loved the service, locale and atmosphere, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. It could have been that all the fixings kept ending up on the table rather than in my mouth due to the sheer volume of them (I only got the typical lettuce, tomato, onion, ketchup, mayo, mustard combo), or it could have been that the burgers were WAY well done and crumbly, but I just didn't love them. The hubby was loving the fries (we opted for unseasoned) but I wasn't a fan. I guess I'm more of a crispy fries fan, but maybe the cajun seasoning would make a difference on my opinion. Part of my disappointment may be the fact that nothing could ever compare to In 'N Out for a fast food burger. I may try to go again and give the hot dog a go.",0.9302,0.848,0.101,0.051,0.6208333333333332
2009-01-10,5.0,"WOW! The burgers here are huge, and have really fresh ingredients. The menu isn't big, but it's kind of custom. You can add pretty much anything to your burger, including things like A1 and grilled mushrooms. Very tasty. I was choosing my ingredients and the cashier informed me that according to my choices, I could order my burger next time by saying ""All The Way"" instead of listing them out. Very helpful and friendly people. The fries are the star of the show here, which are freshly cut for everyone. There was a sign by the register letting everyone know that today's potatoes were from Sugar City, Idaho. They come plain or with Cajun seasoning, and there's malt vinegar on the tables. Excellent. The Kosher hot dog is also wonderful- you can add the same toppings to these as the burgers! Even with only grilled onions, it's top-notch. There seemed to be a buzz in the place, employees and patrons alike. I can't wait to come back!",0.986,0.808,0.178,0.014,0.5766071428571429
2009-01-10,4.0,"more like 15 guys, but who's counting.  you can tell a lot about a place by how it's running the first week it opens. these guys really seem to know what they're doing - simple, to the point, delicious food. my sister and i each got the little hamburger, which means the burger comes with one patty instead of two (the regular hamburger/cheeseburger has 2 patties...the little should be enough for most appetites though). we also got regular fries and the cajun fries, both of which were excellent. my burger was fantastic. really really good. you can add whatever you want (from a choice of basics) which i love - a perfect burger made with exactly what i want on it.  the employees were helpful, friendly, and funny. i could tell they really care about keeping their customers happy. best of all, they also serve grilled cheese and hot dogs. sort of wish they had cheese fries, but i'll get over it. i could not be more excited that this place is here. great for a quick lunch or dinner, to take out or dine in.",0.9973,0.676,0.312,0.013,0.5646045312711979
2009-01-07,4.0,"I believe this is the first store in Chicago proper.  I have seen t he reviews for the Oak Park store .... here is what I think based on this new Lincoln Park location.  Burger's were excellent. Fries were very good. Everything you want to be fresh is very fresh. Not a big fan of the accolades from elsewhere in the country. Who cares. How do they compare?  I think they are the best mid-priced burger I have found in the city. If money is no object, and you like to go wild, go to Kuma's for the best burger in the city ... period!  Much better, in my opinion, than ""In & Out"" or ""Steak and Shake"" ... a couple of other chain's that have or have had cult followings.  Outside of the city, my favorite is still ""Paradise Pup"" in Des Plaines. What's not to love about burgers and fries buried in Merkt's cheese.  (Just don't tell my doctor ;-) )  All in all .... Five Guys exceeded my expectations. Hope they keep it up after they have been open for a while.",0.9882,0.752,0.213,0.035,0.4968265993265992
