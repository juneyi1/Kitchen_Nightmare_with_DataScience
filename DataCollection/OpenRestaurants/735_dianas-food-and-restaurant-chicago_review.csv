2017-08-27,5.0,"This is one of the best Puerto Rican restaurants that I've come across lately in Chicago. So good that I am now switching from past favorite PR spot to this one. The steak on the jibarito was extremely tender, juicy and flavorful. The plantains were perfectly fried and the white rice & beans were delicious! The portion sizes are very satisfying. You will walk out stuffed. Also newly remodeled with plenty of seating. Very pleased",0.9778,0.725,0.275,0.0,0.6837121212121211

2017-07-25,5.0,"After a quick plane ride to Chicago, it was time to have some good high quality PR food.  I was not sure what to expect, you know not having any Puerto Rican in me at all.  The menu was on the left hand side of the wall and the top had all your American favorites....Cuban Sandwiches and the like but it was the bottom of the menu that I can for.  Started out the Alcapurrias, a mashed green plantations with ground beef in the middle.  Rellenos de papa and Cod fritters which we tasty but I think sitting under the warming lamp did not do them any justice.  Now for dinner there was Roast pork with medium grain rice and pinto beans with pumpkin and potato...yum yum.. The pork was slow roasted perfected and the skin had the absolute perfect texture of crunch and fat.  The Mofongo was tasty but just to oily for my liking and believe me, I am not a Mofongo aficionado but I have to give the restaurant 4 stars for at least making it fresh for us.   I will absolutely visit this place again, but Chicago is just to big to stay in one neighborhood",0.9814,0.849,0.144,0.007,0.47055555555555556

Otherwise, a fantastic meal, and those empanadas were amazing!",0.9336,0.795,0.185,0.02,0.6863636363636364
2016-09-02,5.0,"Authentic Puerto Rican Food and the BEST Breakfast sandwiches in Humboldt Park. The prices are affordable. Recipes are simple and portions are GENEROUS. I split a large egg ham and bacon with a friend and it was like eating 2 sandwiches. Im going to hope they don't realize their food is worth much more lol. I always tip generously because they are a genuine mom and pops, Puerto Rican own and operated restaurant and treat everyone so warmly.  Here are a few highlights that I appreciate about this hidden gem: 1. Housemade PIQUE (hot sauces) - The red pique and traditions vinegar based piques are all made in house and they sell large bottles for $7. My fav pique in Humboldt Park to date. They also have a cilantro based milder green pique that I prefer for my paStelillos!  Ask for some to go or buy a bottle for gifts! They will always be a hit! 2. Empanadas de JUEYES on the weekends (Fri-Sunday) - CRAB empanadas made in house, with Jueyes guisado (creole stewed crab). DELICIOUS! I always order a minimum of 5 to share because they're too good to enjoy by myself. My family LOVES them. The only ones in Humboldt park I have found. I would prefer if they made the dough for the expands themselves to be truly authentic, BUT the key here is the seasoning and flavor these bad boys pack so they're forgiven! lol 3. Drink Selection: They have tradition PR drinks like Malta (goys and india), cola champagne, coco rico, various goy juices (parcha/passion fruit is my fave) I don't like the coffee station too much because they only have powdered creamer, but if they switched it to milk they might get more business.  4. Mixtas!!! They have tradition PR should foods like Mondongo, steak jibaritos, cuajitos, arroz con gandules, arrow blanco con habichuelas guisadas, sopa de salchichon o de pollo and more. They're price point is great for working people on a budget like me and its abuelitas cooking in the kitchen so flavor is good. All in all I have yet to be disappointed but I do prefer their frituras (fried appetizers) and sandwiches to their mixes because they're some of the freshest in Humboldt Park!  5. Dine in! They have booths and tables to set and enjoy in the AC and always have available seats. Jus don't expect wi-fi at this gem. You have to actually interact with people over a meal like a civilize human being OLD SCHOOL Boricua style!  All in all I love this place and even though they're off the Paseo Boricua they deserve your coins.",0.9954,0.805,0.167,0.028,0.5306390977443609

Small grocery store with a great Puerto Rican restaurant in the back. Added bonus - grab a 2 liter or Malta from the fridge and pay for it all at the end!!

2011-08-21,4.0,"4.5 stars Nice hidden gem just a block or two south of the Norwegian American Hospital.  The inside isn't anything fancy, a convenient store atmosphere with an open walk up kitchen in the back with seating in the middle.   Prices were really good as a pork with rice and beans dish was $8 and came with fresh bread and green chile sauce.  Portions were of generous size.  My only complaint was that I wish the rice and beans hardly had any flavor.  I know traditionally rice usually doesn't have a flavor to begin with but this tasted like plain white rice.  I also got a Malta Goya to drink, which reminded me of an amber or Oktoberfest beer minus the alcohol content as it tasted very malty.  I like how they put various plates of dessert (flan, raspberry cheese cake, cinnamon, and coconut rice pudding) in the fridge doors since you can take one whenever you want without asking.  I highly recommend the flan, delicious! Service was very good as they let me read the paper while eating without paying for it.  Seemed like they get plenty of regular customers that know each other quite well.",0.9777,0.81,0.159,0.031,0.4001626373626373

2009-05-30,4.0,"I'm inclined to agree w. George T, this is prob some of the most authentic Puertorican food out there...I wouldn't know that personally but in my estimation, a place like this couldn't exist if they didn't serve anything other than the real deal (especially for the majority of the HP locals, read: PR). It's about a 5 iron from mi casa i've been a few times over the years.  It's part (small) grocery store, part (smaller) restaurant and it's a family owned and run show.   Very charming folk who are always helpful in explaining ""what the hell is that"" to me and even offering a sample or two.   I've done a few brekkie items, some empanadas, a sort of potato ball w ground pork (fantastic) and a masa thingamajiggy and, of course, the Jibarito.  All quite tasty, if not totally unhealthy.  But hey, live it, love it.",0.9567,0.81,0.15,0.04,0.535
