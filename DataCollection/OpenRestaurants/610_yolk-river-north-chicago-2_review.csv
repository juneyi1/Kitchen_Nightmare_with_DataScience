I'm from New York where there's a boozy brunch literally everywhere you turn. In Chicago it's a little difficult to find a good one. Yolk doesn't have a corkage fee so we ordered a glass of orange juice and brought our own champagne. I kind of wish there was a Yolk in New York. I ordered their omelettes and trust me they're huuuuge. I usually don't eat a lot for breakfast but my boyfriend who eats a huge breakfast was very full from it. The omelettes also came with some fruit and pancakes. A lot of stuff. I also ordered their French toast which were delicious. Not both in the same day that would be crazy.

A lovely fruit variety that included pineapple and oranges was served--not the pre-cut fruit casserole mixture with grapes and takeover ""melon filler"" (quoted by one of my coworkers). The bacon was thick and oh-so-flavorful I wanted to eat the entire batch, but I resisted out of love for my team. The scrambled eggs were thick and filling, and the potato cubes were deliciously crispy. But...the crepes served with fresh blueberries and blackberries were the star of the show for me.

Super surprising because honestly most brunch places don't do potatoes very well... but Yolk seasons theirs perfectly! I'd definitely recommend trying them as a side.

""Outside or something, I think we have some seating there""), just to later be sat in the same exact spot, where, later a party of 3 white people sit directly next to your party to take selfies and wait to be seated. Same waitress approaches them and ask them can she get them anything to start, when they say they are just waiting to be sat, she tells them that they don't have to worry about that, and that she can serve them here and now.

I love poached eggs and I love corned beef hash, so I knew I had made the right choice. Or at least I thought I did. It wasn't as good as I expected. The hash was very greasy, expectedly so..but that together with the hollandaise was just a little too much - especially for a first meal of the day. If you're going to order this, I would suggest asking for the sauce on the side. The good thing is that they give you huge portions, so a meal here is definitely worth it.

Always a plus! For breakfast, we both ordered skillets. I ordered a country skillet with scrambled eggs and a side of waffles. My friend created her own skillet and topped it with sunny side up eggs. Both types of eggs were cooked to perfection. The scrambled eggs were extremely fluffy.

2015-08-05,2.0,"I am confused how this place got so many amazing reviews. I have driven past yolk numerous times and always had wanted to try it out. After one of my friends moved to Chicago a few weeks ago she said she stopped in and it was one of the best breakfast places she had been too. That was it, I had to go!  I love the branding of the company, but that didn't make my food taste any better. We went around 1pm on a Monday so that could have been the issue? But it shouldn't be the problem. I was very excited to order, the entire menu SOUNDED amazing. It states on the menu that it was voted best breakfast place in Chicago. The potatoes were not cooked all the way, extremely mushy. They don't offer hash browns, which I would choose any day over what I was served. I ordered the eggs Benedict caprese I believe it was called. The pesto sauce was brown with a slight dark green tint. I understand that pesto sauce can turn brown from being oxidized, however it made it difficult to think of how long not only my potatoes had been sitting out but how long the pesto had. My whole plate wasn't ""hot"" at all. The English muffin was so soggy. I honestly think that they had my entire plate pre-made and it was just sitting waiting for someone to grab it. Our waiter wasn't overly friendly at all, I think I heard him say 3 things. After he spilled water on the table I felt bad, because he was so shy... he didn't say anything, just walked away. We just cleaned it up with our napkin, not a big deal. He didn't thank us for coming in or to have a nice day, he just dropped the check off and walked away.

We walked in around 10 am on a Friday morning and although most tables were full we were seated immediately. It turned out that right before we placed our order there was a catering order for  80 people, so our food took a bit longer than expected to come out. Otherwise our service was great and our waitress was friendly and attentive. I decided to order the Irish Benny (fried tomato and corned beef hash with a poached egg & sauce), while my wife ordered 2 eggs scrambled with a side of fruit. It was a good thing I was hungry, because my plate was jam packed with my Eggs Benedict, sliced red potatoes, and a full stack of fresh fruit. The fruit tasted extremely fresh and was a yummy mix of grapes, pineapple, and honeydew. The Eggs Benedict itself was delicious, and the corned beef hash on top dealt the salty and savory flavor I was craving. The diced red potatoes on the side were also great and I would have eaten more if I wasn't so full.

This was a couple of months back so I don't remember everything we ordered (we also visited the South Loop location on a different day) but what I do remember is having the Yolk All-Star Breakfast with the Very Berry Fronch Toast, Santa Fe Frittata, Iron Man Omelet, and Banana Blueberry Crunch Cakes. The latter three items we had at the South Loop location, but I'm just going to clump both into this review, as I would say they both are a solid 4 stars anyway. The good: - The bacon, sausages, and eggs were cooked just the way I liked them.  - The frittata was good but I have nothing to really compare it to because it was my first taste of a frittata.. which, btw, is just a glorified omelet. - The fronch toast tasted slightly healthier than one would expect from a fronch toast, thanks to the greek yogurt, almond granola, and honey.. personally, I like my fronch toast to make me feel like a fat piece of shit, drenched in syrup and hidden under a mountain of whipped cream. But, still good. - The pancakes were tasty, but again, a little too healthy for something that is essentially just dessert for breakfast. The bad: - The Iron Man Omelet (South Loop location). I found the omelet to be flavorless and too watery. Instead of being plated in a bowl, the fruit arrived side-by-side with the omelet, and the omelet juices/salsa got all over the fruit and made it all warm and unpleasant to eat. This is where my memory gets hazy because I know my boyfriend ordered a juice of some kind for us.. strawberry lemonade or something. I remember it being good, but apparently not good enough for me to remember what the hell it was after two months. I would definitely come back the next time I'm in Chicago, but I'm for sure skipping the healthy crap and going straight for the cinnamon roll fronch toast.",0.9883,0.773,0.164,0.063,0.44526143790849676

I'd give it 5 stars if the prices were a BIT less steep and if there was a little more flexibility on portion choices. The meals are very large for me (although they're perfect for my husband). Rather than waste so much food or pay full price for a half-portion, it would be nice to have some options for small plates or half-portions at even slightly less pricing. Paying $12+ for a breakfast that's double what I can possibly eat is the only reason we don't visit Yolk every week, rather than just occasionally.

I have lived in Chicago for 8 years and people have always talked about Yolk, but I always wound up going to other places for brunch (which I now realize is for the better.) Don't get me wrong, it's decent enough. When I walked in I thought it was counter service and almost made a 180 and left. When my friend arrived 10 min later I said, ""this isn't what I was expecting. I almost walked out."" And he said, ""Why? Because is feels like a cafeteria in here?"" Enough said.  It's just that the prices are a little high for the atmosphere and quality. I almost ordered the oatmeal but it would have come plain for $5, and each topping even cruising was a $1.75 notch, not what I was looking for. Then I almost ordered the 3 pancakes for $6.99 but in order to get fruit with it another couple bucks would have been added on. So, I went with the breakfast sandwich for $8.99. It was on a lame fluffy excuse for a (plain) bagel. It was alright, but not special. The potatoes were  lacking which was disappointing since I asked the server if they were good, seasoned, popular? She claimed they are seasoned but that's a lie if I ever heard one. I should have gotten the fruit.  It is convenient to the Chicago Brownline. Again, it's alright. Just not newsworthy.

It took maybe five minutes for my food to be delivered, and my server had my drink refilled and my check ready to go just as I was finishing.  As for the food, my Tour de France was as perfect as ever. The tour consists of banana bread with sliced bananas and peanut butter, lemon poppyseed bread with blueberries and orange sauce, and orange bread with sliced strawberries. Each slice was incredibly moist and flavorful, and perfectly portioned from mini loaves. The strawberries were a little bland, but since it's late December in the Midwest I had no expectations of them being at their peak.

My omelette was suppose to have onions, avocado, jalapeños and chorizo so  I thought for sure I'd be a winner. It was pretty bland. The toast wasn't toasted, it was soggy and cold. My coffee was cold and asked for a new coffee which took 10 minutes. Everything was cold.

2014-12-19,4.0,"I always have a good experience every time I go, so I gotta give it some props.  Food: Their selection is just like any other good breakfast joint. They've got combos,  omelettes, scramblers, french toast, pancakes and more. They even have Chicken & Waffles (though I haven't tried theirs). Plus a lunch menu. Their Eggs Benedict is good. Atmosphere: The modern decor with urban blue tile and yellow highlights all throughout are great touches. It's a pretty decent sized River North breakfast place with booths and regular tables. Service: Pretty nice and friendly. Our server did a great job with our table, though we had to flag her down once or twice, and she gave us four full steaming hot to-go cups of coffee. Fantastic for me! Not-so-mind-blowing-but-potentially-helpful-tips: Parking is metered. Weekeneds are busy. During the holiday season, if you donate a warm clothing item you get 10% off your check.

I decided to go simple, with a California omelet, fresh fruit and a side of pancakes. The fruit--grapes, pineapples and melons--was very fresh, which is nice when some breakfast places could throw on canned fruit with better results. The omelette itself had similarly fresh ingredients. The sour cream on top was nice, and the avocado made it creamy. It would've been nice for the vegetables to have been in bigger chunks, but I still liked it. The pancakes are excellent. Lots of buttermilk tang and a reasonably light texture. The real maple syrup goes perfectly with it, too. Yolk is a good option for brunch. I'm looking forward to trying the hash browns.",0.985,0.763,0.237,0.0,0.6424812030075188

The service is awesome, it's always super clean, and you can get in and out in under an hour if you're pressed for time.  A couple of my favorite Yolk menu items: Corned Beef Hash - Comes with 2 eggs (any style). It's obviously super salty but I love it and Yolk does it right. Smoked Salmon Scrambler - Filled with all the deliciously stinky things dreams are made of. Smoked salmon, cream cheese, red onion, tomato, fennel, and capers with scrambled eggs. Just don't eat this if you're planning a makeout session in the near future.  Another really awesome thing about Yolk is that for your fruit side you can request ""all berries"". Instead of getting grapes, orange slices, and melons you get strawberries, blackberries, and blueberries.  I've brought lots of people to eat at Yolk and there's definitely something for everyone.

This review is more about their service.  I took two friends this morning who have never been to yolk before. We received horrible service. The waitress was decent. She did not refill or even offer to refill our drinks once the whole time we were there. But what really bothered us is when we went to pay. Since you pay up at the counter we just went up there and told them what we each ordered. The cashier could not have been more rude. She acted as if we were criminals when we tried to split the bill. Then one of us tried to put the whole bill on his card but it was declined which almost caused her to have an aneurism. We tried to ask why we couldn't each pay for what we each got and she actually glared at us.

I went Sunday morning for brunch and we had a short wait of just about 10 minutes. I was super happy we ended up getting a nice little booth table but if you are a party of 1 or 2, you'll definitely be seated more quickly if you're okay sitting at the counter. I had the Harvest Breakfast Quinoa Bowl for $7.79 which was warm quinoa with cranberries, apples, peaches & pecans. It came with a little plate that had an orange, cinnamon, and milk. We thought it was a bit strange there was a milk option because I've never heard of pouring milk on quinoa, but maybe that's a thing. This dish was just about exactly how you'd expect a bowl of quinoa, fruit & nuts to taste! Not the most amazing dish I've ever had but it was exactly as expected and helped me feel a little more healthy than alternative options I could have ordered. I was also able to try my dining companion's Irish Benny ($11.49). Their Irish Benny comes on an english muffin smothered with corned beef hash, topped with two poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. The strangest part of this dish for me was the giant tomato everything sat on top of on the english muffin. Aside from the tomato, I enjoyed the dish. It was a giant mess of gooey hash soaked in the hollandaise but that's what it should be! Our server was very friendly but seemed extremely busy! She would check in on us here & there while placing various random items on our table and forgot our carry out box at the end of our meal. Overall though, no big issues on service.

2014-09-21,3.0,"""What are you ordering?"" he asks. ""Probably the corn beef hash with the potatoes"" I reply.  There it is. I knew I would see it as soon as I said it. --The slight eyebrow raise.  Mr. ""I drink protein shakes every day for breakfast"" is nearly appalled by my choice. ;) I won't be shamed; I want salty food. And hash is a throwback to my Midwestern childhood. I stood my ground. The Corned Beef was exactly what I needed it to be. Maybe slightly more than I needed it to be. --It was indeed SALTY.  Although,the eggs on top helped balance the salt out, along with the (more than adequate but still forgettable) potatoes on the side. I was content with my choice. I needed salty comfort food and that's exactly what I got. After all the looks I got for ordering Corned Beef Hash, he decides he's going to cut loose and order Cinnamon Roll French Toast. (biting my tongue) Really?!!  I wasn't in the mood for overly sweet food, but I still tried his. It was good. Three small'ish sliced rolls, the top one with a thick slathering of icing on top. They were okay. Good flavors and as sweet as you'd expect from something called Cinnamon Roll French Toast.  Fairly small portion to be honest though. It's exactly what is says it is. One roll, sliced up. --He was still hungry after he finished. He regretted that he did not ask for potatoes on the side to offset the sweetness. I regretted it too, as he ate half of my potatoes off of my plate. ;) Pancakes.... ugh. I feel like such a broken record about this. They weren't good. Dry, flavorless, very flat, no air and..... not worth a single calorie. Where did they go wrong? They didn't use buttermilk and they over mixed their batter.  A small science lesson....Buttermilk has magical powers. For one, it contains more acid than regular milk and it creates carbon dioxide when mixed with baking soda. When you add it to baked goods (or in this case pancakes), you get fluffier, lighter, tangier product. Why? Because the acid cuts through the long strands of gluten and the carbon dioxide provides extra lift. A stack of buttermilk pancakes will always stand taller than a stack of regular. They will be lighter, fluffier, spongier and the slight tang will go perfectly with the mild saltiness of butter and the sweetness of syrup. This is exactly what a pancake should taste like. It shouldn't taste like.... flat nothings and flat nothings are what you get here.  Don't order pancakes if you expect them to taste like mine. If Bisquick is your go-to pancake, by all means order up. If you want great pancakes to beat all other pancakes, you'd better head to my house. They're from scratch. You can come in your PJs; I won't judge. ;) I also won't charge you, nor will you have to wait outside for me to call your name. Plus, many will agree, I'm pretty cute in the morning with my apron on. :) If there is one thing you cannot come here without ordering it's the Strawberry Orange Juice. I could down that all. day. long. For real. Very fresh. Strawberry seeds floating in your glass. This is not the fake juice from the cartons at Jewel-Osco. Service was good. Friendly, pleasant, welcoming. The line looks long but they move people out pretty quickly. Lots of large, sun filled windows.

The must get: the Tour de France. 3 different types of yummy french toast: banana nut bread, lemon poppy seed bread & sweet orange bread. Lightly fried on the outside, yet each bread type is still moist in the center. & to be topped w/ blueberries, bananas & strawberries and to be accompanied by a small scoop of peanut butter & whipped butter, boo yah! I also got the citrus blast salad, which was delicious & very filling. So many different types of fruits, veggies & nuts along w/ grilled chicken and crumbled bleu cheese.

Our waitress immediately came around with coffee (thank goodness!) and I ordered the country skillet with pancakes as the side. The food didn't take long, and was pretty flavorful. The portions are mammoth--you will get 2 or 3 meals out of this entree for sure. It was good but nothing special, and the pancakes had a strange tough texture. Not a fan.

2014-09-04,4.0,"If IKEA decided to open up a brunch restaurant... I don't think I've ever been this stuffed from brunch before in my life. Yolk not only impressed me with their portions, but flavor didn't suffer with the volume and I so wish they'd open one in NYC (but who am I kidding, the wait will probably grow to two hours within a week and ruin it for everyone). We arrived around 12PM on a Saturday, and our party of 3 was seated almost immediately. The interior reminded me of an IKEA catalog: everything was blue and gold themed. The booths and tables and chairs all looked the same. We couldn't believe Yolk only had 5 locations; the look and feel made it seem like 100+ locations, corporate style. Their extensive menu has anything brunch-y related, and some interesting styles on the classics (including a whole menu of eggs benedict). I opted for the Countryside Skillet with egg white and instead of pancakes, a side of red velvet french toast. The skillet was HUGE. Think personal 8 inch skillet that is two inches deep full of sausage, mushrooms, peppers, and cheese on a bed of potatoes. My egg whites covered the top of the skillet like a pizza and my french toast was served separately, complete with a whipped cream and strawberries garnish. There were no outstanding flavors, but everything was cooked perfectly. The potatoes weren't dry, the sausage moist, the peppers and onions caramelized. They weren't over seasoned either, which is a common brunch pitfall. The french toast was a little too much, and I struggled to get through even that one slice. It's literally a slice of cake, coated in cinnamon and eggs, and fried up. I'm surprised my stomach didn't explode by the end of the meal. The other items at the table were the South of the Border Benny and the West Coast Crepe. The benedict's strong point was the spice of the meat. It gave a nice kick before the egg yolk crept in to smooth things over. The crepe was strange because the batter was sweet. In combination with the avocado and eggs, it was a little hard to swallow. Service was pretty on par. I didn't order coffee, but the others' cups were never empty. By the time we left, there were at least 10 parties waiting, but I wouldn't be surprised if they got them seated in under 20 minutes. I would highly recommend Yolk to anyone in town, residents and tourists alike. You won't be disappointed, although you might need to siesta afterwards.",0.9961,0.807,0.159,0.034,0.48420289855072457

Our waiter was there for everything possible and wasn't intrusive, all the while tending to a few large parties.

When it arrived, everything looked beyond picture perfect. My omelet was perfect, the cheeses were at that perfect melted gooey stage, the veggies were snappy yet cooked thru, and the french toast... well, it might have been one of the best breakfast items I've ever looked at, or wrecked.  The Cajun skillet from my girlfriend's side of the table was incredible. Andoullie sausage, some peppers, onions, cajun spice with perfectly scrambled in, fluffy eggs over crispy yet not overdone American Fries style cut potats. Couldn't have asked for a better skillet really. Even the rye bread we got with it was toasted to perfection with just the right marks from the toaster and a perfect toast. Back to that french toast though... there are few things I'd describe as decadent and divine, but, this creation heads to those uncharted territories. Not to mention, but I will, the cream you're served with that goes with it, and the ridiculous sweetness and saltiness of the cream cheese inside. This is a home run dish.

Secondly, lets talk about the service.  Our server was super nice and very accommodating.  He checked on us multiple times and his one error, forgetting about a request for another chocolate milk, he readily admitted to and immediately returned with.  We weren't upset at all, but he still took it off of the bill as an act of good will.  Nicely done sir.  You get a bigger tip.   Honestly, a solid breakfast, brunch place.  I was also unaware of the BYOB status, and after seeing a large table crack open 4 bottles of champagne and order pitchers of orange juice, I felt like I had made a grave error.  Next time, I'll bring champagne too.   My only beef with this place is how ungodly loud it was.  It was busy, as in all the tables were full, but people were not waiting for tables.  We sat towards the back of the restaurant and it was still very difficult to hear each other.  For example, my husband asked me to order him a ""tall chocolate milk,"" while he went to the restroom but I misheard him and ordered a ""small"" instead.  Close? Yes.  A huge issue? No.  But throughout the breakfast, I had to ask him to repeat himself multiple times.  Enough to be annoying, and quite frankly enough to make us try another nearby brunch place next time in hopes of finding similar food quality but less noise level.  Let you know how we fare.",0.9689,0.783,0.145,0.072,0.49414160401002505

Everything is bright white, blue, and yellow. And above that Yolk is SMART! They have tables that have fold down flaps, so in the same table can fit either four or six people. It's just crazy to me that other places don't do this.  Now the food. After previous night celebrations, I got the hearty pot roast eggs benedict and a cinnamon roll on the side. The cinnamon roll was okay, not chalk full of sugar like most and it was fresh. On that particular morning I was looking for it to satisfy my sweet tooth though, so it just didn't fit the bill then. The pot roast bennies did though. The plate comes full of potatoes, fruit and of course the bennies over lots of pot roast meat. The roast was some of the best seasoned roast I've had in a while. The potatoes needed a little more salt, but were good enough to eat. It was warm, filling and a delight to eat.  The bf got the carnita egg sandwich, it was also very good. All of the components were plentiful. His only complaint was that in a few bites the goat cheese was too plentiful and overpowered the rest, but that was just a few bites. Our waitress was around when we needed her, even though we were in one of the back corners (out of the normal walk around). The meal was also not as expensive as some other breakfasts and we had mini meals to take home too. A very good morning started at Yolk. I can't wait to try some more of their creations my next visit.",0.9972,0.796,0.189,0.015,0.47412740037740053

I seriously wanted to order everything, but I knew I had to narrow it down to one dish or else I'd be showing off a food baby all day :(  I ordered the South of the Border Benny (eggs benedict w/ chorizo) and my friend had a made to order skillet. The food came out pretty fast and initially I thought it was really good. While the eggs were cooked perfectly and the potatoes that came on the side were tasty - the chorizo..after taking a few bites..was definitely way too salty. It kind of ruined the dish for me and I couldn't finish all of it. I could feel the sodium running through my pores.  My friend absoltely loved his dish though. He raved about it basically the entire trip.  The service was pretty good - the waitress did seem a little rushed. She came by the table about 4 times asking if we were ready to order yet - maybe gave us 3 minutes in between each visit.  I'd definitely come here again during my next visit to Chicago, but will just avoid the chorizo.

Yes, it was very filling, but I wasn't satisfied with the corned beef addition in the Irish Benny.

When I got back to the office it became clear that one of the orders was wrong - it had the wrong sides. Me and my coworker had ordered the crepes with eggs, avocado, cheese and mushrooms. The meal consists of two crepes stuffed with these ingredients. Now, maybe I'm crazy, but I expected a mix of these ingredients in each crepe. What I got was one crepe with egg, cheese and mushroom and a second crepe wrapped around some avocado. What a joke! Is the chef lazy or does he just not g.a.f?

It's clean, open, has a blue/yellow/silver modern-ish theme going on... and it's much bigger than you would think from the outside. I love that it has a bunch of booths flanked up against the walls that are pretty private, in which the walls of each booth goes to the ceiling so you can't see or hear the parties behind you. And even the bathrooms are cool too.  The food was unfortunately just ok. I got the corned beef hash with fruit and scrambled eggs on top. And upgraded to the blueberry granola pancakes. My husband got the eggs/sausage/potato pancake combo.   My corned beef hash was really soft- like ground up mush. Tasted ok, but the texture was kinda like wet dog food. I think I've been spoiled by places that actually use shredded corned beef and was expecting that from a place like this. The pancake was surprisingly dry and really crispy around the edges, like toast. Not burnt, just... crispy. My husband thought his eggs were well cooked (over-medium) and the potato pancakes were the standout of his dish. The meats were average.  And the coffee. So average. I like that they offer the flavored creamers, but the amount of regular half and half compared to the flavored creamers were 1 in i think 15. So, be prepared to ask for some half and half if sugary creamers are not your thing. And, lastly. The chocolate mints they offer at the register are great!

Lately if I have a sweet craving I've been going for their french toasts (try the Red Velvet or the Tour de France which is three different types of french toasts). If you're craving something savory go for the huevos rancheros or if all else fails the salmon benedict has yet to fail me. I like that the portions seem big but it's the side of fresh fruit that does it.  Don't be turned off by the long line (assuming you're visiting in the weekend at peak hours).

Croque madame w potatoes ($9.50): This was very surprising! To break it down, it was a french toast ham sandwich with grilled ham & turkey with swiss cheese and dijon sauce between two slices of challah french toast. It also had one egg sunny-side up with red diced potatoes. The sweet french toast was great but there was too much ham (as in too salty!) so once I took out some of that, it was great! The yolk from the egg also neutralized the saltiness a bit. Wonderful combination - give it a try!! 2. Eggs Benedict ($10.50): Everything was standard and delicious with 2 poached eggs and canadian bacon on top of english muffin halves topped with hollandaise sauce. Nothing out of the ordinary but how can you go wrong with eggs benedict?  Parking is difficult (what else is new?). But overall, Yolk was good!

The service was also quite lovely.  Great find and great value: my meal was about $10 and there was plenty left over; my companion's was just $6 for eggs, home fries and an english muffin.",0.9912,0.722,0.263,0.014,0.5892857142857143
2013-10-04,3.0,"I wanted to like this place more than I did - they had a lot of glowing reviews over the pancakes, french toast, and egg dishes and a lot of reviews. Maybe I chose the wrong dish to order. I'd certainly go back to try it one more time if I'm visiting Chicago and it's convenient, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back. I liked the decor of the place - with high ceilings, bright blue & yellow walls, and lots of natural sunlight. The menu is very expansive - omelettes, fritattas, pancakes, unique french toast, crepes. It was like the ""Cheesecake Factory"" of brunch - the menu had almost everything under the sun and it was a bit overwhelming to decide on a dish. I do have to say that the french toast selections looked good: red velvet french toast was essentially red velvet cake in french toast batter and then pan-fried. I didn't really want to eat cake for breakfast, but if I had a bigger group, I would have loved to try this. I ended up going with the West Coast Crepes ($10.49), which was avocado, mushrooms, cheese, and scrambled eggs in a sweet crepe. It got 2 pancakes for my side, and fruit. I can eat a lot, but this dish could have easily been shared between 2 people. I only ate 1 pancake, 1 crepe and a little bit of fruit. The crepe itself was good - not as thin as it could have been and it was a bit on the chewy side, but what was strange was the sweetness of the crepe mixed with the savory mushrooms and eggs. I think they would be better off trying a different type of crepe batter. The pancakes and fruit were decent, but nothing to write home about. You definitely get your money's worth in terms of quantity of food, but I would've preferred a more tailored and focused menu, with more quality dishes and less variety.",0.995,0.813,0.17,0.017,0.4196747967479675

My daughter and wife got omelets, and my son got the french toast. The burger was pretty good but nothing special. The french toast were also pretty good, but they didn't blow me away. If you're visiting Yolk for the first time, and you want something memorable I recommend the omelets, especially the California omelet! Wow. They are smooth and fluffy and full of delicious fresh ingredients. The thing I don't like about omelets, in general, is that sometimes restaurants feel like they have to overload the cheese and they skimp on the other ingredients. These omelets did not have that problem. Perfect amount of cheese and lots and lots of other stuff. If you like avocado, you're going to love the Californian. The one item that we didn't really like that much was the pancakes. They were below average, not very chewy or unique in any way. But that's okay. This isn't meant to be a pancake house.

The clientele here is a mix of tourists and the River North crowd (fratty bros and girls brunching in full Juicy sweatsuits). Now for the food, it's your typical standard American brunch fare (but with a very wide selection), and somehow, better. The omelets, skillets, and pancakes appear on the menu like you would expect, but it all just tastes better. And prices are very reasonable. The environment is very open, sunny and just makes you feel happy.

The wait was about 15 minutes - but that's expected on a Saturday morning at 10:45am.  As other reviewers have commented, the tables turn quickly and soon we were seated in the middle section, between the bar and the booths. We ordered a Scrambler breakfast (eggs, bacon, turkey sausage, and tomato - healthy food for walking the city - don't judge my simplicity) and upgraded the pancakes to the Chocolate Strawberry version; we also ordered the Tour de France selection of french toasts. The pancakes were incredible ... maybe the most delicious I've had.  The strawberries and chocolate rendered syrup unnecessary; syrup would have ruined the taste, frankly (apologies to Vince Vaughan's ""Wedding Crashers"" character.) Even better, though, were the french toasts.  I couldn't tell you which was best - the banana bread (fresh sliced banana topping), the orange (fresh sliced strawberry topping), and the lemon poppyseed (fresh blueberries topping) were each flavorful and light, and our forks kept going from one to the next as we tried to choose a favorite. The coffee was strong, which helped to offset the sweet carb overload we were devouring from the plates, and the orange juice was fresh. Those cups stayed full thanks to personal and attentive service from the waitstaff. The decor was simple but well-executed; bright whites and yellows (like an egg) offset by blue and light grey, to allow the attention to be on the food and not the walls.

However, the waitress was very polite and kept refilling my mug and I kept drinking it - such is the life of a coffee enthusiast (and by enthusiast, I mean addict). Luckily my water glass was also frequently refilled as I was absolutely parched and, as an added bonus, Yolk uses crushed up ice reformed into mini-cubes, which are my favorite type of ice cubes (I'm a bit of an ice cube snob).

2013-03-10,3.0,I like it.  Don't love it.   Country side skillet - large portion and very filling and delicious. For $3 extra (i think it was 3...) you can replace your side of toast with a side of red velvet french toast.  If you're curious about it then I suggest you do this option instead of ordering the red velvet french toast as a full meal (unless you reallllly love sweets/cake that much).  I'm a huge sweets/cake lover and my bf and I still didn't finish the small stack of 3 small pancakes  because battered cake slices grilled for breakfast is just a tad much.  The cake is just okay....you're probably better off getting some better quality red velvet cake all on it's own later but that's just my opinion. I was deciding between the red velvet french toast meal and the Tour de France and ended up getting the Tour de France for the full meal.  I had no regrets as it was delicious.    The sweet orange bread was my favorite.  So unique and sensational.  I could have a whole french toast meal with just the sweet orange bread and strawberries.  The lemon poppy seed bread was a second favorite with the banana bread coming in last but it was still great.  Taste it first before dumping the syrups on as I love sweets but ate the meal without most of the syrups. The orange marmalade/syrup was a bit too tart for me.  Other yelp reviews raving about the strawberry orange juice are on point.  I was definitely happy I tried it.,0.989,0.755,0.184,0.061,0.45762471655328807

Waited over an hour, be prepared to wait at all locations (some longer than others, especially on weekends). We both got the french toast combo's- he tried the cinnamon roll and I got the red velvet. Both are equally as good and we continue to order those every time we go there. The best part of the red velvet was the cream cheese surprise in the middle.

2013-02-24,3.0,"As a diner, I like intimate, quiet places where conversation can be had with minimal interruption. This, as I found out, is not that place.  My sister was in town and one of her favorite areas of the city is River North--which is understandable. It houses so many of her (and my) favorites. Chief among being Fox & Obel and D4 Irish Pub within a block's walk of each other--so we landed in Yolk by a friend's suggestion. It was busy (surprise) but the wait was short. Busy, I can manage. But the volume level in this restaurant is absurd.  Loud clientele mixed with the kitchen being open and clambering away at its own breakneck speed made me instantly feel on edge. Souring over the top of all of this was some pseudo Eruotrash club beat that just seemed unreasonable for a restaurant slinging eggs. We were seated eventually and led to a second section of the restaurant featuring a monstrous wall of glass, atrium style.  If you've ever wanted to know what it would be like to eat in a restaurant where the theme is ""Discount IKEA College Cafeteria,"" this is your place. Garish yellow and blue geometric shapes and modern self-assemblies, IKEA silverware and booths that feel more like lego cubicles are the motif. Not a top-ten on aesthetics for me.  The food, however, is the exact opposite story. The same goes for the service. Our server, Katie, was an absolute doll. Charming and attentive, sweet and very cheerful for how stressed she must've been given how crowded the joint was. She gave us all the time we needed to look over the ample menu and was quick on the draw with refills.  My Tuscan Frittata--with basil, sun dried tomatoes, red potatoes, spinach and chunks of chicken--was completely without flaw. Resonably price, fluffy, perfectly seasoned and served with a healthy mound of creamy goat cheese to soften the acidity of the tomatoes... it was beautiful. I can't say I suggest Yolk for it's atmosphere, but I 100% recommend their food.",0.9922,0.858,0.129,0.013,0.4871621621621621

2013-02-23,3.0,"I've been to both Yolk locations, and my review can apply to either one.  The food is quite good.  I especially enjoy the omelettes, but you can't really go wrong with anything you order.  The prices are fairly reasonable, considering the quality of the dishes.  The atmosphere is modern and trendy, and much less harsh than most breakfast joints. This place loses stars in two areas.  First, the service is hit or miss.  I've had excellent waiters, but also some who barely checked in with us or refilled our waters.  The second thing that loses stars for Yolk is the wait.  We've had to wait upwards of 45 minutes to be seated.  It doesn't matter which location you go to, you shouldn't arrive too hungry because you will have to wait to eat.  It's always crowded, so if you're claustrophobic, I'd recommend you try somewhere else. Yolk exceeds my expectations in some areas, but falls short in others.  Go when you have a relaxed schedule and some good friends to talk to while you wait.",0.963,0.794,0.145,0.061,0.49166666666666653

Luckily it was a warm day so it wasn't an issue to wait outside as the line overflowed well beyond the door. The menu is nothing short of impressive. After doing a quick walkthrough of the place, my initial thought was ""Omelet, omelet, omelet"". This place makes some seriously good looking omelets. On closer, less impulsive inspection, I picked The Farm House.  I was rewarded with a plate filled with southern goodness in 4 biscuits completely covered in sausage gravy, 2 eggs, and potatoes. Put more simply it was enough food for a large animal. The whole meal was good, but I found myself wishing there was a little less gravy. By the end of the meal the last biscuit had lost the fluffiness that made it so good. The person I was with got one of the skillet dishes. It looked good and featured a wide variety of vegetables include squash and mushrooms.  Overall I was happy with my meal. The food was good but nothing out of the ordinary.

2012-06-17,4.0,"I was highly skeptical of Yolk since it seemed like another crowded and overrated brunch place, but we needed a brunch place in the area, and Yolk must do.  We got there around 11am, and there was lots of people waiting outside. I was a bit apprehensive since the wait might be long, and the place was packed inside. I asked the hostess for the wait, and she said about 20 minutes. So we decided to wait.  About fifteen minutes later, our names were called and we got seated. Luckily, we got a booth (hostess asked if we would take 2 seats at the bar and I said yes but hoping for no). Our waiter came out momentarily with water and coffee. Their coffee was delicious, and I loved the selections of creamers they had: white chocolate mocha, hazelnut, half&half, and caramel macchiato to name a few.  Yolk's menu is pretty extensive and relatively cheap for the area. They have creative options such as various types of french toast (red velvet included), lots of omelet and sweet breakfast food, and various type of oatmeal too. For about $8-12 each, I thought it was decently priced.  Still feeling greasy from the Chinese food I ate about 8 hours ago, I decided to go with the berry oatmeal (this is rare, since I never pass on a chance to load up on breakfast food). My dinning partner got the Mediterranean omelet, which came with 2 sides - fruits (or potatoes) and pancakes (or toast). The food didn't take long to come out, despite the fact that the restaurant was getting more and more crowded. I had a full plate of oatmeal that came with granola, fresh blue & blackberry, some milk and sugar on the side. It looked (and tasted) divine. The omelet look delicious as well, and seeing him enjoying it, I'm sure it tasted wonderfully. They didn't skimp on the fruits either, he got lots of fruits, and two large pancakes that can easily be someone else's breakfast - which it later became part of mine, since he couldn't finish it after the big omelet and fruit.  Our server was nice. He was really busy but made sure to come back and check on us throughout our meal. Our coffee was refilled repeatedly.

As for the restaurant environment, the space was very clean and brightly colored with yellow-orange walls and light hardwood floors that made the most of the natural light from the front of the diner.  The counter seating facing the open kitchen looked like it could be very crowded when full, but otherwise the tables seemed generously spaced (though at 7am on Memorial Day I had only a small handful of fellow diners).  There is a pretty ample waiting area where most places would probably try to pack in a few more tables.  Also, given the noise from the kitchen, I could see how the place could get especially loud when full.  As an appreciated little bonus, Yolk is the first place I have seen with Truvia sweetener available at the table without special request.",0.975,0.861,0.108,0.031,0.5012804232804233

Brunch when I need it the most.  Brunch when no other meal will make me happy and comforted all at the same time. Yolk fits the bill. While the menu isn't necessarily something to write home about, there are a TON of options that would make a table of completely different tastes 100% happy.  You'll find omelets, combination plates with any kind of breakfast staple imaginable, skillets, luscious French toast and pancake plates (is luscious the right word?), and even standard lunch items (if you want to be ""that guy"" that orders lunch items at a place called ""Yolk"".) The service is generally ok, but I have had some experiences with a couple of waiters in particular that seemed genuinely uninterested in our table.  However, after so many visits to the place, I've chalked it up as the exception and not the rule. The majority of occasions have been pleasant and, when prompted ahead of time that we have a limit on lunch, the servers have been very accommodating with speedy delivery and service. All in all, this place is very solid and more than lives up to expectations. The price points aren't absurd and the bright atmosphere makes for a very delightful midday experience.  You won't go broke when you eat at Yolk. Well that wasn't very good...",0.9872,0.857,0.137,0.006,0.5683035714285716
2012-03-22,4.0,"So I see why there is always at least a 30-min wait on weekends...these are some damn good eggs. My boyfriend and I thought we could escape the wait by heading over at 9:30am on a Sunday morning (isn't everyone still hungover and asleep at that time?!), but failed miserably. Granted, the weather was beautiful so a 35-minute wait wasn't that bad.  I am a very indecisive person, and places like Yolk only compound that problem: there are options up the wazoo, and all of them look amazing. After much hemming and hawing, I went with the the Works and the man went with the Big Texas Fajita Omelette. Good choices all around, though he whined that his chicken was a bit dry. I told him to throw some more ketchup on there and man up. Kidding. Kind of.  Service was where Yolk really shined. Our server was friendly and bubbly, but not to an annoying extent (and kudos for complimenting me on my new St. Patty's induced tan). And when the food took a bit longer than expected, she was quick to apologize and refill coffee and water.

2012-03-13,1.0,"In one word this place SUCKS. You have to be out of your mind if you think this place deserves more than 1 star. It is a step up from IHOP in food quality, customer service and ambiance. Today was my first time at Yolk. When I walked in, there were 3 waitresses talking to 2 guys sitting at the counter. I sat down at the counter a few seats away from them. Not one of the 3 waitresses acknowledged me. Another waitress came by and looked at me like she was confused by me sitting at the counter. She paused before offering me a menu. I asked for recommendations and she seemed put off. I ordered the Crepe Combo which included 2 crepes, 2 eggs, 2 slices of applewood smoked bacon and 2 sausage links. I upgraded to the Nutella crepes. The crepes arrived first. They were actually good, but really, what isn't good with Nutella on it? The eggs and meat arrived second. I specifically asked for my eggs scrambled and not to be browned. What did I get? The grossest looking scrambled eggs I have ever seen. They were browned in certain spots but runny in other spots - how the hell do you even do that??? I asked for the eggs to be redone. They came back yellow but unfortunately they were still bad. The texture wasn't right at all. Seems petty and trust me I regret not taking a photo of what they gave me because if I posted it , you would know I'm not being petty. The bacon and the sausage were VERY low quality. The applewood bacon from Trader Joe's and Wholefoods is waaaay better than this crap. I also made the mistake of ordering a caramel latte for about $4.50 which is about $1 more than most restaurants and it was much smaller and low quality (surprise).  If you are going to call your restaurant YOLK you better get the eggs right! It would behoove the owner to hire cooks that can scramble eggs!!! And what did I pay you ask? $16.79 for one person!!!! NEVER AGAIN",-0.9809,0.812,0.059,0.129,0.43074368018812476

I found that Yolk is a diner that is actually *worth* the prices. Almost $10 for a scrambler at some diners, and you get frozen veggies and tons of cheese. My zucchini, tomato, and cheddar scrambled eggs at Yolk was SO fresh it was like the grew the veggies in the kitchen. My waitress was accommodating, and b/c the oil they use to cook with is soy-based, she had the cooks make my eggs dry, and off to the side of the rest of the cooking. I don't know how they did it, but I had no problem, which was much appreciated.  I did have to skip the potatoes though (sadly, they looked so good!), and went with a side of fruit-- but not just a little bowl of melon--a slice of watermelon, pineapple, two slices of oranges, and a big bunch of grapes.  I didn't try the coffee (that was pricey (almost $3) which I always find a little annoying...it's just coffee...) but happily ordered I fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice. I LOVE grapefruit juice, and Yolk did not disappoint. They also have fresh-squeezed OJ, which I'm sure is equally as good.

(quartered), topped with a large amount of diced chicken mixed with toasted pecans, honey mustard on the side, with a breadstick.  This was a good looking salad [I'm somewhat of a salad lover & snob, and I hate nothing more than a sad, chintzy salad posing as an entree - this salad made the cut].  Everything was fresh, plentiful, and made a great combo with the dressing.   * The only downside I'd say is that they get crazy busy and crazy super loud.  Any very busy restaurant is going to get loud - no way around that.  But today's visit, while surrounded by lunch-goers, babies & baby mamas and strollers everywhere - it was particularly loud and hard to hear conversation at our small table.    Also, at the South Loop location, our party of 4 waited about an hour the last time in their loud, jam-packed front space.  Not very pleasant.  But I know that's typical for weekend brunch.  As I've mentioned in a previous post, brunch in Chicago is a battle.",0.9883,0.759,0.169,0.073,0.5614483815504224

2011-08-15,3.0,"I was really excited to try Yolk and we had been in Chicago for the weekend and decided to skip my standard spot of the Bongo Room and head for something different. Right away I noticed that size does matter, we arrived early but considering it was 9:30 am, we walked right in, but got a table right next to the kitchen which was probably the loudest table in the resturant. Once we settled in, our party of six noticed that the coffee quality was not the best, ideally I am not expecting a french press standard, but this was just slightly above diner style. Our party of six ordered everything; a variety of things off the menu, and in the end it was all OK....I would say that usually when I go out for breakfast in the city, there is always one dish that is a must have. This trip to Yolk did not have it. On a plus side, since this establishment does not serve adult beverages, the family forward approach is everywhere. I felt very comfortable as my two kids had there moments of screaming, because I was surounded by an army of shorties at most table in the back.

After sitting, we quickly, efficiently received our black coffees and set about choosing breakfast from a VAST menu. I remarked how large the restaurant was and that the service was friendly, but... efficient shall we say. I chose the zamboni crepe with the side of pancakes. When it all came to the table, it was less than 10 minutes later and it barely fit on our two top. But with space-saving techniques, we managed.

2011-08-01,4.0,"Here's a tip: go early. The bf & I arrived around 10am on Sunday (the fact that he was out & about that early on a weekend was a minor miracle in itself, but I digress) and were quoted a 10-15 minute wait. However, we were seated in about 5. When we left, it must more crowded and people were getting 30 minute quotes. So the early bird gets the eggs! Which is kind of weird, when you think about it... The service was good. Water and coffee were both refilled, the waitress was nice and checked on us a couple times. However, our food took quite awhile to come out. We even saw one pair who arrived after we ordered leave before us. But how's the FOOD?! you ask... I'm getting to it! The menu is impressively diverse for a brunch place. Not the biggest I've seen, but there is certainly something (most likely many somethings) for everyone. I went with a scramble called, IIRC, El Torero Scrambler. It was made with chorizo, avocado, tomato, cheese and maybe a couple other things. And it was very good! It was much more flavorful and balanced than a similar item I ordered from another brunch place a couple weeks ago. It came with a big pile of yummy potatoes and ... pancakes! Yes, you can choose between toast, English muffin and pancakes with your eggy breakfast, so savory brunch fans (like me) can get a little bit of sweet too. Everything tasted good, and there was plenty of it to satisfy my substantial appetite, with food left over. Alas, not everything is sunshine and rainbows. The atmosphere is not ideal. It's loud in there, and made worse by the fact that they call out the names of parties over a loudspeaker up front. We were seated near the front and heard them call every. single. party. After awhile I tuned it out, but it's still a mild nuisance. If I can manage to get here early enough again, I'll definitely be back for the tasty food. But at peak brunch hours I'm not sure it's worth the wait. And I wouldn't come here if I wanted a quiet, relaxing meal either, that's for sure.

I came across this place thanks to Yelp in looking for a great breakfast/brunch place for my girlfriends and I since we were living off of the hotel's continental breakfast for the majority of the mornings.   The menu has EVERYTHING you could ever want for breakfast from mediterranean omelettes, to halved-pineapples filled with yogurt, fruit and granola, to banana's foster crepes!  It's places like this that made me wish I were a breakfast person and liked eggs b/c the frittata and omelette menu was incredible! Since we did technically go at lunch time, I opted for their tropical walnut chicken salad. It came with grilled chicken, papaya, avocado, strawberries and walnuts, along with their raspberry vinaigrette. Perhaps I'm spoiled b/c we live in Miami and our fruit (strawberries and papaya especially) this time of year are amazing, so I was a little disappointed with the ""freshness"" of theirs. However the restaurant quickly won me over after I convinced everyone to split the Red Velvet French Toast for dessert. (A sugar hangover was guaranteed had I ordered it as a meal after seeing).  Three slices of Red Velvet cake with swirls of cream cheese were dipped in batter and grilled, then topped with strawberries and whipped cream.  As soon as it came to the table, my girls and I thought we'd only eat a bite b/c we were so full. It's safe to say we only left a bite and converted one of the girls that doesn't even like Red Velvet cake into having her like the dessert better than her omelette!

Definitely be prepared for a wait on the weekends no matter what the time. We decided to go early on a Sunday to try to avoid the line. We were there around 10:15am, it was RAINING, and we were still standing around for 30 min+.   The bathrooms, not exciting decoration wise (I somehow expected more from a place like yolk) and it was a small bathroom given the size of the place (3 stalls).

I ended up taking all of it out. The majority of the flavor was due to the salsa they serve on the side. I doused the burrito/quesadilla with salsa.

2011-05-18,4.0,"Met a friend here today for brunch. I had decided on it based on the various options available since a lot of other highly rated brunch places have limited options. Considering that my options are already usually pretty limited, it's not helpful to me when there's only a few options available to begin with. For that, Yolk seemed great. I did recall going to the Michigan Ave location and there being some sort of peanut issue, but I wasn't sure what the exact issue was and since I didn't see anything show up on the menu when I perused it online, I figured it was worth a chance. We were seated right away but then again, it's Wednesday, so that was expected.  I came in really wanting some pancakes but I really like potatoes so wasn't sure what I was going to do. Fortunately for me, they have a veggie skillet which has the option of pancakes as a side dish=perfect option! I informed the waiter that I have a peanut allergy. He said something about fry oil which I didn't really understand but whatever it was gave me the impression that it would be ok. When the food came out, he told me that they decided not to use oil on my skillet to be on the safe side and just used water. I don't know why they did that and why they didn't tell me that before they actually went through with it. Maybe they use peanut oil? I feel like if they do, that should definitely be written on the menu. Who uses peanut oil anymore anyway? Makes no sense to me. That makes them lose a star. Fortunately for all involved, the food was fantastic. The pancakes were light and fluffy and the skillet was deliciously seasoned. Didn't even need any ketchup (and I love ketchup!). The skillet tasted healthy and I'm wondering if it would have ended up being greasy if they had used oil to cook it. They may have done me a favor but without knowing what the actual skillet is like, I can't say for sure. I definitely ate too much and still ended up bringing home some of the skillet (breakfast for tomorrow!).  Overall, good food, good value. I know that I will be back again although I may call them beforehand to really find out what is going on with the peanut oil.",0.9956,0.792,0.166,0.042,0.45007549361207894

2011-04-17,3.0,"Pretty decent brunch/breakfast spot but not the best brunch I've ever had. Dined here with the BF, a dear friend, her sister and toddler. They don't take reservations on the weekend which was a bummer but I understand, first come, first served. This place is BUSY. We arrived at about 11:10 AM. We waited a good 30 to 40 minutes but that's what they estimated for us, so no problem. I wouldn't say this place is anything special or a stand out, must go here type of spot but it was still very tasty. The BF had The Works Omelet with essentially everything in it. His words ""it was good, I definitely enjoyed it, but I am not raving about it.""  My friend had a basic ham and cheese omelet that she seemed to enjoy and her sister had sausage, scrambled eggs and cheese. Her dish looked good but to be honest, she ate nearly none of it. I think she was too distracted by her toddler who gobbled up her pancakes and fruit. I had the biscuits and gravy with sunny side eggs on top, potatoes on the side. This was decent. I have a nearby restaurant that serves up literally the BEST biscuits and gravy that I have ever had (Morseland in Rogers Park) and I wanted to compare their dishes. Yolk really doesn't compare. Their biscuits are not freshly made like Morseland's and their gravy lacks the dynamic, homemade sausage flavor of Morseland's. The only thing that saved Yolk's biscuits and gravy were the two eggs on top - the runny yolk covering the biscuits and gravy really made the dish 20 times better than it would have been without. Our waiter was great though - Casey Affleck look alike, super friendly, fast service, good with the toddler, which I appreciated.  Overall a fine dining experience, good food but not great. I wouldn't make a special trip here (as I live in Roger's Park and their food wasn't spectacular enough for the 35-40 minute L ride) but I wouldn't discourage anyone from dining here. Prepare for a decent wait but keep your fingers crossed for the Casey Affleck waiter, he has crazy hair, you can't miss him.",0.9984,0.688,0.258,0.055,0.515531561461794
2011-04-16,3.0,"Like my passion for photoshopping my girlfriend's faces  on Donald Trump's body, my passion for brunch is undeniable. As my favorite meal, I take it very seriously when choosing a location that fits all of my criteria for that special brunch experience. By brunch experience, I mean...when even in the winter time you feel the sun is shining, the orange juice is flowing, beach boys is playing in your head and the smell of maple syrup and fresh brewed coffee is lingering in the air. Good conversation is prompted by the stellar service from the waiter/waitress whom seems to have a knack form making a typical piece of toast sound like you've never tasted something so magnificient.

No lemon twist in the hollandaise, no added anything...pretty straight forward. The Tour de France was really decadent and yummy. It has peanut butter to spread on the banana bread french toast, lemon syrup for the poppy seed french toast and maple syrup for the strawberry french toast.

Needless to say, there was no line and my friend and I had a delicious brunch. I enjoyed the clean modern ambience and the eggy theme. I'm not normally in this neck of the woods as I dwell in Ravenswood, but we were shopping in the area and it was a nice change of pace from my usual scene. At the time, I was on something resembling a diet, so I went with Jenny's Berry Bliss, which was a bowl of yogurt, berries and granola. It really was a treat, however, and I remember making a mental note to come back. Skip to a few weeks ago, and my husband and I head down to Yolk in order for him to have the same lovely experience that I did. Our mistake? Going in at 12:30 on a Saturday. I put my name in and settled in to wait. And wait. Luckily I had eaten something little earlier in the day, but poor husband had not, so we managed to get into a bickering match while trying to decide what to do about the ever increasing hopelessness of our situation. Let me be clear. We come from timid folk. Neither one of us wants to ""cause a fuss"" or ""ask to be treated like humans"", so we waited considerably longer than anyone standing around us (or who came in after us). We, like neurotics from a Woody Allen film, concocted theories that others had phoned in their reservations, knew the manager, were secretly royalty and/or were just better people than us. Eventually (an hour and 20 minutes later), I mustered some pluck and golly gee marched right up there and demanded to be heard. ""Um, excuse me,"" I bleated, ""I hate to bother you, but the name is 'Catherine' and I'm just wondering where I am on the list. Please forgive me.""  The nice gentleman behind the counter told me that there were about three names in front of me, and then we were the VERY next name to be called (suspicious? a tiny bit). Anyway, we sat down and ate. By this time, even my blood sugar was a little low, so I decided I had to have the Nutella Crepes. My surly man friend ordered the Iron Works omelet. He enjoyed his omelet, but I thought my crepes were kind of gross. In retrospect, it might be hard to smother crepes with Nutella and chocolate sauce and have them retain any texture whatsoever, but they were spongy and chewy and I lost interest after a few bites.  In short, don't go at peak hours on a Saturday unless you're Cher or phoned in your reservation to the reservation hotline (? could be imaginary).

This place looks pretty small from the outside, but the seating actually goes way back into the restaurant, accommodating everything from brunch dates to huge families to groups of college kids with their laptops.  The color scheme is a bit odd (blue and yellow - Ikea colors) and the booths are a lot less comfortable than they look, but this places serves up some solid breakfast food. The menu is large but pretty straightforward - I ordered fresh-squeezed strawberry orange juice (definitely my favorite part of the meal - I highly recommend it) and a platter of french toast, sausage, bacon and eggs. It was HUGE! Everything was tasty, but I could only finish half. Our server was ridiculously friendly and talked about how iced coffee was his version of crack.

I hadn't heard of the place before, but was recommended to go here several times, so I decided to give it a shot. Had the corned beef hash, served in a very generous portion. The corned beef was a little bit salty for my preference, but the egg was cooked perfectly to order and the potatoes were just about right. The food was warm when it hit the table, not sizzling hot (the way I like it). I kind of expected this given that we came in at a later part of their open hours, but definitely would have appreciated warmer food. Tried a bit of my friend's pot roast benedict (this place has some of the largest variety of eggs benedict variations around... very impressive!) and it was absolutely melt in my mouth delicious!

The waiter was a little bit too fast to serve us in sense that I felt as though we were a bit rushed... he also managed to never even get us the dessert crepes which we had ordered earlier. However, he adjusted the ticket afterwards when we informed him and he apologized.  All in all, the food is pretty solid and the prices are most certainly reasonable.

While it's always really well presented, and portion sizes are generous, there seems to be something lacking to me. And usually that's flavor. That said, they do get it right on quite few things. Their traditional eggs benedict is really good. The stuffed french toast with cream cheese hits the sweet spot. And there are a couple of tasty salads there too (though I recommend avoiding the ones with fruit).  Note for graphic designers: Beware!

2011-01-09,3.0,"I experienced the SAME problem as Goody G with the fat guy ""in charge."" His name happens to be Peter for anyone reading. He is overweight, dark curly hair, and needs a major attitude adjustments. If you ever see him, tell him that he should try better to be a gentleman and more respectful to women. In fact, I love Yolk, but I would avoid this location just because of him. Just go over to Streeterville. MY experience (not too dissimilar just longer) is as follows: We had an awesome waiter who was super accommodating. Somehow we got our communication switched and we thought we could get separate checks. Whatever, no biggie.  There was confusion at the register because my TWELVE year old nephew went to go pay for our portion while I waited on something at the table. This is when I first saw Peter causing trouble. So of course, I get up, and get there just in time to hear Peter snap on his register clerk, ""NO! We can't do it, forget it! And storm off!""  Not only is he rude with the customers, but he is rude TO HIS OWN STAFF, which must make for the WORST working environment in a place with such high potential. He yells at them to hurry, cut customers short, etc. So we are trying to work it out, and he proceeds to come back, literally RIP the receipt out of his staff's hand, and say, ""It's not too difficult, it's simple math, I'll divide it out, geeze"" To which I respond, ""thank you sir we are not slow,"" and he says, ""great, then act like it!"" (seriously?!?!) I asked him not to speak to me in such a manner and told him that poor customer service was bad for business, to which he replies, ""Do you see this line? Do you know how long you waited? A single problem will never ruin this business."" Oh yeah, he also waved a finger so close to my face I thought he might actually hit me. I finally get away to my seat and start doing the math. Once we figure it out, I come back up to the register where he is hovering. I politely tell this rude man that ""I no longer need his help and it is being taken care of,"" to which he replies, ""if you don't leave now, I'm going to call the cops!"" Of course, as I have not paid yet, I say, ""yes of course, I'll just leave now without paying."" To which he replies, ""then I definitely will."" (really, how slow are you?)   Please Peter, I beg you to call the cops with your horrible attitude problems, and every other time you have an attitude problem. Then perhaps you will get fired as you should have been as part of Yolk's New Year's resolution. My favorite part was when I told him that he should have never been hired and that his horrible customer service skills were beyond rude and acceptable. To which he replied, ""watch your mouth in my restaurant"". Peter, you are not Taki (the owner), remember that. The worst part about this is that maybe 4 or 5 staff members came over to me to apologize for their manager. I told them that they were great but their manager is sooo rude. To this point, they all AGREED as if they were use to it! In fact, they were MORE THAN HAPPY to give me all the information I needed to contact the owner! (clearly they do not want this guy around either!) Peter, if you're reading this, you're an incredible jerk and I'm sorry for whatever makes your life so miserable. You do not yell at young females and young children in such a manner as you did. Especially in the role of customer service delivery. You probably take tips away from the waiters, that sucks. Additionally, I am clearly not the only person who has a problem with you so I suggest you have a MAJOR attitude check. The Conclusion:  1) Peter has a horrible attitude and shouldn't be in the customer service business much less in management 2) Peter will cause the River North local to get a bad rep 3) Peter is racist (as I am also African American) 4) Peter needs to be fired ASAP or Taki Kastanis (the owner) is just incredibly slow and/or racist as well DO NOT GO HERE ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE BLACK  LOOP SOUTH IS AWWWWWEEEESOME TOO!

I step into line to pay and there are a couple of ladies standing in front of me but because they have it set up in such a ridiculous way that the register is right off the area where the bussers have to bring their carts, etc we all had to step back to let the bussers do their thang.

When I have a break in work, my stomach is a rumbling and a bit of work ahead of me, a quick call and in about 12 minutes or so I am walking back to work with a ton of food that will power me through the day. The Tuscan Fritatta is my go to here. Eggs baked with pieces of chicken, potatoes, spinach and then when it is all backed through, topped with a small smattering of goat cheese. With the fruit and toast it comes with, I have enough for two meals, which I have to do most times because other wise I would be wobbling around in a dazed food coma.  Plus the menu is huge! Choices galore! So even the pickiest of eaters might even find a fight in their mind trying to decide between creating their own scrambles and pancakes. I do also appreciate that they have healthy alternatives to many of their dishes. Want a scramble with egg whites or egg beaters? No problem and no extra charge. Want waffles? Go for the healthier version of a whole wheat waffle with yogurt, granola and fruit on top. The staff is always friendly, smiling and up beat, even in the slightly early morning, which always helps to get my day going in a good direction.

The food came up very quickly  - best thing about breakfast foods. The service was good despite being pretty busy around noon. No problems at all and no complaints.  The menu had something on it to please anyone and most dishes were $9.99. A few plates included salmon and steak which were still reasonably priced. I was pleasantly surprised for the River North area.  Eggs Benedict was the choice. Voted best in town, by who, I am not sure but they were damn good. Two poached eggs and canadian bacon atop english muffin halves. Topped with homemade hollandaise sauce accompanied by diced potatoes and fruit. In my book you can't go wrong soping up egg yolks with an english muffin. Its as if I was in a different world and didn't have to go back to work in a half hour. Hah, reality check. And that is worth every penny. Mixing it up with some breakfast was the best lunch choice I have made in a while. I've have a few blunderous choices recently but this definitely made up for it.

Last year I thought the crepes were ""good, but not the best ever;"" I've got to say I still feel the same way. The dish is similar to the Crepes Suzette minus the rich, buttery Grand Marnier sauce. The crepes were a bit thicker and heavier than I would have liked, I think they would have seemed lighter had the fruit been inside.

For a mere two extra dollars, you can indulge in the chocolate and strawberry version or enjoy the blueberry banana nut pancakes (my personal fave) - after eating one of these, you'll wonder how you ever thought plain old buttermilk was good enough.  I'd pay a lot more to enjoy those edible wonders. Pancakes aside, this place has A LOT of great options - the omelette, crepe and fritatta options are copious and interesting (avocado + eggs = how did I ever live without this amazing combo). FYI - if you order the ironman, request cheese to be added - it's a bit plain without.  The service was fast, the space is appealingly happy, and the prices aren't too ridiculously high. We arrived on a Saturday at about 9:30 a.m. and just got in before the rush started.

It's not very often you find pancakes as a side, and while I'm not much of a pancake girl, it's nice to have the option for some sweetness. My english muffin was pretty bomb, and I like that they have lots of butter packets on the table. I'm big into butter so the more the better. And I definitely packed it on. I also LOVED my mediterannean omelet! It had feta, tomato, and spinach and it was so good. The tomato was very refreshing and I love any kind of cheese so I obviously was in heaven with the feta. The entire order was more than enough. The omelet was ginormous, there were mounds of potatoes, and then of course, the english muffins. And for all that it only cost $9.99. So, that's a pretty good deal. Also, loved their fresh squeeze orange juice and I thought their coffee was pretty good too.

The thing about this place is that it's good but I can't figure out if I feel cool being there. Not everything in life is about being cool (parties, friends) but a lot of things are (jackets, dance moves) and this place is confusing. It has that look like I know something and that's why I'm here but then again I feel weird saying this place is cool. My cool jacket? I have no problem saying it's cool. That's the difference. I guess I am a little bent out of shape because when I asked the waitress what the french fries were like she replied and said ""french fries."" And then I was like ""well, are they crinkle cut or shoestring or waffle or what?"" And she made me feel uncool. I don't like feeling uncool. So I guess I'd go here with some people who I already don't think are real cool but I wouldn't go here with anyone who considered my reputation to be on the line. My friends who don't think about these things, by the way, were really into this place.

The food, there is so much of it. I've only gotten the same thing both times, the orange bread french toast. So good, I don't know if I wana branch out and try new things there. My friend who was with me the 2nd time had so much food, he couldn't finish it. One thing I like about Yolk is the selection. Oddly enough, I don't enjoy eggs (but I do like soft-boiled eggs), so their selection is great still. The place itself is nice, and as someone in another review said, the decor makes me think of IKEA. One thing I really enjoy is sitting up at the counter and watching the kitchen. The two times I've been there have been on the weekends and I want to go there sometime during a weekday, which I hear is kinda slow.

2010-04-14,4.0,"I'd discounted Yolk for a while. So many people seemed so blasé about the South Loop location, I just kept it moving. After all, I had plenty of great brunch spots to keep me occupied. Well, those blasé attitudes are wrong wrong wrong. I'm a big fan of Yolk for 6 reasons. 1.) Design: The layout is very cool. Large window doors open up into a wide open space that reveals the kitchen, counter service, booths and a dining room. As soon as you walk in, a wall mounted flat-screen welcomes you in with choice tv of the day. While I was there I found out that NeNe's cousin's boyfriend was NOT the daddy. Who knew? Even with a lot of people, the noise levels are manageable, the light yellows and whites are pleasing to the eye and the modern, clean lines compel exploration. 2.) Service. My party's waitress was attentive, funny, patient, and a PRO at figuring out what each person should order. She didn't lead any of us wrong and, in fact, helped steer me to some new loves. 3.) Strawberry Orange Juice. Fresh squeezed. Sweet. Full of seeds and pulp. Blood-orange in color. De.licious. 4.) Hey Ricky omelet. Avocado, peppers, cheese, salsa, chorizo, amd tomatoes. HUGE portion. Each bite was full of flavor and ingredients. The omelet was served on an over-sized plate and it took up half of it. Not only was the omelet filling but it came with two sides. I chose the fruit (honey dew, cantaloupe, pineapple, grapes, strawberries) and... 5.) CHOCOLATE STRAWBERRY PANCAKES!!!! A 'side' order came on a regular-sized plate, two pancakes, filled with chocolate chips & strawberries, topped with whipped cream, powdered sugar, chocolate sauce, and fresh strawberries. You all know my love-life. Its non-existent. Food is my friend (I am crying out for help, here!!). After these pancakes, I smoked a cigarette, scratched JT + CSP onto my Mead notebook and drunk-dialed the number several times.  turned.me .OUT! 6.) Derrek Lee. So, my best bro just happened to be at Yolk, chillin' with his family. I stopped by, shot the sh!t and got invited to dinner. Well, actually, I walked by his table a few times, craned my head to see what he was doing and dropped a tracking device into his bag. And, I'm a Sox fan! Did I say that out loud?

The weather was pretty shitty, which is to say that this place was chock full of locals and tourists alike, trying to stay out of the cold and blowing snow.  But their vast availability of tables made our wait no longer than 10 minutes. Service was speedy.  Our order came out of the kitchen in about 15 minutes.  Our waiter even agreed to refill my velvety hot chocolate for free.  (A small measure of commiseration, I suppose). Being from San Francisco, where brunch will often set you back $20, it was a refreshing change of pace to get an enormous plate of food for $9.95.  Actually, there were TWO plates.  My frittata also came with a ""side"" of pancakes.  How great is that?

They do have a billion options, which I think is awesome, especially when that includes the hard-to-find griddle 'n eggs combos (pancakes and eggs, waffles and eggs, crepes(!) and eggs, etc.) that are so hard to find at bistro-y brunch places.  And MY GOD do they feed you.  While waiting 20 minutes for a table for two, I can confidently say that 90% of parties walked out with doggie bags.  But after being seated, it was...meh, ok.

I will also say that on a packed Sunday morning, service was quick and attentive, and the coffee was good and hot.  Our bill came out to be around $10 per person excluding tax and tip, so for what they give us, the price was right.

The place very crowded, so we agreed to sit at the counter.  The service was great.  My friend had the Green Eggs & Ham (egg & pesto omlette) and I had the French Toast Combo (french toast, eggs, bacon).  The food was pretty good, but nothing out of the ordinary.   I could've gone to a regular 'ole diner and saved a few bucks and some wait time.",0.9668,0.816,0.184,0.0,0.41165501165501156

I had the 2 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, 2 pancakes plate, what most other local diners call ""dueces wild.""  I hadn't been to Yolk before despite only living a block away, so I thought I'd start with the basics to see how they were.  The pancakes were decent pancakes, which was a good start.  The eggs, which I ordered sunny side up, were still runny yolked, which is good.  The sausages were typical breakfast sausages, which I think are boring, bland and not something I'd order on their own in general, and Yolk's version were pretty much no better. Then the bacon - I don't quite understand the obsession with thick-cut bacon.  The pleasure of bacon should be that you get a nice crisp sensation followed by the salty, smoky bacon fat melting in your mouth with minimal (preferrably no) chewing required.  Thick-cut bacon is like eating an overcooked pieces of ham. Anyway, nothing they cooked was bad relative to what I'd expect of any diner, but nothing surprised me, either.  Fair enough.  Service was quick and friendly, which is a diner requirement. I do have one real complaint, though: Price.  I think it's excessive to have a glass of juice, a cup of coffee and ""dueces wild"" cost $16.50 with tip.  I didn't think their food was $5 better than the same order at the Howard Johnson diner a block away, where you can get that same lineup for about $11.50, tax and tip included. If I ever go back, which is unlikely not only because of the prices, but also because I only eat breakfast out about twice a year, maybe I'll try something fancier - then again, which Orange opening up a location just two blocks over on Clark later this month, Yolk is going to have even more stiff competition soon. Actually, what this area lacks is a good late-night diner.  The closest one I know of is Tempo, which is a 10 minute walk.",0.9686,0.853,0.107,0.04,0.5363475177304964

2009-11-12,5.0,"Yesterday was my friend Casey's 35th birthday.  I told I would treat her to lunch anywhere she wanted to go and she chose Yolk.  I've been before (to the other locale) but she hadn't but was sold when she saw the menu and read that they were voted best Egg Benedict.  She is a HUGE fan of Egg Ben edicts, it's her favorite go-to when we hit up a restaurant for brunch.  I was able to get to the restaurant a few minutes before Casey and told our very lovely, competent waitress Steph that it was Casey's birthday and could she please stick a candle in whatever Casey ordered.  Steph had a better idea and said that she could bring out a dessert crepe for Casey after her meal.  Thanks Steph for thinking of that!!!  Anyway, Casey arrived and chose to order the the South of the Border Benny.  It had chorizo and chipotle sauce topped with two poached eggs and Yolk's homemade hollandaise sauce.  Her meal also came with their delicious, lightly seasoned potatoes and fresh fruit.  And when I see fresh fruit I mean large slices of oranges, pineapple, strawberries and melon.  All the good stuff in large chunky portions.  Casey, being the Benny expert said it was indeed the best she's ever had and can't wait to go back and try all the others on the menu.  In honor of Casey's birthday I decided to forgo my usual egg white veggie omelet and instead ordered the ""Cajun shroom scrambler"".  It consisted of a grilled portabella mushroom topped with eggs (or egg whites in my case) and seasoned veggies.  Instead of potatoes I got a side of multi-grain pancakes.  Two huge pancakes I might add!  Everything was amazing and we both cleaned our plates.  After our meal was over Steph brought out the nutella, strawberry crepe as promised.  The funny thing was, although she stuck a candle in it, she didn't light it.  Casey and I still haven't figured out why but none the less Casey was surprised and touched and it was an excellent birthday brunch!",0.9982,0.771,0.223,0.006,0.5434325396825398

And brunch is about your company and recounting stories from the night before, so if you don't like your company, the food can't make up for it.

I got the Eggs Benedict (the one with the chorizo sausage).

Lastly, my husband got the Huevos Rancheros (and even he, a man with limited taste buds complained that it was flavorless). The plus, our waitress was awesome and our food came out within 10-15 minutes of ordering.

All this was $7.99.  I ordered turkey sausage, onions and zucchini with wheat toast. My scrambler combo was good. Eggs were a little more runny than I'd prefer, and there were more potatoes than my scrambler mix. I didn't finish my meal, but our lovely server offered me a small container for leftovers. Service was surprisingly fast.

As soon as you walk in the doors of Yolk, you are greeted by the bright colors of Yellow & Blue.  They sort of scream ""good morning"" & kind of put you in a happy place (or else you just feel like you are at Ikea).  You also see the bakery display, it is not large, but definitely has some tempting treats--why hello large gooey cinnamon roll--let's have a date later.  Then you encounter the host--who happily seats you.  I find entering the place has already merited it favor since I like happy colors, lovely baked goods, and nice hosts.

Why 4 stars & not 5 you ask?  Well, I do like them a ton, but they are some missteps as well.  Their crepes for one are way too sweet for what they offer in them.  On one visit I ordered a crepe with savory items in it & it was a very unpleasant experience.  The crepe was way too sweet & ruined the other ingredients it contained.  Also, their banana bread french toast tastes slightly off to me, but that is a matter of perspective.   All in all, I like Yolk & will be coming here often.",0.9967,0.712,0.228,0.06,0.554023368606702

It was only okay, and she seemed ultra annoyed that i asked again and complained like 3 times. 2 of my friends shared a skillet which looked gross, and my other friend got cinnamon roll french toast i believe. She is a tiny girl and usually only eats about half of her meal and she at the entire thing, the portion size pretty darn small.The funny part about it was that the waitress said it was a huge portion.

Plus cooking eggs grosses me out, and sometimes I'm grateful just to have someone else do it for me. I of course ordered cheap & meatless: two eggs with baby reds and pancakes for $6. I tend to binge on brunch, but my meal divided perfectly in two, making some filling leftovers. Dining companion got the crunch berry oatmeal and a side of turkey links, for about $10. There was a hair on the plate under the turkey links, but as it wasn't incorporated INTO the food in any way, she ignored it and I did not judge. Crunch berry oatmeal came with cream and brown sugar, a handful of raisined granola between handfuls of black and blueberries.  Coffee prices weren't on the menu, but given that a glass of orange juice ran you $3, we stuck with the water. 20 minute wait for a table for 2 on Saturday just before noon; the host was fantastic with crowd control and expediting. Server was a cute smile-and-wink type who gave us an appropriate amount of face time. And the food came out quickly. The Ikea look worked for me-- after all, get too cozy and I just might go back to sleep...",0.9209,0.901,0.073,0.026,0.6075757575757575
2009-07-25,5.0,"I didn't know what I was missing until Yolk showed up in my neighborhood. For 5 years, my rotation of breakfast spots included the Pancake House off Rush, Tempo (across the street), and the occasional haul down to Lou Mitchell's. Well, I'll to you, Yolk puts all these Chicago standards to shame. I've been here a few times and returned to Pancake House once only to be mightily disappointed at the sad-looking eggs and miniature pancakes sitting on my plate.  First of all, I like the space, especially if you can get one of the booths. The waitstaff is very good - friendly and attentive (how good do you have to be - it's breakfast!).  Now to the food: I've tried the eggs benedict, which is excellent (Almost as good as the CBOT's eggs benny), a veggie omelette - I could not believe how fresh the vegetables were, and Popeye's fritatta, also very good. The portions are large, which you always want for breakfast and everything is tasty. I love that you have a choice of pancakes as a side instead of toast. You get two huge pancakes which are three times the size of Pancake House's and taste better. Yeah, I said it. And that place is called the Pancake House.  I'm looking forward to trying lunch, or just going back to try some of the other interesting-looking breakfast dishes. Oh yeah, I don't know what kind of coffee they serve, but that was good too.  I don't really understand some of the negative reviews (did we go to the same restaurant?) because Yolk is terrific and makes me wish I had lived in the South Loop the past few years. Instead, I have to look out my window and see the lines of vultures form at the always-mediocre Tempo Cafe.",0.9579,0.828,0.124,0.048,0.5228597883597883

I hoped you would be the Peaches to my Herb with your vast selection. The menu is enormous and offers every option under the sun, I've given a good sampling of a go around and all of it has left me feeling uninspired yet ridiculously stuffed. Now if you enjoy mediocrity and the allowance to over consume to start your day, then have at it. Otherwise steer clear and head for the Breakfast Club in West Town where you can experience a similar menu and your wallet will thank you later.  Over our trips we have been tempted with pancakes which where limp and dry (dusted with powdered sugar-I suppose for the Wow factor.) Omelettes which had overcooked eggs and sauteed vegetables that were so undercooked they left me thinking were they just pulled from the ground and sprayed with Pam? and Corned Beef and Hash that was so bland and soft (even after I asked for the potatoes to be cooked EXTRA CRISPY.)  The service is shoddy (unless you sit at the bar) and it is too loud to hear yourself think (warning-do not go with a hangover).

2009-07-09,4.0,"I felt a little taken aback when I first walked into Yolk. First, there aren't a ton of brunch places in River North (at least not that I'm aware of) so I was excited to try this place out. Secondly, as soon as we walked in we were asked by the melancholy hostess ""Two?"" and then before I could answer, the manager was there and almost yelled, ""TWO?!?"" I felt like I was at boot-camp. Thirdly, the space is huge and looks like you just stepped into IKEA; the decor is kind of cold and all yellow and blue.  We were seated immediately (very rare for Sunday brunch) in a little booth for two...I think those are pretty darn cute. The menu is awesome and I had a tough time picking what I wanted to eat. I went with the Iron Man minus the mushrooms, I really don't like mushrooms. They brought us our food very quickly, and my omelette unfortunately had mushrooms. I'm not one of those bitchy customers who flips out when my order is wrong unless I am starving and need to be fed, luckily I was in no rush. The waitress was so cool and apologetic that even if I was pissed, she would have made it all better. It took them awhile to remake it but when it arrived it was massive and yummy. I got it with their potatoes, english muffin (like a real one, not the store bought kind), and coffee (they were more than happy to bring me skim milk on the side which I love) which were all delicious.  Yolk is a place I would definitely try again. Huge pluses are the no wait, large space with diverse crowd (yuppies, families, tourists), and a fabulous menu. I also have to say that what really sold me on this place was our kick-ass waitress, when you have great service your chances of hooking me as a customer go way up.",0.9908,0.787,0.161,0.052,0.6027293844367014

We decided to take the short walk over and found it easily as there was a small crowd waiting outside for their table.  The interior is very clean, modern, and bright. At first glance, the place didn't look very big, but as you walk towards the back, it opened up to another seating area behind the bar. There are 2 - 4 people booths along the wall, tables in the middle, as well as counter seating.  We were there on a Sun around 10:45AM and were excited to hear that the wait was only 10-15 mins. After being seated at the counter, we opened the menu, without any expectations, and were surprised to find the amount of items on the menu. There was everything from breakfast to sandwiches, burgers, and salads.  I ordered a Veggie Skillet with turkey sausage and my companion had the Irish Benny. The Veggie Skillet was delicious with the veggies being very fresh and crisp. Nothing was over cooked and enough food to be full for a whole day! The Irish Benny was delicious as well with corned beef hash instead of the canadian bacon on a regular eggs benedict. It holladise sauce had a slight kick to it which made it all that much better.  All in all, I'm glad that this place opened in the neighborhood and is a short walk from home. At the same time, I'm not sure if it's worth the trip for those in other neighborhoods.

Arriving right at 9am on 4th of July, the place was slightly busy but not packed at all, plenty of empties.  We got seated right away, which was nice, but upon actually sitting down realized we were at a not-so-clean table: $5 tip was still on the table, along with dribbles of coffee and folded up sugar packet wrapper from the booth's previous occupant. Our waitress came over and we advised her we needed (at least) a wipe down, and she did so right away.  Great. She poured our coffee, and then I turned to realize we were out of creamer.  Also, out of any real sugar.  She corrected this as well. We ordered our breakfast, and I chose to have egg-whites with mine, perhaps a mistake at a place called Yolk.   The breakfast order arrived in 5 minutes, maybe even less. The egg whites can only be described as a small massacre on a plate.  A mess of folds...it looked like about 4-5 egg whites...craziness.   Pancakes were COLD, both mine and the hubby's. We sent the pancakes back and got replacements which were actually piping hot.  Clearly they are pre-making pancakes for expected orders.  I asked and was told they are not, but there is no other explanation for why my food which had only been ordered 5 minutes prior, came with cold cakes. I left the eggs behind and just had pancakes + breakfast meat, which was fine by me.   Our waitress took our coffees off the bill for our multiple troubles, but if you ask me, those eggs should have been deleted as well.   Ultimately, the food had promise (except for those awful eggs), but this place has a long way to go to match the breakfast perfection that is the original location.",0.9635,0.834,0.112,0.054,0.5109381359381359

I feel as if I am eating in some sort of new-age brunching factory. Stainless steel + brunch just doesn't quite sit well with me...then again, neither does a mushy California omelette. Word to the wise, ask for the avocado on top/side, as when its baked into an egg creation, nastiness ensues.  The fresh fruit that dated my omelette during its time on earth was fresh and void of filler fruit (oh how I detest green melon), and the ""light 'n thin"" crepes with blueberries and strawberries we ordered for the table were adequate. (not stellar, but is anything ""light"" ever REALLy stellar? No, methinks not). English muffin was standard, and fresh jam would've been delightful (packaged jelly is so...Big Boy circa childhood). All around, the consensus was A-OK, but not blown away.  Otherwise? On point. Coffee was strong and fast, with appropriate fixings at the table (however, I do prefer fresh cream, not the little packets...just an added touch that is important in the morning ""wake-the-hell-up"" regimen).
