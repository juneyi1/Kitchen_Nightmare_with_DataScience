2017-09-03,4.0,"Let me start by saying Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba has some good   Paella!! Like really really good! I was in Chicago and needed to find somewhere for my family and I to eat so what better place than to look on than ole faithful.. Yelp! I really enjoy tapas so I typed in tapas and Chicago and Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba popped up. We were staying approximately 45 minutes away. Something told me to call and see if they were packed seeing all the reviews that had been posted, I could tell they were a popular spot. Good thing I did because the wait was 1.5 hours. However, they do call ahead seating. This was great and they put our name on the list. When we got there we walked in, checked in and a nice couple was leaving the first come tables in the bar. The girl walked over to us and asked us to follow her so we could have their table. How cool was that, no wait! The server we had was very nice and helpful on what to order.  BREAD - Ok. Honestly nothing special. It had a slight jalapeño taste by I didn't see any jalapeños so I'm not sure. It was typical bread that you get from any restaurant.  SPICY POTATOES WITH TOMATO ALIOLI - Very Good! These potatoes and Alioli had a great taste. The potatoes were just typical cut up chunks of potatoes and slightly seasoned with a little spices. The Alioli is what makes this dish. It is very good and adds the perfect flavors. An overall good dish! ROASTED CHICKEN EMPANADA - Good. This empanada was pretty decent. It wasn't as good as other empanada places I have been to but it wasn't horrible. The shell was a little different than most we have tried. It was more of a flaky crust rather than a pie shell type of crust. The filling was good. It was seasoned and the chicken was nice and tender. It also came with a cream sauce that added another little pinch of flavor. SPINACH & MANCHEGO-STUFFED MUSHROOMS - Meh! Honestly this dish was not anything special. It was mushrooms with sauce, spinach, a little cheese on top and bread crumbs. The flavors/ingredients didn't really go together or flow. It honestly just tasted like mushrooms and cream sauce. Nothing special and my husband who loves mushrooms wasn't even crazy about them. It honestly just lacked in flavor.  GRILLED OCTOPUS - Very Good! This dish consisted of grilled octopus, heirloom tomatoes, crispy chickepeas, roasted garlic, arugula, and garlic-chili vinaigrette. This dish was very good! I have had plenty of octopus from restaurants and this place is on the top list. The octopus was cooked perfect, nice and tender. It wasn't very chewy and had a good flavor. All of the side ingredients helped make the dish come together and added more depth of flavor. PAELLA VALENCIANA (Pork Paella) - AWESOME! This dish was amaze balls!! I loved this dish! It consisted of confit pork shoulder, crispy pork belly, chorizo ibérico & chicharrónes. My husband and I usually don't eat a lot of pork but for whatever reason we decided to try it. I'm so glad we did. It was packed full of flavor and all the meats were so tender and flavorful. All the ingredients were a nice balance of flavor. I didn't try the other paella dishes however I can definitely vouch for this one! TRY IT!  Overall, we had a really good experience at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba and the food was good as well. I would definitely come back and recommend them for others to try.",0.9991,0.76,0.22,0.02,0.6304144620811287

2017-09-01,4.0,"5 stars for the food! Hands down, the food is amazing! We did not have a single bite that wasn't delicious. We've ordered the tuna special: raw tuna, which was very delicate and fresh. The lamb special with a warm puree underneath was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing. We've also ordered the shishito peppers, which are really hard to find, but they were chargrilled to perfection and served with a little salt on top: so good. The dates wrapped in bacon are a classic, and it did taste just like I remember it from Spain. While we were pretty full after that we still decided to order desserts, and they were just the perfect size: the flan was the right texture and tasted really good, but my favorite was the cheesecake, which reminded me of the way my mom would make it, with quark, instead of cream cheese. It was soo good I wish I had a whole pie of this cheesecake. While the food was outstanding, I would not recommend the drinks. Maybe the bartender had a bad that, but the strawberry basil caipirinha tasted pretty bad.  Plus, we were seated at the very end of the restaurant, in what felt like a private room where a party of 15 people or so took up almost the entire room, and we were sitting in the same room with them, next to a hallway that was separated by a curtain.

It was 3 huge pieces of lettuce with 2 big pieces of tomato and then some green dressing. The cucumbers and onions in it looked old and dried out (9 dollars). The charcuterie was terrible. The only good thing we're the side cup of olives. The meats had funky flavors, the bruschetta was on hard stale bread and not appetizing. The cheese was not good and only came with 3 tiny thin slices. (20 dollars!!!). The chicken empanada only came with one, it was the better of the three. (6.50).

I typically prefer white sangrias but love the red one here. My bf and I once finished a pitcher between the two of us... what a great start of the night. The seasonal offerings are usually quite nice too; I particularly liked the apple cider one. Tapas menu is pretty big. My constant favorites include the bacon wrapped dates (it's on the restaurant yelp profile picture... so get it), patatas bravas, baked goat cheese, short rib, scallops, and seafood paella.

I give her extra props for dealing with our loud and scattered crew of 12.  SANGRIA: Delicious, authentic. Not too sugary. We ordered a few of these.  TAPAS: My favs out of the vegetarian options: Moroccan stew was very flavorful. Spicy yet sweet from the yellow raisins. Unique.  The potato and onion omelette was delicious. Warm, fluffy, savory. The egg puffs it up, but wishing there was a little more flavor. It would be nice to have a jam pairing in addition to the aioli.  Stuffed Mushrooms were hearty and flavorful.  Goat Cheese in tomato sauce  Codfish croquette was delicious, as was the cheese with jam Squid was well-cooked and buttery, but I wouldn't pair it with the arugula.  PAELLA: We ended up trying the seafood, pork and chicken paellas. I personally thought it was slightly salty, but I'm not a huge paella expert though, so I wouldn't trust my review. Get slightly fewer servings than the # of people you have if you are trying to purchase other menu items.  DESSERT: We tried every single dessert.

I am not the biggest fan of taps but how can you not love ordering and trying almost everything on the menu wish dishes coming to your table every 5 minutes. Combine the mass amounts of food with Sangria, and your result is a lot of happy customers on a Friday night! Dare me to say it but Cafe Ba Ba Reba might fall in my Top-10 list of favorite Chicago restaurants. Located in Lincoln Park off oh Halsted Street for the last 35 years, Ba Ba Reeba paved the way for a popular row of restaurants, mainly all Lettuce Entertain You, on Halsted St in Lincoln Park. My very smart girlfriend knew that this would be a great restaurant for a larger group (8 of us) to sit at a round table and enjoy a lot of the Tapas. I previously mentioned that I wanted to go here but she said wait for a special occasion with a larger group. Of course she was spot on with this decision as we enjoyed her Birthday dinner @Ba Ba Reeba last night.  I know that I have already mentioned this a few times but it is fun to go to a Tapas restaurant with a large group because you get to enjoy so many dishes. I want to highlight A handful of my favorite dishes from the meal last night. I would definitely say the Patatas Bravas, Shrimp with garlic sauce was excellent, the Burrata was super soft and sweet, the short rib which was melt in your mouth good and the Brussel sprouts salad was stellar too!! I also really enjoyed the sangria as we got a pitcher of blackberry sangria. On top of excellent food, we dined at a round table next to the window facing Halsted white and enjoyed the beautiful night in Chicago. The service was also top notch as our Waiter was super quick and the Manager made this is a very special night too. I would only think that this restaurant does extremely well financially because of its size, speed of distributing dishes, quality of food, and maintaining and even improving their quality reputation over the last 35 years.

Favs:  Chicken & Ham Croquetas, bacon wrapped dates, Buttermilk-Fried Chicken Thighs, Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Alioli, Grilled Ibérico Pork -Chicken & ham croquetas are one of my favorite things here. Delicious and creamy and fried!  -They have bacon wrapped dates and also something in the Pintxos section called ""Chorizo-Wrapped Medjool Date & Cheese"". The bacon wrapped dates come with more dates and just leave out the cheese. The bacon wrapped dates plate tastes better and you get more!  -The chicken thighs are so yummy. The piri piri sauce tastes similar to buffalo sauce.  -The potatoes are simple but delicious. Not a must-order, but pretty good.  -The pork melts in your mouth! It's perfect.  -The butterscotch custard is one of the BEST desserts I've had in Chicago. It's a small portion so you don't even feel guilty afterwards.  Mehs: Goat Cheese Baked in Tomato Sauce, chicken empanada, Grilled Hanger Steak, the seafood paella!  -Goat cheese in tomato sauce is nothing special. It's yummy, but nothing special.  -Grilled hanger steak is kind of bland. It's cooked well, but it's lacking a bit in flavor.  -Chicken empanada is small and is nothing special. -The seafood paella tastes like fried rice. It's too salty and kind of dry. The seafood flavor isn't incorporated into the paella like it's supposed to be, it feels like they made the rice separately and threw the seafood on top. There are a good number of clams though, so at least they didn't skimp.  Overall a fun place to go with big groups so you can try more items. Also a great place for (first) dates! Go without a reservation and you will be forced to hang out at the bar until your table is ready, not a bad thing if you're trying to get to know someone.

I came to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba with a couple of friends. We got a pitcher of sangria which unfortunately I did not try (had some work to finish later that night! :( ) for our group, which serves around 6-7 drinks per $16 pitcher. I tried several of the tapas/pinxtos. Out of the pinxtos, I only got the chorizo with pepper: not bad, good flavor and texture. Out of the tapas, meatballs: only 2 per serving. tasty, but tiny portions and tasted like something you could probably make at home. Chicken/ham croquetas: DELICIOUS, great texture and the dipping sauce was great as well. Beef empanada: the flakiness of the crust was amazing. the empanada was a decent size as well. Overall, the portions are pretty small, but I guess that's to be expected for $1-$3.50 tapas. I left feeling a little less full than I expected I'd be. The service was one of the lows of my experience here. Maybe it was because we were sitting near the back of the bar, but I'd still expect better service given that when we arrived, the place was relatively empty. We had to hail the bartender several times to get his attention to order more food, and often it felt like he was ignoring us. The wait times on our orders were decent, so no major complaints there. One of us checked in on yelp to claim the free dessert, and not the initial bill, but the bill that was handed to us to sign, had that dessert on the bill (charged to us). We noticed the bill discrepancy, and it was only after we asked our bartender that he changed this for us.  I came to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba having heard a lot of hype over this place, but my expectations were definitely not met.

For food, you must try bacon wrapped dates. Tastes like heaven ! My friend dislikes anything sweet, but she really enjoys this dish. The heat maximizes the sweetness and softness of dates, while the crispy grilled bacon adds some salt to this dish. Grilled pork is a bit over medium this time. But still the quality of meat saves everything.  Grilled squid is so tender, as I almost doubt it is served directly from the market without cooking.  We also try garlic shrimp, spicy potato, friend chicken, citrus cured salmon, They all worth you to have a try.,  The only dish I dislike is beef empanada. Too dry and too plain.  For dessert, chocolate truffle cake is quite amazing. You can taste rich chocolate flavor, but not over sweet at all. Small bite, but enough for dessert.

I know we ordered more but this is what I remember the most. The tapas were a generous portion, hot and incredibly delicious.

To start off with, I got the pinxto platter, and I was such a fan of the Bacalao Croquette and the Deviled Egg. For our tapas plates, as there was only two of us, we got 4-one from each of the sections. We got the spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms, moroccan spiced lamb kebabs, seared sea scallops, and the chicken and ham croquetas. I was a fan of all of them, especially the croquetas and scallops. The croquetas practically melted in your mouth, and the scallops were just the right consistency.  The only thing I will say is that they were sending our dishes out super fast at the beginning, and then we waited about 20 minutes for simply our scallops.

Yes its trendy, popular, crowded and over run by Lululemon/Kate Spade types but its still So Freaking Amazing.  My recommendation to anyone visiting for the first time is try the specials (off menu/verbal specials) and drink sangria by the pitcher. On my last visit to Baba Reeba my girlfriend and I got a cute table near the kitchen and went to town ordering. We each got one dish just for ourselves, she had the hanger steak and gave it a 10/10 and I had the raw tuna with jalapenos and it was also diving 10/10. To share we had a half pitcher of both the passion fruit and peach sangria, we both feel that the passion fruit is a more fruit forward  sangria and better pairs with the menu. In addition we split the burrata, spicy potatoes, bacon wrapped dates, and pan seared peppers. Every bite of every dish surpassed expectation.  Its easy to over order here so i would suggest buying 2-2.5 plates per person.

( some tables are even communal with dividers)  Food: tapas style ( small plate portions ) with endless flavors and options to chose from. Lots  of vegetarian, cheese and meat options.  Here's some of my favorite, that I think personally are worth ordering:  SPICY POTATOES WITH ALIOLI: crispy with a slight hint of spice makes these dangerous addictive  SPINACH AND MACHEGO STUFFED MUSHROOMS: CHICKEN EMPANADAS: warm, fresh and the chicken inside is perfectly seasoned  FRIED CALAMARI:  MEAT BALLS:  BACON WRAPPED DATES: Not sure who discovered this divine combination of sweet and salty combination. But the bacon is crisp to perfection.  Plates are shareable. Highly advice ordering multiple different stuff to try amongst your group because everything was amazing.

This restaurant is has a very unassuming outward appearance but inside the place is huge, always packed and quite loud.  The parking across the street is free; the parking in front of the restaurant is usually available but is metered.  The food is great - especially the paella.  Order the seafood paella immediately when the waiter comes to the table - it takes 40 minutes for them to prepare it, so you want them cooking it while you decide on everything else.  We had four people and a 2-serving paella plus 7 tapas was too much for us.  6 tapas probably would've worked. We had: - Paella - Amazing, aromatic and delicious. - Stuffed mushrooms - These were very good, really liked the melted manchego - Catalan bread - Simple but quite authentic and typical of Spanish tapas - Short rib - Didn't actually think much of this.  It's a meat and potatoes dish with nothing special. - Empanada - Not Spanish but it tasted good. - Octopus - This was probably my favorite dish of the night.  Loved the mix of flavors. - Chicken and Ham Croquetas - These were cooked well, not over-fried. - Potato and onion omelette - Somewhat overcooked, it was fine but not amazing.

2017-05-11,4.0,"This was my first time visit, and as soon as I entered the room, someone was there to greet you. They were very busy on a Wednesday night. We had a reservation so we didn't wait long but if you don't, the wait was an hour and a half. You can stay by the bar area until your table is available.  We ordered different tapas. I loved the beef empanada, grilled steak, and garlic shrimp. Some were very salty like the squid. I didn't realize that it takes a long time for the paella to come, which was unfortunate because by the time it was out, I was full. I ate a little bit of it, but I found it really salty. I added lemons to mine and it was palatable after that. The acidity from the lemons muted that saltiness of the dish.  it was my friend's birthday and the server was so sweet! There was a dessert sampler, and that was amazing. The flavors were rich and not overly sweet. We also had a white sangria, which I LOVED.  I would come back here again for the tapas but steer away from the paella. I would love to try other dishes since there's many options!",0.9938,0.776,0.206,0.017,0.48978260869565227

The sangria is obviously a go-to, and I have liked almost all the flavors I've tried.  My least favorite thing I've had here is the paella.

I've loved this place since my sister took me 10 years ago when she lived in Chicago, and I have to say my heart broke a little when I found out there is one in Las Vegas the week after visiting. Seriously, this place is so good it may be the answer to world peace.  I've never had a single dish that is bad and this trip was no different. Definitely try to more traditional tapas - tortilla espanola, croquetas, patatas bravas, pulpo... it's making my mouth water just to think about it! My husband and I also shared 1/2 pitcher of the pomegranate sangria that was a feature and it was phenomenal. 1/2 pitcher was about 3 glasses each as they are short glasses. A couple glasses of sangria and some tortilla and you'll feel as though you've been transported to a bar in Puerto del Sol.

I really think this place is a solid 3.5, but rounding up, because I think rounding down is just mean. I think this is a solid option if you need to go somewhere with a large group of people. There aren't that many tapas-style restaurants in Chicago, and this is usually one that is generally a crowd pleaser. The Bacon-Wrapped Dates, Brussel Sprouts, and Goat Cheese are my favorites on the menu. The menu is GIANT though, so I think you will be hard-pressed to find something you won't like. Especially if you go for brunch, because you can order off both the brunch and dinner menu. This restaurant is certainly not a destination in my mind, but it does the trick if you need to go somewhere with a lot of people, and you might have some picky eaters in the crowd. The Paella is absolutely a pass though. I've tried it multiple times, and never liked it.

We found our table and immediately were presented with a basket of rustic bread- crusty outside, soft inside. And that was just the bread, friends. First order of real business was ordering sangria. I'm not one for sweet drinks, so we went with the Cava variety. It was pretty good. Still a little sweet, but not bad. We ordered a whole pitcher for 2 people (ambitious, I know).

We followed the server's advice and fried an egg the next morning to put over the left over paella which was a great mid morning snack. We also ordered two sangria pitchers which were both very good. I really liked that they added vodka to the sangria to give it that extra kick. The only advice I'd give regarding the pitchers would be to bump it up with some better fruit than apple.

When we walked up to this eatery it was packed inside.  There were people in front of us who said ""This place is always packed"", let me tell you, I can see why!!!   I came to this place many years ago on a very lame blind date and although the date sucked to high hell the food was great then and it is still great now, true love doesn't die LOL!.  That being said on to the love/yum fest:   #43 Octopus With Shishito peppers, charred romescu, smoker fingerlings and pearl onions=  I give this one an A+!!  And please forgive me for being so excited about this dish that I started stuffing my face before taking a photo of it.  But take my word, it was great.  There are so many amateur chefs out here who don't know how to cook Octopus but not here, it was done to perfection and the integration of all of the other ingredients makes this a master piece. #51 Rioja-braised short rib, manchego mashed potatoes, roasted vegetable and rioja wine glaze = A+++  Meat so moist and full of flavor that it just melts in your mouth.  These chefs here have mad skills.  If you follow any of my other reviews you know of my constant complaints of some of these people out here who cook meat so poorly, where it is so dry and tough that it is like chewing on a leather bag or what I like to call ""meat gum""!  Not here my friends, not here.  Everything at Cafe Ba-Ba is done to perfection.  They should open up a chef school and teach some of these other places how it's done.  And the glaze and the veggies on the plate were superb.    #63 Chicken and Ham Croquetas = A+++++   Another winner. I think Cafe Ba Ba is the first establishment that I have ever given As out on every single dish, I guess that makes them the valedictorian of restaurants. I should also add that the service was also good.   We sat at the bar and even though the bartender was super busy he still gave good service.  I was driving so he made me a Virgin Sangria that was also, you guessed it, A+++.

The chocolate truffle cake is also good, but nothing special about it, and the pomegranate sorbet was waaay too sour. However, it's a great place to hang out and have good conversations over a wide variety of dishes and sangria (plus the good service) so I'll be back again! Tips:  - Reservation is definitely recommended since Cafe Babareeba is almost always packed (yes, even on weekdays).   - If you check in here on Yelp you also get one free dessert tapas per PERSON. So... the more people you bring, the more dessert tapas you get ;D",0.9919,0.766,0.219,0.014,0.5888543823326432
2017-03-28,5.0,"5 stars for being my own personal brunch dream come true. I am a die hard fan of brunch, paella, tapas and sangria so this place obviously is right up my alley. Every single thing on the menu is excellent. Some tapas are bigger than other but you can always ask the server. For example, the sandwiches are much bigger than the tapas and Benedicts. The Pinxtos (one or two bites) are so clever, who doesn't face the classic dilemma of sweet or savory for brunch!? Well here, you can have it all! Including multiple sweet and savory. The paella definitely serves more than 2-3 as it claims. We had a party of 9 and didn't finish it (granted we all got one other thing plus some Pinxtos). We loved the seasonal sangria, Pomegranate and we downed it quick. Next we go the classic red sangria, and after ordering, we kind of regretted getting it for brunch, only because I think a lighter wine/sangria suits brunch better, but thats just all up to personal taste.  Personal top recommendations: White Wine, Rose or Sparkling Sangria of any type, Chicken Stick, Berry Waffles and Cubano!",0.9891,0.753,0.204,0.043,0.5049479166666667

2017-03-08,5.0,"Ba-ba-Reeba definition: being quick to deliver excitement There aren't very many tapas restaurants where I come from (and it's not in the middle of nowhere or the country). Simply put - tapas are not good in my hometown. I had a bad experience where they just plopped some pre-made stuff onto tiny plates and called that tapas. Upon stepping into this dimly lit place in Lincoln Park called Ba-Ba-Reeba (with a lunch reservation this time, I've finally figured you Chicagoans out!), we were seated right away in a snug but romantic corner near the back.  Frantically flipping through both sides of the menu we didn't know what to order since what we wanted wasn't on their menu. The night before, we compiled a list of numbers we wanted to order ahead of time. We were given a lunch and brunch menu, but all the numbers we chose weren't on there. Where's #41 - anchovies and #43 - the fried green peppers?!?! Rest assured our awesome server, Tim said anything goes if it's online. Now why in the world would they hide these delectable dishes? I'm sorry if anchovies and hot peppers offend you. Maybe that's why those numbers are invisible during lunch/brunch hours. The build your own bloody mary bar seemed interesting as you can put whatever skewer shit you want in there as the server gives you a shot a vodka. I saw a guy with like 6 skewers jammed in his cup! Where we were seated, I don't think I would've made it down the stairs, to the left, between all the tables, servers running around, just to get to the corner of the bar without falling after my BAC is probably above the legal limit in my state. I settled with the classic red sangria which wasn't too sweet, quite strong, and topped with fruit. It was tasty and I soon found out I felt buzzed, walking down a few steps to the women's bathroom which had 3 stalls, 1 sink, and I couldn't effing see anything in there let alone find the TP in the stall. The girls line was long when I came out. I'm assuming these girls had one too many drinks and needed to tinkle bad like me. Drunkness aside. The food was FANTASTIC imho. Anchovies topped with an olive tapenade paired well with the complimentary bread and evoo. Toasty catalan tomato bread topped with arugula and Manchego cheese triangles was delicious. The meatballs with sherry tomato sauce was simply divine as I sopped up the sauce with bread. If you go, the charcuterie plate (plato de la casa) is a must if you're a cured meat lover. We also ordered a breakfast paella which took about 30 minutes and was served sizzling hot table side. Well worth the wait. The bomba rice was perfectly cooked and I loved the crispy rice bits. The bill for 2 was about $100 w/tips, but we dined like a king and queen. Was Ba-ba Reeba quick to deliver excitement? I believe so, as I felt like a giddy kid in a candy store drooling, but in this case, over to-die-for sangria, tapas, and paella. This is redemption for having fake tapas in the past.",0.9961,0.773,0.159,0.068,0.5364066193853428
2017-03-07,3.0,"Vegetarian review--We didn't get the paella, so if I had maybe I'd have been happier. We weren't too impressed. And I was disappointed because it's been around so long and I felt like the only one left who hadn't been there yet. I have to say, when I ordered the roasted peppers I  didn't expect to just get literally 8 little peppers, roasted. That's it. $6. Seriously. No sauce or even 1 other thing on the plate. That was a condiment, not a dish. The garlic potato salad was ok, but isn't that American grocery store stuff? I only ordered it because I ran out of choices. Didn't say ""Spain"" to me. The waiter said paella takes 45 minutes...so after the first round its too late for that. Wish i knew that...45 minutes!!! Really? So people wait 45 minutes for a meal here? I was starving still after about 5 shared dishes that were sooo small, so I ordered the omlet. Two of them. They were huge and it was toward the end of the meal...I didn't want an omlet for dinner, but after trying pretty much the whole veggie section, they were they same price as the meat items and there was not enough food. Why on earth would there be an omlet on the dinner menu? Chick pea stew was pretty good and a decent size. They need to get something with some substance on the veggie menu. And get rid of the omlet, it wasnt even very good. But at least it made me full. The good: spicy potatoes, the mushrooms and chick pea stew. The bad: roasted peppers, potato salad, omlet, brussel sprouts salad (no taste). The ugly: $50 each with tip and only getting full because of the omlet. Now, I've been to other tapas places, and they were amazing. This place IMO, is not much, at least for a vegetarian.",0.9759,0.814,0.124,0.062,0.5760648148148148

I haven't eaten a lot of their seemingly tasty food, but I'd like to share a few little known treats. Let's not forget that when you say tapas to a suburbanite, the consistent responses are Ba-Ba-Reeba and Cafe Iberico.    Firstly, come to the build your own bloody mary brunch on the weekends. Those who know me understand that I've had a rather fickle relationship with this much celebrated tomato based drink. Brunch, itself, is a meal that rather confounds me, but I've made my peace with the bloody after discovering the world of 'build your own.' Not arguing that the BYOBloody is the best in the city... it's simply a solid selection of side items such as kosher dill pickles, tasty bacon strips, olives and of course, celery. Zing Zang is the standard in bloody mixes, and they keep it pouring at Ba-Ba-Reeba.  The other interesting factoid about this well appointed spanish themed venue, is that they offer an unbeatable deal for New Years Day. If you show up in your pajamas on the first day of the year, they'll provide a gift card in the amount that you spent. My friends call it eating your bill.

The tapas we sampled were all well prepared and fresh and although fairly typical defiantly prepared to order. The service was nice and knowledgeable and kept the ball rolling on a busy nite. So if your in the mood for some tapas this old standby is still working like a fine oiled machine. Oh and make sure to checkin to receive a free dessert.,0.9871,0.769,0.217,0.014,0.5522675736961451

I preferred the peach over the berry sangria, however, both were extremely balanced flavors. I love that the sangria is on tap, too! If you don't have a reservation, the wait can be daunting.

2016-11-14,4.0,"I came here with a large group on a Thursday night, and this place was packed. There's a cute courtyard with outdoor seating near the front of the restaurant in addition to the large dining space inside. We started off with a couple of pitchers of the classic red sangria which was delicious and not overly sweet.  The best way to do tapas is gathering a bunch of hungry people together and basically ordering one (or four) items from each of the categories - veggies/cheeses, seafood, chicken/pork, beef/lamb. Some of the standouts for me were roast dates with bacon and burrata with bread and tomato marmalade. I'm a big fan of sweet/salty, and the flavors of both those dishes were richly complex. I also really liked the brussels sprouts salad, mixed greens salad, grilled squid, and the ham/chorizo plate. I could have done without the fried calamari or garlic potato salad, but I think other people liked it. We ended the meal with the caramelized banana and chocolate cake which were both SO good.  I'm giving this place four, not five stars because some of the dishes came out a little cold, and the fried calamari was on the soggy side. The atmosphere was also pretty loud and crazy for a weeknight dinner, but I guess that is to be expected at a tapas place.

I recommend making a reservation to ensure you get a table, as this place gets packed during peak hours and on weekends. I'm a fan of tapas, and Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba has some seriously good tapas. I highly recommend the bacon-wrapped dates, the sherry-tomato meatballs, and the garlic-red pepper shrimp! The candle-lit setting with its chatty ambiance and delicious smells from the kitchen make for a fun evening. We love the sangria options, and the sangria-of-the-day is neat since it's always something unique (desert pear, mango, blood orange, etc.). We've never had a server without a smile, and we've never left hungry. They also have a great Happy Hour at both bars from 4p-6p on weekdays and 10p-12a on Friday & Saturday that offers 1/2 price sangria and very, very discounted tapas dishes!  TIP: Join Lettuce Eats!

We didn't want to do anything extravagant as we were planning to celebrate another time on a weekend out of town. My Girlfriend was feeling like Tapas and where better to go than Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! according to the internet. Called ahead and was told there's a 45 minute wait, I asked if we could put our names in line as we were walking out the door and would be there within 20 minutes. The lady on the phone was nice, took my name and number down and said no problem. Arrived 20 minutes later, walked up and there was a gentleman waiting at the hostess area. Let him know I called ahead, he looked me up and said ""it'll be about an hour and 15 minutes."". I explained how I called ahead and what was said to which he said ""She meant 45 minutes to an hour sir."" We went back and forth a bit on this but he dismissed me and walked away as if he didn't have the time to listen to a customer on what another representative of his employer had said to a customer. So we waited.... An hour and half later I go back up and ask how much longer to which they said ""We texted you it was ready quite a bit ago."" To find out they texted the wrong number. They ""apologized"" and said they'd seat us next. We sat back down, right in front of the hostess table mind you and after 20 more minutes I asked again what the status was told yet again that they had texted me and hadn't heard from me. The lady repeated the number back to me and again they had it wrong (after 3 times of giving them numbers mind you). I even inquired as to ""why couldn't you just lean over the counter and say 'Sir we can seat you now. You saw me sitting there but relied on a text?' to which she blankly stared at me. I asked to speak to a manager, she walked away and after another 10 minutes of waiting my Girlfriend and I left. You may do some things right Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!

The chicken and waffles on a stick was also very tasty. The croquetas have a unique taste but were also good and you get four so you can share. Most items are between $2 and $8 so getting a wide variety together for a table can be done for a decent price. There are over 100 items to choose from though and so many things will look good so be careful. My only caution would be that most dishes were only shareable if you wanted a very literal taste of something.

2016-10-01,4.0,"Heard a lot of hype from Café Ba-Ba-Ree-ba but never really had an occasion to go here until yesterday, and was very pleasantly surprised after the experience. Not only because of the flavors and presentation of the food, but also because we surprisingly didn't break the budget doing it, spending around $20 per person(I was fully expecting to spend twice as much). First thing to note is that this place is gigantic. It has like 5 different rooms, two semi-floors, walls of bread and bundles of ham swinging from the ceiling. They really do try to capture the dim but bustling atmosphere of a restaurant in Barcelona, and in my opinion they do so fairly successfully. Ordered 7 tapas between 3 people, including the warm potato and onion omelette, spicy potatoes with tomato aioli, beef empanada, chicken and ham croquetas, buttermilk-fried chicken thighs, seared Spanish sausages, and skewered chicken + chorizo sausage. All the dishes were good, though my personal favorites were the potato dishes, the croquets, and the skewered Spanish sausages. The beef empanada was also good though for a single $6 empanada I would probably wait for happy hour. Speaking of which, they have a solid happy hour here, where their dishes are priced as they were when they first opened 30 years ago, meaning you essentially get 50% off a lot of their favorites(patatas bravas, empanadas, roast dates, chicken & ham croquetas, pintxos, etc.) along with $16 pitchers of Sangria. It's every day from 4pm-6pm, along with Friday sand Saturdays from 10pm-midnight as well, and you can definitely get full off of $10-15 or so if you come by around this time.  All in all tapas are never cheap, though with the right orders, along with plenty of complimentary bread and olive oil, you can actually get fairly full without breaking the bank. We averaged around $12/person on just food, and with drinks it just brought it a little higher, which is not bad at all. Also, they knew it was our first time there, so they even brought us out a trio of desserts, on the house, which was a great way to end the meal and start off the night. For that and their happy hour, they are definitely warrant another half star(4.5/5)",0.9973,0.827,0.173,0.0,0.5470833333333334

2016-09-19,4.0,"Came into Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! on a Sunday morning to sort of wind down a great long weekend in Chicago. This was on a long list of recommended brunch places our friends picked so we ended up choosing to come here and I'm very glad we did!  We got a table for six pretty easily around noon on Sunday. The layout of the restaurant is pretty fun and there are pretty deliberately sectioned off parts of the restaurant. We were ushered to the back right of the establishment. Just glancing at the menu I knew this was probably going to be a great brunch. That, and the fact that there is an ""!"" in the name of the restaurant makes me expect big things. The menu was big. Like reallllly big. There were breakfast/brunch options on one side, and then more lunch/dinner options on the other. Lots of dishes to choose from. We split three pitchers of sangria between the six of us throughout the brunch and it was delicious. We got the regular house red and the white peach. They don't put way too much ice in their pitchers like you see at some places, for which everyone was thankful. As for the food, you'd think with a menu so big, everything might be one note and taste the same. That's definitely what I was expecting going into it. That was not the case AT ALL. We probably sampled 12-14 dishes between the six of us and each dish was unique and had its own flavor. Some standouts for me: The Pan Catalan, bacon mac and cheese, bacon wrapped dates, and the patatas bravas. All of these were incredibly tasty, and something I'd recommend you NEEDING to get while you're there. I thinkt the patatas bravas was my favorite. I've had them done a dozen different ways by different Spanish restaurants, but the sauce they put on them here really stuck out to me. It had a nice spicy kick but wasn't too much for people who aren't a huge fan of spice. Just really well done. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the shrimp and grits and the paella. The shrimp and grits were a little bland and the paella I thought was just sort of ""Meh."" I'm not a huge paella fan so take that with a grain of salt. With all the dishes we had and the sangria, I'm pretty sure we all got out of there for less than $40 a person which was incredible considering we all had our fill of drink, and were stuffed to the brim with food. It's probably not the first place you think of when you hear ""authentic Spanish cuisine"" but it's pretty damn good. Only my second brunch in Chicago but I'd say if you're looking for some great food and sangria, this is your place.",0.9921,0.84,0.129,0.032,0.5519469419469418

2016-09-05,4.0,"I've been to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba a few times over the years, but it's fitting to review it now because it wasn't until recently that I noticed how sizable the space was. I've always sat towards the front of the restaurant and didn't pay that much attention...the tables are still small as heck though. Good thing that the servers are typically quick to pick up used plates because there's not a lot of room to place the various tapas that you will undoubtedly order.  As for the tapas itself, I can't think of a single one I've tried thus far that I didn't either like or love. What falls into my love category?  1. Baked goat cheese 2. Pretty much anything with chorizo in it 3. Last but certainly not least, the bacon wrapped dates. I don't even eat bacon, but I will if it's wrapped around those dates! I went for weekend brunch and you get to order from both the brunch menu and the regular one. Highly appreciated.  Price is reasonable but keep in mind, because these are small plates, and depending on the size of your party, it may take you quite a few to get satiated. In other words, don't be surprised if your bill falls into the $30-40 range. The one cost-effective tip I'll give you: if you have a party of 2-3, split a sangria pitcher, instead of going glass by glass. I split a pitcher of red with another person and felt like I got a whole lot of sangria out of that thing...definitely my money's worth.

The food has always been good here and I've always enjoyed their paella and sangria options, but note that you can easily surpass $30/person price point making it a $$$ experience rather than $$ as listed.  On our last visit here, we did the rioja-braised short rib, summer melon salad, buttermilk fried chicken with piri piri sauce, seared Spanish sausages, grilled octopus with potatoes and olives, & porky paella (pork shoulder pork belly, chorizo, & chicharrones). Overall a solid meal. If there were items I could live without, it would be the seared sausages and the buttermilk fried chicken. Sausages were good but nothing that really stood out for me and the buttermilk fried chicken was tasty but kind of out of place in my opinion for a Spanish tapas bar. My favorite was probably the braised short rib due to how tender and flavorful the meat was. The melon salad I really enjoyed the serranos and the smoked vinaigrette they used. The grilled octopus was good, but some of the pieces of octopus were had a bit too much char in my opinion. And lastly, for the pork paella... be ready for a mouthful of pork flavors and textures. Really good, but after a few bites I was definitely overwhelmed and needed to balance it out with other bites from the other dishes.

As a group of four, we ordered 6 different tapas along with the pork paella and also tried a few yummy tapas desserts. My favorites were definitely the bacon-wrapped dates, the short rib, and the goat cheese in tomato sauce. My friends also enjoyed the pumpkin empanada dish. The pork paella was also quite fantastic too - it contained pork belly, sausage, and pork chops. The desserts were also very delicious, with my favorite being the dark choclate crema in orange marmalade.

I was a little apprehensive about eating so late because that's not my usual style, but I think eating late and embracing the Spanish/European habit of eating late made the experience all the better. This was my first time here and I was amazed by the sheer size of the restaurant. There are so many different rooms that all have their own atmosphere. My friend and I were seated in one of the back rooms, so it was quiet and made for a really pleasant and private dining experience. Our waitress was really nice and attentive, and gave good recommendations. We ordered a half pitcher of the Classic Red sangria. It was delicious, and red wine is not usually my favorite. We really debated between the Classic Red and the seasonal special, which was white with mango. Next time. This is definitely a menu you have to approach with a plan. Because we were only two people, we wanted to maximize our plates, so we ordered one plate from each category: 32. Goat cheese baked in tomato sauce. 42. Grilled squid with olive oil & garlic. 51. Short rib with mashed potatoes. 58. Meatballs with sherry tomato sauce. They were all AMAZING. I wouldn't change what we ordered and I would order them again -- but first I would try everything else on the menu. I was seriously impressed. The meatballs came out first and they were the perfect start. When we finished the meatballs, we dipped the table bread in the sauce -- YUM! The squid, short rib, and goat cheese came out pretty quickly after that. The goat cheese was so fresh and creamy and the tomato sauce complemented the cheese very well. With the garlic bread that comes with the plate, these 3 make the perfect bite. Amazingly fresh and vibrant flavors. The squid was wonderful. I'm not used to having grilled squid and it was so refreshing to actually taste the flavor of the squid and not fried breading. The sauce was really light and made this dish a great choice for something lighter, especially compared to the short rib. The short rib was definitely the heaviest of the dishes and wasn't my favorite. The short rib had a great flavor but the mashed potatoes were kind of bland and eh (IMHO). The veggies that came with also weren't mind-blowing. I'd like to try the other meat choices. We also got a free dessert for being first-timers (so I got to save my check-in dessert for later!!!). After the richness of the meal, I probably should've opted for a lighter dessert choice, but I couldn't resist the chocolate truffle cake. It was deeeeelicious. Definitely super rich and maybe not the best choice after such a rich meal, but it was amazing. I would for sure order this again. Overall, an amazing dining experience.

Other things I tried: Goat cheese baked in tomato sauce: So I saw many people on here recommending this so I gave it a shot. Unfortunately, it didn't make my list of must-haves. It sort of reminded me of garlic bread dipped in Ragu spaghetti sauce, with a hint of goat cheese.  Grilled Hanger Steak: Maybe it was just me getting full, or maybe after eating the potatoes it made this dish taste a bit bland but these were just OK. It came drizzled with a green sauce and a side of chopped potatoes, which were delightful. Buttermilk Fried Chicken thighs: The crunch on these oh my. The outside of the chicken was perfect. Just the right consistency. Think buffalo wild wings but with more crunch. It was good, and it also came with a piri piri sauce but it didn't really taste like anything.

2016-07-11,5.0,"We had some friends visiting from New York City, so naturally we had to choose a place that would impress.... And Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba was it. Brunch is fantastic, but I LOVE their dinners. Truly one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  I like the way they designed their menus with favorite items and/or chef recommendations highlighted in red. Because they do change the menu pretty frequently, it's nice to automatically know some of the newbies you should try.  Some things you should absolutely order: -a pitcher of sangria. We shared it among 4 people and we each got two full glasses and then some. The pitcher costs $26, while a single glass costs $7. Huge savings, and well worth sharing among a small crowd.  -on the pinxtos menu, the date stuffed with cheese wrapped with chorizo is to die for. Embarrassingly enough, I always order 2-3 just for myself. They have something similar on the full size menu, but it's not identical, and these are sooooo fantastic that I don't even chance it. Get more than one. It's all of the flavors you would never expect to work that just do.  -spicy potatoes. They aren't over powering, and contain just the right amount of kick... And that chipotle mayo sauce is delicious! -beef tenderloin with blue cheese = perfection. It's cooked medium rare and has a slightly salty taste from the cheese. Mmm, mmm, good! -goat cheese with tomato sauce. It's super creamy and warm, and when placed on top of the garlic bread, it melts.  Some other menu items we thought were tasty (though not at the same 5+ star level as the above list): -ham and cheese croquettes. They came four to an order and were jam packed with flavor. Although they look like mozzarella sticks, the cheese isn't melty, it's more cream-based.  -hanger steak. It was cooked medium rare and came with roasted potatoes and harissa sauce (which we all thought was similar to sofrito, but I'm not sure if it was the color or the flavor that led us to believe that!).  -octopus! It was many of our first times trying octopus, but it exceeded our expectations. Ever so slightly chewy, but great pop of flavor.  Tips: -Check-in on Yelp and you get a free dessert. Surprisingly, because we all checked in, they let us all get a free dessert. It was NOT one per table. We tried four different ones and passed them around the table in true tapas fashion. They were about 5 bites a piece and hit the spot! My personal favorite was the rich chocolate cake!",0.9985,0.755,0.216,0.029,0.57868265993266

2016-07-02,5.0,"Where do I even begin?  Everyone always asks me what my favorite restaurant is in the city, and almost always I say, ""I don't know, I have so many!"", but now I can give a definitive answer and tell the whole world that Café Ba-ba-reeba is one of my all-time favorites.  This restaurant totally hits it out the ballpark, and I would reccomend it to anyone and everyone.  Café Ba-ba-reeba is equivalent to the eight wonder of the world - can you tell that I love it here? Like I said - where do I begin?  I suppose I can just start off by listing all the tapas thar we ordered, so here we go: 1. Potatoes and aioli 2. Spicy meatballs in sherry sauce 3. Beef empanada 4. Ham and chicken croquetas 5. Melted goat cheese in tomato sauce  6. Octopus with smoked potatoes Although I could just lean back, relax and tell you that each of these were phenomenal, let me just give you a brief description of each tapa we ordered. The potatoes and aioli are simple, but amazing; the aioli is finger-lickin good (quite literally).  The meatballs are juicy, and the sauce they are in is wonderfully flavorful.  The beef empanada was like a meat filled croissant - it was awesome.  The croquetas were amazing - that's all.  The melted goat cheese in tomato sauce came with garlic bread and the flavor mixed perfectly together - this was one of the best deals as well.  And finally, the octopus tasted like they fetched it straight from the sea; it had all the salinity your heart could desire, not to mention it was chewy but tender in the most perfect way.  Biased as I may sound, all of these tapas are a ""must-get"".  Yes, there's so many others to choose from but these were freaking amazing.   But hey, guess what?  The empanada, meatballs, croquetas and potatoes are all $3 or less during happy hour which is 4pm-6pm, Monday-Friday.  That way you can try more of their tapas for a little less money.  You can only take advantage of these happy hour deals if you sit in the bar area, but why not?  You still get the same great atmosphere and service when sitting in the bar so take advantage why don't ya?   Now, I'm not done - oh no, not even close.  My fiancé and I got the seafood paella after all those tapas.  I had high expectations for the paella since my fiancé has said it's the best he's had, and I was anything but disappointed.  The paella exceeded my expectations, and I can say it is now my favorite paella as well.  The saffron is very distinct, but not overwheleming, and the seafood was cooked perfectly.  I had some left-over and it still tasted just as good the following day.  That's impressive.  I don't usually have a burning desire to go back to the same restaurant twice, but I'd go here 10x over to indulge in this paella.   And after the paella, we had dessert - not one, but four to be precise (we pigged out just a little).  We had the black raspberry sorbet, caramelized bananas, natilla flan and the butterscotch mousse.  Don't even ask what my favorite one was there - they satisfied the sweet tooth like no other dessert ever has.  I'd say that you definitely should try the butterscotch mousse and the caramelized bananas...if you really have to choose.  Each dessert is only $3 and they're small so you should choose to get more than just one. And finally (as if that wasn't enough, right?) We got a pitcher of sangria that lasted throughout the entire course of our meal.  That pitcher is huge, and it's not filled to the brim with ice so you truly are getting a whole lotta sangria.  We got the red sangria which is only $17 for a pitcher during happy hour - hell yeah!  The sangria was awesome, maybe a little too awesome since I walked outta that place a little tipsy.  We also got some Spanish beer that was on draft and it was also very good...and yes, I was double-fisting it for a bit there. The atmosphere and the service made this dining experience even better.  The waiters and bussers were extremely attentive and always came through picking up our dirty plates.  We definitely didn't feel ignored, even though we weren't sitting in the main dining area.  In fact, it was kind of nice because it felt like private dining be for all the dinner crowd came. Ultimately, we left in some pain because of all that we ate, but can say that we came, we saw and we conquered.",0.9996,0.749,0.223,0.028,0.6051332199546484

A couple of my favorite tapas were the burrata, the grilled octopus with green harissa, beef tenderloin with blue cheese, and the bacon-wrapped dates. Of course, you can't go wrong serving a hunk of burrata, and the grilled octopus was tender and had a delicious char to the outside. The beef tenderloin with blue cheese was a bit of a strange request, but ended up being delicious. The blue cheese topping was a perfect salty complement a well-cooked and tender beef tenderloin. Personally, I am a huge sucker for bacon-wrapped dates and have to order them whenever I am out for tapas. There is something so special about crispy, salty bacon wrapped around a warm, gooey, and sweet yet slightly crisp on the outside date. Perfect combination and Ba-Ba-Reeba's dates certainly did not disappoint! I found tapas like the waffles with banana and nutella and the hangar steak to just be okay. Nothing really special or super flavorful going on. For dessert, we had a mango sorbet, which was good, and a flan with nitilla, which was also good, although it was fairly runny in the center. Overall, this is definitely a classic tapas restaurant and never a bad choice. The menu is extensive and pretty much all of the dishes were ordered were tasty.

2016-05-31,4.0,"I've been coming here for years and I love, love love it.  Of all the tapas bars in the city, I find the food here to be the most consistent and delicious, and the atmosphere the most fun.  Grab a bunch of friends and make a party out of it!  This is a great place for any type of celebration. My favorite dishes on the menu (I've tried basically everything!) are the patatas bravas (best I've ever had outside of Spain), shrimp in garlic, bacon wrapped dates, goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, spinach & manchego stuffed mushrooms.... I could go on and on.  That's why it's best to go with a large group, so you don't feel weird ordering 12 dishes (though I've gone with one other person before and done it... you'll just have a lot of leftovers!). The sangria is also delicious, with the white usually being my favorite (they will have different fruit options available depending on the season). The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is that they recently started doing delivery.  Having dined at the restaurant for many years, I know the food and the portion sizes, and though the prices were the same, both times I ordered for delivery the portions were greatly reduced.  I've seen other restaurants do this and I think it's fucking rude - just because they don't have to look you in the eye when they drop off the food, they think it's okay to cheat the customer?  I ordered the tomato goat cheese and it literally came with two tiny pieces of garlic bread, for $10 bucks - when you order this at the restaurant, it's like a cauldron of tomato and cheese with a whole basket of bread.  Anyway, I spent about $100 bucks on a delivery order for several people and we were all hungry when the food was gone, which is just a shame.  So, for that reason, I remove one star to punish you, Cafe Ba Ba Reeba!  Don't cheat your delivery customers!

We started off with the white peach sangria which was amazing. Not too sweet and perfect for a hot night. A half pitcher was enough for the two of us. We ordered six dishes. The deviled eggs(5/5), calamari (3/5), cooked salmon with dill (2/5), beef empanadas(5/5), the steak with chimichurri (3/5), and the spicy potatoes (3/5). My favorites were the deviled eggs and the empanadas hands down! The rest were delicious but I'd probably order something else my next time around to try something new.   The service was a little slow and you had to get the waiters attention at times.

We came during happy hour but were disappointed to find out it was only served at the bar. As we were dining with our 2 children, we couldn't take advantage of it. The restaurant has a nice kids menu and they give the kids crayons and wiki sticks. The mac and cheese was not great with neither of our kids really caring for it. Out of the tapas, the highlights were the patatas bravas and the meatballs. I like the brussel sprout salad while my wife found it too strong on horseradish.  Both the patatas, tortilla, and empanada came with a goopy sauce which seemed to be just a flavored mayonnaise.

She was throwing up in the bathroom. Happens to the best of us). I would recommend the berry.  We got a variety of different plates-some of my favorites were the Brussels sprout salad, chicken with peri peri sauce and steak with mashed potatoes. My favorite was hands down the burrata: the bread was crispy and light, the spread, which was sweeter than I anticipated, complemented the fresh mozzarella perfectly. Its like biting into a little cheesy piece of Heaven. The chorizo dates, which are $2 for one, are worth a try as well. They were warm and amazing and I probably could've eaten 5 more.

A glass or two of fino sherry to start with cold tapas, and wine throughout the rest is a more traditional way to dine. The sangria is the best anywhere but I have CBBR's recipe so I make it at home. The Gambas a la Plancha, Calamares a la Parilla, Tortilla Española, Pincho de Solomillo and many others from the original menu NEVER disappoint.

I was soooo looking forward to coming back so I recommended this place to my friends for one of us's farewell dinner since she was leaving town.  Okay, checking on us is good. But coming and asking too frequently whether we need anything else/ whether we're gonna order some more is a little uncomfortable. To me, experience is the second important thing (of course, the first thing is food) when I evaluate a restaurant but it was bad today. It felt like she wanted us to either order more or eat quickly and just leave. Yeah, more people started to come in for dinner but it wasn't that busy like last time when I came during the weekend. There were still empty tables. Also, when we got out receipt I wrote down my LettuceEats number on the receipt but it seemed like she didn't add it so I asked her and she said she'll add it later. I checked and it's not added. The supposedly warm/hot tapas dishes we ordered were generally quite cold when it came out. Seems like it was sitting there for a while before it was served to us.  Also, I told my friend that grilled octopus tapas they have here is so soft but what we actually had today was hard to chew. Since I had a really great time last time, I was really disappointed. I felt sorry to my friends for recommending.

Also, if you check in on Yelp you get a free dessert tapa!  The service is always good, and very attentive. This restaurant is popular though! So expect it to always be busy and a little loud.

2016-04-20,4.0,"An excellent place to take visitors for a fun time, good buzz, and full stomach - all without breaking the bank! First of all, sign up for their texting service- about once a month, Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba issues a special free food item. You can log on to their website and sign up directly there (right panel). Secondly, there's almost always a Yelp checkin special - also for free food. There used to be a foursquare one, but foursquare..is no more. Third, if you're going during a popular time..PUT IN A RESERVATION. You and your guests will thank you. Now...before you order any food. Get some sangria in ya! It's tapas for goodness sakes! They normally have a seasonal, but I love sticking to the traditional red - Not overwhelmingly sweet and shared among a few friends, a decent value. I've been here more times than I can count. Without writing an essay for you, my recommendations:  - brussel sprouts salad, marcona almonds, manchego cheese ($6) - spicy potatoes with tomato alioli (patata bravas) ($6) - rioja-braised short rib, manchego mashed potatoes, roasted seasonal vegetables & rioja wine glaze ($12) - grilled hanger steak with charred green chili chimichurri & fingerling potatoes ($10) - grilled octopus with green harissa, smoked potatoes & olives ($12) - buttermillk-fried chicken thighs, piri-piri sauce & shaved vegetable salad ($7) Now keep in mind, these are tapas so the portions are far from big. Normally when I go with a big group I get a few servings of the Paella to make sure we're all full. I normally go with the seafood paella with shrimp, monkfish, clams & green beans ($17 per serving) PS: They also have a happy hour. Last I checked, it was $16 pitchers of sangria, and select tapas at 1985 prices. M-F 4-6. Go get'em.",0.9939,0.81,0.176,0.015,0.498266499582289

Ordered a few pinxos and tapas, everything was quite good. Left for a very reasonable price and felt comfortably full and content from the sangria. The only reason I can't give five stars is due to a post dining customer service reason. I left my sunglasses at the bar and realized later that night that I had not picked them up. Being a few miles away already without a car, I decided to wait until the morning to call for them. The next morning I called shortly after they opened. I was told they were very busy and to call back. I thought this was fine, I'd rather have them be honest then just pretend to look. Calling later on during the later afternoon I was greeted with a similar response, but this time I said I'd wait on hold until they had a chance to look. Not 40 seconds later I was told they didn't have them and they were sorry. Maybe they looked, maybe they didn't. Either way I retraced all my steps and that was the only logical place for the sun glasses to be. The knock is for potential employee honesty issues, other than that keep doing what you're doing.

2016-04-18,5.0,"Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is hands down one of my favorite places in Chicago. It can get pretty busy so it is nice they take reservations. Try to snag a seat outside in the first room as the natural lighting makes for a perfect afternoon/early dinner. The back is a little more crowded/but oddly romantic if you're looking for that atmosphere. I find that when I go here it's the best when the table orders a pitcher of sangria to share (possibly more depending on the size). Then we each order two tapas, one for ourselves only and one to split with the table (if you're trying to pay for a normal cost meal). And a dessert to split (despite the small portion) is actually quite perfect to tie it all together. Here are all the items I've tried.  DRINKS: Sangria is a must, and I highly recommend the White Peach. I've had their Blood Orange Special, and the Passion Fruit, but they don't compare to the White Peach. I could drink a pitcher alone. FOOD: Vegetables  -Brussel sprout salad (#22) not a fan of brussel sprouts but it was pleasant (not filling though) -Wood Oven Roasted Veggies w/Pinenuts (#28) very tasty, good for vegetarians  -Spicy Potatoes (#30) not super spicy but a perfect amount of kick and flavor -Spinach & Manchego-stuffed Mushrooms (#31) I order these every time! Must have -Goat Cheese baked in Tomato sauce (#32) great for group sharing but they give you bread anyways so I kind of pass this one unless someone else from my group orders MEAT: -Beef Skewer, horseradish (#54) DO NOT SHARE. You will regret it because it is so good you just want it for yourself. This is one of my favorite items! -Shrimp with garlic, olive oil (#44)- Other favorite if you like seafood, this is good! Just make sure to flick off the red pepper flakes if you aren't into spicy! DESSERTS: -Caramelized Banana- Probably one of the most underrated options at the restaurant. THIS IS AMAZING. Probably could make it home but so worth $3.  -Butterscotch custard- small portion, but again just melts in your mouth and the perfect bites. DISLIKE: -The only menu item I haven't really enjoyed was the chicken & ham croquetas (#63)- unfortunately my experience was like a few sad soggy corndogs.  -The paella is alright, but honestly I don't find it all that exciting and definitely not worth how much it is.",0.9977,0.709,0.23,0.061,0.5892617550164719

The shrimp skewers and cheese plate were good, though I didn't care for the guava cube or the orange marmalade. However the absolute BEST thing we had was the shrimp paella.

2016-04-11,4.0,The food here is very tasty. I came here on a double date. For food we had the bacon wrapped dates and they were probably the entire table's favorite. We next did the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce which was paired with garlic bread- no complaints there! The short rib was very tasty and cooked tenderly-we all loved this one too. We all also enjoyed the shrimp with garlic. I really liked the calamari since it was really crispy.  The chicken empanada was also very flavorful and we all liked that more so than the beef one. We finished with the meatballs which were nothing special and not worth it with so many other delicious items on the menu! The portions were small but it was sufficient for 4 of us to taste everything and still leave stuffed. I had a virgin sangria which I thought was very good and I couldn't tell the difference. The boys felt the drinks were a little too fruity since sangria is pretty much the only option here. The other downside was that the food came out super fast and our meal went very quickly so take your time with ordering if you want to relax and spend time with your friends/family. One tip we would give to this tapas restaurant is to provide serving spoons for the dishes.

On the menu there's a ton to pick from - the baked goat cheese in sauce, buttermilk chicken, dates, and beef with blue cheese are some of my favorites. The paella is also good, granted I've only tried the seafood one - but they're a bit more of a commitment (30 min wait, minimum two serving order per table).

However, one ultimately returns to a restaurant for the food. And the food just isn't cutting it for me. Not impressed. We ordered a few tapas plates to share. I wish all of the food came to the table at once but that's not the case here. The food is plated very well (although the portion sizes are ridiculously small, even for tapas) and gets you really excited to dive in and taste. But when you do taste the food it's nothing special. It lacks salt, the food is cold, mostly everything was nasty, even the desserts we tried. The only thing I enjoyed was the fried chicken bites and the braised rib (which could still use some salt). I just think the flavor was lacking. Idk maybe a bad night? Also, I think this place is overpriced for the mediocre food :/ eh!",-0.1946,0.763,0.129,0.108,0.7794047619047618
2016-03-19,4.0,"This is a really fun place for brunch just because there are so many tapas options that you can go with!

My favorites were the citrus french toast, the short rib sliders, the serrano ham eggs benedicts, and the spinach and artichoke crepe. We got a ton of other tapas which were also fantastic but these were probably the ones I would definitely order again. A few of us also split a pitcher of the pear sangria which was a sweet sangria but it didn't really taste very much like pear unfortunately.  The best part is you get a free dessert tapas with each person who checks in on yelp! We ended up with a couple of desserts from the check ins including the caramelized banana, natilla flan (which has a really great saffron flavor), the almond caramel bar and the chocolate truffle cake. All were really yummy!

I was quite full after sampling everything mentioned above. The white peach sangria washed everything down quite nicely.  The restaurant is large and had some nice mood lighting which I appreciated. Service was just ok. Even though our server managed to have the tapas spaced appropriately he did forget a few dishes and a couple of us had to remind him about drinks we ordered. He was lacking a personality. I've noticed over the years that many LEYE restaurants have delicious food but noticeably sullen, robotic or easily agitated servers.  It's one of the greatest mysteries of the modern world.

It is really easy to get to the place, although I do not recommend going with your own car because parking might be hard.  The exterior of the place is not very enticing but once you are inside it is a whole different story. The place was packed and the atmosphere was great. We did not wait long to be served, and the server made some really good recommendations. She was very nice andcattentive overall and answered all of our requests pretty quick. Me and my companion decided to drink sangria with the dinner. I would say it was ok.  For the food, I wanted to order some really typical Spanish stuff so we went with Tortilla, Croquetas, Calamares, and Jamon. Overall, they were really good and they were close to the flavours of my country. The only one that fell a bit short was the jamon, but it was still good. It certainly met my expectations.

We had baked goat cheese, short ribs, olives, spicy chorizo and chicken skewers, stuffed mushrooms and the almond desert.  For the size of the tapas I was impressed - it was honestly a lot of food for just two people and we couldn't finish everything.

2016-03-08,5.0,"This is by far one of the best tapas places in Chicago! Located in the vibrant Lincoln Park area, it is only a short walk from the CTA brown line. Although parking can be hard to come by depending on how busy the time of the day is, you might get lucky scoring street parking on one of the side streets.  The prices and portions of Café BabaReeba's foods are quite good. Note that it is a tapas place and hence most items are small portions and are meant for sharing. Please be sure to come with a few friends so that you can make the most of your experience by trying a bunch of different items without breaking bank. And given the wide variety of food offered here, it is well worth trying a handful of different items.  These items are probably my go-to, all time favorites:- Chorizo-Wrapped Medjool Date & Cheese  Perfect combo with the date bringing the sweetness and chorizo bringing the bold richness. Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Alioli  MY FAVORITE!!! So, so good!! Spinach & Manchego-Stuffed Mushrooms  Light but delicious veggie item. Grilled Hanger Steak  I got mine medium rare and it was done just perfect! So juicy and tasty. Seared Lamb Loin  Seared to perfection. Meat was super tender. Seared Sea Scallops  This was excellent! Perfectly seared but soft and juicy on the inside.  Grilled Octopus  Typical but delicious. Skewered Chicken & Chorizo Sausage  A good filler as the meat helps curb your appetite especially if you're there to try a bunch of stuff but not stuff yourself.

We had the flank steak, spicy potatoes, beef tenderloin & blue cheese, and my favorite the chicken paella. *Note - order the paella first because it takes awhile!* We also had some desserts which were perfect small plates (what else would it be?) so we got to try a few and they did not disappoint.

They have a tortilla española here that is so good, it reminds me of the ones I ate while living in Spain. I chose this restaurant for my birthday dinner exactly for this reason however, the service I received on this night was so poor - I'm not sure I'll be returning again. The hostess was wonderful and polite, but after being seated our server was another story. Our first interaction was a ""hello, be right there"" said in passing as he went to other tables. I wrote it off as him being busy, I understand how hectic restaurant week can get. But as time passed and tables left, it didn't get any better. Every time we were ordering, his eyes were darting around the room like we were wasting his time.  The only positive thing I can say about him is that he politely switched our drinks after we ordered the wrong one. I didn't come to the restaurant for a free dessert on my birthday, I came to reminisce on the Spanish food I love so much while enjoying a pleasant dinner, aided by a helpful server. I definitely wasn't ""entertained"" at all by this restaurant that is a part of the Lettuce Entertain you group. This service just turned me off so much - something you don't want to experience on a special day.

We ordered 6 items between two people, which was just a tad too much food for us. I enjoy leftovers though, so I was perfectly fine with bringing home an assortment of goodies that I could snack on later.  1. Sausage fried paella rice with poached egg (off the brunch menu, everything else we ordered was from the dinner menu): This was good but not really a paella. I mean it was honestly a glorified fried rice at best. Don't get me wrong, it was freaking delicious and there was nothing left over from this, but when I order paella, I look for that metal skillet and a crust of rice. This definitely did not have that. 2. Spicy tomatoes with tomato aioli: This was my boyfriends favorite dish. The tomatoes were bomb. Aioli was more bomb. Just bombs all around.  3. Spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms: Good but pretty average. You get 4 decently sized mushroom. I don't even really like mushrooms so in hindsight, not too sure why I ordered that.  4. Seared sea scallops with leaks, torched oranges, and jamon serrano: Soooo yummy! This was the most expensive thing we ordered, but it was worth it! You get 4 scallops but they were perfectly balanced with that buttery scallop texture cut with the citrus from the oranges. [insert 2 thumbs up emojis] 5. Rioja braised short rib: Okay this was probably one of my favorite things. The meat was sooooo tender and just ugh tres magnifique! The sauce was good, the mashed potatoes were very buttery (maybe a little too buttery?) but meat and potatoes is just such a classic dish. It's hard to go wrong with something like that. 6. Grilled skewer of marinated pork belly and pork loin: I remember this being good, but I guess it wasn't as memorable as the other ones.. Overall, enjoyed a fantastic lunch!

2016-01-25,4.0,"Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba (CBR) is one of our go to restaurants when we want to eat Tapas. We were celebrating my son's birthday last Saturday and made reservations online thru Open Table. This restaurant gets SUPER busy, even at 5:30 pm, so be sure you make reservations. Parking is permit only in the neighborhood and there is no garage. CBR does have a valet service for $13. Totally worth it, Lincoln Park is super busy on the weekend and it's very hard to find street parking. We began our evening with cocktails; they offer many flavors of Sangria. I usually order 1/2 a pitcher of red wine Sangrias. You get about 3 full glasses from 1/2 a pitcher. It's more economical than individual glasses. CBR also offers full pitchers. My sons ordered a margarita and a mojito. We discovered that many places offer a mojito but there is an art to actually making a good mojito, CBR fell short on this mojito. Not mixed correctly. Margarita was fine. Tapas is a great way to try several dishes with your companions. Tapas are appetizer sized portions of Spanish dishes and arrive at your table in no special order. We usually start off with 2 per person, keep a menu handy and order more as the night progresses. We've been to CBR a few times and have tried pretty much everything on the menu and have been happy with taste, quality and quantity. If you order the paella, allow some extra time for it's preparation.  Our waiter, busboy and servers were very efficient, even thought the restaurant was packed! They never forgot about us and were quick to refill our water glasses, clear dishes and bring new dishes to our table. When making the reservation on Open Table I did note that we would be celebrating my son's 22nd Birthday but, no complimentary dessert was offered to him :(.

This evening there was a snafu with our reservation (this has NEVER happened in three years) and we had to wait just a bit.

2016-01-19,4.0,"I had an early-ish dinner here with my fiance last Thursday, and we had a great meal. We were able to be seated right away arriving around 5:30. We chose the chorizo-wrapped date and the laughing bird shrimp for a bite-sized pinxto ($2/ea.) Hubs enjoyed his date; my shrimp was good, but I wasn't prepared for the actual strip of chewy white fat adorning the top of the skewer, which I removed and didn't eat. When they said ""topped with fat"" I guess I assumed it was drizzled with a little grease or something; I personally don't eat solid pieces of fat like that.  We shared the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, which was really delicious ($8), and had a plate of soy-orange duck wings which were the special that evening and should go on the permanent menu, they were so tender and tasty. We attempted to order 1/2 a pitcher of the blood orange sangria (also a special for the evening) but apparently the server heard ""HAVE a pitcher of sangria,"" and brought us a full one, which we didn't figure out til we looked at the bill. I thought it was a little generous for a half, but didn't ask! Oh well. Guess someone's gonna have to drink all that extra sangria. Shucks!  We also ordered 2 portions (the minimum order) of the seafood paella with shrimp, scallops, and monkfish. I could only find a single piece of monkfish in the entire pan, but there were a more reasonable number of shrimp and scallops. The paella takes about 30 minutes to cook to order, so they ask you to be prepared that it will take a little longer than the tapas orders. Though we were stuffed by this point, my Yelp check-in earned us a free dessert tapa, so we chose the caramelized banana with vanilla ice cream and pistachios, the perfect sweet but not too heavy ending to our delicious meal. We ended up spending about $85 for the meal, which earned us 1 point per $1 for the Lettuce Entertain You group's frequent diner reward program - there are so many affiliated restaurants, it's a great program to enroll in!

2016-01-17,5.0,"I see why this restaurant has such a long and rich history in Chicago, because it is truly outstanding. My friend and I came for brunch recently, and really loved our experience here. Making reservations was easy since they are on Open Table, and I was able to snag us a table the day before our Saturday brunch. During brunch you have the options of choosing between the brunch items, or the dinner items on the other side of the menu. The fact that there are so many options is dangerous, because everything sounds delicious. I decided to focus on items from the brunch menu, because I know I'll come another time to try the dinner items.  Our waitress was very attentive and answered our questions about the menu well. My friend and I both didn't order any cocktails, since we both were more in need of caffeine, but I hear their sangria is amazing.  To eat I ordered the citrus french toast  stick, deviled egg, and baked eggs.  Citrus french toast stick: It had a light citrus taste, and the flavor was not overpowering . The outer texture was crispy, and the inner part was soft. I almost wish I had ordered two instead of one, because it was my second favorite item from my visit.  Deviled egg: It was good and had a little bit of a kick to it. Baked Eggs: I am head over hills and in love with their baked eggs. The eggs are covered in cheese,  a tangy sauce and are  perfectly baked.  The tomato bread is seriously some of the best bread I've ever had, and it paired perfectly with the baked eggs. If you enjoy eggs, tomatoes, and cheese, then this dish is for you.  The price point is excellent for the quality of the food here.

2016-01-17,5.0,"I'm not sure what a Ba-Ba-Reeba is, but Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! offers some of the better tapas options that I've had in the Chicagoland area. The highlights were the potatoes with tomato aioli, seafood paella, and the short ribs. Book early! We called in to put our names on the list an hour in advance and still had to wait 45 minutes to get seated. The dimly lit and smokey atmosphere probably would offer an intimate experience if I hadn't come to the restaurant with my goofy friends. A couple huge slabs of meat hung from the ceiling near the bar area, making things feel somehow more authentic.  Once we put in our orders, the food came out surprisingly fast and well timed. We got our peach sangria first and though it didn't taste too boozy, it offered a solid sugary supplement to the free bread. The short ribs came out right away and WOW was it tender. It came out in one slab of meat and melted to the cut of my BUTTER KNIFE. That's when you know... The dish was pretty amazing and probably my favorite of the night. The potatoes with tomato aioli came out after, followed by the chorizo wrapped dates and the duck special. Everything was well seasoned and delicious. The paella came out last, and although it would have gone well with the other dishes, it was a solid finisher to fill us up. We were stuffed but because we checked in on yelp, we all got free dessert! That was an awesome deal - go Yelp. We shared the butterscotch custard, flan, pumpkin empanadas, and the glazed bananas. The pumpkin empanadas were kind of whack because they were salty, but everything else was tasty. I left in a food coma, which is why I had to wait until today to leave my review.

It was nice because I could order a couple of the ""Pintxos"" or bite-sized tapas and they're enough for one if you order a couple. I ordered the yogurt Pintxos and the citrus French toast and that was too much food! The vanilla yogurt and granola was SO good, I cannot describe it with justice. Who knew that simple yogurt could be so delicious! It was a thicker Greek yogurt, with just the right amount of sweet. I got the entrée size of the French toast and I regret it. It was good but I didn't need that much of it. I did like the goat cheese ""butter"" that came with the entrée though, and doesn't come with the Pintxos. In general though, I didn't think it was that great and I don't think I'll even be ordering a Pinxtos version of it in the future. In hindsight I wish I had ordered 3 Pintxos.

I like tapas and it was pretty good the first time (but try sharing tapas with someone that hates all vegetables... ugh limited choices) Anyway, our waiter was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. We let him know about all my allergies right away (gluten, nuts, shellfish ... yes my life sucks) and he immediately offered me gluten free bread, gave me the gluten free menu, and let the kitchen know about all of my allergies. It is SO nice when restaurants are this accommodating to allergies.   We started with a pitcher of red sangria, which was delicious and a really good deal. You get nearly 4 glasses each out of that and for a good price. Normally gluten free bread is not the greatest and it really makes me miss regular bread, this was actually pretty good! Especially with the olive oil they provide on the table.  For tapas, we ordered: 1) serrano ham, salchichon, chorizo & manchego platter - really good, the ham is definitely the best and it even tasted good with my gluten free bread  2) spicy potatoes with tomato alioli - way too good... probably could have eaten the whole thing myself  3) seared salmon, dill crema, roasted squash & caramelized lemon - delicious  We also got the chicken paella, which was amazing. That's saying a lot since the last time I had paella was in Spain, so they really did a good job. Obviously we had leftovers because it was huge, so we got to enjoy it the next night too.

We were seated at a table right next to the bathrooms and I constantly found myself drawing my chair back and forth to let people pass. The small plate (tapas) experience is indeed unique. Perhaps I'm just too used to the conventional style of dining (starter, main, dessert), but for me, I wasn't a fan of getting each small plate spaced out 5-10 minutes apart. Two tapas plates would show up, followed by a Pintxo (""starter"") plate, then a 10-minute wait before another plate. Just seems oddly spaced out. Due to the portion sizes, I just found myself wanting all the plates at once. However, reasonably priced and great flavour in the dishes we tried.

You can can come for a casual bite, spend a small amount and walk away satisfied OR you could come for an extravagant meal, spend a bit more and walk away brimming, fat and happy! We can for an extra special night and took the extravagant route! ;)  We started with the half pitcher of the classic sangria for $17. It was the perfect amount for us...and so delicious! If you are a sangria fan, you have to try it here!  We ordered six tapas and loved each and everyone. From the veggies and appetizer section we had the Brussel sprout salad and the spicy potatoes. I preferred the Brussel sprout salad because it was so finely chopped, lightly drizzled with oil and enhanced with sweet almonds. My partner preferred the spicy potatoes with the spicy tomato aioli. It was a perfect split for the two of us, but we enjoyed both! From the beef section we ordered the short rib and we ordered the fried calamari from the seafood section. The short rib was decadent, flavorful and heavenly tender. I could have eaten five of them, they were so good. The fried calamari were also good, but the mixture of the red Fresca salsa and cream sauce was the highlight of the dish! From the pork menu we ordered the assortment of cured pork meats and olives as well as the dates wrapped in bacon. The cured meats were a great starter and way to try some of the restaurants house cured meats. The dates, however, were my favorite dish. Paired with a sweet vinaigrette and apples, it was simply to die for! We ended the evening with the $3 dessert a.) because they are only $3 and b.) because Yelp checkin provides a free dessert tapa! Perfect! We both got the chocolate truffle which was amazing! However, it was sooo sweet that I had to give half of it to my partner. But he loved it!

2015-12-06,4.0,"Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is a tapas restaurant in LP. I came here once for Sunday brunch, and continue to come back. Its a place where food is meant to be shared and they accommodate large parties exceptionally well. I celebrated a birthday here last week, and CBBR accommodated our party of 8 and didn't hesitate to split the check 8 ways. My only complaint is that if you order pitchers of sangria, they don't replenish water. My friend and I had to ask for a water refill.  I like how they space out the tapas, and their initial recommendation to order 1-2 tapas per person. This provided enough food for everyone to share.  At my most recent dinner experience, we ordered the following: chorizo-wrapped medjool dates and cheese-a popular tapa that reminded me of Avec's prosciutto-wrapped dates.  spicy potatoes with tomato aioli-one of my favorite tapas here and at Mercat a la Planxa. I prefer M a la P's patatas bravas over the spicy potatoes at CBBR, but for the price point, CBBR hits the spot.  grilled octopus-this was one of my favorites tapas at CBBR and I would order this again. Don't be afraid to try octopus. It's not fishy tasting at all! scallop empanada-flaky crust, generous scallop filling.  buttermilk-fried chicken thighs-Mmm. Not what you'd expect if you're a Nando's fan. This is a marriage of fried chicken doused in peri peri sauce.  grilled hanger steak-sliced for sharing, moist and succulent meat.  seafood paella with squid and squid ink-Our entire party's favorite dish, this is a special that should be made into a regular offering. Instead of rice, this dish contained vermicelli noodles, with a generous seafood portion. Highly recommend ordering this before its no longer offered!",0.9918,0.815,0.17,0.015,0.559481351981352

But you can get full service at the first come, first serve bar areas or high tops which is what my girl and I did. The service is quick and efficient! Since this is a tapas place, I suggest ordering 1-2 things at a time and when those come, order your next selection. That way just as you're finishing your first order, your next order is coming right out! The food is wonderful and very flavorful. I highly suggest EVERYTHING! Seriously, there are so many good choices, it's hard to go wrong here. We ended up ordering like 6-8 plates total, not including our two dessert tapas - save room for dessert!!!! All in all, I would give this place 5 stars for service and quality of food. Some plates can be a bit pricy like the shrimp but it is well worth it!! Others are a fair/good deal, like the patatas bravas which had the right amount of spice and salt but was a big filling plate PS - we had a WBEZ member card which our waiter told us entitled us to buy one, get one tapas for free.

Cream of Mushroom soup - So apparently the mushroom baby food idea didn't fly and Café Ba Ba Reeba bought the entire stock of this apple sauce textured extremely weak attempt at soup. Good news babies, no ""soup"" for you! Grilled Octopus - Cooked very well but had a fishy taste which they tried to cover up by coating it in smoked paprika, nothing more here...just an over load of smoked paprika Seared Salmon with Dill Crème - That's about it. Just a piece of overcooked salmon with dill sauce on the side. Just not exciting at all. No additional flavors on the salmon besides ""dry"" And I think we got something else forgettable, but they did make sure to include that same dill sauce that the salmon had. I mean, why not just cover everything up in dill sauce, right? I do have to say that the desserts were good and our server was excellent. He was super attentive and the best part of the meal.

Short ribs: Tender and loved the flavors; however, I wasn't a fan of the side of mashed potatoes, which seemed suspiciously like they came from powder rather than real potatoes. Pomegranate salad: Solidly executed but lacked any special flavor or combination of flavors that would have made it worth writing home about. Pork belly and loin skewer: The weakest dish of the night. I'm pretty certain the skewer came with only loin cuts, which were extremely tough and dry. The sauce that came on the side alleviated the dryness, but I really would've preferred to see a sauce that was made for the dish than what seemed to be a generic dollop of mayonnaise-type sauce that was also used for the scallop empanadas. Seared scallop: I found this rather salty, although I thoroughly enjoyed the sweetness and acidity that the grapefruit brought to the dish. However, I definitely thought that the dish was not worth its price. Flan: Interesting combination of honey and what seems to be cinnamon, but definitely erred on the sweeter side. Service this time around was extremely slow, and I was rather disappointed that I didn't find any more tapas that I loved aside from the ones I discovered last time.

The restaurant space is huge and there is a wide variety of seating options, ranging from big group tables illuminated by skylights in the front to the dimmer, date-night candlelit areas further back.  Our server was extremely friendly and helpful; no complaints whatsoever.   Since it was our first time here, we decided to go with the more popular items, which were helpfully highlighted in red on the menu.  We ended up ordering at least one thing from every category, and they were all delicious.  Thankfully, the food also came with enough time in between each dish to enjoy each one properly. Burrata (vegetables & cheese): very creamy cheese which contrasted nicely with the fresh sweetness of the roasted corn, tomatoes, and other vegetables. Rioja-braised shortrib w/ mashed potatoes and vegetables (beef & lamb): the shortrib was tender and flavorful, and mashed potatoes were satisfying (as they always are).  However, the vegetables were somewhat overcooked and a bit soggy due to the red wine sauce. Seared sea scallops (seafood): normally I'm not a big fan of scallops due to their somewhat fatty taste, but the citrus and the leeks helped to balance out the flavor and provide a nice bite.  Not quite sure it's worth $13 though. But the highlight of the meal came in the form of the bacon wrapped dates (under the label chicken & pork, for some reason).  Oh my gosh, they were so good!  Sweet, salty, and rich, hitting all the reward systems that are a part of human taste.  No regrets. Total cost: $42 w/out tax or tip.  This was enough food for two people, so I ended up paying around $26-27.  Not very cheap, but given this is a popular restaurant in the middle of Chicago, it's to be expected.   I would definitely recommend coming here for a delicious experience.",0.9962,0.757,0.212,0.031,0.5066438083879944

2015-11-14,4.0,"Came here with a large group recently, which I believe is the best way to experience the restaurant due to the tapas style. We were able to sample a large amount of the menu and overall were very impressed. I wouldn't say I was wowed by anything, hence the 4 stars, but would definitely return. Some of the memorable dishes included the pan seared scallops, grilled squid, and the beef tenderloin. We also ordered the seafood paella, which I thought was delicious, but it was my first time eating paella so I have no basis for comparison. The portion size on the paella was also very generous so if you're planning on ordering this I'd go with a few less tapas dishes. One other let down was the jamon iberico, which again I have no basis for comparison, but considering the legendary status of this holy grail of the pork family I was expecting something much more flavorful. I guess this means I will have to plan a trip to Spain to conduct a proper comparison.",0.8907,0.845,0.102,0.054,0.4485515873015872
2015-11-13,2.0,"Sorry Chicago-ans.. if this is your version of a top tapas restaurant... I'm not sure what else there is to say.  If Ba-Ba-Reeba were located in a small town, I'd rate it higher (3 stars)... but it's located in one of the largest cities in the US, so the quality, flavor and freshness should be compared with places like Boqueria (Flatiron) and Olea (Ft. Greene) in NYC. Or even Spain? I've only lived in Andalucia (Southern Spain) and I think the comparison is similar to Chinese food in the US (babareeba) vs. Chinese food in China...  The Bloody Mary bar should be avoided at all costs. Even their ""spicy"" mix is just a tad spicy at best. Plus, the choices are overwhelming... your drink will just taste like tomato juice with random spices in it.  The food was just off. I felt like I was at a commercialized chain restaurant eating processed food (The Cheesecake Factory was the first place that came to mind).  1) Patatas Bravas: They put a coating on the patatas (paprika?), which make them taste funky. I appreciate that they don't want to serve up traditional patatas, but this iteration tasted starchy, processed and strange.  2) Brussel sprout salad: This was admittedly the best dish from what I tried. However, the ratio of cheese and dressing to sprouts was off... So I felt inundated with the fixings, I could barely taste the sprouts.  3) Octopus: Check out my picture, does that look appetizing? It was overly oily and rubbery. My cousin had never tried octopus and I convinced him (Since I savor the octopus at Taverna Kyclades in Astoria, Queens and even Boqueria). Our server said ""it's everyone's favorite..."" (This dish reaffirmed why I left Chicago after living there for 3 years).  4) NOW for the worst part of the meal... DESSERT. I received a free dessert through Yelp and our server recommended the marcona-almond caramel bar. It's basically a glorified snickers bar, but worse... So we looked on Yelp and saw that folks reallllly liked the butterscotch custard. So for sh*ts and giggles we ordered that too... #fail. It tasted like overly sweetened condensed milk with flavoring.  Silver lining? I got to hang with my cousin, who I haven't seen in a few years... so I did enjoy the company, thus the 2 star rating.",0.9908,0.818,0.133,0.049,0.5076628352490422

Huge serving. -Grilled octopus - I love octopus, so sorry to report this was rather bland and a little too chewy for my liking. -Buttermilk fried chicken thighs - another super flavorful dish and another huge serving. -Bacon wrapped dates w/ apple vinaigrette - I'm not sure which I liked more - these or the chorizo wrapped dates. The fruity vinaigrette is a lovely accompaniment. I could have eaten the entire plate of these babies. -Deviled egg - a good deviled egg, but save that $2 for another chorizo-wrapped date instead. -Ham & cantaloupe salad - Sweet and salty, not heavy, refreshing. Loved this. -Desserts - we tried the caramelized banana, butterscotch custard, and almond caramel bar. Not bad at all, but nothing to write home about. -Margarita - they make a really nice margarita here, strong, but not overbearing.

2015-09-04,2.0,"Let's get one thing straight from the get-go.  Pan con tomate means Bread with tomato.  It doesn't mean bread with tomato, arugula manchego, anchovies, iberico or whatever other Spanish ingredient you can think to put on top of it.  It means bread with tomato.  The success of such a dish depends on having high quality super ripe tomatoes, combined with bread that has been toasted after being brushed with a scant amount of olive oil and just lightly rubbed with a bit of garlic.  When you have pan con tomate on the menu and you bring out this abomination that has all this extra bull s*** on it you embarrass yourself.  This is not Spanish food.  I wanted what I ordered, and what the menu said it was.  Simple refreshing bread with tomato.   The kind that is so good that you marvel at how something so simple can be so tasty can be so elegant and delicious. Furthermore,  I don't understand how the Patatas Bravas at Tall Boy Taco which is owned by the same company and also happens to be a Mexican Joint rather than a Spanish one can be so much better than the ones here.  The decision the coat them in paprika prior to frying and then do so in such a way to burn the paprika takes away from all the positive notes you can get from the tasty aoili. While we're on the subject of burnt food, let's talk about my croquetas, which upon arriving at the table I thought looked a little dark.  But before tasting them I gave them the benefit of the doubt and assumed that it was overcooked which it was.  How obviously burnt food makes it past the line cook, expediter, and runner to the table, shows a pretty blatant lack of care and concern when it comes to the quality of the food.  It's not like I couldn't have waited on a refire, there was plenty of food at the table already and the only reason I didn't send it back is because I was already food. The two saving graces for this meal were the Sangria was good and that i was near full when I decided to eat here.  Absent those two things it wouldn't have even been worth coming here.  It is such a shame because the space is charming and it being a Lettuce restaurant carries a bit of weight with me.  They just fell really short.",0.9928,0.841,0.131,0.028,0.45086605255209905

2015-09-01,2.0,"Perhaps this place is a bit hyped up. Was super excited to go here on date night, once we found out the wait for too long we ended up going to a different Tapas restaurant. But one lazy Sunday afternoon we decided to swing by to see if they have any outdoor seating. We got lucky (they only have 2 tables outside btw). After being challenged with awful attitude on the phone, and in person by a rude hostess we gave it a shot.  Sangrias were great I must say. Every other tapas was so underwhelming it was just sad. A pitcher of Sangria couldn't make food better....Potatoes were served to us within a minute or two, obviously not prepared fresh. They looked/tasted like they were laying under a hot lamp for a few hours. Bread and mushroom tapas were so unoriginal, they didn't even try...i will include photos, do your own judgement.  I expected much more from a place that was so hyped up, but to my disappointment they turned authentic Spanish restaurant to all american brunch place with bloody mary bar. No creative attention to detail and lack of presentation. Isn't what tapas are all about ?  Don't expect much if your coming here to get an authentic feel and try one of a kind dishes.

2015-08-27,4.0,"I originally was going to Summer House for dinner with a friend, but the wait was 1 hr and 15 minutes. Hold on, WHAT! We decided to walk a block over to Café Ba-Ba-Reeba. What a blessing in disguise!! This place is awesome.  We obviously wanted to try some of the sangrias. Our waiter told us that we can order half pitchers, which was great because we just could not decide! We chose the sangria of the day, mango, and cevé I believe it was called, which was a sparkling sangria. Both were great, but I preferred the mango one, which we ordered a second pitcher of.  We ordered a WIDE array of foods, which they brought out as they were ready. We were also told if we wanted paella, it would take ~35 minutes to make, and you need to order at least two servings. Glad to know it is all prepared fresh!! First up was the bacon wrapped dates (in some kind of apple glaze) and shaves Brussels sprout salad. The bacon wrapped dates were unreal! The apple glaze paired very well with it, and it wasn't too sweet. The Brussels sprout salad was also delicious. It was light. The dressing wasn't too much. And it had some kind of tangy cheese thrown into it, which I was a huge fan of.  Next out was some kind of steak with bleu cheese with chips and stuffed mushrooms. The chips were crisp and browned, just as I like them. The steak was cooked perfectly - the waiter said the chef usually cooks it medium, but we can choose how we like it cooked. We told him however the chef recommends, we will do that! The bleu cheese was a bit much, though, so both my friend and I scraped it off. The mushrooms were stuffed with spinach and cheese of some kind and topped with bread crumbs. They were cooked to perfection. Still had a little bite to them but the mixture inside- YUM! Next up was a short rib of some kind with mashed potatoes and onion bulbs. The short rib melted in your MOUTH. I can't remember the taste of the sauce off the top of my head, but holy COW- it was delicious. The mashed potatoes were creamy and whipped. And the onion bulbs were soft but crisp at the edges.  The paella came out last of the food. It was warm and a flavor explosion. The rice was divine, and it had chicken pieces and green pepper in it. At this point I was pretty full, so I ate the chicken and green peppers out of it with some of the rice. I had a lot left over, but whatever! Still glad I ordered it.  I needed a wheelbarrow at this point, but we decided to indulge in a flourless chocolate cake dessert. It was the PERFECT size. Very small. But that sucker was DENSE. Very rich chocolate. It had the texture of fudge. And it came with some kind of whipped cream thing. Goodness. I couldn't help myself. I ate a few bites, although I was full.  My friend got an iced latte, and he said it was also good.  They were busy, and our server was pretty busy, as well. Usually, I don't like when servers don't check on you often, but honestly the type of intimate environment in there calls for slow service. It's a place that you go to relax, slowly eat, drink, chat, etc. When our server did stop by, he was friendly, helped answer any questions we had, etc. The only thing that I noticed was when we asked for recommendations, I felt like he pulled an answer out of his ass and didn't really give a genuine response. With that said, we had a GREAT experience here. Tapas can get very pricey, so be prepared to spend a lot.

Despite being a rainy Tuesday night the restaurant was packed at around 8 pm, and this is a really huge space too! The hostess was nice enough to show me to my friends' table. Apparently they had just moved the whole group because the room they were in started leaking/flooding due to the torrential downpour. More on that later... My group downed several pitchers of their sangria (red and peach) throughout dinner. Both were good! We ordered a ton of food. Pardon my ignorance on the names because I was not in charge of ordering. We had burrata with green sauce and corn, cheesy bread with a red sauce, huge potatoes with an orange sauce, sausage plates, beef short rib and two plates of the pork paella. Everything was outstanding! Each tapa is good to share among 3-4 people (assuming you're going to order multiple) and the paellas are huge servings. I literally couldn't get enough of just about every dish. They will also bring you as much free bread as you can possibly eat. What really added the finishing touch was our waitress brought out a complimentary platter with 5 of their desserts to make up for the moving rooms/flooding incident. The butterscotch one was really tasty.The manager came and checked on us and apologized at the end of the meal as well. Awesome environment with high class service and absolutely delicious food!

We went down the street and had drinks while we waited. There are a million amazing sounding items on the menu so we did what I'm sure most people do and way over ordered. Our server was great and did finally advise us to slow our roll a bit. We all got to giggling as food just kept coming and coming. Highlights for me were the short rib dish and the seafood paella but there wasn't anything I tried that I didn't like. We got a great wine suggestion from our server as well. Overall a great and memorable dining experience. BTW, I'd highly recommend coming here with a group so you can really explore the menu - I definitely wouldn't have felt like I got the full experience if I had only tried 1 or 2 dishes.",0.9823,0.769,0.201,0.029,0.5658888888888889

2015-08-11,5.0,"We came here on a Sunday for brunch around 11 am. The restaurant was larger than I had expected and there were plenty of empty tables, but these began filling up as we were leaving around noon. Despite its size, it's still quite cozy and has great ambiance. I can't speak to the authenticity of the food, but we were definitely impressed, particularly by the sausage-fried paella rice. Still reminiscing about the perfectly charred sausage bits. The poached egg on top makes it acceptable for breakfast, and when mixed in, makes the rice so creamy! We also ordered the pinxtos platter which was gorgeously presented on a wooden paddle, and the buttermilk waffle with marcona almond, nutella and bananas. You can definitely taste the salt in their french toast and waffles, but the sweet syrup balances it out nicely. My boyfriend tried their Bloody Mary bar which was a lot of fun! You get to choose from a glass of vodka/bourbon/gin/tequila and add your own juice and add-ins. They have everything from your classic celery stick to bacon strips to cocktail shrimp on skewers. Would recommend if you like Bloody Marys. In the middle of our meal, we ordered the buttermilk-fried chicken thighs from their limited dinner menu. This took a few extra minutes to come out compared to the rest of our dishes (which were brought to our table within 10 minutes of ordering). The chicken was good with a tangy sauce that made for a nice contrast, but nothing spectacular. Our waitress apologized several times for the delay, and also brought us complimentary desserts (pear sorbet and caramelized banana). Ended our meal on a sweet note. Needless to say, impressive service! I love that you get to try a variety of food without breaking the bank. Everything is very reasonably priced and some of the portions are quite substantial. I can't wait to go back to try their other menus (especially the other paella varieties).",0.9973,0.747,0.216,0.037,0.5664111498257838

He promised it tasted authentic and I couldn't wait to try! It did not disappoint!! We ordered the croquetas, buratta, garlic potato salad and paella con pollo y verduras. I have absolutely no complaints. It was all so good! The croquetas came with a blend of ham and chicken. They were crispy and delicious! I especially loved the garlic potato salad. It was a simple dish that was packed with garlicky flavor! (tip: you might not want to order this if you're on a first date).  The paella was perfect! I'm usually picky about whether or not the flavors are right or the rice is quality but this was everything and more. A server brings out the paella in a large pan and mixes it at your table. The portions are then served out and they are huge! You have to order a minimum of two servings but if you're getting tapas as well, the two servings could easily feed more than two people! So delicious! Oh and how could I forget about the drinks! We ordered half a pitcher of white sangria between the two of us and it was the perfect refreshing addition to our meal.  Make sure to check in on yelp to get a free dessert. I was obsessed with the caramel custard.

I always end up getting two orders, because they're just TOO good.  *One thing to keep in mind though--it is a *sharing* experience. They are small plates so that they can be nibbled upon by each party member. The only buzzkill I've ever experienced were my own dinner guests trying to bogart their order and fuss over the bill =) The sangria. OH my goodness the sangria! The passion fruit sangria is my favorite. The real fruit marinating in booze the whole time is such a great palate cleanser (and kicker). The service is similarly wonderful; every hostess/waiter/waitress/busser that I have spoken to (keep in mind, I frequent this place monthly) was very pleasant and had a smile ready--even in the worst of the dinner rushes. I have even been offered free desserts a couple times because the staff recognizes me from previous outings, and wanted to ""pay me back"" for my patronage. How cool are these guys?! Prices are very fair. I always expect to pay much more than I do, probably because I leave so satisfied, that I feel compelled to give them ALL of my money...

I recommend getting a pitcher because it is reasonably priced around $20 and pours about 6/7 glasses. The menu is pretty big so if you are adventurous with food, you should order a variety of plates and try as many as you can because I think everything is good. In particular, I love the calamari with aiolli sauce and the warm goat cheese with marinara sauce. The restaurant has a semi-outdoor patio, which is very pleasant so I recommend trying to get a table in that part. If not, inside is good, too!

If you really want to be stuffed, get the paella; they claim one order serves two, but the serving size is way bigger. I liked the seafood paella because the bay scallops are so soft and tender; however, my cousins liked the chicken.  DRINKS: Mango sangria, end of story. There's fruit - it's healthy.

Tapas are good to get a fresh start. We chose the house favorite, two are a little more for two persons because neither of us finished the rice after that. But the food was great and the atmosphere was fantastic. This is the most popular restaurant around Lincoln Park. So if you are around, I will recommend this restaurant.",0.9889,0.674,0.326,0.0,0.643939393939394
2015-07-14,5.0,"I have been here several times and have had a great experience every time. True Spanish style tapas with all the dishes I had when I was in Spain recently. The tapas I can't say no to are the: brussel sprouts salad, stuffed mushrooms, chorizo wrapped dates (seriously you MUST order these), goat cheese dip, and olives. The most recent time I had the beef and chicken empanadas and they were good but I could take them or leave them. The calamari is pretty good too. I don't know that you can really go wrong with any of the food though! I usually end up getting a pitcher or 2 of sangria while I'm there which is good but a little sugary for my liking. The ambiance is great, the service is friendly and you will definitely have a great time at this restaurant!!",0.9903,0.704,0.261,0.035,0.5483333333333333

The service was well organized and we were seated for our reservation early and approached by our server immediately. The menu consisted of 50-60 items in true Tapas style.  There were micro-bites that cost $1 a piece. We started with one of each. They were all delicious. We then started ordering regular tapas. Blue Cheese steak was one of the stand-outs, we ordered some ceviche dish that was great. Honestly all of the tapas were crafted with care and tasted awesome.  I returned a second time with a larger group and had a 5 star experience yet again. This place is boss.

2015-07-12,5.0,"Quick Summary --- Delicious tapas at a great price with consistently some of the best service I've experienced in any restaurant. As with any popular Chicago spot, reservations are highly recommended, as walk-in wait time can be long, but once sat, service is incredibly fast. Highly recommended: #44 (shrimp with garlic), #67 (bacon wrapped dates), seafood paella, and any flavor of sangria. Intro --- This has become my favorite restaurant in Chicago, and my 5-star rating isn't a case of severe fanboyism, but is a distinction well-earned through repeated visits. I've been to Spain and loved the food there, so I was very excited to try. The first time I went was with a couple friends, and I was very impressed with the quality of food, drinks, and service. It's not the most authentic Spanish cuisine, but the inspiration and heart is there. Setting --- Very warm and cozy. However, the restaurant is huge and there's so much activity going on around it can be loud and hectic. Added bonus: hanging Iberican hams for that authentic Spanish touch! Service --- Despite the craziness of all that's going on during a busy night, my table has never been neglected or forgotten. Food comes out in blazing fast times after ordering. The bussers are attentive in clearing your dishes and refilling your drinks. Everyone seems happy to serve you. Food --- There are so many different tapas, I will highlight the ones I've particularly enjoyed. Roast dates with bacon & apple vinaigrette: Bacon wrapped dates has been overdone to oblivion but the apple vinaigrette is a nice complement that sets it apart. Second-best bacon wrapped dates I've had (sorry Ba-Ba-Reeba, but the honor of #1 goes to Avec!) Seafood paella: Has a generous amount of shrimp, scallops, and monkfish. I despise green beans but I don't even care that they're in this dish, it's absolutely delicious. The rice has the perfect consistency. Burrata with tomatoes, charred sweet corn, and avocado: A great marriage between all the different ingredients. The char on the corn brings an appreciated depth to the dish, and the cheese is very fresh. Vibrant and light! Shrimp with garlic: They are unapologetic with the garlic. A blast of flavor will spread over your entire palette as you meditate on the texture of the perfectly cooked shrimp. Dip your bread in the leftover oil. It is liquid gold. Caramelized banana: I can inhale ten orders of these if I wanted to. All desserts here are delicious but this one in particular is fantastic. Great toasty flavor from the caramel while never overpowering the banana. Texture contrast provided by pistachios. Temperature contrast provided by the ice cream. A delight to the senses. Sangria: I hate sangria. I love Ba-Ba-Reeba's sangria. Five great permanent flavors with a rotating seasonal flavor. Do yourself a favor and get a pitcher... for yourself. Other notes --- What? They have a brunch you say? Admittedly I have not gone there for brunch service. I will have to make the effort to try it out. Check out their rewards program. Though Lettuce Entertain You does require money up front, you receive credit through your first several visits to make up for it. Conclusion --- I applaud the staff at Ba-Ba-Reeba, both front-of-house and back-of-house. It is a well-tuned machine that operates efficiently amidst all the chaos. Great service, great food, great memories. If you haven't tried Spanish food, Ba-Ba-Reeba is a great place to go. Have guests coming into Chicago? Hot date? Casual night out? Whatever the occasion, Ba-Ba-Reeba is sure to please. Grade --- (1* - never come back, 2* - poor, 3* - good, 4* - excellent, 5* - perfect) Ba-Ba-Reeba gets a 5*. Way to go!",0.9996,0.685,0.28,0.035,0.637660406885759

We also had the vanilla chai bourbon desert tapa which had tasty ice cream but the fig cookie was subpar. Ordered a double shot espresso got a single by accident then they brought out an adtl double for free. Some of the other bartenders seemed loss and over staffed since we were checked over every 3 mins.

Our favorites: -Goat Cheese baked in tomato sauce- served with crusty bread -Burrata with heirloom tomato and charred sweet corn- what summertime dreams are made of. -Brussel sprout salad- shaved sprouts, toasted nuts, cheese. Fresh and delicious!  -the short rib dish (prep varies, but always delicious) -calamari fritti-- super light and crispy batter -The Chocolate Truffle Cake dessert and the Butterscotch pot de creme are dreamy.

Service was great we were served drinks almost immediately upon sitting down and had food orders in shortly after. There were three of us and we each ordered three tapas items from the menu.

However, the food was disappointing in both taste and quantity for the price.  We started with sangrias: too much ice, but the flavor was pleasing. Short rib was well cooked and soft, but had a weird taste to it. Mashed potatoes on the side tasted like they were made from powder and not from scratch. 3 small to medium scallops for $13...do i need to say more? Garlic shrimp were fresh and tasty. This was about $10 for 6 medium shrimps. We also ordered streak with blue cheese and potato chips on the side, which was just ok, a little too dry for my taste. Overall, don't come here if you are hungry. We left the table starving after paying $80. Never again! There are better tapas places in town if you are craving that.

All the while, the bartender had an entire 3 people sitting at the bar top. Oh, he was washing glasses too. I know that's important. Anyway, we continued to bother a different server for refills on our drinks. He seemed less than amused to help us, but still nice enough to oblige. Food finally arrived and was pretty decent, but not up to the standard that I had been served here 3-4 times in the past. Bacon wrapped dates were burnt and a our French toast was brought out, placed on the bar, left for 10 minutes, then retrieved and served to us as if it had not been sitting around misplaced for 10-15 minutes.

The filling was super smooth and flavorful and the crispy jamon made this over-the-top; we ordered a second round of deviled eggs because they're THAT good. -Iberico Ham Hash: I shamelessly have a serious love for canned corned beef hash and this dish is the luxe, pimped up version of a childhood favorite.  The poached egg soaks into all the crispy bits of ham and potato and oh my word that HAM.  Iberico Jamon is generally regarded as the best ham in the world so yeah, it's DECADENT.  -Baked Eggs with Romescu Sauce: definitely one of the more unique (and beautiful!) egg dishes I've had which is served with a red pepper sauce from Catalonia. Hearty and healthy! -Citrus French Toast with goat cheese butter: a slightly lightened up version of traditional French toast and it's a great balance of sweet, tangy, and zesty Don't forget to wash everything down with a pitcher of their sangria! This place is perfect for groups and people of all ages, there was even a brunch wedding reception taking place when we were there!  So yes, be sure to roll in with a large entourage.  The more, the merrier at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba!",0.9971,0.699,0.263,0.038,0.5688792688792689

The garlic shrimp was something I could have easily made at home. They do have some exceptional items but for the most part I was disappointed.  The desserts were the best part of the meal.

2015-06-01,4.0,"I lurvvv you. To prove my feelings for you, I've brought every visitor I've had here AND have introduced coworkers to you. Going to a subpar overpriced tapas place in San Francisco just made me appreciate you that much more.  The prices here are very reasonable. A pitcher of sangria was under $25. They weren't very strong but they were still delicious and filled with fruit. Portions are very reasonable. Before you know it, you're completely stuffed. I've tried a number of items on their menu. My three must haves here are the brussel sprout salad, tortilla espanola, and paella. The paella is huge and two servings was definitely more than enough for five of us. Unless the paella is your entree and you have no desire to try anything else on their menu, I would use 2-3 people per serving of paella as a guide. Food is flavored very well, cooked well, and came out hot. The spicy garlic shrimp was truly garlicky. I don't normally like squid but even that was delicious. It wasn't gummy or tough. It was tender and while I still don't like squid, I would try it again.  If you need further proof of how truly stellar this restaurant is, it won over my 70 year aunt and 60 year old mom, who both gravitates towards Asian food. Not only did they love cafe ba-ba-reeba, this place trumped ALL restaurants that I had brought them to during their trip here. They even ranked this above the three Asian-inspired places that I thought would rock their world. Two weeks after my visit here, I brought my mom to a tapas place in San Francisco.

We ordered the brussels sprout salad, spicy potatoes with tomato aioli, garlic potato salad, the short run with manchego mashed potatoes, citrus cured salmon, grilled iberico pork shoulder, and the paella valenciana. I also got the mango sangria which I loved since it didn't have a strong wine taste to it.

My party of 5 came here for dinner around 6 PM and the wait for a table was about 45 minutes so we decided to just grab a table at the bar area. The tables at the bar area is first come, first serve and they still offer the entire menu of the restaurant. Shortly after we ordered our food, I got a text saying our table was ready on the restaurant side but we decided not to move.  We ordered a bunch of food and it all came out very quickly besides the paella, which the waiter did warn us that it would take about 30-40 minutes to cook. We also got the peach sangria 1/2 pitcher to split between 4 people and that was more than enough. It was so yummy and not too strong at all. Citrus Salmon: It was a spread of salmon with citrusy round thing and you eat it with the bread that's provided. It was interesting and I love salmon so it was a new twist to it. Pork Skewer: DELICIOUS, I wished we had more of it. Juicy and very flavorful. It came it two skewers with about 3 cubes of meat on the skewer so it was just enough for each of us. Scallop Empanada: My friends and I loved this dish! The filling of the empanada just melts in your mouth.  Sea Scallops: I personally thought this was a bit too bland for my liking.  Octopus: LOVED this dish. I thought the octopus was grilled just perfectly and it was deliciously seasoned, not too overpowering in taste.  Short Ribs: This piece of meat was just heaven, it melts in your mouth and oh so succulent. The mashed potatoes that came with it was one of the best I've ever had! Paella: the paella came out right on time, shortly after we finished all the tapas and had a few minutes to digest the food a bit. It is a minimum of two orders and it was just enough to split between five people. I likd the paella but I was a bit full towards the end so I didn't enjoy it as much as I could have. DESSERTS: Yelp had a super awesome offer of a free dessert w/ check in so we got 3 orders: Flan, apple empanada, and the banana one; our favorite ranked as Banana, apple empanada, flan. But TBH, they were alll very yummy! The total bill for the seven orders and sangria came out to roughly $27 a person after tax and tip, which is reasonable (considering we got free desserts!!). It is better to eat with a bigger group so you can try a bit of everything.  PRO: +free parking across the street, if you're lucky +they will text you when your table is ready +bar area is first come, first serve so snatch an open table if you see one +great service, great food, yummy drinks! +FREE desserts w/ Yelp check in and they don't limit the amount of free desserts/table so get everyone at your table to check in!!",0.9991,0.775,0.21,0.015,0.5636865407319954

The paella was rather good and not too heavy.  We ordered about one plate per person at the table plus an order of the chicken paella, and it was far more than enough--almost too much.

2015-04-25,3.0,"Look Mommy! Pig legs hanging from the ceiling! Just like in Spain! This used to be my favourite restaurant--it reminded me of Spain. I even had my bachelor's party at the (doomed) Las Vegas outpost because I liked it so much, even after moving across the country. I've eaten here with my parents, friends, and colleagues over the past 25 years. The last time I was here my daughter was 4 months old, this time she was 4.5 and I was able to take my son and husband (who has heard about the place for over a decade).  The original menu changed 11 years ago. Rice balls were added, the fantastic gazpacho and seafood ceviche, gone. Gabino's hand-laid brick patio has been gone awhile too, as are the terra cotta sangria pitchers and cheap goblets.  It's certainly more chic now, which I'm sure appeals to the local Trixies.  The vibe is different. It's not just because I'm old and there's progress, it's now, well, kind of blah & mainstream. The service remains top notch--fast refills, friendly, on it.  It's a well oiled machine that just works, but why were the kids given hummus & carrots? I'd expect chickpeas, but hummus? They loved the bread and oil, but hummus? In Madrid & Barcelona they weren't served hummus. I also question why the bacon wrapped dates were deliberately made soggy with the citrus vinaigrette--just put them on a plate. Stab an apple with the toothpick, if you like, but never, EVER make bacon soggy. That's just not fair to the pig. The beef was perfect, as expected. The octopus tasted like fish sauce. I remember trying a Spanish restaurant in NYC which marinated its pork in fish sauce, and didn't get it then. I'm not offended by nuoc mam, but seriously, what is it doing in my Spanish meal? My 2 year old, however, loved the Vietnamese infused octopus, and ate most of it. Sadly, my favourite dish was the lamb with mint sauce and ratatouille. Greek & French, but absolutely delicious. The shrimp skewers and mushroom bruschetta were also quite good. Toasted bread w/tomato caviar, cheese, and jamon were as expected. My husband loved the fried banana dessert & the kids loved the chocolate mousse. Sangria is still great. I am, however, glad they haven't changed things so much as to serve tortilla chips. My standards for Spanish restaurants remains high because I love Spain--it's where I stopped being a vegetarian because everything smelled so good that I just HAD to eat it. All of it. We spent a week there last year, will be returning this year. Sadly, I don't expect to return to Cafe Ba Ba Reeba on my next visit to Chicago. Maybe it was having the two managers stare and point at my table during what was supposed to be our relaxing final night in Chicago, or maybe it was the food, which is more pan-Mediterranean than Spanish. Hummus?  The servers, bussers, and rest of the staff remain friendly & efficient--you will not have to worry about not having your water glass refilled or having too much food served at the wrong time instead of in stages. Allergies are taken seriously.  The food is good and the service spectacular, it's just no longer Spanish.  $125 before tip",0.9975,0.778,0.173,0.049,0.5101884920634921

While the brunch menu is extensive, the food quality is a bit meh.  I would say the best part of the brunch would be the Bloody Mary bar, which is a good value and has all of the standards you would expect. I do recommend the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, but stay away from the shrimp and grits; it's not at all what you think it's gonna be. Also, the chicken and waffle stick is more like a chicken sausage corn dog; again not what one would expect from reading the name of it on the menu. There is good value here, as 4 can do brunch, get 10 plates, and all run the Bloody Mary bar for about $150 total including tip, but nothing is going to floor you, though the spicy potatoes with tomato aioli would be another one of the better items. If you do show up, bring your appetite as the portion sizes are for the most part generous for what you pay.  Again, Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! isn't bad, but it isn't great and doesn't seem to have the couple of standout dishes you can typically expect from places in the city.

Patatas bravas are hot and crispy on the outside but tender on the inside, aioli is perfect (not spicy for my taste.). Goat cheese in tomato sauce is served with buttered toast. Complimentary bread is sliced fresh with a soft inside and crisp crust. Pan con tomate is crisp bread with the perfect amount of tomato but could've used more garlic in my opinion. Shrimp (gambas al ajillo) in olive oil and garlic with red pepper flakes was my favorite. Dip your bread in it!  Seafood paella was just ok but nice that they sub chicken for monkfish. Rioja short rib was delish. Would NOT rec tortilla espanola, although it came out piping hot it was like a round hash brown that was soggy? Calamari was usual.

2015-04-06,4.0,"I am a fan of tapas, and it being both Easter and my cousin's birthday, I thought it would be fun, so I decided on Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba for our family brunch.  We had a reservation and were seated promptly in the back room (where I worried that we may be neglected), but it was no problem. Our waiter and the bus boys were very attentive, and the pace was good. The only thing we had to ask for constantly was water, because the glasses were so small and a few people in our party were only having water. For larger parties where this is the case, leaving a pitcher of water on the table would be best. (Or at least larger glasses!) My husband and my mom enjoyed the bloody mary bar ($10 for just one trip), while I tried the special sangria which was blood orange and just OK. ($8). We enjoyed: the spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms (yummy!), brussel sprout salad (both crunchy and flavorful), beef tenderloin and blue cheese (a definite hit!!), chicken skewer, shrimp in olive oil and garlic, beef benedict, and the seared sea scallops. My daughter loved the chicken empanada, and I was the only one at the table who liked the potato and onion omelet. Of the above listed, the beef tenderloin was definitely a family favorite. We ordered two of those ($11 each), and they were cooked perfectly with the right amount of pink, juicy and tender. My husband is a former chef so he can be hard to please, but he was impressed by the presentation and the demi glazes and other sauces that accompanied the dishes. Most everything was flavorful and appealing to the pallet.  Missing the mark were the scallop empanada (the scallops were buried in all the bread, while the seared scallops were much better), and the grilled flank steak, which was tough. The fingerling potatoes that came with it were good, although that was $9 wasted for such a small, disappointing dish. My cousin also ordered the citrus cured salmon, and was disappointed because it was flattened and thin like paper. Thinner than even smoked salmon usually is, and I think he was expecting a filet, even if it was a tapas-sized one. Yet for our first try, this was not bad.  My husband ordered the veal special and while he was skeptical, it was very tender and cooked to perfection. Our only concern was that it was $17. That's pricey for a small tapas portion!  There was another group seated behind us, and one of the servers gave us their deviled egg by mistake. We ate it before we realized, and we actually would have ordered more if we weren't so overwhelmed by everything else that we had. It was good! I liked the dessert menu and the fact that those are all $3 each. We got one free dessert for checking in on Yelp, and we ordered another one to sing Happy Birthday to my cousin. We ended up getting that one taken off the bill as well, which was nice. I wanted to try one of their coffees, but decided to wait until next time.  We thoroughly enjoyed our visit, and I'm only deducting one star for a few dishes and some of the priciness. Since it's all tapas, people are going to order a lot anyway, so prices for each item should be reasonable. Our bill was $190 before tip for 5 of us. Now that we know what we like, future trips can be planned a bit better. I see a date night with hubby in our future.",0.9982,0.759,0.178,0.063,0.5557208994708995

Add a beer back for $1. Order a pitcher of sangria to share with some friends. The tapas were all so good. My favorite was the grilled octopus. I never knew octopus could be so soft to the point that it melts in your mouth. The fried calamari were great. Bacon wrapped dates give you something salty and something sweet. Lamb kabob was tasty.

2015-03-30,5.0,"¡Caramba! Glad we chose Cafe Ba-Ba-Ree-Ba! for brunch today while in the city.  While it looks deceptively small from the outside, you'll find that the space goes back...and back...and back some more, and then to the side into another big dining room. In a city where it can be hard to find a seat for brunch, they welcomed us with open arms at prime brunch time: no wait, yay! This is a tapas place, so as long as you don't mind sharing you can choose a bunch of things and have a taste of each. It works well with two diners; not quite sure how it goes for tables of eight (such as the noisy one that arrived halfway through our meal.) At brunch time you can choose from the Brunch or Lunch menus, but there so many tempting things among the Brunch options that we just held fast. As two people with inquisitive appetites, we ordered bits of this and that and it was pretty uniformly great.  In (roughly) order of fave to least fave: - Let me start by mentioning the bread at the beginning of the meal: crusty, toasted and served with butter and marmalade. Starting the meal with this assured good things in the future...but don't fill up too much because there's more to come!! - Citrus French Toast with Goat cheese butter and honey. This was a wonderful amalgam of flavors: sweet citrus against the tang of the goat cheese, all smoothed over with a drizzle of honey. Delicious!! - Bacon-wrapped dates. This is a tapas classic, and it's not hard to see why. These tiny morsels combine the best qualities of smoky and sweet. - My dining partner got the mini Cubano, which he adored; I had a bit of the meat, but pork just isn't my favorite thing. - Waffle-battered Chicken Stick. This is seemingly a chicken sausage stick; some sort of sausage at least was encased by the sweet batter. Sounded like it was going to be a version of chicken and waffles; ended up being more of a Spanish corn dog. - The traditional Spanish rice dish paella was spicy with chorizo and studded with veggies. I avoided the poached egg, so he got to enjoy its combo of fluffy white and oozing yolk himself. - Spinach and artichoke crepe. This was spinach-heavy but also filled with mushrooms and cheese. Yum. - Bacon mac and cheese. Thin but delicious cheesy sauce, with strips of crisp bacon on top. Tasty though paled compared to other things. - Surprisingly, the thing I liked least was a dish I usually love: shrimp and grits. Their spin used chorizo-flavored polenta in place of the grits (I should mention that this menu is loaded with chorizo in general, so if you don't care for sausage your options are somewhat limited.) The shrimp were what is described as ""Spanish baby ghost shrimp,"" which turned out to be half-inch-long minnow-looking things. The tiny pinpoint black eyes on each is clearly visible, which disturbed me somewhat. Tasted okay, but would not order again. Daniel, our server, was friendly, explained things well, and checked up on us so we could order more. Also a shout-out to the tireless bussers who whisked away the tiny used plates with speed and refilled water frequently but unobtrusively. The restaurant is moody with dark wood, but the bathrooms were weird: industrial stainless steel with almost no light in the stalls!  Overall though, this was a thoroughly enjoyable meal. ¡Arriba!

In general I love this place so I gave it 4 stars, but my experience this weekend was not the best.  I made reservations over a month ago for 7pm on Saturday. We were 4 people and 1 friend got there right at 7 (traffic due to St. Pattys and all that). They told her once 1/2 the party was there they would sit her. Great. Around 7:05, another friend arrived. My friend went back to the hostess and let her know and was then told the table wasn't ready and that they would text her when it was. I arrived at this point, as did our 4th person so we waited for a bit. At 7:30, I went up to the stand and asked about our table. I gave my name and was then asked if I was on the wait list because they didn't see my reservation. Now, I called earlier in the week to confirm and my friend checked in and they gave her no problem so I am not sure what happened. I said no, we had a reservation. The hostesses started talking and I think what happened was that it seemed like they skipped right over us. She did apologize and said she would get us seated as soon as she could. Finally around 7:45, the host sat us. He also apologized for the mix up but at this point we had waited 45 minutes past our reservation and were starving. Our server was very good at first, but then we saw her less and less. She only came over if she was bringing us food. We had a lot of plates that needed to be cleared away and the table was getting very crowded. My other complaint is that we were seated at a table in the back near the bathrooms but in the corner next to some sort of door and my chair kept pushing up against the stair/ledge near it and it was very annoying.  The food was great as usual. Bacon wrapped dates, smoked salmon, spicy potato salad and the goat cheese are my go-tos and all tasted wonderful. I also had the blood orange sangria which was very good.  I know I will be back, but I will have to try to come back during the week when it is hopefully less busy and people are more attentive.

Neither of us had been here before, but we'd heard good things about it. We came on a Monday night, and expected it to be pretty empty. We were quite wrong! You'd never know that is was a Monday night here. There were lots of people there and the place was kicking! We got a table in the back area. The décor of the entire place was GORGEOUS. There was art on the walls, dim lighting, candles in Mason jars - everything was just so perfect!  Our server was super helpful and explained the menu to us. We ordered the deviled egg tapa and patatas bravas to start with. They were both great! To drink, we both had the sangria. It was not super strong..it was more sweet (but that's how I like it!). For our entrée, we ordered the Paella with pork. We were surprised at how fast it was done. The menu said 45 minutes, but we're almost certain it was a shorter wait than that. It was super filling and delicious. Lots of great flavors and smells came from the Paella!  For dessert, we ordered the chocolate truffle cake and the Butterscotch Caramel Custard. The desserts might have been my favorite part of the evening. DO NOT leave here without getting dessert! The portions of the desserts were very small, and that surprised us at first. Once we tasted each one, we knew why they were small. The desserts were SO amazingly sweet and rich, we could only handle a little bit of them! I think that's why the portions come smaller. The custard was just phenomenal with the caramel and the cake literally tasted like (and had the consistency of) chocolate fudge. Heck, I'll go as far to say that this place is worth a trip just for the dessert alone! Yes, it was THAT good. Our server packed up our leftovers (we had paella leftovers - we ate all the desserts!) and gave us our bill.

The garlic salad - flavorful, perfect consistency, nice large chunks of potato. Spinach mushrooms - I waited to have these so they were a bit cold when I got to them, but they were perfectly cooked. No juice flying out when I cut into it, nice filling. Chicken and chorizo skewers - big chunks of juicy meat. Can't go wrong. My favorite dish was the salmon and kale - again, juicy and flavorful, the kale was such a good pairing. If I remember correctly, it had a bit of a crunch (or at least wasn't soggy) and just awesome. A lot of pieces in each plate, too, so everyone had a good portion of fish on their plate. Of the desserts - they were all excellent - my favorite was the flan. Sweet, creamy, just perfect.

The last time we went we did not make reservations, and we ended up waiting an hour and forty five minutes for a table (but that should tell you it's worth it).  The black raspberry sangria is absolutely delicious. The atmosphere is very fun and lively.

The desserts are just as good as the tapas, if not better. The rundown: Definites:  - Spicy potatoes with tomato aioli. I can't get enough of this one. My favorite dish.  - Beef tenderloin and blue cheese. Very tasty. - Chicken and ham croquetas. These almost taste like street food or something from a fair. Very, very good but also a bit heavy.  - Dark chocolate crema with orange marmalade. This dessert is fantastic, but it is only a few bites.  - Butterscotch custard with salted caramel sauce. WOW. This one is delicious. So, so good.  Skip:  -Manchego stuffed mushrooms. Very bland and generic, almost like they come frozen. I've had way better.  -Meatballs with sherry sauce.

I would tell all my friends that this is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Everything was absolutely delicious! However....I came here tonight and was shocked that the place was half empty! In the past I would have had to make a reservation weeks in advance! Tonight I made the reservation  2 hours before for a 7pm dinner.  So.. Not sure if the head chef was on vacation but my favorite dishes just tasted differently. The spicy potatoes were good! That was the only dish that didn't change. I was disappointed with the bread that came along with the goat cheese & tomato sauce. The croquetas had no flavor! The flank steak was blah. Lastly the Caramelized banana was ok. I really hope I came on an off night! I will return hoping that this place goes back to the 5 star restaurant I know it is!  Service is always exceptional!,0.9785,0.779,0.174,0.047,0.5917989417989418

I went here for a much needed girls' night the other weekend and it was a great experience. We got a pitcher of red sangria (naturally) and thoroughly enjoyed it. I also tried a taster of the pear sangria which would be perfect as a refreshing summer drink.  For food, I think few tapas places rival Café Ba-Ba-Reeba in terms of the variety. At other tapas places I feel like there is too much of an emphasis on heavy meat and cheese laden dishes but not so at Café Ba-Ba-Reeba. There are tapas for everyone, whether you're vegetarian, dairy free, gluten free, etc, you will be able to find something on their menu. That being said, we tried a bit of everything: spicy potatoes, short rib, sautéed vegetables, smoked salmon, and more. My favorite by far was the smoke salmon- it was so light and bursting with flavor. Our server was great and very helpful when making menu suggestions. She explained that the menu at Café Ba-Ba-Reeba changes often, but the smoked salmon always stays on, and now I know why!

Although the portion is small, the acorn-fed iberico pork is unlike any other pork I've had, and is the most memorable dish I've tried. The bacon-wrapped date pintxo also knocks it out of the park. Other hits include the paella valenciana, patatas bravas, grilled octopus, beef tenderloin, chorizo-stuffed dates.

Roast Dates with Bacon and Apple Vinaigrette. Still my favorite dish here. Vinaigrette is not overpowering at all. Delicious! 3. Fried potatoes had a nice kick to it. It could have been a little more crispy or fried. But the tomato aioli paired nicely with it. 4. Rioja-Braised Short Ribs - Pretty tender but pretty bland. Could have done without this dish. 5. Deviled Egg Pintxos - Incredibly salty. 6. Paella Valenciana was a tad too 'al dente' for me. It's unfortunate that if you're here on a date and want to try this, you must get a minimum of 2 servings. Two servings is enough for about 4-5 people, and with all those tapas to order, well you do the math. I was so stuffed I never wanted to eat again. 7. Butterscotch - My usual go-to-dessert from here, which is topped with salted caramel (hella salty, bleh) and a dollop of whipped cream. The butterscotch itself was pretty delicious. Overall, this experience fell very short of the previous times I visited. Maybe it was an off night but it was enough to de-throne them from my 'Favorite Restaurants in Chicago' list.

We started off with the bacon wrapped dates, spicy potatoes, goat cheese and short ribs and put in the order for the pork paella. All the tapas were delicious! The short ribs melted in our mouths! When the paella came, it looked a bit burnt but we decided not to say anything. As soon as we started eating, we could definitely taste the burnt rice that were super crunchy and the meats were bitter. I'm not the type of person to send the food back but it was my boyfriend's first time trying tapas and I wasn't gonna let him have this paella! It was already 11:00pm and when the server came we explained the situation. He looked at the paella and was very accommodating on taking it back and offered to whip up another serving. We were already tired and opted for two different tapas - seared spanish sausage and beef skewers. Sausages were on point, but the beef skewer was also very burnt and tasted bitter.  We ate it nonetheless and got the caramelized banana for desert (yay yelp checkin!) The service got slow at the end but it could be due to having too many people? Not sure.

There were three of us when we came in, so we got to try at least one of everything on the restaurant week menu, which was great at only $22 per person for four courses. For the appetizer course, there was the option of either a brussel sprout salad or chorizo chickpea soup. I ordered the salad, which was great! The crunch from the almonds was a nice touch. Then for the first tapas course, we had two ordered of the tortilla espanola and one for the patatas bravas. LOVED the aioli with the patatas bravas. They had a fantastic spice. The tortilla espanola was probably my favorite thing from the whole meal. It came with some kind of sour cream that went together perfectly with the warm potato omelette. For the second tapa we had the chicken and chorizo skewer, the flank steak, and the garlic shrimp. The steak was very tender and had a great sauce and the chicken and chorizo were great! Even though the chorizo wasn't spicy, it still had a great flavor. However, the garlic shrimp was fantastic; definitely a favorite of that course. The garlic taste wasn't overpowering, and they were seasoned perfectly! For dessert, our waiter informed us that we could order any dessert, not just the ones off the dessert restaurant week menu. We ordered the caramel marcona almond bar, the carmelized banana with quince syrup and vanilla ice cream, and the apple empanada. The desserts came small and just perfect as to not be overly-filling. The caramel bar was heavenly! The thick, gooey caramel with the buttery crust was delish. The banana was our second favorite; the warm banana with the cold ice cream was a great combo. The apple empanada was tasty as well! Loved the warm apple in the light pastry.  Overall, we were super happy with our choice for restaurant week!

We were offered a restaurant week menu for $30 per person but opted to order off the regular menu. Each person picked one dish in each round and we did two or three rounds.  Here is my take on some of the dishes we tried.  Don't remember the names but I'll describe what it was. Ordered one mini pitcher of red Sangria and it served three ladies. The two guys had one beer each.  Sangria was good enough.  Spicy Potatoes - a great starter, with a yummy dipping sauce. A Lox platter - thinly sliced salmon, capers and sauce and tiny chunks of bread. Okay but not very flavorful. Needed a more robust sauce. Empanadas - we tried scallops and chicken. The chicken one was one of my favs of the evening. Very flavorful filling in a crusty puff pastry.  Majool dates wrapped in bacon - outstanding! Salami, prosciutto and swiss cheese platter - nothing special. Flank steak pinwheel - terrible, the beef was so tough. It was the only dish that did not get finished. Nobody wanted seconds. After that, we did not try another beef dish.  Goat cheese in tomato - another excellent choice.  Desserts - we tried the mini ice cream sandwiches, the macaroon bar and the caramelized bananas. By far the banana dish won in my opinion. It had a crispy layer of torched sugar on the top which really made the dish. Our bill was $136 including tip. That's about $30 per person (only one drink per person).  I think you pay for the experience of trying a lot of different dishes. This is not the place for you if you want a filling meal with lots of cocktails. If you do, be prepared to pay for it.  Overall, I am glad we tried it.

It is a large place that is always packed so a reservation is a must.  Two friends and myself has a 6pm reservation on a Saturday night and it was already pretty full. We ordered a pitcher of the Black Raspberry sangria and embraced the tapas style small plates. Their menu is large enough to please any dietary needs. At the same time, it is manageable and not too overwhelming. We ordered 6 plates for the three of us, and did not leave hungry. My three favorites were the spicy potatoes, chicken empenada, and Spanish sausages. I would order each of these dishes again. One of the things I was most impressed about was how our server did not rush us out the door even though the restaurant was packed. We lingered a little bit after paying our bill and ended up opening a second tab of drinks before calling it a night. Would definitely come back again. One of the most important things in order to have a positive experience is to go with a group of people willing to share and compromise on menu items.

2015-01-13,5.0,"I've been to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba a handful of times now and I always leave happy. It's one of the few tapas places that actually serves Spanish tapas. Seems the whole food industry is moving towards small plates but not serving Spanish tapas - just charging more for less food.  Pretty much every time I go to CBBR, I start with the same two dishes. Dates wrapped in bacon and tomato sauce with goat cheese. Yes, I admit, both dishes are incredibly simple, but both are delicious and staples of tapas food. The dates and bacon are heavenly. The goat cheese and tomato sauce is fine, not the best, but i think it's just one of those you have to try. Then I'll move onto some of the meat dishes. There are plenty and I've tried a great many, but I'll mention a couple. Specifically the rioja-braised short rib, skewered chicken and chorizo, and any of the squid. The skewered chicken and chorizo is especially good because that chorizo as absolutely top notch and it's only in a couple dishes. This most recent time we also tried the Paella. Wow, definitely getting it again. Order it the moment you sit down because it'll take a while to come out, but man, it's absolutely superb. I'm allergic to shellfish so we got the one with roasted pork, sausage, and pork belly. So much delicious flavor, cooked perfectly.",0.9958,0.741,0.227,0.032,0.5480530753968254

2015-01-11,3.0,"I went to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba! with a fun group of 14 people.  But I can't rate a restaurant based on the fact that my family is pretty darn awesome.  Sorry, CBBR. Our waiter was friendly and patient with our large group.  But one there are a few things I've learned from doing tapas with large groups:  Someone needs to take charge of the group, or everyone needs to chose 1-2 dishes, AND there mustn't be any picky eaters in the group.  CBBR is good for groups, even large groups, but without some guidelines and willingness to try different foods, there will be chaos. I'll detail what we ate and drank, but here's a spoiler alert:  I think CBBR is just okay, and I'm not likely to return. The Passion Fruit Sangria was good, but the Raspberry Sangria was pretty bad.  Once you mix vodka into wine, I don't think you can really call it sangria anymore.  I would've liked the fruit flavor to come from a fruit puree, or a schnapps/liquor before a flavored vodka. The complimentary bread and olive oil was a great way to satisfy our grumbling tummies as we waited for food.  If you are ordering paella, understand that it takes about 45 minutes and you must order it right away! But should you?  Eh, the paella was okay, and I've had better.  We had the seafood as well as the pork paella.  Both had great flavor, but the meat portion was skimpy, resulting in very disappointing dishes. My favorite tapa of the evening was the Cured Salmon.  Salmon, capers, cream, and pickled cucumbers - yum!  I also really liked the spicy potatoes. The bacon wrapped dates and baked goat cheese were also very good, but these are pretty much like ""Tapas 101,"" and I can't act like those two dishes make CBBR stand apart from any other tapas restaurant. The stuffed mushrooms were bland, flavorless, and hardly what I'd call ""stuffed.""  The octopus was horrible - it was burnt.  I spit it into a napkin! The desserts are so cute and perfect for only $3 - you get a few bites without overstuffing yourself.  I had the dark chocolate crema which was like a thick pudding. The set-up of the restaurant could be better.  Parking in the area isn't impossible.  We arrived shortly after 4:30 on a Saturday and got a spot on Halsted ($2/hour with a 3 hr max).  Otherwise, valet is available for $13. Inside the restaurant, tables are too close together, probably so they can pack 'em in whenever possible.  The chairs were uncomfortable - I don't think I've EVER said that about a restaurant.  There was nowhere to put my purse, and since it is winter and the floors were wet and muddy, I didn't want to put my purse on the floor.  I tried to stick my purse between two chairs in a dry spot, but the waiter kicked my purse every time he came to the table. I'd recommend reservations.  By the time we left around 7:00 p.m., it was a full house.  It is a little bit noisy in here, but I was able to hear my dining companions up to 3-4 seats down the table without shouting.   Each couple ended up spending about $35/person after several paellas, tapas, and sangria.  I can't say I was impressed.",0.9974,0.781,0.17,0.049,0.6212178932178933

The service was still great, but the food was pretty mediocre. It seemed like the food had been cooked in a large batch earlier and was just kind of sitting around awhile. So a little dry, a little meh, just not as special as it usually all is. The dates wrapped in bacon, usually one of my favorites were small and the bacon was just rubbery. The chicken pinxto was sad and tasteless, so I drenched in in that spicy mayo. Please, Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, don't let this be your new normal!!!! Maybe this is just a brunch problem.

2014-12-29,5.0,"So while I'm as gringo as they come, I'm a huge fan of Spanish and Latin cuisine. My wife and I came here on a whim, a last minute thing. We went in and were seated promptly. The ambiance is beautiful with Spanish and abstract artwork throughout. Soft music and dim lights make even an ugly place seem nice but the decor is superb regardless. For once, I decided to not order the paella, even though I'm sure it would have been as incredible as everything else. We had the bacon wrapped dates, the special New Zealand venison, the fried calamari, fried peppers, pork belly, and the pinxos platter. The venison reminded me of O Toro (for you sushi fans) in how it practically melted in your mouth. The Pinxos platter is essentially a sampler of all of their pinxos (appetizers) which was lovely. The fried peppers were surprisingly nice. They were a tray of a not super spicy pepper, I believe green jalapeños, fried, with most of the heat cooked out. There was however a big red pepper, which was still quite spicy. They are in some sort of a savory sauce with course salt. If you like savory with a light amount of heat, the peppers hit the spot. Funnily enough, dessert was my favorite part even though I generally prefer savory over sweet. Being a yelper I picked up that they give a free dessert tapa for each guest. My wife and I ordered the ice cream sandwiches and the chocolate truffle. The truffle was an exceptionally rich block of truffle chocolate with a homemade creamy whipped cream dollop to the side. Very good, but not really my cup of tea. The ice cream sandwiches were home made pumpkin iced cream between two ginger snap cookies, with a bit of powdered sugar and cinnamon or nutmeg (not quite sure from the flavor explosion) sprinkled on top. I took a small bite of one and was blown away! We will be back if not solely for those ice cream sandwiches. Big fan!

2014-11-22,4.0,This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. I've been coming here for years and have always had a good experience. These are the must haves in my opinion. The crispy potatoes as well as the garlic potatoes. The curried chicken salad the goat cheese in tomato sauce and the sherry meatballs and the bacon wrapped dates. The desserts are delicious especially the chocolate and the tres leches. The desserts are way too small in my opinion. I get that they are tapas but that's just too small for me and annoying.  and I will say that I wasn't impressed with the more expensive dishes on the menu. The streak is nothing special in my opinion and neither is the chicken skewers. So I usually stick with my favorites and that is more than enough. It can be overly crowded at times and it's hard to get a table as a walk in on weekends. I'm not crazy about the personality of the host who always greets us. She can be rude sometimes and as the first face we see at the restaurant she should be way more friendly.  I'm not too much of a sangria drinker but I've had it. It's good.

The Spanish sausage was a great meat. We really overdid it because after all of that, we ordered paella. Smart idea because the valenciana was awesome.

FOOD My favorite dishes were their seafood ones, specifically the shrimp with garlic, olive oil, and red pepper flakes and the seared sea scallops with leeks, torched oranges, and jamon serrano. The sauce that the shrimp comes in is SO DELICIOUS. Be sure to ask for extra bread, so you can soak up every last drop! The scallops were equally just as delicious and I loved the surprising addition of the torched oranges with all the other components. However, I was really disappointed with the grilled flank steak dish, which was a little dry and tough. Will be sticking to their seafood dishes, which I thought were much better. DESSERT If you check in on Yelp, you get a free dessert tapa per person! My friend and I shared the mini ice cream sandwiches and the butterscotch custard and it was the perfect way to end the meal. Each dish was small as expected, but very satisfying. My favorite was the ice cream sandwiches because they had housemade pumpkin ice cream in the middle, which made the little fall-loving girl in me squeal with delight! Overall, Ba-Ba-Reeba is a great place for small or big groups if you're looking for a fun atmosphere with delicious drinks and many dishes to share! I've also heard that their brunch is bomb, so will also be checking that out in the near future.",0.9988,0.692,0.266,0.043,0.5272946859903381

Fast forward to our wedding day on September 2014.  We hosted a lunch wedding reception at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba for 55 guests.  We worked with Alison and Michelle from Catering, Parties & Special Events.  They made it so easy to plan our reception. They answered all of my questions incredibly fast and were so accommodating.  It could not have been any easier.   On the wedding day the staff was really responsive and wonderful.  The food and sangria was delicious as always.  My guests really enjoyed the food and drink and had a great time.  Most importantly, my husband and I had the wedding reception we had hoped for.",0.9962,0.749,0.242,0.009,0.6267316017316017

2014-09-25,4.0,"Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is an absolute blast. I had the pleasure of dining here with several friends this past week and we were all blown away by the food, service, and atmosphere. I have been to several tapas restaurants in the Chicago area and have to say that CBBR has one of the most accessible menus, with items that will please both the experienced and novice diner.  We started out with a pitcher of sangria (obviously) before diving into the food. The sangria was good, not to mention you get 8 full glasses for $21! We decided against ordering paella, preferring to get as much variety thru the small plates as possible. We ordered the brussel sprout salad, spicy tomatoes, braised short rib, shrimp with garlic, pork belly skewer, and the bacon wrapped dates. Each dish was excellent, I would challenge anyone to come up with a criticism! For me, the braised short rib stole the show, but I'd put every other dish at a close second. We finished up our meal with a few dessert selections, which were a bit lackluster compared to the entree plates (-1/2 star). The other half star goes to the noise level, which was quite high, although some areas of the restaurant may be better than others. Overall, CBBR has definitely been added to my list of favorites in Chicago. Fantastic food at a great price, doesn't get much better than that!

2014-09-18,5.0,"Cafe Ba Ba Reeba is a true gem.   My fiance and I have been here only twice (once in 2012 and once in 2014) but it's one of our favorite places in town.  I've been to several other tapas places in Chicago, which you would think might be better since they were smaller and less corporate (CBBR is a Lettuce Entertain You venture) but this is not the case.  CBBR rules over all! Must orders: * Fried potatoes w/ spicy aoli - as more than a few yelpers have mentioned, the aoli is off the chain.  I legitimately could eat it by the spoonful (could? I meant to say I DO) * Bacon wrapped dates - because #duh * Deviled eggs - I love me some deviled eggs and hate it that many restaurants serve such bland versions.  Not the case here; creamy and well seasoned plus a sprinkle of bacon * dark chocolate crema (dessert) - this is a stand out.  It tasted like a rich brownie, but the texture of a thick mouse.  My mouth was confused but addicted. Pro tip: cocktails are better than the sangria and are half price on Mondays.  Peach/whiskey cocktail and raspberry jam cocktail are great. Bonus points for service... our most recent trip was to celebrate my fiance's birthday.  I merely left a simple note stating as such in our Open Table reservation and you would have thought my lady was a visiting dignitary from the service we received.  Our wonderful server-dude (gah I forget his name!) brought us out free pintxos to start the meal and a complimentary dessert platter with candle at the end.  I was blown away and very grateful for these thoughtful touches.

We were in a hurry because we had theatre tickets and she kept those tapas coming! Some were hit or miss, but the miss was due to personal taste, not because it was bad...there was NOTHING bad there! My favorites were the white sangria ( how can I get the recipe?) of which we had a pitcher and a half for four people.

And I've heard great things about their New Year's Day brunch which fills up weeks in advance.

I recommend making a reservation, otherwise expect a long wait on the weekend. - Great food, tons of vegetarian options. My favorites include: sea food paella, it's fresh and the huge portion is easily sharable by 4-5 people. The market salad is delicious with the textures all playing well together. The spicy potatoes and goat cheese in tomato sauce actually pair well together, who doesn't like high-carb foods? I've also never been disappointed with the chef's specials, so be sure to hear them out. - The classic sangria (red), is a hit or miss. Sometimes, it's superb, well balanced with plenty of fruit, but other times it's overly sweet and disappointing. If you'd like more fruit in your sangria, be sure to mention that, they'll usually bring you a side of pre-soaked apples to add to your glass.  - Definitely save room for dessert. All chocoholics must try the dark chocolate crema, the rich chocolate and orange contrast is simply too good to share. I'm not a fan of the chocolate truffle cake since the kahlua makes it a bit too sweet for my liking, but if you prefer milk chocolate I've heard it's a must eat. Finally, if the mango sorbet is in season, then definitely try it. It's so fresh and refreshing, perfect for Chicago summers.

We were super hungry when we got there so we started ordering haphazardly. However, we totally missed out on the paella (it takes about 30 minutes to make and we were halfway through our meal before we made that realization). Don't forget to check-in on Yelp--you get a free dessert tapa. :D Mango sangria we got a pitcher for $24, which was okay, but I think the classic red sangria is better. Wood-oven roasted vegetables with toasted pinenuts: this was one my favorite dishes of the night. Although the sauce was probably oil-based, it didn't seem oily at all. Rioja braised short rib, manchego mashed potatoes, charred spring onions: The short ribs are really good Seared lamb loin with mint salsa verde and pisto manchego: depending on how it's cooked, lamb is usually a hit or a miss with me. I was not a fan of this dish. Black garlic roasted chicken: my brother basically devoured this dish and mostly hogged it to himself. Needless to say, it was flavored pretty well. Grilled skewer of marinated pork belly and pork loin: this dish wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything extraordinary.  Meatballs with sherry tomato sauce: my entire family really enjoyed this dish. My brother even saved the tomato sauce as a dipping sauce for his bread. Grilled octopus: this dish was the easiest to share since it was more plentiful than the others. Although the description includes a ""fiery tomato sauce,"" I don't recall eating it with sauce (which may explain why I think the dish was more on the bland side). Seared sea scallops: the scallops were cooked just right, but we were disappointed that it only comes with 3 scallops (there were four of us). Spanish crudo: it comes with a few slices of raw fish soaked in olive oil. This dish got mixed reviews at our table--my mom thought it was good but my brother and I both thought it was forgettable. I probably would have liked it more if it wasn't swimming in olive oil. Natilla flan: the flan was too rich for my taste and less custard-like than I expected (I think it was made with cream cheese). Chocolate truffle cake: the title says it all. Overall, we enjoyed the food and the service was good--we kept stopping our waiter so that we could order more dishes and our water glasses were constantly refilled.",0.9951,0.817,0.15,0.033,0.5575315425315425

Went with a large group and shared an order with one other person and left spending about $25 per person (including tip) and was very full. Went with the short rib which was extremely succulent and tender and the ham/chorizo and manchego plate. Our side was the spicy potatoes which although were not spicy at all, had a great tomato alioli to go along with it. If you do find yourself hungry they also bring out Bread and Olive Oil to dip which is a huge plus as well. The main reason preventing me from giving this 5 stars was the sangria. It was extremely mild and at times I felt like I was not drinking wine at all. Not sure why, but it felt a little off for me.

Before we order we were told by our waiter that they were smaller portions of food and were good for sharing. Once we all placed our orders and received our dishes, we realized that the waiter couldn't have been more wrong! The portion sizes, compared to the price, was absolutely ridiculous! I have never, in my life, paid so much for so little. The portions that were served were not even fit to feed the individual that ordered it, let alone to share. I am absolutely angry and  supremely displeased with this establishment. Everyone in my party left this place hungry. We ended up going to another local restaurant to finish eating because everyone was still starving.

Considering it is a tapas place, I was limited to choices because most didn't eat pork, which was still fine, but the other two girls didn't eat anything but 'halal,'which eliminates all meat from being ordered. So, we were limited to Seafood and vegetarian options, which were average. I did order the sear lamb loin with mint salsa verde and pisto manchego. It was pretty good, but not amazing. My friend also ordered for herself the beef skewer with red onions and horseradish cream, which was pretty good. It was more flavorful than the lamb. We ordered the seafood paella, which was alright. I've had better paella elsewhere. The sangria blanco was great. Overall, did not have the best experience, but would return to try again.

I mean, this is by far the best in town and personally I feel it's one of the best restaurants in the city! Without a doubt a go to spot when you're in the northside of Chicago.  I've lived in the area for four years and have visited the restaurant close to ten times and never have once been disappointed. Usually all of my trips there consists on just my girlfriend and I so I can't comment on what's its like with a group, but looking around and seeing how often there are tables of 8 or more people it has got to be a great time. Some of the staples that you MUST order are numbers 30 (spicy potatoes with tomato alioli) and 44 (shrimp with garlic). If you visit here those are some of the best tapas on the menu. Beyond that you can't go wrong with another other plate, and that's the best thing about this style of food, if you happen to not enjoy the particular food you ordered then not to worry! They're all small portions so just order something else! Be mindful those cause the bill can easily rack up if you don't pay attention (I just spent $80 there for just the two of us, but left with leftovers and a food baby so it was all good). Try the paella too! Just know that you need to order a minimum of two servings ($12 a serving) and it takes about 30 minutes to cook. The entire thing could feed probably four people though for the two servings (that's if you're also ordering other tapas).  Oh and don't even get me started on the Sangria...so....soo..soooooo good! Get the classic red or white too (I recommend the red). Don't mess around with any of those fancy creations, just order a pitcher of what made them famous and enjoy. Perfect for a date, a night out, birthday party, get together, just about anything you can imagine.

Like the restaurant, the menu is also huge, so there's really something for everyone. We started out with a half pitcher of the classic red sangria. Pretty good deal for $15 considering the two of us each got about 2 glasses full out of it. Fresh baked bread was also quickly brought out, and I couldn't help but stuff my face with it even though I knew we had many dishes on the way. It was just so crusty and delicious I couldn't pass it up! Our food came out at a good pace, and I was so stuffed by the time I left! We ordered the spicy potatoes, goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, braised short rib, grilled octopus, grilled iberico pork and the hand carved iberico. Out of all of these, the only one I probably wouldn't order again is the short rib. It was decent, but compared to everything else we ordered, it just didn't stand out. It's really hard for me to pick my favorite dish because it was all so good! On top of the great flavors, the prices were very reasonable. I'll definitely be back since there's so many more dishes I need to try. And next time, I'll be sure to make a reservation!",0.9959,0.77,0.213,0.017,0.5409548611111111

They were good but nothing to run home and tell mom about! I honestly prefer Avec over this place, if they are comparable in any way. I know Avec isn't just tapas, however.  Next time I go I definitely would like to try their paella to see if it's worth the 45 minute wait and the 2 person minimum serving. WTF? I can handle the wait because it's paella but really? 2 person minimum? If you want great paella, great service, and slightly less hype-I'd choose Avec..  The chicken empanada is delicious though.

They asked us if we were waiting for a seat or a party and we said we had reservations at 8pm and the hostess told us to wait and someone would seat us and that no one ever came to seat us.  They apologized, and sat us immediately. Also gave us free appetizers, and also free dessert. The manager even walked the dessert out to us and apologized again.

On to the meal - they have three different sangria recipes, plus a sangria of the day.  We ordered the sangria of the day - which was mango - and it was delicious!  And a good value for the cost.   But the food...OMG!  I don't think we had a single item that we didn't love!  Shrimp, pork, lamb, olives, shredded brussels sprouts, chorizo, jamon iberico, and I could go on and on!  A couple on the other side of the table ordered the paella, and thankfully sent a sample to our side of the table, and it was delicious as well!  There wasn't a single menu item that we didn't love, and we actually re-ordered a few of the items because they were so delicious!!   We ordered five different desserts to pass around the table - they are all on the smaller side, in line with tapas-style dining, and we had fun taking a bite and passing each one along around the table.   Our server, Allison, was amazing and very accommodating for a large group.  She explained the restaurant policies regarding bill splitting up front and allowed us to split the table in two to make it easier to settle up when the meal was over.   The restaurant itself is cute and classy with the perfect ambience.  Food arrives quickly thanks to a crew of friendly food runners.   I received endless compliments from our group of 15 for a job well done in selecting such a great restaurant for our group.  I would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone that would care to listen to me, and I would definitely return should I be lucky enough to travel to Chicago again in the future!!",0.9969,0.805,0.18,0.015,0.527517857142857

This eliminated the pressure of any decision making for such a large group. The food came out quickly and one right after the other...just as we were finishing up with one tapa, the next was being served. It helped that we had a stellar waiter. Everyone LOVED the food, and the sangria was yummy as ever.  It was also only $30/person for the food, plus tax/tip/drinks.

However, I'm glad that I finally did. It was AMAZING. My favorites would have to be the spicy potatoes w tomato alioli, roasted dates w bacon and apple vinaigrette, and beef empanada. Those along with the other tapas we ordered were simply amazing. At this location, you pay for the abundance of flavors and that is okay because quality is more important that quantity some times. The servers were really nice and always asked if we wanted more. I wouldn't say they went beyond or were exceptional, but they were decent. Lastly, the desserts were really delicious too. Once again, they are small, but one bite of it is enough to fill your entire mouth with flavor. My favorite was the coconut flan.",0.9889,0.763,0.209,0.028,0.6977083333333333

2014-05-20,4.0,"Ahhh tapas, the small plates that contain individual tiny bites of joy. Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba does their versions very well. In a group of 8, celebrating a birthday, many of the tapas were sampled and many drinks were to be had. Four of us split a pitcher of peach sangria, which was very good, each of us got two full glasses and there was a little top off to spare. As far as the food I personally took bites of: Bacon wrapped dates (5/5) Steak skewers (4/5) Spicy Potatotes (4/5) Fried Green Peppers (3/5) and Paella Valenciana (5/5) Braised short ribs w/mashed potatoes (5/5) Dessert - Chocolate Truffle Cake (3/5) You can't go wrong with bacon wrapped dates. The steak skewers and spicy potatoes were more impressive because of the sauce pairings. The fried green peppers were good, just not much to them, not a punch in the bite like I like my tapas. The paella was my favorite paella ever, mostly because paella usually comes with seafood and this one did not. Also it was done well. The braised short ribs I got to myself and every mouthful was very succulent and exactly like I would have wanted and was expecting. The chocolate cake was standard, nothing impressive, but good all the same.  Service was around, clearing plates and making sure we got what all of our orders. Very impressive, especially since the concept of tapas induces a higher service standard than restaurants with the normal three plates.

When we arrived, we were seated quickly because we had a reservation, and overheard other people coming in around the same time being told that there was a 3-hour wait!  While I don't think that this place (or really any other place, when there are so many great options in Chicago) is worth a 3-hour wait, we had some pretty tasty fare - some of the tapas we tried were the brussels sprout salad, tortilla espanola, goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, roast dates wrapped in bacon, and the chicken paella. All were good, but I especially enjoyed the brussels sprout salad and goat cheese. I wasn't a fan of the chicken paella, but my husband really liked it. FYI, you have to order a minimum of 2 servings of paella and that was more than enough - 2 servings is a HUGE portion. We definitely had to box some of the paella up to take with us. The other tapas were a decent size, but not meant for sharing with more than two or three people. Tapas are meant for just getting a small taste of everything, so you may have to order quite a few things.

We weren't too hungry to begin with so it was the perfect restaurant to come to where we can just order a bunch of small plates and try a little bit of everything. First off I would come here for their sangria alone!!! We ordered a pitcher of the white peach sangria and omg I was never a fan of sangria but this place changed my mind. They put actual pieces of peaches and apples so it tastes even more fruity and delicious. The ambience is very romantic, dim lighting and lit up lights on the ceiling, I loved it. The food we ordered - goat cheese croqueta - this was just okay. I wouldn't get it again, nothing special Deviled egg bacon and mustard - again nothing special. My bf said we had to try the bacon wrapped dates as an appetizer but we forgot to order it :( maybe that will be more satisfying than the appetizers I ordered  The shrimp with olive oil, garlic and red pepper flakes - I think we coined this one as our favorite it was cooked perfectly, with just enough oil and garlic yum!! The braised short ribs with mashed potatoes - the short ribs were very soft and kind of just melted in my mouth. I'm a big mashed potatoes fan so I enjoyed this dish as well.  Chicken with some type of vegetables - eh this was just okay, the chicken was a little dry but I liked the veggies :) There was also a lamb special that night, all the meat they have here is very tender and just melts in your mouth!!

Tapas are small dishes that are meant to be shared. Usually, you should order 2 - 3 dishes per person. Each dish can be between $6-12 depending upon what it is. Things can add up pretty quickly but the food is so worth it.  Our waitress, Marilyn was exceptionally nice. She understood when ordering, we would appreciate it if only two dishes came out and not all at once. She timed it so there was a heavy dish paired up with a lighter dish. Our dishes complimented each other in taste and they didn't fight against each other. The only time we were stumped was when it came time for desserts. I opted for a chocolate truffle cake.

The deviled egg with serrano ham and the chorizo-wrapped date were the stand-outs for us. The calamari was also delicious--we enjoyed the red sauce better than the white. I think the paella was my favorite, though. Just keep in mind, ""2 servings"" is more like 4, so come hungry! The only thing I'd say that was a little annoying was the noise level. Sure, it's loud, and that's to be expected. However, their PA system used to call out reservations is a little obnoxious. It's not only too loud, but it also hits at a frequency that seems to pierce right through to your brain. So every time a table is called out, you get a mini headache.

That's how I discovered my favorites and now I waste no time in ordering a half-pitcher just for me.... Make a reservation for weekends; it definitely gets busy. Parking isn't the best.

2014-04-07,5.0,"I GOT MARRIED AT CAFE BABAREEBA THREE WEEKS AGO! (And it was perfect, by the way.) Yes, married. We didn't have just the reception here, we also knocked out a 10 minute ceremony after which, we opened the bar to our guests because, priorities. I was waiting for pictures from our photographer but I wanted to Yelp CBBR while the day was still fresh in my mind. A little back story, my husband proposed to me in August of 2013 - we knew we wanted a short engagement and literally just picked the weekend after my birthday in March (3/15 to be exact). After we got engaged and waited about a week, we already knew that CBBR would be it, we love the restaurant and the food and the tapas/family style plates and casual atmoshpere. Picking CBBR was just as easy as saying yes to him. Sure we had other places in mind (Carnivale, Tapas Valencia) but CBBR was more us. And it was important to us that we keep it personal, like we were just throwing a party. Traditional we are NOT. Plus, communication with CBBR was timely and friendly, which matters when you plan a wedding 6 months away. From the moment I reached out to them about my possible party size (Was: 75, Actual: 125), to the day of - the communication and service was just wonderful in a word. Alison and Ashley are some of my favorite people ever. My wedding day went off without a hitch because the entire staff is amazing. Literally amazing. We wanted to pay for everything before the wedding day because who wants to think about that when you're getting married. And it was so easy, and they ran our card for the final payment like we asked and let us know once they did. They think of everything before you do, which comes in handy if you're a frazzled, busy bride. We wanted something low-key obviously, and we didn't even realize we picked St. Patty's weekend for our nuptials. So many other patrons stopped my husband and I for pictures and we can't even begin to explain how much fun our guests had.  So many guests commented on how this was ""the best wedding meal of their lives,"" which meant a lot to us because we obviously love to eat haha.  In fact, we got a wedding card yesterday from friends who added a PS in the card: ""We had so much fun at your wedding we forgot to put the card in the box!"" That's all we wanted after all, to make sure our guests have a great time. Alison is so flexible and accommodating it was literally so easy to plan this with her behind the scenes. Also, she is so sweet in person (and in email but you know, email is your first point of contact!) We literally upgraded our bar package a week before the event and it wasn't even a big deal, they were both just like - SURE NO PROBLEM! In fact, my head count kept changing and I would just shoot her an email the week of and she would just thank me for me letting her know. Ashley was there on the day of and always made a point to check in with me at every part of the day. She even brought me sangria refills too! So thoughtful. We actually dropped off our items the Friday before the wedding and they took care of everything, put programs at every place setting and literally (with the help of our friends/coordinators) gave us the day we dreamed of, better actually.  So sure, a restaurant wedding isn't for everyone. But this wedding was exactly us. My husband and I cannot wait til our one year anniversary. We're going to dinner at Cafe Babareeba and spending the weekend at the Four Seasons Chicago to re-live our wedding weekend just as it was.  Thank you so much Alison + Ashley for giving us the wedding day that was better than Rith and I could have ever imagined.

We got seated right away and ordered the blackberry sangria. We each had about three glasses and I thought it was well worth the price. For the two of us we ordered the following off the menu: -patatas bravas: amazing and flavorful. Not too spicy but stills packs a punch. - goat cheese in marinara sauce: a personal favorite. I love the combination between the two and with some toasted bread you can't go wrong. -dates wrapped in bacon: everyone talks about these and they are not to be missed. The savory sweet aspect is awesome. -beef short rib with potatoes and brussels sprouts: short rib was fork tender and melt in your mouth -scallop dish: broth is great and very fragrant. With both of us checking into Yelp, we each got a dessert tapas for free. We tried the chocolate truffle cake and chocolate crema. Perfect sizes and the chocolate was fairly rich. The bill was around $60, but we left full, satisfied, and in a sangria haze. Only recommendation would be to order 2 tapas at a time.

Feeling like I was sitting in Spain, during the summer time as it is freezing in Chicago, I enjoyed the ambiance of light chatter as people were coming in to dine and ordering their favorites from the menu.  It doesn't take long to notice that this is a favorite restaurant in the cute area of Lincoln Park. It is huge too. I sat in the dining area, but of course there is a bar area and possibly a private room? My waitress knew the menu well, and was happy to share details on everything wile spending time with us as the otehr tables were also busy.  You can't go wrong with the menu but you must order one of the paella's if you are a real foodie. But, of course, I always go with different meats when ordering tapas. My favorite was the short rib style, so tender. The sauces that came with everything had a taste that could last forever in your mouth.  My friend and I both checked in on Yelp and got 2 dessert tapas, so many to choose from, and shared. Our waitress bought a complimentary 3rd one to the table, as she said the ones on our table were her 3 favorite. I wish I could remember her name so I could give her a shout out on here.

2014-03-25,5.0,"This place is always my favorite! Literally nothing I've tried here has been below amazing. Some of my personal favorites are the following: Potatoes Bravas - Sauce comes on the side so you can decide how much spice you want. Potatoes are super crispy, just the way I like them! Beef Tenderloin with Blue Cheese and Potato Chips - The beef is super tender, cooked to medium, and the blue cheese is the perfect accompaniment to this. The chips are homemade and add a good crunch to the dish. Shrimp in Garlic/Olive Oil - They are always cooked just right - not rubbery like most places tend to do. They are simple and delicious. Goat Cheese w Marinara - The toast points are garlicy and cripsy, the goat cheese is soft and the marinana sauce is seasoned to perfection. Meatballs - There are about 5 meatballs, all pretty pretty, so it's a good size tapa. They are tender and I believe they use the same marinana sauce that the goat cheese comes with. Lamb Kabobs - These are super flavorful! There are three in the dish and they have been grilled and marinated for deliciousness. They taste similar to indian kabobs but more tender and come in a tomato sauce! Pincho de Pollo y Chorizo - My favorite Pincho de Pollo is at Cafe Iberico, but this one is delicious as well. It comes with a sauce that I wish i could make at home. The chicken is grilled, as well as the chorizo. It's pretty basic but really great! Sangria - They always have a bunch of different types to choose from. I've never had a bad one, although I do wish they were a little stronger ;) You also can't go wrong with a bottle of wine! Carmelized Banana with Ice Cream - This is always my favorite dessert! The carmel is roasted on top of the banana to create a crunch, and the warm banana/carmel is paired with a vanilla bean ice cream, which is just heaven! The service is great here, especially since they are always jammed packed! The ambiance is great for bigger groups or double dates. I wouldn't call it romantic, but there are 5 different rooms, so depending on where you sit the noise level can be pretty loud or a little quieter.

On my last visit, we were with a group of 14 people for a birthday party. We had a reservation and arrived about 10 minutes early for our reso. Our reservation time came and passed, and we waited an extra 20-30 min. to be seated. No big deal since we had a large party (with some children). Danielle was our server and she was super attentive and made great recommendations for the table. She brought the food out as it was ready, and everything was delicious! Even better, she kept the sangria coming, just like we wanted. With such a diverse age-range group, I imagine it was tough for her to keep up with our demands ( think ""sippy cups! more sangria! more bacon wrapped dates! even more bacon wrapped dates and refill the sippy cup while you're at it!)"", but she was great.  Overall, I would definitely come back with a group. We had a great time, and completely forgot about the extra wait because the service and food was amazing.",0.991,0.779,0.208,0.013,0.5109347442680776

We were seated right away, No reservations,  but service was slow & we had 4 or 5 different servers, which threw me off a bit. I guess I'm being picky, but no heads up about it...me likes to build a rapport with whoever is going to be handling my food, ya heard? Anyhoo...waited around for people to take our orders, bring food out, etc. Everything took longer than it probably should have. Again,  they had enough staff, so I don't understand why that was the case.  The food itself was good,  a bit heavy on some of the sauces. I really liked the chicken w cauliflower plate, so so flavorful! The original sangria was nothing noteworthy. Good cappuccino,  we needed it for the long drive home.  So.....A solid 3.5 from me.  I'd give it another shot,  since the bill didn't hurt the wallet.

2014-03-12,5.0,"Never before had Tapas, nor have I had any Paella (except for a very meh tasting one back in the suburbs at a buffet). So when my friend suggested we go and try Paella I jumped at the chance.  For tapas I ordered the citrus-cured salmon. It was very powerful with the citrus taste mostly from the creama. The capers and pickled cucumber and radish accentuate this further. I was really expecting such a taste honestly, but I did enjoy it thoroughly  The Paella requires a minimum of two people and you have to order assuming both parties or more wants that specific Paella, so no mixing and matching from what we could tell. We ordered the seafood one, the meat included is entirely seasonal/availability based. So ours came with Shrimp and Scallops and green beans and with a side of Garlic Aioli and Lemon. The taste was amazing and probably the best smelling dish in the whole room. The best part is the bits that stuck onto the pan, the waiter made sure to every bit onto our plates.  Take note that the dish is very heavy, sometimes you might not even want to order your tapas if you just want the Paella.",0.982,0.797,0.157,0.046,0.47444444444444445

The cava sangria was phenomenal. If I'm in Chicago again, I'd love to come back to try other menu items.  The service is solid and the atmosphere is perfect for a night out.

You literally can't go wrong when you can make it exactly how you like it, just make sure you leave room for everything they have to add to it.  As far as the food, it's ba ba reeba, so you know it's got to be good. They have classic brunch options, items from their regular menu, and breakfast pinxtos for those who can't make up their mind. My favorite has to be the french toast, which is saying a lot because usually I'm not a fan.

He also let each of us use the check-in deal (free dessert tapas). Sweet. Like my coconut flan. All of the desserts were on the sweeter side.  As for the food, I've had better tapas. We got the Paella Valenciana and the seafood Paella. The verdict was split between the two on which was better but it seemed if you liked seafood you liked the seafood paella. We also got the bacon wrapped dates which I think was the better deal than the Pintxos version where you only get one for $2. The endive, blue cheese, walnut salad was too acidic for my taste and it took awhile for that dish to go away. The other dishes weren't that memorable unfortunately.

I actually really enjoyed sitting at the bar--we were able to ask the bartender his opinion on a few things, and he was really helpful. We started with the Pintxos platter of small bites and EVERYTHING was delicious, especially the grilled shrimp and the goat cheese croqueta. Then we ordered a first round of tapas and again, everything was delicious.  If you aren't familiar with what is on the menu, I would go for the red-font items--those are their specialties and you can pretty much count on it being a home run. We started off with the shrimp with garlic and olive oil (delish), the chicken and ham croquetas (delish), the beef tenderloin and blue cheese (delish), and the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce (SUPER delis). Like I said, it was just me and my boyfriend, but neither one of us had eaten much that day so we were still hungry and decided to order a couple more. We added on the meatballs with sherry tomato sauce and skewered chicken and chorizo and that was perfect. After that, we were two very, very happy people.

Ordered the Spanish sausage tapas and the sausage is supposed to be served charred, but this was more like boiled.  The flavors were not what I am use to in Spanish sausage. We ordered the Paella and it was tasteless except for the salt. Normally you would have shellfish, along with the other seafood.  It is supposed to have a slight seafood taste, but this was sanitized.  Today my lips have one less layer of skin on them.  Dessert was very good.  The Sangria was a bust.  The fruit is supposed to sit in the pitcher and soak up the flavors and the fruit is supposed to have some citrus, but not this one. I have eaten Spanish food in many countries and this was the worst. Even in my adopted home of Bangkok, Thailand there is a Spanish restaurant that is perfect with full flavors.  The Paella at Ba-Ba Reeba was more like bad Chinese fried rice.  I've spent mush time in Spain and I do understand and know what good Spanish food is and this was not.  I did not give this review 1 star, because the server was great, but he was smart enough not to ask us how the food was.

We arrived a little later than our reservation time. The waiter was good at listening to our requests and recommended the best dishes. I loved the food, from the spicy shrimp, to stuffed mushroom, chicken empanada and finally the chocolate truffle cake. Good- Our seating was pretty cramped, especially since we tend to order many plates at once. I wish we could've gotten a round table instead. Poor- Our bill was $80.67. We were splitting the tab, so we each gave our credit cards. Well today I discovered I was charged $80.67. I texted my best friend who confirmed she was ALSO charged $80.67. So I'm wondering since when does a restaurant charge double the check? My BFF called and spoke to a manager who apologized and gave some explanation about how their system always does that when you pay with a credit card but it should clear up n a couple of days.  In my opinion, customers should be informed in advance because its a inconvenience to put a hold on someone's money. With so many national security breaches happening, you would think businesses would be conscious of how they handle their customers' money.

The sangria was pretty good, but very similar to white wine sangria. I'm normally more of a red sangria person, just because white can be too sweet, but the blood orange sangria was light and delicious. We also used the Yelp check-in deal to get free desserts.

I have avoided dates since the dawn of time but this classic dish is the perfect marriage of sweet and savory. - braised short rib with mashed potatoes and veggie of the day. Meat is tender and juicy, rips right apart. - spicy potatoes. I do love my potatoes and the spicy sauce is to die for. The meh: - Sangria. Tastes more like Franzia and the fruit isn't left in the wine so the flavor doesn't absorb as well - Calamari.

My favorite tapas are the roasted bacon-wrapped dates in an apple vinaigrette, spiced lamb kabobs with lemon, mint and tomato, and the shaved brussels sprout salad with almonds and manchego cheese.  They do have a GLUTEN FREE menu if you ask! Whether your on a date, out with friends, or want a nice place to take family, I recommend Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba.",0.9882,0.795,0.205,0.0,0.6384615384615385

2014-01-08,5.0,"Went here for a birthday dinner in the midst of the polar vortex craziness, and the place was still pretty full. Impressive. Our server was gregarious and attentive. A guy you wouldn't mind being friends with. The food arrived very promptly. Between the four of us, we had around 10 tapas before dessert. I was struck by how perfectly cooked and seasoned every single dish was. Seriously, everything we tried was amazing. I particularly enjoyed the stuffed mushrooms (as I love mushrooms...), grilled salmon, and moroccan chicken.   Definitely save room for dessert. Upon mention of the occasion, our birthday girl was given a coconut flan and a toffee caramel bar. The flan was denser than any I'd had before, very smooth, and not too sweet. I loved the subtle coconut flavor. Two of the people I was with said the toffee bar was too sweet for them, but I thought its lightness balanced out its sweetness pretty well. The apple empanada was soft and warm and pillowy, and the mango sorbet was good enough to thoroughly enjoy during below-freezing temperatures.

2014-01-02,5.0,"My boyfriend took me here for a surprise birthday dinner and I was excited to try tapas for the first time. We had a reservation on a Wednesday for 6 PM and we were seated immediately. The restaurant did not full up until around 7 PM, so it turns out that we did not need reservations. I have heard that weekends are a different story entirely, but my weekday experience was that it was not crazy busy.  We were seated toward the back next to a mirror (one whole wall of the restaurant is a mirror to give the illusion of a larger size). I noticed right away that there suble, classy Christmasy decorations that created a very inviting and cozy atmosphere. I could not stop smiling from the start to the end of my meal! Our waiter was cordial and helpful in explaining the menu to us, as well as how tapas work, after we informed him that this was our first time dining at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba. We ordered the seafood paella for two for starters after our waiter informed us that would take the longest amount of time to be ready (30-40 minutes). We also ordered a glass of the classic red sangria to share. (Okay, mostly for my boyfriend. I don't really drink, so I just took a few sips of his because I had never tried sangria before.) I have nothing to compare it to exactly, but I thought it was delicious and certainly more enjoyable than red wine by itself (in my un-wine-cultured opinion). While waiting for our seafood paella, we did not hold back at all in ordering small plates of tapas. We kept ordering and ordering and the food just kept coming and coming! My boyfriend had the roasted dates wrapped in bacon with apple vinaigrette and he said it was so good that I tried a tiny bite (I'm pescetarian). Sure enough, it was absolutely delicious. The flavors worked perfectly together. Next, we had the pintxos platter with the short-rib stuffed piquillo pepper, bacon-wrapped grilled shrimp, chorizo-wrapped medjool date and cheese, goat cheese croquette with lemon gastrique, roasted beet crostini with herbed goat cheese and hazelnuts, deviled egg with bacon and mustard. The goat cheese croquette was my absolute favorite with the shrimp in a close second. Next, I had the market greens salad, with chili-roasted corn, tomato, cucumber, avocado, goat cheese, and fresno chili vinaigrette; grilled squid on arugula with olive oil and garlic. It was fairly straightforward, but truly excellent. The salad was a great break from some of the other heavier tapas I ate tonight. We also ordered the spicy potatoes with tomato aioli, which were simply divine. I was skeptical when I first read the description on the menu, but boy, was I wowed!  By the time the seafood paella arrived after ~20 minutes, we were stuffed with tapas. I barely made a dent in my portion, which was pretty large. It's hard to say if it was because I was quite full or not, but I was not as impressed with the paella as I was with the tapas. The dish could have used a bit more flavor and the rice seemed a bit undercooked, which makes sense given it arrived at our table earlier than the waiter originally said it would. However, the calamari in the paella was of very high quality and I enjoyed it a lot! After clearing our plates, our waiter brought us complimentary desserts because it was our first time at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, but I pretended it was because it was my birthday. There was no way I was going to turn down free desserts, even if I was very full from all of the abovementioned food. The coconut flan was the best. Simply The Best I Have Ever Had. I would make the trip back *just* for that flan. The other dessert was caramelized banana with vanilla ice cream, quince syrup, and toasted pistachios. The presentation was cute and it was quite delicious, though perhaps a bit too sweet with the quince syrup.  This was my first tapas experience, but now my expectations are quite high. My only real complaint, apart from not being blown away by the paella, was that the tables are pretty close together and it was easy to hear the entire conversation of the table right behind us. I should also mention that the portion sizes were pretty large. My boyfriend, who has had tapas before, observed that the portions were much larger than other tapas places he has eaten. We left with leftovers, full stomachs, and big smiles. I can't wait to come back here in the future!",0.9992,0.803,0.174,0.023,0.499010758377425
2013-12-31,5.0,"My first time at a Tapas restaurant and it was WONDERFUL! For those who aren't familiar, Tapas are appetizer-like dishes combined with a paella to make a full meal. A group of 5 of us tried the Pintxos platter, the spinach and manchego-stuffed mushrooms (5 only), grilled squid with olive oil and garlic (large portion), spicy potatoes with tomato alioli (large portion) and 2 other tapas I forgot and the seafood paella. I was very impressed with all the tapas but liked the GRILLED SQUID and SPICY POTATOES the most. You can't really go wrong with any of the tapas. Also, don't let my picture of the pintxos platter fool you - everything on there is DELICIOUS and my favorite one was the GOAT CHEESE CROQUETA WITH LEMON GASTRIQUE.  My only mild complaint was that the seafood paella was saltier and stickier than I would have liked. TIP: TWO SERVINGS of paella is able to satisfy 5 people (2 guys, 3 girls). TRY THE PASSION FRUIT SANGRIA! The alcoholic taste is minimal and is a fresh complement to the meal. The servers are attentive but not overly hovering. The front of the restaurant is also deceptive; it is quite spacious inside. Be sure to make RESERVATIONS! This place is always hopping!

This was plenty of food for the three of us and our ticket before tip was only $100. I thought the amount of food for the price was a great deal.

It was also many of people in my party's first time to a tapas restaurant and we were unsure how to order, and we were never really given an explanation.

I agree with a recent review, that the food didn't completely stand out against some other  tapas restaurants, but we still found the dishes to be very tasty.

And I love tapas, so not sure what went wrong! My friend and I stopped in for dinner on Halloween night, and the place was energetic but not packed. Good service, nice ambiance. We ordered the roast dates, calamari, goat cheese in tomato sauce, spicy potatoes, and a chicken empanada. Again, all good but not amazing...though now that I think about it, we weren't too creative with our ordering. If I came back, I might branch out a little more and then perhaps I'd be a bit more impressed. The dishes were larger than tapas normally are, so we actually took a fair amount to go!

There are many tables; however, the wait can still be a bit of a challenge. I strongly recommend making a reservation.  After we were seated, the server came promptly and took our drink orders. We chose the half pitcher of their classic sangria. Their sangria, for lack of better terms, is like a fine crack that you will become addicted to as you sip each sip. Be careful. You have been warned. The half pitcher contained a generous amount; enough for two people on a first date trying to ease the pain of the awkward encounter you must hurdle through. I got buzzed, SUCCESS! The food - Here is what we ordered: 1. Beef empanada - I'm cuban, it's what we do. The dough was flaky and buttery and contained a generous amount of beef filling. However, the taste of the beef lacked seasoning. I would skip this one next time I go.  2. A seafood mixture which had shrimp and scallops: I don't remember what it was called but it almost looked like a ceviche. This was light, refreshing, and tasty. I did not feel guilty while consuming these calories. Yum.  3. Seared scallops: WOW! The highlight of the meal. Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, hint of garlic and a slightly sweet after taste. mouthgasm at its finest.  4. Stuffed mushrooms: My second favorite; however, a bit too greasy for being a veggie dish.  5. Chicken and spanish chorizo skewer: This was really, really, good too. They definitely know how to cook their meats. Me likey. I must note that the food came out in ""chunks"", step by step, one by one. It was strange. It took about 5 minutes between each plate. The last one, the skewer, came out about 20 minutes after we had already consumed the others. This was the only pickle I have about the dining experience.  The server was good; attentive; made recommendations accordingly. A for effort :) I'd go back again.",0.9968,0.773,0.204,0.023,0.5439024390243902

For food, we got the endive salad, grilled squid, and the peppers stuffed with scallops (special of the night).  All three were great.  I could have eaten 3 orders of the peppers and called it a night! We then ordered the spinach stuffed mushrooms, the lamb kabobs, the bacon wrapped dates, and what they called ""happy ham"" (also a special of the night).  All were delicious.  The dates are a must for me.  We decided we could have done without the ham.  Though delicious, it was too heavy and we would have rather have stuck to veggies and seafood.  Along with these, we ordered a jarra of the Ergo.  It was much like a Pinot Noir and very good.  For dessert, I ordered the dark chocolate with orange marmalade and my mom ordered the butterscotch.  Perfect ending! Love it here!  Plus the prices are not bad and for my mother and I, it was about a $50 dinner each...that includes the things we could have done without!",0.9938,0.793,0.199,0.008,0.6314661654135336

2013-11-11,3.0,"Ahh, variety, it's the spice of life.  It could also be the bane of existence for any person that struggles to make a decision.  I'm not talking about which iPhone color to get; I'm just talking about dinner for tonight.  I guess you could say that tapas answers that burning question of what to pick by allowing you to indulge in multiple plates as if you had a personal line to the kitchen. Café Ba-Ba Reeba was actually my first tapas experience, and a very nice one at that.  I, having been known to struggle with decisions (friends, stop snickering) saw this discovery as bittersweet.  Due to the fact that I love the idea of tapas after having been introduced to it, but was saddened that so many nights of hair pulling anxiety could have been avoided if I had only known about it sooner.  Ahh, on to the review...Choose the Pintxos Platter and you won't be disappointed.  I can personally vouch for the Chorizo-wrapped Medjool Date & Cheese, Bacon Wrapped Shrimp and the Short Rib-Stuffed Piquillo Pepper.  Each of these dishes came two pieces to a plate and they were loaded with enough flavors to send your taste buds into the Merengue.  I could have kept ordering these three dishes all night, but with so many more options how could I not torture myself?  Moving on, the Meatballs with Sherry Tomato Sauce, Chicken & Ham Croquetas and Roast Dates with Bacon & Apple Vinaigrette made their way out.  The stand out dish here was the Croquetas.  Ay, dios mio!  The meatballs were delicious, on a very familiar level, so if you're looking to experience new flavors I would choose something else.  If you want a delicious meatball, order away.  As for the Roast Dates, I would skip them.  These dates are much larger than the dates on the Pitxos menu, so be aware that the main, and almost only, flavor you taste here is the date.  I love dates, but come on, leave some room for the bacon!   Another discovery I found that night, yeah I kinda felt like the Ponce de Leon of tapas, was that all these small dishes left me feeling right for some dessert.  The thought of ordering a number of small dishes for dessert left me feeling very empowered and indulgent and not at all indecisive.  A few minutes later I had the Gala Apple Empanada, Marcona Almond Caramel Bar and Chocolate Truffle Cake sitting in front of me.  All amazing choices, but the Marcona Almond Caramel Bar left me wanting more...of it.  I shed a brief tear of sadness when the last bite was finished.  I'm actually finding it difficult to finish this review and not go there for that dish.   Lastly, the atmosphere is a fun.  Well lit, lots of different rooms and enough energy to keep your senses dancing.  The bar seats are fun, but they fill up quickly since they are first come, first serve.  The only thing that must stop is the loud speaker calling of names for tables.  This gave it a very cheesy feel and really detracted from what was normally a hip vibe.   Noteworthy Points: The wait can get long, reserve a spot or scope out the two bar areas that are first come, first serve Takes credit cards Serves Alcohol Street Parking",0.9905,0.845,0.109,0.046,0.46818382235048894

2013-11-11,3.0,"I have been coming to this restaurant for years. I always recommend this place to my friends and co-workers. I decided to celebrate my birthday party at the restaurant for 12 people. I made the reservations for 8:30. We did not get seated until about 9:20!! We kept asking the hostess why it was taking to long and they kept telling us ""Almost ready"" and that ""their getting the table ready"" at 8:45, 9:00, and 9:15 pm. I informed the waitress that I had a table reserved at 11 pm at a local nightclub. So I did not want to rush dinner. She said she ""understood"". I know I had said 12 but 3 friends unexpectedly surprised me and when I told the waitress it would 15 she said we would have to sit at separate tables or wait another 30 mins so we can sit together. At that point I was already frustrated with time and went ahead and had 6 guests at one table and 9 at another. The waitress came over and apologized which I appreciated but the LONG wait caused 6 of my guests to sit at another table and I lost my table reservation at the night club. A good manager would have comped something off the bill but that didn't happen.  I would NOT recommend this place for large parties.

We arrived a bit earlier than they had told us to and they were able to seat us within five minutes. The place is huge and knows how to manage a busy Fri night! We had trouble deciding what to order, there are so many great options, I don't think you can go wrong! The sangria was amazing (we tried the classic red); seriously, the best I've ever had. There were three of us in our group; we split about 8 plates: from pinxtos platter to goat cheese in tomato sauce, brussel sprout salad to spicy potatoes, and three different meat plates (Spanish sausages, beef skewer and short ribs). It was all amazing. I'd order those plates again, except that I would also want to try new things!! With that said, my favorites were the roasted dates with bacon and apple vinaigrette (coming from someone who doesn't usually like dates - they were heavenly), rioja-braised short ribs, spicy potatoes and the brussel sprouts.

Hubby preferred it over Cafe Iberico; I thought they were comparable, but liked that Cafe Ba Ba Reeba does reservations.  The staff was very friendly and wished us a happy birthday when we arrived. We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table, which we kind of expected since the place was packed. Our server was knowledgeable about the dishes. My one word of advice is listen to the server regarding the number of tapas to order. We did not and we were beyond full! All of the food and drinks were delicious. We had red sangria, queso de cabra, patatas bravas, a beef empanada, and chicken paella (which we mostly are eating as leftovers today). While the paella was great, we think we will skip it next time so we can try a couple more tapas. We were too full for dessert, so the manager comped the sangria, which I thought was really nice.

I mean come on, how hard is it to do brunch? Omelets, pancakes, bacon - I mean is that really so difficult? Apparently, it is for this place. Everyone's omelets just weren't right. One had way too much chorizo, another one was missing half of the promised ingredients.  And then the service was terrible. The waitress had no clue what ingredients were in what dishes and didn't bother to ask the chef when we had questions. She never came to check on us and was just generally oblivious.

Positives: A large selection of different tapas, and they were categorized on the menu by vegetable, seafood or meat to help choosy diners.  There were enough different selections that our group could easily go back multiple times without having the same thing twice. Timing on the deliveries was good too.  I hate going to a tapas place, ordering several different tapas and having them delivered all at once.  We got ours pretty much one or two at  time.

Given the atmosphere (and great wine selection), this is also a good destination for a romantic date.  My first tip is to hold back on the bread basket and wait for the tapas to roll in - you'll find plenty of dishes with sauces to sop up. Save the bread for that.  We started with the pinxtos platter, which is basically six different 'bites' and a good way to satisfy different tastes at the table (though you may all end up fighting over your favorite). We also ended up ordering about two tapas per person and skipping the paella since we wanted more flavor than 'filler' and I was quite happy with that decision.  Just the perfect amount of food. Hits: the stuffed mushrooms were incredible (and the creamy, cheesy, garlicky sauce is one of the best reasons to hold onto your bread bits). We also all LOVED the scallops a la plancha and - surprisingly - the Brussels sprout salad (even the guys scarfed that one up).  No misses at all, but I'd recommend against what I think was called the market greens salad - mostly because it wasn't 'special' - you could totally make that at home or get it anywhere.  Service was friendly, fast and knowledgeable. Our server recommended the Juan Gil red wine for me and I absolutely fell in love with it.

2013-10-04,4.0,"I've been wanting to go here for a while but it's a bit out of the way (purple line to red line to brown line) so it wasn't until yesterday that I finally made it out with a friend (and fellow food fanatic). Ordered:  - 2 servings of paella valenciana (basically paella with a shitload of pork): don't eat this if you're dieting, don't like meat, or are scared of grease. It was delicious and flavors were extremely rich and fatty, but it was literally swimming in grease and there was complete meat overload. Best paella I've had taste-wise, but left me feeling extremely thirsty and a bit guilty afterwards. - chilled seafood salad with shrimp, scallops, and calamari: Yum! I love seafood and I love citrus, so this was a great dish for me. Came with a decently generous portion of seafood, and the citrus marinade was great as well.  - shrimp with garlic, olive oil, red pepper flakes: pretty good. Flavors were solid but nothing extraordinary (tasted kinda like shrimp with butter and garlic). - Fried calamari: Typical calamari.  - mini caramel almond tart: absolutely heavenly. Extremely thick, caramel-y goodness. Not for those who can't handle really sweet things. Meal comes with free bread, and I was able to avoid stuffing myself with bread. BUT I did try a couple bites and it had a subtle, tangy flavor that I really liked. Friend also ordered the peach sangria. Tried a sip and it was good - didn't taste overwhelmingly of alcohol. She also ordered the caramelized banana for dessert and it was great as well.  Biggest complaint is the pricing. Spent almost $40 per person, and although the food was good, I wouldn't say it was worth that price.  Tip: check in for a free dessert tapa!",0.9984,0.636,0.297,0.067,0.5977477477477479

Here are just some of the things that made it such a great experience. First, their prices/minimums are sooo much more reasonable than other wedding sites - including no room rental fee (such a waste!). Second, the food is amazing - I was proud that my guests got to have such great food and drinks at my wedding. It was actually the food that first made us choose this place as I've been coming here for many years. Third, the service was exceptional. We had our contact Katie before the wedding who always replied back to us very quickly whenever we had questions or requests. She is so friendly and helpful and the venue was so accommodating - everything I wanted was met (not to say I had anything super crazy - but we brought in our own decorations and cake, they cut the cake for us, we got to choose how/when the food would be served, we were able to adjust their event menu options, etc); they even upgraded our beer options at no additional cost which was a super nice perk. Not only was Katie great but so were all our servers that night. Many people, including myself, noticed how attentive and friendly they were. I was so unbelievably pleased - they made me and my guests feel really special. Last extra bonus - I have a loyalty card with Lettuce Entertain You and I was able to add points from all the food/drink we bought for the event.

I will admit that I'm a tad bias because I have a big appetite and I'm not a huge fan of sharing tons of small plates because it usually leaves me hungry afterwards. That being said, a lot of the dishes were very tasty, my favorite was probably the garlic shrimp, chicken/chorizo kebob, and the bacon mac-n-cheese was pretty good too.  Everything else was just ok in my opinion. I would have been willing to give this place 4 stars, but I think the prices were a little of the high side for the average to above-average quality of them and being pretty small portions.  Most of the dishes are $10+. So at the end of the meal our total was over $230 for 5 people and because they were small plates, I was hungry again within an hour.  It was a good experience other than the price but I probably wouldn't go back mainly because its not my style.",0.9575,0.856,0.122,0.021,0.5362159863945578

2013-09-10,3.0,"Went with some friends (group of 8) on a Friday night and while we were seated promptly for our rsvp time, the service was not all that great. First, we were seated by a bus station in the middle of the room - I was closest to it at 3 ft away. I know we can't all sit far away from the bus stations, and I was fine with it, but the staff made NO effort to avoid hitting my chair, no matter how I tried to re-position it away from them. I finally had to hold my purse in my lap after a staff member knocked it off my chair, tangled it up in his feet, stepped on it twice and then kicked it 4 feet away - all without ever looking down. I politely brought the incident to his attention and, without any comment whatsoever, he simply walked away from me. My fellow ladies at the table we appalled - I'm pretty sure the men didn't even notice. Either way, the lack of an apology is unacceptable. The food was okay, if maybe a bit blah, and the serving of it by the busboys was total confusion. The wrapped dates are good (#1 & 67, 67 is better), and the spicy potatoes (#30) are okay. The shortrib stuffed pepper (#4) tasting was great. The empanadas (#52 & 62) are meh - I've had better. The pork belly with beans (#68) was a huge disappointment - it was 99% fat and totally inedible IMHO. The olives (#26) aren't worth $5. The sangria is fantastic, I will give it that. We happily put down several pitchers of it. All in all, it's a nice introductory tapas place, or a fun spot to take your out-of-town or suburban family, but there are better tapas restaurants out there if you're looking for food over atmosphere.",0.9172,0.74,0.149,0.112,0.5889400921658986

The sangria is always good and the food is amazing .  Everything was great except for one thing and that one thing made a Huge difference from the last time I visited. My favorite item on the menu had been removed and needless to say I was highly disappointed and even upset . Item # 68 which is the pork ribs with the sherry glaze had been inexplicably taken off the menu . I don't know If there is someone sitting in an office somewhere making these decisions but whoever it is needs to rethink his/her decision . The pork ribs are BY FAR the Best item on the menu and the reason why I tell all my friends and family to visit the restaurant . I even told my date just wait til you have the last item ( saved the best for last ) when I realized it had been replace with a subpar choice . I asked to speak to a manager which is something I never do ( due to the fact that I work In the industry ), mike the manager came over and was very polite and professional and I appreciated his understanding . I would have given this restaurant 5 stars if it wasn't for this extremely poor choice of removing the pork ribs, but instead I only gave it 4.

2013-08-31,4.0,"It is absolutely always a pleasure to be at Cafe BABAREEBZ! Everyone always talks about the sangria because its true: its so refreshing that you will forget that you need to drive later. Heck, one might go as far as giving it to their children on accident because it takes you back in time to the good ol days of sipping on some juice. If you live near walking-distance or are above the law, try all three pitchers! You wont regret it (maybe later). There are these pork ribs that are some of the best I've ever had! They satisfy all of rib criteria: crispy shell WITH a glaze + a true fall-off-the-bone texture. These really dont need any tooth effort for separation. Someone could pass gas in your general direction and the force of that small current of pleasant air could send the meat FLYING off these bad boys. Spicy tomato aioli potatoes are a must at these places. Loved it. Again, crispy outside and soft center in that sauce. Beef tenderloins w/ blue cheese + potato chips. I'm quite sensitive to blue cheese so I typically dont like ones that are super strong and overbearing. Here, they've got that balance between the cheese and the beef. Remarkably good! Rioja-braised short ribs broke apart when introduced to the fork. They nailed this one! Other dishes that we tried were the croquetas (get em all!), short-rib stuffed peppers, fried calamari, and empanadas (get em all!). They were are great and served as awesome fillers. Octopus a la plancha w/ fingerling potatoes and olives was probably the least favorite of the night. Perhaps we got a bad portion due to the fact that it was tough and chewy. No good! However, there were some portions of the dish that were really tender so it wouldn't be wise to dismiss this entirely. Did I mention the paella? When we had it, it was restaurant week so I'd imagine that they were mass producing the hell out of these guys. Needless to say, it wasn't memorable (I dare say that Cafe Ibierco put up a fight).

The coffee was very good and probably the best part of my brunch. But I really like coffee. So there's that.

TIP: Always, and I mean ALWAYS make reservations. Waiting is a bezatch here. Unless you don't mind getting tipsy at the bloody mary bar or ordering a whole pitcher of their awesome sangria for yourself. But be warmed, there will be many at the bar waiting around with you. So save yourself the grief, get a reservation and take your pitcher with you. -------------- Shrimp with garlic, olive oil and red pepper flakes. // Now, there is about (estimate) 5 shrimp in this dish. But, the olive oil and garlic that is left in the dish after the shrimp is 3/4 of the reason why we keep getting it. People say shun the bread basket because it just makes you full... well I say order seconds and don't LET the waiter take that bowl away. Dip it!! Bacon wrapped dates // The salty bacon with the dates? How can you say no? It's like the Spanish version of pouring maple syrup on your bacon.

Octopus a la Plancha, fingerling potatoes and olive // Overall a good hearty dish  Drink = Sangria.They have different flavors so choose one you like.

2013-08-02,4.0,"Other than the long wait because of how many people wanted to eat their delicious food, this place was awesome!  We went there with a couple friends (Hi Sherry and Kristin!) and drank way too much sangria as we tried out nine of the different plates.  Our first round was: bacon wrapped dates, fried calamari with jalapeno aioli, baked goat cheese in tomato sauce, and the beef medallions with potato chips. The bacon wrapped dates had SUCH great flavor! All bacon-y from the first bite, but the finish was with the deep sweetness of the date. It's a great flavor combo. The jalapeno aioli was absolutely wonderful with the calamari. It had a nice heat to it, which I would expect! The beef medallions were succulent and had a little bit of bleu cheese on them, but not too much, so it wasn't overpowering. The potato chips were fine, but I'm not a plain potato chip person. The goat cheese came with some crostinis to spread it on and they were perfectly crisp without being too hard to bite into. Our second round was: asparagus with manchego cheese, the mushroom, onion and arugula flatbread, and spicy roasted potatoes. The asparagus was perfectly cooked and had a great grilled flavor to it, especially on the tips. The flatbread was very tasty, but I felt it was missing something. Maybe a tiny sprinkling of lemon juice or a vinegar reduction. The spicy potatoes were just roasted potatoes with some kind of spicy mayo which wasn't spicy. I was disappointed with that one. When you say ""spicy"", I WANT SPICY.  Third round was dessert: caramel almond bar with a butter crust, and the butterscotch pot de creme. Heaven in my mouth. I had to take a few bites despite the fact that I am allergic to dairy, and it was worth the digestive counterattack. That butterscotch pot de creme was topped with a thin layer of a salted caramel sauce which complemented it perfectly. The best way to eat the caramel almond bar was to take a bit and chew it slowly while it melted in your mouth. Then all the flavors really popped out before you swallowed it. Also, the two dessert plates were free because we checked in here on yelp! Totally worth it.",0.9977,0.796,0.191,0.013,0.5106312292358804

If you are someone who doesn't like to share food then I absolutely would not recommend this place because part of the experience is trying all the different things.   Everything I tried was delicious and all the food was excellently prepared.  I highly recommend the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce.  Plus, if you check in on Yelp, you receive a free dessert! The butterscotch dessert, although small, was divine.   The one downside I have, is I feel like I spent a lot of money and did not get a ton of food.  This might be a matter of perception because I never ate a ton of one thing, but I am just throwing it out there.  Overall, it was a great experience and I will definitely be dining here again.",0.993,0.726,0.223,0.051,0.4975333333333333

2013-05-20,3.0,"My friend and I were shopping in Lincoln Park, and decided to stop here for a late lunch because I'd heard great things about the food from multiple people. The restaurant was still full at around 2-3pm, so they offered to seat us at the bar. BIGGEST MISTAKE. Since the bar is near the exit of the kitchen, separated from the main dining area, service was extremely slow. From the beginning, we had to flag down the busboys to alert the waiter to even give us our menus. This continued throughout our meal, and we barely ever saw our waiter unless he was placing the dish on our table. Also, they were having some catering event that day, so behind our seats there were waiters rushing out of the kitchen moving around heavy trays and carts. Not only was it consistently loud, but we were bumped into more than a few times. Not exactly my ideal dining environment. If I were only reviewing the food, however, I'd give the restaurant 4 stars. We ordered the Baked goat cheese (#32), Bacon wrapped dates (#67), and Paella Valenciana. I usually order these three dishes at every tapas place I visit, and Cafe-Ba-Ba-Reeba measured up to the others. Though everything was pretty good, I definitely prefer the bacon-wrapped dates at Tapas Barcelona or Avec.  OVERALL: If you're not sitting at the bar (but rather, in the main dining area), you'll probably enjoy this place. Definitely order the baked goat cheese and paella valenciana. I don't think I'll come back just because there are so many other tapas restaurants to try in Chicago.",0.9813,0.88,0.107,0.013,0.48501984126984127

They were still talking about it the next morning.  There were 4 of us so we got a few different kinds of sangria. We got the white peach, regular red and blackberry. The blackberry was a little sweet for us but that didn't stop us from finishing all 3 half pitchers! And I like that you can get half pitchers to try different flavors. They even have seasonal flavors which I think is really cool. Now for the delicious food.. We each got a chorizo-wrapped date that is a MUST get! So so good.  We then went onto the artisanal cheese plate. It was good cheese and they this really yummy grapefruit marmalade. I don't like anything grapefruit but this was tasty!  Next was fried calamari, YUMMY! I thought the breading on this was really good!! Another great seafood dish was the garlic/red-pepper shrimp, HOLY COW yummy!!! Short ribs and mashed potatoes, I'd get these just for the mashed potatoes! The short rib was good but nothing I just had to have again. And my least favorite thing we ordered were the chicken & ham croquetas. There was nothing special about them. They looked frozen and not fresh like everything else that came out. My friend really enjoyed them though.  Needless to say, this will not be my last time going here.

2013-05-19,5.0,"oh. em. gee.  From start to finish,every single bite was nothing but deliciousness. I must warn, it seems like a lot of dishes are cooked in oil, so if you value your heart, buyer beware. It's truly not crazy greasy at all, but if you're super cautious about what you eat, this would be my only concern. I digress. Seriously, though. I think that this is a must-try for everyone, once in their life. Awesome ambience. The outdoor patio with sunroof is gorgeous! Great ambience. Perfect for taking a date, or group of 4. I really wouldn't recommend more, otherwise you'd need to double up on your dishes- everything's so delicious, one bite is not enough.  Here's what we got. *Scallops- absolute, hands down, best dish we tried! bacon bits and some greens. Just perfectly delectable. *Beef skewer with red onions and horseradish cream. I like horseradish cream, my sister doesn't. Tastes amazing whether you add the cream or not. perfect heartiness. *bacon wrapped dates- Great combo of bite-sized sweet and savory. *Squid with arugula- I'd ABSOLUTELY recommend this over the calamari. Although I haven't tried the calamari, it's a great alternative to fried squid. Beautiful texture, delicately grilled. Not chewy at all, and just tasted great. *Stuffed mushrooms with manchego and spinach- great for vegetarians and non-veggies alike! Best stuffed mushrooms I've had, I think. *Spicy potatoes with tomato aioli- perfect for filling up for fullness. couldn't stop snacking up on these! i was like, '""this would be great with fries!-- oh wait, I'm eating potatoes with em aren't I"" for drinks, my sister and I ordred a pitcher of the black raspberry sangria. It's a creeper! can't even taste the alcohol and then it sneaks up on you. A 1/2 pitcher would have probably been good enough for the two of us, so I'd recommend the full pitcher for 4.

One little thing is that I drink a lot of water, so the helpers could have kept up on that a little more, for my taste. From start to finish, beautiful atmosphere, great service, and delicious food.

2013-04-24,4.0,"Fun place for a date night. I feel like tapas always invite more food sharing, conversation, and laughter into a meal. If only every meal were tapas style, then I could feel less like a pig when I eat off of my boyfriend's plate. Anywhoo, let's get to the meal! Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba has a large interior, but that won't stop them from filling up ASAP. Make sure you make a recommendation a few days in advance at least, otherwise you'll be waiting for a while. But wait! Want to eat a bit early and get your food for cheaper? Try to sit at the bar at any time between 4-6. The tapas are significantly cheaper (I think $3). No idea about the drinks but I'm sure they still have specials. We chose to forgo sampling their famous sangrias, because med school sucks and you can't have any fun ever. Oh..wait....shoot, there I go rambling again. The food had it's pros and cons, and there were definitely more pros.  Pros: Great service. Our waiter was super attentive, gave suggestions, and wasn't overbearing. Water was always filled. He told us that usually 2-3 tapas per person is enough. We unfortunately didn't listen and ordered 7. Fooood comaaa. The goat cheese, pistachio, mint, and orange preserve jarras with bread was absolutely to die for. Tangy soft goat cheese melded with the crunchiness of the pistachios and the sweetness of the preserves. Couldn't get enough of this! Unfortunately we had to because it was a tiny jar. Sad faces. Boyfriend loved the taste of the lamb kebabs and said they were delicious. The not so delicious part? Getting two two-inch kebabs for $9.  More Pro than Con: The mushroom and sherry soup, the sweet potato bravas, spinach and manchego mushrooms, and goat cheese baked in tomato sauce were just alerady. The soup tasted similar to traditional mushroom soup that I could make myself, and there really was no ""pop"" of flavor.  The sweet potato bravas were just sweet potato fries served with some kind of aioli. It said it was pomegranate aioli, but that must have been the nectar of the gods as far as I'm concerned. It was sweet and tangy, and perfectly complemented the sweetness of the fries. It may have been balsamic aioli now that I think of it. The goat cheese baked in tomato sauce was literally just that. A round of goat cheese in a traditional tomato sauce. Not worth getting unless you want something to dip your bread it. Comes with pesto bread as well that were alright. The filling for the mushrooms was creamy and delicious. The mushrooms themselves weren't seasoned well at all. I found myself eating the inside and leaving the mushroom caps.  The cons: The spicy potatoes with tomato aioli. The aioli was again delicious here and was definitely the star. The potatoes kind of tasted like homefries. They were on the well done side, so for those of you that don't like almost-burnt food, stay away (I happen to love it). What I didn't love about this dish was the MASSIVE AMOUNT OF OIL that was in the plate. You literally saw the red oil seeping out of the potatoes as you speared them on a fork. You know there's too much oil when an  INDIAN person is dabbing the food in an extra towel.  I like and don't like the fact that the food comes out at different times. I like it because then the tables around you don't judge you for how much food you get, and you can work on things slowly and savor your food. I don't like it because of how awkward it is when one person has food and another doesn't. You can't really have them wait otherwise the food will get cold (or you can do what I did and just eat half of your boyfriend's order).  Also, not a fan of the price. For the amount of food we got, portions could have been altered a bit. Will definitely come back for happy hour to try out the drinks and get cheaper appetizers. 7 tapas for 2 people ran us about $50 not including tip.",0.9989,0.772,0.186,0.042,0.5982022607022607

2013-03-15,4.0,"After being contacted by a very concerned manager after my last experience (which I yelped), I was more than happy to stop back in and give them a try. I am glad I did. Went in on a very busy Sunday evening. Place was full and we were seated in back. I was a little worried that we would get forgotten back there but I was wrong about that. Unlike the last time, our waiter was outstanding. Wish I remembered his name. Tall skinny white guy. He never left us too long but didn't over do it either. The bus boys were on it too: Waters always full and plates always quickly cleaned. Full water is something I am soooooo picky about. Now on to the food. Uh, yum. My husband is a baker and is always extremely critical about bread. He LOVES the bread here. To start we ordered the wood roasted pepper, eggplant and tomato spread which was delicioooooousss!!! I could have ordered more but after receiving it and ordering a ridiculous amount of tapas I just couldn't. I ordered the citrus cured salmon thinking it was one I had last time and they had no problem switching it for the one I thought it was. That grilled salmon & pesto is on point. One thing I adore about this place is the sauces, and my husband agrees. Fish was cooked to perfection. Apple spinach salad w/ quinoa was ok, nothing special. Could have used a few more apples. Needed salt or more acidity. Wasn't bad though and perfectly dressed.   Chicken empanada wasn't as good as I remember it but I think that was my pallet with the other items. He enjoyed it. Lamb Kabab: Great flavor and juicy. Sauce was bomb.  As usual I love love LOVED the stuffed mushrooms. Great flavor and a nice crunch on top. Those patatas bravas. Um, yum. That sauce. Lord that sauce. Husband really loved the shrimp with garlic and ended up dipping bread in the olive oil marinade it was in. I wasn't in the mood for shrimp so I didn't have any but he said he loved it.  For dessert I had the butter scotch which was great!!! Loved it. Hubby ordered a kids portion of the churros. We both preferred them alone without the chocolate sauce.  We also had two cups of coffee but GASP $3.25 for a small cup! I found that to be a little expensive. Overall I had a great dining experience and will definitely be back. Being that my last experience (service wise) wasn't 100%, I will bump them up to 5 stars if my next visit is as good as this one.

Needless to say, a half pitcher of white peach sangria added to that effect. #lightweight  The highlights of our dinner were the roasted dates with bacon in apple vinaigrette, fried calamari with tomato sauce and ailoli, and meatballs with sherry tomato sauce. If you haven't yet, you should really hop onto the ""bandwagon"" and order not one but all three of these.   The other dishes, chicken and ham croquette and seafood paella, were also very likable. We ordered two servings of the paella. The rice didn't seem to be 100% cooked. A few pieces of rice here and there were a bit difficult, but they were very generous with the shrimp and scallop.  Our waiter was certainly a charmer. He complemented our desserts, butterscotch custard and dark chocolate crema, while also adding a third one, the chocolate truffle cake, to his tab.

2013-03-11,5.0,"Some friends and I started a Food Club where we explore different cuisines once a quarter. Before you think ""Wow a food club. how impressive."" It's not impressive at all. It's just a group of friends that want to eat, drink and try new places. Our 3rd official club meeting was this past weekend at Cafe Ba Ba Reeba. We made rezzy's for 10 but of course 3 people bailed within 15 minutes of the time we planned to leave. The restaurant was really nice and didn't get huffy when we explained that a few people bailed at the last minute. Our service was phenomenal from start to finish. One thing that I especially appreciated here versus where we went last weekend (Girl and the Goat) is that you can order your tapas 1 at a time, whereas G&G they make you order everything all at once. There is no rush to get you out the door here. In fact, we were there well over 2 hours and the waitress didn't seem bothered by it at all.  What we ordered: -1/2 pitcher of Peach sangria. At $14, it was a steal. One glass of Sangria is $7 and I think I got at least 4-5 drinks out of the pitcher. Tasted phenomenal. -Goat Cheese Croqueta Pintxo. A one-biter that was okay but I probably wouldn't order again. -Deviled Egg with Bacon Pintxo. Why don't my deviled eggs taste that good? So fluffy and airy. I wish I could figure out the secret ingredient! -Spicy potatoes with tomato aioli. Pretty good but they taste like fried potatoes that I make at home. The tomato aioli was good, but not sure if I would get these again. My friend had these before and said she remembered them being better -- maybe it was just an off night? -Rioja braised short ribs w/ mashed potatoes. So yummy! The mashed potatoes tasted like white cheddar mashed potatoes and were the perfect compliment to the tender, juicy short ribs.  -Beef skewer and horseradish sauce. This was my favorite thing that WE ordered. The beef was extremely moist and the flavoring on the beef went perfect with the horseradish.   -Serrano ham, salchichon, chorizo and manchengo. This was a cold plate of meat which we didn't realize when we ordered it. If we ordered it first, it would have been a great start, but we ordered it last so it was a let down. What I tried but didn't order myself: -Bacon wrapped dates- definitely my favorite of the night and a shame that I didn't trust the reviews and order them. Super tender and soft and one of those foods you could eat the entire plate and then order another. -Fried calimari with jalapeno aioli. I've never had calimari with anything other than marinara so this was a pleasant surprise. It wasn't greasy at all but still very flavorful. Another dish that I wish I ordered. -Roasted Chicken empanada. Pretty good and about what you can expect of an empanada, but compared to all of the other awesome dishes it wasn't brag worthy. -Goat cheese baked in tomato sauce. This looked interesting when it came out and seeing the big ball of cheese in the center of some sauce made me apprehensive that it wasnt going to be special. It actually was very VERY good. Dessert: -Carmelized banana w/ toasted pistachios. Yummy! It was torched in the same manner as creme brulee so you got a nice crunchy topping along with the nuts. -Butterscotch custard cream. Me and several others at the table enjoyed this the most. It's basically custard with homemade butterscotch on top. -Churros with cinnamon and chocolate dipping sauces. I didn't order this but someone else at the table did. It was pretty good, but probably my least favorite out of all 3 desserts I tried. I was overwhelmingly impressed by everything that I tried. Nothing I tasted was BAD and I tasted a good portion of the menu. Our bill for food, dessert, tax and tip was around $70 which included 2 desserts, 4 tapas, and 3 pintxos. Drinks were separate as we purchased those at the bar before dinner.  Only downfall of the whole experience is that the women's bathroom is TINY. Two girls were waiting in line before I entered and there really was no room for 3 girls to stand. There's also only one sink, so it made it incredibly awkward as I tried to brush my teeth after dinner and even got a few oral hygiene jokes made at my expense.",0.9993,0.749,0.206,0.045,0.5815611351611353

The best part of course is the food, every single dish I've had there is absolutely to die for. From the bacon wrapped dates to the beef dishes to the seafood dishes to the desserts, I have not had a tapas plate I didn't enjoy. The sangria and craft cocktails are diverse and delicious. The service is impeccable, and they know how to handle large parties. To me, the atmosphere they create is what I would hope to find in an exotic Spanish city, full of life, laughter, and great food.

I loved the hustle and bustle, the warm dining rooms, being close to other people with their friends and family. It felt like what it might be like to be in Spain.

I would definitely suggest to check-in on foursquare as you get a free pintxo. Throughout all the times I've been for dinner, I've learned you can never go without their red sangria. You don't realize it at first, but after a few sips, it does you in for the night. The tortilla, patatas bravas (the BEST choice, esp for that damn good sauce), stuffed mushrooms, goat cheese baked in tomato, the calamari and octopus are all phenomenal.  For brunch (which I recently discovered), the french toast pintxo is AMAZING. You will need to order about 3 because you can't get enough of the divine, perfectly-textured stick. The vanilla yogurt pintxo is sweet and solid but the short stack pancake pintxo is just ok. Potato and egg bite was heavenly as well as their spinach and artichoke crepe.

2013-03-01,3.0,"What I'm basing this review on:  Lamb kebab Spicy potatoes  Bread spreads  Cured meats platter Bacon wrapped dates Chicken paella I'm by nature skeptical of tapas places. With smaller portions sizes and high prices, it takes a lot more flavor wowness to deliver overall value. This place had some great dishes but just didn't quite get to 4 star status.  Lamb kebab- pretty good. Doesn't really stand out really from a standard seasoned meat dish. I didn't find myself reaching for a second one after the first.  Spicy potatoes- These definitely had the ""oh wow"" factor. These taste so so good and have a strong kick that surprises you in the end. Definitely getting this again.  Bread spreads: Yea, good. Not amazing. But good. That pretty much sums it up.  Cured meats platter (called something else)- I really like this. The prosciutto and the salami were great. There was just enough for everyone to get a slice of something at our table, I wish we had ordered a second one.  Bacon wrapped dates- There are a lot of very favorable reviews for these and the waiter enthusiastically recommended it. It was ok but I think I just need to admit to myself I'm not a fan of dates. I've tried several supposedly amazing date dishes at several restaurants but never really enjoyed any of them. If you like dates, maybe this dish is good. If not, this dish won't change your mind.  Chicken paella- Again, good. Nothing special.  Overall it was a good meal with good sangria. While some of the dishes were definitely 4-5 star value quality, there wasn't enough to justify an overall 4 star rating.

My other fellow foodie boyfriend went with me on a one fine night for a dinner. I've been really wanting to try this place for awhile, and was glad that they participate during restaurant week. We had a four course meal and it was amazing!  here's the breakdown  first course: pintxos :  Goat Cheese Croqueta Deviled Egg, Bacon & Mustard Both were soo delicious, kind of sucked that it was only a one biter. The goat cheese croqueta had an interesting taste for me at first when I first bit into it, but after a few seconds, that when the party officially begins. Deviled egg was standard but with a little bit of spices into it.  second course: tapas  Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Alioli, Rioja-Braised Short Ribs, Mashed Potatoes, Serrano Ham, Salchichon, Chorizo & Manchego, Roast Dates With bacon & apple vinaigrette.  All were spectacular, but I would have the spicy potatoes and roast dates with bacon & apple again and again.  third course: paella  We both had Shrimp, Sea Scallops, and Green Beans.  It was a huge portion, If I was going to try their paella again, I think 1 would be best for 2 people. It was  soo good, I just wish they would get a bigger kind of scallop in it, but it was still good nevertheless.  fourth course:   Gala apple empanada and caramelized banana  boyfriend tried the empanada and had a little bit of it, I love the dipping sauce it come with. It spark a debacle with my bf and I about evaporated milk and condensed milk.lol. I had the caramelized banana, and it just melted perfectly in my mouth with all the elements it came with.

It was the perfect combination of crusty and soft.  For our tapas, we ordered the shrimp with garlic, olive oil, and red pepper flakes (#44), very delicious. We also ordered the calamari (#45), which is some of the best calamari I've ever had. It wasn't too greasy, making you feel too full.  We also ordered the grilled salmon with herb almond pesto (#47), also very tasty. We also ordered the spicy potatoes with tomato aioli (#30) which I loved! The sauce that came with this one was to die for. We also ordered the rioja-braised short ribs with mashed potatoes (#51) Oh my goodness, the meat was so tender that it melted in your mouth. The mashed potatoes appeared bland but were jam-packed with flavor! We also ordered the spinach and manchego-stuffed mushrooms (#31), which I liked even though I don't like mushrooms.

The French toast is to die for, and since it is small, you don't feel like a total glutton. The shortcomings to me, as odd as it sounds, are the chairs. The patio has metal, tiny, flimsy chairs which I found kind of odd and uncomfortable. They reminded me of the cheap folding chairs from a grade school assembly or something. I feel like they could upgrade a bit here. Also, as delicious as everything on the menu is, there's not a huge selection and the menu is rarely updated. Maybe it's just me, but I like choices.

Unfortunately we didn't start off well since we waited 40 minutes to be seated even though we had a reservation. We weren't seated until my husband went and inquired about it to the host and apparently they had overlooked our names and were seating people with 8:45 reservations even though ours was at 8:00. We were not feeling optimistic to start. One of the managers working there stopped by once we were seated to apologize and in fact bought our pitcher of sangria, which was so nice that all was forgiven.  Our service was good, the food was delicious, and it was well timed. Stand out dishes we thought were the lamb kebobs, meatballs, bacon wrapped dates and the endive and blue cheese salad.

The more, the merrier!  I've been to Ba-Ba-Reeba a few times, most recently this past sunday, and they always deliver a solid experience.  One of my favorite things about the restaurant is that you can order ""1 bite"" portions of tapas for super cheap, around $1-3. .  Its a way to get the best from a tapas experience while not getting hit too hard on the bill.  The 1 bite tapas are really good too! This past sunday we had the dates stuffed with goat cheese and wrapped in bacon (delish) and the pepper stuffed with meat.  Very yummy as well!  The sangria is solid, gets you just tipsy enough and is reasonably priced.  A pitcher that gives you 7 glasses of sangria costs you about $20 which is a steal.  You can also choose from different flavors like passion fruit and berry.  We really enjoyed the passion fruit one. We also had the octopus that day which we loved though, for $9, the portion seemed a bit small.  The lamb dish we had, also in the $10 range, wan't special and also a bit overpriced in my estimation.  Both tasted great but I think they both should have been priced around $7-8.

We ordered 2 plates each for sharing. Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce, ahi tuna, garlic shrimp, crispy potatoes, meatballs, short ribs, one chicken dish and bacon wrapped dates. We also had churros for dessert. Nothing was good at all.  Baked goat cheese : very basic. It wasn't hot when it arrived. Ahi tuna: just ok garlic shrimp: recommended dish of room-temperature shrimp swimming in sea of oil crispy potatoes: just a soggy potatoes with thousand island-like dipping I didn't have the rest of the dishes but my friends said they were just 'ok' Churros were the biggest disappointment. I was hoping dessert will change how I feel about the place but it didn't. Churros were soggy, not crispy and was not hot. Churros you get from a carnival would taste better than this. The only reason I give it a 2-star is because I enjoyed the dark raspberry sangria and the service was good.",0.9655,0.824,0.146,0.031,0.5375771604938272

2013-01-24,1.0,"My party of 7 went for brunch, so maybe that's the reason this place didn't live up to the 1300+ other reviews.  The service was horrendous. Everyone got their food at different times - there was at least a 10 minute lapse between the first dish that was dropped off and the last. The servers continuously dropped food off at one end of the table and expected us to pass the plates around - they had no interest and giving the correct person their plate. They wouldn't even announce the dishes, so we had to try and figure out each dish. They seemed completely oblivious to the concept of good service. And the biggest annoyance was that the place was not extremely crowded. There were at least 15 open tables around us, so I'm not sure why service was bad when it wasn't busy . In terms of food - I don't think you can call something ""Bacon Mac & Cheese"" when it's just a plate of mac & cheese with a slice of bacon on top. Also, is the brick egg supposed to come with a raw egg? When my friend cut through the fried outer layer of his dish, the entire egg was runny, from the whites to the yolk. It was disgusting. And the waiter, while polite and gracious in getting my friend's replacement order, never apologized for an obviously undercooked dish - he seemed to brush it off as typical. My dish (chorizo, manchego, and vegetable omelet) was good enough though. The waffle-battered chicken stick was not impressive - it looked and tasted like a stunted corndog. I would save my $2 for another novelty. My friends who'd been here for dinner couldn't even remembered they'd been here before, and once they did recall that meal, they shook their heads and said we should have picked another restaurant.",0.7724,0.829,0.094,0.077,0.5626837606837607

Food - Ordered a bunch of pintxos (waffle-battered chicken stick, potato & egg bite, deviled egg w/ bacon) as well as some tapas (sausage fried paella w/ poached egg and bacon mac n/cheese). While the waffled chicken stick was tasty, pretty much everything else we ordered was very bland. I was especially disappointed with the bacon mac n/cheese which was literally just two strips of bacon placed on a plate of watery mac n/cheese. The paella was also flavorless, and the rice was crusty and dry. Also, at least two individuals in our group had eggs that were under cooked which was surprising given the number of egg based items are on the menu (you'd think they could get that right).  Service - Slow and disorganized. Instead of spreading out the courses, the Pintxos came out with other people's main dishes or tapas.

My favorites are the Goat Cheese & Tomato Sauce, Spicy Potatoes, Bacon Wrapped Dates, Garlic Shrimp, and Stuffed Mushrooms. Make sure you get enough to share! They recommend 2-3 per person.  After the last plate was dropped off and we finished our small plates, our waiter kept refilling our water and allowed us to stay and catch up after he dropped the check off. We ended up staying for about an HOUR after he dropped it off, and never once tried to push us out of the restaurant! You don't find that too much these days.

When you enter the doorway, there is a little corridor prior to arriving at the front desk, and I think this was the waiting area for people without reservations. Arrived a little early, so the hostess advised us to wait at the bar. The wait was at most 5 minutes, and we were directed to our table. The stroll to our table made us realize how big this establishment was. We sat down and the waitress went over the menu, and pointed out a few tips (like recommending 2~3 plates per person). But we had already reviewed the posted pix on Yelp, so we were already set on ordering several items. The house Sangria for the night was a pomegranate sangria, so we ordered the pitcher. The sangria was delicious, and wenｔ down like having a refreshing fruit punch. Plano platter Salmon cream cheese sauce with cucumber. Generous portions. Octopus. Nice sautéed in olive oil Short ribs. Excellent mashed potatoes Skewers. Very nice horseradish sauce. Sausages. Four kinds of yum mines. Paella. Chicken was done just right. Empanadas. Homemade taste. Side of tomato aioli mayo.

I returned for my umpteenth trip to Babareeba a few weeks ago with 2 girlfriends and we decided to try some new things. It also doesn't feel cheesy and overplayed like other LEYE restaurants. It's very unique and I like that about it. The outdoor patio is to die for, I really want to go back in the summer and sit there for drinks.  First off, get the sangria. The pitcher or half pitcher is well worth the money and you're going to drink it all. The peach is my favorite because it doesn't even taste like alcohol.  Some of the other noteworthy things I enjoyed were the patatas bravas. This is probably the best thing I've ever had at this restaurant. The paella is also good, but takes 30 minutes to make. Also one of my favorites is the goat cheese marinara with garlic bread. I've also been here for brunch and had cinnamon french toast, which was simple but delicious.

We had a reservation for 7:30 on a Saturday night. We got there a few minutes early and the wait staff seated us promptly. It is wise to make a reservation,as this restaurant was still on a wait at 9:00 pm when we finished up dinner. We were seated right away. I loved the idea of tapas as the three of us could share smaller plates and try a variety of different dishes. We started off with the Peach Sangria which was amazing. All of the dishes that we did try were full of flavor. The patatas bravas are a must try when dining here. We also had dates wrapped in bacon, sweet potatoes which I am not a fan of to begin with and ended up loving. We also got a goat cheese with marinara sauce that was served with garlic bread. We ended up ordering the seafood Paella, which was enough to make us full at the end of the night. You should order this ahead of time as it does take 30 minutes to make.  The waitstaff was prompt, the food did not take long to get, and the bus boys made sure  your plates were taken away when you were done and you had new plates at your table.

The menu is pretty extensive, but they make it pretty simple to pick what to order, since all their house favorites are marked in red. We had the shrimp, spicy potatoes, and short rib (all marked in red), and the chicken empanada. All really tasty, flavorful, etc. My favorite was probably the shrimp--it had garlic and hot peppers, oil, all that good stuff.

2012-11-13,5.0,"Somehow I lived in Lincoln Park for four years and managed to never visit this place--walked by it about a thousand times, sure, but never stopped in. Saturday night my cousin and her fiancé were in town from Grand Rapids, and while they had originally wanted to try Kuma's, they balked at the idea of a two-hour wait. He had been to Café Ba-Ba-Reeba once before; Café Ba-Ba-Reeba it would be.      Oh, but speaking of two-hour waits, that's precisely what we were presented with upon arrival. I had called earlier in the evening to attempt to make a reservation, and after I was told that the only time slots available were 4:30 and 10:30, we agreed to take a chance in the 8 o'clock hour. Oof.      I'll give Café BBR this, though: Our name was called almost exactly two hours after we arrived. I'm talking to the minute. And the two hours didn't end up being so bad: We drank a pitcher of sangria in the bar while we were waiting for our table.      We went about the ordering process in typical nerd fashion: We agreed that we would order eight dishes for the four of us, so everyone would write down their top two choices followed by a third ""kind of want""-type choice. And, hurrah!, there was enough overlap so that everyone got all three items on his/her wish list. When going to a tapas restaurant, I highly recommend bringing a small notepad and pen. We were feeling so good about this that we threw in one more item, the meatballs, which, as it happened, would have been a regrettable omission.      Pear sangria was also ordered. Upon first sip, my cousin remarked, ""Oh, that's going to be a problem."" She meant this in a good way, in case that wasn't clear. Pear sangria=revelation.      Let me make this easy. Here are the items we ordered: artisanal cheese, garlic potato salad, spicy potatoes with tomato alioli (another cousin quote: ""Alioli makes everything better""), goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, rioja-braised short ribs with mashed potatoes, handmade beef empanada, seared Spanish sausages, grilled salmon with herb almond pesto, and of course the aforementioned meatballs. At the meal's end, we all agreed that there wasn't a single item we would have omitted. The salmon was insanely flavorful, the empanada was overflowing with meat, and the short ribs fell away from each other in a manner that made me want to cry. Even the mashed potatoes were above average in a way that a dumb old potato is not supposed to be: cheesy, extra creamy, flavored with something else I couldn't identify, really good mashed potatoes for the love of Pete.      I suppose you must take this review with a grain of salt, given that we were all starving and buzzed by the time the food arrived.      Our waitress was somewhat short with us a couple times, but she likely was on the tail end of a very long day. I do like to give people the benefit of the doubt. However, when my cousin's fiancé innocently asked which spices were in the blood sausage, she pulled the whole martyr routine by making clear that she would ask someone even though she was in no mood to ask someone. When she returned ten minutes later, she said something about her manager having to ""go to the basement"" to find the answer. Um, okay? Again, though--probably had been a long day.      As it happened, the unidentifiable ingredient was cinnamon. My cousin's fiancé was happy to know this.      I will happily return to this place, and make sure I make a reservation sometime prior to the day of next time.",0.9923,0.821,0.123,0.056,0.48918430335097

2012-11-03,3.0,"Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is a festive and energetic venue to have a date night or share tapas among friends. The other night a group of ten of us got together to celebrate successfully completing marathons; while OK eight of us completed marathons - one in the group had a good excuse (she was eight and three quarter months pregnant) and one not so good (I am too lazy to train for a marathon, so settled for a half).  Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba features a vast array of tapas and breaks them into categories including pintxos (bite sized tapas, kind of like a Spanish amuse bouche but harder to pronounce), vegetarian/cheese, seafood, beef/lamb, and chicken/pork. There are also a few nice paellas to choose from and housemade breads with dips (there is also complimentary basic bread service with olive oil) and of course desserts (there are full sized desserts of dessert pintxos). Sangria is quite popular here (available by the pitcher, half pitcher or glass and in traditional or flavored - there is even a Cava based Sangria); for those not fans of Sangria there is a decent list of reasonably priced Spanish wines (running as low as $28 per bottle and many selections under $50) as well as beer (including some on tap) and cocktails. Adding value there are often freebies you can redeem if you check in via Foursquare or Yelp. As we are distance runners, we tend to have hearty appetites and this enabled us to order a huge variety of tapas (we must have consumed nearly half the menu)! Nearly everything we tried was good, but I would not say there was a single must have dish and the menu did not seem to have changed much since I was last here a couple of years ago. Since my fine dining kick I have been on for the past year and a half I am always nervous returning to venues I used to love before becoming spoiled by Chicago's top tier restaurants, but Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba did not disappoint. For $40 a person (including tax, tip and moderate alcohol) we were able to eat like kings.  Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is open nightly for dinner and also has Friday lunch and weekend brunch. They post special events on their website such as a Flamenco Dinner Show with music and dancing and Paella Cooking Demos. The atmosphere is lively and casual and the decor is made to transport you to Spain without being tacky or overdone. Service is reasonably attentive and adequate.  Ba-Ba-Reeba is a popular venue so it can be a bit noisy and reservations are recommended (they are on Open Table). There is a large bar where you can enjoy a glass of Sangria as you wait for your party to arrive, but I did appreciate that they sat us before our entire party arrived. The menu has a nice variety of food to choose from (even the vegetarians in our group found plenty to keep them happy) and while the food is certainly not outstanding, for the money it is a good choice if you are in the mood for Spanish tapas.",0.9981,0.784,0.192,0.024,0.50884074941452

Also, make sure you get the short rib stuffed piquillo pepper. It's a perfect bit.  The paella is ALSO awesome. It's hard to save room for it (it takes awhile to prepare) when you've eaten all the delicious tapas, but you have to try. I like the seafood combo, but husband likes the chicken & pork.

I am not big on tapas or Spanish food, so I had no expectations walking in. They defiantly blew me out of the water on everything. The waitress recommended that each person pick 3 plates each and then just pass around everything to share, so that's what we did. A little tip that is WAY too much food!!!!! We were swimming in plates. But everything was very tasty, there was not a single plate ordered that we did not enjoy. My recommendation is to look for the things you know you like chicken, steak, veggie, or seafood and pick anything that sounds good. We went with a few adventurous options and really enjoyed those as well!!   The wait staff was aware it was my friend's birthday based on conversations etc, and without even asking brought her a complimentary dessert with a candle. (I was really impressed with that, just shows how attentive the wait staff is!!!) She got a taste test of a few different things and they were all tasty. I would not ordinarily order flan but from here I would HIGHLY recommend it. It was rich and had a distinct caramel taste which I love!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE BLACK RASPBERRY SANGRIA!!!

The second time was early, around 10am when they opened. The service was prompt, but we had a different issue. I understand when the restaurant first opens there are not many tables to attend so the servers stand around, but we felt down-right uncomfortable eating because we were being watched by different servers who were not busy. It was hard to relax and enjoy the food when we could see them just standing there watching us. Quite uncomfortable. This is more a note to the business, just something to keep in mind.

Me and my boyfriend have had this many times including the times in Spain and this was far most the worse paella we've ever had. The dish was VERY salty. Seafood can be salty by themselves and it tasted like they took a handful of Morton salt and dumped it on the paella (NO, seriously, that's how salty it was). We didn't really complain to management because we were running late for Blue Man Group (and our server was really slow) so we just paid our bill, left the leftovers, and bought a bottle of water at a nearby shop.

2012-08-23,4.0,"I have visited Ba Ba Reeba on several occasions for several different reasons - brunch, date night, work dinner, cocktails and appetizers at the bar, double dates - and Ba Ba Reeba is fitting for all of them. As a Lettuce restaurant you can rest assured that it's run like a well oiled, always bustling, machine. Typical of any Lettuce or LP restaurant, without (and sometimes even with) a reservation you will always have a wait, but they have a decent size bar area to try and squeeze into. The patio is great, covered and lit with hanging lights. The service is always reliable, nothing exceptional, but no complaints. I love the way the tapas menu is set up, you can pick and choose from different meats, seafoods, veg, etc. mixing and matching as you go. And since the food arrives pretty quickly, it's great to keep a menu on hand to not only remember what you order but always add more. Having been there many times, I've had many of the menu items, but the below are my standout favorites: - Sangria - any one of them are delicious. True, they may have a tad too much ice and could use a smidge more sangria, but then again I could always use a little more sangria - Bloody mary bar - sure, there are dozens of places with a build your own bloody mary bar, but theirs is fantastic. You pick your vodka and your given a glass to fill with all your favorite things. They have several different tomato juices to choose from, a wide range of hot sauces and a wide assortment of the proper accoutrements - all of which are critical to a perfect bloody mary - Grilled Squid with Olive Oil & Garlic - I honestly crave this quite often. The squid is perfectly grilled and seasoned with a nice balance of oil, acid and herbs. - Avocado Pintxo Toast - Just a small bite of toasty bread smeared with avocado, it's a nice, fresh, easy bite  - Artisanal Cheese Plate - I imagine the cheeses change quite often, but it's a guaranteed good plate of bites and I've never been disappointed Four stars for good service, consistent food and a great standby.

Service was ok, but the food didn't taste fresh. We ordered a paella, which they used to make upon your order and serve it with the pan. This time they brought the rice on a plate; it seemed like it had been cooked a while ago and they just cooked the pork and mixed it up. Even worse, I took a bite of a piece of pork and thought it was probably undercooked, but I just kept telling myself ""nah, it's just a bit of the fat"". Well, I got soooo sick later that night I regretted not spitting it out when the thought first crossed my mind. Oh, and the sangria? I never cared about it. I always thought it was tasteless, but this time I thought I'd try the peach sangria for a change...nah.

I don't think I've had a bad thing on the menu, but I have yet to try many of the dishes. Also, the sangria is superb - I particularly love the classic red and the white peach. My one friend is convinced that Babareeba should sell the peach sangria in an ""adult juicebox"" because she loved it so much. It's also a very beautiful restaurant, with lots to offer everyone. The waitstaff is really attentive considering how busy it gets too!  The Bad: It's a bit rushed on a weekend, so be prepared to make a reservation and stick to it! My second time at Babareeba, I was running really late and had to cancel my reservation and was told I could not reschedule it because it was a Friday. Luckily, we got a seat at the bar and still were able to have our full meal, but it was a bit loud there (but it's the bar/waiting area right next to where they announce who gets seated, so what else should I expect?).

Off the top of my head in order of awesomeness: Emilio's, Cafe Iberico and LaTasca are way way better than this place.  The waitperson had no affect whatsoever - barely friendly.  Our stuffed mushroom tapas was STONE COLD when we got it and we sent it back. She provided no apology and didn't know what to do with our mushrooms that we had already cut into. She stared at the plate of mushrooms like they were alive and said, ""Ohmigod, that's so weird!"" It's not weird, Honey; we ordered it 1/2 hour ago and it's been sitting up at the pass waiting for someone to bring it to us. Hot food eventually gets cold. The food runners were rude, just dropping plates off and disappearing, leaving dirty dishes on the table and unable or unwilling to answer simple questions ""Which tapas is this?"" and ""Can you please tell me where the rest room is located?"" The tapas themselves (when they were temperature appropriate) were good (that's why they are getting 2 stars and not 1) but not spectacular. The other reason for the 2nd star was that they had their menu sectioned off by type of meat (fish, pork, vegetable/cheese, etc) and THAT is a good idea.  However, it would have helped if we knew what was supposed to be cold and what was supposed to be hot. The waitperson acted like their olive tapenade was some exotic dish just brought to Lincoln Park last week from far off lands (""Have you ever had this before?"" the waitress says, Yes, Sweetheart, Trader Joes has the exact same thing except twice as much for half the price). She couldn't even tell us what olives were used in the making of it...yes, usually it's Kalamata but she acted like it was ""ohmigod so weird"" that I started thinking maybe it was some olive I've never heard of. The food, in general was overpriced and super small portions, even for tapas.  Again, you get more for your money and less attitude at any of the three tapas restaurants I first mentioned above. (and yes, I know Emilio's started off at Cafe BaBaReeba - thank goodness he left and opened his own place!) Clearly - we won't be back.",0.9934,0.847,0.133,0.02,0.519812925170068

Friday night, 6pm.   Predicted wait for table: 45 minutes.   Actual wait: 1+ hour   During our wait, we grabbed bar stool seats at the bar - not that comfortable - but, that's where we would stay for the next hour and a half - eating, and drinking a shit ton of sangria.  We tried every sangria on the menu except the standard white and the white peach.  My favorite was the black raspberry, but they were all really good!  Strong enough, not too sweet, and the flavored ones did have really good flavor (black rasp., mango, passion fruit).  Plus, as more sangria was consumed, the hard / no-back bar stools became more and more comfortable.  So that was a bonus.  After we gave up hope on our table and accepted the fact that we'd have to eat at the bar (not THAT terrible of a thing; and, the bartender was very nice/friendly), we ordered a few tapas:  - baked goat cheese (This really can't be bad, and it wasn't.  It was delectable.  I ate the entire thing myself) - chx empanada (omg. The flaky crust of a pot pie with a spiced pulled chx mix.  Delicious) - spare rib (The man loved it) - chx & chorizo sausages (The man loved it) - citrus cured salmon with cucumber and a cream sauce (fresh & light) Food was fabulous & came out quick; Our bartender/server was so nice & helpful; I just wish that we could have snagged a table outside.   Next time, reservations are a must!   **We walked in at 6 with no crowds / lines; we left around 7:30 and spearheaded our way through a packed front hall out onto the street.  If our wait was an hour, those people probably had at least a 2 - 3 hour wait.",0.9932,0.734,0.191,0.075,0.5153846153846154

Food was really good, but slightly more expensive than the Spanish tapas place I am used to in my native Dallas. Food came out really quickly though, and for some reason we felt rush to scarf everything down, probably our fault though! The shirtribs were awesome- extremely tender, just melted in your mouth, and the mashed potatoes were SO good with it, really buttery. Also, one of my favorites was the goat cheese spread with pistachios and orange marmalade- holy moly, I gotta try and make that one myself! Love that they have Matilda beer on tap. Blackberry (or blueberry?) sangria was light and fruity, but not too sugary- good combo with the strongly-flavored Spanish food, but...that's probably why the Spaniards created sangria in the first place.

Fortunately, we had reservations; as others have mentioned, it can get very crowded, even on weeknights. The Blueberry Patch cocktail was very nice (blueberry vodka, blueberry jam, lemon juice, honey syrup and mint), although a little light on the alcohol. Kind of like a blueberry mojito. The free bread was also tasty, and the tapas were quite good. The best were the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, the warm potato & onion omelette, the roasted chicken empanada, and the rioja-braised short ribs w/ mashed potatoes. The seared spanish sausages (chorizo, txistorra, butifarra y morcilla) and the beef skewer, horseradish cream & red onions were solid, but by the time they arrived we were already stuffed. The service was just OK. Our waiter suggested we get three tapas each, which was way too much. Two tapas per person is standard at most places, and would have been more than enough here.

The restaurant was packed when we arrived at 7:30 pm on a Saturday night. Our wait time was 1 hour. We had a pitcher of the classic white sangria while we waited at the bar. We were lucky enough to eventually get four seats in a row there and they were swooped up so fast when our party was called that the people replacing them hindered my party from getting out of the bar area! Prime real estate, I guess. The sangria was good. I was surprised that it came from a tap and that the fruit is added to the pitcher later. I thought the whole purpose was to let the fruit infuse the wine and vice versa? Oh well, still yummy.  The small plates that really stood out included the stuffed mushrooms, goat cheese in tomato sauce, gazpacho, chicken & ham croquettes Plates my Chicago native dining mates enjoyed but that I wasn't so fond of personally: ahi tuna, grilled squid Check-in offers: Facebook - free order of bacon wrapped dates Foursquare - free pinxtos platter with your first check-in Yelp: 1 free dessert Overall, fun and great dining experience. The waiter we had was very attentive and helpful with dish selections. The runners and bussers do an amazing job keeping the food coming and clearing away your plates as the small tables can get kind of crowded.

2012-07-02,5.0,"Unrivaled tapas spot in Chicago. While I don't think that there are many competitors, I challenge anyone to find better tapas in Chicago. Unfortunately, no one can, so the wait here is ludicrous or you just shouldn't try. I went to Babareeba last Friday with a group of seven. We weren't able to arrange for reservations ahead of time, and decided to put our names in. My friend first put our name in at 7:15Pm. We weren't seated until after 9Pm. With reservations, the wait isn't usually this long...I'm just giving fair warning. The sangria is a must. I love all the different types that they offer. Passion fruit is probably my favorite, but the regular red and white are very tasty staples. Our table ordered a bunch of plates to share. The complimentary bread is also far better than average.  Normally, I list my favorite dishes and the dishes that miss, but I would be listing the whole menu under the heading ""delicious."" The best approach is to come with a group of four to six people and try everything. Make sure to order the wood-roasted sweet potato bravas, rioja-braised short ribs, and the beef skewer with horseradish cream & red onions. Other favorites include any of the croquetas, the meatballs, and the spicy potato bravas. I'm not a huge fan of artichoke dip and the goat cheese spreads in general, so I would skip that but I know the rest of the table loved them.  The paella is good, but I don't think that it is necessary for a delicious and filling meal. This past trip was the first time that I had sampled the desserts thanks to a free gift with yelp check in. Thanks yelp! We all LOVED the dessert. DO NOT MISS THIS! The desserts are small bites, so you can find room after stuffing yourself with the tapas.  I didn't think that a caramelized banana could be improved upon, but Babareeba's banana dessert is fantastic. The hard sugary topping is a nice touch. The Butterscotch pudding was definately worth a taste, but it is very rich. Everyone loved the Chocolate truffle, no one needed more than a bite....it was that satisfying and dense. I don't love the layout of this place, but I understand the need to cram in tables wherever they fit, especially since big groups and birthdays love this place. There are so many rooms and corridors that you can get lost going to the bathroom. While I love being seated on the recently renovated patio, I'm less of a fan of being seated I the basement.  The BEST part of Babareeba was the bill. For a table of seven that ordered two pitchers of sangria and three rounds of tapas, our Subtotal was $19 per person!!!! One of our part even had a $10 off coupon.  Its definitely worth the wait to be promised such a fun, festive, and filling evening. I just love this place!",0.9994,0.682,0.275,0.043,0.5333199786324789

Their children were running around all over us. Anyways, back to the food. We shared the following: 1. Bacon wrapped dates - ok 2. Grilled shrimp with olive oil and garlic - yummy 3. Baked goat cheese with tomato sauce - ok 4. Summer salad - yummy 5. Beef empanadas - yummmmmmmmmmmmmy 6. Spicy potatoes - ok Out of the 6 we tried, the winners to me were the beef empanada and grilled shrimp. Everything else was underwhelming and slightly mediocre. I was kind of shocked at the correlation between portion size and price. It was $5-6 for 1 medium sized empanada. Maybe I like to eat more than a bit when I share my food. Overall, it was not bad.

I have always had a good experience here.  The atmosphere is cozy and fun, never had any problems with reservations or service, and the food has always been good.  there have been things I did not like that much, but that is because I simply did not like it, not because of the way they prepared it.  And that is the real reason to go to a tapas restaurant.  To try small plates of new things you would not otherwise. I have only eaten here for dinner, so I cannot say how it is for lunch.  I typically order a couple of my favorite tapas and one or two new things I have never tried each time I go.  They now have some even smaller tasting tapas called pintxos, and if you are really hungry you can order the larger paella rice dish.  if you get the Paella, order it right away since it takes quite a while to get - and there is a minimum order of two, so if you really want to get this, make sure you are going with someone else that wants it also. I saw on a couple reviews that it was mentioned this was a ""chick place"" and not a good place to bring a date.  I do not see that at all.  I think this is a great place to bring a date or go for a special occasion.  I was even in here once for dinner during the NFL playoffs and was probably the only guy seated out of all the tables there.  But it certainly did not bother me at all.  And anyway, it seems to me that if there are a lot of women in a place that would indicate a date would probably really enjoy it.",0.9897,0.869,0.119,0.011,0.5030412348594167

Another typical spanish tapas restaurant, but unlike most of these places, they also have a great paella sampling for 2 should you opt not to get tapas.  DON'T bring a date here. This a 'chick night' restaurant. If you want intimate, this ain't your scene, and gentlemen - if you're smart, you'll send over a pitcher or two of sangria to the table of cuties you're eyeing. Cafe Ba-ba-reeba never has a shortage of chick tables.  Order the Sangria for your table, and keep it coming. Don't be the girl that refuses to drink from the pitcher. You're not that pretentious sweetheart, just fall in line. Don't worry about your diet here either. There is nothing on this menu that is remotely healthy for you. You came for the atmosphere, remember?  THE WORST - serrano ham, salchichon, chorizo & manchego. It was basically really fatty cold cuts with some olives. Not my scene.  THE BEST - beef skewer, horseradish cream & red onions ... delicious I'd recommend getting these for the table too:  grilled asparagus with manchego cheese spicy potatoes with tomato alioli  goat cheese baked in tomato sauce ahi tuna, meyer lemon, olives, capers, tomato shrimp with garlic, olive oil, red pepper flakes scallops a la plancha, jamón ibérico vinaigrette beef tenderloin & blue cheese",0.9786,0.787,0.154,0.059,0.47605042016806726

The atmosphere is really cute, very Barcelona style, however it does get a little loud for my taste, but the more of that Sangria that you drink, the less you will mind. Now onto the food, everything we had here was delicious from the calamari, both grilled and fried, the garlic shrimp, the potatoes, I mean you name it, it's good here! This place just screams, ""YOU WILL HAVE A GOOD TIME HERE NO MATTER WHAT!""

We were greeted by a friendly host staff and got lucky when a party cancelled giving us immediate seating at a 4-top table on the outside patio. Our server was friendly and welcoming. He explained all the specials carefully and was extremely knowledgeable about every menu item we asked about (and we asked about quite a few). We were having a hard time deciding which flavor of sangria to have (passion fruit vs. pear) so he brought us two small samples to try before we committed to a pitcher which we both thought was very nice of him to do. After going with the passion fruit, we ordered two plates each and received a free order of spicy potatoes because my friend was on their mailing list. The food was absolutely delicious and tasted exactly how the server described. The ingredients were fresh and were the right temperature. The plates were brought out in pairs and were spaced out which allowed us to enjoy it all without feeling rushed.  One downfall for the evening was that we ventured out to Café-Ba-Ba-Reeba to see the Flamenco show and when we arrived we were told the show was a separate reservation from the dinner. We made dinner reservations thinking the show and dinner were together. We were bummed and wished the staff would have specified that when we called to make the reservation and also on the advertisement about the event.

We got a free pixtas platter which are tiny tapas items the first time we went.  Usually my wife and I get about 6 different plates depending on the size of each. My favorite so far are the sweet potatoes which are AMAZING!!!  They usually come in a big order and are cut like fries but don't have the dryness or texture of fries. Instead they are kind of gooey and extremely delicious.  They also come with a dipping sauce that is unlike anything I have ever tasted, but still extremely good.  My other favorite there is the beef tenderloin plate.

We were running a little late so I called and they said it was no problem - very friendly staff. Interior of this place looks so cool!!! Almost felt like I was in Spain for a minute...which brings me to the food. I had amazing paella in Spain last summer, so I got it here to see how it would measure up. I was really dissapointed...kind of dry, mussels were definitely not the best I've had. Maybe my expectations were too high. Anyway, we also got a TON of tapas: Calamares a la plancha - REALLY good calamari...on a bed of arugula (I believe) with olive oil and garlic.  Beef empanada - Very tasty, nice presentation Pinxtos platter - (queso chorizo-wrapped medjool date & cheese, Aguacate ahi tuna poached in olive oil on avocado toast, goat cheese croqueta, short rib-stuffed piquillo pepper, olive cream cheese & pimento, mushroom & rice croqueta) - Where to start...everything was good! Croquetas were my fave, ahi tuna was very very tasty, and the other 3 were good, but didn't hit the spot like the rest. Datiles Con Tocino (roast dates with bacon & apple vinaigrette) - This was my FAVORITE DISH!!!! Soooooo good & tasty & wonderful...GET THIS! Bacon was cooked to crispy perfection, the date was soft, succulent, and juicy and the apple vinaigrette complimented the dish PERFECTLY. My mouth is watering just thinking about this... All 3 jarras (spreads) - (1) niçoise coquillo olive tapenade, (2) goat cheese, pistachio, mint and nispera preserves, (3) white bean purée, rosemary & chorizo  - These spreads were delicious!!!!! My favorite was #2, but all were very good. Sausage platter - I can't remember/find the official name for this, but it was basically a spanish sausage sampler...all of them were phenomenal except for 1 that tasted kind of funky and had a deep red color. Mango sangria - Reallyyyy really good. And this is coming from someone who rarely drinks alcohol. Didn't taste AS good as the sangria in Spain, but still very tasty. Loved the chunks of fruit inside! We also got the pinxtos platter (free with yelp check-in). I'm not a huge dessert person, but my friends gobbled it up so I'm assuming they liked it a lot. It included: profiterole, passion fruit sorbet, crema catalana, fruit pound cake, marcona almond tart, spanish brownie. All for free - pretty sweet deal.

First up, I made a 6:00 reservation through Yelp/ OpenTable which was incredibly easy.  It turned out we were going to be about 30 minutes late.  I called to adjust but the host told me they were full at 6:30 but she would note the reservation and we would be seated as soon as possible.  We got there shortly before 6:30 and were seated almost immediately. Our waiter was friendly and provided excellent service. The space itself is kind of odd.  It almost feels like being in a house with a lot of dining rooms.  Tables are kind of close together in some areas, but I didn't feel like I was sitting on top of the people next to me. The peach sangria was as awesome as I remembered, and the food did not disappoint either.  In fact, I think it was even better this time because I've become much more adventurous in my food selection and was willing to try things I wouldn't have touched a few years ago.  The two of us ordered the scallops, spaghetti squash, cranberry vinaigrette; the roast dates with bacon & apple vinaigrette; the spinach & manchego stuffed mushrooms; the baked goat cheese in tomato sauce; and the butternut squash & cheese toast, kale & apple salad.  We both agreed the scallops left something to be desired, but everything else was absolutely incredible.

The grilled calamari was fishy and extremely over salted, and the seared tuna was overcooked, as were the lamb skewers.

2012-05-01,4.0,"Went here for lunch one afterdnoon during my vacation to Chicago, after all that I've heard about their Spanish tapas. First thing that caught my eye on the menu was a little note stating that all charcuterie, cheese, olive oil, rice and spices are imported directly from Spain. Pretty neat! A must order here is the Sangria. They have so many flavours, and the 8 of us shared 3 pitchers: White peach, Mango, and Passion Fruit. The Passion fruit was my favourite. Refreshing, fruity, and went well with all our food. So good for the summer! Meatballs with sherry tomato sauce ($6) ---Forgettable. Nothing too special. Roasted dates with bacon & apple vinaigrette ($6) ---Where to start with this plate. Okay, lets go with the one word : SPECTACULAR. I'm not particularly attracted to dates or bacon (I know I know, I'm a weird one), but this dish was an explosion of delicious. A good flavour balance from the honey sweetened dates, savory crisp bacon, and refreshing tart apples. My friend John quotes: ""Worth giving up your first-born child for. THEY ARE THAT GOOD."" I'll let you decide how much of that statement is exaggeration and truth.   Shrimp with garlic, olive oil, red pepper flakes ($8) --- If you like garlic, you will get a real kick out of this dish. Those thin garlic slices are extremely potent, but not overdone when added to the succulent shrimp.    Spicy potato with tomato alioli ($6) ---Nothing overly special about these potatoes, but the spicy mayo does give it a little extra edge. Serrano ham, salchichon, chorizo & manchego ($9)---A great plate of curred meats. I really liked that they weren't overly salty, which is a common characteristic of charcuterie I don't particularly enjoy. Cheese lovers will love the  manchego (a spanish goat milk cheese), so creamy! Overall, a great experience!

2012-04-20,4.0,"It was a thursday night, we wanted dinner and it's been awhile since I've been to CBBR. This Lettuce Entertain You spot has never disappointed, always great food. It was 6:30pm, and to our dismay there was over an hour  wait. I was clad in my Blackhawks jersey ready for Game 4 of the playoffs, so I spotted 2 spots at the bar and was gladly relieved to hear it was first come first serve. I highly suggest this as an option if you do not have a reservation. Order a pitcher of Sangria. The traditional Red is a good option. We tried the White Peach this time and it was a little too sweet. Was more like juice than Sangria. The tapas here are affordable, but be aware that if you order Wine/Sangria, you're bill will reflect accordingly. Be Warned. If you check in on foursquare, you get a free pintxos platter. A $9 value, pretty awesome deal. 6 bite size tapas for free! The goat cheese croqueta was one of my favorites. It was oozing and delicious. The mushroom and rice croqueta was also very good. The short rib stuffed piquillo pepper was too spicy for me, skip it.  Let's face it, one reason people use Yelp is to see what to order. Here's some tips: #44 Shrimp with garlic, olive oil, red pepper flakes - Like a Spanish style shrimp scampi. Really delicious, a little kick of spiciness. Save the plate, the olive oil and garlic is delicious to sop up with your bread.  #50 Beef tenderloin & blue cheese - So damn good. I wish I could have an entire steak of this, but unfortunately it comes with 2 small medallions. Perfectly cooked, it'll make your knees buckle. Must order. It comes with potato chips (homemade?) which are good to munch on but nothing to write home about. Not ideal for big groups, however, because of the small serving size.  #53 Handmade Beef Empanada - Flaky crust with a beef filling. This was ok, but a single empanada for $6?? I've had way better empanadas from Lito's for $2.59 apiece. I went out on a limb and got this and won't be ordering this again.  #68 Roast dates with bacon & apple vinaigrette - Best bacon wrapped dates EVER. Been recreated many times, but none better than these. For $5, sweet Jesus this could be my form of crack at that price. So good.  #30 Spicy potatoes with tomato alioli - Glorified potato wedges? I had high expectations, a lot of rave reviews for these but I didn't think they were too special. Not spicy and were pretty much something I'd get from a breakfast diner. Plus, very filling.  #32 Goat cheese baked in tomato sauce - I read a previous review from Jen B. that called this dish what it really is... deconstructed pizza. Very good for sharing with friends, but this is pretty much just a cheese spread with marinara sauce. I will say though, that this would be one damn good pizza.   The food came crazy fast. Additionally, if you fill out cards to join the Lettuce Entertain You email list, you get a free tapa. We each filled out a card and the server said he'd take off 2 tapas from our bill.

We ordered a pitcher of the passion fruit sangria, and later a 1/3 pitcher of the reg classic red sangria. I really love passionfruit, the flavor was great, not too sweet---but it tasted like it had barely any alcohol in there. We ordered the pintxo platter which was pretty good. I was pleasantly surprised by the tuna. We also got the individual portion of the valencia paella. It was ok but not my favorite. There were no crispy rice bits!! I was very disappointed by the potato salad. It was gross, very mayo-y and not garlic-y enough. The grilled chicken skewer with chickpea salad was great. The beef skewer with horseradish was tasty.

2012-04-16,4.0,"I absolutely adored Cafe BaBaReeba! We ate here this past Saturday evening for our 5 year anniversary and I was extremely impressed.  We got there about half an hour before our reservation and the hostesses, in the most insincere way, greeted us and told us to have a seat in the bar. She said they would call us when they were ready. The demeanor and attitude of the hostess is the reason for the 4 star.  We had a seat in the bar and were a bit confused at how they would know who we were and when to seat us. We ordered some cocktails and hung out in their very large, yet intimate, bar.  Exactly a minute after our reservation time, they called us on a loud speaker to be seated. I was very impressed with the accuracy in timing here. Most restaurants are usually overbooked and even with reservations you can be stuck waiting more than 30 minutes sometimes.  However, we approached the hostess and told her they just called us and with a stank look and sassy attitude she just pointed to a co-worker. Manners people. Customer service is the number one rule in hospitality and the hostess is the first and last impression.  Our server was around just enough and very friendly.

2012-04-16,4.0,"Spain is arguably my favorite country to visit in the world, and some of my fondest memories are of long summer evenings spent tapas-bar-hopping, sipping on vino tinto and noshing on pinxtos of the most incredible flavors, colors, and textures. Spain also has the Mediterranean Sea and its incredibly fresh seafood to draw on...we in Chicago are not quite so fortunate. All of this is a long way of saying that I'm usually satisfied at best with American renditions of tapas. While its impossible to recreate the history, culture, and (dare I say) magic of tapas in Basque country, Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba does a more than passable translation right in the heart of Lincoln Park. I realize that this place is a bit of a scene, and while I'd normally opine more fully on the decor and service, I'm going to focus on food in this review which is the basis for the 4 stars I'm giving. Suffice it to say the service was efficient and the atmosphere lively, even on a Sunday evening. Here's what we tried: 1. Chorizo-wrapped mejdool date & cheese: With good ingredients (which these were), this one is hard to mess up. Almost sweet & rich enough to have for desert, however, so consider saving for later in the meal even though this will likely be one of the first dishes out of the kitchen. 2. short rib-stuffed piquillo pepper: an absolute knockout. Get more than 1. 3. goat cheese, pistachio, mint and nispera preserves: sounded better than it was, which basically amounted to a goat cheese spread (could barely detect the mint or pistachio) with a very sweet fruit preserve on top. Wouldn't order again. 4. salmon, celery root puree, kale chips & sea salt: not exactly your traditional tapas dish (last I checked, no salmon swimming around the Mediterranean), but delicious nevertheless. Salmon was perfectly cooked & seasoned, celery root puree was flavor & texture-wise spot on. Kale chips, though crispy and delicious, were not quite enough to add a textural contrast to the dish. Only a minor complaint, would definitely order again. 5. octopus a la plancha, fingerling potatoes & olives: this is exactly the type of dish you'd expect to see as a hot tapas item in Spain, and CBBR executed this one perfectly. 6. serrano ham, salchichon, chorizo & manchego: good but not great, and I say this mainly in comparison to the real deal (versus any other Chicago charcuterie, this dish totally stands up). Also had a pitcher of the traditional red wine sangria which was a bit sweet (read: not boozy enough) for my taste. All of this for $60 pre-tip and I felt like I had gotten away with at least a light misdemeanor. Dinner was last night and I'm ready to go back today.

2012-04-15,4.0,"This is one of my favorite tapas places in Chicago. The pitcher of their classic red sangria definitely took the dining experience to the next level.  I loved all the tapas I tried. You can't go wrong with their fried calamari and salmon dishes. Both of the salmon ""small"" dishes are so worth it. Also, the ahi tuna over a bed of capers and olives are the perfect compliment to each other.  My favorite seafood dish by far was the scallops; they were perfectly tender and juicy.  The beef skewers and beef tenderloin are both hearty dishes and when paired with the potato salad-it's like having a deconstructed steak dinner! The paella con pollo y verduras came last and I was only disappointed because I didn't have enough room in my stomach to fit it all. We are not as a big of a fan of their brunch menu, however.

Higher on the list of my fellow dinner goers were: citrus-cured salmon, cucumber, crema & toast, spiced lamb kebabs with lemon, mint & tomato, goat cheese baked in tomato sauce and paella con pollo y verduras.   It was restaurant week, so they all got desserts with their restaurant week menu.  The highest rated were the carmelized banana, and the dulce de leche.    Honestly, although I am complaining about the table next to us, we all hedged bets on the bill, which was for 21 women and one guy.   We guessed the guy in the suit picked up the check for.....$1700.  We asked our waiter.  I think he was so glad when they left he wanted to sit down with us.",0.9814,0.851,0.116,0.033,0.4894636015325671

2012-03-27,2.0,"Wow so many reviews, it must be good right. I don't think I was that impressed. Maybe it had to do with the fact that we visited Spain just last year. It was good, don't get me wrong. Just don't know if it's worth all this fuss on yelp. We walked in for a late lunch and still had to wait 20 minutes. Looking around the restaurant after we were seated, the place is really big and it looked like there were plenty of empty tables. Hopefully those were reserved because man, does it but me when we have to wait even though there's space for us. Anyways we tried their tapas - a brunch crepe with runny eggs, short rib, shrimp with garlic and olive oil, chicken and ham croquetas, citrus salad with goat cheese, potatoes bravas (spicy potatoes), and the beef empanada.  My favorite was the short rib and it came with mashed potatoes, although like 8-9 bucks for a tiny piece of melt in your mouth meat. The potatoes were just like how they make it in Spain but with a slightly less spicy sauce so I enjoyed it a bit more. I even got their passion fruit sangria - delicious but could've been stronger. We really wanted to try their paella but they didn't have it. And we came on a Sunday afternoon. If they don't have it on the weekends, when do they offer it - maybe only at dinner? And if you check in here on yelp, you get a free dessert. Even their desserts are taps-sized. Just a few bites.

The festive atmosphere was perfect for such a gathering; we weren't the only ones with the idea as there were 2 other bachelorette parties and  birthday party next to us. Great for groups and special occasions. At under $25 a pitcher the sangria is a tasty bargain. I highly recommend it as a pitcher made it around the table and everyone loved the mango flavor. I ordered a beef empenada with a perfectly buttery, crisp pastry crust; the filling was a touch spicy, but pleasantly so. I also had the cjphicken and chorizo skewer. It was juicy, well-seasoned and garnished well. The presentation of all plates was artfully done and while small in size, perfect for sharing.

There isn't an item on the menu that I've tried and didn't enjoy, except for perhaps the patatas bravas, which were a tad spicy for me but seem to be a popular item. My favorites: the citrus-cured salmon, the beef empanada, the rotating spanish artisinal cheese plate, the rioja-braised short ribs with mashed potatoes, and the goat cheese croqueta. The potato and onion omelette and the bacon-wrapped dates are pretty good, too. I hate ordering something off a menu that I've ordered before when there are appealing options I've yet to try, but I liked these items so much I think next time I go it will be a real battle of ""get that again"" vs. ""explore the menu."" I don't drink wine or sangria often but I did like both of the sangrias I tried here very much. They rotate items on and off the menu pretty frequently, which is a blessing and a curse. As excited as I am to try the goat cheese in tomato sauce dish that has appeared, there were several menu items I had enjoyed or mentally bookmarked to try later that are now gone. Bummer.

2012-03-06,5.0,"This place is A-MAZING! Had dinner here with my good friend Oscar last night, and we really went over-the-top. I let him do the ordering, and boy did he order some tasty dishes! I definitely rate it a notch better than Cafe Iberico and notches better than Emilio's, because of their variety of fusion dishes, cava sangria, and the ambiance was much nicer (better lighting too). Now, I'm no tapas connoisseur by any means, so I have no idea what constitutes as ""traditional"" tapas. However, I've gone to a few over the past few years, and I will say this has been my best experience at a tapas bar so far.  Onto the food...I can't speak for the paella because we pretty much just stuck with tapas. I will say that we ordered a LOT of food, so I'll pretty much just review on the good (still a lot!).  We began the meal with the pintxos platter. This was a great starter that comprised of:  - chorizo-wrapped medjool date & cheese  - ahi tuna poached in olive oil on avocado toast  - goat cheese croqueta  - short rib-stuffed piquillo pepper  - padrón pepper, olive cream cheese & pimento  - mushroom & rice croqueta  The chorizo skewer had a very crispy texture, slightly sweet, and the cheese ended the whole bite very creamy and yummy! The piquillo pepper was very tasty--that shredded rib was like a mini-pot-roast-good. The padron pepper with cheese was also very good, nice and creamy with a shot of heat.  Next, we ordered some seafood and meat. I must say, the grilled squid felt like it was missing something...it needed good squeeze of lemon. However, the ahi tuna with meyer lemon, olives, capers, and tomato was just AMAZING. It had a slightly crunchy exterior with a very juicy and flavorful raw interior..and I must say, I've never been much into olives and capers because they can really overpower a dish, but the combination was perfect. There was a good balance of saltiness and sweetness from the olives/capers and tomato and nothing too overpowering.  The beef tenderloin and blue cheese had that same balance of texture as the ahi tuna, but the blue cheese added yet another nice creamy and salty component to the beef. Finally, we had empanadas, a beef and chicken. Both empanadas were cooked in a very puff-pastry-like dough that was very flaky and reminded me of a dessert. It was actually a very good end to the meal because of that dessert-like pastry. Most empanadas I've eaten are usually wrapped in kind of a pie-dough, which makes the exterior not much to bite into. However, this empanada was flaky and the shredded beef had that similar pot-roast taste that really brought the empanada so much flavor. Now, the chicken empanada had the same puff-pastry exterior, but the chicken wasn't as tasty as the beef. I guess I can say it was good, but it didn't *wow* me. Finally, I *must* talk about their cava sangria. It was my first time trying a cava sangria, and I was first wary to try it because my friend compared it to a bubbly champagne (I do NOT like champagne). However, it was far from champagne--a good thing. In fact, it had a fresh, crisp taste, and I didn't taste the alcohol unlike a red sangria I've had at other tapas restaurants. There were also apples in the sangria, which I found very refreshing. We ordered a pitcher of the cava sangria, and it didn't disappoint (though, after three glasses, it definitely hit the spot!).  The ambiance is great for a nice date, girl's-night-out, and just a great meal with good company. Definitely a classy place, but without all of the pretension. The music wasn't too loud, but definitely on the loungy-side. The lighting was dimmed down, but there was enough lighting to enjoy and showcase the food (I really don't care for very dark restaurants..makes me feel like I'm in a dungeon). The service was also good, our waiter was attentive but not overpowering. I'm most definitely coming back, probably with my family and friends.

Meaning, I don't have fun at hibachi Benihana-esque places ain't my cuppa tea. This thing was just swinging in front of my face blocking the view of my friends in front of me. As front it's presentation, it was alright. Spices and flavors melded well. Nothing was bland or too powerful. Service was good. It took a while to bring our second order of patatas bravas. When the waitress finally came with it she acknowledged and apologized for waiting and ended up taking it off our check. They definitely took care of us.  Great and a lively place for groups. Reservations are much needed. There are more things on the menu I really want to dig into. Paella's next on my list....",0.9949,0.749,0.215,0.036,0.5259615384615384

Aside from having to completely unlearn how to order off a menu, the transition into eating tapas was explained quickly by our server. If I were to make two recommendations that you will actually remember (in English) by the time you get there - get anything with goat cheese, and any of the potato dishes. This is only the second tapas restaurant I have been to, and the quality of food here far outweighs the first. My only complaint is the wait time on most of the dishes. Atmosphere: The store front is deceptively small. Once inside, you'll be surprised by the large tables, and the depth of the dining area (just try finding the restrooms). If you are looking for an intimate experience, ask that your recommendations are on the right/restaurant side, and not the indoor patio area.   Trying tapas dishes builds a unique sense of comradeship, and I would easily recommend this restaurant for any situation in which you fear uncomfortable silence: first date, family get-together, or in my case - the first sit-down between the significant other and parentals.

2012-02-25,3.0,"Café babareeba is genius disguised as a tapas restaurant for some.  First their location, in the heart of Lincoln Park is a perfect zip code for such an ambitious venture. The building itself is even better with its turn of the century style The neon light sign that says ""Tapas"" acts as a for what's to come, sort of like a book's cover that says ""book.""  Done to look like it was imported from Spain its ideally decorated for a restaurant that offers so many options on cheese. As you walk in two people taking reservations double as a tour guide.  I say that because the restaurant does intimacy like engineers at Cadillac specialize in fuel economy.  After they escorted me through the maze of rooms which gave me a full view of the restaurant which was fully occupuied by high income mostly Caucasian locals who probably see no difference between Spanish people and the Mexican's that serve them.  On this night I sat behind a well behaved baby who like everyone else had to listen to the man eating with his or her's parents.  Once you get the other noises out of your system and read through a pretty extensive menu it's easy to get yourself fired up for some Spanish grub.  Its kind of a waste of energy though.  The food itself is nothing special although the presentation tries to be.  Apparently the style of tapas that were given to us hailed from the region of Spain where they served food on blocks of wood cut like a cribbage board with wax paper on top of it.  The prices taken on a per tapa basis seem reasonable until you get the bill at the end of the night which makes you see the capitalist spin on such a socialist culinary tradition.  The sangria was good and was the most authentic of anything I consumed that night but that's coming from someone who would find something good to say about anything with alcohol in it.   In summary,  Café Babareeba is perfect for anyone looking for a faux tapas experience in an atmosphere that makes you feel like the other 300 people you have just discovered the next best",0.9828,0.849,0.119,0.032,0.47530075187969933

He always arrived in time for our next order or question. He knew the menu well and gave us several good suggestions and was friendly without being overly familiar. He really helped make the dinner feel like a celebration.  All the food was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and arrived at our table right on time.

They have a good selection of Sangria, by the glass as well as full or half pitcher, the classic white was excellent and my wife loved the Black Raspberry version.

Thus, I was on a ""mission"" to get sample size pieces of ""tortilla española"" for about 100 students.  We take our 8th grade students to Café Ba Ba Reeba for a luncheon and I personally adore their food so I called Café Ba Ba Reeba for help. I spoke to co-owner, Michael, and a catering associate, Allison, and they were professional, helpful and equally as excited about our students tasting tapas. They arranged to have the pieces cut, tooth picked, and packaged in containers so I could fit them over night in my fridge. They included the ""special sauce"" on the side and a tray to serve them on. Allison made sure that I refrigerated the tapas, but explained that they are served room temperature.

Get 2xperson.  - Beef tenerloin & blue cheese. - amazing steak. Litte too salty in imo but that's i think cause of blue cheese. - Shrimp with garlic & oilve oil and red flakes. - good tapa.  - Crab and shrimp dip - good snack but not awesome.  -Roasted dates with bacon in apple vinaigrette - Awesome snack.  - Spicy potatoes with tomato alioli - Lots of ppl love this dish.

2012-01-23,2.0,"I discovered a new species of bird over the weekend- it's called the Plate Vulture. It's unique only to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba and they become more aggressive at night. That was our group's joke of the night. We went early on Saturday and got a table at the bar. This place is packed and it is so overwhelming. Another classy touch is the 'announcements' that come throughout the night. The loudspeaker will call out one of the many people waiting around for a table. It's like going to The Rainforest Cafe 'Tarantula, party of 4'. It is LOUD in there. Why are people waiting for this place for so long?! Our food was fine. Between the 3 of us, we ordered a lot of food and we ate it all: seafood, steaks, cheeses, etc. I will say that I didn't feel the dishes were very Spanish inspired, but I would say few plates on the menu met that criteria. The sangria was weak. Our waitress told us that the black raspberry sangria was the most popular. Ok, so I ordered one. All I could taste was the black raspberry liquor. I don't think there was alcohol in it. I did not order another drink. The drink menu in itself was pretty weak. The Plate Vultures circled all night. Essentially, if there was an empty plate on the table they would swoop in and pick it up. Which is fine if the plate is empty, but there were a few occasions where we had to stop them from taking food we were still eating away. Do these guys get paid by the plate?! It was annoying. Also, when we were paying the bill, I was holding it up and discussing how to split it with my friends. One of the Plate Vultures came by and tried to reach past me (I was sitting by the wall). I told him I wasn't done with the bill as he tried to reach he hand between my face and the bill. Turns out he wasn't trying to take the bill, he was trying to reach the plate on the far side of the table. Really?! Could you not wait a few minutes until it is actually clear for you to pick it up? Did you need to shove your arm across my face? Did you really have to interrupt our conversation with my friends? Very unprofessional.

2012-01-13,3.0,"BA-BA-REEBA. Am I the only one who thinks of the YOBAGOYA episode of The League when they come here? Yes? Ok, cool. Glad that's out of the way.  So tapas bars. Or as I like to call them, ""Appetizers-R-Us."" Generally, you're going to get the same experience at every one. You order the cheesy tomato sauce and pretend it's super fancy instead of deconstructed pizza. You order the something-cheese and potato croquettes and pretend it's not essentially fried cheese and french fries. And then you get a pitcher of sangria and pretend it's not the wine coolers you downed freshman year of college before walking around campus trying to find a frat party or morally bankrupt club bouncer.  Hey, I like to pretend, too! It's way more fun than being a grown up. So in pretendland, tapas are a magic, mysterious food that makes you feel worldly.  In reality, and especially for a vegetarian, tapas are just okay. They are excellent for sharing and make for a good argument in favor of splitting the check evenly. But I get a little sick from the carbs and cheese and grease and sugary sangria, so generally I reserve tapas experiences for when others insist on going there for birthdays or other big group outings. And in that limited realm where I'm likely going to have a good time anyway, I'm happy to do tapas.  At least Ba-Ba-Reeba has a nice interior, assuming you like dead animal parts hanging above you at the bar and inconsistent floor levels begging you to trip. Our server was completely slammed yet managed to bring us our food right away. A little too right away, actually, as our small table was soon crammed with everything we order, almost all at once.  So I guess I'm not totally blown away by B-B-R, but no less so than any other tapas bar I've been to. Adjusting for my own admittedly weird preferences, this place gets a three. If you like tapas, you'll probably like it. If not, call me and we'll order pizza and watch The League reruns.",0.9583,0.83,0.115,0.055,0.5681339977851605

2012-01-08,1.0,"Run and don't look back! My fiance and I went here this weekend because we had a giftcard - we would have been better off tossing the gift card and eating mac n' cheese at home on Saturday night.  First off, their ""fantastic"" sangria was actually crap-tastic. It tasted like vinegar littered with massive chunks of fruit that a toddler in the back cut up with his play-doh knife.   Their tapas style menu was a de-glorified American version of it - portions are definitely not what you would consider ""classic"" Spanish tapas portions. Their patatas bravas which is your basic tapas dish was cut up like American french fries and I could barely taste the so-called ""spicy"" aioli sauce. Salmon was way overcooked as was our beef tenderloin smeared with an overpowering curdled blue cheese. Sick! The cheese plate was absolutely nothing to write home about. When you order a cheese platter, you're perhaps preparing yourself to be wow-ed by a new cheese that you've never had. They gave us some crappy goat's milk cheese with olives dancing about in it. They might as well have just given us a dish of olive tapenade to spoon into our mouths, because you couldn't taste any of the cheese.  Now the waitstaff - the busboys seemed great and attentive to our ever-trashed pile of dishes. However, the queen that was serving us had a 'tude from the get-go and was not attentive at all - this was in fact, the only true-to-life portion of our experience (in Spain, they also will leave you at the table for an extended amount of time if you don't order something immediately). When we were served dishes with multiple items on it, we had to hunt our waiter down so that he could tell us what everything was (which he seemed annoyed about). Typically, in a restaurant, the waitstaff will outline what each item is (on a multi-platter) for you so that you know what you're eating. Dear Queen Waiter, Sorry for bothering you by asking you to do your job. We were actually going to order dessert, but because it literally took him 10 minutes (after we told him we were ready!), we decided we'd be better off without.  Our meal was $80 not including tip which is absurd for the lack of service, amount of attitude, and the bountiful amount of crap food. Would have been much happier paying that much at a real restaurant i.e. Girl and the Goat, Gilt Bar, just to name a few.",0.8371,0.897,0.057,0.046,0.4354327000160334

So we thought we'd give it a try.  I am a HUGE small plates person so you can imagine my delight when I saw that their brunch menu had both normal sized portions and also small plates portions.  Like a teeny tiny stack of pancakes or that mini french toast.  Or if you so choose, a normal sized omlette.  Oh, and the bloody mary bar- oh, I do adore a good bloody mary! And it's so fun to create your own- only I generally have no idea what I'm doing when left to my own devices.

Our favorite dishes (just about everything we ordered) included the shrimp with garlic (#1), spicy potatoes, bacon wrapped dates, beef tenderloin with blue cheese and goat cheese with marinara. We also had the chicken empanada which was pretty good, the sauce on the side was great.

Food: we had the full pintxos platter for free, just send a text to some number on their site to get it texted back.  That's a $10 value of some tasty bites.  The quince and cheese was a favorite.   We ordered the following dishes: Warm potato and onion omelette: tasty, although you can tell it was just cut out of one pre-made earlier. Fried green peppers and coarse salt: very tasty!  My favorite of the night, actually.  A hefty portion of peppers of varying heat, made crunchy and salted perfectly. Octopus a la plancha, with potatoes and olives: to die for.  Octopus was just right and not chewy at all.  Everything cooked to perfection and seasoned so tasty.  I was surprised at the size of the serving, much larger than it would be at say Bull-eh-dia's.

It's my favorite way to eat because you get to try tons of different menu items instead of just one, and the meal turns out to be a couple of hours long because it all comes out staggered and what's more fun than a couple of sangria-filled hours? My friend Teddy told me I HAD to try Ba-Ba-Reeba because they have the best tapas around, and I was a little skeptical because St. Louis has some incredible tapas spots and I wasn't sure it would measure up. Good news is that it did! I still like my regular tapas spots better, but we had a total blast and got to enjoy some really great food. This place gets really busy on a Saturday night so make reservations if you can. Per usual with tapas places, it's incredible loud and busy, which is all part of the experience... First up was sangria and we had a 1/2 pitcher of the passion fruit, and a 1/2 pitcher of the pear which was their special that night. Passion fruit OMG yes, pear just so-so.

At this point with 1031 reviews I'm not so sure it's necessary, but I'm going to go for it anyway. Pintxos platter (FREE when you check in on Yelp! Holla!): Came out RIGHT away and some of it was a little cold... it's worth trying for $9 though because you get five different things. Cool. Patatas bravas: One of our favorites that night. That aioli is amazing, especially on top of perfectly seasoned potatoes. Goat cheese in tomato sauce: Pretty standard but not the best I've had (I get this dish at every tapas joint and I like it spicy.) Champiñones rellenos (spinach & manchego-stuffed mushrooms): SO good. Really great. Must-try if you're a mushroom lover but even if not, the creamy sauce it's in and the filling might sell you. Croquetas de pollo y jamón (chicken & ham croquetas): Melt in your mouth quality, and they're served with a sauce similar to tartar sauce that's pretty perfect. Bacon-wrapped dates: Pretty standard, still delicious. All of the above made for a REALLY fun night and I love that our waiter was dressed as Fred Flinstone but with fake boobs and a fake butt (?).

2011-10-25,4.0,"First off, I am giving 4 stars because I think Cafe BaBaReeba, though delicious, was a bit too commercialized - very trendy, items on menu were listed as English description before Spanish name, too many fancy Sangrias. I also want to say that I am a big fan of Cafe Iberico (which I also gave 4 stars). Having been to both places now, my boyfriend and I said last night that the tapas at BaBa were better, but like the Paella and Sangria at Iberico more. However, I looked at the Iberico menu before writing this review and noticed they have many of the same items (which I haven't had yet) we ordered at BaBa last night. SO I will be going back to Iberico and ordering them so I can decide which place I like better. Now for my review: I have heard many good things about Cafe BaBaReeba, but just went for the first time last night. I was there for my friend's birthday with about 7 other people. We had a reservation, so were seated right away, It wasn't very busy (but I assume that's because it was a Monday evening). A few of the girls with us had been there many times before and already knew what to order, so the rest of us took a quick look at the menu and nothing else seemed to jump out at us so we just went with what ever they got.  We started with two pitchers of the WHITE PEACH SANGRIA. It was okay, but I personally would have ordered the Black Raspberry. We started off with 2 SPICY POTATOES W/ TOMATO ALIOLI, 1 GOAT CHEESE BAKED IN TOMATO SAUCE, ENDIVE SALAD, and FRIED CALAMARI. The spicy potatoes were delicious! I had never had goat cheese before, (and it tasted a bit strange at first) but it was very good. I did not try the endive salad or calamari, however, a few people commented the calamari was a bit more chewy than usual and my boyfriend said the salad was good. My boyfriend and I also ordered the PAELLA VALENCIANA for 2 (since no one else wanted it). They split it into two plates for us...I think it could have served 4, but my boyfriend ate his entire portion...I did not. We also agreed that we liked the Paella at Cafe Iberico better. Next we ordered 2 BEEF TENDERLOIN & BLUE CHEESE, 2 BEEF SKEWER W/ HORSERADISH AND RED ONIONS, 2 BRAISED SHORT RIB W/ MASHED POTATOES, and OCTOPUS. The beef tenderloin was fantastic...very juicy and medium rare (just how I like my beef). I did not particularly care for the beef skewer, it tasted a bit charred and was not very juicy. The braised short rib was so tender and yummy...and the mashed potatoes weren't bad either. I didn't try the octopus (not a big seafood person). They brought my friend a serving of the chocolate cake (which was small, because it's a tapa!) for her birthday and we sang to her. We all had a bite and it was pretty good.  We definitely had enough food for the 8 of us and I didn't feel too full. The bill ended up being only $30/person since we only split it 7 ways (not too shabby).

I started out with a free Pintxos platter (Yelp check-in offer), which had 6 little items. Loved the short rib stuffed pepper & chorizo-wrapped date.

I was with a group of 5 so I really don't even remember what we ordered. Definitely way too many tapas and a 2 serving order of the chicken paella (REALLY frickin' good) and a pitcher of sangria. Our server was pretty awesome too, and I loved how we could order a couple tapas at a time so to not get food overload by getting them all at once. The sangria was top notch too - I won the ""who can refill her glass the most"" contest. Hehe. Tapas are generally on the pricey side, but all said and done we split the bill evenly and I didn't feel ripped off at all! Unfortunately, I was only visiting Chicago so I can't really go back regularly, but I definitely recommend this place!  (By the way, it's HUGE inside! Decor is pretty sweet too. Just go.

Over the past 3 years though I would say the food quality, service and overall experience has drastically dwindled. To start, the last few times I've been the food has been sub-par at best. It's often been cold or arrived too quickly from the next. Not very good timing and not very yummy anymore. Next, the sangria, although it tastes good, is juice. Do not think there is any alcohol in any of the sangria's - trust me, I've had them all. The service is horrible nowadays. When you have a reservation, you still have to wait 20 - 45 mins. Ridiculous! What is the point of having a reservation? Not to mention, even if you call to alter your reservation days before they will not do it. I asked to add an extra person to an 8 o clock rez and they told me no, the next available time would be 9:30 - it was only for a table of 4 (seems simple to add a person from 3 to 4).

I've had their regular red and whites in addition to peach and mango. Mango was GREAT- although it might only be offered occasionally as a special.  Their menu is really great and the usual dishes I get are a mix of the following: Pintxos platter (several bite sized tapas, totally shareable with a group) Spicy Potato with Tomato alioli...Crisp, warm potatoes with a tad bit spicy tomato alioli... simple but absolutely delish  Serrano ham and tomato bread  Fried calamari, tomato crudo, jalapeno alioli  Seared scallop with spinach, raisins, and pine nuts  Roast dates with bacon and apple vinaigrette (absolute fav!)

The Meh -tomato gazpacho (full disclosure: I'm not a fan of cold soup, so this was flavorful, but not great) -spiced lamb kebobs (kind of tough and not super flavorful, I could have done without this) -serrano ham, chorizo & manchego (it's served charcuterie-style, it was just ok) -shrimp and scallop paella (I don't know, I'm just not a fan of paella, it just tastes like soggy rice to me.  Yes, you get a big portion, but I think $13/pp is just too expensive) Overall I'm glad I tried it, but don't think I need to come back anytime soon.",0.9869,0.783,0.163,0.054,0.5588955026455027

Because of my frequent visits I've tried a good many items on the menu.  All have been spectacular, with the exception of the fried green peppers with coarse salt.  They are literally JUST fried medium hot peppers and pretty boring.  My favorites include the goat cheese croqueta (delicious, delicious molten goat cheese with some candied orange or confit orange on top), the rioja braised short ribs (so irresistibly tender), the escargot toasts, and of course, the bacon wrapped dates.  The portions also seem reasonable for the price and I generally walk away full. Also fantastic are the sangrias.  I think by this point I've tried every one on the menu including many of the specials.  (I just had the pear which was crisp, refreshing, and sweet.)  They are delicious and the pack a good punch, while not being overly boozy or strong. My only complaint is the inconsistent service.  It's generally good in the restaurant, but if you eat at the bar to avoid the wait be warned.  The bartenders are a little forgetful and sometimes orders mysteriously don't get put in.  I've also had a bartender leave at the end of the shift without really transitioning us over to anyone else or letting us know he was going to be gone.  I don't expect as good a service experience at the bar, but I DO expect my orders to be remembered and somewhat timely service. A couple of tips: -This place always seems to have a wait even on a Monday night so I'd highly recommend reservations.  It also means that I wouldn't recommend meeting here for a drink at the bar (i.e. on a date) around dinner time because it's packed with people waiting for tables on any night and pretty loud. -If you're looking for a deal, they do offer happy hour specials ($1 and $3 dishes) at the bar with less expensive deals on some of their most popular dishes.  However, the portion sizes are also small to match so if you're eating a lot, I'm not sure how much of a deal they really are.  A few of my faves are also not on this menu so I end up ordering from the regular menu.",0.9966,0.801,0.161,0.039,0.593742035742036

Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba is all of the above, maybe even more than ""pretty satisfying"".   I had made a reservation for the only feasible time on Saturday, 9:00 pm.  A little late for one used to waking up at 5 am and sleeping at 9:30, but I thought I'd chance it.  We arrived a few minutes late and were told it would be a few minutes which was fine.  Even by 9 the place was swarming with Lincoln Parkians and their parents, visiting from out of town - raucous bachlelorette parties decked out in penis swag - couples on intimate dates eschewing romantic whisperings for loud conversation just to hear each other. We were seated and ordered quickly as we had already browsed the menu at home.  The plates came fast and furious.  Waiters seemed to be flying by tables on zip lines, dropping off plates barely fitting in descriptions of the food.  Our waiter came frequently enough, though a bit less often as the meal wore on.   The food was delicious.  I have this block in my head that I can never be full from (non-all-you-can-eat) sushi and tapas, but was proved wrong, as I usually am.  Between my friend and I, we had 7 plates and were plenty stuffed by the end.  Everything was cooked really well, our favorite being the incredibly simple yet delightful potatoes with aioli.  Some of the other dishes were a little more on the good, but not super-great side including the shrimp doused in garlicky butter and seared sausage (one of which tasted like a slim-jim) As the crowd thinned out and the sangria started to run dry, I realized that even though I could now hear the words my friend was saying, it wasn't quite as fun.  Something about being jostled just a little, being thisclose to our neighbors and a near-catastrophic run in with a sprinting waiter added to the atmosphere.

Our table got:  30. spicy potatoes with tomato alioli 45. fried calamari, tomato crudo, jalapeno alioli 53. handmade beef empanada 55. grilled prime sirloin & market vegetables 66. grilled chicken skewer & chorizo sausage 68. roast dates with bacon & apple vinagrette. The standouts were 30, 53, and 68. The spicy potatoes are perfection, especially with the sauce. The empanada's crust was really fluffy. The roast dates were the nice surprise of the night. The fried calamari wasn't very good. I like my calamari to be very crispy, and this one was disappointingly soggy. The sirloin was also nothing special.  Overall, this place was really great. The atmosphere was really nice and festive. It was great to sit with my girlfriends, eating tapas and drinking sangrias. I would definitely go back!",0.994,0.764,0.209,0.027,0.6158531746031747

Been here two times now, and both times first-rate tapas. And some really lovely sangrias. The bacon wrapped dates taste almost like breakfast (sweet, salty and so nice); also they had hot cheese things that were breaded and oozy good. The fried calamari was nice and grease-less.  And the potatoes bravas are slammin'.  But the shrimp in garlic and olive oil is my favorite. I wanted to fill up a bathtub and set it in front of the TV so I could eat and watch Law and Order! The sangrias are a bit deceptive.  I downed one blackberry sangria, thinking it had no alcohol in it. Halfway through the second one I realized the error of my ways. I had to take a minute and drink lots of water.  Servers are nice albeit a bit slow. We were told that something was on its way and it took another 10 minutes. Um, that's not really ""on its way"" mister. Finally, nice vibe in the restaurant, but that is one loud space.

I didn't have it, but my girlfriends loved their mango sangria. I liked that it was true to the Spanish style in the sense that the food came out when it was ready, not all at once.  My only complaint is that the tables are so close that it gets loud really easily and it's a little bit difficult to get up and go to the restroom or leave.

As a person who understands the nature of food allergies and food related diseases fairly well, I know that there is a lot of risk in ordering from a restaurant, even if they do claim to have a gluten free menu, however, I wish that restaurants would take more care with food that is being served to people specifically ordering off of any special menu, because my poor friend was sick before we even got home.

Yes, I understand that's a personal problem and I am working on it. Started with the Passion Fruit sangria, which was fresh and not to sweet.  Then ordered the spicy potatoes, which was like crispy-on-the-outside / hot-and-soft-on-the-inside french fries with a banging dipping sauce.  The sirloin steak had a nice sauce but was too chewey at the served-medium temp. Scallops were spot on. Loved the pine nuts and raisins as a garnish. The meatballs were just okay (even though they were highlighted as a ""favorite""). The goat cheese dip was delicious, but tasted like any other LEYE version of goat cheese dip. I'm okay with that.

2011-08-15,5.0,"Took my fiance and our friends here for his birthday. It lived up to the hype. Friendly server, fantastic food and delish sangria.  I definitely recommend reservations for large groups at least a month in advance. We had a group of 8 and they put us in a large table in the back of the restaurant to the left. I asked about patio seating, but they can't put groups larger than 6 there due to fire laws. We had just about everything on the menu! Started out with a 1/2 pitcher of their classic red sangria, and munched on their bread olive oil  & black pepper while we waited. The bread they gave us to start with was really hard, but we were hungry and it didn't matter that much. When the rest of our group joined us we were given fresh, soft, chewy bread which was nice!  Food standouts:  The Spinach and Machego Stuffed Mushrooms- We kept ordering more, because 4 wasn't enough! We would've eaten these little guys by the bucket! Goat Cheese baked in Tomato Sauce - Comes with garlic bread slices, a good starter. Spicy Potato with Tomato Alioli - Very satisfying and they give you a decent portion for a tapas sized plate. We all couldn't get enough of the Handmade Beef Empanadas, ordered several to nosh on. The caramelized red onions that came with the Beef Skewer were divine. I could've eaten them all alone. The shrimp with garlic, olive oil, red pepper flakes came with nice, big, plump shrimp, but the real standout was the EVO, shallot, garlic and red pepper mix it came in. WOW. I ordered more bread and dipped it in this. The waiters are great, and try to keep the tables cleared, but I kept fending them off to keep this oily treasure near me.  Nice touch: We gave the cake and candles to the waitress ahead of time, to surprise my honey. She brought them out lit and we all got to sing to the birthday boy who was pleasantly surprised.

2011-08-14,3.0,"Overview: good atmosphere, decent food, sangria is way too sweet, prices are what I would consider slightly high but that is likely just a reflection of the neighborhood. Pass on the paella. Details  I am very new to the Chicago area and tried this out Friday night with my SO. All in all, it's a decent little spot. Love the patio (where we sat) and the interior seemed nice as well.  We had the pinxtos platter, which is six "" one bite"" tapas that are supposedly traditional in northern Spain. These were all very good and we were able to get two bites out of each :)  We weren't terribly hungry when we decided to stop in, so we decided to split a small serving of seafood paella as our main. Small is right. We asked the waiter if it would be enough for two along with the pinxtos and he assured us it would be, and that the larger portion is a ton of food for two people. While at may be true, the small portion is not enough for two ( we hadn't mentioned to him that we weren't hungry). Now, that said, I am not one of these people who expect TGI Fridays size platters of food. Quite the opposite. But honestly, this would have been barely enough for one person if there'd hadn't been the tapas first and some bread on the table if the person was hungry for dinner. Portion  size aside, the paella was only ok. I'd say it was a bit greasy and definitely didn't have a lot of seafood in it. Also could be considered a bit bland, mostly a strong tomato flavor with garlic in the background, though it did come with some sort of basil aioli that I didn't care for and have never seen served with a paella; perhaps this helped the flavor? But again, added grease. Finally, the sangria. Not a bad price on the half and full pitchers if it was worth drinking. Which it is not. Perhaps I'm spoiled, but to me sangria should still taste like wine. Yes, you should have a bit of sweetness and be able to taste the fruit clearly, but it shouldn't taste like koop aid that someone dumped some red wine in to. I hear their margaritas and cocktails are much better. Conclusion: probably won't be going back of my own choosing, but wouldn't refuse to go if someone really wanted to eat there.",0.996,0.804,0.164,0.032,0.5706657046657048

2011-07-17,3.0,"I'm not a big fan of the tapas concept in general - it has always just seemed to me like a convenient excuse to serve small portions - but if there was a place to change my mind about that, Ba-Ba-Reeba seems to be the place.  The food, service, and atmosphere was all pretty good. The shrimp and scallop paella was excellent, my favorite of the 5-6 dishes of my visit.   I had some sangria, which was pretty good, but almost seemed a little watered down.  I had the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce, and the orange and beet salad.  Both were good enough, I suppose, but nothing that would make me crave them again.  I also had the beef tenderloin and blue cheese.  Despite being assured that the blue cheese was a delicious addition to the beef, it was almost offensive to me to ruin a nice piece of meat with an overflowing hunk of melted cheese.  The meal had a nice ending, though, because of the fantastic bacon-wrapped dates.  I'm still unsure what a date is, but I know that this dish was quite good.  I don't know why the dates were soaked in vinaigrette - not a fan - but it was delicious nonetheless. Despite my delight in the paella and the dates - if I come back, I'll be getting both again - Ba-Ba-Reeba didn't really change my mind regarding tapas places.  To fill yourself up, you need to order several items.  The variety is nice, friendly to the taste buds, but less friendly to the wallet.  I can definitely see the appeal of this place; some of the food was quite good.  However, it's hard for me to look past the price for these small dishes, which ultimately prevents me from giving a better review.",0.9978,0.684,0.265,0.05,0.5527006172839506

I wanted to order something my father hasn't had before so I ordered the bacon wrapped dates. They were amazing. My dad said it tasted like heaven and his date couldn't get enough of them.  Another amazing thing on the menu was the spare ribs. They were so tender and the sauce and potatoes were a perfect addition to it. The last thing that stood out from the visit was the braised lamb dish. Again, the meat was very tender, the sauce was amazing, maybe a little too sweet for me, and the pine nuts and cous cous were amazing additions to the dish. Even though it was father's day, the dishes came quickly. Another bonus point was that the server was all too happy to tell us how to make the bacon wrapped dates at home.  I can't wait to come back here and try their paella that my father was raving about, we couldn't because we had half of the lunch menu and their breakfast menu.

Walking past it a few times, it always is super packed so when I actually got the opportunity to go try it (with Firebelly Design + their campers ) I was supremely excited. And what's more... I wasn't let down. I recommend making reservations btdubs.  The atmosphere of Cafe Ba-ba-reeba is insanely energetic. People are buzzing, it's crowded but not uncomfortably crowded. I had a handful of dishes because we were all sharing. This is what I recommend: - roasted eggplant salad + goat cheese - lamb kabob (they kind of oversalted it the 2nd time around, but still good) - goat cheese in tomato sauce + garlic bread - serrano ham + tomato bread (YUM)  - chicken and ham croquetas (creamy, rich, crunchy and delish!) - patatas bravas  - stuffed mushrooms - seared scallops w/ spinach - shrimp w/ garlic. olive oil red pepper flakes OMG SO GOOD- hit the spot. Basically, I enjoyed most of it. They do have their own olives that they marinate in house which was extremely tasty, so I suggest that to snack if you are an olive lover! I am sure I will be back - writing this review makes my mouth water.  Service was pretty mediocre.  They were probably rushing around a lot because they're so busy.

2011-06-21,5.0,"A few summers ago I was driving with one of my friends back then when we got a flat tire in Lincoln Park, in front of this Spanish restaurant. I had never changed a tire, so I was useless, my friend worked on changing it and a few passerbys helped. Fast forward a few years to last night. I'm in the car with my best friend. We had made rum and Cokes with 7-11 slurpees, stopped at my piercer's shop to chat, had attempted to go to Peace Fest, and decided we should eat something. I'm particularly good at finding the best places to eat, and I usually refer to my Yelp app as a point of reference as far as what's near and what's good per the reviews. We're driving, I'm getting overwhelmed with what's near us at the moment (Lincoln Park area) and what's near our destination (Wrigleyville area), when Café Ba Ba Reeba pops up. I had read up on it, bookmarked it, and was determined to go one day. Over 900 reviews and I wanted Spanish, so off we went. I had lived in Spain for six months, so I was so excited to see all the décor, complete with jamón hanging from the ceiling and FC Barcelona (Booo) scarves above the bar. We opted to sit outside. The patio was decorated with pretty lights and they even had traditional Spanish street signs on the wall (Calle de las lechugas AHAHA) Upon the standard checking-in to Facebook, Foursquare and Yelp, deals popped up. At the time, checking in on Facebook got you a free order of baked goat cheese, checking in on Yelp got a free pintxo platter. Such a good deal! We first wanted the baked goat cheese but then saw the pintxo platter and went for that. I was originally going to get only that, but I ordered the special Green City Market paella while my friend ordered a garlicky shrimp tapas. We rounded it out with a pitcher of white peach sangria. I will say I was little put off by the waiter. He asked me if I had ever heard of pintxos, tapas and paella, I said yes, I lived in Spain for a while...and he still proceeded to explain what they were. Bro, I told you I lived there. I KNOW WHAT THEY ALL ARE. Anyway, so I lived in southern Spain, went to Barcelona once, but never got to try the pintxos, so I was excited to try them here. Separately, they are $1.50 and during certain times, they are only $1...all together they are $8.95. On the platter: Chorizo wrapped medjool date & manchego; ahi tuna poached in olive oil on avocado toast; goat cheese croquetta; short rib-stuffed piquillo pepper; artisanal Spanish cheese & quince; mushroom & rice croquetta My favorites were the chorizo-wrapped date, the artisanal cheese and the mushroom and rice croquette. My paella was depressingly tiny in comparison to the huge pans I had in Spain, but I wasn't too hungry so I guess it was okay. I also think the chef ran out of vegetables because I saw carrots in it when there weren't supposed to be...and it was missing green onions. My friend's shrimp was good, although she was disappointed in the portion size and lack of spiciness - hey, that's Spanish tapas and food in general. My friend and I took an embarrassingly long time to finish our pitcher and the staff was nice enough to wait for us. A great place! I'll be sure to join the text club and don't be surprised if I show up there a few more times.",0.9948,0.833,0.13,0.037,0.43453682019255796

Tapas are one of my favorite dishes to eat, especially with groups of 4 or more, and with a pitcher of sangria to wash them all down with.  This place is deceptively large but still has a very small Spanish bar vibe to it which I like.  I've only been twice and my waiter the second time around was less than ideal but that didn't stop everyone from having a great time.  He was especially slow on drinks and with a group of 12 it was a little problematic. We ended up ordering two pitchers of sangria (which was amazing!!!) and immediately ordered another two when they arrived knowing by the time we'd finished our first ones the next round would be on the table soon after.

2011-04-25,4.0,"I would actually give Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba 3.5 stars if I could, but I'm feeling generous this evening, so I'll bump it up to 4. What I liked...they take reservations, which is bomb because we came here for a birthday occasion and were seated straight away. I did enjoy their sangria. Granted, I still think I make the world's best sangria, but I was liking what we ordered. We started with their sangria of the day, which was a mango sangria, with white wine. Then we opted for the more traditional red wine sangria. If I had to choose between the two, I would say the mango sangria was more my style, but I've never been a red wine kind a gal, so maybe this is why. What I did NOT like: while this is a tapas restaurant, I felt the small plates weren't easily shareable. For example, we ordered the garlic scallops and, while delicious, we had to cut each scallop in half to have enough to go around. Also, the chicken empanada (which I did not eat), was literally one medium sized empanada which you also had to cut into sections in order to share. The pixto platter was annoying as well because everything was bite sized! So, if you happened to want that goat cheese croquetta (as I did), but some other member of your party who could not take a hint, also want that croquetta, we basically had to cut it in two. It was wholly aggravating but whatever. I got over and enjoyed my meal anyway. Two of my favorite dishes were the octopus and potato, and the paella. Unfortunately, there was very little octopus and a whole helluva lot of potato. Kind of a rip off, as I would have like to see more octopus. The same dish at Iberico is much more satisfying than here, but I still enjoyed it. I also (surprisingly) loved the seafood paella. Now, I lived in Spain for a year and have had my share of authentic, unbeatable paellas, and of course Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba isn't quite there yet, but it was damn good. Nice and creamy with a good dose of seafood peppered throughout the dish, this is a must order. Our waiter was on top of his game and the service was constant, with different waiters here and there bringing out our various dishes. We were never left without something from which to pick at and share. Conclusion: liked it, and sure I'll be back.",0.9974,0.73,0.212,0.058,0.5527777777777779

But he poured way too much wine into the glass. Tsk tsk.... That's a no no especially with the type of glasses that were used. I had to tell him to stop at a certain point. Swirling is not for show aesthetics or being snobbish. It's to help identify the different aromas of the wine and also a way of aerating it to open it up. Anyways that's always a pet peeve of mine. More waiters must be educated on wine etiquette.  The patatas bravas was ok. The patatas con alioli was a little under boiled for the potatoes... The hanging beef and chicken were way too overcooked... The chicken and chorizo paella was actually very good. Well flavored. The citrus seared salmon was very good. You can hardly go wrong with salmon though.. If you do you should really reconsider being in the restaurant business..

They were out of the salmon dish that we wanted, and he made a recommendation for the scallops, which we ordered.

This was my first time to Ba Ba Reeba, and i was under the impression that it was small and intimate, but it is actually quite large. We had a reservation at 8.30pm and were promptly seated after we checked in. We decided to start off with some Sangria. We went with a white peach sangria. It was tasty. The prices for Sangria are around $7 a glass, $14 for a 1/2 pitcher (serves 3 glasses) and $20 for a pitcher (serves 6 glasses). We went with the 1/2 pitcher, which for the 2 of us was fine. IF YOU CHECK IN ON YELP YOU GET A FREE PINTXOS PLATTER WORTH $8.50. Can't beat that. So I checked in on Yelp and got that. It was really good and gives you a good idea of all the different tapas. But the Pintxos is essentially 1 bite Tapas, so there were 6 bite size Tapas. We split each in half, but this would not be good for a group. Also if you join CBBR's text club, they will text you deals for free Tapas. We then ordered the following tapas 1. Goat Cheese in Tomato Sauce. Highly Recommend that.  2. Beef Empanadas. Kind of tastes like a croissant with beef filing. I thought it would come with more than 1, but it only came with one. Still pretty good.  3. Braised lamb in Couscous. If was kind of like a lamb stew. If you are into lamb, then you would probably like this. if you don't like lamb, then probably not 4. Bacon Wrapped Dates. Delicious. You have to get these. For Dessert, we got 5. Caramelized Banana with ice cream. Delicious. Only thing is that the desserts are tapas style so they are really small.

2011-04-07,4.0,"Last weekend I was fortunate enough to dine here with a group for a bachelorette party and I had a great time. The food was awesome, the lighting was mellow and romantic and the sangria was quite tasty.  There were about 20 of us set up at a long table towards the back of the restaurant, so as the food started to come out things got crowded pretty fast. Several plates of our various tapas were spread out throughout the table so there was more than enough food to go around. We also had quite a few pitchers of red and white sangria spread around and the waitress brought us more bottled wine than we needed.  I am fairly certain our menu was picked for us as we had little cards with our group and the food choices on it, and I have no problems with that. I am notorious for taking my time ordering so having someone choose for me is just the bee's knee's (or spider's elbow?). The endive salad was light and fruity, the chicken skewers and mayo-y dipping sauce were awesome, but the best of all was the spicy potato dish. On their own, those potatoes are great, but with the orange sauce that comes on the side they are about 10 times better.  After about 5 or 6 rounds of tapas we were served two different kinds of paella. We had a veggie version and a chicken/pork mix. The vegetable paella was great. It was earthy and warm with a strong mushroom undertone. The chicken and pork, however, was awful. The meat did not taste or smell appealing and the texture of the rice was odd, a little too dry.  The meal was finished with 3 disappointing little deserts. I know tapas have small portions, but I like my deserts in big portions! There was one of each dessert for about every 3 people so, the little mini-cakes were even less satisfying. My half-bite of chocolate cake from what I could tell was good. There was a nut-log looking tart? that was just not for me. I did enjoy my own little mini-flan and that was one of the highlights of the night. It was cooked perfectly and sat on a little bed of coconut flakes.  Overall, great place with some extremely attractive ambiance going on and awesome food. The servers handled the group pretty well too. My lack of 5 stars comes from a bad batch of some chicken/ pork paella and not enough sweets at the end.",0.9963,0.76,0.182,0.058,0.572890559732665

I half expected to see the chefs preparing my paella while smoking cigarettes with hanging butts on the verge of falling into my meal. Most Americans might consider that unclean, but I say it adds an additional smokey flavor to the cured meats. It was a friend-of-a-friend's birthday dinner. I was super excited she picked this place because I kept hearing wonderful things but couldn't bring myself to go without a good reason. I know tapas places are notorious for charging an arm and leg, which is as un-Spanish as you can get considering that tapas are traditionally served like cheap popcorn or peanuts in dive bars. We were seated relatively quickly and began our culinary crusade (too soon?) through the treasures of Espana. Naturally, we started our journey out right with a pitcher of passion fruit sangria. A pitcher of red and a pitcher of white, and I think another pitcher of red were also ordered during the course of this meal. I thoroughly enjoyed all of them, but I would have liked it a little stronger and with a little more fruit. It might be considered too sweet for some, but I thought it was perfectly balanced. I was extremely pleased that all the guests decided to get in the true European spirit and split the food and the bill. It made things so much easier and gave everyone a little sample of most of the items on the menu. I'm ashamed to admit, but I ate: bacon wrapped dates, potato and onion omelette with some type of seasoned mayo, goat cheese in a tomato sauce with garlic bread, escargot with tomato and cheese atop buttered bread, pan fried squid, octopus salad, country style potatoes with a mild but bold red pepper sauce (my favorite), garlic potato salad and seafood paella bursting with fruits of the sea. The stuffed mushrooms looked and smelled amazing, but I loath mushrooms and didn't taste. My dining companions raved about them, though. The check comes and the number really smacks you in the face - $300. But then you realize that halfway through the meal you were about ready to burst. (I still don't understand why the majority of women there are wearing skinny jeans. I strongly urge you to wear a stretchy dress or pants with lots of elastic.) We had 11 people and picked up the slack on the birthday girl. They automatically added 18% gratuity, which saves me money since I typically do 20% but only do 18% to spite them when they hit me with mandatory gratuity. It came to exactly $30 per person. If I'd gone anywhere else I probably would have expected to pay that much for the sangria alone, so I think I got a great deal.

Ahi Tuna Poached In Olive Oil On Avocado Toast -  Again just okay, not bad but not spectacular.  3. Goat Cheese Croqueta - Super tasty bite! Filled with creamy, succulent goat cheese. Loved it.       5. Spanish Artisanal Cheese & Quince -Not a fan of this at all. The quince is a strange fruit...tastes good but has an awfully strange consistency to it.     6. Mushroom & Rice Croqueta Loved this bite as well. It had some flavoring that was almost curry like in taste. Really lovely taste. For my main tapas I tried the Spinach & Manchego Stuffed Mushrooms at $5.95. My favorite item of the night! They looked so good and tasted so very good! I was kind of sad my friends tried 2 so I was only left with 2 for myself. Selfish me. :P  I also had the Chicken & Ham Croquetas at $5.95. These were so filling and I could barely finish them but they were just fantastic. Our service was excellent and they gave my buddy some chocolate & ice cream with a candle in it for her birthday. It looked good but I was so stuffed from all of my bites I couldn't even taste the dessert!  Ambiance was fun like your usual tapas restaurant, sound level was loud and it was hard to hear people at my table.  I would defintiely go back to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba to try more dishes but will probably steer clear of the $1.50 pintxos next time.",0.9982,0.708,0.251,0.041,0.5567965367965368

We tried the black raspberry sangria and the passion fruit sangria both were great!  We got the pintxo platter for free because we checked in through Yelp.  Pintxos are bite-sized tapas popular in the bars of Northern Spain. It included a chorizo wrapped date and manchego, ahi tuna poached in olive oil on avocado toast, goat cheese croqueta- wow yummy, short rib-stuffed piquillo pepper, artisanal spanish cheese & quince- yummy, and mushroom and rice croqueta.  We got the spicy potatoes with a tomato aioli and these were really good. We had the spinach & manchego stuffed mushrooms and these were delicious but the sauce was a little too rich.  2 mushrooms were my limit.  The braised lamb, spinach, couscous & almonds was soooo flavorful. It was not gamy at all.  The roasted chicken empanada is a must-have.  The empanada was flaky and golden. This was delicious and it came with a yummy creamy aioli on the side.  We also had the Paella Valenciana.  It takes about 30 minutes to make the paella so make sure to order that first.  If I go back to Chicago I would definitely come back here.  They also have a location in Vegas, but on there website it says the Vegas location is now closed.",0.9921,0.808,0.192,0.0,0.5661616161616162

Their dates wrapped in bacon, octopus, goat cheese in tomato sauce, and tortilla espanola are all amazing also.  The red sangria is great, and a few pitchers for a group are always a good way to start of an entertaining night.

I've only had tapas one other time and it was a pretty enjoyable experience, so I was pretty excited to try another new tapas place. The service was top notch. Waiters were attentive and friendly. My mom twisted her ankle when getting up to go to the bathroom, but luckily me, a waiter, and a bus boy were able to catch her before she fell! The waiter got her an ice bag and another chair to elevate her ankle, and later the general manager came by to check on her! One complaint was that we got tired of waiting for the waiter to come back after paying our bill, but we were all paid up so we left anyway. The ambiance is nice,  The lighting is dim, but not dark, and the volume of conversation isn't too annoying, considering the halls are busy and crowded with other patrons.  We ordered a handful of tapas and shared them family-style (fittingly). I'm not sure I remember everything we got, but I'll comment on what I remember. Braised lamb was okay, kind of bland. Spicy potatoes were flavorful and aioli was light and complementary. Beef empanada... I've had better. The crust was kinda light and the beef wasn't that amazing. Ham and chicken croquetas were perfectly fried and pretty delicious. I know we ordered more, but that's all I really remember eating, but in all it was pretty good overall. Service was really quick, maybe 5-10 minutes after we ordered. We also ordered seafood paella for 4, and it came a little while after we were done with our tapas. The paella was kind of bland and our scallops and shrimp were way too salty. My mom said we should've sent it back, but half of us were already done with our plates, haha. Definitely not the best paella I've had. We decided to get some desert to top off the birthday celebration, we got the Pintxo dessert platter, which is a good deal for $6. Everything was delish. We also got coconut flan and tres leches caramel cake, and both were divine as well. Price was fair, ~$20-25 per person for tapas, paella, and dessert. This is a Lettuce Entertain You Restaurant so we used a LEYE gift card my mom got for Christmas. Overall, I enjoyed my experience but thought the food was somewhere between good and okay.

2011-02-28,5.0,"I'm going to talk about two things that I love in this review: Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba and Yelp. Let's begin with CBBR. The concept of tapas is foreign to many, and I was included in that many, but I've come to realize that sharing is caring. It doesn't hurt that with sharing you get to try a bunch of stuff, too! A meal at CBBR should begin with some sort of tasty beverage. Any of the sangrias are a great choice. But I'm a huge fan of the classic red and the mango sangrias [mango is a specialty].  We know the food is amazing [I'm determined to try every single tapas on the menu]. And some of the best tapas on the menu include the goat cheese in tomato sauce, citrus-cured salmon [YUM!!], braised lamb with couscous, and plato de casa. But the fun doesn't stop there, kiddies! The pinxtos are definitely worth a shot at least once, especially if you get the platter for free by checking in on Yelp!! But if you're ordering singles, go for the ahi tuna or the short rib-stuffed poblano pepper. And it keeps going and going...with paella. Order paella right away, as it takes quite some time to make. So decide quickly! I'd say that the seafood paella is my least favorite, and either of the other two are about even. Ask if they're serving specialty paellas that day, too. You might get a secret surprise!! If by the end of your delicious meal you can manage it, go for the dulce de leche tres leches cake. A-MAZ-ING. On the real, if you haven't already, download the Yelp app for your iPhone/Android device. Checking into CBBR twice [I believe] will get you a free pinxto platter. Yep, $FREE.99 for a platter. I love me some Yelp, man. **Sign up for the CBBR txt club, too. They'll txt you deals for free stuff, unless you hate getting free stuff. Then skip it.",0.9981,0.744,0.235,0.021,0.548888888888889

From the prix fixe menu, you choose a pixto, 2 tapas, a paella and a dessert. I had the spanish cheese and quince for my pixto which was just two pieces of fruit and two chunks of cheese. This was my least favorite thing from the entire nite but, it didn't kill the evening. The tapas i had were DELICIOUS. I love lamb so it was a braised lamb dish with coucos, spinach and almonds. Everything in this dish were so perfect. I also had a grilled calamari tapas which was very good as well. I was super super excited about the paella, and i'm sorry to say it was not the star. In my paella was shrimp, tomato, greenbean and of course the rice. Everything in the paella was good except for the rice, it was kind of hard. This was my first time trying it so i wasn't sure if it was suppose to be like that or not. But still this was not a deal breaker.  Finally dessert, we were so stuffed we had our dessert packed to go, but when i got home...my oh my...the Caramel - Dulce de leche, Tres Leche Cake was SO GOOODDDDD!!!!!!

I usually hate to wait, but wifey gave me that ""look"" which I interpreted as ""For once in your f*cking life will you please wait."" Hey, there was a bar, that was very well staffed, so I agreed. Within 10 minutes we snagged a few stools at the bar, and were immediately approached by one of the 4 bartenders they had working. We opted with the white Sangria, which was very tasty, and reasonably priced at $6 a glass. Exactly an hour later, as the Hostess promised, we were seated. Once again, the restaurant area was very well staffed. Our server was prompt, polite, and we never had to wait for water or a fresh glass of Sangria. We had a gift card, so gluttony seemed appropriate. Here's what we sampled: Beef Tenderloin w/ Blue Cheese:  EXCELLENT, and VERY tender! Bacon Wrapped Dates:  Uh, not nearly as good as 1492 Chorizo Wrapped Dates:  AWESOME! Goat Cheese Baked in Tomato Sauce:  Average Spicy Potatos: Much better than 1492! Basically, the tapas were hit and miss. Some were excellent, and some were mediocre. I still prefer 1492 better than Ba-Ba-Reeba, but the service here is second to none. Now, the one minor complaint that I have is Ba-Ba- Reeba packs you into this restaurant like sardines. If you suffer from Claustrophobia, I'd think twice about dining here on a busy night. Also, the one men's washroom, should say ""circle jerk"" on the door. The two measly urinals are so damn close to each other, your junk is basically all over the dude next to you. And, the one stall is even too small for a little person.  All in all: 5 stars for the service. 3 stars for the food and midget washroom.

And Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba gets that honor. My sister and I were in the neighborhood and I thought what kind of a Chicagoan would I be if I've never eaten here before and everyone else has. So we decided to check it out. Twenty-five minute wait on a weeknight. The smell of the grease in the air was making me nauseous before we even sat down. Ever heard of a vent hood in the kitchen? Did not like the college/teeny bopper crowd at all.  We were seated but our waiter took his sweet time showing up to take our order. Then he insulted my intelligence by asking me if I knew what tapas were. Yes moron, I'm familiar with the concept of tapas and I've eaten at just about every tapas place except this one. So we ordered and I waited, and waited, and waited, and then waited some more for my sangria to show up. The food started coming out and still no sangria in sight. Had to flag down two bus boys and tell them to go fetch my server for one of them to finally actually go and tell my server that he forgot to put in my sangria order. We had just gotten our last plate when my sangria finally arrived, with this from the server: ""Sorry, I couldn't read my own handwriting."" So the reason I sat here sangria-less through my whole meal was because you couldn't read your own handwriting? Oh, ok then, that makes me feel so much better. On to the food--the bacon-wrapped dates were dripping with oil, way too greasy and burnt. The chicken & ham croquetas--just gross and tasteless. The short ribs were decent but the mashed potatoes tasted like they were out of a box with no salt or butter in them, tasted like nothing. The skewered chicken & chorizo sausage was absolutely disgusting. I ate a piece of each and I wish I had just spit it back out. The chicken was not cooked at all. I can see why people get sick after eating here. I believe them! We both felt ill for a day after eating here. We didn't actually get physically sick because we only ate a piece each of the chicken, but my stomach was definitely not happy with me. Took forever to get our check. Take it from me, you're actually a better Chicagoan if you don't ever come here to eat.",-0.9455,0.818,0.073,0.109,0.63913139329806

I eat out like it is my job and this was by far the worst tapas restaurant I  have ever been to. Came on a weeknight for a quick dinner. Had a 30 minute wait and when we were seated, the waiter took his time coming around to our table. We place our order and tapas start coming out but he managed to completely forget about my sister's sangria order. With the lack of service, she didn't receive it until we were eating our last order of tapas because it took that long for one of the numerous people we flagged down to actually go tell our server he forgot about the drink! His excuse, ""Oh sorry, I couldn't read my own handwriting!"" Wow, I mean wow. There are so many things I could say right now but its just too easy so I will pass. I am sure you just thought of a few things yourself.  Anyway, on to the food! First the bacon-wrapped dates. Gross. Burnt and greasy. I've had much better at other tapas restaurants. This is a hard one to mess up but they managed. Second, chicken and ham croquettas. Meh. Tasted like nothing in particular and the dipping sauces didn't complement the dish. Third, the shortrib with mashed potatoes. The most decent dish of the night but the mashed potatoes tasted like they came from a box. Last was the chicken and chorizo sausage skewers. Wow, undercooked chicken and the worst tasting chorizo sausage I have ever had the misfortune of putting in my mouth. I love chorizo sausage so that was the final straw for me.

As such it's a pain to eat out for me most of the time and while I was going to be in Chicago for the day with a friend we really wanted to eat someplace nice. So I contacted Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba ahead of time via e-mail with my concerns and got a reply within 10 minutes from one of the owners; who said that he'd have the executive chef e-mail me back later that day when he was available. Needless to say, they were able to handle my concerns easily. When we got there we quickly became happy that we had made a reservation ahead of time as right after we got there the restaurant got very busy (same night Dan C. went), and we got a table as soon as we were in the door. Our waiter was attentive, very knowledgeable about the menu and made some great recommendations. He was also easily able to tell me what on the menu I was or was not allergic to.  There was some confusion as to who our waiter was when we came in. My friend and I didn't have an issue with this as the wait was still small and the service after the issue was sorted out was so perfect that it more than made up for the slight lack, for this we were comped our sangria and our deserts.

Fast forward four years and it was a very different experience. It's always strange when you go with a big group of clients mostly because you want to spend time talking and not necessarily people-watching or being constantly bumped. We arrived shortly after 630p on a Thursday night. At first it wasn't busy. But then it got insanely busy. What was nice was the food and beverages. Both were really quite good. We also took the time to get the paella to split with the table, which was well worth the wait. They had a great selection of adult beverages to make anyone happy. The desserts  were adorable! I say that because we got two sampler orders and split them, which was the right size and the right flavors. It's a very well-considered menu on the whole. But half the experience is the experience. The wait staff was not very attentive and I would also venture she was overwhelmed. It would take 20 minutes (minimum) to get drinks. Luckily others handled delivering the food. And parking. It's street or valet. And street is nearly impossible, though we had good luck there. Overall: if you are going with a group to have a blast or if it's an intimate date you're after, this is the place.

2011-01-01,4.0,"Ah, Cafe Ba Ba Reeba. I had come here before but neglected to Yelp about them. But here I am, ready to fulfill my duty to the foodie society.  We came on a Sunday afternoon. The bloody mary bar was still open and wow--talk about a smorgasbord. Top shelf vodka only. AND filled at the halfway mark. Fresh tomato juice, gazpacho, skewered shrimp, horseradish, olives--the works. I think we spent 15 minutes perfecting our bloody mary's (horseradish does it every time).  My eyes immediately went to number 68 on the menu--roasted dates with bacon and apple vinagrette. Oh how I lament going semi-vegitarian in moments like these (health reasons only). Last time we ate here, they were SO amazing. But this time we went for the seafood and veggies. Our adventure began with the spinach and artichoke crepes from the brunch menu. Not bad. Not bad.  The calamari with tomato crudo and jalepeno alioli--delish. Definitely the winner of the meal.  The seared scallops, couscous, pine nuts and raisins sounded interesting. I was certain it would be delicious but we were both left disappointed. *sigh* The scallops hardly qualified as being seared and the flavor combination simply didn't work.  But oh--here comes the saving grace. Yes, we decided to forego our size 26 appetites and went for desert. The flan--coconut, to be specific. I literally had a bodily reaction that I have never experienced before in my life. So we ordered another. If I could marry a desert, I think this would be the ""One"". Really--it was that incredible.  So overall we had a nice experience and I'm DEFINITELY coming back for the coconut flan.

I am seriously drooling right now thinking about them... Their mushroom empanada is great and so is their stuffed mushrooms (Being a vegetarian I always order it). My meat eating friends always have to get the chicken curry salad (I sneak in a taste) and sausage tapas.  They have these dates in bacon....well anything with bacon is generally good...

2010-12-24,3.0,"Ba-Ba-Reeba's potential is right there for the taking, but two major flaws keep it from a very attainable 5-star rating. The food was pretty solid when we went.  The cold tapas in our order were nothing too bad, but nothing too great either. The meats and cheeses were pretty good, but it doesn't really take too much work. The hot tapas were infinitely better. Meatballs in sherry tomato sauce, roasted dates with bacon in an apple vinagrette, not QUITE on par with the bacon-dates at HB, but probably a lot cheaper.  The mushrooms stuffed with spinach and manchego cheese were alright as well. The mushrooms were nice and meaty, not squishy or rotten at all. For dessert, I highly recommend the caramel marcona almond tart. It is fantastic. I do not recommend the chocolate truffle cake. Contrary to popular legend, there IS a thing as too much chocolate, and the chocolate truffle cake is just  TOO rich. I'd be happy to give BaBaReeba 5 stars for the atmopshere, great appetizers, and overall good time. That being said, there is room for improvement. 1) The tapas came out all at once. While I understand this is kind of the idea, when you have 12 people ordering 8 different menu items, in quantities of 3-4 each,  plus drinks, the table gets a bit crowded if they all come out at once. Maybe bring a few out at a time, especially as the latter parts of the evening saw the wait staff disappear. Not only did it make for a crowded table, but contrary to what I've known about Spanish dining (or good dining in general, is that it made the meal feel rushed, like they were trying to get us out the door ASAP. 2.) Their sangria.....SUCKED. I'm sorry. It's a tapas restaurant. Sangria is supposed to be your thing, guys, and it was weak as hell. I know it was made with white wine, not red, but my God. It tasted like apple slices floating in water. I was not impressed in the slightest. Hot tapas = 5 stars minus hit-or-miss service minus weak drinks = 3 stars. I wouldn't mind taking a date here, but c'mon folks. These things count if you're going to eat out.",0.9946,0.745,0.186,0.069,0.5777297895902549

Tortilla was a little bland but much helped by the aioli that came alongside it. The roasted eggplant was good, although we both got tired of it pretty quickly. Had a white peach sangria which was tast. Stuffed mushrooms were massive and very nice. The highlight was the dessert pincxo platter we ordered: an array of 6 itty-bitty desserts. SO TINY! SO TASTY!

The highlights, in my mind, were the curry chicken salad (very creamy, but tastier than I expected), the mango sangria (went down really smooth), grilled squid (not too rubbery), chicken & ham croquetas (deep fried but delish), spicy potatoes w/ tomato aioli (surprisingly good for something so simple).  A definite recommend!",0.9453,0.92,0.073,0.007,0.45292305292305296

Ba-Ba-Reeba has been on my list of ""need to try"" and tonight was the night. The restaurant itself was fairly busy which is great for a Monday night, so my friend and I sat down at the bar. I tried the Passion Fruit Sangria which was pretty awesome. The bartender told me their specialty was the Mango Sangria, but I'm not one for Mango..so if you are you should get on that. Next drink wise I had a mean margarita. It was delish.  For food we tried the following: *goat cheese croqueta *spicy potatoes with tomato alioli *beef tenderloin & blue cheese *roast dates with bacon & apple vinaigrette *roasted chicken empanada Some standouts to me were the spicy potatoes (amazing. loved it), as well as the dates wrapped in bacon. YUM. All else was great as well so try it out. I do wish I had ordered some of the seafood options but I was simply getting too full. I always feel Tapas is better when more people are involved. Then I'm able to try more options on the menu. But this just leaves me with an excuse to come on back. We ended our meal with some desert, because a lady always needs some sweetness in her life. We tried the following: *dulce de leche tres cake (I've had better, but it was good). *Marcona Almond Tart (AMAZING!!) *Spanish Brownie (Delightful). Cute little restaurant overall.

I've been a few times now and the one word sums up these tapas: GREASY.  Of course, greasy can be good and the food is good---- just not great or something to go out of your way for. Come to Cafe Ba-ba-Reeba for a few of the classic Spanish tapas:  sangria, wine, baked goat cheese and marinara (always a must) , great cheese selection, bacon-wrapped dates, olives, etc.   Unfortunately I find most other things fried, or sautéed with an oppressive, heavy-hand of olive oil.  Example 1, octopus & potato a la plancha: potatoes were fried and the peppers and octopus were swimming in olive oil.  Octopus is such a delicate protein, all of the oil masked masked the fresh flavor I was seeking!  The only notable thing about it was that they actually cooked the octopus correctly--- too bad they ruined it with too much oil. Example 2, fried green peppers & coarse salt:  one of my favorite tapas to order wherever I go---- except once again, here they are swimming in oil. Put a paper towel under those things after your fry them or something!  It IS possible to fry things w/o excessive grease.  Example 3: prime sirloin, asparagus, shitakes & yukon potatoes.  Again, ENOUGH WITH THE OLIVE OIL POOLS AND PUDDLES OF BUTTER!!!!! The meat was ok but the veggies were doused in fat. So sad! With of of this said, I do come back quite often. I love coming with friends because laughing, with a glass of great red wine in hand, beside a table of cheese makes for a perfect night.  Hopefully the chefs in back take a hint and ease up on the EVO and punch up the spices instead.  Anyway, great place to hang with friends and nibble but I'm still on the lookout for a better casual tapas spot.   if you want tapas to write home about, make the trip to Mercat a la Planxa.  Def a more upscale vibe but it does not disappoint.",0.9793,0.735,0.167,0.098,0.542948717948718

Tomato sauce was nicely seasoned.  empanada de championes (mushroom empanada with porcini alioli) -- I am not a huge fan of mushrooms, but people who had it said they liked it.  patatas bravas (spicy potatoes with tomato alioli) -- Good, but, i've had better.  For drinks my husband got a sangria which he said was good. One of my friends got diet coke and the server was a little tardy with the refills. The server did come by a few times to make sure that we had everything we wanted.  Overall a good food experience.

The food was awesome - a few standouts (bacon-wrapped dates, goat cheese croqueta, mushroom empanada, escargot; to name a few) and everything else was really good. Nothing sub-par. Sangria was also very solid. We first got the regular Red and the Concord Grape; the next round we just ended up getting the Red. The grape was very...grape-y. Price was good, especially for the booze (4 pitchers of sangria turned out to be $12 each). Overall no one spent more than $40 and all left very satisfied and full. My only complaint was that the place is so loud. We found it was hard to have decent conversation, and people a few seats away from each other couldn't hear each other. Just keep that in mind.

We had a reservation for 6:30 on a Friday, but we arrived a half an hour early because we had nothing better to do. The place was basically empty at that time, which was surprising. It did fill up pretty quickly though. We might not have needed a reservation at 6:30, but we probably would have by 7. Honestly, I had to take a look at the menu online just to remember what I tried here, and it was just two nights ago. The only thing I do remember off the top of my head was that I ordered a hot tomato soup, which was a special and came with little slices of toasted bread with cheese on them. I liked the bread, but the soup basically tasted like the Trader Joe's soup I buy, but it was slightly thicker. I like Trader Joe's soup and all, but I can make it in my microwave at home. The tapas I tried were the garlic potato salad, the Spanish artisanal cheeses. The cheeses were cheese (a.k.a. I can't really remember so they must not have made an impression),  but I really liked the garlic potato salad. I think I probably hogged about half of it for myself, but I don't think anyone cared since I'm a vegetarian and don't like mushrooms, so I didn't eat any of half of the other plates.

2010-09-24,4.0,"ah ba ba reeba, I missed you.  I used to go to cafe ba ba reeba pretty often but somehow it had fallen off my radar. we went back tonight and I remembered why I like it so much.  the evening started off a bit rocky. we made a resi for 6 ppl about 3 weeks ago. when we arrived right on time, we were told to please wait at the bar and they'll all us when our table is ready. so we did. and we waited. we finally got seated about 25 minutes past our reservation time and were all a little on edge. we tried to brush it off. also adding to our frustration, we got seated outside in the semi tented area. normally I'd be really happy about that....but it is fall now and it was 60 degrees! I don't think a restaurant should seat you outside unless they've asked if you're ok with it. especially when we had a reservation and it was clearly pretty darn cold. I swear I'm getting to the good stuff. after all this is a 4 star review.  about 5 min after we sat, the manager came over. he must have been informed of our grumblings. he apologized greatly for the delay in our seating and for our less than ideal table. he offered to close the tent roof a bit and pump a little heat in. he was just so nice and genuine that we were all reset and started fresh. the closed tent and heat made a huge difference. also, when we got the bill, he had taken $20 off. really great handling of customers. they definitely redeemed themselves. all I ever want is for a restaurant to recognize the problems and handle them. the money off was just super nice icing on the cake.  so the food.... mmmmm good. this isn't a super duper authentic tapas place. so if you want that, go somewhere else. it is a great fun place with really yummy food. it's a little more chainy feeling than I generally like, but the food really makes up for it.  some of my favs: curry chicken salad ( this is one of my fav things of all time. love it ) goat cheese and tomato sauce any of the empanadas  short ribs with mashed potatoes they're all really solid dishes. I don't think you'll run home saying ""these are the best tapas I've ever had"", but I also don't think you'll be disappointed.  side note - I am a little disappointed that they got rid of the egg salad with shrimp pintxo. it was soooo good.  oh yeah, and the sangria is great. thanks ba ba reeba.",0.999,0.695,0.258,0.047,0.5617142857142858
2010-09-24,3.0,"$25 gift certificate + desperately clinging to the last days of summer = an evening at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba.  Cleaning off my coffee table for the first time in months (that's what watching a marathon of ""Hoarders"" will do to you), I came across a gift certificate that was earned by attending the New Years Day Pajama Brunch at Ba-Ba-Reeba. Since it was expiring in November, I figured it was time to get off my duff and use it, and since I don't love sitting inside here and it was warm last night, my s.o and I made our way there to enjoy some tapas and sangria on their outdoor patio.  He hadn't been there in years, and I hadn't been there since New Years, and to be honest, neither of us would have gone here if not for the weather and the lure of saving $25.  To my surprise, this place still packs 'em in, despite tapas being rather passé. This was one of the first (if not the first) tapas places in the city (not sure if Café Iberico holds that distinction) and it's still going strong, so people obviously still go crazy for tapas. I can take 'em or leave 'em.  We were lucky enough to snag one of the last remaining tables outside since we didn't have a reservation (which never occurred to me that I'd need) and our jovial server greeted us and we ordered a pitcher of red sangria while we decided what to order.  Our server brought out our pitcher and asked us if we were on any time constraints so he could guide us accordingly and time our food. I thought that was a really nice touch and wonder why more servers aren't proactive. We actually had all the time in the world but we appreciated being asked nonetheless.  The sangria, as always, is consistently good and refreshing. Appropriately sweet (but not cloying) and fruity, it went down faster than a $5 hooker.  We selected a few tapas to get things going: ahi tuna poached in olive oil on avocado toast, baked goat cheese, and grilled calamari.  The tuna arrived first, and instead of tuna it was covered with chopped cauliflower. We both dug around and could find no tuna. The server came over and we showed it to him and he apologized and took it away to be remade. Once it came back correctly, it was very good. In fact, the server brought us an extra order of it, which was nice. I loved the smear of avocado on the crusty bread.  The goat cheese is exactly the same as every other tapas restaurant on the planet; nothing mind-blowing, but satisfying just the same.  I didn't really care for the calamari as it was rubbery and chewy and didn't have enough ""char"" for my liking for being grilled.  We were still hungry so we ordered a mushroom empanada and the sirloin with shiitakes, asparagus and potatoes. The empanada was huge for a tapas, but the crust was flaky and the filling was earthy and had notes of sherry; it was delicious. The sirloin didn't have much flavor, and it was cooked as ordered, but it was a tough cut of meat, so I'm not convinced it was sirloin. The accompanying vegetables were fine; the asparagus was a bit woody and tough, but the mushrooms and potatoes were decent, as was the sauce.  By then we were appropriately full, so we declined dessert and lazily sat and finished our sangria, lamenting the end of summer.  All in all, Ba-Ba-Reeba is a perfectly respectable place to dine if you enjoy tapas. The fare is consistent, if not entirely amazing, but you will most likely leave satisfied.",0.9923,0.818,0.122,0.06,0.5283932545796952
2010-09-23,4.0,I hadn't been here in years! The first time I think I was on a date and I hated it because it was loud and the guy was annoying and ate like a moron in public and I had to scream to make small talk and we sat outside and I was cold and sober.  Fast Forward a few years:  Came with a small group for a friends birthday dinner. Much better than the first time. Still loud but that just means it's OK for you and your friends to be loud too. I enjoyed every item I tasted (stuffed mushrooms and the goat cheese with tomato sauce being my standout favorites) and I especially enjoyed the sangria. Service was pretty good and the bill won't leave you clutching your heart from shock.

YUM. -escargot, garlic croutons, sherry alioli -seared scallops, raisins, couscous & pine nuts -ahi tuna poached in olive oil on avocado toast -beef tenderloin & blue cheese (the red meat eaters at my table loved this) would have loved to have tried the paella, but you had to have 2 people ordering that, and it took 35 minutes - we didn't want to miss out on other small tapas by ordering that, so we passed, but maybe i'd try that next time, as it smelled fabulous when it passed by. then, my bf snuck away and made sure the waiter knew we were celebrating, and asked for one of the desserts. our (very knowledgable) waiter brought out the one dessert with a candle in it, and then 3 other desserts, all on the house! very, very kind, and DELICIOUS! the carmelized banana dessert was 100% the best in my mind. the rest of my table liked the butterscotch cream. overall, great experience, would definitely recommend and go back. :)",0.9975,0.724,0.246,0.031,0.5183933933933935

One of the things I have learned to love about my BF is how he will order for me.  I have to admit, I was a little taken back by that on our first date but he did get it right!  So, I think having someone who really loves tapas and clearly knows how to order off of their extensive menu is the key to tapas bliss.  I gave him free reign of the menu and everything my BF ordered here was wonderful.  I would have to say my favorites were the goat cheese croqueta, endive salad, braised lamb, and last but not least....escargot.  YUM!  I could've probably eaten a whole plate of snails smothered in tomato sauce and goat cheese sitting atop a garlic croquet.  There was one moment where he did order something I was a bit cautious about....flan.  I have had flan before but it must've been horrible flan because, once again, the BF got it right.  The flan at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba made me a new fan of flan.  It was yummy, creamy, and a perfect end to a great meal.   By the end of our night out we shared 2 half pitchers of sangria (one raspberry and the other peach), enjoyed delicious foods that I normally wouldn't have tried, and again realized that maybe I should trust my BF a little bit more... he usually knows what he's talking about even though I hate to admit it! :)  Can't let that stuff get to his head, right?!",0.9976,0.717,0.244,0.039,0.5258101422387136

I think it may be really fun if you were to go in a big group but for just the two of us it was a bit much.  A few things kept me from feeling the love. First, it was really, really loud so conversation was difficult. Second, the floor was so super slippery that I almost fell twice just walking to our table--no sexy swagger for me. Heels and a slick floor=bad news. I mentioned this to the hostess who said, ""Yes, the floor here really is slippery. It gets worse as the night goes on."" Ew. What does that mean? I don't want to know what makes the floor slippery over the course of an evening--especially right before I am about to eat there. Third, the sangria was nothing to cheer about.  On the other hand, the food was great. We picked a handful of things to try and each one was delicious. Empanadas, Goat Cheese, Sausage, etc., it was all really good.

For our main round we had their potato omelet which was garlicky and delicious, the spicy potatoes with aoli (don't let the name scare you, they aren't that spicy), their steak with horseradish sauce and the salad with beets and orange. Ok, the horseradish sauce was incredible, i want to bath in it and I'm not much of a salad girl but their salad was so fresh you could taste the juicy orange in every bite. Yum!

It'd be worth the effort to order the singles and eliminate the tuna and short rib; you wouldn't miss much at all. The wrapped date was fantastic and worth doubling-up on.

The vegetable salad was good, but a few too many carrots for my liking. The aioli was delicious - there just wasn't enough! chicken & curry salad: The most generous portion of anything I've had there. Another winner. Needs more crunch - maybe some celery. I could eat this all day long on a french roll. serrano ham, salchichon, chorizo: Pretty good.

Some of the other flavors were a bit out there, and the server was less than enthusiastic about anything but the old standbys, for both flavor and alcohol content. Service was good.

I would also highly recommend coming here with a group instead of just one person.  You'll want to try lots of different things, but if it's just you and one other person, that gets expensive (and wasteful, since you probably won't be able to finish each tapa if you're getting quite a few).  My favorite way to do it is to get one of the paella selections and then lots of tapas that everyone can grab from.   Their beef tenderloin skewer is pretty amazing, too, if you prefer a meatier dining experience.  One former boyfriend described it as some of the best steak he'd ever eaten - and we had just come back from a trip to Texas, so that means something!

I've become addicted to the Spanish cuisine for about two months now and knew that tapas would make for the best choice to go out for. Enter Cafe Ba Ba Reeba. I made reservations two days before and the restaurant was incredibly accommodating when we arrived early. No wait or hassle even though it was fairly crowded. We arrived early and were seated in what seemed like a party room, or just an extension of the main dining hall. As I walked through the restaurant, I loved the atmosphere and decor. It actually reminded me a bit of Disney World. Authentic, but in a playful way. I don't mean that as a bad thing! When seated we quickly ordered a pitcher of the Black Raspberry Sangria. It arrived quickly and I have to say, pretty tasty! A little too fruity and I didn't think it fairly strong, but I wasn't ready to get loaded. For food we went ahead with the spicy potatoes which were fantastic! I expected that, but I really enjoyed these. We ordered a second round! My friends got plenty of meat (!) including chicken skewers and beef. They really enjoyed it. I also went ahead with the garlic potato salad. Weird, not too bad. After a round of food we ended up ordering two more pitchers of sangria including the Mango and The Classic. I felt that after awhile the drinks dwindled in alcohol content. Fortunately I was having a blast and didn't mind it. So why 3 stars? For a table of five, we were obnoxiously cramped. The table was too small and our seats kept hitting other guests so much to the point that my friend continuously had to turn around and ask the guy to stop bumping her. Plus the menus are ginormous and knocked over a glass of my sangria (pre-drinking, mind you). The size really bothered me for awhile, but I got over it. With that said, I really enjoyed this place. Solid food, good drinks, and made for a great night out. I'd recommend, although there are a few better tapas places to his before Cafe Ba Ba Reeba.",0.9937,0.769,0.169,0.061,0.5307065217391304

I can say that I've probably had about half the things on the menu at Ba Ba Reeba...of those, I can't recall a dish that I just simply didn't like.  My last time there was one of my last nights in Chicago and I ate myself silly. I remember trying to eat as many animals as I could that night...a tuna, a pig, a beef, a chicken, a lamb, you get the idea.  Unfortunately they were out of the cold tuna salad so I had to cross one of those animals off my list.  Highlights: The braised lamb with spinach, couscous and almonds is perfection. I think it's a great idea to combine lamb with the couscous and then something crunchy...so it doesn't get boring or too mushy. And the lamb did not taste game-y so that was a definite plus, it was seasoned just right.  Patatas bravas are always a good idea. I seriously want to lick that dipping sauce off the plate.  I've had the chicken and chorizo skewers twice...both times excellent.  We did end up trying a new item on the menu, it was some kind of steak, can't remember what it was called, but the combination of flavors was fantastic.  AND dessert!

The waitstaff was great and very patient with a group on a busy, rainy Tuesday night (and if it's busy on a rainy Tuesday, imagine weekends here).

I know this is a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant now, but I still was underwhelmed for a place that has been spoken so highly of before.  Beef skewer - huge amount of soggy onions, bland sauce and little portions of meat. Croquettes - why even bother; they're probably frozen. Squid - very good, but the sauce it was cooked in wasn't present at all. I tasted a lot of cooking grease instead, flowing off the fish like water.

The chicken empanada was okay, just wish our waiter told us it was literally one empanada and hard to split among 3. The paella was really good, it wasn't yellow like other paellas, I wonder if it's a different type. Regardless, it was good, just wish the waiter would let us have the pan instead of splittling (unevenly) the paella into plates. We also had the black raspberry sangria, which was amazing.

2010-06-05,4.0,"Ok, let's get this out of the way.: this place makes great food.  As good as it's Lettuce-Entertain-You brother ""mon ami gabi"".  In fact, the quality of these two restaurants makes me want to try every restaurant in the Lettuce-Entertain-You chain.   We came on a warm sunny afternoon and sat outside, so we can't remark much on the decor, other than that you should definitely try to eat outside if you can.  Not only is it a wonderful way to enjoy the food, you become surrounded by the smells of the foods of other patrons and leads to quite an appetite opening atmosphere. One cool thing about the menu: the pintxos.  They're bite-sized mini-tapas for $1.50.  We had the artisenal spanish cheese and quince and the chorizo wrapped dates.  The dates rivaled some of the best meat-wrapped-dates we've had in Chicago, including such places at Avec.  The chorizo was sliced super-thin and everything was flavored exquisitely.  We had to stop ourselves from getting 10 of them. As for tapas, we had the short-ribs with manchego cheese mashed potatoes, spicy potatoes with tomato aioli, grilled squid in olive oil, and the seared scallops with couscous.  Even with such a diversity of proteins and carbs, they shared one thing: flavor.  Each dish had its own unique flavor that simply screamed for your salivary glands to make copious amounts of drool and your stomach to scream for more.  The short-ribs fell apart at the prodding of your fork.  The juice from it make you wanna pour it in your mouth from the plate.  The spicy potatoes were deep fried and super-spicy but perfectly paired with the mild aioli to create quite a party in your mouth.  The squid was simply exquisite.  Simple and delicious.  You taste the squid, you taste the garlic and lemon, and you can't believe that something so simple can be so delicious.  The seared scallops were equally perfect.  Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and paired with a perfectly cooked couscous.  Really, it's not a coincidence that the word ""perfect"" was used so much in this review. No tapas meal can be complete without some sangria, and in this Ba-Ba-Reeba delivers again...perfectly.  We had the black raspberry, passion fruit, and the special of the day, mango.  Each one has enough fruit essence to trick you into thinking you were getting your daily vitamins, and enough alcohol to make the first part easier.  It was just simply perfect. At the end of the day, the tapas place with which we benchmark every other tapas restaurant in Chicago against is our favorite (and first): cafe iberico.  Honestly, this place does a great job of putting up a fight.  It really only loses in terms of price, but honestly, given the location and decor, it's probably worth it.",0.9974,0.8,0.17,0.03,0.5621428571428572

The service from beginning to end and from hostess to server was friendly and attentive. Our server gave us her honest opinion with our questions and her dining suggestions were spot on--we really enjoyed our whole experience. We started with a 1/2 pitcher of sangria--which was just enough for the two of us. Fruity and refreshing with lots of bits of fruit throughout. I didn't need more ice, but I noticed there was one server that all he did was add ice to sangria glasses for the folks that wanted/needed more ice.  We shared the Pinxto platter, the mixed greens with beets, oranges & goat cheese, the grilled sirloin with asparagus, shitakes & potato, and the grilled squid in olive oil.  My highlights:  The short rib-stuffed piquillo pepper (on the Pinxto platter) had a nice smoky flavor balanced by the mild pepper flavor. I also liked the Spanish cheese and quince (also on the Pinxto platter) just a very simple flavor of semi soft cheese and sweet quince. The salad was also very fresh and so light--I could have eaten the whole plate of salad by myself. The squid was very fresh and tasty--not at all rubbery, but I wished it was a bit hotter. By the time it arrived at the table it was lukewarm. The grilled sirloin was cooked to medium and delicious. The asparagus that came out was more like asparagus tips and there were definitely more potatoes than asparagus and shitake put together.  I also now have a new favorite summer beer--Estrella Damm--which the Hubs swears I can find at Binny's. (hope so!) and can you guess--yes, it's very refreshing and light. Perfect with tapas!  For dessert I had the coconut flan--I loved how all the deserts are small servings too! The flan was so smooth and creamy with a wonderful and subtle coconut flavor.  Everyone on the patio seemed to be enjoying each other's company, lots of conversation and laughter.  Good for groups or a cozy date.",0.9974,0.794,0.192,0.014,0.6298457792207793

Had it been mixed together like a stew, I think it would have been better. - the ahi tuna: maybe it was just an off batch or night, but it was cut very thick and was very chewy. Not good.

Moreover, the server had so many tables, service suffered a bit, it wasn't horrible but if you're the type that likes being waited on hand and foot you won't be pleased.  We did order a pitcher of Sangria, but $90 for a party of four is still a lot for me.         Overall, if I'm going for Tapas I prefer the Bull El Dias on Southport, it has a more laid back atmosphere and better Tapas.

After sitting through a red eye to Chicago next to a passenger who jerked in his sleep every 10 minutes and a long day at work, I was in desperate need of a cocktail with marathon legs. There on business, the partners agreed a solid Thursday night was in order, so they took us to Cafe Ba Ba Reeba.  With multiple sangrias on tap, a bustling venue with energetic patrons and a tapas menu that seemed like it exploded out of a flavor rainbow, sleep became a distant thought. The highlights: Rioja short ribs with manchego mashed potatoes, shrimp with garlic, olive oil & red pepper flakes, and the goat cheese baked in tomato sauce. The short ribs broke apart at the first sight of a blade, and the accompanying mashed potatoes were a carb gift basket. The shrimp dish highlighted the garlic which permeated in every bite and the goat cheese was, well, dairy perfection.

I have an image to hold the people must know! Any who, We asked for a table and the wait was 1 hour, okay fine, so we sat and waited in the walkway with two benches that leads into the restaurant. We both thought the hostesses was rude but I ignored her and sat patiently.  My friend realized that you had to be inside the restaurant to hear them call your name. So why isn't there speakers in the waiting hall so when they call your name you can hear instead of blocking the entrance? Well we got up and waiting in the packed area surrounding the bar and next to the kitchen. It was so loud you couldn't even hear the announcer ask for the name waiting to be seated. It made me worried we wouldn't hear our name because they don't come and get you. Sure enough an hour later we ask and our table is finally ready. Now it was been raining for a week here and were seated outside which I was excited for until our table was on a rug near the portable kitchen outside for the servers.

Stop one: Rough beginnings First off, I'll admit I've never been a fan. Meaning just I've been before and not really cared for the establishment. There is just something about the service, decor, drinks and especially the food that rubs me the wrong way. But foolishly I came in thinking maybe this time will be different... flash forward... I had to take a day off from work due to severe stomach cramps among other happenings that I won't divulge. Some THING didn't agree with me to say the least. That thing was paella!! I generally eat pretty healthy so certain greasy foods just don't agree with me but it's never been this bad. So it could be one part me, two parts nasty paella.  The night didn't start how it ends though. My date and I walked in to a smiling host who sat us right away. After meeting about 20 waiters (of course exaggerating but not by much) we were finally off ordering. To start we had stuffed mushrooms and the chicken empanadas which were both pleasant but nothing to tell mama about (Mama luuuuvess tapas). After a few drinks and some descent food, I was starting to think Café Ba Ba Reeba and I were developing a nice relationship. Then I made the mistake of trying something new, but I thought it was safe I mean they are known for their paella, aren't they?!?! Hell, it's even in their logo ""Tapas and Paella""! We ordered the ""special"" paella and what we received was ""special"" indeed... what was served was this greasy, soft rice, and what looked to be chicken (tasted like that ""chicken"" in frozen dinners other wise known as rib meat). It was a mess and both of us had the same feeling right away but being hungry still we decided to go with it. The portion size is for two but we could barely stomach it and decided to call it quits after eating only half of it (most of that half eaten by myself). Not feeling well right off the bat, we wanted quickly to call it a night but couldn't find our waiter, who hasn't shown up since stopping by when the paella came. It's almost unbelievable how quickly the night changed from good service and descent food to well the opposite. It was not a good night to say the least.

What we did like were the pinxtos - the tiny little bites so much like Italian cicchetti! They were fun, and the 'Special Pinxto' of the month? was very good, while a couple other were just ""ok"". Two main complaints:  The patatas bravas were anything but bravas. They were not spicy at all, and this is just tragic!! My sister would be offended by them. Second complaint: The food came out at once - which gave my date and I no time to relax and meander through the small plates, or settle in for a romantic start to our Friday night.  Probably a great place for a big group, but to me it felt like a 'get em in get em out' type of service, not a place to relax and enjoy the day as I had hoped (and had read a previous Yelper suggest). The bar area was definitely happening, and the happy hour food special is a neat idea. Oh well, maybe next time!",0.9959,0.62,0.303,0.077,0.4585467980295566
2010-04-25,2.0,"Another after-work tapas event with colleagues (refer to previous review of Cafe Iberico). Maybe it was just me, but after a longish cab ride to the restaurant, and a wait to be seated with our large(ish) party, the restaurant didn't live up to the hype. The sangria selections were inventive- in addition to the traditional white and red, Cafe had Blood Orange and Passion Fruit available by the pitcher. The passion fruit tasted a little like kool-aid but quickly worked its magic. As for the food, the definite stand-out was the spicy potato dish, followed closely by the bacon-wapped dates (can never go wrong with bacon). Meat dishes were hit or miss. The menu overall was extensive. Had I not come here with tapas experts, it would have taken me a bit to go through all of the offerings. Even for a weeknight, the place was packed. While the ambiance is conducive for large groups, I would not recommend it for overly corporate events, as things tend to get a bit animated (raucous?) in the main dining area as the evening wears on.

The wait staff is friendly and always willing at a moment's notice to explain more or less the whole menu down to itty bitty bits. Their ceviche's are very well flavored and the food comes out quickly. Their white sangrias tend to taste better IMO than their red ones but better is a relative word since they're ALL good.

The staff was attentive, and the tapas came out staggered so we were not bombarded at once with all of the plates. We ordered 1 cold and 3 hot plates, and 4 plates between 2 people was plenty. We also split the sampler dessert order and all 6 options were delish.  If you don't mind a little noise, this is a fun place to check out in Lincoln Park.

The only dish I was disappointed in was their garlic potato salad.  That's one dish that I feel Cafe Iberico surpasses them at.  Their cocktails are also extremely strong.  Definitely stick with their sangria.

Most of the food we had was okay but that was about it, just okay. The bacon covered dates were a bit embarrassing in stature and the bacon was a bit too crisp for my liking.

This time we had the Goat Cheese and Tomato sauce with bread was excellent as always.  The Meatballs with Sherry sauce were spicier than I remember, but really good.  The Beef Tenderloin with Blue Cheese was great, but only two pieces of meat seemed kind of chintzy for $11.  Last we had a Salmon special of the day that was also good. We also had a recommended bottle of red wine, which was good but was a little pricey at $40. It seems they've raised the prices since I was there about 6 months ago.  Maybe it's the economy, maybe it's because Emilio's has closed, but I payed $30-40 more for essentially the same food as last time.  And they're not hurting for patrons.  There was still a waiting line at 10pm.",0.9904,0.766,0.227,0.008,0.5180839002267573

I was with a large group, and our table was ready promptly after we arrived.

The sangria is some of the best I've had, and our server kept a fresh bringing fresh pitchers and filling our glasses. We ordered a dizzying array of dishes, I won't even try to remember them all, but I will speak to my favorites. I ordered a crab cake special that was very good, without a doubt the best crab cake I've had in Chicago. We also had grilled squid, shrimp with garlic, goat cheese in tomato sauce, spicy potatoes, and spinach and manchego stuffed mushrooms. All were fantastic. The pintxos were tasty as well, especially the shrimp and egg salad on toast. I also had bites of the braised lamb, and the beef tenderloin with blue cheese. Nothing disappointed, it was all well above average or excellent. I finished the evening with a chocolate truffle cake and espresso. Can you say ""I'll have decadence on a plate""? The bill was quite reasonable for so much food, sangria, and so many people. My friends had been to Ba Ba Reeba before, and all remarked that the food quality was improved over previous visits.  The service was attentive without being pushy or overbearing. It was quite appropriate for the atmosphere and price point. We had late arrivals in our group, and we stayed a long time, but there was not a hint of any grumbling on the part of the staff.

Bacon-wrapped dates, mushroom empanada, spare ribs, & goat cheese in tomato sauce are all on the list of things I can definitely recommend.

My menu favorites include the patatas brava with alioli sauce,  the stuffed mushroom caps and the baked goat cheese. I am a vegetarian, so this is about all I can eat from the menu... yet I dream of these potatoes. I have, on occasion, even ordered an extra carry out of potatoes before leaving!

It has a home-y, warm feel and it smells like yummy sizzling meats. Mmmm. The service is best described as spotty-- I always had my water filled to the brim and dishes came and went very promptly, but we had some difficulty getting the attention of our actual waiter.  We got the Pinxtos platter. It was all good, but the short rib-stuffed pepper, mushroom and rice croqueta, and goat cheese croqueta were the standouts.  We also got the short rib with mashed potatoes, sirloin with spinach, bacon wrapped dates, and spicy potatoes. The short was incredible... it melted in your mouth and had wonderful flavors. It tasted like the pot roast that you wished your mom made. The sirloin was very good, and I was surprised at the good hunk of meat you get for $8. I was excited for the dates after reading reviews, but I wasn't as impressed. Bacon = yum, but the dates were so sugary. It tasted like candy wrapped in bacon. It was good and I see how other people love it, but I prefer more savory flavors. The potatoes were good, golden brown with just a bit of spice and come with a creamy tomato aioli for dipping.  I'd come back and order a lot of the same things. The prices were average for a tapas place. If you go, pleaaasssee try the short rib!",0.9955,0.776,0.192,0.032,0.5048648648648649

Then we got 1 of each of the brochetas (like a metal skewer that hangs from a pole on the table).  This was nice a great way to share with the others, and the presentation was great.  After all of that meat,  we shared the seafood paella (note: we were 8 people).  We drank sangria throughout and it didn't disappoint.

2009-10-28,2.0,"I had a good experience here a couple of years ago, so was happy to return for tapas with a friend the other day.  The place was pretty crowded for a Monday night, which surprised me, but we were seated right away at a small table for two.  Upon being seated, the table already seemed crowded with a stack of small plates, salt & pepper, cutlery, etc. Our waiter was very nice, but seemed a bit overwhelmed; he stopped by to suggest the specials and ran away just as I opened my mouth to ask for a half pitcher of Sangria.  A few minutes later, my friend and I had already decided which tapas we wanted; the waiter returned and we made our full order.   The half pitcher came first.  It was the perfect size for two diners, and was perfectly decent sangria.  The tapas followed soon thereafter, and came at a staggered rate so that we were able to complete a dish or two before the last of our order arrived.  With just 2 of our selections on the table, however, it was overcrowded.  By the time our last dish arrived, it had to be balanced on top of the clean small plates.  This was a crowded table and made for awkward dining! I also want to mention that we were given an extra dish of tapas that we had not ordered, and were charged for that dish on our final bill.  The problem was quickly resolved by our waiter. Now, for the tapas themselves; I was not impressed.  The spicy potatoes were flavorless and served with a bright orange flavorless sauce.  The ahi tuna was overspiced with spices that would be more appropriate on beef, served on a salad drowned in oil and vinegar.  The goat cheese was fine, but I've had better at the Medici on 57th.  The endive salad and the calamari were yummy, but I wouldn't return just for these two dishes when the rest of the menu isn't on their level.   Based on my past experience here and the good reviews on Yelp, I expected better.  Better dining accommodations (small tables don't work in a tapas place), better wait service (maybe adding staff so that mistakes and neglect such as I listed above don't happen), and better food (flavorless tapas?  I'd rather stop by a Vienna Beef hotdog stand and get some bang for my buck).   I'm giving 2 stars because I'm willing to give this place one more chance; it could have been an off night in the kitchen and our waiter could have been covering for folks who stayed home sick.  The table size issue is something to really be concerned about, however; if you go, ask the hostess to seat you at a larger table.",0.9925,0.779,0.155,0.065,0.5101904761904762

We sat in the dining room and took advantage of the banquette seating (see below). Wine selection was pretty good. We enjoyed a few bottles of Pinot Noir over our small plates. Overall, a great meal. And not too expensive for the quality of food. What made the night so memorable was the fact that we sat right next to the most awkward first date. Ever. Some poor girl sat victim to terrible questions like, ""What do you look for in a guy?"" and ""What's your take on creme brulee?"" while the guy passionately presented his grocery lists of a) why he doesn't date and b) what he looks for in a woman. Yes, we eavesdropped. Yes, we might have taken a few pictures. And yes, we laughed when the guy had a tray of dirty plates dropped on his head. But we about lost it when he got a free dessert out of the deal and then high-fived his date. Classic!  Thanks to the intimate setting, we were privy to one of the funniest meals on earth.

That gave us just enough time to order a huge ""Hey, Kool-Aid"" size pitcher of their excellent red sangria! This place is huge. They have tons of different seating areas, and the atmosphere is jovial and lively. Nice enough for a small group, a first date (witnessed one), or just catching up with friends while sharing small plates of food called Tapas and Pintxos (PEEN-chos). I actually used Yelp before my visit! Thank you, Yelpers! We ordered: -Bacon-Wrapped dates (very good, but better at Mercat a la planxa) -Patatas Bravas (do not skip this dish, perfectly seasoned red potatoes with a spicy dippin' mayonnaise) -Baked Goat cheese in tomato sauce (good) -Roasted Salmon with artichoke & confit (salmon was fresh and cooked perfectly) I also got one of the small Pintxos on special, and it was an herbed goat cheese with pears on a crostini. I could have eaten that all night! Did I mention we were having trouble polishing off a whole pitcher of sangria between two people? I mean, it tasted awesome and drinking is fun, but a 1/2 pitcher would have been plenty! For Dessert: -Carmelized banana, vanilla ice cream, with dusting of pistachios (excellent, and perfect size for a small price) Service was excellent all night, save for one time they put down a dish that wasn't ours. We immediately had them take it away. I loved how our many servers brought dishes out one at a time, pacing the meal, instead of serving it all at once. There wasn't room enough on our table for all of the food anyway. When we were finished with our food and just polishing off the sangria, they didn't rush us at all.

Seriously, that people would continue to want to dine here two decades after it was the hot spot on the Halsted strip in LP bespeaks something. What that is, I suppose is highly subjective but it will make a review nonetheless. If it is innovative tapas you are seeking, you should venture to Mercat in the renovated Blackstone.

If you are looking for a spot to go with a group- perhaps out of towners-  to sample a a vast tapas menu, several sangria options, and some half way clever cocktails. CBBR is your spot and you won't be disappointed. Tapas is always a good option I think- its nature allows you to sample so much without being limited to the starter menu and one or two entres. I would say, those of you true foodies would likely turn your noses at CBBR. It's part of a chain, there is no seasonal menu and there is nothing 'local' as far as I can see.

2009-09-28,5.0,"Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba officially stole my tapas-virginity and my heart last Friday.   My entire party was new to tapas and we were more than thrilled to have the loveliest waitress I've had in a long time.  Not only was she super friendly and sweet but she was SO knowledgeable about the menu. So down to the good stuff - food.  I'm officially out of work in 2 hours so it's probably masochistic to start describing the delicious explosion of taste that occurred on my palette that night; but here goes:  baked goat cheese- this was a safety i think... you can't really go wrong with bread, tomato sauce, and goat cheese, at least not in my opinion. Seared Spanish Sausages- my favorite tapa we got, hands down.  You get 4 different kinds of sausages and each are delicious and unique.  It comes with a dipping sauce which, at the risk of sounding like a pretentious foodie, basically tasted like mayo.  But no worries, sausage needs no dipping sauce in my world!  Even taking into consideration my intense love for sausages of any kind (from bratwurst to chorizo and back), this plate pleased my non-sausage obsessed dinner mates just as much. Grilled Sirloin- this was very good, the sirloin was done to perfection and seasoned beautifully.  I don't think I will get it in the future only because it wasn't all that exciting, it was a basic (albeit well-done) sirloin and grilled veggies.   Garlic Shrimp- yum yum yum! even when you're done devouring the shrimp the garlic/olive oil/red pepper offers a perfect dipping sauce for the bread.  Just beware of getting too much red pepper on your bread - it is not for the meek of spice. the drinks were just as great as the food.  We started with the passion fruit sangria, which I adored, then ended up getting the pitcher of the black raspberry sangria (I was sadly outvoted).  Both versions were delish but I liked the passion fruit better because it was a little lighter and not as sweet as the raspberry version.  I also will admit a bias to anything resembling a pinot grigio or chardonnay.    So the nicest and most unexpected surprise about this place is the obvious value they place on their customers.  We made a reservation for 8:30 that night and were not seated until 9:15, not that big of a deal because we enjoy each others company and even more so over a glass of sangria.  Anyway, once we got seated the owner/manager (not sure which) came over and apologized for the wait.  We assured him it was no big deal and that we happily kept ourselves busy at the bar in the meantime.  At the end of our meal he brought over the check and it displayed a big fat $0.00.  The collective reaction was WHAT?!  This is AWESOME!  and very very unexpected.  I'm never one to turn down a free meal but it is especially nice to be treated to one when you don't really think you deserved it (ie: we were not the bitchy party who yelled at the hostess about the length of the wait, claiming that it ""should not be that difficult to estimate the time to get a table"" since they are ""a restaurant after all!""). Summary: 1.  eat the sausages 2.  drink the passionfruit sangria 3.  leave happy, tipsy, and full!",0.9993,0.707,0.246,0.046,0.6072995102540557

This was the best meal we had in Chicago (and we had very excellent meals the whole trip).  My only complaint is that the black raspberry sangria we had was a little watered down. Nonetheless, it was refreshing.  When we first walked into this cafe, I was convinced it had to be a chain restaurant b/c it looked so polished on the inside.  We went a little nuts with the tapas, but here are the highlights: - The 6 bites on a plate dish (first thing on the menu). I am still having wet dreams about the tomato jam and manchego skewer. Also, the croquette of risotto and mushroom made me fall out of my chair. The perfect bite.  - The escargot on toast with roasted red peppers was amazing. I have never tried escargot before but it was so tender that I have definitely gotten over the fear of eating snails.  - Bacon wrapped dates. Nuff said.  - The spicy pork dish. Kind of a miss in my book but I was pretty full by the time it showed up. Which is saying something, because I tend to think American renditions of tapas are bullshit b/c it's an excuse to charge you a lot of money for not a lot of food.

If passion fruit isn't your thing, they have five or six flavors to choose from. I tried the chicken and chorizo skewer. It was nicely cooked. The sauteed onions and peppers were great with the meat. However I did not care for the mayonnaise type sauce that they put on the plate. My best friend tried the ham and pineapple tapa, which he said was pretty good. He also tried the short rib and mashed potato dish as well. He thought it was great. The meat was very tender and the mashed potatoes were surprisingly good. We then tried the chicken and pork paella. On the menu it says that you need to have a minimum of two people to order it. Just be aware that the menu price for the paella is per serving or per person. Other than the price we both thought it was quite delicious. I thought it was the best part of the meal. We then decided to try the deserts. My friend ordered the cherry bread pudding. He thought it was good and would get it again. I tried some type of caramel almond tart, which would be amazing with a good cup of coffee. The manager brought us two free desserts outside of the ones that we ordered because it was our first time there. I thought that was very nice of him to do. All in all, I would definitely return.

2009-08-12,4.0,"I walked past Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba a few times and it was always packed with people. It's intimidating for some reason. I have never tried Spanish-inspired cuisine or tapas. I told myself, ""Self, you have to come again with a friend."" A few months later, I met up with a couple of friends for dinner. I walked in through the hallway and I instantly fell in love with the atmosphere. Big legs of serrano ham hang from the ceiling next to the bar and the open kitchen. It's a pretty amazing sight. Then we had the sangria, paella and a couple of tapas. The waitress must have told the manager we are new to this place because he came up to us and introduced himself. Oh, and by the way, he brought us three kinds of desserts ON THE HOUSE. Ahh, lovely. But that was months ago. I have became a regular at Ba-Ba-Reeba ever since. This is pretty much my hang out place and it was the place that I went for my third date.I mean, it's a no brainer. They have a ton of selection to choose from and excellent sangria. I particularly love their grilled skirt steak, grilled calamari and paella.  Service however is so-so. It sorta went downhill after my first visit. It wasn't bad but it wasn't too good either. Grouchy servers definitely don't go well with tapas. Regardless, it is still a good place to go to enjoy the night.",0.8894,0.825,0.112,0.063,0.4686782768513537
2009-08-08,2.0,"Okay, I will let you know up front the food was very good for casual tapas, but was it worth the horrendous service?  I think not... I can honestly say that this was the worse service I have had in years.  In short, go to Iberico(the food is comparable and a bit more authentic) at least the service is better(that is saying a lot if I am routing for Iberico's service).  Also, I can honestly vouch that Iberico actually puts wine/and or liquor in the Sangria--CBBR's Sangria was just juice.  Plus, your salt and pepper shakers at Iberico will not be covered with grease--totally disgusting. Let me give you some positives, just in case you want to order ""take out""--highly recommended that you do.  To name a few highlights, the Gambas al Ajillo, Braised Shortrib, Escargot, Patatas Bravas, Sausages, and Croquetas were all delicious...the food was good tapas fare.  No issues here with the food and the pricing is very reasonable. Went to CBBR for my cousin's Birthday...we had reservations for 8pm, of course they didn't seat us for 20+ minutes after because they were ""setting the table""--okay, I get this...but when we finally arrived to our table, only half of the place settings had been set.  So, the waiter sort of ""chuckled"" and asked us to either wait in a corridor or go all the way back to the front of the restaurant.  If it is going to take you 20+ minutes to set a table, the table should be set and the host should at least be somewhat apologetic about the situation. So, we finally sit down, peruse the menu and are ready to order our drinks...of course, no waitress shows up for another 15 minutes, and when she finally showed up, she grabbed our drink order and darted.  Finally, the waitress returns and takes our order--everyone is ordering for the table.  So, I place my order for 3 tapas and when our food finally arrives, she missed two out of the items I had ordered.  How does that happen?  We address the issue and tell her to forget about one of the items and to bring the other... the other item never shows up....and then we wait, wait, and wait for her to show up, again, to inquire about the whereabouts of this item and to order more food.  The waitress finally shows up and plays dumb and says, ""I thought you cancelled this item..."" At this point, we are over wanting more food, so we skip ordering more.  The waitress disappears, again(now I know why they call them ""wait""-tresses.  Then we wait, wait, and wait for her to ask if she received the memo that we have a birthday to celebrate and if we would like to see the dessert menu, so we can order a birthday dessert...did not happen.  The waitress shows up with the smallest sliver of chocolate cake with a candle on it...procedes to light the candle with 5 or 6 attempts and just gives up and hands the lighter to the birthday girl.  Okay, we can't change the fact that we were never given the option to get a better dessert for the birthday girl--issue excepted, however, at least  ask the rest of the table whether they want to see the dessert menu? 20 minutes go buy as my cousin is eating her pathetic chocolate birthday sliver(SO EMBARRASSING) and no offer to see a dessert menu.  Our waitress finally shows ups after my cousin has finished her dessert and the waitress asks finally if we want to see the dessert menu--it was the consensus at the table if she had  asked us at the appropriate time(after our meal), we ALL would have ordered dessert--but, no...  The entire experience was unconscionable and the sad thing is, this restaurant has so much potential because the food is not bad for what it is(I mean we are not talking about fine dining here) but service is service whether you are at L2O, Alinea, or  even dive restaurants--obviously CBBR isn't a dive, but I think I have had better service at Weiner Circle or Ed Debevics, if you get my drift. The reason this dinner was such a failure on so many levels is they had the potential to make more money by actually providing ""service""--we wanted to order more food, drinks, and desserts, we just weren't given the opportunity--the owner is definitely getting a letter from me about this...in this economy, I think he/she can hire far superior employees who actually want to encourage repeat business.   I usually tip 20% even when the service is bad, and I ALWAYS give extra gratuity when the party is larger then six... this has been the first time 18% was a sufficient tip.

Their sangria is a total rip off. The pitcher was half full but we were charged for a full pitcher. *sigh*  We ordered 20 different dishes as we had a big group. There was only one dish which I really liked. I don't remember the name but it was a very tender beef dish. You could cut it with a spoon. Since we were celebrating bday's we brought in a cake. It was nice that they didn't charge us BYOC(ake) fee :) I say this b/c Marche charged us a fee for bringing in a cake.

BBR (which sounds like PBR but is so much classier it hurts) is freaking amazing. The atmosphere can be a little crowded and cheesy, but it's very colorful and a fun place to go with groups. I've always thought the service here was above-average. Waiters know how to be friendly and helpful but not over-the-top stalkers. But onto THE FOOD... Shortribs with manchego mashed potatoes: YES. The shortribs come with a delicious sauce. Very rich, and very tender. Patatas bravas: If these potato pieces aren't fried, then I am very surprised, because they were very crunchy. They are spicy, though, and not just coated in a wimpy sauce. As Jacob F pointed out to me, the aioli is fantastic, too. Bacon-wrapped dates: I don't really like sweet and savory together, but I got over it and ate these puppies. I'm glad I did, because they have a perfect blend of sweetness and smokiness. Scallops: Fantastic...very fresh and nicely charred (but not too much).

The second minus regards one of my orders.  I ordered the rioja short ribs with mashed potatoes.  Pluralizing ""rib"" was misleading, because I got one tiny slice of meat that was about... 1"" x 6'"" and 1/4"" high, with maybe a 1/2 cup of mashed potatoes, and it cost me $8.50.  I respect and revere the animals we eat, but I expect a little more out of $9.  Wouldn't you? Other than the ""ribs,"" everything else seemed to be priced okay.  The desserts were small and only cost $2.75, which was perfect.  I wish all restaurants did that.  By the time I've had my fill of dinner, I don't have room for a slice of cake the size of my head - I just want a little sweet taste!   Dishes that made me say OH MY GOD: calamari, spicy potatoes, stuffed mushrooms, pork kabobs with confit potatoes, and (for dessert) the caramelized bananas, chocolate cake and almond tort.  Wow!!  Mouth is happy.  :)   Summary:  fun place with delicious food.  Don't expect your reservation to be honored, and if it isn't, try to relax at the bar.",0.9963,0.784,0.182,0.034,0.6029444444444445

And the horseradish sauce , was just a sauce that maybe shared shelf space with a horseradish , because there was no tang in the sauce itself.  The desserts- What can I say ... Cold bananas for the fried banana dessert. Once again maybe they were placed near a frying pan but never made it in?  The one redeeming part of our dinner - the sangria. It was delicious.

It can feel a little crowded depending on where int he restaurant you sit but the tiered seating and open space give it a party like atmosphere. Their drinks are a little on the expensive side but to be expected at a lettuce entertain you restaurant. The menu has a number of real winners. You definitely want to try the goat cheese in tomato sauce. Creamy and delicious comes with really delicious toasted bread. The curry chicken salad with Grapes is a also a must try. The Short Rib with mashed potatos is also just incredible. I love the grilled octopus too. Can you tell I like this place. The one menu item I would avoid would be the spicy potatos. They are very good, not great. But they are too much and take up too much space in your stomach that should be occupied with other delicious foods. The now have daily amous bouche that I would highly reccomend. Not everyone we've tried have been perfect but some are down right perfect. Amanda and I both really enjoyed the shrimp with egg salad. I know it sounds weird but it is really good. They also have delicious Paella. But unless you're in a large group I would go with tapas.

Drinks You're eating tapas.  Get the sangria.  The passion fruit sangria is by far my favorite, but you really can't go wrong with any of them.  1/2 pitcher = 5 glasses. Tapas My safe (always ordered, always loved) picks are the bacon wrapped dates (I can eat 4 of these without feeling too guilty bc they are THAT GOOD), spicy potatoes (I've heard them once described them as BBQ potato chips that have been rehydrated and formed back into potatoes), and paella.  Short ribs w/ manchego mashed potatoes are also pretty amazing. Be careful when ordering the paella.  The way they write the pricing is a bit unclear.  Make sure you read it thoroughly.  IMO, the paella for 2 is enough for 4 people (unless you don't plan on ordering other dishes.) Desserts The only one I really like is the caramelized bananas.  Everything else was just okay.  Remember that desserts are also smurf-size.. definitely not enough to satisfy my sweet tooth.

Mushroom and rice croqueta (Pintxos menu) - SALTY, rich, flavorful, crispy.  One is enough to share for 2 people, because any more might make you feel sick. Serrano ham & caramelized pineapple (Pintxos menu) - the ham was wet and a little too gooey for me to enjoy.  I like the mouth-feel of a dry serrano ham better.  You need one for each person. Rioja short ribs and manchego mashed potatoes - very salty boneless short ribs, creamy mashed potatoes with fragrant cheese.  This would be better with less salt in the meat, but the flavor was great and the meat was falling-off-the-bone tender. Seafood Paella (minimum order 2) - I loved the smoky flavor of this red paella with shrimp and scallops.  Even the leftovers were delicious.  Two portions could easily feed three people (if you don't eat a lot, or if you order tapas, which is really what you went for, right?). I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Cafe Ba Ba Reeba.  Our waitress happened to be a Californian and a fellow alum of my undergrad school, and we chatted a bit.  She was really sweet and very attentive.  When we received the bill, my mom was given a $10 certificate for her next visit to Cafe Ba Ba Reeba--a Mother's Day promotion the restaurant was having.  I was informed that for Father's Day, the restaurant will be giving fathers a $25 certificate!",0.9932,0.822,0.171,0.007,0.5400921658986176

I've been here before a few random times when I first moved to the city. I can't remember those times too well, mostly because I was with people I didn't know very well -- or people whom I no longer talk to -- trying to be social but instead getting drunk off sangria on the patio and having a typical summer weekend day. I came here again last Sunday with some out-of-town friends, hoping to have a seat outside in celebration of the 70 degree day. Sunshine and sangria for the perfect Sunday. Of course, the freaking patio was closed. There was next to nobody in this place. We were hurried back to the back room, full of crazy art and a pig statue (which made me keep on thinking of the SWINE FLU!). My waiter was either new or stoned -- I think it was the later because he was pretty freaking weird (and I like weird people, but I wasn't loving this dude). The pace was slow, the colors were light -- and I just wanted to freaking be outside the whole time I was in here. Oh well. Also, they stuck us on a perimeter table (not a fan), and there were some really fucking annoyingly loud people next to us (hope they got the swine flu in their chorizo!). Food = amazing. Did a bunch of stuff....chicken and chorizo skewer things, goat cheese in tomato sauce, chicken empanada, calamari, skirt steak, some kind of salty ham (amazing), and a paella. Said paella was amazing and had a smoky taste...and I wish I had a never-ending supply of this inside of my oven --- just open up the door and, hey!, paella! how much would that would rock? good thing that we didn't eat outside because it started downpouring shortly before we left. oh, and what the hell is a Ba-Ba-Reeba?",0.9378,0.757,0.138,0.105,0.4632034632034632
2009-04-26,5.0,"Amazing brunch is created by a combination of key elements. To begin, the bloody mary. Well, with a bloody mary bar you've no excuse if you can't create the bloody mary of your dreams. Begin with one of seven or eight vodka choices, then take your glass to the bar and choose one of four tomato juice/mixes. Now, try to leave enough room in you glass after all the hot sauces, citrus juices, peppers, and celery salt for some garnish. In fact, bring a plate because you'll need it - but don't go taking all the shrimp skewers, ya cheater. Save some for the rest of the kids.  Now that we've got the bloody mary in hand we're ready to peruse the menu. Start with the pintxtos platter - six little bites to get your mouth in shape for the serious consumption to come. They're phenomenal, and appetizers are an important role in brunch. If you begin the main portion of your meal too soon you'll never make it back to the bloody mary bar for round two.  Ah, drink in hand, a couple bites enjoyed - it's time to order the tapas. Some sweet, some savory, some dinner, some breakfast, some helluva recipe for the perfect brunch.  Some wonderful asides: They deliver hot churros to your table. Yum.  The menu is as big as Montana. Wow. Lots and lots of vegetarian and even a few vegan options.  And you can always get cava sangria if you're not into bloody marys.

""THANKS CHICAGO, I HAVE GAINED AT LEAST 10 POUNDS IN LESS THAN 5 DAYS.""  I feel quite happy and fat.   Dinner this Thursday night with 2 other friends. We ordered 2 tapas per person, which were more than enough since we had a late afternoon cocktail hour with lots of snack.   We ordered the following (in order of my own preference):  1. Garlic shrimp (delicious with lots of garlic. We finished up all the garlic oils with accompanying bread)  2. Sea scallops with couscous and pine nuts (Mm mm, pine nuts with pesto sauce.)  3. Rioja short ribs (melt-in-your-mouth tender. Just a tad bit salty for my liking. I did not taste manchego cheese in mashed potatoes that came with it)  4. Crispy spicy potatoes (A must order for tapas for me. I love Patatas bravas but with less mayonnaisey sauce, but rather spicier zestier ""crystal hot sauce-like"" condiments)  5. Short rib-stuffed piquillo pepper (bite side, from Pintxos menu. Tasty but Rioja short rib is better)  6. Chicken and Chorizo kabobs (not bad, but just not memorable)  7. Spicy pork kabobs (was kinda dry. kinda boring. could have been much better if it was served with some kind of sauce)  We also ordered two desserts.  I liked them... mostly because they were small.  Almond sorbet and butterscotch thingy. Things that I wanted to order if I was still hungry:  - bacon-wrapped dates  - goat cheese croqueta  - gazpacho  The last time I was here was over 5 years ago when I lived in Michigan and I do not remember anything about what I had tried back then.

We sat at the bar, but noticed a table of four where packing up their things so we rushed our cutie little fashionista butts over to their bar table. We ordered the mango sangria after chatting with a cutie waiter about many glasses a full pitcher comes out to be. 7 or 8, sounds great! We then ordered the coat cheese in tomato sauce, spicy potatoes, and beef tenderloin with blue cheese. Everything was delicious & the sweet sangria complemented everything so nicely. I have to say the beef tenderloin topped with blue cheese & homemade chips was my favorite of the evening. The tender, juicy beef topped with the perfect amount of blue cheese. I don't even like blue cheese & was hoping I'd find another piece below all of those addictive, salty homemade chips. I could have done without the goat cheese tapas, but my dining mate is kind of obsessed with goat cheese.

2009-03-31,5.0,"I love this place. I've tried Twist and Tapas Barcelona and this is still my favorite tapas place. Tapas Barcelona is a close second, but Twist is wayy behind both of these restaurants. I went here on a Tuesday night, which was nice because usually during the weekends it is really really crowded. Between me and my 3 other friends we ordered 9 hot tapas and 4 desserts. I love trying a bunch of different dishes and that's why I really enjoy Tapas and dimsum style places and family style.    The 9 tapas we ordered included: spicy potatoes (prob my favorite dish here, the potatoes come out really hot and crispy and the sauce is delicious), the bacon wrapped dates (i absolutely love this combination, if any of you enjoy sweet bacon this is the dish for you), the short ribs (omg the meat just melts in your mouth), the stuffed mushrooms with spinach and manchego (so good), the garlic shrimp (the shrimp was fresh and it was tasty but in comparison to the other dishes this was just ok), the scallops with pine nuts and pesto (i thought this was a very creative dish, the combination of pesto with pine nuts, tomatoes, raisins with scallops I thought worked very well together), the mushroom empanada (good but nothing special), and the beef with the chips (the beef was very tender but really just couldn't beat the tenderness of the short ribs), we had the baked goat cheese (which usually i love but i must admit tapas barcelona and even twist has a better baked goat cheese, i think the tomato sauce here was just so-so).  For dessert we had the tres leches cake, the truffle chocolate cake, the butterscotch custard, and the caramel marcona almond tart. My favorite was the caramel marcona almond tart but I have very biased towards caramel, but the caramel was really chewy just the way i like it. My second favorite was the butterscotch custard, but it is a bit on the sweet side but really was extremely butterscotch flavored.

2009-03-28,2.0,"Went here for dinner during the summer - my expectations were so high and I ended up being fairly unimpressed! The peach sangria was all right, and had good flavor, but wasn't strong enough for my taste.  There was a trend with all the food - it seemed like it was cooked beforehand, and sitting there waiting for somebody to order it. It didn't taste freshly made, and the hot food wasn't as hot as it should be (nor was the cold food cold enough)! When the food tasted good, it almost seemed like an accident, like it was good in spite of the preparation! The cheeses were very mild and were served with a nice preserve and some nuts, but they had condensation on them when they came out - implying that they'd been sitting out - this was the Spanish Artisan Cheese Plate.  The asparagus salad was tasty but not terribly impressive. The scallops with couscous and the beef tenderloin with blue cheese  were the best dishes - they were well cooked and had good flavor, but the temperature was off.  The chicken and chorizo was very plain - basically just meat on a stick without a whole lot to make it special.  The service wasn't also very attentive - busboys would drop plates on our table without removing empty plates. The tables were also so close together that busboys were precariously dangling trays over our heads as they served other tables. All in all, sometimes the food was good, but simply because the ingredients were sometimes high-quality. The presentation and service seemed to fight against the food.",0.9738,0.752,0.158,0.089,0.6192301587301586

My recommendations would be the skirt steak, the spicy potatoes, and definitely get a pitcher of sangria (if you don't--you missed half of the reason to go here). Prices are also very reasonably and two people can eat and drink very well for under $100.  Tougher part of the deal is finding parking sometimes. So if you make reservations and are like me and only use valet in case of emergency , give yourself an extra 10 minutes to find a park and walk a few blocks.

My gfs and I decided to leave the pleasant 70-80 degree weather of SoCal and visit an old college gf in Chicago this past weekend. On our last night there, we wanted to do a nice dinner before a night out in the town.

Skirt Steak w/ Scallions - very good Shrimp in Garlic, Olive Oil sauce - very good Spicy Potatoes in Tomato Aioli Sauce - the aioli sauce was very good but we were disappointed with this dish, perhaps if we had received it as one of the first dishes rather than last we would have liked it more. It was decent but definitely not as WOW as the previous dishes.  Meatballs in Sherry Tomato Sauce - this too was a disappointment, we ordered this one last minute after seeing someone else order it and just remembered we wanted to try it too. we probably should have ordered something else when our waiter said it was good but not one of the best, he was pretty eh about it.  Butterscotch Custard Cream - our waiter was pretty adamant about this but it was WAY too sweet for our taste - and I really love my sweets too!  Chocolate Tres Leches - LOVED IT! Cherry Bread Pudding a la mode - LOVED IT! Our waiter sensed our disappointment with our last few dishes, and being that it was our first time there, he comped the meatballs and all of our desserts!

My friend SWEARS by this place.  She loves the tapas and always comes here whenever she's in Chi-city.  Since we were a little too early to crash another friend's house party, we decided to descend on Ba-Ba-Reeba and give the ol' girl a shot.  We called for reservations for 6:30 but showed up about 5:45 and it was no problem to be seated right away. We snatched up a half pitcher of white sangria - so yummy.  Definitely worth the half pitcher if you will be splitting with another person. There were three of us and we ordered the.... citrus-cured salmon (not very good - too much cucumber mush on the bread), crispy spicy potatoes (YUMMM), baked goat cheese (YUMMM), chicken ham croquettes (yum), chicken empanada (small, but yum), some special beef tenderloin dish - three tenderloins with different toppings (yummmm) So basically we stuck to the meat and potatoes which constitutes much of the menu space.  Great for sharing with groups, as per tapas' style, and well presented in a nice pace; once we finished a dish another was right in its place.  Overall, we ate WAY too much and were totally stuffed.  A friend got one of the bite-sized desserts (seriously, it was tiny), but I still could not have fit anything else in my stomach. The restaurant is cute and very red.  Cozy tables, extensive menu, lots of space, fun atmosphere.  I'd come again if I were in Chicago and wanted to enjoy lots of different flavors with a large group!  Plus, we only had one type of the sangria....",0.9942,0.76,0.194,0.046,0.45963948332369386

My friends and I ordered the red sangria, which was very good, and reasonably priced (I think around $18).  For tapas we ordered the calamari, squid, spicy potatoes, the short rib, goat cheese, and a couple other dishes that apparently weren't very memorable.   The spicy potatoes and short ribs were unbelievable.  Next time I visit, I will definitely be having both again, maybe two orders of the short ribs.   While we were enjoying our food, the manager came over and profusely apologized for botching our wait time.  He gave us his card and assured us it would never happen again, and that we could contact him directly for our next reservation.  I was impressed by this, because my friends and I never complained to anyone, we simply asked the hostess a few times how much longer it would be until we could get seated. At the end of the meal... we open up the bill, and it was FREE.  The whole meal, including the sangria!  Because the food was so good, and the fact that the manager/hostess knew enough that we had gotten screwed on our table, and they fixed it without a single complaint, I am DEFINITELY going back (I think I'll make a reservation this time though...)   Next time I go I'll update the review again, and assume I will be able to give it 5 stars.",0.995,0.813,0.174,0.013,0.4171836734693876

Raspberry Sangria was also a let-down since it tasted like iced-water with just a hint of raspberry flavor, so after a pitcher of that, we decided to give the regular Sangria a try, which tasted a whole lot better.

Okay, moving on.  I enjoyed this place, it's a little (or a lot more) crowded than I would like and I think the 30 minute wait (even though we had a reservation) and the hostess calling your name over the speaker is pretty lame and commercial-y - but the food for the price is pretty awesome.

Our bill came out to $49 something (it didnt include the $20 pitcher we got at the bar), and we were both shocked since we were definitely nice-n-full!!   The timing was right, we didnt wait too long and everything didnt bombard us all at once.  The portions did their job for a party of two.

Case in point this past Saturday night: We split a pitcher of Peach sangria between three people. One insists that they gave us juice and there was not enough alcohol in it. Three glasses later we were glad we didn't drive. I've been here in both summer and winter, and it has its appeals in all seasons. Coming in from the snow, it made me forget that I'd just been freezing my a** off, and brought me back to the summers I lived in Europe during my early teens. Each tapas dish averages at about $7, and I would say order one dish for each person you have there, plus a ""side"" kind of dish, and a dessert. Vegetarian? Try the stuffed mushrooms. Not vegetarian? Try the stuffed mushrooms AND the blue cheese steak.  I'm salivating just thinking about it.",0.9605,0.853,0.11,0.037,0.5342105263157895

Some dishing and noshing to kick off the long weekend. Raspberry Sangria - what a great idea. The Red Sangria is delicious as well, and begs you to stay for Just One More. So, we did! The hams hanging from the ceiling reminded me of my vivacious trip to Espana in 1995. Every single bar I went to there had jamons hanging from the ceilings. The difference here at BaBaRe, was there was no cigaret smoke curing the hams, as there was in Sevilla. Did they taste the same - I'll have to go back for that. They were the same variety, though, with (ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS STOP READING NOW) the hoof still attached, and a little cone shaped drip cup stuck in to catch drips of savory ham juice. The tapas . . . $3 tapas for happy hour, made this a happy TWO hours! It wouldn't be a Yelp review if I didn't mention the savory, crunchy, juicy BACON WRAPPED DATES. So simple, yet sooo delicious. Enigmatic little nips of goodness. Crunchy, chewy bacon, and plump-when-you-cook 'em dates. Sinful. But who doesn't love to sin, I ask you? Squid in vinegarette - another simple dish, very authentically Spanish, and so good. There are not dozens of flavors in most of these tapas, just delicious ingredients - and the food seems better to me than the last time I was here (more than 15 years ago!). Both the dates and the squid were swimming in a delicious juice that tasted great sopped up with the bread. The olive tapas is an excellent value, giant dish of olives. The meatballs, with patatas swimming in a savory, tangy sauce - delicious sopped up with *more* bread.  If you go here, dine at the bar, like a Spaniard, and what the heck . . . let's have another raspberry Sangria!",0.9936,0.788,0.173,0.039,0.5305776014109347
2008-11-23,2.0,"I'm surprised that most of these reviews lately have been overwhelmingly positive. When my boyfriend and I went to eat here, we were sadly disappointed in the food. All in all, the food was trying too hard, or not trying hard enough; I'm really not sure which one. It didn't taste very authentic. It just tasted like a poor man's attempt at tapas. Here's a breakdown of what we ordered: 1. Endive Salad Pretty good, except for these HUGE chunks of membrillo that would have served the salad better had they been cut into tinier pieces. 2. Caesar Salad w/ Serrano Ham Typical caesar salad, a little overdressed. 3. Fried Calamari w/ Tomato Salsa The presentation was horrible. It honestly looked like slop on a plate. The pieces of calamari were huge, and the breading wasn't consistent. It was probably some of the worst calamari I've had. Soggy and flavorless. Same goes for the sauce. 4. Anchovies w/ Almond Pesto One of the better dishes. However, the texture of whatever cream sauce was paired with the pesto detracted from the dish. Everything else was crunchy and sharp-tasting, and the sauce was mushy, and way too creamy. 5. Beef Tenderloin and Blue Cheese Seriously...  $11 for two tiny bites of beef and potato chips. What a rip off! Tasty, but I spent the rest of the meal feeling cheated. 6. Braised Lamb with Spinach, Couscous, Marcona almonds Probably one of the more successful dishes. The flavors were all really good, but everything was over-seasoned. However, I do appreciate that the lame had flavor, which is something I can't say for a lot of the lamb I've had at other restaurants. 7. Skewered Chicken & Chorizo Sausage All kinds of bland. Nothing out of the ordinary. Came with a mysterious dipping sauce on the side. Helped a little bit. 8. Truffle (Chocolate Cake) Apparently, they fail to mention that the cake is flourless. Not bad, but neither a truffle nor a cake, really. 9. Carmelized Banana w/ Vanilla Ice Cream Score. Finally something that surpassed average! Thus the 2-star rating. ""Meh. I've experienced better."" The service deserves a better rating, but I can't get over my disappointment with the food. My server was pretty damn good. Save the end of the meal where he was a bit too insistent on our purchasing dessert. He coursed our meal exactly the right way even though we didn't tell him anything when we placed our orders. Also, the mini-churros were awesome. The bussers were great with refilling our water. The food runner, however, was very unclear with announcing our dishes, and kind of threw them onto our table. At the end of the meal, when I told the server I wanted the check, he came with dessert menus instead. (Boo!) Then when we told him we didn't want dessert, he left and came back with two desserts on the house since we were first-time customers. (Yay!)

2008-11-22,3.0,"When I think tapas, I remember the brief time I lived in Madrid. The best tapas came from the littlest bars and restaurants and were served in a very simple, no-nonsense way.

Although not authentic, I was happy to find the tapas at Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba to be pretty damn good. The short ribs were tender and could be cut with a fork and the garlic shrimp were just as garlic-y as their Madrid counterparts. On the negative side, the stuffed mushrooms tasted like they came out of a box and the paella was missing the great crust that paella's are known for.

We actually only waited at the bar for about 20 min, tops, and while drinking a pitcher of sangria the time passed quickly.  I am not a sangria fan but on this evening I did not seem to have a problem helping to finish the pitchers we got. Once seated on the patio our server (Desere I think) greeted us right away and made some menu recommendations.  We got another pitcher of sangria and set out to decide on items from the menu.  We got a small lobster paella (which takes 30 min) and decided to order our first round of tapas.  The easiest way we found to do this was to have each of us pick one plate and then all share it. The highlights from this round were the goat cheese stuffed mushrooms and escargots and the spicy potatoes.  Although I enjoyed everything I found the hot tapas dishes on the greasy side.  The big hits for the table for the second round were the hot goat cheese and the roasted tomatoes filled with tuna.  The food came out very quickly. After two pitchers of sangria, 11 small plates and small paella were all very full.  Surprisingly the bill did not turn out to be as expensive as I expected for all of the food that we had. We paid about $30/per person.  Overall it was a much better experience than I expected service was great and fast and the food, although kind of greasy, was tasty and good. I do not know if I will go back but it not for bad food or bad service  , because I would rather explore other Chicago tapas restaurants. My suggestions: -As expected most items came with 2-4 pieces which is not always easy when you have a party of 5, so be prepared to split mushrooms or scallops in half with your dining companions. -Order some tapas from both the hot and cold sides of the menu to balance out the greasiness of the hot items.",0.991,0.849,0.121,0.031,0.5405204872646735

2008-07-19,2.0,"Decent food and sangria, BAD service. Although the food was pretty greasy and the ""spicy potatoes with tomato alioli"" was just a fancy description for french fries. We had a reservation for 9 PM on a Friday night. It was crowded but clearly there is not going to be a wait for tables once we're done, so why rush us? Our waiter stopped by our table at least 15 times throughout our meal, probably every 5 minutes. I don't think that's good service, I think that's excessive and annoying. He would just stand there when we were in the middle of conversation until we had no choice but to acknowledge his presence. I understand that alot of restaurants in Chicago try to rush their customers on busy weekend nights, but it was already past 9 PM by the time we sat down. Even if we rushed through our meal in an hour, how many tables could you possibly need at 10 or 11? Plus, the whole point of eating out for me is to hang out with friends, not scarf down my food. And if the obnoxious waiter is one of our main topics of conversation, that is NOT a good thing. He kept refilling our sangria glasses from the pitcher, which again, some might think is good service, but after the 10th time, is just annoying because we want to control our own drinking and share equally. He was probably just trying to get us to drink more or finish and leave. I was also not impressed by the ""outdoor"" seating, which was an overly crowded extension to the restaurant surrounded by 3 walls and a ceiling. An obvious way to just seat as many people as possible.

One of my dining companions made a fascinating observation about the waitstaff. Service here is really good, fast and friendly, but there's some subtle (and totally understandable) passive-aggressive behavior going on: The waiters like to direct sangria-sloshed stiletto-wearing drunkorexic loudmouths to the bathroom that's at the bottom of a rather steep flight of poorly-lit stairs, rather than the one that's right next to the table where the eight blondes with identical caramel lowlights are sitting. I watched half a dozen girls (one wearing a tiara and sequined ""Bride-to-be!"" sash) gingerly navigate the stairs and thrilled with pride when I was pointed to the convenient bathroom, which was totally empty. Maybe the downstairs bathroom has TVs in every stall showing Sex and the City reruns... The food was Lettuce Entertain You-quality: inoffensive, surprisingly authentic-tasting in an obviously faux kind of way (Passionfruit sangria? Bitch, please.) and pretty freaking expensive. The people-watching is, obviously, transcendent, especially halfway into that second pitcher of sangria. But if I'm going to eat tapas in Chicago while surrounded by representatives of a much-maligned stereotype of young urban whiteys, I'm going to go to People in Wicker Park, where the much-maligned whiteys are MY PEOPLE and the sangria is stronger AND cheaper.",0.9463,0.734,0.156,0.109,0.5581207482993197

2008-06-30,3.0,"I would actually give Ba-Ba-Reeba two and a half stars... I would give it four stars for my visit last August (2007) and one star for my visit last Saturday (June 2008).   First, the good:  The food has not disappointed on either visit.  In fact, the bacon wrapped dates were so good and so memorable from last summer that it was the first dish we ordered this time around.  Last summer we had about ten tapas for four people, and, while that wasn't enough food, everything we had was really tasty and worth ordering again.  Last Saturday we had three tapas - bacon wrapped dates, seared scallops, and spinach salad - and we also ordered the ""butcher's paella"".  All of the tapas were first rate.  The paella - meh, not so good.  The butcher's paella is supposed to have sausage, pork, chicken... our pan had nearly zero chicken and very little non-sausage pork.  As a result, the liquid in the paella had become very greasy and was not very appetizing.  I would definitely try a different paella dish or simply stick to the tapas.   Now, the bad:  I have been to a ton of Lettuce Entertain You restaurants - anyone that lives in Chicago would be hard pressed to avoid them - and I am a huge fan.  One of the things I love about LEY restaurants is that even when the food isn't great, the service (in my experience) is almost always first rate.  I had one bad experience at Brasserie Jo, but everything else has been terrific.  Not Ba-Ba-Reeba.  At least not last Saturday.  We arrived at the restaurant twenty five minutes early, so I expected them to send us to the bar.  Instead, hostess number one asks us to ""step around the corner"".  We step around the corner, wait five minutes, and then hostess number two - with considerable attitude tells us that we will need to wait at the bar because we are too early.  Blah, don't need that attitude... but thanks.  So, we get to the bar... I order two glasses of red sangria - $13.  Seems steep, but ok.  I give the guy $15.  We then are called to our table by hostess number three (more attitude), and shown to a table on the patio.  We sit down, open the menus, and look at the drink list - red sangria is $5.50 a glass.  I wasn't overly impressed.  Then, our server arrives.  She doesn't appear to be interested in letting us experience the leisurely pace of dining that one would normally associate with an evening eating tapas, for when we place an order for two tapas she asks ""Is that all?"".   Our first tapas come, and we place an order for a spinach salad and paella. By now our sangria glasses are empty.  I certainly need another drink, but flagging her down proves to be a chore.  When we finally get her attention we order a half pitcher of red sangria.  Several minutes later (shortly before the salad tapas dish arrives) our ""half"" pitcher of sangria arrives.  When we finish the meal the bill tells the story -  she had brought a full pitcher.  Being overcharged for drinks isn't a big deal - we are only talking $8 total - but the constant attitude from the waitstaff and the complete indifference to our experience in the restaurant was really frustrating.    I am sure that we will go back to Ba-Ba-Reeba because we really do love the tapas and the sangria; hopefully the service will be back up to LEY 's high standards.",0.982,0.874,0.088,0.038,0.42133916522074416

We had lots - the cheese sampler, garlic shrimp, octopus with potatoes, bacon dates, croquettes, chicken turnovers and the Spanish sausage platter - I say it all in English, because the tapas here are crazy Americanized and lacking strong Spanish flavors I've come to expect from tapas. Many of these items were individually priced less than at some of my favorite tapas spots, so that part was nice. Everything was okay, not bad, but only just fine. The croquettas though were really soggy for something that is usually fried crispy and I couldn't get anybody to eat them.  The octopus was not very well marinated and I'm a little afraid it's tentacles grabbed my innards a bit, because it took some effort to get that down.  I did like the presentation of the bacon dates on toothpicks.  I was disappointed with the white sangria, which didn't seem like sangria at all, but like a glass of slightly sweetened white wine with tiny diced pieces of fruit only on the top and the glass was almost completely filled with ice. The chicken tenders from the kids meal was one of the best things I had here - a whole chicken breast fried crunchy and super flavorful and then cut into strips served with mashed potatoes - I might get that myself if I come back here.

I investigated both of the ladies' rooms last night and was appalled. I've seen better johns in dive bars or at McDonald's. OK, back to the review. But man, that seriously annoyed me. Ba-Ba-Reeba isn't the only establishment to neglect the bano, but it was probably the one that sent me over the edge! This is a great and dependable place for tapas. I find the prices to be fair, the service accomodating and it's a great place for groups. There's something to be said for a place that instantly conjures up images of dates wrapped in bacon...last night I tried the scallops with cous cous for the first time and a pork tapas that had just the right amount of spice. While I have been to Spain and eaten patatas bravas  more times than I can remember, it's the sauce here that I always return to. So, I'll definitely be back. Just renovate the bathrooms, people!

What Babareeba lacks in its menu it definitely makes up for in atmosphere though.  The crowd is very attractive, and our server was a very good combination of friendly and accommodating.  The staff was very helpful in refreshing our bread, filling our water and taking our plates away.  It's still a fun place to go on a weekend evening.",0.9916,0.794,0.2,0.006,0.5897142857142857

But someone in my party of four had heard from a friend they trust that this place was good, so we went. And I've got to say, sometimes you just have to try places even if Yelp doesn't give them 5 stars because, get ready, sometimes everyone's perceptions and opinions aren't the same! Shocking I know!  I loved Cafe Ba Ba Reeba! And so did my whole party! It wasn't dirty at all like some said, and the service was great! We were sitting in what we thought was a bit of a draft and we asked to move, even though it was pretty busy, and without a single roll of the eye, we were moved to a warmer area. Our server was very friendly and helpful, and that was much appreciated since none of us had been before.  Now on to the best part, the food and drinks!!  Drinks: We had to have the sangria of course! But here's the thing, my hubby and I are one of few who don't like wine. But we really liked the sangria! We had half pitchers of the peach and black raspberry. I personally liked the black raspberry better but both were yummy. Just so you know how much you are going to need to get tipsy, the half pitcher filled up all our cups (party of 4) and with about a cup and a half left to split among us. Two pitchers were good for us, we didn't want to fill up too much on liquids! It's Tapa Time:   Now I can only speak for myself because I couldn't try all the meaty tapas but by mmm's and ohh wow's that all my dining party was cooing on about, it seems the meat tapas were a hit too. The portion size was very nice, you could easily share with three other people and still have a couple of bites to yourself. They came out quick and were paced nicely.  Cold Tapas: I had the green beans, roasted tomatoes and shallots. And it was excellent, the beans were crisp and everything was well flavored. I also had the asparagus with grilled red onions and red pepper. The red onions and peppers were really good but the asparagus lacked flavor, although cooked to just the right crispness.  Hot Tapas: This isn't really a tapa but we had this wonderfully tasty soup that was carrot and orange I think..but don't worry it doesn't really taste super orangey, it had almost an Indian flavor to it. SO good! We also had fried green peppers and course salt. It was very good but know that it is spicy! And speaking of spicy, I also had the spicy potatoes with tomato alioli sauce. Ohhhh my oh my! This was my favorite savory dish!  It was sort of spicy but not so spicy that I stopped popping those spuds in my mouth. And the great part was that it was literally a mountain of potatoes and it was plenty to share and still have tons left for me!  Now onto my favorite part of any meal...the sweet stuff!  Dessert Tapas: We all split three desserts and if I had my way, I would have had one all to myself they were so good! We had the truffle chocolate cake, apple crisp, and the almond caramel tart. I have to say that the caramel tart was my favorite but the chocolate cake was a very close second, my guests liked the cake best though. They are small servings and a bit cheaper than the other tapas, so make sure to order a couple! Save room because I feel like these tapas were the highlight of the dining experience!  All in all, a great place to go, especially if you love variety in your meal. A really fun experience and a great place to take out of towners and family. If you go with friends, just make sure you share nicely and be careful, it's easy to get carried away ordering lots of plates in a group, make sure you set a price or plate limit before you go in! :0) On the flip side, it can be a pretty cheap meal if it's just two of you because you can watch what you order easily. Ok, enough reading about it! Turn off your computer and head on over to Cafe Ba Ba Reeba! There are pitchers of sangria calling your name!",0.9995,0.757,0.223,0.02,0.5671891534391533
2008-03-13,5.0,"I was inspired to write this review after seeing its current rating...3.5 stars?!  What are you people thinking?!  This is my absolute FAVORITE tapas restaurant.  I recently moved to SF (by the way, don't believe anything you hear about the ""amazing"" cuisine....with the exception of Chinese food and seafood, Chicago wins, hands down), and babareeba is on my list of ""Things I Crave in Chicago"".  You can't go wrong with any of the sangria flavors, but my personal favorites are black rasberry and passion fruit.   As for the entrees, again, you can't go wrong.  The paella is good if you're hungry or in a group, but I normally fill up on the tapas and the toro brochetas....aka heavenly skewers of perfectly grilled meat on a gigantic metal stick.  That being said, the last time I was home for a visit, my little party of 4 filled up on 6 pitchers of sangria....YUM-O-LA. The decor is very rustic and spanish cafe inspired....a person feels like they're in a street in Sevilla when they're in this restaurant.  I'm a little surprised to read that someone thought the bathrooms were dirty...I am a germaphobe to the extreme (I carry 4 things with me at all times: wallet, chapstick, keys, and purell), and I think the bathrooms are fine.  I think the person is confusing the decor with bacteria.   Anyway, my mouth is now watering (from the thought of the food, not the bathrooms), so do yourselves a favor and check this place out!",0.9936,0.804,0.187,0.009,0.5515555555555557

My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Oh and how could I forget, the sangria was really good as well, we just had the basic red.  Service was good, but my one gripe would be that several of our small plates came out all at once and I prefer to have them come separately or 2 at a time.

I simply will not go under any circumstances, without reservations and neither should you. Props to BBR and all other Lettuce Entertain You restaurants for having on-line reservations through Open Table... however, yesterday the best we could get would have been 10:30. So we decided to go with another couple and take our chances putting our name in. I have no problem with waiting, especially on a Friday night w/o reservations- and the wait was worth it (I'll get to that)- but I did have a problem with being quoted ""an hour and a half to two hours"" only to be given a real snotty response when I checked in after an hour and a half with the hostess that ""You checked in at 7:53 and we quoted you up to 9:53. We have until 9:53 to get you a table."" Oooookay... if I'd been rude or belligerent in the way I'd asked, I would have deserved the response, but that was not the case. It had me wondering though, what happens if they'd seated me at 9:54? Do I get a free bowl of soup for my troubles?  Anyway, we were seated (at 9:47!) and had a very kind and patient server who did a great job. The food was outstanding... the shrimp in garlic and olive oil with red pepper flakes was the best I've had by far at the versions at Iberico, Twist, Emilio's, or Sangria. Other highlights were the skirt steak with green onions and herbed butter... jockeying with the shrimp to be my favorite! When I woke up this morning, immediately as my eyes opened, I looked at the ceiling and asked myself why, in god's name, did I not order bacon wrapped dates. Ladies and germs, I'd subconsciously myself a terrific reason to go back... albeit with reservations.",0.9814,0.836,0.121,0.043,0.5470378387045054

We're Lettuce Entertain You frequent diner club members ( leye.com  -- you pay $25 to join, but get it back after your third use) because we're fans of several LEY joints (RJ Grunts, Mon Ami Gabi, etc, and I love Big Bowl's spicy peanut noodles).  As such, we get a newsletter, which is how I found out about the Pajama Brunch -- everyone dines in their pajamas, and if you're Frequent Diner Club members and present your card, you get GIFT CERTIFICATES WORTH THE VALUE OF YOUR MEAL(sans tax).  Yes, it's true.  I shout because I still cannot believe it.  We had a $85 meal (including bloody marys and coffee) and got $80 in gift certificates on the way out.  And we did it all in our PJs. Marketing-wise it's brilliant: Gets LEY-FDC members to get in on the first day of the year and start accruing more points, plus the gift certificates encourage you to come back (perhaps with friends, since you already know part of your meal is subsidized).  My only worry was that we'd be in the PJ-minority, and that 'civilians' would be dining with us.  WRONG.  Everybody, and I do mean EVERYBODY (including the employees) were in pajamas.  Hilarious.  It also makes it perfectly acceptable to people-watch, because we're all in on the joke.  I even ran into (PJ-clad) people I knew there -- turns out this is an annual event, and people look forward to it all year!

Waitstaff is quite friendly, though the hostesses are sometimes a bit snooty, and the place is always loud and boisterous without being too irritating. The tapas here are varied and great. My personal favorite is the garlic potato salad, a traditional dish, that's packed with flavors of garlic, chives, and dill. The beef tenderloin with horseradish was perfectly cooked and the horseradish sauce was fresh and strong. And I really dug the chorizo plate for something a little less flashy. If there's one thing that I was unimpressed with, it was the paella, strangely enough. I'm a stickler for a good paella, and compared with the tapas, it seemed mediocre. They offer three different kinds, however, so maybe it was just the one we tried. I would be remiss, of course, to speak of Ba Ba Reeba without mentioning their extensive selection of sangria.

First of all, a one and a half hour wait?  I know, I know, Saturday night, but it was nearly nine pm when we got there, and they were still packed to the gills, which brings me to my second issue...They were packed to the gills with dressed up Lincoln Parkers.  Is it really necessary to wear four inch heels and white halter dresses?  This is a chain, after all.  Am I really so far out of the ""scene"" here in Jefferson Park that I don't think I should have to dress up for a casual dinner, and I don't think that hundreds of people go out to eat at 9:00 pm?  Or is this some weird anomaly to the pretentious Lincoln Park crowd? Okay, on to the food.  Stuffed Mushrooms, fantastic.  Rioja Braised Short Rib with Manchego Mashed Potatoes, UNBELIEVABLE!  Platter of Spanish Cured meats and cheese with Tomato Bread, pretty great, but I couldn't stop thinking that perhaps a restaurant that wasn't a chain would have done this even better. Also the pork kabob with spicy potatoes was overdone and rather tasteless, a huge disappointment since this was my fave on my first visit,  Overall, I think this shows that the food is largely hit or miss. Now the wine.  I expect that a Spanish restaurant should have all good wine on their list, but I tried a couple different kinds on my first visit that I wasn't too thrilled with, so this time I stuck to the sangria, which was kind of weak-flavored.  At least it was refreshing and not overly sweet, and it did manage to give me a little kick.",0.991,0.777,0.163,0.061,0.5436877076411959

I worked here, like, 10 years ago so it could be said that I'm a little biased, but Ba Ba Reeba has ALWAYS been my favorite tapas place in the city.  I've tried 'em all at some point or another and always felt like coming back here was coming home to what the tapas experience should be. My husband and I went back recently and, while it was still really good, I had to shave off a star because it was disappointing in the following ways: 1.  WHERE'S MY FLAMENCO MUSIC?!?!  WHERE'S MY GYPSY KINGS TO GO WITH MY TAPAS?!?!  I mean, I KNOW that this is a favorite place for the L.P. trixie-set to fuel-up before a night at the clubs but bass-heavy dance-club tunes do NOT go well with a lovely Marces de Caceras rioja. 2.  What happened to the cumin-mayo on the Pincho de Pollo?  Dude, that was the BEST PART!  I used to eat that stuff on bread at the beginning of my shift and it was heaven. 3.  No Lubina con Rumescu?  That was, seriously, one the best dishes there and I was jonesin' hard for it. This place has always been crowded on Friday and Saturday nights, and this Friday night was certainly no exception.  The wait for a table at 7:30 without a reservation was over an hour.  We ended up getting a couple of seats at the bar and eating there, which was comfortable enough.  The bar staff now mostly consists of guys that used to be bussers in my day - which is a good thing.  They know their stuff, they're very courteous and attentive and their presence there makes much more sense to the feel of the place than mine ever did behind the bar.  It's also good to see that they promote from within. Their wines-by-the-glass list has expanded while their Sherry and cordial list has shrunk.  One of the fun things about chatting with the bartenders here in the past was having the opportunity to learn about Spanish wines and spirits.  They still have at least one offering in each category of sherry so I think you might be able to talk them into offering you a flight...on a weeknight. Their food menu has expanded a little, too.  Despite the fact that some of my old favorites are gone, I look forward to trying their new offerings in the future and I still think they have the best tapas in town. ----------------------------------------------------------- UPDATE 10/7/07 As of September 1st of this year, Cafe BabaReeba is now entirely smoke-free!",0.9981,0.781,0.19,0.029,0.48650749656847214

2006-06-06,5.0,"I cannot honestly say that I've ever had a bad experience at this tapas restaurant.  The first night I met my boyfriend's parents, while his dad & he went to the Cubs game, I took his mom to Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba.  I figured it'd be a good spot to order as many little items as we'd like & we could bond over shared plates & sangria pitchers (yes, plural ... she ordered the second!). Granted, a lot had to do with how cool his mom is, but we had a blast - staying there for the entire duration of the Cubs game. My only warning would be to watch out if you're with a large group of friends ... I've been here with big groups & even though I came after dinner & only had one drink, they tried to tell me that we were splitting the tab evenly amongst everyone who was there at bill time.  But that's not the restaurant's fault.  Just as a precaution ... if you're short on change like me or if your friends just have a penchant for ordering a ton & then saying, ""Oh yeah, let's divide it amongst all of us!"" - watch out. Edit:  Well, the bf is gone, but it was still a great place to take his mom.  Also, in related news ... a great place for a first date!  In fact, I'm going to up my review to a solid 5 stars simply because our waiter was freaking awesome.  Very attentive without being too hover-y & even comped us 2 desserts, which was really cool.

We started off with a cold tapas dish of the roasted eggplant with goat cheese. Next we had the jalapeno shrimp. This dish was really good! The shrimps were butterflied with cheese in the middle and then deep fried in a jalapeno cornmeal batter. Once you took a bite, the cheese just oozes onto your mouth. Next we had this pork kebab. The meat itself was good, but the presentation was amazing. The actually kebab was hanging on this ""lantern"" like fixture. It was SO cool... To go along with the meat, we ordered the spicy potatoes with tomato aioli. This was my favorite dish! Once I took a bite, I couldn't stop. They tasted like curly fries!!! SO good...I loved the how it was so spicy!  I could have ate the potatoes all by itself!!! Dessert was the fun part! These were also served tapas style. We had the coconut bread pudding and the bananas flambe. Both were equally delicious...
