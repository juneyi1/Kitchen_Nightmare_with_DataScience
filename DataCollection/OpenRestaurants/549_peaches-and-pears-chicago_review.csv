2017-04-07,2.0,"Been coming here since the it was called ""New Dynasty"" back in the 1990's. The neighborhood, riddled with pizza joints, taquerias, and fatfood chains, NEEDS a place like this - A family restaurant such as this, has the niche of variety and home-cooked (almost) meals... This place should be making a killing, but due to a lack of consistency and poor ingredient quality, I find myself returning less and less.  Our recent and most obvious experience with inconsistency: Wife orders the pickle soup, stuffed cabbage rolls and dumplings... They were delicious. The pickle soup was flavorful with plenty of dill and pickles! The finger dumplings reminded me of real Polish food and the stuff cabbage were like mom used to make. Two weeks later, I thought I would repeat my wife's meal... I ordered the pickle soup - Bland and no dill in the soup - It had pickle pieces but tasted like cream of chicken. My stuffed cabbage rolls had beef gravy on them instead of a tomato based sauce. My finger dumplings were nothing like the ones my wife had just two weeks prior. No butter, no bread crumbs and no flavor... Just plain old bland. This happens too much here.  I want to like this place but you're essentially rolling the dice as to what you will get. I have also experienced meals coming out that are missing key components. When I ask our waiter, where are my mushrooms and he says they are all out, should he not have informed me they were out of mushrooms before making my order? Don't play something off on me like I will just accept what you have versus what the menu states. This place is no where near what was last time you visited. It may be better; It may be worse. Watch out for the canned vegetables, they are pretty damn gross. I don't know how to help this place. Start stocking the ingredients you need. Find a cook who can follow your recipes so that dishes are consistent. Don't skimp or be cheap on ingredients. Omitting something from a recipe because you ran out affects the outcome and that in-turn disrupts consistency. I don't know when I'll be back - Maybe the next time I feel like gambling, we'll just head to Peaches and Pears for dinner.",0.6044,0.799,0.101,0.099,0.4045104405398523

2016-12-28,3.0,"At best it's a good neighborhood spot and I will come again. The drawbacks: canned veggies and that doesn't say much for the cuisine. I mean, I can eat the comfort food and be happy, but I can't eat the canned (obvious) vegetables and be happy with a higher star review. The waitress was actually really nice and explained how the after 5 crew will show you an awesome buffet of goodies as far as desserts are concerned. But only after a certain time so you have to check back. Now I had the rice pudding to go and I was really surprised at how rich it was and that made me smile. The waitress put a little extra whip cream and it gave it that extra special oomph! I have to admit, I do want to like the place with more stars, but I think I need to return again so that I can get a better impression. I did get a soup and sandwich and I must say that the soup was really good, the waitress explained to me that the soup is something they do pride themselves in and rightfully so. So if you want a soup and sandwich I would definitely try them out, not sure about the rest of the food but again, like I said, my mom had chicken and veggies and the veggies were definitely canned, that alone is not good so maybe they need to change it up and provide maybe a real veggie vs one that comes from tin. Then I think we can up the star system. My overall rating and review? At best, OK, nothing more and nothing less. Sorry, but I have to keep it real when it comes to food. The place is antiquated but that adds a little to the vibe of the spot.

The meal was very filling and tasty....just the right temperature and flavorful (for those who are wondering, the pickle soup was great....just the right amount of tartness and it tasted like a creamy soup).  Then for dessert he came out with a couple of kolaczky which was a nice ending to a great meal.  Add to that a bottomless cup of coffee and it made for a great late lunch/early dinner on a cold wintry day.

I had high hopes since this place was pretty busy, very clean and inviting, standard Greek diner type look. I was ecstatic that they offer so many skillet options that come with pancakes, because I don't like to choose between sweet and savory for breakfast. I ordered the veggie skillet and added sausage (I'm a carnivore who loves broccoli, ok?) With poached eggs and pancakes.  I understand poached eggs are difficult,  but most places can manage. My eggs came out looking like they'd had much better days (I'll spare you the more graphic metaphor, for your sake) The sausage is NOT breakfast sausage. It's more like a dinner sausage. Hard to explain but it just isn't what I want or expect in a breakfast sausage.  The pancakes were stone cold and when I informed the waitress,  she simply took them back to be microwaved. Hooray, now they're warm but rubbery!  Yuck.  I didn't bother sending them back a second time, God knows what I'd get if I did. So I just sucked it up and missed out on the ""sweet"" portion of my breakfast. The price points were pleasing, less than $8 with water (drinks are a standard price of ridiculous at a restaurant) The service was nothing great,  not terribly friendly and rather short, fast but had to flag them down when I needed something.  Also, the weirdest thing is that the floor is kind of weak where we were sitting by the serving station and every time a server or bus boy walked by, we could feel the pounding of their footsteps vibrate through out seat which was highly annoying.

2011-12-14,2.0,"The old woman who greeted me at the door was not nappy to see me.  I ask you - who doesn't want a fat guy in their restaurant. My very physique promises a good tab. She wanted to force me into a booth.  She - grudgingly - got me to a small table behind the Christmas tree - away from all signs of civilized life.    The first waitress looked at me and passed me on to the second waitress. Big mistake. I am a big tipper. The second waitress - somewhat harried - apparently the first waitress has first right of refusal and was letting the second waitress take all the undesirable tables. She - the second waitress - came by and was quick and sweet and on the money. She brought me water and took my order.  Now this place has signs all over the building boasting of the best soup in Chicago. The main reason I came in was the soup. I love soup. I drive by this place a few times a week and was intrigued. Best soup in Chicago? I'll be the judge of that. I ordered the Piergois which came with a bowl of soup. I opted for the minestrone. I have had better soup by Progresso. If these folks think they serve the best soup in the city, they need to get out more. The beans were undercooked - the zucchini was over cooked and broth had as much spice as a cup of snow. The second waitress actually brought me some nice (extra) dinner rolls. (When you are my size - people just assume you want extra dinner rolls. I didn't eat any, but I appreciated the gesture.) She also brought me a bigger glass of water. The Pierogis were not good. They were crispy and dry and boring. They came with a smear of apple sauce and an envelope of sour cream. They had about as much flavor as a cup of sand. As I got up to leave - I told the second waitress that her tip would be in the card. I am not a big fan of doing that. Some restaurants charge the credit card fee to the waitresses - they take it out of the tip. The bill was around 8 bucks. The tip was almost 4 bucks. When the mean old lady saw that I was a tipper - she tried to make small talk. Yeah - right,. make me feel welcome as I am leaving. Like the faux-Italians in the moves say, ""forgetaboutit!""

It was still decorated beautifully for springtime and Easter, and the employees even assisted us with decorating for the baby shower, which a lot of restaurants don't do.  They have a great selection on the menu, fantastic food that is served in generous portions at reasonable prices, and wonderful employees.  Every employee we encountered was polite, friendly and efficient. As they were setting up tables, we were also putting up some decorations. The employees helped decorate and ""worked around us"" so nicely. We weren't expecting the restaurant to decorate, but they also had tasteful decorations on hand which really helped enhance the decorations we brought.  It is an understatement to call our server, Beata, fantastic. If there is anyone who goes above and beyond, it's her. Not only was she in total control of what she was doing, she managed to anticipate what we needed and was so friendly during our meal. We did not have to ask her for things such as refills or carry-out boxes. She knew what to bring and when we would need it.
