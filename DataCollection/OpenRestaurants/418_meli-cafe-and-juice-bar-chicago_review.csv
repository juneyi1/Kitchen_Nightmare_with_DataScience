When I got home I checked my Ritual account and indeed I had paid through the app. Since it was clear that I had paid twice, I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager. The manager asked me if I told the hostess I had already paid and I said yes. She then asked me, if I already paid, why did I give the hostess my credit card? Blame the customer, really? The manager then told me that there was nothing she could do about the double payment because they ""already closed out the order."" She never once offered a refund from the restaurant, which I am sure could have been done at that point. Shockingly poor customer service.",0.4515,0.879,0.063,0.058,0.3840277777777778

2017-04-04,3.0,"Good spot in Greektown for breakfast and lunch! Not recommended for a business lunch if you dine in; it's a relatively small place, and it can get quite loud and crowded. It's nice for a leisurely breakfast or lunch with friends.  I mostly stick to the lunch menu, and largely for carry our, which has consistently been good! They're fast, everything is always well-packed and hot when I arrive.  Their wraps are HUGE....they use a tortilla the size of a pitcher's mound, but it's a sizable portion for lunch (and then leftovers). I'm a fan of their no name wrap, which is more or less a club sandwich wrap. Ingredients are always fresh, and special requests to the order are never ignored.  Burgers and breakfast don't really hold up well with take out, and some of their hot sandwiches are a little hit or miss even when you dine in.  The avocado caprese wrap is also a favorite!! Another huge portion, and it comes with large slices of avocado, tomato, pesto and fresh mozzarella. It's plentiful, but not overly-filling. Sides-wise: their fries are really tasty! They're handcut, well-cooked and come with a tasty homemade ketchup. The pasta salad is ok. Their salads are also really good! The Meli salad is a simple, but filling salad...ingredients are always fresh. My personal favorite is the beet salad, and I add grilled chicken. It's served over arugula and with goat cheese and sliced beets. They don't skimp on the chicken, either!  All in all, good spot for takeout and a casual lunch.",0.9934,0.789,0.195,0.015,0.5896577380952381
2017-04-02,2.0,We had breakfast here this morning. It had such great reviews but I have to say our experience was a little disappointing.

I ordered the spicy flamenco omelet that was supposed to have cilantro but it was clearly parsley. And the jalapeño was in fact green pepper. How is that even possible? My friend ordered a turkey club and it didn't have any bacon on it. The service was awful. We would have said something to our waitress and let it be that. However, she did not check on us after our food arrived until after our food was finished and even then just took the plates away without saying a word. We waited for our bill and when it didn't arrive, we took the initiative of walking over to the register. The waitress met us there and upon checkout, did not say a single word.

2016-11-30,5.0,"Everything here is absolutely fantastic! I am from California, but Meli Cafe is pretty close to getting me to make the move. I was staying at a hotel down the street for about a week, and normally I'm one to explore and try different places, but once I had Meli's Cafe, I was hooked, went back for breakfast every single day. The food is delicious, and the quality of the ingredients is super fresh. They have juices, smoothies, and breakfast available at this location. Service: Impeccable. Every experience I had here, the host and servers were extremely polite, friendly, and fast, even on to-go orders. Venue: I felt like I was in a little cafe in France. The decor is so cute, and the restaurant is very clean and well kept. Ample seating for small parties and groups.  Food: AMAZING! I literally showed up at 6am opening to grab my one last meal for my flight home. Hash benedict- my favorite! Why have I not seen other places come up with this? Corned beef hash over an English muffin, topped with poached eggs covered in hollandaise sauce. The corned beef hash is cooked to perfection, not too mushy, or overly salty. Sauce is perfection. Order this, you won't regret it! Peanut butter banana crepes- The peanut butter is so creamy and smooth, each bite just melts in your mouth. Definitely a peanut butter overload though, this might be a good one to share. It is delicious. Spicy flamenco- Chicken chorizo, jalapeño, onions, tomato, avocado, cilantro, pepper jack cheese, sour cream. Seems like more of a Mexican style dish, but they do it right. A little on the spicy side, so be ready. Pancakes- Wow! Who knew something so simple could be so delicious. I think their secret is in the pure dark amber maple syrup, it is phenomenal. I only tried the basic pancakes, but I can't wait to try the others. Banana maple crunch smoothie- sooo good!

The eggs were perfectly fluffy and cooked just right.  Most of the negative reviews seem to be from people ordering vegetarian substitutes, so apparently, don't do that.

2016-10-27,3.0,"Let's get right to it: Meli is definitely a decent spot. Based on food alone I would probably give it 4 stars. A party of 4 of us went on a Sunday morning and collectively ate the Green Omelet (a tad bland), Salmon Benedict, Jalapeno Bowl, and I believe, the Down on the Farm Bowl. All were delicious, but the favorites were the Salmon and Jalapeno. The portions were very generous. I also had one of the fresh juices and it was phenomenal. Totally worth going back for the food alone! Other things that drove the score down were the long wait, which is a catch 22. If there's no wait at brunch time on a Sunday in a happening neighborhood, the place may not be worth going to. However, I think the staff needs to get better at estimating wait times. They told us 30 minutes, but more likely 20. It ended up being 50 minutes. Not a deal breaker, just an observation. The next not so positive thing was the service. Our server was fine, however, I'm not quite sure she understood us, as evidenced by some strange things that went on with our order. Also, we could barely hear one another because it was super loud, but she made no effort to lean in or speak louder, or anything of the sort. and ended up getting things wrong. She rarely smiled. In fact, the food runners, bussers and other staff rarely smiled either. Weird. I mean, I know they were busy and all, but still, shouldn't restaurant workers smile? All in all, the place is good and I would definitely go back again to try some of those scrumptious sounding specials on the Special's Board!",0.9386,0.749,0.148,0.103,0.4533359658359659

2016-06-13,4.0,"Again, the food here is great.  Awesome menu with tons of things to choose from, great vegetarian/vegan/gluten free options.   Went here over the weekend with a couple of friends, including one friend's baby.  The manager (?) was wonderful - nice, attentive, moved us to a table that would be more convenient for three women (including two pregnant women) and a baby in a high chair.  The baby knocked a spoon off the table and he was right there with another one - truly first-class service from him. The bus boys were great, attentive, and nice.  But the waitresses...Oy.  So maybe one was a waitress and one was an order runner?  I don't know.  They never introduced themselves, ""No, I'm X and I'll be your waitress,"" so I'm still confused.  Either way, they were inattentive at best, obviously not thrilled either the fact that there were people coming in at 1:30 p.m. or that there was a baby in the restaurant - not sure which. The eye rolling was evident, like dealing with an annoyed teenager.  When my friend received her food and realized it was wrong (she's ordered fruit with her omelet instead of potatoes - they brought her fries), the waitress (runner?) seemed completely annoyed, huffed, and took it back to the kitchen and then the waitress (who we'd ordered the food with) came out and brought my friend her new plate.   The busboys took care of our waters, but when the other drinks we'd had ran out (fancy coffee drink and orange juice), we were never asked if we wanted more or something else by our waitress. Then, while two of the three of us are still eating the waitress (runner?) who brought us our food walked over and said ""Are you ready for the check?""  No, ""Is there anything else I can get you?"" etc. We were mid-conversation, so we probably all seemed a little confused, but said we were and grabbed our wallets.  I asked if we could split it three ways she said they could only put it on two cards...ok, I get it (not totally unheard of in the industry).  Then we waited...and waited...for her to come back an take the cards.  She dropped off the receipts to be signed without a ""Thank you"" or anything like that.  I get that we were finishing up at about 2:45 and the restaurant closed at 3, but we were nearly done and not lingering, and we weren't the last ones in the restaurant.

All the fresh squeezed juices are amazing and the smoothies can be a meal in itself. On New Year's Day I had a bad experience where all the orders were mixed up and a vegetarian omelette had chicken. But management came and apologized for the mistake and comped the food. Overall I think this is some of the best brunch food in Chicago! Try the breakfast tacos.

They have a good variety of creative breakfast items giving enough options to meet everyone's variant food preferences. For that reason,looking  at their menu, I felt that I should order something different/unusual than the regular breakfast menu items like omelette or pancakes. I ordered ""black pepper bacon hash"" from their ""Today's special"" section. Bed of shredded crispy potato hash brown, bacon, green peppers, onions, red pepper, topped with melted cheese and covered with 2 over easy eggs(any style eggs, I choose over easy), served with toast( choose Rye) butter, fresh real pineapple jelly. So darn delicious.  All my friends loved whatever they ordered. They also have some good smoothies and coffee . Loved their green machine and mango smoothies. Service was good too.

They don't take reservations and if you go there on a peak time you have to be prepared to wait, there isn't much waiting space inside so you can be stuck in bad weather outside. It is worth the wait however. This is my second time here and both times the food was excellent. First of all and this is important to me, they keep the coffee flowing which I appreciate. This time I ordered a salsa crepe. I rarely order crepes for breakfast because too many places only have sweet crepes but this has savory and I went with the mexican themed. It had a chicken chorizo which was different but very good. There was also avocado and tomoto and it was very well cooked. The server was friendly and efficient. The only reason it wasn't five stars was because the inside was rather small and kind of crowded. However if it wasn't the wait would have been over an hour.

I ordered the breakfast sampler which includes 2 pancakes eggs bacon and hash browns. The eggs were scrambled soft the way I like them. The bacon was crispy and the hash browns were flavorful.

Last week I went with the oh-so-hearty breakfast tacos served with chicken chorizo, avocado, cheese, pico, and even secret sauce. It was such a magical moment when my waitress graced me with my solid b-fast choice. My dining partners and I also couldn't resist the pancake section so we chose the maple pecan pancakes. WHOA....warm pecans and bananas folded right into the pancakes all topped with whipped cream and maple butter. Needless to say the rest of the day was pretty useless after devouring these two insane dishes.  The service is fast, friendly, and muy professional.

One of us ordered a Pepsi, small bottle, no refills. All of this added up to over 58.00 (50.83 plus 8 tip). Service was ok.  My point is that this price you can eat a lot better.

To drink, just coffee. The portions are large and I've always left with a small container.  The second visit, which was just a couple days ago I ordered the amazing French toast. It was so good I had to yelp about it. It was topped with fresh vanilla whipped cream and a delicious sauce.  Such a good combo. They serve you a syrup in a shot glass and a small cup of butter. You don't really need any of it for the brioche French toast unless your sweet tooth is off the chain. Even the berries (blackberries, strawberries and blueberry) were sweet.

2015-02-20,2.0,"Meli Cafe was decent, but it's definitely nothing special. I went there for brunch last week. The ambiance is very nice and cozy, and the staff was friendly. However, the food is overpriced for what you get. I was in a breakfast mood, so I ordered a plain waffle and a side order of bacon. The waffle was your ordinary waffle, but here's the kicker: you only get a shot-sized cup of syrup to go with it! I happen to use more than a drop of syrup when I eat waffles, and this time was no exception. I asked the waitress for a refill, and she said it would cost an extra $1.50 for another ""cup"" of it. For syrup!? You can go to Jewel and buy a whole jug of syrup for a little more than that! (By the way, and in case you are wondering, the syrup tasted like ordinary syrup). Needless to say, I told the lady ""no thank you"" and ate the remainder of my waffle dry. Now, let's turn to the bacon. I love bacon. At most breakfast places in Chicago, side orders of bacon come with three slices and cost a few bucks. At Meli's, a side order of bacon is $4.00. Being a native Chicagoan, I assumed I'd get three slices for that amount of money. What did I get? Two. Two measly slices of bacon for $4.00. You can go to Chinatown and buy a whole entree for that amount. (I admit, though, that the bacon was good). If you're one of those people who don't mind spending large amounts of money for average-tasting food but a pleasant ambiance, Meli's is the place for you. If you're anything like me and prefer to leave a meal with a full stomach and feeling that your money was well spent, find another breakfast place.

2014-11-10,2.0,"Disclaimer: Despite only giving this place 2 starts, I will be back...it's still the best breakfast place from UIC's campus in my opinion, although unfortunately that isn't saying much. I've now been to Meli's a few times throughout the semester, and I want to like this place so much...it's a great, convenient location from UIC's campus and they serve breakfast.  I am a firm believer that you should take yourself out to breakfast on occasion, because you're worth it! The problem: this place is definitely not for students.  I get it, it's downtown, so of course it's going to be expensive.  But I always end up spending $20 on breakfast after tip.  And I never even get the amazing looking juice or smoothies!  Actually...I should probably just start getting the smoothies, because after trying 3 different menu items, I'm just not that impressed with the food.  Today was bad enough to spur a Yelp review.  I ordered the tofu scramble.  The name scramble implies that the tofu would be scrambled up.  It was not. It was flavorless little cubes without any sauce and steamed veggies. Tofu scrambles have the potential to convince a non-vegetarian that tofu DOES in fact have awesome potential...but not when it's flavorless little tofu cubes.  I had previously gotten one of the bowls and substituted the veggie grain patties in for the meat.  Again, I think it's awesome that they have an easily substitute veggie option, but it just wasn't very good. I think the other thing I got there was a caprese wrap...I think it was fine, although clearly not very memorable. Good things about Meli's:  - The servings are really big. You could easily split most things or take leftovers home/to the office.  - They DO offer a ton of vegetarian options, although I haven't cared for them.  - The smoothies look seriously awesome  - They let me hang out and sip on coffee for a long time, so I still enjoy it enough to keep coming back.  - The service is always very good there.  I actually feel bad giving a bad review because my waitress was so sweet today.   Overall, a decent breakfast place if you're not watching your money and you're not looking for the best vegetarian breakfast of your life.",0.9712,0.783,0.139,0.078,0.5729069767441861

We ended up trying the Japaleno breakfast bowl, chocolate chip pancakes, and En Fuego burger with fries. The food was all very fresh and delicious! In the Jalapeno breakfast bowl, there was a surplus of jalapenos that made the dish a little too spicy even for a jalapeno lover. They use fresh jalapenos too so the heat is a huge kick! The creaminess of the egg yolk and the advocado help tame the dish thankfully.The dish is a very generous portion! The chocolate chip pancakes were nice and soft. The best part was probably the fresh whipped cream! It was super rich and so tasty! The En Fuego burger caught my eye because of the ghost pepper cheese! I've heard of it as being super spicy but had never tried it before so I took a chance. It's one of the most solid and tasty burgers I've ever had! The chipotle aioli helped bring out the flavor and tie the whole burger together! It had a kick but not too much.

Excellent combination of texture and flavor. It was a huge serving that came with baby red potatoes, so I only able to finish one muffin. Also tried my cousin's Mixed Berry french toast. Delicious but too sweet for me even without maple syrup, two bites is good enough for me. The menu also included a selection of juices and smoothies! However I only ordered a small orange juice because I knew I would have gotten too full. Their healthy smoothies contain combinations I would like, though, and I would have gotten one to go if I weren't going to be flying out after the meal.

Served in addition to the omelet (which was like a 12-egg omelet, by the way) were the baby red potatoes and my choice of toast (English muffin, because why don't they serve sourdough?). The jam and honey butter that they serve with the toast is OMGWOAHSOGOOD. Get toast.

2014-06-26,4.0,"There is something about 'une petite tasse à café' that gets me every time. Steaming coffee served in a properly modest cup as opposed to an oversized mug or a flimsypaper cup makes me feel like I am in the right place and spending my time as I should. Good coffee and great wine can have that effect on me. I am happy to report that the house brew at Meli's was delicious, a medium roast perfected for wake-me-ups. The freshly squeezed orange was also flavourful, but mine wasn't chilled.  I ordered the cafe eggs benedict, made with pork belly, tomato, spinach and your classic hollandaise sauce, and paired with baby red potatoes. I got what I asked for- thick slabs of meaty pork and soft diced potatoes sprinkled with fresh parsley. My eggs were poached correctly and I didn't need the usual garnishes (ketchup, mayo, whatever) to boost taste in any way. The order came quickly and the portion was huge (I did not finish it). But I will say the potatoes were slightly over-salted and I prefer my english muffin more toasted, but that is to taste in both cases.  My waitress disappeared on me so I didn't get any ""check-ups"" or a much needed coffee refill until much later into my meal. I could see her chatting it up with the bartenders so this was not due to business. Her other patrons also noticed. Overall I wouldn't hesitate to give this establishment a 4.5 or 5 stars if it wasn't for the warm OJ, a soggy muffin and a friendly but flighty waitress. See also my tip below for another oversight on management's part.  It's also important to note the place is not cheap. $15 for eggs benny is a bit much. But the portions were more than fair.  I RECOMMEND: The cafe eggs benedict for a breakfast crave or the kale chicken caesar wrap if you're on the lunch end of the brunch spectrum.  EXTRA TIP:  NO WI-FI access for customers, although there is clearly Meli wi-fi in the building. (Major FAIL in this day and age, and not considerate of the travelling/working diner). I came to Meli for a leisurely breakfast but had to rush and make my way back to the Starbucks around the corner for the work portion of my lunch break. Unfortunate. I liked the Meli ambiance.  ALSO NOTE- It gets busy around 12:30-1:30 even on a weekday. The sandwiches make for a good lunch so no surprise there.",0.9783,0.823,0.122,0.055,0.48443452380952373

Juice was very good and so different. Definitely would do that again but so more others to try as well.

2014-02-01,3.0,"Since this breakfast place is right around the corner of my friend's place in the city, we decided to come here for our morning meal.  I had the Honey Smoked Salmon benedict, which was honey smoked salmon, poached eggs, served with Dill Hollandaise on an English muffin.  The salmon were in bits and pieces and not fresh.  My friend ordered the Portobello benedict, which was grilled Portobello mushrooms, poached eggs, and Hollandaise on an English muffin.  This was quite a huge piece of the mushroom, but not seasoned.  We had the Stuffed Strawberry French Toast to share, which were two slices of challah held together by a layer of Mascarpone swirled with strawberries, and topped with strawberries on top.  It is supposedly dipped into their vanilla bean custard.  This was quite heavenly since it wasn't overly sweet, and the drizzle of the syrup they bring out prior to serving you added quite a nice touch.  We also shared the Meli's Honey Cakes, which is a cornmeal-based pancake batter infused with honey.  Is is also drizzled with warm honey and adding the syrup also makes it quite tasty - a good pancake, I must say.  Of course since this place is also a juice bar, we ordered the Mango, Orange, Kiwi with honey and the Orange/Banana/Strawberry w/honey.  The first one was quite citrus-y and very sour - the honey didn't help (that was set on the bottom, and it was quite a workout stirring it all out); the latter was quite nice - sweet, and the banana flavor comes through nicely.  Both were smooth. The only downside is that the hostesses, Coralita and Patty, are not so nice to their guests. :( +Stuffed Strawberry French Toast +Meli's Honey Cakes +Orange/Banana/Strawberry with honey juice +rude hostesses (Coralita & Patty) T____T",0.9711,0.822,0.119,0.058,0.5099619047619047
2014-01-30,2.0,"Meli Cafe is a hotel restaurant in the stylings of the days prior to the designer-chef-and-boutique-restaurant standard of hotel dining arrived. What that means is that it's overall kind of mediocre: the food is kind of bad, the service is kind of awkward, and the prices are kind of high. On the business end, that's okay since you have a captive audience that you don't need to rely upon for repeat business, and as a customer Meli has saved you from braving the Great Chicago Wilderness of the south loop (or beyond). And if you live here or care about what you eat? Meli is a kind-of-Greek kind-of fine dining restaurant, combining the cost-saving measures of a greasy spoon with the price and decor of a much nicer restaurant. For example: beef barley soup is the soup of the day. Not that beef barley soup isn't good, but why have it as a special? The three page menu is two pages two long, and entree items see some repetition. Most dishes have pasta randomly thrown into their description, but not their ""title."" Braised short rib sounds good, but they snuck some spaghetti in there, for example.  I had the twin petite fillets, which tasted as though they'd been re-frozen: the visual texture was like a hockey puck, without identifiable fibers, and it seemed to disintegrate into a gritty sand-like consistency in my mouth. the foie gras mentioned in the description was a tiny peppercorn-like nub on top of each steak, barely worth mentioning. My fiance ordered the mussels and the roasted beet salad together as her entree; the mussels were coated in a messily detonated tomato, requiring the pale, overly steamed tomato flesh be scooped out of each shell in order to reach the meat.  These weren't served with a dish for the shells, a finger bowl, a small wet towel to dab with your fingers or anything else you might normally serve with mussels; similar to this, our hot tea was also missing such niceties as spoons for stirring or milk. Why did we get tea? The prior restaurant had a bar, and Meli kept that in their design of the restaurant, except it's a juice bar, no alcohol. The cabinets that used to have beer now have soda. It's kind of a weird thing to see, but also suggests that breakfast or lunch is probably more Meli's speed. They do have a desert case with a variety of pastries, and for some reason these are not on the desert menu. This lead to an awkward exchange with our server as we tried to convey our order for the mille fleur in the case.",0.7158,0.898,0.06,0.042,0.520638528138528

There was a line out the door, so we put our names in and the hostess let us know the wait time and gave us a pager, pretty typical. But then she  apologized for the lack of room inside to wait and directed us to the cafe next door where we could wait inside (which in winter is a big deal) and enjoy complimentary coffee, tea, juice or water and our pager would still register when ready.

2013-09-15,3.0,"I hate to have to write a mediocre review about this place, but unfortunately I must. This is the second time I've been here and have generally felt the same each time. The place is cute, but the tables are pretty crowded, which can sometimes be distracting the the meal as the noise level rises and people bang, squeeze, and otherwise try to maneuver through the tables. This also makes bussing the tables difficult, and thus you end up with dirty dishes cluttering up the table when you really have little room to begin with - it doesn't help that the plates are on the large side. The other problem I have with this place is the service. It really is just average. Today we ordered food to that should have been arranged in courses: soup, followed by our entrees, then finished off with a shot of wheat grass. However, our wheat grass shots were served immediately (on hot plates, no less), so in order to get the freshest benefit, we were basically forced to drink them right away. Didn't go too well with coffee, I must say. After that, our server returned to the table to ask what we order again because she forgot. Hey, how about writing it down? Then all of our food came out at once instead of our soups first. As stated before, the tables are not very large, but the plates are, so we had a very crowded table along with the empty wheat grass dish ware that the server neglected to remove (luckily there was only 3 of us at a 4-top or we would have had our dishes in our laps).  Finally, at the end of the meal, the server hovered over us while we were paying, then snatched the check holder as soon as I closed it after signing it!  This is the kind of service I expect at a cheap diner, not a place that charges $17 for a salmon Benedict.  This same type of service was experienced the last time I had brunched here as well. So needless to say, some of the waitstaff needs a little education in service etiquette. Now, all of that being said, the food here is really fantastic.  They have an excellent menu with quite a breadth of options and everything was delicious.  The price points have a nice range and they do have quite an impressive offering of juices, smoothies, etc. from their juice bar.  I will come back here to eat from time to time, but I have other brunch spots I favor because they provide a better overall experience.",0.908,0.82,0.097,0.083,0.5718409985076651

When we asked for another table, the guy at the hostess desk practically cursed at us. After waiting for over a half an hour for a table, we nonetheless walked out. I won't spend my money anywhere that treats its customers so disrespectfully. As they've gotten more popular, their attitude has become arrogant - as thought the line of people waiting outside means they don't have to provide good customer service. This used to be a favorite spot. No more. Don't bother with this place, unless you like being treated rudely.",-0.8728,0.731,0.104,0.165,0.5033333333333333

It's because the food is THAT good.  If you want to avoid any lines, turn brunch into breakfast and get there before 9 am.  You will get seated much sooner.",0.8834,0.826,0.135,0.04,0.4618881118881119
2013-06-25,5.0,"It's the butter that sets Meli apart. I first noticed this fact when they brought some breakfast breads, butter and jellies to our table to accompany our coffee.  I actually glared at the teensy little ramekins of butter they provided, and wondered why they were being so stingy.  One taste made the reason clear, and coincidentally made me squirrel one of those little ramekins away for my own private use. I don't know where they're sourcing the butter they use, but I can guarantee you, it's not coming from the grocery store, or even the wholesaler.  This was probably the best sweet cream butter I've ever tasted, and HAD to have come fresh from the farm.  If at this point you're rolling your eyes and dismissing me as some sort of butter freak, well...you might be right, but you also don't know just how good butter can be.  Get yourself to Meli immediately to start your education. After you've consumed more bread and butter than any one person should, turn your attention (as I did) to one of their omelettes.  Even after tasting the butter spread over bread, I kept wondering to myself why my omelette tasted so darn good!  Yes, the fillings were fresh and the eggs were fresh, but there was something else that just made me keep eating that omelette well past the point of being full (because, let me tell you, that was a BIG omelette!).  About halfway through, I realized that it had been cooked in that same fresh butter that had been served on the table.  What an amazing difference that made. So yeah.  Meli is definitely worth your time.  The fact that I give it five stars and it's about as pretentious a place as you can find should be an indication of just how good the food is.",0.9947,0.809,0.172,0.019,0.468095238095238

2013-05-11,1.0,"Don't listen to the good reviews!!! Those people must like being treated poorly and getting over-charged. The food at Meli is VERY over-priced. The management and staff are worse than rude, the place is uncomfortably cramped, and they are definitely NOT kid friendly. We arrived with a group of eight (four adults, four kids) for breakfast, and were immediately treated to a very bad attitude from one of the young women working the front desk. She had an angry look on her face and spoke to us as though she would rather we leave. I joked with her a bit to lighten the mood, but she only became more agitated. We were told it would be a half-hour wait, and we were given a big square pager. After over an hour, the pager went off and we returned to the desk. The angry young woman asked if our whole party was there, and we told her they were. A few minutes later, she asked again. Then again. Finally, we told her we would like to sit down, since the kids were hungry and getting antsy, and she flew into a rage. She yelled at us, red faced, and insisted we would have to wait because she was busy.  I asked to see the manager, and she said she was the manager. We asked to see the owner, and she said she was the owner. I asked her for her card, and she gave us a card for Nick Karabelas and Yiannis Theoharis. Apparently these two men are the managers or owners, and not the hostess at the front desk. Finally, the angry hostess took us to a table. Several minutes later, an obese, sweaty, older man in an ill-fitting suit comes to our table and yells at our party for upsetting his hostess. SERIOUSLY! He said his name was Nick (presumably Mr. Karabelas from the business card). After reading some other reviews, apparently Nick has a bad habit of yelling at his customers. If he wasn't so ridiculously comical, we would have been more upset. He didn't ask us for our side of the story, didn't care what we had to say, and was just as nasty as the hostess. If we didn't have four starving kids, having already waited over an hour, we would have left. Instead, we toughed it out and stayed to eat. When we finally received our food, we examined it thoroughly to be sure it had not been tainted. It tasted ok, but it was definitely not worth the price we paid. After all the yelling, I can't even remember what we had. Seriously, you can get better food for less money (and with *way* better attitudes) at Stax on Taylor or Hashbrowns on Maxwell. Don't waste your time, energy, or money at Meli. And if you choose to do so, watch out for *Nick Karabelas*!!! The whole episode was sad and hilarious. These people were like bad caricatures of the worst stereotypes of surly, ill-mannered Euro-trash. We were embarrassed for them, since they plainly didn't know better.

2013-04-24,1.0,"WARNING: Note: This is being written from the perspective of a former ""high-end"" chef. My husband and I got rotten potatoes served to us, and even after we pointed out the potatoes were bad, we continued to see potatoes being served to customers. I have been here many times before and this is the first time that I've had a bad experience, but the way that they handled everything was just plain wrong.   First, stop serving the potatoes to everyone, just 86 them. There is no way of telling if all the pre-cut potatoes, that are sitting in a bucket of water, are good or not. Why risk the health of your customer?   Second, when you serve rotten food to a customer, that customer's food is on the house. It doesn't matter if you bring them something different off the menu that has no potatoes, you don't turn around and charge them for that new dish, especially if they have to wait 15 minutes to get an omelet. Having made thousands of omelets, I know that it doesn't take 15 mins to get one out. (For anyone thinking, hey, they might have been busy and it does take time to cook an omelet. When food is sent back because of a major mistake in the kitchen, that customer's order gets pushed to the front of the line. But they weren't busy.) Even though they have really good food, over priced, but still good, I just can't bring myself to give my money to a place that doesn't care that they are serving rotten food to it's customers. They weren't even overly concerned. The next time that they serve rotten food, and it will happen, let's hope that the only thing that happens is another bad review and a call to the Health Department.",-0.9846,0.799,0.052,0.149,0.4717434081070444

2013-03-13,5.0,"Meli Café doesn't look like much from outside--several of the windows are painted over at the corner, so you can't see in--but it turned out to be a really pleasant spot for breakfast this morning.  The place isn't huge, but there are a LOT of waitresses on hand, so the service is pretty phenomenal.  I think at 10:00 AM on a Wednesday, my waitress had only my table to deal with, so I was never without coffee refills.  (I say ""waitress"" as I didn't see a single male waiter among them, though there were a few male bussers.) Overall, the place is attractive, with many subtle luxe touches.  No tablecloths cover the polished wooden tables, but crisply starched ironed white linen napkins and heavy substantial cutlery are provided, making this feel a bit more refined than your average breakfast spot. The menu was expansive: there are many versions of French toast or egg dishes to be had, as well as crepes, waffles and various vegan or gluten free items.  They make their own marmalades from organic fruit in house.  There's even a whole page devoted to freshly squeezed juice blends and smoothies.  I sat next to the juicing station and the motorized juicers were occasionally LOUD, like sitting on an airport tarmac with the jet planes revving, so if you're planning a quiet conversation over breakfast you may want to put some distance between you and the machinery. I had a really good breakfast of ""baked oatmeal"" ($7).  This was a heart-healthy bowl of well-made porridge, containing sliced bananas and yellow sultanas.  The only part of the dish that wasn't completely healthy was the thick crust of brown sugar over the top, caramelized under a broiler, forming a sweet hard topping to the cereal, much like a crème brûlée.  But man, was it ever good!  A large crescent of fresh cantaloupe was a welcome addition, as was the tall glass of freshly squeezed orange juice ($4.50 for large) and the many cups I drank of excellent Lavazza coffee ($2.65). Total cost was about $14.50 plus tip, which puts Meli in the price range of a hotel breakfast rather than corner diner.  But with all the little touches and the evident freshness and tastiness of the food, it's well worthwhile for the occasional treat.",0.9947,0.805,0.157,0.038,0.4842261904761905

The food lived up to its hype which I read about on Yelp.  This is why I gave it at least 3 stars.  I ordered the turkey breakfast sandwich on wheat toast.  It came with red potatoes and a melon wedge.  The portions were HUGE, so I felt the $9.50 price tag was justified.  The cheddar cheese in the sandwich was delicious, and I loved my potatoes.  Perfect seasonings with chopped onions. However, in looking over the rest of the menu, it's a little pricey for breakfast food.  My friend ordered a small orange juice, which contained maybe 5 ounces, and it cost $3.  Side items are extremely expensive.     Besides the pricey menu, there are two other reasons I couldn't give it 5 stars.  One: I was seated looking directly into the sun, and couldn't move to avoid it.  When we asked an employee to lower their window blinds (which were right in front of us), his response was, ""We can't do that.""  What?!?!?!?!  Second, they are weird about paying checks with more than one form of payment.  There were three of us in our party, and before we could ask to have three separate checks, we were given just one.  Two of us wanted to pay with credit card and one with cash, but the waitress (in her heavy Eastern European accent) told us the restaurant couldn't do that.  We had to put two orders on one card and the third on another, and that's it.  Very strange and seems odd such a bustling business has such cumbersome rules.",0.9331,0.88,0.088,0.032,0.5127630805408584
2013-02-25,3.0,"This used to be my all-time favorite restaurant, and would take any out-of-towners here for brunch. I used to say this was my favorite place for breakfast food. However, on a recent visit, I noticed a few changes, which really changed my opinion of them. We waited about 20 minutes- with a pager, at a sister restaurant next door, as other reviewers mention. No problem there. However, when we were called, they sat us at a table that was literally crammed in the walkway between the bathroom and the host stand- right in the middle of the floor.  Secondly, when I ordered my usual- a skillet (they took my favorite Veggie skillet off the menu some time ago for who knows what reason), I was surprised that the eggs on top of it--all egg whites as I had ordered-- were mixed with some unknown chemical-tasting substance that made them extremely fluffy but also taste like corn starch. I didn't even feel like I was eating real eggs. My companion's skillet came with scrambled eggs on top that were literally half the size they used to be. They used to cover the entire top of the skillet, but now the egg portion is only about as big as your palm. Thirdly, I could barely find the cheese in my skillet. It used to be completely over the top of the entree. Someone is trying to cut corners, and make products- like eggs and cheese- stretch, by mixing probably 3 eggwhites with some unknown substance that makes it taste funny, and cutting down the serving sizes of the regular eggs, and cheese. And by giving you a table right in the middle of the walkway that was clearly a blatant attempt at making more money. Sad.  I truly hope Melis is not going downhill due to greed, as it is always extremely busy, and I can't imagine the shortcuts are due to lack of business. You are trying to rip your loyal customers off, and it has been noticed. Please make a change or you will lose us.",0.9786,0.804,0.136,0.06,0.44850572707715564

The food is ok although as others here have said , its overpriced, I dont tend to notice when the food is good but if the service is bad then you notice the cost. Today I had the veggie scrambler which was good, no complaints here, the waitress though initially kept coming by asking if we were ready to order, so we felt pressured to order quickly, we ordered and then the waitress disappeared, I had to flag her down several times to get a coffee refill. My friend mentioned that she was very busy but in my mind a good waitress makes you feel like you are the only table. Anyways when we were done is what upset me, it just seems the waitress seemed to want to get us out of there as quickly as possible, she immediately gave us our check as soon as it looked like we were done (no we didn't ask for it) and came back twice (though the folio had not moved) and asked if she could take it, I really would have liked to sit and enjoy my coffee but noooooooooo. I suspect this is because the place is so small that they want to turn the table but pulllleeeaassseeee!

They serve bread, fruit, and potatoes on the side with the omelets and benedicts. They make their own jam! And it's amazing! Freshly squeezed juices. I love their salmon omelet, pancakes, and orange juice. It cost about $15 - $30 per person depending on what you order.  The place is very clean with real flowers on each table. It's great for a max group of 5 or 6. It would be a awesome place to bring a date. Wall drawings are cute. Nice atmosphere.  Place is not too spacy.

When we arrived, the hostess told us it would be a 35-40 min wait (for 3 people including myself). Immediately I wanted to leave because that's ridiculously long and I was starving. Unfortunately I lost that battle so we waited.  Our buzzer went off after about an hour of waiting and we were seated in the most crammed corner of the restaurant. Seriously? Can they either knock another wall down or get rid of some tables? Money hungry.  As soon as I looked at the menu I almost burst out laughing from the prices. Everything is EXPENSIVE. Don't come there if you're a broke college student like me. I ended up ordering what I thought would be the cheapest ""meal"" and filling. Wrong. I got a ""plate"" of bacon for FOUR $! It came with 2 pieces! I also ordered plain waffles for $7.50. The waffles arrive and they have strawberries on top. Um, nothing against this delicious fruit but I'm not shelling out an extra $3 for a couple pieces tossed on top. I specifically ordered plain & when asked if I would get charged extra for THEIR mistake the waitress seemed confused, looked around and left never answering my question. They took the plate with them and brought my plain waffles. Another thing, if you like extra syrup prepare to pay up for that too because nothing extra is free. Ridiculous.

2013-01-20,2.0,"Their juice, which is good, is the only thing keeping this place from being a one star. The service was fine, but you know it is bad when I send burger back because I will eat almost anything called a burger. It tasted like the meat had been left uncovered in the back of the fridge for a few days. They give you homemade ketchup and while I appreciate the effort, it is so so and mostly tastes of worcester sauce. The vegetable ""mound"" that I had to replace the burger was filled with what tasted like freezer burnt vegetables straight from the bag and a lump of scrambled eggs on top. I should have known by the name that it would be a mess. The accompaniment to my ""mound"" was a single pieces of toast cut into 4 small pieces which every had a laugh at. It was dubbed ""franken toast"" because the pieces seemed to come from many different slices. My wife was not very happy with her eggs benedict either, not exactly sure why. I really felt bad for the friends who brought us because they knew it was just not good. In the end, I paid $60 (w. tip) for two subpar meals, 1 (VERY small) cappuccino, 2 coffees and 2 juices.

2013-01-09,2.0,"For the amount of time I've been waiting to try this place, it just didn't cut it.  I think a lot of it had to do with the fact that I (and the Yelp ratings) hyped it up, but it didn't measure up to other breakfast places I've eaten at. Price: $4.50 for a ""large"" glass of fresh squeezed juice, dishes starting around $9 1. This ""large"" glass of juice could be finished in 3 gulps. 2. I got the apple juice and it seemed a tad bit on the tart side...perhaps because apples aren't in season anymore? *shrug* 3. The breakfasts themselves seem a tad bit overpriced.  Maybe it's because I'm from the suburbs and I'm used to $6-8 for a given dish and asking for toast to be swapped with pancakes for free, maybe it's because my boyfriend is a fat-ass and likes to get 2 dishes for breakfast, but $45 seemed a bit steep for two people to eat breakfast. Taste: 1. Corned beef hash eggs benedict - corned beef hash isn't my cup of tea, but if you like it, go for it.  The hollandaise sauce itself is quite good--perfectly seasoned and the egg was perfectly cooked too--the yolk was runny, but not too runny. 2. Meli crepes - good GOD.  The marscarpone cheese filling and the delicate cinnamon taste of the crepes was absolutely delicious.  Not much of a sweet lover, but holy hell these babies are the best crepes I've had at any breakfast place hands down. 3. Eggs, toast, and potatoes: I'm very traditional when it comes to breakfast, so I opted for the traditional eggs, breakfast meat, potatoes, and toast.  Earlier I mentioned I wanted the toast swapped with pancakes.  They charged an extra $4 for the swap and I thought, ""sure why not.""  Now, I'm not complaining about the amount they give (2 pancakes), but for $4, they are not worth it.  They are very dry and do not have a pancake taste, but more of a pumpkin-y, cinnamon-y taste.  BUT, the rest of the breakfast was pretty decent.  Everything was cooked pretty well (minus the overly dry pancakes). Service: Do not expect your server to come around more than once after your food has been served.  Granted it's breakfast, and the place is thoroughly crowded even during a weekday, but it's always nice when servers come around asking if the food is okay or if there's anything else we need. Bottom Line: Could only give this place 2 stars.  For the price, the food is definitely not worth splurging over.  I love, love, LOVE breakfast food, but I was kind of disappointed.  BUT, I'm not knocking this place.  Try it if you're around the area and looking for a fancier breakfast.  To each his/her own!",0.998,0.78,0.187,0.033,0.6087259816207184

Rolled in with my stunning date, KLH, at 11:30a on a Sunday -- told it was a 30m wait -- given a pager, and sent down the street to Muses to wait out our hanger pains w/ free coffee -- in exactly 30m, our thing lit up and we scurried back over to dive into our salmon benny, tofu scramble, and pretty much any other breakie delicacy our hearts would have desired. The menu ranges from standard brunch fare (a bunch of types of omelettes w/ normal + bougie options, pancakes, bennys, waffles, crepes) to a very respectable vegan/gluten free section. One of the owner's kids must be nut free b/c they label the eff out of there menu -- basically, it's a neurotic parent's dining out wet dream if your kid is any sort of fussy eater. The portions were ample but not overwhelming and the ingredients were fresh and well prepared. Service is brisk but friendly -- they want you in and out quickly. Not a place to linger and gaze lovingly at your companion, as I clearly tried to do, but rather, a spot to stop in for a yummy, surprisingly diverse bite to eat and then get on w/ your day. Worth a visit. Oh, parking isn't terrible in the area either, a major win in my book. Crowd ranges from young families to couples -- it's not a place to go for the people watching.

I was immediately excited to try out their breakfast and see what Meli had to offer.  My friend ordered the eggs Benedict and I ordered the cobbler crepe. We also got lattes. My crepes were pretty good, the highlight of them being the fresh fruit and the caramelized brown sugar crust that came on top. However, the crepe itself was just so so. The latte was fine but nothing special. My friend enjoyed her eggs Benedict but the true highlight of the dish were the amazing breakfast potatoes that came with. I had my fair share of them and they were outstanding, some of the best potatoes I have had for breakfast in the city.  However, I have a few complaints about Meli. I think it is a bit overpriced. $12 for a crepe when the actual crepe is not very good is a bit much for me. Also $4.50 for a latte that's not even 12 ounces is also pretty ridiculous. If you've read a lot of my review you know I very rarely complain about prices. As far as I am concerned I'll buy anything if the food is good and the service matches. The real tipping point for me at Meli is when the busboy told us he needed us to leave because they needed to turn the table. How freaking rude, right?! I don't like overpriced food only to be kicked out of the restaurant so they can sell more to someone else.

We sat down and a 4th person arrived unexpectedly. The hostess followed our 4th unexpected guest to our table and attacked us for adding a 4th person since they only seat people if their entire party is present. That is totally understandable, but the way in which the hostess dealt with this last minute guest was terrible. She came to our table and rudely said, ""I thought you said you only had 3 people in your party?"" She came all the way from her post to come tell us that as if she ""caught"" us doing something wrong.  The table was four-top and what difference did it make that an additional customer had arrived to your restaurant? I quickly responded that she was in the neighborhood and decided to join us and was this a problem. She gave us a dirty look and stormed away.  We were all shocked and disgusted at how rude she was. Then the female server arrived at our table and said, ""I thought there were only 3 of you?"" To that comment we quickly replied, ""Now there are 4 of us. Is there a problem?"" She was so irritated and said, "" I just didn't expect someone else.""  Was this really such a big problem? Why say anything at all, except for I don't know, ""Welcome, may I get you started with something?""  It just made all of us feel not welcomed at all.  I understand that they are enforcing their policy but there has to be some flexibility within the policy to allow for situations like this to occur without turning your customers away. Seriously, is this how you greet your customers? Do you not realize that your tip relies on your service and friendliness?. The hostess and our server should quit treating customers as though we are lucky to be at your restaurant eating. Actually, they should just quit so that Meli can go back to having a good reputation that treats its customers well.

This was good... especially with the homemade ketchup.  Hash Eggs Benedict: Jessica loves corn beef hash. Again. it was good. Pork Belly Frittata with Feta: It sounds better than it looks.

2012-10-07,5.0,"My coworker introduced me to this place and i think its really good, we make an effort to come at least once every 2months (we would come more but parking is a definite hassle). I recently brought my extremely picky eater who thinks hes a chef (now ex) boyfriend here recently because we were in the neighborhood and honestly we almost left without even entering because we could not find any street parking for 10min. Didn't want to pay $12 for the parking lot across the street from meli's because its breakfast! The most we would be in there is 40min! Its seriously not that serious. Well when that issue was finally resolved my then boyfriend was very skeptical of the menu, he asked the server if he could have the western omelet with pepperjack cheese instead of cheddar, wasn't a problem. I ordered the French toast with wild berries. Right when my ex was about to lecture me on the negative health affects of eating too much sugary foods the food came (fast and perfect timing!). My French toast was delicious and really good looking, with fresh blue berries and sliced strawberries, sprinkled with powdered sugar. My ex looked at his plate as if it wasn't good (wasn't as good looking as my French toast but when are omletes attractive without a garnish?never). Once he actually tasted it he just stayed quite, ""is it good?"" I asked, after a moment of silence he said ""i couldn't have made it better myself...I have to buy pepper jack cheese"" wow that was the first.

2012-09-20,4.0,"If you're looking for an awesome place for breakfast look no further and come to Meli!  With a morning free from class, my friends and I scoured Yelp for some good eats before heading to school. Seeing so many great reviews and drool-worthy pictures, we quickly decided on Meli. The restaurant is located on Halsted in Greektown. There isn't a private parking lot, but there's plenty of street parking so no need to fret.  The restaurant offers a large selection items from omelets to skillets to crepes to waffles to pancakes...yeah it's pretty overwhelming. The interior is very uppity (is that an actual word?) and many of the patrons seemed pretty affluent so it's a restaurant you should come to when you A) get your paycheck or B) wanna indulge on special occasions. When we first arrived, we saw a girl that seemed to be the hostess, but we were actually greeted by a server, which I found a little odd considering the hostess was just standing there. The hostess had a sour look on her face like she was annoyed to be there and was constantly sighing and rolling her eyes. These are common symptoms of a condition my friend calls #HOSTESSHATE, lol. Yup, this girl had a full blown case of it. Anyways, the person who seated us actually turned out to be our server who was incredibly warm and welcoming, offering her personal favorites from the menu, as well as other recommended dishes.  Here's what we ordered: -Mana Mou skillet (my dish/server's rec): This dish was a hefty $16 which is different than the price listed on the site, FYI, but it was sooooo worth it! The skillets consist of a layer of diced red potatoes on the bottom and your choice of ingredients on top finished with two eggs any style. It comes with sauteed portobello mushrooms, red onions, bell peppers, black angus steak and a layer of creamy melty provolone cheese. OMG! The angus steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked to a medium rare to medium so it practically melted in my mouth. I'm actually salivating writing this. Okay back to the review, I topped my skillet with two poached eggs, so the velvety yolks became a sauce to make the dish even more rich and decadent! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! -Emerald Isle skillet ($12): this skillet was alright, but nothing to write home about. This skillet is made up of corned beef and is top with swiss cheese. I actually found the corned beef a bit too salty to my liking. -Spicy flamenco omelet ($13): This omelet consists of chicken chorizo, jalepenos, onion, avocado, tomatoes, cilantro and pepper jack cheese. It's topped with sour cream. This dish was pretty good. All the ingredients really lend themselves to each other. It was a good combination of spiciness from the chorizo, jalepenos, creaminess from the avocados cut by the tangy-ness of the sour cream and the cilantro added a freshness to the dish.  In addition, the meals come with your choice of toast and house-made ketchup and marmalade. We received orange and strawberry marmalade with our meals. The orange marmalade was definitely the better of the two. I would've licked the dish if I was in the comfort of my own home - that's how great it was! They also sell the marmalade, which is awesome. The ketchup was equally as delicious - haha, I actually contemplated having my friend take the bottle with us, but we were trying to be classy, lol. Sooo...you're probably asking why I knocked off one star since I've been raving for the past 5 paragraphs - 3 reasons: 1) #HOSTESSHATE 2) There was a slight mix up with our bill where we paid, but the cashier couldn't add so they tried to charge us even more, but she ended up catching her mistake after we brought it up. 3) Our server was training another server, which was really nice, but incredibly clumsy (i.e. slamming plates on table, spilling water, etc...) Overall, despite the minor setbacks, I would definitely come back to Meli to try out other items on the menu and their fresh juices!",0.9993,0.781,0.198,0.021,0.48277777777777786

The plating was beautiful there not one dish that did not look anything less than beautiful. When we finally go seated our server approached the table promptly and was friendly. Most of the choices on the menu came with this delicious potatoes!!!! OMG those potatoes!!! I had some sort of mexican turkey chorizo flavored with eggs and jalapenos. IT WAS AMAZING! My friend really enjoyed how fluffy her eggs were. She also had the orange juice which taste like you literally stuck a straw in the best tasting orange you will have in your life!

I recall having a smile on my face as I was happily chewing away. The pancakes were only okay. Though when paired with the fruit spreads and that divine maple syrup, they are a-okay!

From all the hype Meli gets, this particular branch was smaller than expected and awfully busy. But that didn't stop our restaurant hosts from doing their all. Three of us settled in for a catch up brunch (make that feast) and had a marvelous time. Even on a good day I take my time deciding on what to order. I have never seen a menu the size of Cleveland before. I know my friends wished it were shorter, but there was never a doubt about our orders. Looking around, I was tempted to say, ""I'll have what she's having"" but instead I went with the apple cinnamon crepes. Granny Smith never had it so good. Across the table though, and it's a good thing too, honey french toast with warm custard and, you guessed it, honey was beckoning. And to round out the threesome, a great looking panini with avocado and sun dried tomatoes and baby reds on the side. The bread smelled fabulous. No gripe about the coffee either, and that is something I expect, no, I need to be fresh and great. And it was. Maybe it was the first timers experience that shot me to the moon.

Ingredients are all of high quality, and for the most part, portions are voluminous. Rarely have I eaten something here that isn't among the best versions of the dish served in this city.

The juices and smoothies are fabulous. Homemade ketchup is life-changing. Hates: -There are some problems with consistency. Today I ordered my salsa stacker and it showed up with no avocado. I asked the waitress and she brought some over, which was nice, but seriously that thing has structural integrity problems as is and trying to add avocado to the already high stack of veggies and tofu was a feat. Last week I was asked if I wanted a to-go cup of coffee -- free of charge. Um, hell yes, please! Today, I ask for it, and the waitress says, ""Sure, but I'll have to charge you"".  Hmm... -Crowded. This place is always packed. I understand this because it's good food; however, when you are packed with only about 3 feet between you and the next table this presents a problem. Also, I always seem to be packed next to the table with loud kids. Not the place to come to if you are looking to have a leisurely brunch. - Just strange... The past two times I've had the same waitress and each time after I order from the vegan menu she asks me if I would like bacon or sausage with my vegan entree. What? Seriously?

2012-07-17,2.0,"I always order two eggs lightly scrambled for breakfast.  This means you should be able to see the yolk and the whites separately in the scramble--kind of like sunny side up all scrambled together.  Instead, I always get a HUGE amount of eggs on top of my meal which looks like a big ladle of Egg Beaters cooked well and kind of tasteless.  I have settled for getting poached eggs.  Two poached eggs are small and just the right size.  If the Egg Beaters thing was real eggs, it would have to be many more than two or three eggs, depending on what you order on the menu.  Anybody who thinks the eggs are great hasn't had homemade scrambled real eggs for awhile.  In their defense, I do like the potatoes--not the same dull hash brown stuff at other places.  I like that they are nicely grilled and the onion added is great.  Nonetheless, the last time there was no onion and it looked like there were pepper flakes instead.  Sure enough, the potatoes had a kick to them that I just was not in the mood for.  I also like the fresh fruit to make the meal more balanced.  With respect to meat, they are all very salty--I think more than at other breakfast places.  As far as my issue with the eggs, I can get poached or sunny side up, but the whites are always cooked too much to scramble up with the yolks nicely.  This would be a decent place if I could get two eggs lightly scrambled.  If the waitresses could communicate this to the kitchen instead of picking up the juice menu EVERY time (we're regulars) and hawking the juices, it might be more stars.  Maybe no one in the kitchen understands English, just like at other breakfast places.  Whenever I watch Triple-D on Food Network, I kind of wish they had some of those places here in Chicago.    This is a nice place that we always went to with my late mother (she liked ""nice"" restaurants for breakfast), and some of the menu is more high-end, but the rest is not a whole lot better than other breakfast places but a lot more expensive.  If there were more nice breakfast places in the area, I don't think they would be as busy.  As it is, the last few times we've been there, there was no waiting, so maybe it's getting old.  We go regularly year-round, so this is very unusual.  My husband likes the pancakes, so that is why we go there, but frankly, I am tired of getting a breakfast that I do not totally enjoy.  I've had breakfast at high-end and low-end places all over Chicago and in other cities for decades.  Unfortunately, when you've had really great breakfasts in other places, that spoils it for the ones that aren't there, and this is one of those places that isn't there.",0.9859,0.833,0.123,0.044,0.5491921041921041

Someone near my table got an oatmeal smoothie which sounded gross at first. When I looked up this concoction in the menu it actually sounded yummy (oatmeal, skim milk, honey, whipped cream I think). I would love to try more from their juice bar. The restaurant itself was very pleasant. At 7:30 am about half the place was full. It's very clean and welcoming with cool artwork on the walls and fresh flowers on the tables. Our waitress was attentive, and we didn't have to wait long for our food. The lights went out about halfway through our meal, but we were near a window so it didn't affect us much. A hostess came over to apologize, which I think is pretty cool.

2012-07-02,4.0,"Meli in Greektown is one of those places I have walked past a million times and never even taken notice from the outside.  Maybe it's the unassuming vibe that keeps it under many people's radar?  Who know, but that's my story and I'm sticking to it. My party happened to arrive around 9:30 Saturday morning and I expected there to be a wait.  However, we were lucky enough to be seated immediately by the gracious hostess.  In no time, we had our glasses of water and menu in hands.  Because it was my first time here, I really wanted to make sure that I chose something that I haven't had at so many other breakfast places.  Since the place is called Meli Cafe and Juice bar, I knew I had to also order juice/smoothie.  I settled on the ""Avocado Scrambler"" and the ""Mango Blast"" smoothie. The ""Avocado Scrambler' had: avocado, black beans, jalapeno, tomato, pepper jack cheese.  I love spice and a southern kick in my food.  The added bonus of avocado being the starring ingredient immediately made it a winner for me.  When it arrived, it did not disappoint.  If you're timid around heat/spice in your food, do not fear  this option.  The black beans and avocado rounded out the heat in the jalapeno and pepper jack cheeses nicely and it was the perfect combination of ingredients. The Mango Blast smoothie had: Mango, Banana, Orange juice, Mango sorbet, Frozen nonfat yogurt, and whipped cream.  I wish someone had warned me that the smoothie was a meal in itself!  The portion could have easily been split by two people if you don't want to take any of your other food home.  The smoothie was DELICIOUS.  I opted to finish my smoothie before my scramble because I could not stop guzzling it down.  I see myself stopping in just to grab a smoothie and go (if staying for a bite is not an option). What I appreciated about Meli was that though it was busy, our food was out in record time.  It was nice not to have to wait forever when you're hungry.  But, it did not mean that anyone was rushed out.  There were tables there who had been there long before we arrived and were still there when we left, and that's nice. To sum up Meli Cafe and Juice Bar:  Go for the good food, stay for the incredible smoothie!",0.9973,0.801,0.173,0.025,0.5260648148148149

Another server pointed us out to what I assumed to be our flustered server, but she just looked at us and let put a huge sigh, then proceeded to grab a large tray of condiments to take to her 6 top and explain in detail what each was. She then proceeded to take their order, still without acknowledging us. I thought for sure she would say ""hello"" as she walked by to put their order in the computer, but she didn't. The order must have been extensive because she was at the computer for quite sometime. She then disappeared into the kitchen at which point my boyfriend and I got up to leave.  We walked passed the horrible hostess and crawled on the floor to grab our belongings. No one offered to help. The hostess turned up her nose and didn't mutter a word as we walked out.

Sausage was a wonderful savory companion, flavorful, tasty. The pancakes were a little dry and I wish they were more liberal with the honey! Got an itty bitty drizzle on them although if there was more honey then that would negate the healthful effects of the the multi grain pancakes? Who knows, I just know it wasn't enough.  The friend ordered the strawberry stuffed french toast. Although I didn't have a bite, the dish looked phenomenal. Also bordered on deadly since it looked like it could kill you instantly with the amount of mascarpone and custard. ""Bigger is better"" seems to be Chicago's motto.

It is the fastest I have ever received brunch food in my life. Ri-donk.  Good atmosphere, and I didn't have to shout to hear the person across from me (e.g. Yolk or Eggsperience). Nor did I feel stressed about about having 20 hungry people glaring at my breakfast across an open floor plan (e.g. Yolk). We still felt pressure to eat and leave within 30 minutes of sitting down, but not nearly to the extent of the more popular chains.  I've also been to the Wells St location, which is more spacious and I think an even better brunch spot. Enjoy!",0.9396,0.797,0.143,0.06,0.4905050505050505

On both locations we were served promptly, but also on both occasions the food came ice cold. I ordered the French Toast. The menu said that for $1.25 extra, you can get ""real"" maple syrup. I asked for that and our waitress said they only served real syrup.  My table mates all ordered egg dishes. Skillets came warm, their toast was not freshly toasted, therefore, cold. My French toast was ICE COLD as was my bacon. The syrup was not real. Our server did not come by to ask how are food was, and when we were given the check I mentioned that my food was served cold. I hardly ate any of my dish. she said I should have said something. Perhaps I would have if she would have asked. I was very surprised that the manager did not come by after a complaint was made. This shows very bad management. My meal should have been taken off the bill. Then I would give them another try.  Their prices are so high, you would think the food would match the price.  I never will return.

2012-01-09,1.0,"Remarkable in its' badness. Stayed long enough to get a bill, but never got to eat. I went to Meli's for breakfast on Sunday morning, 1/08/12. Place looks clean. My server was bad through and through. To start with, I was there early enough to beat the rush. The place wasn't too busy. Despite that, she ignored me for so long (not even acknowledging me), I had to ask the manager to bring me  coffee.  a That was only the beginning. The menu advertised pancakes, filled with cranberries, covered with almonds. I asked the server to bring me the cranberry pancakes, with no almonds on them.  She brought the pancakes, with almonds on them. I asked her if I could please have them without almonds. Her face registered an expression indicating that I had made an unexpected, weird request. ""Oookay"", she said. She took the pancakes away. She returned shortly after that and asked me. ""Sir, why didn't you just order the regular pancake dish?"" I told her that the cranberry pancakes had cranberries in them. Okay, she said, and left again. I thought it couldn't get any worse than that. But she returned shortly after that, and asked, ""Why don't you want almonds? Do you have allergic reaction to almonds or some other reason?""  At this point, I was half-expecting a camera crew to come out saying this whole thing was a setup. But it was real life.  I think the only way this could have gotten any worse, would have been if she had come back out of her nook, hit me with her tray and then thrown scalding hot coffee in my face. I asked if she needed to know that so that she could feel free to scrape the almonds off the first order. ""They told me to ask you"", she said. I told her I didn't think I had to justify my request.  ""Well. Ok"", she said, and went away again. I watched her disappear into the kitchen area. A couple minutes later, two or three servers came out of that area, looked at me, and retreated. I got up and went to the kitchen area to tell her to cancel my order. Before I could say anything, one of the servers who had come out to look at me said, ""Sir, just get back to your seat. We'll be right with you. Back to your seat, sir."" About five minutes later, a woman wearing a business jacket (I'm assuming she was the hostess) came to my table and asked if everything was ok. I told her if everything was ok, she wouldn't have just showed up at my table. I told her what had happened. While we talked, the server was at the table next to ours, taking orders. The hostess said she couldn't understand why the server had done those things. I said, well, she's standing right there, why don't you ask her?  She didn't ask her.  They charged me for the coffee, but they had a different waitress bring me the bill.",0.8146,0.896,0.058,0.046,0.45558379120879133

Perfect plan. Despite reviews indicating that it was always busy, I was still surprised to see the place hopping when we got there around 1pm. It was a busy, but not stressed or frenetic, environment and the staff was promptly attentive and thorough (noticing our baby, asked if we needed a high chair, for example, and then had it at the table before we even got there). The service was superb throughout our visit. Espresso drinks were perfect and our food was at the table before we had time to sip past the expertly developed froth.  The menu is extensive and accommodating to many different tastes, dietary needs and lifestyle choices. I ended up winning in a fight against my impulses to order something with bacon and sauce. My arteries may be slightly happier that I settled on the Farmland Skillet: sauteed spinach, portobello, zucchini and tomato, topped with havarti cheese (thus the ""slightly"" qualifier above). My wife got the vegetarian benedict and my mother got some kind of meat, cheese and potato scramble. Everyone loved their choices except for me. Perhaps I shouldn't have ordered something I didn't have my heart set on (vague pun intended), so I won't blame Meli Cafe for what I thought was a relatively bland scramble. What I really had a problem with, and the only thing that keeps me from giving this rockin cafe five stars, is that my skillet was actually burnt in some places.

My husband had this and I snuck in a few bites.  Came with 2.  Side potatoes were perfectly cooked and tender.   Overall, we were very well pleased, and going here reminds me if why I trust using Yelp recommendations :)",0.9944,0.667,0.32,0.013,0.6372807017543861

We were a party of 20 so I called to let them know in advance. The manager Alina, was kind enough to reserve one section of the restaurant for us. As you know, the problem with large groups is that someone invariably cancels or arrives late. They were extremely accommodating and seated us as people arrived.  THE FOOD WAS DELICIOUS.  We had wraps, paninis, omelets, scrambles, vegan scrambles, crepes, juices, smoothies; basically all their popular dishes. Not one person complained about the food. In fact there was silence at the table as well devoured our dishes. They gave us some of their in-house honey butter and marmalade on the side. It was polished off in 45 seconds!  We're definitely going there again. I haven't met a single person who has a bad thing to say about Meli Cafe.",0.9544,0.754,0.161,0.085,0.6435374149659864

Highlights of the breakfast were the veggie frittata and the orange carrot juice. Veggie frittata was delightfully yummy and not too heavy as regular frittatas. It has chunks of avocado (yum!) which makes it totally over the top. The carrot orange juice was delightfully refreshing. They serve bread with homemade jam goodness. We also had the eggs benedict which was delicious. The only dish that was disappointing was the tofu scramble - did not enjoy it.

Well, no regrets there. We also had 2 of their freshly squeezed juices. Only critique I have is that I wish they were served more chilled, the juices came room temperature and I rather it be chilled. Food wise, it was great. The skillets were awesome- inspired me to make something similar at home. They were generously portioned, flavorful, and packed with meat, veggies, potatoes, and topped with 2 fried eggs.

The portions are good and the fresh squeezed juices are wonderful. Now the place can get quiet busy on the weekends and the wait can drag for a while so make sure you go there early. Now when it comes to the staff I have not really encountered any problems. I think the staff does a good job considering how busy it can get. The place is also not that big so it can get tight at times but I think the food makes it worth it.

I am a freak about crepes, but i always think a Benedict is the measure of a good breakfast place. Especially because I am a freak about how I like my eggs cooked.  I ordered a ginger carrot orange juice - that would have been delicious , except that it was warm, which sort of grossed me out. Coffee, which truly earned a 10, GREAT coffee.  I commenced to attempt to order my Benedict from the only quasi English speaking waitress (German maybe?) within moments I was ordering Benedict with no eggs, Benedict with hard boiled eggs, Benedict with three eggs. NO - what I said was I like the whites pretty firm, but the yolk still runny. ( I hate it when the whites look mucousy) I finally gave up and just said bring it regular.  Which means mucous - just saying blech.  The Benedict was ok, generous portions, the home fries were slightly undercooked red potatoes. Average.  But what will keep me from coming back was the obnoxious owner ( at least he acted like the owner) who sat to my left fussing at the chef and harassing him over soup, while he ate a different soup and basically excuded grumpiness.

With seven different varieties of French toast, nine different servings of eggs Benedict and 14 types of omelets, it's impossible to not find something that will wet your whistle on their menu.

We shared a skillet and their strawberry and banana french toast. He got coffee. I got an earl grey tea.  Let's start with the tea - it was the most bland, un-fragrant earl grey I've ever had. Really disappointing given how good earl grey tea should taste.  But I won't give them too much crap for their tea. It's tea, after all.  Their skillet was about the size of my head, which was amusing at first. First bite: there's something funny about this egg. Second bite: this egg tastes like it's laced with metal. Didn't have much more of that.  The french toast: they used challah bread and provided real maple syrup, which should have made just about anything delicious. It was boring. My taste buds were so excited, but upon the first bite, disappointment swept over me. How could something so beautiful taste so bland?

The restaurants used organic foods, and I could taste the difference. The crepes were also not too sweet, which is how I like it. The avocodo wrap tasted very fresh and yummy! The veggie skillet were a tad too salty, but overall very good and filling.  The prices are a little high for a breakfast and lunch joint, but they use all organic foods. The place is small, but cozy and bright with all the natural lgiht coming in.  The only problem we had was the service. I think because it was so busy, there was a lack of customer service. Everything seem to be done in a hury. Everytime my friends asked for a coffee refill, the server asked my friends to hold the cup for her right in front of me. It kept splashing on me.

The waitress (she's European, I think Polish, tall with brunette hair) asked if we wanted anything to drink. Although we said give us a minute, she took the coffee cups away. Then she came back again and we were still deciding. What do they expect when there are billions of choices on the menu. When she comes around the third time we are ready to order. My fiance wants coffee and she has the nerve to say ""now you want coffee.""  From that point on I was pissed!  How can you enjoy the food when the service sucks!  Jeez...At least the food came quickly.   In the US, giving a tip has become a standard. And it's a high standard of 15% too unlike Europe and Asia. I know that many servers and waitresses work hard and rely on tips, but sometimes I really just want to leave no tip at all!  There's a reason why it's called gratuity; and it should be given when the service is superb....not subpar.  I see from prior posts that there are servers here with attitudes, guess we were stuck with one!",0.6147,0.87,0.078,0.052,0.41603448275862065

The menu is huge, everything is good, and most things are excellent.  Even before the great salmonella outbreak of 2010, they were using cage-free eggs. They use local organic produce whenever possible, and you can taste the difference.  I'm normally a pancake girl, but their omelettes are so excellent that I almost always get an omelette here.  One of my favourites is the Fresh Omelette, with huge chunks of artichokes, but I also often order from the specials.  It's a little more expensive, but the quality of the ingredients is worth it. A couple of times, I've had a weird interaction with the wait staff (I think they're told to push the specials sometimes) and at busy times, you might need to flag someone down for a coffee refill, but for the most part, the service is great.  Even though a ton of people come in and out of here all the time, they recognize the regulars.  I'm not an every day regular, or even an every week regular.  I've probably eaten here 10-15 times over the past year and a half, but one of the waitresses always recognizes my mom and me, which is nice. The space is bright and sunny, the coffee is Lavazza done well, the juices are fresh, the pancakes and french toast are excellent, and sometimes I dream about the omelettes.

In our short trip, we ate there twice, had the portobello benedict, corned beef sandwich, French toast with fresh berries and just simple eggs, potatoes and toast. All were good and they served the toast with homemade marmalade, a definite plus. BFATT commented how all the servers were attractive females with cute accent, and I would agree.

I'm really disappointed at their new business model.  I realize times are tough but seriously, do you have to charge extra for everything?  My friend wanted a little extra syrup for his pancakes...umm, extra charge.  That little nub of butter not enough to smother your pancakes with?...umm, extra charge.  I REALLY flipped my lid when I saw that my request for a cheese substitution cost me $2.25!  Yeap... a piece of cheese (swap) cost me a 1/4 of what the actual whole sandwich cost me!  Seriously???? I'm surprised they weren't charging for the extra coffee fill ups!  Anyways, there is no doubt that the food is great, flavorful and all of that stuff BUT dining out is about the experience too.  Who wants to feel like they are going to be charged every time they have an additional request?  I liked Cafe Meli much better when it first opened and they actually wanted their customers to come back!",0.9744,0.786,0.151,0.064,0.4267045454545454

We were sitting against the wall right by the right side of the restaurant, where you can see people walking in the entrance. It was a party of four, nice little brunch with our boyfriends :) We arrived around 2pm, & I knew we would be out by the time they closed the kitchen/restaurant. From the beginning the server seemed to rush us, asking for drinks & what we wanted to order. I didn't mind it at first, but once we ordered our food she was ready with the check in her hand & asked if we wanted any more coffee because she was going to empty it out, also saying that they wanted to close early that day. .. ?? That really bothered me~ but since all of us were having a good time catching up before my flight, that's why they have three stars. As far as the food, I had Meli's omelet; panchetta (bacon), shollots, parsley, chives & boursin (cheese). It came with potatoes & wheat toast, with a slice of cantaloupe. For the longest time I was trying to figure out if the boursin was cream cheese or sour cream :P I liked it though! I couldn't finish it all, but I didn't bother to ask our anxious server to wrap it up. I didn't get to eat some of my toast & try the jams! ugh.

Panchetta, shallots, parsley, chives and Boursin cheese. Pretty damn good. Definitely rich, but tasty and filling. The omelet came with some red potatoes and toast. The potatoes were great.

I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the most raved Eggs Benedict, served with Canadian ham etc. Although the food looked very appealing....it tasted just alright. The egg was cooked perfectly, however the ham was over-cooked and a bit too sweet for the dish. I ended up chewing this nice and delicate egg mixed with tough and sweet Canadian ham. I ended up separating the components so that I can at least enjoy the eggs, and worry about the ham later. Overall, I think it's a nice hang-out place on a weekend.

My friend opted for an omelette and as soon it was set down, I had food envy and looked at my Cobb salad and was disappointed. I'll toot my own horn here and say that I happen to prepare the best darn Cobb salad this side of the Brown Derby, but Meli's wasn't all that. It had the standard Cobb fixin's (bacon, bleu cheese, hard-boiled egg, tomatoes) but the roasted turkey that came on it was sliced, like deli meat, and not cubed. It was weird. I am used to chunks of turkey or chicken in my Cobb, so the gigantic, thin slices of it laid across the top made it less than desirable for me. It was kind of a ""blah"" salad, which is difficult since a Cobb has so many naughty ingredients--it should be bursting with flavor. It was not.

As a result, there was no wait. However, we were told upon being seated that the credit card machine didn't work... so we had to walk down the street and come back with cash. Upon being seated everything seems clean, cute, and cozy. I order the *pancakes with berries and my friends gets the *Eggs Benedict. The coffee was poor. The food average. The worst part was the service. Despite not being busy at all, we had to ask for coffee refills and were never asked if everything was ok. Visit number two. Sunday morning- I should have known better? We arrive about 11 and are told it's a 20 minute wait. Seems short for as many people are standing outside so- awesome! 30 minutes later we ask for an update and are told 15 more minutes. At this point I'm upset, but willing to wait. There was clearly a preference to seat tables of larger parties first as tables were combined and held to seat large parties before couples. Additionally, when seated the list at the podium had at least 4 other couples who had arrived 10 spots or further down from us, crossed out. I would assume they had just left and stopped waiting; however I was watching people being seated and know that's not the case. I ordered the *Chevre skillet. It was deflated and absolutely loaded with sundried tomatoes. They drowned out any other flavor. The chevre was in a giant gob in the center. Maybe this was intended? It wasn't balanced. My potatoes were also way underdone. To be sure, I made my boyfriend eat one because he claimed his were fine. I suppose my skillet was done first and shriveled while waiting for the potatoes. My toast was served practically as bread too. I was too upset to complain at this point though. I wanted to offer a saving grace to them and ordered a mixed *carrot juice to go, since that's soooo good? Good thing I eat things only because they're healthy sometimes! The boyfriend's *Steak and Eggs were good. He thought the eggs tasted ""off."" He suggested they may have honey in them. I wouldn't be surprised at this place. Gross? He said his medium breakfast steak was really good. While I found it flavorful, it was clearly a cheap piece of meat VERY tenderized. His toast was done properly though! Jealous!

From the moment they set my delightful banana maple crunch smoothie in front of me, I knew it was love... it's hard to go wrong when there is the magical combination of maple and banana. I can't really even elaborate on that... except to say that the texture of the smoothie was pretty much heavenly, not too rich, and definitely a smoothie texture than a milkshake-y one. The lovely waitress even split the smoothie for my dining partner and myself to share. Hoorah. The service was all-around excellent.  Continuing on... I had the jalapeno skillet... which was pretty much to die for. I did almost die for it, because my body and chorizo do not get along... but the pure deliciousness I experienced was definitely worth the stomach pain.

The key is to come here on a weekday morning around 7:45-ish. No wait required. The menu is extensive and my choice of the turkey sausage scramble was a good one. I am allergic to grasses so I merely got a whiff of my companion's shot glass of the murky green wheat grass concoction that everyone seems to love. My goodness, the things people will drink in the name of health. But I digress... The waitress was friendly and efficient and the food was tasty enough. The atmosphere was bright and sunny...I think I can only muster up 3 stars because of the host, whom I presume is an owner. A little advice: spend a little less time smoothing down your hair and a little more time practicing the art of the smile and a ""good morning.""

The wait staff is fantastic, especially very early (which is usually when I've been there).  Coffee filled frequently and frequent (but not annoyingly so) checks to make sure all is well are appreciated.

The restaurant itself looks like your typical pancake house but the prices on the menu were a little high (~$10 for pancakes).  That said, we were all happy with our meals.  I had the Meli's Honeycakes, which are more like corn cakes and they were delicious.  My fiance had the buttermilk pancakes, which probably wasn't fair since a) Golden Nugget can't be beat and b) we make an almost perfect version at home.  He wasn't thrilled but my bro and sis-in-law raved about their omelets.  The coffee was excellent and our server was perfect- very attentive without being obnoxious.

I read some amazing reviews and immediately my mouth started watering, I had my heart set on either french toast or waffles. Although these are not adventurous options, that's what I was in the mood for at that time. The hubs on the other hand likes almost anyplace that has a skillet (which they had plenty of).

2010-03-29,4.0,"Wilberry Cafe: come to Meli. Pay attention. This is how you should make ""fresh"" strawberry pancakes. That's right, the menu at Meli says that they serve their strawberry pancakes and waffles with fresh strawberries, and when your order arrives, you actually have strawberries that somebody washed and sliced (in the kitchen!) on your plate. They serve a generous amount of the fresh fruit, too. There's not a plate of gooey canned strawberries to be found here. This is also how a juice bar should be run. There's a decent-sized glass with no corn syrup or other fillers inside, just fruit juice, guts, and maybe seeds (I ordered a berry concoction so that's par for the course). You don't get some wee shot glass full of runny goop with a kool-aid aftertaste.  That said, you definitely pay for the quality here, both in the price of the items and possibly in time spent waiting in the packed lobby area or even outside on the sidewalk. These are not IHOP prices, but then,  IHOP doesn't offer delicious artichokes or Lavazza coffee. My only issues with this place concern potatoes and decor. You cannot get potatoes, apparently, except in a skillet with eggs and cheese. Sure, I could hold the eggs and cheese, but then I'm paying $11 for just potatoes. I'd like to see a side of hash browns (not corned beef hash...hash browns!) or something like the North Shore Potatoes at Clarke's. Potatoes are Very Important. Then, the walls look schizophrenic. There are ""country kitchen,"" ""Paris bistro,"" Danish modern, and random Greek elements scattered throughout the restaurant. The Greek letters on the walls make sense, because this is Greektown after all, but the rest...? It wouldn't be hard to change a couple things and have some sense of a cohesive concept. Normally I don't care about decor but since they obviously put a lot of time and money into it here, I'm a bit stumped over the results. The service, bathrooms, menu selection, and menu clarity (as in, does what arrives at your table actually resemble what you thought you were getting based on what the menu said) are all good. Even during the busy lunch period, our servers always stop by and check on refills often enough. Overall, I'm a fan but I can't give them 5 stars because they deprived me of my beloved hash browns. What kind of all-day breakfast restaurant doesn't have them?!? Honestly, I know a lot of people who would give it 5 stars and am married to a person who considers it his favorite place in Greektown or for breakfast food period, but obviously none of these people are embroiled in a passionate affair with the fried potato.",0.9753,0.857,0.098,0.045,0.5240362811791384

2010-03-19,4.0,"Well, there are 350+ reviews on Yelp for Meli, so clearly they don't need my help. But for those of you who might just happen across this one, here goes: My boyfriend and I dropped his mom and her boyfriend off at Meli on Sunday around 1 so they could put our name down while we took the car back to our place. When we got back to Meli, we found that they'd sent his mom & her bf to 9 Muses a few doors down for a free cup of coffee while they waited. How cool is that? I'm not a coffee fan, but it's a pretty nice gesture I think. Anyway, we actually ended up only waiting 35 minutes (from the time the bf's mom & her bf put our names in) for a table. Awesome for a Sunday. The one negative thing I found was that they are so squished in for maximizing space that the bf's mom's bf ended up knocking someone's water over with his coat as he was trying to sit down. Bf's mom ordered a skillet which she really enjoyed, her bf ordered some waffles which I hear were super yummy, and my bf & I ordered eggs. Scrambled for him, sunny side up for me. I should add that most of their offerings are organic, which is pretty cool. So onto my eggs: I got toast and red potatoes with them, both yummy. My eggs were pretty good up until I got to the part of the yolk I eat (I sop up the rest with the toast), which wasn't that yummy. My boyfriend didn't really enjoy his eggs at all, and we think it was the organic thing.  I think what they're doing is great, but I guess the organic flavor isn't for us because we just didn't enjoy the taste. Next up on my order plan is pancakes or waffles. I look forward to it. I like that each person gets their own separate butter and it doesn't come on the food (I can't eat butter). The downside for my bf's mom's bf was that he wanted more syrup and wasn't allowed because it's fancy natural dark syrup, so a mere extra cup would've been more than $3. Oh well. All in all, a good experience and I plan to go again. Forgot to add: Atmosphere is nice, love the decor, and the strawberry & blueberry jams are amazing. I could use them every day.",0.998,0.753,0.208,0.039,0.543859649122807

The chicken pesto panini is still my favorite, but I've recently discovered the housemade crisps, and their juice.  I like to call it science juice.  Their fresh pressed apple juice is just as tasty as Nana's, but cheaper.  I also tasted a couple of other concoctions.  I recommend the apple, carrot, celery.  Crazy?  The color of Carrot Top's curly locks?  Yes and yes, but it will increase your night vision.  We all need increased night vision.",0.9842,0.718,0.24,0.042,0.6687037037037038

The positives: great location, nice decor, large menu and food comes out incredibly fast. Now the negatives: this place is really expensive for breakfast it will cost 2 people around 40 bucks and this is only for 2 breakfasts, a coffe and a juice. This place also charges for everything. You want a little salsa on the side, bam you get charged...umm I just spent 15 bucks on eggs and you want another 2 bucks. Wow!!! Speaking of eggs it is $2.09 for an extra egg here...umm Trader Joe's sells a dozen for $1.29, maybe I should bring my own. This place also uses the small eggs too..no X-Large eggs here. It is all yolk and no white. Remember the positive on how fast your food comes, well there is a down side to that. The chefs do not put any love in what they are making. My Eggs Benedict came out with the yolks completely hard...I have never experienced that before. We also had to hunt down the waitress to show it to her, she never came back and said, ""How is everything?"". The yummy red potatoes that come with every dish had completely hard uncooked potatoes mixed with the cooked ones. Yummy!!! The sign of a lazy uncaring chef. This is unacceptable because it wasn't like there was a huge crowd or this was the weekend.  Also when you pay the bill the lady at the register doesn't even ask you how everything was...she is cold and unpleasant...like the food here! I tried this place twice and had problems both times. Now for everyone giving this place 4 and 5 stars...do you know how to cook breakfast?  For 40 bucks I will come over and cook for you in your kitchen ...don't waste your money here...plus you won't have to get out of bed and find a parking spot in the cold.  Think about it!!!",0.9862,0.788,0.147,0.065,0.51591840059582

2010-02-15,3.0,"Since moving to the West Loop, we've been talking about going to Meli for brunch but never got around to it until this past weekend. Reading all the reviews about crazy wait times, we weren't convinced that Meli would be THAT good to warrant waiting around for 30-45 minutes for things we could pretty much get at any other brunch spot.  This past Saturday we happened to wake up on the early side and decided to go thinking that pre-9AM would be a reasonable arrival time w/ minimal wait. We were in fact seated right away but I was still surprised about how packed the place was this early in the morning - I can't imagine what it's like closer to 11-12.  Anyway, our waitress came over promptly and proceeded to try to ""sell us"" on the specials. We asked for a few more minutes to peruse the giant menu as many things sounded delish. I opted for the pork belly benedict (one of the specials) and Amy got a ham/cheese omelet with a side of sausage and asked for a side of maple syrup (this comes in handy to my review later on) ...  The waitress almost seemed annoyed that Amy didnt opt for one of the specials - although most were some form of very sweet french toast and she's not a big fan of sweet breakfast items.  Anyway, our food arrived quickly and we really enjoyed both dishes. They definitely manage to add a little extra ""umph"" to basic things making their food more like ""fine-dining brunch"" which was definitely enjoyable and noteworthy.  So remember the side of maple syrup that Amy ordered? When our bill came there was a $1 charge for the syrup which A. was a tiny bit in a small ramekin and B. we were never told came with a charge. It's clearly not the $1, but the principle. For a place that is consistently packed and not cheap, I was really annoyed by this. I didnt say anything but in my opinion its the little things like this which say a lot about a restaurant.  Yes, the food was good (great even) - but with the wait which is sure to get worse as the weather gets nicer, the somewhat pushy service, and the up-charges for something so stupid as syrup - what could have been a 5 star review and a place added to my faves - has sadly turned into 3.5 stars and the likelihood of passing it up in the future.",0.9874,0.798,0.136,0.066,0.5261263086795002

Their hot chocolate is to die for as well. Like the marmalade they serve with their toast? No problem, you can take a jar home for $5.95! I just took some of their blackberry marmalade home today.

Sadly, I'm not sweet over heels for this corner shop. Now with 300+ Yelp reviews, I threw a bookmark on it long ago. With a Monday day off in concert with my refusal to wait to dine, I took Ruthie there for lunch.  Parking in G-Town, if you're not eating gyros or souvlaki, is a grand pain so take the #8 or Blue and make a trip of it or just pay. We got seated right away at 11:30 a.m. on a holiday Monday, which I would say is hardly normal judging by the throngs of people who came in behind us. Nothing makes lunch more fabulous than being able to say, ""Man, we got here at JUST the right time."" The menu is ample and everything, seriously everything, sounded good. Fresh ingredients, ample portions. I likey. Like the lovely Jelena Z., I chose the Chipotle Chicken wrap as a tip of the hat to the lunch hour though many a scramble were calling my name. It packs a punch, makes you wait to cool off and then applies an elixir of avocado. The wrap was deep. Poetic, even. And so were the potato crisps (p.s. they're chips, sir).  And hot damn the food came out fast. Everything was lickety split. As I often do with my mom, I got in a few good questions. Today was, ""Where were you the day MLK got shot?"" She was teaching at Cather Elementary on the West side. Shots rang out around the neighborhood. She grabbed her sister and hightailed it north as things got revolutionary, out of anger, frustration and grief. The next morning? Bullets in the chalkboard as those who mourned made gunfire in the wrong direction. Tumultuous for sure; important to remember.  It seems trite to say, but Meli wasn't memorable.  And, ack, the price. For two juice drinks, a cup of soup and two sandwiches it was over $40 with tip. That makes me sadzies. On the other hand, I will not be eating for the rest of the day, so perhaps it's worth its weight. No matter as time with moms is time well spent, and a good meal is just gravy on top of it all.",0.9485,0.836,0.103,0.06,0.5558201058201059

I had the Veggie Frittatta and my mom had the Fresh Omelette which had Bacon, Artichokes, spinach, dill havarti, mushrooms etc...I had a bite of hers which was very good with the rosemary potatoes.  I am by no means a vegetarian (I have a well-known meat tooth) and was thoroughly impressed with this dish.  I felt satisfied but not overly stuffed--SIDE NOTE:  I chose this dish since I had a meat overload the night before feeling as bloated as a Biggest Loser Contestant.)  We did order a side of hollandaise which accompanied both our omelette/fritta meals very well-just slightly tangy and enough cream to make the vegetarian dishes not so healthy.   The cappuccino and iced coffee we ordered was strong and very refreshing-perfect for a sunny fall day.  I definitely would come back to try the fresh squeezed fruit juices.  It is, however, a bit pricey for breakfast omelettes-I left there with $50 with tax and tip included.",0.9887,0.751,0.183,0.066,0.5094871794871795

2009-10-05,4.0,"There are restaurants that serve de facto brunch, to folks who happen to order pancakes at 11 a.m., and then there are restaurants that DO brunch, the direct descendants of those trendy spots that invented quiche eggs benedict, and the term ""brunch"" itself.  Meli is one of these.  We went here on a Sunday morning and had a wait of about 30 minutes--maybe a little shorter (we arrived about 10 a.m.).  The entry way is VERY tight--you want to wait outside if you can (as in, if you like breathing), so I'm not sure how that goes in the winter (actually I am sure: people line up, stamp their feet, blow on their hands, and wait).  The name of the restaurant (Meli=""honey"" in Greek) is the only nod to Greektown (all the surrounding restaurants have Athens or Acropolis in the name, and feature signs with giant, glowing spits of lamb).  Inside, the atmosphere is totally different.  It's remarkably bright, cheerful and calm for how crowded it is, but the staff is definitely in high efficiency mode.  They refuse to seat incomplete parties, and though we were all there, our hostess took off to show us our table before all 4 of us had even wrestled our way through the door.  The menu is HUGE and tempting, with 10-15 daily specials in addition to the extensive list of omelets, frittatas, pancakes, French toast, skillets, waffles, crepes....and on and on and on. I was worried the server would really rush us to order, but she didn't--got us our coffee and smoothies and let us ponder for a minute.  We tried the praline creme brulee French Toast (turned out to be almost too rich to eat, according to the eater), the jalapeno skillet, and the peppadew omelet (peppers, onions, Swiss cheese, and jerk chicken).  The food came out in record time, which had me wondering: the omelets are the baked puffy kind, and those take awhile--I remain skeptical that mine was cooked just for me, after my order was taken.  I'm not really sure why this even bothers me...I didn't have any special requests (one of our party did, and they were accommodated), and the omelet was tasty and freshly made--not like it had been sitting under a lamp or something. My guess is that they were anticipating orders of this special and maybe had them going all the time....? Something about it just seemed odd.  The watermelon garnish was delightful, as was the homemade berry jam.  The roasted potatoes were nothing to write home about (a little mushy and nothing special going on with the seasoning).  The omelet was FANTASTIC, and gave me two full meals.  Speaking of which: I'm not sure if they do all their cooking with heavy cream, or some other kind of super-rich ingredient, but NONE of us got very far in our meal.  We came in starving, and we're good eaters.  The portions were generous, but no more so than other brunches where I've wolfed down everything.  All four of us filled up REALLY quickly.  The leftovers reheated well later, so that was all fine...I was just surprised.  Hope to make it back some time soon to try something different--maybe the fig omelet!",0.9892,0.812,0.121,0.067,0.5751441528992549
2009-10-03,5.0,"Can I please give this place two snaps in a Z formation?! I LOVED everything about Meli!  For the past year, I'd heard and read great things about Meli, but for some reason it kept falling off my radar of places to have breakfast. Probably because in my mind, it's hard to beat Yolk. However, this week my co-worker told me that it was fabulous and that I should try it, so finally I did - and now it's reigning as my favorite breakfast place in the city.  Although it's in the heart of Greektown, the area doesn't influence the ambiance whatsoever. You walk in and it's like a cozy french country cafe with yellow walls and comfortable tables. We went on the earlier side, 8:30am, so there wasn't a wait, but it wasn't dead either. Sure enough 15 minutes later, there was a line out the door.  We sat down and looked through the extensive (no joke HUGE) menu with tons of breakfast options...everything from french toast made with Challah bread, duck omelets, skillets, frittatas and much more. I went with a breakfast usual - Corned Beef Hash and Eggs, while my husband ordered the Pancakes. When the food came we were surprised at how large the portions were, especially for the low cost of everything. My meal came with eggs, toast, corned beef, red potatoes and fruit...everything was so delish, especially their homemade marmalades. However, the real deciding factor was my husband's pancakes since he really is the connoisseur and sure enough he gave them a thumbs up - enough to say that he prefers Meli's pancakes over Yolk's which says A LOT.  Overall, this place was amazing and to Yolk I have to apologize, I think Meli's will be our new breakfast place we frequent every weekend.",0.9886,0.835,0.137,0.028,0.5168860418860419

I think the service is pretty great considering this is in Greek town, and, according to a friend of mine from Carpathos, Greek restaurants aren't exactly known for their hospitable service.  You get seated quickly, they take your order fast, and bring your food fast.  Sometimes they forget about your check, but I think they're just letting you stay as long as you want without pushing you out the door.  Seems like good service to me!",0.994,0.763,0.21,0.027,0.5850000000000001

Their juice selection is great, the coffee is Lavazza, and they serve your toast with homemade marmalades that always rock.

My friends all loved the pasta salad. I'm generally not into sides except veggie salads, so I didn't eat much of the pasta. I did steal a bunch of fries from my friend, and they were great. I'm not normally into fries, but these were one of the few that I tasted that made me want more. I looked around and saw dish after dish that made my mouth water.

Also that they have one of those shiny radio frequency things that vibrate and shine is not a good thing. The service was excellent. Despite being extremely busy at no point did we feel neglected. They also did the courtesy of staying out of the way.  The food was fresh, tasty and you get a generous portion. I had their Meli chicken sandwich which was memorable.

Despite the long lines (heads up: Sunday's post church crowd flocks there, so GO EARLY!!!), I love this breakfast and lunch spot! The smoothies are super fresh and delicious (but $5 is a little pricey though, in my opinion). Food-wise, I usually go with one of their Eggs Benedict varieties for breakfast, they have about 8 on the menu~ VARIETY IS NOT LACKING!  Side note- the french fries ARE TO DIE FOR.... they were super crisp and perfectly splashed with spices.... salt pepper i don't know exactly, but they were soooo good.  I've seen reviews on bad service, I haven't had a bad experience there so I can't comment on that topic, but seeing how busy it gets I can see how one may misconstrue rudeness for being overstressed. And a lot of the wait staff has thick accents (foreign girls)-- maybe lost in translation issues?!  They do abide by the ""complete party rule""- can't be seated until your whole party gets there.... if you know that ahead of time, no need to be shocked by it!

We got right in and the place was pleasantly buzzing but there were still tables available. I enjoyed two greek gentleman talking. I could not understand what they were saying but they seemed so nice and they were obviously a fixture in the nieghborhood because people who came in knew them. The waitress was nice and it only took her a couple of minutes to get to us. Coffee came quick and with refills frequent. To the the yelper that said they could not get anyone to fill there coffee because other waitresses told them that they needed to wait on their server: We got refills so often that we had to tell them to slow down. Other servers would come by and fill our coffee. On to the food. The menu:HUGE. So many selections we did not know what to get. I settled on the Meli honey infused pancakes which were awesome and a side of turkey links. My wife does not care for pancakes too much and she loved them. Anyway my wife had the portabello mushroom benedict and it was absolutely wonderful. All in all I would say that Meli is a top choice for breakfast in my book. I love you SWEET MAPLE CAFE but you have some comp in the breakfast department. I would not say that Meli is better than SMC it is different. If you want southern style SWEET MAPLE is the place to go and if you want breakfast with a GREEK flare come to MELI. I give props to both Chicago staples for breakfast. We are going to work our way through the menu here and eventually end up in breakfast calorie bliss but  we love every calorie of it. Also just an added note, if you want good food, you have to wait sometimes. Service is good but every place has an off day now and then, no restaurant has perfect service. I have been to my favorite establishments and had great service one day and bad another day.

We got there around noon on a Sunday. The wait was about 20 minutes and so we took our ""buzzer"" and went to stand on the sidewalk to enjoy the great weather (this could be a detriment in the Winter months!)  After about 20 minutes our seats were ready and we were led into a very warm and comfortable space. We were close together to the other tables but not uncomfortably so. What I liked about the decor was that it verged on being a bit country which was refreshing given so many brunch spots are going for the stark, utilitarian look with stainless and plastic.  The menu is extensive. They have specialty Skillet dishes, all kinds of eggs, french toast, hotcakes, you name it. I wanted my favorite, Eggs Benedict but I also wanted to try some of their hot cakes. My friend solved the problem for me as he ordered a small side portion along with his egg skillet.  For as busy as they were- the food came up quickly and was just as good as our server said it would be. I love when servers praise the food where they work- after all- what's the point of working at a place where you don't love the food? And as for us? We loved everything we ordered. So much so that one in our group went back for breakfast the next day to do it all over again.  Street parking is rarely a problem (bring quarters, the new meters are here as well) but if you can't find it, there is a lot just north on Halsted that will run you around $6.  Brunch in Chicago.

Eat, talk, relax and enjoy time with friends without feeling you must run when done with the last bite.  hostess and other servers are just not that friendly. Not nasty, per se, but certainly not exactly pleasant AT ALL. Decor: Who cares overall if decor is not that great, but in this case the restaurant is kind of cute but not kitsch.

One of the specials was a cornmeal chili pancake, which sounded so good, I went for it in spite of having been determined to try one of the eggs benedict variations.  I was amply rewarded.  The cakes were fluffy and savory, and really didn't suffer from a lack of syrup or butter (though I was tempted to ask for some honey to see if it would compliment the heat from the chilis.)  They were served with very spicy bacon bits, almost too spicy for me first thing in the morning.  Tasty, but something I went easy on. My companions both had eggs benedict variations.  I don't care much for hot smoked salmon so I passed on trying Jim's breakfast, but Dawn had classic eggs benny, and a bite of hers convinced me that it was the real deal.  The egg was perfectly cooked, and the hollandaise was excellent.  The only thing I'd fault them on was that it was applied wit h a stingy hand.  Eggs benedict should be a lavish dish with a bit of hollandaise left on the plate to mop up with that last bit of muffin. I was impressed to discover that they had a good selection of teas to choose from.  I asked for ginger and got Numi tea, something of a premium brand.  Nicely done.  I didn't try the coffee but Jim and Dawn both said it was excellent.

The lunches we had were good, but I did take a bite of the person's meal who got the strawberry stuffed french toast and it was a little over the top for me. But they really enjoyed it.  Service was friendly from the moment we walked into the restaurant. Oh, and I tried my friend's juice and it was great.... I just wasn't in the mood for spending $6 on a drink.... but I'll probably get one another time.  I cannot wait to return for brunch!",0.9819,0.841,0.145,0.013,0.5825396825396825

I don't go to breakfast that often but given my given physical state, something calorie-laden was in order.  Don't let the wait deter you. There waiting room was packed, and we were told 30 minutes. 15 minutes later (yay!) the buzzer went off and we were seated.  I opted for one of their fresh juices. I got the carrot apple celery concoction. It was pretty tasty. Different, but still good. My boyfriend ordered the mango orange kiwi juice. It was really sweet but also very good.  For the main event I ordered the special; an artichoke omlette. It was realllllly hard to decide since the menu is huge. I knew i wanted an omlette and the artichoke option filled all of my requirements: bacon, cheese(I think it was goat cheese), and veggies(HUGE chunks of artichokes, tomatoes, onions). They are very generous with all of the ingredients. The dish was served with these wonderful red potatoes and grapes. I was in breakfast heaven. My boyfriend got scrambled eggs, toast, potatoes, and turkey sausage. He said it was tasty, and I thought the turkey sausage was a nice option for those watching their waistlines (obviously not me this time).  They also bring you homemade strawberry jelly and whipped honey butter to spread on your toast which added a nice touch. It seems a little steep price wise, but i was only able to eat about half of it and was still stuffed! I ate the rest for dinner and it was just as good. The service was decent. The food came out quickly and our water glasses were refilled often, so no major complaints there.

I have passed by Meli Cafe & Juice Bar and thought about stopping at this cute cafe for ages now. When I finally had a willing party to join me for a midday breakfast, I jumped on it. As we walked to our table I gawked at the plates full of sweet french toast, simple omelets and potatoes, and lots of yummy-looking sandwiches. You're right. I have no shame! I gawk. The menu is ridiculously large. It's a good thing I had in mind what I wanted from the start. I was feeling like a skillet and chose the one off the specials menu. That did not stop me from checking out the extensive frittata menu, eggs benedict menu, omelet menu, breakfast sandwich menu, french toast menu, pancake menu, waffle menu, and crepe menu. And that's only the breakfast side of things! Holy moly, Meli Cafe! The food came so fast it was like they already knew what we wanted before we, ourselves, knew. Everything came piping hot and fresh. We even got still warm toast (with fluffy whipped not-hard butter)! Yummy. My skillet was incredible. It had great flavor, texture, and just the right amount of gooey cheese. This was not yo grandmama's skillet, honey. It only took one bite into a chunk of habanero to decide that. My ""partner in breakfast"" allowed me to try his veggie omelet which was juicy and fresh. Love it! I cannot wait to go back and try more breakfast selections, something off of the lunch side of the menu, one of their fresh juices, and definitely one of those smoothies with whipped cream that I saw at the table next to us.

2009-03-09,3.0,"Based on the food I ate and some of the dishes I saw around me, the food is 4.5 star material.  Meli has a great menu that makes it hard to decide what to pick. I was debating whether to get the French Toast Teaser or the crepes with Nutella and banana or maybe one of the skillets. I opted for the Teaser which included Chocolate toast, banana french toast, traditional and challah french toast. They were all great, especially the challah which was very fluffy.  Considering the food was fresh and not greasy (like many other cafes) I felt that the price was right. Not dirt cheap but not outrageous. My problem was the attitude of this place. The hostess would not sit us until our whole party was there. I understand this. They were busy and do not want to hold up any tables. But what bothered me was that she was quite the _______ about it. My friend was outside parking when our buzzer went off, so we said that our party was here so that we could get the available table (I know, it was a technical lie but my friend was literally one block away). But anyway, we sat down and my friend came in one minute later. The hostess would not let her through. My friend said, ""But my friends are already at the table"" to which the hostess said, ""I can guarantee you that your friends are not here"" and my friend just asked if she could at least look but the hostess said that she couldn't. She took down my friend's name and gave her a buzzer as if she were the first person from our party to get there. I was wondering why she was taking so long, so I sent her a text explaining where in the restaurant we were - this place is not even that big. Finally, my friend had to show her the text that I had sent her saying that we were past the hostess booth on the left. She let my friend through begrudgingly saying, ""Well, normally we wouldn't do that.""  Then, our waitress seemed bothered when we needed a minute to decide what to order. Before we ordered, we asked if we could split the bill because there were four of us, and she said she could do it at the end. If she couldn't, then we were each going to just go to an ATM to grab some cash. When the bill came, it was all on one. I reminded her and she just took it back and asked what each of us had. Again, her tone was a bit on the unpleasant side. Finally, she said she could only split the bill into two , not three parts. Okay, we said.  Then, here is the kicker. One of us asked for quarters. She gave her $1 in change. Then another one of us asked for $3 in quarters because she had to feed the meters but the waitress refused because she had already given someone in our party quarters. My friend said, ""But that was to her, I'm paying on a separate bill."" So, the waitress told my friend to ask the lady at the bar. She said ""We can only give one dollar in change, otherwise we run out."" So, my friend said ok, and then put one dollar on the bar instead of the three. The lady was yapping away with another waitress for about 5 minutes when my friend asked if she was going to give her quarters or not. She repeated that she could not. So, my friend took her dollar back.  It didn't end there even though it should have. They actually brought the manager over to explain why they cannot give out change to everyone. My friend was like, ""Okay, I got it"" but the manager felt the need to reiterate herself three times. Since we had paid our bill, we got up and put our coats on. We got glared at as we walked out and our waitress said thank you in the most disinterested and obligated way possible. Would I go again? Probably. I would like to try other dishes. I wouldn't go expecting to be treated very nicely though. I'm hoping maybe we caught them on a bad day but I have a feeling that hospitality is not their main thing.

2009-02-25,4.0,"Meli is a great place to take someone for a great breakfast, brunch or even lunch. It was a surprise to find this great cafe in the middle of Greek town. The decor is fresh and bright, at times it reminds me of an upscale hotel restaurant. Although I have never tried any of the fresh juices, the people I dined with have, and claimed that they were good. Nothing spectacular however, just good. I mean, it's juice...how can you make juice spectacular? And they don't have any exotic juices, just the general orange, apple, carrot, etc. I do however, love the coffee at Meli for some reason. It's always fresh and strong, not watered down or stale, like it can be at some places.  The food is heavenly. I have only been to Meli a few times and I am sitting here wishing I could go back now because there are so many other things that I would like to try. (I will have to update this review after trying more things.) The omelets are good, big and fluffy, and they come with a good portioned side of baby reds (YUMMY!) and your choice of toast. NOW, I am not a HUGE toast person, but I think I would come to Meli just for the toast. Every time, it is toasted perfectly and the marmalade that they give you is sinfully good. They make the marmalades on sight and they are some of the best that I have had.  The only downsides to Meli are that they are very busy on the weekends (so I don't go on the weekends). Parking is also a little hard to find. I either head east on Jackson and find a meter or you can park at the parking lot on Adams and halsted for $6 up to 4 hours. Also, I was here once (I ordered strawberry french toast, my friend ordered an omelet and toast) and we were given two TINY dollops of butter. One dollop barely even covered a piece of toast, so when I asked if I could please have some more butter, the waitress explained that more butter will be an extra charge. Alas, I paid $.45 for another minuscule dollop of butter. Go figure. Lastly, the restrooms are only one stall (I'm not sure about the men's, but in the women's it's only one stall), so if it gets busy, there might be a wait for the bathroom.

One of my favorite aspects was that they have a deal with the bar down the street to allow people to wait inside and enjoy coffee and morning cocktails until their table is ready.

The juice bar was also delicious and took it up a notch putting a bit of flair on the drinks we ordered. The food was okay. My husband had the Cristo Melt, which he thought was very solid though maybe a touch more cheese was needed but the bread was fabulous. My friend an asparagus omelet which came red potatoes. The potatoes were good, especially if you aren't looked for the char that many restaurants have. I tried the Portabella Crepes. The mushrooms had great flavor, but the crepe seemed like it had too much egg in the batter as I sometimes felt like I was eating a really thin omelet. But it definitely tasted yummy. The other great thing was the people watching. This was our first time and maybe it was a fluke, but both parties seated next to us during our brunch were quite entertaining to eavesdrop on.

Don't get me wrong - food is good.  But why do they charge $4 more for your standard breakfast fare?  My option of choice with breakfast is almost always eggs benedict and here, it was good. But again, why do they charge so much more than other places? For the same price, I was able to go to Deleece Pub Grille for a LOBSTER eggs benny where at Meli, it was just the standard. Tables are cramped.  Service is unremarkable.  I felt like they wanted to rush us out because the line ups were out the door.  So we left but they won't be seeing us again. 2 stars because I wouldn't return due to the price/performance ratio.",0.7365,0.933,0.058,0.01,0.40888888888888886

The menu was extensive with menu prices ranging from ~$7 to $12 for most items. I had the special omelet of the day with pickled peppers (server recommendation) and my girlfriend had the classic eggs benny. Food came quickly on huge (too huge?) plates. My omelet was huge...must be three jumbo eggs. Served with thick pieces of toast, half a plate full of baby red potatoes (portion much too big) and a slice of pineapple. I enjoyed the omelet and my girlfriend's benny was ok. She said the english muffin was a little tough to cut through. Our server was nice, but didn't initiate conversation and starred at us from across the room. Very quiet when we were there and she didn't pick up that it was our first time when we asked a bunch of questions about the menu items. It wasn't bad service, just not great service.

It is true that the lines can be long if you stroll in anytime after, let's say- 9:30 AM or so, but the wait in my opinion is actually well worth it. They do both savories and sweets really well, and for the quality- they keep prices reasonable. Besides, long lines are a testament to this places reputation, and also of course ensures that their items are most likely fresh (more turnover, more frequent the food!).  While I tend to prefer Intelligentsia as a coffee choice at a morning meal (or Dunkin' Donuts when coffee alone is all I want)- the Lavazza they have is a great change of pace.  While I also almost always side for savory, this is one place where I know the sweet breakfast items are so good- they should never be passed up. Always multiple French Toast options, Crepes, Pancakes, and their juices are great too!  If along or near Halsted- step in (or wait outside for a while) and enjoy this place any day of the week.

We arrive around 9am on a Sunday morning.  It seemed a bit crowded since the dining area isn't that large but we waited less than 5 minutes for a table for four.  After being seated our server was there promptly to offer water, coffee, juice, etc.  She also pointed out the specials and then gave us time to decide on food. The coffee was great, hot and fresh.  The orange juice had been freshly squeezed and had just the right amount of pulp which I actually like.  I ordered Meli's Omelet which was phenomenal.  Seriously, I was totally blown away.  The egg was cooked perfectly; not watery, runny, or dry.  The ingredients seemed fresh and instead of just piling them into one section of the omelet and flipping some egg over the top, everything was blended throughout the entire omelet so you got one good bite after another. Mmm, so good.  The omelet came with toast and potatoes which were both equally enjoyable.  The potatoes were hot, seasoned nicely, and not overcooked.  The toast was toasted just enough so have a little crunch on the outside but was thick enough so that it middle was warm and soft.  Damn, I'm suddenly hungry again.  I have no idea how that's even possible though since the portions were also pretty large. My friends also loved what they ordered.  Some other things at the table were the cran/walnut breakfast, nuttella crepes, and corned beef hash.  No one had any complaints.  In fact, I know they enjoyed it because at one point we all tore ourselves away from breakfast long enough to look at each other and realize we weren't even talking.

Even after eating 3 eggs, I don't feel like I want to die. With as busy as this place gets, the service isn't always top of the line.

First off, to make sure you don't have a bad experience from the get go, you have to realize that this place gets bumpin' on the weekends, and i mean BUMPIN'.  If you think you can come in at about 1030 - 1230 with 4-6 and grab a seat right away, you are insane.  If you want to come with a big group i recommend you suck up your hangover and get there early - it will be well worth it.  Otherwise, two is the ideal number for this cozy place if you can't get yourself and shacker company up before 11.  I've come and seen over a dozen people waiting just outside in the dead of winter, and that's a testament to how good it is.   To the Menu: Over 7 full pages of delicacies, it is a little overwhelming at first with how many options you have to pick from, and all delicious.  Before you tackle that i recommend a delicious smoothie and/or freshly squeezed juice ( I always go with the apple juice.  It tastes like you are biting into the best red apple you have ever eaten).  Then, order up a cup of fresh Lavazza coffee which they brew to perfection.  Now don't sweat about picking your meal, everything is delicious.  Any signature dish (carries the the name ""Meli"" in the title) is an easy choice for the indecisive.  But don't be afraid to peak around at other tables and ask what the name of that delicious egg topped skillet is.  Food comes fast fresh to the table with a complete set of homemade jams that are fantastic (this coming from a guy who never really cared for jams).  The hearty portions are never over-seasoned and you can always taste quality of the ingredients.   The meal is a steal when you think about the quality goods you are consuming.  I would say the average meal is about $15 - 16/person with tip and tax for an entree and drink.  Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed.",0.992,0.792,0.164,0.044,0.5750992063492063

2008-04-23,4.0,"I live in Uptown and I've decided to start checking out breakfast/brunch spots around Chicago, getting away from the brunch stuff up here anyway. Meli Cafe was first on the list. Overall my experience was good and I would return, alone or with others. However, probably not often. The tab on my excursion ran me roughly $28 including tip.  And that included: Coffee an Orange Banana Strawberry with Honey juice Sun Dried Tomato Ricotta cheese Fritata Side of Sausage Links Side of Baby-Reds (their take on potato) Walking in getting seated Experience.  I walked in and the place looked a bit fancy, but then not. Sort of like Olive Garden but with classier silverware. The host was chating with her friend when I got in, but noticed me pretty quickly and got me a table. I sat at a four-top and glad she did so. The extra room on the table would come in handy when my food arrived.  the Action: A bus boy walked about with a glass of water. He was pretty slick, set the glass down as he continued walking on to the next table. I observed him for a bit, he seemed to be off on a daze for most of the while. This was to be true for almost all the staff as I discovered when asking for things. Everyone just seemed enchanted. My server was polite,and that's about it. I flipped over my coffee cup and was delighted to see the Lavazza logo. I enjoyed their coffee drinks a lot when I worked in the loop. And the coffee was perfect, not too bitter and perfectly hot.  Anyway, I ordered my food, and beverage. My server brought out a plate of butter and marmalades. The marms looked pretty good. The juice came next. I was intrigued with how they'd infuse the honey. Since it settles pretty quickly in liquid. The juice was okay. Too warm. Needed some ice. And by the time I got to the honey layer I stopped drinking it. It started getting a bit bitter.  The food arrived pretty quickly. The Fritata was presented quite nicely. I got an english muffin and proceeded to go to town on the marms. Unfortunately, I couldn't taste much flavor in them. But they looked nice. My Fritata was pretty tasty, not too bland and not too spicy either. Which is how I like my omeletes. Then I realized, hmm. Potatoes don't come with this dish.  By that point another group of four were seated and some other 3's and 2's came in and the place started hopping. The music changed from some folk style music to a more euro-jazz flavor. That was a nice change. I think it's good when restaurants are in tune with their clients. Whether it was intentional or not, i'll probably never know.  I was pretty intrigued by how the server took the 4 top's order. Unlike me, she didn't write a single thing down. And then proceeded to assist another table and finally me with my requests for potatoes.  The first four top got some really delish looking items. This strawberry french toast plate look absolutely scrumptious..  Anyway, the only thing I can knock a star down from is just the cold feeling I received from my waitress. I don't think it was intentional, but at least put some good face on for kicks, or try to remember us single people come out to eat once in awhile to ya know. :)  At least I helped her check average.. :)",0.9987,0.802,0.176,0.022,0.5866443452380953

First off, it seems to be EXTREMELY popular for Sunday brunch. I wish I had known to bundle up prior to leaving the apartment because I was FREEZING outside in the cold for about 45 minutes before I could even move indoors to wait for my table of three. By this time my toes were totally numb inside my Converse. The place has minimal space indoors for the people who are waiting so you're forced to stand outside for the majority of your wait time. The menu is pretty fantastic - a great variety. It is really hard to choose whether to eat Sweet or Savory, my roommate and I both struggled with this before we ordered. The food turned out to be pretty decent. Note: If you're not into honey butter (which I am not, come on, butter was meant to be salty not sweet) then be sure to request regular butter because the former is all that they serve otherwise.  But here is my biggest complaint - our server was RIDICULOUS. She was by no means cool as a cucumber. She was practically sweating taking our orders and though everything ended up being correct, she read back to us an order that was more incorrect than it was correct. And she was VERY defensive when we corrected her saying that that is what she had (well, why didn't you read us what you had then?). Anyhow, my absolute favorite part was when she leaned over my plate to pour coffee for my table-mate and the coffee pot spilled all over my breakfast plate - soaking not only the Eggs over-easy, but the toast and bacon as well.

2007-07-18,2.0,"I originally rated Meli with 5 stars, after being a regular customer over the life of the retaurant. In recent months, I've had some bad experiences that were completely due to the staff or operational structure of Meli that have severly damaged the light in which I see the restaurant.  This delightful little cafe was a such wonderful addition to the Greektown collection when it opened its doors.  It is such a treat to be able to dine in Greektown with out flaming cheese searing your eyebrows from your forehead, or being surrounded by tons of Greek men with chest hair peeking through the open, top buttons...even if I too am one of those guys. Once you enter the cafe, you are not only greeted by a lovely array of soothing colors and decorations reminiscent of a European sidewalk cafe, but an absolutely enticing aromas.  A redolence of homemade pastries, smoothies, jams, marmalades and fresh squeezed juices fill the room.  After you soak in the wonderful smells, the site of a server carrying a tray full of mouthwatering breakfast treats will double your hunger pangs immediately.  The downfall is that whether you order a side of small pancakes, or a larger order of full size pancakes, you get a little one, maybe 2 oz of maple syrup. If you need more, you pay $0.75 for each little cup. Now, I'm no economist, but I'm pretty sure they aren't making their own maple syrup, but even in the even that they are, Maple Syrup isn't that expensive. I shouldn't have to be able to buy a whole bottle of syrup with how much I spend just to get my pancakes damp with the stuff. I understand charging for extra jellies, as they are all made in house... but come one... Syrup?!? I'd rather just bring some Aunt Jemima with me next time. I was also forced to buy honey to add to my tea in this same visit. I expected to get the expensive, thick, Greek honey upon paying for it, to my dismay, it was normal, every day honey. There goes another star.  The Smoothies are less than appetizing at Meli. I find that while they use fresh fruits, that they often taste watered down compared to what I receive at my gym, or even a Jamba Juice. Now to the entrees... The Spicy Flamenco - a large omelette with various peppers, chorizo, avocado slices and sour cream.  This is served with Baby red potatos and a slice of melon...AMAZING!  I have never left hungry after dining on this one of a kind breakfast gem. The Crab Cakes Benedict - Crab cakes and eggs benedict are both new additions to my edible repertoire.  I find that over time, I've been less impressed with this dish the more I order it. I've finally given up on it. The Cloud Nine Crepe - This is a fat kid's fantasy breakfast!!! This is a chocolate infused crepe served with sweetened marscapone, covered with fresh berries chocolate sauce and whipped cream. Dessert AND Breakfast, all wrapped up in one....excuse me, whilst I wipe the drool from my chin. The ""Mana Mou"" - Meaning most literally ""My mother"" and the self proclaimed mother of all skillets, it is jam packed with Angus steak, portobello, red onions, bell peppers, and topped off with Provolone.  I had to loosen my belt just typing that. I would however, advise you to leave yourself time to visit.  It isn't a Denny's or an IHOP. I used to eat at Meli nearly every week, but over the last several months I've barely visited. I find paying for extra maple syrup by the ounce to be ridiculous and frustrating.  That very next day, however, I returned with my friends for breakfast, after ordering nearly $75 worth of food for breakfast for 3 people, I had requested 2 dollars in quarters to feed the meter (pre paybox). The waitress returned only to hand me 4 quarters from the two $1 singles I had given her. She said I can only give you one dollar in quarters, so I asked if the other dollar was some sort of a service fee for change. She said no, but that the hostess would speak to me shortly about it. I received a visit from the hostess who took it upon herself to lecture me about their inability to provide everyone with change for the meters. But she was completely happy to accept my $75 for breakfast that day, and just over $50 the day before. Perhaps instead of speaking to your regular customers like children, you should take a lesson in customer service and economics. Those 4 quarters have cost you several hundred dollars in business. That cost will only go up over time, as I take my business to Yolk or Lou Mitchell's. All in all, Meli loses a star for the nickle & diming, and two stars for customer service. It's one thing to turn a customer down for change (minus one star) but another to speak down to and scold a customer for having the nerve to ask for an extra four quarters, which is where Meli loses the third star. I realize that this is harsh, but after being such a regular and loyal customer from day one and for bringing so many people in to Meli, I think I deserved a little more courtesy.",0.982,0.867,0.08,0.053,0.45230991230991247

They had to be one of the fastest places I have been to in awhile. I ordered a wrap with the pasta salad and eat every last bite. It was delicious! If you was looking for something different for lunch check it out! The service is great. and the interior was very well designed.",0.9502,0.793,0.164,0.043,0.5364583333333334
2007-06-15,4.0,"Lunched on breakfast (it's served all day here): ""Healthy choice"" French toast, on special today--multigrain bread dipped in vanilla custard, topped with pecans, blackberries and strawberries. Toast was moist, yet not too eggy, brightened by fruit and grounded by nuts. All flavors happily agreed in a perfectly sized portion that hit the spot. Melli's interior is lively, yet sophisticated. Service was adequate. I almost regret not pairing my meal with a cappuccino, but I definitely look forward to caffeinating my next visit.",0.9046,0.729,0.214,0.057,0.5404761904761904

Maybe I'm easy to please...but great breakfast food, fresh ingredients, good service, 5 stars for me.  I love any place where you can get breakfast all day, and Meli is no exception.  The orange-lemonade is fresh and tart.  The omelette's and Benedict's are made to perfection.  All of the fresh extras, like the homemade jams and honey butter, make everything here that much more special.  I recommend Meli for breakfast or lunch.  Enjoy!",0.9939,0.53,0.451,0.019,0.5888278388278387
2007-04-29,5.0,"My first visit to Meli brought forth promises of a quick return.  Outstanding.  They understand how to build flavors - my Gouda Omlette (oven baked and done so with cage-free eggs) was bacon, avocado, gouda and tomato - wow.  The smoothie was all all really great foods delicious.  Beautiful place too. I can't even think of a restaurant in Chicago that stacks up for breakfast.",0.974,0.704,0.296,0.0,0.7797619047619048
2007-04-14,5.0,"I love going to Meli for breakfast or brunch. It's located in the heart of Greektown and close to UIC so it's convenient to go in between classes. The crepes are excellent, and the few fries I stole off my brother's plate were probably the best fries I've had in a long time.",0.9201,0.795,0.205,0.0,0.48

They are amazing and sweet. I mean this in a respectful way, so don't give me the eye! I always order the denver omelet without ham. This omelet is huge and made with organic eggs. It is absolute heaven in your mouth. YUM! I have tried other dishes  on the menu and have never been disappointed. If you are ever in this neighborhood and are in the mood for some super fine breakfast food, step over to Meli's and have a fat omelet for me, please.",0.991,0.702,0.298,0.0,0.730654761904762
2007-02-28,5.0,"My sweetie and I found Meli while looking for someplace to eat in Greek Town. I walked away very pleased and impressed. It's well-lit without being too bright. You could have breakfast in there with a hangover and not feel blinded. We were greeted almost before we walked all the way through the door and were seated immediately. Fresh flowers on the larger tables--a touch I like.  I didn't know where to start on the menu, there's a variety of breakfast, brunch and lunch items ranging from skillets to sandwiches. Our server didn't mind giving us an extra couple minutes to look the menu, and unlike some places I've been, did not disappear completely, but came back after a short, reasonable wait. Kengo G. ordered a steak sandwich, I ordered a crab cake benedict and we both had salads. The salads were a plentiful portion of mixed greens with a light dressing, perfect for a starter. The crab cakes were so delicious, they didn't need the hollandaise sauce. Delicately spiced, yet full of flavor. The eggs were poached perfectly (to my tastes, anyway) with the yolk still having a little bit of run to it. The potatoes--the menu calls them baby reds--were absolutely delicious. I had a bite of the steak and whatever they used for marinade made the meat tender without overpowering it.  Our server was attentive, we never had to wait for a drink refill or the check. I left definitely wanting to come back and try what else was on the menu--the crepes sound fantastic!",0.9931,0.814,0.174,0.012,0.5692307692307692
2007-02-27,4.0,"Maybe it's my low blood pressure, which gives me a food-high after I eat, but this place made me and my stomach happy.    I stopped by for lunch today, and after much deliberation I ordered the roasted vegetable panini and their banana-nut/maple syrup shake.  The freshness of the vegetables was astounding, not only in their taste, but in their vibrancy of color.  They had a little brochure on the table expounding on the benefits of their eggs, which are from a local, soybean-fed, ''free range"" type farm.       The panini arrived fairly speedily, and was accompanied by red skinned potatoes. I normally don't order potatoes, but these were delicious, and not at all greasy.       The shake was hella expensive, at least to me, but in my savory vs. sweet quandary it was a good compromise.  It was fairly tasty but I was expecting more maple syrup.  One thing I was not expecting was this strange ice-creamesque/whipped cream/butter stuff on top..however it was quite good.",0.9712,0.773,0.16,0.067,0.5925
2007-02-26,5.0,"I'm impressed. My partner in crime, Kate K., and I went there for lunch. Kate had crab cake benedict, while I had the steak sandwich, each with a side salad. They were all quite excellent. The salads were not drowned in dressing as salads too frequently are these days. The bite of crab cake benedict tasted of real crabmeat, not some imitation. My steak sandwich was quite excellent, with a rather good cut of skirt steak, cooked to perfection, on a rather good bread. Served with baby red (potatoes), they were exceptional. Their service was also quite good -- our wait staff was incredibly conscientious. For example, at one point, I had accidentally dropped my napkin without realising it, and the busboy just grabbed it and went. Our server never blinked when we asked for either more time or just water to drink, and the refills were very timely and frequent. My only quibble -- never enough to drop a restaurant a star -- was their credit card receipts -- it prints out the entire card # on the merchant copy.",0.9721,0.803,0.157,0.04,0.5592105263157896
2007-02-11,2.0,"After hearing quite a bit about Meli, I was very disappointed in my experience.   On a busy Sunday morning for brunch, the place was quite crowded, there is not enough space to wait.  I was constantly having to dodge people as I tried to wait to be seated.   I ordered the scrambled eggs, potatoes, and the banana french toast.  The eggs were runny and tasted a little odd, potatoes ok, and the banana french toast was nothing special   I wouldn't go out  of my way to eat here.",-0.6929,0.888,0.023,0.089,0.3929761904761905
2006-11-03,5.0,"I've only been to Meli once for breakfast -- on the morning of the Chicago marathon -- and it was outstanding!  I had the Raspberry Marscapone French Toast - it was absolutely delectable.  I'm a hard person to please at breakast - I always regret getting salty over sweet or sweet over salty.  But not at Meli - the french toast was so amazing I had no room for regret!   The service was all pretty Greek girls (which reminded me of that one episode of Seinfeld) and they were very attentive.  Anyways, I highly recommend for a low key brunch!",0.9592,0.659,0.239,0.102,0.6237777777777779

They have fresh-squeezed juices, which is great, and the coffee is EXCELLENT.
