The trick I figured out was to take the pickle off, take a bite of the dog, then follow it with a bite of the pickle. There's less mess that way. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the fries were outstanding!

The hot dogs are good, but as someone pointed out they do every once in awhile give some hot dogs that are, well, grayish and bland(don't know why, last of the hot dog batch?). Their fries are great and never disappoint. The gyros are good but besides that I don't know about the rest of their food, I stick to the dogs and gyros. All the food is at a decent price.

Overall, undersized and not up to Chicago style standards. Gyros - They drench the pita in too much oil! Gross. Under cooked and scary. I had to throw mine away when I got it back home. It wasn't worth the trip back to correct the issue. Written off as a bad experience.  Italian Beef - Not bad.  The fries are ok, but sometimes they really short you on the quantity.
