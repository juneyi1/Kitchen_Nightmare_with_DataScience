2017-09-01,1.0,Tried to get in here because I heard they had good jerk chicken and they tried to charge us cover to get food to go. Just horrible. All I wanted was some good food not to party. They need a better system because I even called and the girl said nothing about cover. Horrible just horrible. I feel like they were discriminating against my boyfriend and I because we were young and their crowd seemed older. I am a food blogger too and I was so excited about this.

2017-05-27,3.0,"Neat concept. Reggae music, Jamaican food and tropical drinks.  The bar menu just seemed kind of hobbled together lacking foresight. A lot of the menu drinks were premixed I guess to save time. The bartender was nice and attentive but was unaware how to make a Jungle Bird. They were pretty busy when I went. I got jerk wings and they were OK. With so many places doing jerk chicken you would think place would be more creative with recipes. From an economists point of view I think it's noteworthy that the kitchen stays open so long think that brings people in. There was a cover, live music. The crowd had some sprinkles of old folks, tourists, some Jamaican folks, some African Americans. Randomly ran in 2 people I knew in high school.",0.8776,0.81,0.13,0.059,0.5938888888888889

The food was more than enough, and we could barely eat it all.  The fish was beautifully prepared with a sweet/spicy tomato sauce, rice & peas, and stewed peppers and onions. OMG! So darn good! The fish was so fresh and literally melted in our mouths!  The jerk wings were in a league of their own as well. The were beautifully smoked and you could actually taste the wood flavor from the smoking process. The jerk sauce was AMAZING!!!  When I visit Chicago, this is definitely my new favorite spot!  Oh, and the Rum Punch is legit too! I'm not even a fan of sweet drinks, but this drink definitely has a kick!  Entry fee was $5, but I didn't mind because the band was awesome as well! Oh yeah, did I forget to mention the live music? I was craving live music at 10:00 pm on a Sunday night, and thanks to Yelp, I found the perfect place! They don't close until 2 a.m. on Sundays too!

Tried to book a party and filled out the request online via website, followed up by a personal email, then followed up by 2 phone calls and voicemails. One week later, still no response! However, whomever is behind their Facebook page makes sure to update post hourly! Finally reached out via FB and had success. I got a robotic reply back saying my request for Thursday would be OK with some of the accommodations  (my request was for Saturday, and unspecified to what accommodations). Then after they thought to check the date they reply back with oh no, its a Saturday, only the one accommodation allowed. The robotic jerk proceeds to dance around questions and when asked for a phone call from manager, ""Ted no longer works here"". But he is listed on the site, has a working phone number and email. Didn't even bother to offer who the new manager is, if there even is one, the way they conduct business. The robot fires back with ""oh and we are booked for the date you requested."" Touchè right!? You weren't just booked before I asked for a manager though. Hmm. Nice way of saying we dont want your business. Well neither do I.

Whenever I'm in town I always meet up with an old pal from school and she frequently suggests this place. Had it not been for her, I would have never known I could get some delicious Caribbean food on the Northside. Let's talk about their food!  I've had their jerk chicken and whoo wee it's good, but so are many things on the menu. I'm a fan of their Jamaican patties, coconut shrimp, and oxtail platter. My biggest complaint about the Wild Hare is that several things are frequently not available. That sucks if you really have your heart set on oxtail and rice or a patty. Three of the four times I've been, they've had at least one thing unavailable on the menu.   Meh, not cool.

The bartender was doubling as the waitress which was fine since there were so few patrons but did make it a little challenging when we needed to get her attention for something.  As for the food, I was pleasantly surprised. The waitress informed us that their jerk is on the sweet side as opposed to being spicy. I didn't find it to be sweet at all but I thought that everything had a good flavor. I ordered the jerk chicken dinner for $14 though you have to add $1 to switch to jerk wings. I found the rice and beans to be a little dry and flavorless but the plantains, cabbage, and chicken were all excellent. I also ordered the rum punch which was delicious but pretty pricy at $12.

2015-10-04,4.0,"This famous Chicago landmark has always been on my list. When I lived in Chicago, I wasn't legal so now that I've got the credentials, I figured I would stop in with a friend from out of town. This was a completely random visit on a Saturday night. It was all street parking (free after 10pm!) with some parking by the Home Depot down the street. We walked in and there was cover (my buddy handled it but I assume it was $5-10/person) but free coat check. First you see a smallish bar with restrooms and can't possibly think you are in the right place. Follow the trail of swaying hips and you will snake around to a larger room and bar, with another room all the way in the back. The dance floor, with stage, is not very large but it was perfect for dancing. The crowd is African Americans, older (25-50 years of age) with definite island flavor mix in. There was a reggae band on stage and they were playing jams. We had a good amount of space to dance and it was just borderline packed. They don't seem to play a whole song. They constantly changed it up as if the drummer was steering the band.After about 20 minutes, the band disappeared with no timeline for their return so we decided to dance a bit then call it a night. It was still a good time. Drink prices are about what you would expect for the Northside. I got a honey Jack on the rocks for $8. They don't have some things that you would need for a premium cocktail (I couldn't get a Manhattan or a Sidecar) so think island and you will fit right in. My friend double fisted a Red Stripe and Jack on the rocks while we body rolled the night away. The Hare is jumping until 3am and around 1am the crowd was still manageable. I will definitely go back when I want to do some late night dancing like no one's watching.",0.9818,0.848,0.114,0.038,0.44576876115337655

2015-09-08,2.0,"I was expecting to be wowed away. You can look at the stars and see that I wasn't. The first problem was that there was almost no parking. I had to park on some side street down a back block. The second issue is that we had to pay for entry. Im like whoa, we were just going to eat. We walk in there isn't a lot of people here. Its pretty diverse with ages and ethnicity. So we took a seat at the bar the bartender was cool. Not to attentive but ok i guess. The inside looks like an old school bar with so tropical feel to it. I normally wont talk about an establishments bathroom. However the bathroom for guys at least breaks every man code imaginable. There are no toilets or urinals. There is only one long sink/tub with water running in it with a couple of drains in it. That poses a problem, no separation, no stalls yea i think not.  We ordered a side of fries and some of the jerk wings. The fries didn't taste fresh at all but I have had worse. The chicken was OK, I have had jerk wings and they are usually more charred or crispy. There weren't bad at all its just the texture and how soft they were threw me off quite a bit. The seasoning was good. There was a live band playing on the opposite side and we had no idea. I walked over to see another bar and a couple of tables. There were a few people scattered. I like reggae actually i love reggae. I like dub, ska, dancehall and roots. I would have like to have heard some upbeat reggae. We went on a Friday night around 10. There wasn't a lot going on. I was surprised by this. I think I need to go back on a different day for the music. I'm sure the food will be the same. So i will eat before hand.",0.9836,0.769,0.156,0.075,0.4900925925925925

It was predominantly black, but as the night went on there was some diversity. After buying 2 long islands (the typical Chicago $12 each price), I got out there on the dance floor. There was no live band that night, just DJ's, which is exactly what I was hoping for. Several different DJ's took turns spinning the hottest reggae mixes that got the floor crowded and moving. Seriously, those were some good DJs.  As the floor got more and more packed and with a younger crowd, the DJ's got better but to be honest this place could do without the ""island freakum team"" bouncing their vaginas hard up and down on the floor. I mean don't get me wrong y'all. l love when other people dance and have fun; the more the better, which is why I had a blast turning up with dancer Sol (Sol runs a dance class there during the week) and some nice Haitian ladies.

2015-05-26,4.0,First time at the Wild Hare was amazing. Went to this place on sunday at 6pm because the ramen place next door was closed on sunday. We said why not and had no idea what kinda food it was. Walked in right when they opened to a wonderful hostess who was nice the entire time.  Never had Caribbean food before but knew that the go to item was the jerk chicken. Amazing right off the bat. It was presented beautifully and not just something that was slopped on. Came with a side of plantains that was cooked that melted in your mouth and you wish you had more. I am not a fan of spicy food at all. I had jerk chicken and the taste and spice was not what i thought it would be. It was a little bit spicy but not overwhelming that took away from the flavor of the chicken. The combo of rice and jerk chicken was perfect to compliment each other. Drinking a red stripe was the icing on the cake to make this meal complete.  I am currently on a diet but I know that this is on my hit list to go to again. Very glad to have stumbled upon this place.,0.9761,0.794,0.153,0.052,0.6521904761904761

The entire feel of the place is dated and the lackluster sound coming from what they call a sound system is simply insulting.

Now it's hard for me to discern what this piece of black nastiness was however I am quite sure that it shouldn't have been there. The server was very prompt in returning the drink and offered me another although I politely declined.

2015-05-17,1.0,"I hate to do this to wild hare because I LOVE the club...the music is off the chain if you actually love reggae and dance hall.  So the club gets four stars (although maybe more ventilation or ac on the main floor would be good cause it is hot, sweaty and funky down there..I go directly to vip...uninvited.)  But I experienced something tonight that is illegal and got my attention. I ordered jerk wings from the station in the front of the club and the guy taking the order (Derrick he said his name was) took my money and slighted me almost a dollar in change.  When I noticed I stated you owe me change (probably 79 cents.) He said ""We round up.""  Meaning he wasn't giving the change.  I looked at him as if he were insane...we round up?  You don't get to round up...that is illegal.  your prices are as stated...the taxes are as stated..either round the taxes and price so you can give as little change as possible or provide change but you do not get to keep the customers money.  I notified him that this is illegal and that I was contacting the BBB (which I am.)  He offered me a comp meal etc...but I decided that it would be better to keep everyone from being fleeced by these scum bags then to get a free meal. Seems like a small thing right?  But it is not for a few reasons.  1. They are getting cash tax free from the customers that likely equals $100s of dollars per night.  It goes unreported and they don't ""ask"" you for it so it is essentially stealing.  2. It bothers me because the clientele is largely Black and or foreign so I guess they think we don't know any better (insulting.) 3.  I thought this was a minority owed business (I could be wrong) so why is the owner allowing this person to take advantage of his loyal customers.  We drink there, we dance there, we will eat there...but you must be respectful and not rob your customers...not even of 5 cents.  It is wrong and it adds up.  I wanted to leave this tonight.  I am contacting the BBB in the am.    Don't allow yourself to be scammed...not for a dime...money is tight and people should not be taken advantage of because they have been drinking...I guess I wasn't drunk enough.",0.9663,0.819,0.11,0.071,0.5746329365079365

This place says it is wheelchair accessible which is important for me because I am in  wheel chair. But the entrance was so small and narrow that I could barely get through. Not to mention that as soon as you finally get through the door the bar area is immediately right there.  Once in no one really greeted us or gave us direction on where to sit so we wandered around a bit.

My friend went to the counter three different times and an hour after ordering we finally got our food.  And guess what...you got it it was cold.

The bartenders are among the fastest and nicest in Chicago. The artists who perform there are amazing. Only two big negatives: The dj's can't mix well ,and they love the sound of their own voices.  ALWAYS talking over the songs, and this is annoying as hell.  Bad enough to listen to bad mixing breaking up the vibe, but talking/screaming is for the clubs that the youngins go to, not for the reggae club.  The only thing worse than a dj who can't mix is a dj who can't mix and talks all over the beat like Clue.  Fortunately, they only play when the bands are done.  Let's put it like this.  Almost all the dj's get one star, especially the main one, and the club gets 4 1/2 otherwise. Also there is an emmcee who interrupts the performers at every show with this lame call and response routine.  Audiences come to see a performane, not to perform.  NOBODY wants to PAY to see a show and have it predictably interrupted EVERY TIME with the whole Do you want one more song?  Do you want two more songs?   You're not loud enough.  Everybody say ""Irie!""   -  Dear God, just shut up and get off the stage so we can hear the band, and stop telling the crowd they're not loud enough!  Normal people don't go to a reggae club to scream!

It was disappointing, but the bartender was really nice and they did have some Ginger Beer :) The inside was deceiving at first. We thought that it was just a bar with a small stage and a little window to the kitchen, but after I headed to the Ladies' Room, I saw there was a whole other half! More dancing space, tables, bigger stage, and bigger speakers with louder music. Much better on that side for dancing, or sitting in a booth to people-watch dancers as you sip your drink. I enjoyed my time there. Music was a great mix of old and new reggae, and some soca too. It is great to find a place here that feels authentic with Caribbean vibes:)  Will definitely come back soon!",0.9885,0.787,0.188,0.025,0.5697261072261072

I've been going here with my folks for the past few weekends & I am now addicted! Have yet to have dinner at the place but have been breaking a sweat with my husband jukin to the reggae tunes. I knock back a few drinks & lose myself in the music. When I do go, my man & I are the couple that get the party started, the ones that make you go ""I can't believe they did all that!"". That's how good the music & the atmosphere make you feel.  The bartender is cool, tip him & he'll give you a couple of free drinks. They have this long seating bench that makes giving lap dances easy, (no it's not a strip joint, at least when you're sober lol). Have seen the private room, looks nice but never partied in it. The bathroom does suck, it has very small stalls in the women's but it's not like much time is spent there anyways. Still had to give the place 5 stars because I make the fun when I get there. No one's arguing, no one's fighting, it's not the kind of rowdy club that you have to bring a shank or worry about getting shanked. It's pure fun, or at least what we make of it.

We tried the guac with chips and those chips were plantains. They were kind of awesome. Post that I had the rasta pasta, and dinner buddy had the jerk tilapia. The portions are super large, enough for 2 to share, even if you have a good appetite. I wouldnt say the food was amazing, but it was well cooked and had a home made feel to it.  The place itself looks like a big bar, with some seating on the side for diners. The bathrooms are a little oddly placed, but what bothered me more was the lack of toilet paper in some of them.

It's a shame I can't add photos to my review because they say it all.  EVERYTHING we ordered (and they were 5 of us) was beautifully presented from the appetizers to the deserts.  I strongly recommend the jerk chicken -- large portions and perfectly seasoned.  It came with a pyramid of seasoned rice and a green vegetable (not sure what it was but it was every bit as good as the chicken).  Another favorite was the coconut encrusted tilapie.  To finish off the perfect meal, we ordered the plantain/mango split and the sweet potato bread pudding -- both were delictable!

Also, they were out of half of the things (Menu items, beers, etc.) that we asked for. I'm not even mad, I'm just disappointed - never before has a place that has gotten just such good Yelp reviews been so bad.  To be honest, the food was actually tasty (Albeit ranging from cold to lukewarm in temperature), but I simply can't condone a bar taking over an hour and a half  to deliver food. And it wasn't just the food - when they delivered the appetizer, they didn't bring plates. And evidently we forgot to ask for silverware when we asked for the plates because we had to eat the appetizers without silverware. They also forgot drink orders multiple times and rarely checked on us.

One room houses the bar as well as some high tables for dining, second room has a stage as well as dining seating and third room is closed for now until business picks up (which I'm sure is soon). Once they get their music license they will have late night reggae performance, now back to the food .  The menu selection is not the biggest, but of great quality (oh so I think!!!!). If you're going with a huge group or want to get your money's worth definitely get the spinach deep appetizer its delish and pretty big. If you want something heavenly go with the coconut shrimp. When it comes to main dishes I recommend the jerk salmon. It was cooked to perfection and the flavor was amazing. My boyfriend had the tilapia and that was pretty delishes as well, but in my opinion the salmon takes first place hands down.

None of us even feigned interest.  Anyways, drinks were ok, price to get in was ridiculous and the music was just ok.  If you're into reggae, check it out.

2008-10-28,2.0,"Went here a few weekends ago after Uberstein got too crowded & my friends got too drunk. While one friend was pulling on one arm to go to another wrigleyville bar, the other was pulling on my other arm pulling me towards Wild Hare Ltd. Much to my surprise everyone agreed upon Wild Hare. I was a bit turned off by the cover charge (you know being a girl & all, I kind of forget that people, mainly men, have to do this quite frequently), but when a kind soul offered to pay I thought-what the hell & went in. Little did we know what we were in for... First of all, I walked in with 4 friends & quickly realized we stuck out like sore thumbs. We were a)the only white kids there, b) had no idea what band was playing, and c) had no idea how to dance to Reggae. This wasn't anything a few Miller Light's couldn't fix. By the end of the night I was directly in front of the stage dancing like no one was watching. I didn't care how much of an idiot I looked like-I was having a good time! The music was great & seemed to go on forever. It was something I'll never forget. I doubt I'll be back though just because it wasn't somewhere I felt comfortable or welcomed whatsoever. Also, when my friend Beth asked for a cup of water the bartender said no. Umm, hello-that's awful. I then proceeded with ""can she get a cup of ice then?"" & the bartender was just not having it.

The drinks can be a bit expensive but I normally stick to the Red Stripe.  Avoid asking the bar tender for a shot of ""something jamaican"" as one of my alcohol intolerant friends had.   You will likely end up with something called ""Overproof"" which tastes a lot like rubbing alcohol and shoe polish.    The $12 cover is a bit much but its worth it for the live music.",0.9057,0.843,0.136,0.021,0.5514141414141416

Many of the folks there were lost Cubs fans, dancing in that embarrassing ""this is how white dudes get down"" sorta way. It  hurt to watch. Other dudes were trolling for late night love, and were pretty persistent in strategically dancing nearer and nearer to their chosen targets, and striking up conversations when you clearly wanted to just groove, or asking you to please leave with them. Naw thanks, daddy-O, I'm here for the music. There were four very entertaining, probably pretty regular fellas who were jiving right next to the stage and were all about loving everybody. One of them roped me in and we jumped around before he hopped on stage to help the singer out. I don't remember who was singing that night, but he was passioinate about w33d (read: sang about the delights of ganja for a solid 15 minutes) and took a half hour break to go mackin' and get some phone numbers. Hilarious. The drinks were out of this world expensive ($7.50 for a vodka tonic. Yowch!) so I would suggest, for maximum enjoyment of the Wild Hare, that you get rip roaringly drunk beforehand, and then all of those  awkward unlikeable things about it will just disappear and it will be just you, reggae and wonderful people.

Again, I was disappointed by the $12 cover (we went on a Friday so I'm not sure if it's usually that much), but the guy cut us a deal and let us in for 1/2 off. We got there around midnight and the place was only mildly crowded - maybe a lower cover would produce more of a crowd.  When we got there the band was still setting up and sound checking, but they had on a mix of reggae standards, which was great. Then the band took the stage and began to play, which was awesome. I was bummed that I had been out all day and at that point was running out of steam. I really would like to have stayed longer than I did and hear more of the band.

Definitely feeling the fellowship in that place... the vibes were Irie, the red stripe was flowing, and I might have even thrown back a few incredible hulks. All I'm saying is that the whole place was grooving hard. I smelled some funny smoke in the bathroom, and being a couple of the only white folks in the joint, we got some comments like ""Damn, you dance pretty good for a white boy""... which really was awesome... ha!
