2016-01-16,1.0,Concessions at the United Center are way over priced for the quality of food they deliver.  Levy Restaurants has their hands in this mess as well. But my guess is the Wirtz family hardly cares as people spend $8 for a crappy beer,0.0341,0.724,0.149,0.127,0.2722222222222222
2015-12-28,3.0,"So so when they have Prime Rib on the carving station, only a 1 star when they serve anything else. Very Pricey - When you bring the kids, expect $4 per coke, no free refills !",0.3382,0.838,0.1,0.061,0.7000000000000001
2015-11-02,4.0,"I stopped by for dinner before the Bulls game and left very happy with my experience. The food is a buffet, no a la carte options, with a pretty good selection. They had salads, seafood, cheese, a carving station, a dessert station and a few others. The service was friendly and for roughly $50 a person, I didn't think it was that expensive considering you're in the United Center. If I have the option to spend $20 for a sandwich and a drink at one of the stands in the stadium, I think this is a much better deal.",0.9422,0.769,0.19,0.041,0.4818181818181818
2013-01-07,4.0,"I was somewhat to very skeptical about this place before going. However, I had tickets to a 7p Bulls game on a Saturday night and unless I wanted to eat at like 5p somewhere else, then deal with parking, walking, etc. this seemed like a decent spot. My buddy has club seats so he made us the reservations. Seemed a bit odd as we tried to enter the club level that they were really policing it. Some old guy in a decent looking outfit was trying to get in and find his friends, and the usher was having no part of it. I almost told the usher he was with us, but didnt. Anyway, get into the place and it was a bit more fine dining than I had originally imagined. I still did not feel out of place in my Derrick Rose jersey, but had I not been there for the game, I would have been under dressed. What can I say about it. It is an upscale buffet. 4 of us were taken to our seats, offered drinks (they had some fun ones as well as regular drinks), given the menu, explained how the plates work, offered soup app, that they bring to the table, and we were off. The buffet itself was nice. They had a nice assortment of apps and main courses. Some area of note on the apps were shrimp, tuna steak encrusted with something, I do not recall, several different types of salad. (FYI for the vegetarians, there is a nice assortment here for you), My veg mother came back with a large plate. Main courses were nice as well. They had salmon, short ribs, chicken, pasta, etc. They also had plenty of sides, breads, and desserts. It was a good show. I really appreciated all the TV's that showed the game as it started. We did not have to run out and leave before we were done. The to go cup system was also nice. Whether coffee, tea, or booze, they gave us a cup to go.",0.9912,0.855,0.127,0.018,0.5151831501831502
2012-09-24,5.0,"When I went to my first Chicago Bulls game at the United Center I also got to eat at the ""Chicago Stadium Club at the United Center"".  I thought that the food was very good although a little high --- $51.00 for one (no alcohol) with tip.  Still, it was a great experience.",0.9168,0.773,0.227,0.0,0.4379166666666667

2012-02-23,4.0,"Been here a few times. If you get there right when they open then you'll be ok. If you get there late then your basically getting sloppy seconds, or thirds, or forth, you get the picture. But seriously, The food is usually very good and the dessert table is outstanding.",0.8268,0.802,0.167,0.03,0.5897089947089946
2011-10-28,5.0,"Useually stadium food is typical burgers, fries and hotdogs. That is not the case at all here. While I was a bit worried about what would be on this buffet before actually going here I was plesently surprised when we arrived. The decor is very eligent, more like a nice resturant on Michigan ave then a place in a stadium. THe buffet was well kept with many differnt people tending to it to make sure the food was displayed nicely. The food on the buffet was all top quality and much better then I expected (this is no old country). Our server was also very friendly and helpful. While the food here is on the pricy side you at least leave feeling you got a great meal and plenty to eat. All and all the best stadium food I have had.",0.9831,0.734,0.23,0.035,0.5522875816993464
2010-03-11,5.0,"Buffet is typically a receipt for disaster.  This place treats you right and the food for a sporting-event restaurant is expectional.   We went here last night without a reservation (suppose to have one).  They let us know that they are completely booked for the evening but should know within an hours time if something should open up. They invited us to wait by the bar, so we did...as the four of us are being handed a drink by the bartender, the hostess finds us and asks if we would like to be seated, that was super quick, i didn't even get a sip of my cocktail in before we got seating.  Our waitress was extremely friendly and very accommodating (she brought short ribs, which were really good,  to the table because they were mysteriously hard to find). The shrimp saffron was ridiculous and the prime rib was to perfection.  The buffet was absolutely good. - the one at cellular field doesn't even come close.     We stuffed ourselves and then had dessert (get the white chocolate mousse) with a cup of coffee all in the nick of time to get out to our seats to watch a tribute to Denis Savard.   The game was outstanding as we watched the Hawks win a see-saw battle, including two fights, with the Kings in come back fashion in Overtime!!",0.9833,0.793,0.15,0.056,0.4571428571428572
2010-01-15,4.0,"I came to the restaurant before the hawks game, and had the buffet. It was pretty good. I ate soooo much food I could barley walk afterwards. The short ribs were out of this world, and the fondue desserts were fantastic!!!!",0.8057,0.832,0.168,0.0,0.5666666666666667
2009-11-15,1.0,"Absolutely horrible.  Food takes forever, and the $17 burger I ordered was supposed to be medium-rare but came out so well done that it was black and burned all the way through.  Saw our server only twice in the 1.5 hours we were there.  Save the hassle and order a hot dog from a vendor.",0.759,0.826,0.133,0.04,0.8208333333333334
2007-10-25,3.0,"I have been going to the United Center for years and had no idea that this place existed.  Yet on a recent Sunday night- prior to the Springsteen concert (BRUCE!!) I had the opportunity to eat here.   This restaurant , located on the ""Lexus level"" has about 300 seats, a full bar and is open before all games and events.  If you don't have a seat on the Club level- you can still eat here but you need to make reservations so that your name is on the list and they let you in (enter at Gate7) prior to the event.  We had the right level seats and a reservation so we were promptly whisked to our table.  The waiter takes your drink order, and then explains the buffet.   Now for those of you who know me- you know buffets are so not my thing.  This one was okay- food smelled good and was replenished often.  There were appetizers (fresh shrimp, cheese plate, crudite, and quesadillas) several different salads, sides and entrees.  The entrees on the night I was there were quartered chicken, beef in gravy and a carving station for prime rib. The food was passable given what they were trying to do- which is move 300 people through before a concert.  My only complaint was that the bread basket seemed to have been left over from another day as the rolls were hard and crumbly. My favorite part?  You can order a bottle of wine to go and they will open it and provide you with the glasses to drink at your seats.  Also- if you need to go to your seat and haven't finished your drink- no problem.  At the exit, there are large plastic glasses that you just pour your drink into and you are on your way. Nice! As for the price?  I thought it was a little pricey for a buffet ($50 per person with one drink).  For the same $50 we could have eaten at another restaurant nearby and had our food served to us.  But you can't beat it for convenience, that's for sure! Finally-I laughed that a restaurant in a sporting venue has a dress code but this place does.  No shorts, torn jeans or t-shirts. Wear those and you'll find yourself sitting in the penalty box.",0.6836,0.883,0.063,0.054,0.4587936507936508
