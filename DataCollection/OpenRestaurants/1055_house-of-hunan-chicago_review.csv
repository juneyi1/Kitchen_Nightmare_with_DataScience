Egg Rolls: soggy but slightly flavorful. If these weren't so soggy they'd be more passible. Crab Rangoon: Soggy undercooked dough overshadowed the flavor. Not sure how you mess this one up. Szechwan Broccoli: A very thin and spicy sauce was on the bottom but the broccoli itself was mostly flavorless and just hot in terms of after taste of the spice.  Broccoli itself was cooked decently and could have been good if there was something to it other than just heat. Mongolian Beef: Very little flavor of any sort. Soggy shoots of some sort underneath and the beef was fairly tough.  Zero flavor, but perhaps my pallette was still on fire from the broccoli. Tiny peppers and tiny onions. Kung Pao Chicken: Tasteless other than some heat.  Hard to tell from eating it that it was different from the beef other than that it was more tender, and i could definitely denote the peanuts.   White Rice: The highlight of the main course, not that it was good, but this in itself says something. Normally I barely touch the white rice and throw it away. If I could tell them to give me less I would.  But here it was the only thing I could cut some of the excessive heat with.

The Kung Pao chicken is my #2 dish.  It's spicy and served with diced vegetables and peanuts.  I agree with some critics that when served immediately it can be bland.  I prefer to order the Kung Pao exclusively for take out to give the sauce time to marinate over the chicken.  When this happens their Kung Pao is awesome. The Hot and Sour soup is some of the best I've ever had and I've scoured much of Chicago in search of good hot and sour.

Better than I'd expected- the vegetables were all fresh and crispy, and the beef tender. I also liked my neighbor's black bean chicken. ""Spicy"" here is not very. I think tastes are geared for the Midwestern vs. the Hunan palate. I would probably order extra spicy the next time. Hot and sour soup was pretty flavorful, but lacking in tofu.

I ordered sweet and sour chicken with crab rangoons, egg rolls, and wanton soup. I feel like that's a pretty standard order to judge a chinese restaurant by.  The wantoon soup was the only part of the order that was good/on par with other restaurants in the area. The next best was the egg rolls, which I could muscle down, but had a little too much cabbage/cabbage flavor for my tastes. The crab ranggoons were pure cream cheese, which is awful. I need to devote an entire paragraph to how terrible the sweet and sour chicken was. Firstly, the chicken, rice, and sweet and sour sauce were all served in separate containers, which I admit isn't a big deal but slightly inconvenient. My issues arise with how little flavor the sweet and sour sauce has and how little of it they give you compared to the chicken and rice. The chicken itself is so heavily deep fried that you can't even pierce it with a fork! In any given bite of chicken, you get 40% deep fried breading / 60% chicken. I actually prefer crispy chicken in my chinese food, but this is absurd and I can feel myself getting fatter as I eat it.  I got delivery and that part worked fine enough for me. Portions are huge, but if the food is somewhere between mediocre and terrible, what's the point.  I wanted to give a fair review and as such I listed the positives along with my complaints.

Used their online ordering service to get food from here a couple of weeks ago and something went wrong with the payment.

It could have turned into a huge fiasco, but they ended up just calling me back and saying that they understood that the money had come off my card and that they would send the food out. The woman said she would call me if they couldn't locate my payment by the next day, but no one ever called so I'm assuming they figured out the error.  I ordered from here again yesterday and they forgot the pineapple smoothie that was supposed to go with my order. They forgot it, and when I realized that 20 minutes into eating my food I called them right away. The woman on the phone apologized about a million times and said that they would send one over immediately. Needless to say, I got my shake in about 10 minutes and they had clearly made me a new one because it was still frozen and frosty. Might I add that it was also superbly delicious! Thanks for having great customer service and really knowing how to deal with problems House of Hunan!

The sauce wasn't bad, but the actual chicken had that weird taste to it.  I ordered it as take out and when I got home, I discovered a bag of what looked like wontons that I saw the lady stuffing in the restaurant (I went at an off-hour).

2012-01-22,4.0,"This review is almost 2 years in the making. Basically, it's about darn time I got around to writing it.  Anywho, my husband & I moved to LP in July 2010 and were pretty thrilled to be fairlly close to a Chinese place. Our first trip was dining in. Good experience, but for whatever reason, we've become solely takeout people. It's all good though. We love the food. My only gripe is occasionally the sesame chicken (our go-to order) is dry. Other than that, everything we've ordered has been good. Egg drop soup is yummy, and the won ton soup is amazing. LOVE it. I got home from Christmas with the family and had missed it so much I ordered it three days in a row. Oops!  Like I said, we mostly order sesame chicken. It's really good. Just the right amount of spice and yummy flavor. General Tso's is also really good, a bit spicier than the sesame. It tastes good and is also good for clearing out the sinuses.  Fried rice is also good, egg rolls are good, sweet & sour chicken is decent (but not our favorite). We haven't had anything bad from there. Even when the chicken is slightly dry, it's still pretty good.  All in all, we get food from there fairly often and it's pretty darn good. The sugared crispy cracker-like baked noodle things (the real name escapes me right now, but it's definitely not that!) they throw in with the takeout is a nice bonus. Taste pretty good too. The non sugared version is really good with soups, but I don't know if they have them or not (I would assume so, since HOH is the only place I've seen them with sugar-they probably do that themselves). The owner is a really nice guy. A few times we've needed to pick up food a little past closing, and they never mind. He told us one time that he's always there till 10:30 anyway (days when they close at 10), so it's not a problem. Still, we don't like to do that often, only when we're trying to get home from the gym and the bus is slow. Really nice of them to let us pick up after closing, and we always make sure to be no more than 10 minutes late. Great service and friendly staff help to make this place a success.

I've ordered out from the House of Hunan on three separate occasions, offering a decent sampling of their menu: egg rolls, Wonton soup, Hot 'n' Sour soup, General Tso's Chicken, Sesame Chicken, and Beef with Broccoli. At this point, I could describe each of those dishes, but to save time and to avoid boring you, I'll just elaborate on the General Tso's, since it was a little different than what I was expecting.   First off, I've never understood the disparity in this dish from restaurant to restaurant.  You would think that a dish crafted by a military leader and master statesman would have some sort of consistency, if not strict rigidity, to how it's made.  Especially coming from China--I mean, c'mon, did you see the exactitude of the Olympic opening ceremony last year?  However, I've had all sorts of variations on this dish. House of Hunan's take on it is this: deep-fried chicken combined with various fresh veggies and pineapple in a sweet, slightly spicy, brown sauce.  Pineapple?  Never encountered that before in General Tso's before; apparently the Chinese army shares a similar ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy.  But I have to say, it was a welcome addition--especially since I love pineapple. Other than the General Tso's, I'd have to say all the other dishes are solid and what you would come to expect from your average Americanized Chinese restaurant.  And while I wasn't overly wowed by any of the above, I'd have to say, if asked, I'd definitely recommend House of Hunan as a decently priced, quick Chinese delivery option.",0.9777,0.863,0.107,0.03,0.4356481481481482

2008-11-01,4.0,"Oh House of Hunan, how I desire to give you that 5th star....but my combo appetizer of a fried food pile was just room temperature and some of it was slightly mushy. This crunch queen of texture was let down. Could it have been the big ole styrofoam box the appetizers came in? Probably but I doubt it since my fried eggplant appetizer came as perfectly fried as in the restaurant and it too was in a smaller styro box. Could you have earned that 5th star if there would have been a scrumptious sauce to go along with the perfectly fried non mushy eggplant? Possibly. Your egg roll had one of the best flavors of an egg roll I've had in a long time but again, the mush factor turned me off. The fried shrimp wasn't over breaded or cooked but again, it was missing the 20% of the crisp factor. The chicken wing, well let's just say I don't usually associate with such boring plain fried chicken. The beef satay was tasty with its peanutty sauce on it and the yummy green pepper slice, onion slice and chunk of pineapple. Thank you for your extra crab rangoon but no thank you for the filling area of it be missing it's crunch. I guess I could have put all your fried goodness's in the oven to crisp you all up but after a Halloween drinking binge last night, not eating all day and my dying of hunger I couldn't wait another second to eat. I will rave about your combo lo mien. Yes, I asked for it a little spicy and it was perfect. The shrimp, beef and chicken were all cooked just right. The noodles weren't over cooked spaghetti noodles...you made them seem like something special. The few veggies in it were cooked so they still had the slight bite to them that they were supposed to have. Seriously HOH your lo mien kicked ass! Ok I am a sucker for fortune cookies. I love the ones that are locally produced that you give out. For some reason they taste better and have a better crunch and not that airy styrofoam texture...ok my styrofoam and crunch references will soon end... Not only do you get fortune cookies, but you also gave me some fried wonton strips for free. They hit the spot!! I haven't had those since I was a child and we'd get them at our local Chinese food restaurant. I LOVE those things to finish a meal, especially with a cup of hot tea! I am in gluttony heaven right now. Oh yes HOH, you took 1 hour and 15 minutes on a Saturday evening to bring me my food.Oh how you put my fried goodness in a big ole styrofoam box which just made you sweat and turn to mush.
