2017-01-24,3.0,"I went here because I was in the area and I did a Yelp search for good restaurants nearby and this place popped up. I was disappointingly underwhelmed. The food was not bad, it just wasn't great. If I am going to be honest, I was every so slightly turned off by their process. It's one of those places that you can tell caters to regulars. As soon as I walked in, the guy screamed, ""What can I get you?!?"" AS-SOON-AS I walked in. No time to look at the menu board, nothing. I tried overlook that and ask questions and I'm not sure if there was a language barrier or he was a firm believer in not working outside his job description of just making the food but I was irritated. While I appreciate the fact that the food was very fresh (I could both taste and see the freshness) but unfortunately it had no flavor whatsoever, which makes the food star rating a 2. The third star is for the following: the salsa, the watermelon juice (totally wanted to take my shoes off and throw on a sundress), and the thing that totally made my 30s---FINALLY getting enough napkins in a carry out order. The cashier lady totally rocks for that. Even though this review gives every indication that I would not return, I definitely will...I just won't make a special trip here. There are so many great reviews on here that I am hopeful that this was just an off day. Will return and post accordingly...",-0.8868,0.819,0.065,0.115,0.5687452758881331

The burritos are great.  They're about the size of a nerf football.  It's a counter service place with plenty of tables.  The counter staff are fast, friendly, and courteous.  It had been quite a while since I'd been here.  I had a wake to attend that was in the neighborhood which didn't occur to me until I eyeballed some familiar places.  After the wake I located the place with the help of my brother's memory.  I was pleased the place was exactly as I remembered it.  Burritos still huge and excellent.  Staff still friendly.",0.9786,0.807,0.179,0.014,0.6248958333333333

The chorizo is bursting with flavor and cooked to a slightly well-done consistency that is just wonderful. The cheese, tomatoes, and onions compliment the meat beautifully. Unlike many burritos, there are no beans and rice, at least not as far as i could tell, but the flavors are spectacular and abundant. I recommend adding avocado, as well.

2010-09-10,5.0,"Who here wants to go to Hell or burn in the Lake of Fire forever? Eternal damnation anyone? If you do want any of these things, then DO NOT go to Huentitan, because it is a sin that you'll never taste the best tacos, tortas or burritos in the world.  I left Chicago 6 years ago and I currently live in South Florida. In 6 years, I have looked everywhere for a descent tasting taco that can rival the authentic Mexican flava (that's right, flava) of Chicago. I live in Sunrise, Florida which is west of Fort Lauderdale and I thought I had managed to finally find a taco/burrito joint in Homestead, Florida - about an hour and a half away. That's right, the best tasting taco/burrito's are over an hour away and guess what? My wife and I make the trek whenever we have a hankering for some authentic Mexican food. You heard right, I'll drive that far for food that good. So, for the last 3 years or so, this Mexican joint became my de facto burrito spot because it had that long lost flavor that I so long for, up until last weekend. You see, that's when my wife and I visited Chicago and I told her we have to stop by this Mexican restaurant because they have the best food ever. We had eaten breakfast earlier so she wasn't that hungry. We ordered a Burrito and a taco to go - the burrito was for later and we decided to split the taco. Walking back to the car my wife was unwrapping our foiled taco, she sat in the front while I secured my overstuffed burrito in our bag. I get to the front and notice she's already bit into the taco. I immediately recognized the expression on her face since I've seen it before, I won't go into the specifics of where or how I've seen it but Iet's just say that the last time I saw that face was during ""le petit mort."" The next words out of her mouth, with her eyes closed where, ""fuck you, get your own."" That's right, they were that damn good that I had to back up and get another one! We got out and ordered two more burritos and one extra taco. The extra two were now officially heading to Miami with us, as for the extra taco, it survived long enough to get us to downtown...so long little taco, you will be missed.That taco was so good that I didn't go to the bathroom for 3 days because I didn't want to get rid of it. If you don't eat a taco at Huentitan, a bunny will die. If you don't eat a torta there, a slow and cuddly labrador pup will be drowned, if you don't eat a burrito there, you're offically a communist. So, ask yourself, do you want to kill little animals and read Marxist literature while wearing a Che Guevara t-shirt? If you do, then you don't deserve to eat here. If you however, are a peace loving American who likes to eat and wants to dig into a big fat-ass motherf*!@ing burrito with mad flavor then God bless you because one day you will make it to heaven; unlike those monsterous pinkos.",-0.7715,0.836,0.077,0.087,0.3569139194139194

Also not to mention that there is always a cop or a security officer inside. It didn't seem so much as a bad neighborhood, but well, they are there for a reason.  As I saw the person before me order, I noticed the huge portions that they serve. I mean HUGE! H-U-G-E! I ordered a taco with everything and decided to share it with my husband. As I went back to our car which we had 15 minutes worth in the meter, I opened my overly stuffed taco, took a bite, and screamed... STOP! I asked my husband to stop the car because  I was not sharing this taco,  it was too damm good and he needs to go back in and get his own. YES... It was that good! It was amazing. The flavors of the taco were dead on. A true authentic Mexican flavor Not to mention that I also bought 3 burrito's to go, they wrapped them nicely and securely since those burritos made it to Miami that very same day. I had it for lunch the next day and it was amazing! I shared it with a co-worker since I could not eat it all. Seriously, it was good! They too were seasoned just perfect! The ingredients were fresh. Everything was home made and the meat is cut in the back and constantly being brought to the front.",0.9923,0.738,0.191,0.071,0.502962962962963

2010-06-20,2.0,"well the reviews were great so i decided to try this and here is the TRUTH. Service-5 stars food- 3 stars price-5 stars ambiance-1 star This is the type of place where you order and pick up. Dining in is fast and they are attentive, but i did not like the feel of the place and going there felt a little dangerous. And the food was ok, but here is the deal with the food there. Basically they have all the ingredients premade and when you want something different, say a taco or a tortas or a burrito they just wrap the meat cheese and avacodo in something different. And the meat was not good quality.  If you want to impress someone do not take them here. Come here if you are low on money and starving! I had the tacos and the tortas and taco salad. By mistake i tried eating the shell of the taco salad. And let me warn you DO NOT DO THIS! IT tasted very old and i think it was sitting there for a LONG TIME, i feel sick!",-0.9216,0.792,0.079,0.13,0.5974725274725274

2009-11-09,3.0,"My husband says that the steak used for the steak tacos isn't real steak.  Yesterday I decided to get three chicken tacos and they were YUCK, very dry and too much ?paprika?; one went in the garbage.  The rice doesn't come with red sauce which I don't understand.  But, this place has been the after the party taco spot since my partying days.  After yesterday's chicken taco disappointment, I'm going to start making my own at home, like my momma use to do, YUMM!",0.6312,0.869,0.094,0.037,0.5725

2009-09-04,4.0,"Something about the sign and building compelled me to stop in. It was also nice to see the guys in the kitchen working from outside.  Inside, it's very casual. You place your order with one of the cooks and your meal is made to order. I had the Chicken Torta and the Plantano de Leche Licuado. The Chicken Torta was huge! All ingredients were very fresh. You can see onions, avocados, bananas and all sorts of fruits and vegetables on display throughout the restaurant. I wish that the Chicken was marinated in something as it was kind of bland. They serve limes, raw onions and salsa if you dine in. The Plantano de Leche Licuado was sooooo good. A must have! My meal cost me about $12 with tip.  Next time, I'll probably order the Chorizo Burrito (first time I've heard of such a thing!) or the Carne Asada Tortas and/or Tacos. The menu displayed when you first walk in are not the only items they have - they also have a menu full of Breakfast and Dinner items on the tables.  If you only speak English, there may be a bit of a language barrier. Don't let that stop you from coming in - it's a very diverse crowd here. It gets busy too - the food is great! The service is a hit or miss.  They are open 24 hours on weekends and from 9am - 3am (!) on Monday - Friday.  Street parking is available. Pay box.",0.9319,0.879,0.086,0.035,0.6235207100591718
2009-01-04,5.0,"Birra Huentitan is one of those always-open taco stops that cops are always found coming in and out of.  While their food is more fast-food style, this is still a traditional ""sit-down"" place so expect to pay a tip.  The ambiance is nothing to encapsulate in your Polaroid but it does definitely shout authentic from all esquinas. The walls are lined with Spanish-written menus, messages, and other kitchy things from Mexico. There is a jukebox that, surprisingly, a lot of diners feed quarters.  Admittedly, the Latino music (Salsa, Pop, Tejano, etc.) definitely encourages frolicking taste buds.   Foodwise, this place is ""la Bomba"" (oh, I can hear the groans now...).  But seriously, this place does indeed, rock for what it is.  And what it is: everything authentic.  They have myriad Mexican dishes from traditional pozole, to beef, tongue, chorizo, and pork tacos.  I almost always order their burritos since I am a a big fan of them in all birras and taco stops across the city (including tasty Las Asadas which I have reviewed previously).  Like the traditional taco, I order my burrito with onion, buckets of cilantro, and (sometimes) cheese, but that's it. Oh, and of course... TONS of limes to squeeze on each juicy, meaty bite.  Their horchata, which is one of my most favorite summertime beverages, is made fresh, not with a power mix (the telltale sign of a Gringo-targeted Mexican joint). It is a bit on the sweet side but you can always add more ice to water it down and bring it to a higher level of cool.  Their service is efficient and friendly, too, if you speak a little Spanish.  This place is really good for diners that like to take the mystery out of hole-in-the-wall dining spots by actually seeing what is being prepared. Their kitchen area is located right by the entrance (viewable from the sidewalk, actually) so you can easily confirm the dish is freshly made and who is actually making it.  Piles of various grilled and sauteed meats mingle with tomatoes, onions, and other must-have Mexican accouterments.  The meat is piled so high sometimes that wonder if they are overpreparing the stuff. But just as you think that, you turn around to walk out and see a line of cops, neighbors, and Latinos snaking its way out the door and you think: nope, they got it all figured out.",0.9946,0.853,0.132,0.016,0.45489918489918496

2006-05-22,5.0,"This place is great! In my opinion, the best Burrito in Chicago. I like to eat there if possible, but the majority of the visitors get the food to go. This is a popular late night munchie place, but be a little cautious with the neighborhood at night. If you eat the food there, you get lackluster service, but you get free chips and a selection of freshly cut onions, tomatos and other topping for your burrito. The other food is really good there as well. I like the fact that they put beans, sour cream and guacamole if you ask for it. Good meat in a tight roll. Tasty cheese on the burrito. Ingredients are mixed well also. Just a great place, and it tastes good even when your'e not drunk!",0.9918,0.693,0.283,0.024,0.5714285714285713
