The menu wasn't overwhelming with choices but he still pointed out some favorites and genuinely seemed to love the restaurant.  The food was definitely tasty! I had the braised beef sandwich which was so indulgent. I substituted fries for a salad which made the dish lighter and easier to eat. The shrimp cocktail was delicious as well - especially with the chips.  Would love to come here again for dinner!

Both were outstanding and flavorful.  We had PEI mussels and grilled octopus for our starter. They were cooked perfectly. Asian Manager came by and she check on us and she suggested to try the white fish. My wife ordered it and I had the Smoked chicken pasta. Both were tasteful and flavorful.

Mango Khaffir Lime Sorbet - creamy mango sorbet texture, with tropical fruit exotically perfumed with khaffir lime leaves.  I love creative ice creams, & this was amazing! Seriously, the pastry chef here makes a return visit just for dessert a GREAT IDEA. BREAKFAST/BRUNCH Ricotta Toast - a slab of bread, a thick smear of ricotta, thinly shaved prosciutto, a sprinkle of chopped pistachios, & orange zest (which took it to another level).  Served with eggs too, which made this a really delicious & satisfying breakfast.  It was so good, I swear the pastry chef had to have something to do with it. We tried a bunch of other dishes (Liver Mousse, Scallops, Duck Breast, Salmon), & while they were fine, nothing wowed us like the desserts & that amazing breakfast toast.

After sitting for 15 minutes, the waiter took our drink order. I got Candied Bacon Old Fashioned that was two fingers of cheap whiskey in a glass and some undercooked bacon. My wife got summer thoughts that was tequila and juice.  Another 10 minutes went by, and the waiter came by to take our food order. We asked for the check with our two appetizers, because we had a show and couldn't wait for him. We got 7 wings for $12 and also ordered mussels. The mussels came out all shells and no meat.

After studying the menu, I selected avocado toast, which came with eggs cooked to order. I picked over medium. To be honest, I was expecting two pieces of toast with avocado slices and the egg on top. What I got was one piece of toast with an avocado spread, radish slices and some kind of fruit that was super sweet and just ruined the dish. I really didn't care for it.  On the bright side, the eggs were good and the staff super friendly. If I stay at the Wit again, I'll have breakfast somewhere else.",0.9805,0.732,0.216,0.052,0.5944444444444444

2017-02-05,4.0,"My wife and I wanted to try a new restaurant for Chicago's 2017 Restaurant Week. We saw a show last night at the Chicago Theater. State and Lake Chicago Tavern was located less than a block from the theater and also had a special Restaurant Week (RW) menu. What a good way to fill two needs with one deed!  We arrived at the restaurant at 6:00PM. The restaurant was empty since it was well before primetime so we were immediately seated. Many restaurants don't seem to understand the intention of Restaurant Week. Oftentimes, they charge more for their RW menu than their regular menu. The point of RW is to give potential customers a GOOD DEAL so they become REPEAT CUSTOMERS! State and Lake Chicago Tavern seems to understand the intention of Restaurant Week very well.  I calculated the value of their RW menu against the actual menu, and we saved about 10 dollars for each offering. I can say with confidence that the combination of value, quality, and service has made me a return customer.  Their RW menu was a three course offering of Split Pea Soup, Pork Shoulder Midwestern Rice Bowl, and a Meyer Lemon Cheesecake Parfait. Each dish was better than the previous one!  The first dish was the Split Pea Soup. The soup had little pieces of crap in it, and it was creamy and delicious.  The main course was the Pork Shoulder Rice Bowl. What an amazing combination of flavors! This dish contained pork shoulder, a soft boiled egg, basmati rice, root vegetables and edamame. The combination was superb, and the pork shoulder was amazing. It was tender, fresh, and bursting with flavor.  Just when I thought the meal couldn't get any better, dessert arrived.  It was a parfait inside of a glass bowl. It contained cheesecake, cardamom graham, blood orange banana jam, and lemon ice. All I can say is WOW! I've never tasted anything like that dish before. By itself, this dessert ensured a return visit.  I am very satisfied with our decision to try State and Lake Chicago Tavern. We come to the Chicago Loop often, and I think we've found one of our new go-to locations!",0.9935,0.831,0.146,0.023,0.5370382491072146
2017-02-01,5.0,"I recently moved back to Chicago from Hollywood this year and had heard about this place from local friends and family here.  So, when I had a business associate come to town to talk biz regarding my local radio show, the three of us decided to go here (well, I decided!) After figuring how/where to park for a minute, we were met right away inside the door by a smiling Maylin (sp?) who seated us right away, stopped by to make sure we had everything we needed (we did!), and gave us a happy, welcomed vibe when we left.  She was cool for sure and seemed to be handling a lot but still gave us her full attention as we needed it. Our server Tanya was also friendly and though she had a number of tables, she took the time to check in with us frequently and the food was delivered hot...we never felt rushed. I started with the Scallops which where soft but not mushy.  I hate rubbery scallops and these were fresh and had a Kale infusion-type sauce with mayo that I totally enjoyed. For the main entrees my associates had Salmon and Chicken entree's which seemed to disappear without much delay.  I had the Risotto which literally melted in my mouth. I had heard the desserts were ""The Bomb"" so though the other guys passed, I dove in and ordered up the Apple Crumb Cake which Tanya recommended and added a cup of cappuccino...oh!  and I thought I would never stand again!  So good together, PERFECT! After the meal, Angela the barkeep handled us with class as we decided to explore the liquor selection for a few rounds with some after dinner libations!.  She was talkative and sweet and spent more than a fair amount of time chatting us and making sure our vessels were filled with nectar.   Overall, The food was good, (hot-fresh), the drinks were strong (and really affordable compared to the LA scene) and fair prices that allowed us to stay for several rounds instead of ""one more and out"" like would've been in Hollywood.  Not sure what dinner is like here, but I found the food totally reasonable for the portions and expert prep and ""table warmth"" of all items. The only drawback was the midday parking but considering the time and location, it wasn't that bad..well worth it.  The lunch menu was also focused, which I enjoyed, but I plan to be back for dinner soon to see what larger selections are on offer on the dinner menu and probably catch easier parking as well.  With a valet though, you are right in with no hesitation. I highly recommend and tip my hat to the crew and staff who all made us feel very welcomed.

Pros: 1. Great rye old fashioned. 2. Aloof, charming hostage bartender 3. Salmon entree that was really really great (go Kitchen!) Cons: 1. Arriving at 10:29 and being hurried through the night.

Thanks to the theatre website, we found this gem for brunch! We made reservations on OpenTable but did not need them when we walked in for a table. The atmosphere is unique with great lighting and decor.  We ordered the deviled eggs to start - you get 4 deviled eggs perfect for a one-bite explosion of egg & bacon flavor!  My partner ordered the steak and eggs and I ordered the crispy chicken thigh and malted waffle. Chicken was so tender! Waffles were fluffy and the white bbq sauce paired with the coleslaw was perfect! This was my first time ordering chicken and waffles and I was not disappointed!

2016-07-26,5.0,"I often visit State and Lake during my lunch break at work. If you are tired of staring at the same white walls of your office cubicle and need to feel enriched by the city streets State and Lake is just a short walk away! Add Salmon to their Cobb Salad for lunch and you've got a meal that leaves you feeling light and ready to face the second half of the day. My favorites are The Wimpy burger and Deviled Eggs, both a great bang for your buck!  As I usually find myself at the bar for a quick meal I have only the kindest words to describe the afternoon bartender, Austin. He is attentive, well informed, and easy on the eyes. The bar area is orderly and clean each time I've gone in to enjoy lunch. In addition to his beer poring skills Austin is also quite knowledgeable about the city neighborhoods of Chicago. If you are visiting the city stop in to get a drink and some recommendations from Austin on what to do around Chicago!

Oh sure- there are still burgers and sandwiches and salads on the menu too and be sure to ask what beers they are featuring as they seem to change all the time.

However, upon arrival, we were greatly underwhelmed. Now, I take part of the blame because of the time we chose to be there (3p on a Saturday) but certainly not a majority of it. Apparently, at this time, they really do not have a full menu. They have burgers and a few apps and that's it - they said it's their ""in-between time when we turn over the kitchen."" I'll admit that I don't have the first clue how to run a restaurant, but I've never understood the ""turn over the kitchen"" reasoning... especially when your menu is glorified bar food anyway! My feelings were not alone as I overheard others asking the same questions we were. Needless to say, we did not stay for a meal as we needed real entrees. So we quietly gathered our things and departed (all we had was water before leaving). Leaving it here I would certainly return again in the future and give it another shot. But here's the kicker: they cancelled my reservation on OpenTable so I would not receive points! I couldn't believe it when I read the email later! How CHILDISH can one get... we upheld our reservation and we arrived on time. The fact that you cannot provide a full menu and therefore we won't stay is beyond the reservation point. Especially when your staff seems indifferent to our happiness anyway! My father inquired about vegetarian options and was told, ""Yea, we really don't have any of those... maybe the pretzel? I dunno... I don't really know what to tell you...""

2015-08-03,3.0,"This restaurant is connected/inside The Wit hotel.  I'm staying here for business and decided to just do the easy and quick thing of eating here.  The first thing I noticed was that the place was very aesthetically pleasing.  The bar is old fashioned style with a ""colorful hip"" blended in with neon Seltzer bottles stacked up top.  I was there a bit late for dinner at 9 pm, so it was not busy.  The service I received was very nice and attentive but again, it wasn't very busy. I opted to order 2 appetizers versus an entree as I was not super excited about the full entree options.  I ordered the Steak Tartare and the Poutine as I am a huge fan of both.  They came out at different times, which is fine because I got a chance to eat one first, but seems odd. The Steak tartare as seen in my picture below was presented very nice (most of the dishes I saw come out of the kitchen were presented very nice) but was served with potato chips versus a crostini.  I was a bit disappointed when i saw that, but it worked.  It was different and non-traditional but the chips were homemade and tasty.  Unfortunately, the steak portion felt like a burger patty squished down paper thin.  Yes, there were shallots and a type of vinegarette in it, but it was lack luster.  I'm not one to leave steak tartare on the plate, but in this case I did...I was simply bored of the dish.  I think the paper thin presentations was also a turn off. Next came out the Poutine.  Boy do I love Poutine and this one sounded absurd (which in the case of Poutine, is a great thing).  It was a bed of fresh cut fries, covered in gravy, covered in baked cheese (they called it cheese curd), half a piece of bacon (disappointing), Green peas, and a sunny side up egg.  You can see by the picture, this thing looked glorious.  It was about to wow me...I was sure of it!  While the bacon, cheese curds and the fries were good, the gravy was weak.  It was borderline gross.  It tasted like it came out of a can of Campell's cream of (insert vegetable here).  Flavorless and bland...it pretty much ruined the majority of the dish.  Once again, over half this dish stayed in the plate for me.  I picked the ""cheese curd"" out of this dish and ate around the gravy. I'm torn about the rating here as the ambiance and service was great but the food taste was not there.  if the food taste can catch up to the food presentation, this place would fire on all cylinders and be a 5 star resturant for sure.",0.9911,0.758,0.159,0.083,0.5996180555555558
2015-07-12,4.0,"At first glance this place appears to be a fairly ordinary tavern likely to have a sports bar menu, but the food and ambience are both better than that. The stylish surroundings and pleasant lighting create a relaxed dining environment, and the menu offers some interesting and healthful items.  Yes, they're known for their hamburgers and pretzels, but I had something completely different. I started with the charred broccoli, a generous serving that's lightly seasoned and nicely cooked, although I could have done with a bit more char.  As a main course I had the Cobb salad. I like it when a Cobb is served un-tossed, as was the case here, allowing me to pick and combine ingredients at will. The perfectly seasoned avocado, bacon, cubes of Parmesan cheese and house-made ranch dressing were standouts. Service was friendly and attentive.

2015-07-09,3.0,"We chose here due to a central location in meeting some people.  Attached to the Wit hotel, this restaurant is pretty glam with its upholstered leather walls, lighting, and fancy bar- OMG and they have the cutest bathroom ever, with the cutest sink I've ever seen! (This is what girls are impressed by) The chairs looked nice, but were pretty hard by the end of the meal, so those could use a little more luxury. I really enjoyed reading their drink list. My guy and I were the only ""locals"", so we definitely were able to show our local pride and make recommendations from places like Goose Island, Revolution, Three Floyds (Chicagoans LOVE their Munster neighbors!), and even learn a few we hadn't heard of too. They had a cup, 22oz and Growler size option too, which is a nice touch. Beer prices seemed on point from wherever else I go, maybe $1 more for some.  The cocktails, although super fancy and delicious sounding, were all VERY Chicago priced. Most were over $12 and most came in tiny glasses, which I felt was typical Chicago/tourist trap, so I stuck with beer. The highlight with the food we ordered was the poutine and crispy chicken thigh. The poutine was in all of its artery-clogging glory with a heap of fries, white gravy, melty cheese curds hidden in the gravy, peas, bacon and a fried egg on top. It was pretty great! The chicken was nice and juicy, and super crispy, with a sweet coleslaw on top. YUM. We also ordered main dishes- I got their brisket burger with cheese on top, served with dressed greens. This was a big disappointment. The dressed greens were lackluster and pretty sour with the dressing. The burger was super dry, and the bun was too big for the burger, but also dry. I chugged down my beer faster than expected to compensate! I would not recommend it. Our service was pretty good overall, and the waitress graciously split the bill in between 3 couples- and got it right on the first try. It was an a-ok night, but I'd try some place else over coming back, if in the area.",0.9985,0.715,0.251,0.034,0.5558568489124045

How did it take that long to find out and why would you not know to begin with? Then, after placing our food order, we continued the wait. Finally a different server brought our food - the wrong food!!! My boyfriend ordered the salmon (and I heard him order it) but they brought him a burger. When our server came by, she just stared blankly. She offered to change the order but after that wait, it was no longer worth it. Upon eating our burgers, they were overcooked.

Upon entering we stood at the hostess station several minutes when a male voice from somewhere said Erica will be right there. We were seated at a 2 top, right next to another table (there were only 2 other tables with seated customers) why we were sat right on top of another table did not make sense) Our table did not have water glasses or silverware.  We waited quit a while for Erica to return to our table with water and to take our drink order. We started with the toasted sunflower pretzel served with goat cheese and red pepper jelly $8.00. The sunflower seeds tasted burnt, and the jelly was think and snappy, like it was old. We both ordered a makers mark with ginger; both drinks were weak; if there was a shot of liquor in each drink I would be surprised. For our entrées we ordered a Barley soup with an added egg and a Little Gen Cobb with sesame dressing on the side. The half bowl of soup came luke warm with 2 mini meatballs for $8.00. The salad had 3 slices of avocado, 8 mini squares of cheese and beet, and  1/2 stalk of romaine cut into four pieces for $13.00. We wanted salt & pepper, and had to get if off another table. Erica did not serve our food; ask us how everything was, or if we wanted something else.  The service was lack luster from the moment we walked in the door. I understand it was a holiday (Memorial day 2015) but the restaurant was virtually empty. All the servers huddled by the bar and talked instead of providing service to their customers. As a side note, the bathrooms were not working, one was locked and the other was out of order. After I made several attempts to use the restroom, I inquired and was told ""that is the only restroom we have"". I would not recommend this establishment to anyone.

2015-05-24,2.0,"I sadly feel compelled to write this review.  First, the atmosphere here feels very forced and very inconsistent. Overall it does not feel authentic and like its being forced into something that it isn't. Face it, it's a hotel restaurant- stick to something that is simple and not pretentious. Hearing country music covers in the middle of the Loop while looking at a bedazzled deer head on the wall is not appealing and I hope it never will be. A simple bar and restaurant with great steak and good drinks is what appeals, to me at least, in a hotel restaurant. Just my opinion.  The food was okay at best. For the price you pay, you might as well save twenty or thirty dollars and go across the street to the Chick-fil-a, or walk a couple blocks to a proper restaurant. I got the Maine mussels and they would have been good except that the chef decided to put oranges into the sauce. It was just bad. With mussels, stick to butter and garlic...please... I also got the perch tacos - a great way to get the mussel sauce taste off my palate. Admittedly the perch tacos were good but not good enough to up this place to 3 stars.

Pros: - They have a Cocktail in the world and indeed it is. It was so good afterwards, I wanted to smoke a cigarette and I don't even smoke, so yeah it was that good!  - The decor *thumbs up* Thumbs all the way up... forget the thumbs how about :) everything is up! The table were real wood, the chairs matched, the booth was comfortable and elegant at the same time.  - There are separate areas the bar is off to the side, the tables are in an area and then there are separate tables near the door (yay, privacy if it's not too packed) - They had a guitarist who was actually very good! :)  - They had a fireplace on the flat screen *cute touch* with the wood decor - Our waitress was beautiful and attentive. Rule of thumb to all waiters and waitresses, if you see two people on a date compliment the woman and be nice to both. Some restuarants have very attractive waitresses that think the key to their tip is flirting with the guy - dumb move, I'm glad the State and Lake waitress wasn't that dumb. :) She said,""Nice necklace and smiled."" Then when she took our order she looked at me first, many waiters have lost their minds with all this independent women crap and treat women like second class citizens,  but not State and Lake.  - The appetizers were a decent portion. Not so big that you feel like you are wasting money for having so much left over when you are done, but also not so little that you are left starving either. It was just the right amount. - The bathrooms were very clean *thumbs all the way up*  - The lighting is perfect for evening  - not to dim to make you sleepy, but not to bright to kill the mood - perfecto!  Cons: The seating area is not private all of the tables are right next to each other. If there were more people there, I would have felt like my date was  group conversation instead of a private one.

I stopped here today to meet a friend for lunch before heading to the Gene Siskel Film Center (which is less than a block away). I arrived first and decided to have a beer at the bar while I waited. I'm not a very discerning beer drinker so I asked the bartender for something kind of light and crisp on tap. He selected the perfect pale ale. I noticed my phone was almost dead and the bartender charged it for me during the meal. My friend arrived and we got a table and ordered a burger and a cobb salad. We wanted to split both items (as women are wont to do), and instead of simply bringing extra plates, the kitchen sent out 4 plates, each with a half serving on it! That meant we each got our own condiments for our  half burger, our own order of fries, and our own deconstructed Cobb Salad! I was so pleased at this considered  presentation! I hate having to divide food and shuffle it from one plate to another, while all the time the other person is usually thinking ""that's not half"".  I love a good burger and this one was juicy and delicious. The fries were heavenly and the salad was the perfect accompaniment.

Well that was closed, so the hotel concierge recommended this place. So VERY DISAPPOINTED. First off, the wines are super expensive. I got the cheapest red on the menu which was $11 and it was mediocre. My wine arrived probably 20 mins later. I would assume she forgot as my friends ice tea came way before mine.  We got the pretzel for appetizers. It took about 20 minutes to make, which boggles my mind why a pretzel would take that long to make. The dipping sauce was interesting. When we asked the waitress what was in the sauce, she seemed bothered why we would ask such a question. Next up... The main entree. I got the green salad. It was bland and no taste. I mean really you can't eff up spinach walnut salad. There were shaved peaches instead of the traditional apples, which really gave no flavoring. If I didn't read what was in it prior to ordering, I would have never guessed it had peaches. My friend ordered the burger, which she said was ok. I mean for $18 it should have been out of this world. We also got tavern fries, which wasn't anything amazing, but for $9 I would have expected more. Side note, they don't even carry ranch. So $60 bucks later and a terrible dinner and service, I would say not even 1 star is worth it to rate this place.",0.189,0.882,0.066,0.052,0.46888888888888886
2014-10-20,3.0,"We have been in Chicago about 2 months now, and every Friday I meet my husband for drinks and dinner or small plates.  This location is pretty close to Clark and Lake, so we gave it a shot.  It was okay.  The service was good, I returned a drink because it didn't taste like I expected and they graciously removed it from the bill.  But we did have to wait quite a bit for drinks which seemed odd because it was pretty quiet when we arrived around 5.  We ordered the mussels and chicken thighs.  The mussels were good, but both of us felt the broth could have been a little more seasoned.  They were served with fries instead of bread which was a nice change.  Miracle of miracles, we couldn't finish them.  I can't say that has ever happened to us before, but the serving was so generous, we grew tired of eating with about 10 mussels still left in the bowl.  The chicken thighs were delicious, but only two small thighs per plate (or maybe it was one divided), so next time we would order double.  We split the cobb salad (deconstructed), it was portioned generously and they didn't charge for splitting.  I had read about the macaroon sandwich for dessert, so I ordered that and my husband ordered ice cream.  The macaroon espresso sandwich was so good...but sooooo much!  For the price I would have been happy with half as much.  Chocolate sauce on the side would have made this simple dessert so much more enjoyable.  My husband enjoyed the ice cream but wished there was a little more to the serving.  We both strongly recommend the whiskey flights...one of the cognacs I tried sells between $150-$200/bottle.  And the pours were generous.  We'll probably be back for a night cap sometime, but can't see us going for dinner again.",0.9952,0.804,0.176,0.021,0.5232492997198879

(altho) The biscuits were horribly disappointing ...cold and dry and brittle, otherwise this review would have received five stars. Presentation of said morsels were wonderful. Presentation was a small bucket with biscuits strewn amongst the 5 pc hot wonderment of delectable bird, the bucket resting on a long plate which also housed in cute small containments, accompaniments of pumpkin butter, honey and a fruity delight of cranberry jam. Cocktails were a bit highly priced so don't plan on getting too indulgent while visiting. Great place for viewing the game as there are flat screens galore mounted all about the dining/ bar area.  So shout out to Paige, and the chef who creates that incredible bird.  If you only offered game day cocktail specials, this place would be recommended more from me to others.

I have no problem forking over a good chunk of cash for a good meal, but the value just really isn't here.  On my visit last night I had a salad that was really poorly composed. There simply wasn't enough lettuce in comparison to the massive amounts of cheese. The parts didn't work together and it was just blah. It wasn't *bad* and all the ingredients were fresh, but I only ate about half of it. My friends also commented that they weren't impressed with the food.  The waitress talked me into getting some kind of blueberry dessert that she described as ""pillowy goodness"" and her favorite. What came out was over-fried, tough balls of dough.  For my salad, dessert and a Diet Coke I paid about $34. Woof. It's a great location, swanky interior and decent service, but I can't help but feel like they're taking advantage of people.

Both times I visited, service was fantastic--attentive and friendly without being the least bit obtrusive. Honestly, I expected a bit more pretense given the location, but State and Lake keeps it classy without sacrificing a laid back feel.  The drink menu also deserves 4 stars. I appreciated the broad assortment, from local brews and bourbon and scotch flights to specialty cocktails, there were plenty of options within every price range.  The food, however, is just a 3 in my book. It was nicely plated and pretty, but fairly unremarkable in the taste department. The Southern soul food fusion thing is great, but as a born and raised Southerner, I was disappointment by the blandness of the deviled eggs and fried green tomatoes. The exception would be the $8 soft pretzel with jalapeño, corn relish; I know it sounds like a lot of cash to shell out for a pretzel, but it's worth every cent. The charcuterie and cheese board was also decent, albeit a couple of bucks overpriced for what it is.

We informed the waitress that we had an 8 o'clock show and arrived at 6 o'clock. Thought we had plenty of time but we were very wrong. This has to be the worst service I've ever received in my many years of going to restaurants in downtown Chicago. When we first arrived our drink order was taken and brought out rather quickly, so I had high hopes. But then when we ordered appetizers and soups and salads that's when everything started to decline . We waited for a ridiculous amount of time until we finally asked where the starters were . The waitress apologized and went to check. The next thing we knew our entrees soups salads and appetizer all arrived at the table at the same time. Once we organized all the food we realize that three of the four orders were incorrect. My friend had ordered a salad with an Amish chicken side addition but instead they gave her the Amish chicken entree. My steak was supposed to be medium rare and it was well done. My other friend ordered a ham burger with mushrooms and she received a cheeseburger. Instead of fries she asked for a side salad. All she got was fries. We didn't realize all the mistakes at once so we told the waitress about one at a time. Sometimes she was busy taking care of one so another person would come by and check our table to see if everything is okay, so we informed them of the next mistake we found. Soon we had 4 people working on a table at once. We all started laughing because we couldn't believe how ridiculous the whole situation was. When the end of the meal came the manager informed us that he was going to take care of a side salad and an appetizer because of all the problems. I rolled my eyes and thought that wasn't enough. He then brought by 2 to-go desserts that we could take with us to the theater. There were four of us at the table! Meaning we'd have to share too small dessert. Ridiculous. Then the bill came and he hadn't taken off the appetizer. they also had charged us for both my friend's salad and the entire chicken entree. My friend went out and really laid into them because of the horrible experience we had had. The manager then had the audacity to stop by our table and tell us that we could come back after our show if we wanted to listen to live music until 2 a.m.. Was he kidding? All of us agreed we would never come back to this restaurant ever again. When the bill finally came back with the appetizer still not taken off. We just paid, gave no tip, and left.

However, after the subpar service my colleagues and I experienced today I'd have to give State and Lake 2 stars overall. When we came into State and Lake this afternoon the place was pretty empty and the staff was setting up for an event over by the staircase in the restaurant. The hostess sat us about 3 skips from this area, which should have been a warning sign for us. As we were eating our food, guest of the event started to arrive and I quickly realized that the space just wasn't sufficient. I guess the group of randoms standing 2 feet from our table was the dead give away.  Since the waitress waiting on us was also attending to those at the event she was pretty much like M.I.A when it came to seeing to our needs. The busboy was a constant at our table, interrupting our conversation to clear away items from our table even if we weren't done with them; such as my soda glass. I thought he had taken the glass to get me a refill. When he never came back with the refill I took that as his way of telling me that I didn't need anything else to drink. The fact that I was still eating my fries didn't matter to him.  Whenever one of us wasn't eating the busboy was at our table trying to takeaway our plates even though it was clear that we had about 40% of our food still on the plate and that we weren't done eating. I did inform one of the managers assisting with the event (I think he was a manager) that we felt like we were being rushed through our meal so that our table could be given away and he assured me that wasn't the case. However, seeing how 2 tables close to us had already been commandeered by those attending the event I didn't really believe him.

From the moment we decided on State and Lake as our venue, we were in contact with Lauren and she was phenomenal.  We had a small party of 19 and she left no stone unturned in making sure our event went off without a hitch.  There are a few options to go with when having a party there.  We chose the package where our guests could order whatever they wanted off the menu as well as drinks.  Lauren suggested some delicious appetizers to get us started.  They were fantastic.  Everyone enjoyed their entrees as well.  Everything was wonderful.  Peter our host and the rest off the staff that attended to us were top notch and gave impeccable service. We wanted to bring a cake, but understandably due to health codes, we could not bring in outside food.  So we ordered the cake ahead of time.  Are we ever thankful for that... The cake was out of this world!  It looked beautiful too. Hats off to the chef.  We ordered the white cake with buttercream frosting and chocolate buttercream in the middle.  It was honestly the best cake I or anyone at the table has ever had.  I think our guests were more excited about the cake than the fact that we got married... well almost.  They would not stop talking about it. After our wonderful meal at State and Lake, we all headed upstairs to the rooftop for one more drink and a toast. The views of the city are unbelievable and has a great vibe.  The service up there was just as great as downstairs.   The entire experience was above and beyond our expectations.  From the service, the atmosphere, the food, and of course that cake... we are SO happy that we chose State and Lake to host our reception on our special day.  There are many options to choose from when having an event here.  We chose one that fit our needs perfectly.  I believe that whatever anyone chooses when deciding on having their celebration here, they will be extremely happy they did, just like us.  Thank you to the wit hotel and entire State and Lake staff for a memorable experience.",0.9985,0.775,0.221,0.004,0.5983414733414735

2014-02-05,3.0,"Before yesterday, I didn't know that State and Lake Tavern existed, but I'm glad my fiancé and I came across it when the opportunity presented itself to have dinner with his cousin. We picked it solely because it was equidistant from my house and the cousin's hotel and had no problem getting a 7:30 reservation on a Tuesday night. In fact, a reservation wasn't necessary at all since it was barely half full on that snowy, windy night. I was the last to arrive after the boys had waited for 10 minutes or so, but the waiter didn't come over to greet our table until I had been seated for at least 5 minutes. He was friendly if not a little rehearsed. When the cousin ordered his beer, the waiter didn't seem familiar with the name and instead asked if he meant another beer...he went with it, and ended up getting an entirely different beer than he originally intended (when the beer was finally delivered a long 10 minutes later). Besides those blips, it seems like they have an extensive beer, wine, and liquor list, and their tasting flights sound incredible. My food experience might have been different if I weren't on a strict cleanse right now, but I was pretty limited in terms of gluten-free, dairy-free, sugar-free entree options. I told the waiter my restrictions and asked for his recommendation between the salmon and whitefish. I appreciated that he took the time to consider my needs and explain the special certification that some of their meals have. I've been avoiding eating out during this cleanse, but was SO pleasantly surprised with the full flavor of the whitefish and found that they provided a portion that was filling and reasonable considering the $22 price tag.  I would describe the interior as an upscale cabin - big leather bar-height seats, wooden tables, and several TVs hanging on the walls displaying only a fake fireplace. It was a nice ambience considering the cold weather outside.

By the time we got our food, everyone was almost done eating (not cool).   The waitress did try to make up for it by offering our table several desserts and small cups of hot chocolate.  It was a nice gesture until I bit into the bread pudding that was made with rye bread (horrible taste sensation if you've ever tried it).    I've been to this place before and have had better experiences... so, maybe they were just having bad day??",0.7994,0.871,0.078,0.051,0.5154761904761905

So, we left and decided to try the OTHER M&S near State and Lake. As we were walking, we passed by State and Lake Chicago Tavern. I checked Yelp, and what? 3 stars? Well, yelpers, you've really confused me this time... because... Deciding to eat here may have been the best decision on my Chicago trip. The interior was nice, nothing too fancy or too casual. We were actually too hungry to care. We had the Christmas special dinner. I don't really remember EXACT names of what we ordered, but maybe the pictures will help? First, we started with some grilled bread and three types of sauces. I remember one was hummus, and I remember it because it was so dang good! I seriously could NOT stop eating the bread, and we even asked for seconds. Oh, and did I mention how GOOD the bread was? Crunchy, and warm... Second, we had deviled eggs, which were okay. Nothing special there. For our entrees, I got salmon and my date got the hangar steak. They were both delicious! The salmon was flaky and juicy, and the butter was delicious. The hangar steak was cooked beautifully and was flavorful. Unfortunately, I don't quite remember what we got for dessert (but I'm sure it was good). Our server Erin was so sweet. I only remember her name because it was the same as mine. Heh. (: I really wasn't expecting much, but I think this place deserves a bit more credit.

The waiter asked if that was all I wanted and then I got nervous that it was going to be a shot glass sized amount of soup, so I asked and he said it was a decent size. So, soup it was! Unfortunately, when I got the soup, it was in a deceptively large bowl. Large and INCREDIBLY shallow. One scrape of the spoon through the soup and the white of the bowl was revealed. There was also a comically tiny, wee little biscuit placed in the center of the bowl. While delicious, I could've gone for a slightly larger biscuit. The other downside of this particular bowl configuration, is that the soup was spread so thin that it couldn't maintain any of it's warmth. So, be forewarned. The soup is truly an appetizer and not a standalone lunch item. I ended up buying a power bar when I got back to work.

To maximize our time experiencing the city, my friends and I ended up eating breakfast here one morning.  Salmon Benedict ($14)- on crisp potato pancakes --I love the way that this Salmon Benedict was plated, and lucky for me it tasted just as good as it looks. Crispy hot potato pancakes, a cool slice of smoked salmon, and an egg cooked to a perfect runny consistency. It was appropriately light on the hollandaise sauce, so wasn't as heavy as I thought it would be. Deliciously crafted eggs benedict! Red Velvet Pancakes ($13) -Vanilla Marscapone, Candied Pecans --I'm not usually a big fan of pancakes, but when I saw Red Velvet Pancakes on the menu, it immediately became an item of interest. I've had red velvet in cake form, but pancakes? Mind blown. These flap jacks came bright red, scarcely topped with sweet marscapone and candied pecans, making it more of a dessert than a breakfast item. No maple syrup needed! They are decent pancakes, but the initial ""red velvet"" novelty wore off quickly for me.  Egg White Wrap ($12)- Chicken Sausage, Spinach, Tomato, Cheddar --The name and description on the menu made this seem like such a healthy option, but it was anything but that. The Egg White Wrap was filling, very greasy, and nothing gastronomically spectacular. Yogurt Parfait ($6) -Berries, Honey, Granola --Out of all these fancy dishes, this Yogurt Parfait was the one thing I actually re-ordered on my subsequent visits back for breakfast.

The toast was not too sweet (but sweet enough) and the warmed banana on the toast gives the toast a nice flavor. my eggs benedict was good (not an expert at eggs benedict) so it made me a bit jealous of the banana french toast.  I'll go back for the French Toast even though it's $12 (before tax and tip). it's really good.,0.9848,0.771,0.19,0.039,0.4385833333333333

I had an 8pm reservation and when I arrived I was seated right away, after we were seated we had not one person come and greet us for almost 10 minutes. The sad part is our waiter would help the table next to us then walk away. Um hello you can at least greet us and say you'll be right with us.  I understand what is like to be busy, but to just completely say nothing and walk away. I'm pretty sure you can handle more then one order at a time, or maybe you need a bit more training. When he finally did arrive, he was very nice, we gave our whole order then since we had more then PLENTY of time to decide. After he took our order. He was never to be seen again until the bill. Not one drop by asking how the food was, never asked if we wanted another drink (which we did). We left and had a drink elsewhere since we apparently were not important enough to this server. The food was good, but with such bad service it was hard to enjoy. Its a shame.

2011-05-18,2.0,"Went to State and Lake for an after work dinner with my buddy. The location, in the W, is very handy for theatre and shopping and public transit.  We got there about 5:30 and they seated us immediately, despite being in set up mode for an event coming in that evening. Service was attentive and appropriate the whole time. The lighting was darkish, in that dark wood classic-modern style; tables tight together, but the noise level was on target to keep conversations private; you could talk at not much more than normal conversational volume and be fine. I liked the feel of the place.  The food, however, was a let down. 9 dollars for a Belgian beer, OK, but what's with the short snifter's worth of a pour? The onion rings - a basic test for every place from grease dripping diners to high art kitchens - were bland, more greasy than crisp, and to paraphrase Woody Allen - the onion rings were mediocre, and there weren't enough of them! I ordered a bacon cheese burger, medium-rare. It was a smallish handful, came well done and the cheese was noticeable by its scarcity. I actually forgot it was part of the sandwich 'til I hit the couple of bites near the end. The bacon was sweet, which I guess is a trend, and I can't hold that against them, but be warned. It seemed too sweet to go with the rest of the flavors, more like candy than bacon. The fries were just OK. My buddy had the BLT with fried egg, which I guess is a turnabout on all the joints serving burgers that way. The egg (2 of them, over easy) was cooked hard enough that the yolk was solid. Less messy, and maybe the cook's intention, but where's the flavor or the fun? The fruit cup he got instead of fries was a small (sensing a theme in this review?) ramikin of diced bits that looked brown around the edges. I don't mean to grouse, other diners around us looked satisfied, or were just eating without paying attention to the food. Overall, we tried the basics and came a cropper, so I'd be looking for an alternative before I go back.",0.9884,0.874,0.108,0.018,0.46155801209372627
2011-05-18,2.0,"Making rash decisions always seem to fail. I had tickets for a show at the Chicago Theater on a weekday. My girlfriend and I were looking for something close and with a nice ambiance. We didn't get it here. I started with a beer while waiting for my partner to show. A man was sitting at the table next to me; he had also ordered a beer. The waitress gave him his beverage and brought me mine. As she set mine down, she realized that she gave us the wrong beers. She took his back and provided him the correct one, then proceeded to give me the one that was sitting on his table. Not acceptable. (I had to ask him if he drank from it and she didn't offer to get me a new one.)  Appetizer- I hadn't had calamari in a while and the choices were limited. So we ordered it and it was like rubber. Calamari should only be cooked or fried for 2-4 minutes, anything after 4 minutes and its garbage. Also, my main course was supposed to have a salad option with it, but I did not receive it.  Main course- For a tenderloin medallion cooked at medium, it was like chewing a tire. Wasabi mashed potatoes were mashed potatoes with no wasabi. Duck tacos were tiny and they used the same sauce as the calamari dipping sauce to drizzle over the tacos.  It was typical bar fare with no umph, just a high priced bar with poor service. The bus boys were more attentive than the servers. Even though the waitress knew we were in a hurry, it took about 20 minutes to get her to run the credit card after we hadn't even looked at the bill. Then after we left, we realized we were over-charged. Just go to the roof of the Wit for drinks in the summer.",-0.6908,0.903,0.038,0.059,0.4430504291030606

We have to wave down our server who til this point has not checked up on us or given us any status of our meal... he says ""it's coming right up... errr, I mean in 5 minutes.""   Ok, we wait again...  1:10 p.m. my wife goes and asks another waitress on our food and she says I'll go check for you... no idea where she went, but then she comes out right near our table with a customer, but doesn't say a damn thing to us...  1:15 p.m.: my lawyer buddy is pissed now goes straight to the manager and at the same time the food is showing up... manager apologizes offers us a drink and says we'll be getting complimentary desserts... (I don't need more food to eat, when now you've already got me running late on a lunch break).  The server busts out the excuse ""kitchen was really backed up""  oh really???

The caprese sandwiches... basically served on brick bread... my wife just eats a few bites and takes off since it's been well over an hour now.   My co-worker who got the side salad... it was literally just LETTUCE with some dressing.  The two of us who got the burger special felt bad and gave her our slices of tomatoes so that she could pretend that it really was a ""salad"" The complimentary dessert... 8 mini-cupcakes, pulled straight out of the fridge onto a plate... I'm a cupcake beast, so I was excited... took a bite and and these were just disgusting... COLD cupcakes???? And the frosting tasted like unsalted butter with food coloring... literally disgusted with this place, the meal and especially the TERRIBLE TERRIBLE service.  Mind you the server had not once come by to ask about drinks still, only the manager did the one time when he knew they f****d up.

The wine list was pretty nice with about 20 different glasses and 4 of sparkling offered, as well as a list of by the bottle choices.  The service is quick - perfect for in and out before a show or later activity.  I wouldn't come here just for the food, but definitely would be back if I was in the area for a cocktail. ROOF I've been here for a company happy hour and the view truly is breathtaking.  The layout is nice, lounge feeling, and overpriced drinks (to be expected).  However, after happy hour is over around 8pm, I bolt.

Firstly, my coworkers tuna melt was advertised as being served with melted white cheddar cheese, however when it arrived, there was American cheese in its place. Additionally, my other coworkers Panini that was said to be served with havarti, was made with jack. The other big kicker was my southwestern salad was served with chip strips on top.

2010-09-19,3.0,"This is a tough review. We came here after a 6:15p movie at the Gene Siskel, a quick 4 minute stroll north. We were looking around and wondered if we should have made reservations. You really cannot tell from outside. We went to the front desk and, no problem, seats galore. On a Friday night. At 8p. Weird. We sat and were promptly addressed by our server. She was a bit cold in the beginning but warmed up after a while. The menu was generously varied. My foodie buddy recommended the truffled mac 'n cheese. We ordered a cobb salas (no pig), the eggy BLT and the half chicken. In addition to the mac, we got the onion rings too. We also had a proper gin gimlet and a amaretto stone sour. First the food: it was tasty. My BLT was well cooked, the salad was huge and the chicken was well seasoned and a good amount. The mac 'n cheese was really nice. Their choice of cheese with the subtle truffle oil was a nice combo. Well done. The onion rings were overly bready but didn't feel too oily either. The drinks were spot on. Well made. Without a crowd you would tell they took their time and used premium ingredients. Speaking of which, if you only have a drink sit near the bar. There's a TV that shows all the movies filmed in Chicago and where. Mostly ""Ferris Bueller"" but still cool. All told, the bill with tip came to nearly $100 for three entrees, two apps and three drinks. It's a bit much, even for the loop. I would definitely go again if for the drinks, but for dinner there are better options around. But this place is great for conversation! Quiet place to eat and drink on  friday night? Unheard of. In all, I am perplexed and it has to do with the money. I've spent as much for the same food in other places, but it's different here. Maybe it's TheWit or...

2010-08-20,1.0,"Jacqueline, the snotty server, is the sole reason for this review.  If you decide to chance this place for the food or a drink, and you find out she's your server, request a different one.  This was my first time here so I suppose I don't know about the rest of the servers, but I can rest assure that was also my last visit. We came in a large group and were seated promptly.. and throughout the meal other folks would come by and check on us, so kudos to State and Lake for that.  The food, while slightly pricey for the quality/quantity, was still tasty.  Everyone ordered some kind of panini and seemed to enjoy their food.   However, Jacqueline just really left a bad impression about the whole experience.  She came off as very forced... everything from her posture and manner of wording her questions had a condescending tone to it.  Her smile would best be described as a smirk.   Even so, I was willing to overlook this because I thought maybe it's just the ""atmosphere"" the hotel was going for?   When the time came to pay the bill, though, we were treated to quite the poor handling of a rather honest mistake on our part.  We were a party of 8 so the gratuity was included on the bill.. when we went to divide the payment amongst us my colleague must've rounded down to the nearest dollar.  We were still paying with two other credit cards, so we asked her to put the same amount on those other two credit cards and then keep the rest of the cash we'd put in. About 2 min later, she came back and told us we did something wrong because we'd shorted her money.  Of course we were confused and it took us a bit to figure out what happened, but while we were discussing this amongst ourselves she stood there and kept saying she needs at least $2 more.  We ended up giving this to her... and it's not even like I think she didn't have the right to come back and sort this out with us.... it was just the way she presented the problem to us that irritated so badly.  Everyone was basically shocked into calming her temper about the whole thing.

I've frequented the Roof at the Wit but never had a chance to visit State and Lake, but I'm glad I did! Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. We started out with drinks - my friend had a glass of malbec and I had the Bees Knees cocktail. The cocktail was really good, but a little on the strong side - death's door gin, lemon, thyme and honey. I had to ask the waitress to have the bartender add some club soda and it really lightened up the drink.  For our meal, we decided to do a spread of appetizers. We got the Beignets, Valencia Salad, Brandade and Truffled Mac & Cheese. The Beignets were more dense and savory than your typical dessert beignets. They were topped with crisp prosciutto, some arugula and cheese. The Valencia Salad was very large and satisfying. The salad dressing was tart and was a nice contrast to our other dishes. The Brandade was one of my favorites - whipped salted cod, toasted pine nuts, currants and grilled bread. My only word of warning - the toasted bread did a number on the roof of my mouth. Two days later, and the top of my mouth is still scratched up! The Truffled Mac & Cheese was definitely the show-stopper. What a decadent dish! My friend and I couldn't stop scooping our spoons into the bowl. After our meal, the waitress brought out the dessert menu but it was already 7:05 and we had a show to catch.

2009-12-24,3.0,Tough review to write because I am firmly believe their model is not sustainable. When I walked through the majestic doors of The Wit they described it as a Gastro-Pub. (more on this later but I respectfully disagree) I will return often to State and Lake but it will never be for the food. It is a good pub. In fact it is a fine pub albeit a bit on the expensive side (I imagine rent in this zip code plays a huge part) The bartenders know their beer. The bartenders seemed (didn't drink any) to know their wine. The same goes to the servers. This is why you want to go here. You want a good beer or you want a good glass of wine. It is almost the anti-Hopleaf in this regard. They don't have a large selection of beer but they have a rotating one which I speculate won't last. Afterall I wouldn't begrudge them if they find the winning financial combo of craft brews that sell. The bartender swore that they will rotate their menu. I pray that my cynicism is wrong.  Their food is okay. If the hotel staff hadn't called it a gastro-pub then I would say their food is above average but I while they are punching above pub food it struck me as a good justification for the markup on the food.  I will return here often but it will always be for the beer. I hope they listen to their bartender and not their accountants.,0.9852,0.791,0.166,0.043,0.46834415584415584

2009-09-14,4.0,State & Lake was a choice for me and my party on Labor Day--there were very few choices.   Walking block after block this would not have been my first choice. I completely enjoyed a delightful lobster roll and at $14.95 was a complete bargain--at least that was from my California perspective where these gems are over $20.00.  This was a completely generous lobster roll with gorgeous lobster meat and served in a very New England authentic way--a large piece of bread cut in half--buttered and grilled.  The service was a bit delayed and made a mistake on the drink order--when I order drinks I am rather precise.  I was going to order a beer and instead ordered a bottle of wine; a beer comes out and have to explain that I had cancelled that and ordered a bottle of wine and not both.  But as the meal progressed service improved and for a very hungry crew we could not have 'planned' on a better meal!  I like the uber urban interior and it fit the Wit's minimalism charm well.,0.9677,0.746,0.179,0.075,0.5020508658008658

I made a reservation (for OpenTable points of course!) and sat at the bar while I waited for my client.  The bartender was attentive at first, bringing me a menu and being perfectly fine with my sitting there and watching tennis while I waited. My client arrived and we decided just to eat at the bar. The bartender ran through the specials and we said that we would need a few minutes to order. About 15 minutes passed and we couldn't find him anywhere, so we just placed our order with another bartender. I had the short rib panini and my client had the salmon. She loved the salmon and polished off every bite (from my angle it looked majorly overcooked), but my panini left much to be desired. The meat was tough and the sandwich was dry overall. There was allegedly bleu cheese on it, but I only tasted cheese in one of the five or so bites I took of the sandwich. Their fries were good, though, so at least I didn't go hungry.

Entrees for us was just the house burger which was pretty tasty, though could use a more special roll or bread type to really make it stand out.

Not even a Hilton. This only later proves my point.. So, we come back with the group from a White Sox game, and of course can't get into uber-exclusive Roof (side note...WTF is with guests having to wait 20 minutes for an elevator to their room while the 20 year old wannabes with a credit score of 500 make it to the 27th floor in under a minute? Where will come your revenue in January? In 5 years when Roof isn't the hot spot? Apparently not from your hotel either, bc you don't care much about your guests) I digress...we go into State Lake. Let me explain the group I'm with. A group of people from small towns, for a convention for people who sell corn (the kind you plant in the ground...) for a living. Awww, shucks. Yeah. Hardworking, honest people who really don't hang out in cities, and aren't used to the culture. Let me also state that very group was DEFINITELY far more affluent than the rest of the bar COMBINED!  Check yourself. We go to the bar. One of the men asks ""what kind of domestic beers do you have""? A: ""All of our beer is domestic"", and walks away.. Seriously. There isn't an explanation of the beers on the menu, and there isn't one single macrobrew. I'm sorry...I'm a beer drinker. A beer lover, actually. And I've never been to a beer bar (much less a hotel bar) that doesn't have one macrobrew on the menu. Not to mention, none of the brews were really ""Bud Light Drinker"" friendly. None of them. I liked my beer. My parents hated theirs. In addition, the service was terrible. Took 10 minutes in a pretty empty bar to place an order, and when we did, we faced a whole lotta attitude. Again, no explanation on the beers or drinks. So, in conclusion, you suck. I deem this place the worst bar in Chicago, and will tell everyone in my power to avoid it at all cost. There's no reason for this level of pretension. None at all. It makes me angry and upset that my family was made to feel inferior because they drink Bud Light, and don't know a Three Floyds (yet have a credit score of 900...) The dudes changing light bulbs above our table, hitting our chairs with ladders certainly didn't help. One ""bright spot"": hostess with the glasses. Go work elsewhere.

We really wanted to get a table upstairs in Cibo Matto, but none were to be had so we ""settled"" for State & Lake, expecting loud music and mediocre bar food.  Have to say, what a pleasant surprise!   To start off, they have a limited cocktails menu but the one I had, Bees Knees (gin, honey, lemon and thyme) was great.  Hubs had the Boilermaker, which comes with its own lager back (a mini glass of lager to chase your cocktail I guess!) which he liked (and he's a cocktail snob).   We were there with another couple so we ordered a couple appetizers to start.  As mentioned by the other reviewers, the buffalo fries were yum! we weren't planning on getting it but the table next to us had an order and the pungent yet attractive aroma of buffalo sauce + blue cheese kept wafting over to our table so we finally caved and added it to our order.  The other starters we got were the summer fruit salad, bbq shrimp, and the ahi. All were quite tasty.  For the main course, 3 of us got the braised short ribs (!) and hubs got the lamb. The short ribs could have been just a little bit more moist but as far as short ribs go, they were definitely one of the better ones I've had.  I also like the celery salad that came with it- nice way to balance the richness. There was a LOT of meat- so for all you hungry men out there- this dish is for you :) For dessert, hubs and I had the guiness gelato (a little bitter, but we found that interesting) and our friends got the carrot cake / cheese cake - had a bit of that and it was delish. Rich but not overwhelmingly so.. the cheesecake had a lighter than your typical cheesecake which I thought was nice. Oh, and our server was great too.  She also helped us get into the Roof after our dinner which as usual, had a line that I normally would not care to wait for.  (This should be a separate review but just a side quickie- while it is annoying that there is ALWAYS a line for the Roof, once up there, I have to say, they did a great job with the space!

The room was kept dim even on a bright Saturday afternoon and the decor and music is contemporary.  We had high backless chairs that were quite comfortable (they also have booths).  The sinks in the bathroom are a little too funky for their own good.  One person complained about water spraying out of the small bowl, another of the confusion from the control being mounted on the wall.

2009-06-12,2.0,"Ambiance was great.  Service was outstanding.  Food was just OK.  The appetizer of seared scallops on summer succotash was probably less than OK.  The scallops didn't smell right (too fishy) and the summer succotash was a bad accompaniment.  My pork shoulder with mac and cheese was OK.  Cavatelli or some homemade pasta in the mac and cheese was good, but not great.  My friend's steak was fine, but the wild mushrooms underneath it were better.  Wouldn't go back except for a drink at the bar.",0.9655,0.731,0.246,0.023,0.5102891156462585
2009-06-12,4.0,"The Wit Hotel's FIRST floor pub/restaurant impresses the eye, satisfies the stomach and pleases the pocketbook.    While all the Carrie Bradshaw wannabes and their ""Just for Men"" using dates will head up to the Wit's aptly named 27th floor lounge, Roof, you can avoid being a clueless spendthrift sucker squandering $11 for a beer and a view.  Stay downstairs-- you'll get less haughtiness and more hootch, less vapidity and more variety, less asshole-ry and more atmosphere. I really thought prices would be steep but you can eat to your max with their fine dishes of Americana like tasty buffalo fries for $5 or warm homemade kettle chips with rich onion dip.  Chicago's own Metropolitan Brewery's lager is on the beer menu for $4.  How thoughtful considering  many out-of-town hotel visitors will be able to try w/o traveling up to Ravenswood.  Which makes me wonder have the Roof people been down to State and Lake yet?   Funny that State and Lake is on the *first* floor of the Wit because it is truly a step above ""Roof.""",0.9724,0.822,0.149,0.029,0.4871693121693122
2009-06-09,4.0,"State and lake is discrete, in a protective yet colorful way. While the bar is perfect for taking in some football or synchronized swimming, the dark corner tables are meant for those having an illicit affair. Because everyone deserves to have a good meal without being caught. Unfortunately, I was there for less compelling reasons- discussing color schemes with my designer.  We shared a smattering of small plates, which is a misnomer since they are rather robust in stature.  Must haves are the beef tartare with quail egg and bbq shrimp with grits. The mussels with chorizo didn't disappoint either. The crab omelet was the only one lacking in spirit. Surprised it wasn't more packed for a Thursday night dinner, but should get more crowded once people catch on.",0.8381,0.884,0.116,0.0,0.6138888888888889
2009-06-02,3.0,"I went here today to check-out the newbie in the Loop for a quick bite and drink. The draft beer selection is pretty good.  I didn't want a beer, but I would come back to try all of them.  Instead, I opted for a signature cocktail: Terragon Julep w/ Landy Cognac, Fresh Terragon, Simple and crushed ice.  Not bad.  The rest of the cocktail menu seemed weak.  It had nothing that would make me want to say ""hmmm...I want to try that!"". The lunch menu had a lot of interesting selections.  I ordered the Lobster Roll and was not disappointed.  It was mostly made out of lobster, almost perfectly seasoned (from what I used to get on Cape Cod, and accompanied by some Old Bay Seasoned Chips, which were good too! The bar was smaller than what I am used to, but seemed to be functional enough for restaurant.  By no means is it a bar to ""see and be seen in"". All-in-all, not a bad ""first impression"".  I will return to try the drafts and more food.",0.2613,0.759,0.118,0.123,0.4713718820861678
2009-06-02,4.0,"I was here for lunch and opted for something quick and inexpensive: the turkey sandwich with a ginger-carrot soup special, affectionately titled,"" a little bit of this, a little bit of that."" $12 buxx. Very good, but not remotely filling AT ALL. My sandwich was like HALF a sandwich. The soup was pretty tasty, if you don't know what Gerber baby carrot soup puree tastes* like (*don't ask me how I know, I don't have any kids but I was once a baby and I have a sharp memory! That's my story and I'm sticking to it).  Their salads are huge and delicious. I nibbled off my lunch dates'. Very light and well balanced. Super fresh ingredients. Impressive! The decor here is freakishly beautiful and mod and neat and warm and cool and earthy and comfy and classy...... but I think this type of decor suits a more loungy evening afterwork crowd, not a ""lunch"" crowd. You be the judge. Our waiter seemed nervous, apprehensive, and new to the restaurant industry. He pulled it off tho! After a few stutters here and there trying to take our order and refill our water while trying to make ""small talk""...... TRYING. The restrooms are dark and clean and leathery. Pretty cool. The faucets are so mod I mistook the sink water knob for a toilet flusher. :( Come here in the evening with some friends or a date and get lots of drinks and lots of food and everything thing else will fall into place and make seem like you're in heaven or at a 5 star hotel restaurant in Dubai. .....well, at least after 8 or 9 johnnie walker reds on the rocks.",0.997,0.721,0.244,0.035,0.6093533549783549
2009-06-02,4.0,"I came here last week for a business lunch and was really very pleasantly surprised.  The decor is warm and inviting, yet really modern -- clean, classic lines and neutral colors.   To start I had the french onion soup -- it was nearly perfect ... not overly salted like most french onion soup is.  Very good.   I followed that up with the grilled vegetable omelette -- it was very good.  It had Fennel, summer squash, corn, carrots and goat cheese.  It was light and not greasy and very filling. I'd recommend this place to anyone!",0.9729,0.74,0.241,0.019,0.4852380952380953
