The bartender did hang with her friends at the end of the bar for a lot of the time, but I get that it's a neighborhood bar, so I wasn't upset. She also seemed friendly enough. The second time I went was probably the worst experience I've ever had at a bar. The waitress was super rude and snooty to us. She scoffed at my friends beer request and then treated us like disabled children when we asked about the bill. Her and a coworker kept giving us dirty looks while talking to each other (Note: we were far from being drunk, loud, or rude. Her attitude was uncalled for).  We left as they were closing and hung out side on the sidewalk having some decent conversation and deciding what to do next. They closed up shop and left. The owner then gets in his tuck and pulls up to us, gets out of his tuck, and yells ""I OWN THIS BAR! GET THE F*CK OFF MY PROPERTY!"" We were on the side walk, which is public. We were not talking loudly, being mean, or even touching his building. He threatened to call the cops, and when we told him too, he drove off.  For the next 30 minutes, he drove around the block stalking us. He would drive a few blocks down and slow down to stare at us. We must have seen him pass us at least 10 times. It was super creepy and we felt a bit harassed at that point so we left.  I'd like to note that I live in the neighborhood and am officially scared to encounter this psychotic owner again. He was out of line, full of rage, and lost a lot of customers and regulars that I've discuss this story with.  TLDR: The owner of this bar is nuts and most of the wait staff think they are elitists.

2014-02-17,4.0,"Fun, loud neighborhood bar. My girlfriend lives off the western stop and we pass by this place all the time. We finally decided to give it a try for dinner since I had some major bar food cravings and it delivered.  When we entered the bar we actually stood around for like 5 minutes waiting for someone to seat us. It took us a little while, but we realized that this isn't the place where you get seated, although what looked like the owner seemed to have passed by us multiple times to talk to other patrons without giving us a heads up. Our bad for not being regulars I guess. The bartender handed us a couple of menus and we decided on the popper burger with a side of fries and a grilled cheese with tots. Everything was definitely above average bar food- my burger was well cooked, thick, and juicy. A cream cheese topped burger was definitely not as flavorful as I hoped, but I think that was my bad for picking a burger that was, well, topped with cream cheese. Fries were pretty good though and came with this addictive garlic aoli. My girlfriend's grilled cheese was overflowing with cream cheese and I'm sure it all stuck to my arteries. Tots were a real nice touch, though nothing spectacular. Floyd's seems like a really nice neighborhood bar that has good vibes. They play really loud music and have all in all good food. My recommendation is that they tell people to seat themselves.",0.9901,0.753,0.191,0.056,0.5828888888888889

It was obviously delicious.  Service here was just okay too.  It's pretty relaxed, but I think that's also due to the fact that it's a teeny neighborhood spot.  I might be back to try out the nighttime vibe, but I wouldn't recommend coming solely for the food.",0.9813,0.706,0.222,0.072,0.6367343304843305

Part ONE = The food and drinks: They have a respectable variety of beers and a few house drinks that looked good but we didn't order any of them.  I ate a cup of chili (tasty) and chicken fingers (very good).  It took a while to get the food after we ordered (way too long for a cup of chili that was most definitely pre made and chicken fingers that just had to be fried) so... don't go here if you're in a hurry.  They have a bunch of burgers on the menu and i absolutely have buyers remorse, as when i later saw the burgers coming out of the kitchen I wished I had eaten one of those.  They looked DELICIOUS.   Part TWO = The bill:  My friend and I each got separate checks.  When he opened his check he said right away ""I didn't order 5 Amstel's.""  I told him he probably just forgot how many he had.  Then I opened my check and said the same thing. ""I didn't have 6 Guinness?""  We are both convinced that they added extra beers to our tab.  We didn't bring it up because it was our word against theirs but if you go here be sure you keep track of how many drinks you have.  I'm 90% sure they added drinks to our tab. I would give the food 4 stars but the shady service gets zero stars and averages out as a 2 for me.  If I go back I'll be keeping an eye on my check.",0.9803,0.875,0.114,0.011,0.5337750172532782

2010-05-18,3.0,"Floyd's is another bar that I always saw on Armitage and was always curious about--driving by it looked mysterious, a bit dark, maybe cozy, I wasn't sure.  I finally went to check out a sports game during the week. I was a bit surprised to find that it was rectangular shaped, a thick long hallway almost, a big space.  I had imagined it as a cozier, squared out bar with not so much space.  They have a lot of old things for decoration--some vintage Elvis art on the walls (random), signs that read ""Whiskey Row"", a sort of make shift shelf with all the beers, old looking cabinets holding other liquor.  The bar is a thick, dark set of wood, nice and smooth, old and flat, long from door to about the middle of the room.  Behind towards the wall there are old, stool-sized tables (comfortable to sit for tall people).  The bar stools are pretty stable, but probably old.   It was on the empty side, with just one bartender working the whole place--whether you sat or were at the bar.  Groups of 2's, 3's and 4's came to have some food on the tables (some on the old side), and 3-4 people came to the bar (younger crowd), with gaps between the different customers. They had a pretty decent beer selection and a full bar, the bartender--a blond girl who had apparently just started--was really sweet, helpful, nice and made good drinks!  I was feeling really full so I didn't want beer, and went for Vodka Water (Ketel Vodka).  She made a Perfect mix of it--it had a good amount of Vodka (which is excellent!!) and just enough water to make it pleasant.  I ordered two!  My friend got a Unibroue, and then a Sangria that was on special (which was okay).  We seriously contemplated some dishes, as you can see the cook to the right of the bar fire up the grill.  You will soon smell everything everyone else is going to eat.   The feeling is very rustic, almost like an old western bar, good for stiff drinks, excellent for conversation (music was nice and comfortably low, but not completely nonexistent) and a good place for a low key time with friends.  The customers at the bar also seemed friendly, but mostly stuck to themselves. Oh and the bartender didn't know that the NBA playoffs were on, and they had 3 TV's showing regular season baseball games (not a bad choice), but I had to enlighten her about the Conference Finals in the NBA, and she gladly switched it right when the basketball game started (come to think of it, I shoud've tipped her more, because after this, I went to Cleo's and had a horrible Vodka Water (I reviewed it) and was wishing that this bartender gave the Cleo's bartender some SCHOOLIN). By the time we left, the place was empty, which made me sad.  I will support them more often (it was a Monday though--Cleo's 25 cent wing special steals the food market). I will definitely return to this place.  Because it's a low key place with not much emphasis on the appearance, I'm giving it a 3.

I discovered Floyd's when it became the destination for a meal and drink before a show at Gorilla Tango Theater due to its proximity. Over the years, my friends and I have returned made it routine to hit Floyd's before a trip to Gorilla Tango. Floyd's food menu, decent beer menu, reasonable prices, and laid back vibe keep me coming back. It had been some time since my last visit and I was a bit disappointed to see the menu had changed; in particular I missed this really yummy seared tuna sandwich I used to order. I also noticed that the Cuban my friend used to order seems to have vanished too. This visit I went with the tuna melt and subbed a cup of roasted tomato soup as my side. My meal was fine, but really nothing special. I felt like the tuna melt was a bit skimpy, it was definitely lacking in the tuna salad area. The soup was also average and erred on the bland side. I wasn't unhappy with my meal, I just found it a letdown compared to some prior dining experiences. The place is small and fills up fast, although never seems uncomfortably crowded. There are a handful of tables and bar seating. They add a few outdoor tables when the weather's nice. If you're looking for a place to grab a drink and have a meaningful chat, I wouldn't recommend Foyd's; it gets really loud, mostly due to the volume of the music. Would I come back to Floyd's?

Burgers are dry, even ordered medium rare.  I think they just ask ""how do you want it"" as a mere formality.   The three times I've eaten here (never again mind you) the fries were brown and stale.  They're too lazy to cook new ones every hour so they just serve you what's been sitting in the fryer all day.   2.  Which brings me to the staff.  You work in a freaking bar.  Spare us the attitude...  seriously.  I know you're only doing this cause your parents cut you off, and/or you flunked out of college, but come on!  it's not that difficult to serve people beer within a couple moments when the bar is empty.

2009-06-15,3.0,"This is the *current* name of this venue. (I have communicated with Yelp that its predecessor has closed.)  It was atypical of me that I stopped here, instead of finally getting to the Charleston one block north of the Map Room. (I did go on to the Map Room.)  But I visited here on a Wednesday night because I learned that _Tiffany_, who was the Saturday evening bartender at the _Twisted Spoke Tavern_ for six of the years that I presented the smut portion of ""Smut & Eggs"", had wound up here, and was working this night. The Spoke's new bar manager shifted her off of Saturday, for specious reasons. She quit a month later. Floyd's Pub is a refinement of the sports bar, adapted for the quieter neighborhood that is Bucktown. There are three large flat-screen TVs along the south wall. I believe it has both Comcast cable, and DirecTV. If Tiffany is working, expect one of those TVs to be tuned to a Saint Louis team's game. Since I knew I was going on to the Map Room, I slummed here. Two-dollar 12-oz. cans of Schlitz are not my forté, but this lets me expound on whether a good beer drinker can _really_ taste the difference between the supposedly ""no-budget"" canned Schlitz, and the alleged ""1960s formula"", double-the-price, bottled Schlitz. I await Olympia and Falstaff to be re-dusted-off and sent back into the market with a higher price, just for those fans of 'retro' beers. This is not to infer that you can't get a quality beer here. Expect that its price may be average or above average, but not by so much that it triggers my ""profiteering"" flag. I would summarize by scribing that, as you would not usually order an italian beef sandwich from a hot dog stand, if you want a craft-brewed beer at a solid price in this neighborhood, you perhaps should not order it here. But maybe this venue will stock some beers that the venue over on Hoyne will not. I shall be giving Floyd's more chances.

I walked in thinking, wow, great food, Cubs game just started, then I try to make some conversation with the chef cooking my food. He doesn't speak much English, because I ask him, ""Are you the Master Chef?"" He kind of shakes his head, and I say, ""You must be the Master Chef."" He still doesn't know what I said.  A few minutes later one of the servers said, ""He thought you asked him if he was Mexican."" If he was MEXICAN? !?! WWWWTTTFFFF.  All the sudden he's going to spit/piss in my food, maybe worse???? Because he thinks I'm some racist? Because he didn't know English well enough(don't get me wrong, he's obviously trying to learn and I'm respectful of other cultures) all of the sudden I'm put in a very uncomfortable position.  I'm like, ""Are you SERIOUS?!"" And the server says, ""Yeah, but then I told him that you said Master Chef...etc...""  And then she said, ""Isn't that kind of funny?!?!"" No, it's not funny, it's not funny that this guy would get riled up over a language he doesn't really understand anyway. It's not funny that I was implied as a racist. Or maybe he is a racist! If he would have just done his job and not made a fuss with the other workers than I would have enjoyed my meal and my experience and stayed there longer and gone there much more often and spent much more money there. Because of all of that, I immediately felt upset and could not enjoy my stay. I very briskly wanted to leave and I did. As soon as I got my food I took a few bites and got out of there. The crew at Floyd's is kinda weird. I'm only going to go there again if that guy, that ""Master Chef"" isn't working there. Or maybe I'll just wait until the kitchen closes to go...

2007-07-28,4.0,"How to be a good neighbourhood Chicago tavern: 1. Have a special for each day of the week; usually, fish and chips on Friday and meatloaf on some other day. 2. Have drink specials everyday. 3. Allow people to bring their kids in until 9pmish or so. 4. Play songs NOT on KISS-FM. Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, Bruce Springsteen and Elvis Presley are gold standards. Keep music at a manageable level so people can still chat -- after all, that's the point of a bar, isn't it? To meet your friends and enjoy each other's company? 5. Have attentive wait staff who take time out to chat with you and refill dishes of treats and water for pets. 6. Have barkeeps who know how to carry on an interesting conversation. 7. Have an interesting selection of beer on tap, particularly microbrews from all over. 8. Have enough TVs for Cubs and other sports viewing. 9. Have a cozy, homely ambience that even people who come in with a paper or a book will feel comfortable sipping and enjoying time off by themselves. 10. Represent your neighbourhood. Floyd's, you have met all of the above requirements, and you are a bona fide Chicago neighbourhood tavern. Can I stray from my neighbourhood and visit you often?

2007-05-26,1.0,"I'm glad that Yelp exists - it gives me a forum to tell everyone how much I hate this place.  This wasn't always the case.  No, I actually enjoyed coming here - then something happened.  Let me explain. It was the perfect setup - quiet pub with good food, steps from our place - Sierra Nevada on tap.  That is all I needed - they literally could have had seatless tricycles for chairs and made me use fish bones as eating utensils and I still would have been content.  But again, based on only the aforementioned things.   Let's move on to the staff: They're awful - having a conversation with the bartender was like tweezing pubes (your own).  The waitress was nasty - she had Cyndi Lauper's hair without the glitter or hygenical concern, and was also the conversational equivalent to an ass pimple. Now, normally this isn't an issue - I mean, how often do you go to a bar to talk to the staff.  But that's all there is really to do at this place - they only have 2 or 3 awkwardly placed televisions and a Golden Tee/dartboard area that 's large enough to only accommodate the one tank ass that thinks both of those activities are considered athletics.   Anyway, the main reason I hate this place comes down to one instance - essentially, my friends and I had ordered drinks right at last call.  We were drinking them, peacefully, and at a moderate pace.  5-10 minutes later, we are being told to leave - just put down your 3/4 full drinks and leave.  We objected, saying that you sold them to us minutes prior and we just wanted a few more minutes to finish them.  Keep in mind, there are probably 10 others still in the bar not being forced out.  At this point, the bouncer takes off his coat, revealing a wife beater and two flabby pipe cleaners that would make the blue haired woman on the Weasel at Target cringe, and then starts audibly punching his other hand's palm.  I should also mention, at this point there were 3 obviously underage hoodrats sitting at the end of the bar that the 30-something bouncer was most likely schtooping.  So, as we are still trying to civilly discuss the possibility of finishing our beers - all of a sudden, the rotund bartender decides to jump in on the fray by running around the bar towards us while screaming how we are ""pussies"" and should be able to slam our beers in the 5 minutes we were given.  Begrudgingly, we left - while the three 17 year-olds were allowed to stay and finish their roofied rum and diets, along with the rest of the 10 or so other patrons. We didn't want this - this hostility, this overreaction, this folly to mar any chance of us going here again because, again, we liked the place.  So, my roommate decided to go back and see if he could smooth things out - perhaps get an apology and end the night in each other's good graces.  Unfortunately, that is not what happened.  Instead he was what can best be described as ""choke slammed"" over the railing on the Oakley side of the bar.  This lead to police involvement, this lead to reports being filed. I hope this story helps you in determining if you go here or not.  It was the epitome of bad, non-traditional customer service - which ended in battery and assault.",-0.7443,0.839,0.075,0.087,0.5380685286935288

They have some good beers on tap and in the bottle. $2 PBRs keep it real. And the food is actually pretty good.

But I was really unhappy with the one experience I had here, and it was all due to the waitress. A bunch of us girls had gone out for a friend's birthday and this was going to be our first stop to try the menu and see if maybe Floyd's was the neighborhood pub we were seeking. The girl who was waiting on us was outer limits. She was wearing flip flops, didn't wash her hands, wasn't wearing any kind of apron and so had food and drink splashes on her, her hair was everywhere (including my drink) and she was really inattentive to us. She preferred to spend her time flirting and hanging on a group of guys a few tables down. I watched her down a shot, lick her fingers, and then pop lemon wedges in someone's drink. I ordered a martini and had to send it back because it was a completely different drink from what I had ordered. She got huffy like I'd made a personal affront to her. It took about ten minutes for her to get back to me with the correct drink. Having been a waitress myself, I know when a server is having a bad day or dealing with a bad crowd or manager, and I know when she is just a lousy server. This girl was just a lousy server and when my tip reflected that, she actually went to her boss and complained about it.  Still, I give Floyd's two stars and will give it another chance.  I like the menu, I dug the crowd, and if the girl is still working there, maybe she has learned a few things in the several months since my first visit.",-0.8479,0.871,0.052,0.078,0.34049145299145295
