I'm drooling just thinking about it. Bread was crunchy and the meat was succulent making for an excellent duo. The pasta was a very simple side... Good but carby with the sandwich. I wish I asked for salad, although I'm not sure if it's an option. The guy asked if I wanted fries or pasta. Maybe I could have subbed salad? SO got the pesto chicken salad and it was incredibly yummy! Very fresh tasting. Loooove this place. Definitely recommend!

2016-07-06,5.0,"The Girlfriend treats this place like a second home. When she's not answering her phone I can usually find her at a table here, halfway through a cappuccino served in a unique mug with her papers spread everywhere and her laptop open and her phone connected to the usb, charging and playing music that connects to her bluetooth headphones. The seating here is laid out in a very European fashion, meaning the tables sit close together for a more intimate and lively setting, though I can understand if people who are unaccustomed to this arrangement or have never been to a cafe in Paris (like me) find the spaces cramped and uncomfortable. Their milk based coffees are always the perfect ratio of foam and cream, creating a full bodied experience without much bite from the lightly roasted coffee beans. That being said, I usually get their Mexican hot chocolate. You can tell it's house made here, given that the cinnamon and vanilla accents compliment the melted semi-sweet chocolate that serves as the foundation of this sugary dream. It's so good that once it's ready and I sit with The Girlfriend neither of us talk, her nose deep into her work and me blowing on the hot chocolate, my breath creating temporary craters on the drink's surface, it's that thick. She's comparing U of C and Northwestern before transferring for her doctorate and researching the presidential candidates and deciding which health care plan is right for her.  The atmosphere has such a neighborhood quality to it that hours go by before you're ready to go. We compare cell phone providers and the benefits packages in her open enrollment. She's fretting over what option to go with now that they've split the HMO. She asks me what's my level of deductible and I panic for a second because I don't even know. I ask can't she change plans if she doesn't like it, and she nearly spits out her cappuccino (""Not after open enrollment!""). She sounds so shocked by my question that I wonder what am I actually covered by. When did I make these choices? I assume if I did, I researched every option thoroughly to make sure I didn't pick the wrong one. But this still doesn't comfort me (Read: more hot chocolate). The crowd ranges from hipsters to blue collar to families. The interior is decorated in vibrant colors. This must be what it's like to live in a Crayola box, I'm thinking while staring out the window at gridlock and the pacing teens dancing under the bus stop canopy, swinging their braids while music plays off someone's phone as the others record all this and share online. There's gang graffiti on the stop sign that no one seems to notice.  I can tell by her eyes this is not The Girlfriend's first cappuccino. I myself am swimming in a chocolate wonderland. Seriously, get the hot chocolate. I'm practically a pool of satisfaction when I realize The Girlfriend's talking and saying how you have to have coffee flowing through your veins, get through days on 4 hours sleep, just to maintain. Just to keep the plates from spinning on the poles. Forget improving. Forget changing. I tell her not to worry so much. (""All high cognitive mammals display the capacity to worry,"" she says. ""Worrying is a sign of intelligence.""). It sounds like we're not going anywhere for a while so I order the mollete. It's served on sliced pieces of fresh bread, though bolio would be much preferred, with a thick layer of oaxacan cheese that they toast to a perfect gold tinge, leaving the outer rim of the melted cheese white and creamy. The black bean spread is seasoned with a house blend that gives the sandwich a meaty flavor even without the ham. I don't think I can finish it and before I know it it's gone. I look at my phone and three hours have passed by. How? The girlfriend is nowhere near ready to go, already ordering another cappuccino. Three hot chocolates?

Unfortunately when it came down to the food & the service everything seemed to fall really short! I really wanted to love this place, believe me! The reviews obviously had me convinced that this would be a great place to have lunch on a Saturday with my boyfriend. When we walked in the place was somewhat busy, I'd say we came in right before their afternoon rush!  Entering was really cold, awkward, and I personally felt really uncomfortable. We were never greeted and just stood around for about 5 minutes before seating ourselves at the bar. I really didn't understand what the deal was, not a single person acknowledged us. I could understand if the place was packed but it wasn't at the time. My boyfriend and I sat around for another 5 minutes before a the front guy taking orders gave us menus. We probably sat around another 10 minutes before he came back to take our order.  Ordering was very hard. Not because we couldn't decide on what we wanted but because the guy taking our order barely talked to us! I wasn't looking to have a conversation, I had questions about the menu that he decided to ignore and awkwardly brush off like he didn't hear me. The place can get really loud and I feel like he used that factor as a way to avoid all interaction with us while ordering... it was definitely an awkward experience, I'm sure the line forming behind us picked up on it! I would say it was a WTF just happened kind of moment! I immediately made a mental note of their lack of service. I was hoping our experience would get better but unfortunately it gets worse!! I honestly think the (front) guy taking orders was having a bad day, it would explain the lack of communication, zero interaction, avoided all our questions, and even denied all of my requests! After ordering I was still in shock, I watched as other walk-in customers awkwardly place orders! We weren't the only ones!!!  The food was pretty bland, I went with the Veggie Burger and Pasta and my boyfriend decided on the Cuban Sandwich. FYI Everything is prepared in a Toaster!! That threw me off, I was so curious how my Black Bean Patty would turn out and it was totally dried out and disappointing!!! I waved over the guy that took our order -- he never introduced himself so I don't know his name -- I asked if I could get a little side of extra Mayo and he said ""No, there is mayo already on it""... I know that but I'd like a little more, my burger was DRY!!! SERIOUSLY!!! I had to wave him over again and then I asked if I could have some ketchup? And he walks away!?!?! WTF?!!? Seriously I can go on and on! The sad part is the fact that the place was packed by the time our food was served so there was an audience that witnessed the entire awkward experience! Overall, if you are looking to PICK UP & GO, the coffee is great which is why I'd give this place a star.

All I can tell you about the coffee at Cafe Jumping Bean is that, whether it's the iced mochas or lattes, it's damn good. But coffee isn't even what lures me in. It's their sandwiches. I've been living in Pilsen for almost two years, and it took an episode of Chicago's Best to motivate me to try them. In particular, the ""mollete"", which is toasted French bread served open face, slathered with black beans, Oaxacan cheese, and some of the freshest damn pico de gallo I've ever tasted. I like to add ham and avocado on mine. I've also tried their Cuban and focaccia sandwiches. They were both just as good. They're almost entering ""can do no wrong"" territory in my book. It's the first coffee shop ever to entice me to come in just for a meal. Game changing stuff, people.

Few sandwiches stop me in my tracks, but this Cuban did. It is just five ingredients (so far as I could tell) - pork, ham, sour pickle, bread and cheese - but this was tasted especially delicious. I liked how the pork was tender and marinated, and how the pickles crunch. The soft texture of the meats was perfectly balanced by crunchy bread, and thank goodness, the bread wasn't enormous! I would get this again, but I'm worried I'd be missing out on something else here. The white satin mocha was also delicious, and came with a lot of whipped cream on top.

2014-10-26,4.0,"I just felt ""Pilsen"" this morning and wanted to explore the neighborhood.  I stumbled upon some mouth-watering pictures of coffee drinks so here we come. The place was tiny and pretty much maximize its capacity with an ample amount of traffic coming into the cafe.  Remember that: this was a gorgeous Sunday morning in Chicago.  Smart Chicagoans would not give up this opportunity for a nice, relaxing brunch.   Finally it was our term to order.  We got a large mocha almond delight, a large chocolate Mexicano, veggie foccaccia, and ham & cheese melt.  We chose to dine in and found a place to settle down.  To be honest, it was a bit confusing to determine what to do if you choose to dine in.  I think you can go ahead grab a table and someone will come to you to take your order.  However, all three (3) young men who worked there were true multi-taskers and they did everything from taking orders, barista, serving, cleaning, and bussing.  This isn't an exhaustive list of things they accomplished.  Thus honestly, it's better to go up the counter, order, and pay at the end.   I dug my mocha almond delight.  If you enjoy the smell and taste of almond, hey you will be a fan as well.  The almond blend with the mocha was truly a showstopper.  The chocolate Mexicano was rich, mellow, and balanced beverage for people might want a ""pick-me-up"" straight out of the bed.  That was something you will have, perhaps with a cozy fur blanket?  The sandwiches were decent but well-customized into a nice bite size.  I would say stick with the drinks because they are the real deal!   The street parking nearby is free on the weekend, but I would say ""check"" to ensure it's free so that there is no surprises.  I think there may be wifi available, yet this place, in my opinion, is in between a coffee shop and a diner.  Therefore, I wouldn't come here with an intention to get any serious work done.  Maybe it's more of a coffee shop on a weekday?  Price we paid was $23 after tip.  Not bad, but you will find one cheaper in Bridgeport, the neighborhood in proximity.",0.9893,0.817,0.153,0.03,0.6296296296296298

The service is always fast even though they are usually quite busy.   As far as studying or being productive at jumping bean, there is free WIFI but it is usually pretty crowded so I imagine it would not be a great spot for this.  I'd say this is the one thing jumping bean is lacking as a coffee shop.  Overall, this is a great spot to get a quality and quick lunch&coffee.",-0.505,0.887,0.053,0.061,0.5208333333333333

If I were to compare Jumping Bean's baked goods to my mothers, I would say jumping bean's baker bakes with more skill while my mother bakes with more love. Go ahead and try them for yourself. Coffee. I drink mine black and Jumping Bean's coffee has a nice taste and it isn't too acidic. I could stand the coffee here to be a little stronger, but the caffeine from it seems to stand up to my tolerance. I'd hypothesize that they use a light roast which is high on caffeine and slightly lower on flavor. To benchmark, I'd say the coffee is much better than Dunkin Donuts and has a similar flavor to a Starbucks Blonde.  Sidebar : Dunkin Donuts Black Coffee is Repulsive. There is a reason they put so much cream in sugar up in there! Smells are awesome here: Coffee, sandwiches, and old fashioned baking. I really need to come here for a meal sometime.

I definitely recommend getting a foccacia sandwich-they have a couple of veg and meat options with the bread so you can get what u like won't be disappointed. They also have a number of different donuts and scones. I got a chocolate chip scone to go. It was HUGE and was pretty good although it was a tad less sweeter than I like it.

Didn't get to try the food so this review is based purely on ambiance and service. The place is small, a little cramped, and not very cozy. I think they do this on purpose, along with shutting off the wi-fi during the lunch rush to increase turnover. I was pretty pissed that the internet was shut off because it doesn't note that on their yelp page- nor does the restaurant have any signs posted warning about it. I was telecommuting from my laptop so that put me behind on a lot of work. When I asked a server about it he just told me they turn it off during lunch, with no explanation, and no apology- I think he just wanted us to leave since we were already pretty finished with our drinks and occupying some prime table space- Ha. Too bad we decided to sit and wait it out until our parking meter expired- Their Mexican hot chocolate is pretty good though, but not worth it for me to return.",-0.0384,0.869,0.065,0.066,0.6071992110453649

My friend had the iced version and it might've been even more delicious. He also bought a sandwich which came with a side of chips or pasta, plenty of food to go around. The cafe was cozy and cut, not a ton of seats, but then again I went on a friday evening so I was lucky enough to snag one just as someone left. Oh and the service was superb. They even brought the food/drinks to our table for us and wouldn't let us pay until we were ready to leave.

I order 1/2 sandwich and soup but the main thing that knocked me down was the chocolate de abuelita! (Grandma's chocolate), oh wow, they serve it up in a 16 oz glass and it comes out hot. I absolutely am living for this ""made at home"" chocolate.  Granted it can get busy during lunch time, or for that matter it can get busy at any time of the day, but it is worth the stop for a nice danish or hot chocolate. Parking is sometimes a little bit exhausting but I have been very fortunate to find metered parking right in front.  The place is artsy and I am sure you will love it.  Now, honestly. I am not a fan of the sandwiches, but the soups are awesome. I have had the tuna salad and mehhh, and I have had the corned beef and again mehhh, but the soup is wonderful and the chocolate. YES! Could be due to me being a sandwich snob, but everyone loves them. So let me not knock it down for that. I don't like to be told that my bread ""has"" to be toasted for warning up the corned beef. Sorry, I don't like heated or toasted on all sandwiches. But I give them a four star because I was knocked down from the chocolate.

Even though the cafe was busy, she made no effort to allow myself and my coffee partner through. It's no wonder the waiter had difficulty clearing her table. After the incident she made a huge scene - more embarrassing herself than anyone else. She neglects to state in her description that the owner/manager was polite and simply stated when directly accused of sabotage by her, in a very confrontational way, that she had taken her laptop into a restaurant at her own risk. After this, she confronted a policeman - insisting that he listen to her tale of woe and trying to persuade him to support her. To our delight the police officer, himself a customer, stated that this was not a criminal, but a civil matter and in that case should be taken up with the proper authorities. The whole scenario reminded me of someone who wanted to blame others for her own mistakes and misery - dragging them down into her own morass. So there's another version.

I think in theory it was meant to be a neighborhood joint where people would come, have some coffee, and move on. It does not have a giant back room or a basement to put the sit-all-day coffee crew.  Ok, on to the cafe. This place is of the neighborhood of PIlsen. So you can expect a Mexican/ Chicano vibe, yet you can also expect to get all the typical coffee shop food and beverages here prepared quickly. I had a double espresso and found it to be quite good. We had a large party with kids and the servers were very friendly and accommodating.  Great espressos, cream sodas (yeah, there is cream in there), and hot cocoa to die for!  I am glad my sister got me a T-shirt. Very cool Mexican style print like a Posada. Friendly note: Why are hipsters always whining like babies? Who knows? But, as others have pointed out, if you are looking for a place to chill for 8 hours riding a bottomless cup of coffee this is not the place, and they have curtailed the wifi so that the place can actually stay in business.  Of course, the UIC library and the Lozano branch of the Chicago public library have wifi. If the public library was good enough for Marx then it is good enough for hipsters! Hey, if you are actually writing a novel and not just saying that you are, you will be more productive at the library don't  you think?  If they had the second floor perhaps they could let those tables go to the wifi cruisers for hours, but they don't.

2011-10-02,2.0,"The Cafe Jumping Bean is a small cafe-concept shop on 18th between Laflin and Blue Island. It is a small cafe, providing the corner shop cafe presence that it literally is. The coffee and other products are all mediocre, price is good, service is very good, ambiance is average. The cafe has a small raised area with a few tables on the window side facing 18th Street. On the other side of the cafe entrance, there are another few tables along the wall (perpendicular to 18th Street). Both seating areas, in this ""L"" shape, with the entrance in the nook of the ""L"", wrap around the barista station / register in the heart of the store.  Coffee and other products of the Jumping Bean are all mediocre quality. The service is very good. Good service makes the Jumping Bean an inviting place to enter and return to. Pricing is appropriate. The cafe is a bit too small to have ambiance be a dominant factor. The Jumping Bean feels like a cafe for about the 1/2 hour that it takes you to order and drink your coffee. Then it's time to go elsewhere. It is too small a space to hang out. It's hard not to feel self-conscious about reading a book or working on a laptop after your coffee is gone. The cafe is just too small. Speaking of laptops, the cafe is so small that you would feel guilty using the WiFi for more than 1/2 hour anyway. The cafe is not a bad place to meet a friend or go with a friend, so long as there is enough table space for you the two of you to sit when you are there. Also, it is definitely not a coffee and pastry cafe. It would never cross our minds to go to Jumping Bean after eating dinner at Nuevo Leon. There might be poetry readings and music performances at the cafe, but I can't visualize where the audience would sit. As for location, the Jumping Bean is the neighborhood place. Forget about parking --- the Jumping Bean's customers don't drive there because they live in Pilsen. (And, it is not worth driving to the cafe as a destination of its own.) The cafe is right in the heart of Pilsen. It is well placed for a short break from the library. Anybody walking to the Pink Line station in the morning can pick up a drink here on the way.  In summary, the Cafe Jumping Bean is a neighborhood coffee shop that is a bit too small to qualify as a cafe. Its products are about average in quality, pricing is decent, and service is very good.

It came with tomatoes, lettuce and onion and the burger itself was a little spicy, which tasted amazing on the whole. The burger was huge and I finished it within 15 minutes of careful chewing. The burger comes with a side of pasta or chips, and I got the chips. The chips were your standard potato chips, but nothing too overbearing. I tried my friend's pasta and it was really great! I'd probably get the pasta next time. In the end, we got two raspberry cheesecakes to share amongst the four of us. And let me tell you, I live for cheesecake and this was one awesome cheesecake. Very smooth and not very cheese-y. The portion was big, and there was plenty for everyone to share.  The black bean burger less than $5 and the cheesecake was $3.25.

The combination of order at the counter (like a normal coffee shop) and paying after you're done is strange, but hey, whatever works.  Maybe they were hoping I'd order a sandwich.",0.9477,0.867,0.125,0.008,0.5357253086419753

As for us, it was two tables (separate) of parties of 3 and 4 respectively, and the air was alive with chatter. I had to put on headphones and crank up the volume in order to focus on my work. I felt bad for J. because she didn't have music to listen to, but somehow managed to block out the noise (I also offered her my headphones, for all those who were wondering).  However, since I have been here before, I can safely say this place is quite relaxing when the mood of the clientele is studying, reading, etc. Plus, it's a cozy little corner shop...can't argue with that!

2008-01-08,4.0,Great atmosphere but was absolutely packed and we couldn't hang out - we had to take our coffee to go.  It warrants a trip earlier in the morning to secure a good spot by the window.  They also have the coolest coffee shop t-shirt I've ever seen.,0.8591,0.812,0.188,0.0,0.67
2007-11-06,5.0,"jumping bean is the reason why i've became addicted to cafes and refuse going to starbucks.  since high school, i've been hooked, and now, i have the fortune to live two blocks away.  i love the regular early-morning before-work crowd.  the staff is supernice and really knows their customers, especially the owner, eleazar (who is a sox fan - big plus).  the rotating art from local artists add to the already colorful atmosphere.  the window seats are perfect for taking in the buzzing street activity in pilsen.  free wi-fi, conversations about art and politics, graphic design students on their laptops, selections from xm radio, and games of chess make it more a community than just another corner storefront.  sure, i'm a little upset that more people are finding out about MY spot, but it absolutely deserves the attention, after establishing itself as the first 'real' cafe in pilsen over a decade ago.  magically, everytime i've been there even on crowded afternoons, there is always JUST enough room for everyone.  oh, and the coffee, pastries, and food are great too.",0.9071,0.887,0.087,0.026,0.538658491267187
2007-08-31,5.0,"Not much of a coffee/cafe type of person myself, but I love this place. Good food, and one of the few places in Pilsen or Villita where I'll get non-Mexican food.

2007-07-29,5.0,"LOVE this place. there's just something about how it makes me feel... it's perfect if you need a cup of coffee and a bagel on the go, if you're meeting friends for a full blown out lunch, or if you have a huge stack of work that needs to be done. usually i just sit myself here for hours, and nobody seems to mind. :- ( : takes cash only. :- ) : free wi-fi, pretty windows, friendly and trusting service, lots of light and colors and local artwork, the screen door open there during the summer, and the fact that the owner will gladly allow you to go to the atm machine around the corner to GET cash (see? told you they were trusting).",0.983,0.775,0.225,0.0,0.7200000000000001

2007-06-27,5.0,"If anyone comes to visit me, there's a good chance they'll be going to Jumping Bean Cafe.  I'm always looking for excuses to enjoy a warm, melty, gooey turkey focaccia sandwich with red onions and green peppers.  It's amazing how fresh and delicious everything is here.  The iced coffee is great with brown sugar from the individual dispensers at each table.  Don't even think about ordering a tall, mocha-locha, choco, no foam, lowfat, something or other here--the coffee is basic and delicious. When I'm here, I feel better about humanity.  Maybe it's the blend of cultures or knowing that I'm supporting a local businessperson instead of a corporation.  Maybe it's the creative art that changes every 6 weeks or the unhurried feel of students and artists.  Whatever the reason, I'll keep coming here for my lazy Sunday mornings.   You're always welcome to join me!",0.9883,0.722,0.25,0.028,0.5631578947368422
2007-06-24,4.0,"Jumping Bean is a great place to stop by when you're dying for a jolt to your day or if you want to laze around pretending to get work done.  I've never gotten anything other than coffee, so I can't attest to the food, but the low prices and colorful atmosphere are a breath of fresh air in a city drowning in Starbucks.  I know some people aren't in love with the coffee, but I've never had a problem with it, and today's iced Americano really hit the spot.  Definitely not as weak as some others I've tried.  My only gripe is that it's cash only but that's kind of par for the course with me.",0.7646,0.791,0.139,0.07,0.6045454545454546

2007-01-19,4.0,"The best part about Cafe Jumping Bean is its atmosphere.  It's bright, warm, energetic, and obviously a neighborhood spot.  The food and coffee are just okay, nothing to rave about.  It's not bad, just nothing that I'd ever have a craving for.  However, the dessert is great.  Granted, I think most desserts are great, but their cheesecake and cookies really are pretty special.  And I had a wonderful chocolate cake here once. If you go to Jumping Bean, bring a book, get a treat for yourself, and stay long enough really just enjoy being there.",0.989,0.65,0.35,0.0,0.5687830687830687
