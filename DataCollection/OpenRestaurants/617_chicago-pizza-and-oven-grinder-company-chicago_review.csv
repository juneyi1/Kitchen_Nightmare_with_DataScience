2017-09-03,1.0,"I am exceptionally disappointed in the wasted trip made today, to CPOG.  I drove from Indianapolis, for the sole purpose of having a meal at your establishment, knowing there may be a long wait, given the reviews.  I am beyond angry that I allowed myself to be lied to, by the little cretin, at the door.  He told me the wait would be 2.5 hours.  At the two hour mark, I double-checked with him and he told me it'd be another 30 minutes.  Ninety minutes later, I'm still standing at the door and he consistently seats people who put their names in, after me.  I don't know where the breakdown is, whether it's his own ineptitude or if this is a result of his training, from above, but I am vehemently upset that I was wronged so blatantly and have no one to bring it up to.   I so wish I could have been a part of the masses that sing your praises.  Sadly, I'm just not a member of the cool kids club, apparently.   I can't be made whole, financially or emotionally, from this.  What do you suggest?",-0.7724,0.825,0.063,0.112,0.48750000000000004
2017-09-02,4.0,Special and tasty pizza @ Chicago! It's pizza bowl! Very cheesy but as a cheese fan I love it! However the line was way too long. We had to wait for 3 hours for the table. So we decided to order Togo. For Togo it's just 40 mins wait. We ate it at the park close by.  For 40 mins togo's wait I'll do it. But for 3 hours....hm.... probably not.... salad and bread is also good. One pound of pizza is totally good for two person!,0.966,0.798,0.202,0.0,0.6285714285714286
2017-09-02,3.0,"I knew the wait time was gonna be long, but never again!! We called this place after the Cubs game to find out it was an hour wait. Not sounding too bad so we ended up getting an Uber to this place. We walked in and put our name on the list, the guy in charge now told us an hour and a half wait. At this point, we ordered a beer and began waiting outside. Waiting was a commitment at this point. Two hours later, my friend was asking if we were any closer to getting called. The guy in charge of names response was something that reminded me of the soup nazi from Seinfeld. He clearly didn't want to be asked questions and said something along the lines of we'll get to you when we get to you. At this point we already waited two hours, there was no turning back, but we did debate the idea of leaving. People we saw come after us were now getting seated before us. Now we waited two and a half hours. We asked the guy in charge again and he apologized, told us 30 more mins. Someone else asked him the same question and his response was ""not my problem if people can't hear their name"". Keep in mind this guy isn't screaming out any names. He'll maybe call your name twice in a medium level and that's it. Ten mins away from giving up and having our night completely ruined, we finally get a table. I felt a bit a relief that I was about to finally knock off a restaurant on my bucket list. Been wanting to go for a few years now. We ordered the seasoned bread as well as the pizza pot pie. I definitely can't say anything bad about the food, it was pretty good. At the same time, I wasn't jumping with astonishment. It was a mouthful of cheese, crust and meat sauce. Nothing I would have committed waiting 3 hours for nor do I recommend anyone else doing it either. We didn't realize it was cash only either, probably our fault for not reading reviews (sarcasm). Overall, Chicago has a lot of great pizza places. I wouldn't recommend dealing with this headache unless you must cross it off your bucket list. 2.5 stars sounds more suitable for this review, but I gave a generous 3 since the food and table service was good. This place really needs to expand and have a better system to save a lot of headaches. This will be my first and last experience here, but the business always has customers out the door, so I'm sure it doesn't matter.",0.9937,0.796,0.148,0.057,0.41437908496732023

Seated fairly quick, 1st time ever.  Repeated our order numerous times to the waiter.  He was to busy trying to be witty to get the order right.  Understandable.  But, 3 of our party was done for a very long time before the 4th person in our party got there meal.  No apology.  Horrible feeling to sit with no meal and watch everyone else eat.  Meal itself, went downhill.  Pizza Pot Pie had barely any meatsauce.  Manager could really care less.  Service and quality way down at this Chicago landmark.

The wait is out of this world- try to get there when they open otherwise you're looking at at least an hour wait... weekends in assuming longer. The cheese, the soft, doughy pizza bread .... , I have dreams about this place. IMO, the veggie (basically cheese, mushroom and sauce) is better than the meat (ground sausage) pizza. I've done carry out a few times because the wait was insane, it honestly is just as good, just bc the dough is suppose to be pretty soft, not crunchy, so if it does get a little soggy it's still delicious! When I have friends in town, I honestly take them here instead of Gino's , Giordano's, etc... Maybe I'll get this for dinner tonight lol.

The waiter explained the options, which I wish they would have spelled out on the menu. - white or wheat - meat sauce or meatless sauce - mushrooms or no mushrooms (I feel like I'm missing an option...) We also shared an order of Mediterranean bread. It was good, but I probably wouldn't order it again. I'm not a fan of how it was way too large for the dish it was served on that it swept the table.  I ended up having leftovers of both the bread and the pot pie, and they both reheated amazingly well in the toaster oven a few days later (especially the pot pie).

2017-08-18,4.0,"Echoing most other reviews here, but this is mostly for future reference: First, the pluses: the service wasn't bad considering that the restaurant was INCREDIBLY packed (more on that in the ""minus"" column). Our server was very friendly and took care of the drinks right away. We ordered a very nice Cabernet that paired off perfectly with the Mediterranean flat bread. That bread alone was worth the wait; excellent seasoning, melt-in-your mouth good.  Then came the pizza pot-pie. I ordered a personal with meat sauce and mushroom. The cheese was rich, gooey and delicious. The bolognese-style sauce was tangy and expertly flavored. Great crust. In the future I might skip the mushrooms because they're served whole and not sliced; I only like them that way with steak. My date ordered the vegetarian and it was excellent as well.  Minus: obviously, the wait. It was about two hours, but we really wanted to try this place so we went ahead. Thankfully it was a nice day and Lincoln Park Zoo is a short walk away, so that kept us entertained for an hour or so.  The quarters were a little cramped, but that goes with being as busy as they are.  Make sure you bring cash, as that was the only payment accepted.

2017-08-13,2.0,"We came here on a Friday early evening to try the pizza pot pies. It was busy and we were told it would be an hour and forty minute wait. The difference in their system is that your name is not taken. Their hosts remembers faces and will come to grab you once your table is ready, a little unsettling for customers. The wait time actually ended up being quite a bit longer (for us it was 2.5 hours. Were we actually in the right seating order we should have been? We'll never know.) but you can grab drinks at the bar and bring them back out while you wait.  We ordered the Mediterranean bread and a 1 lb. pizza pot pie for 3 people to share. The bread is AMAZING. You can choose white or wheat bread and the seasoning mix they top it with is plentiful and delicious. The pizza pot pie in my opinion was just ok. Flavor wise it wasn't anything I could see myself craving. The sauce is more of a bolognese style (which my friend really loved) and the mushrooms were whole and large, baked right into the pizza. With having the bread first, I think 3 people sharing the larger pot pie was plenty of food.  I definitely would not come back for to the wait again (but would be more inclined to if there were a more traditional wait system).

2017-08-07,1.0,"Save your time and money. I'm from Chicago--I'm used to long waits at restaurants and long waits for pizza. But the customer service is downright bad. We sat at the bar for over an hour, weren't asked if we wanted a second round of drinks, and didn't have our waters refilled. The bar wasn't crowded, it was just a lazy bartender who preferred to eat his own dinner rather than serve customers (and he was eating Mediterranean takeout instead of food from the restaurant, if that's not a red flag). He was also rude when we asked if they serve food at the bar. I'm sure he is asked that a lot, but why management thinks it's a good idea to have two rows of bar seating and not serve food at the bar is beyond me. We decided to order carryout instead of waiting another 1-2 hours since the service at the bar was so bad. We were told they couldn't give us Italian salad dressing for a to-go order unless we bought the $8 tiny bottle. They made up an excuse about not having to-go salad dressing cups, which was clearly inaccurate given the other two non-Italian salad dressings they provided.  The rest of the food was disappointingly bland. The cheese was good, but the pizza on a whole was just meh. It needed more sauce, flavor, or something. We also got a meatball grinder, being excited for the garlic bread. While the portion was very big, it ended up being a whole lot of dry, unseasoned, bland meatball. If the bread was garlic bread, we couldn't tell. It lacked salt and other basic seasonings, which is a disappointment given the wait.

Our friends go there at least once every year! It is one of their favorite city restaurants. Its very small and they do not take reservations or credit cards. My friends got there about an hour before us and put our names in our wait was a little over 3 hours but let me tell it was well worth it. While we waited we drank wine and the pours were extra heavy each time. (Made the time pass by faster LOL) The service from bartenders and servers was great and accomodating! The menu isn't all that big because they are known for their pot pie pizza and oven grinders. We started with the mediterranean bread which was so delicious. A light and thin pita style bread with all the italian seasonings! It is big enough for 4 people, definitely a shareable starter. Three of us then ordered the pizza pot pies and one got an oven grinder. The pizza pot pies were everything! (I know most Chicagoans say it doesn't compare to your Chicago style or thin crust, but its not supposed to.) Completely different styles. We all got the half pounders and it was just enough food for all us. I think what really made it for me was the homemade sauce with all the veggies, sausage, and herbs. You could taste all the herbs. My husband love that the mushroom in the pizza were whole. And honestly the little show they put on is also great! The oven grinder was good as well per the men in the group but not as tasty as the pot pies. My husband loves his thin crust pizza and usually dismisses anything that is not thin crust.

Both were extremely underwhelming and very disappointing. If you are from New York you will definitely be disappointed! ! I know deep dish is completely different from traditional New York pizza and we shouldn't compare, so that's NOT what I'm doing but it's not worth the wait or money just from a quality standpoint. The best part of the dishes were the cheese, which is not worth $45/$50. Lesson learned though.",0.598,0.828,0.095,0.077,0.49890442890442877
2017-07-24,4.0,"3.5 stars- This place fascinates me. I feel like I've time traveled back to the 1970's dining here. I imagine the decor and menu had been relatively untouched since when it first opened. On a Saturday night the wait at 9pm for two people was 2 hours. I am curious if CPOG gets a cut of the ATM profits from the place being cash only. I also think the long wait time is genius. They will give you one glass of water while you wait and after that you are at the mercy of the bar. I would see people be 3-4 beers/glasses of wine deep before they get to their table. They charge per glass of soda (a habit from the 70's or pure profit). Your best bet to beat the bar curse is to order a draft beer (they only come in 23oz sizes) and sip.  The food is well priced. I enjoyed the salad and mixing dressings. The poppy seed dressing reminded me of a dressing my ex stepmother used to buy (likely what she had bought since the 70's). I don't understand the bread. It wasn't that great to me rather dry, you have to use the garlic cream dressing to make it less dry. I think this might be a chicago thing to love this bread. I overheard a Chicago local say this bread was better than similar breads at other places. The pizza in unique in regards to a pizza experience/ presentation. I was hoping it would have butter dough like a pot pie has but it is like the bread dough on top. The pizza meat sauce reminded me of my father's spaghetti sauce. Not the best pizza but not the worst.  I enjoyed this place out of fascination with its business tactics, restaurant time travel, and for the nostalgia of my ex stepmom's dated house from the 70's. Overall, if you don't fall into the drink/ bar trap the restaurant is a great value for the price.",0.987,0.818,0.144,0.038,0.5276785714285713

2017-07-21,5.0,"This place was SO good! There are a few pot pie pizza places or there, and you would think that the little show they put on when they serve you their pot pie is what all the hype is about, but this place is more than that. Literally every bite is such quality, flavorful food that you know they use only the best ingredients. We got the house salad and the Mediterranean bread to share. I never thought I'd love such a simple salad so much, but I really did. Again, the quality of the ingredients were just amazing. The tomatoes were so firm, lettuce so crisp..just a behest salad. Best part? The dressings! Oh my God those dressings were SO good! One was a poppyseed base and the other a sour cream base - so unique and just so good! The Mediterranean bread seems simple in the sense that it's some seasoning on bread, but that seasoning? To die for. A great combo we found? Take the white dressing from the salad and dip the Mediterranean bread into it, amazing.  Finally, I had th half pound pizza pot pie with meat sauce and mushrooms. I was expecting cut up mushrooms but there were two whole mushrooms in there instead. The only thing I'd hope for is that they were cut up so they were more spread or throughout the pizza. The pizza itself was amazing. Even the cheese was so rich in unique flavor. I'd definitely recommend it, but I'd also recommend sharif with someone if you do get the salad and bread to start. My fiancé, sin kings and I came in starving but none of us could finish our pizza still. We got there on a Thursday at exactly 9:00pm. The guy who seats you doesn't take down names, but remembers you by face which I thought was interesting. He said 45min and although he definitely sat the party right after me before us, he did seat us at 9:45 on the dot. Impressive on time and remembering our face, but I'd still suggest taking down names to ensure parties are seated in the exact order they came in, not an estimate. At the end of your meal, they give you a little chocolate covered toffee, which is nice! Overall, they don't offer a ton of different items on their menu, but they've perfected what they do offer. :P TIP: it is CASH only so be prepared.",0.9983,0.729,0.223,0.048,0.562641723356009

I overheard a mention of ""make sure to start seating 4 people at 5 chair tables"". In my opinion it's the look of people standing around outside waiting to try the food that keeps them still busy.  Everything else was great and enjoyed the experience thereafter.

The restaurant is pretty easy to miss from the street but upon entering you know you're somewhere special. It all starts with the all-wood décor that just feels very homey and warm. Additionally, there is the nice touch of the maitre d' who does not take your name, only the size of your party (as he remembers faces very well). With a reservation you should have no trouble being sat nearly immediately in one of their booths or sparse tables. The booth is the way to go as it can easily seat 6 people without issue. As is tradition for our family, all we get is the Mediterranean Bread and the Salad. Depending on how hungry we are we might get a pizza as well. But the bread and salad are wonderful in and of themselves - and the salad dressings... DELICIOUS on the salad and the bread! As for the pizzas, I recommend you get one just for the pageantry of it. Served in a piping hot bowl they turn it upside-down and voilà! Pizza! The staff is all very friendly and accommodating and the prices are right where you'd expect them to be for an establishment such as this.

Like many, I saw the Food Network segment on social media featuring Marc Murphy raving about the pizza pot pie and had to come check it out. Yes, there will be a wait - even at 9pm on a Thursday evening. The restaurant itself is quite small and tight and has a dark, tavern feel to it. The host is a very friendly guy that doesn't take your name down, he just remembers your face and how many people you have in your party.  The small chef's salad is enough to feed two. The salad was actually quite nice but let's be real, how hard is it to screw up a salad? As long as your vegetables are fresh and your dressing is up to par - you're good to go. I really enjoyed all three of the dressings that it came with. The sour cream garlic and sweet & sour poppyseed mixed together quite nicely to create a flavor-packed salad. The Italian dressing was also decent but did not mix well with the others. The salad is big enough to where you can play around with the dressings. The Mediterranean bread is a simple yet tasty creation. The flat bread itself is so big that it dangles over the plate and onto your dining table. Let's just hope they do a good job of cleaning their tables here. When it says ""serves 2-4"" it really means ""serves 4"". The only way it serves 2 is if you plan to eat ONLY this with a salad. It's a fun dish because you tear it and eat it with your hands. The flavors are delicious and I rather enjoy dipping it in their sour cream garlic dressing that came with the salad.  The half pounder pizza pot pie was underwhelming. My favorite part was the cheese. Yummy, melted gooeyness. The rest of the pot pie was just so-so. It's basically a bowl of spaghetti meat sauce, whole button mushrooms, and Wisconsin cheese all wrapped/covered with Sicilian dough. The tomato meat sauce wasn't as flavorful as I thought it should be and the dough was just alright.

There is no pizza, no Chicago deep dish anywhere but instead a twist on Stromboli which is limited to a few variations, and for pepperoni lovers, go elsewhere because there is none. Waited two hours for a table, ordered from the pleasant staff, ate and left. Nothing spectacular and not somewhere we would go again.

I had actually tried to call the restaurant to inquire about Valet parking, but no one ever picked up the phone. So we arrive at 3:50pm the restaurant has a posting on the door that it opens at 4pm.. i do not know if this is normally how it is that they open whenever.. but we were very lucky to be seated immediately.. to one of only a handfull of very close tables near the front. You can opt for a very claustrophobic booth.. but that was not what i call enjoyable.  As soon as we were seated we were greeted, the drink order and menu, the menu consists of 3 major food types ""Grinders"" i.e. Massive subs that are baked. The pizza pot pie, and massive salads. And their famous table cloth sized Mediterranean bread. The pot pies come in 2 sizes, half pount or pound loaded with a sausage meat sauce, whole mushrooms, green peppers and loaded with provolone cheese. The pot pies are pricey and they come in individual sizes...we ordered the Mediterranean bread that was delicious.. loaded with seasons.. tasted almost like pizza hut garlicy bread... ordered the American salad with swiss cheese provolone  and off the bone ham.. also the in house dressings are to die for... they have garlic dressing and poppy seed!! Unreal how good it was.. side not they bring the Mediterranean bread on a small plate.. literally table clothing the table.. and the heaping salad was also om a small plate fling all over the table... so if you are a germapobe... this place may trigger you..well on to the pot pies.. how were they... delicious!! The bread that is the bowl holding the meat sauce was moist the meat sauce was very tasty...the cheese was gooey delicious.. and as we ate we saw a never end train of customers coming through the door loading the place up.. going from no wait.. to half hour wait..to hour..to two hour... where people were standing outside waiting... in droves...any advice to you is get here early!! And they do offer valet for $10 dollars, use it you will have no choice.. parking sucks around here.. final bill for a salad 2 pot pies 2 cokes and Mediterranean bread..$64 dollars pretty pricey but worth it to try something unique and different.. this is not a weekly or monthly visit type place.. its a once in a great while type place... its no lie a hassle to get to.. crowded... touristy.. and kinda pricey.",0.897,0.884,0.066,0.05,0.6230620155038761

That's what we did and I'd recommend that if you can't imagine waiting that long for a table. The pizza takes about 40 minutes to bake and came out delicious. It was super cheesy, more layers of cheese than should be legal on a pizza. The toppings were sausage and mushrooms - you can either get just sausage or sausage and mushrooms - there are no other options. The mushrooms weren't to my taste, but the sausage was really good.

I only received three mushrooms in my whole pot pie. The pot pie is basically dough, cheese, sauce, and a few mushrooms. I only ate the middle and didn't even finish it. I thought the sauce was too sweet and the bread was a little bland. Along with the cheese it felt like it didn't go together. My husband on the other hand loved his. He even finished mine.

I used to take the bus past this place every day and there would always be groups of people waiting outside for their table.

But when one of my friends was in town visiting and wanted to come here, I figured I had to eventually try this place. And boy oh boy am I glad I did!

This isn't one of your typical pizza shops where you get to pick out of a variety of toppings, but I actually prefer it that way. Less choices, less thinking. We also ordered the rum ice cream at the end of our meal-- you will be full, but trust me, it is worth it.  For portion sizes, the three of us each got our own half pound. I couldn't finish mine, but both of my friends finished theirs (and the one guy in our group actually said he should have gotten the full pound because it was so good!). Between the three of us, we split one of the ice cream sundaes, and it was the perfect sized group for the dessert (there were 3 scoops of ice cream!).

It was a unique idea i.e. pizza pot pie but really just tasted like warm bread with bolognese sauce on it and melted cheese. Nothing special, the two full mushrooms underneath didn't add much flavor-wise either. It tasted bland and uninspired. Then, I went to pay and apparently it's cash only. There are no signs visible on the outside that this is the case (I didn't see one inside either). This would have been nice to know so I could make arrangements during the endless wait. Instead, I found out right as I was going to pay and by then, I was in a rush and found this out. They asked me to use the ATM in the place, which wouldn't take my credit card (even though it's never had any issues at any other place). They told me I'd have to walk down the street and find a bank ATM to pay. I did, and that cost me $3.50 in ATM fees and a whole lot of stress rushing back to the restaurant to try to rush back to my next event. It was an absolutely ridiculous experience. Good food is worth waiting for, but I didn't find it at Oven Grinder. In addition, it's hard to believe that in 2017 patrons are expected to pay cash only. Most people don't carry cash any more. This establishment really made it as inconvenient as possible to eat there. At the very least, have other payment options, and an ATM that actually works. I really didn't appreciate my ATM fees or the hassle. This place needs to at least have clear signage up that says Cash Only. This is the only bad restaurant experience I had in Chicago over the course of a week. I highly recommend Lou Malnati's for a delicious experience and great customer service.

2017-05-21,2.0,"I'm not sure why I don't really get the hype about this place. I get that it's different that typical pizzas, but when you break down the flavors, I just don't see what's so amazing here.  I opted for a sausage and mushroom pot pie, house salad, and their flatbread to start. Their menu is pretty simple which helps narrows down the options quickly. First their salad.. based with quite a bit of iceberg lettuce and fresh veggies, it was definitely a loaded basic salad with no frills. Filling and refreshing.. huge portion for sure. The large and in charge flatbread came our and basically took over the entire table. Although thin in texture, it had a nice pillowy touch to it. Flavor wise though was just some oregano based herbs, parmesan, and olive oil. I was really underwhelmed with the flavors and even used the lemon vinaigrette dressing from the salad to use as a dipping sauce. The pot pie itself tasted exactly what you ordered: a simple marinara, with chunks of sausage and mushrooms, and piles of mozzarella in a bread bowl. I was hoping for the bowl to at least embrace some garlic essence or some kind of flavor, but I was highly disappointed as this was the main attraction. With each bite I took, I kept searching for something to tie all these separate ingredients together... Overall, if you're looking for quantity versus quality, a neat way to fill up your social media with these huge dishes and a pizza in a bowl form, then definitely check this place out.

2017-05-04,3.0,"Finally after multiple attempts of braving hour long lines, opted to come for a 4:30 dinner on a Wednesday to finally try the famous pizza pot pies. I have mixed opinions about service here, which is divided into roughly two different designations, Pre-seating, and Post-seating. Post-seating, the servers tend to be very attentive and knowledgeable, and can navigate a cozy space well in a way that enhances the experience. Pre-seating, you're basically treated like trash. If you come during an off time it's alright, but during busy hours the entrance way gets so cramped you're basically committing 18 different fire code violations. Once you do happen to traverse your way, like a sardine through a gulag to the front, the person taking names just asks you how many are in your party, then gives you an approximation of how long it'll take. This number always seems to be the same...I've been given a 2 hour estimate then come back 2 hours later to still have an hour wait ahead of me. You can tell that this establishment was not built to maintain the capacity that it's newfound popularity has granted it, but this is still not the most efficient system. On to the food, tried out both their renowned pizza pot pie and Mediterranean bread. The pizza pot pie was...good. Novel at least, but I don't think it was that far removed from regular pizza that I would wait any more than 5 minutes for it. A single half-pound pot pie is runs around $12.75, but it's fairly dense so one is usually filling enough for a meal. They use their house tomato sauce(with or without sausage), and you can request wheat or white for the crust, as well as mushroom or no mushroom. When you get mushrooms, they really do just put full mushrooms in there; I wish they cut them as the whole ones are harder to eat and I end up cutting them anyways. I did like the sauce in terms of flavor; it was a bit more runny than I'd have expected but there was plenty of crust to sop it up. As far as the Mediterranean bread, it was good. Basically just a giant super pita, which we split with two people but it seems could be split among 4, as with most of the appetizers/salads here. Meal ended up being about $22pp after tax and tip, which I thought was on the steeper end for pizza.",0.9511,0.849,0.098,0.053,0.5067861962598805

2017-05-02,3.0,"Being a typical tourist and hearing about all the hype, I checked out this spot on a Sunday night. The place was packed! It was close to 8:30pm when I got there and the wait was 45 minutes long which wasn't too bad.  The bad part is that it took a long time to just get the host's attention to ask how long the wait was and to get our names down on the list for a table. Apparently, they don't write names down. The host has good facial recognition and will come get you when a table is available. He did give a good estimate of the wait time. While waiting for a table, we sat by the bar and ordered drinks so it was nice that the bar area wasn't packed. I'm not sure if you can order the food at the bar but that would be a plus if they allow you to do so.  I'm not a fan of pot pies so I opted out of ordering that and instead got the Mediterranean bread and chefs salad. The bread was delicious! The downside was that since it's so large it overflows from the plate and half of it is on the table. That grossed me out having to eat the bread off the table since it's hard to tell how clean the tables are. The chefs salad was good but I wasn't a fan of the creamy garlic and poppy seed dressings. Poppy seed was too sweet and creamy garlic had no flavor to it. It reminded me of plain yogurt more than a dressing.  Besides this, service was great.

2017-04-30,4.0,"CASH ONLY, so come prepared. Fun fact, this building is rumored to be an outlook for Al Capone's gunmen.  The restaurant's signature dish is their pizza pot pie. Came around closing time at 1145pm on a Friday and ordered the half pounder to split for 2 (no wait!). We originally tried to call the order in a few minutes ahead of time so they can prepare the pot pie sooner, but unfortunately, they don't take orders over the phone.  They were able to get the food out quicker (20 minutes versus usual 30 minutes) since it wasn't busy. Very interesting how the waiter serves the dish, as the cheese and toppings are flipped onto the soft dough (you'll see what I mean when you try it). The pizza pot pie came with mushrooms and sausage. The dough was soft and I really liked the cheese. I wasn't a huge fan of the mushroom because it was a large piece that wasn't cut and spread evenly throughout the pizza. It was good, but I wouldn't wait a long time for it. I would recommend sticking with the half pounder per person, at most, since the dough is very filling. Service was excellent and I'm very grateful that they were willing to serve us with the restaurant closing in 15 minutes.  Tip (TMI): don't know if it was the mushroom or another ingredient, but I got really gassy after the meal. Like some of the most rancid smelling gas, so be warned if you bring a first date here (although the ambiance would be perfect for a date with the lighting and service).",0.9513,0.815,0.12,0.066,0.5217049319727891

The person who sat us (who I believe was the owner) was very friendly.  He doesn't take your name, only your party size, and somehow remembers what order everyone arrived in. Our actual server was a little impatient.  I get it, the restaurant is busy, but you still need to answer your tables' questions and be friendly. But once the food arrived, all was forgiven!  When he dropped off my 1/2 size pizza pot pie he was very cooperative with me taking a picture of him scooping it out of the bowl.  I saw several other tables do the same and he was helpful in making sure they got a good picture.  I'm sure he's used to it. I ordered the 1/2 size with meat and mushrooms, although you can get a vegetarian pot pie.  It was to die for!  The cheese was perfectly melted and the sauce was a phenomenal, non-watery consistency.  The sauce to cheese to crust ratio was excellent!  There were 2 full size mushrooms that I cut up to include in several bites as well.  The sauce was very fresh!  It certainly did not need any of the seasonings that they offered but the extra bite of a little crushed red pepper was a nice addition. My sister got the Mediterranean bread.  It's actually an appetizer but she ordered it as her entree.  It is the size of an entire pizza but is essentially just the crust however it is pliable, not stiff.  It comes with a hearty layer of olive oil and seasoning that was to die for!  I believe it had dried onion and tomatoes with several herbs and garlic.  There was a shaker on the table with the same seasoning and it smelled heavenly; I wish they told jars of it! Prices were VERY reasonable!  2 of us ate for $30 with tip.  After posting pictures of my meal on Facebook I will definitely be back with all of my friends who were drooling over my post!",0.9955,0.796,0.162,0.042,0.44807634164777027

2017-04-01,4.0,"As tourists in Chicago, this place was highly recommended by several of our friends back home, so we had to give it a shot. Foremost, let me warn you of the line. The restaurant opens at 4PM, and we arrived about 4:10 after spending the day in Lincoln Park. Ten minutes after opening, and our wait time was set at one hour! So be sure to get there a little before 4 if you don't want to wait that long. It's a small, extremely cozy restaurant, all wooden booth tables (I think only twelve tables) and a dark lighting to give it almost a medieval-like ambiance. The most fascinating part of ""putting your name in"" to wait for a table was that you actually ""put your face in"" - the hostess takes a good look at your face, asks you how many in your party, and just releases you. He remembers the order and party size of every single group! Then when it's your time to eat, he will come searching through the crowd (and literally a crowd of people waiting) to find you! And ours was spot on - one hour on the dot.  Now for the food: while waiting in line, multiple locals told us we had to try the Mediterranean bread and the salad, along with the pizza of course. So we did just that. The Mediterranean bread was literally MASSIVE. Hung well off the edges of a plate, a pita-like bread covered in Parmesan cheese and other seasonings. It was quite tasty! Would definitely get that again. We also got a small salad to share amongst the two of us, which was a typical Italian salad, but the two dressings made it quite lovely! We heard to mix the dressings for the best taste, which was indeed better than either of the two alone. As for the pizza, this thing is really a pizza pot pie. It comes in a dough bowl, with a scoop of marinara sauce and a heaping pile of cheese melted on top. I think it's cooked with a porcelain bowl on top, because when they brought it out, the waitress scraped the dough from the dish, then removed a bowl from the top, then flipped the pizza out! I will have to admit, the ""pizza pot pie"" thing wasn't my favorite type of pizza, though I'm sure others are fanatic about it. The dough was kind of soft (not what I wanted for a pizza crust), and I would've liked a more hearty sauce. I personally prefer classic deep dish better, but the experience of this popular place was worth the try for our first time in Chicago.  Overall, probably wouldn't go back to wait a long time for this place, but definitely a bucket list for Chicago first-timers if you're willing to wait.",0.995,0.847,0.136,0.016,0.45602085278555865

I am never excited on waiting in line for food but despite the wait we all had a great time. We arrived at 11:40, 10 minutes after their official open time of 11:30, on a Saturday for Brunch. Already there was a line, and your entire party does need to be there in order to be seated.  No worries though, we grabbed a seat at the very claustrophia-inducing bar and proceeded to drink. Let me just say after 2 bloody Mary's nothing phases you. All and all, the atmosphere is very casual, fun and once we got seated, our server was super friendly and extremely helpful.  We all had the pizza pot-pie, there were only 3 available options and no substitutions (so be warned) and we got this big doughy bread plate thing that overflowed the sides of the plate and rested on the table (gross). Needless to say, I loved the doughy bread thing and it's salty seasoning. The pizza pot pie looks amazing but really didn't taste all that special. They included whole, un-cut mushrooms that weren't completely cooked the entire way through, which was distracting.

2017-03-12,3.0,"The food was above average, the service at the table good, signature Pizza Pot Pie did not live up to the hype, and the length of time you have to wait it ridiculous.  Only worth going if you arrive 15-20 min before they open, and so you don't wait too long.  I personally do not think it's worth waiting more than 30 min total.  And remember cash only! When you arrive there will be a line outside, it is inevitable.  If you dislike waiting then don't even bother coming.  You check in with the host, there is no list, he remembers your name and face (this is a bit off putting, with less sense of fairness, but it's how things are done).  Typically there is a line to check in, and then another line to get seated.  The restaurant is small, with seating for 50, and the pizza pot pies take a long time to cook so the customer turnover is long.  If you feel strongly about getting the food but do not want to wait, taking out a frozen pizza is an option. The Pizza Pot Pie itself, the signature item (sorry grinder sandwiches), and the reason that everyone comes here.  Like Chicago Deep Dish, this item is closer to a casserole than a thin pizza.  The crust comes in white or wheat options, the sauce inside is meat or not, and large barely cut up mushrooms are standard (unless you ask for without mushrooms).  As a pizza fanatic and a love of Chicago Deep Dish, the pot pie had only 3 things going for it.  First, the sauce possessed a deep flavor, italian seasonings and chunks of tomatoes.  Second, lots of gooey melted cheese.  Third, the novelty, not other place serves something like this.  But I cannot honestly say I'd wait more than 30 min for one, did not blow me away in any spectacular fashion.  Rather, the Mediterranean Flatbread and Tortoni stole the show.  The flatbread is too large for a plate, lots of seasoning, and pairs very well with the salad dressings.  Get this, especially as an appetizer to hold you over to the pizza pot pie.  The Tortoni is a desert, with flavors like Rum Raisin ice cream, but is more creamy, more robust flavor, which is really cinched by the graham cracker dusting on top.",0.9725,0.886,0.084,0.029,0.473785228377065

The 'pizza' bread is exceptionally bland almost to a point of flavorless.  Furthermore, the options were extremely limited meat sauce, vegetarian sauce, or mushrooms. That's it, no create your own and not even a spicy or plain option.  We got the Mediterranean bread which had some very good seasoning but should have come with some olive oil or even marinara it is bread that gets very dry! On a positive note, the pork sauce was very good!  Overall, if your looking for a pizza experience this is not the place; stick with Pizzano's or Malnati's.",0.9283,0.842,0.133,0.025,0.6006978879706154

More often than not, we walk away disappointed. This is one of those times.  Upon hearing of a pizza pot pie, my interest was immediately piqued. I love pizza; I love pot pie. I was warned the wait would be horrendous. It was. No computers, no sign up sheet. The wait-list existed only in the host's head. I was skeptical of his so-called prowess of memorizing everyone's faces and the order in which they appeared. He proved me wrong and I was thoroughly impressed. We waited about 2hrs. Menu consisted of few options. We ordered the most popular dishes: Mediterranean bread and two pot pies. Mediterranean bread was huge! It overflowed the plate and much of the seasoned flatbread rested on the table. I do not enjoy eating food off of tables for hygienic reasons. My friend loved the bread and I admit it was good, but not great.  The pot pies, however, were quite disappointing. I expected a flaky pot pie crust. Instead, I got a hardened shell, more similar to ones you find frozen. Inside the bowl was a soup of flavorless marinara sauce and three mushrooms, topped with a heart attack's worth of cheese. I tried to eat as much as I could because I had 1. waited so long and 2. paid for this meal. I swear, I had to stop eating because I could actually feel my lungs clogging up with the cheese. No part of the ""pot pie"" was enjoyable. Legit you are eating a bowl of cheese sitting on top of marinara sauce. No way reminiscent of pizza nor pot pie.

Very impressive! It's not very strong in any way but it's just this fine combination of flavors with freshness. Half pound works great for me!  A tip for all new visitors - make sure you arrive the restaurant earlier before it opens because they open earlier than 4pm especially when the crowd is there. Today, all tables are full at 4pm. The food is very good so walking away with hours of wait will make you disappointed.  This place gives you this antique feeling because it's wooden interior design. I personally like it a lot because just like their good, not overly decorative but still give you nice dining experience. Our waiter was very nice. I'd say though, you might be upset if you are soda lovers because you can refill your drink for free. Also, their excellent Mediterranean bread though, is too big and touch the table. The staff was very good at cleaning the mess; however I would prefer a bigger plate. It's definitely worth to try and I'll bring my friends who love pizza back here again!!",0.9966,0.698,0.259,0.043,0.5727712677712681
2017-01-27,4.0,"We ate here on a Friday, and got to the restaurant at 3:20pm due to the waiting horror stories that are abundant in these reviews. Luckily, we were the second group to arrive inside and they seated us a few minutes later. I would definitely recommend to get there before they open because by 4:30 the line waiting for tables was already pretty deep. The wait staff were pretty excellent in terms of refilling water, cleaning the table and removing plates without being intrusive.  Someone always seemed to be within earshot if you needed something, so I had no complaints. We ordered the Mediterranean bread because we were starving and knew the pizza takes awhile to cook. The bread came out pretty quickly and definitely surprised us with its flavor. I'd recommend eating it right when they bring it, because as it sits on the table it loses some of it's appeal when cold. For the pizza pot pies, they were surprisingly good and I went in with high expectations. The crust, sauce and cheese all work well together. I'd recommend against the mushrooms because I don't feel like they add much and seem to be just thrown in, rather than elevating the rest of the pie. As a big eater who has been known to polish off a whole pizza before, the one pounder is definitely enough to get you full. The only reason for the four stars is because of the complaints others have said before. A soda is $1.75, but the refill isn't free which I haven't experienced in years. On top of that, the soda tastes kind of flat, or off for some reason, so I'd avoid it all together. Cash only is another complaint because I'm not sure how many people carry cash with them these days, but if you're reading Yelp reviews, you should be prepared. Overall, a great experience and I'd like to go back one day. Just be prepared to get there early or your experience might be more about the wait than the food.",0.8344,0.815,0.11,0.075,0.5486984126984127

We tried to come here on a Saturday night and the wait was 3 hours so we decided to come back right when they opened at 11:30am on Sunday. We were able to get in right away and ordered the traditional pizza. When you order the pizza the only options are if you want white or wheat crust, meat sauce or vegetarian sauce, and with or without mushrooms.  When they bring the pizza out they flip the bowl over and the toppings in the bowl slide into the bread bowl that was cooked over the top of the bowl. While I am a ""cheese-lover"", the pizza made me feel like I was just eating melted cheese and all of the different parts of the pizza kept separating so it was hard to get a bite that had a combination of the crust, the sauce, and the cheese.

We were told it would be 2 and a half hours wait so we went for a walk and came back after about an hour and 45 to check back. He told us it would be another 45 minutes. No problem we thought,  so we waited outside and chilled out. 45 minutes go by and and we go inside to check again, he told us an hour and 45 again. We still waited, checked back a few times periodically until he finally told us 15 minutes. We waited in front of the line and when 15 minutes was up he walked right by us and seated someone else who had just arrived. If you have a high tolerance for bullshit, then go ahead, have fun!

Both times we were passed by several of the staff and never once greeted.  Today, I finally flagged down what looked like a manager.

We didn't really know where to go to ask for a table, but after a bit of wading around in the crowd, we found the host and asked for a table for 2; it would be a 2 hour wait time. Luckily, the zoo is right by the restaurant, so we went to the zoo during our wait time. Two hours passed painlessly, and we walked back to the restaurant and waited a few more minutes in the entrance space. The host came by and took us to our table. (Yes, he remembered us!) The inside of the restaurant is crowded, but the way it's set up still makes for a perfectly intimate and cozy dinner. We ordered straight away, the Mediterranean bread and 1/2 lb traditional pot pie pizza. The bread came to the table within 10 minutes. The spices, the texture--all SO good. We did not finish it all to save room for the pizza. Thirty-five minutes later, the main dish came out. Armed with my Lactaid tablets, I dug into the heap of mozzarella cheese. Again, all SO good. The sauce, the cheese, the whole mushrooms, the crust were all so perfectly cooked and gave each bite a harmoniously balanced taste. A 1/2 lb pot pie was about $13, while a 1 lb was about $22. Not expensive at all, considering the amount and quality of the food. Aside from the fantastic food, the service was great. Our glasses were always full, and we were never waiting around for anything (other than to be seated, of course), and I in no way felt rushed. So yes, this place lives up to the hype. I didn't think I would want to go again, but the experience quickly made me change my mind. I will definitely be back soon.",0.9951,0.831,0.144,0.025,0.5270238095238095

It seems like a ""drop in and hangout"" type of place, but of course the typically hour-long wait throws a wrench in that. Regardless, I enjoyed it as a group dinner venue. - Food - Mediterranean bread: nothing mind blowing. It's basically naan/flatbread covered in feta and ""Italian herbs and spices"". Make sure to eat this immediately because, though it is soft when it's warm, it instantly becomes crunchy and not as good when it cools. Half pounder pizza pot pie with meat, no mushrooms, and white top: This is the embodiment of the term hearty. I got the half pounder to myself but I would recommend sharing it. The concept is very cool and the execution wasn't far off from my expectations. The meat sauce was pretty on point and the real star of the meal. If you're hungry this is what makes this meal exactly what you need.  -Service- Nothing appreciably good or bad to speak of. The one thing I will say is that they are on it with refilling the lemon water. Overall, pretty happy with my experience here, despite the hour wait.

2016-12-06,4.0,"After seeing all the hype about the infamous ""Pot Pie Pizza"", we decided to make this a planned Friday early dinner stop to fill our bellies before seeing a show in Chicago.  We checked the website and checked Yelp in order to time our arrival for 20 minutes before they were slated to open as we had heard horror stories about the wait times to get in.  Surprise, surprise -- we found they were already open (at 340pm instead of 4pm), they were already completely full, and there was a 45 min to an hour wait when we walked in!  WOW! We opted to sit at the bar and wait considering we were THE ONLY ones in the waiting area at that time.  The host did not take our name, and please note that there is no formal wait list -- you just have to take a seat and wait.  Other reviewers say that the host has a photographic memory to remember where everyone falls in the ever-growing line...I just think you have to make yourself known to him.  About 15 minutes after we sat at the bar to wait, the place was absolutely jam PACKED -- people all in the bar, in the small waiting area, and outside in the cold.  I sent the hubs up about 30 min in to our wait to just have some face time and the host then told him it would be an hour and 15 minutes.  He politely reminded the host that we had been waiting, were the first ones in the bar, and after I waved at the host he recognized me and stated we would be the next ones to be sat.  As our luck would have it, a 2 top opened in my line of sight (hard to see in here because it is small and narrow) and we were led to it!  WOOT!  We ended up waiting about 35 minutes when it was all said and done. Our server was hurried but very polite.  He explained the menu and the wait times for the pot pie pizzas (30-40 min) and suggested the mediterranean bread to hold us over.  We got it per his suggestion (half plain due to hubby's dairy allergy) and our server later brought out olive oil to dip and spices for the hubs as he could not have the 'good stuff' on my half.  Very thoughtful.  The Mediterranean Bread was delightful -- and plenty to share with a table for sure. Then came our Pot Pie Pizzas.  We opted for the half pounders each as the hubs had to get his sans cheese.  We were only given the option of vegetarian or meat sauce -- both came with mushrooms -- and our choice of white or wheat crust.  We opted for meat and the white crust.  The hub's cheese free version looked like chili in a bread bowl once dumped out, but he said it was tasty.  Mine was an oozy, hot, cheesy mess with a few whole button mushrooms thrown in that was definitely worth the experience, but nothing I feel I need to return for.   Remember this place is CASH ONLY -- but it is reasonable.  The pizza pot pies were $12.75 and the Mediterranean Bread was just under $9.  Beers (tall Stellas) were $7.50 each.  All in all, Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder Company is a cool spot with lots of history that we are glad we had the chance to experience -- but we don't need to hurry back.  Should we find ourselves here again, we have heard the 'regular' pizza and grinders are amazing.  Maybe next time.",0.9905,0.888,0.088,0.024,0.4909139324032941

Pack a snack and extra patience because as mention before there is AT LEAST a two hour wait. TIP: Once the host recognize your face, go over to RJ Grunts bar (it's just two blocks away) for a drink or appetizer. Then go back a little before your 2 hours are up.  Impressive: Host and Service What impressed me the most was the host. He's a older gentleman. He has this superpower that allows him look at you and take a mental picture without needing your name. I left the restaurant and came back to check on the status. He remembered my face and the exact time that I came in! He's good! He's been doing this for 20 something years.  Our server was great! He knew we were hungry and ordered something quickly. He gave us a brief history of the spot.  This place is basically a small house. That can fit a max of 40 (I'm a planner so I eye-balled it) but it's tight! The lobby is crowded with people and some wait outside.  Not impress: Food  It's not a pot pie, not a deep pizza, it's their own style of pizza. They have been making this since the 70s. Imagine a personal sized pizza stuffed with meaty tomato sauce and huge mushrooms but looks like a oversized mushroom! Lol  What I liked most was the Wisconsin cheese. Quite frankly that's all I ate.

So it is the day after thanksgiving and I assume that people are stuffed with turkey so less likely they will wake up to eat the stuffed pot pie pizza. I was wrong, so is the popularity of this place. May be this was a locally famous spot then one day it gets featured in food network and boom it is FAMOUS.  So I see a tiny crowd of people outside of 2121 north Clarke street. Then I realize that it is  kind of a ""waiting area"". Like a boss I walk in and ask table for two please, and the short guy looks up at me with a ""u no special"" expression and tells me to wait outside,hang out in the 'glass area' and will call us in after 1 hour 20 mins. Yes people you all heard it right . The wait is minimum of 1 hour +. So is it all worth  the wait? Yes it is worth the wait. And just so you know if you wanna get checked in sooner then make sure to stand in visible zone near the ATM cause I feel they somewhat randomly seat people. The occupancy says 103 in that room and I am unsure if there were more people than that in there. I think this is definitely a unique looking, tavern kind of a place. The seat, tables the ceiling and the ambience is all medieval in modern times. The cleanliness here is 3/5. I wish it was a little less noisy though. They have a bar too where people get drinks while they are "" WAIIIIIIIITTTTIIINNNNGGG"" for their turn to be seated. If I want to own a restaurant then may be I will have it done / decorated like this. We ordered the same old Mediterranean bread and the half pound veggie and meat pot pies. Kevin was the serving that day and he was good. The Mediterranean bread was very tasty with all the seasonings and herbs on it but guys please make a small sized bread too because I don't want to get stuffed with the bread and not enjoy my main course, no offense, your bread is tasty. Now the pot pie. Mmmmm this s an interesting dish and never seen a bowl shaped pizza, so should someone redefine pizza, I don't care. The pie is stuffed with cheese and had mushrooms in it. It was very heavy and tasted good. But I think more veggies and slightly less cheese is what I would go with. Anyway they kind of hurry you to finish asap because ""Hello, there is a huge crowd waiting outside to be seated"". Any how. Good place, decent food ( did feel guilty) but have to work on a better waiting list strategy.

What I will say is all of the above are true.  Is it a place to go for a unique experience?  Yes.  That being stated, the below items will set you up for success in enjoying this place: - Bring plenty of cash (especially if you are a drinker).  A meal for 4 with 2 appetizers, 4 drinks, and 4 small potpies costs around $125 in CASH.  So, if the long wait for a table gets your thirsty; keep 20-30 dollars extra on the side for that.   -Brush your teeth and for heaven's sake wear some deodorant.  It is a close quarters waiting environment.  Plus there are about a million tables stuffed into a 10 square foot area.  It is normal to be rubbing up against people waiting while you try not to fall over a couple eating at a table.   -Come around the opening at 4pm.  It will save a 2 hour wait around 5-6 pm.   - Bring 20 dollars for parking or even better take Uber or other taxi service.  Whats the worst thing about not knowing how long it will take for a meal?  Worrying about getting your car ticketed.   Enjoy the experience and read a bunch of these Yelp reviews.  They sum up the time spent here and will I go here again?  Probably once or twice more.  To enjoy the place with some friends.",0.9648,0.861,0.107,0.032,0.5016369047619048
2016-11-19,4.0,"It's the ""pizza pot pie"" place; it's  world famous now; and the meal has recently gone viral on Facebook. If you go there in one of the largest cities in America, within an easy drive of heavily populated areas in Milwaukee and Northwest Indiana, and are not expecting some sort of wait, I long for the charmed life you lead. That said, the whole ""wait"" system there is absurd and inefficient, but also appears to be part of the folklore of this place.   Meaning, they have so many people there coming in so quickly that everyone will be waiting a long time regardless of what system they had. Knowing being quick is not an option, they passed on trying to be efficient with buzzers, or even something as ""high tech"" as asking for your first or last name, in lieu of this ""magic host"" with a photographic memory far superior to anyone on this planet.  According to legend, he remembers every group by face and party size, even if he doesn't really look at you or your party during his mad scramble to find the next in line to be seated.  Long story short, the wait (when busy) is a flat two hours, and that really means it's somewhere between 1 and 5 hours and it really depends on how comfortable you appear to be waiting for an endless amount of hours, and how close you appear to be throwing in the towel and jumping ship. Food: I had the pizza pot pie. It's worth the hype and it is truly delicious. A half pound is what they recommend for individual servings, and they're dead on about that. The full pound seems doable, but keep in mind a majority of that pound is made up of a flaky, flavorful bread and really, really smooth, perfectly tasting cheese that reminds you of some perfect, cheese pizza where the mozzarella stretches off a slice when you pull it from the box. If you're looking for what to expect, don't go looking for a traditional pizza taste. That's not a slight, but just an observation. The cheese and the flaky, white crust are pizza-esque, however the sauce is much more what you would expect to taste in a meat/spaghetti sauce than on a pizza. It's still VERY good, but that's just a quick fyi. Other than that, just keep in mind that this place is a very small, old school establishment that became very, very popular. Meaning, booths are small, lighting is dim, dining room is small and crowded, and there is no real waiting room. The place just wasn't built for lingering or anything other than getting a darn good meal for a very good price. Taste: There's a reason it's become famous, the pizza pot pie is that good. Price: Very reasonable for the area and what you get. Overall: I recommend it with the caveat that you understand you are going to wait, it's going to be crowded and packed, and that you're there for the food.

2016-11-12,3.0,"Whoever came up with the concept of the pizza pot pie, as the Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder Company is primarily known for, is a pure genius.  Just look at all the people, myself included, that are lined up every single night.  Though I knew that this place gets busy, I never realized that it was on the same level of 'busy' as Au Cheval - the popular burger joint across the city.  I never would have imagined myself waiting for two hours just for some pizza that would take 30 minutes to make and 3 minutes to consume.  Yet, I did...and so did thousands of other people.  And that is why this place is a frickin' gold mine, especially since it is a cash-only joint.  In case you forget to pack the Benjamin's, there is an ATM conveniently located in the foyer of this restaurant.   Now, if we're talking about the food then obviously this would be a five-star review - let me just be clear on that point.  Despite the long wait, getting to experience the infamous pizza pot pie is something you can mark off the bucket list...aka the Yelp bookmark list.  The pizza pot pie - which you should get with mushrooms and sausage - is a creation that just works.  The sauce, the buttery crust and the oozing toppings make it better than the deep dish pizza that all of us Chicagoans love so much.  I can't exactly put my finger on what makes this pizza so damn good, but it is and that's all you need to know.  As much as I loved the pizza pot pie, my favorite part of the meal was the Mediterranean bread.  It can be made with white or wheat bread, but choose the former.  The bread is HUGE, and the best advice I can give is to save 3/4 of it so that you actually have room for your pizza pot pie.  Believe me, the Mediterranean bread is equally as delicious when eaten for leftovers. The service that we received once seated was also something I'd rate with five stars.  I was truly impressed by the calm tempers of all the wait staff despite the fact that it was completely packed inside and outside the restaurant.  I'd have been running around like a chicken with my head cut off had I been in their shoes, but like I said - these waiters unbelievably calm, and jovial at that.  How I envy them and their ability to keep their nerves in tact... Anyway, the reason that I can only give The Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder Company three stars is for the fact that it's a long-ass line to get in.  I don't care if a restaurant has a perfect Michelin-rating, I don't want to be waiting two hours for food.  The real odd part is the fact that there is absolutely not check-in sheet to track where you are amongst the other guests in terms of being seated.  I was told that the host/gentleman who runs the front simply remembers every single guest that comes in and the order in which they arrived...and that's how people are seated.  Are you kidding me?  I will admit that he actually did a pretty good job at this, but he has got to have some trick up his sleeve as this just seems improbable.  I can't help but feel that so many mistakes have been when seating parties because of this process...from a layman's perspective, it's very disorganized. So here's the deal, recapped: 1. This is a cash-only joint so don't come waltzing in waving credit cards 2. The pizza pot pie and Mediterranean bread are all that truly matters 3. You should expect to wait about 2 hours on a weeknight, longer on the weekend 4. There is barely any parking, so take the train for pay for the valet at the restaurant 5. You can grab a beer from their bar and drink it while you wait to be seated 6. Once you're inside, the restaurant is super cozy, especially because of it's encompassing wooden booths and flowers that are placed at every single table.  It's kind of adorable",0.9974,0.817,0.138,0.045,0.5423076923076925

He said to hang around and wait and he will remember your face. Like what?? Anyways we didn't want to wait around for 2+ hours (if that - what is the guarantee he would remember to seat us?) so I called in a takeout order - 1 pounder with meatballs and mushrooms. It was ready promptly in 30 minutes, I paid cash and was out the door. Thank goodness! The pizza came wrapped in a neat plastic container with utensils (they don't give plates). It was hot, cheesy, VERY tomato saucy but overall pretty good. For 4 people, the 1 pounder wasn't enough to completely stuff us but definitely kept us full until an early dinner. The buttery crust, little pieces of meatball and soft mushrooms made for satisfying bites. However, SO glad we didn't wait around to be seated.

Seriously, wtf is a pizza pot pie?  This place has apparently been managed for 28 years by an unrepentant assclown who claims to remember faces and refuses to write down people's names. Can it be a coincidence people are waiting close to two hours for a table and then maybe get one?  And let's talk about those tables. This place is tiny. If it strikes you as ironic that a restaurant that sells a full pound of glorified hot pocket for one person to eat is luxuriously appointed with tiny booths that no one can fit in, you're not alone. Our waitress did her best at first, but had little patience for my bizarre requests like having pepperoni actually on this ludicrous pizza-esque food. They brought me three salami-sized pieces of pepperoni on a big piece of lettuce.  I can't believe they allow this place in Chicago. I'm told there isn't yet a Chicago Pizza Review Board that can stop this madness, but there should be. If your sign says Chicago Pizza, you should maybe serve that, instead of this pizza pot pie concoction.   To add insult to injury, they only take cash, and there are no free refills on fountain drinks. I was surprised they didn't charge you to use the bathroom.  Seriously. I cannot believe there are people who like this place.

2016-10-26,5.0,"Holy god! We got there and found out there was a 1.5 hour wait. After going back forth with the idea of staying and juggling a few other locations we decided that since we were visiting it was worth the effort. They didn't take our name down, apparently they will remember you by face. That's cool. After going across the street to get a few drinks and pass the time we came back and were ushered to the bar while they prepared our table. The waitress was friendly and seated us. I didn't even need to look at the menu. 1/2 pounder meat pie. Do it. Thank me later. The 3 others in my party ordered 2 veggie half pounders to split and we got a salad for the table. The salad, while nothing home to write about was hearty and healthy. Enough eclectic veggies and not just lettuce. But the real stars were the two dressings. A creamy ranch and an unbelievably delicious vinagrette. I really don't care about salads but these two sauces made it just out of this world. I highly recommend sharing a salad and mixing the dressings: it was brilliant. Finally, the showstopper. 3 mushroom looking doughballs came out the oven and placed in front of us. The waitress used a spoon to scoop out the bowl and flip over the masterpiece. It was love at first site. The bread was baked perfectly. The cheese was rampant and oozing with glory. I'm salivating just thinking about it. I put some parmesean cheese and the house italian seasoning but you really don't need it. It just made it that much more amazing. I am going to spare the details of my eating experience as I'm sure the graphic scenes of pleasure and satisfaction would quite certainly make this review NSFW. But, once I finished with the first one I was hungry for more. Mind you, it was very very filling. The others barely finished 2 split amongst the three of them but I was craving another bite. I haver never done this before. But the pizza pot pie was just unbelievably good and my favorite thing I ate in my visit to Chicago (including Gino's deep dish.)

It was only a table for two for us and it still took us at least an hour.  Restaurant is small! so expect to shimmy against each other if your near the bar.   Multiple stars.. Person working the front: 1 star Our waitress: 4 stars Food: 4 stars Here's why. Person working the front (the shorter of the two) seating people is equivalent and reminds me of the soup nazi in Sinefeld.  You would think host/hostess are nice, personable and inviting... this guy has some issues.  There is no wait list to put your name on, he says its in his head... um okay. Sure.. At first we were giving the guy credit. Then he seated the guys behind us who came in 10 minutes after we did. How did we know that, its because we were talking to the guys when they walked in. So my husband went to tell host with the baditude that, and he was flat out rude! he starts telling my husband with an attitude... I told you it will be an hour and a half wait. My husband says the guys were after us, and he was wrong.  He says he's never wrong.  The people next to us who were Chicago locals overheard... and later asked us if we were on the list.... they were joking of course, cause theres no list.  Its all filed away in metal cabinets in his head. These Chicago locals specifically told us that they try not to go there because of this. So beware of the grumpy dude. Our waitress, she was bubbly, quick and nice. I liked her!! She delivered our salads rather quickly.  Our waiter always consistently refilled our waters, took away our plates and items quickly.  Our food.. well now here it is. I was really excited to try this place. I saw the review to this place, even saw the video and I was intrigued! Pizza that looks like a humongous muffin, flip it and it becomes a pizza. Its like a dam transformer.  We choose the 1-pounder, Pizza Pot Pie with Mushrooms with wheat crust. about 20-minutes later.. viola the dam muffin looking thing is in front of you. ready to be flipped. Our waitress flipped and knifed the dish until it flops on to the plate.  First taste, the melted cheese is fabulous. Watch the video.. its not just mozzarella. its a combo of cheeses that make this dish so fabulous. You like cheese,come and get some! The meat sauce too was very tasty.  I've had meat sauces in different restaurant and I always feel like its 20% meat, and 80% running tomato water. This sauce was meaty and flavorful. perfect.. just perfect. Just to mention, the wheat crust was different, it actually felt grainy so perhaps oder it with the white.",0.9813,0.867,0.098,0.036,0.5175417175417177

2016-10-22,4.0,My first time here was definitely an experience! First of all let me just start of by tell you the way you get a table is very chaotic. There was a long line out the door halfway down the block and after waiting in this line for about 15-20 min we make our way in to the building only to find out this line was to just put our name on the list. BUT the catch is they don't take your name or give you a number or give you any type of pager. The guy simply says it would be 1 1/2 hour wait and I'll come find you. This boggled my mind. How is this one guy going to remember the order of who goes next and come and find you. With all that being said we waited 1 hour and 45 min and then after asking him how much longer he said 30 more min which only ended up being about 15min so a total of 2 hours just to Be seated. With ALL that said just go prepared to wait 2 hours and not try to understand their system of seating people because it will NEVER make sense.  Now on to the food! With all that waiting was it worth it? The pizza pot pie was very unique and quite delicious.  Not sure if it was worth a 3 hour wait which is how long we waited all together from the time we got there and actually received our food. I think it's worth about 1 1/2 hour wait. They have some amazing garlic herb flatbread that was amazing and we highly recommend it as an appetizer.  I would go back but choose a time that wasn't so busy where we didn't have to wait as long. If you do go during a busy time just be  prepared to wait.

2016-10-18,2.0,"I decided to patronize this place after seeing it on the Food Network's Facebook page. I was very excited to try the famous pizza pot pie. It was my first time ever visiting Chicago. We arrived there at about 4pm on a Saturday afternoon. The location is in a cramped residential neighborhood. There is no parking. Valet was $10 and that's only if you're there under 2 hours. There were about 25-30 people milling around outside. Upon walking in, another 15 or so right inside the door. I squeezed my way through the crowd to the front to try to put my name on the list only to find out there was no list. Apparently, the host just ""remembers your face"" which is weird since there were so many people there. Most said they had been waiting about 2 and a half hours. My boyfriend and I decided we'd just order to go especially upon seeing the extremely small booths. My boyfriend's a pretty big guy. But, even the most average sized person would probably have trouble. I was directed to a bar area to look at a menu and select my items. We ordered two of the half pounder pot pies and the great American salad. The host insisted I add the Mediterranean bread because ""everybody loves it"".  So, I did.

The pies were perfectly made and seasoned--the crust was chewy, but crisp. The sauce was flavorful, hearty, and perfectly balanced. The ingredients are quality, and it is something that you definitely can taste! The mushrooms were DELICIOUS, and so fresh. Their fresh, homemade Italian seasoning is TO DIE FOR.

2016-10-03,5.0,"After so many years of hearing about this place and seeing it featured online I had to come check it out. The place is tucked away. If it weren't for the old timey signs sticking out you could walk right by it. It is a very narrow restaurant with a low ceiling (at least for me). It's just barely big enough to handle the kind of foot traffic it sees. When I arrived with friends we were greeted by valet. Which I highly recommend you do! They will park your car for $10. When we got inside we were told to wait by the bar for 45 minutes. We expected an hour wait no matter what...and you should too!  But by some great blessing we were seated within about 25 minutes...maybe less. We were blown away! We took a booth and sat down. Great selection of beers. For an appetizer we did the Mediterranean bread. It was a HUGE flatbread covered in spices such as basil, rhyme and parmesan.  It was delicious and surprisingly filling!  I also recommend you ask for some oil to dip it in. So good! We ordered the pizza pot pies. I mean why else would you come here? For first time visits just get the pies! They come in half pound and one pound. I was hungry so I did the one pounder.  You get a choice of meat or vegetarian sauce and if you want mushrooms. Otherwise it's the same cheese. The crust I think could be wheat.  The pot pies are so unique in presentation - and they tasted great! They are simple...but effective.  We ended our meal by trying the Tortoni which was rum flavored vanilla ice cream covered with almonds and macaroons. Very yummy and a great way to end a meal here. Yes this place is kinda expensive to visit, but it's worth it. That being said it isn't TOO expensive being Chicago. The staff were also surprisingly quick and attentive given how busy it was. In short, this may not be the best pizza place in Chicago. But it IS one of the most unique pizza experiences I've ever had. Check it out. You won't be disappointed.

2016-10-03,3.0,"My first visit here was a series of lessons on how to obtain a successful meal here next time. First of all, expect to wait for around 2 hours on a Saturday night. The line snakes throughout the restaurant and spills out into the streets with people milling about with drinks as they wait. I don't know how they kept all the people waiting straight, as there was no numbers given or names taken by the host. It was chaotic and cramped inside the small space. So the strategy is to show your face, grab a drink, wait in the open air with the rest of the herd and have faith they will remember you when a table is ready.  My second lesson is that take out is not as good as eating in. Seeing the wait, we opted for take out which takes about 20 minutes and elbowing your way back and forth through the crowd. The pizza crust was buttery and light, the sauce tangy with large pieces of mushroom and a thick layer of cheese to seal everything in. Unfortunately, the deliciousness doesn't translate through when cold. The cheese congeals into a rubbery slab that refuses to integrate with anything else.

Of course we spoke with the manager before leaving and I'm glad we did because he had some words of wisdom, ""Not my problem"". The manager was so unprofessional throughout the couple times we spoke with him it made me sick to think he makes more money then the hardworking bartenders and servers.

The pot pie is not as filling as you think unless you love bread but the sauce is basically marinara tossed with some ground meat... basically spaghetti sauce a few mushrooms and baked cheese.... not worth it in my book in a city full of fantastic pizza options. The mediterranean bread is pretty good and you can choose between whole grain or white... hence the 2 stars. I highly doubt i'll ever come back.

The ""pizza"" was really good, but I was still hungry after putting the whole thing down. The cheese was gooey, the mushrooms were full button mushrooms and were good if you like mushrooms.

There is something amazingly charming and humbling about this restaurant. I feel like this place has remained constant through the ever changing ways of society and I find that incredibly authentic.   I recommend coming earlier or on an off dinner or lunch time. Be prepared to wait. You can wait up to two hours for a table, this restaurant is pretty small. The maitre d is one of the most interesting people I've ever encountered. When you arrive, let him that you want a table and the amount of people you are dining with. That's it. No name, no number. He'll remember you. Trust him. Trust the system. The pizza is worth the wait. But grab a snack before you come and grab a drink at the bar while you are there.  The pizza. Oh the pizza. I've never had a pizza pot pie before I tried Chicago Pizza Company, but I think this my favorite way to eat it aside from thin crust. Sorry deep dish, but you're not as wonderful as people describe. It's cooked upside down, as in they put cheese then sauce then dough atop little ramekins. The waiter or waitress brings the little concoctions to your table then flips them right side up onto your dish. Pretty cool.  I recommend a half pound per person. You will get full. They have a meat and veggie option which you can then add full-size button mushrooms to your pie. If you like the shrooms, add them it's so good. For an appetizer, the Mediterranean bread is awesome. It's so large it overflows the plate.

There are pros and cons to this restaurant, but I assure you all of the cons are worth the pros.  Cons: The first time I came here was on a Monday night and I waited 55 minutes just to get in the door. The second time was on a Friday and I waited an hour and a half. Both times me and the rest of my party felt that the food was 100% worth the wait.  Also, the host doesn't take names and there doesn't seem to be any specific line, but he is surprisingly good at remembering everyone in the order in which they came. Other than that, there are no free refills and you can only pay cash. Although, there is an ATM in the building you can pull money from in order to pay.  Pros:  But besides all of the cons I've listed already, the food and the wait staff is amazing.  Both of the servers I had were very helpful in explaining the menu and best way to get the most bang for your buck. A man who I assume is the manager checked on us both times I was there. He seems a little odd, so it may throw you off but it is nice to be checked on.  The pizza pot pies are where its at though. Phenomenal! I am not one who usually enjoys peppers or sausage, but in this dish they are TO DIE FOR!! All in all I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at this restaurant and HIGHLY recommend people to go there.

Seating is right and 90% booth seating with exception of two round tables in the front.  Trust me, just sit where they seat you otherwise you'd be in for a longer wait.   There is a functional bar area as well.  (Not sure if people at the bar were eating or if they were just taking up space, waiting for another booth to get open.) So menu is fairly simple, everyone comes here for the pot pie pizza which is totally unique.  Definitely get the quick Mediterranean bread, which is a huge parmesan, parsley and garlic pizza. (It was tasty, but I wonder if).  It's larger than the plate it's served on, therefore we had to flip it on itself to avoid sitting on the table.  Pot pie pizza: Think of it as a pasta meat sauce (we had the sausage and mushroom) and a hand full of white mushrooms  under a layer of melted white melting Cheese (it's not mozzarella).    I loved the Mediterranean bread.  I could be satisfied just eating that.  The pot pie was tasty good, but I prefer to have everything piping hot.   It was only warm which is very odd to me.   I mean, for faster prep, I figured they would use meat sauce that was simmering...but apparently the sauce is ladled on cold, then Cheese then baked.   Disappointing that it was not served hotter.   By 7pm on a Friday night, the tables turned about three times.  The booths next to us were all two tops and they ordered way too much food.  The antipasti salad (who eats salad at this place really?). It's what tourists would call Chicago sized.  Fit to fully feed two people.   If you get a salad, don't bother ordering the bread or your own personal pot pie.    This is my second visit to oven grinder.  Both times not too impressed.  Perhaps it's because I'm not a fan of hype built up thru waiting. And it just does not stand out to me as must have for my taste buds.    It's a popular spot (and its been popular for years!) and worth taking your out of town guests.   (Just make sure that your guests hold the spot in line while you take your time getting there.    Happy eating folks!",0.9884,0.849,0.113,0.038,0.5839285714285714

When I took my first bite, I was in complete disbelief. No pizza has ever tasted this good. With each bite, I contemplated the meaning of life. I honestly thought that my taste buds for pizza has reached its peaked many years ago. Boy, I have never been so wrong in my life. If you ever go to Chicago you must go here. If you don't, you honestly don't even deserve to eat here. If you do go and don't like this place, you should seriously reevaluate your entire life.",0.6882,0.825,0.104,0.071,0.6472222222222223

How do I know you're not putting people ahead of me?

2016-08-06,4.0,"Absolutely delicious pizza and worth the wait to try at least once. I came on a Thursday night around 6:30 with a party of four and we waited about an hour and a half. The ""check in"" system is a bit odd because you don't put a name down or anything, the guy just says he will remember you. Hm. We were concerned at first but in the end had no problems being remembered and being seating. The only thing we ordered were the pizza pot pies. They take about half an hour, but again, worth the wait. A half-pound pizza pot pie is enough for one hungry person. I ate just about all of mine. It was so, so good. The sauce is more of a bolognese than a pizza sauce, but I think that's what makes it so good. It's a delicious meat sauce and just goes wonderfully with the button mushrooms, tons of melted brick cheese, and chewy crust. I would definitely eat here over many Chicago deep dish pizza places but make sure you understand that it's not really pizza and will not have the same taste. In addition, our server was incredibly friendly and the atmosphere is very cool--kind of an old world pub feel.

We had the Mediterranean flat bread for appetizer.  It was soft, light, and garlicky tasty.  My friend thought it was salty but she doesn't use salt in cooking or eating.  We had the pizza pot pie with sausages and mushrooms.  The sauce was flavorful.  It's more a casserole that a pizza.  Overall it was delicious, comfy, and cheesy.  For dessert we had the amaretto gelato.  So yummy and hit the sweet spot.

However 3 stars because of the ridiculous reservation system, I understand that having someone remember your face is quite a cute USP. In reality it causes nothing but chaos and an unpleasant experience with everyone cramming into the small entrance way scared that if they go anywhere they'll miss their place in line. This makes it's a nightmare to squeeze through to get to the front to 'put your face in'. Add on to this an estimated wait time of 1:45 mins and the system really means you can't leave and come back. Allowing people to actually put their name down and giving them a time to come back to eat would let you spend the long waiting time doing something else, rather than sitting outside hoping the guy remembers who you are and what order you came in.

2016-07-31,5.0,"If you're looking for ""classic"" pizza, this may not be your place. However, if you're looking for an innovative twist on pizza with fresh ingredients, a rich, complex flavor and the best combination of perfect crust, bold, rich sauce and buttery, gooey cheese, this is it!  A few tips for first timers: 1. This place is wildly popular and even more so with the recent food network feature story. On a Saturday night, expect to wait about 2 hours. As long as you plan for it and are not starving, the wait is well worth it. Check in and then walk a couple blocks over to Lincoln Park and/or Lincoln Park Zoo to see the sites and use the time wisely. Set a timer on your phone and head back about 30 minutes before the time you were told. A lot of people abandon ship after checking-in so the wait is often a bit less than you were told. 2. If you are not one for waiting, get there on a Saturday at 11:00 when they open and have lunch or try a weeknight (there will likely be a wait still, but not as long as weekends) 3. No reservations accepted. Cash only (there's an ATM in the entry if you need it) 4. They don't take names and they don't keep a physical list when you are checking-in. This may seem crazy to some, but believe me when I say the guy that checks you in knows EXACTLY where you are in line, even with a 2-hour wait and 50 people waiting. This is part of the mystique and charm of this place. Don't hover and don't keep checking-in.  He is on top of it.  The only tip...wear something that make you stand out and easy to remember. Simple as a graphic tee or a bright red blouse, etc. He remembers you from what you are wearing. 5. Order the Mediterranean bread and the side salad to share. You will not be disappointed. 6. Take home some frozen pies to keep in the freezer. You will be hooked. And you will appreciate having them when the craving strikes. Enjoy!",0.988,0.828,0.139,0.033,0.5261904761904762
2016-07-30,4.0,"Thank you Tyler for your wonderful service and attention during our meal.  After visiting the Green City farmers market in the morning and then biking 20 miles along the Lakefront Trail, the wife and I decided to cancel out our morning workout activity by eating at Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder. This was our first visit and after hearing and reading about the crazy wait times we decided to come right at 11:30am when they opened. Little did we know that the place was already packed! We entered at 11:20am and the 99% of the seating was taken but we were fortunate to get a tiny booth that seated four adults. According to Tyler, due to the demand, the restaurant has been allowing customers in by 11am. By the time it was 11:40am, FORGET ABOUT getting a table. Wait times immediately became 1-1.5 hours. Food wise we ordered the Mediterranean bread, salad and one pizza. The Mediterranean bread is raved by many but we didn't Think it was anything special. Bread with some Italian seasoning for $8 was a bit steep but it was a large portion. The salad was standard but their house made dressing was AMAZING. The pizzas were super cheesy and very delicious. It's heavy due to the dough and slobs of cheese but oh so good!

2016-07-28,5.0,"After I booked my trip to Chicago, the food Network put a video about this place on Facebook  and I knew I HAD to go.  My boyfriend and I tried stopping in around 7pm on Sunday which did not exactly work out because the wait was 2 1/2 hours, and no we did not want to wait that long. So right before the Met vs Cub game, around 3pm we thought we would give this place another try since it was on the way.  I saw a few people sitting outside but didn't think anything of it. I went on in and the place was empty. I asked if they were open yet and the bartender said they would be open shortly. However, as soon as I walked in, a crowd of people followed me in. My boyfriend actually made fun of my because I am an airhead and didn't see the sign on the door that said it opened at 4pm. Whoops.  So the establishment wound up opening 1 hour earlier than expected because there was already HUGE line at the door.  They do not take reservations- so I suggest coming around the time they open just for this reason.  We were seated right away and were given a gigantic menu. Of course I came for two things- the salad and pizza pot pie.  The service was phenomenal. We told or waiter we were in a rush and happily accommodated us.  The salad was just EPIC. Super fresh and the two dressings it came with was literally to die for! I will just come back for the salad alone because it was amazing. Our pot pies took about 45 mins to make. My boyfriend was beyond impressed with it because he didn't know what to expect.  The pizza was very good too--cheese, sauce--- everything. I only had a couple of bites because I was so stuffed from overindulging in the salad but it was worth it.  I would absolutely visit this place again if I am In the area again.  The food was a solid 4 stars, but the service and opening an hour earlier because I can't read made me feel like it was absolutely necessary to give them 5 stars.",0.9873,0.852,0.112,0.037,0.5005654761904761

They were a bit difficult to eat given the texture, and all I can say is that I just don't understand the hype. They weren't bad by any means - just not worth waiting two hours for (or the hefty price tag).  I'd say the salad was actually better than the pizza pot pies - it resembled an antipasto and was HUGE!

2016-07-24,4.0,"Their pizza pot pie is novel, and it is delicious. The atmosphere is charming, and the wait staff is very friendly. But there are a few quirks about this place you should be aware of if you're going to make Chicago Pizza & Oven Grinder part of your evening plans.  First, don't be in a hurry. Plan to make an evening of it. Dinner here will likely eat up a few hours at least. Bring a friend and anticipate a lot of time to sit and chat. If you come alone, just allow yourself to be in the moment and enjoy. I recommend arriving as early as possible as this place seems to be quite popular, and wait times grow exponentially as the dinner hour goes on. Be aware that they don't have a traditional wait list. I don't know how they manage things without taking anyone's name or utilizing any kind of pager alert system, but they do. When I arrived among the hordes of eager diners and asked to get on the waiting list, they simply told me the wait time (which was substantial) and said I could wait at the bar until a table was ready for me. It wasn't until I was sitting contentedly at the very crowded bar that it occurred to me the host didn't even take my name or anything. I learned this was normal and decided to just have patience and faith in their unconventional methods, though I was concerned I might get lost in the crowd. But the patience paid off; they took care of me. Something else you should be prepared for is their CASH ONLY policy. So don't come in expecting to toss around some plastic. Bring bills. I ordered a pizza pot pie with mushrooms, meat sauce, and white crust. It was cheesy and delicious when it finally arrived (again, don't be in a rush). They bring it out and flip the bowl over onto your plate in front of you. While I was waiting for my pot pie, I munched on their Mediterranean Bread creation, which is basically a giant, Italian-style, naan-like flatbread. It's supposedly one of the most popular items on the menu and is definitely an item portioned for sharing. It's tasty as well as handy for sopping up any extra sauce from the pot pie. In my opinion, it would go well served with a small dish of pizza sauce to dip in.",0.9946,0.843,0.146,0.01,0.610639880952381

You wait! I know what time you come in....."" all I ask is how much longer, and I asked him twice before he said 20 mins....I know it's super busy and everyone is asking how much longer, but even I haven't begun to snap yet for waiting that long -_-  As for the Pizza Pot Pie....I honestly don't see what the hype is all about. The pizza looks cute since it's shaped like a bowl and melty cheese on top.  Flavor wise, taste just like a regular pizza. Texture of the sauce was too watery for me because of the whole mushroom inside it. Mushrooms let out a decent amount of water when heated, so baking it inside the marinara sauce would just make it thinner.... Mediterranean bread: pesto basil and cheese is thinly spread on the flat bread, and was ok. Would be better if it comes  with a side of sauce for dipping, instead of having to order another starter on the menu to go with it (as recommended by the restaurant). Rum Gelato: tasted like pistachio flavored gelato. And there seemed to be crushed nuts on top. Pretty good.",0.9907,0.794,0.181,0.025,0.4981934731934732

2016-07-07,2.0,"Mediocre. Waited 2+ hours on a Tuesday so I expected some BOMB food, didn't happen.  SERVICE: The seating and waiting method was archaic and inefficient. You go give an old man your name and he will memorize your face and call you when you're ready. He doesn't write anything down. There aren't buzzers like there are at other popular places such as Giordanos or The Cheesecake Factory. He does not remember as well as he should've. I saw groups of two (same size as mine) put in their names later than we did and get in faster. When we asked after waiting 2 hours, he told us that we were next and asked to confirm if we were a group of 4. We weren't. In fact, I was a bit put off that he mistook us for another group because that means that he doesn't actually remember some people even though he should! Also, I don't like to drop the race card, but the only other Asians that had been waiting as long as we did were indeed in a group of 4. This means that we were bypassed many times by other group of 2's because he didn't remember us being a group of 2. It was humid, there was no place to sit or wait so we continued to suffer a little while longer. Eventually we made it in and that was a flop too.  It would've been okay if the food actually lived up to its standards... FOOD / STAFF: The pizza pot pie was not bad by any means. It was good. I'd come again if I didn't have to wait, but it's just not worth the hype. The Mediterranean Bread was large and very filling for 2. It was seasoned well, but nothing mind blowing. It was just an oversized pita bread with a bunch of herbs and cheese thrown on it. Ehhh. Decent. The actual potpies were very filling as well. The cheese was abundant, My fork and knife made cheese bridges worthy of food porn, but that was about it. I heard raves about the sauce and I just didn't think it was as good as the reviews said. It contains homemade sausages but it wasn't really anything that stood out while I was eating. I didn't get mushrooms on mine, but my boyfriend did. He got like 3 so it wasn't like the mushrooms made a difference in the meal. Last but not least, the dough. That's what it was. Dough. It was cooked but it still tasted and had the same texture as dough. I wanted something more. Maybe crispy or bread-like. I don't know. I just didn't want something so doughy and chewy. It wasn't my cup of tea and precisely why I don't think I'll wait another 2 hours to come back.  The server also wasn't personable. She was bland and just wanted to get everything done and over with so I didn't feel welcomed or warm. The whole meal felt like a business transaction despite the location having a cozy ambiance. It was strictly business. Eat. Pay. Get out. There's just so much hype around this place that I had higher expectations from the notorious seater to the good food, this place just fell flat.

Chicago is a city that hails some of the best pizza in America.  Most people equate deep dish when they think of pizza in Chicago, but this gorgeous and world class city offers something you'd be hard pressed to find anywhere else.  What could that be????  A pizza pot pie! That's where Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder Company comes in.  So, what exactly is a pizza pot pie?  Imagine a bowl made of the softest, most tastiest dough, filled with fresh ingredients and topped with oh so much cheese!  According to their website: ""The Pizza Pot Pie is an individual serving, ""made from scratch"" with triple-raised Sicilian bread-type dough; a homemade sauce consisting of olive oil, fresh garlic, onions, green peppers, whole plum tomatoes and a special blend of cheeses; and doorknob-size, whole, fresh mushrooms."" These heavenly creations come in a half pound or one pound size.  Yes, pound. A half pound will comfortably feed the hungriest of the hungry and the pound is great for parties of two or more. Since I don't eat pork, I always order the Vegetarian: Tomato sauce, brick and Swiss cheese, eggplant, onions, olives, mushrooms, red and green peppers, Romano cheese, garlic oil and Italian spices. Also, the pizza's do take a while, which is why I would highly recommend ordering the Mediterranean bread which can comfortably serve 2-4 people.  I genuinely believe it is something that shouldn't be missed.   This meal is pretty decadent but so worth the splurge.  Also, they're CASH ONLY!!!",0.9966,0.768,0.22,0.012,0.4589508928571429

This place does not take reservations so we had a 1.5 hour wait at 7ish on a Sunday. The way you ""sign in"" is by telling a man in the blue shirt how many.

The table got the Mediterranean bread, chef salad, and each a 1/2 pound pizza. The Mediterranean bread was good, but the real star was the Italian seasoning. Really kicked the bread up! The salad was also surprisingly good! Mixing the two dressings made the difference.  The reason everybody comes is for the pizza. It is a little tough to describe, but my brother called it a lasagna in a bread bowl. The sauce was outstanding and the sausage was delectable.. I kind of wished they offerend more toppings besides sausage and mushrooms, but I probably would have ordered the same thing anyway.  Our service was also outstanding! Our server knew the menu and was able to be very attentive even though it is packed.  For the most part, the dinner was actually affordable for deep Lincoln Park. The portions are pretty large and the alcoholic drinks were big as well!  The only downsides was the confusing checking in process and that they only take cash.

2016-05-30,3.0,"Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder Company doesn't brown the sausage meat that goes into the sauce. Cash only. Mic drop, so you're just eating boiled ground pork in sauce (at least that's what it tasted like to me), unpleasant, but the whole pizza pot pie idea is cute. Take a bowl, layer the bottom with cheese, add the sauce, and pop the dough on top and bake. Once it comes out, flip it out onto a plate, and chow down.  Back to the the beginning. The wait in a Friday evening around 5:30PM was 30-40 mins. Just let the maiter'd, guy in the red shirt, know how many in your group, he'll let you know how long, and remember your face. No names, so if you're undercover you won't need an undercover name, but you may need a disguise.  Ordered the Mediterranean bread to start. It's finger food draped onto the table. Don't be afraid to make a mess. They'll wipe it off. Tasty, herby, but could use some dipping sauce or stringy cheese. There's only one pot pie pizza on the menu but you can get it mushroom-less or meat-less. Chocolate came with the check. The service was impeccable. We got a cheery chap that was helpful and patient. The booth style was cozy, though if you have long legs, may pose as a challenge. Ordering three separate pot pie pizzas was certainly more expensive than ordering a whole pizza at one of the other touristy destinations. Certainly fresh, but doesn't guarantee tasty.

You have to sort of scoop it out of the plate: anchovies, tomatoes, olives, loads of feta cheese, cucumbers and a head of lettuce (almost) and chop it up on your plate. The small order is enough for four people! Their Greek dressing was the best, but they also sit a sweet poppyseed and ranch dressing on the table. We also split their ""world famous"" pizza pot pie. We asked for the whole wheat crust and mushrooms and meat. It takes 25 minutes to prepare and comes bubbling with cheese. The sauce is Sicilian cooking at its best.

2016-05-28,3.0,"The concept of the ""Pizza Pot Pie"" which is the signature dish here is what drives business at this place. It's unique, it's fun, and a clever spin for a city that loves pizza! For me, the concept is really the highlight because the actual product was only average. The only option for ingredients inside the ""pizza pie"" is either vegetarian or pork meat sauce and with or without mushroom (3 whole button mushrooms shoved inside the pot pie). Some may appreciate this because it makes the choice easy but then for others like me, I felt limited.  When the pot pie pizza arrived, it was steaming and the dough was oh so soft! There's a good layer of cheese and the meat sauce was pretty tasty. The pork was literally ground pork - not ""sausage"" so this whole thing reminded me more of a lasagna than pizza. While the meal satisfied my hunger, this is not a meal that I'd ever crave or would want to bring any of my ""foodie"" friends to since the flavors were nothing to rave about but I could see how tourists would love to experience the novelty concept of a ""pizza pot pie"".",0.987,0.798,0.18,0.022,0.5866402116402116

2016-05-24,1.0,"Food & customer service: Disappointing. Usually, one is better than the other, but not so in this case.   Food - Conceptually, the pie's a novel and fun idea, though when it comes to taste, there's nothing particularly unique about the dough, the sauce, and the ingredients - which to a Chicagoan can all make or break a pizza.  It seems like the majority of reviewers talk about the concept, but again, the taste isn't out-of-the-ordinary.   Service - Main manager incorrectly took my order over the phone. He argued that I said one thing; I said the other.  Blah, blah.  Not a big deal, at least not to me, but it was clearly upsetting to him. He also refused to take change as part of payment.  When asked for red pepper flakes, he suggested opening the take-out box and pouring it onto the pizza as he didn't have any ""to-go"" containers (hard to believe when I arrived at 4PM when the place opened).   In sum, I'd come back if the pizza was good, but again, you'd go mainly because of the concept.",0.7579,0.817,0.103,0.08,0.38072916666666673

Because the cheese isn't exposed to direct heat, it doesn't brown up, if that's your jam.  They also have humungo salads that are basically the contents of a party sub arranged onto a salad plate - with homemade dressings.  It's a great place for a group, if you're willing to wait.  There's no where else like it, and I love to take people here who are from out of town for a truly unique Chicago experience.  I can't comment on the grinders...because I always have to get that pie pizza!",0.9696,0.814,0.152,0.034,0.5361111111111112

I took my wife the other day and we ordered two one pounders, some ""med bread"" and three pink lemonades. Even while eating, I was constantly telling the staff how I was recommended here and how good the food was.  Now here's why I gave it one star! First off, they were an ""cash only"" operation!!! like come on! its 2016!! get wit the program!!! everyone else accepts cards, why can't you!!! Secondly, the food is overpriced!!! it was almost thirty dollars for a pizza per person!, for a place that's not heavily advertised, that's a bit high, even spots like Lou Malnati's, Giordanos , etc. Don't charge that high! Because no one really buys the half pounder anyways, maybe for like a kid, but not a fully grown adult.  Thirdly and lastly; they don't do refills!!! I feel like if I'm about to give you 80 bucks for a pizza dinner for two, the least you can do is offer refills! Almost every pizza dinner place offers refills, like awwwww ca mon!! So the place was ok, but the pizza wasn't even as good as Giordano's, or the other big pizza spots. To be more of a mom and pop pizza place, this is too much!!! Get it together!

Ambiance- had lots of character in the exterior and interior of the restaurant. Its a smaller place so plan accordingly.",0.9763,0.805,0.184,0.011,0.5128174603174603
2016-03-26,3.0,"1) Long long long wait on a weekend. If you're coming with a group of 15-20, forget about it unless you want to split up. I'd say cap it at 8, there was one table for 10-11. And if you have a big group,  make sure one person comes here 30-60 minutes before to hold your spot in line.  2) The sign for the restaurant is not huge, so as soon as you get 0.25 miles near the restaurant, start scanning for it on the first floor of an apartment building. Better yet, look for 'Riccardo Enoteca' which has a huge green sign and look directly across and you'll find this place.  3) You will need to open three doors to reach the short sorta old waitlist man (do not stand in the first room thinking he will come to you!!). It gets more and more crowded as you open each door. After you open the third door, wait for the short man to come by and make eye contact with him and tell him ""I'm new"" and he'll ask ""how many"" and you'll reply ""6"" and he'll say ""okay 1 hour and 40 minute wait, wait at the bar or close to the entrance"" and then you'll start to wonder why he hasn't written your name down on the waitlist until a regular standing by will tell you ""this is how it works here, he memorizes your face and has a mental waitlist"".... and now you wait, wait and wait until the genius man tells you your table is ready.  4) if it wasn't clear in number 3, I waited 10 minutes to put myself on the waitlist.  4) Parking. there is valet parking for $10 but why would you do that if you can park on Clark for free. No joke, the street this restaurant is on has free parking and a couple blocks nearby have it as well. I uploaded a picture of a map that shows free parking in green on Saturday night.  5) This place is slammed from 6-9 on Saturday nights. You better be okay with having people all around you while you wait and be willing to walk through a crowd when you enter and exit. In other words, if you have claustrophobia, avoid this place during extreme busy hours. Call ahead to find out!  6) The pot pie was definitely good. But, sadly, I have to say that there are better pizza options in Chicago and the greater area. I will never ever come here if the wait is 2 hours long. 30 minutes is okay bc it will give me time to mingle with friends, anything above 1 hour is enough for me to choose elsewhere. While we were waiting in line, people were telling us it's totally worth the wait and that we'll love it... so I guess it's on you and depends on what style pizza you like.  7) Everything about this place is unique. It's special in it's own way and can't be compared to deep dish. I'll probably visit this place once a year, but it was ""one and done"" for my friends who came here. Again, there are a plethora of pizza restaurants in Chicago, and many of them are much cheaper then the $18/person you'll pay here.  8) The negatives: - No jalapeños!!! Huge downside for me. The only spice you can add are the crushed peppers or tabasco sauce - Our Mediterranean bread was touching the table, anyone who is in the health field knows how nasty that is (our phones, wallets/purses were in the center of the table until the waiter asked us to move it). Why can't they get bigger plates?  - the price. $13 for the half pounder alone. add in the appetizer and drink and you're looking at $18 easily without tip. If you're a hungry man, a one pounder is $25 which is more expensive then a deep dish pizza at peqouds that serves 4.  - cash only 9) No matter what I say on here, or what anyone else says, this place is banking and consistently busy. You should give it a shot to formulate your own opinion.m",0.994,0.832,0.115,0.053,0.5146621511204846

Some friends and I went right when the place opened at 11:30 on a Saturday and were seated right away.  We ordered the Mediterranean bread and each got a pizza pot pie.  The Mediterranean bread had great flavor and was soft and buttery.  I would recommend getting it even if you're not that hungry.  Even with the butter, it is a pretty light dish. The pizza pot pie itself had all the tastes of your standard deep dish pizza, but just in a different form.  The sausage in the sauce had good texture and taste.  I felt that the sauce was a little on the sweet side, but the sausage balanced it out nicely.  Also beware that there is a ton of cheese on these things.  When they come and serve you the pot pie itself, it oozes all over the plate once you cut into it.  Finally, despite what it looks like when it arrives at your table, there isn't that much crust/bread on this dish, which is a nice surprise. Go early to avoid the lines, because they don't take reservations and you need to have your full party present to be seated.",0.9759,0.832,0.14,0.029,0.4987577639751553

2016-03-03,3.0,"super underwhelming.   the waitress insisted my friends and i get the mediterranean bread.  the flavor of it was fine but i seriously can't understand why they serve it on a tiny plate.  as another reviewer mentioned, it left quite a mess on the table (and also, i don't normally get paranoid about the cleanliness of restaurant tables, but i kept thinking about the rag of the busboy who'd wiped our table last, and what kind of germs might now be on our bread ""skirt"" because of it).  and i love my friends and i'm sure their hands were clean, but it seemed weird to me that we were meant to tear apart this communal bread with our hands.  and finally, i would have liked some sort of sauce or butter or something to accompany the bread.   the pizza was really meh too.  seems to me to be purchased for its novelty, not its quality or flavor.  the first thing i noticed was the cheese.  because of the way the pizza is made, the cheese ends up being baked in the bottom of the bowl, and then on top when the bowl is flipped.  the result is that the cheese gets no exposure to the oven's heating elements like it would on a new york-style pizza, so no bubbly brown cheese.  and since the cheese is also not covered up by sauce as it would be on a chicago-style pizza, it just looks like a greasy, unappealing blob.   i opted for the pizza with meat and with mushrooms (also, hello, why the super-limited topping options?  one of the best things about pizza is being able to customize your toppings!) and really wasn't impressed with the execution.  the meat was basically just ground beef mixed into the sauce and the mushrooms were WHOLE.  what in the world?  so i ended up with exactly four whole mushrooms in my 1/2-pound pizza and no other vegetables of any kind.  the overall flavor of my pizza wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't great, and i really didn't enjoy having some bites with no mushroom and some that were nothing BUT mushroom. i don't think i'll be back.  i saw a few of the salads and grinders at other tables and they looked large and unwieldy--again, novel to look at, but not great to eat.  and the cash-only thing is pretty ridiculous too.",0.9573,0.781,0.128,0.091,0.5149635893821941

Our server, Brandon (?) was curt at best. I felt like cattle getting hurried through our meal. Boxes were dropped while we were still eating, dessert was brought while our dinner was still on the table, and the check was dropped before we started our dessert. Look, I get it. We're all servers. It's busy. We certainly weren't going to sit after our meal for an hour talking, there are other people that have been waiting for 2 hours and I would never do that to the server who is trying to make money.

Seriously, I wish pizza pot pies were more popular because this place is life changing. The Mediterranean bread is damn tasty, but can be pretty filling. The seasonings on this bread are full of flavor and you can buy the seasoning in the restaurant to take home so hello do it. I even add it to the pot pie. Will def be back!

The wait time was a little crazy for a weekday (waited almost an hr for a table for 4) however they have a small bar where we waited and had a few drinks. The bartender (Cesar) was awesome!! He def knows how to make good drinks and interact with the customers. The wait honestly didn't feel bad since we had a drink in our hand and a stool to sit!  We started off with the Mediterranean bread (since everyone recommends it) and we were glad we tried it!! Its so good!! Then the pizza is individual size so everyone got their own. I really loved the sauce and the cheese of this pie style pizza! The sauce and the ingredients definitely feel fresh and made there and not something from a can! After we ate our pizza we were all content and wanting to come back.

The salad is plain but yummy, something you can put together at home..simply add dill, buy or make tzasiki sauce (what they call their homemade dressing..its tsaziki sauce lets be real) and mix some Italian seasoning in there along with oil and vinegar. It is very yummy but like i said, easily replicated.  The pot pie itself is good. Not -wait two hours, pay 14 dollars- good however. It is bread with sausage and mushrooms with cheese on top and very little salt. I don't see the big deal regarding this meal. I honestly think most people who ga-ga over this restaurant are simply impressed with the presentation rather than the taste itself.

Mediterranean bread: Comes out as a giant mass of bread that takes over the plate. Delicious and freshly baked with fresh herbs. Perfect for sharing with your table. Oven grinders: Huge style sub sandwiches filled with an abundance of meat and veggies and melted into a cheesy amazing concoction. Life is not complete without an Italian sandwich like this in your life.  Chef's Salad: Generous portion, amazing and perfect toppings and dressing.

For four people I ordered 4 1/2 pound pizzas, one large Country French salad, two bottles of dressing and two orders of the ""Tortoni"" ice cream dessert. 4 stars for the ""pizza"" and 1 star for the ""Country French"" salad. I popped in for the carryout and was greeted by a long confused line. No one was really sure what systems were in place, but when I got to the manager and told him I was picking up a to-go he pulled me through the crowd and into the dining room with dark wood panelling. I was handed two huge bags, both surprisingly heavy. I was also handed a bill for $101 which was cash only. I knew the cash only thing ahead of time and spent 10 minutes sourcing an ATM before arriving. Talk about a pain in the ass. Also, talk about a lot of money for a four person pizza dinner.  Let's discuss the salad first. Wow. What a hot mess. Or rather, a cold unappealing mess. I ordered the large for $19.50 and it was presented on a huge party tray. Unfortunately 95% of the giant mass of salad was wet and wilted iceberg lettuce. The remaining 5% included a hand full of farm cheese, a small amount of olives, some huge chunks of tomato and some super thinly sliced veggies. They were thrown on top of the iceberg in such a bad ratio it was unclear how this was a salad at all. It was really just $20 of iceberg with some pretty awful salad dressings. I regret ordering the extra bottles.  As for the pizza? DELICIOUS! Yes. It really really was. But it was / is absolutely not pizza. It's also not a ""pot pie"" as mentioned in some of their social media. It's closer to a pizza soup bread bowl than anything. Using the name pizza at all feels really inappropriate. The crust soaks up the sauce so fast and if the same ingredients were built in a traditional pizza type dish it would fall apart immediately.  That said, yeah, seriously delicious. The soupy sauce was bright and clean with a perfect tomato sweetness and the cheese game was on point. The ""toppings"" or rather things floating in the soup were great but almost non existent. I counted one meatball and two mushrooms in my bread bowl, er... pizza? We also really loved our ice cream Tortoni dish. The rum really popped out. Highly recommended as a perfect meal ender.

2015-09-16,5.0,"This place is a Chicago landmark. I have always loved going there and food is consistently great. The wait can be brutal, but it is what is, just prepare accordingly and the meal will be worth it.  The space is not that large and I wouldn't recommend trying to sit more than 6 people together.  Bring cash, they don't take credit cards. Bring your appetite as every item is HUGE.  I always recommend for newbies trying one of the flat bread's and a salad. Mediterranean Bread and a Chef's Salad or Country French Salad are my go to's. Again, portions are humongous and people can easily share these items and make them starters. They have two dressings (sour cream garlic and poppyseed) that are a deliciously amazing combo when you mix them together, with the salad. Can't get enough of the these salad dressings and want to put them on everything! The pizza pot pies will be a new mind blowing experience, like nothing you've ever seen or eaten. They are certainly big enough to share, but yummy enough to eat the whole thing.  I love the button mushrooms, along with a meat choice.  The sandwiches/grinders are again, huge. Can't argue with the price when you could easily take half of everything home for another meal, but there's never anything left at the end of the meal! This is definitely a departure from the regular Chicago pizza joint. A great place to try, and if you're not careful, it very well may be your new crave.",0.9957,0.725,0.234,0.041,0.4990661637213361

First, they don't write down names for the order of who is next to be seated. The guy just remembers your face. I get it. The guy has worked there forever and this is the way they do things... but it's annoying when you are told an hour wait and hour and 20 minutes later, you have no idea when you're going to be seated or who is next. I can forgive all that, but things just got worse.  My friend and I split a pizza and meatball sub. Do you want a pizza and sub with your cheese? Too bad. They are both made up of 90% cheese. Don't get me wrong, I love cheese, but Jesus. It wasn't anything special, just cheese. Also, after my friend had already ordered a soda, they tell him they charge for refills. I have NEVER heard of that before. And they should tell you before you order it.  By that point, I was underwhelmed by the place and kind of mad we waited 90 minutes for cheese but still happy. Then they give us the check. It was around $90 for 4 people. My friend pulls out his credit card and the lady tells us, ""Oh, sorry. It's cash only"". Whhhhhaaatttt???? Cash only restaurant that averages $25/person?  They have been around for like 40 years and don't have a credit card machine. My friend had to go find an ATM. They said there was a sign when you walked in. It's not my job to read every sign anticipating poor customer service. I'm lucky there wasn't a sign that said, ""$100 fee for sitting"".  That's when I told the manager we will never come back again. Food was subpar at best, had to wait an hour and a half when told an hour because they're too pretentious to write down names, they wait until we order to tell us they are the only restaurant in the world that charges for refills on soda, AND THEY DONT TAKE CREDIT CARDS!!!

2015-07-06,5.0,"My boyfriend and I were wandering around the Lincoln Park area in search of dinner after visiting the zoo and randomly stumbled upon the Chicago and Pizza Over Grinder Company. Assuming it was a normal pizza joint we decided that would be fine. We were impressed the moment we walked in.  It is obviously an older building, but cute none the less. We put our name in and waited at the bar for the 25 minute duration. We each ordered a glass of Chianti and enjoyed it immensely. I am normally a sweet white wine type of girl, but for some reason I decided to go with the flow and was pleasantly surprised with this wine. It wasn't very dry and had really good flavor.  Once seated, I decided upon the vegetarian grinder and my boyfriend ordered the sausage pot pie. My meal was absolutely to die for. It is a sandwich which has the same ingredients as a pizza with the choice of seasoned white or wheat bread. Even with no meat it was extremely filling (I only ate about a third) and so tasty. They specialize however, in the pizza pot pies. I do not eat pork so I could not try my boyfriend's, but he did let me know that it was one of his favorite meals EVER.  Even the 4 person booths are very small and it is dimly lit. We highly recommend this place for a date night.",0.9772,0.835,0.132,0.033,0.563125

The service is consistently great - friendly wait staff that offers tips and suggestions. When you walk in, they dont take your name down and instead just memorize the order of guests that walk in - being remembered and recognized makes your experience feel personal right off the bat.  Even when its crowded, I've never waited longer than 25 minutes.  The atmosphere is rustic, cozy, and comfortable.  Love this place, and will be back soon!",0.995,0.781,0.219,0.0,0.5800117577895357

We were told the wait was 45 minutes (spoiler alert: it was worth it). Don't be thrown off when the host doesn't write down your name! Apparently, he has been there forever and has a photographic memory. I was a little skeptical at first, but sure enough exactly 45 minutes later, the host found me and my friend at the crowded bar.  In terms of food, we started with the Mediterranean bread. It was this thin bread with spices, and it was absolutely perfect. FYI - it's pretty big (think the size of a large pizza) and definitely meant to be shared.  The specialty at CPOG is their pot pies, and I've decided they're the best things ever. They are personal sized pizzas that are cooked upside down, and then flipped over in front of you. They don't have too many options. You can basically choose (1) mushroom or no mushroom (2) meat or no meat and (3) white or wheat crust. I got no mushrooms, no meat, and white crust (the waiter said it was better...), and loved the pizza. Also, one pot pie is a lot for one person.

2015-06-27,3.0,"This place is definitely unique. Cool old-school Italian vibe. Really friendly staff. The Mediterranean bread was legit. I got the pizza pot pie with meat sauce and mushrooms. It's very different than any other sort of pizza I have had. Really good, but not amazing. The mushrooms were whole and huge and therefore didn't quite cook all the way. The meat sauce was basically spaghetti sauce I would make at home. So it was kinda like putting meaty spaghetti sauce on top of a piece of really good bread and then melting a ton of cheese on it. So it was really good. Especially when you put their ""special seasoning"" on there. That stuff is amazing.  Heads up, it's cash-only place, which I am whole-heartedly against considering I live in 2015. Really glad someone gave me a heads up ahead of time. So that's sort of the reason this isn't a 4 starts. It's really not hard to accept cards.  Would be nice if they would go ahead and just start doing that.",0.9749,0.75,0.194,0.056,0.6659047619047619
2015-06-27,5.0,"CPOG was one of our favorites when we lived in chicago 10 years ago, and we really would find it hard to visit the city and NOT eat there. Yes to all the things people have been saying: cash only, long wait, dark lighting, bad parking... Don't be stupid. If you ran a business and didn't want to waste time and $ with credit card vendors taking a % of your income, and you knew that your business would still thrive...you'd do cash only too.  As for the line: I know that so many Americans want everything they want in the way that they want it and immediately when they want it and no one else in the universe matters. Well, I'd like to introduce you to the real world where some people get to places before you and you just have to wait. Now, I will say that it is a little unnerving because there is one little old Hispanic man who occasionally swings by the front door to put you on the wait list, and he NEVER writes anything down. Let me just say that he's been there for at least a decade and he ALWAYS remembers who came in what order and how many are in each party.  As for the atmosphere: You can definitely pay a LOT more for your food and go some place that has dumped a naval tonne of money into the decor of their restaurant. Just know that that is where you are spending your money. If you want some place that has the exact same finishes and decor as when they first opened their doors and you are just paying for the food, then this is the place for you. Also, you are in Chicago, where buildings are piled up on top of each other and little to no natural light gets into the ground-floor levels. If this is a problem for you, you should consider a different city. As for the parking: You are in Chicago. You can ride public transit. Or, God forbid, walk.

That's no problem.  Then we get seated and greeted. All is well. We place our order and, still, all is well. The appetizer Mediterranean Bread comes out and we enjoyed it...that was probably our favorite of all the food we tried.  Then the grinders (salty) come out. Still, all is well and we're munching on the appetizer bread. Suddenly, the busser comes over and asks if we are done and need to box anything...huh??? That catches us off guard as all of our mouths were still chewing on bread but after a few seconds I manage to say, ""we're still working on it."" The busser leaves and we look at each other like...what's going on; did he not see the grinders are untouched; did he not know that we just sat down 15 minutes ago; did he not see we were all eating??? Okay, so he comes back in 10 minutes and our pizza (too doughy) had just arrived but he asks the same question, are you done/do you need boxes...what the heck?????? This time, one member of our party snaps at him. Note to management: it's not okay to rush your customers; it's even worse when they just sat down and the food isn't fully served on the table yet.

The pizza is technically a ""pot-pie"" with a thick crust, mounds of cheese, a super tasty bolognese, and whole button mushrooms.  The crust is a little bread-y, but it is more than compensated by the cheese and sauce.  This is definitely a fork-and-knife meal - no folding your slices here!  We also ordered a meatball grinder.  You may as well call it a meatball casserole topped with garlic bread!  It was massive and also another fork-and-knife dish!

The first time my parents took me here as a child, I realized from then on I would judge all food experiences from this place.

You think I'm exaggerating - I am not. This is my favorite restaurant. For starters - the location. In the heart of Lincoln Park and close to the zoo, this place is located perfectly. But it's also fairly hidden. From the street, you wouldn't expect much since it's just a restaurant under a residence. But when you walk in, you immediately know this place will be amazing. Usually crowded and always a line in a restaurant that is just slightly larger than most college dorm rooms. But it just works. It's dark (dark woods make up the booths and dim lighting) but somehow it works.  Then the food. If you're not ordering Mediterranean Bread as an appetizer you're already doing everything wrong. The thing is a giant piece of dough covered in amazing spices. For something that seems so simple, it tastes so amazing. It's also virtually impossible to replicate - I know, I've tried to make it.  The pizza pot pies are amazing as well. Individual pots of pizza heaven covered in cheese. The dough is soft, the meat is cooked perfectly and the sauce makes you want more. I always scarf down my meal because it's so good that I just forever want it on my taste buds. And then it's all consumed and I'm full - both with food, joy and sadness. The food, well it's a super filling meal; the joy, because it's usually been months or even years since I last tasted this divine food; the sadness, because I don't have room to eat another and I'm not sure when I'll be back.

Comes with a side of their secret spice mix and olive oil.. LOVED IT - Italian Festa Salad: This Salad is HUGE and can be easily shared by 5 ppl at the very least. It came with the finest selection of premium Italian meats, sausage meatballs, stuffed olives, pickled red-pepper, mushrooms, artichokes, Cheese and Greens. HUGE PORTION .. we loved it.. came with 2 dressings which were perfect accompaniments. - Pizza Pot Pies: There are only 2  customization options for these individual portion sized pot-pies: Meat/Vegetarian and  w/Mushrooms.

We were visited by a few employees who asked how we were doing asked about our experience very welcoming.  A must try when in Chicago. The pizza pot pie takes 20 minutes to make so make sure you have plenty of time because this is a popular spot and will have to wait a bit.

However, here comes my only complaint about the restaurant. ... You cannot get extra sauce for your grinder for your sandwich .  I have asked every time I've been there, and they always say no.

I also don't like the fact that the pot pie doesn't include Italian sausage.  It has ground pork not Italian sausage.  When I think of good Chicago pizza I imagine it full of cheese with nice chunks of Italian sausage.  The crust on the pie is okay.  I ended up eating the top layer of cheese and left the rest.  I'm glad I tried this place but I won't be back.  Last thing, the service was really good!  I'm giving 3 stars because they only take cash .  C'mon people it's 2015, get a credit card machine or square!!  The pizza pie is really not that good, the sauce isn't pizza sauce!!  The grinder was the best thing, but I'm not a fan of soggy bread so I only ate the meat, veggies and cheese.",0.9907,0.762,0.188,0.049,0.4791666666666667

2015-03-20,2.0,"Despite its reputation as one of the must-try pizza places, it was pretty underwhelming for me.  Their signature dish, the Pizza Pot Pie, definitely deserves points for creativity. I'm sure you can read much better descriptions of it in other reviews, but it's essentially a bowl shaped creation with pizza-like filling served upside down.  It was also hot and fresh, but due to how it is made (or maybe served), the distribution of sauce and cheese was really skewed. It felt like a lot of the cheese was clumped early on and in the end I was basically just eating sauce and bread. Also the sauce wasn't particularly flavorful which didn't help that. Hopefully it was just a bad exception, but there are so many great pizza joints that it's unlikely I'll be trying it again.",0.8639,0.781,0.151,0.068,0.5192810457516339
2015-03-18,4.0,"Now THIS is American innovation. The Italians know their pizzas. Americans, and specifically Chicagoans, have innovated on pizzas to create the pan pizza. The British know their savory pies. Americans have taken that idea and developed pot pies. And let's bow down to Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder, which has taken all of this know-how and created the pizza potpie. I hadn't been here in more than 10 years, mainly because I haven't wanted to go with my friends and had to wait in a long line. But I was in the neighborhood at the Chicago History Museum, and I had a powerful hunger. After seeing the historical bona fides of Chicago innovation, I wanted to taste them. Wow, what I've been missing! Talk about the perfect comfort food on a day that had rebounded back to winter from warm spring the day before. I had expected that the pot pies had different variations, but the only variation is whether you want meat or not, and whether you want mushrooms or not. And what they gave me is exactly what I wanted. Warm tomato sauce, gooey cheese, the perfect-sized crust: what was there not to like? I got there at about 4:45 PM on a Tuesday, and I was able to get a table right away, but nearly all were filled. So I won't be coming back with a group of friends anytime soon. The server was very friendly throughout my meal. And the glass of water with the slice of lemon in it was kept filled.

On the other hand, the main thing they are known for are their pot pies, which we found to be rather boring. That leaves me with having to give a three star review, because I would go back just for the flatbread and salad, but we were so disappointed with the pot pies! The flatbread is notorious in Chicago. It is HUGE. I don't mean huge, I mean HUGE. When I've heard people talk about it, I thought they were exaggerating. They weren't. It comes draped over a plate and takes up almost a third of the table. It is also covered in a magical mixture of dried herb and spices and possibly fairy dust?? It's fantastic. It's delicate, warm, tender, delicious flat bread that you pull apart with your hands and stuff into your hungry mouth.  The chef salad seems like a regular ole salad. It comes with lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, green and black olives, pepperoncini, onions, artichoke hearts, and green peppers, and it's served with sour cream garlic dressing, sweet and sour poppyseed dressing, and the greatest most delicious, mouth watering Italian dressing I've had in my entire life. They sell this for $7.00 a bottle and that is a deal. It's so good.  Some people may enjoy the pot pies, but I think after the hype I've heard about it, and after seeing how tasty they look coming out of the kitchen, I was disappointed with the bland, soft crust and uninteresting sauce. While I won't deny that the fresh ingredients were delicious, which included garlic, onions, green peppers, cheeses, sausage and whole mushrooms, I couldn't help but feel that it was missing some flavor. Amping up the crust would be a good start. It needs to either be cooked differently to give it a crunchy edge, or it needs some sort of additional ingredient to make it more unique. I just felt like it was this soft, sad pie crust with no character.  But, I will say we will be going back just to get salads and flatbread in the very near future.",0.9925,0.743,0.175,0.081,0.5694386916502302

It's got more cheese than your traditional deep dish, and as someone who is somewhat lactose intolerant, I only ate half of the pizza and saved half, mostly so that I didn't get sick from the cheese! The others at the table also like the pizza. Those big mushrooms were awesome! Drinks: We saw a sticker on the menu that advertised this apple cider drink. It had apple cider, red wine, brandy, and some other liquor, and had cinnamon in it. The waitress described it as 'Christmas in a cup'. We got two, and they were yummy! Perfect on a freezing Chicago winter day. It is cash only, so be prepared for that. The sign for it could be a little more visible, but we had read Yelp beforehand, so were prepared.

Enormously massive. But enormously delicious. It is covered with Mediterranean seasonings, very oregano heavy, and it is warm and soft and perfect. It could be a meal unto itself. But we did order more. For two, in addition to the bread, we also shared a sandwich: a meatball oven grinder. It too is massive. Too massive for the two of us to handle, actually, even when shared. They were kind enough to split it onto two plates, much appreciated. The point here is that the portions are extremely generous, but they are just as generous on flavor. This is a winning sandwich you won't regret ordering. Newbs need to be prepared for the unique seating protocol. There are no reservations. There is no leaving your name. You tell the gent how many, and he finds you when there's room. I've seen the wait for dinner extend beyond 3 hours (it's  a tight space), so i don't know how he does it, but i know so many people who swear he never forgets a face. The solution: come during lunch. Even on a weekend, the wait when we have gone has never been more than 30-40 minutes. While we sat at the bar, he came to grab the couple next to us, when my girlfriend whispers that they came in after us.

We arrived right at 11:30a and the place was empty when we were seated but by 11:50a every table was full and there was already a wait. The Mediterranean bread was fantastic - but the it's bigger than the plate it comes on so the edges touch the table when they set it down. This wasn't an issue for anyone but me because I have germ issues ;) One person in my group got a small salad and it was huge - as in 4 of us could have shared it. Two of us got the pizza pot pies - the crust and fillings were good but the cheese on it was AMAZING. I don't know what they did to it but it was hands down the best pizza cheese ever. Ever. Why the 4 stars instead of 4? Two things: 1) no free refills on drinks and that's one of my biggest pet peeves when a restaurant is serving fountain drinks and 2) the 4th person  in our group (my husband) got a grinder and it was gross. My husband is not a picky eater and loves grinders but he got the Italian Combo one and it was cold when he got it with about 6 pounds of this weird half melted Swiss cheese - it basically tasted like a gas station sub. Gross. Bottom line: great place to eat but get what they're known for - pizza pot pie. Also - as a bonus - the table next to us got the antipasto and it looked delicious!!,0.9943,0.761,0.192,0.047,0.5285396825396826

As you can tell, I enjoyed it.  I also found the server very pleasant a surprisingly nice selection of wine and beers.   The only thing I wish they change is their cash only policy, if they took credit cards I could have taken home some frozen pizzas.",0.9945,0.771,0.229,0.0,0.6796296296296296

He didn't return. We're not the people to hassle. But when more people got seated at the table near us, they were a group of 5 and the table was a 4 person sized at a squash, we approached the host and said how long for us as we have been waiting 1 hour 15 minutes and he said 40 mins initially, almost double the time. He must had forgotten about us as his order of seating goes on memory (or in our case lack of or bad). We were the next group seated at a table big enough for 8 people!!!!  So if you want to get seated quickly, i suggest you hassle the host multiple times or go somewhere else.  The 'pot pies', i think they were called only have meat or veg..... I asked what was in the veg and it's the same as the meat but without the sausage, in my mind, they have missed a trick, if a vegetarian goes for a veggie meal, they want to feel equal to a meat eater not that they are getting ripped off for lack of ingredients.

They also noted they only got three black olives each.  The service was excellent, with someone filling up our water glasses every five minutes and removing our dirty plates abruptly. Almost too abruptly at times.  The restaurant is in an old townhouse in Lincoln Park so the inside decor makes you feel like you are in the early 1900s.

It's pretty dark on the inside with some very red wood color and dimly lit tables, complete with that wonderful aroma of pizza. We began with the Mediterranean bread which was a very thin but obnoxiously large round portion of dough that was seasoned very nicely with some green spices. We were instructed to eat it like finger food and tear and share the overflowing-off-the-plate bread. Next, we decided to split a bottle of Chianti, which went great with our entrees, wasn't overly pricey and because why not? I opted for the pizza pot pie which was absolutely awesome! Kind of heavy and I wished they even had a smaller one, but hey, it was still exceptionally good. The sauce was flavorful, dough was soft (how I like it) and everything tasted fresh.  My sidekick ordered the Italian grinder which I also tried and despite enjoying cold, deli-style sandwiches more, this hot sandwich was awesome, and for the portion size was HUGE! We had to take some home! The service wasn't bad either.

The service is great the food is great. The only downside is that it's pretty famous and thus pretty packed... It's old so it's small and cramped. They have booths but they are wooden and small.  My advice:Just realize that it's worth it and order another glass of wine!! People complain about the food but it's a pizza place! For crying out loud... It's a pizza not the Mona Lisa!  The prices are standard for the city.  Over all, I've heard some negative things about this place... That it's a tourist trap or whatever but I've been here since I was a kid and even been here recently and it's really not. Idk maybe those ppl are trying to deter tourists from coming bc the wait can get pretty long. P.S. they don't take credit card or reservations... Bc they don't have to.

We split the Italian festa salad, bread, and a pizza pot pie.  It was all delicious, but I think that the salad and the bread actually out-did the pizza pot pie, which is impressive, because the pie was really good.  The salad was just enormous with all kinds of flavorful toppings, and then the bread is unbelievably good.

2014-07-10,4.0,"Since I put up photos on Yelp before writing my reviews, Yelp nags me to write the next one, even ""telling"" me which one to do next LOL!  So, okay, Yelp, Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder Company it is. We had been here on our previous trip to Chicago which was 8 years ago but I wasn't Yelping back then.  That said, we really enjoyed our meal here and decided to visit it once again. During the week, they open for dinner at 4 p.m.  This place is very popular so unless you want to have to wait a good deal of time for a table, it's best to get here before they open.  Both times we went, we arrived before they opened and in no time there was a small line behind us. Of course, we were seated immediately.  Their seating consists mainly of booths with some being large enough to seat six.  Our waiter was prompt, friendly and efficient.  During our meal, the manager checked in on us more than once. We ordered their pizza pot pie.  Their menu describes it this way: The Pizza Pot Pie is an individual serving, ""made from scratch"" with triple-raised Sicilian bread-type dough; a homemade sauce consisting of olive oil, fresh garlic, onions, green peppers, whole plum tomatoes and a special blend of cheeses; sausage made from prime Boston butts; and doorknob-size, whole, fresh mushrooms. (Vegetarian pizza pot pie may be special ordered.) My husband ordered the default version while I got one with just cheese and tomato sauce.  These pot pies take about 25 minutes to make so the servers advise people to get an appetizer while waiting.  This time we decided to order a chef's salad which is described this way on their menu: A moderate serving of lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, green and black olives, pepperoncini, onions, artichoke hearts, and green peppers, intended for one to two adults to compliment pizza or Oven Grinders. Served with sour cream garlic, sweet and sour poppyseed, and Italian dressings We got the small size and found it to be more than adequate for 2 people.  It came out very quickly and was nicely chilled.  We both opted for the Italian dressing.  The most abundant ingredient was the iceberg lettuce. Our pizza pot pies arrived at the expected time.  They come to the table in a ceramic bowl which is turned over onto your plate.  The result is that the pot pie is served with the cheese on top.  In other words, it is baked upside down with the crust on top and the cheese on the bottom.  This pot pie comes in an 8 oz. size and a 16 oz. size.  The smaller size is quite adequate for one person. These pot pies have flaky crust and a generous amount of cheese.  The default one is chock full of meat and veggies.  My only criticism and this is minor---is that the tomato sauce is a bit on the sweet side.  Yet it's not too sweet as to be overpowering or annoying. I would advise a visit here at some point, if possible.  The pot pies are unique.  Plus there is some Chicago history right across the street from this place.  There used to be a garage where the St. Valentine's day massacre occurred on February 14, 1929.  The garage has long since been torn down, which apparently upset history buffs and a residence stands in its place.",0.9964,0.843,0.129,0.028,0.4772118136872234
2014-07-09,4.0,Second pizza stop on my tour of Chicago. We got the garlic bread which is suuuper thin and garlicy and totally overflowing off of the plate! IT WAS SO GOOD! I think the best I've had. I'd go there just for that! We also got the Pot Pie and some pizza that's kind of like a sandwich (hey I had to try everything while I was there). All I remember is everything was amazingly good but we ordered too much to finish it. I wish we had leftovers! (We brought it to a party and people ate it even though we kept it with our stuff not in the kitchen! RUDE!) DEFINITELY RECOMMEND.

2014-07-09,3.0,"The place still kicks the odd school vibe, where you think a mobster could walk in at anytime.  The story about the old place is really interesting and it's shame Chicago doesn't appreciate their mob history, cause the V-Day massacre across the street is a great piece of history.  Anyway  so back to the food.  So we ordered the Mediterranean Bread, Anti Pasta Salad, 3 pizza pot pies, and 2 rounds of Perrioni beer for the lovely total of $95. Now for that price you do get a tone of food. 1st things 1st, if you have issues with germs I wouldn't order the bread.  I am not so it's all good, but it is bigger then the plate it's served on and the ends are all over the table.  Hope they use some clean towels.  The bread was very good, but I was disappointed when I asked for a side of sauce to dip it in, they said ""No, we just don't do sauce sides""  Found that pretty odd 2nd course Anti-Pasta salad is f'g huge.  I personally wouldn't bother with the lettuce, but then again without the lettuce is most likely isn't worth the price.  Overall the Italian dressing was great and I would pour that all over the bread to be honest. Finally, the Pizza Pot Pie.  These were very interesting and honest pretty good.  Were they so good that I would go rant and rave about them, hell no, but good enough that I enjoyed them and if someone asked I would tell them to give them a try.  It was really like eating a lasagna in a bread bowl.  Didn't like the fact you couldn't get pepperoni, but that is just being picky on my part. The little chocolate candies they give you at the end were really good, would have loved them in a sundae.   The cash only part sucks, but we were prepared and honestly it makes dividing a bill so much easier.  I always try to carry cash for going to dinner with more then 2 people.  Feel bad for the servers having to divide the check to multiple cards. So overall it was a good experience, little pricey, and ok food.  I most likely wouldn't go back, unless it was someone else's suggestions, but it's a good thing to knock off the Chicago food bucket list.",0.9975,0.693,0.229,0.077,0.5412820512820514
2014-07-07,4.0,"I have been coming here since they opened in the early 70s. When it first opened it felt like a new trend, as if every pizza parlor would soon switch to this new and unusual pie: a deep dish savory pie that the sauce and meat were nearly ladled into like an Italian stew.  But no other restaurant came to the call: leaving Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder to be the ONLY deep dish soup pizza place in the World. And it has lasted for 40 years,  The salads are great. The pizza bread starter is delicious, but it will also fill you up. Save room for the actual pizza. It comes out in a deep casserole dish, And then is ladled onto your plate like a Souffle. The result is a big delicious soupy plate of pizza innards... and crusty dipping bread that are to die for. This is a great and Icon place... situated in the garden/basement of an apartment building on Lincoln Ave. The funny thing is... when I was a little boy, this very spot was a little Japanese lunch booth,  that served a sushi and teriyaki lunch plates; only to go.

2014-06-22,2.0,"This place is so-so. Seems like it has a gimmick of pizza pot pie but it's nothing special in flavor. Not sure why Rachel Rah would highlight this place. The worst part is that there are no reservations and the guy that seats people doesn't take names and supposedly remembers your face, but for us a 45 minute wait turned into an hour and fifteen minutes and though we were a group of four, he sat a couple of groups of six before us and said he only had larger tables open. But if I am there first I should be seated ahead of those groups within reason, in my opinion. Lastly, in this year 2014 where we can pay cabs and street parking with credit cards and phone apps, it is ridiculous that this place is cash only. I sympathize with waiters and waitresses that want to lower their taxable income claimed but as a business, this is shady and woefully behind the times. At least have the courtesy to put a noticeable sign on the front of you restaurant that says cash only or have an ATM available inside your business instead of inconveniencing patrons at the end of their dinner by finally noting that you are cash only and one must walk a few blocks in the muggy heat, rain or freezing cold to get cash because you are cheap.",-0.8907,0.831,0.064,0.106,0.6945389266817839

The salad dressing was baller, the bread was like an amazing flat garlic bread, and the pizzas were perfectly salty and delicious.  I'm not a big pizza fan, personally, but it was exceptional.  I heard the people in the booth next to us saying it was better than Giordianos or Ginos.   Portion Size:  The portion sizes are so big, I almost counted it as a negative!

Don't forget to bring cash- no cards here. We started with the Mediterranean bread- a sort of large flatbread, dusted with seasonings. Super good as a share-able appetizer.  The four of us almost finished it, but wanted to leave room for our entrees. I had a grinder, since I wasn't super hungry and thought it would be smaller than the massive-sounding pizzas.  Wrong.  It was huge.  I mean, big, and stuffed.  But sadly, not all that great.  Not enough seasoning, waaaay too much cheese.  Great bread though.  Only a couple of kinds of meat, neither of which was very tasty.  And oddly for an Italian sub, no pepperoni.  In fact, hardly any pepperoni on the menu, anywhere.  Can't get it in the pizzas.  (You can add it as a side; it comes on a little plate.)  One of the salads has some in it.  Weird.  Anyway, the grinder came with lightly roasted peppers on the side; kinda nice. My sandwich, though one of their specialties, just didn't do much for me.  I tried the pizza pot pies, and man, I wished I'd gotten one.  An unusual take on pizza, they come out upside down and the waiter flips them and removes a little bowl they're baked in/on.  It really is a pizza pot pie- the dough is excellent and the fillings were tasty, especially after Sweetie added some pepperoni to hers.  I was jealous.  Everyone else got one; each got the 1/2 pounder, which was a good size for one person.  The pounder would be good for a starving person.

Cozy rustic interior decorated in wood paneling and reminds me of the old school Italian joints I used to frequent in Philadelphia when I lived there.  We went mid-afternoon on a Saturday and the place was jammed. The good news was were were told it would be 25-30 minutes and it was more like 10 so the staff seems to overestimate the wait time. There is a small bar you can wait at and they have a few beers on tap (nothing special) and some local bottles like Goose Island as well as a wines by the glass list and full bar. The food is hearty so order carefully! My wife and I shared a meatball grinder and a pizza pot pie. We were more than full even though we ""only"" ordered one sandwich and the small pizza pot pie. The sandwich was good served on a toasted garlic bread and served with lots of cheese and green peppers on it. Quite messy and tasty. The pizza pot pie was very cool and came served in a bowl, flipped upside down by the staff and presented. Very unique and also tasty.  If you remember nothing else about my review, remember this: CASH ONLY. Yup, had just enough to pay the check and leave a tip. Wow, that was a shocker but I guess if you're as popular as this place, you can get away with it. Next time we go I might be more inclined to share a grinder and that's it.

The wait time just means its THAT good. I love to start with the Chef's salad and Mediterranean bread. Both are served family style (and its an all out war in my family for that bread!). Make sure to mix both dressings and sprinkle on the seasoning for the salad. Everything they offer is delicious. My favorite dinner items are the pizza pot pie (half pounder, white crust, no mushrooms, with meat sauce) or the italian sausage oven grinder. You will leave the restaurant very very full.

Loved it! The salad was huge but it was made of iceberg lettuce. I like a better lettuce mix but it was ok.  I would come back for sure as a special treat to bring friends. It was different and it was fun. I must add that the pop does NOT have refills free. The reason for this is that they do not have pop from a fountain. The pop comes from a can.

NOW, i must admit that I no longer do the 2 hour plus wait on Fridays and Saturdays anymore - too old for that!  But I used to stand there like everyone else just to get that garlic salad dressing on my chef salad; that Mediterranean flat bread and pizza!!

As Andy Griffith might have said, ""What it was, was a pizza pot pie..."" Yep, that's probably everyone's first response when they open the two-page menu that features just one pizza-""like"" offering - in ""half-pounder"" and ""one-pounder"" sizes- and a handful of hot sandwiches, known here as ""grinders"".  Since 1972, this place has been serving what I would call an ""inverted pizza""; a steaming, bubbling caldron of pizza ingredients-in-a-cup, brought tableside on ceramic plates dating to the Paleolithic Era, and masterfully flipped by the waiter into a bowl of dense dough. Billed as ""made from scratch"", this pizza-in-a-bread bowl features a chewy dough and mild tomato sauce seasoned with olive oil, fresh garlic, onions and green peppers. The pot pie, once turned upside down, is capped with a thick cheese covering that requires deft knife skills to pry open. A ""half-pounder"" is certainly enough for the average person, especially when you trick it out with the only two options offered; sausage and/or mushrooms. Sorry, no pepperoni, sausage or anchovies - kinda like ketchup on a Chicago hot dog, so don't even ask. And at $11.75 a bowl, it's a deal - the full-pounder is priced at $23.50. The grinder sandwiches are also massive, arriving on 10-inch loaves of crusty bread and packed, tip-to-tail with filling options including; Italian ham, meatballs, sausage and, my favorite, The Vegetarian which arrives by fork lift and is loaded with onions, olives, mushrooms, red and green peppers, Romano cheese, garlic oil and spices, all topped with a massive brick of melty Swiss cheese and bubbling tomato sauce. Cut it once, cut it twice, this is a cuppa-two, or tree person sandwich. Also worth noting are their humongous salads which are truly the size of newborn infants. You can easily feed four adults, or an entire pee-wee soccer team, with just one of these tomato-wrapped cornucopias of veggies and meat. Choose from the Country French, the Classic Greek and the Great American, from $13- $25. The place is almost always packed after 5pm, and the traffic pattern is very dis-feng shui - basically a one-way route down a long and narrow, 1970's wood-sided corridor of booths to the left and larger tables to the right.

2014-01-09,4.0,"A very unique and interesting standout in the Chicago land of pizza joints.  When you say it out loud...""Pizza Pot Pie"", it doesn't sound super appetizing (or maybe it does?).  But my goodness, there is a reason Chicago Pizza & Oven Grinder pretty much has a long wait on any given evening in any given weather. My husband and I went with some friends during the blizzard on New Years Day, and found that even with a blizzard there was a 15 minute wait (which is apparently the shortest wait you'll ever see).  We grabbed a beer at the bar and were seated a few minutes later.  This place has the perfect atmosphere for a local Chicago gem - divey but clean, simple but cozy, service that is friendly and gruff at the same time, and an aroma that makes you hungry even if you were full when you walked inside. We ordered the Mediterranean Bread in whole wheat, a chef's salad for the table, and each got individual half pound pies.  CP&OG gives a whole new meaning to calling a pizza a pie.  But first, the appetizers.  Oh my.  The Mediterranean bread is a gigantic, falling off the plate, thin circle of floppy flat bread with the most amazing seasoning in the world on it.  It was the oddest thing, and yet, we ate every bite of it.  One order was perfect for a table of 4.  The salads are huge and their homemade dressings are worth ordering the salad just to try them.  CP&OG has an in-house seasoning that they offer each table that pretty much goes great on everything you can order there.  I doused the bread, salad, and pie in it. The pot pies came out a bit later and were delicious.  It's like a calzone, only totally different.  Do I like it better than Pequod's or Piece?  Well, no.  But was it the most unique and amazing pizza experience I've had in a while?  Absolutely.  The crust was perfectly soft with the right amount of crisp, and not annoyingly flaky at all (I hate when pot pie crust flakes everywhere).  The cheese, sauce, and veggies (I got vegetarian) were fantastically blended inside and piping hot.  The whole wheat tastes just as good as the white bread, but let's be honest - this is not a healthy meal regardless of which bread type you choose.  Who cares?  It's delicious.  To be honest, I'm not sure if I enjoyed the pot pie or the appetizers more.  I'd be happy to go back just to eat the Mediterranean bread and drink of a bowl of their salad dressings.  If you're getting the apps, a half pounder is perfect for someone with a larger appetite.  I think my husband and I could have split one after the salad and bread and been perfectly fine.  I ended up taking 2/3rds of my pie home and it tasted almost as delicious the next day. It's not a 5 star for me because I still prefer a solid pizza to pot pie and wish they had that option as well (their sauce is amazing).  Also, on a snowy day, the floors were horrendously slippery and as an insurance professional all I saw was a liability claim waiting to happen.  Invest in some floor mats! This place is worth the wait.  Or just wait for the next blizzard and go then.",0.9988,0.757,0.202,0.042,0.5472111592111591

However, they only take cash, they won't serve food at the bar, they're quite small, and whatever those things are that they call pizza are really disappointing.

As the cheese slowly congealed & fell off, the sauce tasted like a pasta belonged there & I was in heaven.  What's in a pizza pot pie you ask? Well it's quite simple, you bake your pizza upside down, in a porcelain bowl. Cheese on the bottom, sauce & some gooey bread on top.

In the past I have had their amazing salad dressing, and believe me when I say, no other dressing beats CPOG's.  My husband and I came here one night at around 10:00pm and it was still quite busy. The restaurant is in the lower level of a brownstone, so you can imagine how cramped it feels. That aside, the atmosphere was still pretty enjoyable for the most part. All of the staff was very friendly and attentive, which was awesome given the crowded environment. The food was delicious. We had salad, the mediterrannean bread, and one of their famous deep dish pizzas. Now I will say that I am not a fan of Chicago style deep dish pizza, and have been dragged to many well known pizza places in the city and have been dissappointed by the lasagna-esque dish that is Chicago style deep dish pizza. CPOG hands down has the best deep dish pizza I've ever had, it was absolutely delicious. Of course the salad was delicious as well, being that they serve it with their amazing dressings. The mediterannean bread was way too overpowering with parmesean cheese and whatever else spices they put on it.  The only thing that I really don't appreciate about this restaurant is the fact that they only accept cash. Most people do not just carry around cash, and if you are planning on dining at this restaurant you will need a lot of it. The prices are moderately high so prepare yourself to stop by an atm machine beforehand and stock up on some bills. This place also does not take reservations, I personally don't mind this, but this is important to a lot of people.",0.9548,0.875,0.096,0.03,0.6415134099616859

As long as you come prepared, CPOG being a cash-only establishment should be but a minor annoyance.  We rolled in at 1PM on a Saturday, so our wait was relatively short.  I really enjoyed the coziness of this place, as well as my half-pound pizza pot pie (wheat crust, meat sauce and mushrooms), which left me fully satisfied as opposed to uncomfortably full.",0.9037,0.807,0.143,0.05,0.47333333333333333

Mediterranean bread which is bigger than the plate & good with the spices the serve with it. And of course...3.) The pizza pot pie! & As one would expect, it is always AMAZING! The portions are crazy huge too. No way can you leave this place hungry. However, good things come to those who wait. No joke. Every time I have come here, I usually wait about an hour.

The service...meh.  I mean this place is constantly slammed so expect to see your server like once, maybe twice.  You will have to get their attention for water, more drinks, etc. The pizza is unimpressive for me.  We got the traditional upside down pizza.  We opted for the small size, which is ridiculously priced.  The sauce is lacking in flavor as is the meat.  Its just hamburger in there...it didnt even have any flavor.  Honestly, it seemed like an expensive imitation for Chicago pizza.  I feel bad for people that think this place is good. Yes, I like the little upside down pizza, but the little trick of watching them flip it over isnt that exciting if the pizza isnt that good.

2013-09-04,4.0,"This place has an interesting backstory...combine that with the overall Yelp love and appearance on the Food Network, I had to stop by for a last supper before flying back home to New York. The age-old decision here seems to be: pizza pot pie vs. grinder.  While I've had plenty of grinders back home, the pot pie seemed unique.  The waiter recommended that to me as a first time visitor so I dove right in...I ordered it with meat sauce, on white dough, and with mushrooms - the ""default"" way they provide it. During the 30-minute prep time for the pizza pot pie, I ordered the Mediterranean bread, which came served sagging over the sides of a dinky plate and covered with some dry spices.  After reading all the hype (both on Yelp and even on their own menu), I was unimpressed.  Trying to make do, I asked for some of the tasty-sounding salad dressings to dip the otherwise dry bread into and they insisted that they only offer that for patrons who actually order the salad.  With a pot pie on its way out, there was no way I was ordering a third dish, so they offered to take it back and remove it from the check.  I'd have been just as happy finishing (and paying for) it with the sauces, but I guess they have their rules.  Still surprised that they'd rather eat the cost of the appetizer than just give me a cup of sauce that's otherwise free anyway, but I digress. On to the pizza pot pie - WOW!  It came out upside-down, and the server flipped mine over and ""popped"" it from the ceramic bowl on which this creation was resting.  I was treated to a gooey haven of cheese, rich sauce, and chunky 'shrooms mixed in a super-soft layer of puffy pizza dough.  This entree was a piping-hot and flavorful dream come true, and quite possibly one of the most interesting things I've eaten. Pics: yelp.com/biz_photos/chic… yelp.com/biz_photos/chic… Ambiance is dark and cozy, with rich wood high-walled booths providing plenty of privacy for your party.  If you're hanging around by Lincoln Park (zoo, beaches, Chicago History Museum), you'd be hard-pressed to find a cooler place to enjoy their spin on Chicago's famous ""deep dish"" pizza.  Just make sure you get their outside of peak dining hours, and bring some cash for the check!",0.9947,0.856,0.132,0.012,0.5244207952541287

The wait was about 20 minutes, so nothing too bad. The host seemed like the real deal - a small, older Italian man who doesn't bother to take people's names, only operating on memory. He looks like he's been doing this for a very long time, so I trusted he knew what he was doing. I really liked the interior of this restaurant. A low-ceiling, dimly lit place with rich, dark wooden booths. Like the host, it felt like the real deal. Despite the crowd, we didn't feel crowded when sitting at a booth. Charming place. The food: wow, I've never been so disappointed, especially with my expectations so built up. A few comments about the food: Cobb Salad - mediocre iceberg lettuce, minimal toppings. They basically give you a football of whitish-green lettuce. The dressings are house-made and actually pretty good, though the sweeter dressing was way too sweet. Mediterranean Bread - their most popular item, apparently. A large, thin piece of what I think is pizza dough, with toppings like Italian herbs/spices (seemingly dried and from a jar) and parmesan falling off the bread and all over the place. More oil or butter might have helped so that the toppings stick. We found this bread only okay. Meatball Oven Grinder - a monster of a grinder. Way too little red sauce. Meatballs were way too dry. Bread wasn't very interesting - for an oven-baked grinder, the bread didn't have that nice crunch that I expect oven-baked bread to have. This was not good at all. Service - pretty great. Very attentive server. They seem to run an extremely efficient operation, which is admirable. This restaurant seems like a great place to take a family, as all of the dishes are immensely sharable. My main gripe is that the food just wasn't very good. We didn't try the pizza pot pie, so maybe we missed the best item, so we may try going back sometime to give the place another chance. My expectations are no longer high, however.

But, I love it too much to be anything but honest about how great it is. My parents have been going here for over 35 years, and my dad said the first time he came here, he ordered a ""thin crust with sausage."" They said, ""You haven't been here before, have you?"" It's not your ""normal"" pizza place. And, while it's called ""Chicago Pizza & Oven Grinders"" I know I've never ordered a grinder. I have seen this mystical creature floating about to other tables, but it never lands on ours. As my parents have been coming here forever, I, in turn, have been coming here since I was a child. I think we order the exact same thing every time. Mediterranean bread - white (though the wheat is fantastic too if you're with people who will eat wheat bread). This is a huge (overflows the platter) piece of bread (like a pizza crust) that's baked with olive oil and spices on top. You pull it apart with your hands. Get over it. Chef's Salad - small (don't let it fool you, it's not small at all, and comfortably feeds 3 adults). Iceberg lettuce covered in green pepper and onion slices, artichoke hearts, olives, pepperocinis, and it comes with awesome dressing (poppyseed something spectacular, and creamy something or other. My mom swears by mixing the two. I swear by licking the poppyseed spoon.) Pizza: I go with the 1/2 pound wheat no meat with mushrooms. Here, you get 8 pizza options: 1/2 or whole pound, white or wheat, meat or no meat, mushrooms or no mushrooms. Do whatever you want, but unless you haven't eaten in a week, you should probably order the 1/2 pound. As I'm sure everyone else has said, it comes out looking like a mushroom cap in a bowl, and they dig it out of the bowl and flip it over for you. Um yes, magnificent! In addition, it's CASH ONLY. So be prepared. Also, they don't take names. And, if you walk in and put your name on the ""list"" (it's all by memory, folks), you'd better not leave or change what you're wearing (removal of jacket, etc.) because they remember you by your clothes and they will forget you if you aren't sticking around. You can leave but be prepared to be back on the list at the end when you come back. If you want a less crowded experience, go when they open or go at lunch.  It's ABSOLUTELY worth it.

2013-07-25,3.0,"The manfriend is such a pizza lover that he was really psyched to try this place, and managed to get me excited too. Of course, I was just excited in general because he and I had the rare opportunity to have a weekday date night in the city! We were aware of the cash only policy and came prepared. There weren't many people waiting when we arrived, so I was hopeful, but the same thing happened to us as did to Rod C. We were told 15 minutes, and told the gentleman that we would wait at the bar, but watched as people who arrived after us were seated before us. We had to remind him, when he tried to seat the couple next to us (who arrived 5-10 minutes after us) that we were there before them. He said ""ok, ok"" and pointed us to the open table instead of walking us over. I can't imagine what a nightmare this is when it is a 2 hour wait on Friday or Saturday. Whatever. Luckily, our server (Brad?) made up for the host's lack of hospitality. He explained drink options to us in depth (get a bottle of wine if you are going to have more than 3 glasses - they let you cork it and take it home) and then went through each of the sections of the menu and explained what would or would not be enough food for each of us. We ended up with the Mediterranean Bread and a 1/2 pound pizza pot pie for each of us.  Mediterranean Bread = phenomenal. Huge. Kinda weird that they don't try for a bigger plate to fit it all? If you're concerned about germs, better skip this one or hope the table's clean. My pizza pot pie was fine - mushrooms, sausage, and wheat crust. I had a few deals with the pizza: the mushrooms are whole, so I ended up with 3 bites that had mushrooms and no others; the sausage tasted like ground beef without a lot of flavor; and the pizza wasn't very seasoned in and of itself - I added the seasoning at the table to give it a little oomph.  I wanted to love it, but couldn't get there. The manfriend was a fan, so I know we'll be back. I'll make a mental note to try the grinder next time, and we'll definitely be back on another weekday to avoid the confusion with the host.",0.9909,0.843,0.127,0.03,0.4686274509803921
2013-07-18,1.0,"My wife and I have been ""aware"" of the famous pizza pot pie for about 5 or 6 years, ever since seeing it on the Travel Channel and/or Food Network. We have seen it shown multiple times on various shows over the years, and we have always said we have to try it if we ever find our way to Chicago. Well last week we made it to Chicago, and so our obvious dinner choice was the pizza pot pie from Chicago Pizza & Oven Grinder. I wanted to give them 5 stars, but I'll explain where all the stars went... - Minus one star because of the horrendous wait times, the unwillingness to take reservations, and the oaf running the joint who refuses to keep a documented list of parties waiting for tables. I asked, ""don't you want to take my name?"" He replied, ""no, I can remember everyone's faces and I know who's next"". Fair enough... except he kept my party waiting while he allowed several other parties to bypass us in line for tables. When I challenged him on it, he apologized and said we would be next... and then he promptly seated two more parties who were behind us in line. Our total wait was over 1 hour, which wouldn't have been so bad except for the fact that 25 other people were standing in the waiting area with their rear ends in our faces while we sat down to wait. - Minus one star because the food is grossly overpriced for what it is. We spent $46 on a couple of pizza pot pies and a couple of sodas. It was just enough for two people. And this isn't gourmet food. I'd probably comfortably pay about $20 for what we ate. That's what it was worth. - Minus one star because you have to pay for refills on sodas. $3 gets you a tiny glass of soda and each refill is another $2. Who does that? - Minus one star because this place only accepts cash. Really? Not even VISA? I was only carrying enough cash to cover the food and one drink each, so the waiter went without a tip and I couldn't even afford to pay for the refill that I really wanted. - Minus one star because the oaf of an owner kept rushing us to finish eating and clear the table so he could seat another party. He stared at us throughout our meal, and kept walking by our table grunting about the fact that we were not done eating yet. So that's 5 stars minus 5 stars = 0 stars.

2013-07-18,4.0,The food here is definitely worth the long wait. I made a solo trip here on a Friday night around 8.30 pm and still had to wait around 40 minutes. It's ok since I wasn't in a hurry. The Chicago pot pie lives up to its fame. Melting hot cheese and super tasty pork sausage tomato sauce were poured upside down from the ceramic bowl covered by bread. I was told the meat sauce is cooked for over 5 1/2 hours every day. This is why it's so tasty. I do not eat beef. I didn't believe this is actually pork sausage because the sauce is so gooood. Order a chef salad for appetizer is a great way to start the meal. The vegetables are fresh and crisp.  I left the restaurant very happily. It's definitely a great meal. I finished everything I ordered including 2 bottles of Matilda (Goose Island Belgian Pale ale). Cash only.,0.9829,0.809,0.191,0.0,0.4644444444444444

This is where my expectations and service was met ended. The server, couldn't tell you his name came and asked we wanted to drink. Three asked for diet cokes and immediately we were told not nice, twice but after each person said that they wanted a pop that there would be a charge for a refill. Our company forgot there cash and we had enough and said dont worry about it. It prevented one of guests from ordering it. Then we ordered the chef's salad and the med bread. This is where my gag reflex was put to the test. 50% of the bread hung over the plate and laid on the table. Ack. How clean is it? Who knows. The salad came a large oval dish and was very difficult to remove anything from unless you love to see olives and peppers go flying. The artichokes, I did not taste , but two said weren't fresh. I will take their word for it. The server who repeatedly told us about the extra drink costs, wanted to save us money. We must have looked needy and didn't want to bring the refills back! Oh wait he did hater I asked the third time. The pizza, I remembered it as being better. The cheese was flavorful, the sauce used with it was bland and if there was sausage in it. Please tell the scouts to tell me where I didn't see any. The booths are very cramped and if you are larger in which I am, you are tight. Tight enough for when they bring a hot plate I could have any foreign objects in my face brought to the surface from the heat. So.  W are sitting talking.

The chef's salad is mostly lettuce but it just goes to show how tasty lettuce can be when topped with amazing salad dressing. The dressing is also a perfect dipping sauce for the awesome Mediterranean bread. Seriously, this bread is out of this world.

2013-02-15,5.0,"I have been here too many times to count. My boyfriend and I have gone 3-5 times a year for the past 5 years.  We actually had our first date here so it is tough for me to give this place an unbiased review because of sentimental value.  I'm vegetarian and he's a meat and salad lover. Both of us are fat people suck in skinny people's bodies. To say we love food is an understatement. It's hard for us to agree on any place for a date night. This is a perfect compromise. If we lived closer to LP, I'm sure we'd frequent Chicago Pizza & Oven Grinder more. I have to admit that I always forget how good it is. That's why I felt compelled to write a review the day after going there. My thinking usually before hand is I'm not really in the mood to get something so ordinary like bread, salad, and pizza. I eat pizza almost every week and salads everyday. My boyfriend when he introduces the place to someone, never tells them that it's the bread & salad that wins your heart. That's what honestly makes this place different from all the pizza places in Chicago. Another unique thing is that the deep dish pizza is really a pizza pot pie. When I'm done, I'm so incredibly full and satisfied with the meal. The mediterrean bread is amazing. They offer it in white and wheat. We always order it with a small chef's salad (which is actually quite large, but perfect for 2 salad lovers). The salad dressing mixed is mind-blowing so we like to dip the bread in it.  We usually only get through about half or a lttle more than half of the bread. We both get a 1/2 lb pizza pot pie (mine vegetarian, his original) which is also delicious. I'm more messy than my boyfirend with the sauce so I like to dip the rest of the sauce from the pizza with more bread. At the end, we always order extra salad dressings (usually two sets) to go. They don't last long. Only cons: No reservations. Only cash. Parking is usually impossible so you're better from getting valet ($8).

2013-01-16,3.0,"Remember that time you really wanted something exclusive... saved up your money... braved the long lines... and finally made a plan to get it only to feel... BUYER'S REMORSE. I know there is no way to physically 'return' my experience at CPOG, but overall, it was just meh. To knock this off my Chicago Bucket List took strategic planning: get to the restaurant at 5:30PM on a Wednesday night and hope for the best.  Turns out that, even at 5:30PM, the place is still packed and we were told the wait would be 20 minutes.  We ordered a couple glasses of wine at the bar.  Heavy pour on the red, but cork was floating everywhere.  In the spirit of Christmas, I did not send it back.  I just considered the cork my extra bonus. Strike two came when the host took us to our booth, which was conveniently located next to 3 women and their 4 loud, screaming children under the age of 8 who broke two glasses within 5 minutes of us sitting down.  For a minute, I felt really bad for the one woman; you could tell she was really cool at one point in her life, had a lot of really cool friends, and was probably president of her sorority in college, and is now stuck piling these unruly children in her Range Rover every time she wants to enjoy a glass of wine and a meal cooked by someone else.  Note to self: no kids until I tire of booze. Our waitress was super cheery and very helpful with the menu.  We ordered a ""small"" chef's salad to start.  Totally huge, way too many onions (bad breath, anyone?!) and honestly, unnecessary.  It came out with a trio of Italian, garlic, and sweet and sour dressing.  This could have easily fed 3 people for a meal and made finishing everything else much more difficult. Next came the Mediterranean bread.  Honestly, it was the best part of the meal.  It reminded me of an elephant ear from a carnival but with salty delicious seasonings.  I was slightly appalled at first that it hung all over the table when we were eating, but I put faith in the staff that our table was clean.  I would suggest dipping it in the Italian or sweet and sour dressing, but to do that, you HAVE to order a salad if you want the dressing to dip the bread in.  Scam?  Yes.  We ate about 3/4 of it and took the rest home; I wish we would have taken a whole one to go. The oh-so-famous pizza pot pies arrived next.  We both went with wheat crust (!) and the meat sauce, mine sans mushrooms.  It was just...OK.  Cool concept: dump a bunch of cheese and tomato sauce in a bowl, spread dough over it, bake it, flop it over on a plate, and VOILA!, here is a pizza pot pie.  However, I just was not impressed.  The crust was tough to cut through, and everything didn't really stay together, so I was essentially eating crust, then eating cheese, then scooping up sauce.  If the sauce were more meaty, less saucy, it may have held together better.  It was really just a mess.  And on top of that, it's not cheap.  Minus wine, we ended up with a tab of around $45 for two, no leftovers.  I left feeling, ""Gourmet?  My 3-year-old niece could have made her own rendition in her Little Tikes kitchen."" ...which is what I will do.  Before I ever come back, I will just be domestic and try to mimic the recipe at home, but with more meat, more cheese, less sauce.  It's beyond me that people are known to wait hours to try this place, but I'm glad I finally tried it.",0.9965,0.759,0.161,0.08,0.47087071543593284

We did have bar service, so we finished around 3 beers a piece as we waited. The second experience required no waiting. We went for lunch on a Friday during the holidays (they aren't normally open for lunch then) and we were seated right away. As we were leaving though, we could see there was a considerable wait. The servers are all very nice. Ours were attentive, and the other waitstaff always were around to clear our plates, fill our waters, or bring us boxes. Out waiter was especially cheery and checked on us many times to see if we needed anything. On to the food. Definitely start with the Mediterranean bread. It's basically a large piece of cooked pizza dough covered in oil and spices. We put added cheese, red pepper flakes, and the special seasoning on ours. You can get the bread in white or wheat. Of course, we got the pizza pot pies. The half pound is certainly enough if you've had an appetizer. I ended up taking have of my pot pie home.

They also seated a large group of women in a long table next to our booth. There were about 12 women stuffed into a table that should have seated 8. We heard the waitress tell them that when one of the tables on either side of them got up, they could take over that table. Well since the booth on the other side of the women had just sat down, that meant when OUR table was done they could take it over. From that point on, we felt uncomfortably rushed. The women were clearly uncomfortable and kept talking about how cramped they were and how it would be OK because the table over there (our table) was almost done. Maybe it's a bit picky, but I think they should have waited to seat the women until they had the proper amount of space so that we didn't have them looking over our shoulder in anticipation while we finished our dinner.

I loved everything about this place (except cash only). I didn't know that, but good thing there is an ATM down the street from Chicago Pizza. We waited for about 30 minutes on a late evening Sunday night, so I can imagine how long these waits can get during early dinner hours. But honestly, it was so worth it.

2012-12-04,5.0,"I've been going to the Chicago Pizza & Oven Grinder Co for almost 10 years now! My friends and I refer to this place as ""The upside-down pizza place"", since the ""pizza pot pies"" cook upside down in a small bowl. The pizza is to die for. I usually get the vegetarian, half pound pizza with mushrooms. The mushrooms are full, large mushrooms, and the cheese and sauce is gooey and delicious.  I seriously eat so much every time I go here. Aside from the upside-down pizza, the Mediterranean bread is a must have. We also always get the house salad, which is delicious if you mix the poppyseed & garlic dressing together.  The only downsides to this place is that they don't take reservations and since it's a small place, there's usually a long wait and not much room at the bar. Also, they only take cash, which is a pain for someone who never carries it.

2012-12-03,4.0,"Here are the problems I have with this place: 1. The host goes by faces and not names. This may impress some people but I think it is stupid. Considering how long the average wait is here, it'd be SO nice to be able to put our name in and go to a nearby bar for an hour - hour and a half and then come back and be ready to be seated. 2. Giant menus with large fonts. This is just not smart seeing as their actual menu is quite small and it takes up all your table space. 3. The restaurant is tiny and they do not have good seating for odd party sizes. One time I went as a party of 5 and we got seated at a regular booth meant for 4. Two sat comfortably on one side while 3 sat uncomfortably on the other. I got an arm cramp just trying to use my knife and fork and constantly bumped elbows with the person next to me and the booth wall. 4. This isn't Chicago style pizza, don't expect it to be. It's more of an upside down pizza pot pie. 5. Cash only. It's 2012, just buy a credit card machine and stop lying on your taxes. You aren't some small mom and pop restaurant. You can afford it. The good parts of the restaurant are that the food is very tasty and comes in large portions. All the salads and grinders are gigantic, and the salads are great for sharing. The Mediterranean bread is also great for sharing since it is a finger food and it is quite original and delicious and what I would recommend the most off their menu. They do home made salad dressings which are also quite good and mix well with each other. Service is friendly and pretty fast considering that the place is always packed.",0.989,0.731,0.177,0.092,0.5369438965592814

Right after we sat down, the waiter served us right away, gave us menu, and explained the items on the menu for us. When we told him to give us a lil time to think about it, he came back like 5 mins after, which was perfect, because I hate when they come back too soon or take too long to come back. Love the enthuism of the ppl who work there, awesome service (besides the hostess) The Mediterranean bread wasn't that good, it just looks cool.

2012-11-07,5.0,"We were looking for a place to eat before our Musical, and some one in our group suggested Chicago Pizza & Oven Grinder. I am always up for pizza! The musical started at 7:30 and we read that the restaurant gets crowded fast so to come early. We ended up showing up at about 5, and Im REALLY glad we did. The restaurant is pretty small, and most of the tables can only fit 4 people(we made it fit 5). There were a few people waiting for tables already at 5...yikes. While we were waiting I went to the bathroom, which in a one person room...so be ready to wait for a bit...there is a steady line for it.  We got our table after a 15 minute wait, not to bad I thought.Our waiter was fast and friendly, he took our drink order right away and knew what beers they had. I ordered an Angry Orchard, my sister got a Stella and the rest of the table drank iced tea( You do not get free refills on pop). We also ordered the mediterranean bread to start us off. As I was looking around the restaurant I noticed that EVERY table had it, so it HAD to be good. It came out right after our drinks, super hot and amazing. It was a huge flat bread with seasoning on it that feed all five of us and I swear that could have been my meal. They even brought out extra seasoning if you wanted to add some. For dinner we all ordered the half pound pizza pot pie, you can order with or without mushrooms. I ordered mine with mushrooms and Im glad I did, they were whole mushrooms in the sauce/cheese goodness that added a lot of flavor to the pizza pie. The pizza pie was huge and after eating the mediterranean bread I could not finish it. I took the rest home, and actually ended up eating it cold, which was just as good as it was hot!!  After leftovers were boxed and our bill was paid(cash only) we were leaving to head for our musical and the line was out the door waiting for a table to eat. This was at 6:30.

2012-10-23,4.0,"4 stars: Yay! I'm a fan. First things first: Cash only - Support your local money launderer. No reservations - Go early/late or prepare to wait. Start with the mediterranean bread. Its presentation is kind of unhygienic, given that the plate it is served on is about 60% of the size of the bread and the table isn't exactly the cleanest, and I'm not 100% sure I know what solution the busboy used to wipe down the table with that rag.... But other than that, it's nice and chewy. Garlicky and crisp on the edges. Cheesy and doughy in just the right way. It splits nicely 3 ways - It's almost too big for a party of 2, and not big enough for a party of four. Pizza pot pies are kind of a misnomer. They are more like pizza casseroles because the bottom side is actually cheese. It's not like an entire pizza is inside a pie crust or anything like that. The cheese doesn't get any kind of caramelization on it, so don't expect a golden brown, chewy-cheesy crust. The actual crust comes either plain or wheat. Both are good. Plain is a bit better. The sausage isn't encased. This isn't a problem. The sausage is delicious. The sauce is pretty awesome. I don't care if they use Prego, or whatever. It's awesome. Ask for it with mushrooms and you'll get one or two uncut mushrooms inside your casserole, if it's a half-pounder.  Veggie comes with mushrooms by default.  An ambitious person can easily eat 1.5 half-pounders after having a reasonable amount of mediterranean bread and still have room for dessert.  Speaking of dessert: the Tortoni is alright, but not rave-worthy. It's pretty much an almond-y, coconut-y ice cream. There is some freezer burn issues with the consistency, so it's got too much water in it and not enough cream to really be a technically well-executed dessert.  While this place may seem like a novelty pizza spot, just based on the somewhat misleadingly named ""pizza pot pie,"" it's really an excellent pizza on its own merits and flavor.  The crusts are delicious, the sauce is great, the sausage is excellent and distinctive, and the cheese is nice and gooey. It's good pizza - plain and simple.

This time my brother and I went with the pot pie, not very big. Dont get me wrong it was very tasty, but the price vs what you get wasnt there for me. We also had their great Mediterranean bread that was very good, we took some home with us as well. We washed it all down with Matilda beer from Goose Island. Overall the food was good, fulfilling but not overpriced (afterall you are in a very trendy area so its expected) Ok for the bad part: The service. We were greeting a middle aged man who pointed us to the bar. Since there was only two of us, I asked if we could eat at the bar. He just response again, please wait at the bar. Never acknowledged my questions or responded to it. I am not a kid, all I asked was if I could eat at the bar, many many places allow you to do that, so that put me off.

There is always a wait of at least 30 mins, but it's totally worth it. I would definitely recommend ordering the meditteranean bread and/or house salad as a starter- their homemade dressings are awesome. Then of course, follow it up with a 1/2 pounder pot pie pizza. Everything about it- the melty cheese, the huge mushrooms, the meaty sauce and the DELICIOUS crust make this the best pizza I've ever had. I don't even care about Lou or Gino, those relationships are over. The atmosphere is really cool too- dark and cozy. Located right across the street from the scene of the Valentine's day massacre. But now the only thing being massacered on that street is pizza pot pies... heeyyyooo",0.9888,0.751,0.229,0.021,0.6027472527472527
2012-07-18,4.0,"I was visiting Chicago for a week, and I ended up eating at this place twice for dinner while I was there. It's located in Lincoln Park right near the zoo and park.  The pizza pies are one of a kind and the bread is amazing. The pizza looks similar to a pot pie, however once they serve it to you, they turn it upside down and the breaded crust surrounds the meat sauce like a bowl. The bread is amazing too, and could act as a meal in itself. The food is very filling and family sized portions, so I suggest coming with an appetite. The atmosphere of this place is very cozy, with raised booths and tables. It's a cash only restaurant that doesn't take reservations. While you wait, they have a bar area, which is small as well, and when crowded is very cramped. Make sure to get there early or to avoid weekend nights, since it's a small place that fills up fast.  I would definitely recommend this place to someone that wants something a little different than the typical Chicago pizza.",0.9646,0.864,0.124,0.012,0.5565948601662887
2012-07-17,2.0,"There are a few things I try to avoid in my reviews.  One is ""the wait"".  To me it is actually a badge of honor that a restaurant is so good that there is a long wait (but caution, it can also mean that it is a highly trendy, touristy place that no one in line has actually ever been to). Another is down-rating a place because of the ""service"".  First off, I've seen some really rude customers and believe the service they get is often a reflection of how they treat the servers.  And sometimes seemingly bad service is part of the shtick of a restaurant.  If I sense that neither of the above apply and the service is truly bad, I'll include that as part of my review. We found this place by driving by and saying ""doesn't that look fun""?  With no preconceived notions we parked (many blocks away) and stood in line forever.  It wasn't until we got inside that we discovered that it was cash only and we had dwindled our cash earlier and could only afford to split a large pizza. Let's define ""large"".  Let's say it's not.  It is a pot pie that is mostly crust with very little pizza ingredients inside.  It wasn't terrible, but it was far from being worth the price and it seemed more trendy than tasty. I don't recall the service being anything, neither great nor rude.  We got what we ordered, we ate it and left.  The two stars are because it is in a historic old building (you can see where Al Capone was shot outside the front window) and neither the food nor the service really sucked. Would I go back?  Probably not.  I think any place that charges FAR more than the food is worth should take credit cards.  But that's the owner's decision, not mine.  I'm sure he rakes in the cash just fine, but probably mostly from first-and-only time customers.",-0.9066,0.848,0.059,0.092,0.48125496031746035

2012-07-14,5.0,"My friend from out of town: ""Dude, what is this? This isn't pizza!"" Me: ""You're absolutely right. It's a 1/2 lb of passionate pleasure"" Goodness gracious I still don't know what the 1/2 pounder is but I know for certain one thing it is NOT, and that is any regular run-of-the-mill pizza. It comes out looking like an overflowing chicken pot pie with its love handles drooping all over the sides. But then they flip it over on your plate and shave off the container to reveal a smoking inside bundle of rich cheese and meat sauce (mind you it is hot. they tell you to let it sit for a second but the first time I was so enthralled that my hands moved on their own and . . . well . . . )  Eating through it the first time might be a bit perplexing but rest assured, your knife and fork will eventually figure it out. While this is a ""pizza place"", you'll quickly discover that the 1/2 pounder is definitely a little more non-traditional, which is aptly highlighted by the homemade sauce. This sauce reminded me more of a spaghetti meat sauce but about ten thousand times more sophisticated and tastier...and thankfully, there is a lot of it. If you generally like your pizzas with more cheese and less tomato sauce, then this may not be the experience for you but then again, this really shouldn't be treated like a pizza. While it does have many of the traditional components, it really is a different dining experience altogether so comparing it to a deep dish or regular pizza may not be the most productive. That being said, the overall 1/2 pounder is well put together. The dough crust has a nice balance of soft/fluffy and chewy which is perfectly complemented with the sauce. You may wish you had a little more dough seeing as the sauce and cheese is aplenty so if you have some change to spare, order up some Mediterranean Bread for a little dipping action. Prices are not the greatest considering the portion but fairly reasonable considering how damn good the food is. Definitely worth a visit or two, especially if you have a friend in town who needs a little more pleasure in his/her life :)",0.9978,0.769,0.212,0.019,0.5409849409849411

If you order it, you have four things to choose: (1) meat or vegetarian; (2) mushrooms or no mushrooms; (3) half pound or whole pound; (4) white or wheat crust. Please don't kid yourself and get the wheat crust because vegetarian or not, half pound or not, this dish is in no way, shape, or form even remotely healthy. But it's a tasty and unique experience that you have to try at least once. We also got the small Greek salad, which was huge. If you were eating the small Greek salad as an entree, it would be enough of an entree for two people. If you're each getting your own pizza pot pie and getting the salad to start, it can be shared by four or five people. The same is true of all the small salads. The larges are obviously even more enormous. And it comes with two salad dressings on the side (the sweet and sour poppy seed dressing is particularly unique and tasty). The half pound pizza pot pie is definitely enough for one person. There is no need to get the full pound unless you're particularly hungry. If two people are both ordering the pot pie, I'd recommend each getting the half pound instead of trying to share the full pound. It's just best to have your own. I didn't try it, but many tables ordered the Mediterranean bread, which was super thin, super huge, and looked delicious. There can be a long wait at times, so be prepared.

The Mushrooms in mine were huge but the meat sauce they had reminded me of elementary school spaghetti and meat sauce day. When people in other reviews post about them not being able to provide them with a side of their sauce for dipping there is a reason the meat is cooked in the sauce with the onions and garlic and everything. The sauce is specifically made for the pizza pot pie and not useable for dipping. I enjoyed it, just Remember CASH ONLY and plan on a wait and you will enjoy the experience.

Yesterday my friends tried the sandwiches for the first time, and they were not disappointed.  There was no consensus at the table as to what was the best item, though.  I pulled for the pizza (not eating meat, it was basically my only option) as did another person, while the Italian and meatball grinders each got a vote as well.   And definitely do not forget the Mediterranean bread!  It's a huge piece of pizza dough covered in herbs and parmesan, and I think it is definitely a highlight of the meal.

I had the Italian grinder and it was huge, packed with meat and melted cheese; with the Mediterranean bread filling up half my stomach already, I barely ate a third of the grinder (and got two more meals out of it back home). This place has a cozy atmosphere; the ceiling feels a little low (although it's not), and while it's crowded and we had to wait for a table, the booths afford a good amount of privacy so it doesn't feel or sound loud.

2011-11-15,4.0,"This was another pizza place I tried my beset to go to on my trip to Chicago.  As I mentioned in my Lou Malnati's post, the planning of this was difficult as my friends limited me to 2 pizza places...sons of bitches. Giordano's was already on my list and my second choice was down between this and Lou Malnati's. If I had it my way, I would go to every single pizza place famous in Chicago: Giordanos, Lou Malnatis, Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder, Geno's East, Pizzeria Uno, and I think theres a few more I'm missing.  I ended up cheating the system on the second day and while we were waiting in line for Doughnut Vault (best donut I've ever had in my life), I discovered there was a Lou Malnati's down the street. So I ordered a small personal sized pizza to go. This left me one more pizza place since we didn't actually go to Lou Malnati's...just a quick stop. I tried to go there on Saturday night but the wait was an 1.5 hours and while I normally wouldn't have minded too much, we had a show to catch (Bye Bye Liver at Pub Theater...highly recommend fyi). Thus on my last day, Sunday, after eating breakfast, we had a little bit of time before I had to head back to the airport. So as stupid or as awesome as you may think it is, we headed straight here. I ordered a 1/2 pound veggie pot pie with white crust. You had the option of whole wheat and normally I would have gotten it, but I thought I should keep it OG and do a plain white crust. It was about $12 (cash only) for this pot pie deliciousness. I was a little scared of ordering one to go and it being compromised without the ambiance of actually being there for the reveal, but I was pleasantly surprised. It didn't wow me as much as I expected, but it also was really good. The bottom got a bit soggy, which I'm not sure if that was because I ordered to go and the sauce just made the bread really moist. The pot pie is actually pretty simple, yet creative. It's this mound of pizza dough on top that when flipped all you see is gooey yummyness of melted cheese. Then as soon as you cut in a little, you get all that sauce. Definitely creative. I would for sure go back to experience it the right way to see if my opinion changes, but you can't go wrong here.

But finally made it back last week.  Went on a weekday around 7 and didn't have to wait at all... but after we sat, it started to get quite busy.   Ordered the half pound pot pie (vegetarian version) and shared a salad (forgot what it was called, but I think it was the first one).  Most salads at other places are an afterthought: some greens, some fillings, some default dressing.  But not here, I think (no I know) its the best salad I've ever had.  The dressings (you get two) were simply phenomenal.  It made me love salad and I only crave theirs.   The pot pie was as I remembered, a slab of cheese and red sauce, flipped over when served.  I dug it, even though I was saddened that the salad was finished.  But once I started, it was very difficult to stop eating... though, I managed to listen to my stomach and leave a quarter for lunch the next day. I'll be back, many times over, especially as the temperature drops and the brain starts to crave deep cheese.   (As others have mentioned, this place is Cash only.... and if you don't have any, the corner deli south of CPOG has an ATM inside with only a $1 surcharge... unheard of!)",0.762,0.872,0.07,0.058,0.45148809523809524

We went once on a Friday evening and they were very busy, we had little wait for a table of two. When we went on a weekday around 5:00 they were not too busy at all and we had no problems getting seated. The restaurant is in a good location with plenty of street parking nearby. I believe they offer valet parking on the weekend, but we haven't had any problems finding street parking. The place has a very intimate atmosphere, it would be an ideal stop for a date or small group. The food is superb. We didn't stray from their most popular items; the mediterranean bread and pizza pot pie. You have a choice of white or whole grain and a vegetarian version of the pizza pot pie is available. There are many reviews of the food, so I wont go into anymore detail than that. It tastes excellent and it's the reason to go there, try it and you shouldn't be disappointed.  We joked that this place thrives on being your stereotypical chicago restaurant. By that I mean it is similar to the Hot Dog joints that serve their product to you their way and that's the only way. It's part of the experience, but they can be rather difficult with their company policies. The soft drinks are small/watered down and they do not offer free refills. In a world where free soft drink refills are an industry standard, I really don't get that policy. Also don't get too picky when ordering your pizza pot pie, because there is very little that they will allow you to special order when it comes to ingredients/toppings. Also remember that they do not accept credit cards, you will need cash.  So you will wait for the privilege of being seated, pay for soda refills, eat the food the way they prepare it, pay for your meal the way they tell you to, and somehow walk away feeling fortunate for the opportunity to eat there? It seems they could easily improve customer service, by being a little easier to get along with.

Before i start my review, I wanted to address some reviewers complaints: First off, to those complaining about how it isn't posted that it is cash only, that is false. There is a sign on the door leading into the actual restaurant, not on the door that is exposed to the street. Also, if you had done your research, you would have known that. It is on their website! Second, this is not typical ""chicago pizza"" so if you come here expecting a deep dish pizza, you will be disappointed.  Third, the ""pizza pot pie"" is not an actual pot pie with a crusty top, and to those of you complaining that it didn't taste like a pot pie are ludicrous. It is PIZZA in a different form, not a chicken pot pie.  Fourth, this restaurant, even though seemingly a hole in the wall, is obviously very popular and if you think having to wait an hour at a popular restaurant on a weekend is outrageous, then obviously you don't eat out on the weekends in Chicago, everywhere has a wait. However, a hint to the people that don't want to wait, get there right when they open or go on a week day near the time that they open (which change and are kind of strange, check the website or call for correct hours) Now to my review, I highly recommend the Mediterranean bread & the 1/2 pound pizza pot pie!

Nonetheless, I drank it because it is usually hard for me to eat pizza without a soda while my wife decided not to drink it. After I finished my glass, I requested a refill of my glass and cancellation of my wife's glass (only one little sip consumed). Then the server told me they don't provide with the free refill and gave my wife's glass to me. She also said she would cancel my wife's drink.  After all, the bill said I owed two glasses ($7=$3.50*2). I really felt like being ripped off. If I was going to pay for my 2nd glass, I deserved a fresh new glass right out of the tap. Further, a no-refill soda costs $3.50 at a restaurant of this level? This is another ridiculous thing. Probably, I had to clarify everything before ordering the soda (price/refill) or even after realizing the taste of the soda? But who asks every detail when ordering? Don't we just expect such things to be treated in a reasonable way? After the experience, even if the food was good, I would never come back.

I first discovered CP&OG Co. by watching a segment on the food network about the best cheese dishes in America.  We were drooling at the images of the oozing cheese on the warm toasty crust... Fast forward to a year later and we made a point to check this place out. It was okay.  It was a fun experience... but the actual pizza tasted more like a very saucy pizza french bread.  It was good but not spectacular.  I was happier at Pizano's... but that's a different beast.,0.9196,0.813,0.149,0.038,0.4435185185185185

Long story short we we seated in 1.5 hours and all we got was, ""sorry you had to wait longer."" The food was good although it didn't arrive for another 40 minutes.

2011-08-27,2.0,"Abstract: Tourist trap with sub par food. Only out of towners and McDonald aficionados would give this above three stars. The last time I visited Chicago Pizza & Oven Grinder it was 199X, Biggie and Pac were dropping hot 16s, and I was a young lad. I remember if we behaved at grandma's house we could go here and it was something like a treat. What even solidified it was my little Italian mom saying this is good food. Fast forward to 8/27/2011 after years of living in Chicago. Realizing I've been here forever and never trying this in adulthood, I rounded up a few brave souls to try this place in the suburban part of Lincoln Park and made sure to arrive early to get a table (there is a long wait here.) The bartender greeted us with a scowl as we had disturbed him from aging or whatever the hell he was doing and every drink was an epic test of his patience. To top if all off, the Stella was $7. Where am I, Los Angeles?  Next move was to some sort of Sicilian bread. This is where the second star comes in as it was tasty and layered in something I would put on every piece of bread I would eat. Overall for the $7 or so I pad for it, this left me the most satisfied. Finally our food comes and we are greeted to a $10 dollar baby pizza. The table awes as some magical process procures what promises to be culinary miracles. As we each bit in, we wondered if Chef Boyardee was in the kitchen or if they got the sausage from some lunchables. The portion was tiny, sausage of the lowest quality, whole mushrooms instead of a slice (preference), and just a bland taste. If I knew I was going to get this low quality of product I would've literally got a frozen pizza for half the price and triple the quality. This probably is the worst pizza I've had in Chicago. After halfway through the pizza and a table full of former friends at this point who want my head on a platter for making them wait for this garbage, it occurs to me that everyone in the place is talking about Ohio, something back at home, or how this is delicious. This is not an actual pizza place for citizens (it may have been at once), but rather this is a tourist trap restaurant. No one that actually lives in this city would eat here as the prices are ridiculous, their local $3 slice joint is much better, and they won't have to listen to people talk about how big and crazy ""the city"" is.",-0.3051,0.888,0.059,0.053,0.4338501291989665

After a few minutes he came back and as we were about to order some appetizers, since our 5th was to join us in 15 minutes or so, it seemed he didn't even hear us and started telling us how we can't take up his table if our party is incomplete, because people are waiting and we should just call the other person and ask them what they would like, pretty much read them the menu and place the order. I, personally was baffled and had no words, all I could say was ""But the host sat us here"" :) He was like ""here's what you're gonna do: order appetizers now, then call the person and ask them if they want white or wheat, meat or vegetarian and if they want mushrooms on their pizza, and then I'll be back to take the order"".  No words. Honestly we would have gotten up and left if we didn't like the food so much...

Let me come to the most important aspect of this place.. the pizza. Its baked on the reverse side in a bowl. So, the dough is on the top and the sauce (so spicy and flavorful!) and cheese (gooey goodness!) are on the inside. The pizza takes about 30-40 minutes to cook and the waiters have never failed to inform me about it. In the meantime I usually nibble on the Mediterranean flat bread, which is mind-blowing as well.

This place always has people waiting out the door. Fortunately you can take your drinks outside while you wait.  The guy that remembers your face is awfully accurate. The actual wait was an hour and 26 minutes. He doesn't take your name, he just looks at your face. We did get seated right behind the people who were in front of us. Impressive. The salad was nothing special. We ordered their regular house salad which was a mound of iceberg lettuce with some olives, peppers, cucumbers, red onion, and 2 slices of tomatoes. Iceberg lettuce is a waste of stomach space and it's cheap. If their salad had leafy greens, I'd be in heaven. The reason why people like the salad so much is because of their dressings. They were superb. You could put them on a shoe and it would taste good. This is how you get away with using iceberg lettuce. You get a garlicky one and a sweet poppy seed one. You can mix them and it makes for a great combo. The garlic one made a great dip for the Mediterranean bread. The Mediterranean bread was delicious. They put a bunch of stuff on the top and it just works. I can't even describe all the stuff they sprinkle on it. Just get it. I had the meat pizza pot pie with mushrooms. It was pretty good. The sausage almost had the consistency of ground beef and almost tasted like it, too. But you can taste the fennel, which I loved. It just wasn't quite sausagey to me. The one slight amusement was that the meat sauce they use is a little familiar...oh yeah, I make it at home when I'm making spaghetti....sauteed ground meat, some herbs, tomato sauce. You could totally top some pasta with the filling.  The crust was soft chewy bread, which I liked, and a thick layer of cheese, which I also liked. The sauce may have been on the sweet side for my taste so I doused it with the red pepper flakes, which I put on everything anyway. I like it hot. Don't you? ;) All in all I had a great meal. It was unique. But not sure if I'd wait an hour and a half again. I felt like it was one of those things that I'm happy to try once.  Oh, they charge soda by the glass. That was a surprise. They are also cash only, which I was ok with because it keeps the food cost low. I'll earn miles at other restaurants.",0.9964,0.819,0.159,0.022,0.5717338217338218

I was expecting a wait, and there was about a 45-minute wait, which was fine. What was NOT fine was that they took our group of 6 and placed us at a table for 4, in the middle of a cramped section, with two other over-stuffed tables. I would rather have waited longer and had an appropriate seating arrangement. The worst was that after THEY seated us that way, the wait staff had the audacity to complain that they couldn't get past us. We mentioned that we thought that was incredibly rude, and they at least did us the favor of taking our appetizer off the bill. The situation was bad, but I thought the food would redeem the cramped quarters and rude service. The mediterranean bread was good, but nothing to get too excited about. The pizza pot pie, which I thought would be the pièce de résistance, was so blah. I mean, it wasn't terrible, but I was expecting it to be excellent, and it was just ok. After the whole rest of the experience, it was just so disappointing that the food didn't even come close to making up for the rest of the nightmare.

Once we were finally seated, we started with the famous Salad and Mediterranean bread. Salad was a salad, not sure why everyone swears by it... It was lettuce, tomatos, etc.  But, the rest of the table thought that the salad dressing was really tasty.... unfortunately i forgot to try some as the mediterranean bread had my fullest attention! To say the least, the Mediterranean bread was really good, but someone mentioned a hygienic problem with the bread touching the table, the tray, and who knows what else... Guess that is a bit gross now that you think about it....  Of course I'm sure it would be pretty easy to put it on some wax paper that actually fit the large size of the bread, but then again, it would also be pretty easy to take a name down on paper :)   (Notice, i'm still thinking about getting screwed in the line) Ok, so the Pizza pot pie was good but I got the 1 lb large size and it was not worth the $21 for it.  Lots of cheese in it and not much else.  Meat sauce was pretty good, but i couldnt say anything about the crust, cause you couldnt call that soggy mess a crust. And regarding the value of the pot pie, i had some thoughts on it and I think it would've been better to get 2 of the regular sizes next time instead. Overall, I still prefer Lou malnatis spinach and sausage.. you really need a nice crust in pizza and this pot pie just didn't have it. And if you didnt already read this...  the most annoying thing, aside from not taking names (see, still thinking about it), was the fact they didnt take credit cards!  Shaddy, and Very Annoying as everything here was more on the expensive side...  our bill was definitely over $100, so be sure to hit up the ATM beforehand.

2011-07-21,3.0,"My sister, her husband, my mother and I traveled to Chicago for a family vacation. My sister and I asked our mom where she'd like to eat while in Chicago; mom mentioned seeing a pizza pot pie on the TV Food Network. A little Googling quickly lead to the Chicago Pizza & Oven Grinder Co. After a very pleasant walk to the restaurant, we found a crowd on the sidewalk chatting and drinking beer. I made my way inside, waited about five minutes; a man finally appeared as asked ""how many"". I replied ""four"". He said, ""Okay, 45 minutes"". And then he walked away. Didn't bother to ask my name... We fetched some beer and made our way back outside to mingle with the crowd. After talking to a few people, the ""how many people, I don't want to know your name"" shtick has been going on for years and we need not worry about being forgotten. After a forty-five minute wait, the host guy took a stroll around the sidewalk and gathered up a group which included my party. We were seated and then promptly visited by a waiter. After some discussion, we decided to get an antipasto plate and a 'Mediterranean Bread"". Another round of three beers... three pizza pot pies and a grinder for my sister. The antipasto plate was a delicious assortment of cured meats, cheeses and veggies. The Mediterranean Bread was a generously large round of soft fresh baked bread liberally covered in a savory seasoning. After a reasonable amount of time had passed, dinner arrived. The pizza pot pies came with a bit of presentation: the waiter brought the three pot pies out on one plate. He would flip a pot pie over onto a serving plate, loosen it from the baking dish and then serve. My sister's meatball grinder was of mythic proportions. I think the four of us could have easily split the one ""sandwich"" and still had left overs. My mom and bro-in-law seemed to enjoyed the pizza pot pies. I don't want to say I was disappointing in mine, but the copious layer of ""brick cheese"" (a special imported cheese the kitchen uses due to it's ability to melt but retain consistency) was just too much for me. I began by removing the layer of dense cheese. What was left was a meaty tomato sauce which, in all honesty, wasn't that great; I kept thinking ""Spaghetti O's""- which is a very bad thing to think. A ""doorknob"" sized mushroom was tucked into the middle of the pot pie and added, if anything, a distraction from the meal as it was bulky, crunchy, and too large to be cooked in proportion to the dish. I left the restaurant far less than satisfied with the main course, but it wasn't bad. I think it has room for improvement, but that's just my opinion. The place was packed and they were serving more pizza pot pies than I could count, so someone must like them! All in all, we ran up a bill for about $110, not including tip (three beers, two appetizers, a grinder and three ""half pound""  pizza pot pies). Seems like a lot of $$ for some fast causal caliber ""Italian"" food. Felt like a lot of $$ when I had to count out cash. This is a note to take.... the restaurant is ***CASH ONLY***.

I'm the 501th reviewer - this means my review is the only review that matters. j/k I've been coming to this restaurant for years now and I ALWAYS make sure I bring my out of town guests to check this place out. I never thought to write a review, because I figured this is one of Chicago's staples.  My standard order : Chef salad, Mediterranean bread (white), and 1 lb pizza potpie with meat sauce/mushrooms (white). As soon as the bread comes out, I load that bad boy up with an extra layer of the seasoning. Believe me, I've been tempted many times to sneak that canister into my purse. Also, they will refill your poppy seed/garlic dressings if you ask for it. Obviously the above order is shared between two people....

I had been raving about the place up until we went, then I felt a little let down.  The wait was at least 30 minutes - because  they only have 2 or 3 at most tables for groups bigger than 4 (there were 6 of us).  After being seated, we got the bread and ordered.  We waited a pretty long time for food, and our waitress seemed pretty annoyed the whole time.  HOwever, I didn't let his review skew my rating TOO much, as it's a small restaurant and can't be expected for big groups.

2011-02-20,3.0,"BEST part of the restaurant to WORST: The Mediterranean Bread was fantastic.  It is warm and gooey topped with herbs and seasonings galore.  My server informed me that this is the most popular menu item.  I believe it. The salad here is AMAZING.  When it arrives, it looks like a simple cheap iceberg salad with a few tomatoes, olives, and onions.  Then the dressings arrive.  You get sour creamy garlic and poppyseed.  Mix them together on top of your salad and it will be a taste-explosion in your mouth!  YUM. I would have been satisfied stopping my meal at this point because I was more than satisfied. The pizza pot-pies are pretty good.  However, I think they are a little over-rated.  They are unique, I'll give 'em that.  But they don't have a ton of flavor.  There is a lot of sauce and a buttery crust.  Otherwise, dare I say they are a little bland?  I got the white crust veggie version, so maybe that was my problem.  Anyways, the pizza took my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars. Otherwise, the atmosphere is ok.  It has a typical old restaurant feel with wood as the dominant decor.  But the history behind the restaurant makes it special. Additionally, this is a cash only restaurant.  C'mon, join the 21st Century!  Pay the fees to the credit card companies!  Or stop laundering money?!?  Nobody carries around cash anymore.   Finally, no drink refills.  Seriously?  I got a diet coke in a tiny little glass and was then informed I had to pay for a refill.  This took my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars.   Bottom line: I will definitely go to this restaurant again.  The salad and bread were awesome.  Next time I will stick with water and possibly opt for a different pizza option.",0.9888,0.779,0.164,0.056,0.606015037593985
2011-02-20,2.0,"I so much wanted to love this place, given the history and good reviews. I found the bad reviews pretty spot-on which describe the pizza pot pie as bland or overrated. My hubby and I both thought the pot pies were really not flavorful, were too salty, and tasted too ""one-note"" without any depth coming from all the ingredients in there. It tasted worse than any frozen pizza I've ever had. I had the meat pot pie with wheat crust, and hubby had the vegetarian pot pie with white crust. Both were equally bad. I hate waiting all week to indulge, only to feel I didn't enjoy it, especially since it's rare for me to meet a pizza I don't like. I want the pizza to tingle my tastebuds, but this pot pie didn't. We knew it was bad when I couldn't eat the leftovers at home. If you have the word ""pizza"" in your name, you should do it well. I am shocked there are lines of people waiting to try this. I wanted to tell them that they could, in my opinion, get much better pizza at La Madia, Malnati's, Pizzeria Uno/Due, Pequod's, etc. Lines and great reviews on Yelp don't always equal good (ie Bongo Room, blech).  Some positives (ok, mixed with a negative or two) of Chicago Pizza & Oven Grinder Co: Small chef's salad was huge for the price and very fresh. We enjoyed trying & mixing the various dressings they bring out to sample. Their original Italian seasonings you can shake on were nice as well. Maybe I should have added dressing and the seasonings onto the pizza pot pie to help it out. As much as we enjoyed the salad, I wouldn't go back just for a salad, as I never will eat a salad as an entree. Mediterranean bread was delicious, and we used some of the dressings to dip it in. I agree it is unhygienic to have it so large that it drapes over the plate and onto your wooden table.  If you're a couple sharing a salad and Mediterranean bread, I think sharing one small pot pie (if you dare) is enough unless you want leftovers. We got a table for 2 right away around 4:45pm (it was either a Friday or Saturday). It got really crowded really quickly shortly thereafter. Atmosphere is really cute/cozy, and we enjoyed knowing the history of the building. I just wish the monotony of the wood paneling was broken up with something else. Our server was good and did all that we expect during a meal. We won't go back, given all the other choices in Chicago.",0.9952,0.765,0.167,0.068,0.5433187560738579

2011-02-15,5.0,"Wait in the long line that you will surely encounter on a weekend - the food and atmosphere are worth it.  A local gem that is hidden between and beneath apartment homes, you will be reminded of your favorite local hometown Italian restaurant when dining here. I strongly recommend the Chef's Salad and Mediterranean Bread to share with your table.  The salad, while comprised of typical veggies, blows you out of the water with the dressings - poppyseed and sour cream garlic.  Separate, they are the some best dressings I have ever tasted.  But - mix them together, and you have an entirely new salad dressing experience that cannot be matched anywhere else! If you don't try the dressing combo, you shouldn't have even shown up to the restaurant.  The Mediterranean Bread is a huge, thin bread topped spices and flavorings that you'd only find in the best Italian joint.  It is their most popular menu item. The Pizza Pot Pie rounds out my trifecta of food perfection.  It is an upside down pizza cooked in a small casserole dish, then turned upside down at your table, to reveal the cheesy, flavorful, well-spiced Italian goodness that is your own personal pizza.  The pie itself is not huge - one per person - which is why the salad + bread are always a part of a meal here. It is cash only, no reservations, and the cute bar is the perfect place to wait.  In the summertime, there's usually a large group of people waiting outside on the sidewalk.  Chicago has a million options for pizza, and this place needs to be on your list.",0.9907,0.839,0.154,0.008,0.5126197035287944

However, we waited about 1 hour and 50 minutes for a table. The host did not take our name or write anything down; apparently he remembers which groups got there first and who should be seated next?? Seemed odd to me, but it ended up pretty fair. I waited about 10 minutes to order a beer at the bar. The bar is VERY small, and I understand that it was a busy night, but the bartender did not even bother to look over and acknowledge we were waiting. Finally, I yelled ""excuse me"" when it seemed he had a minute, and he fulfilled my order. Had I gone here on my own; I would have had no idea what to order. My friends ordered the salad to share, and it was HUGE. I am usually weird about sharing because if I really like it, I want to eat it all, but this was plenty for 4 women. The dressings were to die for. I have been dying to go back ever since I went there 3 weeks ago just for the dressings! Apparently you mix the two together, I think they are creamy garlic and some poppyseed one! Beware, they are VERY cheap on the dressing....you'll see why later... Next, we ordered mediterranean flatbread which was very good except I do not like oregano which it was covered in, but I just scraped it off and it was still good! I ordered the pizza pot pie which I could have done without. It was just o.k. Nothing to rave about. I asked the waiter if I could have dressing to dip my pizza in, and he said ""No, we cannot serve dressing unless you have salad."" Our salad was gone at this point so we couldn't get any dressing.

2010-10-21,3.0,"My OCD and inner-claustrophobia sabotaged this evening at CPOG. Here is my breakdown of Oven Grinder: 5/5 for homemade Sicilian sauce. I come from a family of guidos (you know, Jersey Shore style) and I love me some homemade 'sarsa' so I will definitely give them that. The 'pizza pies' (hopefully you have that Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen song stuck in your head now) are very unique and delicious...which leads me to my second rating... 5/5 for uniqueness. They truly have a unique factor that gives them a big win in my category. Not many places are so representative of Chicago (note: not Chicago style pizza...just Chicago in general).  However... 1/5 for atmosphere. I sat at a two-top (aka this-date-sucks-table) next to a bunch of other large parties. Seats were uncomfortable, it was crowded (mind you it was a weekday...), and there was a wait...again...a wait on a weekday. For me, a restaurant needs to satisfy two things to earn my respect. First, it needs to knock its food out of the ball park. If you're going to make Italian food in Chicago, you better damn well do it right. I give them mad props for that.  However, for me at least, they failed in the atmosphere/comfort zone. I felt cramped, it was crowded, on a wait, overstaffed, and with a menu of only about 15 items or so, I don't give them a lot of credit for having 'great menu knowledge'. Learn 115 plus 40 wines and 30 speciality cocktails and then we'll talk about knowledge of food.

2010-10-18,5.0,"Appropriately, the Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder Co. receives my first 5 star rating. This is not your traditional pizza restaurant. I have been going here for the past 15 years and have never been disappointed. Considering the size of the restaurant, the wait is often long, especially for larger parties. Words of advice, no wait is too long. Once seated, I would recommend everyone order the Mediterranean Bread, a flat bread appetizer with delicious Italian seasonings. The Chef's Salad's dressings are very tasty and are great for dipping the Mediterranean Bread in. It's tough to save room for the main course once you taste the bread and salad. The menu's two main entrees are pizza pot pies and grinders. The restaurant seems to be known more for their pot pies, but I always order the sausage grinder, an enormous sandwich loaded with Italian sausage, marinara sauce, green peppers, and cheese. It is an almost guarantee that you will leave dinner with lunch for the next day, especially if you order the dinner salad and bread. The wait may seem too long at times, but don't let this deter you and your guests. Unfortunately, the bar is not larger to help accommodate those waiting. Once seated, the staff is always quick to take your order and get you underway with an unforgettable meal. Without a doubt, this will always be a favorite restaurant of mine. (Note: If bringing home a leftover grinder, do yourself and the sandwich justice and reheat it in the oven at 350 degrees; however it will never be as good as dining in).",0.77,0.86,0.082,0.058,0.5419444444444446

We got the Mediterranean Bread and a salad as an appetizer.  The bread is really good.  Highly recommended every time.  The salad was excellent as well. One of the guys in our group recommended we get a few oven grinders and a few pizzas and split them up.  Admittedly, I thought it was a terrible idea, but our waiter said he did it often enough and it could be done.  He was right -- it's not a bad way to sample their menu items. BTW, the oven grinders are pretty good.  I wouldn't wait the typical 60-90 minutes for an oven grinder, but they weren't bad.   Excellent service all around.   Granted, CPOG isn't ""Chicago style"" and some may not even call it pizza.  Yes, so the name doesn't exactly fit well with what they serve, but trust me, what they serve is excellent, and has a very unique Chicago history.",0.9932,0.758,0.222,0.02,0.5737904761904761

Anyway, if the pizza pot pie was good, I could let that slide.  We were totally disappointed in the pizza pot pie and the ham grinder.  The pizza pot pie sauce was awful, tasted more like a spaghetti sauce, and had green pepper bits in it.  Just a mass of melted cheese, and the crust was nothing special.  This thing is purely a novelty.  We were totally bummed since we always thought this place looked good on TV.  Did not live up to the hype.  Was not impressed with the grinder either, was just ham, cheese and bread.  Would have preferred lettuce, tomato,etc....

If you took a look at that you'd probably wonder why I gave the place 4 stars.  The food is that good.   The pizza isn't the thing you're imagining right now, unless of course you're imagining an inverted pot pie stuffed with pizza, in which case I have to tell you that you're 30 years too late in coming up with a rad idea.

2010-09-15,5.0,"3 words: Pizza pot pie.  Intrigued by the idea of such deliciousness and the strange enthusiasm on J's face, 4 of us found ourselves in front of a charming, Victorian brownstone with the restaurant on the lower level. A nice, old guy told us the wait was 45-55 minutes and just like that, he somehow inputs all the hungry patrons faces and wait times into his memory. Quite impressive. As our wait time neared the 50 minute mark, I found the guy again and he said 10 more minutes. Well approaching the 70 minute mark, we were finally seated and a few minutes later, he comes with complimentary Mediterranean bread since we waited longer than expected! :D  The bread is practically 1-1.5 feet in diameter holstered by a salad plate in the middle. Our eyes grew big as we enthusiastically ripped it apart. It's thin with parmesan cheese, oregano and other spices, and olive oil that gives it the flavor of a sauceless pizza, nan, and pita bread but at the same time, it is none of the above and is in a class of of its own. By itself, it was so good but with the salad sauces, one that was a sweet and sour poppysead and the other was sour cream garlic, it created a unique base that binded the flavors together in a very fun way. Chef salad was old school - shredded pieces of iceberg lettuce with sliced onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, pepperoncini, black olives, stuffed green olives, artichoke hearts, and green peppers. Drizzle some oil, poppysead and garlic dressing and voila! A simple and very delicious plate of greens. Now onto the main dish. It was baked ""upside down"" - in a bowl, the meat, homemade tomato sauce, doorknob mushrooms and cheese are baked with the pot pie crust on top which resembles a short mushroom. The server then flips it over and removes the dish and the cheesy, meaty concoction oozes into the crust and a pizza pot pie is born. The sauce is sweet from the tomatoes yet very hearty as they are very very generous with the meat. The cheese is so gooey in classic chicago-style pizza manner.  We all got the half-pounders individually and while for most, it would be too much, but for some (fatties like me) it is enough to make you full but not over the top. Overall, the food is very chicago - hearty, simple and comforting. Don't forget it's cash only.",0.9957,0.839,0.149,0.012,0.4547546897546897

2010-09-13,3.0,"I first saw this place on TV a few weeks back. I'm not sure what the program was or what the channel was (WGN? WTTW?), but all I know is that they were in the kitchen of this place showing me how they make their pizza pot pie. Blew. My. Mind. I worked at a pizza joint for awhile, so it was particularly interesting to me, I think. After that I forgot about it for awhile until I decided to look it up. Took me a bit to figure out the name of the place again... it isn't the most intuitive or clever restaurant name. After I finally figured it out, I decided try to go past it if I was in the area. Soon, I found myself skating past the area on Clark and saw a huge crowd sitting on a stoop. Then I saw the sign for the restaurant. This place is either really popular or really small. A week or so later I ran past it. Same thing. Ok, now I HAVE to try this place out. I eventually got a friend and my brother to venture out and eat at this place. My friend and I got there early, walked past the crowd and went inside. Once inside, we looked around completely confused. Eventually a guy came up to us, told us the time it would take to get a seat and said ""you can stay or you can go and come back"", then walked away. Is this guy serious? Apparently he was. I guess not taking names is his 'thing'? It seems to work though. After having a Sophie at the bar, we got a seat in about the time he said we would and we never had to badger him. So, as it turns out, I was right - this place is dark, wooden, and really, really small. Very narrow and not all that deep. Throw in the bar area, and there isn't much eating area. The actual booths are large though, so once you are seated it doesn't seem too cramped. The waiter gave us our menus and we looked it over. The first thing we noticed was that there was not a lot of food choices to choose from. The second thing we noticed was the story on the back. This story was so crazy that we decided to read it out loud. I won't spoil it, but it seemed to emphasize the fact that some random lawyer founded it. Not so sure if I'd stress that. Ordering wasn't a big deal though. We were all there for this pizza pie thing. We also grabbed a flat bread as an appetizer. The bread came and was delicious, and we waited for our pies. Soon, they came as well and they looked great. Then we ate them. Not as great as I was hoping. The real problem is they really don't have a pizza taste to them at all. The meat sauce really makes it taste like some sort of pasta. That isn't to say it didn't taste good, but it just wasn't what I was expecting. I feel you should know that going in. Maybe that way you'll like it more than I did. I'd be interested in going back for a grinder, but the pizza really didn't do it for me. Great experience though. I don't regret going at all.

Most people get the salad, Mediterranean flatbread and a half-pounder per person.  Its usually more food than you can handle.  The med bread is flavored with parsley, fennel seeds, garlic, Parmesan and maybe some other stuff - its tastes kind of ambiguously Mediterranean (i.e., Italian, north African..)  We did a side-by-side comparison of the pot pies this time -- one veg and whole wheat and the other meat on white.  I think the wheat is an easy winner, its got more flavor without being grainy.  The veg vs meat is harder to say though; the veg one comes out tasting a bit sweeter because of the extra tomatoes, but its not necessarily worse.   Some people said ""if you're a thin crust type you're not going to like this place"" -- That's like saying if you like spaghetti you're not going to like this lasagna.  Its just a totally different food.  True, though, that if you're in the mood for thin crust you should skip this place.

2010-07-30,3.0,"WTF is up with this place?  I have a love-hate relationship with it. It's always something. My friends and I joke about the place constantly. Let's start off positive: I l-o-v-e the salads. All of them. Because as weird as it sounds, salads are my favorite food. Mediterranean flat bread is good too but you have to share b/c it's freaking HUGE---- just like many of the asses sitting in the restaurant right now---- just like how your ass will be if you go there too often. (Seriously, look around. You know there are at least 1-2 whales beached in there) Their feature food, the pizza pot pie thing is good on a cold day but really, I'm not that crazy over it. We go for the salads. Now let's get negative. First off, who is the guy who wanders around the restaurant and attempts to seat you?  You have to wait forever to get his attention, other people are waiting, the waiting entryway is cramped, and the host-guy-whatever-he-is is no where to be found (happened to me 4x thus far).  Then when you do get his attention, he is not nice. He kind of grunts to find out how many people are in your party then just walks away.  He doesn't write your name on a list. You are now on an imaginary list.... in his head & you hope he doesn't forget that you were here before the 4 other groups waiting. (Ooops! He does forget sometimes! Feck!)   Anyway, so when you get to your table, you think you want and hope for one of the wooden booths. They look comfy right? Ummm no. They are old, and the panel that serves as your seat back is always loose so that the big people in the booth behind you push their fat backs against the board and push you into your food. Fabulous.  Then, finally..... do you have any special requests? Hopefully not because fuck your special requests.  What? You would like some extra pizza sauce with your meal? ""I'm sorry, we don't do that."" WTF DOES THAT MEAN?! WHAT DO YOU MEAN ""WE DON""T DO THAT?!"" Last time I checked, you damn well SHOULD. My take, go there for the salads or if you are looking to increase your BMI value. After thinking about it for a long while w/ many friends in the restaurant business we have decided the reason they don't give you extra pizza sauce is because.... wait for it.... they cant!  They probably don't make the pizza-pot-pies themselves. They are probably made elsewhere and brought in frozen.  If they gave you any sauce, it would not be the sauce in your pie. Shady, shady, shady, either way.  TOTALLY MAKE SURE TO ASK FOR EXTRA PIZZA SAUCE--- just to be a dick.  See what happens. My last piece of advice if you do end up going is if you have the choice between beer and wine, CHOOSE WINE.  Sure, pizza and beer are perfect mates but a well over-poured glass of wine is sooooooooo much better than a beer of the same price. Be a cheap drunk get the wine and make it the cab. Makes the entire dining experience... hilarious.",0.9941,0.759,0.162,0.079,0.5799735912235914

Now whenever I go back, I try to stop by since this is a very unique pizza dining experience, and a good one at that.  Everyone is well aware that Chicago is famous for its deep dish pizza, but as a native New Yorker, I prefer the thin crust pie. This pizza is neither. It is basically a not too thick, not to thin bowl of dough with sauce and cheese inside. On my most recent visit, I had a ""1/2 pounder"" (as opposed to the ""1 pounder"") with meat sauce and white bread. It was, as usual, very tasty. The sauce is filled with tasty ground sausage and came with two full mushrooms. The mozzarella was rich and tasty.  For starters my party had the monstrous Greek salad and flat-bread. The very large salad came with mounds of feta cheese, fresh tomatoes, onions and olives. Everything was crisp and fresh. The dressings provided, when mixed together were tasty indeed. The flat-bread, (whole wheat by choice), was generously seasoned with parmesan and other herbs and spices that made it robustly flavored. It was served warm and was also quite good.  Usually, when eating here, you are subject to a wait, sometimes very long, and it is cash only. It is dark with wooden booths that only seat four taking up a majority of the restaurant, so seating a large party can be difficult.

2010-07-07,2.0,"My guess is, the recipe for a decently flavored, regularly shaped pizza was also lost in the Valentine's Day massacre.  A group of us put our Chicago tourist caps on and took a stroll down Clark. With our combined 108 years, it was safe to assume that we'd already tried thin crust, deep dish, and stuffed. What we hadn't tried? Pot pie style pizza. Let me tell you, the comfort of pot pie should never be easily translated into pizza. It's unfair to the traditionally creamy broth of a pot pie uninhabited by marinara. It's unfair to the standard pizzas of Chicago that work hard every day, trying to make a name for themselves, getting jazzed up in ingredients only to get outshone by the attraction of a pot pie styled version of themselves. But mostly, it's unfair to you, consumer, for falling prey to the most luring of all delicacies that in most minds can do no wrong--pizza.  Well, you've done wrong, CP&OG. But I don't want to slam you too hard. Your server was a bubbly delight and truly believed in what you had cooking. I also appreciate a creative spin on the ordinary. But in the pizza world, ordinary is what what we crave. Sort of like the new Becky in Roseanne. It's fine for something completely different, but where is the whiny disrespected Becky we all know and love? That's right, she's been replaced by a pot pie. We settled on the Chef's salad for an appetizer, and we devoured that to the last drop of iceberg. The Chef's salad is a volcano of iceberg. Jeeze Louise. Green peppers, tomatoes, and pepperoncini also joined the party in this salad and were finished with our choice of three dressings. Our consensus was that an iceberg filled salad saved the night.  My final thought, it's fun to try once, but I wouldn't come back.  Seems like the real tragedy this side of Clark is the pizza. And if it's pot pie style that they're trying to smuggle, I don't think I'd be worried.",0.7631,0.793,0.11,0.097,0.5698809607900517

The pizza comes out with the bowl in the middle.  The waiter turns over the bowl and empties the contents into the empty pizza pie.

The wine list was very reasonably priced (per bottle) so we ordered up a bottle of red and perused the menu.  It's pretty basic, so we ordered a standard chef salad and the flat bread (""must have"").  The salad could have had a few more veggies for my liking, but the dressing combo was the real treat to that dish.  And the flat bread....OH MY THE FLAT BREAD!  I could have eaten an entire order of that and been a happy camper.  My only complaint was that when it arrived, the thing was so huge, it was like dragging on the table, which I found a tad gross (how clean is that table?)  and that it got seasoning crumbs everywhere around my plate...felt like a total ""fat kid"" moment there... Then the pot pie - my friend and I split the veggie ""half-pounder"" (which I'll admit, felt a bit like I was ordering a burger).  When it came to the table, it looked a bit like a mushroom of dough, which the waitress then flipped over to serve.  Now it looked more like an inverted mushroom cap filled with cheese, sauce & mushroom (singular, as there was only one and it was not sliced).  My reaction?  Meh, I mean, it was tasty, but the sauce for me was far too watery, and lacked seasoning.  Dough was good, but felt like it was a bit underdone.   All in all, I'm glad I got to try it, but if I go back, I'll probably just get a bottle of wine and the flat bread.  3 stars for that :)",0.9941,0.781,0.186,0.032,0.5075537634408602

Picture a thick, kinda undercooked bread bowl made of pizza dough, filled with a soupy mix of meat sauce and giant mushrooms (like, seriously huge mushrooms), and topped with cheese. Okay, that even sounds good on paper, but it really ain't that great. The soupiness of the filling combined with the doughiness of the crust was a little unappetizing, and I still don't get why they insist on using whole, awkwardly huge mushrooms instead of slicing them up. I guess I should just stick with regular deep dish (which I love). There are a few other things I wasn't impressed with. I think it's ridiculous that they only accept cash. In this day and age, that's inexcusable (except at Hot Doug's...I'll forgive Doug for anything). They only offer a couple of choices for pizza ""fillings"" - I think it's just meat or no meat - so forget being able to customize your experience.

Try both of them together - I could eat that by itself. The flatbread is a great appetizer, so wonderfully seasoned. Of course I always like to order a bottle of wine to accompany the meal. They have a pretty good selection (not that I'm super picky). The flatbread, salad, potpie and wine is my all-time favorite meal. There can be long lines for this place, especially on weekend nights.

My wife and I dined there on the spur of the moment last night and everything was great!  We started with the Chef's salad with their two most popular dressings; a sweet poppy seed and a savory garlic. The flavor of both of them on the salad is delicious! We each had a 1/2 pound pizza pot pie (meat for me, veggie for my wife); again, delicious! Prepared in a bowl, it was scooped onto a plate tableside, by our server. A good portion of silky cheese with a thick and meaty tomato sauce (I would have liked a little more spice and seasoning) but it worked. Walnut-sized button mushrooms give a fresh garden taste which contrasts nicely with the rest of the pizza. It came as we were eating our salad and was almost seductive the way it sat there on the plate waiting for me (I wished I had ordered the one pounder). We didn't order them on this visit, but neither the Mediterannean Bread appetizer nor the Tartufo dessert should be missed!  As for seatings, here are your options; get there early or get there late! Ovengrinders is a VERY popular dining destination with a small footprint and it fills up (and stays that way) rather quickly. It's housed in the basement of a typical Chicago two-flat and exudes a rustic ambiance that is quite charming. Price-wise; $10.75 is a little steep for an individual pizza, but chalk that up to the demand, and the location in the heart of trendy Lincoln Park! In a city that is known for its wide variety of quality pizzerias, Ovengrinders is by far the most unique and, to me the most...'Chicago'!",0.9816,0.873,0.112,0.015,0.6094155844155844

I ordered the vegetarian pizza pot pie, which is just not that special. It's not bad, but... I'd rather be eating actual deep dish pizza. I really like the space though and had an enjoyable experience there.",0.8803,0.75,0.214,0.036,0.423015873015873
2010-03-03,5.0,"I love CPOG!!!  We always take family here when they come to visit because it's a unique Chicago place that is just SO good! Sure, it's not gourmet fare, but it's great if you are looking for something different and delicious! You must come early and come hungry and plan on waiting a while when you come here. We usually have to wait a 1/2 hour to 1 hour. If you come later in the evening the wait gets even longer, so watch out.  If you have a party of more than 4 plan on waiting a REALLY long time, they only have a couple larger tables so it takes a while to get seated. The wait is well worth it though! The famous host who greets you at the door never writes anything down but he always remembers you and gets you seated when he says he will.  I like the charm and character of the place, its dark and small and somewhat cramped, but somehow it works for this place.  Everytime we go we get the same thing, salad, bread, and pizza pot pie. The small chef's salad is a HUGE mound of iceberg lettuce (which is not my fave), a few olives, onions, peppers, tomato, etc. It's MORE than enough for 2 or 3 people. What really makes it great is the dressing! They serve several types with the salad, a creamy garlic, a poppy seed and a house italian. All of them are great, I LOVE the poppy seed and just found out they sell bottles of it to take home. Yum! The Mediterranean Bread is a HUGE flatbread type thing with seasonings on it. Its delicious and more than enough for 2-4 people. Then we also manage to stuff down a small pizza pot pie (aka: PPP). The PPP is a yummy little crust bowl filled with cheese and sauce that is SOOO good and homemade tasting. We like it with no mushrooms. Got it with mushrooms once and they weren't cooked all the way and they ruined the masterpiece that is the PPP.  The staff is always friendly, even though they are very busy all the time. The only thing about this place that gets annoying is that the staff clears your table SO fast. They are constantly taking your plates and things off of your table the minute you set your fork down. But I guess they are busy and they need to get people in and out as fast as possible, so I can deal with this.",0.998,0.785,0.193,0.022,0.5380777777777778

It is so good, it is the only reason anyone needs. Well, the big Becks are another good reason. THE BAT CAVE Sure it's dark. Sure it's small. Part of the charm. Know you will be shoulder-to-shoulder. Smile. THE WAIT The wait can be long. Here is what you do, and this always works: get the attention of the host, so he knows you are there, and then move to the bar. It doesn't matter how crowded it is. Within 5-15 minutes you will have seats in the bar area. Once you have a seat in the bar area who cares how long the wait is? You have big Becks! THE OVEN GRINDERS I never had one. Don't know what I'm missing. THE PIZZA Order the pizza pot pie. But don't expect pizza. This is the biggest mistake going. And it is everyone's mistake. I don't consider it to be pizza. When I want real pizza, I get a thin crust from any hundred of other great Chicago pizza pubs. It is the Oven Grinder's mistake too. They call it is pizza. It isn't pizza. It is a big bowl of shmoo. Spaghetti-sauce, bread-stuff, and a whole lot of cheese. It's good, but it's not pizza. Oh yeah, use a fork and knife. THE SALAD Get the Chef's Salad. It is standard. It is really just a salad. There is nothing special or different about it that I can discern, but for some reason (honestly I can't figure out why) it is one of the best salads around. It makes no sense to me.  It is just good. Oh, and go ahead and mix the dressings as instructed by your server. That is just the way. And they have gotten stingy with the dressing. Just finish it off and ask for more, please. They bring it. THE MEDITERRANEAN BREAD White or wheat. I like white. This stuff is so good, I could eat it all day long. I have tried to make it. Can't.  I took some spices from OG. Still couldn't make it. Keeps me coming back. This is the reason to go there. THE BIG BECKS I am a home brewer. I like all beer. I never buy Becks, at home or out. But if they ever change the Becks at the Oven Grinder I will be very sad. It is just a part of my experience. (Edit: I am sad. They changed the big Beck's to big Stella.

I am a big fan I was introduced to ""Grinders"" by friends who live in Round Lake IL Our first time in we waited over an hour & half. I feel this unique place is worth the wait. I wouldn't recommend it after 5pm any night of the week if you are claustrophobic or impatient though. I love that the host who has changed over the years I have been going there but still none of the 3 I have ever seen uses a pen. I also suspect its a slightly flawed system but I may be mistaken Just get another beer from the bar and you'll forget all about it.  My order is always the same Hacker Pchor to drink a wheat beer not found everywhere but popular enough. The chef salad with one of their signature items mix the creamy garlic & sweet poppy seed dressing. As long as you like garlic you won't be disappointed. Wheat Mediterranean bread & A 1lb wheat vegetarian with extra mushroom ""unconventional Pizza Pie"" If you want thin crust or deep dish keep on driving this a unique dining experience is like nothing you have had before. I can usually finish the one pounder but have admitted defeat on a couple of occasions. they wrap your food for you & put in a fancy twine handled paper bag very classy.  This place is small, with small isles and small booths  It is dimly lit but most fancy places are. The last time I went to Ruth's Chris downtown I needed a flashlight.  I have always had great customer service. They may not visit as often as I might like but there is plenty of staff scurrying about. I never had a problem getting a request fulfilled.  I have to mention the water I personally am not a fan of the lemon slice in the glass but my wife loves it & the buss boys/ water servers almost never let your glass empty (Coo-dos Guys)  The cash only policy was a pain I learned about it the hard way. But Once you know it's not really an issue.  The price does seem a little steep but the quality of the food reflect the price did I mention the service those staff members aren't free.

2009-12-26,1.0,"AVOID!!!! AVOID!!!! AVOID!!!! AVOID!!!! Wow, where do I begin with this place.  First I'm shocked at all the positive reviews, its simply miraculous that more than a handful of people could find anything about this place enjoyable. Then I remembered, people who hated this place are more likely to not write a review because they'd like to forget this awful experience and slap the person who recommended it to them...as I did. When you first arrive you're greeted with this extremely off putting sign...""Cash Only"". Seriously, is business so good that you can dictate what form of payment we use!? Instead of turning around and leaving I made the awful mistake of running down the street in the pouring rain like a Hobo, searching for an ATM. Once inside and seated I couldn't help notice how ugly and uncomfortable the place is. Stiff wooden benches set at a back smashing 90 degrees and so close to the edge of the table I felt like my ribs were scrapping the wood. The place was lit like the bat cave and I had to reflect dim light off my watch just to see which one of my friends I was glaring at from across the table.  In addition they have over 20 cameras hanging from the ceiling in corners and odd places, my guess is when the customers go Ape S@^$ and tear up the place from having such a bad experience, they want it all on tape for court purposes. This was nothing however and the real show began when the waitress arrived. She explained the menu starting with the Pizza Pot Pie. She explained the Half and Full serving, explaining that ""half"", as she gestured with her hands to describe the size, was a decent serving for one. Then referring to the ""full"" she expanded her hand gesture hardly a half an inch to demonstrate the size of the ""full"" explaining it was ""a hearty serving for 2"" mind you the Full is more than double the price of the half at a whopping $27. I'm guessing full and half refers to the price not the portions. We nearly laughed in her face. She then explained how the pot pie was prepared and served and staunchly proclaimed, ""no exceptions, thats how its served"". Which I gathered to mean, no one likes how its served and she gets complaints all the time and this is her best attempt at covering her butt. This was the beginning of a long painful lesson that carried on the whole night.  The cooks, waitresses, manager and owner are extremely lazy and rude, they wont do anything for you, they just pump their crappy selection out the kitchen like an assembly line. We passed on the pot pie, got the grinders and were horrified. First they are served with a very large side of steamed green peppers. What?! Excuse me?! What type of cuisine is this? Have you ever in your life eaten hard, undercooked green peppers with your food as a side?! Honestly, I didnt know this was typical ANYWHERE ON PLANET EARTH. The ""grinders"" were also stuffed with an extra helping of green peppers and the bread was so puffy and dry that we asked for a side of tomato sauce to dip. We were told,  ""it comes how its served""  What? is that your way of telling me to screw off?  We said, seriously we'd just like a small amount of sauce to dip in, charge us for it if you want.  The answer, ""I cant do that, thats how its served"".  Forget the fact that you're a complete idiot, I'm a paying customer, if you're customer wants sauce get him some sauce!  Finally we asked for the manager, I explained, ""besides everything else that is wrong with this place we'd just like some tomato sauce for this sandwich because its TOO DAMN DRY!"" The answer, ""No, I cant give you any sauce"".  I said, ""listen see the sauce that is on the sandwich, take some of that from the giant pot back there and put it in a small place or bowl...that's it!""  The answer, ""no, there are no sides"".  I'm not sure what kept us from getting up, saying F@$&# You and leaving but we all sat in amazement going over different scenarios of how we'd like to flip the tables over, stomp the staff with our boots and leave.. In short the food was terrible, the customer service was so far below any standard that they shouldn't be in business and I would STRONGLY recommend you avoid this place.",0.7044,0.848,0.075,0.078,0.5281252254689756
2009-12-08,2.0,"OK I'm giving it 1 and a 1/2 stars because the Grinder part is Okay. I am completely mystified about all the raves and 5 star ratings. There cannot be that many people with such bad taste buds. Good thing I had cash on me because they don't take anything else (and we went out of our way to go here). It's real tight in there and really as far as I could see a lot of young locals (well, like any Lincoln Park transplant they moved to the big city when they got out of college) and tourists mix. I was definitely getting funny stares as I sat there with my White Sox hat on (Holy Cow!).  We were 2 adults and 2 kids and we just fit in the little booth. Yeah, there was a little wait and the place was totally packed.  We ordered the Mediterranean bread appetizer. I looked at the small choice you have with the ""pizza"" thing (more on this thing later) and tried to figure what to order for the kids for the main. I know they like pizza (and not Grinders or salads) so I ordered a half  pizza  for each kid & I ordered a ""half"" for myself. There's over $38 right there. Too bad there isn't a picture of this ""pie"" pizza thing on the menu. My girlfriend ordered the Veggie Grinder. Well the paper thin bread came and it made me squeamish that it came in a dish too small for the bread and the thing was hanging all over the bare table probably picking up plenty of bacteria. (""Cause they quickly make a table ready and you KNOW it's not been washed down with a clean and sanitary cloth) Have they ever heard of pizza pans? You sprinkle shake cheese and herbs over it and eat it. It was OK and so the kids ate a little of it, but didn't really like it and I didn't want to spoil it by mentioning bacteria. The kids were gulping down their pop quickly as it was a hot day and there were no refills included (I found out only after the order) so the bill kept adding up. Now the pizza thing comes and I have to say if you really like pizza and are waiting for PIZZA you are not so excited when this little lump shows up (it' fills the tiny bowl/plate it comes on). The mushroom ""pizza"" came with one large, uncut, squishy, tasteless mushroom in the center under a glob of tasteless cheese. I actually had to give one kid some of my ""pizza"" 'cause he was still hungry (7 year old). I SO much would have enjoyed a simple deep dish Chicago style pizza and it would have filled us and made us go ""yum"". This pie made is go ""meh"". My girlfriend enjoyed her Grinder and it was big. I know they're trying to expand the pizza experience but for me it just doesn't make it. Again, why so many sheeple just love it 'cause this place is packed with them, is beyond me.

I did get a kick out of the ""no name list"" policy and the fact that everyone was told that the wait would be 25 minutes when they walked in despite the fact that it averaged more like 8-10 minutes (I got to watch lots of people being seated as I waited for friends and listened to the tourist family from Michigan bond with the two ladies from Ohio . . . Chicago Pizza should probably be thanking the woman at the Marriott who sends them the half of their customers who don't watch Rachael Ray) . . . but after that, it sort of went downhill. I appreciate getting value for money, and being able to take home leftovers is a good thing, but I don't see the draw of going to places that are going to charge a lot for giving you obscene amounts of just ok food so that you feel like you're getting a deal and they can keep up their profit margins. We split a salad, which was good but not terribly special, and then I had the vegetarian grinder. It was good enough that I enjoyed about a third of it . . . but then I just couldn't plow through any more bread, and I love my carbs. The chunks of vegetables were the saving grace (though the olives were just weird in a sandwich) and the sauce was very well done, but it wasn't the amazing revelation everyone led me to expect.

If you are driving, it's a pretty easy place to overlook. When we got there it was packed, but I'm never one to complain if the food is good and the service is terrific...and this place accomplished both! For one, the menu is very simple. If you are looking for lots of variety in the menu, you are at the wrong place. For dinner they have dinner salads, one flavor of pizza that comes in two sizes (a veggie is available if asked), and something called ""oven grinders"" that come in six flavors. I forget how many appetizers there are but there isn't much either. But at this place less is not a bad thing! We ordered their Mediterranean Bread for an appetizer. Now there was only three of us, but we mistakenly misjudged how big the Mediterranean Bread was and we ordered two. Trust me, one can feed like four to six people and it was really good! For our main dish, we ordered the Pizza Pot Pie in a half pound (there is a full pound option). I'm the type of pizza eater that loves the crust, but this is one instance where I liked the inside more than the crust. The toppings, cheese, and sauce were excellent! The dough is very good too. It's a perfect portion of dough and ingredients. As for the service, it was very good. Our waiter was very patient, knew his drinks and beers, and was very nice.

All in all it was a good experience...not a place that yells ""you must come back soon,"" but a good place for comfort food when you're walking by and are hungry.

You can do the half pound, or the pound. If you're going to have appetizers beforehand, I would suggest getting the half pound (you'll be just fine!). So it's basically a pizza pot pie.

2009-07-12,4.0,"I have been coming here since I was younger. I really like pretty much everything on the menu, even if at one time I was allergic to the Mediterranean bread. It was very difficult as a child, coming here and not being able to eat the bread because I'd break out in hives. :( On that note, I am no longer allergic to the bread and BOY it is the reason that I am giving this place four stars. I come here fairly often, as it is one of my friend's favorite restaurants. We usually get the same exact thing every time: the Chef's Salad, Two orders of Mediterranean bread and a pizza pot pie. One time one of our ex-friends got a grinder, and we kind of looked at him like he was crazy. He enjoyed, but he's no longer our friend (regardless of the grinder, although that may have had something to do with it.)  The pairing of the house salad and the mediterranean bread is great-all of the dressings included with the salad are absolutely delicious on the bread. My favorite is putting the sour cream garlic on the bread-probably absolutely fattening and absolutely effing delicious. This last time that I went, I pretty much only ate the bread with the dressing. Oh, and also I stole a cheese filled olive. YUM! On to why everyone really comes here, is the pizza. Pot pie pizza. I remember when I was younger that I thought that this was the coolest thing in the world. It's super different, but I don't know if it is the coolest thing ever. To be honest, I just think that the sauce is ok-I get my pot pie with just mushrooms, no sausage. The sauce is really thick and I would prefer more cheese. I do like that you can get your pot pie either white or wheat, although last time the server didn't even ask, which was ok, since I was feeling in a white crust way. Also, the half pounder is a lot, especially if you are eating all of the extras beforehand. I took mine home and it was pretty good for lunch the next day, even if just warmed up in the microwave.  The wait is sometimes super long and I won't lie, it does creep me out that they don't write down names. I always feel like I might get cheated out of getting seated when I'm supposed to, so I just let other people handle that so I don't flip out on anybody. I would suggest, if you can, coming on a weekend night, pretty early, between 5 and 6. We only waited for about fifteen minutes and then sat down. I also wouldn't suggest coming with more than 5 people-it's pretty small and they can't really fit that many people at a table. And, it's easier to get seated quicker if you have less people. All in all, it's a once in awhile treat for a different type of pizza, but I don't go here every week. That would just be too much. It's kind of pricey as well, especially when you think about how you could probably make a bootleg version of this at your house, or hell, even make regular pizza at home and think that it tastes better.

We went there to make  an out-of-town guest happy, and I think that may be the last time I practice that kind of altruism. To begin with, it's insanely overpriced. $12.50 and up for an iceberg-lettuce  salad adorned with six canned olives, four small slices of canned artichoke heart and a couple of tomato wedges? Sure, it's big enough for more than one person to feed off of it, but come on. The menu is also very limited. Since I didn't want pizza or anything pizza-like, and I especially didn't want to pay more than $10 for something that was about the size equivalent of one slice of deep-dish pizza, there really wasn't much of anything there for me to eat.   The Mediterranean bread was tasty enough, and I had a couple of bites of the just-okay pizza pot pie thing.  I thought the sauce was bland, the crust unredemptive and I'm not even sure what it was stuffed with, other than a big button mushroom. I'm told there was sausage. I've had better at so many other pizza joints. We didn't even have to wait that long--about half an hour on a gorgeous Friday night. Maybe that's the key for those of you who like this place--go on a lovely night, when anyone who's got any sense is haunting their favorite sidewalk cafe.

2009-05-02,5.0,"WORTH THE WAIT!  One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.  Perhaps for the  novelty of it, but I do love their pizza pot pie. THE WAIT:  I arrived at 530pm on a Saturday and waited for 1 hour.  Here I thought I was missing the dinner rush but the place was packed as usual.  This is one place I don't mind waiting, though, especially in good company.   The entrance and bar area were crowded with people.  I waited for the host and he just asked me how many were in my party and then instructed me to wait by the bar.  My friends were concerned with how the host could possible remember our place in line, but I have complete faith.  I asked for a wine list at the bar, but they rattled off a generic selection that they offer.  I cannot do cheap wine since it often means instant headache, so I went with hard liquor instead. DINNER:  AMAZING!!   The Mediterranean bread always makes a great starter.  Their pizza pot pie never seize to amaze me.  It's so gooey and the sauce so delicious.  Don't expect to substitute a taste for deep dish pizza with a pizza pot pie because they are two very different creatures.  I love the sauce here and it's more like spaghetti sauce than pizza sauce. The only decision you have to make is whether you want a half pounder or a one pounder (a $21.50 one pounder costs the same as 2 $10.75 half pounder).  The pizza comes with sausage and door knob sized mushrooms that you can decline or pick off if you decide.   AMBIANCE:  It's dark and cozy.  The restaurant is pretty small and I wonder why they haven't expanded or open a new location. BATHROOM:  One per gender towards the back of the restaurant. PARKING:  There were plenty of street parking that's free. CASH only.",0.9961,0.789,0.186,0.025,0.5606427915518826

The Med Bread is good, we had the whole wheat for that and the pizza, but otherwise the overall meal was more novelty then worth the wait on weekends.  I was told 1.5 hours 1 saturday night and walked.  On a Tuesday night there was no wait, but there was not anything served that tasted like pizza. The sauce was very sub par, the crust was just ok, the service was good, and the gelato was very good- BUT I came here for the pizza, so mission very un-accomplished. At the end of the day if I am searching out simply good pizza, this location will not be on my radar. Note- CASH ONLY if you go.",0.9816,0.774,0.196,0.03,0.48900000000000005

The Mediterranean bread was as advertised.  A glorious flatbread loaded with herbs.  I could have eaten that all day. And the service was outstanding.  The waiters are very cheerful and attentive. But the pizza pot pie was a disappointment.  I wanted to love it.  But once it's plopped on your plate and you dig in, it just tastes like spaghetti.  The sausage is ground up in the sauce, so you've basically got this chunky meat sauce spread over a soft,chewy crust with a blob of melted mozzarella on the top.  It won't taste like pizza. So if it doesn't taste like pizza and you have to wait an hour to be seated, what's the point?  It's a unique dining experience, but one that goes quickly downhill after the novelty of the pot pie is unveiled.

Since she had been there a few times, she knew they would fill up pretty quickly, so we got there right at noon, which is when they open on Sundays. Sure enough, our table of 5 was seated right away - and at a booth large enough to fit us. She said the last time she came with 5 they got sat in a booth that is really only for 4 people, and it was pretty cramped.  Anyway, the service was good, attentive without being pushy, nothing was forgotten or overlooked. The food was pretty good. We got an order of Mediterranean Bread (one order was enough for 5) and a Chef Salad (one order was more than enough for us, we had a little bit left over). We all got a half-pound pizza pot pie, some with mushrooms only, some with sausage & mushrooms, some of white, some on wheat. It was pretty good. I liked the presentation, and the pie was hot and yummy. The mushrooms were fresh, and whole, no tiny mushroom slices that came from a can, so that was good.   I'll admit, I was expecting the pizza pot pie to be fantastic (considering my sister-in-law told us she once waited 2 hours for a table when she took another friend here), but it wasn't quite fantastic, but it was pretty yummy. If I came back, it would only be if I knew I would be seated right away. I really don't think it would be worth waiting for a very long time.

I kept telling my parents we just HAD to try chicago style pizza. In my mind, I was hoping to try Chicago's best deep dish pizza, but this definitely hit the spot! We walked in and the place was packed. I wasn't sure how the seating worked, so I asked someone who told me there was a guy walking around and to just wait. Soon enough, a man holding a notepad came up and asked how many. I was expecting him to give me a number or a pager or something, but just told me ok and to step aside to the bar area. I found it a little un-easy that he didn't give me anything, but I just hoped and prayed that he wouldn't forget about us. We waited for about half an hour and was finally seated. We ended up getting 2    1/2 lbs pizza pot pie and house salad. The two dressings they make, poppyseed and sour cream were heaven! Especially, when mixed.

A number of years back I had seen Chicago Pizza & Oven Grinder Co. on a Top 10 America's Best Pizza countdown on either the Food Network or the Travel Channel and was excited.  After being enlightened of a ""pizza pot pie"", I marked this place down as a must-go-to place for my next Chicago trip.  A cool side note is that the restaurant is located across the street from the location of the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre ( en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa… ).   I didn't have an excuse to visit Chicago until October 2008, when it was my chance to run the Chicago Marathon.  After DB & I landed and checked into the Marathon Expo and our hotel, we headed to Lincoln Park to try this mystical treat, along with her Chi-town friends.

We noticed that everyone around was ordering the Mediterranean flatbread, so that's what we started off with.  Not bad and pretty doughy.  The salad was nothing special.    Then our pizza pot pie entrees arrived.  The presentation was neat b/c they deliver it to you right-side-up so you can see that it is an actual pot pie.  They then flip it over and remove the ceramic bowl from the bottom.  You can see the Mozzarella cheese piled high.  Converse to a regular pie, they place the bottom crust first, then the cheese, then the tomato sauce, then the toppings, and then the top layer crust to form the pizza.   The pizza was really hot, but there was nothing novel when it came to the taste of the pot pie.  It was very filling though.  A small size satisfied two of us.  Unfortunately, taste-wise it didn't satisfy.

Lastly but certainly mostly, the legendary Pizza Pot Pie.  I have not ever met a person I took there who didn't immediately decide that this was, in fact, the best pizza concoction on the face of the planet.  Yup, pretty damn much.  The cheese is a rich buttery blend of fragrant and delicious cheesiness and the sauce is rich and homemade chunky with vegetables, while the crust is buttery, light, and doughy.  I can't speak to the meat as I'm a vegetarian, but the giant mushrooms you can get as a replacement for meat are impressive and meaty on their own.   The only sadness this restaurant brings for me is the fact that it's really starting to get well-known and as they don't take reservations that means even on off times I might be waiting 2 hours for a table.  But if you look around the packed restaurant on any given evening and ALL the people waiting for tables, you KNOW this is a damn good restaurant when people are HAPPY to wait for hours just to sit down.   Incredible.",0.9921,0.801,0.156,0.043,0.5860069444444445

Especially when you serve, like, 8-ounce glasses. 3) 90-degree wooden booth backs are hell on your back, and are made even more irritating by the fact that they're not anchored very well, so you get jostled every time the person behind you changes position.

Luckily, we did not have to sit near all of the waiting people, and we had a nice cozy table.  Now, as lovers of pizza of all sorts, we had really been looking forward to trying these pot pies.  However, I must say we were a bit disappointed.  They tasted fine, but were not really anything special.  Although I did enjoy the little show of having the waiter flip it over for us at our table, I must say that the pizza pot pie was our least favorite part of the meal. Now, the meal was a great experience.  Not knowing when we would make it in the restaurant again, we decided the to try the whole shabang with the bread, an antipasta salad, a pot pie, and a grinder.  The antipasta was to die for!  As our waiter had warned us, it is not really a salad, it is an antipasta plate full of delicious meats, cheeses, marinated mushrooms, peppers, etc.  It was wonderful.  I think our grinder would have been better had we ordered one made of deli meat only b/c the sausage one we got was a bit mushy from the marinara.   Their other salads looked amazing, and I think I'd like to go back and just order one of those along with the antipasta salad.  Our waiter was wonderful, and even added to the charm of the place since he appeared to be Italian himself.",0.9931,0.748,0.183,0.068,0.5433261183261183

No.  My friend loved the pizza pot pie, I thought it was too soft, no crust? it's there, it's not crunchy or thick, its runny and soft the way warmed dough is.  These pies are all alike, meat or veg are your options, served in a full or half pound serving.  Cost difference is $10.95-$20.95.. The half serving is enough for a single, I couldn't finish mine, but that was due to the bread appetizer I'd ordered.  Alike a big wide piece of naan or pita bread with assorted green herbs and seasonings served warm and fluffy, about a 1/4"" thick.  They suggested it going well with a salad, glad I didn't, it was already too much food for myself.  I needed something to dip it in, though they don't have marinara sauce or any other kind of dipping sauce.

Each one of us ordered a wheat pizza pot pie with meat and mushrooms, and it was excellent.  It came out pretty quickly, and since we didn't fill up too much on appetizers, each of us were able to polish off our half-pound pies - though I wonder what kind of doorknobs they're comparing their mushrooms too...these were pretty average sized shrooms.  They had a lot of flavor, especially when you sprinkle some of the seasoning that they bring out for the bread on it.

There are some quirks that you should be aware of with CP&OG... As other reviewers have mentioned, this place always has a wait.  And, as other reviewers have mentioned, the ""system"" that is in place to keep track of the queue is truly unique - it really is done by memory.  It would be impossible to know how well the host remembers the order of the patrons... but the last time I went three groups of two were seated before us even though they had arrived after we had.  It wasn't a big deal; you are going to wait a long time, and the difference between 45 minutes and an hour is really meaningless.  Nonetheless, be prepared for this very unusual feature of the restaurant.  Also, be aware of the fact that the restaurant only takes cash.  This is worth keeping in mind because you can spend a lot of money on drinks while you wait an hour for your table!

Went a second time with a group of my girlfriends for my birthday weekend.  It was late and very close to closing time, but they accommodated us anyway.  The service was good cuz there weren't many people, but I ain't mad.  The food was outstanding!  My friends are still talking about the pot pie.  They absolutely loved it!  I want to go back so bad, but I'm afraid I'll get addicted and eat so much that I will be as big as a house!  Can't have that ... gotz to say fit and sexy for the hubby.",0.9902,0.745,0.204,0.051,0.5596774193548386

Absurdly, they don't take credit cards.  This is appalling to me.  I understand if you have a small family joint, or traffic in low price items, but the place has a consistent line out the door and what I would imagine is an average per person bill in the range of $15-$20.  I think CPOG can afford the few credit card percentage points, especially for what they are charging for freaking bread. Even more absurdly, they charge for pop refills.  For full disclosure, I am a complete diet soda junky.  When dining at a restaurant, I will consume several glasses at a minimum.  I know it's not a good thing, but it's who I am.  Now, fountain soda pop is almost universally the highest margin item in the restaurant industry.  It literally costs them pennies per serving.  This is why all decent human beings give you free refills when you pay around 2 bucks for a glass.  The folks behind CPOG are not said decent people.  They are dirty rotten money grubbing a-holes.  They give you a tiny glass to begin with (maybe 10 oz.), load it up with ice, and then charge you $1.75 every time you get a  refill.  Our waitress never bothered to inform me of this.  When I brought this to her attention upon receiving the bill, she said ""Oh, I'm sorry, I usually tell everyone."" Like I said, the food is okay, but I cannot get over the myriad of issues I have with this place.  Given just one or two, I would be able to stomach it, but combining them all, I can't say I'll be back to CPOG unless it's against my will.  Why anyone would wait large stretches of time (as folks apparently so often do here) is beyond me.",-0.9628,0.821,0.074,0.105,0.5667404354904356

2007-11-29,5.0,"This is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.  It's so unique in so many ways.  Even though at times you are forced to wait 1-2 hours to get seated, the wait is well worth it for the amazing food! I love how the owner/host doesn't take down names and he is just able to remember the order of the people waiting.  He is so friendly and always pleasant whenever I come.  And he gave me a free meditteranean bread because I was raving about it to my friends.   While you wait you can order a glass of wine and stand or sit at the bar.  The glasses of wine are not your typical 5 oz pours like other hoity toity restaurants in the city where you pay $10-12.  These are filled to the top buckets of wine for right around $7.  Amazing! Once you get a seat, you must order the meditteranean bread.  It's a freshly made piece of flat bread with a special blend of spices.  So delicious.  I would also recommend ordering a salad and they are served with their 2 homeade dressing that you mix together for a completely different and unique flavor.  I've never ordered anything but the pizza pot pies and I probably never will.  You get 4 choices when ordering these....1/2 lb or 1 lb, wheat or white, vegetarian or meat sauce, mushrooms or no mushrooms.  That's all, plain and simple, but yet so great!  They are brought out and they look somewhat like a mushroom on the tray and then the server scoops out the pie and flips it over to reveal melted cheese and saucy goodness.  **They are very careful if you are a vegetarian to make sure that the spoon used to scoop out the pies does not go into a meat sauce first and then a veggie one, as to not cross contaminate.  If they do make that mistake, they will make you a new one, no questions asked.   I have taken many friends and family members to this place and they have all been impressed!  You definitely need to go and try it!",0.9937,0.798,0.171,0.031,0.5980743730743731
2007-11-17,5.0,"So I'm flipping channels the other week and I came across a special on the Best Pizza in America (I think it was on the Travel channel?)--and they mentioned that Chicago Pizza and Oven Grinder had these great, unique ""pizza pot pies."" How could I resist that? I planned a trip for the next weekend. I definitely recommend going between the lunch and dinner rush hours if you're going on a Saturday--we showed up about 3:30 and only had to wait about 30 minutes (everyone after us was told 45). The host (who I assume may have also been the owner) never took anyone's name, but remembered every party in order. Like clockwork, when our wait was up, he came and brought us to our table. The atmosphere is so unique--it's decorated like a German ski lodge with tons of logs and wooden booths, etc. We (my sister and I) got the Mediterranean Bread to start: a huge disk of dough--comes in either white or whole wheat, we chose wheat--covered in all sorts of herbs. It's their most popular menu item, and I can definitely see why! Next, we split a half-pounder Pizza Pot Pie (sans mushrooms--and which also comes in white or wheat, we got white this time b/c the server said the wheat crust is noticeably thicker): The cheese and sauce (which was a rich, meaty sauce--absolutely made my day!) are baked in a dish separately from the crust, which is essentially a big pizza crust bread bowl. The crust is placed on top of the dish like a mushroom cap and then inverted. The server spoons the cheese/sauce into the bread bowl and also cut it in half for us. Seriously--some of the best pizza EVER (and I'm extremely picky when it comes to pizza). The flavor is amazing and I love (LOVE) the meat sauce! My sister and I were both stuffed at the end, but were able to finish everything so we didn't have to cart leftovers around town. Each of us got a soda too, and our total bill was only 23 dollars and change--worth every penny.",0.9957,0.834,0.159,0.007,0.4834869431643625

However if you really want to get the most for your bucks, I suggest getting a grinder.

You can't chage the ingredients they throw into this pot-pie looking thing, but I can say without a doubt in my mind that this had the BEST ingredients I've ever had in a pizza.

Its located in the Lincoln Park community, which tends to be a comfortable neighborhood: diverse. I didn't sense that here at all! As a matter of fact it was like we were under the microscope. I ordered a vegetarian grinder and was so displeased. The only vegetable contained in the grinder were three small mushrooms. No onions, peppers or any other veggies. The sauce was good and so was the cheese, but I wanted vegetable as part of the order. I would suggest they not refer to it as a vegetarian dish. I would never consider inviting any of my friends to this place.....and I will pass the message onward. First by posting my experience their and secondly by encouraging my friends not to go.  The seating was the pits. I was afraid my knees where going to knock my friends off if I didn't seat completely erect. without the ability to move, the entire time, the seating was very uncomfortable.  What makes this place popular is a mystery to me. Not every black man is a thug, criminal suspect, or a danger to society. Some of us are educated, hard working, intelligent, law abiding men who add decency to our American culture. Such a pity.

It's dimly lit and everything is made out of wood - the walls, the booths, the bar, the tables. Very rustic. It's a unique environment and unless you are lucky enough to be seated in one of the three tables in the front it can feel a little claustrophobic.  I've only ever had 2 things off the menu. First there is the Mediterranean bread. Carb watchers, stay clear! It basically looks like a pizza crust brushed with olive oil and then sprinkled with various herbs. Sounds simple, but you have to try it. So good! Then there are the cute, little bowls of cheesy goodness known as the pizza pot pie. They come in half-pound and pound sizes and with meat sauce or vegetarian. I always get the half-pound vegetarian with whole mushrooms. It's definitely not your typical pizza. It comes in a bowl and they turn it upside down and out pops your pot pie. The sauce is very flavorful and the cheese is extra gooey. Perfect.  The service can be hit or miss.

Got there around 7pm on Thursday July 5th and was told by the man in the blue shirt that there was a 40 minute wait for my party of four.  Although I expected a wait, I didn't expect the host to remember our name and where to find us... and trust me, I had my doubts... but a mere 20 minutes of sitting at the bar, he found us to take us to our table!   From then, service was very prompt and friendly.  We ordered a small Greek salad and Mediterranean Bread and four half pound Pizza Pot Pies! The salad was fantastic and served four perfectly!  But WOW, the Mediterranean Bread is soooooooo good! Draping way over the plate, the table acts more as a holder than the plate itself!  Soo soft and warm, perfectly covered with various Mediterranean herbs.  I can't imagine anybody not ordering a bread for the table. Then our pot pies arrived!  I personally enjoyed the presentation... they come on a tray looking like mushroom caps, then spooned out of the bowl to your plate in one quick movement.  I'm not a fan of mushrooms and ordered mine without the four huge shrooms.  I was expecting this pie to be greasy, but it wasn't at all!  The crust was a good thickness and chewy, no flakiness at all.  Sauce was very tasty!  From here on out, all my visits to Chicago will include a meal at the Chicago Pizza & Oven Grinder!  Oh Chicago how I love thee!",0.9954,0.814,0.165,0.021,0.5314102564102563

ALSO, I appreciate the fact that their wheat dough is tastier than their white dough, and that their mushrooms are fresh and GINORMOUS. ALSO, ditto what everyone has said about the Mediterranean bread, DELISH! The wheat bread version of that is also very good. Even the water was good & lemony.  Oh, but they charge you for every individual glass of soda you order. I don't drink soda, but the bf does, and that is just ridiculous... who still does that nowadays??

2007-05-29,2.0,"We went here for dinner last night with two other couples, and all I can say is, ""Meh.""  Yea, I said it.  ""M-E-H.""   The food was fine, but a little different.  I could see having one of these weird pizza bread bowls every once in a while, but it's nothing that I need to go out of my way to find.  The bread was great - but it's way too salty. My main problem with this place are the insane rules and regulations they place on diners.  It's kind of like the soup nazi episode on Seinfeld. I mean, come on.  It's a business and if your customers are asking for something, I would oblige.  Two main points. 1)The bread.  I alluded above that the bread is salty.  It is.  It's the perfect sort of appetizer that would be complemented by a side of marinara sauce for dipping.  Being an Italian restaurant, the place obviously has some extra laying around.  Hell, even charge me $1 extra for it.  Somehow - we were told that it's ""against the rules"" and they won't give it out.  Our waiter was actually very apologetic and said he wishes they could - but it's not allowed.  No explanation.  No logical reasons.  They just won't give it to you.  The bread needs it.  The bread is meant for it!  Just a pointless rule.  It's not charming, it's just dumb. 2) Cash only.  I knew this going in and made a special trip to the ATM, but I pay cash for vending machines, parking meters and cabs (when I'm forced because the cab driver is breaking the law by not accepting credit cards - another rant for another post.)  In 2007 an establishment in the third largest city in America (especially somewhere that is going to have at minimum a $30 tab for two people) should take credit cards.  If this was a third world country or dealt in amounts of $3 and under, I could see the cash only policy.  It just is something I prefer not to deal with. I'm glad I at least got to experience this place firsthand, and there wasn't a wait for our table.  If I would have experienced a long wait for this place, I would have been upset.   Sorry for the long, ranting review.",-0.9535,0.816,0.071,0.113,0.5352017195767194

The Mediterranean bread is ok but really to me it tasted like a saltine with a lot of stuff on top, and a little too salty for my tastes. It was ok but I'm not doing cartwheels about it. I wish there was some marinara sauce for dipping. I got a vegetarian pizza pot pie. The pot pies SOUND like a good idea but to me, it's basically pizza soup in a crust bowl. I was hoping for more veggies and not just the regular sauce sans meat. The cheese is good and I love big honkin' mushrooms, but I would've preferred them sliced. Service was ok enough, no real complaints there. I guess I may be super picky about pizza but this place is more gimmick than anything to me. Just my opinion!

Yes, that means no large small or large, hence why coming here with a friend and splitting everything is key. Their pizza is more of a pot pie.
