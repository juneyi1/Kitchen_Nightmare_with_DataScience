The Hunan beef was fine, but despite ordering it ""very spicy"", I couldn't detect any heat. The moo goo gai pan worked for my boyfriend but I thought it had a strange aftertaste.

Favorite dishes are the shrimp with walnut, the salt and pepper shrimp, and the BBQ spare ribs! should definitely try it.

It also came with shrimp fried rice which tasted pretty good but the shrimp were so little I barely even noticed they were there, literally. Customer service was garbage. I called in my order and she pretty much cut me off the entire time as if she was too busy and had other things to do. I didn't even get to tell her my drink choice because she cut me off and told me to ""pick a pop when you come in"" and then hung up. I asked her about my shrimp being dry and she said it's just because I have a different taste.... Whatever that means and refused to do anything about my dissatisfaction. My boyfriend ordered the pepper steak which was soaked in what tasted like grease or a bunch of oil. The egg rolls were fried in a thick breading almost like empanada breading and really greasy.

Pot stickers were the same usual bland ,wet junk people in Logan Square have come to expect. Egg roll was surprisingly bad as well (don't know how you can screw that up).

You can tell it was made the usual lackluster way of soaking it completely in soy sauce until it almost turned completely black, but it wasn't terrible.         This was my first time trying hot and sour soup.
