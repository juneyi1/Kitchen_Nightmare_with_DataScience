2017-08-30,5.0,"I stopped in for a quick bite and a glass of wine. Upon entering I was very impressed with the room. Gorgeous architecture and history is very evident in every detail.  Although the hostess was lacking in any personality or courtesy, the General Manager, Head Server and our actual Server were attentive and professional. They were friendly and personable, which added a warm touch to our experience.  They offer a great Happy Hour. We tried two delicious wines and sliders from that menu. The slider bun was soft and squishy and the sauce had a hint of horseradish. We also added shrimp cocktail that was fresh and delicious. Lastly we tried the crab cakes and were equally impressed.  I cannot wait to visit again before cold weather arrives. Their outdoor patio/garden is just as incredible as the dining room. Shrubbery with tiny lights coupled with white tablecloth service creates an atmosphere of your own personal backyard.

They were good, nothing wildly out of the ordinary.  The service was exceptional.  As soon as you finished a drink, someone was there to refill it or run to the bar to get you another.  As soon as you put a straw on the table, it was snatched away.  The minute your plate was finished a smiling face removed it from the table. I really haven't experienced attentive service like that in years.  Everyone was talking about it next day.  So, while I can't comment on what a regular diner experiences, I can recommend them for a group without hesitation.",0.9276,0.878,0.122,0.0,0.44512820512820517

They have kept the shell original and it is beautiful when you arrive.  The interior is just as beautiful, large, beautifully decorated rooms, big comfy chairs and oval booths. We were seated in a booth.  Our water, Ralph, is on top of his game and made great recommendations to make sure we had the best dining experience possible.   The chef's special appetizer was a crab stack salad with avocado mouse and was out of this world. Jerry had the 14 oz. rib eye and I had the crab cake appetizer as an entrée.  Our sides were the au gratin potatoes with truffle (OMG!) and sautéed spinach.  Everything was delightful, perfectly cooked and tasty.   We would definitely return and can't wait to do so.  Oh, and if Ralph's mother Christina ever reads this, Ralph is great at his job and definitely knows what he's doing. Make sure you tour the entire building it's just beautiful. The banquet rooms are even special.  Lovely restaurant!  Highly recommended!",0.9964,0.718,0.272,0.009,0.6807730746619636

2017-07-30,3.0,"Good: The food was good. We had shrimp cocktail, caesar salad, tomato burrata, 8 oz filets, sauteed spinach, potatoes au gratin, french fries, and key lime pie with decaf. All were well prepared and met expectations. Although I would have chosen a fuller flavored coffee. Meh: Service was a little dismissive. We go to high priced restaurants enough, but here we felt like we were viewed as first-time visitors to the big city, even though we live only blocks away. When we ordered a bottle of wine, the waiter tried to up-sell us from a $40 bottle to a $52 label that in his words was from a better family (a pretty snooty answer)--not a very good reason to judge how wines will taste. When asked to describe The Tower appetizer, waiter's description was short: ""it's on ice. ""Throughout the meal our waiter was technically efficient, just not very friendly, not much interested in talking with us, and he was a fast talker at that. He also seemed to be interested in taking our order and ""moving us along"" at a pace faster than we would have chosen for a $285 dinner for two. This was a Saturday evening, 7pm, the restaurant was just over half full. We were seated in the ""breakfast room"" which was nice because of the daylight and all the windows. The dining room, darker of course, seemed to be serving a higher caliber of folk than the likes of us. Final opinions: This is not the pre-fire Firehouse, which had an almost indescribable charm, and a wait staff who treated you like royalty even if you had saved up to dine there. While the food was good, it was not worth the price. We've spent the same (or less) at Gibson's, or Tavern on Rush, and had equally good (or better) steaks (and friendlier service).",0.9913,0.792,0.164,0.044,0.49396608767576505

2017-07-12,4.0,"Having lived across the street from here for nine years, I was a frequent visitor who sat in the bar.  They still to this day had the best baby octopus I've had anywhere and that's saying something!  However, the chef is different from who they had pre-fire (pix posted).  In fact, everything is quite different starting with entering on 14th instead of Michigan.  The dining area is wide open now which is preferred to the dark decor the old restaurant had.  They also have a sunroom, which would be great to sit in if I wasn't sitting at the modern oval-shaped bar.  Both of the guys behind the bar were outstanding and Lance, the manager, was wonderful as well.  I think the service has even been stepped up since reopening.  Another huge improvement: the bathrooms.  No more single room facilities with a line waiting.  The ladies' is very clean and has like eight stalls in it.  The bathrooms were one of my least favorite things about the old space.  Also no upstairs dining room (which I never liked to sit in).  Upstairs is now only for private events and looks nice.  What is on the downside is the patio is probably only about a third of the size of the old one.  It's unfortunate but then it does have the sunroom so it's a give and take on that.  Another improvement is the addition of happy hour specials.  From 4-6 there are cheap drinks and snacks.  The snack sizes are perfect! We started with the fish tacos (per Lance's recommendation) and chicken sandwiches.  The fish tacos had an aioli that was just killer.  I mean like one of the best aiolis I've ever had good.  The first was halibut (I just don't care for tilapia but will do cod or halibut) and fried lightly and not greasy.  The only thing missing was a nice slaw but for $6, these were outstanding and came with two.  The chicken sandwiches were just okay.  I liked the addition of honey but other than that they were quite dry.  Although again, for the price point not bad at all.  I had to try the octopus and it was not as good as the old one, but not bad either.  It was a tad chewy but had a great char and smokiness.  The chorizo that accompanied was super tasty.  The foie was very good.  The preparation was a pate, which was a great texture.  However, they really needed more cherries on top to balance it.  They gave a tangerine slice, which wasn't bad but didn't pair nearly as well as the two cherries that came with.  If they just put a few more cherries on the plate, I think it would be much better.  Also, they only take one half piece of bread and cut that in half.  For the amount of foie, we had to ask for more bread, which they brought.  But they should just put at least one full piece of bread on the plate to start with.  But the dish was tasty.  We also got the lamb lollipops.  The relish on top is amazing and the quality of the lamb was wonderful as it was very tender.  The only miss here was that when asked how we wanted it cooked, we of course said medium rare and he agreed that is what the chef recommends.  So why it came out clearly medium is beyond me.  I understand these are small pieces of meat but I never have trouble cooking mine to medium rare at home.  So a few small flaws but overall, back and perhaps even better than the original!",0.9988,0.762,0.197,0.042,0.5695112044817926

It had been refired.  Now I had a dry hockey puck!  Not wanting to make a scene in front of my book club members, I accepted the dry piece of meat.  I had the peppercorn crust which did not help at all with the taste.

There are four different kinds of cheese inside the sandwich (Brie, cheddar, Parmesan, and provolone).  I'm a huge cheese lover, but this sandwich was a bit much.  I ended up eating a very light dinner later.  The soups are really good here. I suggest the French onion soup or the cream of mushroom with truffle seasoning.  They have two different sizes  (small or big) The big size can be filling for a lunch meal.

2017-04-22,5.0,"This was my first time eating at Chicago Firehouse. It just reopened about 8 weeks ago, after being badly damaged by a fire, and completely rebuilt. They did an incredible job with the renovations. It's a beautiful place. The front room has a classic old-school look, while the rear addition is clean and modern. The middle room is a bit crowded (tables close together) but the rest of the restaurant feels very open. The high ceilings help. Upstairs there are very nice private rooms, and they plan to open a balcony this summer. I also love the atmosphere -- it's both casual and classy, if that makes sense. The patrons were dressed mostly casual (I felt perfectly comfortable wearing jeans and a sweater) but the servers wear nice white jackets and are very professional.  Moving on from the physical environment... The cocktails we had were good, and not too expensive (there were quite a few for $10 or $11, which, sadly, seems ""cheap"" these days). We had a caesar salad and oxtail onion soup -- both were outstanding. Our main dishes were salmon and skirt steak. The salmon was very good, and reasonably priced. We got the skirt steak mostly because the other steaks were very expensive; skirt steak was mid-$20s, the others were all over $40. Aside from the steaks, I'd say this is a $$ restaurant, but the steak prices push it up to $$$. The skirt steak was just ok. It is soy-marinated, which gives it a pretty overpowering soy flavor. It was properly cooked. We also had an excellent side of grilled asparagus. One dessert -- the key lime pie -- was incredible. Probably the best I've ever had. The other -- rum cheesecake -- was disappointing.  What makes it a 5-star rating for me was the service. The servers were extremely professional, knowledgeable about the menu, very attentive, and friendly. The service was definitely ""as good as it gets.""

Our group of 4 was put into a booth were we waited 5 min before seeing our server.  I ordered the bisque, which is still as yummy as I remember, with the goat cheese salad. The salad was coated in a heavy vinaigrette which was so vinegary it was not edible. When they came to clear the plates the waiter asked if I wanted the salad boxed and I told him it had way too much dressing. He nicely apologized but didn't ask anyone else if they liked their food. Only 1 person cleared their plate everyone else only ate half. I would have expected the waiter to at least ask if we enjoyed the meal especially with so much food left untouched.  The manager nicely came over to ask if I wanted another salad but his demeanor was appalling. He leaned against the wall with hand on hip and said I heard you didn't like your food. I felt like I was being scolded.  Then a ring was dropped under the table. We pulled the table out and had to get under the booth trying to find the ring. 4 staff members stood 10 feet away and watched us.  Not one offered any assistance.  I hope this was an effect of Monday night service, so I'm still giving 3 stars. Plus I used to love the firehouse so I want to see it be successful.

Amish brick chicken: my brother-in-law had that and said it was good but he has had better brick chicken at bionda's Grilled swordfish: my son-in-law said it was very good Skirt steak My wife and my sister-in-law both had the skirt steak they said it was  good but I do not take their recommendations.

We both had the oxtail/onion soup, which had a rich beef flavor and very tasty caraway crust with melted gruyere on top.  French onion soup.  I had the crab cakes, which are listed under Appetizers, and my companion had the pork porterhouse steak with polenta and maple bourbon glaze.  The port would have been enough for two, and was very tender and flavorful.  The glaze set it off perfectly.  My crab cakes were just OK--I've had better.   This is essentially an old-school steakhouse.  The drinks menu even offered cocktails that were popular in the 60's!  Just for old times sake we ordered two of them:  a Rob Roy and a cuba libra.  I remembered why I haven't ordered a cuba libra since I was about 18, and pushed it away.  We were there on a weeknight, and by the time we left the restaurant was packed.  I think a lot of people are tired of eating in sports bars, which are the dominant South Loop eateries because of all our college students.  But it's not cheap--considering we had two drinks, two soups, an appetizer and an entree, our bill with tax and before tip was $95!",0.9333,0.859,0.091,0.05,0.47687074829931975

You can tell they all treat this place like you are a guest in their house, not customers at their restaurant. Even some of the customers are great. Harvey, a regular was gracious, pleasant and friendly to us, even so we took his regular spot to sit. This place is a lovely date night place or a place to gather with friends.

2017-02-22,4.0,"The Chicago Firehouse is just that, and a charming building/restaurant that just recently reopened after ironically burning down some years ago.  The building is a classic Chicago style firehouse architecture, lovingly updated by the owners to be comfortable, welcoming and respectful to the style and period of the building yet with an updated contemporary feel. If I had to guess I would say the original building is circa 1900 - 1910ish.  The pride of ownership shows in the details. High tin ceilings, period light fixtures, fireplaces large arched windows, beautiful bar area, comfortable booths and tables indoors and outdoor seasonal dining.  Most of the original staff returned and they are pros, polite seasoned and efficient.  The food was good solid fare, no disappointments. The Chicken was moist and tasty.

It important for all to know that it is a very limited menu for us because we do not eat red meat but what they offered in seafood and poultry was great!  The service was on par with what we had experienced in the past and have come to expect from the Firehouse.  Carly was our server and she was fantastic, really nice, excited about the offerings and very knowledgeable about the menu making great suggestions.  The cocktails and wines are wonderful and paired well with our meals.  Our daughter, Sara preferred my Valentine cocktail to hers and Carly replaced it immediately and took it off the bill.   The Brick Chicken was wonderful, butter mashed potatoes were decadently rich and did not disappoint and the wedge salad had the best blue cheese buttermilk dressing I've had.   Sara ordered the Sole Fish and they (expertly) filleted table-side and it was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The grilled asparagus was as good as ever and the dessert was a wonderful ending to a delicious, well-served dinner.   I miss the former dining rooms, especially the old bar room in the front but I must admit that the dining rooms are beautiful, classic and well-appointed.

It was reinvented with elegance and is perfect for people who like to dine in leisure. We sat in a plush booth. Natural light flooded through the wall of windows on the west side and twinkled off of copper and brass details. As much as I loved that large window and the other windows around the space I wonder if they attributed to the harsh chill? It was very cold in the restaurant and I kept on as many layers that I would ordinarily remove inside. The bathroom is especially cold. It's small and vintage - just one toilet facing the sink and extremely high ceiling. We each enjoyed the side salad, soup, and sandwich special. Mine was the Second or Third Alarm which included a cup of Lobster Bisque. My friend got the First Alarm which had the French Onion Soup. All of the food was really delicious. Even the side salad had quality greens and tasty dressing. We both got the Turkey Sandwich which was scrumptious! It had freshly sliced turkey on a soft baguette. Since I was so cold I chose to get a warm cocktail as well. I opted for the Kentucky Bluebird for $9. My friend hated it but I thought it was good. I liked the taste of the tea mingled with the whiskey and sweet amaretto. Service was good. It was prompt, cordial, and helpful.

Restaurant was completely empty and actually remained that way until we left. With the lack of customers you would assume our waitress would have been attentive. After taking our order bread was brought to our table. No butter or jams.  I would have loved to ask for some but our waitress didn't come back to the table for quiet some time. I saw her aimlessly walking around a few times(I believe her name was Donika). So I ordered the rib eye steak cooked medium with eggs over medium. Steak, completely blue in the middle. Eggs, over hard. I sent the steak back and when he cooked it some more it was fine. But to cook it so poorly the first time... My husband ordered the short rib hash. 95% of the meat was just fat.  And for the good pieces it had no flavor. Salt and pepper please!!! There was  nothing good about this experience.

2014-11-08,2.0,"Chicago Firehouse has a wonderful atmosphere and a great ambiance. However, I was ultimately disappointed with my meal and will not go back.  I started off with the lobster bisque. The pastry on top makes for a nice presentation but didn't add anything to the flavor.  Texturally the bisque was better without eating the pastry part.  The broth was flavorful.  However, the pieces of lobster I had were just okay. The texture was a bit off.  The rest of the table ordered steak but I was the lone ranger ordering seafood.  I think that was my mistake. I ordered the scallops.  First off, it was a small portion and there were only four medium sized scallops (especially for $34!).  Aside from a small portion, half of my scallops were overcooked.  When scallops are overcooked, they get rubbery and tough.  It was not appetizing. I was hungry enough so I ate most of my dish.  In hindsight, I should have flagged a server down and sent the dish back. That is hard to do at your dining companions' favorite spot and in any event our server didn't check on us until much farther into the meal. Although my meal was poorly executed, my husband's steak (the filet trio) and sides were very good.  The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and is the saving grace for this review. The drinks were okay. The red wine that we had was excellent and a good value. My husband had an Old Fashioned cocktail that he did not like - it was bitter and not balanced. Although he did not order a second, they brought him another one when the rest of the table ordered another cocktail and charged us for it.  It was an expensive average-at-best meal.

It tasted very gamey and reminded me of deer or bison.  I am sure they served me beef, but the flavor was unexpected and off putting and I was not a fan.  Also I have never seen so much fat on a filet before. That being said the texture was nice.  My dad, like I said earlier had the calms for an app and said they were really good and had nice flavor.  He had he Amish brick chicken and said it was good but not amazing or anything.  We ended our meal with the vanilla bean cheesecake which was the highlight for me.  The berry coulee was very refreshing and the cheesecake had a great flavor and texture.  Overall if I lived in the area I probably wouldn't eat here again. I am sure there are other better steak houses around. That being said though, if your a visitor like I was, the firehouse is great because of it's uniqueness.",0.9546,0.753,0.15,0.097,0.6178544061302681

I had the lobster bisque and the filet, both were absolutely amazing.  The filet was perfectly cooked and tender.  One of my co-workers got the pork chops, and those had to have been the best looking pork chops I've ever seen.   What you can't miss though is the pineapple upside down cake dessert!  It doesn't matter if you're too full to try- you have to make room because it is that good.  It comes out warm and melts in your mouth.

I, myself, am I firefighter, which makes it even more odd (in my eyes) that I never made it to the restaurant.  Walking in was really neat for me, because you can still sort of tell where everything had been when the place was used as a firehouse many years ago. I spent the first half hour looking up and around, pointing things out to my fiancee about the house and where things would have been and where the guys would have lived and what not. I felt like a fake tour guide, talking about a place, that really, I knew absolutely nothing about. I was just talking about what I imagined it would have been like. Long story short, I loved the feel of the place and the decor! (Including the old school tin ceiling). I can't remember what my fiancée ate, but I know I had steak. You don't go to a place that is know for it's steak and don't get the steak! It was pretty good. I'm a medium rare guy, but I would say the steak was definitely more medium to medium-well than anything, which dried it out a little bit and made it slightly tougher to chew. It's the only reason I took off a star. I'm sure that it doesn't happen often that a steak is slightly overcooked, I was just one of the unlucky few! I really enjoyed our server, I can't remember her name off the top of my head, I just remember her having COMPLETE knowledge of the menu and a wonderful personality.

My favorite thing was the lox but instead of serving it with bagels they served it along with some pumpernickel bread which was an interesting twist.

That is the lone positive I have to say.  I'll start with the service. 1 waitress for 29 people. She also didn't speak English particularly well and there were multiple mistakes made. The second server just delivered food. Taking orders took almost 25 minutes.  1). My drink took a half hour to get and was warm when it arrived. They also forget the garnish. The waitress was unavailable to get Me a new one because she was too overwhelmed.  2) I was unable to flag her down to get another drink and had to continually walk downstairs to get a drink. No one once seemed to find this odd.  3) My water war refilled once in two hours   4). It took us 50 minutes to get bread.  5) My soup had skin on it it was so cold. There was no waitress available to take it back.  6). They gave me the wrong steak. I couldn't return it because there was no server to check on us.  7). All sides were inedibly cold. We couldn't complain due to not having a server in the room.  8). Drinks were undersized and poorly made.  9)  Coffee was never refilled.

Dominika (sp?), our server, was friendly and recommended excellent drinks and food throughout the evening.  She and all of the wait staff were attentive and gracious.  We shared the lobster bisque, which was rich and creamy with a perfect puff pastry lid.  My wife had the smaller filet mignon, which came with an out-of-this-world reduction sauce and a few nicely crisped onion rings for garnish.  I had the flight of three medallions with different toppings, which was definitely in the ""awesome"" zone - melted in the mouth with deep, rich, flavors.  I don't know why anyone would order steak of this quality cooked past medium or even medium rare, which was perfect for these cuts.  One tiny bit of wonder is that these dishes do come out pretty Spartan looking - no garnish on the flight, but colorful toppings made it not a big issue for me. The garlic whipped potatoes were about the best I've ever tasted with gobs of all the right ingredients smoothly blended into heavenly delight -- not for the diet conscious!  One order of the pineapple upside down cake for desert was delicious and enough to satisfy both of us, and finally, they comped us two glasses of champagne to toast our anniversary!  So, maybe we got lucky and all the stars aligned last night to make it a 5 star experience - we'll be back soon to try again!",0.9966,0.781,0.204,0.014,0.6264606551840594

This place was recommended by a couple different people and was considered a Chicago ""institution"".  This place is def nice and luxurious on the inside but the horrendous food they try to pass off as a high end dining experience is another story. I decided to go with the steak I ordered it medium rare when it got to the table I cut into it to discover it was the consistency of the hockey puck that was used during game 4 of the Stanley cup finals. I immediately told the waiter that my steak was extremely overcooked and unacceptable and he was very professional and courteous and said he would bring out another one ASAP. Ok folks I understand mistakes can happen but this is supposed to be a so called ""high end"" steak house that charges $60.00 a steak how is it possible to not get the temperature of the steak correct??? The second steak that he brought out left me utterly speechless it was RAW you could still see the marks on it from where the jockey was hitting it!!!! The chef must have gotten offended that I sent the steak back and probably purposely found the worst cut of steak he could so he could get back at me for disrespecting his culinary skill. Let me tell you folks I have had better steaks at outback ( and thats not saying much) The steak was loaded with fat and only 1/3 of it was even edible it was more like steak tar tar it was so raw!! I also had the baked stuffed potatoes and they were horrid they taste like they were pre frozen and were extremely bland.  This shit hole basically ruined my first Chicago dinning experience and left me pretty pissed off and disappointed. If I wasn't with other people I probably would have asked to speak with the manager and told him how awful my experience was. God damn $100.00 for a raw steak and some half ass salad????? Firehouse should be ashamed of themselves for trying to pass off that trash as high end food. Needless to say I will NEVER spend another dime in this dump again!! Anyone who has ever been to a real steak house knows that this place is a sham!! I hope this shit hole folds like origami!! Good thing there isn't a Morton's close by or this place would've been out of business a long time ago!! How ironic would it be if the firehouse caught on fire and burned to the ground!!

The patio is amazing, can't wait to go back and sip some drinks.  The menu has a little something for everyone. The lobster bisque was absolutely divine, one of my favorites with lots of lobster! The salads were also large and full of flavor, their house salad was full of fresh veggies. The caprese salad really stood out and I am not a fan of tomatoes. The drinks were a little on the pricey side but I stuck with wine all night and they had a pretty impressive wine list for a steak focused joint. I recommend any of the fillets. The trio gives you a pretty good taste of everything, they also give you the option to order the steaks blue which is very rare but only offered in the best steakhouses. Pay attention to the fish specials though, four out of the 6 in our group ordered this amazing fish (which of course I can't remember the name of) and it was out of this world.

Service: Excellent.  On point and timely.  We originally ordered the scallops and were told that the remaining scallops were not up to the chef's standards and would prefer not to serve them so we changed the order to the fillet flight.  However, my wife had already ordered a glass of white wine and preferred to have red with her meal.  A glass of red wine was promptly brought out when this was brought to the waiter's attention.  From beginning to end, the service was up to the level you expect for a classic Chicago steakhouse. Food & Drinks: We had cocktails at the bar while we waited for an outdoor table.  The bartender made a perfect sidecar, which I really appreciate as too many places make a sidecar with too much citrus and not enough cognac.  We had crab cakes for appetizer, new York strip, fillet flight (originally ordered scallops, see above), au gratin potatoes, and market vegetables (carrots, zucchini, green beans).  Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The charred parts of the steak were especially flavorful as a result of perfect searing of the outside.

2013-07-14,1.0,"We dined here last night for our wedding anniversary.  We ordered some wine and an appetizer (crab cake), which were fine. Here's where it goes bad.  Being a steakhouse, we ordered two dry-aged, bone-in ribeye steaks.  We both ordered medium-rare.  (Same cuts, same cook level).  My wife's steak comes out great.  Perhaps a little on the rare side, but who cares.  It's delicious.  My steak comes out different.  The inside of the steak is lightly pink and some of the thinner parts are not pink at all.  I would call it medium-well. Someone could argue that I don't know my steaks.  And, I'm not some great steak expert.  But, any person would be able to compare the two steaks and notice the significant difference in color and cook-level between my wife's steak and mine. We told the server the issue with my steak.  And, he took it back without issue.  Meanwhile, my wife and I ate her steak.  It was very good. A few minutes later, the server brought back a new rib-eye.  And, this baby was so rare that it may have even moo'd as it sat on the table.  When I cut into it, the fat marbeling was still defined (since it hadn't got warm enough to melt) and it was very, red. It was just seared on the outside.  I believe this is called ""blue rare."" So, the steak went back for a second time.  Meanwhile, my wife and I had finished her steak and most of our shared side.  And, I'm still waiting on getting my entree.  Not good. Finally, the server brings the steak back. As far as cook level, it's great.  Now, it's medium rare.  The flavor of it, however, has somehow suffered.  There is a slight hint of gas (fuel) that is now present in this meat.  I don't know how or why it would have gotten there.  I'll leave that to the steak experts to explain. This odd flavor aside, the steak is decent.  We finish up our steak, and the server brought over the dessert menu and offered us each a dessert, on-the-house.  It's a nice gesture considering the steak issues. However, we are short on time because we have to catch a train and are not able to accept the desserts. So, in short, I'm very disappointed with CFR.  While majority of the food was pretty good, and the service was good, it's a steakhouse.  And, the issues that I had with the steak made for a bad dining experience.  When you pay that kind of money and order something that should be in the restaurant's wheel-house, you expect it to be good.  And, it wasn't. Spent a few hundred dollars last night.  Not a good experience.  That's how you get one star.",0.989,0.809,0.125,0.066,0.4774025974025976

It's pricey but the service has been good, I like the patio and restaurant atmosphere, and I've been generally pleased with the food. Late last month I was on a cleanse that restricted meat and dairy. I was perusing South Loop menus to figure out a good place to meet a friend for a bite so that I could stick to the cleanse and she could eat meat, or whatever, to her heart's content. I was delighted and a bit surprised to notice the menu item below listed as one of their specialties and decided to keep it local and go here because of it: MISO MARINATED TOFU ""SCALLOPS"" quinoa ""fried rice"" style, brussel sprout salad $19 Big mistake.  I inquired about the brussel sprout salad before I ordered the entree to find out if there was any cheese in it. The waiter (who offered excellent service by the way) checked and I was told no, it was basically brussel sprouts. (okay, so why is it called a salad, I thought - but dismissed it because I actually love brussel sprouts!) My plate shows up and I am not kidding that what was on it was three, less than quarter sized tofu scallops, two tablespoons (if that much) of fried quinoa, sitting atop of smattering of miso. When I realized my brussel sprouts hadn't come out with the dish, I asked my waiter to check on them.  He came back and said the green ""dusting"" on the scallops was the brussel sprout salad! I burst out laughing and asked him, no really, where's my brussel sprouts, and he seriously replied that was it! I didn't want the evening to revolve around my displeasure - my friend ordered the french onion soup appetizer which is tried and true, only $8, and way more sustenance than my entree - we had much to catch up on, so I just let it go.  $19 isn't a whole lot of money, but for what was presented as a dinner entree, it was WAY over priced.  Especially when the menu offers many lesser priced appetizers and salads that have bigger portions than this entree offered.  As someone who prepares these ingredients frequently, there was at most, $3.00 worth of tofu, quinoa, miso on that plate (don't ask me to include the brussel sprouts!)  What was served was actually good, but it was seriously a minute big.  The dish was misrepresented (no brussel sprout salad) and was not an entree portion by far.  Had the portion been reasonable and representative, or had the dish been offered as an appetizer for $10, and the reference to brussel sprouts not been there, and if I hadn't had to get dinner after dinner because I was starving, I wouldn't be writing this review.",0.9913,0.842,0.113,0.045,0.46622807017543866

2013-06-01,3.0,"A decent restaurant that makes up in service what it lacks in food. Some food, at least. Housed in an old firehouse, Chicago Firehouse has a lot of dining space, outdoor seating too, a good sized bar, and a lower level for private parties. I would highly suggest making reservations; it's always crowded, unless you find place at the bar. It took approximately two hours from the time we were seated to the time we were served dessert. The good thing about it is that you don't realize the passing of time. We had the house salad, which was as delicious as it sounds (if you like goat cheese and pecans) to start of with. I ordered the pork chops, and my friend had the 16oz rib-eye medium well. A side of garlic whipped potatoes to go with these. The food arrived very well plated, with the meat sitting in a thick sauce. The pork chops were decent. The standout of the dish was the spicy tomato sauce on the chops. The meat itself... it's a large portion, but there was a lot of fat on it. The first few bites yielded only fat beneath a rather crispy/burnt crust. Peeling that off resulted in better meat. It was decent. The yams and slaw that come with it were ok. The barbecue sauce it's served in is slightly overwhelming. The rib-eye was well cooked, but also had that burnt/crispy crust which took away the focus from the meat. It was good though had nothing that really stood out. The garlic potatoes had a good flavor. For dessert we had the crème brûlée; it was at lower than room temperature and still good. Perfect for two people to share after a heavy-ish meal. The service is excellent, but do know that if you're a smaller party you might be overlooked once in a while for a larger party. But they will come back to you.

My family has gone many times  for all the holiday buffets offered and the occaisional light lunch.  We have always emensely enjoyed the cuisine, presentation, and service in the past but todays Mother's Day offering fell short of all expectations. It seems obvious that Mainstay Hospitality  has fallen victim to economic cutbacks. The entrees in the warming dishes were lack luster and overly seasoned, almost as though an attempt to disguise lesser quality meats. Seafood offerings present but only a fraction of what has been in attendance in the past. Most disappointing was the sweet table. Very little to choose from and absolutely tasteless. Petite red velvet cupcakes incredibly dry. I will note that the carving station selections of prime rib and off the bone ham were very good. However the employees assigned to this station should have been advised to eliminate the baseball cap from the traditional chef uniform. There were many servers standing about...literally. It was not easy to get a beverage refilled. Kitchen runners were not too concerned about replenishing stations. Because of this I feel the automatic addition of an 18% gratuity is a bit much. The server even requested that I add on additional! We were able to discuss concerns with the manager.  He assured us he would share our comments with his team. It was not worth $250.00. We've had a great run Firehouse...at least 5 years I would venture to say. But as they say all good things must end. Really a shame!",0.6981,0.792,0.112,0.096,0.48188172043010746

If you're a fan of oysters, you will not be disappointed since they regular ones and Oysters Rockefeller.  Their side dishes are incredible too, and highly recommend the macaroni and cheese and the spinach. Both are excellent additions to any entree. In addition, I strongly recommend trying their lobster tail at least once since it's terrific. For soup, their lobster bisque is terrific and the calamari is an excellent appetizer.

What we ate -Shrimp risotto- delicious, with a creamy truffle sauce. Very large portion for a starter -Crab cakes- bf said they were pretty good, but he went to school in Baltimore, so he's a bit of a crab cake snob.  -NY Strip- cooked to order- pretty damn good steak, cooked correctly and had lots of flavor -Pork chop- OMG yum. Huge. The thing had to be 16oz. Covered in a delicious bbq sauce and served with a little mound of cabbage and sweet potatoes. The bbq sauce was amazing and maybe what made the meal so delicious. -Seasonal veggies- very good had a smoky grilled flavor and was a large portion -Mushrooms side- also very good, your typical steakhouse mushrooms.

Our server was extremely attentive, allowed us plenty of time to peruse the wine and food menus, but never let it get too long to where we were wondering where he was. Water glasses were always full, and he often refilled the wine glasses as well (we ordered a bottle). He also quickly brought the check and took care of the bill when paid. Overall just the right amount of service for our dinner, extremely excellent waiter and wait staff. The food was just ok. My steak was the largest, and came out slightly underdone. The smallest steak at the table came out overcooked - so timing isn't a specialty of the kitchen. Similarly, the brussels sprouts were good, but slightly underdone, while the asparagus had just a little too much char on them. The food just seemed to be inconsistent.

We love going out to nice dinners and do not mind spending the money for the right meal! Not only is the meal itself important to us but so is the ambiance and service.  Before I elaborate on how our night played out, I will say I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO DISAPPOINTED/DISGUSTED/APPAULED THAN I WAS SATURDAY NIGHT.  I had made reservations via Open Table for 8 p.m.  We arrive promptly at 8 into a very nice lobby, was greeted nicely by the hostess stand next to the main dining area. This gave us our first and ONLY glimpse into where I would expect to sit for the $$$ we were about to spend. Only to be led up a flight of stairs to what we were later told was an ""overflow room"", covered in cheap carpet that reminded me of a reception room, makeshift tables with table cloths thrown over and reception room chairs.  We were seated in a booth for two right next to the kitchen door, even though plenty of 2 tops were open & weren't filled all night. My boyfriend then pointed out the live wires right above my head where a fixture had been removed and never replaced. So romantic.  We laugh the above off, order a nice bottle of red and an appetizer and have great conversation.  Our waiter than came back to place our order. Did not mention anything about the specialties or any items that they were out of. I do extensive research before making our dinner reservations, i.e. browse the menu, read yelp, reach out to friends etc...so I knew what I had my eye on. Of course the one item I wanted, Seafood Pasta, they were out of the Pasta. PASTA?! Umm ok! Go next door and get more! I was already disapppointed with where we were seated, the live wires at my head and the lack of communication that you'd get about specials at a ""nice steakhouse"" and then I find out the item I had been eyeing was not available began the spiral staircase of disappointment.  Once our appetizer came, I had found something else on the menu, Salmon, which is another favorite of mine so we were fine....UNTIL 1 HOUR 15 MINUTES PASSED and we still had not gotten our meal, nor heard from our waiter. At this point a table sat down next to us 30 minutes after we were seated, served and began eating. Our waiter noticed how annoyed we were getting and finally stopped by our table, apologized for the wait and says our meal will be right out. He checks on our meal and stops by our table again and says just a few more minutes. At that point we both decided this was unacceptable, we'd lost our appetite and were seriously contemplating if we were on Kitchen Nightmares and Gordon Ramsay himself was going to walk out.

Heather never informed us that the salmon was served a la carte, we had to call her over and ask then she ran down the list of sides.

2013-02-04,1.0,"Where should I begin: It's Restaurant Week in Chicago and we always choose at least two new places each year. We have always wanted to eat at The Chicago Firehouse and what a better time than RW. We decided to go for lunch and get the set RW lunch menu and we made reservation online via Open Table for 3 p.m. for Saturday, February 2. Upon entering I smelled something odd and kind of fishy and the scent did not go away and at that moment I decided I would not order any fish entree.  Once we are seated we told our server Noel, that we were there for RW and wanted the lunch special. It was at that point that he said that they are only serving from the dinner menu at this time. I thought that was strange since it was 3 p.m. and I was not interested in spending $33 or $44 per person for lunch when I knew I would eat dinner later. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. I was looking forward to trying their 8 oz rib eye.  So, I selected from the $33 dinner menu and ordered the wedged salad that was drenched in dressing, pot roast that was served a slight temperature above cold, with mash potatoes (the server said potatoes did not know there were going to be mashed and were only kept warm from the barely warm pot roast that was on top) and cold green beans. The plate was barely warm and how it should be when you are finishing your meal and not at beginning. So I am sure it must have been sitting for a while and I am thinking on purpose. I also had the chocolate mousse cake for dessert which was the best part of the whole experience.  Our server never came over to asked how about our meal experience and he walked by our table at least five times (yes, I counted) to check on the table next to ours and another next to that one. There was a long wait before we got our dessert and of course had to find him to get the bill so we could leave.  A couple came in after we did and also wanted to the lunch menu and was told the same thing about only serving dinner. I asked another patron about their experience (just wanted to see if maybe it was me having an horrible experience) and she also thought she was ordering from the lunch menu for RW and was not told, until after her dinner RW 12 oz steak was brought out to her. So ladies and gentlemen it was not just our table.  I know restaurants do open for dinner and usually it's about 4 or 5 p.m., but never for 3 p.m. and if that is their policy it should be clearly stated on the RW and Open Table website when making reservations. When it was almost 5 p.m. the lights dimmed for the dinner setting and that is when they should have served from the dinner menu and not at 3 p.m. This was very misleading to new patrons and only if you are a regular would you know that they do not serve lunch on Saturday. This experience leads me to ask was this revenue generating ploy or honest mistake?  I would have talked to the manager, but I saw him a couple of times standing near the bar scratching his chest. Which for me was not a good sign and only God knows what that was about.

Our party started with the lobster bisque, which is topped with a puff pastry and was delicious (but somewhat hard to eat in a tidy fashion), and salads.  For the main course, my table enjoyed the filet (MR), the trio of filets with bleu cheese (MR), rack of lamb (MR), and the pork chop.  We also had sides of the potato au gratin and french fries.  Serving sizes were very generous - each side dish was enough for all four people.  The steaks were cooked to perfection, but the bleu cheese on top of mine was still cold.  I wish they'd warmed it prior to allowing it to melt on top of the steak, because it was a tad too chilly.  Everything was tender and wonderful though and I would definitely return.  For dessert, we all split a brownie sundae, since we were stuffed.  It was absolutely wonderful, but I think we probably could have done without.   I would definitely go back.",0.994,0.786,0.211,0.004,0.5953703703703704
2013-01-16,3.0,"I'm going to live yelp this, for your reading pleasure. FYI, 29 y/o married steak lover from Texas coming with a party of 6.  7:00 -- We made reservations earlier today and arrived on time. Table was ready. Plastic/metal fold-out party table with a tablecloth thrown over it. Kinda tacky. We're right by the front of the bar, where there's a door. Cold air seeping through. I'm from Houston, I'm pretty cold. Decor is swanky, though. Fair noise level, but I can hear everyone at the table. 7:06 -- They brought out the rolls. Decent.  7:20 -- We are choosing wines. Stag's Leap Artemis or Justin Isosceles. Waiter is very knowledgable and helpful.  7:28 -- We chose the Justin, but they brought out the wrong year (2009 instead of 2008). They do not have the right year. We're asking for the manager. If we're paying $130+ for wine, we want the right stuff.  7:31 -- Manager is non-apologetic for the incorrect listing. He's brusque and impatient. We're going with the Stag's Leap instead. 7:34 -- They're decanting the wine. I asked if they do refills on coke, and the waiter said ""no, but I'll do it for you."" That's nice.  7:48 -- They've come to take our order. I'm choosing the Filet Oscar medium rare+. We're getting potatoes au gratin, asparagus, creamed spinach, and loaded twice baked potatoes.  7:54 -- Coke is flat, leg is freezing.  8:01 -- They brought out more rolls. Those who ordered salads have received them. 8:22 -- The food has arrived. Steak looks smaller than I expected.  8:51 -- Now for the main review: the steak was rather good, though not quite worth the money. Not spiced too much, good flavor, good texture. A solid steak, but not like Ruth's Chris or Morton's by any means. Came out colder than one would want. The crab topping was rather good, relatively small chunks and evenly spread. The steak came on top of cooked asparagus, which was crisp and flavorful. Sauce was good. I'd say I was expecting the steak to be an 8 or 9 out of 10, and this was a 7. The sides: asparagus was crisp and flavorful, good choice. The potatoes au gratin were lasagna style, very flavorful and very good. I'd recommend it without reservation. The twice baked potatoes were unremarkable, though not bad. The creamed spinach was tasty, admittedly not something I regularly get so I can't comment with insight. Much better than I thought it would be, to be fair.  Final assessment: a little over-priced and very short of the Southern hospitality I've come to expect from fine establishments, but not too bad.",0.996,0.807,0.166,0.028,0.5564289695811437

We sat out back in the beer garden as it was a nice summer morning.  I ordered the eggs Benedict and loved it. I did not hear one single person complain about there food, everyone loved it and I was with about 9 or 10 people. Here is where they stole my heart. The Bloodies and that is all I need to say. Def one of the best that I have had in the city of Chicago. They were strong, spicy, tasty, had huge chunks of shrimp and steak in them and were just delish.  I would def reccomend the food, and the bloodies. Our waiter was a pretty cool guy as well. Props my friend.  Only downfall Bloodies were 12 bucks a pop (but you cant complain about quality). All in all I think my bill was about 50 bucks just for me just for brunch so it is on the expensive side but tot worth it to check it out and frequent maybe once a month or so.

I ended up having one and my wife had a Hendrix martini shaken with cucumber and a hint of vermouth, outstanding.  We ordered two appetizers that were absolutely delicious.

An attorney who I work with picked The Chicago Firehouse. I had never dined there, but I GUARANTEE you I will return. Another critic accurately stated: ""This restaurant has character and atmosphere to spare!"" This is an old style Chicago restaurant located in a converted fire hall in the new swank South Loop district on the southeast corner of 14th & Michigan--a less than pleasant area just a few years ago! The food and service were amazing! The Lobster Bisque was served in a puffed flaky pastry and the portion unusually generous. The Shrimp Risotto was also delectable. The crab cake was a bit of a disappointment to me; it was not at all seared and therefore lacked texture. The waiter did not seem to understand the year of a vintage is important--he substituted a 2008 Silver Oak Alexander Valley Cab for a 2007 without mentioning it to me. When I pointed out the difference he did not adjust the $150 price tag! 2007 worth it, but 2008 not so much. None of that dissuades me from concluding that this place is an outstanding restaurant!

Service - Great bussers and water guys.  Not so good servers.  Bad management. Our story: We arrived for our 7:30 reservation only to be seated at 7:56 (who was keeping track of time...?)  We were immediately delivered a steaming plate of bread rolls -- I devoured most of them while my boyfriend's jaw hung open.  It took nearly 15 minutes for our waitress to take our drink orders.  We ordered a bottle of wine. What we ordered: Appetizers: crab cakes & caeser salad Dinner: New York Strip & Filet with sides of garlic mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese Dessert: after the first two courses, we wanted nothing to do with dessert. My boyfriend's favorite part of the entire meal was the caeser salad.  My crab cakes were warm on the outside and cold in the center.  Our steaks were both ordered to medium, but arrived completely charred on the outside.  My boyfriend said his steak tasted like an overseasoned woodchip.  Mine was underseasoned and overcooked. The macaroni and cheese tasted frozen.  It was gritty and grainy.  The garlic mashed potatoes were okay at first bite, but the flavors of the garlic became too strong to continue eating.   All of these details were overlooked because we were dining on the dime of my boyfriend's company.  He won two giftcards to the Mainstay Hopsitality group which services three different restaurants, including The Chicago Firehouse according to their website. Prior to our visit tonight, I called the number listed on the gift cards to ensure that each card had a balance of what we were told.  Each gift card contained the correct amount earlier this afternoon. When we got the check, our waitress was unsure about our gift cards because they were listed for a different restaurant. We showed her the back of the card that wrote ""This card may be used at The Chicago Firehouse Restaurant, Grace O'Malley's Restaurant-Pub, and all other participating...."" The manager informed us they no longer are affiliated with Mainstay Hospitality.  He also said he called the other restaurant to verify the balances on the cards -- only one card contained money, the other was empty. So we were charged for a sub-par meal on what should have been a free dinner.  I called back the number I called earlier to inquire about the ""empty"" gift card the manager handed to us -- it still contained the initial amount of money I was told the earlier afternoon. We won't be eating here again.  I wouldn't recommend it, unless you are wanting a pretty space to look at while you eat less-than-average food at fine dining prices.",0.995,0.808,0.147,0.045,0.5363306982872202

The waiter suggested the special only because it would be in season for a short time and I could always come back for the Trout ---- can I just say I love the waiter! The spanish fish (sorry cannot remember the name) special was truly a delightful surprise!!! It was warm and buttery and just melted in my mouth. The capers were a perfect touch and I refused to share my meal with anyone just so I could savor each bite!    CFH Filet Flight -- if you are indecisive and into meat - this is a great dish. I may have not shared with anyone but I forced each person to give me a bit of their dish. (hehe)  This was fantastic. Very well done, cooked to order. It was great because if you wanted each filet cooked differently they had no issue obliging.     Surf & Turf was a very big portion and after all of the above appetizers [half] was taken home.

We made a reservation 2 weeks in advance, and were stuck in the middle of the bar area. Neither of us are the type to make a fuss and figured it was not a big deal. But then our service was horrible- we both were only asked if we wanted another drink once during the entire meal. We were ignored in a loud, rowdy bar whilst eating a $150 meal for 2. We would have spent a lot more, but we just wanted to leave by the end and hadn't been able to order the bottle of wine we desired. We are 24 years old, so I guess they assumed we did not have the money to spend.

Also ordered the 16 oz. ribeye and 16 oz. NY strip. Both were cooked to the correct temperature. I wish I'd gone for the ribeye or at least ordered the strip medium rare, but that was my fault.

Whatever topping you choose--from crusted bleu cheese to caramelized onions--it's always a good choice. Their sides are equally yummy--the garlic whipped potatoes are a MUST as are the brussels sprouts with bacon & dates. Their seafood is always fresh & their portions quite generous--I recommend the Oysters Rockefeller and Scallops! If you don't mind too much meat, start with the Steak Tartare is always perfectly prepared: topped with a creamy egg yolk and sides of capers, shallots and a sharp, tasty Dijon mustard.  As for brunch, I highly recommend trying their Easter or Mother's Day brunch! It's a decadent & delicious array of foods from jumbo shrimp to cold cuts to an omelet station to a carving station. The staff is constantly replenishing everything & making sure nothing goes bad. This means your Eggs Benedict or Sardou are never runny, your bacon is never overdone & your shrimp & oysters never go warm.

My brother-in-law felt like he was sitting at the kiddie table. Service was really poor. About 10 minutes after placing our dinner order the waiter came back to verify two orders because he said he couldn't read his own handwriting. Drinks orders took a long time. The sides came out significantly later than the entrees. Also, I brought a cake with speciality candles that they threw away after taking it back for cutting. I spoke with one of the managers about all of my frustrations. She apologized and offered some champagne or sweet wine, which we didn't want. They took off some charges for the sides. Then the waiter had the audacity to tell me that they waived the cake cutting fee. Give me a break. So disappointing.

I like that they are unintrusive but a little more passion about the food and service would go a long way, and help justify the price a bit.

This place looks absolutely lovely!  Upon walking through the door you're greeted by a fireplace, walls made from those white, enamel bricks that cover fire stations, and lots of hard wood.  You're also greeted by a waiter, who is unfailingly polite if businesslike, and is probably dressed better than you are. We needed to wait for a couple of members of our group to show up so sat at the bar for ten minutes or so.  Pleasant enough, the bartender was friendly, and it was a nice place to sit for 20 minutes and when we were ready to move, a disturbingly well dressed waiter showed us straight to our table. Upon taking our table and looking at the menu for a while, our waitress came over and did a speech that was longer than the typical epic poem:  Which appetizers we may prefer, her recommendations for entrees (for meat eaters, then fish eaters, then vegetarians), her description of how the French onion soup contained red wine so was sweeter than most typical French onion soups.  It was all good stuff to know, it was just... more comprehensive than I expected. The food was really nice.  I got the salmon, which was nicely cooked.  Those who ordered steaks got big lumps of meat that they really enjoyed.  The portions weren't large.  Maybe it's just part of this place marketing itself as 'high end', but it was one of the first restaurants I've been to in the US where I would have also liked to eat an appetizer, just because I wasn't yet full when I'd finished my entree. I found everything 'nice' and 'satisfying', but there was nothing that really stood out so I'm not sure how many stars to give it.  The whole numbers are  3 (""A OK"") or 4 (""I'm a fan"").

By far the best service we've had there and could be used as an example on how to make each table feel special. When we were debating between 2 wines w/dinner, he brought each to the table and did a tasting w/some info on each winery. Never obtrusive, but extremely attentive...the perfect balance in a server.

2011-12-19,3.0,"I came here on a weeknight for a work-related dinner (aka not on my dime, which was nice because this place is expensive!).  Our group split the seafood platter appetizer (yum!) which came in the most giant dish I have ever seen and included lobster tails, crab legs, shrimp, lump crab meat and raw oysters. Pricey but delish. For starters, I had the lobster bisque, which was good but a bit too lobstery/fishy tasting. They do give a very generous portion (could probably split a bowl), and it comes with a puffed pastry shell on top, which was very tasty when dipped into the soup. Not being a huge red meat eater, I opted to order the scallops with pasta, brussel sprouts, squash and cheese. The scallops were delicious and cooked to perfection. I do wish (for the price!) that they included more squash and brussel sprouts. I did not care for how the pasta was cooked; it was chewy and some of the pieces stuck together. The sauce was also a bit thick, but it was good.  We had to run so we didn't have time for dessert, which made me immensely sad. I didn't even get to SEE the menu and they don't have it online, and I'm so curious, I might just go back one day for dessert. Because I'm obsessed with dessert like that. The ambiance is really neat. Its an old converted firehouse (hence the name) and they retained a lot of the original features when remodeling the building. If you have to wait for your table, they have a photo album in the lobby which contains historical-type pics.

2011-12-01,4.0,"On my second visit to the Chicago Firehouse the other night, I've been made a believer. After my first unsatisfactory visit I wanted to give it a second try. My friend and I were celebrating the end of midterms, we wanted to dine at a nice restaurant for the occasion and we were craving steak! The restaurant was pretty fantastic; food was okay; service impeccable. The restaurant is gorgeous - our server told us it was built in 1905, and was an operating firehouse until the 1980's. The booth we sat in was big and really comfortable, making us feel as if we were alone in our own dining room.  After a (long) 15 minute wait, we were sat down and promptly greeted by the waiter - a cute white guy, I think he said his name is Rich.  Which is funny, the first time I went I was on a date, and our server's name was Rich, too, maybe latino? Anywho, he was awful; very awkward, weird, and overbearing.  He seemed like he didn't really know what he was doing, we waited forever for our drinks and then even longer for our food. After we flagged him down to ask where our food was, he wouldn't leave us alone.  He might as well sat down with us at the table.  You go out to dine with your friend, not your server. Particularly not a weird, socially awkward server who can't even take orders let alone provide fine dining service. He was just...weird.  THIS TIME around our server was perfect: attentive but not overbearing, knowledgeable, and seemed to know what we needed before we even did. We started out with the wine.  Neither of us really know much about wine. He asked us some questions about what we liked and recommended a couple different bottles. His suggestion was perfect - pricey but perfect. He let us settle in with the wine then briefly went over the menu. We started with the pork cheeks, another suggestion from our waiter. They are literally the cheeks of a pig - but amaaazing.  Very tender meat, braised in ale with polenta. Our salads were okay, a bit too much dressing and left us wanting something more. They were...underwhelming, far from original/innovative. Then for dinner we shared a dry-aged steak.  The server explained the dry-aging process and that a dry-aged steak would be a much more 'succulent' cut of meat (I don't remember how) but it sure was FANTASTIC. We got the brussel sprouts which were good, the mashed potatoes were something you'd expect from a diner. I got the key lime pie which was okay and my friend got the cheesecake which was not very good. All in all, the menu was kind of underwhelming. I looked on the website and they are supposed to have a James Beard nominated chef, but by looking at the menu you sure wouldn't think so.  And the desserts? Not so hot. I don't know if they have a pastry chef but could do better buying desserts from Jewel. That's not to say the food wasn't good, it was great! You would just think with a 'chef' the menu would be more innovative.  In sum, service: inconsistent but this time great, food: good, ambiance: great, Final tally for stars: 4",0.9985,0.781,0.193,0.026,0.639546607905983

The setting is intimate enough to be special but also classy enough to be a setting to celebrate in. We were seated ahead of our reservation time on a Friday night and were very pleased with the ambience. We had the Oysters Rockefeller for appetizer which were very tasty. Their version has little to no cheese, but the spinach and breadcrumbs are so tasty that you don't miss it. Their bread was warm and there was plenty of it brought to the table, but I've had much tastier bread at other restaurants. For entrees, my sister had the sea scallops.

I had the Filet Oscar which was very tasty; my husband had a 12 ounce filet mignon and we split mashed potatoes. My steak was very flavorful, although it was slightly undercooked (I asked for medium and got more of a medium rare). My husband's medium steak was spot-on.

Ambiance is always nice.  They did an excellent job in decour.  It oozes class so at least drop by for one of their expensive cocktails...maybe the crabcake appitizer? The quality of meat is good and I use good because the frequency of getting a blah cut is more frequent so always order more under cooked than you would normally do.  You can always have the kitchen give it more fire but not vice verse.

The crab cake was goooood stuff.  Excuse my non-fanciness, I don't do this stuff often, and this is going to be a recurring theme throughout this review.  I've never had a real crab cake before.  I've had the fake ones or what other people have told me are nothing to be proud of.  So based on that, this was the best crab cake of my life.  At the time, I felt it was a bit dry and a bit lacking on the flavor.  But!  The celery root remoulade and watercress made up for it.  It was pretty darn tart and was having trouble balancing the crab cake.  After some trial and error I found the right fork full of crab cake and condiment.  I'd say this appetizer was a 3 star course.  The filet was awesome.  I didn't realize 8 ounces was so much, because it was a big 'ol thick chunk of meat.  They *may* have been generous with their portion, which I am not complaining about!  The filet was cooked perfectly with a nice pink center and it was soooo tender.  It was served with some asparagus, which were very asparagussy, a veal demi sauce which was tasty, and au gratin potatoes.  I like all forms of potato, but these were definitely better than most.  They had a nice bit of crispy, melted cheese on top that made them even more awesome.  Definitely a 5 star entree.  The banana pudding was really good as well.  It had lots of banana flavor and chunks of banana and the bread alternated between toasted and crispy on top and soaked in pudding goodness at the bottom.  It was a hefty portion and a dense dessert, I probably could have killed someone with it if I wanted.  Good, solid 4 star dessert.   The service was great, and although that was expected for a private dining menu, it's still nice to know they put effort into making sure the service was kept up.  If it impacted anyone downstairs....sorry we took your waiters.  Sort of.  The ambiance was nice, although a lot of the place is starting to be frayed around the edges.  An example is doors between dining rooms not on their hinges quite right.  Maybe a drunken stumble knocked them off kilter, but they were definitely a bit crooked.  The original/historic (I'm assuming) sinks in the bathroom were pretty cool, and rusty.",0.9971,0.783,0.188,0.029,0.514581222559946

2011-06-06,1.0,"UGH. i have a list of restaurants i want to tackle. obviously living in chicago, steakhouses are on the top of the list. chicago firehouse has always gotten mixed verbal reviews, but when restaurant week rolled around, a group of friends figured, why not? i'll tell you why not...SO BAD. let's start with apps. i had their firecracker shrimp. while the size of the shrimp was impressive, it's fried shrimp on a bed of cabbage and tobasco. so sub-par! my friend ordered the 'braised' octopus - which was charred beyond eating. the two who ordered lobster bisque finished with no complaints (or compliments)  the steak was unmemorable. my sister had to send hers back because it was way overcooked. overall the rib eye was flavorless - which is hard to do consider there is so much natural flavor!  dessert was a DISASTER. we all ordered diff things and no one was impressed. the key lime pie was inedible. my friend sent it back, stating as such. the waitress apologized and replaced it with an over-spice pumpkin pie and comp'd her drink. but it was like no key lime pie we've ever had. it was gelatinous and hard, the brownie was overcooked, and the cheesecake tasted like cream cheese. i was very tempted to go back the next day with each dessert made in my house and have the manager and pastry chef taste test. i thought that may seem crazy, but literally if someone from CFR needs that - i'm up for it!  i won't be going back. nor recommend it.",0.5999,0.752,0.129,0.119,0.45499999999999996

We were seriously stunned at the room they sat us in. First of all it was EMPTY with only one couple seated. Secondly the decor and atmosphere was horrible. It seriously looked like an old banquet hall. It had old red picnic chairs and a wooden wall divider separating the rooms. A couple of questions came to mind from my husband and I. If they had this empty room why did we have to wait 45 minutes when we had a reservation? Most importantly why were we treated like second class citizens and segregated from the actual restaurant?  We witnessed the one other couple in our seating area upstairs request to speak to the manager to ask the same questions.  They were greeted by a manager who said he would place them in a booth downstairs (in the pleasant atmosphere) and he also looked at us and told us he would look into the matter.  He never returned.      We were able to get the attention of the hostess who seated us and asked if we could be seated downstairs.  She told us that would be another 90 minute wait.  The downstairs wasn't even full and there wasn't a line, not to mention we had a reservation. At that point we decided to leave.        This restaurant is a bit pretentious as to who will be seated where.  There was this old skinny creepy guy walking back and forth in the hallway and he probably looked at us 8 different times as if he were judging us. At one point we caught him looking at us from behind a divider. It was our overall impression that we weren't good enough to be seated in the main area and were sent out of the way into a room that resembled a cheap diner from the 50's. The experience made us feel like we weren't good enough to be there, not sure what we did or if we were suppose to ""look"" a certain way, but we definitely won't be back to this restaurant.",0.9028,0.894,0.068,0.038,0.4961415062478893

Upon entering, you can hear the big band swing music being piped in and I thought it just seemed perfect for the setting. You can see remnants of the firehouse inside--sliding pole, old tile on the walls--it was charming, mixed in with the sleeker furniture. Even though we had reservations, there was about a 20 minute wait, which wasn't so bad considering it was Friday night and restaurant week. The friendly bartender took good care of us even though he was hopping busy back there.  Once we were seated in our cozy burgundy leather corner booth, water glasses were filled and warm sourdough bread and whipped butter was brought to the table. (and kudos for whipped butter! I just hate it when you get ice cold butter with your bread) Our friendly waiter was very busy but still took time to check on us once in a while.  It took a while to get our check at the end of the evening, but then again, it was Friday and it was RW.  We stuck to the restaurant week menu but did add creamed spinach a la carte as a side. Our meal:  Lobster Bisque--creamy soup, small chunks of lobster,a little too bitter for me but the hubs loved it.  Grilled baby Octopus--absolutely delicious! I loved the little bit of lemon splash and the tomato sauce was perfect. I thought the octopus would be rubbery, but found it quite delicate and tender.  Roasted Amish Chicken, Roasted squash, mushrooms and garlic sauce--very tender and juicy chicken. The veggies were very fresh and well prepared.  12 oz Rib Eye, Blue Cheese Crusted, Garlic Mashed Potatoes. Very tender--you could tell just by the first cut of your knife, that this is very good quality steak. Cooked perfectly to medium. I don't know how many times I can say delicious--but it truly was delicious!  Callebaut Chocolate Brownie served with Vanilla ice cream--very rich chocolate flavor, dense brownie. The ice cream was definitely needed to add some softness to it.  Key Lime Pie--nice tartness. Very smooth, had a bit of a milky taste to it. Nice fresh pop to end the dinner.

I love the bar at this place, It's where you can see the interior of the original refurbished firehouse building (the dining room has been redone). The bar tender was really cool to talk to . It wasn't busy in there so that might have had something to do with that. He also gave us a salad to try because it was new to the menu. They wanted our opinion of it. I enjoyed this a lot, it made me feel very welcome in their restaurant.  Dinner: I had the Steak Tar Tar as a meal along with the Lobster bisque. The lobster bisque is out of this world good. It's not to thick but it has lots of lobster in it. It also comes with a baked crust on the top that is very light and flaky. They have this dish down to the t. The Steak tar tar was really fresh and came with a nice green salsa/sauce drizzled on the crackers. It was a nice touch. My co-workers all had steaks and they loved em and were all cooked to their liking. The sides were OK. I was super excited for the mac and cheese and it was OK. It was really really creamy. I like my mac and cheese with a little bit of bread crumbs or something on the top to give It the baked taste and this was missing that element. It was just OK. I also sampled the mushrooms, potatoes Au gratin and the seasonal squash. All of em were OK. The sides were the only disappointment though, everything else was out of this world.  Service: Our waitress was really really great. We were a rowdy crew. She played right along, even picking up on some of the nick names we had given to people throughout the evening. She had great suggestions, was always on top of it. I think the thing that really showed how good she is was when we ordered a drink called the Root beer float. It's an adult version of the root beer float. She told us that she didn't recommend it because she had another customer return it because it wasn't good. We told her we really wanted to try it, then she said that if we didn't like it she would take it back and take it off the bill. This is after we had decided to go against her advice. I never expected her to show that type of service. Well, low and behold, we got it and couldn't stand it. She took it back right away and even joked with us a little about the whole affair.

When asked to be moved, the hostess surveyed the area (i.e. dozen empty booths) and informed us that it wasn't possible. I figured it wouldn't be that big of a deal, give me some good food and I'd be happy enough to ignore everything else.

The ""flaky"" pastry crust was undercooked (read: partially raw) dough covering the bowl, the broth itself was...well I was going to say flavorless, but that would be putting a positive spin on things, it honestly tastes like they used dish water as a base ingredient.  For entrees, we split the double pork chop and tilapia. I have to commend the server for being honest with her opinion and not simply talking us into the most expensive menus on the item. She actually talked me out of the more expensive salmon for the tilapia. The pork chop was huge and looked great. Unfortunately it tasted like a glazed piece of cardboard, pretty dry and chewy. Granted its probably pretty hard to cook a pork chop that is literally 5 inches thick. The tilapia was overcooked, dry and not the freshest piece of fish that I've ever had. The vegetable medley under the fish included both under and overcooked vegetables which unfortunately did not provide a great contrast in textures...  I really wanted to like this place, but I won't be giving it another chance. It was not a pleasant experience. Although the bill was not bad ($80 for 2 with drinks), I would gladly pay more for a more consistent dining experience.",0.9939,0.722,0.188,0.091,0.6291987424340366
2010-08-01,5.0,"Went to this fine establishment with my wife, last night. I've been wanting to go here since I moved to Chicago, but it is a little bit off the beaten path on South Michigan so it is never top of mind. But since we were in the neighborhood for other reasons, we tried it. They accommodated us by seating us on the beautiful patio on a great evening. That was perfect. We had a great table and a great, very attentive wait staff. We could have stayed at our table all night - great ambiance. We ordered shrimp cocktail and french onion soup to start - The shrimp were a nice size but the presentation could have been a little better, kind of boring. The cocktail sauce was okay, not great. The onion soup was outstanding. Great balance of cheese and onion with perfect balance of saltiness. I ordered the Steak medallions that each had a different fire char, one with horseradish, one with peppercorn and one with bleu cheese. Each at 3oz. Wow, that was great. Perfectly cooked and just the right amount of taste. My wife had the halibut. It was a huge piece and very buttery. We had a few drinks in the bar beforehand, that experience is a bit cramped and not much room to move if you don't get a good spot. The bartenders were great, awesome sense of humor and very personable. All in all it was a 5-star experience and I/we will definitely be back.

We went for dinner.  Ordered the Oysters Rockefeller for a great looking start - six huge shells brimming with spinach, some breadcrumbs, plump oysters and my own little bottle of Tabasco - although I couldn't find the apple wood smoked bacon or taste the Pernod.  It was ALL downhill from there.   Wifey offered the theory that the chef had quit and the parking attendants were filling in.   I added that the chef must have left with the spice rack. The lobster bisque was tasteless.  Tasteless.  Tasteless, except for the handful of corn ""niblets"" floating around in it.  The only other bits that possibly could have been ""lobster meat"" like the menu says, were microscopic.   There were no chives.  There was no sherry in this bisque.  The pastry shell which looked like a nice touch was undercooked.  This had to be the Three Stooges lobster bisque recipe - soak the lobster shell in cream, boil, remove shell for next customer, add corn.   Food took forever to come out and our server - though very nice when he was present - disappeared in the interim.   My prime rib was just ok, but the ""twice baked"" potato was missing everything.  What sense does it make to take the time to scrape all the potato out of its shell and then put it back EXACTLY the way it was without adding butter, sour cream, seasoning, cheese, chives, ANYTHING - I mean God already had it set up this way!     Of course, after they repacked it, they put it under the broiler to brown the top.  It was so dry; after I chipped off the crispy top, I excavated the repacked potato meat and used the butter that came with the Wonder bread on the table and added salt and pepper to dress it up.  I would have used the au jus from the prime rib as well, but there wasn't any.   I have had better twice baked potatoes from the frozen food case at Jewel.     Wifey's three filet sampler had one cooked properly, the other two were overcooked and the toppings were cremated.   Asparagus served with her entrée had no seasoning at all - no complaints if you wanted the true asparagus taste, but a little creativity like a dressing or special house seasoning as a complement would have been nice. For this I paid $150 - including one wine and one Firehouse Ale?   Not good - Too many other, better choices to consider coming back here.   If they would have let me slide down the pole, I would have added a star.",0.9951,0.816,0.144,0.041,0.5444589624467674

2010-02-26,4.0,"True story about my dinner at Chicago Firehouse Restaurant last night:  I walked in the door about 10 minutes early for my reservation and the handsome guy behind the front desk starts giving me the whole, ""Welcome to Chicago Firehouse this evening.  We have a complimentary coat check.  May I have the name of your reservation?""  Very nice and respectable.  I'm looking at this guy and realize we went to college together, so I blurt out very uncouthly, ""Oh my God!  You went to Bradley!  I know you!  You're friends with so-and-so...""  Clearly this guy had no idea who I was (I guess I'm not that memorable after all), but he played it off pretty well and told me to tell a mutual friend of ours, who happens to be one of my best friends, that he says ""hi"" and all that good stuff.  It was kind of awkward and I felt like a total asshole, but the handsome man behind the front desk, who is actually one of the restaurant mangers, didn't make me feel like a buffoon. That's how classy a joint Chicago Firehouse Restaurant is; they don't make you feel like a moron when you're actin' a fool. Strange introduction completed, I headed to the bar area to wait for my dining partner.  I slipped into the only open seat and promptly ordered the pomegranate martini.  Booooooozy.  Taaaaaasty.  Well shaken.  Delicious.  And there are complimentary mixed nuts on the bar for your pre-dinner convenience. Once my friend arrived, we were seated promptly.  The dining room of Chicago Firehouse is very grown up.  So grown up that I'm fairly certain my friend and I were the youngest people dining there by about 20 years, but I digress.  I'm talking white table cloths, wine and water goblets, multiple sets of silverware... what you'd expect from an upscale dining experience.  Our server was quick to approach our table and provide us with the Restaurant Week menu along with a full wine list and regular menu in case we wanted to sample any of the goods not offered on the pre-fixe. I decided to go with the much touted lobster bisque to start.  I can confirm that everything you've heard about the bisque is true: It's 100% amazing.  Velvety smooth, lots of rich lobster taste and just delicious.  CFR is not shy with the onion, so if you can't hang with that flavor profile, you might want to try something else. My main course was the pan seared tilapia served with artichoke hearts, baby carrots, organic baby spinach and a balsamic butter sauce.  Actually, the balsamic butter sauce is a bit misleading.  There is a small amount of butter sauce on the plate and the tilapia is finished with a drizzle of balsamic vineager.  Either way, it's great.  The fish was so tender and flaky that it fell apart without the aid of a knife.  What kept the dish from being amazing is that while it was well prepared, it lacked something.  Punch?  Excitement?  Something unexpected?   Never one to shy away from garlic, I also ordered the garlic baby spinach side off the main menu.  Just a word of advice: If you're on a hot date, you may want to steer clear of this dish.  If you aren't on a hot date (or you just don't care what your date thinks of your breath at the end of the night), go for it!  Chock-full of delicious garlic, it's not to be missed.  The dish is light and tangy and thoroughly satisfying. Dessert was good, not amazing or particularly memorable.  We ordered both RW dessert options, which are triple layer chocolate cake and key lime pie.  I enjoyed both... they're clearly well done, but again, nothing that made me jump out of my seat. So in the end, CFR is offering up old-school service, lovely seafood and steaks and delicious martinis.  Will it be my home away from home?  Probably not.  Will I look back on it with affection?  You betcha.  It was a great pick for Restaurant Week!",0.9995,0.728,0.238,0.034,0.6181130144365439

The sauce really turns up the heat and the dish.  It just has this great balance that increases the flavor of the pork.   Last night, we lucked out and got the wine cellar for a group dinner which I definitely recommend if you have a large party.  We had 18 people and the wait staff was on top everything.  I also what everyone else ordered and everything looked amazing.  I was disappointing I did not get the Lobster Bisque after seeing the person next to me with it.  I will not make this mistake again.  It appeared absolutely filled with Lobster meat. I was to full for desert but the two they brought out looked great.  This is just a really cool restaurant and the prices aren't absurd for a steakhouse in Chicago.

Been coming to the Firehouse for special occasions for many years and decided to go with some coworkers for the restaurant week lunch today and it blew us all away.  Only bad part was that the lunch took 2 hours (not ideal given we had to go back to work), but all in all, it was great. We split up the caesar salad, firecracker shrimp, and tenderloin beef tips and all three were great.  Plus they were all big portions and we were approaching full after that course.  For the meal, two of us went with the CFH steak and one with the chicken and the blue cheese crust on the steak really packed a lot of flavor.  We fought through the apple/ice cream dessert and left feeling very satisfied. I've never had a bad meal here and that continues to be the case.   I will be back soon for dinner I'm sure where I will not stray from the lobster bisque and CFH pork chop.

I happen to be slightly obesessed with Wedge Salads and this one was a typial Wedge, nothing extra special about it. My boyfriend had the Lobster Bisque and it was excellent.  For my main course I had the Pan Seared Tilapia, which was excellent! It was in a balsamic butter sauce and it was done to perfection! Im not a big fan of a lot of butter, and this was done just right. My bofriend had the Filet with a parmesan peppercorn crust and that was absolutely delish! The only kind of red meat I typically eat is a filet, and this was just excellent. We ordered a couple of sides and the sauteed spinach I tried was overly garlicy!  The dessert was OK, nothing to obsess over! I had the choclate cake and he had the key lime pie. All and all, it was a pretty good meal!

2010-02-21,3.0,"""Meh"" is all I can say.  The wife and I went here for our first date post-baby.  We went Friday night, the kickoff to restaurant week.  Even with an early reservation at 6, the joint was jumping.  Lots of big parties taking advantage of the Prix Fixe menu.  We arrive about 5 minutes late, no worries getting seated as I had called ahead to warn we'd be a few minutes behind schedule.   When you enter the restaurant, you realize that it is indeed, inside an old Chicago firehouse.  The lobby is reminiscent of such, as is the bar.  So I was somewhat disappointed that the dinning room resembled any other dinning room in any other fine restaurant in the city.  I don't get it.  Everything that's cool and unique about the restaurant is gone once you're seated.   So we're seated promptly in a full dinning room. They're quick to the table with water and bread.  Our waiter is quick to the table to take our drink order.  The wine is quick to arrive.  We peruse the menu.  The wife decides on the chicken from the prix fixe menu.  I opt for the venison special I had heard about from the table next to us.  10-15 minutes pass, then one of the managers comes over.  He explains that our waiter is busy taking the order from a large table so he offers to take our order.  My wife order the lobster bisque, chicken, and chocolate cake from the prix fixe.  I order, from the regular menu, steak tartar, a baby green and Maytag blue cheese salad, and the aforementioned venison.  In an acceptable amount of time, my wife's soup arrives.  I asked for the tartar and salad to arrive at the same time.  A few minutes later they do.  The steak tartar is excellent.  The salad...is wrong, they bring me a wedge salad.  The server has dropped it and disappeared before I can protest.  He didn't speak English well, so the argument about getting the Maytag blue cheese salad and a wedge salad is pointless because he cannot decipher the difference, which I totally understand.  I decide to square this with my waiter.  So I wait, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, no waiter.  So I stow my complaint and dig into the wedge, which was also quite good, though I would have like to receive what I ordered.  So an acceptable amount of time elapses and the entrees arrive.  My wife's chicken was good, but a touch on the dry side.  My venison was absolutely the best!.  Being from Michigan, I haven't had it better unless it was locally provided, i.e. from a relatives hunting trip.  I would definitely order it again.   So finally our waiter rematerialized for desert.  He proclaims that he's bringing my wife's chocolate cake post haste and drops the dessert menu off for me to peruse.  So the servers bring out the chocolate cake for my wife.  5 minutes pass, 10 minutes pass, some more time passes.  Our waiter is attending to the large table he's working on.  My wife's cake is getting dusty.  Finally he arrives to take my order.  I get the apple brown Betty.  It comes out, it's pretty good, not great.  The waiter arrives.  We complement the meal, don't offer him any critique as I saw he was very much on the hustle with a lot of tables, reconciling to myself that my table just got lost in the mix.  We ask for the bill.  That comes in under 30 seconds!  WTF!?!  So here's my beef with the place.   The wait staff is cordial enough, they're professional and knowledge able.  The managers need to do a better job and recognize it's restaurant week.  The dinning should have been more fully staffed, in my opinion.  For the money you pay to dine there (and I was paying more than most by skipping the prix fixe) you should want for not.  The damn bill shouldn't be the only thing that arrives quickly.  Good job making me feel like part of the quota.    My wife summed up our experience to the GM.  He was very polite and understanding and offered her his card with the promise to make things right if we come back.  That was classy.  I don't know if we'll be back.  But I give the folks there credit, I think they did there best.   I don't mean this review to be a condemnation of the restaurant.  I believe my wife and I were more the victim's of bad timing, and a series of strange events more than anything.   Was the food good?  Yes mine was very good.  Would I go back? Probably.  Am I going to make an effort to go back, even with the promise of a free meal?  I don't know, I'm not in a hurry.",0.985,0.841,0.097,0.062,0.47139657401422097

First off when me and the bf entered the restaurant it was like everything in the place stopped. You know like on an old western movie when a bad guy bursts into the saloon? lol Customers gawked, staff gawked, it was really rude and awkward. We had no problem adhering to the dress code and I wore my most flattering weave so what was their problem?   We felt like extraterrestrials and were treated as such. It was made very clear that we made them uncomfortable and nobody wanted to one take one for team and wait on us. lol. Our waiter, actually the entire staff was beyond annoyed by our presence. We couldn't believe this still happened in the 21st century. An old geezer takes our order w/reluctance. I ordered a seafood sampler as an appetizer which I like to do on purpose whenever I go out w/my boyfriend because he doesn't eat seafood so i'm free to get my big mama on. My boyfriend is an extremely picky eater, he didn't see an appetizer he wanted so naturally he didn't order one. This old man starts goin in on us tellin us how we couldn't share my appetizer. I told him that was ridiculous and if my boyfriend wanted to taste a bite of my food that he was about to pay good money for, then I was gonna oblige him. He thought that we would continue to engage him in a debate but we laughed him off and agreed with him so he could leave us alone. It was funny because little did these people know my bf had no intentions of tasting my food because he absolutely hates seafood. Waiter got all heated based on an assumption. For the remainder of the evening we were watched like hawks   These are some very expensive and tiny portions. They are not worth the price. Usually when restaurants have the one person per appetizer policy, in my experience they rarely enforce it. CFR and their ancient staff were sharing nazi's or we might've been singled out who knows. There was no way we would stay for dinner after the way were treated and policed. We were treated as if we weren't paying customers we stayed to finish the appetizer and 4 drinks.

If I end up eating at one more ""infusion"" type restaurant, I'm going to pull my hair out. That said, Chicago Firehouse is not one of those places. This place serves delicious food with excellent service, no trendy gimmicks. I have absolutely no idea why people on here are complaining about the prices. If you want cheap food, go to McDonald's and quit complaining. When you're ready to stop complaining, save up some cash and go treat yourself. End rant. My husband brought me here for a special night out, and everything at this place wowed me. Upon arrival, we were promptly seated at a very quiet, private table. There was a beautiful flower arrangement waiting for me! We started off with the tartar and some wine (don't recall which one) that our waiter helped us select. By the way, our server was the BEST server I've EVER HAD, hands down. My husband had the Kurobuta pork (which I stole a bite of, and it was delish!) and I had the Peking duck (the caramelized pears and spinach confit were perfect with it!).  To finish the meal, my husband had a tawny port and I enjoyed the Fireman Cookie (a coffee with liqueurs) and we shared a creme brulee. Again, the service was incredible.

We were seated at a table that could have housed a party of ten, so we scrunched up together on one side of the table to converse better. I'm a big sucker for complimentary, pre-dinner bread, but the bread here was just bleh. The steaks were very flavorful and delicious. Every one of our party of five enjoyed their meals. I tasted some of each, but have to say that my 16 oz. Firehouse steak was the best of the lot. It was oh-so-good, but I kind of felt guilty eating the whole 16 oz. thing in one sitting. So, steaks get an A++, but I was disturbed by some things: We were seated next to the bar, and the walls were covered in tiles, which created a cacophony of noise, so it was difficult to converse with my dinner companions.

The wait staff was incredibly attentive, the decor stunning, and the food was second-to-none when looking for a quality steak house.  The best part?  The entire staff knew that there was a birthday at the table and they took time to wish him a Happy B-day as well as bring him some homemade cookies, but there was no creepily uncomfortable song along with it which is greatly appreciated.   Two really big thumbs up!",0.9986,0.707,0.243,0.05,0.6704783950617285

It's customary to add an autograt for parties of 7 or more in most restaurants, and when the tip is automatically added, the maximum that's acceptable is 18% - ideally the minimum 15%. To assume 20% is completely presumptuous and offensive, and in this case resulted in the server getting less than he otherwise would have. To not mention that the gratuity is included on the bill is also downright dishonest, and tends to result in double-tipping when people aren't paying attention.

2009-08-31,1.0,"Although it is quite easy to prepare a steak, steakhouses face a somewhat unique challenge. If the steak is prepared poorly, every customer believes they could have done better. If the steak is prepared well customer's really aren't impressed - they (most often incorrectly) feel they could have done as well with their backyard grill. Thus it becomes very difficult for a steakhouse to differentiate itself and rise above the crowd. That basic premise means that the two inedible legs of the dining tripod become even more important for this genre. Those legs being ambiance and service.  The ambiance of the Chicago Firehouse is unquestionably different. During my visit, they accomplished something that very few restaurants can do - they seated a table of eleven without any diner being cramped or feeling crowded by an adjacent table. This was partly due to their impressive open room. Simply put, it is an interesting place to dine. The second leg of the dining tripod was also accomplished quite well.

We were seated outside on a charming patio, which was almost empty.  I was so excited to have landed at this great outdoor spot on a beautiful day.  I couldn't believe it wasn't more crowded.  Our server approached and was very friendly.  He chatted with us for a bit, explained the menu and took our drink order.  They were only serving lunch, but that was just fine with me.  I decided on a big, fat burger and my friend decided to have the pasta. Our server never missed a beat.  Bread, drinks, anything we wanted arrived promptly and with a smile.  My burger arrived and it was everything that I had hoped it would be.  Sauteed onions, bacon, American cheesy goodness.  Oh boy!  It tasted fresh off the grill.  So tasty.  My friend enjoyed her pasta as well.  All for a very reasonable price. Overall, a delightful experience.  Perfect for a nice day on the patio.  Every staff member was pleasant, friendly and professional.   I felt right at home and I won't hesitate to go back.  Hopefully soon!",0.9976,0.708,0.268,0.023,0.5837261904761905
2009-08-24,3.0,"I've heard lots of good things about the Chicago Firehouse; particularly their patio during the summer.  Sounded like a nice change of pace from the typical set-up of steakhouses.   Unfortunately, Tom Skilling gave us the shaft on the weather, so indoors we go. The ambiance of the Chicago Firehouse is excellent.  It's not too many people to where you can't hear yourself think, and it's not so few people you wonder what the problem must be with the place.  Yes, it was a real firehouse before, so the poles are still in-tact and help preserve the authenticity of the space.  Lighting is dim, and nice mood music fills the air. I ordered (what else?) the trusted filet mignon.  Hello, it's a steakhouse...   It was served with a cranberry colored sauce that I really couldn't determine the purpose of.  It didn't add anything to the filet at all.  Still, the filet was outstanding, although they won't get the nod from me for the best steak in Chicago.   Service was good, but not stellar.   The mojito wasn't extraordinary either.  Prices are comparable with the other major steakhouses in Chicago, but really shouldn't be.  All in all, Chicago Firehouse is a place to check out at least once.  Parking is generally available in this south loop area, but they also offer a moderately priced valet service.  Most things about this place are good.  But, they haven't seen great at the Chicago Firehouse since that fire in the city back in the day.

Plus, the size of the side was so large that I was able to split it in half and still feel satiated. Service was a different story. My dad and I both ordered iced teas. Neither of ours were refilled at any point throughout our meal. The water glasses were always full, however, so props to that guy. Also, the waiter forgot my brother's soup.

2009-02-25,4.0,"We went to the Chicago Firehouse for our restaurant week excursion and I must say, I think they got some new customers out of the deal.   Location and Ambiance: Chicago Firehouse is located on Michigan and 14th Street.  They have valet parking for about $9 but there was ample street parking nearby.  The restaurant is in an old firehouse and inside you can tell that they tried to preserve as much of the firehouse as possible.  They have a lot of cool pictures and trinkets around the dining area so I would recommend just walking around and checking things out.  I would compare it to Gibsons with the exception that Chicago Firehouse is much quieter. Wine:  We got there before our reservation so we hung out at the bar for a little bit.  Their wine by the glass wasn't that impressive but their selection of wine by the bottle was awesome.   Dinner:  We both ordered from the restaurant week menu and almost everything was good.  For starters, I had the lobster bisque which was excellent.  The bisque was creamy but not too heavy and had a nice ""kick"" to it.  My boyfriend let me have his Caesar salad which was nothing special. For the main course, I had the petite fillet which was excellent.  It came with a red wine sauce that was to die for!  Since the fillet didn't come with a side we also got some mashed potatoes which were perfect.  My boyfriend ordered the chicken breast with potatoes Au gratin and that was super yummy.  For dessert we shared my creme brulee which was great and took home a slice of their chocolate cake.  We're actually eating the chocolate cake right now and its excellent.  It came with some red berry sauce that compliments the chocolate well. Service:  The service was great, our waitress was polite and stayed out of  our way but was always there when we were ready to order, needed dessert, needed the check.   Value:  This is why restaurant week is such a good idea.  We wouldn't have checked out this restaurant if it weren't for restaurant week.  Their prices are a little on the higher end (about 20-30 for an entree) but its well worth it.",0.9976,0.772,0.201,0.027,0.5831777597402599

I've been to every steak joint from the Viagra Triangle to within a 200 miles radius and have to say that The Chicago Firehouse for some reason, I just sadly passed over, untill now! It is my new favorite steak joint. First off, aside from the Hispanic Valet talking loundly on the phone while he gave me my ticket as he took my sled for a joy ride down the block, still talking, the experience could not have been better. The entrance is generous, classy, like a mansion. Lee, the sharp maitre d'  was a real Pro and knows how to welcome businessmen. I waited at the bar for my guest to show up and let me tell you its worth your time to go there for just drinks. The place is a Pure Classic Chicago Eatery which makes it very special. One of a kind, no franchise or chain here like, Chris, Sullivans,Gibs etc... Decor - No expensive was spared to restore and reshape this great old firehouse into a monument complete with its shiny brass firehouse pole in the corner! Handsome cherry bar, plush leather booths and club chairs. Mosaic tiled floor and walls. Tin ceilings. The real kick comes from the subtle reminders of its old identity as Engine Company 104. A must see is in the Men's Bathroom. The sinks are the original sinks our proud Chicago fireman used over a century ago. Ladies, I hope you have them in your room as well, if not,  barge in, we won't mind. You have to see these! I love high ceilings in restaurants and this place has them while large plants and Palms are flawlessly place throughout  and really set both rooms off. The whole place carrys a very 1930-40's businessmans elegance. Damn, I miss smoking a Cigar with my pals in places like this. Service - My pet peeve in Chicago are ""Poor bartenders with little knowledge of their job"" don't they know that they get paid to ""Serve"" a drink not ""Mix"" a drink? To my delight, Julie the young bartender was perfect. She was on top of it, friendly and professional as she ""Served us"" our cocktails. Napkins down, nice firm smile, both hands on the bar with a professional ""Hello gentleman"". She took our drink orders while looking me straight in the eye and never wavered or became distracted. I love that. Thank God, somebody out there is training bartenders the old school way. Who are you anyway?...I want to thank you and buy you a drink!  I paid for cocktails and my tip showed my appreciation for the superb bar service rendered. Lee got us a nice booth and we ordered red meat. I was in a bit of a hurry as I wanted to catch the first set at the Jazz Showcase and our waiter Michael, accommodated us with expert table skills at just the right tempo. He kept the pace swift but pleasant.   We saw more of him than the busboys which is the way its suppose to be. He works hard and smart at his craft but makes it look very easy. He was very good. Service at this eatery is top folks! Food - My fillet was amazing...I didn't need to salt this steak and I suggest you don't either. The spices and the grill are subtle enough to let the aged flavor of the meat knock your taste buds on your ass.  The grilled asparagus was excellent as was the french onion soup I had for starters. NEGS - No piano piano player in the bar playing standards but the house music was excellent. Bottom line: Old School Chicago, Classy Joint with good old fashion professional service and great food.

I ordered the Chef Caser's Caesar salad with chicken, and it wasn't very good. To warn any of you who wish to order it, they serve it with a single sliced anchovy. Places don't really do that anymore, even fancy places, so I was shocked, and removed the fish. I've never eaten a salad where there was more chicken than lettuce, but I would've liked an even amount. The chicken was very bland, tough to chew, and dry. The dressing was okay, but also more bland than any other caesar dressing I've ever had. The most flavorful part of the salad was the croutons. I had a lot of chicken left when we were done and there was no desire to have it boxed up. As for my boyfriend, he ordered a burger which was overpriced for what it was. He said it tasted okay, but that is by no means a good review from him. The fries that came with it were so thin he had trouble picking them up and almost needed a fork.

2008-04-29,2.0,"Looks like I'm gonna hafta burn this mutha down.  For the price point, I didn't experience anything transcendent.  The meal ranged from ""okay"" to ""OMG!!  Was that poop?!""  And, the rule is, anytime ""poop"" is invoked as a possible ingredient automatically equals 'not good'. I came here for a friends' birthday.  There was 12 of us which meant automatic gratuity.  This is important.  I was the last of the party to arrive.  Why?  The CTA decided that coming on time or at all is asking too much and it couldn't be bothered.  So, I was late.  Since I was late, I sat at the head/end of the table.  I sat.  The table tilted.  I re-positioned.  It tilted again.  It seems that the table had uneven legs.  Not a big deal - but when you're asking, no, telling me to spend $60 on a $12 bottle of wine, I expect the table not to weeble wooble.  Speaking of wine, we began the meal with various appetizers (""okay""; the escargot tasted burnt and the Oysters Rockefeller weren't well shucked) and some bottles of wine.  The selections were good (if overpriced) but the initial pours were laughable.  Also laughable was the fact that the waitress tried to upsell everything.  ""Looking at a $6.99 appetizer?  Pish posh.  Order the $13.99 one instead!""  ""Ordering one entree?  Kids stuff!!  Order three!  And put some Alaskan King Crab Legs on it!!""  Back up, lady!  You're already getting a guaranteed tip.  Re-lax. The menu was rather uninspired.  I was expecting really exciting dishes and I didn't find anything that aroused my imagination.  French Onion soup?  Fine.  Wedge salad?  Okay.  I wanted to try the catfish special but it was no longer on the menu.  With fish on the brain, I ordered the trout.  I chose poorly.  While my friends dined on ginormous (and very flavorful) pork chops, the waitress had something special planned for me. ""The part of trout will tonight be played by mealy ass fish in a creamy poop sauce.  Bon appetit.""  And the description was better than the taste!  I try to always finish my meal.  But this, I could not get through.  It was awful.  Thing is, despite the rancid fecal matter in front of me, I wasn't inspired to eat off anyone else's plate (except for those pork chops).  But, at that point, I suppose a boring meal is better than one you cannot finish.  Seriously though, having to decide between ""blah"" and ""poo"" does not a good meal make.  Especially when you're paying mucho dinero for it.  Of course, the waitress didn't much care.  After she pointed and giggled at my plate, she stood up on a table a bellowed, ""Yeah, that's right.  I got you to order mealy ass fish in a creamy poop sauce.  That's right.  Cry.  Wail.  Gnash yo' teefuses.  I still get paid.  Complain.  I don't care.  Whatever.  Whatever.  I do what I want!!""

We went in without a reservation at about 9 pm on a Friday, seemed like that wasn't a big deal and could be done anytime.  I would recommend a reservation for any earlier though as the main dinning area is pretty small, maybe 35 or 40 tables.  Every one there was extremely friendly and not pretentious at all.  The old firehouse setting is cool and not over done or cheesy.  They seemed to maintain all the finer points of the firehouse without going overboard. There were several food and wine specials that day including Tres Leches cake, more on that later.  I was surprised at how reasonable the prices on the menu were.  We started with two glasses of Zin that were on the special of the day, pretty good but nothing crazy.  We then got a Caesar Salad, very tasty with excellent flavor and the right amount of dressing.  The French Onion soup was pretty ordinary and we probably should have had the bisque.  I also had the Steak Tartar, excellent.  Probably the second best I have ever had.  Since I went heavy on the starters I opted for the Blackened Catfish special in a red curry sauce.  It was amazing.  The lady got the Pork Chop entry on the regular menu.  It would be an understatement to say ""Best Pork Chop Ever"".  The service throughout the meal was great, friendly, responsive and not intrusive. We had the Tres Leche cake for dessert, although it was not a traditional presentation it was the perfect ending to a quality meal.  It had a few fresh berries and a blackberry sauce, which from looking at it I though was chocolate syrup and I was happily surprised. Firehouse is what you would expect for a quality, higher end meal.  The two of us got out of there for about $100 with two glasses of wine so it is not going to kill your funds either. At this point just looking for a reason to go back. Ring the alarm Firehouse is South Loop goodness. RrL",0.9989,0.754,0.24,0.006,0.5354908424908424

2008-01-31,5.0,"I am planning a charity event at Chicago Firehouse in April, and stopped by the restaurant with two other people last week to review the contract and let them know how we'd like the rooms set up. Vanessa, the events coordinator, is nice and very willing to work with us. She is also very responsive to email and phone calls, which makes me feel as though things will go smoothly for the actual event.  After meeting with her, we decided to stay for dinner. We first sat at the bar for a drink, where I had the best Grey Goose dirty martini I've had to date. I asked for bleu cheese olives, and for some reason these olives were so flavorful that I could taste the perfect touch of the cheese in my drink. That probably sounds gross to some of you, but I thought it was delicious!  Then we were seated and the excellent service began. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly, but not at all overbearing. She brought out the meat tray so that we could see the different cuts, and made several recommendations. We each had the lobster bisque to start. The pastry dough on top was a great addition, and there were pretty impressive chunks of lobster meat in the soup. While we enjoyed our appetizers, the manager stopped by our table to introduce herself and thank us for thinking of them for our event. For our entrees, two of us had the bleu cheese crusted ribeye, and the other had the king crab legs. Everything was great, including the side items we ordered (garlic mashed potatoes and a twice baked potato). We each had a different type of wine; I enjoyed the house syrah. For dessert, I had the apple streusel pie, which had a slight cheesecake taste and consistency, and was very good. My friends both had the nutella crepes and said they were delicious! But by this point we were all so full that I think we were having a hard time eating our desserts. When all of the deliciousness came to an end and we could no longer breathe, we were greeted by the most impressive part of the evening: our entire meal was on the house. Sure, we are giving them thousands of dollars when we hold our event, but I still thought it was a very nice gesture! We left close to the entire cost of the meal as a tip because we felt like we were robbing them or something. While I waited for my friends to grab their coats, I had a great conversation with the host and the valet about Guitar Hero and why it is the greatest video game ever. Random, but my point is that they were very friendly. The valet got all three of us separate cabs very quickly, which was appreciated even more thanks to the sloppy wet snow that was falling. And, as if it couldn't get any better---it was a 1000 point reservation on OpenTable. They must have a hard time getting people in on weeknights, which is understandable because it's not a cheap meal. But it was a great experience and if anything, it was even better because it wasn't super crowded! I wasn't aware of the dress code that someone else mentioned, but I think it's pretty cool. While some may see it as pretentious, I see it as being plain old traditional. Though I will say that one of the girls I was with was wearing jeans, and it didn't seem to be a problem...but maybe that's because it was a Wednesday night. Chicago Firehouse would be a great choice to take parents, in-laws, clients, or anyone else who would appreciate the history paired with great food and even better service, but who won't wear flip flops to dinner. :)",0.9995,0.735,0.235,0.03,0.5904196729196729

The whole menu was amazing, especially the dessert, which of course we got Creme Brulee I would have to put this restaurant on my ""special occasions"" only list as it was quite pricey, but a delicious treat and wonderful experience!",0.9928,0.762,0.238,0.0,0.7895502645502646
2007-04-16,3.0,"Went for Easter Brunch what a freakin feast! Leg of lamb, ham, 10 or so different entrees, shrimp the size of a baby's foot (and just as tasty). We had to roll out of this place. I had made reservations long in advance and was a bit disappointed to be seated upstairs by the window facing construction between 3 huge parties (just hubs and me, here). I would have rather  been seated downstairs so I could witness all of the architectural delights myself. They were understandably busy, the wait staff were annoying (had to practically beg for water refills). Just thought it should have been a more superior experience for the price and the reputation.",0.7419,0.85,0.102,0.049,0.65625
2007-03-07,5.0,"One of my favorite restaurants in the city. I have been there twice now, both times getting their absolutely amazing pot roast dinner. I always love the darker atmosphere and the decor, and am amazed at how calm it is even when there are a lot of people in the restaurant. I can't remember a time I have had better service in Chicago. The servers are extremely attentive and very nice. Bottom line: If you're looking for a nice, dressy-casual dinner, you can't go wrong with this place!",0.9813,0.715,0.285,0.0,0.838888888888889
2007-03-01,4.0,"As a lover of old historic things- having dinner in an old restored firehouse was right up my alley.   The Firehouse has many of the original features of the old firehouse, brass poles, tin ceilings and service that snaps to attention even when there isn't a bell ringing! The menu is solid American food, think chops, steaks, chicken and fish .  We had the double pork chop which was great along with a fillet that was served ""Oscar"" style with crab meat and Bearnaise sauce which was delicious.  We order a couple of appetizers, of which my favorite were a series of three crab cakes.  The wine list is fairly extensive and featured American wines. There is both a casual dining area as well as a more formal one so no matter what you are wearing- you can get the same great food and feel comfortable.  We sat in the more formal room and it was just lovely. For those of you driving- there is valet parking.  And if you are having dinner prior to an event down at Soldier field or other nearby venues, you can leave your car there for an additional fee so that you are not being bothered with having to re-park your car which was a great option. Great food, served in a historic atmosphere with attentive service?  Sounds like a winner to me!",0.9937,0.772,0.212,0.016,0.46248677248677256
2007-02-02,4.0,"Yes, the lobster bisque was great and so was our NY strip steak. But guess what blew me away? The BANANA CHOC CHIP BREAD N BUTTER PUDDING (WITH RUM). I mean, it was really a no-brainer to choose that as our shared desert but when it came (with fantastic coffee ice cream to boot) and I had my first bite.....Ooooooh...I was almost at the point of orgasmic satisfaction. Seriously, this is one of the best deserts in my life. (and I have eaten many) This beats the Godiva choc cake at Morton's. This beats any cheesecake at the Cheesake Factory. I bake myself, so I really admired the wonderful balance of banana, choc, rum and pecan nuts- I could taste all flavours AT ONCE in my mouth. The texture was firm, yet soft. It was incredible.  I am typing this as one very satisfied woman. I can die happy now.",0.9864,0.714,0.228,0.058,0.6125
2007-01-30,4.0,"I kinda stumbled into this place last night while looking for a post-dinner drink with a friend in the South Loop.  We were pretty casual in jeans so I was a little concerned when we saw the ""Proper Attire Required"" sign in the lobby.  But we managed to slip into the bar unnoticed... I didn't eat here, just had a couple glasses of wine, but I was impressed by what I saw.  Beautiful interior and the waitstaff was really friendly, especially the bartender.  The next time I need a special occasion dining venue, I'll give this one a try.",0.9734,0.764,0.236,0.0,0.6003968253968254
2007-01-30,4.0,"I really enjoyed this place. I drove by it all the time and always said I wanted to go there, I had mentioned this in front of my girlfriend a couple of times and we ended up going there for my birthday this last year. We showed up a little late for our reservations so they gave our table away, but said it wouldnt be long until we got another one. I cant honestly remember everything about the food,except that I enjoyed it..I had a blue cheese encrusted steak of some sort that was good, my dad had some sort of really big pork chop with a mango sauce I think that he really liked.  The French onion soup was awesome. My brother ordered the broccoli and cheese and he didnt like it, they returned it with no problem and gave him a french onion soup too. The interior was fancy, and while i was there everyone was in shirts, ties, etc. The service was quick and friendly. And while I didnt get to see the bill because It was my birthday, from the prices on the menu its about what youd expect for a place like this.",0.922,0.811,0.119,0.07,0.4666666666666666
2007-01-29,5.0,"I remember when the Chicago Firehouse Restaurant was actually a Chicago Fire Department.  I attended a seminar dinner here several years ago and the meal was pre-selected. All of the selections were delicious and the service was great. I was so impressed that I hosted an event there about 2 years ago and altogether, I've been there about 5 times. Whenever I am called upon to select a restaurant for a work related event, I have always selected the Chicago Firehouse Restaurant.  You know, last year, Mayor Daley and President Bush dined there for Bush's birthday. This restaurant is consistently great and very impressive!  Believe me, I only return to restaurants where the food and service are great.  This is the place to go! For those living in the South Loop there are 2 main bus lines at the restuarant.  Inexpensive parking is right across the street, plus they have valet parking.",0.9725,0.835,0.15,0.015,0.5912087912087911
2006-08-21,3.0,I visited the Firehouse Restaurant while on a business trip to Chicago in Jan 2006. I loved the interior and found the service and vibe to be sophisticated. The meal was decent but I guess there wasn't anything extraordinary about it.,0.5789,0.881,0.119,0.0,0.8666666666666667
2006-06-05,4.0,"Maybe 3.5 stars.  So disappointing, because this place, a restaurant created from an old firehouse, had potential to be an awesome  establishment.  Decor and service was 5 stars.  Wine list was also good.  The only down fall was their near average (for an upscale restaurant) food quality and execution.  It's not bad, so don't get discouraged to go, because eating at this historic building is worth the price of the meal.  They have an old fireman's pole right behind a booth seat!  Additionally, they have a nice patio for outdoor dining on a nice day.   Their 3 soup starter was interesting because you get to try three different flavor of soup in small cups, but taste was average.  I agree with Marcel M. that their meat quality was not great.  Their ribeye steak sandwich had cheese that was way too strong in flavor and dominated the taste to the point I couldn't enjoy the meat.  French fries were thin and crispy.  The desserts they get from Bittersweet ( yelp.com/biz/3otFjkG6Ev2… ) was pretty good, but not great.   RECOMMENDATION:  If there is an special occasion or a business outing where you need to eat in a large group (8-12) people, I highly recommend getting a reservation to dine at their wine cellar basement room.  You've got to check it out for yourself, it's really cool.",0.9737,0.759,0.176,0.065,0.5777152477152476
2006-05-22,3.0,"I've been here a couple of times.  The meat is above-average, but not superb.  Avoid the place when there is a wedding reception on the top floor since you can hear them dancing or sliding (e.g. electric slide) throughout the night.  I thought a bridesmaid would bust through and land on top of my lamb chops.    Btw, we only go when we have $25 gift certificates from  restaurant.com  (it is categorized under 'T' for 'The Chicago...).  It balances out what bang you can get from your buck.",0.6299,0.839,0.114,0.048,0.75
2006-03-29,4.0,"What a gem! Per it's name, it's an old firehouse converted into a classy restaurant. Think soft lights, dark wood, and wine cellar. I was fortunate enough to enjoy a FULL meal - started with some white wine, shrimp & brie and crabcake appetizers, then continued with their lobster bisque soup, a medium cooked filet mignon (oscar style), garlic whipped potatoes, and finished with vanilla creme brulee to cap off the meal. The service was polite and attentive. My fellow patrons consisted of the mature, business crowd. If you have out of town guests and would like to expose them to the novelty of dining in an ol' firehouse or have business clients and would like to impress them with a fine meal -- all I have to say is that my stomach thanks me and I thank Chicago Firehouse!",0.9747,0.804,0.186,0.011,0.4461538461538461
