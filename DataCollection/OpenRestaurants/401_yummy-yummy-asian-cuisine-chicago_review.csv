2017-08-06,5.0,"We were cutting it close to catching a show and needed good food and fast. My boyfriend ordered chicken fried rice (a staple) and I got Veggie Singapore Noodles. We shared two eggrolls and a lychee peach smoothie. The chicken fried rice was, in my opinion, up to standard. My boyfriend really loved it. The noodles were very delicate and had a marinated tofu that was very similar to chicken in consistency. For a while I was sure they had accidentally given me chicken until I tried it and realized it was very delicious tofu. We snuck our eggrolls into the show - and that was awesome. The smoothie was amazing, I kind of wish we had each gotten one. We talked about our dinner before and after the show. Thank goodness I grabbed a menu to take home.

Since it was a whopping 81 degrees yesterday, I figured I'd stop in. When I walked in - EW. Smelled like Chinese food mixed with smoothie smells. And then, there was something overhead at the door that was whisking the smell around. YUCK.  Against my better judgment, I ordered a mango smoothie - mostly because they had mangos lined up on the shelf, and I was sure that the ingredients of the smoothie would be fresh.  My first issue is that the gal operating the cash register, and who took my money, never bothered to wash her hands after handling the cash I gave her, and answering the phone. She just went right to putting her bare hands all over the mango. THEN, THENNNNN, after she blended the mango, she took the blender over to the sink and started running tap water into the mix. WHAAAA. Oh hell no! I was pretty horrified that she didn't wash her hands and that she was mixing tap water into the mix. It was a waste for me.

Taste was okay but seemed extremely garlicy and not enough honey flavor...I was also hoping for it to be a bit more creamy sauce. Their sweet & sour chicken was pretty standard, not amazing in flavor, pretty thin sauce. However in both my dishes, the chicken was done just perfectly,  Ah well. For carryout orders, they package the sauces separate than the meat which is always great so things don't get too soggy.  Their Crab Rangoon was spot on and the best thing of my meal!

Like a ridiculous amount. Namely, THE HOT AND SOUR SOUP. It's easily the best I've ever had. I crave it all the time now. Get it! My first order was for delivery, which arrived at my house in about 35 minutes, though I do live about a 10 minute walk away. I got: - Vietnamese egg rolls - Japanese dumplings - small hot and sour soup - crispy sesame beef - general tso chicken - pineapple smoothie - kiwi smoothie The Vietnamese egg rolls were meh. They were fine, but definitely wouldn't get again. The Japanese dumplings were very good, and even though it said only 6 came in the order, 12 ended up coming. So don't know what the deal is there, but appreciated it. The crispy sesame beef was... very good. Solid. Not fantastic, but interesting and well done. I was hoping it would have some sort of other flavor, but it was overall just pretty sweet. If you like sesame chicken, try this. The general tso wasn't spicy! I was pretty disappointed. I suppose I could try again and ask for extra spice, but I was really sure that there would be a little kick to it. I figured the crispy sesame beef wouldn't be hot, but it would be a nice contrast to the general tso that I was sure would be spicy. I was way wrong. The smoothies were awesome- particularly the kiwi. Fresh and delicious and just all around solid. Plus- big! So the last but not least- THE HOT AND SOUR SOUP IS MY NEW FAVORITE FOOD. It's DELICIOUS. I devoured the small one I got, and actually went back 2 days later and got a large one. It's just perfect. It's easily the best hot and sour soup I have ever had. When I got the large hot and sour soup (walked there and got take out), I also ordered a beef egg foo young- together it was about just under $16. The portions are incredible. The egg foo young comes with 3 giant hunks (I'm used to only getting 2) and the large soup is ginormous. I am so happy. Get the hot and sour soup!",0.9988,0.691,0.266,0.043,0.5587071669071669

The veggie steamed dumplings, egg rolls, and basil rice beef were subtly flavored. The dishes from the regular menu (rather than the vegetarian one) contained almost no vegetables and were heavy on starch, which is why they're so cheap.  The chicken pad thai had no vegetables in it (not even bean sprouts), only chewy pieces of fried tofu (which I hadn't asked for).  It was just a big blob of noodles coated with a grainy orange substance that probably came from a jar.

I came in for lunch and went a bit overboard when I ordered scallion pancakes, veggie potstickers, and the Mongolian seitan lunch special which comes with a veggie egg roll and hot and sour soup. My favorite was the scallion pancakes. I always love those. Enjoyed the rest in this order: hot and sour soup, potstickers, Mongolian seitan. The soup was pretty good. No complaints. The potstickers were alright, not bad, didn't love the texture of the dough. Almost forgot the egg roll- standard, not bad. My issue with the Mongolian seitan was that maybe I don't like seitan.  Haven't had a lot of it as far as I can remember. This seitan had a kind of fishy taste on the inside. I didn't like it. I'll come back and try a different veggie protein in a different dish. The rest of the dish (mushrooms, onions, scallions) was fine.

The orange beef is fantastic.  I got it carry-out and it was still hot 20 minutes later.  The meat slices are perfectly sized, the breading is just right, and the sauce is outstanding, with small pieces of orange peel in it (some good, others bitter, so you may not want to eat it).  There was also broccoli but that's not my scene. Their smoothies are great, on a hot dine-in day I saw several people walk in just to get those alone.

The place is *tiny* (seriously--sign on the wall says ""max occupancy : 16"", and clearly most of their business is carry-out/delivery orders.  I am not sure if we caught them on an off night, because they were very discombobulated about service, but the food was quite good. I am vegetarian, my boyfriend is not.  I'm quite happy that they had a menu that was suitable to us both.  I ordered fried tofu for an appetizer, vegetarian hot and sour soup, and the Peking Style Tofu (tofu in a brown--maybe black bean type--sauce, broccoli, carrots, pea pods, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, and baby corn.  i had them leave out the mushrooms).   My soup came out first and HOT does not begin to describe it.  It was melt-your-face-off hot. I love h&s soup, and I'm always happy when I can find a veggie version (no meat broth or bits of pork or whatever--you'd be surprised at how varied it can be), and I love spicy stuff, too.  But this was SO hot.  You could sort of get the flavor out of it, but mostly you just tasted BURN.  I wasn't able to eat much and packed the rest to take home, intending to eat it with some rice in it to cut the heat a bit (doesn't reheat terribly well, just FYI.  ok, but not really good).    Then my entree came out.  Mind you, neither my bf's appetizer nor mine has come out yet.  I waited a few more minutes for his food to come and in the interim, my fried tofu appetizer came out.  So I had all of my food, he had none.  So he started nibbling on some of the veggies from mine (no prob).  A couple minutes later, his food came out, and we went ahead.   The fried tofu was plain, but good.  A HUGE portion for the price--definitely something I'd get again.  Really, most of the time, with something like this, it's all about getting the texture nice and having a decent dipping sauce, and this fit the bill.   My entree was probably one of the best sauces, best prepared items I've had at Chinese or Thai places since moving to Chicago a year ago (not counting the awesome curry noodles I've had a couple places, but that wasn't really a sauce dish...), so all the flubs in service were given a bit of a pass.  My bf said his meal was also quite tasty (General Tso's chicken), but his appetizer STILL had not arrived.  Eventually, they came and asked how everything was and if we had everything, and we let them know it was missing, and it came out a couple min later (pan fried dumplings). Between the two of us, our bill was about $35, and my bf has at least one dinner left (though I'll need to make more rice--no biggie!) and I've got two or three meals worth.  Pretty good value for money and absolutely worth eating!

It's a 5 minute walk from my apartment, but if I'm extra lazy, they'll still deliver. I've order many items from the menu and I've loved almost every single thing. The vegetarian menu has a ton of options as well. I wouldn't recommend the Sweet n' Sour Tofu. I've loved their menu so much that I'm always willing to try new things, but as take out, deep-fried tofu ended up being squishy and gross. That being said, the takeout bag always includes sauces, fortune cookies, utensils, and napkins, and the ladies at the restaurant counter are nice and efficient.

My absolutely favorite is the sweet and sour eggplant. Deep fried goodness! Perfect sweet and sour sauce. I'm actually drooling right now...... Other favorites include the barbeque seitan appetizer (to DIE for), the vegetable lo mein, and the cashew ""chicken"" (gluten). I also ordered the peking tofu but made with seitan instead of tofu, and let me tell you, it was wonderful. Perfect amount of the black bean sauce and lots of tasty veggies. Also, do yourself a favor and order the jasmine green tea, tasty! The staff members are super friendly and always willing to recommend a new dish or their favorites.

LESSON: Don't order via Internet, at least not on a holiday. The food..... I am Chinese, so maybe I'm a bit more critical. I ordered the Cantonese Pan Fried Noodles. For take-out, they separate the noodles from the fixings. When I got back to the apartment to eat it, I just thought it was OK. I can't really tell you why, but it was just nothing spectacular. Just some noodles and some wet, saucy vegetables and chicken. Just mediocre. The egg rolls were not my type. The wrapper was different than what I'm used to..not the traditional wrapper used on most egg rolls. The taste was whatever. Overall, I wasn't hungry anymore but not quite satisfied.",-0.6652,0.921,0.027,0.052,0.4840476190476191

So... vegetarian... hot and sour soup on every order... absolutely a must.  I absolutely love it.  For 3.95, you get a HUGE container of this soup that can easily serve two.  Today, I ordered this, along with the soy gluten corn soup, which was also delicious.  Everything I get here is awesome.  Last time I was in the restaurant, I ordered the MaPo Tofu, and I think another meat-eating friend ended up eating most of it.  I had a weird craving yesterday for egg foo young, and although it isn't on the vegetarian menu (which is really, I think, vegan)... I was able to order the ""chicken egg foo young"" and make a note online indicating that there should be no chicken, only vegetables.  It was delicious and hit the spot. As for meat, I don't have a ton to recommend, only because every single time we order from here, my boyfriend orders the Sweet and Sour Chicken.  He says it's the best he's ever had, as is admittedly addicted to it.  He used to order a separate Hot and Sour soup with meat, which I got to say looked delicious, but he likes their veggie version so much, and you get so much per order, that he likes just ordering the veggie version now.  Every time I've brought people to the restaurant, mostly all meat-eating, they've loved everything they've ordered. Now, this really is mostly a review of take-out, as although I will eat in on occasion, there really is pretty much zero ambiance, and looking at how distracted the staff can seem sometimes, it's a wonder they can turn out really such spectacular food, which they do every single time.  You're not going to get witty banter from your waiter, but you're going to get good food, and fast service.  Despite this, I really have no reservations about leaving five stars for this place.  Very, very good.",0.9984,0.761,0.215,0.024,0.5971605061605063

2012-03-03,5.0,"Whatever you want or miss from being vegan that is at a Chinese place, they have it.  Hands down, in my top 3 vegan places in Chicago.  Pretty much anything you get off the vegan menu is amazing. But make sure you specify vegan for many items because sometimes they have a real meat equivalent. My favorites: Mongolian Seitan - this usually must always be ordered from someone I'm with. It is so good! It's made with seitan (obviously), and has a sweet sauce to it, they must fry it because sometimes the seitan can be a little crunchy on the outside. There can be a lot of green onions sometimes, but you can always order without it, and it comes on a bed of white fluffy rice things that look like styrofoam? I'm not sure what they are actually called. Other asian places will use it too.  Pan Fried Schezwan Tofu - so good! cheaper than the other fake meat items on the menu, but the tofu is fried to a crispy outside, and the sauce is amazing! Other items with this sauce like the Wonton's with Schezwan Sauce are also amazing! Hot and Sour Soup - yes, vegan, hot. and. sour. soup. it's amazingly cheap at under $4 and a portion sized for 2. This is what you need when you feel sick. It will definitely get you moving again.  Veggie Wonton Soup - this used to be my go to soup before I switched over to the hot and sour soup. I still get it too, where else are you going to get amazing vegan wonton soup in Chicago?  Sweet and Sour Soy Gluten - Delicious once again! Sweet and sour sauce with fake meat. They are a little crunchy little balls of gluten covered with sweet and sour sauce. General Tao's Soy Gluten or Soy Protein - They like to say the soy protein is like shrimp and the soy gluten is like chicken. They are definitely very different tasting, and I can see where they are going with that comparison, either way you have your choice. I personally lean more towards the gluten, but many other friends lean towards the protein. It's just a personal preference.  Now, because there are just so many amazing things on their menu, I don't feel like I should continue down the line on all the things I've eaten there, because I'm pretty sure I have eaten about 95% of the vegan menu at one point or another and the menu is big enough. The things above are my highlights. They have many, many options. Noodles, rice, soups, appetizers, etc. Not to mention smoothies! I almost forgot the smoothies! They are great!  They have 4 different types of fake meats: seitan, soy gluten, soy protein, and wheat gluten.  They aren't just limited to chinese items, although that is their main focus. They do have some korean, thai, singapore, and japanese things on the menu as well.  They also have lunch specials during the week that have some of the vegan items on it. That is a great deal! Soup, ""egg"" roll, and meal for usually under $7. You can't beat that! All my positives greatly outweigh any negatives, but I'm going to let you know what's not so great. It is a small place, and as such at times when there are a lot of people, you may not all be able to fit, but you can call ahead. And the bathroom is through the kitchen... I always am afraid I may touch something on accident as it is a tight space. But both those things are nothing compared to how good the vegan food is.

The biggest problem with my most recent order from Yummy Yummy was the dead bug found floating in the order of Wonton soup.  I'd ordered the soup for my wife who was sick and after finding the bug, there's no way she was going to eat the soup.  Refer to:  imgur.com/q2726,O7Ygb  and  imgur.com/q2726,O7Ygb#1  . The other problem, and a frequent problem with Yummy Yummy online orders, is that delivery instructions entered into their online ordering system don't accompany the drivers.  Tonight I added delivery instructions for the driver to use the Intercom to reach me but instead of doing that the driver called my wife's cell phone.  My wife told the delivery driver someone would be right down but when I went down to the entrance of my building I found the driver wandering around and I had to stop him.  He told me he'd been looking around for my unit number, but couldn't find it.  If only he'd have had a copy of the delivery instructions which told him EXACTLY WHAT TO DO. I've had decent, not great, Chinese food from Yummy Yummy in the past.  But this most recent experience suggests to me that I need to find somewhere else to order from.",0.1177,0.825,0.086,0.089,0.43895891690009337

Chicken fried rice, spring rolls, and steamed chicken potstickers.  Pros: It's fast. Normally delivery takes about a good 45 minutes at least. This took abut 30 minutes. It's cheap. Prices are decent. Location is nearby.  Cons: QUALITY of food. You can taste the massive amounts of grease on the fried rice. Can we get a little more chicken please? WAY too many onions. How about add more veggies like carrots and peas? I think I saw 2 carrots. My boyfriend and I ate one potsticker each...at that point, he offered me another and I declined. He was going to eat another, but decided it wasn't worth it. It is very unlike him to turn down food, so it definitely says something about the quality right there. He had the spring rolls. There was maybe one piece of shrimp in each and it was mainly green salad oozing out. I'm fairly sure there was a good amount of MSG in there.

2011-03-02,4.0,"I'll admit it - there are times where I would consider selling an organ for some good Asian food. I love the stuff - so when I moved to Chicago imagine my surprise to find out that a delicious Asian restaurant is right around the corner from me. Cue self-control. I was looking to order some takeout of the Asian variety because, frankly, it had a been a terrible week. Nothing makes me more happy than curling up in my PJs with some delicious Asian takeout and killing my mind with a bit of TV. A good friend had talked up Yummy Yummy, and as I previously mentioned it's right around the corner from me, so I decided to give it a shot.  They have a great variety of food to choose from - Lo Mein, traditional Asian soups, Pad Thai, fried rice and the list goes on. I went with an order of egg rolls and the Chicken Lo Mein. So often with Asian food it's so greasy that even though it warms your soul after a bad day it makes the rest of you feel like crap as your body tries to digest the sodium and grease. Not the case with Yummy Yummy. I could actually taste the ginger they had added to the Lo Mein! The vegetables (snow peas, onion and bean sprouts) added a bit of crunch to the perfectly cooked Lo Mein noodles. The egg rolls were perfectly fried - and even being fried they very greasy at all. The veggie and shrimp filling was cooked perfectly so there was a bit of crunch to the veggies and the shrimp wasn't a soggy mess. The sweet & sour sauce that accompanied the eggs rolls was just that. A nice little hint of spice when you first take your bite that finishes on a sweet note. All and I was really pleased. It didn't take long for them to get my order ready and the portions were very healthy compared to the measly $11 dollars I paid. Needless to say I will be enjoying my leftover Lo Mein for a few days.  The one thing I did notice is that the restaurant itself is very small.  If you want an intimate little dinner with a friend or loved one - this is good spot.

2011-01-18,3.0,"Headline: cozy shop, great pearl beverages maybe a bit pricey, old unsanitary gloves? Yummy Yummy is a classic little Chinese joint. I haven't yet tasted the food so this review is based solely on about half a dozen bubble tea runs. That being said, as someone who spent the better part of a year living in Taiwan completely hooked on bubble tea, I can say that--from my experience--this restaurant has the best pearls in Chicago.  The smoothies are fresh fruit and the tapioca is cooked to perfection. However, the beverages are little more expensive than I'd like at nearly $5 for a smoothie or tea with tapioca, but I guess this is the going rate around here. Maybe I became a bit spoiled while living in Taiwan where I could stop at a tea stand once or twice daily for a great fresh beverage at no more than a buck.  If I could get a drink here for $2-3 I'd probably double or triple my visits. That being said, my only other complaint stems from what appeared to be the reusing of old plastic gloves when my drink was being prepared. I'm not exactly a germ-a-phobe, but I do value cleanliness. I'd prefer my beverage to be prepared using washed bare hands than old gloves pulled from under the counter.

Well, best since it has good food; it would have been a major letdown if the food was crappy, crappy. I couldn't help break into a smile both times I heard ""yummy, yummy"" being shouted into my intercom. Having heard lots of good things about YY, I decided to give it a shot. House of Hunan is my go to Chinese spot, but it's nice to have choices. I love YY's online ordering; not only do I know I have the most up-to-date menu and prices, but I don't have to worry about miscommunications when customizing a dish. I loved the most ordered items part of the menu, very handy for those times when you're looking to play it safe. The menu also had a large vegetarian section. I ordered from here twice within a week. My first order was crab rangoon and Shrimp & Broccoli with Garlic Sauce. The crab rangoon was good. I'd prefer it were a bit lighter on the cream cheese and heavier on the fake crab, but I would definitely order it again. I enjoyed the sweet and sour  sauce that accompanied it - way better than the S&S sauce packets you tend to get. The shrimp dish was pretty good; the garlic sauce had a nice kick to it and the veggies were nice and fresh. The only downside of that meal was that the shrimp were mushy. My second order consisted of shrimp spring rolls and Shrimp Szechuan. My roommate and I split the spring rolls and while huge, we both found them a bit bland and it's unlikely I'd reorder them. I chose the shrimp szechuan as I gravitate toward spicier items. The little chili pepper next to shrimp szechuan on the menu failed me; the dish was good, but spicy it was not. This time my shrimp were done perfectly and accompanied by plenty of fresh peppers, carrots, watercress and other veggies. Maybe if I hadn't been expecting spice, I would've liked it more. I would definitely order from here again. In addition to reasonable prices and prompt delivery, the portions are generous. Both times I stretched my order into two hearty meals.

I prefer the sweet variation of this dish, which is hard to find, and they do it so well.  - Wonton Soup - Such light, flavorful soup. The wontons have a hint of fresh ginger in them and the light broth even contains julienned carrots and snow peas--something I've never seen in any other wonton soup I've had. - General Tao's Chicken - Not spicy even though there were plenty of dried chili pepper pieces in it; fine by me. Otherwise the large white meat chicken chunks are nice and crispy as are the vibrant vegetables also in it. - Crispy Honey Chicken - Same great crispy chicken as General Tao's but with a delicious, sticky honey sauce instead.  - Chicken Teriyaki and Fried Egg over Rice - My 2nd fav item. While the chicken teriyaki is perfect, something about that delicious fried egg on top really puts this one over the edge for me. - Roasted Pork Lo Mein - Big pieces of pork and firm, chewy noodles that I've actually not seen used in any other lo mein that I've had. - Moo Shu Pork - Like little burritos filled with pork and vegetables. The sauce is sweet and garlicky, but a bit too generous for me.  - Crab Rangoon - I love a good crab rangoon and it's something I always get when I'm ordering for just myself. It's a bit pricier than other places, but considering the quality and consistency I've experienced, I feel it's totally worth it.

They dont answer. I call again. Repeat, repeat, repeat. I panic. I find Yummy Yummy on Yelp and their web site says ""Open on Christmas"". Thank you! Made the same order that I would have done at Yens although I think it cost about $15 more at Yummy Yummy. However, they got me out of a potential disaster so I was willing to spend the money. Normally I wouldn't trust a place with a name like ""Yummy Yummy"" because, you know what, I will be the judge on whether its yummy yummy. Be more creative! Here is the dish on what we ordered: - Wonton Soup - Chock full of wontons! Like ridiculous. In fact, the wonton to broth ratio isnt accurate. I never in my life thought I would say this, but I need more broth and less wontons. Currently in my fridge I have 6 wontons with no brother. Argh. However, its tasty! - Hot and Sour Soup - Didnt try. People who did seemed to enjoy.  - Egg rolls (meat, veggie and spring) - All very good! (However, at Yen's you can get these for free with coupon), The spring roll is HUGE with a rice paper wrapping.  - General Tsao's Chicken - Most mediocre thing we ate all night. Didn't taste like much and certainly not the signature taste I was expecting. I would NOT order this again. - Eggplant in Garlic Sauce - Delicious and full of veggies (broccoli, carrots, etc). All drenched in a thick, sugar-y sauce. A great veggie option! - Shrimp Lo Mein - Probably the most tasty in my mind. Lo mein has melt in your mouth with succulent baby shrimp (not enough shrimp, boo).  - Pork Fried Rice - Right above the Generals Chicken. Mediocre, but nice to have a rice option. Maybe try another meat? Didn't seem to taste like much.

I replied. So my boyfriend got the Mongolian Beef and I got the Chicken Broccoli and an extra miso soup.

I had read many positive reviews on how great the food was and couldn't wait to try it out. Upon arriving to Yummy Yummy I was almost shocked at how small the actual restaurant is. Literally just a tiny little rectangle with some tables. Regardless, my friend and I sat down and scanned the extensive menu of both veg and non-veg options. I decided on the orange mock chicken and I believe she had the sesame mock chicken. After ordering I politely asked the waitress if she'd mind turning up the heat (seeing as it was about 15 degrees outside and honestly not much warmer inside, it was FREEZING). She replied that the building controls the heat so I asked if she'd please ask the building to turn up the heat. She gave me a shrug and walked away then returned to ask if we'd like to move 6 feet to the other side of the restaurant next to the heater (ehem, which was NOT on, mind you). Our waitress returned not once, not twice, but THREE times to confirm that I did indeed want the orange mock chicken (did I mention there was only one other couple in the restaurant besides us?). The food finally came after an unreasonable wait and while good, felt more like a bunch of soy gluten balls tossed over some sauce and rice. I wasn't particularly impressed however I didn't mind eating it either. Overall I was pretty disappointed with Yummy Yummy.

I haven't as of yet had a wide range of their food, because the first few things that I have ordered from there have been so good. I should give my disclaimer that I have only ever ordered delivery from them because I avoid going to the area where their actual restaurant is like the plague. Every time I call Yummy Yummy to order something I get incredibly friendly service, despite a slight language barrier. The dishes that I have enjoyed the most are Crispy Sesame Beef, Szechuan Beef, Szechuan Dumplings, Crab Rangoon, Empress Chicken, and Kung Pao Chicken. Those dishes have all been phenomenal for me, with the exception that sometimes the Crispy Sesame Beef is sub-par... and I am somewhat disappointed that they don't really serve the vegetables steamed over the top of the dishes... I just find soggy broccoli at the bottom of a dish not very appetizing. However, all of those that have ordered from there with me tout the virtues of the vegetarian menu... and the goodness of the taste of their multi-ethnic selection. Which I think is one of the most interesting aspects of Yummy Yummy, the fact that you can order in four different Styles of Asian Cuisine! Chinese, Thai, Korean, and even Indian! There may even be something else that I am not remembering. Anyhow, I think I have praised this place enough... I give it Four Stars because it is a great place to order from, they have great smoothies and the service is excellent... even if occasionally the dishes aren't up to snuff for their usual greatness.

Some younger owners bought it, they don't seem to be Buddhist health types like the previous owner and are trying to force the former restaurant to become a bubble tea place. They still have the same cooks when I last went there a year ago, but it was slipping. Maybe the ingredients aren't as good. The place is bland inside now as well. They serve meat now on a second menu - which is average. This is a sad example of a place with a voice that got bought by people just looking to make a buck and trying to do it by providing the lowest common denominator. Used to be a five star...I still give it three just because there are not that many veggie Chinese options in Chicago.

The sauce for the spring rolls is kind of hoison-y? Not peanuty and not like thinned out sweet and sour. Its a nice sauce but the rolls are a mess, for real. Falling apart all over the place with maybe one piece of mint burried in the vermicelli. Even the shrimp kind has one shrimp and lots of vermicelli.

2007-08-29,5.0,"Oh hell yes this is THE place for vegan chinese food! The mock up the usual chinese dishes using tofu, soy or gluten. It's not an entirely vegan restaurant mind you but they have a vegan menu that mirrors the carcass one. It's a daunting menu but i've been learning it mostly by trial and error. I really like the General Tao's Soy Gluten which has a nice balance of sweet, savory, spicy, breaded gluten and a few veggies in the mix. When i order chinese i'm vicing so i'm not necessarily looking for a healthful meal. While some of it is hit or miss you really can't go too wrong if yer looking for Chinese fare.The food is kinda pricey but the servings are substantial. Small dining area but it's clean and tidy and service is friendly  HINT: the vegan appetizer menu is sorta lacking but the regular menu has fried tofu and vietnamese spring rolls which can be made with vegetables only. UPDATE Yummy Yummy log: Favorite so far is General Tao's Soy Gluten - a nice combination of protein, vegetables, sweet and sweet n spicy. Orange Soy Gluten and Empress Soy Gluten are yummy like a sweet n sour. Disappointed in Mongolian Seitan because it was mostly just seitan. Scallion pancake are *meh*. Veg Potstickers are too 'bready'. Szechwan Veg Dumpling is same as Veg dumping with szechwan spicy sauce dumped on. Szechwan Veg Wontons are soft wontons similar to dumplings with szechwan spicy sauce dumped on. *meh*",0.9922,0.699,0.216,0.085,0.5022624434389141
2007-08-01,5.0,"I am giving them 5 stars, even though I only ever order 2 things when I go in:  Crab Rangoons and Fruit Smoothie. The Crab Rangoons are very tasty, not at all soggy or gooey in the middle.  A solid treat.  Also, the lemongrass soup is good for fighting off colds.  Definitely recommended for cold and flu season. But the main reason why I go here?  The fruit smoothies.  No yogurt or sherbet to mess things up.  Just huge pieces of ripe, juicy, sweet fruit, some ice, and a little simple syrup (water and sugar for those who aren't in the know), blended together in a harmonious gathering of sweet and healthy tastes.  Seriously.  I can't get enough of these.  Aaaannnnd, you can mix up different fruits - Anyone for a strawberry and lychee smoothie?  Right here, please!  Just plain mango?  Right up my alley!  These are so, sooo, soooo good.  I like mine with tapioca, but I understand that not everyone feels the same way. The folks who work here are really nice, and go out of there way to please their customers.  It's on Broadway just a block or two north of Diversey.  Definitely give it a try if you are in the area!",0.9631,0.773,0.171,0.056,0.5194285714285715
2007-07-29,4.0,"Some of the better Chinese food I've had recently. Cooked to order (not like the Loop lunch spots with trays under heat lamps), and the sauce wasn't too glommy. I had the General Tao Chicken. I was really impressed with the vegetarian options on their menu; I have a vegan friend coming into town next week and I think I'll take him here.

2007-06-22,3.0,"I stopped into Yummy Yummy earlier in the week to pick up a menu. Quite a big selection they have of chinese food and of vegetarian food. It seemed like all the food they have on their regular menu side they offered a vegetarian option for that very same dish. Very cool.  So last night I was feeling like I was fighting off a cold and decided to get some soup from Yummy Yummy...and a couple of egg rolls. What? Like you've never heard an egg roll can cure what ails you? Anyway...we ordered the sizzling rice soup and two orders of egg rolls for pick up. Order was ready in less than 15 minutes...very nice.  Soup was boiling hot when we got it home...heh, even blowing on it didn't seem to cool it down. Sheesh....they weren't joking when they said sizzling. The soup was okay. I had to add some salt and pepper to it just to get some kind of flavor from it....okay a bunch of pepper, The chicken was really tender and the veggies in the soup were fresh and tender. So besides the actual broth I enjoyed the soup. The egg rolls on the other hand....omg, they were so friggin good. I haven't had an egg roll like that in a long time. Just crispy enough, just greasy enough, just meaty enough....ooooooo, it was good. I could seriously take a bath in those things they were so good. I will definitely be checking Yummy Yummy out again in the future. I'm excited to try their Mongolian Beef....my favorite chinese food dish.  So don't let the weird little storefront of this place fool you...venture in and pick up something tasty.",0.9947,0.754,0.213,0.034,0.5020364434947768

2007-05-29,4.0,"I recently decided to give up the chicken and turkey and become a (more or less) full-fledged vegetarian. A bit worried that my dining options would be a steady stream of stir-fried tofu and pasta, I was so thrilled to stumble upon Yummy Yummy. With vegetarian and vegan options aplenty, in a variety of traditionally ""animal-only"" flavors, it's quickly giving my beloved Joy's a run for my favourite take out place. I love love love the General Tso's Soy Gluten, and the huge portions seriously last for three meals (and a good thing too, considering the moderately expensive prices). Even if I wasn't in the mood for some veggie chinese, however, I'd still go here for the amazing smoothies (best in the city, by far). While living in Costa Rica, I quickly became addicted to my ""Tica mama's"" refrescos, thick smoothies made almost entirely of fresh mango with just a little bit of water and ice. I was certain I'd never find anything as good and fresh in the States, or at least in Chicago, but lo and behold, they have my beloved mango refrescos at Yummy Yummy. Cheryl, the owner, chops a variety of fruits fresh every morning, so there are plenty of other options on my list to try.",0.9905,0.776,0.211,0.013,0.5473544973544974
2007-05-13,4.0,"My friends and I went here to get bubble tea.  It is good bubble tea since they use fresh fruit and have fast service.  We got the mango/kiwi drink.  It was thick and tasted good.  My boyfriend likes tapioca balls and I don't, so I didn't drink a lot =(   My one friend got the watermelon tea which looked good but forgot what his fiance got =P  but both looked good!   Bubble teas are $4.15 (w/tax) which is a little pricey for me.  But since they use fresh fruit and the cups are large, I think it's worth it.   I have never ate the food here and I doubt I will come here again, only b/c I am never hang out around Broadway.",0.9604,0.764,0.211,0.025,0.5771978021978021
2007-04-27,4.0,"Consistent and flavorful Chinese food. The egg rolls were cooked nicely, fried just enough and had a nice flavor to them. The pot stickers were cooked to perfection, but unfortunately lacked in flavor.. they just tasted bland. The Mongolian Beef is some of the best I've had outside of Chinatown. The kung pao chicken has a decent flavor and spice, but nothing exceptional. The best thing about this place is the value, it's pretty cheap for the neighborhood. The delivery is quick, and the people taking the orders speak English well, I've never had a problem communicating or getting a mixed up order.",0.9811,0.725,0.25,0.025,0.5722222222222222
2007-04-02,1.0,"4 stars for the bubble tea - that's it. and for the fact that it's in walking distance from my house with good bubble tea (unlike Argo)..  Love the watermelon bubble tea and mango bubble tea.  They also serve warm milk tea (w/bubbles) which is a plus for the popular chinatown joy yee's bubble tea place.  Haven't had the food here, but am def. a regular for bubble tea. ******EDIT********* Just came here last week with a friend to get two hot/warm milk teas with tapioca and we both had major stomach aches, and my friend threw up while I had heart burn.  Definitely NOT going back to this place. I'd give it negative stars if that were possible.",0.9239,0.764,0.179,0.057,0.45363247863247874
2007-02-02,4.0,"I'm not a vegetarian but really enjoyed my fake-meat Chinese meal here. I had the Twice Cooked Wheat Gluten and it was great!  The texture was quite nice, somewhat like pork but not fibrous.  I ordered it extra spicy and it was certainly that.  My wife had the Orange Soy Gluten, and our friends had the Soy Gluten in Garlic Sauce and the Kung Pao Soy Gluten. The neat thing is none of the soy glutens were the same!  In the orange version, there were little breaded balls like orange chicken (the sauce was good, not too sweet with nice pieces of orange peel).  In the garlic sauce, they looked like shrimp and had a lighter texture.  In the Kung Pao version they were more like pieces of beef.  All the entrees were good though, and we all had enough to take home--if you're good, two can share an entree. The vegetarian hot and sour soup is a huge bowl--enough for four people to share. They also have some really interesting teas.  My wife had the rose, which I thought was very good.  I had the Blue Mellow, which wasn't as good--really the only negative I can say about our experience at Yummy Yummy. Oh and lastly, I can't see why it matters, but this place DOES have a full non-vegetarian menu as well.  In fact it's huge. I wish I lived closer to this place--I'd order from here quite a bit if I did.",0.998,0.668,0.305,0.027,0.580110544217687

It's still a nice option if you're looking for some vegetarian Asian food, but it's quite pricey and I've noticed since changing management the quality has slipped. I used to live for the Mongolian Seitan and last week end it was rubbery and chewy. My husband and I had gyoza, two entrees and I had tea and our bill was almost $40. That's pretty absurd for Asian food, it's just veggies and soy protein, after all. I'm sure we'll eat here again, it's usually plan B if Chicago Diner is too busy to get into.
