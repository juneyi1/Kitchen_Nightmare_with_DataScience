I have been in the area 6 months now and the food is good for what it is "" a late night place to eat if you are drunk"" when I stepped up to the counter to order my food a cockroach came walking across the counter. As I paid for my meal which was already ordered, I said to the guy behind the counter "" you guys should do something about these"" refering to the cockroach. What does he do? He proceed to grab the pad he just wrote my order on and tried to squash the cockroach. Unfortunatly for me he barely missed and actually flipped the cockroach off the counter where it landed on my foot. Unfortunatly I happened to be wearing sandels! Gross! Being a chef with my sanitation liscence I am well aware where you see one you don't see hundreds more. Also I know that squashing a cockroach is the worst thing you can do as this just spreads thier eggs. He did at least grab the small sanitizer bottle on the counter and quickly half assed sanitized his hands. No apollogy was offered for the cockroach and the obvious lack of sanitation in this greasy spoon. Good luck with your experience if you decide to give this place a try.

2011-04-08,5.0,"I just moved back to my beloved hometown, Chicago, from a long, sometimes fun, but what became a very tedious 25+ year stint in L.A. I don't know if it is because so many people starve themselves in L.A. to feed their attention whore addiction - but I found that there really is no truly decent street food in L.A., save a few rolling roach coaches. I was so often disappointed by ""affordable"" eats in Los Angeles, that I pretty much didn't even bother any more. I virtually went to the same restaurants for decades and learned to accept mediocrity. L.A. is the kind of place that expects you to pay top dollar for an unsatisfying meal that could barely feed a child adequately - and be grateful for it. But now that I've been back here - I have fallen in love all over again, with what I believe is some of the very BEST street food available on this earth. Chicago has it all. I'd forgotten how much I missed Chicago street food.  End of rant. Now, back to the story at hand. I had walked by Star Grill on a few occasions while exploring my new neighborhood. While waiting for a 155 bus back home, I decided to take the plunge and get me some food from Star Grill. It had been beckoning me to come in every time I walked by. We were finally going to meet! I was excited. The cook/counter person was friendly and accommodating, careful to take my order exactly as I desired.  I hadn't had a decent Gyro sandwich in a very long time. The ones I had in L.A. always left me feeling cheated. When I got the one from Star Grill, I finally understood why no restaurant in L.A. was ever able to satisfy my Gyro desire. One word: skimpy. L.A. gyros were always stingy looking, sad excuses for that sandwich, with maybe 4 slices of meat. And I am NOT kidding. Because they were mostly bread, they tasted like ass. Not that I know what ass tastes like. But that's the latest word for 'awful.'  When I looked at Star Grill's gyro -- I could barely contain my excitement. I had to really look just to find the tomato and onion -- and sauce, because the thing was overflowing with deliciously marinated thinly sliced lamb and beef. The first bite was so overwhelmingly delicious, I nearly wept with joy. If this sounds a bit much, try living in L.A. and eating their bread-laden gyros and you will know why Star Grill was so exciting for me. This is what a gyro was meant to be. I also bought an Italian Beef, expecting to eat a small portion of each sandwich and saving the rest for later. Well, let me tell you - the Italian Beef was also amazing! Extremely generous portion of very well seasoned and cooked thinly sliced beef on a nicely soaked bun. OMG. Better than ...... (insert word here). These sandwiches were so generously proportioned that I could easily split one with someone and actually got around 4 meals out of them. For under $6 each, that is one major bargain.  They also have a veggie burger - including unexpected veggies like green peppers and mushrooms. The rest of the menu has it all, from hot dogs, chicken, shrimp, Italian sausage, burgers, wings, fish (breaded - this is fast food, after all - tho you can get a grilled chicken); polish, to philly steaks, subs and even Mexican food - tacos, quesadillas and burritos and salads .... Wow! Seriously, if you can't find anything to eat here, there is something wrong with you. I am certain that every item on Star Grill's menu is stellar and this will be my go-to for fast food -- that doesn't taste like that sanitized crap that Mickey D's serves. So blessed to have this place in my neighborhood! And it is open from 11-4am M-W; 11-4:30 Th; 11-5am F-Sat and 2-2am Sunday!",0.998,0.71,0.197,0.093,0.514463097877732
