2017-05-12,5.0,"I love stumbling across little hidden gems like this in big cities.  This cute little French-bistro inspired cafe is very easy to miss, and is most likely a guarded secret for those living nearby!   The decor is very French provincial with kitschy little paintings of Chicago and pets adorning the walls.  You'll forget for a moment you are in Chicago. The service is very timid, and to some may seem slow or unapproachable.  I appreciate quiet service where you are allowed time to relax, take in the atmosphere, and before long you have a glass of water and a menu at your table.  We live lives that always seem hurried, and this place feels like a good spot to slow down, read a book, talk to a friend, or think about future plans. The selections here are limited, with 4 or 5 items on the breakfast menu....but all sound delicious.  From reading the menu, the owner is the cook...so get ready for a home cooked meal.  I had the scrambled eggs, potatoes, toast, and fresh fruit with a cold press of coffee.  Everything feels ""made from scratch"" or ""local"", and the coffee was very delicious.  The eggs were light, fluffy, and required no salt or pepper. If you're in the Wrigley area, it's worth a small walk here to enjoy a simple meal, at a decent price.  I'm not sure what else anyone could ask for.",0.9891,0.762,0.191,0.047,0.5062134502923977

2016-06-24,1.0,"A total dump. Filthy, tiny, rotten AC. We were a large party that reserved the entire 8pm seating. They didn't honor our reservation time and let people from the 6pm seating remain almost three hours while half our group waited outside on the sidewalk. Small, overpriced, school cafeteria-quality courses ""sourced locally"" from the nearest Jewel. No sides--your side is deceptively served as your appetizer. Very slow service. (One-half of our party finished dinner before the other half had been served yet.) Sticky chairs. Tables with art-project paint stuck to them. Smelly restroom two feet from dining tables. Easily the most disgusting restaurant experience I've ever had in 13 years of living in Chicago. The owner is a flight attendant with a culinary degree. I'm thinking she's probably never around long enough to give this place the attention it desperately needs. She should probably stick to one gig. Culinary clearly isn't it. Just a gross, gross experience all around. Never again. This place is a total scam. Avoid it. Eat in your bathroom instead. That way, at least you won't have to leave your house to have dinner in a shithole. UPDATE 2/22/17: Oh, Betsy, please. You bitch at everyone who reviews your rotten restaurant (and I use that term loosely) instead of, you know, cleaning and admitting that your food comes from Jewel. I'm not mean. I'm incredibly disgusted you think your dead-grandmother's filthy basement and supermarket-container food is passable as a place anyone should ever have the amazingly unpleasant experience of eating in.

2016-04-03,4.0,"My boyfriend used to live around the corner from here, so I've been here a few times for brunch and at least a handful of times for the 3 course prix fixe meal on Friday. Brunch is only on weekends and the prix fixe is only Friday nights. It seems that throughout the week, including those weekend times, there may be private events (seems like baby or bridal showers) that book the place, so you may want to call or be ready for alternate plans if you arrive and that is the case.  The place is small with between 10-15 tables in total and the decor is super cute. We've described it as a blend between a bed and breakfast and an anthropologie store. I'm not entirely clear if you can get flowers here, but there is a counter with some right when you walk in. There's a book right on the counter where you can sign up to get on the weekly email list to receive the prix fixe menu each Thursday. From that you can reply and email to get reservations for the $22 meal that is BYOB. The portions can be a bit small, but they are always seasonal and have some unique aspects and flavor combinations I probably wouldn't think of making at home. There's typically 3 entrees with at least one being vegetarian. One of my favorites was an acorn squash with cranberry, walnut, and sage stuffing served with wilted greens. I liked it so much that I emailed about getting the recipe, and she was happy to share. There seem to be some regulars who greet Betsy or the waitstaff by name. We aren't that frequent but enjoy our visits. The reason I'm not giving this 5 starts is only because of the limited hours and the wait time it can take to get food. The BYOB aspect and VHS movies (most recently, Roman Holiday) they show on TVs in each room make the time pleasantly go by though. I recommend it.",0.9855,0.871,0.111,0.019,0.5553776683087028

It's quite small inside with two rooms and a bathroom.   We only had 10 guests and it was a squeeze.  The food was quite good and the owner even provided to go boxes for the leftovers. Overall the experience was not bad, however for what we paid, this place falls short. The place could have been cleaner and was a bit cluttered.  For over 450 dollars, a fee which included a private rental of the space from 3 to 6pm, there were multiple interruptions of our function by the owner showing the space to other possible clients. I found this to be highly unprofessional and offensive. I was already unhappy about the total cost to use the space.

The service was perfect- our server was quiet but very friendly and came exactly when we needed her and didn't come unnecessarily. The food- coffee was strong and perfect, we got the French press which gave the three of us about two cups each. My green tomato BLT was to die for, and deciding what to get was extremely hard- we wanted everything. However, the real show stopper was the salad. It was truly a work of art, which I never thought I would describe a salad as. All the ingredients were such high quality and arranged beautifully and went together like a dream. Oh and the lemonade! Tart and sweet and fresh squeezed. Needless to say, we talked about TFF for the rest of the weekend and I plan on going whenever I can.

It was a really great place to sit and linger for awhile, taking our time with that last cup of coffee so my friend and I could really catch up. The owner Betsy is a riot.

2015-06-12,1.0,"Unfortunately, I have to give 1 star only. I really wanted to like this place and I love supporting small, chef-owned restaurants.  The young kid working is not a great first impression as he was impossible to track down, could not answer either of my 2 menu questions, did not seem to know the difference between sugar and Splenda and took forever to come by my table. He only had a total of 6 guests spread out over 3 tables and he seemed unable to handle. Maybe he has never waited tables before, but at least make eye contact or look at your table as you're walking by to see if they need anything. After he dropped my food, he never came by to check on me and I had to walk over to counter to ask for check. He then refused to take my cash and insisted on bringing me check first.  However, I would be willing to forgive the service if it weren't for the food. I had a cup of coffee that was completely watered down and weak (and was delivered without sugar, cream or a spoon). I ordered the roast beef sandwich. The server had no idea if the sandwich came alone or with anything. It arrived with chips. My guess is Store bought kettle chip brand. Tasty, but I could have gone to the grocery store for a bag. The sandwich was also served with not ripe peach slices and a whole strawberry. The sandwich bread (ciabatta) was cold and chewy and the meat was the saltiest, most inedible piece of deli meat I've had in a long time. It looked like the machine pressed brands that are sold at a deep discount at a grocery store. The tomato was also not ripe and just added to the general unpleasantness of the plate.  So incredibly disappointing. I hope they figure this out bc the place is incredibly charming and has potential especially given the location.",0.4104,0.866,0.068,0.066,0.6056481481481482

At first , we were told that we need to wait for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, no one came to us. But it was OK, it seemed that there was a party there and the waiter was very busy. After another 10 min, someone paid their check and the table seemed to be able for us. A waiter told us to wait 4 a while. Another 10 minutes later, we still didn't have our table. It has been 40 min compared with 20 min. No one came to us, we just waited and waited even without menu. My friend went inside and found the waiter, he asked a very simple question abt how long should we wait and ask for a menu. The host seemed not friendly, maybe she was too busy to make her money instead of answering our question. She just said she couldn't ask her customer to leave because they have paid! It's understandable, but we were very  hungry! She gave us a menu and left. And then, another waiter came to us, he   didn't tell us the time we need to wait, but blamed us not to be so hurry and other customer was important, they would not ask them to leave. But we are also customer only want to have our delicious brunch! The service is bad! The menu is also very common, the dishes on it everyone can cook at home.

TFF proved that to be wrong. It was absolutely delicious! The meat and carrots came on a bed of mashed potatoes and covered in gravy. The dish was perfectly seasoned and not overly salty. The meat was soooo tender, literally I just touched it and it fell apart.

First, the place is quite small and as many probably have said, ""quaint.""   The business model is a friendly restaurant that provides fresh food and flowers, hence the name:  The Flower Flat.  We expected to be greeted with lots of beautiful flowers but instead we just noticed some flowers as we walked in ready to build a bouquet.  Wasn't really a big deal, just not what we expected.  Actually, I am not sure what we expected when I say greeted with lots of flowers, maybe just more of them around the restaurant.  We did enjoy the feel and family-friendly vibe that we got from the place, though. On to the meal.  In short, I prepare a much better breakfast with much fresher ingredients.  I can go to Whole Foods and get way better fruit, well, way better everything.  The thing that killed me the most - they charged $2.50 for some ""Fackin"" or Fake Bacon or that really bad bacon that you basically heat in a microwave or quickly heat up on the stove.  I HATE that stuff.  My god, pony up and buy some real, thick-cut bacon or something.  It probably would be cheaper than what is being served.   I had the eggs with fruit and some bacon, as I mentioned.  My wife got a ham and cheese sandwich, which came with some ruffles or something.  Again, they should try to make their chips or try to make more homemade things. I don't think this spot really makes much in-house.  We ordered a press coffee, which we both really enjoyed.  Forsure enjoyed the coffee. What would I change?  Well, first and foremost, the food.  They need to figure this out right away.  I would have been happier cooking for myself at home, using fresh and real ingredients.  Places like this would end up saving loads of money if they start using better food and making more things from scratch.  Get rid of that fake bacon too, it was just awful. Probably not going back unless these things change.  I would say try it out, there is plenty more on the menu that we didn't try.  It is hit or miss I guess.",0.9678,0.775,0.142,0.083,0.4723394660894661

The 7 of us had a private area of the restaurant and Betsy also setup an additional table for any gifts.  Being a flower shop, there were so many flowers around, along with many quirky items.  The décor is really neat with so many things to look at, and was perfect for our party.",0.9877,0.791,0.209,0.0,0.5688888888888888

She showed me around, explained how she would set up the room based on my numbers and sent me several menus to look at. She was flexible when I changed the menu (a few times) and was always prompt getting back to me via email. The shower was beautiful mostly due to Betsy's amazing food and colorful flowers. I would highly recommend this location to anyone throwing a shower on a budget, since it doesn't need much decoration and especially because its BYOB!

2013-03-18,5.0,"After over a year of walking past this place on Addison, I was finally able to make it in for brunch! I tried the chicken salad sandwich and friends tried the waffles. The chicken salad had apricots, grapes, and perfectly-sized chicken bits in it with just the right amount of nuts. Not overly ""saucy"" with the mayo, and it was delicious herbed mayo, at that. It is obvious that it was fresh and homemade. The bread that it came on was a little much, so I took off part of it.  The waffles that my friends ordered were out of this world. They come with fresh, sliced fruit on top and you KNOW they're made fresh from homemade batter, not store-bought stuff. They were light, fluffy, and the fresh fruit mixed with the syrup really hit the spot.  We came in on a Sunday afternoon around 11:30 and were seated right away. If you come and there are no tables, there isn't much room to wait in the restaurant. It is absolutely worth coming to try, though. VERY quaint and adorable.

2013-03-04,5.0,"This is a PERFECT place for an intimate bridal shower. With 12 guests coming from all over the Midwest, we chose Chicago as a central location, and we had our doubts about booking a place without being able to visit it. But The Flower Flat had a few good reviews, so we went for it. It's absolutely adorable from the outside--a bright blue door on a brick wall, with some wicker balls strung along the top. Very Pinterest-able. When you walk in, it truly is like entering someone's home. There are knick-knacks, pillows and mismatched chairs all over the place. Still, it's not cluttered--it's a perfect mix of quirky, whimsical and cozy.  Betsy was great to work with. She whipped up a menu customized for us and basically gave us free reign of the space. We brought champagne and a few decorations to go with the wedding theme, but TFF took care of the rest! We all thought it was so charming all on its own. The food was delicious and fresh. We got caprese, egg strata, chocolate waffles, and some sandwiches with hearty chunks of beets and artichokes. The tea and coffee is brought out in your own personal French press. Plus, Betsy and ""Junior,"" the guy serving us, were responsive to our every beck and call.  The best part? It's super affordable, and that's not just relative to Chicago.

Also, our waiter came by to take our order, didn't write it down, and then came back after about 10 minutes to say he forgot the order.

I ordered the Jasmine, which was smoked salmon with flatbread, cream cheese, shallots, and lettuce.  The salmon was fine, exactly what I would expect, and it was actually a good amount of it.  However, the cream cheese looked more like sour cream, which to me says that it'd been sitting at room temperature longer than I would like to be.  (I understand it may be ""spreadable"" cream cheese, but it was more soft than that).  The lettuce had dark spots in a few places, so it wasn't exactly fresh, and the flatbread was perhaps the most disappointing part.  It literally just said flatbread on the menu, so I was expecting like a pita-like bread.  It ended up being 2 large flatbread cracker sheets.  For $10, it was overpriced.  My boyfriend ordered an eggs dish (I forgot which one), and I had a bite of the potatoes, which were not crispy and underseasoned.  I liked the jam that accompanied his toast - it was more of a cherry flavor, something different.  Overall though, his entree was not any more impressive than mine.  The service did not meet my expectations.  When I first walked in, no one was there to greet us, and so we had no idea if we just sat down/where to sit.  I noticed a few subsequent customers also experienced the same situation.  Our server (who seemed to be the only one in the entire place) was awkward and not cheery.  Bottom line:  I was let down my today's experience, but I am willing to give it one more try - perhaps it just wasn't the best timing and I didn't choose the right dish.  At this point though, I'd much rather go to Ann Sather, which I know I'll get better food and service for the same price.",-0.9112,0.842,0.062,0.096,0.4903751803751803

A perfect spot for a leisurely lunch with mom or the girls! The coffee is Intelligentsia, served French press-style (I like). As others mention, the space isn't terribly large, so you may have to wait if you arrive during peak times (weekend brunch hours). Conversely, during weekday off-hours, don't be surprised to have the entire place to yourself (it's homey; not intimidating). I tried the chicken salad sandwich, and it didn't disappoint as it had just enough mayo.

2011-10-16,5.0,"I discovered Betsy's Flower Flat as I work out at FFC - E Lakeview, and needed a healthy, yet less-pricey alternative to Whole Foods.  From Day 1, Betsy and her staff have been beyond attentive.  First of all - I've never had a ""bad"" meal there.  If there's something not to your liking, she/her staff will make it right with you.  Second - remember, this is one chef, and a very small kitchen, which Betsy inherited and brought up to par when she and family purchased the place.   It's amazing what she and her husband and team have done to bring the businesses (cafe and flowers) to stunning new heights. With the increased popularity of her place, and with some neighboring dining-based businesses closing, she is becoming more popular on weekends.  Like others have mentioned in their reviews - if you walk by and there are a few tables, go on in.  If there's a long wait and your schedule doesn't permit relaxing at a meal (which I and other professionals desperately need to be doing these days), then check in later, or on another day/time. The Friday Prix Fixe meals are out-of-this world!  Get on her mailing list.  I was a frequent solo diner due to my workout schedules, but I've met some stunning neighborhood locals - either single/coupled, various ages - and we all are now TFF buddies, sharing our good times and bad in today's hectic work world. I'm not a coffee drinker, but for the many good reviews on her coffee, I would say give it a try. Her menus are self-created - done with expertise craftwomanship, and reflect her Southern heritage and love of expert cooking.   I've used her cooking services on numerous occasions to feed my ill Mom (who has severe dietary restrictions due to her diabetes and tumors) and have also contracted out to provide portions of meals for family parties.  Her Honey Mousse is to die for, amongst her other dishes.   Betsy uses high-quality ingredients, and shops for fresh, wherever it may be.  Vegetarians are welcomed here...as are meat-lovers.  Any fellow Kentucky natives out there?  Try her Henry Bain sauce...it's stunning. Her staff are loyal to her and to her customers.  Remember, weekend brunches can get jammed - and it's not uncommon for her place to go from nearly-empty, to two parties of 14.   Patience is a virtue...her food is worth waiting for. The Flat's decor is meant to be art-inspired, and she makes no bones about her decor showcasing local and other well-known famous Midwestern artists. As an Andersonville resident who has defected ""South"" to get good home-cookin', I heartily recommend Flower Flat.  If, (like at any other restaurant), the meal doesn't ""wow"" you  - give it another chance.  Like all aspects of life, we have ""up"" and ""down"" days and related experiences.",0.9891,0.809,0.135,0.056,0.5234829725829726

I was a little surprised when we arrived and found out that Flower Flat only serves basic coffee (no lattes, cappuccinos, etc.), but Intelligentsia was their brew, and it arrived at our table in a French press, both of which my companion commented positively on. And, it was delicious. Win. Despite us low-balling the order with just drinks, our server was attentive throughout the visit, checking back twice to see how we were doing. Apparently they closed at 3:00 for the day, but we stayed from 2:45 to 4:00 and no one interrupted us or tried to boot us out. That may have literally saved the date right there. Double win. The decor was pleasantly quaint, and while the two seating areas were small, I asked to be seated in the nook off to the right where there were two empty tables, which ended up being a nicely quiet, private spot (owing more, however, to the small crowd at that hour).

I liked the decor, and how laid-back the service was.  I started by ordering coffee-- decaf, which may have been by downfall. It took them about five to ten minutes to get it to me, because they brewed it up fresh for me. No complaints there, I actually thought that was rather nice, but then I tasted it, and I have to say, they seem to have purchased the lowest quality beans available for my cup of coffee. You know that edge of saltiness that coffee gets when your roast includes a little too much of the hulls and not enough beans? This was entirely that flavor, plus a little added bitterness. Bleh. They gave me a full French press of it, and I barely drank one small teacup's worth, and that was sheer willpower. I ordered the portobello sandwich, which actually was perfect-- the portobello was well flavored and cooked to the right consistency, the overall combination was tasty, and I appreciated the fresh fruit and cucumber salad side. My boyfriend, however, had the BFF sandwich, which turned out to be a hulking stack of sandwich meat on a pretty ordinary bread. He said there was no way any person could eat a sandwich stacked that high, and the overall flavor-mix was very poor. After eating less than half, he declared it a failure, and tried to order some waffles instead. The waitress looked a little nervous, and told us that it would take a while, since they had kind of a backlog in the kitchen-- would we like the waffles to go? At that, we said to scrap the waffles, and we took the check and left. Overall, a mediocre experience. I could have overlooked my boyfriend's disappointment with his sandwich, because he's kind of a baby about new food anyways, but combine that with their inability to serve us something in its place, and the godawful coffee, and I don't think we'll be back.

The decor is adorable, the food was fresh and scrumptious (I had the best BLT of my life, my husband had a roast beef sandwhich, and the pasta salad with fresh mozzarella was to die for), and Betsy and the rest of the staff were so warm and friendly. Will go back, no doubt about it.",0.9537,0.702,0.216,0.082,0.3993055555555555

2009-07-15,2.0,"The Flower Flat which also has a Cafe' that servers what I would say as a little over priced. Nice Theme going on, but they miss it with the food. There Special of the Day wasn't anything Special. The Flower side of the flat as OK. Not a big choice on flowers. Everything is $2.00 or $2.50 a stem. Lots of Tulips if you WANT. There $2.00 a stem, that's $10.00 if you want 5. A bit Over Priced.",0.9309,0.777,0.2,0.023,0.4366071428571428
2009-05-17,4.0,"Looking at Robyn's review, I'm puzzled how anyone could give this wonderful little treasure such a poor review over it being dirty (the only dirt I saw was in flower pots) and a breakfast burrito (which they don't serve.) I blame drugs...and maybe PMS. I was staying in the neighborhood for a wedding and this place was awesome.  I had the BLT with heirloom tomatoes and fresh basil mayo...very satisfying.  The decor is fun and eclectic with lots of original art by local artists.   Kind of a hidden treat that one might pass unnoticed if they were on the opposite side of the street.  But if you're nearby this is a great place for breakfast or lunch!",0.9665,0.7,0.227,0.073,0.6137254901960785
2009-04-25,5.0,"This place is right around the corner from where I work and I never really noticed it until this one day I was walking in the rain and it sort of caught my eye.  Because of the glowing reviews here on Yelp I stopped one day for a carryout menu so I could try a carryout order on a lunch break.   The owner was very friendly and helpful and I called a few days later for a portobella sandwich.  When I arrived to pick it up I was so enchanted by the positive energy of the space that I ended up eating it there.  The sandwich was amazing.  The best portobella sandwich I can remember having.  A day or so later my boyfriend and I had lunch there and I had a BFF Benedictine Sandwich and a cupcake and it was similarly wonderful.  The BFF Benendictine was more suited to a lighter appetite as I just about inhaled it.  So I think next time I'm feeling ravenous I'll stick with the portabella.  I enthusiastically look forward to trying the salads and breakfast items!  I'm a big fan. Also, a note about some of the older reviews on here that are a little uneven: this business changed hands a while back so if you haven't been in here since Betsy took over, you owe it to yourself to pay this place another visit.  She's a nice lady and does a great job over there.",0.9939,0.782,0.204,0.013,0.4007632718159034
2009-04-23,5.0,"This is EXACTLY the kind of place Yelp reviews were made for!  Fun, eclectic, ""hidden-gem,"" tasty, and totally one-of-a-kind authentic-- you name it, it's here.  This isn't a restaurant per se, it's actually a flower shop/cafe hybrid, serving a small assortment of brunch-with-mom kind of items: eggs, breakfast and lunch sandwiches, french toast.  Coffee is prepared and served in a French press, which is not only a nice touch but a better coffee experience all around.  Still water is served in a re-used oversized glass bottle.  You get the idea... it's very European. The food may have that ""made-at-home"" vibe that some other Yelpers have noted, but there's nothing amateurish about it.  I thought my roast beef sandwich was sumptuous, and the chicken noodle soup they tacked on as a special at $1 extra was superbly original and full of flavor.  To boot, the waitstaff is effusively friendly, and you might even find yourself chatting neighborly with some of the other guests too! The space is cramped, so don't be surprised if you're out of luck for a seat, but this is the kind of place where if you're walking by and in need of some food, just pop your head in and see if there's room.  If there is, it's worth it.  If there's a wait, you might want to keep on walking because guests seem to linger a little longer than usual due to the cozy, subterranean setting.",0.9704,0.876,0.108,0.016,0.516547619047619

I felt I had found a little piece of HEAVEN in this large city. I Enjoyed the Soup which was Lental, which was served with a Toasted Flat Bread. As for my sandwich I very much Enjoyed the Hazelnut Chocolate Sand.. While eating I was able to Watch a DVD that they had playing.

2009-03-22,4.0,"This place is so charming, so quaint...it felt less like a cafe and more like a chic country kitchen. We went at 10 am on a Sunday and there was no wait, despite the small dining room.  There seemed to be more of a rush toward the 11 am hour.  The coffee is great, served to you in a pot, so you can refill your mug as needed.  The food was really good.  I had chocolate bread french toast.  Delicious! The prices were incredible. For two of us, each getting a french toast dish and a side of bacon, and for a pot of coffee, the bill was only 20 dollars.  I couldn't believe it.   The flower shop is attached, and also very adorable, having a Parisian feel to it.  The owner was very nice and cheery, making you feel at home, and she did the cooking herself.  I will definitely be going back.",0.9871,0.772,0.214,0.013,0.6009803921568627

She went  the next weekend and her taste buds were equally delighted. Check this spot out. Flowers in the entrance, good people, a big dog and an owner who plays the Recorder.

2008-04-02,2.0,"Walking into this place is like walking into your grandpa's basement.  Dusty, messy, eclectic, and whimsical, it's worth seeing just for the anti-establishment, bohemian experience.  The Flower Flat Caf used to just be the Flower Flat, a flower store, but then a couple years ago, the owner decided to use the second small room to serve food.   We had the Saturday $5 special- a burger (beef, turkey, or veggie), a small side salad (spinach with balsamic vinegar), a small fruit salad (with a small squirt of Reddi Whip), and their signature grilled mashed chive potatoes (interesting but not good or bad).  Nothing was particularly fresh- my veggie burger was definitely from the grocer's frozen section and the peaches in the fruit salad were canned- or tasty, but for the price, it was interesting.   Servers were college-age students just hanging out, talking about weekend plans with each other and the owner takes the check.  Both of the fish tanks are overrun with algae, allowing the fish inside to hardly be seen.  There's really nothing restaurant-y about this place; it's more like stopping by your friends' apartment and they fixing you a quick lunch from their pantry.",0.9559,0.842,0.123,0.034,0.4089026915113872
2007-01-27,5.0,"So easy to miss, this little spot is tucked away on Addison near Broadway.  I went here on a lunch date today and had french toast....yummy to the max.  It was filled with walnuts and berries and was in unconventional shapes.   The decor was so random..lots of jewel coloured vases and drawings of VWs and best of all the space next door is a florist.  My meal was followed up with a bunch of hyacinth that the owner/cook/florist gave me upon finishing my meal.  I'm kind of a southern girl so the art of lagniappe is something that i'm all about! So surprised to find this one tucked away in the city of Chicago...definitely has a small country town character to it.
