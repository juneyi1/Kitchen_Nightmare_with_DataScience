2017-08-28,3.0,"Hopleaf is unexepectadly cooler and bigger inside than what you might expect from a street view...and it is for this reason that one of my co-workers (who knows how completely obsessed I am with Yelp and trying awesome local joints) suggested that we celebrate my last day at our company/the start of graduate school by coming here.  So, we made a hop, skip and a jump over to Hopleaf...I assume it's gotten it's name from from the hoppy leaves that make up the composition of their many beers... For a beer lover, this definitely is a bar that should be a stop along the drinking route.  There are several beers on tap here - I might be slightly off in this assessment, but I'd say that half the selection is a mixture of pale ale's and IPA's  (with a fee other random, married beers thrown in the mix) and the other half being Belgium beers.  There's a fair mixture, but I know some of my co-workers left being slightly dissatisfied with the selection.  I enjoyed all my beers, especially because they seemed slightly more affordable than those found at bars in the same Andersonville area.  (For those that are not beer drinkers, there is a full bar and wine options). Out of the many things on the menu, only one thing stood out to me and that was the CB&J sandwich (which has fig and some sweet aioli with cheese)...it was scrumptious.  My mouth is watering now just thinking about it.  The fries that came with it were pretty good, but the Mac n' cheese was gross...as my co-worker put it: ""it tastes like the iron skillet it was made in"". I spent a lengthy amount of time here, partying it up with my co-workers and friends...it is easy to hang here for a while, especially if you get there before the rush and find good seating.  Now, to have the best experience you don't want to sit in what my friend says is the ""bougie"" side (the side where you walk into), but rather walk to the other open area that connects to the beer garden!  Granted, that's the side that gets busier and it's the side where the bartender lost my friend's credit card, but I still liked that side better.  But yes, the bartender lost her card and couldn't find it anywhere...thankfully her drinks and meal were comped, but my question is, ""how the neck did they lose the card?"".  Though this bartender was friendly, some of the other staff were not so friendly and that's always a no-no for me.  If I could, I would give this place a 3.5 - it's good, not great but you could probably find me wandering back inside at some point.",0.997,0.789,0.17,0.041,0.4811742424242425

Our drinks took a while to get to us, but we're very good and very affordable, though at this point our server was VERY quiet and awkward. We got our appetizer and it was great. The server didn't ask if it was though. Our entrees came and were great as well, but my girlfriend ordered steak, and our server didn't ask if it was cooked correctly (whichmy food service people know is the first thing you ask). The portions were massive as well, which was a very pleasant surprise.  The server didn't really check on us even when our drinks were dwindling. We asked to speak to a manager, and lo and behold, it was our server. We voiced our complaints, to which she was receptive and apologetic.  All in all, five stars. I get it, the patio was packed. You probably had a long day. Your other tables were probably dicks. You may not wait tables normally. I've been there. Shits tough. The rest of the shop was running super smooth though, so props to you.

After having called Hopleaf to ask if we could come by there bar for a beer and confirming that they would have room for us on a Saturday afternoon, we stopped in.  This was our very first stop. Keep in mind that I'm the youngest of the group, so we are all grown adults and we were all very sober. Upon arriving to Hopleaf, without so much as a hello, someone who seemed like a manager and the man working at the front door immediately said to me ""we do not take bar crawls"". I said ""I confirmed that we could come by. We're not on a bar crawl. We just wanted to have a beer and hang out at your bar"". He interrupted me and asked who I had talk to. At which point I said ""if you do not want our business, I do not want to give it to you"". Our trolley driver was very put off by this and went into talk to the men. He felt it necessary to tell them that we were a good group of people, and that we were not drunk. After which they said that we could come in, but at that point I refused to spend a dollar in there bar.  We would have brought them hundreds of dollars of business. Clearly they were too interested in being snobs and extremely rude to get that business. I have never experienced such awful customer service (and I have worked in the industry).

There's also a patio.  Keep in mind that the upstairs beer menu is slightly different than downstairs (less expansive, but still expansive none the less). This is a good spot to explore exotic beers you've never tried before or may be intrigued by. You can get a 24+ oz speciality bottle and share as well (if you and your comrades can agree on something that is). Food is very good as well but I would advise keeping it minimal.

The service is alright theyll clean plates but dont give recommendations or describe menu items they prefer to gossip instead so train them better must orders: charcuterie/ brisket sandwhich/wings/ cb and j/ duck Rueben/ goat cheesecake  Chicken wings 13$ amazin these were so flavorful u could taste all the spices they put on it i liked the addition of cilantro for freshness and the lemon for acidity just combine the two and make a salad instead. My only complaint is plz make them crunchy they were soggy best wings at dos urban cantina these were still amaizin though  Duck rueben 15$ amaizin one of the best dandwhiches i ever had. The bread was supper buttery and toasted the duck was supper tender and flavorful. The sauerkraut was really acidic to cut through the richness. My only complaints is to put more condiments inside dont be cheap after a couple of bites filling is gone  Pomme frites: ask for extra aioli youll thank me. The fries are so crispy without being creasy their not over salted or under salted. Only complaint is to use a unique seasoning or some truffle oil to give it pop. The aioli is so rich and decadent i have no complaints these fries would be my last meal you guys should add some cheese to it too! Cbj  (picture like a cheese plate in a sandwhich) the bread was supper buttery but not toasted as good as the rueben.  The inside is a combination of sweetness from the figs  richness from the ricilite n cashew butter adds savoryness and the mac n cheese adds that funky cheese plate flavor. Only complaint plz dont skimp put more of the ingredients in the sandwhich Beet cake $8 good not great tasted like a carrot cake. Cake was a lil dry. I was expecting more complexity but it was very one dimensional jus sweet and acidity and some wow factor to this still a good fish but u guys can do better  Goatcheese cake $8 best cheese cake ever. The cheese cake was supper smooth like a mouse had the perfect balance of acidity and sweetness. The bottom was supper crunchy and salty so it added texuture the salt cut through the sweetness the blueberry sauce was amaizin adding acidity and sweetness.

Was told that we have 5 minutes to order food. It was fine with our group, we were coming from the show and were hungry. Got to the bar at exactly 12:00am, was told that the kitchen was closed. Why seating us down with the promise of food (big party of 9!) in the first place. Our intentions were crystal clear to the manager. Food first, then drinks. Just tell us, I am sorry there is no time. If you tell us 5 min, and we get to the bar to order in 5 min at exactly 12:00am. Bartender quote talk to the manager, not my problem. I've been to hopeleaf at least 10 times. Love your food and beer,  decided to go to YOU, of all the other choices around, then THIS. The worst services I've got EVER.

It sat  on a sweet potato ""waffle"" of sorts.   Crispy on the outside, perfectly melt-in-your-mouth tender inside.  The duck leg/thigh combo and a duck sausage were accompanied by Brussels sprouts, and a root veg puree and a maple flavored sauce.  You couldn't have done better at a Paris bistro.   Service is always courteous, without being overbearing.  Its a perfect place to sit at the bar and grab a bite, or have a dinner at one of the tables (inside (or outside in the summer) .

2017-03-14,4.0,"Overall, I REALLY love this place....knocked a star off, because of inconsistency in food and service.  PROS: Mussels and fries are consistently great; it's without a doubt my favorite dish at the restaurant. Fries are really good...crispy, and a good-sized portion. Beer selection is always extensive, and it's decent service at the bar.I really like the feel of the place, too. It can get very lively and very crowded when it's in full-swing, but it has a really nice intimate pub feel when you sit up front. It's also a huge place, so when they have the whole place open, it's good for busy nights. CONS: Table service has never been spectacular...it's really slow to get drinks, and hit-or-miss in terms of friendly wait staff.While I enjoy ease and speed of service at the bar, the bar tenders can be a bit aloof, and they're either really helpful, or don't care when it comes to recommendations. Anything i've had on their menu outside the mussels hasn't been consistent. I've had the duck ruben a couple times; it's either been good, or completely forgettable. They don't have a ton of vegetarian or vegan options for anyone with dietary restrictions.  If you go for just drinks, it's a great spot for a terrific variety of beer. Dinner can yield some inconsistent service and food.",0.9938,0.765,0.214,0.021,0.5092592592592593

Luckily there were a good amount of seats available, and we grabbed a table at the bar in the back. I liked the ambiance of the second/back room. It's cozy and welcoming. My husband really enjoyed the huge selection of beer. I was going to have a beer too, but saw they had Cab Franc on tap and couldn't resist. I love Cab Franc and this was a good one. It's slightly lighter bodied but has a great complex flavor. I also liked that the wine comes in quarter liters. I may have had 3 of them.  We started with the sausage plate, which was a decent portion and had an interesting selection. Because we're on a serious diet, my husband opted for the mussel frites and I went with the bavette steak frites. The mussels were delicious and came with a heaping portion of fries. The steak was so. damn. good. I said I was going to eat half and take the rest home but we all know that didn't happen. The outside was perfectly charred with a nice crisp and the inside was cooked a perfect medium like I ordered. It was also seasoned well, just salty enough. It was definitely one of the more flavorful steaks I've had. Shout out to the garlic aioli that came with the fries, it was the perfect accompaniment.  We ended up relaxing at the bar for a few hours and enjoying our drinks. The staff was friendly and helpful. I should also say I really liked the fellow patrons. No douchey/annoying people here.

The mussels are what I come here for.  Always great and even better the next day as leftovers.   Steak was alright.  Salmon dish tasted great but it was undercooked/raw.  I don't mind my fish slightly undercooked as I absolutely hate overcooked seafood, but this was not cooked through to a good temp and was a deep red color like raw tuna. When I brought this up to my server,  she said that the fish is supposed to be like that... Okay...fine, I'll eat it and risk salmonella.  Later on, I found a few fish bones.  At that point, they apologized and gave me a salmon replacement.

So is the cashew butter sandwich with jam. I've never had anything that's blown my mind but everything I have had has been satiating.  The service has more often than not been extremely friendly.

There's certainly a great ambience once you walk inside and experience either the bar or dining area. Plenty of small tables and open seating if you're simply grabbing a drink, and a larger seating area in the back with high ceilings and wall art. Hopleaf certainly demands that you consume some drafts while inside, but that's not the only thing they're good at. Let's talk about some of that food too! We ordered the House-made Sausage Plate, Mussels and Frites for one, and a Trio platter of their Country Pate, Chicken Liver Mousse, and Spicy Smoked Duck Breast. The sausages were amazing and the variety of spices was on point. Even though we only ordered the mussels ""for one,"" it was enough to feed an entire party of three. As for the trio platter, the duck and chicken liver were both on point. My mouth is salivating just writing about it. The pate was also good, but definitely a lot considering the small amount of pita chips we had that accompanied the spread. I'd pass on this next time.

Maybe had to do with the fact we visited on a really quiet Sunday afternoon and opted to just sit in the front self serve bar area. Buuuut, if you like craft beer, their selection is top notch. They had Stone's Mocha IPA which I'd only heard thru word of mouth from my friends back home, and somehow they had it on draft out here in Chicago. The coffee flavors mixed with the hops is trippy. I expected more of an IPA style beer with bitterness and all just due to the color of the beer, but when you drink it almost tastes like you drinking a stout. Really weird but cool at the same time.

Then she claimed that they ran out of the proper glassware and that they would bring a half glass for me later (which they did), but if my husband didn't point it out, I think I would have paid for the 22 oz beer and only got the 16 oz pour. Just read the beer menu carefully and make sure you get what you are paying for. Great place regardless with good food (though main entrees are fairly expensive (over $20 for most) so we stuck to the sandwich menu).",0.9881,0.77,0.198,0.033,0.6284773662551439

I thought the hoagie was delicious - perfectly fried, with a spicy kick from the remoulade. The fries were good too, but just a touch salty for my taste.

Apparently this guy had it in for me after that. I'm a little bit older than their average customer and feel that I was very treated badly because of my age. For no reason at all this ""doorman"" and a skinny waiter walked up to me while I sat at the bar with my first beer and asked me to leave. The only contact I had made there was with the doorman and bartender to order my beer. Something's wrong with those people. I left because it was late and I had just missed the friend I was there to meet anyway, & wasn't in the mood to deal with these jerks. My advice is to avoid this place at all costs.

There's a ground floor with two areas - each with a separate bar - but also an upstairs section with a balcony eating area as well as an upstairs 'patio' (which is just another room). Being from the west coast, I was surprised at how plentiful Zombie Dust was at various local bars. Hopleaf certainly had plenty of this liquid gold of a pale. And it doesn't stop there. Their bottle list was also exceptional. You'll find bombers of rare and limited releases along with some other goodies. My boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised to see a bottle of Bourbon County Rare just chillin in the [locked] fridge. Too bad we didn't have anyone to share it with because while it's wonderful to discover these rarities at bars, BCBS Rare was $70.  Food wasn't too bad. The mussels for 1 at $13 served as a great appetizer between the two of us. The meat board was different with all the various kinds of meats, but scrumptious. The salmon for $25 though seemed like overkill especially for the portion. Whether you want to sit back and enjoy a brew with friends in a casual and social setting or scope out rare bottles maybe while pairing them with great food offerings, Hopleaf has it all.

The menu looks great: familiar yet inventive, and pairs well with beer. But the food just didn't deliver. The short ribs were fatty. I know short ribs can get this way, but our serving didn't have enough meat to justify all of the fat. The duck reuben, which sounded great, was not very good. The flavors were jumbled and the bread was too heavily buttered. The whole thing was greasy and did not sit well with me.

Went tonight at 10:15pm on a Friday (kitchen is open until 12pm) with a group of four looking to grab a few drinks, some dessert, and catch up. The main bar area was loud, so we made our way back to the dining area. We were told by the host that because we were ordering dessert (from the dining menu) and not a meal, we wouldn't be allowed to sit back there where it was possible to hold a conversation at a reasonable volume. There were multiple 2, 4, and 6 tops open and nobody was waiting for a table. When I asked why something on the dining menu didn't ""count"" as enough to be seated in that section, he let us know there was a section around a corner on our left that we could sit at. I could understand this policy on a Friday at reasonable dinner hours; however, at ten o'clock at night with more tables available in the back than in the bar area we were being directed to, especially when we were intending on ordering items ON the menu. We got turned around trying to find the section he referred us to and a woman approached us to explain that the tables we were standing by were also not available unless we were ordering dinner. Again, I asked why dessert and appetizers and drinks didn't count if they were on the menu, and was met with a vague, perfunctory reiteration of the fact that we were not allowed to eat at these tables. I promptly left and don't intend on going back. Ran into a friend outside who was equally as baffled about this policy as we were.

Juicy, great smoked flavor.  Little birdy feathers still on places, but the skin was so crispy that didn't allow anyone down.  There are a few sections in the establishment. We entered from Clark St. Into bar area with booths and a few tables. You go to the bar to order everything yourself in this section and we were fine with that. Beyond that was a seating area where it was more formal, you are seated, etc. And on the south side of the building there was another bigger seating area.

We were very pleased! They served us right away even though it was 6 pm on a Friday. It's a vast restaurant. The place smells great with a fragrant wood stove going. Our server was very pleasant and efficient.  In addition to a few delicious dark beers, we had onion rings, the catfish hoagie, and a smoked porchetta special (super tender and well-brined, Bristol, take note!).

The only flaw was the seeming absence of salt from the meat, but that was easily remedied by the salt shaker behind the bar.

I have been frequenting the Hopleaf for a couple of decades now.  It was an oasis for great beer lovers when you couldn't get anything like that on the far north side.  I also frequent the Map Room and the Long Room.  Unlike these places, the hopleaf has been creeping into a corporate darkness where customers are only #s.  Last night I went there with four friends and we ordered two rounds of beers ranging from great Belgians to the super hopped IPAs that they carry.  Each beer was flat.  When we told the bartender after the first round, he shrugged his shoulders.  When we told the bartender after the second round, he completely dismissed the question.  I then got a round of different bottles with hopleaf ""pint"" glasses for the table.  We poured and within a minute our beers were flat.  we figured that it must be the detergent they were using and not the lines or the beer itself.   Not to hard for a few of us non industry folks to figure out.  but this place couldn't be bothered with the question, not to mention the answer.  The other, and more corporate bullshit thing that we found out when we poured the 12oz bottles into the hopleaf ""pints"" was that they are using cheater pints!!  They only hold 13.5oz of liquid.  There is not a 13.5oz pint in any country you slime bags.  So by pinching 2.5oz from each of our beers they get a bigger bottom line.  Like a fucking suburban sports bar!! These cheater pints are actually illegal in Michigan.  The thing is, the hopleaf actually prints that they are selling us 16oz in the menu!  you might have great beers but you sucks when it comes to respectability!!  You really need to change to get me back.  Not that you need me.  Your place is full all the time.  But that begs the question: with all those customers, why did you need more $.  You reek of greed more than beer, you should be ashamed of that.  The hopleaf WAS a symbol of quality and integrity.  I can't imagine how your disrespectful ways translate in your kitchen, grossly I'm sure.  I will drive a little farther to the Long room and the Map Room to be in a place where I know they care about the drink and the drinker.",-0.7074,0.808,0.093,0.099,0.41900584795321644

I started with an awesome ginger peach cider and also enjoyed a 5 Rabbit brew I had never tried! Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the draft list and was helpful in our decision-making. To start for dinner, we shared the charcuterie plate and fall Cobb salad. Big warning! The charcuterie plate is definitely for adventurous charcuterie eaters! We enjoyed most of what we ordered, but some of the items were a bit out of our comfort zone. To follow, we shared the mussels and mac n' cheese. Both were a hit, the mussels for one was definitely enough for us to share. While tasty, the dish was extremely salty and the bread that accompanied the dish was too hard to eat. These are basically my only complaints about Hopleaf. Mac n' cheese was creamy, tasty, and super rich. I highly recommend sharing a bunch of things so you can try multiple items! Overall, Hopleaf lived up to the hype. Truly enjoyed the warm atmosphere, impressive beer list, variety of menu items, and solid service.

The expansion into the space next door, as well as the outdoor patio in the summer, has made Hopleaf a realistic group option, even during busy times.   Back when this place was smaller, you had to carefully time your visits to avoid the crowds.   Not really a problem anymore.

Come in a group of no more than 4, show your i.d., grab a space in the first room for the most authentic experience, or continue to the ""new"" bar on the first floor and score a booth (my preference.)

If only! I was here with a bunch of friends because it was the midway point between all of us. Two lived in Evanston, one lived in Uptown, and I live in Noble Square. Midway. We made reservations in advance and were seated once everyone arrived. And then we were given the most incredible beer menu ever. Pages upon pages. The waiter came by multiple times and we just couldn't make up our minds. He gave us recommendations. We'd ponder them. And still no decision. We were horrible - I'm so sorry we were so indecisive. I ended up picking a beer at random - the BOM Brewery Triporteur Full Moon.

If you want to go on a first date (or 100th date), grab a truly nice lunch or dinner, grab a beer with friends, get drunk with friends, or wander in alone at 1pm on a Thursday looking for salted meats, Hopleaf will not disappoint. I met Mark (he cuts the meat at Hopleaf) last week. Turns out that he lives across the street from me (small world) in Ravenswood and told me I have to go try the Charcuterie at Hopleaf. Thanks for the baller tip Mark.  Does anyone else know the feeling of being ""in"" a meal? That's my test for how the meal was. Was I ""in"" it? Were the flavors, textures, ambiance, service and drink so wonderfully harmonized that I was able to escape this temporary and mundane existence by going ""in?"" Oh yes, I was ""in"" this Charcuterie experience all right, and I hope one day you get to dive in too. Just make sure that you don't eat for at least 30 minutes before entering the beer soaked waters.  I asked my server, who was perfect by the way, to please have the kitchen choose which 3 meats I would try. (Note: Just start doing this guys, it makes SO much sense.) I, however, chose Three Floyd's Zombie Dust (they have it on draft people!) as my drink of choice. I thought it would pair quite well. I was quite right. For my board, the kitchen selected Tonno Di Maiale (olive oil cured in ham), the Pork Belly Rillette and sliced duck (it was off menu, and I forgot exactly what it was called). The presentation was beautiful, the portions perfect and the tastes all grabbed my shirt collar. Even the mustard was good. The Tonno Di Maiale was so tender and just the right amount of salty that I almost ordered more. Good lord was it good on toasted baguette with mustard and a quail egg. The pickled beats were also a nice addition.  NOT TO BE MISSED are the white wine mussels. They are very good (although freshness/flavor fluctuates) but the sauce at the bottom is so god damn good I don't even know what to do sometimes. The bread they give you is some of the best bread you'll get in Chicago restaurants and it soaks up all that deliciousness so efficiently I wanted to find out where the bread baker lives and go rake his yard (not a euphemism) for him.  I also have to plug the salmon: wonderful.

No welcome, no introduction, no friendly conversation with customers.  No explanation of the dish as it's being presented.  No knowledge of the cheese maker.  No knowledge of how the soup's prepared.  They're curt, abrupt and retreat to their cell phones.  Watch them-- it's almost comedic.  Severe deficiency in server experience and in need of professional training.   Patrons are here because of the Michelin recommendation and expect that level of service, even raucous, bouyant casual service.    If you want a gastropub experience that will bring tears of joy to your eyes, try Longman where you leave with an empty wallet and a firm belief that food and beer can save the world.",0.5118,0.734,0.129,0.137,0.6038961038961038
2015-11-15,4.0,"Decided on Hopleaf because I know they're always well stocked with Zombie Dust. It has a sharp balance of citrus hops that puts a smile on every sip. Its brightness paired very well with my charcuterie. It was a trio of nduja, pork belly rillette, and tasso bacon.  Njuda is a spreadable spicy pork sausage that has a mild spice with a bold pate like flavor and consistency. It paired best with the whole mustard on toast. The bar in the back was a bit loud with a big party near us, so I couldn't hear the entire plate. The berry on the pork belly rillette cut the fattiness of the pork belly and helped bring out the pork flavor. The star on the board was the tasso bacon. It was soft, fatty bacon that had the essentials of crispy bacon with strong smoky flavor, but instead melted in your mouth. Once melted, the bacon flavor shines through and bliss arrives. The bacon tastes so right. I noticed the tiny quail egg, but didn't hear that it was pickled! It had a med-well vinegar taste and worked out really well, because it cleaned my palette of that greasy feeling. The plate was well organized and would definitely have again. This isn't my first time really enjoying their food and would gladly come back.  Side note: On my way out, there was a sign above a beer fridge that said ""Off-Menu Specialties. Please ask your server!"" How did I not see this before?!? I guess i'll find out on my next visit.",0.99,0.831,0.164,0.006,0.4077619047619047

You shouldn't need me to tell you that and you probably didn't.   But we also got food here (you've no doubt noticed that I spend too much of my time eating in bars) and that is worth a few brief comments:  Some of the items seem like a perfect match to a beer hall with pretensions -- the sandwiches, the brussels sprouts sides, and probably the other sides too, though I didn't try them.  Other items seem to be longer on pretension, shorter on beer hall -- steak frites, rabbit confit salad, short ribs, etc.   Some of the items in the second category were great (the rabbit confit was a big hit), but most were disappointing and I would be inclined to stick to the safer bar fare here.  With one caveat -- most of my table was annoyed by the fact that our french fries were all lukewarm.  (I didn't actually mind, I was just grateful that they weren't limp and soggy.)

The mussels were on the small side but there were an abundance of fries to make up for it (the sauce that comes with them is pretty tasty!). Everyone at our table enjoyed their meal and their beverages. They have a very extensive list and their menu changes frequently so we all had a lot of fun picking out things that you can't find at most restaurants. The dessert was SUPER tiny...I was a little disappointed. The ""cake"" was smaller than a muffin top and the scoop of sorbet was the size of a ping pong ball. For $8 I expected a little more.

I know I've had better in the city at other places.  The fries that came with it were also really not that spectacular, they were fine, they were fries after all, but nothing that really made me want to go back.  Definitely not somewhere I plan on going back to visit any time soon.

If you are a beer geek or know one, then Hopleaf is the place to go. There's an overwhelming amount of stuff on tap, and even more available in bottles, including some rare beers. They specialize in Belgian & Belgian style beers, which I absolutely love.  The food is also top notch. Hopleaf does a great job of providing a certain level of consistency in menu items - there are always mussels, there are always salads - but they tweak the offerings to fit with what's in season. For mussels, there are always two options: a Belgian style & a special style, with the special being a rotating & unique offering that is never repeated. Currently, the special is lobster, and it might be the best type of mussels I've ever had. It's like a lobster bisque, but with corn & fennel, some heat...just tons of good flavors.  The charcuterie trio is out of control. I recommend the nduja, duck liver mousse, and the pork belly rillette. The onion rings are another great bar snack.

We had all the classic hopleaf favorites like the Frites aka fries, the duck Reuben, the sausage trio, and of course the famous clams.   This place is always busy and the manager of the place clearly makes a point to get people in and out.  A bus lady asked us at least 4 times if we were finished with our fries when there were clearly many fries still in there.  The fries by the way came cold.   The famous clams.  Still tasty but way too much salt in the broth and very little meat on these things. The duck Reuben was good.  A little unhealthy with a slathering of butter on the bread but clearly the safest most popular choice here for $13.  It's also a cheaper option. The sausage trio was boring and amounted to perhaps a sausage and a half maybe. The lamb sausage was the best and the most un-hot dog like. The huge German beer for $6 was the highlight.  So 3/5.  It's still a cool place but some of that magic I remember is missing.",0.9861,0.76,0.196,0.043,0.5505952380952381

I chose two Saturday evenings (unwise) and spent most of the time in the hectic first room with the sour-smelling bar (equally unwise). But as soon as I chose some weeknights to head into the restaurant area for after-work drinks and a quick dinner, Hopleaf's stengths and charm were on full display. The beer selection is always varied, exciting, and new, and the food menu is reliably curated. The CB&J is fried to a different degree every time I order it, but that's actually fine since it's literally impossible to ruin cashew butter, fig jam, and brie.

2015-08-29,5.0,"Y'all, Hopleaf is truly one of my absolute favorite places in the entire country. I sincerely mean that without any sense of hyperbole or white girl hysterics. TLDR:  Lovely Belgian-ish and non-Belgian gastropub.  Beer. Order mussels, pomme frites, or my favorite, the duck reuben. More beer. And now, long pros/cons... PROS: ----Beer list is crazy.  Sheer quantity combined with expertly curated selection. 70ish constantly rotating taps, a bazillion bottles (though I've never ordered a bottle). The tap list has at least 1 entire page of just Belgians, and 2+ pages of other beers. Most importantly, even more impressive than the sheer number of beers is the wide variety of selection. Lots of local beers, lots of non-local beers, many standard favorites kept constantly on the menu (Zombie Dust, Left Hand Milk Stout, Bell's Two-Hearted, etc are almost always on tap), lots of different style varieties, always several unique and rare beers, and the list goes on. I can't imagine any enjoyer of beer could possibly come here and not find something they are interested in. Even beer newbies won't be too overwhelmed as they describe each beer in words on the menu. ----Don't want beer?  At least 5-ish ciders are always on tap too, as are a good handful of wines (yes, wines on tap). Liquor is available. ----Great food! Seriously, this place would be legendary on its beer merits alone, but they also have great food. I recommend the duck reuben or mussels and frites. I'm surprised my entire body hasn't turned into a duck reuben yet. Some friends like the brisket sandwich but I found it dry. Charcuterie, if that's your thing, is excellent, and has only been slightly surpassed in my experience by The Publican (which is no small compliment to Hopleaf). ----The space itself is cool. It's a huge, winding sort of place with 2 bars, a back patio, an upstairs loft, and lots of brick and wood. Both the front and back bar sections are bar service only, and the seating everywhere else is table service. Walls display steel beer signs from around the world, and lots of neon beer lights (cool ones, not tacky ones) hang in the windows. Douchebag/DudeBro quotient usually pretty low, even when very crowded. I think this is because it's 21+ and because of what food and drink is being served. It's also in Andersonville, one of the north side's best neighborhoods. Lots of funky stores and independent businesses line northward up Clark Street, where Hopleaf sits. CONS: ----Can get crowded on Friday/Saturday nights. Because it's such a sprawling space, during the day it's always super relaxed, weeknights aren't uncomfortably crowded, and I've been here on plenty of weekend evenings that don't get too crazy. But I must be fair and say that on a good number of weekend nights, it can get pretty packed. ----Not the cheapest? This shouldn't even be a point of contention, but I know it matters to some folks. You can get a few of the same beers elsewhere for a dollar or so less, and yes, the food is more expensive than bad pub grub or, even worse, Chili's. But you get what you pay for, and here you pay for selection, quality, and deeply knowledgeable service.

The plate also had deliciously buttered bread, boiled quail eggs, mustard and pickled turnips. Could've eaten this forever had it not been for the amazing codfish spread we also ordered.

She directed us to the bar, where it was extremely cold and we had to order dessert and coffee from the bartender (and ate with our coats on).

I went on a Monday night and there was no wait. I'm told that there's often a long wait but maybe that's just on the weekends. We were seated immediately at an upstairs table overlooking the back patio. This place is really huge inside. I had no idea how big the space was from the outside. It's quite deceptive.  Our waitress was very helpful in deciding what to order. I forget her name but she was awesome! I had the special--fried chicken and waffles with Kwak. I love that they do beer pairings with their food. I love that Kwak was used in the fried chicken. It was a great combination and it should be on the regular menu. My husband had the CB&J and it was decadent. It's a cashew butter and fig jam sandwich grilled with raclette cheese. My visiting mother had the steak with herb butter. That herb butter is like crack.

Sure, this is quite a trek from my place in the 'burbs, but I will not pass up an opportunity to come here. It's about a fifteen-minute walk from the Argyle red line stop. Depending on what time I have gotten off the stop, I have felt varying degrees of safety. Sometimes, it feels totally safe, other times not so much (I'm generally not comfortable being approached by strange people being asked for money, getting hit on, etc). Anyway, Hopleaf has a lot of seating, which is a good thing because this is a popular destination for a lot of people in the area (obviously, as well as people from farther away). I've been here on weeknights and on the weekend. I've never had to wait to be seated, which is incredible. On weekends, however, I would recommend trying to get there for an earlier dinner (latest 6 PM) or a later dinner (think 7:30 and later) to avoid the peak dinner times.  There's seating at the bar, downstairs, upstairs, and on the patio. I've sat upstairs, downstairs, and on the patio, and all have unique atmospheres that I enjoyed. I have ordered the same dish every time I've been here and I haven't been able to convince myself to order anything else off the menu because I'm so obsessed with the CB&J, which is basically a grilled cheese with cashew butter and fig jam. It is completely OUT OF THIS WORLD! Sometimes, I dream about this meal. Every time I go there, I tell myself, ""Okay, I need to learn how to make this myself"" but I've never been able to recreate it. I don't care if you eat meat. This meal is just fantastic. Oh, and it gets better. The CB&J also comes with amazing macaroni and cheese, plus housemade chips. It's all incredible and very, very filling.

We ordered the small mussels to start which were ok but nothing more than that. At least it comes with fries to make it somewhat worth it. There wasnt much flavor to the mussels and broth. We both ordered a brisket sandwich which was a joke. It came on untoasted, dry bread no larger than a 5x5 slice of bread. Meat, mustard, bread. Nothing more. The mountain of fries on my plate made me chuckle. It was literally 3 helpings worth, which made my joke of a sandwich appear even smaller.

They also have what might be the best beer selection in the city (though it's disappointing they removed Delirium Tremens from the draft list). The outdoor patio is great when the weather allows but the atmosphere inside is awesome too.",0.9628,0.752,0.217,0.031,0.6307692307692307

I'd recommend this place more for groups and friend gatherings, as it tends to be rather loud and crowded most nights. It has a very fun atmosphere, delicious food and a wide range of drinks. Oh, and, they have one of the best French wine selections in the city, bringing wine from some rather fancy Châteaus (and affordable, too!).",0.9861,0.696,0.304,0.0,0.5499074074074074

2015-05-17,5.0,"Absolutely my favorite restaurant-bar in Chicago. There are five different seating areas, each with their own vibe letting you pick the one that's best for what you're looking for. When you come in its a pretty normal pub style bar, a little loud maybe, so I have never sat around there. Going through there you arrive at the restaurant, with two-story windows and a fireplace. The food is fantastic, I really recommend the Belgian style mussels (they just introduced a new style but I don't believe it could get any better) and the duck Reuben, which is surprisingly delicate for a Reuben. Only complaint I might have about the food is that its a bit too salty (especially the fries) but when you're a beer or two in you'll appreciate it. Next room (still on the first floor) is more of a hipster bar feel, I believe this is the center focus when they bring in new beer/breweries. Upstairs there's another pub like area but this one is a little quieter than the one by the door. Last up is the second food area, on a balcony above the hipster bar. Its a good space if you have a large party because the first floor food area is usually pretty busy. Short story, its food-beer heaven.",0.9864,0.819,0.169,0.012,0.5168063119676023

Simply put, it's a cool place with great staff, a fantastic beer selection (they have a bunch of Belgian styles) with a ton of places for seating. In fact there are about 5 or 6 different areas for seating and each have a slightly different vibe from one another. We came last night with a big group and sat outside. The weather was perfect for it. I've had some really good and interesting beers in the past. On this most recent visit I got Brasserie Dupont sprl's Avec Le Bon Voeux which I highly recommend. It's worth the aroma alone. I also got Dark Horse's Sapient Trip Ale.Their food can be hit or miss. Some hits are their mussels and their duck rubean and both items are staples on their menu which changes from time to time. Last night I got the Tecumseh Farms Smart Chicken Two Ways. It's an oven-roasted airline breast, crispy confit leg, with ramp chowder purée, glazed baby carrots, hasslebeck potatoes & bacon/freekeh gremolata. I think it was the best of the entrees. The Wood Grilled Duroc Pork Chop sounded good, but it was one of their misses. It was lacking in flavor. Plus, and this may be the first time I every say this, it was cooked too rare. We've never had a bad time here. It's always fun and we ran into some other friends here by chance. It's definitely a local place, but worth the drive if you don't live near by.

The main course our smoked meat sandwiches were not memorable or worth the $13 whatever we paid for them.

I got the brisket sandwich and it was really moist and just fell apart as you ate it The side of beans I got were OK I will say the Mac n' cheese we ordered to share came out cold which was a bit less than desirable but I was there mainly for the beer and hanging out with friends Will definitely return if we ever find ourselves in Chicago again NOTE: they card everyone who enters the beer garden so make sure you don't leave your IDs at home",0.9936,0.795,0.198,0.007,0.5208937198067634

Everything from rare US crafts to Belgium triples and always rotating. (Bonus points for always having Zombie Dust on tap like a boss ) The second reason I go to HL is the food. There is nothing on the menu not worth trying and everything I've ever gotten has been cooked to perfection and tasted as beautiful as it looked. The must try though are the mussels cuz damn son.

It's one of my favorite beers. So good. The bar area is nice enough. Booth seating if you have a bigger party. Bartender was very nice.  The food there was good. I guess they are considered a Gastropub which means that normal food items must sound like they were crafted by a French culinary master and imported overseas. Just overly complicated. I got the... Organic Grass-fed Brisket--$13 on light rye; Montreal-style dry rub, slow-roasted while wrapped in bacon; w/stone-ground mustard, housemade dill pickle; pomme frites It was brisket on Rye sandwich bread and french fries. Pomme frites? FRENCH FRIES. There's really no reason for that. Plus, the french fries were okay. I couldn't discern anything that different between these pomme frites and other french fries I've ever had. Plus, the brisket was too dry for me, didn't taste the bacon infusion and didn't even realize there was mustard in it. Not a bad sandwich but when you make it out to be GRASS FED and Montreal Style dry rubs and all that, I expected it to be better than what it was. Although, not complaining for $13, still not a bad sandwich.  The ambiance in the eating area was nice though but, again, it felt like it tried too hard. Candles were on the table and soft jazz played while we ate. It was a nice atmosphere but there's something just about this gastropub thing I don't really get.

2015-04-01,5.0,"CB&J sandwich for life! Came here for a couple of brews before going to Too Much Light. Loved the selection of brews and how they were broken down into regions. I liked that because it steered me to the appropriate place on the menu. As an out-of-towner, I wanted to get my hands on as many local brews as possible.  After we saw the show, we came back to this place. I spotted the CB&J and had to order it--cashew butter, fig jam, and cheese on pan-fried sourdough. I liken it to a gangatsa'ed up grilled cheese. I really dug this sandwich because that flavor combo would have never made it out of my brain and I now know that I want to replicate this at home.  The sandwich came with a side of Stilton mac and cheese and some house made potato chips. Those were both standard, and I do not mean that in a bad way. Those two side items are not particularly unique (like the sandwich) but were well done and tasty but something you can find in many restaurants.  Efficient and friendly service. The atmosphere is cozy with the use of low lights and little candles. The bathrooms are also poorly-lit, so be prepared for that if you have to make a trip.  Side rant: why does Chicago love ACTUAL flames in their little table candles? Where I am from, everyone has the fake tea lights. I am accident-prone so I was always super nervous that I would be placing a paper menu on a flame and then be the patient zero of the next Chicago fire.

Can I tell you that was perhaps one of the best decisions I made? The Hopleaf is a local Andersonville area favourite and from what I've read the reviews are bang on.  The place is deceivingly big, from what I understand it is a case of success leading to expansion. The entire place reflects the patient and rustic European (Belgian) way of life with a laid back feel like a part of the same village kind of vibe.  Walking in you sense there is a comfort level and a welcoming atmosphere, then walk into the second room in the back filled with old Belgian beer advertisements on brick walls which rise up two floors to a neo-industrial metal ceiling.  The upstairs terrase has piping for rails which work off well with the neo-industrial feel.  Back to the main floor there is a wonderful iron wood burning stove...just like you'd find in an old cabin.  The scent of the burning wood completes the atmosphere the owners have envisioned.  YES.  Take me away from reality and into a quasi-euro escape.  Only if it was sunny and warm enough to sit in the biergarten. The food was authentic, homemade, served in large portions, and made right.  I ordered a Seef Bier to go with my Duck Reuben and pommes frites.  The beer selection is primarily Belgian, and what a selection it is.  There are also beers from around the world that are inspired by Belgian brews, and then other beers. The Duck Rueben was made with Emmental cheese, sauerkraut, and nestled in between two slices of marbled rye bread, then grilled.  It was really a nice change from the usual Rueben.  The pommes frites were made to perfection, just as Le Belge would have made it.  Double deep fried (blanched and then fried again) to give it its crispy exterior and soft and tender inside. Delicious. The service itself was attentive, polite, and laid back...no pretense here.  The servers were dressed as they would themselves....no black t-shirts and black pants.  They don't pretend to be what they aren't and while pretty, the wait staff did not need to wear skimpy outfits.  Their atmosphere, service, and food does all that and more.  No need for cheap gimmicks. In the end, I ordered a coffee because I wanted to stay and linger just a little longer...to enjoy the nice atmosphere before heading back into reality.  The coffee was tantalizing to the nose in its beany brewed goodness and strong sense of a real - good - coffee.   Everything in the world is right again.  The snow has stopped and HOP-fully spring is around the corner so that I can enjoy that biergarten.",0.9938,0.852,0.122,0.026,0.4674836601307189

We started with a round of beer and cider from their massive and well curated beer menu. Against our waitresses recommendation we started with the croquettes which despite their lack of fishiness were crisp and tasty with great pine nut puree below and watercress above. For dinner we had two buckets of mussels which were fresh tasting and the two broth offerings were quite different and great for dipping. Next was duck leg and sausage which definitely highlightred the kitchen's skills. Duck is one of my favorite things and hard to get right. Their leg was crispy without being dry or fatty. The sausage was mild and paired well with the rest of the entree and the beer. Our final entree was the mushroom risotto which had great earthy mushroominess and was complimented by the fresh shaved brussel sprouts.

2015-01-26,4.0,"I'm giving this four stars because my sandwich (catfish hoagie), as well as the sausage appetizer we shared, were absolutely delicious. Unfortunately, the sandwiches that my two friends got (duck reuben and organic grass-fed beef) were much less delicious.  The sausage appetizer was three sausages with a variety of sauces. While they were all good and intensely flavorful, I will say that it was incredibly expensive for the amount of food we got.  The catfish hoagie had a delicious amount of fish, a very flavorful sauce (although possibly a little too much of it) and a fresh piece of bread that was able to stand up to the weight of the filling. Their fries were also delicious - fresh, hot and just the right mix of crunchy and soft fries.  I found the duck reuben and the beef sandwich to be a little underwhelming - the flavors weren't very complex, and the meat itself was incredibly tender, but not particularly flavorful - especially since it was, purportedly, wrapped in bacon.  Overall: I would come back here, but I definitely wouldn't venture away from the catfish hoagie.",0.9581,0.853,0.137,0.01,0.595412087912088
2015-01-26,5.0,Well one magical night I was sitting at home in my bean bag chair listening to the sounds of the ocean sipping on my Shirley temple drink . That woman had some amazing movies. I can even do all the dances. Anyways I thought to my lonely self hmm I need a REAL drink something to TICKLE my Whistle and I went through all the yellow pages and even dabbled on the Internet and thought HMM. WHY not HOPLEAF so I changed my clothes and hopped on my Flintstone's tricycle and pedaled my brains over to HOPLEAF.  I was so Happy FINALLY I have found Glory the watering hole for the STARS. I took off my Smurf gloves and shook the bouncers hand and was happy I did that cause that shows RESPECT. I then went to the bartender and ordered but WHAT else A Shirley Temple. My eyes lit up like a Christmas tree and I nursed the drink for 3 hours while thinking and finished reading my favorite book the CAT AND THE HAT.

Every time I took a sip of my drink, inching further and further towards the end, someone would pop up asking if I was finished and wanted my check. I get that it's the weekend, and therefore is considered a busy day for the establishment, but when someone is constantly asking if I'm finished with my drink, or every five minutes asking if I need my meal (sorry I was catching up with a friend, and trying to catch up. I will finish my food once I am done with this story. I am sorry) boxed up, it sort of sends the message that you want me gone.

I came here on a Friday night around 7 pm with 3 other friends. I got there first to put our name in but there wasn't a wait. They needed my entire party to be there to seat us. Totally fine and understandable. This place gets crazy busy. And it was when I got there but was surprised at how big the inside was! They have 3 different bars I believe. One right when you walk in, another in the back to the left and then another upstairs. We sat directly in the back by the fireplace. Really cute and cozy. My rating is mainly based on the service from our waitress. It took her 20 + minutes to come take our drink order! So we just ordered drinks and food when she came. Ok, fine, it's busy. But she then only came 2 other times; to check on us and give our check. We were there for 2 hours! Unacceptable in my opinion.  The food was also just OK. I got the Duck Reuben. Good, but I definitely wouldn't order it again. And the fries were not that good either. What I loved the most were the mussels. Very tasty and I highly recommend! So, I will probably be back but just for drinks. The ambiance is great and the beer list... Hello?!

The mussles and frites are such a treat, I have tried the different broths and it is impossible to pick a favorite. If you want to be really indugent, try the ""CBJ"" sandwich. Don't question how cashew butter, fig jam and cheese go together...you're wasting time when you could be eating one of the most savory and delightful sandwiches ever...that comes with a side of home made mac & cheese, and home made potato chips...complete genius! If you want a more expensive entree, there are some delcious options even at the bar, so this is an easy place to take friends who all have different tastes and budgets. If you're at the bar (even seated at tables), there isn't a waitress. Go right up, order and start a tab. This makes it REALLY easy to do the separate check thing without akwardness.

So tonight we drank and dined with another couple and we were really excited to be back at the spot where we fell in love. We three seafood eaters ordered the mussels, which were divine...just straight up yummy. My girlfriend ordered the winter kale salad...but she wanted a bit of protein in it so she asked the waitstaff if she could have a poached egg on top. The server was very nice, but informed us, even after double checking with the kitchen, that they were not interested in accommodating special requests. We then asked if they had eggs, to which she replied yes. Are you kidding me!? We were both left dumbfounded. Being in the service industry ourselves, we could not imagine what kind of kitchen/management would uphold this sort of non- customer oriented service ideology. So, point of the story is that my girlfriend left hungry because your snotty kitchen wouldn't poach an egg for her salad....how tragic.

And though I love scallops, the pork chops where calling me... and I LOVED every bite of it! No regret whatsoever.

I really enjoy the fullness and roundness of a good Belgian, and this place has well over a hundred choices on draft and in bottles, some of which approach the cost of a fine wine! Reading the menu can take a while with the descriptions. The atmosphere is young with hip twenty to thirtyish people all dressed of the moment. That would be my only concern, insofar as the clientele is not nearly as varied as the selection of brews. There are two full bars here, where the one in the front is more of a traditional bar and the one on the other side with the floor to ceiling windows looking out on Broadway just south of Foster. I'm sad to report that because of local liquor laws, you cannot enter the bar even to eat unless you are 21 years old.

If you have not been here or are visiting and craft beer is your thing, you have to go here. While brew pubs and microbreweries with restaurants are all the rage these days, Hopleaf has 20 years on them. This is THE place these breweries want all their new beer sold. What that means is you'll find the best beers from any and all breweries who sell in Chicago on tap at Hopleaf. Owner Michael Roper is as respected as anyone in the craft beer industry and he chooses only the most remarkable, intriguing beers from the most impressive, reliable and exciting breweries around the world. Even the most seasoned of craft beer drinkers will find something new every time they go to Hopleaf. It's the reason I never hesitate to venture back. On top of that, Hopleaf has managed to craft a menu that holds its own in Chicago's new American bar food scene. If you are a foodie who enjoys good beer, you're not sacrificing having a great meal in favor of beer selection. If you are into mussels, that's their big thing, but all their meat options are pretty excellent, especially the duck reuben, which is in its own league. And the frites! Addictive. The space is pretty labyrinthine because they bought and expanded into the property next door, but they have everything from party rooms to a back patio to a more contemporary open window dining room. Or you can sit in the original bar space, which maintains a close-knit dive feel. The wait staff has always been friendly and the bartenders knowledgeable. You can always taste any of the drafts. Also, it can get very crowded at peak times, so be mindful of that.

You have tons of drinks options and you can go full dinner or just have nice little snacks. The frites are amazing. On my most recent first date here I tried the mussels for the first time and I regretted all the previous times I missed out on these. They're delicious and they come with frites! Two options available. I had the Belgian mussels.  I like the cashew butter and jelly sandwich. The duck sandwich is also great.  They have plenty of sides which stand alone like the Mac and cheese which I think uses Stilton.  The beer list here is outstanding. I'm not into beer but I do like cider and they have plenty of it!

Around 1pm, the patio was about half filled and the inside was less than 1/4 full. We shared the CB&J and the Duck Reuben. Both were great and I'd gladly eat either of them again, but the CB&J was our favorite. The CB&J is like a sophisticated hybrid of a grilled cheese plus a peanut butter and jelly. It's comprised of sourdough, homemade cashew butter, fig jam, and raclette cheese and is served with stilton mac & cheese (fantastic!) and homemade chips. The Duck Reuben is made with marbled rye, roasted duck breast, cranberry cream cheese, and emmenthal cheese and is served with frites and aioli. In case size matters to you, these fries are similar in width to those at McDonald's. Even though I typically prefer my fries thicker, I kept eating more and more so that I would have something to dip in the lush aioli. Yum.

No problem, it happens, and the server recommended a similar beer from The Bruery which I knew to be excellent. However, when I explained that I came from California and would like to try something more local, he seemed inexplicably offended. Ok, not a big deal...some people take their craft beer seriously. The beer I ended up with was decent, and the Urthel quad I selected afterwards from the bottle list was excellent. The food was also superb, and the portions generous; we split the Peking duck Reuben and the brisket, with a side of Mac n cheese. While we were eating, we noticed that the couple next to us had been trying to get their check for awhile, but the server was nowhere to be found. Glad we weren't in a hurry too.

He tracked down our server, who finally appeared from the back (not carrying food, drink, or a check or anyone else either), then brought us the check.

2014-07-01,1.0,"First off, I would like to say that my review is for the food. The beer selection at this restaurant is great; though that being said, you can get that great selection a ton of places now, and for a better price. My wife and I went here yesterday for our 2 year anniversary. It started off wonderful with some excellent drink, and an amazing appetizer. I was told about the special, a Walleye with an amazing sounding salad and I decided to go for it.  When the food came it was so incredibly salty I couldn't eat it. Now, I will admit that I am sensitive to salt, so I had my wife try it, and she agreed with me. My plan was to send it back and get something else, but it took the waitress over 7 minutes to get back to our table. In that time the people sitting next to us sent a dessert back because it was too salty (a dessert!). By the time she got back my wife's food was gone, otherwise it would have been cold. Then it took an additional 5 minutes or so for my wife's wine to show up that she had ordered when our food was delivered. At this point we were hoping it wouldn't come because I just wanted to leave so that I could go eat some real food.  Eventually it did come, and we drank it and tried to get out of there, but we had to track down our waitress again because she was avoiding us (or so it seemed). When it comes down to it, I guess I should not expect great food from this place. The beer is what I should have come for. But, that being said what sort of put a damper on my evening wasn't necessarily the bad food, but the way that it was handled. I get it that it sucks that two tables next to each other had the same problem, but that doesn't mean you can avoid the situation. You can be polite, energetic, and apologize.  Overall this was a very disappointing experience, and I am very frustrated as I often recommend this place to friends, and have even brought friends from out of the country to here as an excellent example of how Chicago does beer and appetizers (at least).",0.984,0.807,0.137,0.056,0.5104913632119514

I asked for something else and the bartender came back twice to tell me I should never order pork belly again because that was a perfect piece. The other bartender then told the people next to us the pork belly was brand new on the menu that night... So they should have accepted the constructive criticism on a new item instead of making me feel terrible for saying something.

Summer sausage was standard and not anything special, the duck liver mousse was melt in your mouth excellent and served with toasted bread. I ordered the steak frites for my main dish and the bf ordered the mussels with chorizo. The mussels were tough and overly salty. The only flavor was in the chorizo and that wasn't even very good, just hot. The mussels were also gritty like they weren't washed properly.  I ordered my steak medium and it came out way over cooked and cold. My frites were also cold as well. Our food was dropped off and no one came to check on us for at least 25 minutes. Our water and beers stayed empty.  When our server finally came back I told her my food was cold and over done and she didn't apologize at all and said she would bring me a new order.

Beer Choice for the man: Goose Island Bourbon Country Vanilla Stout---- FROM 2010!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Appetizer: Charcuterie Trio: Rabbit Liver Mousse, Country Duck Pate & Pork Rilette. Entrees: Organic Montreal-Style Brisket Sandwich (hubby) & Duck Reuben Sandwich (Wifey) both served with their signature frites & aioli.  Dessert: Lavender Buttermilk Panna Cotta with Pistachios, Blackberries, Lemon Curd & Graham Cracker.  Dinner started off lovely, we were offered a seat @ the ""kitchen bar"" with no wait time- pretty awesome for 8pm on a Saturday night. Having worked in a restaurant before (wifey) it was pretty awesome to be that close to the guys ""on the line"" making the food we were going to be eating shortly. Hubby went straight to the beer list and hugged me immediately due to his over excitement from the awesome selection of beers on draft. He was also drawn to the ""Off Menu"" Beer in the pad-locked beer cooler near our table. We ordered our 1st round of beer, Zombie Dust for me & thankfully hubby asked if they had anything off menu, our server Dan recommended the Bourbon Country Vanilla Stout, which happens to be hubby's FAVOURITE. Upon discovering it was from 2010 (the only year this variety was made) there was only one option- to order it :)  The appetizer selections were great, we were really happy with the country pate & pork rilette; however, the mousse selection our server recommended (because it was on special) was sub-par. It had a weird goatcheesey texture and was our least favorite. It would have been nice if we had some extra crustini pieces for our plate but we survived.  We were really excited about brisket & duck; however, both were somewhat disappointing. The Duck Reuben had very little actual duck, sauerkraut or any of the other items supposedly on the sandwich. It did have an abundance of gruyere which i was happy with but that was about it. Maybe the brisket wasn't supposed to come with any sauce, lord knows it didn't have any. The bread was plain and it was smothered in whole grain mustard (NOT LISTED ON THE MENU) hubby was upset to say the least. Both of our sandwiches came with their signature frites- as a potato connoisseur i wouldn't rank these high on my personal list. They were overly salted-over-ly-salt-ed.... SALTEDDDDDDD!! Hubby felt as though his tongue was ""assaulted"" har har- do you get it?  Anywho- the Goose Island Ogden I (wifey) had with my entree was the saving grace- it was the first time I've had this type of beer and it was really yummy. I will definitely be ordering it again :)  The unlikely hero of this meal (outside of the beer of course) was actually dessert. The lavender really came through the taste of the panna cotta which just melted in your mouth. The pistachios, blackberries, lemon curd & graham cracker melded perfectly with this dish, needless to say- we almost licked the plate! Hubby (the beer connoisseur) said this paired perfectly with the Bourbon County Vanilla Stout :)  Overall a good experience, we'll be back. The atmosphere is fun, loud but not obnoxiously so. Next time we might explore the entree menu, mussels, prawns & more pate, will definitely steer clear of the sandwiches, and will absolutely do our best to save room for dessert :)",0.9988,0.794,0.185,0.021,0.5880093676814987

The cheese and sauerkraut completely dominated the duck, forcing it to be a textural element at best. In the end, it tasted like a simple cheese and sauerkraut sandwich.

The front room is the old bar I guess as it feels like an old bar with many times painted over tin ceiling (now green) and big, solid wood bar with booths on one side and beams in the middle of the room - it all gives the place a very old school feel. Three more rooms which we peeked at since we ate in front by the windows, looked even nicer - with completely different feels as others have mentioned.The back room has large windows that look out to a patio/ deck area that looks like it will be inviting in the summer.  A long thin room to the south, accessed behind the bar, from the back room, looked much more like a new wave Chicago restaurant with the open kitchen along one wall and tables both in the front and along the open kitchen. A mezzanine upstairs was large and open as well. The food was outstanding and reason alone to return. The duck Reuben was terrific and even better than the very good corned beef on rye. Once again we had amazing thin, crisp and liberally salted French fries that were addictive. Zombie Killer Cherry Ceyser (no typo) on tap was a cool, slightly sweet and crisp alternative to beer served in a nice goblet.

My friend ordered the rib eye and again, much too salty- almost inedible. Again, there was no server to help us or check up on us. We had to go out of our way to ask for more water. I had the vegetable wellington which was good. The barley that came with it was too chewy and not as creamy as I had expected. It was a very disappointing experience and has left a bit of a bitter taste. Not sure if I will rave about this place as much or go as often-unless it's just for the mussels.

If you've read my other posts you know I don't drink beer, so it is assuredly a suicide mission to go to a beer place and be happy. But beer places usually have a selection of ciders too. Hopleaf has two, one in my price range which wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. What was great was the cabbage salad and the service. Our server was attentive and gave us space all at the same time. Our plates were clear as soon as we were done and they always checked the bottle before they took it (which is a bad experience if you've ever had it).

Being a total beer lover, a visit to Chicago required a stop at this famous venue that offers a large variety of over sixty beers on tap and dozens more in bottles.  If you can't find something you like, it's your fault.  I was impressed that one of my guests was unacustomed to craft beers was helped by our server and finding a beer she likes.  Too often at places like this when they get a n00b, the staff roll their eyes and say ""it's all good"".  The server made our job much easier.  The variety here was stupendous crossing all genres of style and region served in proper glassware with detailed explanations (I almost didn't have to check my beer ratings guide, but why stop old habits) Although beer is often a meal, for some strange reason man cannot live soley on beer alone.  Darn nutritional requirements!  The signature appetizer here are the mussels but we opted for the onion rings which really are more like onion straws.  It's mostly a mound of thin sliced onions dunked into a fryer with some breading.  No complaints here as it was tasty and a bargain at $3.00 for the portion we got.  Beer and grease go well together. For the main course, despite the meaty options, my dining companions got the vegetarian option instead.  I allowed this :-)  Everyone at the table got the exact same thing because it was so darn irresistable--the CB&J.  Chunky cashew butter, along with fig jam and creamy cheese.  It sounds like peanut butter and jelly by definition but it tastes more like grown-up grilled cheese as the ingredients all melt together as the bread crisps in a pan.  It's absolutely delicious but comes along with a ramekin of stilton grilled cheese and fresh made pub chips.  I really hate to see what my arteries  looked liked after this: proving the point that vegetarian food can be both tasty and not terribly healthy at the same time.  This dish was absolutely amazing but next time I'm going to opt for the grilled mushroom platter.   The atmosphere here is a pub so it can be noisy as well as very busy at times, so this isn't the place for a quiet and relaxing meal and service can be a bit slow as the crowds ebb and flow but I was always asked if I wanted another beer after my glass emptied (yes please!)

A cauliflower salad was inventive, flavorful and well-balanced. Ditto a duck confit crepe -- rich and delicious. The sausage plate featured a couple of good sausage (1 chicken?, 1 beef?), but the accompanying beans were way undercooked. Potato & gruyere croquettes were above reproach. For dessert, a red current semifreddo was nicely conceived & executed, bright yet luscious. Beans excepted, a tasty little feast, indeed. Our server was helpful and efficient, and the main dining room was quite cozy as a result of a roaring blaze in the woodstove (a bit too roaring, actually -- my sense is that the fire tender had not been well-instructed). I would have gladly given four stars rather than three, but for one major flaw: the lighting was way too dim; when each dish arrived, I had to check it out with a flashlight to determine what it was and how to best attack it.

We heard they had Angels Share on tap, so it was worth the cab ride to get there, and get home safely. The Angels Share (Brandy barrel) was fantastic, and not overly priced. It was a small sized glass, 6 oz. for four dollars. I wont argue with that. They had some really nice sours on tap, and some other greats in the bottle. Not an overwhelming huge selection of tap beers (quite a few), or bottle beers, but concise and quality. Some real thought went into what to carry and what not to carry. We sat in the loft style upstairs, over looking the dining room below us. Busy, busy place. We were seated right away, and was happy to be upstairs rather than down. We had a nice lil corner table, out of the way, where we could discuss our beer and food, and not feel like we were in the way.  We had the charcuterie sampler, and it was fanstic.

The beer menu at Hopleaf is the most overwhelming one yet.  There are lots of really great choices.  Although I did make my decision somewhat quickly, I didn't want to miss any of the other options and read the menu thoroughly at least twice! There is more seating than you would assume upon walking in.  If you walk down the narrow hallway there is a pretty dining area that reminded me of a shabby chic log cabin.  We grabbed a booth up front, which has more of a ""bar"" feel to it.  You do have to order at the bar, there is no table service, so placing an order can be a bit hectic.  However, the bartenders are friendly and relaxed here.

I have to mark it down one for the service... not sure why but a lot of the servers in the Hopleaf seem to have an attitude problem.  There was a time when I asked for an extra fork for our mussels.. I hadn't seen that there was one under a napkin and the guy got all snotty with me and said 'what's wrong with that one' - fair enough it was a mistake on my part but still.. lighten up!  Also my parents were visiting from overseas, we'd been going on about how fab the mussels are at the Hopleaf and we lived super close at the time, we ordered drinks and two orders of the mussels to share. 45 mins later we checked on our food and they had forgotten to put the order in by that point the kitchen was closed.

Knowing that they are known for their beer list, I purposely held off going here until after I'd given birth and was back on the beer wagon. As you can see, this entire mentality left a lot to the small chance that I wasn't over hyping and over expecting something from here. I didn't. Hooray! It lived up to every ounce of excitement I had going in. The bar is quaint and cute. The bartenders were super easy to talk to and I almost would have hung at the bar versus sitting at the table with my group. The beer list is phenomenal and the prices aren't too shabby either.  We were sat after a very short wait at a table for 8 in the back. I just loved the vibe of the whole place. I ordered the mussels and sadly our server forgot to bring them out and by the time she came to the table to check on our meals, we had all decided to forgo the forgotten mussels altogether (my only complaint). My duck reuben and frites were outstanding and alas, I still had room for mussels so that became dessert and I am very glad they did. Not everyone at the table was into them, but I blame that more on their lame palettes and not the tasty dish. I requested the onion strings along with them since I'd already had the frites and that's the way to do it. They were crispy and flavorful, but delicate and not overly greasy. If I lived closer and didn't have kids, I'd be here constantly. Since I do have kids and limited opportunity to get out, I look forward to the next time I can return.

I was told about the extensive beer selection and they weren't kidding. My favorite part was how their menu gives a brief description of each beer so you know what you're getting yourself into. Prices were reasonable for craft beer I thought..everything I tried was delicious and served quickly despite the crowd. My second visit to Hopleaf was for dinner (and more beer of course). I was happy to see that their beer menu had changed with many fall beers added which was just what I was in the mood for. I tried 3 different pumpkin beers! All on tap! Yes. For dinner we had the wood grilled octopus appetizer and mussels for two. YUM. I had never had mussels before and they were delicious; especially the broth you can sop up with freshly baked bread.

After getting in and greeting my friends, I marched right up to the bar to order my brew. Sadly, their website is a liarface and no 5 Rabbit was anywhere to be seen. Sigh. Thankfully, they had many other beers on tap including a ton I have never tried before.  I settled on an Oatmeal Stout after seeing a few people the past week have it on Untappd, followed that with a personal favorite Golden Monkey and rounded out things with Two Hearted & Gulden Draak.

The last few times I have been to Hop Leaf, it has gotten progressively worse. I felt like I was eating bread soaked in flavorless oil. A friend of mine had never been, and I highly recommended it. I was embarrassed when she barely touched it.  At the end of our meal neither of us ate even half of our sandwich and the waitress never came to check on us.  After the table was bussed we mentioned that we were dissapoined with the sandwiches and she told us we should have told her sooner. (We would have if she would have stopped long enough to look us in the eye and ask what we thought.) In the end she did offer to take them off of the bill.  We love the beer selection and used to be HUGE fans of the food. Now it seems less special and I probably won't recommend it for food in the future.  Thank you to the waitress for comping the food.

2013-09-01,5.0,"I've been coming to Hopleaf for about 6 years now and there's a good reason why I keep coming back - the beer selection is consistently excellent and the food is usually great. Here are some of my thoughts, first regarding the food: Fries - still the best I can find in Chicago. Very thin, very tasty, and the side of mayo complements the fries nicely. They're very salty though, so stay away if that's not your thing. It's a big serving, so keep that in mind, especially if you order a plate that comes with even more fries. It's easy to be overwhelmed by the fries if you're not careful ordering. Baby Octopus - a newer offering. Delicious. The lemon/chorizo aioli goes a long way. Accompanying fava beans are also great. A huge appetizer - sometimes I order this as my meal. Belgian-Style Mussels - a Hopleaf mainstay. Also delicious, and the mussel broth is excellent for absorbing into bread and even the accompanying fries. Brisket Sandwich - I don't know what happened here. I used to order it all the time because the brisket was fall-apart-brisket that had nice char on the sides and was deliciously fatty. Now it's dry and uninteresting. I don't order it anymore. CB&J - cashew butter, fig jam, and raclette cheese. It's like a grilled cheese sandwich with other tasty toppings added. It is delicious and I order it about half the time. However, I always find the side of stilton macaroni to be surprisingly bland, considering stilton is such a sharp cheese. Toasted Ham Sandwich - ham with gruyere on pumpernickel. Surprisingly good, but very heavy. I usually love it, but it has been slightly less delicious as of late (the ham in particular - might be because of their move from Nueske to house-cured). Comes with a side of fries that is about the size of a cat. Beer - always excellent with a good assortment of Belgians and American micro beers. I tend to like the stronger beers that come in half pints or snifters and Hopleaf never disappoints.  Service - good and straightforward, though some newcomers might be put off by the slight cantankerousness of some of the bartenders. Don't order Miller or Vodka-Red-Bull (they don't have either), which I've witnessed a couple of times - you'll likely be scowled at (kind of funny from my point of view). They are fairly helpful if you have a question. Ambiance - it can get a little crowded, but it's a great place to take a date (in my opinion) and have good conversation. No annoying televisions. Good background jazz music, good layout, good tables as long as you can get one. I will happily continue being a regular at this place. I only have minor gripes, and this is more of a 4.5 star review, which I will round up to a 5.",0.9982,0.781,0.204,0.015,0.6242368742368744

2013-08-25,5.0,"We went there in the summer and sat on the patio in back. The first thing that caught my attention was all the different kinds of beer. If you're not a fan of beer and wanted to try something different, check out the Zombie Killer. My sister got that and it had a cherry taste to it. I know that doesn't sound good but it really was. They have a 4 page menu of just beers with their description, and that was just what they had on tap. They had a bunch more in bottles. My lunch consisted of the Toasted Ham and Cheese sandwich. When the waiter brought it out, the cole slaw was actually on the sandwich. I didn't realize that and told the waiter I couldn't eat cabbage so he took it back and brought me another one about five minutes later. That was probably the best ham and cheese sandwich I have ever had. I felt bad about asking them to get me another sandwich but they were extremely nice about it and made me feel that my satisfaction was most important. The Belgium style mussels were incredible. If you get them, make sure you dip the bread in the broth at the bottom of the pot. Everyone in my party was in complete agreement that this was a great taste. The frites (french fries) and aioli (a mayonnaise dip for the fries) was terrific! I'm not a big french fries guy but I ate a lot of these things.

2013-08-10,3.0,"So I have a love-hate relationship with Hopleaf. Let's start with the love: Beer. They have a wonderful selection, with many variations on tap or in bottle. I've been introduced to many a delicious selection. So if you're a beer person, this is a great spot for you.  Service: Again, great. We've had great waiters every time who are knowledgeable and prompt.  Now onto the less good: The food. Dry pork chop, gristly steak (though the frites are good), and drowned salads. My biggest complaint is that everything is extremely salty. Now in a gastro pub, you might think that an advantage to balance out your beer, right? I can assure you, they take the idea of french pub food and overdo it on the sauces and salt. One exception where I actually DO love the dish is their onion rings. Salty, crispy and thin, these are a real treat. Still, every other dish I've tried (and I've tried a lot) has been one step too over or underdone, be it in flavor, texture, or even portion. The mustard on the brisket sandwich overpowers the tasty brisket. The dressing on the tuna tartare salad kills the tuna. The gristle on the steak frites was an example of a horrible cut of meat. All in all, this place is fine for a beer with friends, but I wouldn't recommend  dinner.",0.9019,0.828,0.118,0.054,0.5729296066252587

2013-08-03,1.0,"This review will be split into two parts. One part will be on the food and one part will be on the service. First off the food there is really good. I had the pork chop special. It was cooked and seared to perfection. The meat was tender and the sides went very well with the cut of meat. This place also has a wide assortment of beers from all around the world to right in the back yard of Chicago. Great variety and a monstrous selection. I went with friends and they all enjoyed what they ordered. Secondly is service. Let me start out by stating my philosophy on tipping. Tipping is not something that is deserved. It is a direct reflection of the service received. Now granted it doesn't take much to make me happy, refill my drink, have a good attitude and just be nice. Fulfill that and I will be more than willing to tip very generously even more than say twenty percent. Well there was an air of pretentiousness to the entire situation that I felt slighted. I knew going into the situation that is was not going to be the run of the mill prices and we were OK with that. I thought maybe it was just a misunderstanding, but once the end of the meal rolled around we all shared the same feeling of our waitress being slightly pretentious and very short while also trying to push us out. Overall we unanimously said the service was very sub par for the amount of money we spent. So when we came to a consensus that we should leave a small tip it only made sense. So you may think that would be the end of the story but that wouldn't quantity 1 star would it? I always read 1 star reviews and think that doesn't constitute a review like that. One star reviews hurt the business but as you will read I really feel this is necessary. This sequence of events happens as we get up from the table. My friends are a couple of steps ahead of me at this point. Our waitress goes straight to our check book and opens it up. I haven't made it more than five steps to the door before she chases me down and decides to start a confrontation. It starts out with her saying my friend is dumb. He can't possibly realize that he is tipping on the whole thing. Of course he doesn't understand that he is tipping on the whole bill. She then proceeds to ask me why she deserved such a small tip, the entire time she was becoming visibly more and more frustrated. As I was about to take my wallet out and give her more (not because she was a good server but because I wanted to get out of this extreme awkward situation) she says ""fine just fuck off"". Now I have worked in the customer service realm and to me this was just unheard of. It doesn't matter what the customer did, I would have never have confronted them and for no reason at all would I have sworn at them. She storms off towards the back and I make my way out the front door where my friends are waiting for me. She then comes running out the door to confront everyone. She starts yelling at us and we give her some reasons why she received such a low tip.She was having none of that and our criticism went on deaf ears. Overall I'm sure that this place probably has great servers and with the food it would have been a great dining experience but after what our server did I had to come here and write a review.",0.9689,0.829,0.106,0.066,0.5040216201423099

I dined this time on a double date. We waited no more than 5 minutes & were seated outside. I love the different ivy growing along the bordering buildings & the tall sunflowers enveloping a patio underneath a huge green patio umbrella. A lot of green and natural ambience. The evening was a bit chilly, but I didn't mind because the food, drinks & atmosphere was great.  We ordered the sausage platter to begin. Three small pieces of different sausages with onions. To drink, I had a Rosa Hibiscus draft because they were out of Huitzi from 5 Rabbit Brewery (one of my favorites, and a Chicago based brewery.) Also sampled the Meantime Scotch Ale, Mort Subite, and Zombie Killer (awesome mead, gluten free brew.) Nice selection of beer & as my first review states, I had read about Hopleaf on some published best beer bar list.  For the main course, I tried my date's steak with frites, a guilty pleasure. I was a bit hooked on the frites after dipping them in lemon horseradish, aioli, & herb butter. Steak was cooked medium, and although I normally like it medium rare, it was tender & delicious. I ordered the veggie dish, which was on the scamp side, but very flavorful & interesting. Tomato gnocchi, eggplant, and I can't remember the marmalade-like substance I dipped everything in. Scrambled together, it pleased my taste buds. Although I'd say these dishes aren't very plentiful, they are packed with quality ingredients & amazing flavors. A bit on the pricey side, but you're paying for presentation & something a bit different. We shared the flourless chocolate cake at the end, and it seriously melted in my mouth. So light, but so chocolatey. I was bummed when it was placed on the table, because the piece of cake was small, but it was just enough for four of us to have a few bites & really enjoy a little treat. I actually wish more restaurants lived by the smaller portion size, healthier options philosophy. I realized how many places give you plentiful amounts of food, but are probably packed with processed, unhealthy junk. This food seemed at least somewhat healthier & like I said, more qualitative.  Great experience overall. I really want to return & sit inside next time, in the evening, over a few brews. Don't be afraid to ask for suggestions; I always do & usually ask for beer samples (a good bartender will be glad to let you try em.)

To say the least, I was miserable. And unfortunately that tainted my experience. Big beer selection - something for everyone. I had the CB&J that comes with chips and macaroni and cheese. It was way too hot to be eating something like that. I felt ill afterward. The sandwich was pretty good, but I feel like it's paired poorly with the macaroni. It's too rich - you need something green or acidic to cut through it all. And the mac-n-cheese was only OK - nothing to write home about.  Hubs had the reuben, which he said was good, but the duck reuben at Goose Island is a tough one to live up to. The fries and aioli are amazeballs. We should've had some for an app. For dessert we had the olive oil cake, which was actually pretty bad. It had a pistacchio ice cream that literally melted before our eyes, so I'm not sure how good it was. We should've passed on the whole thing. I'd be willing to come back here to try again.

I had mine however my friend did not, mind you everyone in the group was clearly in their late 20's-30's. My friend tried to explain that she wasn't going to be drinking, (she is very pregnant!) and just wanted to eat and have a water. Keep in mind the table we would be sitting at was directly NEXT to the hostess station so they could ""patrol"" my friend if the staff truly felt the need.  The response she received was absolutely unnecessary, extremely rude, and condescending. Their exact words were, ""We are a bar fist, and we can't have you here."" My friend and I simply turned around and walked up the street where we were graciously welcomed to another BAR might I add, where my pregnant friend was WELCOMED with a water in this sweltering heat.

For a self proclaimed beer snob, it was definitely up there in my list of happy places.  I always try to start off with a local beer and the Two Brothers Revolution did not disappoint.  One of my girlfriends stuck with the tripels which were all tasty, strong, bit sweet but that's expected.  The Kwak came in such a cool contraption that it's worth ordering just to drink out of it.  The BF had a memorable oatmeal stout that punched you with flavors of cocoa and coffee.   As for the food, I had the CB&J since it was highly recommended by yelpers.  Although wary at first, it was quite good.  Bread was a little bit too toasted because it hurt the roof of my mouth whenever I took a bite, but the cashew butter was delicious.  Mac n cheese was ok, not the best I've had but it's a good small size for a tasting of it.  I swapped out the potato chips for a side salad like recommended by someone which was a good idea to cut the heavy mac n cheese.  We all shared the mussels in beer.  The broth was tasty, mussels I had were kind of anorexic, and the fries were on the soggy side.  Tried some of the ham sandwich on pumperknickel and I thought the bread complemented the ham very well.  It was too salty for me but my friends enjoyed it a lot.  A TON of fries come out with it if you care about that.  Took a bit of the grass fed steak which was fine but I did feel like I could have that at home.  Not bad, just not special.   Recommend it for dinner with a group of friends, very highly recommend it for beers with friends.",0.9962,0.711,0.226,0.063,0.5679656084656085

2013-07-12,2.0,"This is really hard to do because I live near Aville and have always loved meeting up with my friends at Hopleaf for a drink. But for those looking to come for your first time, please know that A LOT has changed since we first started going here in 2008 and not a lot for the better. Yes, the expansion definitely alleviated the crowding. That is a big plus for locals who just want a place to grab a drink.  The bad news, the kitchen has gone way down hill in my opinion. Every time we go there is something wrong with our food order - whether we order in the restaurant portion or the bar. I used to LOVE the brisket but the new way of doing things (more like a lunch meat than a hearty, homemade brisket slice) is not great. The service has steadily gone down in general. Not as many smiling faces as their used to be. Earlier this week we stopped by for a beer and some fries. The fries have changed. Granted the fries were growing gradually more salty to begin with so maybe they just needed to make them bigger to balance out the crazy amount of salt on them, but this is just not my style. A lot of stuff is coming out burnt or just sloppy, not paying attention to the requests on the tickets. It's too pricey of a place to eat to shrug off  something not being the way we want it so I will have to find a new place to grab a few beers and a good gourmet bite with my pals. Right now Fountainhead is trending but maybe we will try Jerry's down the street too, they have a lot of taps.

That sandwich is no more. Instead, they deli-cut the brisket, and it ends up tasting like corned beef from Jewel's deli counter.  My friend had the duck reuben. It was greasy, the bread was, um, blackened, and the sandwich in general was flavorless (aside from the grease, that is).  The service was serviceable and the fries were fantastic.

Each bite, I was able to get the full flavors of each ingredient and I loved it! The best part though, was the dip that came with the fries. It was served with a garlic aioli and I could probably put that sauce on anything and it would have been amazing! While the food was great, the service was kind of iffy because they wouldn't let us go to the actual restaurant portion.

On a Tuesday night at 7:15ish, I got carded at the door and went to the bar to wait for my friend to show up.  I know the beer list is extremely extensive, and I wasn't in the mood to make a decision, so I asked for the bartender's recommendation around IPAs.  He poured me a Zombie Dust, which of course, was on point.  My date arrives, and we are seated immediately, but the only options are by the kitchen at the bar or a small table across from the kitchen.  I thought it would be extremely loud, but it wasn't.  The service was consistent throughout our whole meal, never was I in need of something. The first time I was here, I shared the mussels for two with a friend.  Not wanting to mess with perfection, I ordered the same thing--mussels for one in curry sauce.  They were just as amazing as the first time I had them.  My favorite place for mussels used to be Lauriol Plaza in DC, but now it's Hopleaf---and thank goodness because it was getting expensive having to go to DC every time I wanted some good mussels!  The curry sauce has amazing flavor, and I love the large bits of lemongrass.  They serve the mussels with a giant portion of frites & aioli, which is spot on, and two rolls.  If you ask, they will bring you out more rolls.  I mean, one of the best parts is soaking the bread in the delicious sauce.

That didn't happen, but I've had lots of good times here regardless.  The mussels are tops.  Another time, I went for their fig & cashew & cheese sandwich, that was excellent.  I went here after a disappointing job interview and it was thick pre-Thanksgiving traffic, so I thought I would loaf around there...I ended up chatting with these Lithuanian gentlemen who told me the plot of the movie Pay it Forward.

Throughout the meal we had to get her attention to get more beer or ketchup, because she didn't have much of an interest in checking on us.  The food itself was nothing remarkable. The french fries literally made up 60% of the meal. On paper the brisket and duck reuben sandwiches are creative and very appetizing. Sitting on the plate and tasting them is another story. The bread for both sandwiches is way too thin to support  the meat and condiments. The cranberry cream cheese spread on the reuben caused the bread to become soggy and fall apart. The brisket looked and tasted more like corned beef, and the rye bread tasted like something on sale at Jewel.

What I didn't love coming into this place was a guy checking id's, like that was his only job. I mean I understand it's a bar establishment, but it's also a restaurant and people chose to order drinks at their table, the servers and bartenders should really be checking them. Oh well, I won't overly fuss about that topic. While we were waiting for our friends to join us, we got some drinks at the bar. I asked for a blue moon but better recommendation and I got the Mort Subite from Brussels which was mildly tart, refreshing and fruity without fruit. That beer alone was able to hit me hard, but it was very tasty and pricier than most of their beers here for $8.00. My hubby got some blondie ale beer, not sure which one, but that one was just okay. But there overall selection is huge, get the one I got and you won't be disappointed but there's definitely lots to choose from if you are picky. Now onto the food, I saw that they had the quail as an appetizer on their online menu so I was really excited to try it. Kinda a fail since they didn't have it in the restaurant, well you probably should update your menu then.  We shared the duck reuben sandwich on toasted marble rye bread with their homemade sauerkraut and cranberry cream cheese. It was okay, nothing to rave about, looked better than it tasted type of thing, but a huge portion served with yummy pommes frites. Now the reason why you should come to Hopleaf bar and the only reason I bumped this establishment up from 3 to 4 stars is: the MUSSELS! Wow, I've had mussels in many places in Chicago, all over the US and even Brussels, and these were just fantastic, literally some of the best I've had, plump and for a single portion for $13 it's literally enough for two, but you should really enjoy and get the portion for 2 for $22. Plus, you get a huge helping of fries with it with a garlic mayo making it super yummy. Definitely a place to come to on a chilly night for Beer, mussels and fries. The service was okay as well, no real complaints there. Dessert menu didn't impress me and we were full from all those mussels so we skipped it this time.

After being somewhat rudely ID checked at the door, we went straight back to the dinning area.  It was a beautiful Chicago day and the patio was full.  If we asked for the patio why would you put us in a corner stuck away from everything and everyone. hmmm  Things started looking up again when our waitress brought out the beer to him and a mead for me.  We ordered the mussels (amazing).  We tried both styles. They are a huge portion and enough for a meal. We never saw our waitress again till she wanted her tip.  By that time, I didn't want to leave her anything.  The table next to us sat a single patron who had been asked several times how his food was and who was tended to well.  Two steps to the right, where we sat was ignored.  To sum it up the food was great, beer and selection was great but the service was poor poor poor.  We were only steps away from the greeters and what looked like the manager and no one came to ask us about refills or anything else to eat.  This place was memorable for the wrong reasons and we wont be back. Its not worth the trip from the loop.  I found out later from my sister and mother who sent gift certificates as birthday presents, that the email communications were snarky and rude.  And when we went to use the gift cards, one envelope had a hard credit card style certificate and the other didn't (only a piece of paper with a credit amount).  Again, no waitress.  When I explained what was sent to us they acted like we were stealing or something from them.  So, I gave them the envelopes and everything that came with the gift cards.  They did accept what was sent with attitude.      The atmosphere and attitude outweighed the quality and variety of the menu.  Its not worth it.  There is better food and better bars with great service that I would rather support than this snarky, rude, and snobby bunch.

Seriously a beer drinker's nirvana.  My wife introduced me to this place when we started dating (she originally lived in Andersonville) and I have never been disappointed whenever we come here. Yes it can be intimidating if you are a newbie to good beer.  Yes there are people who go to this bar who are fans of  beeradvocate.com .  Yes it can be busy on a weekend night.  So if you need your hand held, go on a weeknight or earlier on the weekend and the bartenders (all well versed in beer) will help walk you through different beers.  Or just bring me along and buy me a few rounds and I'll talk to you about the beers.  But the best way is to just try a few beers.  And these beers are reasonably priced.  Remember the quality of beer is better than Miller or Bud, the ABV is much higher as well. Let go of my Kwak!  A beer that is more fun to drink than it should be.  Just be sure to order it in the proper glass. But I'll always be in pursuit of Hoppyness with the great selections of IPAs.  They even carry the Dogfishhead 120minute IPA once in a while.

The food, however, was delicious!  I had a lamb dish that was just about perfect.  They rotate the menu often.  In fact, the website seems to have two different menus up now and neither one of them was the menu that we had when we went.  Every dish looks good, and they provide more than just one veggie dish.  My friend actually spent one her ""get out of veggie dish free"" cards and got the fish which she also found to be delicious.  I wish we had the scratch to spend lavishly on appetizers and desserts too.  I was nosing around at nearby tables.  Everything looks and smells great!  OMFG! The dining area is pleasant.  A bit of exposed-brick modern loft feel with a certain kind of nostalgic rustic-ness.  I've been in Chicago for almost 8 years and this is the first time I've been here.  Shame on me!  I just wish it was in my hood, though I do like this neighborhood a lot.",0.9952,0.748,0.229,0.023,0.6494047619047618

First, I'd like to say that the fact that I only come here for events shows the dedication Hopleaf has to the craft beer community. They like to open their space to let special things happen, how many other opportunities am I going to get to try that many types of BSBS (pro-tip, coffee is by far the best and I preferred the 2011 to the 2012 but there was some dissension among my group on this one).

We quickly realized there was no staff on this side, so despite having tables and booths, we had to go to the bar to order.  No biggie, actually.  The beer list is awesome and I thoroughly enjoyed my 5 Rabbit draft.  What was surprising was it cost $25.50 for three shots of Jameson, or $8.50 per.  I could get the whole bottle for that price.  And probably a couple of spicy McChickens to go with it.

The prosciutto and pork belly however were phenomenal. We also split a butternut squash curry soup, diver scallops, an order of onion rings, and an onion tartlet. The onion rings were over salted and greasy and the onion tartlet was overcooked. Sad face. The soup however, was amazing. Slightly spicy, full of flavor, and very creamy. The highlight for me was the roasted cauliflower salad - best salad I've eaten in a long time. I loved the mix of the raisins, Marcona almonds, roasted cauliflower, and apple.

I've tried: The mussels -SO delicious, I would very highly recommend them!! They come with a ton of fries that are also super good. Really a great amount of food and guaranteed to be delicious. Just do it. the CB&J - a bit of a flop. the bread was WAY too heavily fried (I was expecting more of a taosted and lightly buttery grilled cheese type bread, not super crispy ultra-buttered bread...), and there just wasn't enough filling. Honestly, skip it and just make your own grilled cheese with some jam at home and it'll be probably better for a fraction of the price. There's much better food at the hopleaf. However, I did really enjoy the macaroni that it came with. pork loin entree - they change their entrees a fair amount but this was quite good, came with some veggies and potatoes underneath. I enjoyed it. My boyfriend also got a pork rib entree that I sampled which was quite good. My favorite by far has been the mussels and fries. Just get the mussels!!!!",0.9984,0.657,0.321,0.022,0.6772446633825944
2013-03-02,4.0,"I had heard about Hopleaf for years, but it is in a bad location for me because I live in the Northwest suburbs.  This makes it a really long drive for beer drinking and it is too far from the downtown train hub to be practical. But enough bitching... One Saturday afternoon I finally made a day of Hopleaf. It is on a busy street, but there was a fair amount of parking available on the side streets.  Unfortunately, it was metered and required me to pay for two hour blocks of time.  This may be the norm in Chicago, but I don't drive here often.  So I was really irritated that I had to leave the bar every two hours, walk a block and buy another two hours. Getting to the bar, we walked in and there was a guy at the door checking ID's at 1PM in the afternoon.  I was a bit surprised that I got carded since I do not look even remotely close to 21.  Perhaps my youthful looking wife was the reason. We parked ourselves right at the first bar.  There is another bar deeper into this place, but we were happy with our selection.  The lighting is subdued and there is lots of dark wood.  This is my kind of place for drinking beer. Hopleaf has a fantastic beer selection.  I don't remember exactly what I had, but that just means that I had no trouble picking something... over and over.  I was kept busy for about 6 or 7 hours. The afternoon bartender was friendly and helped us through all the questions that new people probably always have.  She also made sure to keep our water glasses full.  Mature beer drinkers drink water and I appreciate bartenders that don't act put out by that.  The bartenders who came on later were less friendly as they were much busier since the crowds had started packing the place. I noticed that other customers were required to give a credit card to secure a tab, but for some reason they trusted us.  Maybe it was my grey hair or trustworthy face.  In any case, I appreciated being trusted to settle my debts.  I don't like being treated as if I am going to steal something. I had some food, but due to all the fantastic beer I don't remember all of it.  I did take notes on two items.  The onion tartlet was tasty and different.  I had never had anything like that before and I would get it again.  The frites that everyone raves about were fine but nothing special in my opinion.  Skinny fries served with seasoned mayo... I could take them or leave them. During the hours that I sat at the bar, I had conversations with several other customers as they came and went.  Everyone I met seemed friendly and it made my experience at Hopleaf that much better. Overall I enjoyed my day at Hopleaf and I wish there were places like it out in the burbs.  I would definitely go back, but I don't know when I will make the trek into the city again.",0.9941,0.768,0.155,0.077,0.46858841390091405

2013-02-23,2.0,"I am disappointed to give this 2 stars but after going there for the first (and most likely last) time tonight we were thoroughly unimpressed with our overall experience at Hopleaf Bar.  Overall, we thought the place was over-rated, had a limited menu and a beer selection was too overwhelming for those of us who don't consider ourselves beer snobs. Upon walking into the place we weren't directed where to go or who to see if we wanted to request a table.  Problem solvers we are, we figured it out and agreed that a 30min wait for a table in a place as well known as this wasn't bad at all.  Our server was great and encouraged the special and seemed genuinely interested in us as customers.   No doubt this place has received many great reviews applauding its food & beer selection, however its well-revered status did not hold true for our standards.  Though beer drinkers we're not, we would've preferred a tad more direction and suggestion when it came to making a drink decision.  Yes, the beer menu was descriptive and detailed, but incredibly overwhelming for those of us who (again) don't consider themselves ""beer snobs"".   If it wasn't for the fact that we felt our food was terrible we wouldn't have noticed how long it took for our food to come.  (Appetizer and entree.)  The sausage appetizer was great but we unfortunately cannot say the same for our entree.  We ordered the special which was Rabbit Sausage & Duck (not terrible, but not great) on top of baby food ... I mean, peas in a near puree substance.  Gross.  The other entree ordered was the Brisket Sandwich.  OK - at best.  I would have preferred the bread to be toasted as it got awfully soggy shortly after it was delivered to the table. It's disappointing to say that the best part of the plate was the fries.  Not even the pickle, coming from a Jewish girl!",0.9751,0.722,0.162,0.116,0.5407661782661782

2013-02-12,5.0,"They probably don't need my review, but I'll write something anyway. I was there for a good bye party on Jan 5. We had a large group, so there was a bit of a wait time; plus, it was Saturday night. We waited at the bar considering there were over 60 beers on tap! So many choices; luckily it wasn't very little time haha. I don't really like hoppy beer so my friend recommended Ommegang - Art of Darkness. I give it five thumbs up :) So we finally got a table. The waitress was very nice and friendly. She was extremely knowledgeable in beer. Given it was a busy night, she stopped by our table to check in on us every now and then. We didn't have to look around for her or anything, except when it was time to pay, but that doesn't really count. Service was excellent, I'd say! Now onto the meal: OMG the Broken Arrow Ranch Quail is to die for!! As well as the Squash Wellington. I am drooling now just thinking about these dishes! The dishes were neatly and splendidly presented. Definitely not your typical bar/pub food. The quail was perfectly cooked and was very tender. The pecan puree added a nice touch to the dish. The squash wellington burned my tongue because I couldn't wait. It was a great combination of food with the tumeric-apple butter sauce, brussel sprouts, leeks, and turnip.

Someone at the table had the Reuben, and I do remember that it was one of the tastiest Reubens I've ever had. And that pickle. That pickle was pickle perfection. (Of course we all shared. What, don't you?) As for beer, it was my first experience of Goose Island Green Line, because it was on tap and at the time, I couldn't get it out where I live. Therefore, I had to try it. Very nice and light, which worked well for our summer meal.  Place is loud, which is to be expected at a busy gastropub on a weekend evening.

2013-01-31,4.0,"I've been dying to go to Hopleaf and finally got the opportunity over the weekend.  We caught up with some good friends, drank, chowed and chatted.  Pretty nice little Saturday, or was it actually Sunday at that point?   I was told that we were in the expansion side of Hopleaf.  They've now got a lot of seating, and 60 beers on tap!  One of which was the Hopslam, which we all jumped at.  As my man Nachos called it, they sadly have no waitstaff service on this side.  I usually don't mind that when I'm across the pond, but it was pretty lame and damn annoying by the end of the night.  This is a crowded place and you'll have to elbow your way past people just to make it up to order.  Obviously food orders are going to monopolize quite a bit of the barkeep's time.  I also don't want to chance even dripping any of my beers on the return trip back to the table either.  That and the lack of taking reservations are my big gripes about Hopleaf. Other than that, we had a blast.  So many good beers on their list, that I probably didn't even get around to trying about a half dozen I had my eye on and it wasn't for lack of effort.   The food menu looked great too.  But, since we were just snacking we passed on the entrees and got the much ballyhooed mussels, brussel sprouts and beans.  The mussels and frites were fantastic.  I can easily see why folks rave about them.  Loved both of those, the sides were solid.   Even though I felt like we traveled nearly all the way to Milwaukee, Hopleaf delivered for us and was every bit as great as I had expected it to be.  Next time, I just hope the CTA has their shit a bit more together because there is no way in hell I'm driving up here and passing on their beers.",0.9331,0.757,0.137,0.105,0.5491935483870968

Bell's Hopslam is back, and although I'm happy about that, the 8 oz. pours had us ordering two at a time. We were so lucky to grab a booth by the back bar, but the whole area has no waitstaff; a complete mistep by Hopleaf, as a room of 30 people then need to get up and order food and drink at the bar. That seemed to bug both the people sitting at the bar, and those seated at tables that have no wait service. I'm sure an unemployed Waitress would love to work a full room on a hot Saturday night! Win-Win! The menu, itself, is a bit expensive. The mussels were good, but it was hard for me to find something that I actually felt like eating while drinking. Decided on the Brisket sandwich, and it was more like Corned beef with a horseradish sauce, Dan told me it was Montreal style. Well, I wanted Texas style brisket, dagnabbit!

The food is outstanding, given that this is, after all, a bar.  It's not your typical burgers and fries.  You get real variety with some new twists on old standards, and some extremely well-prepared favorites.  The steak frites and wonderful, and for everyone who tried the CB&J and didn't like it - try something else!  While it's true that the CB&J isn't my favorite either, the rest of the menu has been a real treat to explore.  I hope this place stays open for a long time to come!",0.9929,0.76,0.211,0.029,0.5702642185400807

I love beer, but I'm a lager gal who also enjoys a nice stout now and again. I do not like overly hoppy beers and for the life of me, I could not find a decent lager on their HUGE beer menu. However, our waitress did recommend a decent stout (Chief Blackhawk), so one star to her. Based on a previous perusal of the Hopleaf menu I had been interested in trying the CB&J (cashew butter, figs and some sort of cheese). I really had my hopes up for this one, savory and sweet in one sandwich? Yes, please! However, when it landed on our table it was basically fried bread (not toasted like a grilled cheese) with a swipe of fig jam and a touch of cashew butter. It was actually really gross. Frankly all you could taste was the hard, fried bread. And by fried bread, I mean almost crouton like in it's consistancy. Fried. Bread. The meal came with Stilton mac and cheese, which by all accounts I should've loved, yet there was nothing special about it...just sort of there. I kept taking small bites thinking I was missing something, but yeah, no. I wasn't missing anything. It just wasn't very good. I'll go back and try some other beers and maybe an appetizer (the frites were good; garlic aioli is good; super garlicky), but I would probably skip a main entree. PS: The others at my table liked what they got (squash in phyllo dough, brisket platter, tilapia sandwich), so that's why the second star.

2012-12-18,2.0,"I know... everyone LOVES Hopleaf. Thats why I came, after all. One word : Yikes! My girlfriend & I came on a Friday night at 8:00pm, fully expecting to wait at the bar for awhile, seeing as Hopleaf doesn't take reservations. Luckily they had a table for 2 ready ""by the kitchen"". We said we'd check it out & decide. Those who have been here know of the small strip of four tables for 2, on the way to the bathroom, across from the expediting station.  We said ok, sat & our waitress came by to say hello, but didn't take our drink order until her next visit, around 8:15. About 8:30 we got our drinks & placed our food order, which consisted of the CB&J sandwich, a broccoli & cauliflower salad & a side of mac & cheese. Our waitress then ignored our table for over an hour. She obviously was very busy on a Friday night, peak time, so we cut her some slack, but in the long run, its her job to at least check-in on her tables.  Our drinks sat empty for a long time (+15 mins) as we tried to politely get her attention. Its now 9:30pm. People seated around us came & went, i.e. people seated after us were getting THEIR food, as our waitress continued to ignore us. Is this what you get when you sit at the less-desired ""table by the kitchen""? Eh. Finally I flagged down another server & asked if we could please see our waitress. She came by & I asked for another round of drinks & when our food would be coming out as it was now 9:45pm. She scanned the tickets by the kitchen, then disappeared, not saying a word to us. I realized rather quickly that she never put the order in! She ran over to the POS system, then came back to the expediting area & the chef said ""Yeah, I know I saw it, I'll get it right out."" (We were sitting 3 feet away & could hear everything.)  Then she came to our table & said, ""It'll be right up"", as if that was explanation enough for us waiting so long. I said, ""What happened?"" Silence. ""You JUST put it in, didn't you?"" She stammered *BUSTED*... as I said to my friend, ""I just wanted to leave."" I would rather give my money to a business who cares about pleasing their customers. But our waitress then said she would comp our meal, so we stayed of course. I'm not an idiot! :) The food came around 10:10 & it was great, way to go kitchen staff! But the bottom line was, we didn't enjoy our experience. I would have given a 1 star review, but when our bill came, she did comp our food, which was appropriate, so this is now a 2 star review.

Came at 4pm and there was only a small lunch menu on the table with a few apps and sandwiches, assuming their dinner menu is more robust. My friend raved about the duck ruben which we were both severely disappointed in as each piece of duck had a thick strip of fat on it. Not marbled in fat, fat that could have been trimmed off easily. Me not being a mallard aficionado, maybe this is how you served duck, fat attached, though I highly doubt this is the case. The fries were thin and delicious at first but after a few minutes they were soggy, which I saw in a few other reviews. We also split the CBJ which had good flavor but but again not really impressed, the macaroni and cheese that came with it had a really really odd taste, might be the first time I haven't licked a bowl of macaroni and cheese let alone finish it.

We started with the belgian-style mussels and the scallop appetizer and both were delicious. Our entrees were the squash wellington, steak and frites, the duck reuben, and the ham & cheese sandwich. All were very good and the frites with the garlic aioli were fantastic. My wife is Dutch so she appreciates good fries with mayonnaise.

Could the superlatives we'd been hearing about its food possibly be accurate?  They were. And if anything, the food was even better than we could have imagined. This ain't your usual bar food. The is food served not just with quaity, but with a side order of imagination as well. And it's so good, it doesn't matter if you don't drink -- it's a bar you'll want to visit anyway. For example: I had a sandwich of house-made cashew butter, fig jam, and raclette cheese on sourdough bread that was then pan-fried (a combination that might sound odd, but was gooey and comforting), with a side of stilton macaroni-and-cheese plus house-made potato chips. _All_ the sandwiches and entrees were that unique, so the food wasn't just filing; it was a journey of discovery. We also ordered a charcuterie platter that was a good as it gets. Of the 15 or so possible choices, from which were to pick three, I chose venison pâté with pistachios and cherries, head cheese, and duck prosciutto. I ended the meal with apple fritters filled with chunks of warm apple and sprinkled with powdered sugar. The only problem was -- by then I was stuffed, and had to share! Which leads to the only Hopleaf problem -- it's in Chicago, and I'm not!  Which, I guess, is for the best.

2012-10-26,5.0,"I've been going to the Hopleaf with my wife and our friends for years and we have always enjoyed the food, drink and atmosphere. However, in recent years they became extremely popular and ended being overcrowed almost all the time. At one point my wife and I went by at 5pm on Wednesday and it was packed, no bar seats, and we just had to go elsewhere. Well, now they have finally expanded (and the full back story is they have been trying to get the building next door for several years but couldn't for reasons out of their control) and we went a few days ago to check out the new Hopleaf. What a great experience! Immediately the front area bar is - not overcrowded (though still full but I would expect that). Next, the original restaurant area is, yes full, but not overcrowded. Wait time on Saturday night at 7pm or so for dinner, 1 hour - ok fine! We found open bar stools in the new bar area where we could order an app and beer with no wait. And we were seated for dinner in probably 30 minutes. Their new kitchen has glass windows allowing you to check out the action. Best part of all? I EASILY had the best dinner at Hopleaf I have ever had. I rarely order the chicken dishes as that always feels boring and less adventurous to me. Well I ordered the chicken entree and it was cooked and flavored absolutely perfectly. Great job Hopleaf on making a good thing even better!",0.9962,0.754,0.221,0.024,0.5185950413223142

Very attentive and good at recommending beers and also giving her opinion about the food. The beer selection is mind-boggling, so having someone that can recommend beer based on what you like (or dislike) is key. The food just didn't do it for me. The menu is fairly limited in terms of options and not a lot of things really got my attention. I ordered the brisket platter, which the waitress said was a little bit of a crap shoot depending on the cut of meat your ended up getting. I went ahead anyway, because as I stated, not much was really jumping out at me. It was fine, but just not something that would make me go back. The mac and cheese that came with it was very tasty. My wife has a mushroom soup that did not taste like mushrooms. We both thought it tasted sort of like BBQ sauce. Weird, I know. It wasn't bad, just not what we expected.

Why does Hopleaf have someone carding at the door?  What other similar gastropubs have that practice?  This is not a young person's bar - my boyfriend's 72 year old father loves this place and a lot of the patrons are his peers.    The guy at the door - in his attempt to explain to me that the fact that I don't appear to be under 21 was not a factor - told me that he's seen 35 year olds who look younger than me.  Suffice it to say, overall this was just a really negative experience and left a bad taste.

It was a Monday night, so not super crowded, but there was a wait of 20 minutes or so. We sat out in the back beer garden, which is just a great spot. I had several delicious, strong beers (yesssss) and tried mussels for the first time ever in my life. The mussels had me hooked. The service was attentive and I was in love. Visit #2: My BFF from Michigan was in town and I wanted to impress her, so my friend and I took her to Hopleaf. I was espousing the wonders of the mussels, and she informed me she doesn't eat mussels. I had faith the rest of the food was awesome. I got the mussels, as planned, and they didn't taste AS good as before. Something was a bit off. Less seasoning or something. Still good, but hm... My BFF got a ham sandwich that she did NOT like. She said it tasted funny. I didn't try it, so I can't vouch for that. My guy friend got the trout and had no complaints. The rub with the second visit, beyond the food being ""off"" was the service. I know it was a Sunday night over Labor Day weekend and they were packed. But it was still a bit annoying when two tables, with as many or more people, were seated after us, ordered after us, but got their food before us. Mussels and all. Our dinner, not including the wait time in the bar, took almost three hours. Luckily my company was awesome, and the beer filled my belly, but if I was hungry I would've been pretty ticked off.

When we asked if we could sit somewhere else, he tried to seat us at the counter by the glass window overlooking the prep area and kitchen! Now when a whole bunch of tables are open, that's pretty annoying. We said we'd rather wait and get a decent table, so he finally led us over to a 2-top in the original area. He seemed pretty exasperated with us, which was annoying. I think they're still acting like they have such cramped quarters that they'll never seat 2 people at a 4-top. It was super annoying.

2012-09-08,1.0,"It was 1:45am, 15 minutes to closing time. I had about 1/3 of my Tripel Karmeliet left. My boyfriend and I had been there for about an hour and a half, drinking a few beers with his sister and her friend.  Little did we know, we were about to get kicked out and told never to return. We had already heard the ""It's closing time!!"" yells from various staff members, and were finishing up our beers and getting ready to head out. We knew we had at least 15 minutes to finish up, since most places begrudgingly (but politely) allow patrons to stay a few minutes after closing time.  So to say I was shocked when a large man on the Hopleaf staff with a scruffy beard and bandana on his head and an angry grimace came from behind the bar, his arm outstretched and his finger pointing directly at me, strode angrily toward me, yelled, ""I said, 'It's closing time'!!!"", grabbed my unfinished Tripel, stomped back to the bar and slammed it down on the counter, would be a bit of an understatement.  My boyfriend at I looked at each other in disbelief. He looked at his watch. It was 1:57am. We looked at his sister, who was staring open-mouthed at me. What the f**k just happened? I looked longingly at my Tripel. Then I got up and walked (didn't stomp, didn't stride, just walked) over to the Very Angry Man. ""Why did you take my beer?"" I asked. ""It's not even closing time and I'm not done with it."" Arm outstretched and finger pointing again, the pugnacious staffer pointed toward the door and yelled, ""Get out. NOW."" Dude. It's not even closing time. GET OUT. NOW!! Then as if on cue, as if waiting, poised, behind the curtain for their entrance onto the scene, three additional Hopleaf staff converged on us, pointing their fingers angrily and yelling at us to get out. The bartender chimed in with several choice f bombs, just for good measure. We were able to lodge one more sentence of protest before the Prickly Man yelled, ""GET OUT AND NEVER COME BACK. NEVER!!!"" Out on the street, we walked to the car, shaking our heads, and heard one last Hopleaf Hothead yell, ""Go ahead and get on Yelp!"" We thought that was a great idea. Needless to say, we won't be back.

2012-08-24,4.0,"There's been some swapping going on at Hopleaf over the last several months. At some point, apparently they stopped using brewery-specific glassware and substituted a few standard shapes/sizes of Hopleaf-stamped glasses.  I'm sure that this improved efficiency and increased their brand exposure, but it cost them some personality. On the upside, they upgraded the cramped quarters to...well, slightly less cramped quarters.  Let's face it, even with the new dining room and the summertime patio, this place still gets swamped with customers on a Saturday night. Perhaps most rewardingly of all, they seem to have ditched the pretension.  Or at least I can say that our most recent server, while dressed for Logan Square, gave Loop-perfect service.  Don't judge a book by its cover!  I wish that I had caught his name because he deserves a special mention. They seem to have enhanced the depth and variety on their dinner menu, to the point that my red-meat-averse wife finds a few appealing options.  But we both agreed that the execution of our meals could have been better.  I had the brisket platter and found it downright boring. The onion ""rings"" starter turned out to be strings, very greasy and salty.  That was disappointing, but the brownie dessert was phenomenal (especially when paired at home with my wife's outstanding homemade vanilla frozen custard). Hopleaf 2012:  Two steps forward, one step back.  Or is it the other way around?  It's still a great spot, but no longer mighty, despite the improvements.  These days, the beer list is equalled by many others in the city.  So you're fighting those crowds for a food and drink experience which is no longer top-drawer.",0.9563,0.812,0.121,0.067,0.4695784374355803

Montreal style at Hopleaf must mean dry, rubbery and flavorless because that's exactly what I got.  It was so tough that I couldn't even manage to bite into it and keep it on the bread, the whole sandwich fell apart. My brother in law got the brisket plate and didn't fair any better with a knife and fork.  My husband had the CB&J which was good- maybe a decent addition to a brunch menu but not what I would serve for dinner and we also had the stone fruit salad which was a joke. It didn't help that we had to wait forever to get our food- dinner took us over 2.5 hours- totally fine because we were with good company and everyone was enjoying their beers but I couldn't help looking over to see if our table was the lucky one when a waiter with dishes walked by.

After looking over the menu I settled on the Gunthorp Farms Pork Chop which I found to be tender but lacked flavor. The mash and was delicious, at the same time it couldn't save the dish. Paying $30 for a tasty mash is not one of my favorite things to do and left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Coupled with okay service it was a miss for me. Also the roomie complained of a foul smell and we found out it was the trash can that sat near the steps; when the wind picked up it'd roam over and disturb our so-so dinner. Lastly, since I don't drink beer I opted for a Ginger Ale that was from the fountain. When I asked for a refill I was told that it'd be an additional $2.50.

Let me tell you... everyone gets the Cashew Butter and Fig Jam sandwich but I am telling you to go out of your comfort zone and do something a litto crazay--- order a beer, eat a friggen rabbit or a cow? , show a little cleavage or if you are a guy show a little...... i mean well maybe it IS little so you might want to cover up! but ughhh .......OH you can buy a girl a beer... perhaps a girl who likes blue mooney kind of beers...like myself hehehe.

But the new reason they've solidified my love, and the reason I'm writing this review: the pork chop. It's the best thing I've eaten all year, hands down. It was perfectly cooked - I don't know how they do it, but it is completely worth it as the most expensive thing on the menu. I'm usually a budget diner, but I won't hesitate to get the pork chop again.  We also love the sausage plate (with the german potato salad), and the brisket platter. The one thing that maybe didn't wow me was their seasonal corn waffle entree. It sounded delicious in theory, but in the end I just didn't think it came together all that well. You will likely wait a while for a table, and they're likely working out the kinks of just having expanded considerably in the recent days.

We ordered food, as we usually do, and the quality control seemed rather off.  Obviously I can't chalk this up to the kinks of the new space for sure, but it seems likely.  We ordered the CB&J, an old favorite, and their sweet corn waffle, one of their new seasonal dishes.  The CB&J was about as mediocre as I've ever seen it--thin and greasy, like a diner grilled cheese.  The waffle was overcooked and dry, a problem which was only exacerbated by the lack of sufficient sauce on it.  The veggies were great, and the sauce was great; but the dish wasn't well prepared and was totally unbalanced.   As I said, my complaints should be taken with a grain of salt.  This is a fantastic bar and restaurant for anyone who likes good beer in a laid back atmosphere.  I will continue to be a regular customer here.  I just hope that they step up the quality control on the food, and do something about those terrible tables by the new kitchen!",0.9907,0.76,0.173,0.068,0.5330343403872815

Jury's still out.  We went to Hopleaf last night for a late (9pm) dinner after exploring the city for the majority of the afternoon.  We were greeted right away by a server in the front bar area, who let us know we could either sit in front and order from the bartender, or see the host toward the back for full service (what is this, a gas station?) We walked toward the back, as I was hopeful for a table on the patio.  When we were told it was a 45 minute wait (and the kitchen was only going to be open for about that long) we opted to sit inside, and did so immediately. It seemed to take our server a bit of time to get to our table, maybe because we were in the corner?  In the meantime, we were able to choose beverages from the extensive menu, and take in the décor.  I loved the exposed brick and antique artwork. To drink, I had an Original Sin cider, which is from NYC.  It was light and crisp, just what I wanted, nothing heavy.  My counterpart had a Manheur (sp?) #12, which is dark, but not heavy (I found it comparable to a barley wine.) Neither of us were very hungry, so we decided on the mussels for two, and we told the server we'd split a salad, but hadn't decided on which one.  The mussels came out very quickly, and were very tasty.  We ordered the Belgian style, the traditional way.  I love mussels, people.  They *might* be my favorite shellfish (don't tell the oysters.)  They were served with a cone of frittes with garlic aioli, and three large chunks of assumingly fresh baked bread for dippage. The server checked on us a few times, but didn't ask about the salad until her third trip back to the table (when we were finished with the mussels/frittes).  Had she asked the first time, I would've ordered something, and probably another beverage.  But all she said was (while both of our mouths were full) ""everything ok?"" and as I nodded, she turned on her heels and was gone.  Well, her loss for not up-selling us?

We were back in Chicago for Memorial Day and the first place we went was Hopleaf to grab a couple drinks and mussels around 4:30p. The front bar area was packed so we asked for a table in the restaurant and were seated upstairs, after arguing with the hostess about whether mussels and drinks constituted ""full service dining"".  We waited for almost 20 minutes for the server to take our drink and food order. I thought about leaving, but for old time's sake we wanted to stay. The place was not busy in the restaurant.

2012-05-21,4.0,"I've been to Hopleaf a handful of times and I've always enjoyed it. I'm not much for waiting to eat-- I get rather ornery, but Hopleaf has a lot of space where you can chill and have a brew or two, especially if your party is smaller. Keep in mind that you may be waiting for over 2 hours if you're a party more than 6. I witnessed it first hand, and boy, were they drunk!! I've always had a beer I liked here. The prices are pretty great and there is something for everyone. On the top floor, they have less bottles, but that's to be expected--and you can ONLY pay cash up there. They carry Revolution beer here which is pretty tasty, and I don't have to go over to the west side to get it ;) I have tried the mussels, the charcuterie (you can mix and match your meats), and the tilapia sandwich (breaded). I've heard great things about the CB&J but I really need some type of meat in my dinners. The mussels are fantastic as well as the two broths you can choose from. I believe one is made with beer, the other is not. The charcuterie was pretty good. They serve the most pungent and delicious spicy mustard that I would have loved to take home! The tilapia sandwich was ok, but it was coated in thick bread crumbs. Mind you, it was a hefty piece of fish but I was expecting something lighter-- as if! The fries here are phenomenal and they don't skimp on portions! They aioli they serve with it is addicting... really... REALLY. Bottom line: Shit ton of beers from you to choose from. Long waits. Amazing fries.  You should come here at least once in your lifetime if you live in Chicago and enjoy beer (GOOD beer).",0.9975,0.743,0.227,0.03,0.623611111111111

The thing I dislike the most, and its not their fault, exactly, is how busy the place is, and how long a wait it is to get a seat, ever. Like Yogi Berra said ""nobody goes there anymore, its too crowded."" So my recommendation is to go some time when they aren't too busy (yeah, I know, they're always busy). I think they're expanding into the adjoining place, so maybe things will go a bit more smoothly once that goes down, and they'll be able to run they place properly. Cos right now, its a goddamn mosh pit in there. Not a fun environment, unless you're into that sort of thing. I'm not. But if you can manage to get a table, at which point you're golden, good on ya. No reservations, and they won't seat you if your whole party isn't there, and other nasty triage-type restrictions which I understand, due to how ridiculously busy they are, but that's unwelcoming and not cool in my book. Maybe just go when they first open up for the day. Of course, the dining area isn't even open at that point. Well, whatever. Unless you wanted a CB&J (Elvis food, I call it), you're better off just drinking Belgian beers and getting outta there before it becomes a fire hazard.",-0.2297,0.858,0.067,0.075,0.45385487528344676

It was so nice of him to carve out a little space for me in the crowded front lobby so I could be comfortable while I waited! Beer was great, though that's pretty hard to mess up, huh? I wish I had gotten the mussels like my friend. I got the brisket instead. I guess when I think brisket I think Texas BBQ brisket. This was good, but very fatty. I had to cut off the fatty parts. The Stilton mac and cheese, on the other hand, wow that was good. The waitress assured us that the asparagus with lemon butter would be in the top 5 of our life asparagus experiences, and I'm pretty sure she was right. Big fat pieces of asparagus, roasted to perfection. Fries were also perfect! For dessert we split the apple fritters. Again, they weren't what I was expecting, but this time it was in a good way.

2012-04-24,4.0,"I visited Hopleaf for the second time last night, and they were pretty busy for a Monday night at 7pm. The last time I frequented this establishment was in December of 2011 on a Friday night, where it was packed and bustling with a long wait. We were seated upstairs on the balcony overlooking the majority of the restaurant, which was nice. I will break down my experience as follows:  The Beer Menu: Hands down, five stars. There is always an incredible draft selection that is broken down into Belgian Draft Beers and other Craft Brews from around the globe. No matter how picky the beer drinker is (ahem, my father who joined me and was looking for a Blue Moon...) there is something to be enjoyed. Our table ranged in choices from an English Apple Cider to an Allagash White, and everyone seemed content. I'm also amazed at the extensive bottle list that Hopleaf has, and the choices can be quite overwhelming! All in all, if this establishment went downhill as a whole, but kept their beer selection intact, I would still frequent it on a regular basis. The Service: Three stars. It appears to have gone downhill since the last time we were at Hopleaf, which as I mentioned was on a busy Friday night and we had a VERY attentive waitress. For it being a Monday night, and slow by comparison, our waiter was slow at getting us beers. Luckily, the first round came rather quickly (after he almost dumped half of it on the floor) so we didn't really notice how slow he was to check on us/replenish our drinks. As for the food, we put in our order within 15 minutes of arriving, and it took about 45 minutes for the food to come out. We didn't get anything too crazy--just the brisket sandwich, the brisket platter, the rabbit, and the Flemish stew, but it all came out piece-meal and slow. This is a problem for me, as I feel that the food should have come out together, or within minutes... not 10-15 minutes of one another.  The Food: This ranges somewhere between three and four stars. We started out with an order of frites for the table, which were just okay. Some of the frites were soggy and others were overdone. Although, the side of mayo/aioli was to die for, so this made up for some of the lackluster frites. For the main entree I chose the brisket platter which was pretty good. Sure, it's no Smoque or Smoke Daddy, but their take on it was very interesting. The brisket was somewhere between a jerkey-like consistency and a thin cut brisket. It was served with a small side of mac and cheese which was gooey and saucy and sprinkled with breadcrumbs--everything a good bowl of mac and cheese should consist of. Also, the side of mustard was absolutely delicious, as a little bit went a long way and really enhanced the flavor of the meat. I'd recommend this dish as it seems to consistently be on the menu. My boyfriend got the rabbit dish, which I nabbed a few bites of. The rabbit was perfectly cooked and flavorful, and the dish was a lot larger than I imagined. It was served in a gravy with vegetables and a bread/cracker/crust side, and the whole dish reminded me of a deconstructed pot pie. He seemed to thoroughly enjoy it, and based on the bites I had, it was a pretty great dish! The other members in our party seemed to enjoy their food as well, and I heard no complaints about the restaurant choice! I know I'll be back to Hopleaf in the near future (considering I'm moving dangerously close to this gem in a few weeks) and I can't wait to see what entrees they cycle into their menu, as it seems to change frequently. If you're in the Uptown/Andersonville neighborhood, definitely give this restaurant a go.",0.9941,0.842,0.114,0.045,0.45088428665351743
2012-04-20,1.0,"Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me... Yup, I ventured back for the food and it is at best ordinary across the pork chop (bland), steak frites (over salted fries), mussels and (was it?) duck Reuben. It was also very ordinary to be sat at a table for four with five in our party. Whilst, the beer range is extensive it is not cheap and does not have a good representation of local and WI/MI beers. The highlight of the night again was the doorman (greeters actually greet) and his staring blankly without a word at 'customers' as they left was gold.

We went to the back to save a spot on the dinner reservation and were told that it would be 30-45 minutes. A little odd for the middle of the week and a small bar/restaurant, but nobigdeal. In reality, it wouldn't have been so bad had I not smelled the frites that they were cooking up in the kitchen.  YUM! Luckily for us Hopleaf has a fantastic selection of draught beer on tap. The assortment kept us occupied until we were seated about 35 minutes later. We were taken upstairs to eat our dinner where I think they had the thermostat set at 50 degrees.  Our server was attentive and friendly. I got the brisket sandwich on sourdough which was pretty good. There was a vinegar-y mustard sauce on it that in my mind took away from the flavor of the brisket. It came with plenty of meat though and the sourdough was toasted to perfection. Along with the sammy came a side of frites which I had been waiting for ever since I got a whiff of them as I was waiting to be seated. They were thin cut and ohsodelicious. The meal came with a side of garlic aeoli  sauce which was uber garlicy, so I didn't care much for it, but my co-diners enjoyed it a bunch. The menu did not have very many things on it that I would ever eat. I have to admit that I settled for the brisket because there wasn't anything else on the menu that I wanted to try. The meals are a little out there so if you are looking for a spin on traditional plates you might enjoy it. I was just looking for a pub burger and they didn't have it here. A little disappointing that when we were done eating they told us that we could stay upstairs for a little while but that if we wanted drinks we would have to go get them ourselves from downstairs.

But to qualify as a bar, particularly as a bar with a kitchen, you have to do something about food. Chicago is a home to many fine gastropubs. I am not expecting every pub to have fancy, creative food. Far from it. It is actually rather comforting to have a couple of beers with rather simple food. But that's exactly what the problem is. The food is just not good here. Salty, soggy, mushy, burnt, badly mixed flavors - you name it. It would have passed for food in a whole-in-the-wall pub with bad beer.

The entree my wife and I split was edible, if unappealingly presented. For the price? Unacceptable, as the portion size was more ""appetizer"" or ""side dish."" Regardless, it wasn't good enough for us to finish, even after the disappointment of the ""frites."" Our server seemed uninterested. We were never asked if we wanted refills (probably for the best; my wife chased down our [very nice] hostess to get more soda and was shocked when the refill showed up as $2.50 on our check). After getting our order, I don't think we saw our server again until our check appeared - they didn't even try to upsell us on dessert, which my wife was in the mood for. Maybe our server was just having a bad day, as we also got ignored when we thanked them on our way out. Beer selection had nice choices from local, national, and international breweries. ""Best Beer Bar in Chicago,"" though? Not unless Quenchers and the Map Room (and probably other places) get sucked into a black hole. We won't be going back, not when I can get a better beer selection and better (and cheaper) food much closer to home at Quenchers; if I'm in the neighborhood and want to grab a drink, Simon's is right there, too - I'd rather support their friendly staff and awesome jukebox than the Hop Leaf's indifferent food and service.",0.9659,0.812,0.123,0.065,0.5085813492063492

There is street parking but if you check the side streets or on parts of Foster, parking is free so you won't have to hurry back to feed the meter. Another major plus is that you have to be 21 to get in.  I am personally not much of a beer drinker but had the Kriek and it was delicious. Probably too sweet for the average beer consumer, but just right for me. They are very knowledgeable about all of their beers (and if you look at the menu, you know that's not an easy feat).

2012-03-05,5.0,"When in Rome"" is the bf's fave saying when having to consume something he normally doesn't get.  That means, pork at a relatives' house, or beer at a pizza dinner.  It's just not for him.  And for me, I share the same sentiments when it comes to beer, but here at Hopleaf, you HAVE to try their beer with the extensive line that they have on draft, and the bottled ones as well.  I can't begin to tell you the first thing about beer.  I came here for the mussels because of the numerous recommendations I've gotten, but hey, ""When in Rome"", I will try a beer.  The server was patient and accommodating with making her suggestion. The menu was equally helpful, with its on-point description of each craft.  I made my decision on the McAuslan St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout, which was a thick malt with a chocolate taste.  I figured with a rich chocolate flavor, you can't go wrong, and I sure didn't! It was a great tasting drink.   The mussels came out in a medium sized pot, as we shared the ""Mussels for Two"". We chose the Belgian style which was marinated in ale, shallots, celery and thyme.  Nicely flavored, but the only thing missing was a big heaping of garlic.  Accompanying the mussels were a giant's serving size of shoestring fries with a garlic aioli dipping sauce.  If any of your other entrees have fries, I'd suggest you order a side salad or onion rings in place of it, otherwise you're stuck with more than you'd bargained for.   The cod. Unassuming.  Get this! Not at all a McDonald's fish fry on a toosoggyofabun!   Little Giada De Laurentis would be spitting out every adjective from her show: flaky, buttery, crispy, fresh.  I passed on this sandwich and next time, I won't give it a second thought!  Duck reuben: Duck is a typically fatty meat.  This sandwich was far from that, and yet still had the mighty duck essence without being rich. so all those made this a trifecta sandwich.   Cheese added to ooey gooey factor, the bread was nice and crisp,  On a side note, The Eater just released an article with the Hopleaf's owner saying that they were expanding the restaurant, which is due to open in mid April.  In the winter, the dining room expects to seat 275 diners, and 310 in the summer with the patio.  This is a huge asset to the place, as we dined on a Monday evening and the place was pretty full for being a weeknight.  Until then, see if you can request a table on the mezzanine space on the second level, which is also anticipating a new face lift and expansion.",0.9921,0.864,0.115,0.021,0.5340768799102132
2012-03-03,2.0,"I know everyone has a big boner for Hopleaf, but honestly, I've always been less than impressed.  I think their popularity has sort of gone to their head and they don't think they need to bother with their customers because there are always more Andersonville-ians waiting to get in.  And while they do have a vast beer selection, it seems like it is always very heavy on the Belgians, which is not my cup of... beer?  It's always SUPER crowded which, good on them, but it's a bummer trying to find somewhere to sit.   On my most recent visit to Hopleaf, I was with a large group, celebrating a birthday. Some of us (including me) wanted to eat, but getting a table in the back area was like getting into Fort Knox.  We stood on the ramp leading back to the dining area for a while, next to what appeared to be a couple flirting with each other, also waiting for a table.  Eventually a server approached us and asked if we were waiting to be seated.  I answered yes, after which the server asked if we were eating.  When I said not all of us would be, the girl who I thought was flirting with her boyfriend stepped forward and told me we could only sit in back if we were eating.  So...this girl worked there and completely ignored a large group of people who were waiting to be seated while she hit on some dude? Lame.  And I get it, it's annoying if you're trying to reserve the back area only for people who are eating, but when the front is too crowded for people to even stand, you might consider loosening up those restrictions.

They open at 3pm on weekdays (I'm not sure about weekends), but they don't start serving food until 5pm.  You can eat in the front room if you order food through the bar.  So once the back room was all set up, we grabbed a table.  We started off with the chips and the onion rings.  The chips were good, but the onions were fantastic.  They're more like super thin onion strings and come with garlic aioli.  A huge plate of them was placed in front of us, and we ate every single bit.  I got the duck reuben, and unaware of the mound of fries that accompanies it, because I also got a side of brussel sprouts with bacon lardons.  The marble rye bread for the duck reuben was awesome.  I gave away two large handfuls of fries to my friend and was still left with so much food.  I could've easily shared the duck reuben with a friend. The events here seem amazing and make Hopleaf even cooler, if at all possible.  I missed the Dogfish Head Day less than a week ago.  They even had Bitches Brew on tap, so I cannot believe I didn't go.  Despite Hopleaf being a bit of a hike from the Berwyn stop, I will very likely be back soon with my beer-loving best friend.",0.9983,0.759,0.195,0.046,0.5625414078674948

You can find some delicious Tripels and lambics.  We stopped in right after they opened at 3:00 pm on a Saturday and managed to snag two seats at the bar. Quite a feat because the place got packed within 30 min after we arrived and people were standing around waiting for bar seats. A fan of lambics, I ordered an Oud Beersel framboise, a dry lambic flavored with raspberries and an awesome champagne-like acidity. Just a wonderful way to start off our visit. I followed up with a delicious d'Achouffe IPA Tripel, which wasn't a hop bomb like most American IPAs, but a more moderate, well balanced beer, with a lighter hoppy dryness and with a citrus, grassy finish.  On a stop at the Hopleaf you absolutely cannot leave without having the CB&J (cashew butter, fig jam, and Morbier cheese). What really makes this dish is not just the blend of creamy butter and the rich, creamy cheese, enhance with sweet jam, but the beautifully toasted bread is what makes this dish a homerun.

Mussels were plump and well portioned, tho the sauce or broth was not the dipping delight that many had raved about (too light, coulda used more butter flavor or something).

The only downside is that they're always too busy to hang out. It's like that here: the biggest problem is going to be getting a table.  My lady friend and I went to Hopleaf on a Wednesday evening and despite my earlier description, had no issue getting a table on the restaurant side when we arrived at about 5:30. By 6:00pm, every table was full. With the brick walls and wood floor, noise level is high but not unbearable. Tables are close enough to hear details of your neighbors conversations. Intimate dinners here are ill-advised. However, if meeting casually with friends it's perfect. The menu is focused on hearty Belgian and German fare and if our sampling was indicative of the quality across the board, I'd say they have it down pat. Food was 5 stars. The Alpine sausages with German potato salad was perfect. Tender fingerling potatoes, onion, a touch of bacon and a great vinaigrette mixed with 3 different sausages. Each sausage was seasoned differently and delicious in their own way. The brandade was wonderful and light; almost delicate despite the strong nature of its individual components. It's accompanying frisee salad was fresh, green, and crisp. While I did not order any other salad, I did see a couple delivered and all the greens looked just as good. For the main course we ordered mussels for two in the Belgian style. This was a lot of mussels; it could easily have been shared for 3 or 4. They were steamed in a Belgian ale with shallot, celery, thyme, and bay; and served with some excellent bread -- rare in the city, in my opinion -- and frites with aioli. The mussels themselves were of excellent quality. I did not find one closed mussel nor did I come across any grit whatsoever. All of them were plump and flavorful. The broth was well balanced and the vegetables included were still steam-crisp and tasty. The frites were plentiful and crisp, but salty -- and frites are something I like salty. Still, here, a little too much. You'll be thirsty later. While I have not mentioned the beer list, it is both broad and deep, with an emphasis on (of course) Belgian and Belgian-style beers. When in Rome, do as the Romans. I would recommend the Leffe Brune as a good all-around selection. It looks darker than it drinks and paired well with everything ordered.  We didn't ask  for a dessert menu as we were too full. Portions were large, even for appetizers -- they should probably be shared. Prices were good as well. I would recommend this place to those who have the time to enjoy a leisurely meal or to those who are craft beer enthusiasts. Good food, good beer and good friendships are the theme here.

2012-02-15,4.0,"With over 1,000 Yelp reviews there is not much to say about Hopleaf that has not been said already. I journeyed there tonight with my wife and a couple of friends and had a great time; awesome selection of craft beers and very nice menu with interesting, good quality food that is far superior to typical pub fare (and extremely reasonably priced to boot). Hopleaf has the vibe of being in a pub in Europe; it is a bit noisy but not uncomfortably loud. There is a large bar area, a back dining room and a small loft (as well as a beer garden for the warmer months).  This was my first trip to Hopleaf in a while and the evening started off a little awkward when I was carded by the bouncer; as I am closer to qualifying for a senior discount than I am to being underage this was kind of a tacky manner to be greeted in a place that has the reputation for being upscale and sophisticated. During prior visits to Hopleaf I have had to wait for a table (it is a very popular venue), but fortunately tonight the dining room was not yet at capacity and we were immediately seated once our entire party arrived (it was a Wednesday evening around 6:30pm). My wife and I started off the evening with a round of their beers at the bar while waiting on our friends. Hopleaf has a vast beer menu and there is a nice description of each of the approximately three dozen beers on tap (with one side being U.S. beers and the other imports - mostly Belgian). Most are priced in the $6 to $7.50 range and all come with the appropriate style glassware. This is a place for beer aficionados; asking for Bud or Miller here would be akin to ordering water at Coyote Ugly. The bartenders are knowledgeable if you are not familiar with the beers, just let them know what kinds of beer you like and they will hook you up with something similar. They also are flexible with permitting you to sample a couple of beers before making your selection. I started with a Golden State Ale (brewed with poppy seeds) by Uncommon Brewers that was very good. I had the Half Acre Daisy Cutter Pale Ale with my meal which was extremely hoppy and delicious.  Once our friends arrived we were seated in the dining room. For food our table wound up sharing several appetizers and the CB&J sandwich (Cashew Butter, Fig Jam and Raclette cheese pan fried on sourdough served with chips and stilton mac n' cheese). Appetizer wise we went with their famous mussels (which were steeped in a white ale sauce with shallots and came with a very large cone of fries), the Chef Martin sausage plate (served with bourbon pancetta beans), the sauteed veal sweetbreads (served with pickled beets and broccoli) and an extra order of the stilton mac n' cheese. With the exception of the sausages the portions were extremely generous and everything tasted great. The entire meal (including tax, tip, and a beer a piece) came to just $22 per/person, so really a great bargain for food and drinks of this quality. Despite mainly ordering just appetizers, the portions were so large and the food so hearty that we were pleasantly stuffed.  Our service was pretty much run of the mill. No complaints as she was sufficiently attentive, the food and beverages came out at a decent pace and no mistakes were made with our order or tab, but neither the servers nor the bartenders displayed much charm or personality. They just were pretty much about business. Hopleaf is definitely among the better venues in Chicago for sampling a variety of craft beers and for upscale pub food. Due to their tendency to become crowded (and their no reservation policy) I recommend coming on a weeknight if possible or arriving early.

2012-02-10,4.0,"Overall - a great place. Went on a Thursday night and was very impressed by how packed, yet calm and inviting the atmosphere was. Walked to the back of the restaurant to get a table and the hostess said that it would be a little bit of a wait, but we were free to go upstairs and grab a beer and hang out. The bartender upstairs was extremely personable and made us feel right at home. A few minutes after we grabbed our beers, the hostess came upstairs and found us to let us know our table was ready and walked us back down to the dining room. Being in the industry, I am constantly looking for/noticing the little details of service that most people wouldn't (and am usually easy to disappoint). However, this was not the case at all. Our server was very knowledgable and sweet - always close by if we needed anything but not in-your-face or pushy which is always awesome to see - especially on a busy night. All in all - I will definitely be back soon. Service - 10/10 Beer Selection - 10/10 (Any bar with Daisy Cutter on tap is doing something right, not to mention the slew of amazing micro brews, etc.) Food - 7/10 Mussels are a must - you won't get a better deal anywhere - ESPECIALLY for the price and the HUGE side of pomme frites and baguette that comes with each order. Both brussel sprout dishes are amazing - personally I would go back for the ones with truffle oil... The other prep. (with bacon lardons) was also delicious, but a little in your face with the overwhelming pork flavor. Steak and Frites - PASS. I was sure that their 10-12 oz grass fed ribeye would be amazing after tasting everything up to the point, but.. nawww. For one, it kindof pissed me off that you cant substitute sides because I really wanted to try the mac and cheese... but you can ONLY get the frites or a salad - Opted for the salad which was just that... a salad.. because I was already stuffed with the huge order of frites that came with the mussels. Second, you have a choice of which butter you want over the steak - we got the lemon horseradish butter, which was just a HUGE dollop of from what I could taste.. lemon juice and butter - didn't add anything to the steak and waayyyy too much that it overpowered everything because it was already half melted when it got to the table. Last, the steak itself, was nothing more than you what you would expect at Fridays or Applebee's, etc.. to be honest, maybe not even that mediocre.. It was a nice size, but oddly thin.. you could tell it had been marked on the grill, but aside from some faint lines, there was basically NO sear on the steak, which just left it limp.. fatty.. and sitting in a pool of melted butter. I couldn't help but keep thinking about the nasty looking steaks that they would eat in the movie Napoleon Dynamite.  Usually people judge a restaurant based on the last thing they eat, as it's what sticks in their mind the most... for me and the steak - I would usually say that I'd never go back.. HOWEVER, because of the rest of the food, the service, the brews... pretty much EVERYTHING else, I am hyped to go back and try the rest of the menu.",0.9966,0.829,0.138,0.032,0.541124968505921

And the mussels come with bread and really good pomme frites! And the price for them wasn't bad at all! The atmosphere is really cool. I'm not sure how else to describe it.  The beef briskett platter is definitely enough for two people if you aren't that hungry, the meat definitely melted in my mouth.

The roasted beet salad is amazing, it has a good variety of veggies and fruit and the pistachio vinaigrette is a party in your mouth. I never realized salad could taste that good.

We hung out around the bar to try a few of their HUGE selection of beers on tap (and they have another list for their beers in bottles I believe).  Be prepared to wait since they don't take reservations. When we were seated, we were starving and the food didn't disappoint.  We ordered mussels for two for the table just so we could try their specialty...but we didn't expect them to give us so many! We chose their Belgian-style sauce (white ale with sliced shallots, celery, thyme & bayleaf) and I would've drank the sauce itself because it was delicious. My boyfriend and I shared the Potato-Gouda Croquettes, Sauteed Veal Sweetbreads, Roasted Beet salad, their daily soup which was celery root, and some stew that he ordered (I can't remember the name).  Everything was so good! I love sweetbreads and these were good as well...but I was sad that it wasn't a bigger serving. We were definitely full and content by the end of our meal.  It was a struggle trying to finish the huge pot of mussels along with all the food we ordered.  Hopefully we'll be back soon!",0.9935,0.735,0.223,0.042,0.55

If you want a lighter meal, get the mussels (probably the best in the city). Or, if you're in the mood for something a little fancier, they always have several more constructed bistro-type items on the menu, like roast chicken, steak, a pan-seared fish, etc.  Like others have said, the major downside to this place is that it's always packed.

Hopleaf is really the original gastropub in Chicago, doing things that every other place is doing, but for the most part doing it better and doing it much longer. Hopleaf is the standard bearer and is always a fine choice on the north side. There's not much I can say that others have not. The food is great - probably the best mussels in the city and well priced for the portion size. The frites and aioli are fantastic and are a welcome sight as a side to the mussels. The duck reuben is genius and delicious and I want one right now with a side of stilton mac and cheese. That's right folks, blue cheese mac. If you like charceuterie then Hopleaf is the place for you. Great selection of cured meats, pates and terrines. The one thing I haven't had yet that I always bypass for mussels is the CB&J sandwich.

From a long list of America crafts to an abundance of belgiums and limited-run beer, Hopleaf really has most everything you need in a great atmosphere. The decor is great and there are no TVs, which is a nice change of pace from most places. I appreciate the upstairs space to hang out if you don't want food or are waiting for a table downstairs. I also like the fact that you can mill around and get a table in the front and eat there too by ordering at the bar. A lot of people hate on Hopleaf because of the wait time, especially at night on a Wed-Sat but that's the state of this place. It's popular and tremendous so why mess with what works. Hopleaf was going to expand into the empty storefront next door but that hasn't come to fruition, probably due to the economy.  I say leave it as is. As far as negatives?

The broth is the perfect combo of butter, cream and booze. You get a good bit of them in a pot they sit on your table. The second time I went I got the wine and pork broth mussels and didn't enjoy them nearly as much. Maybe I only like my mussels cooked one way.  The steak frites is bigger than any I've ever had. It's a mountain of fries topped with a huge ribeye steak. I'm not sure how they think it's a serving for one person. The herb butter is the best thing on the plate. It makes everything taste better.

Our plans were changed, however, when we decided we didn't want to leave Hopleaf at all for the rest of the evening. To start with, the beer list is about as tall as I am, and impressively varied. They have a very large selection of beers on tap, and an equally large and more varied selection of bottled beers and ciders to choose from. Our discovery of the night was Clos Normand, a brut cider from France. The menu is equally impressive - Hopleaf is a place that chooses to focus on a smaller variety of amazingly executed dishes rather than trying to branch out at the expense of quality. My friends and I all ordered dishes and ended up sharing everything amidst an endless series of ""oh my god this is amazing try it"".

This was the first time I've ever managed to eat in the dining room because every other time I've tried the wait has been approximately 2 hours.  We started with mussels and frites. We got both kinds of mussels: curry and beer. In my opinion, the beer ones were far superior. The frites were delicious, per usual. For my main course, I opted for the CB&J sandwich, which everyone is always raving about. It came with a side of potato chips and mac n' cheese, which ended up being way too much heavy food for one meal. The sandwich was fine, but I didn't think it was the best thing ever. I was underwhelmed by the mac n' cheese and the potato chips just seemed unnecessary. I think this dish would benefit from a side salad or something a little lighter. Virtually everyone else in our group liked their food but also felt it was too heavy. Several of us needed to take Zantac after the meal just to make it through the rest of the night!

2011-09-18,1.0,"Given its high marks on Yelp and some good reviews from friends, I was extremely excited to have dinner and drinks at Hopleaf. However, when I went there yesterday with a group of girlfriends, I was extremely disappointed -- bad service, bad food, high tab. I've not had such a bad dining experience since... well, ever. I am a lover of all food; seriously, I will eat anything. It is not often that I leave food on my plate, and it is even less often that I will write something like ""terrible service, bad food, won't be back"" on my check. But I did, and here's why: I got to Hopleaf before my lady friends. The bar was quite crowded so I meandered to the back of the restaurant, where I was met by a hostess. I said, ""Hello. I'm meeting some friends, I'm not sure if they're here yet."" The hostess cut me off and said, ""Well, I don't know if they're here yet either. Go look for them outside."" Her response seemed a bit rude, but I decided to overlook it. I went to the patio, where one of my friends appeared moments later. The patio is nice, but it is extremely dark, and all the tables near the very dim lights had been taken. We sat in a black corner, where we had to use our cell phones to read the menu.  When the rest of our friends arrived, the waitress came by and gave us some drink suggestions, which was about all she did for the entire two hours we sat there. Drinks came to the table in an extremely slow fashion. Water had to be asked for more than once. We ended up ordering two appetizers (mussels for two and the cheese plate), which came 45 minutes after we ordered them. The mussels tasted fine, but they were by no means outstanding. There was barely any broth in the dish. The best part of the appetizer was the fries and aioli dipping sauce, but honestly, I didn't come to Hopleaf for the fries. I can get good fries elsewhere without paying $46 for dinner. We asked the waitress for more bread to dip in the broth (we had five people at the table), but like the water, it never showed. A very nice busboy ended up bringing us bread and water. His service was really the only redeeming part of the evening. Additionally, the cheese plate left something to be desired. Maybe it was a poor choice on our part given that we had so many mouths to feed, but this plate was dainty, to say the least.  Dinner came a bit quicker than our appetizers, but on the whole, it was pretty terrible. Two of my friends ordered the brisket sandwich, and one of those friends didn't even eat it. She literally gave her whole plate back to the waitress, who just took the plate without even asking why my friend was returning it. My other friend ate some of hers, but she didn't like it either. She said the meat was too fatty. I, myself, had a similar problem with the pork belly and prawns entree. I always jump at the chance to order pork belly because I think it is delicious. I realize that pork belly is a fattier cut of meat, but what I received was so disgustingly fatty that I barely ate it. The prawns were fine, but the corn pudding that came with it was sub par, and the fruit salsa that was supposed to come with it was almost nonexistent. I had one of the most expensive meals on the menu so I expected a lot more from it. Please... don't make me pay $23 for something almost inedible. My next friend ordered the duck reuben, which was better than the other meals, but that's really not saying a lot. It was pretty unimpressive, even though the description sounded inspired. The last friend ordered the soup of the day, which, if I remember correctly, was a ginger carrot soup. She said it tasted good, but for the flowers on top, which, considering the rest of the meals, was hardly anything to complain about.  For the main part of our meal, we only had five people at our table. One other girlfriend showed up at the very end for one drink, and then we were charged gratuity for six. I understand that this is restaurant policy, but our waitress DID NOT deserve a $40 tip. Now, you might be wondering why we didn't complain. Well, we would have if our waitress ever came back... someone else brought our check. Usually, I think a restaurant deserves two chances before I make up my mind about it, but one chance was more than enough in this case. I definitely won't be back.",0.9974,0.789,0.146,0.065,0.4950505050505051

For the charcuterie I chose the duck breast prosciutto, rabbit rillette, and lardo and all were very nice. For my entree I had the pork belly and head on prawns. The pork belly was amazing, the prawns were flavorful, but I didn't get much out of the head when I tried to suck the brains out. For dessert I ordered the Bourbon County Stout chocolate mousse. I had apparently ordered the last one they had and the bartender decided the glass it was served in wasn't clean enough and sent it back.

Unfortunately, not many items to choose from should you want something a bit lighter.  For this reason, I'm not a big fan during the summer months.  And while they do have a few vegetarian options, this is NOT the place to bring your herbivore friends.

I've been wanting to check this place out for quite sometime now and yesterday I finally had the will power to hop into 22 and get here for a date night with my husband. Since he was a little late (as usual) I got to explore the area. Such cute stores, bars and restaurants int he neighborhood that I already have plans of going to a couple of restaurants nearby. Finally when we went inside the bar area was packed and the bartender was kind enough to inform us that we need to go deeper inside, find a waitress, give our names and wait for a table. 40 minute wait time on a weekday... but I was not complaining as I was determined to try at least a couple of beers from their extensive list. The patio is so cool that you almost feel like you're there to attend an awesome house party. Looking at the young crowd, for a minute I thought someone's gonna start playing beer pong. Anyways, we decided to stick to the Belgian ales. The Dekoninck, Tripel Karmeleit were amazing but the Kwak (the beer served in a round-bottomed glass... like the ones in a Chemistry lab!) was a little too strong and earthy for my taste but my husband enjoyed it.

2011-08-14,5.0,"Quite simply my favorite place on Earth. The encyclopedic beer list is hands-down the best in Chicago, no arguments - it always contains some local stalwarts such as Alpha King, Daisy Cutter and Green Line, as well as more interesting brews from the Chicago area's finest microbreweries. It also manages to bring in limited-edition selections from important microbreweries from around the nation (Dogfish Head, North Coast, Sierra Nevada, and New Belgium are frequent fliers), as well as a long list of Belgians that are difficult to find elsewhere in Chicago. And that's just the drafts - the bottle menu is Delirium-esque in scope. They have everything from Italian brews that taste most like Champagne to all the Belgian Trappists (apart from the impossible to find Westvleteren). If you want Bud, or even Sam's, go to the Jewel, because you won't find standard offerings on this beer list. Go to town on some stuff you've never heard of, and perhaps will never encounter again! The food is also uniformly divine. I have quite simply never had a bad bite here myself*, and I've probably eaten here 2 dozen times. The moules frites are the best I've tasted anywhere, including Europe - the mussels are perfectly tender in either preparation (one of which is always Wittekerke Belgian white with onions, and the other of which varies seasonally), and the frites are delectably thin and crisp, and are served with a garlic aioli that is delicious enough to be bathed in. Seriously, I detested mayonnaise in all forms before eating this stuff, and still do detest mayonnaise unless it is this stuff. It's that good. The CB&J is worth all of the googol of calories it contains; the bread is deliciously buttery, and the fillings (cashew butter, fig jam, and smoked gouda) compliment one another like a tripartite version of the yin/yang. As if it wanted for decadence, the sandwich is served with Stilton Mac and Cheese. The Montreal style brisket melts in your mouth while still retaining its meatiness and is well-seasoned (and is probably best ordered in platter form, as the bread simply cannot stand up to its juicy excellence). All specials I have ordered (fried smelts and rabbit stew are two that leap to mind) have been spectacular. As you can probably tell, this fare is not for the faint-of-heart, or faint-of-calories-in-diet, but if you're willing to splurge, it is well worth it. All in all, I have never had anything less than an excellent time at the Leaf, whether eating, drinking or both. This is a great place to come with groups of friends, or even on dates (provided you go during the week or early enough that it isn't packed yet). It deserves its reputation as the premier gastropub in Chicago. *I will say that other friends of mine have had bad bites here. I have heard that the Duck Reuben is unimpressive, although I can't stand cream cheese and thus have never ordered it. Nevertheless, I reserve my 5 star rating, as I personally have never experienced a bad bite of anything here",0.9955,0.845,0.138,0.018,0.5226406926406927

We were seated at 8:40pm... We put in an order pretty quickly. We ordered ""mussels for one"" (w/ the spicy Thai curry), a side order of Macaroni-n-Stilton Cheese, a Duck Reuben sammich, and a Toasted Nueske Ham sammich. The mussels came out in a timely manner. I took a fork full of what I thought were shredded veggies surrounding the mussels.  Bad move.  I found myself chewing on ginger. STRAIGHT UP GINGER. I played it off and just ate it. The mussels were good, and so was the curry broth. The two pieces of bread that came with it were hard as rocks. Hard enough to break windows. 10pm... Why are we still waiting for our dinner? You'd think making two sandwiches would be pretty quick. WRONG. And what about our mac'n'cheese? They forgot about us. The waiter asks us if everything is ok. I let him know we are waiting on our food. 10:15pm... The sandwiches come out.  They were tasty. Nothing to rave about. Our mac'n cheese came out a few minutes later. It tasted like it needed a dash of salt. Our waiter apologized for the delay. I can't imagine what it's like on a weekend night trying to have dinner.

Their beer menu tends to favor the Belgian and Belgian-style offerings. Nothing wrong with that, the Belgian's have been doing it and doing it well. The rest of their beer menu is well crafted with most styles being offered in some form and most countries being represented. I found the offering of German beers to be a little slim. However there are many other delicious beverages to try out. There is an impressive wall of glassware behind the right side of the bar. It is always nice to have a beer poured proper and into its designated glass ware that is usually crafted by the beer's manufacturer. My only real complaint was the lack of any sort of table server. It was a relatively busy mon/tues night as I'm sure a lot of nights are at Hopleaf. Still, having to order every single drink throughout the night from the bar, I also had to order food from the bartender. While the food was great, It felt odd being served such great offerings by the line chef out of the kitchen. After completing out meals, our plates just sat at our table for nearly half an hour.

The bartender gave me a free beer and got the sympathy/digits of a pretty girl at the bar. 2) My buddy who came with me to the bar noticed that his glass was chipped. When he told the first person who walked by our table (he happened to be the manager or something) about it our meal of mussles and frittes (amazing) and sausage plate were on the house. 3) I got blind drunk and lost my phone.

Sign up for Hopleaf's email updates via their website as soon as we're done here and fan them on Facebook. This way, you'll never miss a Hopleaf tasting again. Though I've been to Hopleaf close to two dozen times over the past several years, I hadn't yet experienced a tasting. Until last night. About a week ago, I saw a Facebook update announcing the Belgium-based St Martin's debut in Chicago, including an invitation to attend (with RSVP) a free tasting with the brewery's owner/brewer and their importer. It mentioned food as well, but I had Hopleaf's mussels and frites on the brain and knew I'd be saving my appetite for them (and only them) following the tasting. On a bustling Monday night (there are no slow nights at Hopleaf, FYI) I grabbed a bar seat and got cozy with my new favorite Saison, Boulevard's Tank 7. My friend soon arrived and we hightailed it the tasting upstairs (the room filled up quickly; if you want to sit down it's advisable to arrive at the start time). After an introduction, we were invited to step up and try St Martin's blond ale in addition to the first food pairing: The mussels and frites, replete with their garlic aioli counterpart... talk about hitting the foodie jackpot! These mussels are undeniably the best (tried-and-true) mussels in the city. Second up: St Martin's Tripel (move over La Fin du Monde!) and a green salad which brought out the hidden peppery notes in the beer. We finished with the brewery's pride and joy, the Brune. Like other Brunes, you can really smell the date and fig sweetness but that's where the semblance ends. The brewer, Marc-Antoine, explained that he doesn't add any sugar to this beer and that's why the finish is incredibly clean. FANTASTIC. Did I mention this entire experience was complimentary? I'm now extra-inspired to visit Belgium and all her beautiful breweries... Marc-Antoine was so affable and quick to answer our questions. His offer to personally tour the brewery with me + friends should I come visit was genuine and heartfelt. Thank you Hopleaf, Marc-Antoine and importer Mark for the start of an unforgettable evening... of course, we finished downstairs at the bar with a tasting of our own!

When we were ready to settle up the bartender ran my friends card.  Unbeknown-st to my friend that the tab would be so high, we then VERY  apologetically asked if we might have the transaction voided so that we could pay half with cash and then re-ring the card for the other half.  He grunted and nodded yes to our request.  Somehow however after voiding the first transaction and trying to re-swipe the card, my friends card was declined.  Of course this news was upsetting and surprising as well.  I have worked in the industry for quite sometime now and it's been my experience that once a transaction is voided it is just that.  At this point I tried questioning the bartender as to why something like that might happen, to which his response was ""call your bank""  shrugged his shoulders and walked away.  The fucker could give a shit and it truly set me off.     I then said to him that I just found it ""strange"" that something like that would happen.  To which he gave a sarcastic laugh and said ""yeah strange"".    Now I'm not one to want someone to kiss my ass in ANY situation, but COME ON...have a little sympathy and understanding for the situation.  Here i am trying to figure this out and this guys being a total heartless piece of shit.  I decided to ask the bouncer for a manager, to which he responded that there ""really wasn't a manager"".  Oh really???  No manager ha?  yeah I fucking bet.  I'll sum this up by saying that I will NEVER return to this elitist shithole ever again.  If I want an amazing  selection of beer and great food I'll try one of the 50 million other gastro-pubs  swarming the city.",0.9914,0.751,0.163,0.086,0.49971306471306465

On my last visit, one of them was Spicy Thai Curry (sweet potato, jalepeno, cilantro & lime). Our waitress recommended those, and we loved 'em. They come with a mountain of frites... we loved them.  Also... the CB&J (cashew butter & fig jam, with raclette cheese on grilled sourdough) has to be tasted to be believed. Served with their mac n cheese, these two dishes were enough to satisfy two hungry people (along with a couple choices off the beer list).",0.9839,0.808,0.192,0.0,0.5925925925925926

Most of the dishes can be a bit on the greasy side, but in a buttery excellence way. I really liked their sweet breads.

Both were packed, but we found room in the bar area upstairs (which is cash only). Prices were relatively reasonable, perhaps a smidge high, but for the quantity of quality choices they have available, I can't complain. I would like to go back and try dinner sometime, but the bar suited our purposes perfectly for that night. I got to try a Goose Island Bourbon County (draft), a St. Bernardus Abt 12 (bottle), and a 3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze (bottle, $$$). Bar staff is knowledgeable and friendly, the latter of which was a pleasant surprise considering how busy they were.

I had been here once before for a beer or 3 and had a great time but had never had a meal and was excited to try it out.  Upon entry we shuffled through the first floor and up to what I assumed was the only other space, my oh my, was I wrong.  The hostess gave us a daunting 1 hour wait time (totally assumed we'd have something close to that with a group of 5 on a Saturday night) and suggested that we go upstairs for a seat to wait.  This is a gem! They have a fantastic waiting area on the top floor with a cash  bar so you can get your evening started comfortably while you wait.  The beer list is intimidating amazing.  I was lame and got something I always get while others were a bit more adventuresome.  Next thing you know time flies and we're being called for dinner!  Onion rings are light and a great starter.  The duck Ruben is finger licking good as was the crispy asparagus.  The frits are a treat and definitely give frits in Brussels a run for their Euro.  All of that said, it wasn't perfect.  2 sour notes: 1) after an hour wait I was looking forward to sitting at a table and being able to talk and relax.  However they put us at a table that was so close to another table that we were encroaching on their space and vice versa.  Thus we were sandwiched so tightly together that eating proved to be a solid challenge.  There wasn't enough room on the table for all of our food and if someone sneezed at the next table it would have been all over me and my food. Not cool.  Big groups need bigger space.  Putting 5 people for dinner at a table usually meant for 3 just doesn't work.  2) Our waiter, while I understand he's a ""too cool for school"" hipster and such could have been just been nicer.  I get it that it's Saturday night and it's busy, we've all been there.  But the way to guarantee a happy table is be nice and fake patience even if you aren't.  Curt, short and fleeting doesn't bode well for a good tip.  Despite the tight fit and tighter lipped server, I'll be back.

On that visit, they seemed a bit rude and pretentious, but a friend who lives near this place and frequents it wanted me to give it a try again, he said it's changed. Plus, it was just a quick walk from where we'd all eaten dinner at.  The place was packed upon our arrival around 9:30 pm. I expected that though, it seems to be a pretty well-known place, it was Saturday night, and it's not a huge place. For about the first hour we were there, it was standing-room only, basically being in everyone's way and trying to squeeze yourself in the corner by the first-floor bathroom. Then my clever Chicago friend cooked up a story and scored a bench opposite a sympathetic couple who was sitting together on one side of a booth with the other bench to their booth butt-less. Eventually they left, and we all had a seat.  I don't recall seeing any wait staff serving drinks to any tables. All of my beers were being decided upon, ordered by, and brought by, my beer-loving company. As noted in many previous reviews, I wouldn't know a good beer if it bit me in the taste-buds, but what was chosen for me tasted great.

2011-04-18,5.0,"OK world, you win (I'm happy to say). I was cautiously optimistic about Hopleaf going into the experience. I love gastropubs, and I love Belgian beers, so this had promise to become one of my favorites. I just hoped the hype wasn't empty here. Needless to say, it was not. My wife and I got there at around 4:15 (we heard the wait could get brutal later) and snagged a table right away. Parking wasn't an issue at that time either which was nice. Our server was real friendly and as attentive as she could be, but she was the only server in the whole back of the restaurant so she was pretty swamped. I would think they should have two servers back there to make sure everyone can get beers quickly, but that might have been a fluke of the night. The food and beer took any issue with the service and kicked it to the curb. We started with Sweet Potato Latkes with Chives. They were fantastic, and the little bits of baked spiced apple as garnish really complimented the flavors.  My wife got the CB & J (way better than I thought it would be) with mac and cheese, and holy crap was it tasty (As long as you're cool with blue cheeses). My duck reuben was so good, but the frites and aioli (which is spicy with loads of garlic) were just as memorable, which doesn't happen often. To go with the food, the beer selection is fantastic. Hopleaf focuses on Belgians (great to match with the cuisine), but there are plenty of American craft options as well. You'll be able to get some great beers to go with the tasty food.

My husband and I arrived at 4:15 on a Saturday and there were only 2 or 3 tables left! We started off with the sweet potato and fennel latkes. This appetizer comes with 4 latkes, and they are heavy and delicious. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, with a little chew. The spices are balanced and give a little zip. There are small, diced pieces of apple, which pair nicely with the latkes. Too much creme fraiche, but you can just skim it off. For dinner, my husband had the duck reuben with frites and I had the CB&J which comes with pub chips and mac and cheese. Both of our entrees were reasonably priced, large, creative and delicious. The CB&J is a fig jam and cashew butter sandwich with melted cheese and sourdough bread. Its amazing - must try! The pub chips are nice and crispy, lightly seasoned, and the mac and cheese is made with a blue cheese or possibly Stilton. Delicious as well. My husband's duck reuben was incredible, and it came with a heap of delicious frites. For dessert, we had the banana fool dessert. Banana pudding, homemade vanilla wafers, peanut butter mousse.

WTF was I thinking? Anyway, yesterday brought a rare moment of happiness as I had a most awesome DUCK reuben along with an incredible glass of Dark Horse Blueberry Stout after chatting up the owner and friendly bartenders on St. Paddy's Day. The reuben is a slow-roasted Pekin duck with cranberry sauce, house-made sauerkraut, emmenthaler cheese on toasted marble rye.  Honestly, I can't recall having duck this tender in a very long time.  You can tell someone spent a fair bit of time putting together this masterpiece of a rich sandwich. They are respected for their extensive beers, but I had no idea that Hopleaf had so much duck on the menu and look forward to putting it all to the test. -- Update: went back the next day to try the duck meatballs. Wasn't impressed. The meat tasted like a so-so blend of turkey and soy.  Would never have guessed that it was duck as there was nothing gamey tasting present. There was a bit of hot spice there, but something was missing. The risotto cake was nice.  Would be nice if they somehow incorporated the sauce comes with the fries into this dish for a bit more zest. However, I sat next to and met Julie who ordered the CB&J and she said it was excellent. Sean ordered the mussels and they were quite tasty, seasoned well with garlic.

Service all around was excellent and a model of how any business who serves the public should be. We sat at the bar and it was so cool how others around us were friendly and kind. I can't describe it other than it was a feeling of community that seems to be lacking in other bars I have been to.  Although Hopleaf is known as a beer bar (with an excellent selection), they do have cocktails and a nice selection of eclectic liquors to choose from.

We skipped appetizers as nothing looked particularly appealing and moved directly to two orders of Mussels for two.  Mussels are my latest obsession and these did not disappoint.  I will say, however, that the mussels offered at Logan Square's Revolution Brewing we far more fresh and the sauce much more nuanced in flavor.  Nonetheless, I ate to my hearts content. By the end of the meal I could sense that the restaurant was getting busy.  During a trip to the restroom I caught word of a purported two hour wait.  By the time I returned, our service had completely stopped.  Our server was within earshot as we all discussed which beer we'd like next but we were never offered a second pour.  The message from the wait staff was loud and clear: we'd like you out of here.  I can understand that given that kind of wait they want to turn the tables over as quickly as possible, but we were willing to keep ordering and build up the check - what gives?  We passed on getting a second drink (I had already tried everything on the draft menu anyway) but decided to get desert - they had some fantastic-sounding options.  I had the apple cake and our guests had the mousse.  The apple cake was completely unacceptable.  Dry layers of bland cake stacked between globs of sour delicata squash and marshmallow-esque cream cheese filling with burnt brittle served on the side.  If they weren't so busy, I may have sent it back. Overall: a good experience, good ambiance, but please: if your wait time is any longer than 30 minutes, it's time you leave the north side and find a better less-hyped restaurant.",0.9743,0.84,0.116,0.044,0.4893557422969188

2011-02-05,3.0,"The day I showed my old boss the ""Stuff White People Like"" site was a Red. Letter. Day. in his life. For nearly two hours he sat hunched over at his desk, crying with laughter and reading some passages aloud. The one that really stuck with him was the one about expensive sandwiches. Specifically the line: ""Also note: white people will wait up to 40 minutes for a good sandwich."" Actually, go read that particular post. Google it, it's hilarious. I'll wait. ... So tonight, I met up with my friend at The Hopleaf for drinks and dinner because SHE did not totally lose her mind and space out when she was supposed to buy tickets to Wye Oak/Decemberists like a certain writer of this Yelp review that I could mention. And when I got there - literally, the minute my ass hit the seat of the barstool - a steak arrived for her - all covered with some kind of herbed butter and smelling like steaky heaven and magic on top of some fries that were absorbing all the steak juice and...it was a lovely lovely thing. It took me a good ten minutes AFTER her steak had been dropped off for me to flag down the bartender to order a beer and a sandwich. Specifically, some badass 9% ABV Belgian wonderbeer and a goddamned DUCK REUBEN. Here's how the menu describes it: Served on marble rye; Pekin duck breast, slow-roasted, w/cranberry cream cheese spread, house-made sauerkraut, emmenthaler, pommes frites DUCK REUBEN. MAGIC BELGIAN BEER. THANK YOU HOPLEAF. Except I end up waiting for about 40 minutes for my DUCK REUBEN. In the meantime, my friend has to get her ass to the show and has already polished off her steak and is graciously letting my starving ass pick at her fries (which are full of steak juice) because it has been 40 MINUTES and my sandwich has not yet been assembled. Nor has anyone come by to check on...anything. The guys behind the bar at Hopleaf? Were in the zone. And that zone was not a helpful zone. Or a paying attention to the ENTIRE BAR and not just one part zone. And I KNOW it's easy to focus on one chunk of people and accidentally forget about everyone else, but after a minute or two you snap out of it, ONLY THESE GUYS NEVER DID. At one point I was holding my empty glass up by my face and staring them down and being patently ignored for 20 minute stretches. I'm not a high-maintenance patron but this is one of those things you learn in Serving 101 - if food is going to take a long time, let the customers know and keep their beers full in the meantime. It keeps them happy (read: drunk) and it keeps them from straining their neck to look every time the kitchen door opens. My empty beer and the fact that we were totally ignored by the staff and the fact that a sandwich seriously took 40 minutes just make me sad because I LIKE the Hopleaf.

I visited Hopleaf at approximately 9pm for dinner on a Saturday night.  We were told that it would be about 30-45 minutes before we could be seated, and, while I wasn't timing it, I am pretty sure it was about 20 minutes, max.  Before dinner, we sat at the upstairs bar area.  It's a small spot, but I really liked the atmosphere.  While this is definitely a beer bar, they did have some nice wine selections as well. We were seated downstairs - in the back along the windows.  While I could have done without the slight draft from the window (it is winter, so I won't complain!), I thought the spot was great.  The fun beer signs and exposed brick make for a casual atmosphere, but a fun one.  The tables are separated enough so that you don't feel crowded (and luckily, are far enough apart so that when I dropped a glass, it didn't fall onto the next table!...so embarrassing!).   The food was wonderful.  We started with the mussels (for 1 - definitely enough for 2 people!) with the chorizo.  Delicious!  I could have used a bit more bread to sop up all of the delicious-ness at the bottom of the bowl.   I had the CB&J - YUM, YUM, YUM.  I could eat this again and again.  However, I could barely finish my plate after the mussels and fries!  I thought the mac and cheese accompanyment was good, but mine was a bit salty on the crust.  I also tasted the brisket entree - very good, but definitely more of a meal for St. Patty's day.  All of the other entrees that were floating around being served to other tables looked delicious as well.  I wanted to try almost everything on the menu.   Everything was great - I would definitely visit again - perhaps knowing that I can order less food and still be stuffed!",0.9978,0.772,0.217,0.012,0.5776797385620915

They also have a vast wine list, and I still love that you can order bottles of Normandy cider here (one of my favorite things to consume, but difficult to find in a store sometimes let alone a restaurant). The place can be pretty crowded and at times standing room only, but it never really feels like a crowded bar even so.  I think the mellow, chill, and responsible crowd really helps that.  They don't take reservations, which personally I think is good because I rarely plan that far ahead... but that might mean you have to wait 30-60 minutes for a table too.  But you can drink at the bar while doing so. The food here is at least reliable, and often very good even.  Of course their specialty is the mussels.  I like the Montreal style smoked meat too.  On my last visit I had a braised venison with braised cabbage and beans.  Personally I think the dish was cooked at too high of a temp too quickly, as it was a little tough and wasn't very ""braised"" ... Nothing on the plate was overwhelming or all that flavorful, it was really just OK across the board, and it was one of the most expensive things on the menu.

2010-12-19,4.0,"There's not much not to like about Hopleaf. Now that I've got that double-negative intro out of the way, I'll get to the details.  In a nutshell, the main appeal of Hopleaf is the variety of their high-quality craft brews they have on tap.  Great IPAs, Stouts, Ales, all that good stuff.  Additionally, they also have a unique and tasty dinner menu as well.  The fact that they have quail on the menu really sold me on this place, as it is very hard to find and always hits the spot.  They also make a damn good briskett entree too, which I indulged in last night.  I usually pass up briskett when I see it b/c there's usually ribs to choose from, but since Hopleaf doesn't serve ribs, I went the briskett route and was not disappointed.  Made me forget how much I miss briskett. For those of you who are not carnivores, they also make a very good CB&J sandwich, which is my girlfriends favorite, and according to her, one of the best sandwiches ever made.  It seems to be a customer favorite as well. You, the Yelp reader, may have also read reviews about Hopleaf that it is usually incredibly crowded and damn difficult to get a table if you show up during peek hours.  I am not here to dispell those rumors, but I do have a bit of advice.  If you don't want to wait 1 hour+ for a table, and 10 min+ to order a drink from the bar, then don't show up at 7:00 on a Fri or Sat night.  It's like Yogi once said: ""nobody's goes there, it's too crowded"".  I learned my lesson the first time I showed up at 7:00 on a Sat night, and waited damn near 2 hours for a table.  Since then, I haven't shown up after 6:00 for dinner, and as a result, I've never had to wait for a table.  Nothing wrong with an early dinner every once and while, especially if the incentive is great food/beer in a cool atmosphere.",0.9656,0.805,0.12,0.075,0.5852884615384617

2010-12-15,3.0,"I got to try this place out this past Sunday night during my visit to Chicago. I briefly considered giving them only 3 stars for this review because the hostess' bad attitude really bothered me and almost spoiled my dinner experience there (see bottom of review, downgraded to 3 stars now). Although we asked her in a very respectful manner, she made no secret of the fact that she was extremely annoyed by our request to move to the table right next to us where some people were about to leave (we asked right after sitting down, because our table was right by the hallway and there was a cold draft that was very uncomfortable). She then actually made us get up and wait in the front area. In the meantime, the first table we were sitting at remained empty the whole time we were standing up waiting and there were no people waiting to be seated so there really didn't  even seem to be a point to making us get up in the first place. When we came in, there was no warm welcome, when we left she looked our way as we walked right past but there was not even a simple ""Thank you"" or ""Have a good night"" from her. Unlike her, the bouncer by the front entrance actually had the class and business smarts to thank us for coming.   But in all fairness, the cozy dining room, friendly waitress, great food and impressive selection of beers still need to be rewarded with a decent rating. I don't recall the name of the Belgian style beer I had but it was very good. We tried the Latkes appetizer - very good.  As an entree I had the rabbit stewed in beer with small dumplings, onions, carrots etc, which I liked quite a bit. I also got to try somebody's CB&J sandwich (on sourdough with cashew butter and fig jam), which I thought was good but wouldn't necessarily order myself. Somebody else at our table had the Braised Venison Ribs - didn't try them myself but the person who ordered them said they were very good. In conclusion, I would return to this place for dinner or to try some more of their excellent beers but if I encountered another similar unwelcoming experience upon arrival as with the hostess that night, I would prefer to spend my $$ elsewhere. A follow-up (1/29/11): After writing this Yelp review, I went to the restaurant's website and emailed it to them along with a very polite message that I simply wanted to make them aware of the issue with the hostess that night. I received an automated ""Thank you for your comment. We will get back to you as soon as possible in regards to your message"" email. But it's now 6 weeks later and I never actually received a reply from anyone. That, along with remembering the fact that I hate it when employees of an establishment where I go to spend my money have any kind of an attitude with me, the paying customer, just cost them a star.

Bartenders never believe me on this, either, since I'm not the stereotypical beer-drinker (read: bearded, burly dude). Hopleaf's taps are *always* fresh. The combination of consistent quality plus a very interesting, ever-changing beer list makes for unrivaled educational boozing.  The food is fabulous, too. Prices are a little steep in the absolute sense, but you get a really amazing meal for what you pay. Their menu has elements of Belgian, French and New American cuisine. It's interesting yet simple, wholesome, and tasty. That said, you have to be strategic when coming here due to the crowds. On Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, show up on the early side even if you're just drinking (6-7). You may still need ninja-esque skills to grab a table, even this early, but it's likely you'll grab one before too long. They'll serve food to the bar area, but if you want to eat in the restaurant (it's nicer) on a Thurs.-Saturday, put your name down by 6:00 or you could easily be waiting until 10:00. The Map Room is the only place that rivals Hopleaf in terms of beer selection and tap beer quality, and it's plagued by the same crazy crowds. The Map Room is a little cheaper, but it's smaller (even harder to get a seat) and they don't serve food.",0.9607,0.886,0.097,0.017,0.5340246090246091

This cozy and perpetually busy place sits in my mind somewhere between an old European pub and a warm ski lodge. The vibe can't be beat, especially when the snow is falling and you find yourself at the bar chatting it up with a fellow beer snob barkeep when the crowds are down early in the day. The beer list is formidable as you might expect and heavy on Belgian varieties. Not to worry if you're more into domestic craft brew as they have that covered in spades. This was the first place I knew of to have draft Great Lakes available quite a few years ago and was the first place I tried Surly Furious back when they were distributing in Chicago. So you'll likely be able to try quite a few beers here that you haven't yet found elsewhere in the city. Menu options are somewhat limited, but I've always found that the food was very good. The steamed mussels and frites with aioli are standouts and most everyone would likely tell you the same. The mussels here are easily among the top two or three I've had in the city and will certainly satisfy. The only downside is the popularity of this place.

We put an order in with the bartender who then forgot about us for about 10 minutes--but then he remembered he had forgotten us and comped us our two beers. Nice--we really appreciated that, especially since the place was slammed. We were seated for dinner upstairs on the catwalk area of the restaurant. It was a nice corner spot with a view. The waitress was attentive even though she was very busy. She recommended a pumpkin beer to our friend who was pondering it and let her know she'd take it back if she wasn't a fan--also, very nice. We appreciated the friendly service.  Our food was good, though nothing to write home about. We had the mussels for two in the Belgian ale. The mussels were solid, even if the broth was a bit oversalted. With the frites and garlic mayo, it was plenty of food for us both for $21. Nevertheless, it was a smallish pot of mussels, I thought, for $21. And the frites were well-flavored, but pretty soggy. I'm used to the overload of mussels and crisp frites we used to get at our favorite Belgian spots in DC, where we used to live.

2010-09-14,2.0,"We got to Hopleaf around 6 PM on Saturday and were lucky enough to get one of the last tables available in the bar area. The place was packed, with all the few wooden booths taken up along with the wall. However, food apparently is not served out in the bar area so we had to get in line to put our names on the waiting list for the dining area. We were told the wait was between 35-45 minutes. While we waited for one more in our party, drinks were ordered. The environment seemed pretty fun, a mix of patrons at this place, ranging from young hipsters to older, Europeans. The small wooden tables were very close together and it was quite dark. It was rather quaint, and it did feel like a bar one might find in Belgium, complete with an intricate, tin roof. The bar looked to be fully stocked with impressive amounts of unique beer.  I was amused by the different shapes and sizes of the beers being consumed all around; a woman drank a beer out of what looked like one of those round-bottom chemistry flasks complete with a wooden holder, while others sipped from big beer mugs and some from miniature wine glasses. You actually had to go up to the bar to order drinks, but despite the crowd, it didn't take too long to get a drink. After almost an hour, we were summoned back to the dining area where we were seated at large, wooden table next to the fire place. The brick interior was very inviting and the metal, tiled ceiling was pretty neat too - giving this part of the bar a much more warm, modern feel. There were also sky lights up above and we could look out and see what appeared to be a nice patio dining area (which would have been nice to eat at were it not 60 degrees in the middle of summer!). We got our menus and two things caught my eye: (1) very few (and bizarre) food choices and (2) expensive given the venue. I kept re-reading the menu, as if I stared at it long enough something a little more bar-food like would appear, but to no avail. This food seemed fit for a Viking, not a boring, picky eater like me. I was happy to see something familiar, so I ordered the onion rings as an appetizer for us to share, but I was in for a surprise. These should be more accurately named onion 'strings'. The strings were very greasy and brittle; it made for some messy eating. They were served with a side of spicy mustard, but trying to dip the brittle pieces into this didn't work. Numerous times we asked ourselves if there was a ""proper"" way to eat these things. I was not feeling brave enough to order any of the mussels or the rabbit stew, so I went for what looked safest on the menu and ordered the Montreal-style Brisket sandwich on rye with the ""frites"". Our meals finally arrived after a long wait, and at this point I was starving. I took a bite of the sandwich and it immediately fell apart, so I resorted to eating the brisket with a fork. Parts of the brisket were very fatty and the flavor was pretty bland; I didn't taste any of this so called ""Montreal rub"" that was supposed to flavor this. Some parts of the meat looked undercooked in some areas too which made me not want to eat it at all. The bread was also pretty stale. Fortunately others at the table didn't mind this and ate my leftovers.  The fries were very good- thin and crispy- but there was apparently no ketchup at this place! I guess this is a good thing for the 'purists' out there, but it just made my meal a little more dreadful. At least I had about 5 times the recommended serving size of fries on my plate, so I got pretty full of those. At this point though I wasn't very happy that I'd basically paid $12 for an order of fries with no ketchup. I really think food is an afterthought at this place, so I'll chalk my bad food experience up to that since I think first and foremost this place is a BAR. The ambiance was fun and seems like it would be a neat place to hang out for some drinks, but I will definitely not be heading back here to eat anytime soon. The egregious wait time, coupled with the limited, strange, and bland food definitely makes me not a fan.",0.9973,0.815,0.137,0.048,0.496376573617953

But then we squirmed our way to the back, and saw that a couple tables were available. The hostess made certain we were aware that in order to sit back there, we'd have to order food. Hey, no problem, you don't have to twist my arm with that!  Honestly, even though I'd read the reviews, I was still a little surprised that this place came off as slightly trendy and upscale.

Thankfully, upon scanning the menu, I saw that I wouldn't be paying Vail-style prices. OK, bring on the beer! Here, I strayed from my drink-local focus for my trip, as several beers were available on tap that I'd had out of bottles before, but had never before seen on draft. My theme was ""Beer from Coast to Coast."" I started out with Lost Abbey's Devotion, an excellent Belgian-style golden ale out of S. Cal that to me tastes of tangerine, allspice and cinnamon. I followed that up with Calabaza Blanca from Jolly Pumpkin, Michigan's premier brewer of sour, barrel-aged Belgian-style beers. I capped my beer exploits with Sah'tea from Dogfish Head, probably my favorite East Coast brewer.  Oh wait, we ordered food, didn't we? Indeed - the brisket sandwich on pumpernickel was outstanding. The pink slices of smoky beef were mouthwatering, and the spicy mustard and fresh-tasting bread only served to amplify the beef's flavor profile. Portion size was ample, a common theme in all the Chicago restaurants I visited. The service was attentive and friendly. Apparently, the bartenders here have a bit of a reputation for being pretentious dicks, but back in the dining area we experienced none of that. Pretty cool place.

Anyway, poor guy gets rushed all over the restaurant and therefore, it was not his fault that the food took forever and drinks took EVEN LONGER THAN FOREVER. We are talking 10 minutes into eating our food, and then our beers arrive. The beer menu is fabulous, though.  I had the steak frites ($22) and the steak was OK. Very grisly and definitely not the best I ever had. The onion rings are very small, but good. The Duck Rueben was HORRIBLE and tasteless, No flavor at all.  Tasted like eating cardboard.

2010-07-02,4.0,"The first thing I ever heard about this place was how amazing their beer selection was. And seriously, it's amazing. But I will get to that later. I came here with 9 or so other friends. We were celebrating a friend's birthday, and we had to wait until 8 of us had gotten there to be seated. When we were up to 7 people, they let us sit down anyway, which was nice. The wait staff was very accommodating and very friendly, so that was an immediate plus.  Here's what we ordered: -2 orders of CB&J (cheese, cashew butter, and fig jam on sourdough served with chips and mac&cheese) -2 orders of the brisket sandwich (served with fries and mac&cheese) -brisket platter (served with mac&cheese and cole slaw) -3 orders of mussels (served with pomme frites) -onion rings -baked beans & house salad -tilapia sandwich -soup of the day (which was gazpacho) I ordered a CB&J and it was a taste I had never tasted before. The sandwich itself was perfectly crisp, and the cashew butter was insanely nutty and good. The fig jam is what made the sandwich, and I am ambivalent about the cheese. The mac&cheese was great, and the chips were okay, too.  As for the beers, we all ordered a smorgasbord of beers, and I don't even remember the names of half of them. A lot of them were stouts, and I think someone might have ordered lambic. They have so many beers on tap and so many more in bottles. They have a lot of Goose Island beers, Bell's beers... even more rare beers and beers with insanely high alcohol content. If you want Miller Lite, go elsewhere. I had a half pint of Sierra Nevada's XXX 30th anniversary special and it was super hoppy and really great.  The atmosphere is good, and they have outdoor seating. We didn't have to wait too long for a table because we were the only huge group dining in, but the wait times for smaller tables could have been long. It is hard to tell. But I think the best rule is to go early.  4 stars because I am saving that last star for the Duck Reuben and also because this place is a bit of a trek.",0.9845,0.885,0.107,0.008,0.5366757369614512

2010-06-27,1.0,"I honestly hate this place. Let me preface this by saying...I love beer.  I love Belgian beer.  I love the beers on their beer menu.  I like food.  I love going out to eat.  I live in the city, and love the area where Hopleaf is located....but I hate this place.  I really do. So, here's my experience.  It's my friend's birthday and he wanted to meet us at Hopleaf, since he lives in Andersonville.  We get there and get in about 2 minutes before them.  When we check in with the hostess, my wife and I say ""There are going to be four of us"".  She says ""is everyone in your party here?"" (I realize this is standard), and I say no, but they're right behind us.  By the way, there were tables available for us(???) but they couldn't seat us.  Okay, fine, I understand.  So, we ask if there is availability on the patio.  She says there's a different list for the patio so my wife decides to see how long the wait is out there, while I wait for the other two people in our party to arrive.  In stroll three guys who say ""table for four"".  She says ""is everyone here?""  They say, ""the fourth is coming"".  She takes the THREE to their table for four.  Okay, now I'm a little bit annoyed, but I didn't say anything...we're here to have fun.  Then our two friends arrive and the hostess says ""okay, I can take your name now"".   I'm like, huh??  We already gave you our name, but apparently she didn't even take our name because our WHOLE party wasn't there.  That was just weird.  Back to square one. Soooooo....we end up deciding to head out to the patio to eat.  The patio hostess said we could hang out on the patio and have drinks while we waited for a table.  Cool!  So, I head in to the bar to buy beer for the four of us with one of my friends.  The bartender gives me a surly look, but I say  ""Hi....so, what's the Allagash White like?"".  I figure, since it's a ""beer"" place, the bartenders would like talking about  beer and know the beers they have on tap.  Plus it wasn't super busy.  He says ""It's a wheat beer"".  I guess I should have figured that but I didn't so, I said.....we'll, okay, I'll have the Rouge, which was a beer on tap (the big red tap with ROUGE in big letters).  The bartender looked at me like I was some sort of idiot until I pointed to the tap.  Then he says ""if you don't like Allagash White, you won't like that""....to which I said, ""oh..is it a wheat beer too?  And he said ""NO"".  No explanation, no anything.  Then looked at me like I'm an idiot again.  So I said I'll try it.  He fills it up and kinda slams it on the bar and says ""Six Fifty"".  Okay, I'm not done ordering.  so I say, ""Aaaannd.....do you have lemonade?  ""NO"".  Do you have any other sort of citrus like drink (which is what my wife wanted)?  ""NO"" (still glaring, GLARING at me).  So, my friend kinda sees that this guy is kinda weird, so she steps in and says says ""just give me an Oberon"" which he goes to get, slams it down on the bar and tersely says ""$12.50"", then glares at me.  OKAY......AAAND  could I also get a Delirium Tremens?  He goes and grabs it, slams it down on the table and says ""19.50"" (then looks at me like I'm an idiot).   I was actually floored.  WTF just happened?  I don't get it.  What kind of way is that to treat a patron of your restaurant? I seriously wanted to climb over the bar and punch the guy in the face.  I've never come across such a jackass of a bartender or waiter in my 17 years in Chicago.   Since I couldn't get a lemonade for my wife, she went inside to the bar to get a drink. while the rest of us waited on the patio for our name to come up to be seated. My wife was inside for a long time because she said the bartenders were ignoring the 5 or so people trying to order drinks at the bar. The waitress then goes to get my wife and asked if she had bought a beer at the bar yet. My wife replied no, and the waitress said that our table was ready outside so she could just order one there. So my wife comes back to the patio and then we wait for the waitress to come back out to show us to our table. Then the waitress comes out and says she's so sorry, but she thought my wife was someone else and our table is in fact not ready. The waitress said, ""Well, I asked if your name was Amanda."" My wife said, ""No, you asked if I had ordered a beer yet."" Obviously, my wife's name is not Amanda and would have never said yes to that question.  The rest of the evening was OKAY.  The funny thing is, the food was actually pretty good.  The beer list is great, but the other thing we had to put up with is the passive aggressive correcting on the names of the (by design) obscure Belgian beer list.  That's just annoying. On the way home I said to my wife that it must be a culture that they cultivate there.  That's the only explanation for the hostile behavior of the staff.  It's weird.  I just won't spend my money at a place like that again.  There are just WAY too many great places to eat in the city of Chicago.",0.9935,0.815,0.113,0.072,0.5188832199546485

2010-06-27,4.0,"Let me preface this review with a simple platitude: If beer isn't your thing, look elsewhere. That being said, I happily report I hate beer. Confused? Don't be, read on! To celebrate the birthday of my best friend's wife (who is also my good friend) we celebrated at the Hopleaf. Given that my best friend and his wife are beer connoisseurs to the max. Walking down the microbrew aisle with these too is akin to ""done it. done it. meh. had it. yum. done it. etc."" ... So, suffice to say they were jazzed to go to the Hopleaf given it's amazingly deep beer menu.  I myself am not a lover of beer at all. Luckily the Hopleaf did have other fine drinks to peruse. Since I like lambic (wild fermented fruity beer) and hard ciders, I was happy to see ""Original Sin"", a granny smith hard cider from across the pond. And for 5 bucks I felt like i was getting a deal. Some of the beers on the menu tip the wallet over 10 dollars a glass. For the hops aficionado... I take it that this may be a pittance to pay for the experience. But enough with the drinks. Suffice to say: there's plenty of choice, and the staff is both knowledgeable and helpful (so I was told, more on that later.). The menu itself isn't large, but everything on it says ""upscale"". The prices however are truly a deal all things considered. The table started with the sausage plate for an appetizer. While it was only large enough to grant each person at the table 1 large finger sized sausage, and a pair of potatoes (""german"" hot potato salad made with fingerlings)... The flavor was excellent. My sausage was well cooked, had a nice bite and snap to it, and provided homemade whole grain mustard was hot, but well made. The potatoes were simply amazing. I'd go back for JUST that salad, honestly. Tossed in apple cider vinegar, garlic, and bacon. At 12 bucks, it was a tad overpriced, albeit amazing to eat. Entrees, entrees, entrees. My best friend had a brisket sandwich. His wife and my wife both settled on the Duck Reuben. The brisket was tender, and well seasoned. The duck reuben was well received, albeit my wife wasn't the biggest fan of the house made sauerkraut, nor the marbled rye it came on. All the sandwiches came with a mound of hot pomme frites served with house made aioili. I myself opted for the ""House Specialty"" Mussels. For 12 dollars I received a heaping bowl full of truly tender, perfectly cooked bivalves in a Belgium style broth. Steamed in an Wittekerke white ale w/ sliced shallots, celery, thyme & bayleaf... the broth while a tad salty, could almost be eaten by itself. Combine that with a cone of hot frites, and a pair of crusty house made rolls... and you have a truly wonderful meal. While I was warned by my best friend ""Mussels are no entree"" ... he was wrong in this case. Suffice to say, between lapping up the broth, polishing off the pile of mussels, and soaking the rolls up... I was very satisfied. And for the money? Can't be beat. A few more beers later, and the table was ready for dessert. Each of us tried something different (for obvious sharing later)... apple fritters, a stout laden chocolate mousse, a petite lemon tart, and honey profiteroles with wine soaked berries were ordered. At 8 dollars a pop, once MIGHT say they were a bit over priced, but at that point, full of beer, frittes, and good food, we could have cared less. The fritters were ample, hot, and delicious. The mousse had a beautiful dark and bitter undertone from the stout. The lemon curd in the tart was perfect while the pastry shell lacked finesse... and the goat-cheese stuffed cream puffs were just a tad too much on the tart side.  Our server wasn't necessarily attentive. It was almost as if he were trying harder to be a patron than a waiter. Several times whilst we tried to flag him down, I'd noted he probably needed to save his strength for his band's debut at the double door. The laughter at the table made it easier to forget that our server was more enthused to look like everyone else (""That perfect mix of yuppy, preppy, and hipster"") than wow us with service.  All that being said, let me make it clear: The food is amazing, and fresh. It's well paired and cooked with the abundance of booze within their storerooms. The drink selection is staggering. The prices for the food may offset your expensive beer tastings... and ultimately, we'll be back to sample more offerings in due time.

Yes, my bad for returning---but my ale-loving friends fell for your nonsense. Fast forward to present day. Been a while and I see you've picked up some mad game.

Your CB&J sandwich with side of stilton mac n cheese (yo!) is a crowd pleaser and would keep even the prudiest of food prudes loyal.

The mains weren't nearly as memorable, but that might be due to the numerous high ABV beers I'd had.

I was a little surprised by the overly-foodie menu.  Don't get me wrong, I love new food combinations and flavors, but sometimes you want a simple option to fall back on...Hopleaf doesn't have it, and the sides are $6 so there's not much consolation there that you can support your meal with a tasty familiar side if you don't like your entree. I got a brisket sandwich, and it was nothing to write home about (or finish).  They offered rye or sourdough, and brought me what seemed to be pumpernickel.  Yes, I realize pumpernickel is a subset of rye, but it wasn't something I wanted.  There was plenty of piecemeal brisket between the slices, and NOTHING else.  Call me picky, but if I'm paying $12 for a sandwich, I'd like it to have some fixins.  And I'd also like a $12 that's easy to eat...not falling all over my plate. At the end of the day it wasn't disgusting, but it was a pretty bland meal.  The only thing on my plate that had any flavor was...brisket.  The fries were potatoey and forgettable, and all else I had was bread, brisket, and a pickle.  I was expecting something a little more varied, a little more exciting.  What I got was a bbq leftover sandwich.  OK for a brown bag lunch, not something I want served up at a restaurant.

The Hopleaf ain't that place anymore.  I haven't spent any money there since about 2008, but I've tried to go back a few times.  Last time, I was told that there would be a ***SIX HOUR WAIT*** for a table.  What's up with that? Not worth the effort, crowds, and attitude.  Beer list is still good, but, thanks largely to the influence of the Hopleaf, many other bars have started carrying decent selections of Belgian beers.  So there's that, at least. Hopleaf has some tough business issues that they should confront if they care about their long-term patrons.  Are you still a bar, or are you an elite dining establishment like Alinea?  You can't be a *BAR* if there's never space for your patrons.  And you can't be *FINE DINING* if your customers have to elbow through a crowd to get to the restaurant.

A word to the wise though. I am not necessarily a light weight (I will admit that I have become a cheaper date the older I get) but every time I go here we usually have to wait an hour and a half to get a table. I am easy going and enjoy sitting at the bar, and I anticipate it so it is not a problem. The thing is that I get pretty tipsy (OK a little drunk maybe) by the time that I sit down for dinner. Poor planning on my part considering that I choose beers that are 10% and probably hadn't eaten since noon. Something to keep in mind though.  Just to give a little more info about the food - the mussels are awesome! loved the sauce they come in. I once ordered the lobster sauce mussels that were a special and regretted it, not as good.  Appetizers - the sausage plate was good but I don't remember thinking it was amazing, it was sausage, what can I say? I did love the quail, fabulous.  Entrees - I love the steak frites, one time I ordered the brisket and that was good too, but the steak frites is really nice. The steak is so big that I am able to take half of it home and use it on a salad the next day which is a bonus.  Side story - last December when I was here my date and I were seated in the balcony section, I was sitting with my back to the bars that overlook the rest of the diners below. I want to say ahead that I wasn't super drunk, but as I mentioned earlier I had had a few drinks without eating and it was pretty late at night. Well, the server brings me my steak, I pick up the knife and it slips out of my hand - hits the floor - and bounces OFF the balcony.

Whatever happened to the customer is always right? After he implied that we made the whole thing up, we got up and left, and went to La Fonda where we had a great meal with outstanding service.

An impromptu visit on Valentine's Day (Kuma's is CLOSED on Vday, FYI...rockers need lovin' too, apparently) proved quite unexpectedly lovely. Frankly, the crowds generally keep me away from Hopleaf, but our recent visit was beyond pleasant.  An hour wait for a dinner table, not so bad on a bustling Sunday night. Slipped into a front window table (by the bar) just as another party was being seated, and enjoyed 2 rounds of beers while watching freezing passerby on Clark Street. 16 percent alcohol later (2, 8% beers) I was floating above the vday chaos of broken dreams (not my own, thankyouverymuch) and buzzin' happily to the upper deck for a sweetly simple dinner with my favorite male dining companion. Oh gush, whatever. It was Valentine's Day, I'll allow it.

Thus my love of the Map Room, and my slightly less, but still strong love for The Hopleaf.  Their beer menu is the stuff dreams are made of - if you can't find a good beer here, you clearly don't like beer. During a recent visit, I tried the Tyranena Rocky's Revenge, but the reason I love this place so much is that it is the ONLY bar I've found in the city of Chicago to offer the Lost Abbey Angel's Share, my absolute favorite beer of all time. That's reason enough to return.  When I come back however, I'm probably not going to opt for dinner to accompany my drinking. This place is a bar, and it seems like they're shooting for the stars with a menu that is a bit too grey poupon to match the ambience of the place. While their efforts are well intentioned, the food is mostly subpar. I had the cauliflower salad (pretty good), and the duck (eeeeeehhhh) when I was there.

But that's just fine with me.  The crowd was laid back and the music low and jazzy (at least tonight).  We didn't have to wait for a table for dinner - which is rare at Hopleaf. The food and drink are the stars here -- oh, and one certain staff member resembling Clark Gable who was SUPER entertaining and accommodating! You know who you are. It must be said that all the staff seem to know their stuff and the service was great. You have to go to the bar and order your food/drinks if you are sitting in the front but it comes out promptly.  I SURE did have a few Belgians here. This is no place to order a Bud Light. Hopleaf =  BEER! The selection will dazzle you. If you're a novice there are good descriptions on the menu but the bartenders will steer you the right direction too. My favorite tonight was the Delirum Tremens. Pink Elephants on the goblet.. heh.. heh.. This beer has a high alcohol content (if you can't tell from the name).  We started with 2 orders of mussels. They offer traditional Belgian style and a special of the night. We had the Belgian and the special which was a lobster and white wine broth.. I like!!  I have been hesitant about ordering mussels since reading Anthony Bourdain's ""Kitchen Confidential"" so this is the only place I will still order them. They are excellent. They are served with perfect pomme frites and mayo. The broth is divine nectar and resting on top of each order is crusty bread for soaking it up. After reading all the previous reviews I had to try the C B & J, served on sourdough w/ cashew butter, fig jam and morbier cheese. It's a fancy grilled cheese basically and it's obvious it could be a great sandwich but  tonight mine was a bit too greasy and seemed like it sat too long before serving - the cheese was hard to find as if it got too hot and oozed out of the sandwich or into the bread. Why has nobody thought of this combo before? It makes so much sense. I confess I have put peanut butter on grilled cheese b4. Is that weird?? The stilton mac & cheese that comes with it... OH. My, God. YES! But wowee this is a rich, filling plate of food & they don't skimp on portions. Good thing I worked out today and didn't eat much till dinner!! One of my companions had the red cabbage salad. It was really flavorful, crunchy and surprisingly tasty - with bits of apple, goat cheese and pistachio. I liked it much more than I thought I would. I'd order it next time.  This is a comfortable neighborhood spot. They do what they do - very well and Clark Gable Rocks!!",0.998,0.809,0.172,0.019,0.5412111111111112

Oh, hopleaf, how you complete me!  You're savory dishes, lively patrons, and belgium beers fill my soul!   [cough cough] - oh geez, sorry, I got carried away by the fantastic-ness of this place located in the Andersonville area.  Hopleaf bar is truly a gem of the northside. They are one of the few bars in the city (and in the Midwest) that carry all still functioning Belgium Trappist beers in the world. And their beer list is HUGE and they have over 20 taps to choose everyday for great prices! Beers cost between $5 and $8 (on tap) depending on style and make. It's not super cheap, but it's in the ""affordable"" range for a HIGH quality brew from somewhere in the world. Let me tell you about the food. You MUST have the mussels and fries. For just $12, you get about 14 mussels, big piece of fresh bread, and a whopping larger cone of Belgium fries.  Quite frankly, this is an amazing deal and prolly the best mussel deal in the city. This is more than enough for 1 person dinner or lunch. I like to eat all of the mussels with the bread and then drink the sauce like a soup simply because it is THAT good. Trust me on this, do the mussels. Great bargain for great quality. The other food on the menu consists of sandwiches and entrees which are a bit on the high-end price, although I've heard that they are nothing short of amazing.  I'd avoid coming here on the weekends with a group (if you must on a weekend, only bring a max of two other people or be prepared to wait for way over an hour for a table).

I like coming here late Sunday afternoon with the husband, sitting in the bar at the front (at one of the tables), drinking great beer, and eating/sharing mussels for  two with him. Good jazz music in the background, good beer, good food---who cares if it's a bit dark and collegey and the bar has many regulars---I'm with my true love sharing mussels and beer! The back dining room is good too. We went there once with the daughters for dinner (either a Mothers Day or a Fathers Day dinner) once.  I liked it too.  I had the most delicious enormous diver scallops!  It's possible to order saugsages, and other things at Hopleaf, but I don't return for those things. My love affair with the Hopleaf began and continues due to the mussels and the beer selections! The service in the bar area---you get a seat someplace after showing your id to the guy at the door, then you go to the bar & order your beer & get a menu.  Then you go back to your table.  When you're ready to order food or more beer you go back to the bar and order from the bartender.  If you order food, it will be brought to you by someone later.  If you want to run a tab, you must leave your credit card with the bartender.

Besides the fabulous selection of import beers where I was introduced to and fell in love with Delirium Tremens (goblet of Belgian, strong blonde ale with excellent balance of sweet & dry for $7), it's also a great place to catch up with old friends. Yes, it's a small place, but there's difference between small & crowded versus small & intimate. Definitely the latter. A great place with the perfect ambiance for interventions and political debates...or even just to exchange day-to-day adventures. My friend tried the Mead the last time I was there, which they serve in double-shot glass. I tried it...and wanted to throw up. It wasn't really my style. Extremely thick with a really strong cinnamon flavor. But I did enjoy the fact that they offered it! Scored me 2 personal adventure points for trying.   Another time I tried the CB&J (house-made cashew butter, fig jam & morbier cheese on super-buttery, pan-fried, sour-dough bread) which was served with Stilton mac & cheese and house-made potato chips. The sandwich, was interesting. I loved every ingredient inside of it...I just wasn't sure if I liked them all together. It was too confusing, I practically had to stuff down the half I was eating. The mac & cheese was a little too bland, and potato chips were too salty. I'm still not very sure if I enjoyed that $10 meal, but I loved the fact I had the guts to try it. Definitely a place to be when you want to try new things. As Patricia Alexander once said: ""Fear paralyzes. Curiosity empowers.

It was like a two for one of beer excitement. They also have DT if you're looking to get shwasted on someone else's tab. On a side note, I'd suggest they try and add something from Surly to their list (surly furious, maybe?), just to increase the awesome quotient. The upstairs bartender was great too, he was quick, friendly, and witty. And he put up with the big group I was in with no problems. And they let one of our friends nap for thirty minutes without getting booted. He was rallying, ok? Started early. Gosh.

Onto the bar, the ambiance was quite nice.  Lots of people, eating, drinking, and being merry.  The food was above par.  We split the brandade (cod puree with potatoes and garlic); it might not sound appealing, but it was divine!  A perfect salty snack! I got the mussels with lobster-fennel-broth.  Wasn't too pleased with that.  The mussels were too small, so I didn't get much.  However, the frites served with aioli were spot-on for me (a little soggy to my liking!).  My two friends enjoyed the duck reuben sandwiches, and everyone raved about the Stilton mac & cheese.

We tried to order drinks from the bar upstairs which is much smaller than the bar downstairs and was met by an extremely rude bartender (number 1) -- since the bar has many beers, we asked for a recommendation.  The bartender proceeded to point to the board and grunted ""this is what we have"".  After replying ""So, there's nothing you would recommend for someones first time here"" he replying ""Are you stupid, the beer list is right here, do you want something or not!?!"".   After that, we tried going downstairs thinking that maybe this bartender was just having a bad night.  Here we were greeted by a female bartender who must have been having the same bad day as the first one.  We were ordering beers for our whole table (since the waiter refused to speak to us and actually walked around our tables to serve food and drinks to the other tables) so we again asked if there was a ""beer they would recommend, perhaps a good pale ale"".  The bartender sighed, picked up a menu and literally threw in at my friends face and walked away.   Finally, after picking a beer and ordering enough for our table we were drinking (though no longer in a very friendly mood).  For the next hour we were very obviously glared at by the busboy and waiter as we tried to put the earlier slights behind us.  Then, at midnight we were informed we had to get up because the kitchen was now closed (though we weren't able to order food for the last hour) and we couldn't sit in the ""upper dining room"" anymore.  We had to go back to the main bar area, which was very crowded and had no room to sit down.   Needless to say, we gladly obliged and proceeded to go somewhere else, anywhere else...   Though I'm sure a place like this doesn't really care about serving people and repeat customers (they must not if they encourage this behavior) for the first time in a long time I can say ""never again"" to this place - which is unfortunate given their beer list and promising atmosphere.",-0.55,0.849,0.074,0.077,0.48735852311939254

While they may not provide the bulk of their beers on draft, what little they lack in drafts they make up for with their wide selection of bottled beers.  Where else in the city can you score a kriek lambic, a Corsendonk ale, and mead?  And, to be fair, the beers that they do have on draft fairly represent the seriously fearless brew-masters of our own proud nation and of those abroad (namely Belgium--sweet, sweet Belgium).   But don't let the ""Bar"" in the name steer you away from a solid Hopleaf meal!  They've got the wherewith all to sate your hankering for some ridonkulously well-paired beer-drinking fare with (my personal favorite) moules frites/mussels and fries served with a decadently rich garlic aoli.  Mmmm...or the Sausage Plate appetizer--super hearty and perfect alongside a German beer.  Yes.  I am drooling as I type.  However, I wouldn't attempt anything adventurous there.  I was sorely disappointed with their squash flower appetizers (a special for the season).  Something like $14-16 for three measly, and unimpressive flowers.   A fantastic reason to check it out: having your beer served in the glassware that was made especially for the beer you've selected is quite the treat.   The only downside: this fancy-schmancy beer place will burn a massive hole in your sad little wallet.  The Hopleaf provides quality and expects us to pay for it.  How could they!!!  In a perfect world I would be paid to drink beer and not the other way around.  Alas, at the Hopleaf one must shell out some serious cash to drink more than one beer.  But, really, isn't it worth it?

My friend started out with the famous Delirious Tremens (every other person seemed to be getting this), and that was a lighter beer, but that was good as well. Later on, I got the Leffe Blond- which wasn't as fruity, but definitely light and refreshing- reminded me of nature, for some reason. My friend got the Chimay beer- something made by a monk- but it was dark, sweet, and man, I liked it. Additionally, we got the mussels- where the flavor was REALLY good. We also got some frites- which was just the right amount of potato-ness with a great dipping sauce (kind of a zesty mayo)? The wait staff... was slow.

First off I know that I'm not the ""regular clientele"" that comes into Hopleaf, being that not I'm a hipster, but doesn't excuse horrible service. I was very excited to come to Hopleaf, mainly because the great Yelp reviews and the good word of mouth, but they changed my opinion of the bar very quickly.  We were put in the corner of the dining room, which by its self would be ok, no big deal, but with a bunch of other seats open and other two person groups (read, hipsters) getting great seats it was a little annoying to be put in the corner and out of the way. There was a group of four gentlemen that came in about five minutes after my girlfriend and I and they actually got their food before we ever received our drinks.  Once we were finally able to order (after more than 30 minutes of waiting without even ordering our drinks) we never saw the waitress again, she didn't even bring our food out or ask us if we were ok, until the very end to tell us the kitchen was now closed.  When the food finally came out, it was very greasy and mostly burnt. The fries looked nothing like the ones in the picture provided on Yelp, they were all burnt and I was only able to find about 8 of them that would even pass for edible. My sandwich, the Brisket Sandwich, was actually pretty good, in any other circumstance I would've been happy on it, but with the poor service, and the fact that everything else was either burnt to a crisp or grease soaked, the entire evening was ruined.  They waitress couldn't even get the check right, my girlfriend had to go give it to her so we could finally pay and leave, because after dropping it off she had to go flirt with the kitchen staff so was way to busy to let us pay and leave. I was very excited about going to The Hopleaf so my hopes may have been too high, but my girlfriend had never heard of it and she was just as disgusted as I was.

Since those that were with me were more adventurous than I was, I got to sample some different things though. The duck reuben is indeed delicious. While I love duck, I had my doubts about its pairing with sauerkraut. They blended very well though. It's something I would order in the future.  I was also a fan of their mac and cheese, although I think you either like it or really hate it. They use some weird type of cheese that was described to me as ""very strong, english blue cheese.""

Once our frites were cold but the server promply replaced them upon our drawing her attention to them. I wish their kitchen opened earlier at 3 instead of 5, but what can you do?

She seemed to have realized she was not being a good server about half way through our visit and became very nice - I think she was just overworked, and I felt bad for her- but all in all, it was an unfortunate experience. I'd like to go back on a less crowded night/at a less crowded time, and maybe it'll be better.",0.9353,0.726,0.16,0.114,0.5673523809523808

Be warned, however, the bar service can be surly and downright rude at times (the owner can be terse and impatient).  Be prepared to wait until a bartender is darned good and ready to serve you because you will probably have to wait a while.   You'll also have to deal with a crowd in the bar that makes it hard to enjoy a beer.  Best bet is to get to the bar as early as possible (if not at the open) to get a space.  You -will- be shoved around, bumped into and likely have beer spilled on you due to the fact that there are far too many tables and not enough space.  Making matters worse, if you're walking on the sidewalk the overflow crowd of smokers on the sidewalk tends to hover and makes passage difficult.

I didn't care too much for the grilled shrimp, it was literally just grilled shrimp and they only gave you three of them, not so good for a party of four!   Entree wise, I had the duck ruben - it was probably the BEST ruben I have ever had...funny that it is a duck ruben...but everything about this ruben is awesome.  From the bread that is perfectly toasted, yet still soft and buttery, to the thick juicy pieces of duck wedged in the swiss cheese that is melted just so, to the tangy tartness of the sauerkraunt, this ruben kicks butt!  I had the other half for leftovers today and I am sad that it is all gone.  Plus the ruben comes with MORE fries and that yummy garlicy aoli sauce.  My friend had the trout, I had a bite of it and that was really fresh and well done.  Trout is hard to prepare in a restaurant and Hopleaf managed to pull it off.  It was not dry at all, and you could taste how fresh it was, the combination of the cold curry cucumber salad coupled with the hot tender trout was soo yummy!  I only wish that hopleaf was closer to my place and didn't require such a long wait, but hey it is totally worth it!",0.9973,0.773,0.183,0.045,0.5206101190476191

Being constantly surrounded by vino, its nice to give your wallet and brain a rest and go for the more approachable suds. What better place to do that than the Hopleaf?

Hands down, the best selection of the stuff in Chicago. I pride myself on trying something different every time I go, and I have been a lot. However, the last time I went, I went for literally, The Champagne of Beer. No, not Miller High Life. Malhuer, methode champainoise Dark Brut. A $45 bottle of 12% deliciousness that is so balanced, you will have no idea you are getting loaded until you have finished the 750ml bottle (so much for giving the wallet a break!)

The Abt has a very fruity flavour. Hop Hop Hop To The Hopleaf!",0.9835,0.845,0.12,0.035,0.5491049382716049

But, at the end of the night, even my cranky parents were saying that the wait was worth it! The beers are great and will make any type of beer drinker happy.  I wasn't too impressed by the wines by the glass, but that serves me for even looking at a wine list in a beer place. The food:  mussels (we had both kinds) were fab!  I'm partial to the spicyness of the Thai ones, but most people like the classic Belgian style.   Frites were perfect - especially with mayo w/ a hint of spice.   The duck trio was yummy, so all you pate lovers out there: come here!   I had the salad w/ crab which I didn't love - again probably not what I should have ordered at a place like this. Everyone else had sandwiches that they liked. Finally, the best part: the mac and STILTON cheese.  If you like yours with more flavor and less oozy cheese (I find the neon orange stuff gross), then this is your mac and cheese!",0.9942,0.718,0.232,0.05,0.5833333333333334

The Great:  The beer selection on tap was glorious. I'd love to just sit in Hopleaf all day and try each beer choice. I had the Barbar and it was sweet but not obnoxious.  My boyfriend ordered mussels and they were perfectly flavored and  the surprisingly light coconut curry broth made for delicious bread dippings.  The exposed brick of the back room lent itself to a lovely atmosphere. The service was just right - not cheesily chatty while managing not to feel cold.  The Not-so-Great: We were seated only after our whole group got there even though 5 out of our group of 7 was there.  While the appetizers came out really quickly, the food itself took about 45 minutes. This wouldn't have been an issue if we weren't ravenous by the time we'd arrived.

The brisket sandwich, the grilled fig jam, almond butter and cheese sandwich, the seasonal stews, I can't say enough about how exceptional it's all been. The only let down was the steak and fries, which was still average.  The service has always been solid. Not overly friendly, but always professional and on the ball.  And the beer selection. My god. It's on the level with Map Room and then some. The servers and bartenders are always ready to recommend.

I first came to this place because I heard they had a good beer selection, and on that count they definitely do not disappoint. They have an extensive selection of beers on draft and in bottles, with an emphasis on Belgian and Belgian-style beers. I've consumed my fair share of beers from around the world, but I don't think I've even heard of half of the beers on their list. The food is also spectacular. They don't have much seating in the dining areas, so waits are usually pretty brutal. Get there early to minimize your wait. As many others have mentioned, the CB&J sandwich is practically life-changing. It's my favorite item that they have on a regular basis, but many of their other items are also fantastic. The Stilton mac & cheese is quite good if you like blue cheese. I also have once had a lamb stew that was cooked in Brother Thelonious beer - this was unbelievably delicious, and it really hit the spot in the middle of winter. Hopefully, they keep this recipe around. The only food item I didn't enjoy was the steak (why did I get a steak and frites at a Belgian bistro-style place?

2009-07-05,1.0,"Can I please have three hours of my life back? I feel like this place stole a piece of my soul and the terrible servers/hostesses are feeding off of it to sustain their miserable existences. NEGATIVE A BILLION STARS.  The door guy: The door guy totally tricked me. Other reviews state how he's terribly rude, but he was actually nice to me. He made me believe that the rest of the staff would be like him. Wrong. Thanks door guy, you were the highlight of my dismal night.  The hostess: She had a really terrible and painful looking sunburn, which is why I'm guessing she sucked and was rude. My colleague/ the birthday boy asked for a table, to which her response was ""Ugh... it's going to be a while- maybe a few hours, I don't know."" Confused, we returned to the table, where we were having beers, and assumed she was having an off night. About 45 minutes later she came to seat us and noted that the small cake that we brought could not be eaten at the table, regardless of whether or not it was for a birthday. Hopleaf hates fun, true story.  THE EVIL SERVER WHO SHALL REMAIN NAMELESS: Oh my f'ing god Hopleaf, what do you do to these servers??? Are they paid? Are they fed? Do you lock them in the cellar at night and torture them? If not, then why WHY WHY was she the absolute worst person I think I've ever met (and believe me, I have met some truly awful people).  We thought at first that she was unable to hear the pitch of her own voice, because she was barking at our table ""DO YOU GUYS KNOW WHAT YOU WANT? DO YOU NEED ANOTHER BEER? OH, YOU GUY ALL HAVE FULL BEER GLASSES? UGH, I DON'T HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS, WHY DON'T YOU LOOK AT THE MENU AND FIGURE IT OUT?"" Um, ok, we just asked for water, psycho.  While we waited an hour for our food, we had to flag down the busboy to get our server so we could get more drinks... after 30 minutes of not knowing whether she took the rest of the night off or not, one person went to the bar and ordered herself a drink. BIG MISTAKE, THAT'S A TONGUE LASHING FROM THE SERVER. We literally got reprimanded by the server, because we were impatient. Apparently 30 minutes isn't that long to wait for your server to check on you. Weird.  So, my friend leaves the table to smoke outside, and while gone, I explain to our server that I understand their food policy and ask if there was anything that could be done to acknowledge our friend's birthday (a specialty dessert or drink....). She explains to me that they are an ""ADULT"" restaurant, and at some point, adults stop celebrating their birthdays-- and that we should try that. I explain to her that it's actually very important to him for personal reasons that he's even here able to celebrate, and she continues telling me that as an ADULT ESTABLISHMENT, they don't do trivial things like acknowledge (not sing, just SAY) happy birthday and will not, under any circumstances, allow us to do so. OK, I get it-- the seven adults sitting at the table are not adult enough for Hopleaf. Hopleaf absolutely hates fun.  Instead of just leaving it at that, she then tries to use an anecdote in case I was confused about the simple sentences spewing from her mouth. She explained that she doesn't come into the Gap (where she assumes I work) and try to sell Express jeans. She then goes on to say that if we want cake that bad, we can go to one of our apartments and eat it. WTF. No, no you did not just talk to me that way you f'ing psycho. I told her that she was being rude and should stop speaking to me immediately, but the batshit crazy lady continued, and repeated the SAME EXACT ANECDOTE. I told her that I was not a child and that I understood simple English without the use of anecdotes and that she was being extremely rude and should stop talking to me. We're not talking about my friend having cake anymore, you are now personally attacking me on several levels (pointing in my face, saying ""I don't know where YOU work, but if I went to the Gap..."", raising her voice, assuming my class/work/living status, etc.) and will not stop talking to me after asking her several times to stop (with patrons from other tables just staring). Oh, and if you MUST use anecdotes to get your point across, at least use them correctly.  She doesn't return to our table for the rest of the night, but has one of the bartenders bring up our check. Really? Are you THAT immature and unprofessional? I guess so. After we pay (oh, and she added a very generous tip for herself) the hostess brings back our receipt. You have to be kidding me. I really don't understand how a business can employ people who yell at their customers, point in their faces, insult them, disrupt other customers at neighboring tables, and act generally unprofessional and uncourteous. I have never been treated so terribly at a restaurant in my entire life. Hopleaf is by the far the single worst dining experience I have ever had, all because of this lousy server.

I love everything about it.  I stumbled upon this bar when I was freshly 21 because of the proximity to my house and the beer.  The beer selection is the best in the city (something like over 250 beers), the food is fabulous, and the bar itself is beautiful.  And if there is a beer not on their list, you can request it, and odds are they will try it out.  You will not find any Miller or Bud here so if that is the kind of beer you drink-you are not wanted here.   I have been to Belgium a few times, and the Hopleaf could fit right into a neighborhood in Brussels. They specialize in Belgian food so you can expect to see things like mussels and frites (with amazing garlic aioli), rabbit, and a great steak.  You can also find a CB&J which is cashew butter and fig jam served with emmenthaler mac and cheese. Paired with a good Belgian triple and you are set for the night.  Seating in the front can be very difficult on busy nights, so pay attention to where certain tables are in their meal/drink.  Food is served everywhere but the back part of the bar is the dining room.  The hostess will seat you here, but again expect long waits thurs-sat, and they don't take reservations.  They just added on a charming back patio with six tables.  This is also first come first served, although I hope they will re-think this poor decision.   The only reason I did not give Hopleaf 5 stars is because the management is not the best it could be.  They seem to work fine if nothing goes wrong, but they do not know how to handle problems.",0.9845,0.821,0.143,0.036,0.5504535147392292

In addition to a fabulous beer selection, Hopleaf has wonderful food.  I had the CB&J - cashew butter, fig jam, and cheese pan-fried to a crusty deliciousness.  Sounds a little odd, but just try it - you'll like it.  Whatever you do, get the fries, they are perfection.

I was infomed that this is supposed to taste the way it does. To me, it smells and tastes rancid or like something that has ""turned"".

It was all really good, even though I'm not a huge fan of mussels. My only qualm with the meal is though I asked for more bread for the coconut-curry broth, they only brought out two little pieces. It's a shame all that yumminess went to waste and not in my mouth. Then came the most amazing dining experience I've had all month.

2009-04-10,5.0,"Like the other 4 bajillion reviews on here, I can attest that the Hopleaf is fantastic but crowded, has the best frites ever (more aioli, please!) and the upstairs bar is a refuge, albeit one with limited beer selection. So what can I say that hasn't been said? How about my Hopleaf Calendar O' Beer? A little guide to my own personal preferences when I imbibe at one of the best bars in the world. JANUARY: Kwak. What better way to start the year than ordering up my first Hopleaf love? Kwak was my first libation at the bar, and when it arrived in its famous mug, I knew I'd love it, if even just for the experience. Its beautiful amber body was the perfect Belgian introduction to the Hopleaf. I also quickly learned the lesson of what starts out sounding like a joke: What happens when you cross two Kwaks together? Answer: You get kwaked. Really kwaked. FEBRUARY: Maredsous Dubbel 8. Tones of chocolate and fruit? Sounds a bit like Valentine's Day, but this is a wonderful dark ale that warms and cheers me up when I've given up on my beautiful, but bitterly cold, city. Nothing like a Belgian ale to restore some faith in the world. MARCH: La Chouffe by Brasserie d'Achouffe La chouffe means ""the gnome,"" in case you didn't pick it up from the adorable logo. March is in like a lion and out like a lamb, but La Chouffe is just sweet the whole way down. It may be too sugary for some people, but for someone with a sweet tooth like me, this brew is fantastic. APRIL: Bell's Cherry Stout. Ah, April, the month of cherry blossoms. I celebrate by ordering my favorite Michigan brewery's cherry stout--sweet and bordering on tart, but with enough body to make me happy. MAY: Bourbon County Stout by Goose Island. At 10 bucks a pop, it's a bit pricy. But if I'm looking for bourbon-infused beer--which I am, often, and especially during Derby season--nothing satisfies like Goose Island's rare brew aged in oak bourbon barrels. I'm a fan of bourbon brown ales, which are easier to find in my Old Kentucky Home, but I'll happily settle for the stout here in the Windy City. JUNE: Atomium Premier Gran Cru by Van Steenberge When I'm upstairs at the ""secret"" bar, the Atomium is my go-to beer. I adore coriander and orange flavor in beer, so it's a perfect fit. The combination of zest and kick is perfect for the sun setting on a warm early summer evening. JULY: Lindemans Peche. Most people go for the cassis when they order Lindemans lambics, but currants aren't my style. On a hot day, nothing goes down cooler and sweeter than the peach sister of the Lindeman family. AUGUST: Hoegaarden. Call me boring, but as Hopleaf says, it's the original white beer. And I love it. SEPTEMBER: Witkap. As summer turns to fall, I attempt to kick my white beer habit with something a little different. Witkap's banana essence is what does it for me. This brew also makes me crave peanut butter and banana sandwiches stuffed in paper bags as the kids head back to school. OCTOBER: Nut Brown Ale by Samuel Smith Get things dark and roasty as fall comes on full force. Nothing too fancy, but definitely classic, and I always feel good sipping this brew and knowing this is the boyfriend's father's favorite beer. NOVEMBER: St. Bernardus Abt 12. Abbey beers make me happy, particularly the Abt 12 by St. Bernardus. The brown ale's richness is perfect for settling in next to the Hopleaf stove and warming up as fall settles itself into a long winter. DECEMBER: Three Floyd's Gumballhead While this American wheat beer is maybe a bit summery, Three Floyd's Gumballhead has the most wonderful aftertaste of pine that gets me going as the winter holidays approach. When I'm stringing up the Christmas lights, I order up a Gumballhead to satisfy my piney citrus cravings with this beer that finishes clean.",0.9997,0.721,0.267,0.011,0.5856855302507477

Yeeeeah, I should... but why do that when I can shamelessly use this weaksauce review as an opportunity to gain the next tick on my review-o-meter? Bwahhahaha!  So the things you already know:  * Hopleaf is a cozy tavern in the front and tasty restaurant in the back. It's sorta like the proverbial mullet of dining establishments.  * A fabulously smashing beer bar with yummy bottles and even yummier foamy drafts!  * Draft beer is on constant change which is actually a great thing. Find your new hoppy Belgium favorite a la my Bells Hopslam right here, just don't expect it to always make a repeat peformance.  * Staff knows their shit so don't order a Bud Light, Douchey McDoucherson.  * Super busy on weekends, not nearly as much on weeknights. A Wednesday night at Hopleaf with a Delirium Blonde and an actual blonde (ahem, me) by your side ain't at all a bad thing.  Some things you may not know:  * Hopleaf has righteous bar food; specialty white wine mussels, escargot, steak frites, even sweetbreads. Mozzarella sticks need not apply and will, in fact, be laughed out the door.  * They take their wine seriously. Not as seriously as the beer, natch, but the Hopleaf wine list is nothing short of impressive, albeit affordable. Not one bottle over $35. Huzzah!  * I tend to get absurdly drunk here. On beer. It goes down like mad dog. Who knew?  Take a trip to Hopleaf - like the rest of Chicago obviously has - and find out for yourself exactly how enjoyable a unique and fabulous cold one saddled up next to some Stilton mac 'n cheese truly can be!",0.9909,0.751,0.177,0.073,0.5077200577200578

2009-03-24,4.0,"Being an avid beer fan, Hopleaf is like an oasis in the chicago uptown area. The collection of drafts and Belgian specially, are something I have never seen anywhere else. My personal favorite over here is the Kwak beer which comes in a real fancy glass. My review is based on the drinks, food and the place in general: Drinks:  As mentioned earlier, Hopleaf hosts a variety of beers from the standard drafts to craftily brewed belgian ales. There are the usual whiskeys and scotchs' as well, but this place is mostly a beer place. Apart from Kwak (which is a must-have), I would also recommend Ommengang. Food: The menu is pretty limited but thats understandable that the place is more about the beer than the food. However, whatever's on the menu is fairly well-made. I would recommend the Mussels and the duck. The place: The only thing that leaves a lot to desire is the space available. Typical wait-periods for a dinner table on weekends can be from 45 mins to 2.5 hrs! The place is easily crowded due to its small size. The ambiance is very old-euro style with even the staff looking very european for some reason. Overall, its a great place to hang out with friends if you're looking to spend a couple of hours drinking beers.",0.9858,0.837,0.153,0.01,0.5169047619047621

What I liked: Beers a plentiful and if you didn't like a beer then you didn't choose the right one. I enjoyed my cider and mead offerings and my friend was happy with his beers. Food is a bit different but it comes out great. I had the brisket while my friend had the Duck reuben. Both were really tasty and came out perfect. Apple fritters for dessert ended the meal just right. Service was excellent ... the servers were friendly and always around to check on us There wasn't much to knock at with Hopleaf.

Denegrating a particular social group on Yelp by way of a bar review is the very definition of pathetic. That being said . . . the Hopleaf has been extremely packed lately. I know they are expanding next door, but if you came up to Andersonville just to go to the Hopleaf and you can't get a table don't worry, there is more than one bar in the neighborhood. The Edgewater Lounge and In Fine Spirits are good alternatives for great beer and tasty food, albeit with their own vibes. Symons, Farraguts and Charlie's all have a good beer selection too.

There is something for everyone and the staff is really knowledgeable. I always get the mussels because I have cravings for them on a regular basis. The ham and cheese sandwich is to die for and it's a sin not to get the fries with garlic mayo (which come with both dishes!)

I did admire the ease with which the kitchen turned out dishes, very fast, very efficient, high quality. I'm not sure why I want to hate this place.

The beer selection here is the best in the city.  Don't go expecting to get anything you have ever heard of, unless you often drink Chimay, Victory or Mead.  Every beer on tap is a new taste for your palate and they have like fifty beers on tap it seems.  In addition they have many more in the coolers.  You could literally go here every weekend for a whole year and not get the same beer twice. The food, I have heard, is good yet being I am a vegetarian I don't think I will try their rabbit or duck dishes any time soon, though if you dig on these I bet they taste great.  They do have vegetarian dishes, but honestly I go here to drink, not eat.  The only down side would be that it tends to get very crowded, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

However, the last two times we made the trip, the mussel were absolutely vile.  Horrible.  Unspeakably bad.  Unmitigated fish bait.  However you want to put it.  And the waits are longer than ever -- over an hour and a half on a weekend for a 2 person table (i.e. the easiest to seat).  The beer is still great, but I think it's cheaper to drink at the Map Room, and given our proximity to the Map Room we don't bother to make the trip anymore to Hopleaf.  After two bad experiences in a row with the food, we weren't about to take the time to go up there to wait forever only to have the same thing happen yet again. One of the owners is really nice (I haven't met his wife), and supportive of the beer community here.  I'm glad for them that the place is so popular.  But I can't in good faith recommend it to people anymore for anything other than drinking Belgian beers.  3 stars just for the beer selection alone and for their support of Drinking & Writing, among other things.

2009-02-04,5.0,"This is a great pub with a great atmosphere and wonderful beers and ales. I agree that it can get pretty loud, but it's a pub and people don't whisper in pubs. If you go with this in mind, you'll have a great time. When you take a look at the menu, you'll notice their specialty: Mussels for One & Mussels for Two. My wife and I have a ""mussels for your birthday"" tradition we started since we met 8 years ago and the mussels at The Hopleaf are by far the best we've had in town. The super plump & tasty mussels are offered in two broths-- a beer-based and a white wine-based. We've tried both and while i feel the white wine broth is my fave (with slivers of garlic and bacon) my wife prefers the beer-based broth (she's not into the smokey bacon flavor.) The mussels are served with frites that are cooked perfectly with great texture, crunch, just the right amount of salt and a little bowl of aioli that you can't get enough of. Other fares we're fond of are the escargot and the sausage platter. These are both appetizers that we've gotten when we've dropped by the HL for a quick drink and snack. If you've got a real sweet tooth (I'm more of a savory man mysself), I'd suggest you stay away from the desserts. That being said- I've also had the carrot cake and although it was odd to taste the Pere Jaques beer-based raisin sauce, I totally ""got"" it from the second bite on. Very rustic and organic. The beer list is one of the best I've yet to find in the city. Belgian, French, regional and national micro-brews will leave any discerning beer aficionado happy and any novice contemplating who the real king of beers should be.",0.9963,0.803,0.184,0.013,0.5554421768707484

They have a policy of not seating you until your entire party has arrived, so be sure to get there together!  The mussels were the best part of the evening by far.  We had them in white wine sauce, which was delicious when dipped in bread (be sure to ask for more bread).   I'll take the blame on the rest of the meal because I ordered the tilapia sandwich, even though I wanted the duck sandwich.  My friends had the brisket and CB&J sandwich and the brisket entree.  All of which were thoroughly enjoyed.  You may be wondering: why 3 stars then?   Well, I'll tell you: a fellow yelper wrote ""the staff is openly hostile to customers and the wait can be ridiculous at times"".  I am here to tell you, this statement is completely true!  Sunday evening at 6pm the wait was 45min (""luckily"" our entire party wasn't there, so we had to wait anyway) which is a little ridiculous.  And the waitstaff are the most oblivious, inconsiderate people I've experienced in some time.  I couldn't tell you my waitress's name because 1) she never introduced herself and 2) we saw her a total of 3 times throughout our meal. She appeared once for our drink order, once to get our meal order, and once at the end of the evening.  Had I not flagged down our busboy, I would not have had any condiments, extra bread, new plates, or gotten another drink order. And to cap it all off: after our table was cleared, we waited about 20minutes for our bill.  We finally grabbed our waitress's attention by making a scene and having my entire table stare at her while she chatted with the table next to us.  So, she walks over, places her hand on our table, leans in, and stares right back at us.  After what seemed like an eternity, my friend finally says ""can we have our check, please?""   She then stormed off, and had the hostess give us our check.  And that, my friends, was my terrible experience at Hopleaf.  I would give them 1 or 2 stars, but I feel bad that this waitress ruined my experience.  So its a pity-3 star rating.  next time, I'll stick to the Medici in hyde park.  It looks exactly the same as hopleaf but its in my 'hood, so I won't be as pissed about having a bad experience.",0.8005,0.846,0.089,0.066,0.591410344041923

2009-01-15,5.0,"This review is the first in a series of upcoming reviews I've been meaning to write for awhile. What can I say? I'm a little backlogged.  I've been here several times now and eaten twice. Great beer selection. Everyone knows that. I'm partial to pretty much any Trappist ale on the menu. Very limiting, I know. Expensive, too. But when you taste it, you know where your money went. I've never had anything to drink other than beer each time I've gone here, and doubt I ever will. With the selection they have, why bother?  A waitress who served us was especially helpful to one of my dining companions. He had just recovered from a very serious dietary tract ailment that required surgery and chemotherapy and was just given the all-clear to begin resuming a somewhat normal diet that could again include meat (but nothing red) and beer (but nothing dark). Given it was his first time here and the insane selection, he needed some assistance in making a choice to keep with his doctor's orders. The waitress was stellar and knew EVERYTHING on the menu that he asked about. He wound up having like 3 or 4 different beers off the menu with her help. Thank you, kind and knowledgeable waitress, for helping my friend have a great and healthy welcome-back-to-food meal!  First time I ate here, I had the venison meatloaf. Nicely seared and crusty on the outside, hot, moist and medium on the inside. Quintessential hearty cold-weather Midwestern comfort food.  The last meal I had here started with mussels. They gave us a monster plate of 'em and a big damn bucket to discard the shells into. You like fresh seafood? You like shellfish? You like butter? Good, you'll like their mussels. You've never had seafood for some reason? Maybe you're turned off by the consistency? No? Well, if your dining companions order some, try one. C'mon, just one. It won't hurt. In fact, it'll help.  My main course was leg of rabbit in a stew. This was the first time I had ever had rabbit. It's not bad, but I wasn't really a fan of the stew so much. It was creamy and full of vegetables, but a tad on the bland, if not gamey side. The rabbit meat was nice and lean and not bad, but I wasn't impressed enough to order it again. Still, it was nice to try something that I've not had before and will gladly give kudos to Hopleaf for carrying this.  Yes, this place can get ridiculously crowded. Luckily, both times I've eaten here, it wasn't. One was a weekday afternoon, the other, a weekend early evening. It's a little more expensive than I care to spend more than every great once in awhile, but I do need to eat here more often.

I must begin my review my stating that I am not a huge fan of beer.  I like a good cold one on occasion, but if I am trying to get my party on, there are other libations that do a better job of ringing my proverbial bell. That said, I am a fan of Hopleaf.  As beers go, I'd say that Belgian ones are the smoothest and tastiest.  It's great that the staff of Hopleaf is compassionate towards a beer novice.  All in all, the recommendations I've received have been eye-opening. What I most admire about Hopleaf is the food.  Sure, it's a bar, but they have some really great eats!  First off, the Belgian mussels are divine!  The mussels are always fresh.  The broth is heavenly -- warm and smooth with seasonings that compliment the mussels perfectly!  I could seriously eat them daily.  I LOVE mussels (as well as muscles, but that's a whole different story...). The duck breast Ruben is another good choice.  It sounds rather odd, but boy! is it tasty!  Perhaps it's a bit greasy, but it IS a grilled sandwich after all. The CB&J is another sinfully delicious choice.  Cashew butter and fig jam on grilled sourdough bread.  It satisfies the sweet/savory craving perfectly.  My only wish I could get it toasted rather than grilled.  Well, maybe I can -- I've never asked.

The biggest negative to Hopleaf is that it takes a ridiculous amount of time to get a table for ordering food, usually well over an hour. Plus, this is not the place to go if you just want a cheap burger. While they do have excellent shoe string fries and garlic aioli, the menu boasts entrees more along the lines of Belgian mussels, frog legs, and rabbit stew than cheeseburgers and slaw. I've had all of the above, and while the Belgian mussels were okay (I've had waaaaaaaay better mussels), the frog legs were greasy and tiny (what do you expect, right?), and the rabbit stew was just way too salty.

2008-12-14,5.0,"My friends took me to Hopleaf during my last visit to Chicago.  Actually, we were going to eat somewhere closer so we could walk, but those among us who were Chicago residents insisted on Hopleaf so hard that we decided it would be worth it to cram six of us into a tiny car and drive across town, with one passenger in the trunk.  In the end, their persistence was fully appreciated.   In short: this place is everything I want in a restaurant / bar.   The sandwiches are incredible.  Although I had heard good things about ""the best ham sandwich in town,"" I ordered the CBJ on a whim.  I could not have been more happy with this grown-up version of the peanut butter and jelly.  It was the perfect combination of sweet and savory, and surprisingly filling.  I was also lucky enough to sample both the beef brisket and ham sandwiches, which just made me want to order everything on the menu.   The beer selection is phenomenal.  I mean, I've been to Belgium, and I saw a larger selection of Belgian beers at Hopleaf than I did in the country of Belgium!  The beer menu descriptions were thorough and accurate.  Although I cannot remember the beers I tried by name, I was happy with them all. Hopleaf's interior is cozy and warm, with exposed brick and running fireplaces.  Although our server wasn't very attentive, everything was so good that I didn't even care; I figured she was probably just having an off night.   My only gripe is that Hopleaf is so far away from me!  I will be eating here every time I visit Chicago, that is for sure.",0.9948,0.787,0.19,0.023,0.6086685823754789
2008-12-13,3.0,"I was looking for a good, relatively casual restaurant in Andersonville and chose this one based on some of the reviews.  Was it a good choice?  Yes, definitely serviceable.  Was I bowled over by it?  Not particularly, especially with respect to the food.  But that could have been my fault on the choices I made. Summary: Sat down and our server asked us what we wanted to drink.  They had a ridiculously extensive beer list.  I told her I wanted something amber.  She then threw a couple more questions at me to try and narrow in on something I would like.  While this would probably have been helpful to some, I don't know that I think of other adjectives for beer other than color. So when I told her I didn't know my answer to some of her queries (kind of like when you go to the eye doctor and they are testing you for glasses and they ask which is better and they look essentially the same so you don't know what to say), she seemed a bit annoyed by my lack of beer knowledge.  She was like some kind of beer sommelier and my crude palate might have offended her.  Anyway, in the end she recommended something for me and when it came it was REALLY good.  So she was really good at her job!  Oh, and when my beer came it was this strange glass that was held in a wooden contraption.  Kind of like a test tube in a test tube holder because the glass was tall and skinny and wouldn't have stood up by itself.  I thought I was supposed to take the glass out and drink from it and then put it back in the holder to keep it from spilling but she informed me that I was to just grab the wooden handle of the contraption and lift the glass that way.  It felt a bit strange, but it did work.  I'll see if I can post a picture of the thing... When it comes to the food I was excited about the menu.  There were lots of things that sounded good that I wanted to try. We got an onion ring appetizer that was good but nothing extremely special.  We also got the mac and cheese which was excellent. For my main dish I got some sort of pork stew with golden raisins and gorganzola dumplings.  It sounded interesting and I rarely turn down dishes that involve raisins.  But in the end it wasn't very good.  I think the problem with this dish was the sauce.  Everything was completely submerged in this very thick and heavy brown sauce that covered up all of the subtle flavors in the dish.  The sauce needed to be much more subtle to allow the flavors to emerge. Service was fine, beer menu was great and our waitress was almost too knowledgeable about beers! And while my main dish was disappointing, there were enough other interesting looking dishes on the menu that I would probably give this place another try if I lived in Chicago.

I went for the first time yesterday (Monday night) and it was FABULOUS. I was skeptical going in because I generally don't like super noisey and crowded bars, but this place is CHARMING. We (4 people total) got there about 5:30 on a Monday night and there was plenty of seating to choose from. We decided to sit in the front room and just order our drinks and dinner at the bar, but you can always choose to be seated in the back and be served.  Ambiance - warm, inviting, and charming. I was just in Belgium last summer and this place definitely captured the atmosphere. It was wonderful!  Beer - YUM! I started with Goose Island's Bourbon County Stout (13%!). Elsewhere, I've seen this on the menu for up to 12 bucks, but it was only like 6.50 at the Hopleaf. I live in Wicker Park so I definitely noticed that all the beers were priced a few dollars cheaper than what I would normally see in my neighborhood. Hooray for that! (A side note about the cost- I paid for me and my bf and the bill was only 65 dollars for an appetizer (sausage platter, 12 dollars), an entree (14), a sandwich (12), and 5 craft beers. I was expecting it to be at least 100 bucks!) Foods - TOTALLY DELICIOUS. I had the duck rueban sandwich. It was deliciously rich and the perfect thing to be eating on a cold, rainy winter night. My sandwich came with their well known frites. It is pretty hard to mess up french fries so I'm not giving them too much credit for knowing how to fry a potato--but they did hit the spot. My BF got the brisket platter which came with the mac and cheese. YUM. My friend got the CB & J sandwich. TASTY. And my other friend got the mussels. YUM. Everyone was very, very happy with the food.  Transportation: The only draw back for this place for me is that it is kind of far from where I live. I hardly venture North of Addison so this was quite a jaunt. But, that being said, the Damen bus can drop you off RIGHT on the corner so it is still convenient.  Anyways, I would probably never go there on a Thurs, Friday, Saturday because I can imagine this place being ridiculously crowded and I would hate it. Also, If I ever go back I wouldn't want to get there later than 6ish because it certainly filled in and you know how I hate waiting for a seat.

I like to try unusual beers while I'm here, such as Kwak, which is served in a glass reminiscent of a chemistry set. The high alcohol content of a lot of these beers can certainly cause Jekyll-Hyde transformations if you go overboard, so enjoy in moderation. There can be an awful wait during prime hours. The upstairs is usually more open than the ground floor, and the bar up there still has a decent stock of beer. So if you're just coming for a few drinks, that might be the better option.

The heirloom tomato salad - with smoked cucumbers and haricot verts - that they used to have was delicious, as was the gazpacho that was a special one day.

Hopleaf is not consistent as far as food is concerned- I have had great steak, but also have had rouch not so great steak.. my friend always get the mussels -which can be excellent, but last time made him ill.  The food used to be top notch for a bar type place- but I'd say it depends on the night.  I haven't figured out when its outstanding. I miss those days!  The service is a big issue- in the restaurant area- we had spent 80 bucks eating- they were kicking people off the patio because it has to close at midnight- so instead of making sure we still had a place to sit and finish the expensive bottle we ordered- we were rushed inside- found a table upstairs which they said was also closed and to ""get out"".  If we paid all that money- we at least need a place to finish what we ordered - there was no seats in the bar.. that was pretty crappy.  We got the check of course and were being rushed to pay- but what about the fact that people were in the middle of a nice meal and  you have all these seats and are telling them they have to leave.  The waitstaff isn't exactly great- and we have seen confusion about seating- they don't really do a great job of checking in with you- but  that's not the big issue for me.   Another night- not too busy for a friday the bartender was kind of snippy for no reason- I guess that's common from what friends say- I'm sorry but for a 7$ beer if all you are doing is opening a bottle for me- be civil- you work for tips! I am not demanding or difficult.    I do like Hopleaf, but wish they would concentrate on good service, and consistent food.",0.9955,0.747,0.192,0.061,0.5822390572390572

Finish beer.     - ""Here, try the Maredsous""  (""not delicious, no thanks"")     - Grimbergen (dark, thick, tootsie roll minus the sweet) Leave happy, satisfied, a little loopy, past the throngs which have infiltrated the previously quiet, jazz-infused space. 7:30 is the bewitching hour, after that, your seat will be sniped as quickly as it can be, even if all you're trying to do is go to the loo.

One of our party of six asks the hostess how long it will be.  To which the hostess replies ""I don't even know.  Hours upon hours.""  Another of our party arrives, and not knowing that person one put her name in asks the hostess, and he gets the answer of 45 minutes.  I don't know how long it took, but the same hostess told two different people of the same party two extremely different answers.  Interesting. 2.  After waiting for not all that long, we're told our table is ready.  Excellent.  So we're pulling out chairs, sitting, and the hostess stops us.  ""Oh, wait.  This isn't your table.  Sorry, you guys are gonna have to go back to the front and wait.  We saved your table up there.""  Well, they didn't, because we gave it to some other people.  Incidentally, they sat us at that same table that wasn't ours 10 minutes later. 3.

The combination of flavors was pretty near revelatory. Nutty, sweet but not too sweet, and rich, it was the kind of sandwich that I would like to have as a life partner. It came with a side of Stilton. mac. and. cheese. If you are a fan of fancy mac and cheeses, you have to try it. I'd say it's better than a certain smoked gouda mac on North Ave. (sorry, Handlebar, but we'll always have the Radler) and equally as good, though utterly different than, Harmony Grill's amazing mac and cheese (that's saying a lot). The homemade potato chips are pretty good too. The whole thing isn't cheap -- $10 -- but the portion is very generous.

I wanted to try something unusual off the extensive beer menu, so I ordered the Framboise, a raspberry-based Belgian beer.  It tasted not unlike raspberry soda pop, but it went nicely with my grilled ham and gruyere sandwich.  The frites were great, and I wanted to bathe in the garlicy aioli dipping sauce.  But why put the coleslaw *on* the sandwich?  Does warm coleslaw sound appealing to you?  It's not, guys, leave it on the side.

2008-05-06,4.0,"I have been coming to the 'Leaf since before they had food, and were just a Belgian beer hall and the back room was non-smoking. It does hold a special place in my heart; I developed a taste for 'fruity Belgian ale' while living in The Netherlands, as well as Leffe, and was thrilled to find it in Chicago back in the day. Hop Leaf is a steady winner in so many areas: great European beers and ales, $5 pints of Dogfishhead 90 minute IPA on tap, moules et frites, and the dreamy CB&J served with a side of stilton mac n' cheese. I have tried on several occasions to recreate the CB&J at home--I even stewed my figs!--but nothing has come close to Hopleaf's. The only downfall with the sweet and savory sandwich is that it discourages the drinking of the Leaf's amazing Mustard Ale. Speaking of mustard, the sausage plate rivals anything you would find at Hot Doug's. Back to my favorite beer, it compliment and heighten your experience with the Nueske ham sandwich and the brisket sandwich, so never fear. Mmm...the Nueske; there's a reason TOC voted it the best thing they ate in 2006!   Perhaps Hopleaf is trying to compete with Lula for the longest wait and snottiest hostesses. My boyfriend and I know that a great dinner at the 'Leaf can be had earlier in the evening on a Sunday, say, around 6:00 and no later than 7:00, with minimal stress and irritation. Don't bother with the salads, which, while doused in tasty vinegrettes, are chinzy. The bar upstairs serves a minimal selection of drinks and doesn't have anything on tap (this might have changed), but is kind of a fun place to sit.

We walked a few blocks and arrived at our destination.  Since this was a pre-Check, Please! event, we didn't have to wait long.  But our wait wasn't that bad because we went upstairs and started drinking.  And then we came downstairs and started drinking.  And the we ordered food and started drinking.  And then we unbuckled our belts, leaned back and started drinking.  My friends stuck to the tried and true European goodies.  I like variety, so I wandered from old school European to classic Belgian to fruity cherry to smoky chocolate to  lagers to porters to ales to stouts.  It was exciting and intoxicating (*rimshot*) to experience such great beers.  Then we got in a cab, went to Lincoln Park and hit on college coeds.  Yeah.  Not one of my finer moments. Another not-so-fine-moment of pure gluttony at Hopleaf: the mussels.  I went there (again, pre-Check, Please!) with three other guys.  We ordered the mussels for two.  The waitress erroneously thought we needed two buckets.  No.  We needed four.  And sausage.  And cheese.  And lots of beer.  Just when I thought the evening couldn't get any more disgusting, two of my party DRANK the mussel bucket juice.  I was shocked and sickened into sobriety.  Surprisingly, one of them threw up.

I like a bar I can wear my pajamas to or jeans and a t shirt and not fear judgment. Sure, it's fun to get snazzed up every once in awhile. There are a lot of awful places I despise going to because it's a Coach purse parade, but at least those people KNOW and ADMIT they are trying very hard to acheive a certain appearance.  The general crowd on the night I was at Hopleaf reminded me of my former music theater self and were obviously checking out my hooded sweatshirt. Maybe they are sick and tired of people coming and ruining their favorite spot, and I understand that.  The patrons looked very smart and sophisticated though and I leaned closer to hear whatever book or indie movie they were discussing, but the girl with the bleached blond faux-hawk and leopard print shirt was discussing, ""how drunk"" she was the night before and how she ""puked on every surface of her apartment.""

When I finally made it to Hopleaf on Monday night for his birthday, I was definitely taken by the atmosphere and the blissful smokelessness of it all. The surrounding neighborhood, what seems like the fringe between Uptown and Edgewater, was shiny and clean, definitely an area I'd like to revisit on a warmer day. And even on a frigid night early in the week, the bar and restaurant were -- pardon the pun -- hopping, and I like that.

She recoiled for a moment but quickly recovered and offered a great recommendation. Snaps to her for grace under fire. All five of us, packed around our little four-top in the corner, really enjoyed our beer and the restaurant itself. We were well taken care of. Buuuuuut, snaps lost for really below-average food. Yes, the traditional mussels and frites with garlic aioli were delicious, but you'd BETTER not screw that up if you're a self-respecting Belgian alehouse, right?

On top of the encyclopedic beer selection, Hopleaf's food raises bar cuisine to a new level.  The mussels, served up in iron pots, swimming in garlic-y broth, served up with crusty bread and heavenly pommes frites, are better than you'll find in a high-falutin French bistro.  My most recent meal involved the ""CB&J"" - a grilled sandwich with cashew butter, fig jam, and morbier cheese.  While a bit unusual-sounding, it was an incredible sandwich, and the accompanying stilton macaroni and cheese and (again) those pommes frites put this meal over the top.

The Hopleaf does have a great selection of Belgian beers.  However, the Hopleaf takes me 45+ minutes travel time on the cta.  I live much closer to the Map Room, and I honestly think they have a comparable beer selection.  So, if I just want some tasty beers I'll hit up the Map Room.

My major complaints about this place are (1) that they don't serve Duvel in the correct glass, and (2) they are quite strange with certain requests...it was empty and freezing so we asked to move one table over to be closer to the fire, and they said no!  Not the hugest deal, but we all thought it was strange I will give them this - huge beer list and the servers really know the brews (and they are really good at making suggestions)",0.8838,0.754,0.146,0.099,0.5146428571428572

Many of the negative reviews on this page need to be addressed.  If you admittedly are not a fan of Belgian beer or food, don't complain when it turns out that it isn't your thing.  Second, if your review is completely based on the fact that Hopleaf is now too popular, giving it a low score just comes across as bitter. I understand that a crowded restaurant isn't always fun (most of the time it isn't), but Hopleaf is completely honest about this.  They start serving food at 5:00pm, and they don't take reservations.  Show up when it opens if you don't want to wait in the bar for a table.",0.7335,0.833,0.096,0.071,0.5411764705882354

I used to love coming to this place. 5, 6, 7 years ago? Believe it or not, there was a time when you could get a seat at a booth on a Friday or Saturday night. There was a time when the bartenders knew your name and your order or would take the time to recommend something. There was a time when the food wasn't hurried. There was a time when the Hopleaf was a quiet and quaint establishment like a local pub of the Belgian variety.  Now it's the kind of place where Lincoln Park professionals will start throwing their coat on your booth (while you're sitting there) to mark their territory and then take up a whole booth just for 2 people when there are groups of 5 or 6 people who could squeeze into the booth. Yeah, battle of the fittest or some bullshit like that is much more valid than neighborhood friendly bar, I'm sure.  Really depressingly is that they used actually use a garden behind their back end to grow the greens and herbs used in their food organically and deliciously. Of course now that their patronage has grown so much, they quit that practice. It's no coincidence that their food was better years ago.

2007-12-22,3.0,"Hopleaf is the classic case of becoming a victim of its own success. I've been a once-a-month patron for the past six years, and Hopleaf holds a special place in my life -- it's the place where I've taken my wife (then girlfriend) on our first date, and it is where I proposed.  BUT... Just three stars. At one time, Hopleaf used to be down-to-earth and mellow, patrons being either the literary/intellectual types or hopheads who respected the place, and respected each other -- there has been many times when people would catch my attention if they saw me (and my party) waiting for a table to share their table or to hold it for me as they left.  Dining room would usually be half-empty, so the bartenders mostly tended to the bar patrons, and while they were never the types who made you feel like ""where everyone knows your name"" welcome, they would always be there when you needed a drink, and work with you to give you tastes to guide you through the encyclopedic beer selection to the beer you've had in mind. So, what's changed over the years? 1) It's WAY too crowded.  Not only is getting a seat or a decent enough standing room almost impossible on any given Thurs-Sat night, the packed dining room means that the bartenders are usually super busy servicing the dining drink orders.  Catching one is difficult, and the interaction once you do, is a fleeting, hurried one.  If you don't exactly know what you want, you'll definitely feel the irritation in the bartenders' attitude. 2) Patrons have changed.  The demographic is not yet the fresh-out-of-the-frat-house Wriglyville type, but it's definitely shifting in that direction.  When you bump into people (and you definitely will on a weekend evening), you see less of the mutual apologies and respectful small talk, and more of ""wtf"" looks.  With 240+ reviews by the time of my review, I guess it's attracting a wider array of demographics, and many who are migrating up from ""south of Addison."" There's not much Hopleaf management can do about my gripes, perhaps with the exception of adding more bartenders on busy shifts, or have one solely dedicated to servicing dining drink orders.  Nonetheless, I also feel like they really haven't done much (I'm sure there are other things that they can think up) to address these concerns. Before, I had no hesitation when I decided to go to Hopleaf -- I'd start calling up some buddies as I'll head over there and look forward to some good conversation over great beer.  Now, I pause to glance at my watch, then consider my location in that evening and think about other alternatives.  If there are more than 2 other friends who offer to join up, I usually end up calling for the alternatives; I like Hopleaf, but if I had to give up either great beer selection or chance for decent conversation, I'll give up the beer selection. The beer list remains ever so impressive (I think it's actually getting even better!) and contrary to popular belief, the prices are high, but fair; they've always been.  There's no ""specials"" but their American brews on tap tend to be much cheaper ($3-5 range; Belgians are usually $6-9 range) and there is one brew that's $10/pitcher. It's too bad that Hopleaf will return to what it used to be, and I have to start admiting that when I'm on a lookout for a bar is what this place used to be.",0.9965,0.837,0.133,0.029,0.5086366213151927

2007-12-21,4.0,"I can't wait until January when the smoking ban in Chicago goes into effect. Chicago, you'll catch on after a while that it is a good thing.  I love Hopleaf. It is our favorite restaurant so far since moving to Chicago from Oakland. While we haven't love everything that we've tried on the menu, the food is consistently good. The mussels are always succulent and yummy (go for the wine sauce always...the beer is a let-down).  One complaint is that the food is a little heavy and rich. One suggestion might be to order a salad with whatever you get, but who can get excited about that when there is the brisket sandwich and onion rings (oh so delicate, crunch, salty, and tasty) after you share mussels (for one is plenty) with pommes frites. The CB and J sandwich sounded just too tempting (cashew butter with fig jam and morbier cheese, fired like a grilled cheese, and served with stilton mac and cheese and home-made potato chips. I dare say that is just too much richness and cheese (and I am a cheese FANATIC...there is no such thing as too much. Until now).  And the beer menu: What can I say? It is second to none so far that I've seen here. I keep trying new things, and I always come back to ones that I love: Kwak, Fin du Monde, Delerium Tremens, but it is fun to try the others! We now have a standing date night every Friday because it is so consistently good.  My one complaint is the cigarette smoke from the bar in front. I leave reeking like an ash tray, and I can't state strongly enough how disgusting this is.  Though they don't allow smoking where they serve food, the smoke from the fronts wafts to the back, and I really dislike that smell while I am eating.  I cannot wait until the ban in solidly in place and Chicagoans will realize just how lovely it is to be relieved of smoke in public places.",0.9435,0.759,0.143,0.098,0.4857070707070706
2007-12-20,4.0,"I will unequivocally say that this is the best beer bar in Chicago, if not the entire country. Sure, other bars may have more taps, but what's the point if half of them are devoted to the big 3 breweries and/or the most popular imports? There's more love for beer here than just about anywhere. A hand-picked, frequently-changing selection of about 25 Belgian beers and 25 non-Belgians on tap, along with a bottle menu bigger than the food menus of most Chinese restaurants, ensures you'll be overwhelmed. The back dining room is incredibly attractive, and features a real wood fireplace in the winter and a beautiful garden space in the summer. The front bar is refreshingly free of televisions and thump-thump-thump music. The food is impressive, especially the mussels, fries, and aioli. When I can be convinced to stray from the mussels (which is not often), the Hopleaf's chef does great things with duck and makes a pretty faithful rendition of a Montreal smoked meat sandwich. Suffice it to say that whenever I come here I have a blast and feel thoroughly satisfied. Why the missing star, though? The crowds. Holy Flying Spaghetti Monster, the crowds. I'm at the Hopleaf fairly often, but it's been about a year since I've come in and found a seat in the front room (unless I show up after 11 on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday). The back room is not much better. Friday and Saturday you'll invariably be quoted a 1.5+ hour wait for dinner, and even on weekdays a half-hour to 45 minutes is common. Just about the only time you can get seated immediately is during Bears or Cubs games, provided it's early in the season and the teams haven't embarrassed themselves out of the playoffs yet. I did see an expansion permit in the front window recently, however, and I only hope that a larger Hopleaf will better be able to handle the crowds while keeping up the phenomenal quality.",0.996,0.793,0.182,0.025,0.5656906906906908

As I mentioned we were super hungry, so we ordered a ton of food.  mussels, salad, a cauliflower little baked dish and skatewing.

The superb bartenders know their beers and if you look bewildered enough, or know nothing of beers beyond the additive-laden, American varieties of pale lager, they may let you taste one of the ones you're interested in before you commit to a full glass.

I've never bothered hanging out in a any room but the one in front, and I've never eaten more than fries here (which are very good, but simply not what I like in fries, though I do like the garlic mayonnaise/aioli stuff), though I might some day. The lack of televisions is a nice touch, as is the absence of loud music (though it gets noisy enough without it). This brings me to my last point- the only reason I knocked off a star: jackass patrons. Don't come here just because a lot of the beers have a high alcohol content. Further, don't order the beer with the highest alcohol content just because it has the highest alcohol content (it's not that good).

I was pleasantly surprised when I found that the bartenders weren't just nice, they seemed genuinely  friendly and happy to share their passion about beer. Once inside Hopleaf, the focus is on the company you keep, the beer you drink, and the food you eat. There are no distractions from these things, and that is a welcome change. There are no TVs, video games or jukebox. It's a very comfortable atmosphere with dark wood, low lighting, and vintage beverage signs and posters scattered about.   Not enough good can be said about Hopleaf. You should probably just go there yourself and see.",0.9924,0.752,0.195,0.053,0.6202898550724638

I ordered it with cheese- Havarti I think, It was fantastic.  Not quite as tender as I like, but hey, it was quick, hot, and totally tasty.  One of our group had the Ham sandwich.  He had been raving about it the week before... My thoughts were a ham sandwich?  Ya, enough, I can make one at home.  I got to have a bite.  It was luscious!  I now understand.   Love the fact that no TV s were blaring news, or sports games.  Conversation was the name of the game, and that is what we wanted.  Great place to meet up with friends, both old and new.   The fries are awesome, but I am still thinking about that ham sandwich...",0.996,0.767,0.207,0.026,0.5932449494949494

Well, let's see...everyone is generally right on in their praise and criticism.  Sampling all the different styles of Belgian ales is a true experience provided 1) you actually arrive at a time you can sit down, 2) can manage to have a bartender or server serve you and 3) have the courage to ask for a recommendation from the not so friendly bar staff.  #1 and #2 take care of themselves if you go at a time that isn't busy.  Seriously, if you don't want to smell other people's armpits, don't go on the weekend.  As far as #3, I recommend just closing your eyes, randomly pointing to a beer on the menu and ordering with confidence.  Trying new beers is what you should be there for, and chances are that a random selection off the list will make you happier than the swill you're used to drinking. As for myself, I have had all good experiences here.  I've sat at the restaurant twice for meals and sat at the bar once.  The servers were friendly and not condescending...I have actually asked for and received many recommendations without any eye rolling.  The food is also pretty darn good...perhaps not totally worth the price, but paying for the novelty is fine sometimes. I didn't give this place a higher recommendation because having to strategically plan when you will go to this bar blows.  Secondly, at 6pm on a Wed, this bar seemed to be as loud as on a Friday night despite a fraction of the people.  Hate to go old man style, but I don't like it when I can't hear the person I went there to talk with.",0.5323,0.859,0.085,0.056,0.4817522515798377

Last night, though, here's what I had.  I started with Hansenn's kriek (a cherry beer).   Hansenn's is a traditional farmhouse brewery, still brewing beer in open fermenters that are infected by wild yeasts in the air, creating a sour brew.  Hansenn's is especially good because they don't add sugar at the end of the brewing process, so the kriek was very tart,  virtually uncarbonated, with a nice sour cherry palate.  It was better and much drier than the sparkling wine my drinking partner had.  $12 for a rare beer that most Americans would spit out and flush down the toilet!  I LOVE this place! Next was the Tripel Karmeliet, a more standard Belgian golden ale served on draft in a goblet.  Wonderful, strong stuff, but it's served too cold for my taste - the aromatics that Belgian malt-driven beers are known for can't come out properly.  Again, this is very unusual stuff to find in a bar, on draft, and it's why I come here.  The Tripel Karmeliet was only $7. Curiously, the bartenders were not mean, cold, and unapproachable as they often are here.  It was packed and noisy downstairs, but we bought our drinks and went upstairs - full, too, but we sat on the windowsill seating.",0.9858,0.856,0.122,0.021,0.5356746031746031

Yes, you are putting you selection in the hands of the bar, but I was pretty satisfied with what was given me. Part 2 of the tip- if you seem clueless, you will get ignored. Service is not a highlight of the bar area. It ranks somewhere inbetween cold and indifferent, with a touch of attitude. They probably have a brew based on this somewhere on the menu.

My favorite time to go is on a weekend afternoon, still hopping with people, but no wait.   Recommended beers!!! 3 Floyd's Rabid Rabbit---OMG V. good! brewed w/coriander, rosehips, camomile and lavendar.  Has 3 types of Belgian yeasts adding a caramel flavor to balence out the bouquet.  So wonderfully balanced, a great beer all by itself or as desert. Maresdous Dubbel 8---A BIG effing beer.  And I don't just mean size, there's so much going on in this flavor!  I think Dubbels a scosh lighter than a Porter; still imbued with all that chocolately coffeey deepness, but also has a spice and malt to it that Porter's don't.   Leffe Blonde---perfect for summer.  Light, aromatic, very slightly citrusy Belgium ale.  It has the hoppiness I love and the flavor a lager will never match. I'll stop with my all time, never fails me (since Bell's left that is) Fave. Unibroue Fin du Monde---I don't even care that it's not on tap.  Come to think of it, I've never had this beer on tap...hm, there's a challenge in there I think...Anyway.  By far, the best beer for any day, any time, any mood as long as you're keen on a little buzz because at 9% this beer don't fuck around.  Hoppy, spicy and smooth with perfectly balanced malt.   Damn!

Oh my lordie lordie oh! Tasty. So listen, I know, as a vegetarian, it may seem daunting to come into what is basically a beer house on the outskirts of a very Swedish neighborhood and not feel like sausage will be thrown upon you. This is simply--a common case of the misunderstandings. They have...DELICIOUS...vegetarian friendly dishes. Don't you worry, their grilled fig/cashew butter/and Gruyere cheese sandwich is so rich, and seemingly swimming in butter (this is true of most everything there, I bet they THROW that shit on). If that isn't enough, try the polenta pate or what about the veggie loaf ? Maybe just some of the frites with that damn delicious garlic mayo? EAT IT.  Carnivores/Omnivores/Etc, eat up. The pork chops will floor you.  And then there was the beer list. Uh, Mead anyone? St. Berndardus? I mean, really, phenomenal. As an avid beer-luster, I still am not through the list. But that's because I get hung up on my favourites and refuse to budge. But I truly believe there is a beer here for everyone, lights/darks/ triples/just DRINK UP. That said, I know this place is busy. And when I sat down to write this place up I thought to myself, ""gosh OH gol-LY does it get hella busy in there at night!"" and you know, makes me slightly uncomfortable. But really, the fact remains I know when it is going to start picking up there, and therefore know how to deal with that---so no star demoting shall be had!  If you're there to eat, just go strait to the back hall and they'll get you a space, although the front space seems discouragingly busy. Basically, for your reference (although this is only based on my own observations)...place picks up between the most between 6p and 8p. Get in 'round then and you can claim yo'self some cozy personal space, well, like a few inches. *smirk*",0.9743,0.85,0.107,0.043,0.5473710317460319

A good selection of varying beers was on tap, mostly leaning toward the Belgian ales, triples, and dubbles. Some standards, like Chimay, Duvel etc were there. But looking at the off-tap list was better. A lot of beers, organized sort of confusingly. Set up by country and in the case of Belgian beers in which they specialize by type. So they have an impressive list of Lambic style beers, and Belgian ales of varying sorts, but if you're looking for some type of beer in particular it could get confusing. Or if you know nothing about beer, watch out. Though the bartenders seem to point you sorta in the right direction. All of the beers were tasty for what they were.

Edit: The bartenders here know less and less and less every visit.  The food is good, and I would like to say that it's overpriced, but I don't believe that it is.  A bucket of mussels for $20 is not bad in my book.  Some of the drafts languish due to lack of use.  For example, Dupont's winter seasonal is still on draft.  It is June now.  You can't go wrong with bottles, especially when you know the glass is going to match.  I want to encourage people not to go because I want it to be less crowded when I go there, but I'm not quite that mean-spirited.",0.9377,0.865,0.098,0.037,0.43000000000000005

The beer selection is huge, which is great if you really like to try different beer.  I do enjoy difference, but some of the beer on the menu was extremely expensive, so I wasn't about to venture that far from my usual.  There is no table service there, either, so expect to be standing at the bar for a while when you want something (and if you're lucky, you'll get a little attitude to boot!).   The food?  The menu looked way more upscale than I would have expected from a beer joint and it wasn't very big.  I was thinking pub grub -- though hopefully something vegetarian, as that is what I am.  It is hardly that (pub food), which I can appreciate, but the vegetarian food on the menu was too complicated for what I was in the mood for that night and it was MUCH more expensive than I was in the mood for as well, so we didn't bother.  The seated dining area did look like a pretty nice atmosphere, though, so it might be a good place to try sometime when you're in the mood for that.

In the past couple of years, they've expanded drastically.  In this new space, they've opened a second, smaller bar and a full kitchen and (smoke-free!!!!) dining room.  The menu is small, but quite diverse in selection and always has interesting selections.  This past weekend, wild boar stew and veal sweetbreads sat aside the more common steak frites and ham sandwich.  Their specialty (surprisingly) is Belgian-influenced foods, especially mussels and fries.  You're also likely to find at least a couple of dishes made with beer as an ingredient.  Reward your taste buds with one of these fine dishes. Occasionally, I have a gripe with the service.  Sometimes it can be quite gruff and cold.  However, my last trip was actually the best service I've ever had there.  Perhaps it's an issue they're addressing.  We were asked to vacate our table, which was a little frustrating.  However, upon leaving it turns out we were asked by another selfish, ridiculous patron and not by the staff.  They apologized profusely and told us we were welcome to stay as long as we wanted.  My only true complaint is that I was unable to tell the bastard my true thoughts.

So the crowd here is unique.  It is a chicago bar that isn't full of hipsters, trixie's, or the stereotypical yuppies (though half of them are certainly yuppie).  Belgian brews are among the best in the world, and the selection at this bar is excellent.  Prices are appropriate for each beer.  Tons on tap, and even more in bottle form.  Food is good, though I've only dined here twice.   this place gets CROWDED, so be prepared to wait when you order a beer.  one lady mentioned that she was disappointed that the back area is for food orders, but neglected to mention that the upstairs is pretty sweet, offers a second bar (only bottles, but a big selection), and is less crowded.  The upstairs opens around 8pm, often a little earlier. the reasons I dont give it 5 stars.  this place does get very crowded, and there isn't much turn over, so you gotta find your spot and stick with it, even if it's just a section on the wall.  Also, while the menu does it's best to describe many beers, I've occasionally come across a beer that, despite it's intriguing description, did not jive well with my taste buds.  By this I mean that many of the descriptions sounds similar (eg. ""hoppy"" ""malty"", etc.), all are positive (they wouldn't serve beer no one likes), but the tastes run the gamut.  also, this place isn't too close to the train, the Clark bus is torture, and driving after a few of these brews isn't a good idea! ps.  what's with all the Thor beards, does everyone at this bar think that they're a viking?  clinging to swede ancestry?",0.9889,0.797,0.155,0.048,0.47872206622206637

The bar and restaurant areas were completely packed, and we waited about 15 minutes to get a table (there is no place to stand and wait so we kept having to move around!) The menu was startling in it's lack of chicken entrees or appetizers. I found this a little puzzling but moved on. We ordered the smelts--which were excellent, and I had the shrimp salad sandwich. This was a disappointment, as basically the chef jammed a bunch of tiny prawns into a croissant with barely any kind of sauce or vegetable to go with it. Needless to say, the fries took up nearly 3/4 of the plate!  The service was friendly, and our waitress recommended a good, light Belgian beer which I enjoyed.

For the less adventurous, there's sirloin and fries or pork chops. The Hopleaf version of ham and cheese -- Nueske ham with gruyere on pumpernickel -- is a killer.

We chose to go back on a Monday at 5 p.m.  Gotta tell ya, perfect time for those who don't like the hustle and bustle of a restaurant that has an atmosphere of a nightclub.  And while my hub was really excited about this place, I think it was just the extensive beer options that really gave him the shivers.  The food was overall, just ok.  The mussels for two ($20)  were decent, I would do them again.  And while the onion rings were tasty, they weren't all that, and certainly not worth $6.  I had the steak frites ($18) for dinner and hub had the Pulled Beef Brisket ($10).  The steak was a little chewy, but what can I expect from a bar restaurant.  It was cooked as I requested and tasty, so not all bad.  Hub's pulled brisket was good, probably would order it again if we went again.   The one thing we noted was all the fries and that garlic mayo thing.  Lots of fries and lots of garlic mayo, yum!!  Would have liked the option for ketchup or vinegar though, but I could see how that would impose on the 'Belgian' style of serving their pommes frites.  The dessert options were all cheesecakes, and since I'm not partial to cheesecakes, no dessert. Now, if you want to talk beer, this is the place.  I'm not much of a beer drinker, but if my hub was writing this review, we wouldn't have even addressed the food.  We shared the Gran Cru ($15/750ml) and then I had the Frambozenbier ($8.50) while he had a red Chimay ($6.50).  The Gran Cru reminded me of Blue Moon, but with more body.  For those who don't like the heavy yeast taste, try the Frambozenbier.  The berry flavor of the beer can make you forget the nasty after taste.  Hub liked the red Chimay but wants to come back and try the others, as well as the other beer options.  Needless to say, if you like good beers, this is a place to visit.  It's too bad they don't have flights.  Somebody want to make that suggestion to them?

I might suggest the 10.5% alcoholic Delerium Tremens. Or, you could just close your eyes, flip the pages and point. That works well too.",0.9468,0.779,0.198,0.023,0.5858560090702947
2005-06-06,5.0,"If you're looking for good food and pint in a warm pub atmosphere, head on down to the Hopleaf. Although they boast a wide variety of Belgium beers on tap, they also have all the local favs -- including Bell's. The husband and I sampled way too much of the menu and walked away feeling that the moules & frites stole the show (fries: crispy -- mussels: sop up the broth with the bread!). If only I LIVED in Chicago so I could frequent this joint.",0.68,0.921,0.079,0.0,0.42361111111111116
