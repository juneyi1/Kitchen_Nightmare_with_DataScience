Keep in mind it's if you dine indoors only, which was a bummer because it was such a warm day out. We were seated promptly, and our server was really nice. We ordered 2 dozen oysters on the half-shell, a bloody mary and some bubbly. The oysters were pretty yummy, and it came with the usual toppings (Tabasco, horseradish, cocktail sauce, pickled onion?). The Tabasco came in the tiny little bottles, and I used 2 of those on just my dozen. The onions were pickled I think, but it had a great briney/acidic taste to it and was a good addition to the oysters.  Bloody Mary - maybe they used peppered vodka or something? it was a weird taste Bubbly - forgot which I ordered, but brut bubbly is always good to me Truffle Fries - ugh, so good! just do it It was a really good deal, and it's a great way to start your day!",0.9744,0.752,0.175,0.073,0.7027777777777778

He had many tasks going on but would tell the new guest; ""Welcome!  I'll be right with you.""  Today, the kids working back behind the bar finish the 1 task they have before they acknowledge the new guest.  Even then, they don't welcome you. They act like they're doing you a favor by waiting on you.  I've been back a half a dozen times since Lee has been gone, thinking it will get better.  It never does.  I'm done donating my money to insufficient service.  Make me feel like a million dollars and I will stay and spend a lot of money.

The setting/venue was PERFECT and the staff was amazing!!!  There was an incredible vibe being in the city and the food (steak and chicken) was excellent. I met with Kelly Lynch the coordinator there and from my first initial interaction with Kelly via email and then in person for planning purposes she was absolutely professional and buttoned up, as well as the most helpful and responsive she could be.  She made the process seamless and effortless, I cannot believe how accommodating she was and I just cannot compliment her enough. My dad had passed away during the planning process and she even went as far as to call and say even if I just needed to talk I could call her, she went above and beyond. This past Saturday my guests could not compliment her enough to me.  They just kept saying how helpful she was, how she had everything set up beautifully and she even sought out my two little cousins to release the aisle ribbon and give them a job to do the day of our wedding, they were THRILLED!!  She was incredibly kind and accommodating to my mom and my husband's parents as well. Along with Kelly, the rest of the staff was AMAZING as well and went out of their way to serve us and give us the best 5 star service we could ask for, even wrapping up all of our leftover desserts at the end of the night and when we had leftover cheese from the appetizers they set it out with our desserts so it didn't go to waste. After the fact the staff even collected all of our decorations and vases and Kelly returned it all to me on Monday! I just cannot say enough about this venue, the Park Grill staff and Kelly Lynch!!  I would HIGHLY recommend this for a wedding venue.  They were much nicer and easier to work with than any of the other downtown places I had spoken to during the planning process.",0.995,0.833,0.154,0.013,0.5356547619047618

I did not understand why it took so long because all together there was only three tables of people and multiple servers. My friend got a chicken wrap with fries and I bought a side of mash potatoes. The potatoes were good but not worth $7.00. My friend's wrap was very average and her fries were cold. After I finished my potatoes I asked for a dessert menu which took alomost 20 minutes to get. After that we did not see our server again. We went to the host stand to get out check because we had a train to catch. No one was at the host stand and it took awhile for the manager to come give us our check. After we gave them money it took and extremely long time to get our change.

The Cuban Cobb salad, Lobster Roll with bacon, and an amazing BLT made with pork belly are all show stoppers. None is particularly heart healthy, but the kitchen works to accommodate every possible need.  There are one or two quirks about Park Grill, but they are completely overshadowed by the friendly and attentive service. One summer quirk is that there are sometimes large parties of vacationing families with lots of demands and zero time constraints. If your server gets one of those groups, it can take 10+ minutes to even take their order. Another oddity is that you have to order bread, and it can take 10 minutes to arrive.

The Park Grill is at one of the largest tourist attractions in the city and it was a Sunday morning on Memorial Day weekend!! Five of us completed the Bike the Drive event and were starving!! We headed over to the park grill and got in line. There was a large group of about 10-12 in front of us who spoke to a few staff members. So when they opened at 11:00 they were stunned to have a large party and made everyone in line wait while they set up tables for them. Once we were seated the waiter came over and started to take our drink order. But midway through the order, he excused himself and walked away. He came back a few minutes later to tell us about all the things they were out of on the menu. Other than salads and appetizers, which he didn't mention, there are 10 items on the menu. They were out of five of them!!! That's half the menu. Great, they were out of the item I wanted. Ok - I'll adjust while we get our drinks. There are 5 mixed drinks and 5 wine choices. The rest of our party ordered strawberry, vodka lemonades and I ordered a sangria. Well, guess what?? They were OUT of sangria. So I ordered a blueberry mojito. Nope - out of blueberry. So I ordered strawberry. He brought my drink and it was an original mojito. My husband started to argue it, but I looked at their strawberry lemonade and realized that it was just strawberry syrup and not anything close to a real fruit product. So I stuck with the original. At $10 for a strawberry, vodka lemonade I'd expect more than an 8 ounce cup of powdered lemonade and bottled syrup. The waiter then informed us that the kitchen had decided to open at 11:30 instead of the advertised 11:00 and he couldn't even place our food order before 11:30. By this time, we were pretty fed up. We were trying to decide if we should just stick it out or leave. Well, the final straw was that my husband had finished his drink and ordered a beer and surprise - they were OUT of the beer he ordered off the menu!!! When we questioned him, the waiter reluctantly told us that this is the norm, not unusual. They rarely have all the menu items or open on time!! I just wonder why he doesn't find a different job.

Then the lamb chops came back rare, almost raw. The waiter seemed unwilling or unable to rectify the nonsense (got the sense this was a frequent occurrence). The waiter didn't know how to appease the customer, and made little attempt to do so. Frankly I couldn't tell who was being more petty and vindictive, the cook or the waiter. Of course, having worked in resturants earlier in my life, I knew better than to request they fix it again.  Instead, my friends shared their filet mignon and salmon. Terrible!

The most healthy thing on the menu was the margherita flatbread (which I got) or salad (which I just..can't bring myself to eat. I loathe salad). The flatbread was very tasty, by the way! Overall, I would say that this place had decent food....although not many interesting options. This is your typical greasy burger and fatty appetizer joint. Not many special or stand out menu options, aside from the cheese curds. The place had good food, but nothing was so special that I would ever come back. If you are hungry and are by the bean, check this place out, but otherwise, most likely not a place you are going to come back to. Also note, they do have a Kobe burger on the menu. My group came in about 45 min after the place opened and they were out of Kobe burgers for the day. If that is something you want, you gotta get there early.  Yes, you get to eat under the shiny bean :)",0.9943,0.78,0.18,0.04,0.46898809523809526

Walked in around 5:30 pm or so, place was still pretty empty and I had the large bar all to myself. I didn't order a full meal but just wanted a beer and a snack. Food: Looked to be a pretty extensive menu, seeing how I was going to look for dinner later on I just wanted a snack. I ordered a dark draft beer from Wisconsin and since I'm going with the whole cheese state thing I ordered the fried cheese curds. The curds were very good, not overly battered, crispy, light and all melty gooey in the middle. Paired perfectly with the draft I was enjoying. Service: Good service sitting at the bar (but then again I was the only customer at the bar) with a friendly bartender and a big screen tv all to myself. Atmosphere: Large space with a big bar, lots of booths, etc. There seemed to be a lot of servers working so I imagine the place gets busy. Seeing how it was early (before 6) it was pretty empty, quiet, and relaxing. Value: On the pricier side but being in a prime spot I can imagine that the prices are in align with other similar establishments in the area. Overall: Based on the cheese curds I'd be willing to come back and order something more substantial.

Drinks: We're visiting from TX and tried a local beer, Not Your Father's Root Beer. It was absolutely delicious! Service: We actually had a really friendly server. Service was really slow, but we were expecting that. Overall, it's a great location so they're always going to have business. I'd recommend if you're already in the park and want to grab drinks, but the food is so overpriced and not that exciting-- there's so much more Chicago has to offer. I wouldn't come back or recommend that it's worth trying.",0.9877,0.755,0.199,0.046,0.4759259259259258

I highly recommend trying the: fish & chips, fish tacos, burgers, or even the baked chicken.

My Dad chose this place for dinner (which was surprising, but I wasn't going to complain!).  I was excited to try this out because it's always so packed in the summer.  Probably due to the frigid weather, it was not that crowded at all, so we didn't have to fight for a table or wait at all. The vibe is certainly classy, kinda old-school.  There are plenty of booths and tables, with a large bar and also a fab view of the park/skating rink.   For the location, I was pleasantly surprised at the pricing.  Sure, they had the entrees that were $25+, but they also had many reasonable options as well.  The fare was pretty typical ""American"", but I found myself eyeing the Cuban Cobb Salad and the Falafel sandwich.  The waitress suggested the falafel sandwich ($12) and I was very happy with the decision!  It was a bit like a ""deconstructed"" falafel sandwich, so it was like bits and pieces of the falafel mixed with a salad in a pita.  It was tasty and I loved the spicy element to it.  My parents got the prime rib sandwich ($16) and the chicken sandwich ($14).  Both looked very tasty. The highlight, though, was the calamari , with the sauce up on my list of favorite things!  Yum.  Our waitress was sweet and tried to persuade us to get some delish looking dessert.  If we weren't running late, we prob would have ordered it!  Next time!",0.9963,0.753,0.232,0.016,0.6177414021164022

It had a lot of everything in it like avocado, black beans, chicken and even a fried egg on top. I would definitely order it again and I would highly recommend it for any salad fanatics.

2014-07-26,1.0,"One would think that after countless complaints on Yelp, the manager would be more proactive and make changes. However, seeing that this place is a touristy restaurant, I gather that the manager does not care or expect to see his or her patrons for a second time, which is not an excuse for terrible service. I had made reservations so waiting was not an issue. We were seated in this isolated area, so we were ignored for most of the night. Our waiter comes briefly and gives us water and forgets our bread. Many minutes later, a different waiter comes and explains that our first waiter is also bartending, which I didn't understand because there was already a bartender behind the counter and only 3 patrons sitting at the bar. About a forever and a half later, we get bread with butter and according to yet another waiter we had, ""I don't know - it's some tapenade. I'm not really sure, I'm new here."" How is it acceptable that servers do not know what they are serving?  Our food arrived rather quickly and very shoddily done. I ordered the Black Bean burger. I really don't think you can call whatever was in between the buns a patty. It looked like it came straight from a can, barely mashed and barely put together.

Solid in that they were probably refried so they were rock hard. Gross. My friend, whose review is below, ordered the Seasonal Tortellini at ""market price,"" or $20. His dish comes out in this huge bowl and only a handful of tortellini in it. Also should have taken a picture but I would not be surprised if it were Chef Boyardee's. Of course, he asks the waitress nicely if he can order something else because he was extremely underwhelmed by this special. She ignores his request and reluctantly takes the dish back to the chef. The manager comes out saying that they put a little more on his plate and basically just dropped the bowl on the table - no apologies or eye contact.

But when a tourist-centric restaurant is so resplendently shitty, so in-your-face awful, so defiantly sub-par that they're almost proud of it: That's when it feels good, SO good, to just push your chair back, get up, and walk out of the restaurant, food uneaten and check unpaid.  Looking back, there were a few warning signs: First, the hostess chose to seat us in a dark, empty, abandoned-looking section of the outdoor dining area, away from all other patrons and with absolutely no view of anything attractive (truly the only draw to eating at this restaurant). Suffice it to say, we demanded to be reseated in the busy main dining area, and it turned out there were tables available there (then why seat us in no-man's-land?) Next: After we were seated, our waitress came to take our orders (iced tea and cobb salads). I also requested a cup of hot water with lemon for my mom, who had a sore throat (a no-brainer, I'd thought). But to our mutual shock and confusion, the waitress flatly refused, explaining that she had no way to get hot water. (Really? Running it from the tap wasn't an option? How about microwaving a cup of water? No?) Third: Around five minutes after we'd placed our order, some dude, without even looking at us, walked by and practically discus-tossed a couple of (what looked like) industrial metal plates onto our table. These plates contained a pitiful handful of lettuce, some cherry tomato halves, and a few pieces of chopped chicken and avocado. That's it. Noticeably absent were the Roquefort cheese, crisp bacon, and hardboiled egg that are hallmarks of this dish. Verdict: This was the smallest, most woeful, insulting $14 ""cobb salad"" known to man.  But wait... there's more. Because get this: We had no way to EAT this pile of disappointment. Our table had no cutlery.... no napkins.... no place setting whatsoever. And no one had even brought us water or our iced teas.  In a normal restaurant, the food busser would have noticed our lack of cutlery, drinks, etc. and redressed the situation immediately; but in this alternate universe, we couldn't PAY to get anyone's attention. Something was pungeantly rotten in tourist land.  After we finally flagged down another employee to get cutlery (our actual waitress was MIA), my mom and I glumly took a bite of our salads. But at the same moment - locking eyes and smiling - she and I arrived at the same conclusion: We'd ask the waitress to take the salads back to the kitchen. We weren't eating this crap, especially not when the restaurant was treating us like second-class citizens.  Once again, we tried to attract our waitress' attention, but she made herself scarce, helping customers in other parts of the dining area and totally ignoring us.  After a few minutes of this, our righteous indignation skyrocketing, there was really only one choice. We weren't going to spend $14 on shitty salad and even shittier service. We were ON VACATION, dammit.  So we pulled back our chairs, got up, and left. I don't think I've ever felt better.",-0.9873,0.825,0.051,0.124,0.4683106575963719

Given their popular location in Millenium park, they obviously don't rely on repeat customers, and their service & food certainly reflect this. I took my family here for lunch yesterday. It all started rather oddly with the hostess who seemed utterly disconnected. We asked her for a table for 4 and said that we'd prefer to sit outside if possible. She says it'll just be a moment for an outside table, as they are cleaning some tables off right now. Then she immediately tells us that is will be a 30 minute wait for an outside table. What? Then she asks us how many people are in our party (again). Very strange. We ended up sitting inside, although after sitting down, we watched two outside table go unoccupied for the next 30 minutes. Wow. I wanted to order a beer first, so I looked in their drink menu (the cover of which says Wine Cocktails & Beer) and there wasn't a single beer listed in the book. So when the waitress finally came around, I asked her about it, and she gave me a beer menu that she keeps on her person. What's up with that? Is the beer menu some sort of secret or something? Of course, once you order a beer, she takes the menu back, so you can peruse to see if you might want to order a different beer next time. Their beer menu by the way, is nothing special. I ordered a pale ale, only to find out (10 minutes later) that they were out of it. Boy do I hate when restaurants are out of things and they fail to let the customer know ahead of time. Inexcusable. Anyway, the waitress brought me something else instead....a 13% Barleywine. What? I just ordered a Pale Ale...and she brings me something TOTALLY different as a substitute? I got the feeling that nobody is buying this Barleywine, so they decide that they should ""push"" it onto customers. I sent it back and ordered something else. So far, this place is just crazy and I was really getting a weird ""twilight-zone"" like vibe here. We order, and my food was also disappointing. I got the PG(Park Grill) Burger with Butterkasse cheese. I ordered medium, and it came out rare (pink cool center). The burger meat itself was average at best, but the bun was dry, stale and tasteless and my ""hand cut"" french fries  (who really care if your fries are hand cut?) were limp. Cost us $100 for lunch, and I left pretty mad. On the way out, the family wanted to use the toilet. They only have two single person uni-sex toilets for the whole restaurant! What?

I couldn't eat them they were so gross. Finally, he came back with my wine that was in a cup I think is actually intended to gargle mouthwash.

We sat in a booth that had a great view of Michigan. On a warmer day, the patio would be great for some lunch and people watching. The service was really great- our server was attentive and came often to see how we were doing. For a tourist spot, the price point wasn't too bad. Most entrees were in the $12-15 range and portions weren't too small. I had the falafel entree, which was a-okay. My DC had a burger with fries and a carrot-ginger soup.

Two of the entrees ordered were good, one was a bit questionable and one, mine, just was not up to even basic standard.  Salmon - was very good, Crab Louis Salad was very good, Amish Chicken - meh especially since the doneness was a bit questionable, PG Burger - so underwhelming makes a Quarter Pounder look gourmet.  French fries, cold, not just kind of warm, but cold.  Burger patty had to have been frozen previously.  Texture was a bit mushy and at the same time, tough.  Not sure how that is possible, but it happened.  BBQ offered on the side which after one bite I smeared across the burger to try and get some flavor and still failed.  Overall, extremely disappointing.  I did see another review stating the calistoga burger was the best they ever had.  If that's the case, the PG Grill was an epic fail and should be removed.   Cleanliness - POWER WASH the patio.  It was disgusting and does not have anything to do with it being start of season and maybe opened sooner than they thought.  You can see in the traffic areas it hasn't been done in a very long time.  They are dirty as well as the walls around the patio.  You can see where food has maybe been dropped or splashed against the walls and has been there for a VERY long time.  Overall, it just looked dingy and dirty.   Overall, a very big disappointment and lives up to a reputation of being a tourist trap based on it's fantastic location.  It could be such a gem in a world class park with some attention to the details.",0.5998,0.764,0.119,0.117,0.5529365079365078

I had the Seared Skuna Bay Salmon (brown sugar mustard glaze, roasted fingerling potatoes, broccoli $24)  which was very, very good.  It was cooked perfectly, and the glaze was delicious on both the salmon and veggies.

Our drinks ran dry, and we had to hunt down someone else to get silverware. We couldn't taste the tequila in our margaritas. And for the food, every dish had something wrong. The duck tacos were missing ingredients listed on the menu. The burger had pieces of tin foil in the cheese. And the sliders were served cold and undercooked.   We grabbed the manager only because we couldn't find our server. She was apologetic and promptly fixed the sliders and took them off the bill (we didn't mention some of the other issues as we didn't want to be THOSE PEOPLE who find something wrong with every dish, even though there was).

The maitre-d said that he would seat us at the time we were supposed to be there-6:30..ummm okk kind of rude..even my mom was a little offended by his manner, but we waited outside until exactly 6:30. To his credit, he might have noticed our scowling faces, because when we came back he was much more polite and attentive. We got seated, and our waiter was great, very nice. My mom got the spring risotto, very creamy but not much stuff other than the rice and cream, and I got the 6oz center steak with the shallots and aspargus with a glass of pinot noir (not that great). The steak was really good though- very flavorful and nicely seasoned. At the end we got the chocolate soft-centered cake, which was great, the inside nice and gooey..although the cinnamon ice cream it came with was soo cinnamon-y..I felt like I was chewing cinnamon gum. Pairing the ice cream with the cake DID tone it down a little, but it was still kind of weird. The restaurant is nice and clean. Has two bathrooms for both men and women. Like some other review said, it feels like Park Grill is trying a little too hard to be an upscale restaurant. However with the location geared towards the everyday tourist, and the adjoining ice cream shop and that they serve hot dogs and beer right outside, I'd say it should be feel a little more casual.  There's nothing wrong with lofty aspirations, but the whole time I was there I kept second-guessing myself as to whether or not I was appropriately dressed.

Service-wise, it was A+. I'm not sure what these other reviewers experienced but our waitress was beyond excellent. She even gave us tips on good places to watch the 7/4 fireworks. One complaint that I do have is the bathroom. There is only one bathroom per gender, which means it could be a long wait if there are a lot of people trying to use it.

As such, ambiance is fantastic if you're looking for something touristy or just like to people watch on Michigan Ave., up one level at the Bean or the motley bunch around you. It's a fantastic idea for a bar and I'm pretty sure they must make a killing, especially when the weather is nice. There is a limited bar menu here and I've tried the nachos and burger. Neither of which quality and taste justified price. It was okay and sufficed for the situation but I would certainly not seek this place out to eat the food specifically.

2012-07-06,1.0,"I hate to add yet another bad review to my yelp list but I can't let this one slide.  The Park Grill is one of those restaurants that survives only because of location.  Close to the Harris Theatre, I've begrudgingly gone one too many times because friends want to be close to the venue.  The waiters are always sub-par, and the food is very expensive and also sub-par for the price. Why I'm finally writing about them is that now they can add overcharging to their list of services.  After paying for a meal with 4 friends last Friday, we noticed we had been charged for a full bottle of wine when only one glass was served.  The ""accounts receivable"" person has so far been unable / unwilling to figure  out how to rectify the problem....I'm sure this has never happened before.  It has been over a week with numerous calls and still nothing.  I will be disputing the charge with the hope to help them ""figure it out"".  Be forewarned about this place.  Location is not everything!",0.9551,0.842,0.122,0.036,0.7294017094017095

If you're considering a private event at the restaurant, the indoor restaurant is preferable because it comes with everything (tables, linens, cutlery, etc.).  The outdoor area just comes with the tent and you have to rent out everything else separately (might be ok for a standing cocktail hour, but not a meal).  The location is amazing - could not be better for tourists and visitors to Chicago.  The food is very good - a bit more high-end than you can get for large groups at most restaurants.  We selected a menu with one salad/appetizer, two choices of entree and one dessert (everything served individually) and allowed our guests to order drinks freely from whatever was available (on our dime).  They served the salmon perfectly cooked, which is hard to do in large quantities, and the molten chocolate cake was also perfect.  The staff is quite professional and is helpful in selecting the menu and preparing for the event.  There were a few drawbacks in my mind: (1) The price - it's very expensive!  The required minimum for us was higher than the price per person plus orders from the open bar combined.  Not by a lot, but that was frustrating.  By contrast, at Vinci (which we used for another one of our wedding events), we went over our minimum with the food and drinks that were actually ordered and eaten.  Paying money for nothing frustrated me.  (2) Not very kid-friendly.  We needed 3 highchairs and 5 booster seats and they only had 2 highchairs and no booster seats available.  However, if I had to do it again, I would host our lunch at Park Grill again - I love the location and was very happy with the quality of the food and service.",0.9901,0.844,0.124,0.032,0.5754315476190477

Its main draw is its location because the food was just A-OK. I went there for Sunday brunch with my boyfriend and we ordered the smoked salmon cold dish, steak & eggs and the kobe slam. The smoked salmon was average - it's what you expect for smoked salmon, and it came with two pieces of toast and a salad. The dressing wasn't extraordinary in any way and well, toast is just toast. As for the kobe slam, which I ordered, the menu said ""kobe burger"" but the dish came with only the kobe patty which 1) had too much pepper for my taste and 2) was slightly undercooked for medium. The patty also fell apart very easily, which made eating it more of a ""cut and scoop"" process. The steak and eggs were decent though because the hollandaise sauce was done pretty well, and this was the only thing that made the meal worth it since the steak itself was averagely seasoned and cooked.",0.8995,0.88,0.089,0.032,0.6635416666666667

2012-06-24,5.0,"I've been here half a dozen times and finally decided to post a review today. When my friends visit Chicago this is the first restaurant I recommend. The reason is because Park Grill has the best hamburger in the WORLD. Yup, that's right... at least that's my opinion. I've tried tens or even hundreds of different hamburgers in my lifetime and this is the very best, numero uno. I've tried all the beef burgers on the menu. What's special about their burger is the beef, so make sure you get the beef burger rather than the fish/chicken burger. I recommend the Park Grill burger ($11) over the Kobe burger ($17) because they're basically the same, the main difference being the bun. I feel that the pretzel bun isn't worth the extra cost.   Other than the burgers I've also tried their appetizers such as the calamari and nachos (however, I don't see nachos on their menu anymore.) Food is good and portions are large. Given the location and the quality of food I feel the price they charge is very fair. Parking is crazy here, basically there is no reasonable parking spots anywhere near. Do not park in the Millenium Park garage as the rate is something like $25-$30 an hour... don't even ask how I found out. Use public transportation if you're coming to this area. I've only seen Park Grill's burger listed on one or two best burger lists online. In my opinion it deserves to be #1 on all hamburger lists. For the Park Grill burger alone this restaurant gets a 5 star from me, one of my favorite restaurants in Chi Town.",0.983,0.846,0.126,0.028,0.5005616605616606

The only thing that got me was the bill - of course, I know the threshold for the location - but I may be tiring of the $12-$13 glass thing - I like to have a few glasses of wine, and the resulting $50 bill is leading me to seek new options.

Sauce was tasteless, watered down from cheap spaghetti noodles that weren't drained thoroughly enough. Barely finished it, only because it only took a few bites. In all this our server was prompt but I really loved this other guy, either a busser or server. He was so sweet and kept checking on us. He deserves a raise!  Overall, food was definitely forgettable. Perhaps regrettable.

I liked the atmosphere and was a great late afternoon spot to sit and enjoy the views. I ordered a burger and it was a very good burger. I think I was expected more to be on the menu than wraps and burgers but it worked for me since that is what we were looking for (a good burger). So food and atmosphere were good. Few things I didn't like:  The waiter we had was not very good. I know its a tough job and the place was crowded but he had about 6 tables from what we could tell. He was very absent-minded and was obvious he forgot to put our order in because our food... two simple burgers... came 20 minutes AFTER two other tables food that were seated about 15 minutes after we ordered. He did apologize for the ""delay"" when he finally brought our food though. However, he also forgot our drink order after greeting us and asking if we wanted drinks once we sat. We had to remind him about our order...LOL. Finally, he forgot to bring our check after asking for it twice. The drinks we ordered were not very good either. We ordered margiritas and they just didn't taste good. Like the use a cheap pre-mix or something. As someone else said drinks are pricy too. If I go back I'd have a beer or glass of wine instead. Finally, price. Two drinks, two burgers, and an order fo chips and salsa came out to almost $60.. and that was the least expensive margiritas and burgers on the menu. I think I may give it another try though because that was a very good burger and was just a nice setting to sit, eat, and catch up with a friend. As for the waiter... I won't be too hard on him because I think he told another table next to us that complained about something that he was ""new"". Or at least that is what it sounded like he said. I'm sure he will get better and if not then I am sure he won't last there..lol.",0.9934,0.815,0.151,0.033,0.546891292988854

Watched as 3 bartenders talked to each other, patrons and clean glasses but not to us. Finally, after 5 minutes we were handed a wine list and we quickly inquired about the glass options before losing his attention to another customer. It took him another 5 minutes of researching by the glass options when our buzzer went off. With no drink in hand we made our way to the hostess station and she then led us to our table, which was inside. Not what we wanted. She then left us in the middle of the restaurant, awkwardly standing next to people dining, and then informed us that it was their mistake. We turned to head back to the bar when we noticed that our prime real estate had been swooped up by another couple waiting, probably for outside seating.

Service is pretty friendly but can be a little spread out once the massive patio's full.  In fairness, there appeared to be a large party sitting nearby, so things weren't horrible considering.

2011-06-09,2.0,"I would give this place 2 1/2 stars if possible. Once summer rolls around, this is a frequent happy hour destination for me and my coworkers. The main reason for that is because it's the only place around that has a pretty large amount of outdoor space. The drinks are a bit pricey and the service ranges from slow to nonexistent. Normally, we don't even bother trying to get a table and just order directly from the bar and then stand around. This system works fine as long as you don't mind waiting a while at the bar for your drinks. Once in a while, we do manage to get a table, which is good because it's nice to sit down, but bad because this means we're dependent on the extremely slow waitresses. Last night, for example, it took one friend of mine 30 minutes to get his beer because the waitress was slow and they happened to be out of every single beer he ordered (that's unusual). When she finally brought his beer, she said we needed to close out with her because she was leaving. We still wanted to stay a while, but another waitress never even showed up, so we had to go to the bar and get our drinks directly from there. Not the end of the world, but certainly not what you expect. I don't usually eat there, but the few times that I've ordered appetizers, they've been pretty good and filling. Last night I had a Moroccan salad appetizer that was big enough to be a whole meal (and was very tasty to boot). At the end of the day, I'd say the main appeal here is the outdoor space.

I was a little skeptical since it had only 3.5 Yelp stars and I prefer to aim for 4 or more, but this place was fantastic! I honestly think the folks giving it 3 stars need to wake up - if your review mentions an item you could ""eat every single day for the rest of your life"" or some other such lavish praise of the food, don't turn around and short-star the place. Seriously.  Anyway, the PG: very friendly staff, who found us a table right away although it was crowded and they thought we might have to wait. Food was fantastic. We split the Grilled Fig Bruschetta share plate, which was delicious. Wonderful flavors, very nice portion size. For dinner I had a half serving of the apple-carrot soup, and the small bucatini, and both were wonderful. Made very well, with obvious attention to the flavors. The bucatini is made with Bolognese sauce, which I make at home every four years or so because it takes at least four hours to make - their version was even more delicious than mine, so they clearly put in the effort on it. My husband had the rainbow trout and it was perfectly cooked, and a perfect portion size for a lighter fish dish (i.e. two large fillets). Also a great flavor combination, it was served with little turnips and a garlic puree. For dessert we had a St. Patty's day special, a little Guinness cake stuffed with melted chocolate and with an oatmeal stout ice cream on the side - I've never encountered a beer ice cream before and it was delicious! The only flaw in the meal was my husband's martini - didn't come as dry as he likes, but then he didn't ask for it extra dry. It only cost $11, which frankly is on the less-expensive side for a cocktail in a city, so we didn't complain. Overall we loved this place.

2011-02-23,3.0,"Never has a dining experience caused so much of a roller coaster when it comes to final assessment.  Case in point - I know the rating of most of my restaurants within the first 15 minutes, and rarely does an initial mental rating change as the meal goes on.  Not so with Park Grill.  For those of you who've ever looked at how I do ratings before, you'll notice that rate categories.  But for once, I'm going to mix it up and rate Park Grill chronologically.  Bear with me. Arrival: 5 out of 5 Very easily accessible via many modes of public transportation.  Driving would be your worst option here.  I liked how it only took me about 7 minutes from my local bus stop.  The ice rink is right there, and on our particular night (Saturday, 2.19.11), they are doing Lady Gaga night.  My girlfriend (who remarkably is almost 30) thought this was grand.  I could not deny the wonderful location of Park Grill. Initial Greeting: 5 out of 5 Very cordial people working at the front.  Things are looking good.   Waiter Greeting: 3 out of 5 Our waiter, Tom, is a nice fellow - but I noticed a few things.  a) He didn't point out the fixed price menu for restaurant week, and b)He didn't highlight anything, nor did he mention what was no longer available.  I heard him say on a few occasions, ""I should have told you at the beginning that we were out of [insert food here]...""  Processing of orders: 3 out of 5 Still level at an ""A-Ok"".  Tom does a competent job of taking our orders, but falters slightly with my drink order.  A sidecar.  Yes, that's what I drink.  Sidecars and old fashioned.  It gave me pause that Tom actually asked me  for the ingredients of the sidecar before taking my order off to the bar.  After I specifically asked, ""Can your bartender make me a sidecar?""  Maybe I was unclear with the ""can"" sentiment.  Anyone can physically mix a drink.  I want someone who does it right. Food rollercoaster: Jumbo Prawn: 3.5 out of 5.  Slight increase in rating because the prawn was adequately cooked.  It didn't burst with flavor, and setting it on angel hair pasta may have been a little trite, but it didn't taste rubbery either.  Shrimp and Grits: 2 out of 5.  Jennifer noticed my look of consternation.  The cheddar grits were much too salty, and that's the nicest way I can put it.  Sip of Sidecar: 2.5 out of 5.  My mood is lifted a little as I quickly realized that the bartender had no idea what proportions to make my sidecar with.  So I got a very very stiff drink, albeit a wrong drink.  Wisconsin beef: 4 out of 5.  Out of the depths of mediocrity, the beef comes in for a save.  Medium rare was medium rare, and although the braised potatoes weren't extraordinary, the steak was at least memorable.  J's pork: 4.5 out of 5.  Another bright spot because they left the pork pink in the middle.  YUM!  Ascertaining that they source local farm ingredients, I suppose.   (I assume this because I'm still alive after the weekend).   Dessert: back to 3 out of 5.  Sad.  I got the creme brulee, which came out in a square like it had been cut out of a larger vessel...and instead of a nice gooey creamy center, it had the consistency of generic cheesecake...almost like the eggs started to solidify.  Jennifer's mousse was poorly executed.  It tasted fine, but the texture was gritty, like the chocolate had begun to seize up at some point.  The accompanying wafer with black sea salt, although pretty, added no value to a gritty mousse. Paying the check: 2.5 out of 5.  At a fixed price of 44 pp for the food, I expected substantially better, especially since dessert ended so poorly. Overall: 3 out of 5 Started out well, dived deep into the abyss, almost redeemed by food, but Park Grill sealed its own mediocre fate by ending with sub par desserts.   Should be more of a 2.5 out of 5, but since I round up, they get a 3 this time around.",0.9896,0.85,0.103,0.047,0.502396021699819

We decided to explore several nice restaurants in Chicago and googled Park Grill, not familiar with the area or the restaurant we walked 7 blocks from the Miricle mile in the cold chills pf Chicago weather. And when we arrived at the restaurant is was magical and anything one could ask for. It was below the Bean in the Millennium Park and we were seated by the window watching people ice skate. It was like a fairy tale dinner for me. The service was great, the food was great. The dessert of toffee like cake was just delicious and beatiful, wasn't sweet like most desserts it had a slight bitter caramelization of the toffee cake with little chucks of toffee still in it.

If you like hot cocoa they do have a fantastic $6 cup of hot cocoa.  I am not sure where there cocoa comes from that they feel the need to charge so much but it is really good.  It has hazelnut blended into the cocoa so its quite delish, but really six bucks?   The location is great... yesterday it was snowing and everyone was out on the ice skating... it was quite picturesque.  The snow was coming down, I was eating an over priced/over cooked burger and enjoying a nice cup of cocoa.  I guess if you have someone in from out of town its a nice place to take them to see the park... if you just happen to be in the area and want a nice view... it will be fine... otherwise do not go.  I gave it A-OK based on its location and not its food.  I would give it two stars for its food.",0.9816,0.855,0.132,0.013,0.5464947089947091
2011-01-16,4.0,"I'm rating this place as follows: Food - 3 stars Service - 4 stars Location - 5 stars I love Millennium Park. I love looking at the Bean and the modern sculptures that I don't get. I love that it's so close to the Art Institute. I love the outdoor seating and summer concerts and the ice rink. I love the spitting fountains. I especially love watching tourists and thinking smugly to myself ""Ha! I get to LIVE in this city."" I don't like that the Park Grill capitalizes on the tourists by overcharging for basic food and drink but, hey, what do you expect? The food at this place is just average. Never had a bad dish but never had a dish that I love either. So I'm not even gonna talk about the food... I hosted an event here and was blown away by the wait staff. We had about 80 people in the semi-private area in back of the restaurant and splurged for the premium open bar and a hors d'oeuvres package. I arrived an hour before the start time and was greeted by the head waiter for our event. He answered all my questions patiently and helped to calm my nerves when I had a mini panic attack about whether I should group my party favors on each table or pass them out to each guest separately. Most importantly, though, he ""bought"" me a drink even though the bar wasn't supposed to open for another hour.  After my guests arrived, the rest of the staff wonderfully guided them to our room, took coats, and brought drinks and food. They were also perfectly friendly to everyone - not over the top but not aloof either. They refilled the apps as needed and timed the desserts perfectly. Finally, the moment that impressed me the most was when one of my guests overserved himself and had to be cut off. The head waiter discreetly pulled me aside to let me know that they could not serve him. Then, when my guy tried to get other people to get him drinks, the staff noticed and calmly talked to him out of the way from the other guests so he wouldn't be embarrassed. Crisis averted....well, until he cut himself with his ice skate. And speaking of that, if any of you host a winter party at the Park Grill, I highly recommend using the ice rink as well. It was a HUGE hit with my guests! There is a door leading from the private room into the skate rental area. You can prepay for the skates and also hire someone from to get them for your guests so they don't have to wait in line.",0.9966,0.779,0.174,0.047,0.5885555555555555

The main drawback is that there are just too many tourists and it really detracts from the dining experience. We ordered a few appetizers to go with our wine.

2011-01-11,3.0,"I want to like this place more than I do, and I wish they would give me a reason. Maybe because of the location, and the fact that it caters to tourists, they feel they can get away with offering mediocre gourmet food and still charge the higher prices that other, more quality establishments do. I feel as though this place competes directly with The Gage, and in that contest, the Gage beats the pants off of this place.  That's not to say this is a bad place, it's just that it could be so much more. The menu is large and varied, so that's a definite plus. The food, while also good, does not have any item (that I've discovered) that will keep me coming back here to have it again and again. The service is friendly and quick, which was a blessing when you've got a 2 1/2 year old in tow. On the most recent trip we sampled a number of the sharing plates. We had the scallops, the garlic lamb sausage, baked mac n' cheese, hummus, crispy Wisconsin cheese, and something else I seem to be forgetting. Everything was ok or good, but the sausage (while tasty) was really tough... to the point where I had a hard time removing my fork after cutting it! Ambiance is nice, location is top notch, and the seating is generally comfortable. A good place to come with out-of-town friends, or after ice-skating, and, you know what, it just dawned on me... this is the perfect high school pre-prom dinner restaurant! One of those places that is fancy enough where the high school kids won't feel too out of place wearing their tuxes and dresses, but where they can still afford to spend the money their parents gave them, and where they won't feel too out of place by being a bunch of high school kids. Anyway, just a thought. What you really need to do, though, is come back during the summer when they transform the ice-skating rink into an outdoor restaurant. They just serve simple sandwiches, salads, and whatever they can cook up on the grill, but it's a great place to sit outside and watch the world go by.",0.9907,0.86,0.126,0.014,0.5186772486772486

Though I've been here before, my most recent visit was the Friday after Thanksgiving with my family. The hostesses told us that they didn't know how long it would take to find us a table, but that it shouldn't be too long (repeated over the course of 30 minutes). Not great, but okay except for the fact that they weren't friendly at all.  When we were finally seated, we were at a bizarrely shaped agglomeration of tables that had 5 of us crammed in a corner and the other four spread out at a somewhat ridiculous distance. The table cloth and most of the water glasses were dirty.

Had half of the Kobe Beef Burger.   Had grilled onion and choice of cheese.  This one had Blue Cheese, but not too much so it did not take away the taste of the meat.  Don't know what part of the Cow it was but it was one of the most juciest Burgers I ever had.   No fast food here.   For some people who are used to fast food Fries you may think they were a little over cooked.  But I like them crispy.

My wife and I started coming to The Plaza about four years ago when they had the Thursday WNUA jazz concerts. They don't have those concerts anymore but we still stop by from time to time. I read a comment here from someone complaining about inadequate ""bar""seating and poor service. OK...read this carefully and fully understand what I'm about to say.  The Plaza servers work very hard for the ""few dollars"" they do get. They make no money when someone nurses a beer from the bar and takes up a table that could be making them money. (I've waited tables and I know what the servers are going through when you monopolize their means of livelihood). Also...my wife and I have personally observed the tips left by some of the folks on The Plaza (less than 8%). Shameful !!! All in all,  I've found The Plaza a great place. The bar makes some of the best drinks in the city. And the kitchen works hard to get some of the best al fresco  food out in a timely manner. In closing, I would challenge some of the pompous reviewers here to  try to do the job the Plaza servers do....especially waiting on you !!!

The service a bit strange. Our waitress sported sunglasses. The wait staff a bit lazy in picking up our dishes. We asked if they had chai tea, and was answered, "" I dunno, you never know what they have back there, I'll check"".

The place was fancier than I imagined - white linen table cloths and dark wood all around. It was a little chilly on Saturday, so we requested to sit inside, yet we were sat right near the opened doors that led to the patio. My mom wore her jacket inside the whole time and no one ever said anything about moving.  The menu consisted of souped up lunch options - adding a fancier cheese or some balsamic onions to take the price up a few dollars over a more casual joint. On a whim, I ordered the Kobe beef burger. This isn't a slam against Park Grill, but I couldn't tell the difference. Does that mean something is wrong with me? Or am I just that unsophisticated?  Mom was tickled there was pumpernickel bread and the sister liked her salmon club sandwich and Bellini. I'm glad it pleased the fam, as that's what mattered most to me. Still felt a little pricey for a casual lunch, but maybe this place is designed more for Loopers who are expensing the meal anyway.",0.903,0.858,0.102,0.04,0.6298430735930737

Working a stone's throw from here, with a suprisingly limited number of options that straddle the line between too casual take-out and way too expensive steakhouses, I have probably eaten more lunches here than any other place, and never paid for it, making me slightly biased. Let's take care of this right off the bat. The burger is good but wildly overrated. I can think of so many better burgers in the city, so anyone comparing this to Kuma's and their ilk is flat out nuts. However, the service is lightning quick, and the food is good, not great and little uncreative considering the price, but good.

The flight of 3 variations of creme brulee (ginger, pumpkin, and traditional vanilla) was a memorable way of ending the meal.  The ginger-flavored one was particularly delightful.   Aside from the great food, I also really appreciated the restaurant's elegant-yet-casual atmosphere.  Often, the ""upscale"" restaurants can be a bit stuffy and pretentious, but this one was most definitely inviting, warm, and comfortable.   Would definitely love to go back --- this time, to sit at a table near the windows facing the ice rink and enjoy a live entertainment of skaters alongside the meal.",0.9946,0.709,0.283,0.008,0.5578678266178266

I went with my mother and my sister for my sister's birthday on a Saturday afternoon. We were glad to have made reservations because it was a little crowded, but they had our table ready and we sat right down.  Looking at the menu, it was really hard to decide what to get.  They have a good variety of options on the regular menu, and their seasonal specials were really well thought out. We each ordered soup to start and they were really great. Mine was a smoky tomato soup and my sister had one that was like a chicken tortilla, both awesome. For entrees, I had the salmon burger, which was really good. My mom had a steak panini and my sister had an amazing burger - it is true that their burgers are the best. For desert, I had carrot cake and my sis had a creme brulee flight, both excellent. I really liked their wine selection, too. The service was really good for us - our waiter was attentive, despite the place being full, and they even comped my sister's desert and brought it out with a candle for her birthday. Little things like that really impress customers, but it seems like restaurants do it less and less these days. And I thought the setting was really nice - nothing especially unique, but it looked upscale yet was welcoming. I was also happy to see although we all had soup, sandwiches/burgers, and a desert, plus I had a glass of wine, and the total was under $90 before tip. I had definitely expected it to be more.

The food was mediocre and a little overpriced, but I guess that's to be expected because it is smack dab in the middle of a huge tourist draw. I love visiting Chicago with locals so that I can specifically avoid places like this, but by midday I was just starving and didn't really care where we ate so my bf and I just stopped here. I wish we would have gone back to his neighborhood and ate somewhere, anywhere, else.  We did sit outside and it was fun to people-watch, but the food was nothing special - not good, not bad and certainly not memorable - and I probably would have given it three stars based on that alone except for the fact that the service was horrific.  When I visit the downtown area, I generally take into account that the attitude of those people in the service industry is that they seem to think that you should be grateful that they are allowing a peon like you to dine at their fine establishment - however, this was just ridiculous. Like I mentioned, it was extremely hot and I was extremely hungry so when the waiter finally came, we wanted to place our order all at once. Our waiter informed us that we were not allowed to place a food order, only drinks, and that he would be back later to see what we wanted (um, dude, I know what I want NOW!).  So, after flagging down a busser (who was very nice, in fact) to bring us flatware that didn't have crusted food on it, we had to listen as our waiter served as a personal tour guide to some random family from Omaha or something. Listening to him babble for fifteen minutes to the table next to us was infuriating as by that point, I could have started gnawing on my own arm because I was starving.  We finally got the pleasure of being waited on and then came the ketchup...we immediately asked for ketchup when our burgers came and we were then told to ask the busser because the waiter was busy (apparently he more tour guide duties to fulfill). We flagged down the busser again, who quickly brought us ketchup and then the waiter, for some odd reason, decided to bring more.  So, with approximately a gallon of ketchup littering our table, I had had enough of the Park Grill and my bf asked for the bill. Which took approximately 20 minutes to find it's way to our table. So, more sitting and waiting and waiting and sitting until our server could spare the 30 seconds it takes to swipe a MasterCard and then finally we were off - hopefully never to return.  That busser guy deserves four-stars for being a nice guy in general but the server we had deserves a punch in the kidney for being such a royal d-bag...so, overall, I would definitely find another place to grab lunch in the park, even if it was just off the hot dog cart.",0.184,0.824,0.087,0.09,0.5454092748210396

I figured a place like this was a tourist area, the draw being location rather than quality of food and service. And yet, despite my lowered expectations, I was still disappointed.  The hostess seated us outdoors fairly quickly. Perhaps they were understaffed, because the same guy was serving the same group of 5 or so tables. We were sitting for 15 minutes before he finally got around to taking our order. We got our bread over 30 minutes after we sat down, about 10 minutes after we got our hummus plate. The table next to use didn't get their bread until halfway through their entrees. On to the food. The bread: inside was soft and chewy (yum) but the outside had a layer of salt. I had to rub it off. The hummus plate: Good, chewy pita bread. Hummus wasn't spectacular, but solid. The artichoke tasted like they threw it straight from the jar they bought bulk at Costco. Strawberry salad: unremarkable, it was spinach with some dressing tossed in. And one pitiful strawberry cut into 6 slivers. Really Park Grill? Is the economy so bad that you can't spare a whopping 2 strawberries for your Strawberry Salad? Calamari and shrimp salad: the best of the bunch. The calamari was grilled and wasn't too chewy. Mac & cheese: Kraft did it better. The pasta was bland. When I had a bite of bacon, it packed a bit more flavor. We finished half and left the rest. Grilled peach with cherries, cake, and ice cream: The grilled peach slices (two) tasted good but there should have been more. The cake was dry. Maybe they should try Duncan Hines. Honestly? Aside from the calamari salad, I think I could have made everything we ordered better. And I'm merely a competent cook, by no means a great chef.

Delicious!  The server recommended I come back in October to sample the Pumpkin Soup, to which a local added she comes here just for that.

The big bun definitely detracted all taste from the contents.   Plenty of crispy fries came with it!  The bread and butter was great, and also came with olive tempenade.  Yum.   Service was slow at the beginning as our order was not taken for a while, and we had to ask for the waiter to come take it - not good during a mid-week lunch hour.  Waiter seemed rushed and flushed...and then boom - 2pm, the place was dead.  Ah, feeding time downtown!  Overall, the restaurant seems to be ok to enjoy outside drinks and snacks, and I believe I just ordered something not a specialty known there.  The place is roomy, professional, and a hotspot in the park.  I would try it again at dinner - I bet it's a much nicer atmosphere after the workday is over.",0.9938,0.793,0.186,0.022,0.4633333333333333

They took our coats and hung them up in a closet right by the entrance and gave us numbers to claim them after the meal.  They gave us two kinds of bread with tapenade and butter.

We also decided to split two entrees so we could both try the dishes. We ordered the Kobe burger as well as the English Pea Ravioli. The burger was very good, but incredibly messy to eat, so watch out. I ended up cutting it and eating it that way, since I had grease (or sauce?) all over my hands and napkin and nearly all over my nice-dinner-out skirt. I loved the Pea Ravioli. You could definitely tell the ravioli was home-made. The lemon and mint touch to the sauce gave it a very fresh and light taste, perfect for springtime.  Service was excellent.

This was surprising since the place is usually busier but we figured that it would be to our advantage that it was slow. Our waitress started out awesome, she answered all questions, got our drink orders taken quickly and then came back to take our food orders. Once she had our food orders it was very apparent that she could care less about what we needed. One of my dining companions had an issue with her plate which the server had previously assured her would not be an issue but if it was to get her and she would take it back to the kitchen and brought a new one. When the issue was brought up the server had such an attitude it was appalling. I've worked in the industry and there is never a reason to behave like that to anyone, especially a customer! Now moving on from the terrible service...everything else was delicious! If I could be assured I would have a different server I'd go back. Our appetizers came out after a short wait and everyone was pleased. The soups were piping hot, the salads looked amazing and the tartare spoke for itself. Dinner arrived and the table had many different fish orders. I had the salmon and it was AMAZING. Sitting atop a sweet potato hash and complimented with an apple cider gastrique it was just perfect.  After we all began eating we never saw our server again until all the plates had been cleared and she came over and began handing out dessert menus which we made very clear we didn't want and asked for the check. This seemed to further annoy her and we sat and waited with our check for a good 10-15 minutes while there wasn't an employee to be seen. We began to speculate that she had left since she was getting the 18% grat as stated on the menu for parties of 6 or larger. Her service was atrocious.

So it was a treat to enjoy a Kobe beef burger with gorgonzola cheese and spicy mustard. Along with a side of 'designer' french fries garnished with parsley.  And if you know me well I'm not a wine connoisseur, but I do say that I had some of the best red wine- I think i've ever tasted. It had a warm berry undertone. Delicious. Also, i must say that their imported beer selection is divine. St. Peter's Golden Ale is a favorite and I was surprised to see it on the menu.  So the food was excellent- to my low standards. It's not often that I get to enjoy Bon Appetit entrees.  Service was excellent, although there was about 5 other parties at 5:30pm on a Saturday- so i would say that it was a bit slow. Atmosphere is dim and cold.  They need to work on their aesthetic. Large, deep built-in booths divide up the main space. Creating a 'c' around a floor space where tables dwell.  Heavy,hardwoods throughout evoke the prairie style, but it would have been nice to incorporate the free-standing tables into the built-in tables.

I offered my coupon up at the beginning of the meal because it said to let the waiter know ahead of time. She told me just to keep it until we were ready to leave.  I don't know if it was the coupon or not but our service was a little on the stiff side.  We ordered drinks but no wine and we did order fairly expensive entrees but like I said we weren't overly hungry.  Also why do I need to justify my purchases to the waitstaff?  I was a little put off by the attitude.  No we weren't spending a lot of money but by the time all was said and done we spending around $100 for our meal.  Is that expensive?  No not really but you have to remember I'm with two people from Missouri who have probably only spent that kind of money on a meal three or four other times in their life.   While we enjoyed the views, enjoyed the food, the waitstaff was lacking and that made for a semi interesting dining experience.  Would I go back?  Yes but I wouldn't show them my coupon until after dinner maybe then I wouldn't have these same problems.",0.9929,0.829,0.125,0.046,0.48541620215533243

2008-07-09,4.0,"I was walking through the Millennium Park after doing a photo shoot and was in dire need of some grub and refreshments (and some shade) so I hit the Park Grill. I wasn't expecting much more than a tourist trap considering its location so I played it safe and ordered the burger with cheese and bacon and of course, how could I resist ordering my classic Long Island Ice Tea from the bar. Maybe I got lucky but that Long Island had a fraking punch. Ka-Pow! It was damn tasty and went down real good. And for once no one screwed up and actually mixed in ice tea. I can completely lose it when that happens and you'd be surprised how often it does. The drink is an icon from the prohibition era, all bartenders should know how to make one, but I digress.  Then came the burger. Usually I prefer my burgers, the diners & dive way, cooked on a plaque, fried in its own fat served on a moist egg yoke bun with the fixings. This was one of those foo-foo burgers piled a mile high, but it was fantastic, it was juicy and it was piping hot. Plus the Herkimer cheddar they promised in the menu really was Herkimer cheddar. And they served it with that really thick applewood smoked bacon which is just the best bacon there is. They said the side was Kettle Chips and sadly it was only plain old Lays chips.  The restaurant has a pastry chef, so this means, no store bought CRAP! So I decided to hit the Cheesecake. How cliché I know. But I wasn't in the mood to explore today. I was rewarded. The Vanilla Cheesecake was made with fresh vanilla, so fresh I could see the seeds in my cake and the strawberry compote wasn't half-bad considering the berries aren't from my native soil (You haven't eaten strawberries until you've eaten them from Québec)  I was split on the service though. When I got to the reception all the service staff were preoccupied chatting with each other, not greeting me or other patrons. This is just not good.

2008-06-21,3.0,"I've dined here many times but, until recently, never on the ""rink"" (outdoor bar area).  The menu for the Park Grill outdoor bar is different than the one INSIDE the restaurant: the restaurant menu tending towards the more upscale dining experience; the bar menu more an attempt at upscale bar food. Notice I said ""attempt"". I was really excited when I read the menu - everything looked so good by its description: Kobe beef mini burgers with chipotle mustard and carmelized onions, duck tacos, fish tacos, etc.  Sadly the ACTUAL food was terribly dissapointing: both the duck and the fish were dry and flavorless and the mini-tortillas just disintegrated in our hands.  The Kobe burgers were OK in flavor but ZERO attempt at presentation or any kind of garnish.  It seems that with minimally-added effort these dishes could be really good. But you just can't beat the environment and location of this place!  HUGE patio area (it's the Millenium Park ice rink in the winter), live bands, great bar with friendly bartenders, servers and patrons from all over the world to strike up conversation with.  With locals and tourists alike enjoying this place daily, the people-watching is great fun. If I still worked in the Loop I could totally see this place being my favorite summer happy hour-into-dinner place.  It's places like this that help make Chicago a truly world-class city.",0.9961,0.729,0.235,0.037,0.614

My boyfriend's rabbit was terribly overcooked with an uber-salty sauce. Contrary to all of that, our desserts were pretty good. The butterscotch creme brulee was delicious, although the description of 'cashew baklava' is a misnomer - it's actually just phyllo dough with chopped cashews, which hardly constitutes baklava. They do have a terrific wine list, which is worth mentioning.  I don't mind dropping a fair amount of money at a restaurant if it's good, but this was a horrible waste all around.

The bf and I ordered the infamous Park Grill Burger, accompanied by their infamous (as our waitress mechanically informed us) pork lard ""marinated"" french fries. The burger can be customized with a number of additional toppings for $1.50 each, which is steep, especially when you're already paying $10 to start with. For the price, which I suspect is, in part, fueled by all the notoriety, the burger and fries were decent, but not all that. Park Grill is well-oiled to support the number of guests it draws, but because of it's size, it comes across more like a restaurant factory than a place that's quaint, special or memorable.

We had started with 6 people and increased to 9 and your staff was very pleasant to speak with over the phone about that and accomodated with no problem. When we entered the restaurant your host staff was very friendly and the atmosphere also very nice.   I was hosting my mother in law and other family members and for some of them, it was their first time in the city. We were going to see Wicked after lunch. I live in the city and have for four years. I have worked in restaurants but now run a box office as manager. I am very very understanding and sympathetic with those who have to deal with ""difficult"" out of towners. I usually overtip and make sure to go out of my way to thank my server to let them know they are appreciated.   This is why I was sorely dissappointed in our service yesterday. Our server was extremely rude. I have never been embarrassed to take someone to a restaurant in the city. But I was yesterday. When he started to take our orders he snapped at my mother in law when she spoke ""out of turn"". He felt she was not starting at the right place at the table and said ""I will start with this person over here."" She felt foolish and it was totally uneccessary. Later my future sister in law asked the portion difference between a cup and a bowl of soup. He berated her, his face turned red, and snapped ""a cup is a cup."" Again, I was mortified.    Early on I requested separate checks. I let him know early because I realize this can be a pain, but it was going to work best for our situation. This is when I think he turned against us as he said with condescention ""It will take me much longer at the end of your meal to do this and tip WILL be included."" I nodded politely and said ""of course."" But I was fuming.    Unfortunately, I would never dine in the restaurant again. No person, no matter what position they are in, should feel so resentful that they would treat others like this. It seemed it was time for him to move on to another field. He clearly is not happy.  The food was good, no complaints. The gentleman who was training with our server was very nice and I appreciated that.

The food itself was definitely overpriced for what it was.  I had the crab cakes, which tasted quite good, and the pork sandwich (both are marked as signature dishes).  The sandwich was very greasy, more so than necessary for pulled pork but the taste beyond that was good.  Sandwiches/burgers come with fries, but other entrees are served by themselves (and I don't think they menu states this) and the portions are very small.  Not that I want an enormous plate of gnocci but the person who ordered it barely seemed to have a half cup on her plate.

Good food doesn't hurt either, but situated smack dab in the middle of millenium park and less than a 5 minute walk from the magnificent mile, The Park Grill knows exactly what it's strengths are and plays to them.

(updated) ...  Service here is STILL terrible, and the burgers/buns are still not good (stale bun on multiple occasions, burgers aren't cooked to order and are overcooked).  I'm frankly disgusted that this place gets mentioned so much as having good burgers, when they're some of the worst I've had in Chicago.  The Park Grill and the outside area (Park Cafe) are in a prime location.   The Park Cafe is so bad, though, that it really should be renamed to not have any association with the ""inside"" restaurant.   I've been there multiple times, thinking the prior was just a fluke.    (I'm editing this because I got dragged along--again--and found the experience to be right in light with what I already knew). One time, we paid $19 for 2 drinks, which is fine if they were good.  Their $10 cosmo was nothing more than cranberry/vodka with a lemon wedge, served in a plastic cup.  The Mai Tai resembled that pink wedding punch and I'm not sure if it was even alcoholic.  I told the waitress it was terrible and she just kind of shrugged.  Even though we were at the outdoor area, they still have a very full and extensive bar, we were sitting at it and could see that they had everything needed to make a real drink.  Instead, they gave us drinks that I'd expect to find at a ""$1 well"" happy hour, yet they were $9 and $10. Service is terrible.  The service across the street at Bennigan's has to be 10 times better. If you're dining there, the choices outside are not that exciting.  Everything is made to be easy to make, since they don't actually have a kitchen.  Burgers aren't cooked to order, you can't request it to not be overcooked.  Sides don't include fries (that would require... a kitchen).  The food is served on paper plates with plastic silverware.  I'm all about dining outdoors and can understand the need for plastics, but if you're going to charge top dollar pricing for this type of meal, at least deliver in some aspect.  FWIW, I did try going to the indoor restaurant instead this past time, but was met by conflicting ""yes"" and ""no"" from two different people.   They apparently were too rushed at 5pm to give us a table, even though there were only 3 or 4 tables in use in the place.  They were very snotty.   Please friends, stop going here.  And stop bringing me here.  Even Bennigan's has better food.",-0.6691,0.871,0.053,0.077,0.5422127739984884

Think faux country club chic.",0.6369,0.772,0.17,0.058,0.5866666666666667

Totally overpriced, but it's in the middle of everything!!  And the bathroom situation is really bad for this type of place.  I don't want to stand in line for unisex restrooms when I'm paying $50 for dinner!!",-0.3058,0.804,0.117,0.079,0.5203703703703704
2006-06-15,5.0,"I've been going to Park Grill since it opened a couple of years ago. It's one of the best places in the Loop for a business lunch, and I just took my parents there so they could also see Millennium Park. The burgers and other entrees are great, the salads are huge, and the service has never disappointed. Sit outside for lunch to enjoy the view and people watching between bites! Happy hour is often very busy, and I think they still do broadcast music on Fridays at happy hour.",0.9751,0.767,0.233,0.0,0.6014999999999999

2006-04-24,5.0,Excellent food and a great location. I've been here a few times.  I've had the steak and most recently I had the salmon.  Both dishes are delicious.   I can't get a bit noisy but so do most restaurants downtown do.,0.7586,0.785,0.215,0.0,0.5857142857142856
2005-08-19,4.0,"A great place to go to take in the sights of Millenium Park. A very crisp clean looking interior ,suitable for after work or as a dinner destination. The food is generally good, although nothing at the table stood out as amazing. It is a bit pricy, but that was expected so I ordered the $25 Kobe Cheeseburger. It was good,  not $25 good but really, what burger is? Nonetheless, it was really good and we all had a good laugh.",0.9821,0.693,0.307,0.0,0.5647435897435897
2005-07-24,4.0,"The Park Grill has a home-field advantage as the built-in eatery of the immensely popular Millennium Park. The wait for a table indoors or out can be long, so just try and enjoy the great views of Chicago's newest landmark playground. The main restaurant has good food on its varied menu, though a bit on the pricey side. The interior decor is attractive and the wait staff uniforms are sharp, so it is a matter of taste if you want to dine inside or out.",0.9575,0.767,0.233,0.0,0.6541666666666667
