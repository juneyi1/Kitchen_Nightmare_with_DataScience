2017-09-03,3.0,"A total hidden place that's located in the basement of an office building. No frills type of place that offers authentic Korean eats! Upon my first visit I was feeling a little bit of a variety so I tried the  kimchi soup, bibimbap, and pho (both the meatball and steak). I definitely would stick to Korean when coming here; although they offer Pho, the flavors didn't seem as authentic as typical Pho places. The pho broth was flavorful but it was the meat that threw me off... Back to the stars here; focus on that spicy, tangy, and full of meat and veggies Kim chi soup! This soup will compete with the top soups of there as it has just the right amount of spice, enough ingredients to make it filling, and perfect on a colder day! Their bibimbap also was a hit as it was  packed with fresh veggies and enough variety to keep even the most pickiest of palettes pleased.

This place is located in the downstairs of a random building so you wouldn't be able to see it from street level. If you blink, you might miss it.  I get the special pho, it comes with meatballs and sliced brisket. The only thing I wished was tat it came with more meatballs since mine always comes with just one. The pricing isn't too bad considering that we are downtown. They also serve Korean rice plates such as Bibimbap, bugolgi with rice and veggies.

Deep in the basement of an office building, you might be skeptical of the food here. Interesting set up as one of two restaurants, the other being a Mexican joint that also looked interesting. While you can pick b/n some Korean or Viet dishes, I went with the combination pho to get a little taste of everything. The price is fine for the portion you get. The food came in short order and it was hot. Overall, the noodles were satisfactory and the broth was well flavored. My only complaint was the lack of meats. Small pieces of each and not the same as some of the more traditional pho I've had. I'd rate this a 3 star, however, given the location and lack of choices in the loop, I opted for a 4 star.

In the end, I decided on the Chicken Bibimbap. It comes in a massive bowl that's bigger than your face and gochujang sauce on the side (despite lacking the option on the Ritual app). I know this is definitely not authentic by any means, but the food was very underwhelming unfortunately. The chicken didn't taste that fresh, and the vegetables were lacking. There was way too much sauce slathered onto the chicken that didn't marinate well enough. The service was decent though.

Fishy because they use fish sauce in the broth so you end up tasting mostly fish sauce broth.

Inside was a wonderland of ethnic cuisine, from Korean to Mediterranean to Mexican. All of the choices seemed interesting, but we decided to go to the place he recommended, the Green Apple (which is a pretty interesting choice for a Vietnamese/Korean inspired food court stand).  My friend ordered the bibimbap, but I had noticed that a majority of the patrons were ordering the pho. Knowing that pho is a powerful ally against growing colds, I decided to order up a nice hot bowl to warm me up in the frozen tundra of this February Chicago day.  As soon as our food came out, I noticed the disparity in the portion sizes between his bibimbap and my pho. I had clearly won out on this deal. The pho was sizable, and contained quite a bit of noodles and soup. While the meat that was promised in the order was quite meger, the order did come with two types of hot sauces, hoisen sauce, sprouts, lime, and cilantro (which was quite impressive for food court pho). The soup base was not bad. It was served piping hot, and was strong enough to chase the cold away (without being too salty). The noodles were also pretty impressive considering the location. They had a little bit of chewiness, and went well with the soup. Now is it the best pho ever? No, not at all. But in the Loop for $8 bucks? That's actually quite a deal. My friend was quite disappointed in his bibimbap, which barely had any meat, and was overall a lackluster experience for him.  Green Apple isn't going to blow you away with the flavors or with the noodles, but it definitely hits the spot on a lunch break. The $8 price tag on this big bowl of noodles is sweet (especially in the Loop).

The noodles were cooked perfectly. The broth, while most yelp description has been ""light & tasty"" , I would argue that it's a pretty weak broth.  The soul of pho is the broth and you want to have the subtle hints of cinnamon, cloves, fennel, and star anise in the broth. In addition, you get a small plate of bean sprouts, lime, jalapeño, and cliantro to add on your own.  If you have a need for pho, this will fill your stomach, but not the craving.

2013-10-09,2.0,"Okay, as a disclaimer: I love Korean food. I've had it in various cities for years and really liked it. For the past few years, I've been vegetarian and had no problem getting vegetarian food at Korean places. So I've still enjoyed the cuisine anywhere I went. I was craving some Korean food and came across this place, saw the reviews and decided to venture there myself. I work near the Art Institute so it was kind of a trek for a lunch break, but I figured ""what the heck, it's a nice day, I get to go for a walk, and good food will await me."" I eat a lot of alternative and foreign food, and have found that many places with great dishes are total holes in the wall. So I was not remotely turned off by the modest setting. BUT the food did turn me off. I got the tofu jap chae and regretted it. The service was pretty decent. Within five minutes, I got my order and was excited to dig in. It looked appetizing, but I didn't enjoy it and here's why: I first dug into the salad which was in some sort of lime-green sauce. I at first thought it was kind of good. But the aftertaste was that of spoiled milk. So I refused to eat any more. I then went for the noodles. The taste itself was fine but the noodles were so damn oily that my stomach felt weird and I just felt disgusting like I was just consuming oil, and probably among the worst and cheapest oils with god know's how many trans fats. I've never had a Korean dish before that seemed so unhealthy. Ugh. But I was hungry and persisted for a while. I was also disappointed that the vegetables pretty much sucked. What you see in the picture I posted is pretty much all I got. The tofu was soft and okay. The vegetables were tiny shreds and sparse. So I was basically left with this heaping portion of oily noodles. I couldn't even finish. I felt like I wasted my money and was very disappointed. That being said, I was astounded by the good reviews. Maybe I just picked the one grossly oily, not-remotely-diverse item on the menu. In retrospect, I thought I should have gone with the bi bim bap, which I've always enjoyed at any Korean place I've been to. Or the pho, which I was eyeing. But I decided to try something different and it backfired. Maybe... MAYBE I'll go back sometime if I'm in the area and craving bi bim bap. But as for the jap chae, I'd steer clear. Honestly, there was nothing distinctly Korean about it at all and looked and tasted like something from an American-Chinese place like Panda Express and the like. It didn't come CLOSE to any other Korean place I've had. I understand it's the Loop and fast food but, like I said, it was like cheap, Americanized Chinese food with the word ""Korean"" slapped on it. Save your money and don't buy this item if you really want to eat at this place. I can't speak for the other dishes, but I wouldn't recommend the jap chae.",0.9849,0.739,0.159,0.102,0.5459770114942529

2013-03-26,3.0,"Korean-run Green Apple serves both Korean and Vietnamese food. Of course, I came here for pho as part of my quest to eat pho in all 50 states. The day my friend Amanda and I came, we were suffering in the 20 degree weather. It wasn't until we arrived that I realized this was actually a food court location, and not a sit down restaurant. But whatever, I was seriously just happy to thaw out. In addition to standard Korean foods like bibimbap, bulgogi, and japchae, Green Apple offers 10 types of pho. I ordered Pho Tai, and Amanda ordered Pho Vegetable, at $7.45 a bowl. The food came out fast, within five minutes. The pho came in huge bowls, in fact, bowls that were too big for the serving. It looked kind of strange. The garnishes came in individual styrofoam containers. The first thing that popped out at me was that there was no basil for the pho. They put cilantro with the garnishes instead. This was the strangest thing; I've never seen that before. There's always basil for pho. Everything else was pretty standard. The broth flavor was pretty good- not too salty, not oily, flavorful. At the same time, there wasn't anything special about it. The noodles were great, and the meat tasted good, but I thought it strange that the meat was already cooked through when I got the pho. It was never any degree of pink, and as we all know, tai is rare steak that is added to the pho at the last second so it can cook in the broth. So, that was a bit disappointing. Amanda's Pho Vegetable came with tofu, broccoli, mushrooms, and carrots. She'd also ordered a side of kimchee, which was just a dollar. She said the pho was good- the broth didn't taste meaty to her, which complemented the vegetables. I had to stare at her for a second because she started mixing the kimchee with her pho- ""Is that weird?"" she asked. But hey, she said it tasted good together, so who am I to judge? I was still craving Korean food, and ended up ordering bulgogi to go for my dinner.  That dish was a pretty good choice, though. It came in your usual styrofoam container divided into three, with two compartments much smaller than the other. The largest compartment held the bulgogi, so it was a generous portion. I wished that they'd given me more rice though, since they only gave enough to fill one of the small compartments, and the other held a bit of salad. I had to keep in mind that Green Apple is predominantly Korean, and see that as the main reason for any discrepancies. At the same time, I guess I have to give them credit for giving me the feeling of a full pho restaurant experience - because when I got back to the hotel, I realized that my clothes definitely smelled of pho, haha. Anyway, we went to Green Apple because it has a four-star rating here on Yelp, making it the best rated pho location nearby.

Despite the gloomy weather, she and I caught the pink line and got off at the Clark/Lane stop, just a few meters away from our destination.  It was a good thing that we read prior Yelp reviews before arriving because there weren't any outdoor signs indicating this eatery's location.  On the street corner where Popeye's, McDonalds, and Subway were located, my girlfriend and I entered this foodcourt.  On the second floor of this dimly-lit foodcourt, was Green Apple.  We approached the counter and viewed the limited menu selection.  There were typical Korean goodies including bibimbap, japchae, and boogolgi, but there was also a selection of Vietnamese pho.  Having just been rained on, a nice hot bowl of pho sounded rather decent.  My girlfriend proceeded to order the japchae and beef bibimbap (choice of beef or chicken bibimbap).   The friendly worker took our order and handed us a number placard to place upon our table so that they could deliver it to us when our food was ready.   We found a small red table for two to sit down and patiently waited.  Within five minutes, our orders came.  The bibimbap came first and although it was presented inside a large take-out container, it wasn't filled to the brim as one might expect.  Instead, there was about a scoop or rice with beef and colorfully chopped vegetables.  There was also a side of gochujang, a Korean hot paste to mix with the bibimbap.  Although the portion size was small, the flavor and freshness of the vegetables definitely made up for it.   Next came the japchae.  Again, it came in a large take-out box and only two sections of the take-out box were filled.  This time, the large portion of the box was filled with a huge serving of japchae noodles and a small portion had a few cucumbers and lettuce.  The main star of this entree was definitely the japchae--seasoned with enough sesame oil so it wasn't too overbearing, the right amount of vegetables for that added crunch, and a peppering of sesame seeds.  The small salad was not worth eating especially since there was this fruity salad dressing that it was tossed in. Lastly was the pho.  For $8, there was a generous serving of pho.  It came in a large bowl accompanied with the garnishes of lime, bean sprouts, and parsley.  It also came with hoisin sauce and hot sauce to add to the soup.  The broth was full of flavor and had a very clean taste.  And although the meatball was a typical spaghetti meatball, the slices of beef were generous.   All in all, this was a terrific experience.  I will definitely frequent this place more when I crave Korean food.",0.9945,0.867,0.111,0.021,0.5143481568936114

2013-03-05,4.0,"While munching on a granny smith apple this morning, I reminded myself that Green Apple had been in my bookmarks for some months now. This wintry weather seemed like the perfect time to indulge in a steaming bowl of pho. Green Apple is definitely a spot that you'd only know about if you worked in the building or someone told you about it (or in this case, Yelp). It's located on the second floor of a modest office building food court. First of all, I'm far from knowledgeable about pho and if you told me a few months ago that I'd even be entertaining the thought of eating pho from a food court (:::shudders:::), I'd have probably laughed in your face. Still, I've learned to not judge a book by its cover when if comes to food. And GA is in the same food court at Olive Mediterranean Grill (which I've also tried and found to be more than decent) so I figured it couldn't hurt to give it a shot. I trudged over there in the sleet and slush hoping to be rewarded for my perseverance and I was pleasantly surprised. The order taker was very friendly and there were several options of pho from which to choose, as well as some Korean items like bibimbap and bulgogi. I settled on the chicken pho with tofu and vegetables and my order was quickly ready, with the noodles and accompaniments (cilantro, jalapeno, bean sprouts and lime) packaged separately. Again, I'm by no means an expert on pho, so I'll just review this on its own merits and not compare it to other pho I've had (which admittedly hasn't been much) and say that it was pretty delicious. The chicken was all white meat, and very tender, and the vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and mushrooms) were still a bit crisp. The broth (which stayed hot as f*ck for almost 40 minutes) had deep, rich flavor. The huge bowl of soup and all the fixin's set me back just under $10 and I feel very satisfied. And I'm always happy to pay $10 or less for lunch because it doesn't happen very often. If this is legit pho, then I'm down. Even if it's not legit pho, I'm still down. 3.5 stars.",0.9951,0.84,0.151,0.009,0.5539295392953929

After all, it is no small feat to find good Korean food/pho downtown. Maybe I just chose the wrong dish on a wrong day- I had a bowl of their pho and did not enjoy it. The portion was big and the meat pretty tasty. However, the noodles were really chewy, the broth bland, and everything was lukewarm. Definitely failed to impress. As I left I mentally kicked myself for trying pho anywhere that isn't Argyle, considering I live a less than 10min bus ride from the neighborhood, but when a craving hits, it hits hard. I am reluctant to give their pho another shot but maybe I'll have better luck with their Korean offerings...an updated review to come later, perhaps!",0.7695,0.784,0.124,0.092,0.4231962481962482

As soon as you walk into the food court, you're hit with a pungent wave of grease and chicken skin. Pretty standard for one that houses both a McDonald's AND a Popeyes. With the sunlight filtering in from the windows above, you can basically see all the smoke wafting about.  Wave your way through the seats (which are always filled with...unique people around lunchtime), make your way up the stairs and turn left. Tada! You've made it! Green Apple is the biggest store on the 2nd floor and has its own seating area. You can order a large variety of food there. They have Korean dishes, stuffed potatoes, Pho, AND frozen yogurt. Heaven for a fro-yo addict like me! I have yet to try the Korean dishes and the stuffed potatoes. My favorite Pho bowl is #1, which is the standard beef one containing flank, steak, shank, tendon, and tripe. There's also vegetarian, seafood, chicken, and combination bowls available. Mmmm. Haven't tried the vegetarian Pho personally but one of my friends has and commented on how rich the soup tasted even though it was meat free. I think the pho prices range from $7.45-$8.45. The owner always gives me a free soda with my order! The quality of the Pho is fantastic. As a Chicago resident, I know how hard it is to find good noodles at a good price in the city. The bowls come with a LOT of meat - they don't skimp on portions! You also get a box with sprouts, jalapeno slices, a lime wedge, basil, and cilantro as well as containers of Sriracha, Hoisin, and a chunkier spicy sauce (I don't know what it's called but it kind of looks like salsa?)  The soup is warm, satisfying, and makes me want to stand up and sing Hakuna Matata. I'm drooling right now just thinking about it...YUM. Noodles are light and slurpable. I'm a really big fan of how large their serving sizes are. When I dine in with a friend, we usually split a bowl of Pho, which leaves us just enough room to get their frozen yogurt for dessert. When I order to go, I'll eat half of it for lunch and have enough leftovers for dinner.  Note: when you buy Pho to-go, you get 3 separate boxes: one for the noodles, one for the soup/meat, and one for your toppings/condiments! TIPS: 1) Grab a punch card! They're in a small tray right by the registers. You get one punch for each pho bowl/lunch item you buy, and you get a free lunch item after 10 punches! 2) Ladies: if you go to this food court by yourself, be careful! Wear a fake wedding ring! Don't smile at strangers! There's a janitor here that is CREEPY AS FUHHH. I don't run into him very often, but when I do, it's always on those days that I'm alone. Sometimes when I order to-go and I'm just standing around waiting, he'll come up to me and ask where my boyfriend/husband is, if I'm married, if I want him to take me out.....SCARY. If it's not too busy, the owner will chat with you while you're waiting, which will deter the creep. Or, if you're standing by the tables, a dude in a suit might tell him to back off. Pretty diverse customer base here. 3) You can bring your laptops/tablets here since there's free WiFi! I mean, it's from the McDonald's downstairs but hey, it works. 4) If the 2-person tables along the sides are free, sit there! It's a prime spot for people-watching.

2011-11-07,4.0,"I ordered the chicken pho.  The soup was delicious - flavorful but not salty, loaded with stuff, and a large portion.   The service, though, was a bit slow and disorganized.  I waited 10-15 minutes for my pho. I will definitely be back for the tasty pho, which is so elusive in these here parts.  I might try to avoid the lunch-hour rush.",0.0772,0.816,0.094,0.09,0.5557142857142857
2011-09-15,5.0,"Finding pho in and around the loop is harder than trying to find a company that Apple hasn't sued yet. After a 12 hour drinkfest the night prior, I had my mind on the pho and the pho on my mind. I had no choice but to roll the dice on this for prior to this visit, my experience with Korean pho had been less than stellar. Right after ordering, I realized they also had Gom Tang which is a Korean beef bone stock soup which I would've ordered had I known they had it on the menu. After tasting the broth of the pho, I no longer regretted my decision. I swear their broth tastes like Gom Tang with a few more herbs, and though it was far from legitimate, the broth was stocky and had a good depth that cured any and all ailments within me. Although the loop history shows otherwise, I am hopeful that this establishment will be open on weekends.",0.6652,0.875,0.07,0.055,0.322943722943723
2011-08-16,4.0,"Love love this place.  I had a fierce craving for pho earlier and knew that finding a steaming bowl of beef soup deliciousness would be nearly impossible in the Loop. Thank goodness for Yelp (and for Tom and Angie X's review). Within 15 minutes, I was back at my desk and devouring the #9 steak pho. Mmm. I was also psyched to find that Green Apple offers up some of my favorite Korean dishes, like soondubu, chap chae, and bibimbap. A place that sells pho + Korean food + frozen yogurt is like something I would have come up with in my wildest dreams. Enough said. I still have to come back to try the Korean food, but I'm pretty sure I've found my newest fave lunch spot.",0.9758,0.783,0.217,0.0,0.5324074074074074
2011-08-14,4.0,"Blink and you might miss this place. Situated above the  Mcdonalds and Popeyes, I've passed by this place who knows how many times but never noticed it until one day, bam! As this place is only 2 mins from my apt I was somewhat disappointed that I had not discovered it as I've been looking for a close by Pho restaurant. The restaurant itself has somewhat of an identify issue, it has a few names over its 2 counters. I believe the one on the right is just for pho whereas the one on the left is for the korean fixings. So ambience, definitely lunch-spot type of feel, you can sit there are eat while looking over the people rushing in and out of the fastfood joints in the plaza below. Food: 1) Pho- broth was good albeit a little cloudy, the beef was tender and delicious, the condiments were right on in terms of amount and freshness and the noodles were pretty good and standard. Now just to find Pho in the loop is already a challenge in itself, so I wasn't expecting the most amazing pho but it was definitely more than good enough to fill that craving. 2) Bibimbap- they have an assembly line setup where they put your choice of meat in a pre-made bibimbap container and slap one some condiments. Now at the time I picked it up it did not look appetizing but after tasting it, I have to say it's alot better than it looks, but by no means great. 3) Spicy Chicken- better than the bibimbap, comes with fried rice. For a nice cheap lunch in the loop you really can't go wrong with this place especially if you're in the mood for some Pho.",0.9951,0.796,0.18,0.024,0.6207142857142856
2006-03-13,4.0,"This is a good little sandwich/Japanese food shop.  The sandwich are super fresh and they have 3 varieties of wraps and about 7 choices of bread.  I usually just get a BLT on a seven grain roll and a side of fresh strawberries.  No frills, just a good solid lunch for around 6 bucks.",0.9136,0.677,0.283,0.039,0.46458333333333335
