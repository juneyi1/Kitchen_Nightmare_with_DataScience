They do have specials so if you do go stay on their specials, I switched to miller lite because I wasn't feeling any more heavy IPA (that were on special for $5) and the miller lites ended up being $6... $6 Miller lites for a north side sports bar.

My pulled chicken sandwich was good but all of my fries were soggy and burnt which is pretty impressive because you would think something burnt you think would at least be crispy...

Patio is super cute and a good spot for day drinking with pals. The BBQ is really good too. Pulled pork sandwich ($11) was really tender and juicy. I topped with their house BBQ sauce which was really smoky and delicious. The homemade chips were really delicious too! Perfect amount of salt. The table had 2 extra sides to share: Mac and cheese ($4) and cornbread ($3). The cornbread had some jalapeños mixed in but was dense and lacking flavor in my opinion, not a good cornbread. The mac and cheese is a game changer though. So cheesy and perfect and had a little kick at the end.

They also have two bars--one in the front, and one out near the patio, which reduces the crowded lines a bit. One of the most notable features about this place is their sizable, covered patio. It's well-insulated in the winter, and they use space heaters to keep it comfortable. If you can score a table, this is a perfect spot for a couple hours-worth of drinking during the cold winter months.

Sure, they have a full bar and all, but they pride themselves on their beer selection, and rightly so.  Sheffield's has a wonderful selection of beers. Multiple pages of them on tap. Things you can likely find nowhere else in the city. This is their real claim to fame.  There are several bar areas in here. Try them all. But they are all tastefully decorated and inviting. I have not yet eaten here, so I'll have to skip that part of the review.  Let's talk about where they fall short. First is service. That is very hot or miss. Half the time, I get a bartender or server that is amazing. The other half, it is very clear that they don't want to be there and they probably wouldn't piss on me if I was on fire. My best advice: if your bartender or server sucks, move to another area in the place. You'll find one better.  My only other beef with Sheffield's is the price. It's a bit high, even for Chicago. Plan on $1 more than you would pay elsewhere. But, keep in mind that you are paying a premium for their extensive selection and variety. So, certainly understandable, if also slightly annoying...

We very kindly asked that 1 of the 3 TVs play the Bulls. She rudely said that if we have a problem with 2 out of 3 TVs playing the Mets game to just leave because it's a more important game and the Bulls aren't doing well anyway. She also told us that two other groups left the bar prior to ordering from her because of her refusal to put the Bulls on. We were table 3. What absolute terrible service. Not smart obviously to disrespect the customers that are paying her salary. Also, what happened to being nice? It's not her bar. She is going to ruin the reputation of the bar. They should seriously consider suspending her so she can cool off. She got really aggressive with us and it was only 8:00pm. I can't imagine how the customers were treated after us by her.

Best blood mary I have had in this city. Spicey. Tasteful. Full of delicious garnishes.  So so good. My mouth is actually watering as I write that. 2.  Beer selection.  There are some really good options that you wont regret trying.  3.  Patrons.  In my few trips here I noticed that the crowd is in their 30's and I like that. Makes for less of a ""bro joint"" and more of a ""have a beer and enjoy it joint"".  4.  The food is awesome.  Had the half chicken and it was great.  Juicy and fresh and really really good. The other time, I went with the pulled chicken sandwich and it was tasty. 5.  Staff.  These people just get it.  Friendly. Quick. Clean.  Helpful.  It just works when they have this combo.

It was not real crowded when we arrived about 5:45 and we were able to get a table for 7 outside in the beer garden. Here's the 2 stars we waited over a hour and 15 minutes for our food and 2 dishes where never brought to the table, the waitress said the ticket disappeared. Say what??????? it was 7:23 and we gave them 7 more minutes until we called time of death on our order but with only 2 minutes left her comes the food, well all but 2 peoples entrees. We ate like people who had been on a juice diet for a month and shared what we could with the 2 people who did not get served.  Fortunately for us Billy ran late and we did not miss a tune but it made the experience pretty unpleasant. Our waitress said the kitchen had quit taking orders but we had been sitting there for 1 1/2 hours and like I said it did not look that crowded. I have to guess they get a rush of people coming and going from Cubs games so they should be use to masses or people coming all at once but I guess not. The people who worked there where friendly though and the atmosphere is great especially the outside beer garden area. The nacho app was pretty good made with  potato chips add some other unique flavors like cumin creme and tomatillo guacamole to the toppings it was worth getting again, not waiting 1 1/2  hours for but maybe 15 minutes.

We needed extra seats so we decided to move  a high top table the condiments accidentally spilled off the table. We picked them up and profusely apologized  and was even about to wipe the floor. The Bartender proceed to huff and puff her way to our Table. With the most intense look of annoyance looked at the mess and then walked to the bar grabbed a rag to wipe the mess. (The mess took less than 30secs to clean)  Here is the thing! Working at a bar is like having a child in the sense that you are going to anticipate a mess of some sort. We were apologetic and picked up the items that fell. When people make a effort to fix it and apologize. You should be a little bit more polite. This is the service industry.

One drink was ordered, I refused to give any money to that business and I even said it to her after the drink was ordered.  Another table sat down. So 2 occupied tables in her area.  She then went to the table next to us full of cheer and attention. She went to that table 4x before deciding to check in with the ""outcast"" that was our table.  At 5:44/5 she decided to come back and ask if we wanted food.  So I told myself if talking to the manager made the situation better I would not write this. The guy was the most unprofessional , unbothered ...possibly not even human.

Mindblowing since the inside bar is MAYBE 30-50 feet long and she is a bartender?! She then proceeded to make another 3-5 drinks before returning to finally take our order. The amount of disrespect and rudeness she exhibited towards us actually sent chills up my spine and we contemplated leaving.  As for the food, we ordered the pulled pork ""smothered nachos"" yet they were not smothered at all actually. There were barely enough chips and toppings to fill up the plate, pretty disappointing since we figured it would be a shareable appetizer. I will say however that for our next few rounds of drinks we resorted to the outside male bartenders where we received much better service. Overall, would still not recommend.",-0.6513,0.874,0.048,0.078,0.3482456140350877

I love Bar food and no matter always try to actually sit at the bar . This trip my buddy and I both had the brisket sandwich with Cole slaw and beans . It seemed crazy inexpensive for the food and I think it was around 10 dollars for incredible made on premises , brisket . Your big appetite will be tamed with this meal !

A really chill atmosphere that was packed for a random Tuesday night.  It had to be a good place as we spotted about 6-7 couples on dates. I ordered the Brisket Sandwich Sheffield's style which came with plenty of tender brisket and then their three different BBQ sauces to go along with it (My favorite being the peach one).  It was convenient that I could substitute any side for fries so I got mac'n cheese which was also great.   The unique part that really put me over the edge was the ""Slider of the Week"" that they advertise.  The week I was there the slider was a beef slider with jalapeno, peanut butter, onions, and tomato.  It sounds like a crazy combination and it was.  Not something I would eat all the time but I love the concept and creativity that goes into it.  It was worth trying and extremely tasty as the flavors were spot on such that it went together really nicely but probably wouldn't be something you would want for a full meal.

The patio is phenomenal. One of my favorite places when the weather is nice (as long as there's not a Cubs game or a concert at Wrigley). The food is pretty good - if you're ordering any of their barbecue stuff, like their pulled pork sandwich, they're really good and will fulfill any cravings you might have for sure. Their menu that leans closer to the bar food side of things (burgers, fried stuff) are above average compared to the rest of the food in the 'hood.

The coleslaw was pretty creamy, I would have preferred more vinegar but lets not lie, I only cared about the meat. Topped off with $4 Lagunitas Lil Sumpin' special, I was pretty pleased.

I had the brisket and though it had a good smoky flavor the meat was dry to the point of being difficult to eat. The potato salad was bland as well.  My friend had the pulled pork and commented that it was ""cold."" I dismissed his comment thinking that maybe he wasn't accustomed to barbecue -of course it's not going to be piping hot out of the smoker.  However when I tasted a piece of his pork it had that very refrigerated taste of leftover meat.

I'm getting really anxious about moving next summer as I probably won't be within a stone's throw of Sheffield's anymore, and that saddens me.  The place is an institution and should be regarded as such.",0.9383,0.829,0.114,0.057,0.5237179487179487

2013-09-01,4.0,"It's easy to not notice, but Sheffield's has quietly become one of the best beer bars in Chicago. It has the front bar, smoke room draft bar, and beer school bar, and many people don't realize there is a whopping three bars that all have a good selection. If you are at the front bar, you can ask for all three menus, so it's a mountain of a selection. Every month, they have a $4 deal from a respectable brewery, so those that are more price-conscious benefit as well. Over time, I've found rare/unusual beers from Founder's, Three Floyds, Big Sky, Bell's, and many others. Their beer guy, whoever it is, is doing a bang-up job. Sheffield's can have one of two personalities, depending on the night. On quieter nights, it's a late-20s, early-30s crowd that enjoys good beer, and the music is great (leans more 90s, indie). On louder nights (especially post-Cubs games), it's a classic Wrigleyville clusterf***, with the accompanying loud, bad dance music. The good beer is a constant, at least. As for food, the place is mostly BBQ, with a smoker in the back. The pulled pork is usually great, with a tasty Carolina-style vinegar BBQ sauce, although sometimes you'll get a serving of pork that is very dry. I generally avoid the brisket, which has been dry the couple of times I've ordered it. Cornbread, collard greens, fries - all quite good. BBQ sauces that come with the table go well on pretty much everything. Smoked chicken is very tasty. Burgers are good. I used to love the BBQ chicken pizza, but it's gone downhill so I don't order it anymore.  As for service, some bartenders/waitresses are very friendly/attentive, some are a little more unfriendly/aloof. The bouncer seems to change almost every week, meaning I get ID'ed every time, but no big deal.  They also have a great patio, though I generally prefer to sit at the bar.

Let me start by saying the beer garden itself is pretty awesome.  It's large, nicely decorated, and includes outdoor heat lamps.  It's a nice unexpected oasis in the city. Other than that, this place didn't stand out as anything special to me.  The website boasted 45+ drafts but when my boyfriend and I arrived we were given a menu with only 14... None of which were that spectacular.  We were hoping for a larger selection of local beer.  It is nice that they feature a 'brewery of the month' and have deals (i.e. $4 pints) for that brewery. Our waitress definitely could have made our experience better.  We asked her a couple of beer related questions and she did not seem knowledgeable or helpful at all.  Also, when we sat down at our table, there was bird poop directly in front of me.  Despite sitting there for a couple of beers, she never once came by and wiped it up - There's no way she didn't notice it.  That just screams lazy and careless in my book.",0.9408,0.809,0.135,0.057,0.7030423280423281

2013-02-12,4.0,"Sheffield's will always be a bit of a special venue for me in that it was the very first bar I ever set foot in when I moved to Chicago in 1995. For the rest of the 20th Century I was a bit of a regular here and after a decade plus hiatus I have only recently have made a few return visits. Despite my tastes having vastly changed since my twenties, Sheffield's is still a very enjoyable bar. Sheffield's is set in the southern fringe of Wrigleyville and though the ambiance is a bit drab, it is definitely one of the more sophisticated and interesting venues in the neighborhood (aside from during Cubs games when it is overrun with drunkards). There are three different distinct areas of Sheffield's; the front area is your typical bar with a long counter, some table seating and often crowded; the back room is dubbed ""beer school"" and is a more open space with a working fireplace and finally a largish (at least by Wrigleyville standards) beer garden that they enclose during the long Chicago winter so that it remains functional. Back in the 1990's the Beer School section featured a pool table and this was often my hang on Saturday nights; while the pool table is long gone this remains my favorite section of Sheffield's.  What sets Sheffield's apart and makes it classier than most pubs in the area are the impressive array of over 100 craft beers (with tons on tap) and the surprisingly tasty (yet affordable) bar food with BBQ being their specialty (there is also an array of Southern cuisine such as gumbo and some typical bar fare, i.e. burgers). Today I opted for the pulled pork sandwich ($9) which featured a generous serving of flavorful and juicy pork, a couple different BBQ sauces to choose from and a side of my choice (I selected the cornbread which was more moist and chewy than typical for cornbread, but enjoyable nonetheless).  There is a separate menu for the beer that offers a nice description, the cost, type of serving glass and alcohol percentage (ABV); most of the beers are extremely reasonably priced at $5 to $6 per pint for some really solid beers (there are also some rare and expensive beers available). For my first brew I went with the Revolution Brewery Very Mad Cow. I am a huge fan of beer aged in bourbon barrels and this was such an excellent concoction; really pronounced bourbon aftertaste. I also quaffed a really refreshing hard cider that was aged with cinnamon toasted nuts which also made for a wonderful aftertaste and another bourbon aged beer called No Bacon (not bad, but minimal notes from the bourbon barrel - especially as compared to the Very Mad Cow).  Service my last couple of visits has been ho-hum. Nothing alarming, but just not the most pleasant, knowledgeable or enthusiastic servers around. For example, tonight when I asked our primary server what beers on tap were available that were aged in bourbon barrels she informed that none were; fortunately a friend handed me the beer menu before I placed my order and I spotted a couple myself before ordering. When the food was delivered, someone from our party had to wander over to the bar counter to request napkins and utensils. While our server was extremely pleasant on the eyes (even well before my first sip of beer), she just did not seem all that motivated and periodically disappeared for an extended period of time.  Another cool aspect of Sheffield's is that when the beer garden is open you can actually bring-your-own-meat (BYOM) and grill up your own food in their beer garden. While the beer garden is a nice option on a warm evening, the only beef I have is that somehow there is a loophole in Chicago's anti-smoking restrictions that results in Sheffield's allowing people to smoke there (or perhaps they payed someone off... after all this is Chicago)! Great if you are a smoker, not so much for the rest of us. In summary Sheffield's is certainly a solid choice if you are in the Wrigleyville neighborhood and appreciate great craft beers or want significantly better than average bar food (especially if you have a hankering for some BBQ). Just be advised that despite the superior quality of the food and drinks, the ambiance is only a small step up from other nearby venues and service generally is average.",0.9939,0.831,0.118,0.052,0.5520969711292293

The place was super loud and I had to scream into my friends ear to ask a question. The music was shitty top 40 and the bartender was too busy to answer any questions I had about the beer menu. So I just picked a beer that looked good, but it was awful tasting and overpriced. Needless to say, we were just about to leave when my friend noticed a back room called ""Beer School Bar"". We walked back there and it was like a completely different venue. Different crowd (chill, not obnoxious like the huge frat party going on in the front) and good underground hip hop music. They had different (and waaayy better) beer selections back there at extremely reasonable prices and the bartender let me sample the beer to pick which one I wanted to buy. This bar in the back was leagues better than the front and a real hidden gem. I will definitely be going back there. The only bad thing is that they did last call at 12:30am... which seemed really early for a Friday night, even though they got extremely busy as the night went on.

Step 3: When the customer asks to talk to you, have the waitress tell the customer you're too busy. Step 4: When the customer returns to talk with you a few hours later, be rude.  Say there's nothing you can do and that you'll keep overcharging customers because you can't help the fact that you made a typo on the price on the menu.  Take the customer's receipt and pretend to refund some money (but don't actually do it).  Say you reprint menus every day and that the price will be fixed the next day (but don't actually do that, either).  Keep overcharging your customers and keep being smug about it.

The indoor space was beyond crowded and I felt like I was back at a college frat party trying to squeeze my way back to the deck area! Keep that in mind if you're not the outdoorsy type! So I came here with my boyfriend and some friends after work on a Friday night.  The crowd was good, energy level high, and once I managed past the labyrinth of indoor crazies, I loved the outdoor vibe.  The crowd is 20-30 somethings, dressed pretty classy for the late-night bar scene.  It was the ideal crowd if you're not looking to get wasted off your ass, but just have a good, potentially drunken time.  I have got to say the mood here was great. Perfect for summer.  There are some tables with seating, and then a lot of just stand up tables to convene around.  Most of the crowd was standing.  The floor outside is pavement/dirt/gravel, but that's totally fine for me (I wasn't wearing any crazy heels).  It's got a really good outdoor feel of a deck, there's a tree sticking through it, there are hanging lights all over the place, etc.  They seemed to be a little understaffed, but our clearly overworked waitress was totally doting and friendly with our table of six.  They've got a good selection of midwest beers - being from Green Bay, WI I was pretty thrilled to see Hinterland on the menu!

2012-05-24,2.0,"Went to Sheffield's on Tuesday 5/22 to enjoy some craft beer week specials and eat dinner. Two major failures: 1) Shocked to get my BBQ brisket platter and find that all the brisket had been carved with the grain of the meat, making it much tougher to cut and eat. This is such a rookie BBQ mistake, I was really stunned. Read any cookbook recipe for brisket, even Betty Crocker, and the final step will say, ""slice across the grain"". If you turned in brisket like this at a BBQ competition, the judges would take one look, and hand you back your entry and tell you to come back next year when you've learned how to properly slice a brisket. The judges expect to be able to pull the meat apart with their fingers. Can't do this with it sliced with the grain. For a place like Sheffield's that is serious about their smokers and BBQ program in general, this was really unbelievable. It tells me that the quality management between the owners/GM's and the kitchen is pretty poor. If you are going to do BBQ, get the basics like this right. Now, I will say that the brisket itself was pretty good, but I could not get past this fail.  2) BBQ platters are advertised on the menu as all coming with fries, slaw, and cornbread. This is what convinced me to spend the extra money on the platter versus the sandwich. Meal comes, and NO cornbread. Waitress says nothing. So I asked her later, wasn't my meal supposed to come with cornbread?? She says the kitchen has run out (it's 7:30pm), and they make it to order. Sorry. You cannot put it on the menu as coming with a plate if you can't keep up the supply. Was anyone going to discount my meal because of this??? Only because I asked. You just can't sell food this way. It's bad form and a sure fire way to annoy your customers.

2011-12-02,5.0,"Wow.  How have I not reviewed this place yet!?  And why is this place rated so poorly on yelp?  One of the best, if not the best, beer bars in Chicago.  Always have a HUGE selection of craft beers, with a focus on American beers.  Also usually have something on cask to enjoy.  They also have a ""beer of the month"" that rotates and offers $4-6 craft beer pints.    The barbeque is also surprisingly good.  Great beer garden.  I love this place and go here often. My only gripe: they tried to be a Northwestern bar, but failed.  And by tried, I mean they hung a flag up for about four weeks, and then took it down.  That was pretty much the extent of their effort.  They ""reserved"" the back room, but I can tell you on at least two different occasions there were other parties going on that had already taken over the back room before the game.  Plus, the TVS in that small back room are not exactly the best sports TVs nor sports set up in the city...  so yes, the NU game thing failed at Sheffield's, but there was no real promotion to speak of.  In fact, there was not only a lack of support, but a number of the bartenders seemed actually hostile to the fact that they had become a Northwestern bar.  Now maybe it's because the crowds for the games were small (ie, less tips)- but it takes time and effort to develop a bar into THE bar to go to watch the game.  In a city full of NU alums, there are so few options, and the current locations (which DO make a ton of money from being an NU bar) are absolutely terrible.  Part of it was certainly the NU alums fault - why people want to drink piss water and eat frozen hamburgers at Kendells rather than drink $4 craft beers and in house smoked meat is beyond me.  But part of it is on you Sheffield's.  It was too short lived, not promoted enough, and there was a severe LACK of enthusiasm on the part of your staff. I remain hopeful that someday Sheffield's will wake up, promote themselves as an NU bar, and ACTUALLY promote it, not shove NU fans in the tiny back room, and that I can cheer on the Wildcats in a bar that I actually love. Otherwise, here's to hoping some other great bars embrace NU and take our money.",0.9919,0.746,0.176,0.078,0.4227445740200844

The $16.99 gorgefest begins with a tray filled with a smoked quarter chicken, an inch-and-a-half thick stack of sliced smoked brisket, a pile of pulled pork smoked to pink perfection, and a half-dozen smoked ribs. If you want more after the first round, just ask.  They'll promptly bring more of whichever animal(s) you crave. All of that meat is accompanied by a little bitty cup of cole slaw and a small cube of corn bread.  Both are delicious diversions from the barnyard bonanza before you. I'm a fan of slow-smoked meats that aren't smothered in sauce, so Sheffield's dry rub presentation (with 3 add-your-own sauce options on the table) is perfection. I've enjoyed the Thursday feast five times and have found the pulled pork and brisket to be outstanding every time.  One of the other meats has been dried out each time: sometimes the chicken, sometimes the ribs, never both.

Anyway, had a cheeseburger and fries.  The meat was cooked the way I  ordered it, to a perfect medium-rare, the bun was uniquely good and the fries were perfect, crispy, hot and salty.  My friend raved about how good his beef brisket was, he also recommended the cornbread.  Soooo... I had to get myself an order of cornbread, I also loved it.  It was jalapeno cornbread,  crunchy on the top, very soft and crumbly on the inside and just the right amount of spice.  It was pretty perfect, but the fake butter they served with it was a bad choice.  If I'm already eating buttery/fattening cornbread, why would I want fake, tasteless butter to go on top?

The atmosphere is laid back during non-game days and the beer garden almost full--usually there's one table without shade that seems to host a daring couple for five minutes before realizing that it's too hot.  The negatives:  The food menu has changed a bit--I miss the deep fried cheese curds from 3-4 years ago. During my last visit, I was extremely disappointed by the limp french fries and ""aioli"" sauce. The BBQ isn't authentic, but it hits the spot after a few beers. The beer list specifies bottles or draft and which type of pour (like a tulip glass, a pint). I ordered a 12 oz bottle and my companion ordered a pint of the beer special. They were both served in the same size glass. When did a pint become 12 oz? 16oz = pint, 20 oz  = imperial pint.  Tip: Don't go during or after Cubs games.  The positives:  Service is good when it's not too crowded, but definitely gets slow at night. The beer list is fantastic. If there's no beer book on your table, ask for one. They have some harder to find bottles available. And of course, the beer garden.

I don't have to be a green thumb to have a smarty-pants opinion on those and know I like beer gardens. For a beer garden Sheffield's comes up roses. They have a very big beer list and super prices. The Sumpin' Sumpin' was sumpin' good and very economical. I really liked they had so many ciders on tap and bottle. Yum, is there much better on a warm day than a good, cold beer or refreshing cider? The BBQ is delicious. I really enjoy the brisket but I've been told many of the menu items are aces. The crowd is very mixed: couples, friends, co-workers, and parties. Not too crowded on evenings or dead. Also, yay! The douche factor and btchcraft is nonexistent. The service from bouncers to servers to bartenders is super. The place has two huge rooms, three bars, and the beautiful beer garden. So spacious and such a great flow in the set up. The beer garden itself was awesome. Very big, very chill, but looked nice and well designed. The twinkly lights, flowers, planters, and huge trees added a lot to the atmosphere. It feels like you're hanging out in someone's very well planned (and expensive) manor patio. I wonder if music would make it better though. The right music could really contribute to an already fun time.    Anyhow, winner. On a nice night who doesn't wanna drink or dine under the stars in such a nice, yet casual and cozy beer garden?

I felt like I was back ""home."" I lived in Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia for 6 months and came back every summer for three consecutive years. My fondest memories? The outdoor patios with wooden benches, vines crawling up the walls, trees with romanitc lights strung across to build a green canopy, and the constant chattering of friends. I came here for Beer Appreciation Society and expected it to be more swanky or maybe more sporty than it was. It was very intimate but also open and casual. I showed up in my workout gear and no one took a second look. Well, except for Hipster, who yelled out ""Nice tights, Ericka!"" across the bar. I'm not even there 10 minutes and the teasing begins. It really IS like the Balkans! My Young's Double Chocolate Stout was as thick and sweet as the air that night. Very fitting. It was only $6, which isn't bad for a glass of brew in my opinion. I've paid $5 for Bud Lite at other places, so this was a definite upgrade! And our server was on it. She came back about every 10-15 minutes, never messed up the order, always accommodating in every way possible.

Wow, usually places like to mess up our order. I'm pretty picky and didn't want all that stuff on it, thus on the side. So the chips were good, topped with cheese, pico and corn. Brisket was tender and had a nice smokey flavor. For dinner we got a full slab of ribs, fries with slaw and cornbread. Ribs were good, not fall off the bone tender, but they weren't tough, they were meaty and also had a nice smokey flavor. I tried all 3 sauces. I liked the Carolina which had more of a vinegar taste and the Memphis which was sweet. My guy liked the spicy sauce with peppers, but I forgot the name. The cornbread was fresh out of the oven and tasted so good. My guy also appreciated the huge selection of beer that they had. He tried two different ones, Kipling and some Magic Circus thing which I actually liked. The Kipling was really strong. For all that food, our bill was only 41 bucks.

2011-04-16,2.0,"Long time yelp user, first time reviewing.  I feel compelled to review Sheffields because of two recent negative experiences with them. First things first:  their BBQ is above average and their menu is pretty darn good.  I especially like that they get a bit creative in the appetizer and side dish department compared to other BBQ joints.  Their beer list is pretty exceptional as well. Their food, however, does not make up for the fact that they have seriously sub-par customer service.  I've eaten at the restaurant only once and the service was just OK.  It is best described as slow and inattentive.  Certainly not the worst I've experienced, but I've had much, much better.  All other experiences I've had with Sheffields have been via delivery.  When everything goes according to plan, their delivery is pretty solid.  The food is well packaged and tastes nearly as good as in the restaurant.   However, I've tried to order from them twice in the last month and had very negative experiences both times.  The first time, I planned ahead and called several hours before we wanted our food.  They assured us that would be no problem.   However, less than an hour before we had asked for our food to be delivered, they called to tell us that they were out of ribs.  Oh well, stuff happens.  We scrambled to find alternative plans.  Tonight, we decided to try again.  We used grubhub to put together an order and everything seemingly went off without a hitch.  Unfortunately, about a half hour after we placed the order, grubhub gave us a call telling us that the order had been cancelled by the restaurant.  Why?  ""They are really busy tonight.""  Grubhub was great about it, refunding our money and giving us a $10 gift certificate.  But I'm not sure I'll trust Sheffield's again.  They are simply too unreliable. With their food and beer selection, I'd love to give them 4 stars.  Given their poor service, I can only give them 2.  I'm not sure I'll give them another chance to prove me wrong.",0.9762,0.752,0.162,0.086,0.565371572871573

2011-01-06,1.0,"After reading a few of the recent reviews, I actually opened a Yelp account to leave a review. That's pretty harsh. To say our dining experience was disjointed would be an understatement. Service could only be described as illogical (one particular aspect defied description . . .) and the description of ""checked out wait staff"" from an earlier comment would be fitting. Our server could have really have jacked up the check total by actually checking in and seeing if we needed more drinks. But I finally decided, I didn't even want to spend any further money there. The few little things that we asked for, were fundamentally ignored in our order as well, not uncommon where a server takes your order, punches it in a computer and someone else brings it out to you. Total disconnect. On to the BBQ.  A short sentence will probably cover it:  Undercooked and over-held. Fall off the bone ribs used to be the standard in Chicago. Fortunately, people are starting to understand that good ribs ARE NOT fall off the bone and some local BBQ shops are doing their best to get it right. And that is a slight tug, a defined bite mark, and a totally clean bone when finished. The ribs we had were at least, an hour short on cooking time, and quite possibly more. Not only were they impossible to tear from the slab, once bitten, I could barely rip the meat from the bone with my teeth and there was no chance I was going to see a clean bone on the plate.  The brisket (slices of flat) not only could not pass the pull test; (Google ""brisket pull test"" if you have to. ""Take a slice of brisket and tug from each end. The meat should have a little resistance before tearing apart, but not too much [undercooked] and it should not just fall apart [overcooked]."") but no amount of tugging was going to tear this baby apart. Probably at least two hours short of being done well. The pork suffered from the same thing that the ribs and brisket did, and that is being over-held. There seems to be a timing problem between cooker to table, and thus, all the meat had the characteristic texture and dryness of BBQ that has been sitting either too long or improperly. The pulled pork was so dry, it was hard to swallow. Sorry, good BBQ shouldn't need sauce to smooth the way down the throat (the sauces were serviceable, although un-extraordinary.  The Carolina sauce was at best, a primer to get the uninitiated on a path to a more true Carolina sauce. While vinegary, there were other flavors involved that simply didn't belong there.) Oh and if this were a surprise, the fries were undercooked and limpy and the mac and cheese was a bland plate of paste. What was an apropos ending, our platter was still covered with a lot of food when we finally flagged down our server for a check. Our plates were then stacked on top of the platter (and food) and away it went before the server even inquired if we wanted it packed to take with us. The good news was, we didn't. As we left, I asked my wife ""Did they do anything right that I missed?"" She said, being the glass half full-er she is ""Well, we got a table and they brought to the table what we ordered.""

Thus, I recommend you opt for the take-out, if it's just the meal you are looking for.  Also, while they did have 3 sauces to choose from (really thin Carolina, sweeter Memphis, and Texas with more of a kick), none were to my liking, and next time, I will go to a good commercial brand, or my own. Another reason I was just a bit disappointed was that the ribs were exceptionally salty -- if I wake up in the middle of the night craving water as if I was in the Sahara, it's on there just a bit heavy.  For desert, I got a side of their homemade apple sauce, which was excellent, with great flavor, and texture (think chunky style).

2010-09-15,4.0,"This place was awesome. We made a stop here after making a short walk from Wrigley field. They have an EXCELLENT beer selection. Quite a few too many IPA's for my taste but still, there was a lot to choose from. I personally had pints of the Capital Oktoberfest and the Metropolitan Krankshaft. I was a little upset that the first 3 beers I requested were ""out"" but there was still plenty to choose from. Both of those were great choices, it makes me wonder if there are beers on tap there that AREN'T particularly delicious. After checking out foursquare recommendations I asked the bartender, who was very polite and friendly, what Dragon's Milk was. She told me about it, and offered me a sample. New Holland Dragons Milk Strong Ale is an incredibly smooth and strong stout that I just about fell in love with. Apparently Michigan knows how to make some great and unique beers. When I revisit I hope to be able to check out their beer school bar, the beer garden, and reading under the influence. I also hope I get a chance to try some of that mouthwatering food. The smell alone was reeling me in despite the fact that I was totally full and in no mood for food. I hope to also walk out of there alive after drinking a goblet or two of Dragon's Milk, at 10% ABV there's a good chance that I won't.",0.9963,0.721,0.244,0.036,0.5783143939393939

My Pulled Pork Sandwich arrived cold. It was replaced with a lukewarm sandwich. And the Pulled Pork was more like Lightly Tugged Pork. It was in mostly chunks instead of more like shreds.  2. The potato salad had as much flavor as tofu, while the collard greens and mac & cheese were laden with salt. I seriously didn't understand that.  1.

2010-06-05,4.0,"Dude.  Seriously.  Sheffields is tops.  Not only do they have a beyond sweet beer garden, there's a well above average beer selection, decent pub grub and friendly staff. I'm SO not complaining. First and foremost, the beer garden is a must if you like drinking outdoors.  It's huge, has lots of seating and best of all?  You can smoke out there!  Talk about the happiest place on Earth for Chicago's dissed and dismissed smoking crowd.  It was like the glory days of college bars revisited when I was able to enjoy my Parliament Light with a cocktail in my hand rather than huddled on street corner.  If I had one complaint, it would be that the bar in the beer garden is cash only, which makes no sense.  Why can I pay via credit card inside, but only cash outside?   The beer list is nothing to shake a stick at, either.  We're not talking about the selection vastness of places like Quenchers and Hop Leaf, but they cover the bases pretty well with craft brews like Three Floyds Gumball Head, Allagash White, Half Acre Daisy Cutter Pale Ale and Magic Hat #9.  Beer not your thing?  Rest easy because I ordered up a Jack & diet tall (served in a HUGE pint glass) for a paltry $7.50.  Not a bad deal. Service was surprisingly good.  I was expecting a large group and warned the server to have everyone pay as they go for their drinks, which I think she appreciated, however if you have a smaller crew, you can definitely run a tab.  Our server checked on us often, made some beer recommendations and was just adorable.  Props on hiring great staff, Sheffields! While I didn't actually order food, I'm a bit of a scavenger, so I snagged a few nachos (cheesy goodness) and a nibble of the pulled pork egg rolls.  The pork was pretty damn tasty so I'm curious about the barbeque situation.  I heard a rumor they have a special with unlimited BBQ for a flat rate.  Could be worth a return trip. Wait... COULD be worth a return trip?  Definitely worth a return trip.  I love this bar!",0.9978,0.7,0.255,0.045,0.5351937984496127

The food was good & had huge portions.  Hubby had the pulled pork & I got a brisket sandwich.  The BBQ sauce options were spicy & sweet & very tasty.

The middle room showed no trace of the smell other Yelpers have noticed...it was also unstaffed that night. While they seemed ok with us ordering from the bar and just hanging out, we wanted a server and had to choose between the full main room and the dead backroom. (The patio was open, but we wanted to soak up the blackhawk's playoff energy). We got lucky and found an empty spot in the front. Our server was low-key and friendly and really knowledgeable with the beer. Rather than overwhelming you with their 100+ beers, they provide a 'notable' list with detailed tasting notes. Everything I recognized was much cheaper than I'd seen it elsewhere.  On the whole, the food was just ok. The standouts were the mac'n'cheese(once it was covered in BBQ sauce) and the cornbread. The ribs were just ok, and the potato salad was undercooked.    Lakeview's finest were represented, but not in the majority. What makes this a 4-star place? The detailed tasting notes, the cheap craft beer and the 'easy' atmosphere. To a non-beer snob, it's probably 3 stars.

Oh and the smell of their middle room, was just atrocious.  I can't even describe the smell.  Thankfully we were able to find a table in the back room where the odor was not as strong.   What was good?  Their fries were ok and the corn bread was decent.  The bartender in the back of the bar seemed nice as well.  That is all.  The way my tongue felt after this eating experience and the fact that the disgusting smell of the middle part of the bar has still not left my nose, means that I will never return to sheffields again.  I'm sorry, I really was excited.  I wish I would have loved it or at least kind of liked it.",0.9782,0.747,0.179,0.074,0.5661960132890366

They showcased their beers at a few select locations and this was one of them. We wanted to have a few Huma-Lupa-Licious IPA but once we got in...sold out...quite disappointed. But we did show up after 9 so partially our fault. So I opted for Bell's HopSlam Ale which was great. But for $7 a pint? That seemed a bit steep for my liking. The place was pretty crowded but we managed to snag a table. As far as I could tell there was a single bathroom in the front of the bar with one stall. That was a bit annoying. A bouncer bumped into our table which resulted in me knocking over a few glasses, which hit the floor, and shattered everywhere (not entirely my fault but probably the majority). I was kindly asked to leave, which I complied, I was probably a bit over served at that point. Sheffield's has a diverse beer selection which included a lot from Michigan which was nice to see.

The first bite was good... until I pulled a 4-inch piece of cooked saran wrap out of my sandwich!! I gave the sandwich back and they sent me a good one, but they didn't even offer another option. I didn't want anything after that!

That price seems average, but a bit overpriced if you ask me for what was included.  The special ran from 8-11pm. However, they would not let anyone into the area that did not buy the special, which seemed ridiculous since the people who did buy it got wristbands. I mean I think the bartenders could clearly see in our small group of less than 25 who had wristbands. Even when 10:30 rolled around, they still would not budge. Why would someone pay $35 for a half hour of drinks?? Well 11 o'clock rolled around and they sure were anxious to end our party. They moved the ropes and let anyone and everyone in without warning even telling people they could move our pile of coats that had people's purses underneath. Soon my friend who organized the whole night realized her purse had been stolen and my other friends' wallet had been stolen. Management could have cared less, basically laying the blame on us. This situation could have been handled in a much more friendly and sympathetic manner.

Huge beer selection usually constitutes a high ranking from myself automatically. Unfortunately the wait staff and mediocre food deducts from the total. I visited the previous evening on a trip before a concert at the Vic and our time was short though so we couldn't try all the beers we wanted. Unfortunately sitting down at a side tabe away from the bar, the ditsy waitress assigned to our area had no clue who the heck we were and refused to approach to take our drink order. She must've had invisible blinkers on or something. After 20 minutes of a drought in any communication we got up and moved to the bar where everyone of our wishes and desires came to fruition. I was quite excited to try the BBQ Bites on the appetizer menu and the beer cheese soup that my buddy ordered. The Bites would fill you up, but they really had no taste whatsoever and tasted more like egg roll made of pure breading. The Beer Cheese Soup was obviously cooked too quickly that particular day as it tasted as grainy as someone poured sand in to the broth directly. I appreciated that they grill their BBQ Chicken Wings instead of deep frying like so many other places but they were just as bland as the BBQ Bites and quite undercooked as well. I'd go back for the beer and possibly give it another try for other menu items to give the place another chance and to minimize my dining risks.",0.8811,0.851,0.091,0.057,0.5258730158730159

Its nicely spaced and on a warm Chicago day, its the perfect places to be. The volume of people goes up x10 within 10 minutes after a cubs game ends, so make sure to beat the crowd.  The main thing that impressed me here was the unique beer selection that included lots of great unheard of beers. The service is fast and friendly, which is a great plus. It does get loud and crowded but thats expected for the location. I only had the pizza and nachos there but it was good. Since your in an outside open area make sure to bring your sunglasses or a hat if thats what you wear because you'll most likely have the sun in your eyes at one point in time.

Regardless, I recognize servers make mistakes - we all do.  BUT, that should be followed up with an apology (which I didn't hear) and a nice gesture (i.e., a complimentary appetizer while half the table drools over the other half's food, waiting for a food order that was never put in).

However, the normal appetizer prices are way too high for what you get and the rest of the beer is expensive.  I probably came here on the wrong night (they seem to have tons of events like Beer School, RUI, Beer Club, etc.) so maybe I just wasn't that impressed because at 6 on a Thursday night it just seems like every other McPub with overpriced beer.  If you come here to just try some good beer (they really have a great list) prepare to spend some serious cash.  This is definitely not a bar to come to drink.  You need to come to sample and savor.   The decor was pretty typical of a pub - nothing special to report.  The service was friendly, which was nice because I had to wait for my boyfriend to come so I was alone for a bit.  Apparently they have good barbecue but my Weight Watchers doesn't call for that right now so I'll try it in the future.   I'll definitely go back to give it another go - they seem to have a lot of really cool stuff going on every month and I love beer so this place seems like a good match for me.  I read the description of their Beer Club and I think I'd like to join - it sounds like a really cool experience (beer tastings, free t-shirts, free pint glass - YES!).  I'll try again in the future, probably on a night when they have something awesome going on.",0.9967,0.757,0.219,0.025,0.5768532818532819

There are a lot of different types of people that frequent Sheffield's, which is unique.  The music I've heard is really good, leaning toward the indie side.  The service has been good, and the bartenders know what they're talking about.  The beer garden is huge, although I still think my favorite spot is that back pool table room.

2006-09-07,4.0,"One of the best laid out bars in the city.  Multiple rooms in a brick and wood decor--the back bar, fireplace, and beer garden really add to it's appeal.  Tons O' beer selections here--you won't be disappointed. Beware: At the back bar, I ordered the Scrimshaw Ale which I found to have that 'didn't-flush-out-the-line' taste to it which I returned to the bartender and switched over to the Three Floyds Ale--no problem. The bartender even put a cup over the tap. Later when I went outside, I ordered the Mad Hatter but the server brought me the Scrimshaw instead.  Not a real big deal, but I think they were just trying to unload the swill on unsuspecting patrons. Alot of the crowd was drunk, but I know a bad beer no matter how much I've been drinking. Anyway, aside from that experience I had a great time up there and the people were easy and fun to talk to.  Parking is on the street further south usually--you will have to hunt it out.

I will agree with all of the reviews already posted that the beer garden is extreemly crowded on weekend evenings in the summer. The reason that there is a majority of guys at this place is because they come here to drink beer. Where else can you get a 2001 Eggenberger Samichlaus?!?! (yeah yeah, maproom/hopleaf perhaps...whatever)  I usually like coming here to try beers that I have never had because they rotate their taps a lot. Though if I just want to get drunk, there is always the $2 cans of bad beer of the month (something like Schlitz).",0.842,0.816,0.137,0.048,0.5633333333333332

You choose out of a thick bible-like beer manual that contains detailed descriptions of all their brews.  While a huge beer list is a cool feature, the bar loses marks for being populated overwhelmingly with guys. And no, I'm not just saying that, the ratio was about 5 to 1. Also the back room had poor ventilation, so it got pretty smoky and stuffy. Much better in the front.  If you're just going drinking with the boys, Sheffield's would be a decent option.",0.5667,0.774,0.132,0.094,0.6368055555555555

Face it Sheffield's, you've surrendered your identity for the sake of a buck.  **End Update** Sheffield's has one of the top beer lists in Chicago, with over 20 beers on tap and many more in the coolers behind the bar.  For the beer brave, sign up for the Joseph Sheffield Memorial Beer Society and drink your way through a selection of about 50 in order to earn 2 pint glasses and a Sheffield's shirt, along with a few other prizes. Cubs fans and Lincoln Park wannabe hipsters/chipsters show up on game days and weekend nights, so go early or go on a week night.  Winter's definitely a good time to go--sit by the fireplace in the back room.
