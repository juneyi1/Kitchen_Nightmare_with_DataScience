Was a teeny tiny disappointed in the breakfast enchiladas (Saturday special). The tortillas were not fried or griddled prior to rolling and saucing. And the enchiladas were never baked. Which made it more like soft tacos smothered in poblano sauce. Still tasty. The BF had the breakfast chilequiles. For some reason his dish came out 10 minutes before mine did. I got to watch him dig in and wonder why they didn't serve us at the same time, it was just weird.

2017-09-01,3.0,Came here for a quick bite based on the reviews from yelp.  1. Short rib torta - 3 (bland) 2. Short rib soup - 2 too salty  3. Chicken tinga tacos - 4 soft tacos 4. Full guacamole - 3.5  5. Chocolate churros - 3 very very dark chocolate  6. Pistachio churro - 3 too sweet 1. This was a little bland and dry. It was cooked well but needed some sort of sauce to give it extra flavor.  2. This was the opposite way too salty. I was suckered by the red soup hoping it was more tomato base. 3. This was good. The taco shell was soft and fresh. Best part of the meal. Comes with 4 tacos.  4. They might have been trying too hard with the full guacamole.  The chips were great tho.  5. We didn't like any of the churros. Very very dark and bitter and I like dark chocolate.   6. This was a bit too sweet.  Overall it was an interesting eat.,0.9639,0.74,0.179,0.081,0.4882777777777777
2017-09-01,5.0,"We had the most beautiful dinner at XOCO, owned by Chef Rick Bayless. Everything was amazing from the margarita and guacamole to the short rib caldo to the lavender flan for dessert. We also ordered the hot chocolate, a house specialty. They roast the cocoa beans and process them in house for the thickest, richest, most flavorful cup of hot chocolate ever. This restaurant is next to Topolobompo and Frontera Grill, the restaurants that put Rick Bayless on the culinary map. At XOCO, you order dinner at the counter and the prices are much more reasonable, but the food is of the same excellent quality as the pricier restaurants.

I loved the tlayuda so much that I wished we had ordered another one and had dinner here! I also wanted a churro or two for myself.  The only food that was great was the chicharrones.

2017-08-10,3.0,"3.5 stars. Not super impressed. The food was good, but it was not worth the price. My friend and I came here because we had seen so many good reviews and were super excited to try the dessert here! So the whole process is that you walk in, the hostess tells you a table number and you go order and tell them that number so they can deliver your food to your table. Something that I really didn't like was the set up. A lot of the chairs faced the wall. This might sound silly, but I'm sure you understand if you've been there or if you just take a step in.  My friend and I ordered the Thursday special which was a short rib sandwich, which totaled out to almost 14 dollars. While the sandwich was delicious, it was also a tad small. Each half was about the size of my palm, and my hands ain't big. We also wanted to order the strawberry soft-serve, but were told coldly that it wasn't available. The cashier didn't really give an explanation and didn't apologize. Obviously the situation wasn't her fault, but usually you'd expect a simple ""sorry it's not available because..."" so we ended up just getting one churro and one pistachio glazed churro.  I know everyone is raving about the churros and how great they were, but honestly I'd say they were alright. They weren't bad, but they were definitely NOT BOMB!!!! I appreciated the crispiness outside and the soft inside, but it wasn't anything special. If the food was cheaper, I'd come back, but honestly I'd probably go to Costco to get churros instead.

Churros eventually came out and they were the best churros I've ever had. (The only other churros I've ever had were from Costco so idk if that's saying much.) I had the plain churro with chocolate dipping sauce and my friends got the hazelnut and pistachio churros. The chocolate dipping sauce is legit real dark chocolate. It's not that Hershey's syrup stuff. I was surprised and it took a bit getting used to it. The pistachio also did not taste the way I thought it would. Honestly the hazelnut was the best.

2017-07-16,2.0,"The food here was great, but you couldn't pay me to dine here again. We wanted to try Frontera Grill but got here late and couldn't wait 90 min with two kids, and the hostess suggested we try Xoco instead. It's a terrible concept for a restaurant. First, you have to stand in a very long line to order. There's a sign suggesting enjoying a margarita in the line, but no bar and no one to take drink orders. We placed our order and were assigned a table number. The staff person said he would take us there and then disappeared, but after making a lap we realized that tables were shared and crammed in next to another group. The music is very loud, and it was difficult to carry on a conversation. My 5 y/o wanted to leave due to the noise level while we were still in line, and we should have listened.  We found our table, and drinks arrived in a reasonable time frame. Our guacamole and shortly after, and was fantastic. Chicharonnes came next, and were mediocre. They got soggy from the spicy sauce drizzled over them after a few minutes, but perhaps this is how some people like them. Next to arrive were the kids' entrees. An order is 4 tacos, and I wish the menu would have stated that. They each had one, so we wasted a ton of food. Several minutes later my husband's tlayuda arrived. It was also good, although the optional chorizo made it too heavy and soggy - we wish we'd ordered it without. Still no sign of my food, so I got up to stand in the long line again to order another drink. I returned to the table, and had some more of my family's food. The kids were finished eating and the tlayuda half gone when we finally flagged down a waiter to ask for my caldo to be cancelled. There was no explanation for a 20+ minute delay between the first and last entree hitting the table. They eventually tried to bring the soup out gratis, but the music volume was making my older son beg to leave. The staff took it off the bill.  As stated, the food tasted good. The atmosphere was horrible. For a family, a couple, or a single diner. I don't mind restaurants that are crowded or loud with conversation. We don't mind ordering at counters at barbecue places or local taquerias. The combination of the long line, excessive portions (especially at a shared table), music volume, lack of space, and the entree delivery (or lack thereof) prompted this bad review. It was blatantly obvious that they want you to just eat and leave, yet the entrees didn't even come together. Too bad, because the food was good.",-0.9052,0.799,0.089,0.111,0.4932105064247922

2017-07-13,1.0,"Rest in Peace Xoco.   As a connoisseur of Mexican food (including traveling over 10 times and spending months in D.F./CDMX and Jalisco). Living in Chicago for the past 3 years, and just a few blocks away, Xoco became my absolute favorite go-to-spot - I would visit 3-5x a week (and they are only open 5 days a week!). But unfortunately just like everything else in River North, this place is no longer on my food list.   It is not only the diminishing food quality, the wait or high prices, but my decision to stop going is based on the management and staff. Since Maria became manager over the past 1.5 to years, she has run the restaurant with an iron fist - she particularly has no idea about the concept of customer service and how to treat guests, especially her regular customers. The Xoco staff has made countless mistakes with order timings or providing incomplete or wrong orders - but instead of apologizing or offering compensation/free item (which costs a mere $.20 cents), there is no apology and instead every time we are treated with complete disrespect and with rudeness with a ""how dare you mention we made a mistake?"" It leaves a terrible experience for you and your guests. And this is a consistent experience that customers face. No food is worth it when it is ready well after the time promised, having it made incorrectly, or when the customer paying for the food is treated with such disrespect.   Bayless would be disappointed to hear about the diminished quality of service and customer experience - Maria may hit her financial numbers, but has no people skills whatsoever which will eventually severely impact the restaurant long term. It takes away from the experience to be honest. The entire original staff that was transitioned to Maria when she has started are no longer there, and even a few smart chefs have opened their own restaurants in Pilsen (5 Rabanitos) or in Irving Park (Ixcateco grill). These restaurants are much better - better food quality, faster service, cheaper, and most importantly, incredible service.   I highly recommend the next time you want a $12+ for a Torta, visit Pilsen (just a short 10 min cab or on the L train from Xoco) and get your money's worth. If you don't want to leave RN, go a block away to LYFE Kitchen - at least they will treat you with much more respect.",0.5835,0.741,0.136,0.123,0.5240027036455608

The mushroom torta was really tasty too but this isn't a traditional torta as its served on a crispy sub like baguette instead or torta bread.

2017-07-08,5.0,"A preliminary note:  If you order like we did, this is definitely NOT a place to take someone on a first date.  SERIOUSLY MESSY AND SERIOUSLY GOOD!  Save sloppy gluttony for a later date ;) Beating the dinner rush, we were greeted by a dapper and capable host who asked about our seating preferences while we studied the menu and waited in line to place our orders at the counter.  Don't be fooled dear Yelpers, this order at the counter service model is not to keep payroll down at the expense of the dining experience.  More on that later. First off.  While I was grabbing glass bottles of Mexican soda from the self serve case and considering my options of beer, I was told to put them back so they could give me cold ones from behind the counter.  Nice touch!  We ordered their Bacon Caramel Corn snack as a starter simply because of its imaginative combination of ingredients we love.  They grabbed a prepackaged bag from the counter that magically appeared fresh, plated and presented simply but beautifully in a bowl at our table before I'd paid at the counter and found my wife & daughter.  The Bacon Caramel Corn was a perfect diversion while we waited, was truly incredible and a perfect sweet and savory amuse-bouche to get us salivating and eager to find out what lay ahead of us with dinner. While this restaurant appears at face value, to be set up for a churn and burn turn the tables experience, I can attest that my impressions couldn't be further from the truth.  Checking in on us & keeping our water glasses full, the staff is ever present and genuinely committed to exceptional service.  You can't hurry what perfection was to come from the kitchen.  But Xoco has masterfully conquered fast casual into what I can safely call ""fast fine dining."" So to give credit where credit is due, we ordered a couple of items straight from Yelp suggestions.  The hands down WOW was my daughter's Pork Belly Vermicelli.  The unique combination of fresh ingredients that were hiding under that pretty pile of arugula will probably leave us forever longing and discussing the brilliance of this Rick Bayless dish every time we sit down at our favorite places for ramen or pho back in Los Angeles.  Oddly funny but Xoco's Pork Belly Vermicelli would be better served with chopsticks if only for the functionality of eating it.  We also ordered the Ahogada Torta (thanks to a fellow Yelper) requesting spicy.  The sandwich sliced in half was imaginatively presented on ends standing in a bowl of yummy sauce.  While beautifully plated, this becomes impractical for appreciating the impeccable crusty bread.  My advice, take the bowl off the plate it comes on and set your fresh sandwiches aside on the plate to dip and soak up the magical sauce as you go.  I always weight my stars according to what a restaurant is seeking to achieve.  Seriously, a diner can still be 5 Stars in my book.  I also generally have to round up or down on the 5 Star scale.

I could live on this.  Just the right amount of spice, perfect balance of textures. Ahogada - I feel like this is 2 meals in one - a sandwich and a soup which is probably why my cheap ass orders it.  Regardless of my cheapness, it's delicious! The Pepito, Cochinito Pibil or the Barbados are yummy savory juicy options as well. The churros are yummy - crunchy at times instead of chewy - the pistachio glaze should be served with EVERYTHING! If you order a hot chocolate - understand they are thick... sip it, dip a churro in it, but don't expect a Starbuck's Hot Chocolate.  They are a delicious accompaniment to my Chris. Order an Agua Fresca - regardless of what the flavor is.  If it's Mango -you're in luck because that's my favorite!  All are good... all are refreshing on a hot summer day!  Lainie served me one when Xoco first opened and I was waiting in line, but I don't think that had any input on my Agua Fresca preference.

Bad thing about this place is that they don't take reservations so we ended up having to wait about 25-30 minutes in line for a table. Not a good spot for large groups. The service was a bit all over the place from the start, they seemed a bit confused and kept asking how many people were in our group even though we already told them several times. It was kind of weird that they wouldn't take our order until the table was ready, and we couldn't get drinks while waiting either. So that was kind of annoying but with that being said, we had more than enough time to check out the menu. They have daily specials for sandwiches, which I believe was pork belly that day. Sounded tempting but I decided on the pepito torta for my entree and we shared the fully dressed guacamole. Once we were seated, the food came out fairly quick. The guac was good but the sandwich was even better. It was filled with short rib, caramelized onions, artisan jack cheese, black beans, and pickled jalapeños. Even though I was quite full, I knew that I had to get the churros. Got the regular cinnamon sugar, which were 3 for $4 or $1.60 each. I obviously had to go with the better deal. They were warm, perfectly crispy, and had the right amount of sweetness. I will have to try the churro sundae or glazed pistachio one next time! If you stop by here, do not skip the churros.

Juicy, soft and packed with flavor and the salsa that comes with it made me sweat it's so good and spicy!  El agua de Jicima is so refreshing please serve it in bigger glasses next time I come.

Almost Naked Guacamole $7 - roasted garlic- tomatillo guacamole with choice of two toppings, tomatillo salsa, three-chile salsa, just-made chips. Loved the guacamole but the chips were ok. Something about it that I didn't care for.  Short rib tacos $13 - braised Creekstone short rib, spicy grill-roasted tomato salsa, añejo cheese, cabbage-radish ""slaw,"" avocado. You get four tacos with a generous amount of beef. It was good but the beef could have had more flavour.

2017-06-02,3.0,"You'd think the food is the noteworthy part, but I feel the need to explain the ordering protocol at Xoco, the fast-casual version of Chicago darling Rick Bayless' famed Frontera Grill: 1. Walk in. Get on the line to your right (there will probably be a line, but it will be tolerable). Meanwhile, the hostess will ask you how many people are in your party for seating. 2. Pick up a menu. While you wait on line, a hostess will come back to tell you what your table number is. Only when there is a table available to seat your party will you be allowed to order. 3. When it's your turn, go up to the counter. Their first question will be what your table number is.  4. Tell them your table number. Order, including drinks and desserts. Desserts will be brought to your table only after you've finished the food. 5. Grab free water/seltzer at the soda machine, wander into the seating area to the left of the entrance. Little numbered signs identify each table; it's mostly bar seating for small groups and couples. 6. Find your table. Wait for your food.  7. Eat. Technically there's no waitservice, but if you need extra sauce or whatever, flag someone down and they will bring it with a smile.  We had: - Ahogada torta (""drowned sandwich""): A sandwich native to Guadalajara, but could just as well be Bayless' Mexican ode to the Chicago-style roast beef sandwich soaked in jus. The torta is meant to be soggy, and is served cut side down in a shallow tomato soup that tastes like devastatingly salty marinara sprinkled with cilantro. The mushy bread was comforting and the pork carnitas inside was tender. The soup was so distractingly salty though. - Chicharrones: The type of chicharrones that's only skin and not pork belly. Huge airy chunks were hopelessly smothered in a hot sauce whose tartness overpowered all other flavors. The chicharrones themselves were not much different from a pack of pork rinds. - ""Fully Dressed"" guacamole: Accompanied by their normal chips + red/green salsas. The tortilla chips are the normal, bagged kind - sad to say that Chipotle (when freshly fried) does it much better. The guacamole was fine, but if you appreciate a good guacamole then this was too much, the Guy Fieri of guacamole. Toppings included: roasted poblano, chicharron, onion, bacon nubs, tomato, queso fresco, and pumpkin seeds. I wish we'd gotten the ""Almost Naked"" guacamole instead, with only bacon and pumpkin seeds. - Pistachio glazed churro. A cute looped churro in a nutty glaze, served warm. I'm not a dessert person, but this was my favorite item. Xoco definitely serves up fun, loud food, though in the end, nothing was as delicious as I'd hoped.  Unrelated note: Bayless is another white dude revered for cooking ""ethnic"" food. Not downplaying his expertise or suggesting that he's necessarily appropriating Mexican culture - but remember what it means when we worship him for his mastery of Mexican cuisine. Would the grandma cooking this stuff in her kitchen in her native country, or even the Mexican immigrant planning to open a restaurant in the US, get that same kind of appreciation from us? And if we do appreciate people cooking food familiar to them as part of their everyday lives, do we then fetishize it by making thoughtless comments about ""authenticity"" and ""discovery""?",0.9961,0.792,0.152,0.056,0.514756025867137

2017-05-26,4.0,"I highly enjoyed this spot for brunch! We came at around 11:30am and we were so lucky with the timing. Right after we ordered and sat down, it started to pick up and before we knew it, the whole place was packed! Beware, it's a fairly small restaurant so seating is very limited. There's about 5-6 tables with 2 high top counters.  The minute we stepped in, what immediately attracted me was their guac. It looked SO fresh and you can tell it's good guac by the light green color. The avocados that were used were perfectly ripe - I love it already! If you are dining in you will be given a table number and you will have to remember that number for when you order.  We decided on the Cubana and the Friday special - Chipotle Shrimp, with of course the chips n guac! It's a good thing we ordered the chips n guac since our food took a little over 20 mins to come out. Nonetheless, the food was bomb! The guacamole was SO good and they really give you your money's worth. This is definitely shareable between 3 people as we were close to finishing our basket of chips, yet we still didn't finish our guac. It breaks my heart whenever there's leftover avocado or guac, but we just couldn't stuff anymore down our stomach after our amazing meal. The Cubana was hefty portion of meat (pork loin and bacon) w/ avocado, black bean spread, as well as a chipotle mustard. Everything about the sandwich complimented each other well, however this was a Mexican twist to the classic Cubana. The Friday special had arugula, shrimp, avocado, and cheese served on a baguette - dipped in a green sauce that was perfection! It had a nice light kick to it as well.  Overall, we had a great experience here. I liked the theme and interior of the restaurant, very fitting! Their dessert selection also looks amazing! I was VERY tempted to get a churro or some ice cream but I was so stuffed. Guess that means I'll just have to be back next time!",0.9964,0.799,0.192,0.01,0.48225992063492057

Now, for the torta ahogada I had-- excellent study of the sandwich.   What Rick Bayless did is take this street food and improved it.   His broth is refined and his seasoning- perfectly balanced.    His pork is perfectly cooked, tender and flavorful.   His presentation (standing sandwich on it's ends) and the fact that the sandwich is not traditionally served dipped/fully submerged makes eating the sandwich so much easier.   That said, I still would *crave* a more tradition torta ahogada-- bigger, messier, spicier (heat); and occasionally have this sandwich to enjoy it's elevated status.    Except for the pork, Rick's pork is better, sorry mom.",0.9912,0.782,0.212,0.007,0.5875

Instead of using cinnamon sugar like regular churros do, they used their famous ground cacao beans with sugar. We got 4  churros and a pistachio churro.

We went on a Friday night around 6pm ish and it was busy but there wasn't a huge line. You walk in and they ask you how many people will be seated, they tell you a number for your table, then you order at the counter and they bring your food once it's ready.

They have daily special tortas and my husband chose that, which happened to be chipotle shrimp - also very delicious. When eating some of the best sandwiches in the country such as the Philly Cheesesteak, Chicago Italian Beef, NYC deli pastrami on rye, a good po'boy or muffuletta, etc., people will always tell you the bread makes a huge difference in making a good sandwich GREAT. I've had tortas before on crappy bread. Let me tell you, the bread they use on their tortas here are EVERYTHING. The crunchy, crustiness of the bread when you bite down is exactly how it should be. The sandwich doesn't fall apart with its contents dropping down onto your plate. It's the perfect vessel and the way it cradles the food and sauces, it doesn't get soggy and messy. Their ingredients are superb I'm not downplaying them at all, bc my chicken was pretty damn tasty. But I'm telling you, if they effed up the bread it would seriously make a huge diff.  In addition to our tortas, we shared chips and guac which you can get dressed with various accoutrements - we did it fully dressed and it did not disappoint! The chicharron on top made it next level guac lol. We also shared the churros w/ soft serve. Perfect texture and the ice cream was real vanilla bean. Dipping my churro in the ice cream also did NOT make it soggy. Best churro I've ever had.  Overall everything was delicious. Service was fast, food was tasty, served and plated nicely but also no frills, the place is small but it didn't feel overwhelmingly cramped. I could see people not liking it bc it is a smaller but I've dined in big cities like NYC and Chicago the majority of my life so it's no big deal to me.",0.9981,0.719,0.223,0.058,0.5886507936507938

2017-04-26,5.0,"On 4/21 'Friday Night Fun' we chose to order takeout from XOCO. Best decision of the day!! We ordered a lot of food and everything was yummy at a great price! The first sign I saw when we walked in was 'Guacamole Bar' *Yea* we decided to order the Almost Naked Guacamole, made with roasted garlic tomatillos, as it was the original. By adding only homemade queso fresco , the tanginess really stood out with the fresh house made tortilla chips dusted with lime salt.  The XOCO signature salad is a mixture of romaine and arugula, topped with black beans, avocado, onions, tortilla strips and a tart avocado-lime dressing. The salad was light and delicious and I'll be sure to order extra dressing because it is wonderful! The crispy Chicharrones were a delicate and airy treat topped with queso anejo, cilantro, and onions. I don't say this very often, but the side of tamazula hot sauce was almost too hot for me. So I'm glad it was on the side- the kick was powerful! The side of Oaxacan-style Peanuts came in a cute cellophane package; the seasoning of roasted garlic with lime and arbol chiles tasted just as it looked- spicy salty goodness! When it came to the Meal-In-A-Bowl Caldos, we decided on the slow-cooked pork carnitas. The broth was delightful, containing potato-masa dumplings, chayote, roasted serrano chile, arugula, and avocado. The dry ingredients were on the side so they didn't get soggy. The ratio of broth to product was perfect and I even dipped my portion of the tortas into the soup to sop up that mouth-watering broth.  We ordered three styles of tortas for variety and each one had flavors that stood out on their own: The Cubana (from the griddle) had thick strips of bacon piled on smoked pork loin, topped with black beans, avocado, jack cheese, chipotle mustard, morita chiles, and a house made cilantro crema. It was smoky, creamy, and hearty.  The Daily Special for Friday was the Smoky Garlic Shrimp. The seared, plump and juicy shrimp were smothered in chipotle-garlic mojo with arugula, black beans, onions, and goat cheese. Each bite was a harmonious blend and one ingredient never overpowered the others. The Woodland Mushroom (from the wood burning oven) was easily my favorite of the tortas. As the vegetarian option, it had meaty wood-roasted garlic mushrooms, black beans, arugula, goat cheese, housemade three-chile salsa, and a drizzle of olive oil. I savored Every. Single. Bite. and wished we had ordered two of them.  We received extra tomatillo and three-chile salsas- much appreciated! I wanted to try the Xoco flan, but they were out, so I opted for the Tres Leches Cake as my birthday dessert. The pistachios and oranges were amazingly colorful and the bright spongy cake melted in my mouth. It was lovely to behold, had style, flavor, richness, and was easily shareable.  The Mexican Chocolate Hazelnut Cookie was a good size with large chunks - delectable! Eating from Xoco was a wonderful experience for me and a great introduction to Mexican street food.

After ordering, we told the number to the cashier and had to go find the hostess to be seated where our assigned seats were. I've never been more confused ordering and finding seats. We sat at a small bar on stools and the food was brought to us. My only gripe about the food was the tiny amount of salsa we received. It was maybe a few tablespoons of a couple of types with a basket of chips and no refills. I've never eaten at a restaurant that provides so little salsa.

You essentially order at a counter and then find a table or bar counter.  They will bring your order to you.  The service is very attentive. The staff is welcoming and regularly checking with you to ensure you have what you need. I usually order guacamole fully dressed which comes with spicy roasted poblano, chicharrón (crispy fried pork skin), grilled onion, smoky bacon, local tomatoes, queso fresco (fresh cheese), pumpkin seeds, minus the pumpkin seeds LOL. The guacamole is refreshingly fresh and creamy. I essentially come here for the tortas. I always say next time I'll get tacos, but I keep coming back to the tortas. The quality of the food is as respectable as any upscale restaurant. I've tried several of the tortas and these are ones I keep ordering again and again. AHOGADA - pork carnitas, black beans, tomato-Arbol chile broth, pickled onions. This is by far my favorite torta. The presentation alone is worth ordering, the two halves standing on end in a bowl of tomato-based goodness. The levels of flavor are heavenly. COCHINITA PIBIL - Wood-roasted Gunthorp suckling pig, achiote, black beans, pickled onion, habanero. You can never go wrong with suckling pig! LOL. This sandwich is another amazing Rick Bayless masterpiece. CHIPOTLE SHRIMP - Mexican blue shrimp, avocado-tomatillo salsa, local artisan Jack, pickled Manzano chiles, arugula. If you're lucky enough to be in Chicago on a Friday, you must try the daily special. This torta is bright and fresh with incredible flavor. GOAT BARBACOA - braised goat, Oaxacan pasilla tomatillo salsa, avocado, onions, cilantro. Another daily special for Saturday, but the braised goat is so enjoyable.

At this point I've tried almost every torta on the menu and I can honestly say they're all amazing. But I have my favorites. My top 3 are the Baja Chicken, the Choriqueso, and the Goat Barbacoa (the Saturday special). The Baja Chicken is a delicious chicken sandwich. Unlike many of the other tortas, this one isn't as greasy. When I come here with a friend and we decide to split the tortas (they're cut in half) I always make sure one of us order this one. Sometimes you need something to offset all oil. And this sandwich satisfies that need while tasting insanely delicious. The Choriqueso is a delicious, greasy, chorizo filled sandwich. You shouldn't even smell this sandwich if you're on a diet. But all the chorizo is definitely worth it. This sandwich just melts in your mouth and you definitely appreciate the structure of the bread. The bread seems a bit of an overkill for most of their sandwiches but for the Choriqueso it is a necessity because the grease just gets absorbed. And you still have a sandwich, not a mess. The Goat Barbacoa is delicious and I'm sad it's only available on Saturdays. As such, I've only had it a few times but it's wormed it's way into my heart by satisfying my stomach. The braised goat just melts in your mouth.  Other things I recommend are the guacamole and their margaritas. Just spend the 8 dollars to get all the toppings on the guacamole.

2017-03-06,4.0,"Xoco is the most reasonably priced, laid back and casual restaurant of Rick Bayless's Chicago outposts. The menu here is composed of mostly Mexican sandwiches, soups, and snacks as well as some breakfast options and a few cocktails. A great place to come for a unique lunch. Located in Chicago's bustling downtown River North area on the same block as two of Bayless's other more upscale dining locations (Topolobampo and Frontera Grill). You walk in and hop into line which was short when I arrived around 11:30 AM on a thursday in July but grew tremendously fast thereafter. After ordering you retreat to a table or counter stool of your choice with your drinks and your food will be brought out and delivered to you soon after. Note that if you order an oven roasted sandwich like I did it will take about 15 minutes to come out. For my food I of course had to order the churros with housemade chocolate for dipping since they get constant rave reviews and always make the list of top foods to try in Chicago. I also went with the Thursday specialty shortrib sandwich for my main course. The churros and chocolate were pretty good but nothing out of this world. The shortrib sandwich was very good and came with a very flavorful dipping sauce. The sandwich came loaded with black beans, cactus salad, and avocado which made for a delicious, flavorful, and unique blend of flavors.

And we were not disappointed in the least. Husband had pork belly chilaquiles - the Samuel's cheese was a standout against the tender pork belly. My brother and I both went for the Saturday special (enchiladas with creamy poblano and tomatillo salsa). I had mine with chicken and he had his with chorizo. Both were divine! I even asked for some hot salsa and they went next door to Topolobampo to get me their habenero salsa (which hadn't been prepped for breakfast at Xoco). Super nice of them - the salsa had some serious heat balanced with beautiful citrus. All 3 of us dotted out dishes with it. Yum!!!",0.9833,0.817,0.173,0.009,0.5801020408163265
2017-03-02,4.0,"After a recent visit to Madrid I've kept my eyes open for churro con chocolate options stateside.  Boom! Xoco was conveniently located a few blocks from my hotel in Chicago. Thank you, Yelpers.  I'm a huge fan of Bayless' work - be it restaurants or his PBS show. This business is a great extension of his farm to table focus with greens grown in his backyard and meat sourced from Gunthorp Farms in northern Indiana. As you wind your way through the ordering line at Xoco you can read about where the ingredients are sourced and see the cuisine being made before your eyes (beautiful open kitchen with a window overlooking the sidewalk).  The menu is fast casual with an emphasis on high quality ingredients. As for the churro, they offer a classic churro con chocolat as well dipped options like pistachio and chocolate and peanut butter. I opted for the dipped chocolate peanut butter. I so wish I could have given this experience five stars but the churro seemed to have been fried in the same oil as other dishes for the restaurant (savory dishes). In the end it tasted too oily and tortilla-ish. It seems like this would be an easy fix or maybe someone accidentally fried it in the wrong spot? :/ I will definitely return for the savory options. The environment and price are also worthy of a return visit.",0.9265,0.834,0.119,0.048,0.6059259259259259

I walk in and there's always someone there to hand me a menu and explain the ordering process. Then they give you your spot to sit at and you just wait while the food is being prepared. My favorite item on the menu would have to be the Milanesa, which a griddled torta, or sandwich. It's loaded with crispy chicken, black beans, jack cheese, pickled jalapenos, tomatillo-avocado salsa, and homemade cilantro crema, served with a side of green salsa. Crispy, salty, sweet, heat. It's just a big messy pile of perfection.  I've also had the carne asada sandwich, which is only offered on Tuesdays. It's juicy flank steak, chimichuri, local mushrooms, and homemade crema. I'm a sucker for a good chimichuri and this sandwich does not disappoint. Also, make sure to grab a churro. These aren't cheap bland churro that taste like they just came out of a microwave or a heating lamp. They're crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. And they don't skimp on the cinnamon sugar either. For $1.60, it's completely worth it. The prices aren't cheap, but they're fair considering its River North and these are items you can't get anywhere else.

2017-02-16,4.0,"Despite the 4 stars and over 3000 reviews, my expectations were not unusually high for Xoco stepping inside for the first time. I expected some decent Mexican fare but nothing out of this world. Honestly, I was just hungry and in some desperate need for something to satisfy my hunger pains. Stepping inside, the hostess was very friendly and helpful. She gave us menus to peruse and once we found some items to our liking, she directed us to the cashier after assigning us a table number. The cashier will ask for your table number with your order.  We ordered the carnitas tacos and the vegetable caldo (meal-in-a-bowl soup). They have a machine that dispenses both regular water and sparkling water, with glasses available on the side so you don't need to ask them for any. Once we were done ordering and getting our waters, the hostess showed us to our table. Not too long afterwards, our food came.  We got four carnitas tacos ($12). The tacos have guacamole, onions, and cilantro. They were really good and flavorful. I gobbled my tacos and instantly wanted more. The real winner of the meal, however, was the caldo. Typically, I don't order veggie soups at restaurants since they're usually bland and devoid of ingredients. This veggie soup, however, was fantastic. It had black beans, zucchini, mushrooms, potato-masa dumplings, avocado, serrano chile, and other greens. All for $10.50. It was very filling, and it tasted so, so good. I was very surprised at how hearty and delicious this caldo was. It really is a meal in a bowl of soup. The perfect dish for a cold day in the Windy City.  I would absolutely come here again.

2017-01-18,4.0,"I'm a Rick Bayless fan as I have watched him on Top Chef Masters (he was also on Iron Chef America)! I was excited to check this place out as this place has been on my list of restaurants to try.  Parking: there's paid street parking on nearby streets. We parked by RPM Italian which was across the street. The restaurant is located on a corner. We kinda got lost looking for the entrance and almost ended up going to an apartment complex but found the entrance when people were leaving with their to go lunches. You walk into the restaurant, and the hostess gives you a menu so you can look at what you want to order. There's also a menu on the wall. There's two lines, one for take out and one for dine in. You order the food at the counter, the person at the counter will assign you a table number, then the waiter will guide you to your table.  Food: I ordered the ahogada torta ($11), which is one of the more popular items on the menu. It has pork carnitas with pickled onions and it sits in a chile broth. You can choose your spice level and I chose mild but it was a little spicy for me. I wish the bread wasn't soggy because I like my sandwiches dry. I usually don't like dipping my sandwiches in sauce (like French Dip in Au Jus or Italian Beef) but I appreciate that the sandwich was flavorful with the onions and chile broth and that the pork was tender.  My dad ordered the seafood caldo, or soup, ($13) with shrimp, catfish, mussels, cilantro, and lime in chile broth. He liked his soup but he wished he had rice with it to make it more filling. (we're Asian, we eat rice with everything!) We also had chips with tomatillo and 3 chile salsa. The chips had a hint of lime flavor and I preferred the 3 chile (green) salsa over the tomatillo (red) salsa. For drinks, I tasted the Authentic Hot Chocolate ($3), which had ground chocolate and water and my dad had the agua fresca ($3), agua del dia (water of the day), Raspberry Lime. My hot chocolate was rich but a little bitter, it tasted like dark chocolate. It took some getting used to but I ended up liking the bitter taste. My dad liked his Raspberry Lime agua fresca, though it was more on the lime-y side.  As for dessert, we had the pistachio, hazelnut, and original plain churro with the chocolate dipping sauce on the side. Of all the churros, the pistachio had the best flavor and I recommend ordering that one if you had to choose a flavor. The churros tasted like donuts and were not greasy. The glazed (pistachio, hazelnut) churros are $2.25 each while the plain ones are $1.60 plus the chocolate dipping sauce on the side is $1.25. I wish the prices weren't Top Chef prices ($11 sandwich, $13 soup, total for food and drinks was $36 plus $8 for desserts) but the food was enjoyable and it was good! It wasn't amazing but I was glad to try something different!  Verdict: My dad and I enjoyed our food but not sure if we are coming back due to the price of the food. It was great to try the food and I saw Rick Bayless in person at the restaurant! (fangirling!!)

I'm a guacamole-aholic and this was excellent guac!! We also split one of the tortas.

I mean it will leave you feeling like you are on fire. Soooo spicy! I was very conservative with it but my husband went all in and he was sweating from the heat!

This is the 4th Rick Bayless establishment I've been to and I would say this is my favourite so far.  Better than Lena Brava!  I love it for the service (those hostess have memories like an elephant and they manage the place so well) and the flavours.  Flavours are great here.  This is an interesting concept as it is a true fast casual restaurant.  They do offer table service but you do line up to place your order.  We arrived around 12:30 pm and it was completely packed.  They do pace the ordering so your table is available right after you order.  I do appreciate how it's not a free for all where people are jostling each other to get a table. For $40 lunch, we got the Friday Chipotle Shrimp Torta, seasonal Sweet potato caldos, their new hot chocolate with almond milk, and 3 fresh churros with the chocolate on the side.  Seeing how cold it was, I was going to get a soup for sure.  It took about 15 minutes for our meal to arrive after ordering which is pretty good seeing how crazy busy they were.  I appreciated how the staff here is constantly cleaning and making sure everything is being delivered super fast.  The Chipotle Shrimp Torta was incredibly well done... the shrimp had a nice heat and not overcooked.  I had to fight for a bite to try it.  My vegetable soup was good... I loved the heat and flavour of the vegetable broth.  The one comment I had about mine was that it was 80% shredded cabbage with only 3 potato dumpling and 2 pieces of sweet potato.  I was thinking I would have more variety than one vegetable. The broth was very good though so I was able to kinda overlook the lack of good vegetables.  The unfortunate part of the meal was the  Almendrado (hot chocolate with almond milk) .. it was actually quite sour.  We left the drink more than half full.   The best part of our meal (and possibly best I've ever had) was the churros.  We got 3 churros with the chocolate on the.  WOW.  Hot crispy exterior that had a great crunch when you bite into it with an airy and light interior.  The best doughnut ... even the dough had a nice flavour.  The sugar coating wasnt too much to be too sweet.  The chocolate shot was incredible ... deep dark chocolate flavour without it being too sugary and perfectly complimented the churros.  This is also we had an issue with the hot chocolate as it is supposed to be the same chocolate shot ... we practically licked the last bit of the chocolate. Overall, I'm definitely coming back for the churros but I'm also willing to try other items on the list.  Service is fast and smart and though it is packed, they move tables quickly.  Great flavours and my favourite Rick Bayless restaurant so far!",0.999,0.75,0.223,0.027,0.5914401904012296

My wife and I split an order of the sikil pak (kind of an Aztec-y hummus made with pumpkin seeds and tomatoes) that came with cucumber and jicama sticks and chips which was soooooooo good. Really a perfect starter and maybe healthy? I'm treating it as healthy since I mostly stuck to vegetables/licking the bowl. Sandwiches (tortas) came out next and we were impressed all over again. I had the ahogada which came drowned in a bowl of spicy soup (there were three spice-level options but to be honest the ""spicy"" wasn't that spicy. I can't imagine what the others must be like) and my wife had the sandwich of the day which was carne asada. Both were good but mine was Great (sorry, babe). The torta ahogada is the kind of sandwich that makes you get philosophical about sandwiches can be. The particular sandwich ended up being a pretty great soup in the end too, as I was losing a few bits of the pork into the dipping bowl every time the bread lost it's structural integrity. We finished off the meal with a stunning hot chocolate that I'm calling the best I've ever had even though my wife says it's not a fair competition.

2016-10-25,3.0,"Rick Bayless, you devil you, well...you've done it again - you have conjured up a delicious tasting menu that makes me sit back and wonder at your culinary prowess.  As I have protested many times in the past, I am a lover of all that fantastically greasy Mexican food , but I can appreciate the modern twist that catapults good food to great food.  My curious mind wonders, though, how in the world does Rick Bayless come up with this stuff?  And, how did he become a Mexican foodie god?  I may never know the answer, but I bow down to him.   Obviously, I adored the food so you're probably asking why I gave it three stars?  I'm going to discuss the not-so-positive parts first...when walking into Xoco I found myself saying, ""what the hell is going on"" because we couldn't figure out if it was a Chipotle-type of deal or if it was a sit-down restaurant.  Initially, there was nobody to greet us, but eventually the host came out from her hiding spit and informed us that we were to look at the menu, order at the counter and have the food brought to our assigned (numbered) table.  I found this entire process to be anything but intuitive or efficient...not to mention inconvenient.  It seems that there could be a much better process for ordering food/being seated.  This entire dilemma left me confused and a little annoyed because I so desperately wanted this to be a five-star review. Because I don't want to focus in the negatives, I'm going to woosah, and shift gears to talk about the incredible food.  The sandwiches seem so simple, but they're excellent.  My fiancé and I actually split two sandwiches - the Albondingas and the Choriqueso.  Both were great and I can't choose which I liked better.  Both had a little kick to them, but it wasn't anything to astronomically spicy.  We also ordered the guacamole which was delicioso!  Then, because we have such large sweet tooths, we loaded up on the hot chocolate, churros and creamy horchata custard.  Pistachio-glazed churro - amazing.  Hot chocolate - doubly amazing (go for the Aztec!).  But the creamy horchata custard was hands-down, the best part of the meal.  The flavors in this thing were like nothing I've tasted before.  YOU HAVE GOT TO GET THIS! I absolutely loved the food, but I can't say that I'd be moved to come back here, but that's for a lot of reasons I'm sure none of you care about.  I view this place more as a restaurant that's good for lunch as opposed to dinner, but that's just my opinion.  I do however, think it's a place to hit up at least once!",0.9956,0.76,0.17,0.071,0.5425220458553792

Now, I ordered the Pepito which is a short rib torta with this green dipping sauce. It was definitely well made and interesting. Not a taco, but still good. The bread was nice and crispy and the seasoning was done well. My friend got the Ahogada - which looked like a sandwich dipped in tomato soup which she wasn't expecting.

2016-10-16,1.0,"Astonishingly bad, and a perfect summation of what happens when a celebrity chef decides to chase the easy money by leveraging their brand to create chain restaurants serving glorified fast food.  Xoco is near a friend of mine's place, so after arriving in Chicago somewhat late, we decided on carryout and ordered several tortas and their pozole.  The fact that I received the food a half-hour after the stated pickup time was easily the least insulting thing about the experience.  The so-called torta (pepito) was unpleasantly reminiscent of those frozen ""pizzas"" warmed for throngs of hungry schoolkids during the 1990s.  While said pizzas were elevated to haute cuisine in the food desert of the high school cafeteria, I wouldn't expect to find them reincarnated in an establishment bearing the imprimatur of Mr. Bayless. Sadly, it could be argued that the Bayless torta actually pales in comparison to the school cafeteria pizza slice.  The latter succeeds through a sort of minimalism in which the unsophisticated  palate is appeased by a formula comprised of 95% carbs (that ""dough"" which never seemed to be able to completely lose its frozen quality), 3% cheese, 2% of the thinnest sauce imaginable, and then 1% pepperoni (typically one slice, never more than two).  It's quick and dirty and meets nutritional requirements if they were to be set forth by your average 12 year-old.  The appalling Xoco torta seems to have decided to take the opposite approach in that it exponentially increases the sludge comprising the aforementioned 5% of ingredients (sauce, meat, and cheese, essentially).  Therein lies the brilliance of Xoco (at least from the bottom-line point of view of the proprietor):  it has figured out how to pass off industrial waste as higher-concept, casual ""Mexican"" fare (though it's disgraceful to associate it with anything remotely Mexican, particularly in Chicago) as a means of extorting tourists and, apparently, a significant number of locals who should really know better.  Oh--I think I also mentioned pozole. I can't really comment on this because whatever flavor may have existed in the broth was obscured by the fact that they seem to have dissolved an entire block of salt in it. TLDR: Avoid and dine at your local school cafeteria instead.",0.8081,0.827,0.098,0.075,0.44867521367521374

They also have an eating area outside incase they are packed indoors. My wife and I stopped by Friday night about an hour before closing. We were concerned about the quality of food due to us showing up at this time.  Once we entered we really didn't know how everything worked. So I spoke to someone who was helping another customer, and they got me in touch with the hostess. While in line to order she gave us a table number and we placed our order with a really nice young lady. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and had a great personality. Our food choices are below.  Chips & Salsa + Guac: The chips were freaking delicious. The texture and crunch was nice. With the chips we received a green and red salsa. Both were slightly different in flavor and not spicy at all. I'm sure they have spicier salsa but we didn't really check. Now the Guac, oh man. Not only is there fresh made Guac, they had a variety of things that enhanced the flavor. You had queso fresco, onions, tomatoes, and much more. You could also get I believe bacon as well but we do not eat pork.  Pepido Torta: This is a Hispanic sandwich and there are usually several versions. This one was made of short rib meat and basically looked like barbacoa. The bread of the sandwich was a little too crunchy for my liking. The beef was delicious and the toppings were minimal and complimented each other very very well.  Churros w/chocolate sauce: Let's put it this way, I ordered this for myself and had to split half with my wife. These churros were warm and the chocolate sauce tasted amazing. I was basically dipping the churro and trying to get as much sauce on it to eat. The crunch and softness was very well balanced.  Cuatro Leches Cake: Traditionally we see this cake wet and with a layer of sauce at the base. This was different and delicious.

She ordered the MILANESA (torta/sandwich) crispy Gunthorp chicken, artisan Jack cheese, pickled jalapeños, red onions, Napa cabbage, tomatillo/avocado salsa, black beans. Not as spicy as expected, but flavorful nonetheless. Fresh ingredients will do that. We shared: the CHIPS & SALSA which were served with tomatillo salsa, 3-chile salsa, just made chips. ...CHICHARRONES served with Tamazula hot sauce, queso añejo, onion, cilantro, lime. (Could have been a little crunchier for my taste) ... and finally the ALMOST NAKED roasted garlic tomatillo Guacamole with the choice of two toppings (we opted for the chicharron and Mexican cheese).

We had grown accustomed to long wait times at all the restaurants on our list so it was a pleasant surprise to walk into a restaurant with plenty of seating and no wait. A window on the exterior shows the chef's working their magic with chocolate to lure you in from the sidewalk. Xoco is short for chocolate, in case you didn't make that connection (like me) I was sold on the Chorizo Empanada from looking at the menu online, but torn between the chocolate Cappuccino and the Authentic. When I asked the cashier what she recommended, she said the Cappuccino but gave me a small sample of the Authentic to try too! You order at the front, are given a number, and then sit at the table associated with your number. So although there were plenty of seats available, we were assigned to sit on bar stools next to the front door. The hostess that helped us find our seat was very friendly, felt like she was welcoming us into her home (if her home was a Chipotle?). The busboy checked in frequently to take any dishes we had finished. I didn't so much like my Empanada, it had too many spices (not like spicy, but too heavy on the cumin/chili powder). I tried to make do by dousing it with salsa. My boyfriend had ordered the steak and egg torta and was willing to share so I traded him halfway through. We both liked the drinks but felt like they were a little too sweet-- particularly the chocolate that sank to the bottom on both.  Oh, and we got a chocolate churro to share too.

My friend and I decided to go for an early dinner to Xoco around 4 pm on a Tuesday, which was my first time there having past it many times.  It was pleasant and quiet during that time of day and the host at the door greeted us politely and welcomed us in explaining how ordering worked.  We went to order and we had seen the menu online ahead of time so we knew what we wanted.  I ordered the Ahogada sandwich and my friend ordered the Cubano.  We asked for the drink of the day and the cashier immediately gave us a sample.  It was a lime mint drink.  It was really good so we ordered one.  We went to sit down and she had a small 9 month old in a stroller and they were polite and offered her a high chair.  The bathroom was also child friendly and had a changing table.   Our food came and I highly recommend the Ahogada.  I ordered it medium spicy, the cashier said if I liked hot but not too hot, then I would enjoy it and he was right.  Had I gotten the hottest I don't think I would have enjoyed it. If you don't like heat then I would definitely get the mild.  The cashier was super helpful in knowing what I wanted.  The chips and salsa are exactly the same ones that he has at Frontera Grill. Small salsa with the chips, but he packs soooo much flavor in such small bowls of salsa!  As we were finishing our meal, I looked up, and saw Chef himself walking right past our table in front of me! He was wearing his chef coat and I couldn't believe it as it happened so fast.  I was somewhat starstruck and was really glad we went when we did.  I also noticed how the host kept cleaning and cleaning windows as we sat and ate...perhaps they knew Chef was stopping by?!  Either way, I would definitely go again, and as I have seen it get packed later in the eve, I would probably go around the same time.  It started getting busier as we started to leave but I WILL be back.  Perhaps next time I'll consider trying some breakfast as the menu for that looked really good.

We were handed menus and honestly, there was like 5 things I could have ordered and loved. I've never seen a Mexican place with so many torta options! Such a great spin on a cuisine that is usually tacos and enchiladas, beans and rice (which I love, but Xoco was a fun and unique spin!).  We ordered:  - naked guacamole with queso fresco ($7) and comes with plenty of chips and salsa. I'm more of a purist so I like my guac a little more simple than their loaded version, but the naked guac was so good! Big chunks of avocado, great flavor. The chips!! Crispy and a little chewy, sometimes. Freshly made, warm, amazing. I loved the green salsa, too!  - Cubana. Torta with roasted pork loin, bacon, black bean spread, chipotle mustard, jack cheese, avocado. This sandwich was to die for! Each bite was packed full of flavor - the smokiness was perfection paired with the creamy avocado and spicy chipotle. Yum. Yum. Yum.  - Ahogada. Torta with carnitas, pickled onions, black beans, & chile sauce, served in a bowl of tomato both (literally drowned!

The chocolate was thick and gritty and not what we expected at all. On top of the disappointing food, the place is tiny and poorly laid out.

However, the jovial menu angel greeted us as soon as we walked in and sent us on our way with menus in hand so we'd be  ready to order as soon as we hit the register. We went simple... Hot classic chocolates and churros and chocolate, ordered to-go (I need to point out that the lovely being at the register was very pleasant and jolly despite the chaos in the restaurant). The spouse and I ducked under a bus stop and I immediately lost all need for meaningful relationships and social interactions the second that chocolate entered my yap. Liquid love. Fluid Salvation. I'm no fancy chocolate expert and I realize they make their own chocolate magically happen through whatever means (tiny elves? Magical spells? Trafficked workers?? Whatever it is, do more of it!).  All I know is this... Thick, smooth, rich lava flows of molten chocolate make life more dreamy.

Love this little touch, as I often suffer from table-snagging anxiety.  LOVED the Oaxacan menu, just different enough from run-of-the-mill Mexican, but still familiar and comforting with all those spicy flavors. I had the pozole soup, a meal-sized bowl, pleasantly too big to finish. For dessert, the Oaxacan chocolate soft serve with cajeta sauce and chocolate crumbles.  Cool that they serve beer, wine, and cocktails on tap - keeping with the ""fast"" casual theme.

It was unique in that it's a fairly small restaurant but despite being busy ran smoothly. With it being our first time there we appreciated the gentleman who was guiding the traffic flow at the door. He promptly handed us a menu and pointed out a few signature dishes he recommended. Because we were eating in he told us our table number that we then conveyed to the cashier when we were ready to order. The cashier was also very informative and guided us in making our selections. I had nonalcoholic raspberry drink (since I'm drinking for two). My husband and I split the chips and salsa for an appetizer. We ordered the Ahogada which reminded me of a Mexican version of a French dip sandwich with pork carnitas for the meat and a spicy tomato based soup. The carnitas sandwich was actually served in the soup which sounds weird but was delish. The other entree we ordered was the cubana torta  made with melt in your mouth pork loin and bacon. Make sure you dip this in the chipotle mustard they bring with it. So so good. We finished our meal with the churros. They were the perfect finish to our meal. Whether dining in or carrying out...

2016-05-11,3.0,"2.5 stars. Tried out the Ahogada as well as the Baja Chicken, and also ordered a Pistachio Churro and Flan Cake as a dessert(appetizer?). First impressions; strange mixture been fast casual dining and an actual sit-down restaurant. It looks like it's set up to be a Panera, except that you're greeted at the door and as you're in line to order, a server will come to reserve a table for you. Makes the place a little more crowded than necessary, but eh I'll let it slide. Given that this restaurant is the cheapest in the Rick Bayless chain I was pretty excited to actually try out some of his food that was actually in my price range. Upon arrival, was a little disappointed at the size of the sandwiches. For $10-12 each, I suppose I expected something a little bit more substantial. But I'll hold judgment till first bite. The Chicken Baja upon first bite was actually quite good. If only because I was able to actually get some of the very flavorful chicken in that bite. Unfortunately the ratio of the sandwhich was a very heavy toward bread, and there just wasn't enough filling in there to really make it worth it. Too bad, it was some tasty torta otherwise(when it was just a bite of bread anyways). As for the Ahogada, this one was actually a bit more substantial and had a decent amount of carnitas inside. That said, didn't enjoy the flavor as much as the Baja chicken and the pickled white onions actually had a sourness that rather overpowered the rest of the torta, even with the tomato broth. The carnitas on their own tasted alright as well, but I don't know if I'd go out of my way to get them again. The Flan cake and Churros tasted good. Actually a big fan of the pistachio glaze and flavor, though the churro itself could have been warmer on delivery.  Verdict: Underwhelming. Has some decent flavors here, though the Tortas really need some more filling in them to make them worth their price.",0.9752,0.829,0.126,0.045,0.49370748299319744

Not any better than whole foods/chipotle guac  Chips- fine Coctel rojo- The sauce was very tasty. It was almost sweet/tangy but spicy at the same time. The shrimp/scallops were fresh. This came with a ton of chips. Between the chips that came with this and the chips that came with our guac, we had more than enough chips. Salsas- Good. I know these salsa are popular but I like pico de gallo and chunkier salsas with chips Seafood Caldo- lacking in flavor. The seafood was very fresh, but the broth needed something. It was such a bright red broth that I was thinking it would be packed with heat/flavor, but there wasn't much. Pork Loin sandwich- this was very tasty. We enjoyed this. The meat was well marinated and the cheese complemented it well. Margaritas- okay. for 10 dollars, I was underwhelmed. They were small, barely cold, not much salt on the rim.

I was happy to not encounter much of a wait upon arrival! Overall, we were really happy with the flavors of the dish. Him and I both ordered the Ahogada torta. The pork was incredibly savory and tender. I compared this sandwich to a Mexican take on a French dip as it is served in a tasty broth. It was really filling and flavorful. The reason that I docked a star is my boyfriend found a small bone in his sandwich when we were almost done eating and that aspect was less than appetizing. They have a great beer selection. I started with a margarita but switched to beer...I thought the marg was just ok, nothing special to provoke me to order another one.  One thing to keep in mind is the ordering system is a little confusing when you first walk in. It's fast-casual style and you order and pay at the front, then they bring you your food. I also think complementary chips and salsa would take this restaurant to the next level.

2016-04-27,2.0,"I've been coming to Xoco about twice a year since it opened.  The food is great, so I'd come much more often, but they always make it such a hassle by forcing you to stand around for an inordinate amount of time waiting for your food.  They're staffed at a high level and nothing on the menu takes more than a few minutes to put together, so there's no excuse.  Yet, even during slow periods, you wait and wait and wait.  Plus, the room is set up so that there is no good place to stand.   I recently tried to avoid the wait by using their on-line service for pick-up orders.  I placed my order between breakfast and lunch so there would be no delay caused by a slammed kitchen.  I also ordered only 4 simple items.  The ordering process was quick and painless.  They sent two e-mails:  the first saying that they processed the payment and the second providing a pickup time.  Seems like there would be absolutely no reason to wait if you use this system...but things aren't always what they seem.   I got the first e-mail right away and the second e-mail less than 5 minutes later.  So far, so good.  The pickup time was 15 minutes after I placed my order, which is convenient for me, since my office is about a 10 minute walk away.  Not a single reason in the world why they couldn't have my order packaged and ready to go in 15 minutes, especially since they themselves picked that time for me to arrive.   Needless to say, my order was not ready in 15 minutes...or in 20 minutes...or even in 30 minutes.  It took them almost 40 minutes for 4 items during an off-hour, missing the pickup time that THEY SET by a wide margin.  They provided zero explanation for the delay.  They just told me that it ""isn't ready yet.""  In the amount of time that I stood around waiting for my order, I could have placed a second order in person and probably would have received it sooner, completely defeating the point of pre-ordering carryout.   Delays like this were excusable when Xoco first opened in 2009, but it's ridiculous that they can't do better after being in business for over 5 years.",-0.5304,0.838,0.077,0.085,0.4503835978835979

2016-04-12,3.0,"Since I'm a big fan of frontera in the Chicago airport, I have been wanting to try xoco for years and unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype. We came on a weekday evening and had to wait about 15 minutes to get a table for a party of 5 even though we kind of beat the rush.  You wait in line and are given a table number. You then place your order at the counter and they bring the food out to you. They will hold dessert until you've finished up your entree.  We had the ahogada and pork belly noodle soup. The ahogada is a pork sandwich that is placed in a bowl of thick tomato based soup. Presentation is beautiful but the mixture of flavors were a little weird for me. It could also be that I don't like soggy sandwiches and would have preferred to have the sandwich and sauce/soup separate.  The pork belly soup has pork belly, mushroom, avocado, zucchini, and some bitter greens. The salsa negra is a spicy hoisin sauce. For people familiar with Vietnamese food, this is a Spanish American version of ""bun bo hue"" or spicy beef noodle soup. The dish is ok but I think it could use more noodles and less of the greens because of the bitter taste. The thing that really killed this dish for me was that I found a dead BUG in the soup. However, the manager of the store dealt with it very professionally. They offered to replace my meal and also excluded it from our bill.  For dessert, we had the churros with ice cream and hot chocolate. They are known for their bean to cup chocolate. The hot chocolate is rich and somewhat bitter. I don't usually drink hot chocolate so I can't really compare it to anything. I am a huge fan of dark chocolate but didn't like the bitter or unsweet taste of the hot chocolate. The churros were warm, crispy, and good. The ice cream must be made with the same chocolate because it was also slightly bitter. I love churros and ice cream but the two didn't really go very well together. I mistakenly thought it would since the ice cream was listed as an add on to the churro.  Ambiance of the restaurant is trendy, loud, and kind of tight. It is not family unfriendly but probably not the best spot for young kids.

It's also strange because you don't exactly have a waiter service but they do bring out your food and  come check on you every so often.

I think the caldo was the wood-fired chicken pozole. Another reason for the 3 stars is unfortunately this caldo was waaayyy too salty. We didn't finish it it was so salty. However I must say the torta was sooo good! I can't seem to remember which we got as this was a few months ago (think it was one with seafood). Also the churros were great as well .

Stepping inside, you choose from a menu, pay, and they seat you while waiting for your food instead of sitting and ordering. I take it that it gets pretty busy here (which it did) but we were there early enough that my friends were able to sit while I was on my way there. It's a very colorful restaurant but with very tight seating. They say two other people at our table for 3, and each table is assigned a number so servers know where to drop off your food. It was sort of an overpriced taco place but without tacos - if anything, it was more of a sandwich place than anything. Still, it was quality food. My friend ordered a Cuban sandwich, my other friend ordered the shrimp sandwich and I ordered the mushroom sandwich. They were all fresh and delicious! I especially liked mine, with the goat cheese and arugula with a spicy sauce to match it. We ended it with an assortment of churros, 3 regular, 1 chocolate and 1 pistachio. My favorite was the pistachio - it was so different than what I'm normally used to and perfectly cooked! It was certainly satisfying. Difficult seating, with average service aside from the lady who came by and cleaned our table with a smile and so polite, but delectable food that arrived pretty quickly although a little overpriced.

The food is fantastic!  Nothing like south american flavors.  We started with Sikil Pak, that is a pumpkin seed dip served with tortilla chips and cucumber.  It was my first time having that, very tasty and healthy.  We had the woodland Mushroom sandwich and it was so delicious!! Pretty well stuffed with lots of mushroom, goat cheese and arugula.  For a sweet taste we had three churros with a chocolate shot for dipping and we also had an Almendrado (a cup of chocolate shot with almond milk).  The churros were so very good, I must say my recommendation is to order a coffee to have with the churros, the Almendrado was way too much chocolate to have with the churros and the chocolate dip. The place itself is nice but small.  Definitely not good for big groups. Mostly comfy counter sits, I didn't mind sitting at a counter, but I do prefer sitting at a table.  The staff is great, very friendly and helpful.  There was a wait, but only 5 minutes or so.  You first place your whole order, including desert with the cashier, than you are given a table number and the hostess with lead you to your number.   The prices are affordable in my opinion.  For the snack, sandwich, churros and drinks we paid $40.  That is very reasonable to me.

2016-02-19,3.0,"Well...in the words of my friend as we left...""that was rough."" I had never been to a Rick Bayless restaurant, and I was really looking forward to it. The consensus when we left was that this would be a great place for take-out (which they have), but dining in wasn't great, especially with a big group. The venue itself is small. There are a lot of seats around the perimeter of the room (like a bar setting, and very few tables. There are no reservations to be made. You can show up early and tell the hostess that you will have guests showing up,  but you can't sit at the table until people start to arrive. We were pretty cramped by the time we sat down, but it worked.  You can order and then sit down, and they will bring your food to you, or they will wait on you. I was little confused by this...so we have a waiter or we don't? The wait staff was very nice and tried to be accommodating when we first got there. Towards the end of the night, the service wasn't so good. A few orders were forgotten or messed up (they did make up for that). We waited a long time for checks and getting out. We wished we would have just ordered and sat down. As far as good and drinks go, overall it is very good. The guac is really good, as well as the 2 salsas they give you. The tacos al pastor (only served on Wednesdays) are also good. I really liked their churros with chocolate dipping sauce and Mexican chocolate ice cream. Really different and really good. The margaritas...I was not a fan. It tasted like there was a ton of salt in the drink, which I don't like. they are also really expensive for how small they are. So...I would go back for take-out.

It's also pretty pricey, but welcome to downtown Chicago I guess.  I'm coming across pretty critical, but I still really enjoyed my meal here. I think Tortas Fronteras in the airport may have gotten my hopes up too high for Xoco, as none of my tortas here were as good as the airport exclusive Chipotle Chicken torta.

The carnitas soup came with a generous amount of carnitas. I loved the potatoes and brussels sprouts that were in the soup. The soup was a little on the saltier side as well. I think a piece of bread, some avocado chunks, and some cilantro would've been a perfect accompaniment to the soup to offset the saltiness.  Definitely have to get a churro. The pistachio glazed churro was not too sweet and the churro was so crispy and soft in the inside. It comes with a generous amount of crushed pistachios and glaze.  Verdict: I would come back to try the other tortas that are available, but it's not a ""omg I have to come here"" kinda place for me.

The baby was fussy which turned my relaxing early breakfast into a lets hurry up and finish and get out of here. We had a couple of the ready made items. They toast and the Empanada. The poblano toast had great flavor but it was still very cold in the middle. If you are going to have ready made food you should make sure it is reheated all the way. Empanada was good but somewhat soggy. We also had the chilaquiles. I loved these in Mexico but this dish did not have the same pizzazz. Somewhat bland overall.

The Mister went with the Saturday goat barbacoa special and I was kind of jealous after a bite because it was so good. If you're there on Saturday, definitely order this.

It's topped with cabbage and pickled jalapeños, but the real winner here is the avocado salsa. I also had a hot chocolate that was divine; it's rich and thick like a Turkish coffee and is a nice compliment to anything on the menu. Others in my party had the choriqueso (eh... Not up my alley, but they loved it) and the Baja chicken sandwich without the cabbage-radish slaw (he won lunch.... Man, that was good). The flavor of the grilled chicken was intense and authentic and perfectly paired with the smooth creaminess of queso fresco. Chips and salsa were also good and included free refills.

Unfortunately, I have to say a few things: - When I picked up my order, I was told everything is in there, so I did not check myself (so I guess I take some responsibility too). When I arrived home, I found that half of my order is missing, and they are my favorite churros.  - Say it was my fault that I did not check the items myself. I called their number and told them some items in my order is missing, the lady told me that she will give my number to the manager, and the manager will call me right away. Guess what, I never got any call or whatsoever.  I will not say anything  to their food, in fact I love their churros. But if the business is providing a pickup service, and it has spent the time and money to build the app and all the wonderful features, it would be great if you could at least get everything in the bag before handing it over.

Sure it's just dough deep fried in loads of grease but the simplicity of it makes it remarkable. The chocolate dipping sauce is decadent with a nice consistency, not thick or thin, and not sweet, it's perfect. The extra $1.25 to get this is worth it. You must surrender and throw caution out the window to make it a full experience.  That said, we also tried the PISTACHIO GLAZED CHURROS for $2.25 each. What a genius creation that was devoured so quickly. As long as you're not allergic to this tree nut, don't think twice, order it!  All that must be paired with something hot. By that I mean hot chocolate. I sampled all types they carry from authentic, classic, aztec, almendrado, and Mexico City thick, all delicious in its own way.

The churro was covered in some dusting that made it taste like a churro tortilla. It was basically if you take a tortilla and dip it into some sugar and cinnamon. It was more tortilla than churro.

Crust amazing,  moist apples full of flavor!    Carrot squash cake. . Dry-as-a-bone. (remember National Lampoons Xmas vacation Turkey..THAT dry...) Tasted like it was days old sitting in the display window to dry out. Yuck. Would have asked for something else,  but no body came by to check on us or our table so far so why bother.   Finished our *meals* & left.  Total cost 79$ for two people with a ten dollar tip  ( you pay in the beginning like at chipotle), so I feel I tipped for no reason considering we were never served per say and also received less than sub par meals with out any follow up or checking in to ensure satisfaction of our meals and experience.   Pretty disappointed in the first time experience for such a hyped up joint. ..",0.9112,0.841,0.096,0.064,0.5289137877373172

The problem here is that everything ""original"" is not an improvement on the original version. When you eschew  the traditional bread from a Mexican torta and replace it with a baguette-even a tasty one-it turns into something other than a torta. And when you make churros really skinny they get tough. And when you cover them with sauce they get tough and soggy. That said, most of the flavors I had were very good ones. And the habanero salsa that came with the sandwich had a wonderful flavor, although it was really too hot to eat, as I was warned.

On a recent trip to Chicago I happened to stay across the street so I was pretty excited to try Xoco for brunch. I got the cochinita pibil torta and my wife ordered the short rib red chili caldo. The caldo was solid - lots of flavor with just the right amount of spice. The cochinita pibil, on the other hand, was meh to the point where I didn't bother to finish it. And I'm the sort of person who doesn't leave pizza crust on my plate if I can help it. The pork was dry to the point where the salsa didn't really help, and the bread was too crusty to be appropriate for a torta. For comparison, try a cochinita pibil torta from Cook's Tortas in LA. The contrast is staggering. And this is not some snobby SoCal sentiment. I lived in Chicago for 7 years before I moved to LA and there is some damn good Mexican food there.

I know why though-the bread was super crunchy and delicious! -Ahogada was our first torta, with pork carnitas, black beans, chili sauce, pickled onions and served with a tomato broth. This had a nice little spicy kick to it! Just the right amount. Hai yah! -Pepito was the short rib, caramelized onions (yum), cheesy goodness with pickled jalapenos. Dip away in the sauce! -Churros weren't the softest, but we were able to ask our hostess to serve them after our meal. They came warm, and the warm chocolate sauce made these churros even better! Chocolate sauce was rich and smooth, but I liked my churros without the chocolate even better. Xoco also has an order system for pickup that seemed pretty efficient! I saw quite a few folks picking up their orders during the hour I was there. If in Chicago again,  I'd love to try the pork belly sandwich and the hazelnut churros! Along with some hot chocolate, of course :)",0.9959,0.809,0.191,0.0,0.5844738594738597

Excited to try Rick Baylis' restaurant and checking the overall rating on Yelp, first, we arrived disappointed and surprised to learn its a Mexican sandwich shop (tortas).  I was really craving some traditional Mexican dishes, not a pork ""sub"".  Being Mexican, bread meant tortillas, not thick, crusty, tough rolls. Everything seemed panini-style to me. I finally pulled the shredded pork out of its ginormous bin and ate it alone with salsa. I would have killed for a tortilla to go with it. Strange.  I felt like I was in a ""No Soup For You"", Seinfeld episode when we were line. We were told we were a number, and then the guy after us in line was sent to order before us. Strange.  I asked the hostess to please explain to me what the process was. She said wait patiently till our number was called.  Got our table- then our food  No staff person checked on us at all- not once.

2015-09-15,2.0,"This is a dessert review. The Skinny: subpar tres leches and hot chocolate, good Mexican wedding cake (3) service: disorganized for counter service (2), value: skip this joint and the hype (2) After a rather disappointing meal at Frontera Grill,  we hopped over to sample the tres leches cake (raspberry mint,  $6.00)and a cup of Aztec chocolate ($2.75). Ordering is counter service and confusing. The hostess gave us a table number verbally and told us to order at the counter and they would bring out our food to the table. So we ordered and at the end of the line, she told us that she had to change our table number to accommodate a handicap customer. Okay,  no problem... Except the person who delivered food to the table had not been relayed this message. Thank goodness it wasn't that crowded and we could see what was going on so we steered the server to the right table.  Realistically,  they should just give you a number and that should stay with you the whole time to limit the confusion. She accidentally (on reflection) gave us a Mexican wedding cake too (we weren't sure if it came with the chocolate).  In addition, it took a long time for us to get a largely pre-made dessert and a cup of hot chocolate in a non busy restaurant (15 minutes for hot chocolate... WTF?).  The tres leches was so disappointing. The luxurious combination of 3 different milks did not penetrate through the cake leaving a dry texture on top and a slightly moist cake on the bottom. You can tell just by the presentation that the tres leches is no es bueno by the dryness of the plate alone.  The touted bean to cup hot chocolate was also a failure. Yes, there was a lot of ground up beans in the cup - so much so that the last dregs were really gritty. Way too much settlement on the bottom. Also, it lacked the warmth and spiciness I expected considering there is supposed to be some chili in there. Definite pass. Finally, the Mexican wedding cake. That was the best thing - the nutty shortbread was pretty delicious - light, airy and went well with the not-so-awesome cup of Aztec chocolate. Given Rick Bayless' reputation, I was sorely disappointed with both Xoco in terms of flavor, service and price. 2 starred review.",0.8094,0.831,0.094,0.074,0.5357363315696648

2015-09-09,3.0,"I've been to Xoco before years ago but only for coffee and the churros.  This trip to Chicago I wanted to actually sit down and eat there this time and have more than just dessert. My wife and I walked over to Xoco on a Friday knowing if we didn't get there on Friday or Saturday that they'd be closed Sunday and Monday.  This place is small, very small for the amount of people that want to eat there.  There is a line up leading up to the check out and while you're in line you're asked where you want to eat (inside, outside, take out).   Basically the person asking where you want to eat knows what seating is available and will marshal you to that area as it's not a self seating type of place.  You can also order a drink while in line so you can have a drink while you wait which you must pay for up front.  The seating marshal will then tell you what your table number is and you'll be assigned that seating so you don't have to scramble for a place to sit down.  This place is pretty noisy inside.  The only seating available was outside which has both stools and low chairs.  We had low chairs.  By the time you get to the register you have to give them your table number and know what you'd like to order and pay there.  We went with a Cubana sandwich and my wife had a watermelon and goat cheese salad with a guacamole with bacon and queso fresco to start.  We also ordered churros and my wife wanted a coffee but not until we were done our mains. The guacamole was ok.  I can't say it was amazing.  The chips were good and they also came with a couple different salsas as well. My sandwich was good but not great.  The bread I'm used to being more crusty and toasted more than it was.  This is a standard for just about any Cuban sandwich I've ever had in Miami or just about anywhere that wants to make it as should be.  Their torta simply wasn't as good as I'm used to and generally speaking every place in Miami does it the way I was expecting it to be.   My wife's salad was a disappointment for her that or it simply wasn't what she was expecting.  She was expecting way more watermelon than she received (only about 5 small pieces) and there was barely any goat cheese in her salad.  I looked at it and it was rather sad looking.  It definitely wasn't worth 11 dollars. We ate all our guacamole and mains and we had asked to receive our dessert.  I had asked for a single chocolate and peanut churro and my wife had the trio of regular cinnamon and sugar with her chocolate cafe con leche.  The coffee I tried and it was really good.  Honestly I think Xoco's strong suit is the churros and coffee.  The food was in my opinion nothing really special. Rick Bayless or not I've had better torta in Miami at walk up places and for me the bread is the maker or breaker for sandwiches.  My wife's salad seemed ""skimped"" to say the least.  The churros and coffee however are as we remember them, great.",0.951,0.85,0.089,0.061,0.4746390252773232

I was hungry, and probably anything would have tasted good at this point, but this was really, really good! It was a Saturday, so I had their special - Goat barbacoa torta. The bread is so cripsy and delicious, and the flavors of the meat and salsa makes a perfect combination.  Upon my second (sober) visit here, I knew my love for this place was real. I had the Ahogada, which is a carnita torta sitting in a pool of delicious tomato chili broth. You can get the broth spicy or mild, and I went for spicy. It definitely had a nice kick to it, but it wasn't overpowering. Now I could have just drank bowls upon bowls of this broth. YUM! This time I also had the much talked about churros- one pistachio glazed and one regular. I personally think the regular one is so good that you don't need the glazed options. These aren't that large, so I suggest getting a few.  The restaurant itself is casual- you order up at the register and they bring the food out to you. Along with the food, they have a small drink selection- some beers and margaritas. My only gripe about this place is it's not open on Sundays, and that's usually when I'm in the city.",0.9938,0.826,0.174,0.0,0.49846153846153846

Noticeable changes were the lack of the ham torta with fried egg and hot chocolate made with almond milk. I was definitely bummed to see these gone, but that said, I still had a great lunch. While expensive, the bare naked guacamole was very good, perfectly seasoned and served with fresh, crisp chips. The pepito and Cochinita pibil tortas were delicious, and even better with a little guac. Also heard rave reviews about the special Tuesday carne asada torta from others at my table. Of course, you can't come to Xoco without having their famous hot chocolate and churros, so I ordered just that. I prefer the hot chocolate with milk because it's so much richer than with water. The hot chocolate really is some of the best you will ever find, it's incredibly strong and rich. Still upset they don't make it with almond milk anymore though. And the churros are just as good as I remember, crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside, right amount of cinnamon sugar. Perfect piece of fried dough. Overall, Xoco is a classic. It will forever remain a go-to breakfast and lunch stop and rightfully so. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu and I wouldn't mind coming everyday to enjoy a nice hot chocolate or coffee and fresh hot churro or torta.",0.9976,0.7,0.27,0.031,0.54602787456446

I love the concept - fresh Mexican (street eats) that lean towards the more casual tortas, guac, soups, etc, all made quickly and perfect for takeaway. All that being said, my buddy Corey and I still sat inside and enjoyed our lunch.  First of all, the naked guac was pretty fabulous - incredibly fresh and flavorful and perfect with my fresh juice. However full you may be, start with some guac, my friends. When it comes to the menu, I've got to be honest, I wasn't totally bowled over by my main order - the ahogada. I should have read the description closer as the sandwich comes with a *very* spicy broth and not only am I not crazy about dipped sandwiches in general, but more so, my mouth was absolutely on fire. And I can handle heat. So there's that. Even though the sammie wasn't my fave, the grilled pork was flavorful and delicious, and everything I sampled was super solid.

It's pretty rich though, so don't be surprised if you can't finish it. Last time I was here, I tried the iced chocolate with mint drink and it was so refreshing.

We are from out of town and I am handicapped as well. We walk in and proceed to the order counter. After waiting to order for at least 10 minutes we are told that we can't order because we do not have a table number. The counter person than leaves the counter letting us just stand with our hands up our &@$?€£. After several minutes another person appears and again ask to take our table number and of course we are thinking the other girl will gets us one but nooooo.  We than decide we have to go because now the learn to order is huge.  When we walked in there was only one couple there.  The hostess who was suppose to stop us at the door finally appears and really takes no responsibility for anything.  Nice way to treat out of towners and handicapped.

2015-07-01,5.0,Honest review: best tortas really high quality. U order and u sit down so know what u want. The seating sucks they split tables to sit two partys so it can be awkward. The service is so amaizing they will go above and beyond to accommodate y there so nice they gave us chips and salsa free its kinda slow though meaning dirty plates wont get picked up. Be warned the hot chocolate is supper bitter to the point where it makes ur face pucker u wont be able to take another sip supper overpowering dont try it. The actual torta bread is amaizing usually i never eat the bread but its so crunchy and delicious Bill was like 80 dollars expensive but u will remember this for a very long time all in all im coming back! The wait is long to so be mindful of that  Chips and salsa: these are the best tasting chips i ever had in my life they werent supper thin or greasy or really bland they were delicous to the point where u just eat them plain. All the salsas are delicous the dark green spicy and acidic the red really rich and spicy be careful the light green one is just habanero peppers one bite will knock u out if u dont like spicy food dont try the light green one! 3 bucks Pozole verde with egg: im mexican so i am really picky to pozole because my grandma makes the best one but this one was so much better sorry grammy! It was so rich so much depth of flavor then all of the condiments were amaizing there was chicharron and beef and pork really tender and delicous the harmony was perfect not chewy or gummy which is really rare! The egg made it perfect must order best pozole ever! 12 bucks Ahogada torta: this for me was the best one. The bread supper crunchy and delicous. The meat inside was really tender really flavorful the soup was really good a lil to salty and acidic but still really really good only problem was there was hardly any meat in it! :( 11 bucks Short rib and mushroom torta special: this was really good there was alot of meat inside and the red salsa is to die for suppee delicous wasnt as good as the ahogada but it had more meat in it  12 50 Flan nopolitano: omg best flan ever it was so good perfect texture not hard or not to squishy the corn with bacon was to die for sweat and salty perfect combination must order 6 bucks Mint mango tres leches: best tres leches i ever had i hate mint with a passion like if i order something n it has mint i get pissed so much so thats why i dont chew gum but this was to die for perfect texture wasnt dry the mangos were really sweat not sour its savory and sweat such a really interesting combination u wont stop eating it! 6 bucks Pistachio churro: i didnt like the texture it was hard not fluffy so the batter was way to thick the nut flavor really enhanced the dish it was really good then the glaze was to die for they just need to fix the texture of it  Hazelnut churro: i didnt like this the sauce was grainy idk how to describe it kinda like wet sand it was off putting the hazelnuts reminded me of nutella but not that exactly just the flavor combinations were not good together i hated it i wouldnt recommend it,0.999,0.698,0.228,0.074,0.5233228150698032

A little more salt and lime would have taken the guac to another level but the avocados that they use are very fresh. I had read a lot of things about the Ahogada sandwich and decided to try it out. I didn't realize that it came in a light tomato soup as well which was pleasantly surprising. I will definitely be coming back to try the other sandwiches on the menu because the Ahogada was fantastic. My only gripe is with the seating. When you walk in, you tell a waitress how many people are in your group, then she gives you a table number. You then order your food, pay and then try to find your table number which can be really tricky due to the layout of the dining area.

The torta comes with a dipping jus that you can order different levels of spicy. I went with medium even though I'm not great with spice because I figured I could adjust by dipping more/less.

2015-06-07,4.0,"THEIR DESSERTS!  My friend and I came to Xoco on a Saturday evening and were given a table immediately. As one of the more casual restaurants of Rick Bayless, the restaurant stil has a very intriguing menu with a guacamole bar, tortas, bowls, and more.  Milanesa Torta: 4/5 -- A flavorful sandwich filled with chicken, beans, jalapaneos, jack cheese, cabbage, and avocado salsa. Excellent but still pricey with the ten bucks. Did not find it anything amazing.  Churros: 4.5/5 -- These churros were warm, crunchy, not-too-sweet, and with the perfect amount of cinnamon and sugar.  Chocolate: 3/5 -- The shot of chocolate that came with the churros was too bitter for my liking. But if it's strong bitterness you like in your chocolates, go nowhere else.  Hazelnut Glazed Churro: 5/5 -- I will be coming here for their glazed churros for a long time to come. Everything great about the regular churro plus a perfect glaze.  Flan: 5/5 -- Topped with kettlecorn (yes, kettlecorn), the flan was another amazing dessert. Delicate and smooth, it's simple yet executed to perfection.

You order and pay first and then are seated as you wait for your food. Don't worry, order your dessert first and it will come out when you ask for it after you're done eating.  I ordered the Ahogada (a Mexican sandwich with golden pork carnitas that comes in a  tomato-arbol chile broth). The sandwich was very tasty and I loved being able to dip it into the broth.  For dessert, we tried the almond chocolate and Mexican City chocolate drinks. Both were very good and went well with our regular churro and pistachio churro.

2015-06-02,2.0,"I was sorely disappointed with this restaurant.  I was in a rush to get between the Dreihaus and Art Institute on my last day in Chicago to get some sight seeing done before I had to head back to the airport tomorrow. I flipped open Yelp, saw Xoco nearby, and believe I heard good things about it from other sources so I headed in that direction. Also note that I walked past a Chipotle to get here and that I only went here under the impression service was speedy.  First of all, let me say that the service system is a hot mess. You walk in. You must specify whether you're dining in or carrying out as there are two different counters for that. When you're dining in, you are assigned a number you must remember. The hostess did not specify why I had a seat number, I just did. Was I 120 in line? Was I supposed to find seat 120? Should I wait until this number is called? I promptly forget my number after staring at the menu, great. A new seat awaits (I swear I am not forgetful, I was just overwhelmed and mildly dyslexic)! You order up front with your number apparently and go find the hostess again, and give her your number so she can show you your seat. Why didn't you just give me a placard with the number like a normal fast casual restaurant is beyond me. It was clearly inefficient because I saw the runner just approaching random people with the wrong food, and looking confused. I'm completely surprised with this terrible system because Bayless grew up in the industry, he should know this is a hot mess. It was as annoying as trying to get service at a genius bar in a crowded Apple store before a phone release.  The best thing here I've tried was the hibiscus tea. And it better be at $3 a glass! It essentially tastes like starbucks passion tea lemonade. If you like passion tea lemonade, you like hibiscus tea. With my delicious hibiscus tea, I ordered the carne asada torta special and the chicharones. The chicharones look bangin' on yelp and all of the tortas look pretty legit so I thought I couldn't go wrong (especially with ordering a special which should be a ""highlight"" on a menu!)  I got my chicharones pretty quickly but once you get past the first layer of hot sauce and onions it gets pretty burdensome. They didn't add enough toppings and only dressed the top layer so the rest is just plain old pork rinds. I felt like my rinds were rancid tasting too- maybe that's how they're ""supposed"" to taste, I'm not a huge pork fan, but any other time I had pork rinds they didn't taste like this. I continue eating them anyways because I was starving and patiently waiting for my entree to come out.  30+ minutes in, I figured they lost my order because I'm watching people who clearly just walked in get fed. I inquire, and they look confused and consult with a bunch of other people (they even had to ask if I had a receipt to show that I actually ordered a sandwich - no I came here to slowly eat pork rinds and not eat real food for 45 minutes! ) They try to comp with some free chips but honestly I could not be bothered to wait around any longer for chips. Now why I actually rated this coveted restaurant a 2/5 was the fact that my Mexican food was bland. as. hell. Holy crap. No flavor express. I regret so hard not going to chipotle within one bite of my carne asada torta. No spice, no salt, barely any acidity. The salsa just tasted of roasted tomatillo and nothing else. The chimichurri just tasted like watered down, blended parsley. This is the type of Mexican food you'd feel safe serving at a old folk's home because it's so inoffensive and flavorless if you blindfolded them they'd swear it came from Subway. Everything you would ever want from Mexican food is missing. I paid over $20 for this meal and Taco Bell could out-flavor this joint (lesson earned: don't pay $20 for Mexican food unless it's sizzling fajitas).  Maybe if my sandwich had an ample amount of juicy, premium carne asada I'd say that'd make up for it, but gosh, even that was bland. Do they even season the meat? Are they aware of what salt is? Is there a lime shortage?  I've been on a one week flavor adventure in Chicago and Iowa and by and large, this was the worst meal I had the entire time. Skip, skip, skip. Save yourself the disappointment. I've definitely had worse meals and worse service (thus why it's not a 1) but my god, I would had much rather been eating at Chipotle.",-0.929,0.779,0.115,0.106,0.51924103339766

I guess I would say the bread is pretty hard but other than that they all have incredible flavor and fresh ingredients. For the tortas sandwiches I would give the place 4.5 stars. Why 2 stars on this review then? I had to write this after having another bad experience with the place. On two separate occasions I came to the restaurant and ordered a torta to go. Both times I waited 25+ minutes for a sandwich which is ridiculous. I noticed there were a couple other very large orders for delivery being prepared and I guess I understood why it would take so long so I would cut them some slack. Today I had a hankering for a hot sandwich and decided to order one online so that I could pick it up, avoid the wait and have a torta during lunch. I ordered the sandwich at 11:15, got to XOCO at 11:30 and told the woman my name. She looked at the to go orders and said it'll be just a minute. 20 minutes later I'm still standing there, furious. I walk back up to the counter and tell her I ordered one torta over 30 minutes ago. She looks at the counter, finds my cold sandwich and asks me why I didn't check in with her....... I ALREADY HAD! I looked at her dumbfounded and explained, she handed me the sandwich and said, ""my bad."" I also paid extra for extra cheese and my torta came with no cheese. I didn't notice this until I was already back at my office, already very angry over what had just happened. I paid almost $15 for a cold sandwich with no sides. That's absurd.

The guy at the pickup counter said to wait in a certain spot, and then a manager had to move us which was just a bit weird. Anyway, our food was ready about 10 minutes late which was fine. I got the Baja Chicken Torta and my dad and I split guacamole and churros. The chips were okay--very salty, and our tiny portion of almost naked guacamole with sun dried tomatoes was just above average. My torta was very flavorful and enjoyable until I found a bone (it could have been a ligament or tendon, I guess) in my chicken. Gross. Poor preparation on the chicken. The sandwich was otherwise very good. The best part of the meal, though, was the churros. Warm and sweet and soft--yum.

This Yelp rating is strange -- I just can't explain it because with 4 stars and over 2,000 reviews I was not expecting the experience we had. Quick summary: - Expensive ($47 without tip for two people with two entrees, guac and two beers) especially considering there are no complementary chips - Service is slow, interior feels like fast food place but entrees come out slowly (two entrees took over 15 min) - Seats are chosen for you; we didn't get a table but instead got side-by-side bar stools near the bathroom (seems they reserve the tables for larger groups) Longer story. This is a super average Mexican food place where tourist families seem to frequent.

Here's the thing -- we are fine with high prices, no wait staff, no Corona, seat roulette etc as long as the food is worth it. But food was all bland with little flavor. The Ahogada for instance came dipped in a sauce which was basically a tomato sauce (less flavorful than heated up Ragu) with some hot sauce in it. If you are not looking for flavor, this is the place for you but I enjoy a little more excitement in my life. The tortilla chips taste like Fritos and the guacamole is totally not worth it (again, bland, but also tiny portion).

At Xoco, there are separate lines if you want to order food to go or dine in.  If you choose the latter, you will be given a table number (remember this!) and a menu from which you can order any number of delectable items.  In lieu of traditional waiter service, you place your order at the register and then migrate to your table number.  When your food is ready, your order will be brought to you.  Although there was no line when I first arrived, it quickly ballooned during prime lunch hours on a weekend, so I would imagine that it could get even busier on a weekday.   I ordered the seafood caldo, which featured a delicious array of shrimp, mussels, and fish.  All three types of seafood were cooked to perfection: the shrimp was juicy and succulent, the mussels were tender and reminiscent of the sea, and the fish was soft yet meaty.  The broth wasn't overly spicy, which may or may not have been a good thing given how cold it was outside.  You could tell that the potatoes had been roasted prior to being added to the soup, which made them extra tasty.  And, though they resembled zucchini, the knob onions (I think)? were also nicely flavored and enhanced the overall dish.  What I appreciated about the soup was the complexity of the flavors as well as the freshness of the seafood.   That being said, I probably should have ordered something else in addition to the soup, as it wasn't as filling as I would have liked.  I was expecting the soup to be somewhat hardier given the description.  The freshly made chips smelled delicious, and I hated myself for not ordering them! Overall, I would highly recommend checking out Xoco if you're in the neighborhood and short on time or money!  The staff is super friendly, the food is delicious, and the music will keep you entertained!",0.9936,0.824,0.151,0.025,0.48828571428571416

And from an eco standpoint: Positives: Eating-in is super eco-responsible. They use all washable dishes and silverware for their food. Xoco offers 100% recycled paper napkins, and glass cups to help yourself to water. Virtually no waste. Their to-go boxes are also the cardboard with wax lining- way more responsible than styrofoam and plastic. They even have water-efficient toilets! I'm even pretty sure that all of their to-go containers are plant derived! Bravo Xoco! Negatives: They use paper towels in their bathrooms for drying, and there are some meals where unnecessary wax paper and doilies are used. Mind you, I am really nitpicking here... Xoco is doing super well from an enviornmental standpoint thus far, but to continue that streak... Xoco could improve by switching to hot air hand-dryers, and omitting the wax paper and extra paper products from the few dishes that are served with it.

We all ordered various dishes including posole, torta de milanesa, torta de championes, guacamole with chips, and 3 orders of churros with a chocolate dipping sauce.  The chips tasted like they were straight out of Mexico, made out of real ground corn.  The rest of the food had authentic Mexican flavors but with a twist that really complemented the dish.  My father really enjoyed the pozole but my Mexican mother found it too salty and enjoyed half of my torta de milanesa instead.  Normally a torta includes beans, cheese, maybe some guacamole and the milanesa.  They added shredded cabbage and some other goodies that sounded random but tasted right once they were in your mouth.  We couldn't get enough of the churros either and my sister sprinkled the chocolate dipping sauce into the cinnamon-flavored ice cream they gave us.  The ice cream was good as a dipping sauce but was too powerful to eat with a spoon.  I found the cinnamon too overwhelming but my sister was obsessed. My uncle had been to this establishment numerous times on his trips to Chicago and raved about the food here.  Apparently they own various Mexican restaurants in town including La Frontera and in the food court in Macy's (which we went to for lunch the next day).

I wish I had the ahogada right now with me...it's hard to understand how a sandwich dipped in this yummy chile sauce could be so freakin good!! We came here on a Saturday afternoon around 3:30pm and it was insanely PACKED....why? Because it just happened to be St. Patty's weekend, and everyone was out and about, having the drunchies and all that. :/ We had just come from the Art Institute and were famished! So, instead of having to wait in line that went all the way outside, we ordered to go to bring back to our hotel--best decision we made because we only had to wait 20 minutes for our food and weren't bothered by drunk people everywhere (but I do slightly wish I could have experienced the food in the restaurant atmosphere rather than a hotel in takeout boxes).  Besides the ahogada (a sandwich you should DEFINITELY GET), we got the churros--one pistachio and one peanut butter chocolate--and they were very good. They were more chewy than expected, but we liked the change. Next time I'd want to try just the plain churros as well. We also go the hot chocolate (made with almond milk I believe)--and it was a bit too thick and decadent for our liking.  I don't want to explain anymore.

I ordered the Milanesa. It had crispy gunthorp chicken and delicious tomatillo-avocado salsa. The sandwich is cut in two. I could easily use either to do bicep curls with. Which is impressive. What is equally impressive, or gross (let the reader use discernment) is that I ate it in it's entirety. My husband ordered the Baja Chicken. I liked the cabbage raddish slaw they used on it. It was served on a different bread than I had. Which I didn't care for as much, but when everything else is going right on a sandwich, it becomes a minor detail. We didn't save room for dessert but managed to shovel some in anyway. My words of wisdom to those who eat here is save room for coffee and the churros. You can order them individually or in threes. I strongly recommend the chocolate dipping sauce. The soft serve ice cream was really a nice touch as well. You will also probably want more than one.

The first time I had a sandwich and it was really good, plus the churros with chocolate dipping sauce and hot chocolate.  You start with chips and salsa. The tomatillo salsa was gross, and the other orange looking salsa was just as bad. Makes me think that Bayless's cooks don't know what they are doing. The chips were horrifically salty, and so was everything else. I ordered the Tuesday special which was the Carne Asada Steak sandwich. It was a stupid price of $12.75!!!! It was like eating salt between bread, so much salt!!!! I feel that because of the lack of flavor, they try to compensate by pouring a silo's worth of salt on their food.  They took food out, and didn't bring out all at once. It took at least 35 minutes for the other food to come out. Waiting on a pork soup that was over abundantly filled with salt. It was ridiculous!!!!  We never had a designated waiter. The bus boy kept trying to take stuff without even asking if we were finished. I had to keep saying, ""please don't, we're not done"". I was over it. The manager was very nice and willing to fix things. He took the soup back and brought it back out. It wasn't his fault for the cooks heavy hand to make everything salty!!!  Unfortunately, his generosity was overshadowed by another bowl of salty soup!!!!! I was ready to get out of there.

It was a bit chilly that day, especially since we weren't intoxicated like 80% of the Chicagoan that Saturday, so how were we going to warm up? My solution was XOCO! One word - Ahogada! This hearty pork carnitas sandwich sits in a warm tomato base broth. Toasty on the outside, soft on the inside. It warmed us up instantly. They also have daily specials and on Saturday, it was the Goat Barbacoa. Although the barbacoa came with a salsa, my boyfriend couldn't help but to dunk the sandwich into the tomato broth. This broth is addicting! He nearly licked it clean. Two sandwiches and some chips with guac, and we were a couple of happy campers. Too bad this time around, I didn't order the churros because I had a wedding to be in the following month. I still regret not getting it til this day!

Another woman came and gave me the receipt and wouldn't leave until I pay right then. This chocolate was for less than $2. In my head I was thinking I should not have given a 20% tip.

It went like this: -You stand in line looking at the menu getting ready to order -While you're waiting to order, the host finds a table for you and assigns you a number -You tell the cashier your number after you order -You sit down at the table and wait for your food to be served to you It really doesn't flow as easily as it sounds! We got here not long after they opened for the morning, and nearly every seat was taken already. The hostess told us she'd find us a table, yet by the time we got to the cashier to tell her what our table number was, the hostess never came back to tell us a number! It was like we were in fast food limbo.  Finally, the hostess came back and told us where to sit, also telling the cashier our table number. Within minutes, we had our food! For an appetizer, we ordered the Fully Dressed Guacamole. It came with a bunch of different toppings, including bacon and cheese, and was easily the best guac I've ever had. For an entree, I ordered the Woodland Mushroom Torta - everything about this sandwich was great! The combination of all of the ingredients made this sandwich melt-in-your-mouth-amazing.

The tomato-based spicy soup is GGREAT by itself (I actually prefer the soup to the sandwich, which is all right). For me it seemed dipping the sandy in the soup made it taste saltier than it actually was. - Interesting margaritas ! I got it with a salt rim, which you can forgo. They were yummy without being sweet or sour, and less icy than what I'm used to, which worked out. They complemented our food nicely. - Service was nice. Cashier was pleasant, server was kind. I wanted half my ahogada to go and he quickly packaged it in Bayless' classic brown paper carton with extra spicy soup in a separate plastic bowl. - They bring the food to your ""table."" Now, about these tables.. Cons: - Tiny elbow room: they have limited seating, especially if you want a table. An employee told us to go to ""table 10"" which ended up being a stool-and-bar area where my boyfriend and I had to sit side by side and attempt to face each other by spinning our stools around. The table space was tiny, and he kept knocking over the guacamole as a result.

Desserts: If you do get the hot chocolates, I advise getting the plain churros with ice cream or the cherry chocolate bread pudding (it has real cherry pieces in them.

The manager came out, profusely apologized and explained the situation.  Apparently a large phone in order was ahead of me and that the cook staff didn't prioritize my in-house sandwich.  She then told me that she would refund my entire meal.  Now this is what I call GREAT customer service. I understand issues/mistakes can happen.  But mistakes can also be fixed or at the least alleviated.  A note to all businesses: this is how you turn a potential 2 star rating into a 5 star rating.  The time to address the issue is immediately, don't wait until a bad Yelp review.  If you wait for a bad review, then you've waited too long.  GREAT job fixing my problem XOCO manager.

I could have that for dinner every night of the week. :) But if you're hungry, the Mexican Sandwiches here are also super super yummy. The meat is marinated overnight in these large green leaves and submerged (??). My cousin and I were watching them prepare it the other night. It is LOADS of prep but the result is some of the most divinely zestful pork in the world.  The chips and guacamole are also super fresh--I actually really like the light corn chips here. The guacamole has a nice lemon zing without overdoing it on the onion. My only complaint is that the seating system is really confusing. First of all, it's a really small space, so I get why they don't do open seating. But then the host is actually standing at the order counter rather than at the front, so my friends and I were standing at the front for a good 10 minutes before we realized we were supposed to go up to the counter. They also won't take your order until you get a seat, so if you have a large party at the counter waiting for a table, it totally holds up the order line and congests the whole space. I'm not sure what would work better with how narrow the entrance is, but perhaps open seating might actually work better? Or maybe having people order first and then bringing a table number placard to the host to be seated? At any rate, the inconvenience is worth it--just don't go with a big party.

Get it plain and make sure to order it from the take-out line (it's usually under 3 minutes long compared to the 30 minute wait for the order-in line).

2014-10-20,5.0,"Every time I come to Chicago I want to eat at Xoco. Recently I stopped in for my third time and this was the best yet. In the past I have tried the churros and the drinking chocolate both of which are really good, a mollete which was delicious and very filling for a breakfast meal, and a couple different tortas which I enjoyed as well. This time my wife and I split a Goat Barbacoa Torta and Wood-Roasted Chicken Pozole. The sandwich was good, not spectacular, but a very good sandwich. The meat was tender and tasty and anytime a sandwich has avocado on it I am happy. But the highlight this time was the pozole. The flavor of the soup was amazing with a strong flavor of oregano (I think) and other spices. It was a good balance of flavors so the soup didn't seem overpowering but had tons of flavor. This is the third pozole I have eaten at three different restaurants and is probably my favorite (though they were all very different versions). The pozole corn (hominy) was a perfect texture of chewy without being too hard or too soft. I am not the biggest fan of white meat chicken and that seemed to be what was in the soup which is the only disappointment. I would have much rather had it filled with dark meat or else something totally different like pork, but the broth tasted so good I didn't mind and could have eaten another bowl. I also drank a Michelada which is kind of like a bloody mary made with beer, which I enjoyed and have drank before and would drink again. The restaurant itself can be very busy during it's busiest hours with a line out the door and down the sidewalk. This time we went on a Saturday around 2:00 and that's how it was. But the line didn't take too long and provided time for deciding what to eat and watching the food being made. The ordering system is cafeteria style with a line, then an ordering station, and then your food comes out on the other end. If you are dining in the hostess will verify this with you and then show you to your seat after you order. Otherwise you just wait near the end to pick up your food. What seems like a small crowded place while you are waiting in line actually has the space well managed and there is lots of seating inside. I have also been here on a weekday when there was no line or wait and not busy at all.

After I ordered, I was nervous that they would bring my chips and guac out at the same time they brought my meal seeing as this restaurant fits into the genre of fast casual dining, but thankfully they didn't! The loaded guac is a nice spin off your normal guacamole with additions like bacon and various seeds. My soup was so tasty. It was the perfect amount of spicy and a spin on traditional Mexican food. I did wish that some of the pieces of pork in my soup were not just fat and that their hostess was a little more helpful (she changed my table and forgot to bring things I asked for). But overall a great experience and I would definitely go again. I also just put two and two together and realized that Chip and Rick Bayless are related. What a power family!

Service: Quick, efficient.  Even if there is a line, it will go pretty quickly.  If you order soup, it takes a bit longer than sandwiches usually for the food to get to you. Food:  I love love love the tortas served here!  They always have a burst of flavor and are stuffed with ingredients.  I don't leave hungry with these.  But the soups are a bit of a hit or miss in terms of how filling they are.  However, they are worth a try, especially for their popping, spicy flavorings!",0.9961,0.685,0.305,0.01,0.5718749999999999
2014-10-07,4.0,"I personally had a pretty decent meal here at XOCO (though it was a lot, LOT spicier than I had anticipated). I ordered the Cubana, which had smoked pork loin, bacon, black beans, avocado, spicy morita (ahhh... reading the menu in hindsight, there's what I missed), artisan Jack cheese and chipotle mustard. I really did enjoy how flavorful the food was, but after a few bites I was sad to say that I couldn't really experience much due to my tongue being incapacitated by the spices. Boyfriend ordered the goat barbacoa (Saturday special) and he really enjoyed his food. But his also wasn't nearly as spicy as mine. I also ordered a glass of their iced mint chocolate, which was pretty delicious though thick and left a weird paste in my mouth. Still, overall, would order again and again. I would like to try their Aztec chocolate next time though! Sounds like Mexican hot chocolate and I always love me some of that spiced chocolate. The best part of the meal had to be the glazed churros though. We ordered a hazelnut and a chocolate-peanut and they were AMAZING. They also came out before our food did, so we had dessert before dinner. And I regret nothing. So overall, I would say that it's worth a little splurge.

2014-10-07,3.0,"One of my friends recommended Xoco when I first arrived in Chicago (well, any Rick Bayless restaurant were her exact words). Another friend had taken her sister to Xoco and immensely enjoyed the churros they had. So, after dinner at Sunda, my friends and I decided to hit Xoco for some churros.  We ordered the original in a set of 3 ($4), chocolate dipping sauce, pistachio, and hazelnut churros. The churros are shaped in a near-pretzel form, with the original dusted in traditional sugar and cinnamon, hazelnut in a nutty sauce with chopped hazelnuts sprinkled over it, and pistachio with a green sauce and chopped pistachios sprinkled over it. We also ordered the house-made chocolate dipping sauce, which we dipped the original churros in. It was bitter, but smooth.  Seating is an issue at Xoco, and even though you have been assigned a table when you arrive, the hostess may come and push your table with another table to accommodate a larger party. This happened to us, and it made me uncomfortable and feel like I should leave the restaurant. For this, I am docking a star.

The batter was light and crispy and the glaze was not too sweet. The inside was warm and fluffy. Most places in America dump all this sugar on their churros, which I don't appreciate. This place balanced the sweetness nicely.  I wish I had time and stomach space to try their regular food.  It's a very casual place where you pay at the front and give you a buzzer while you wait.

After you order and pay, then you get seated with the seat #. The food comes a few minutes later. A very odd layout and set-up. As an app, we ordered i believe was the coctel rojo. she wanted it because she thought it will be like ceviche. Not really..... it was more like a seafood dip for tortilla chips. It was okay. The shrimp and scallops were fresh at least. She ordered the Ahogada torta. You can alter the heat level base on what you want. I think she ordered medium? The sandwich was submerged in a chili soup that was yummy. You just want to keep on dunking your bread in there. The pork was moist and flavorful and the bread was crispy on the outside yet soft in the inside. They even scooped out some of the bread's inside so you don't get too full from the carb overload. My gf wasn't a big fan but I liked the dish. I ordered the Saturday Torta special: Goat Barbacoa . The goat was shredded and the tomatillo sauce came on the side. The sandwich was savory and delicious. It was def a bit gamey, but it wasn't off putting. I also ordered some Oaxacan-Style Peanuts because i thought it would be something good to snack on. Little did i know that it was premade and in a plastic bag. I ate it when i arrived home, and i literally destroyed it within a minute. It's a small bag....yes that's the reason why i finished it so quickly.... I need to start roasting my own peanuts and add mexican spices to them. The seating area can be a bit cramped.

The ice cream is delicious with some cinnamon in it giving it a mexican touch. Downside is that it's pretty small :(. Each churro is $1.60 plus the ice cream which was an additional $2.60. I recommend getting the 3 for $4 since they're pretty small. For ice cream, $2.60 is quite pricey in my opinion, but the churro is definitely worth every penny!!!

So you decide, in line, what you want to order.

I can only imagine how packed this place gets during the regular lunch rush! Xoco is fairly small, but their system of ordering and being seated seems to work as best it can considering the space. The menu consists of different sandwiches, tortas, and soups, and everything sounds fantastic. Sunny and I ordered and were directed to one of the communal tables. For my meal, I went with the ahogada and it was absolutely fantastic. Tender pork carnitas and black beans on crusty bread, plopped right into a bowl of arbol chile broth. I got mine medium spicy and it was perfect. This is undoubtedly the messiest sandwich I've ever eaten. Between trying to get as much of the broth on every bite as I could and the copious amounts of pork refusing to stay in the bread, I was a disaster. However, the sandwich was phenom. I love all of the flavors Bayless uses, particularly anything with that smoky, chile flavor. Sunny went with her standby, the pepito, which she said is always amazing.

2014-09-07,2.0,"After reading so many great yelp reviews and a friends recommendation, i made the trek to xoco only to be completely disappointed.  Let me start with the good, and this is only marginally good.  The churros are ok, i liked the plain sugar churro the best.  The Pistachio and Hazelnut glazed churro had too much syrup on top and was really sweet.  The churros are freshly fried to order, so everyone raves about these, but it was just okay.  I mean have you ever had a horrible churro experience? It is pretty hard to screw up a churro. I tried a mint ice hot chocolate, it would have been great except it was super minty, to the point where you cant even taste chocolate but only mint syrup.   The Albondigas sandwich was good, nice carnitas, but the soup base it was served on was super salty, even for dipping it was salty.  4 stars for the sandwich, 2 stars for the salty tomato based soup. I also sampled the pork belly vermicelli, everything was good with this dish except the soup was again super salty, to the point where you can only sip a few spoons here and there. Lastly, and the most horrific dish, was the Carnitas soup.  This dish sounded so good on the menu, it came out and i was excited to try.  My first spoonful i was terrified at the sheer amount of salt they need to use to make this dish so salty.  Literally every bite tasted like a spoon of salt.  The carnitas itself was good, but the soup was so salty i couldn't handle more than a few spoons.  I ended up eating the carnitas and veggies and skipping the salty soup. We told the waiter about our salty soups and he promised to bring the chef out to talk, but the chef never came.  I was okay because i really didn't want anymore of their food or salt in my body.  I am still amazed at how salty our soup bases were, my friend who came to eat with us also said the same thing.  She has been here before and the soups was completely different and not salty.  Maybe the chef forgot his measuring spoon or had a trainee cook, but after this bad experience i will never come back here again.

The churros at Xoco are made to order, which means they are dropped in the fryer right before they're served to you. They have a light, buttery flavor that isn't too sweet and perfectly crisp from being freshly fried. It's such a difference to be able to have a fresh churro compared to one that's been sitting on a heated case for a couple hours. Xoco offers a variety of different flavors of churros, but I ordered a plain one with a side of dipping chocolate. The dipping chocolate was rich and dark with a flavor that went nicely with the churro. I quickly finished the churro and then proceeded to drink the cup of chocolate as we were walking down the street. Yep. I drank the dipping chocolate. Get over it. The churro and side of chocolate was about $3.00, which made it a nice option for a small dessert. You can also get an order of three churros for $4.00 but I couldn't handle that many after the feast we'd just had at Frontera Grill.

Score (but still a 15-20 min wait).   We started off with the chicharrones which were pretty amazing. It was my first time ordering chicharrones so I can't compare or comment on authenticity BUT I have to say that these were exactly what I envisioned them to be. I loved the sauce on top but ask for it on the side if there are people in your party who can't take spice.  So my ultimate reason for a 3 was that the Tortas were good but much too overpriced for what is was....just a sandwich. In my mind, there is never a point in paying over $10 for a sandwich. Even $8 is pushing it. So if a sandwich is $13, it better be mind blowingly awesome - which it was not. The Choriqueso, although it had good flavors tasted more like an elaborate meatball sub. With the short rib torta, I had a difficult time distinguishing the cactus salad and black beans that were supposed to be in it. So there you go - good, but not great.  Iced Mint Chocolate - Very pure but because of that, the drink was grainy. You can tell that the mint was fresh though. This is a good refresher drink to split.  Churros - Can't deny that these are completely awesome to finish off a meal. They are toasty brown and sugary on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside.

The good:  The tortas are so delicious and satisfying.  My personal favorite  is the ahogada which is carnitas that comes in a spicy broth that I drink like a soup when I'm done.  I recommend taking the sandwich out of the broth as soon as you get it so that it does not get soggy. I also used to love the shrimp and goat cheese Friday night special but it has since been replaced.  The sandwiches are just bursting with flavor and very filling!  Sometimes if you are lucky you'll see Rick Bayless preparing your sandwich!   -if I'm with friends I like sharing the churros dipped in warm chocolate.   The less good: -lines can get really long -seating can be awkward if you are put against the wall right next to another couple or sharing a table -the sandwiches are an OK price but if you add chips and dessert it is not a cheap place.,0.9915,0.738,0.252,0.01,0.5892857142857142

I had a vegetable caldo and while I would've liked more veggies for the $10-$12 (can't remember) pricetag, it was delicious. The husband had a goat barbacoa sandwich and was over the moon with happiness. The bread for the tortas was yummy looking, crisp, and bubbly.  We had peanuts that were incredible, two amazing margaritas (XOCO margarita is not messing around with the stiffness, folks!) and dessert. Dessert. Maybe this deserves its own review. Possibly six stars? The chocolate, people.  The chocolate.  We had churros and dipping chocolate (DO NOT MISS THIS) along with an Azteca drink... personal preference against allspice (as it tastes like Christmas and while it's trendy, Christmas in July is not something I am a fan of). I would've ordered the traditional chocolate drink and will next time. So we maybe did spend close to $70, but we had two appetizers (both salsas for chips were awesome!), two entrees, two desserts, two alcoholic drinks and even took home a souvenir dessert drink mix.

2014-07-19,3.0,"This was a dinner experience and a mostly pleasant one.  Let me just start off by saying that I have ridiculously high standards for Mexican food and eat it probably 3 times a week.  As you stand in line to put your order in a host will come by and give you a menu and take a drink order and promptly return with your beverage.  As you get closer to the counter the same person will come back and give you a table number.  You put your entire order in at once and when you're ready for dessert you just tell the wait staff, ""We're ready!"" One negative when ordering: We wanted to split our order between a business credit card and a personal card.  This shouldn't be difficult with today's technology (and I've been a server myself) but our personal card had 3 pending charges for the same amount (and it still does! we're still waiting for it to go away 4 days later!).  Someone unfortunately was not trained in how to do this. All of the staff that we interacted with was very friendly.  We ordered the guacamole with chiles and queso.  I'm a big guac fan and because of my amazing guacamole experience at Iron Cactus in Austin I'm not sure anyone else can ever meet those standards (they squeezed fresh orange juice into it! (table-side)).  So for guacamole Xoco's was just okay, even by average standards.  The margarita was also  unfortunately just okay, even with fresh lime juice (it was premixed in house). Kinda tasted like limeade with tequila.  My guy ordered a Michelada, a traditional Mexican drink, a beer with a tomato juice mixture.  I am not a beer fan at all but I loved this drink!  I ordered the 'Short Rib Red Chile Soup', which was very tasty.   For food my guy ordered the Tuesday Torta special, Carne Asada ""Historically the difference between torta and bread was its round and flat shape, as well as the absence of yeast in its preparation. Presently, however, the word torta is also applied to different kinds of bread and pastry products according to the region.""  (Wikipedia) The more traditional Mexican restaurants I've been to serve tortas in the round and flat shape.  This torta was more like a French baguette. I was a little disappointed that it really did just look like a hoagie but now I'm just being picky!  I don't do bread but I ate some of the filling and it was delicious!    We both ordered a dessert, my guy, The Tropical Fruit Parfait and me, the 'Chocolate Raspberry Brownie', which the host assured me before ordering was not heavy at all.  But by the end of dinner I was full and hesitant about my dessert choice and hunted him down to change my order. I just wanted to get some of the liquid chocolate with the homemade dulce de leche, which would be only 50 cents less than what I ordered.  This was not important to me but very important to the host who wanted to adjust my bill (very nice!).  I insisted that it wasn't necessary so in addition to the liquid love he delivered he also brought me a side of ice cream with blueberries and raspberries, yumm!  The chocolate was amazing.  I brought most of it back to the hotel with me as I was pretty full and put it in my coffee the next morning.  Uh, yeah, ridiculously amazing!   All in all a good experience even if I wasn't absolutely impressed with everything.

2014-07-19,3.0,"Ohhhh mr. Bayless, I am troubled in having to give you an average rating. Your cubana and the chicken tortas were very tasty. The ahogada was decent. I did enjoy the crunchy toasted bread you used. And your tasty churros. And I was impressed by the seating system. But you have failed miserably when it came to the pozole. And the chocolate. And the guacamole. The chicken pozole was room temperature, and had wayyyyy too many spices that overpowered any other taste. Did I mention I only found 3 pieces of bite size chicken in there? The hominy in the soup was harder than any rigor mortis I've seen. Why?? And I understand you are gifted when it comes to creating culinary treats, but what's with the ""fully dressed guacamole""??!! It looked as appetizing as my neighbor's bird food. Except I doubt they would try it. An excess of ingredients doesn't always guarantee the best flavor. Sometimes simple is best, and tastier. Just please don't call it guacamole anymore.  And now for the chocolate..... Why must you make it soooooo rich? I don't have diabetes, but now I probably will after taking a sip of your Aztec hot chocolate. It was too sweet and gave me a headache afterwards. I appreciate your creativity and the fresh ingredients, but this was the first chocolate I had to leave behind.

The flavors are bold and unique. We tried the chocolate cafe con leche. The flavor was rich and creamy.  Then we had the fully dressed guacamole. While quite tasty, I think I would choose the almost naked version. Just too many flavors to blend or separate cleanly. For the main meal we had the pepito and pork belly tortas. Both were complex and satisfying. I love a fresh traditional torta. And these were sufficiently reverent, yet unique and bold interpretations. Still a workman's lunch and comfort food.  The bread on the pork belly torta was toasted too much for my taste, and maybe a little over sauced.  But we eagerly finished both.  We fished with the churros and a shot of chocolate dipping sauce. A bit over crispy, but still delicious.  One goes a long way. The seating for dine-in is assigned, and not particularly spacious. Understandable for the traffic I suppose. Service was well staffed but not consistently engaged. Some workers seemed to hang back or in their own conversations.  Made me suspect take out is the right choice here. And the restaurant has clearly made many efforts to make that work, but I can't review their execution.  I think they would better off with table service and higher prices for dine-in. But they seem to have plenty of business regardless.  At the end of the day, Xoco is a great, unique combination of Mexican flavors and cuisine for the price.

When I arrived, I was actually surprised at just how plastic it was -- the place felt like a glorified Chipotle.  There was no line whatsoever at ~11:30 on a Tuesday, so it took no time at all for me to be able to place my order at the counter, pay, and be seated. It only took a few minutes for the food to arrive, and, to be honest, I wasn't especially impressed.  The chips, salsa, and guacamole were all good, but there was nothing particularly memorable or exciting about any of them. I was even less excited about the Milanesa torta.  There was barely any fried chicken in there, and all I could taste were the pickled jalapenos, red onions, and cabbage.  The sandwich was also so greasy that the torta roll was completely soaked through. The real mood-killer was the fact that this meal cost nearly $20.  An equivalent -- and **much** better -- meal would cost closer to $8 at home.   Dining under the Rick Bayless banner certainly ain't cheap.

2014-07-06,5.0,"This was one of my must tries in Chicago when I came to visit and it really did live up to the hype. We came by for an early dinner so the wait wasn't too bad but we still waited a good 35 min. Servers here are super helpful and friendly. They are always updating you regarding the wait times and that ordering to go is always an option. Heads up that there are 2 lines so if you want a to go order make sure you let the workers know so that you don't end up waiting in the dine in line.  Now onto the delicious food! We got an order of chips and the fully dressed guacamole. I think that was hands down the best guac I had ever had. Every topping was perfect and complimented the guacamole so well. For the tortas my friends and I got 4 different ones and shared them all so we could try a bit of everything.  Ahogada: This one I was most excited to try due to all of the photos and reviews but honestly it was my probably my 2nd least favorite of the 4 tortas I tried. Don't get me wrong, it's an outstanding sandwich on its own but compared to everything else I tried it was just ok. The pork was super tender and the broth it came in was very good.  Pepito: This was one of my favorites and I highly recommend it. Everything in the torta went so well. The beef was super tender and the cheese and onions really made this sandwich great. Cubana: I love cubana sandwiches so I was really excited to try this one but it actually was my least favorite of the 4. Again if I didn;t have 3 other excellent tortas to compare to this would be a great sandwich on its own. Milanesa: My four friends and I all agreed that this was our favorite sandwich. It all took us by surprise it was. Just a warning thought, this sandwich is spicy. We can all handle our spicy foods but I was not prepared for the level of spiciness this sandwich had. The breaded chicken was perfectly cooked. Churros: These are by far the best damn churros I have ever had in my life. They are made fresh and the waiters will ask you to let them know when you are ready for them so its guaranteed fresh. We got ours with a shot of chocolate to dip but the chocolate was a bit too rich for us so we opted to just eat the churros on their own. Overall this is a great place and it definitely lived up to all of the hype that I had been hearing about this place. I really hope to be able to return soon.",0.9995,0.674,0.295,0.031,0.6229898989898991

Tortas are basicaly flat-round sandwiches. The ingredients that makes up a torta are similar to what you would find in a taco (guac, salsa, braised pork, etc). Xoco also grill their tortas so it will also have a pannini feel to it. Honestly, there are so many pre-design tortas that I don't really look at what food they offer (like soup/salad).

2014-06-27,3.0,"I was excited to try one of Rick Bayless' famous trio on this visit to Chicago.  I had heard that Topolobampo was the priciest and fanciest one, that Frontera Grill was the middle and still sit-down one, and that XOCO was the most casual with ordering at the front and many to-go options and casual seating.   All the locations are closed Sundays and Mondays, so we made our way here on an early Tuesday.  I had a vague idea of what to order and I know XOCO has numerous fans, but everything I ordered just didn't quite hit the spot for me.  I may just not like these flavors as much as everyone else.   Aztec Hot Chocolate - a very rich and thick hot chocolate with a hint of chile and allspice.  It's good, albeit a bit too sweet and thick for me.  I made the mistake of ordering this as my old drink, but it's a good counterpoint to the spicier dishes. Glazed Churro - Chocolate-Peanut.  I should have ordered the freshly made churros served with dipping chocolate instead of this.  The glazed churro was cold and hard and while the chocolate-peanut was good, I wanted something soft and warm.  My mistake. Ahogada Torta - one of their famous sandwiches and filled with pork carnitas, pickled onions, and then sliced in half and placed in a bowl with tomato chili broth.  The carnitas were good, albeit a tad salty, but I really didn't like the pickled onions.  Way too sour.  Combine that with the sour tomato broth and it was too strong a flavor profile for me.  Finally, add on that the sandwich bread was soggy from sitting in the broth and no one liked this.  Should have ordered the strictly savory carne asada torta. Pork Belly Vermicelli - this meal in a bowl was the probably the best item we ordered.  I loved the pork belly and mushrooms as well as the spicy and savory broth.  This was a Mexican fusion dish that worked brilliantly.  The weak points were the very thin noodles and the excess of potato that isn't even listed as an ingredient on the menu.   Overall, I'm super glad to have been able to stop by XOCO and finally try some of Rick Bayless' food.  Although a few of the very popular items I ordered were definitely disappointing, I think I may do better trying alternate selections from the extensive menu.  The Pork Belly vermicelli gave a glance at the potential for flavors, so I'll have to give it another try at one of his West Coast branches.

In the end, the heaviest weight on my rating rests on the food itself. To be frank, it's a confusing experience, primarily because this place advertises itself as a ""Mexican Food"" establishment. So the expectation is that there will be a dominant sense of traditional Mexican flavors, arrangements, ingredients and ambiance. That however changes as soon as you step in. The first clue, is that the majority of the customers are Caucasian tourists - but what do I expect? - I'm in Chicago. The ingredients are a testament to who they cater or who would be attracted to this place. So if it's not Mexican, then what is it? Experimental Mexican-influenced food.

2014-06-11,5.0,"Have been to Xoco three times - one was solid, the other two were bananas good. There are two menu items I can officially vouch for the hardest First, the Ahogada torta. It is a super simple carnitas sandwich, cut in half, served facing into a tomato and arbol chile broth. Without mincing words, it's one of the best-tasting things I have ever had. I credit the broth as my entry point into snobby foodie world - I never realized food could be some complex and taste so good. The other true winner is the Mexican hot chocolate. Unfortunately it is summer now, so it won't seem as appealing to many (insert winter coming up in Chicago joke), but wow. The fresh-ground chocolate taste is unlike anything else, and really captures something that people who love pure, dark chocolate will especially love.",0.9787,0.772,0.195,0.033,0.507900432900433

To eat in, you have to tell the host that you want to be seated. You can only order after you have been given a table, but you pay for what you order first at the register. There is a separate take out line. I enjoyed the short rib red chile soup which had fresh vegetables and arugula. It's not spicy at all, but just the right touch of heat.  if you eat in, you can help yourself to regular or sparkling water. The host and waitstaff are very nice and have great energy.

Even dipping into the chocolate sauce that came with it didn't help. I suppose since we've had ones that were so much better in Barcelona and Paris, these just couldn't hold a candle to those. The hot chocolate with steamed milk was another huge disappointment. I expected a frothy Mexican hot chocolate like the ones I had in Mexico, but what I got was a variation on the European version--thick and syrupy.

Negatives: The meals aren't huge.  Chips & salsa cost extra ($3): It's a nice, if small, 3-salsa setup, with very good chips.

Experience: We first came upon this restaurant one of the first times I visited Chicago, we were looking for somewhere to eat before dinner and it turned out Xoco was right across the street from our hotel. First impression of the place was that it was quite small and packed, which could only mean one thing. The food must be really good.

As you entered the restaurant a seating host asks you how any people are in your group and gives you a table number.  As I mentioned before the line can sometimes be quite long and seating is limited but we have never had trouble finding a seat and while in line you can order a drink while you wait or simply serve yourself a glass of water.

The long line for ordering and the cramped counters add to the experience in my opinion but I get why it's not for everyone.  XOCO is full of choices that provide a unique opportunity to experience food you thought you knew & loved in an entirely different light and on an entirely different level. Our two tortas offered intense & glorious flavors with perfect textures. The Cuban with bacon and Avocado? While not traditional ingredients for a Cuban, they all worked to enhance what was already a perfect sandwich line up. My Cochinita Pibil with suckling pig was really nice. The bread was super chewy and complimented the soft and beautifully cooked meat. As my food was being delivered to my seat, the server said under her breath ""watch out the sauce is hot!"" and HOLY HELL she wasn't kidding! Ouch! The super hot habanero sauce is thankfully offered as a side. If it was served ON the sandwich, it would have ruined it. There was a moment after I took a bite of our Chicharrones covered in Tamazula hot sauce, and then dipped my sandwich in the sauce when I realized I had gone too far. The heat sweats set in, and I was filled with a tinge of regret. Thankfully a couple of chips dipped in our ""fully dressed"" quac eased the pain. And in regards to the quac... covered in chicharron, bacon, pumpkin seeds, and hell I don't know what else but it was really good. Definitely get some quac as a side. It's worth the eight bucks.

We chose to get our tortas to go and stand up in the crowded loud small dining area against the window.   Not being from Chicago we are not used to as many people so this is why I rate the over all experience 3 stars.  I would have rated 2 stars in my home city.   The food was average. I have been to Mexico and have eaten a real Mexican torta. The conchinita pabil  was small. It didn't come with a side or a drink. The cost compared to quantity and quality of service in my opinion is average at best. We would have tried breakfast but it was closed Sunday.,0.5499,0.969,0.031,0.0,0.3909090909090909

2014-05-14,3.0,"Three stars. It pains me to give a place with such potential for delicious wondrousness only three stars, but they have had two misfires on the four items I've tried. The setup is this:  You walk in and veer to the right to line up to place your order, and then you're seated. If you want takeout, you order at the near register and wait. Pandemonium ensues. Workers are whizzing by left and right grabbing orders, delivering orders, carrying bottles, etc. Try to suck in so you're out of the way. 1st visit:  Nothin but churros. Light, delicious awesomeness with the right balance of crunchiness and chewiness. Thumbs up. Our order was screwed up, so we got free sides of ice cream. 2nd visit: I was craving posole like OUT OF MY MIND, was guided here by Yelp, and was so excited.  Fifteen minutes after calling in my order I arrived and let them know I was there to pick up. And waited. And waited. Finally, 35 minutes after my initial order, I was like DAMN, is it ready or what? Yes, it was. Someone had prepped the bag and promptly stuck it under the counter, having never called out my name. Mind you, I never budged. I did get a free juice out of that, but I was STARRRRVING. 2nd order screw-up. So, the posole flavor can best be described as middling. Wasn't because it wasn't piping hot. It just lacked the flavor punch that traditional posole is known to pack. If I'd had all day and the right chiles, I could've way outdone this myself.  Third visit: On a mission to get takeout tortas, which is really what this place is known for. The Baja Chicken torta sounded a bit bland, but it was wonderfully flavorful. Don't be put off by the California-ized-sounding ingredients and name.  The Cochinita Pibil torta? Suckling pig on flaky bread? What's not to like?? Well, let's just say that if you enjoy torture, this is for you. Now, I'm not some wuss that doesn't enjoy spice. I've been known to delve into the Indian and Thai food adventures. But this torta was so hot, I had to grab a Greek yogurt out of the fridge to soak my tongue between bites. A cold beer only made my taste buds scream in agony. This torta starts off amazingly tasty with just a kick. But that kick builds. It builds with every bite into something insurmountable by any means known to Whitepeopledom.  I'm usually down with a bit of habanero. But this? The amount of habanero heat in the Cochinita Pibil torta nearly did me in. Easily one of the top three hottest things I've eaten in my life, right up there with a murderous Shrimp Creole and the Beef Vindaloo by Satan. I can't help but think the torta would be 10x better--one of the best things I'd ever eat--if the heat were toned down considerably. I could tell that it was delicious underneath my screaming taste buds.  UPDATE: So, duh, the habanero is actually in the sauce they give you. WHY DIDN'T SOMEONE TELL ME THAT?! I poured the whole shebang all over my first torta without knowing it was like booking a date with death. NOW they warn you when you order. Much more tolerable now that I know it's all about how much sauce you use. CHURROS: A POSOLE: D BAJA CHICKEN TORTA: A COCHINITA PIBIL TORTA:  A if you're OK with foods that burn like THE FIRES OF HELL. D if you're not. Such delicious, excruciating pain.

2014-05-10,5.0,One of my favorite places to eat in Chicago. Would actually rather eat at Xoco than Frontera Grill. Torta's are not your ordinary tortas because they have quality ingredients and the bread is more like a toasted baguette-but perfectly crispy on the outside and yet doughy/chewy as you bite into it.  If you are a newb- I'd suggest the Ahogoda. It's a shredded pork torta that comes dipped in a spicy soup. One of my favorites is the pepito because the beef is so tender and the cheese infused and melted within sandwich with the aoli cream sauce makes it soooo delicious!!! The shrimp and chicken torta's are all good too. Each has a unique flavor or sauce that it's paired with and the ingredients just all play well together.  MUST MUST MUST is the homemade churros with the chocolate dipping sauce. Even my non-sweet tooth friends have expressed how much they love the churros.

I ended up choosing the specialty caldo as it was a limited time offering with crispy mushroom ""chicarrones,"" noodles, grean beans and some other veggies in a porcini-serrano broth. It was delicious! We also got an order of sikil pak, which is like a pumpkin seed hummus served with jicama, cucumber and tortilla chips, and to drink I had a delicious tamarind apple cider.

2014-04-27,4.0,"Bayless' most affordable outpost is a great spot for hearty sandwiches and soul-satisfying soups.   We stopped in for lunch on a Saturday and started off with the guacamole (topped with chiles and pumpkin seeds) and chips.  OK, but I've actually had better guac elsewhere.  The many topping choices provide novelty, but the guac itself is fairly simple, tasting mostly of mashed avocados.  I prefer a guacamole with discernible cilantro / onion / tomato etc., and found this one a bit one-dimensional.  Much better were the tortas.  We tried the Saturday-only special (goat barbacoa), which was good, and the ahogada, which was sensational.  The tomato-chile dipping sauce that accompanied the sandwich was so, so good, I wanted to sop up every last bit of it.  Lots of other tasty-sounding tortas on the menu, and I'd love to come back and sample them. We finished with churros (made fresh to order and served hot, 3 for $4) and a side of dark, complex chocolate dipping sauce ($1.50).  Unless you absolutely hate chocolate, that extra $1.50 is well spent, and provides a nice end to the meal.   We did wait a bit (about 15 minutes) to be seated, and at $20 / person it was pricey for an everyday lunch.  Service is pretty casual, and two of us ended up sharing our 4-top with two random strangers (kind of weird), but I guess they do that to keep the line moving.  On a return visit, I'd skip the guac and maybe call ahead to get my tortas to go.",0.9917,0.802,0.174,0.025,0.5420506912442397

It was basically very salty broth with lettuce, corn, very few pieces of chicken and some spices. $12 for clear soup totally not worth it. 2. We were seated facing a wall. Most of the seating arrangements here face a wall. When I go out with friends I like to sit facing them and not a wall. 3. They don't take reservation and you have to wait in line until your table becomes available. I have no problem with waiting if the food is good. 4. Service is pretty bad. My friends food came after we were almost done with our food. 5. I tasted the Saturday special goat torta that my husband ordered. It was alright but nothing exceptional that I would wait 30 minutes in line for it. I don't know how this place has so many good reviews.

They count onions as a topping although onions are in guacamole basically everywhere else. The base guacamole is essentially cilantro and avocados and each addition costs money. The guacamole portion was QUITE SMALL and you will have leftover chips unless you put just a tiny bit of guacamole onto each chip.  For $7 that = OVERPRICED. Other food did not look appealing. The bad reviews tell the story here.

I don't need a ton of personal space, just enough to feel relaxed and not in other people's way. At almost every angle, people were too close in proximity for comfort. The girl next to me said ""sorry"" to me more than a few times. In addition, the concept of this restaurant is influenced by ""quick service."" It was anything but quick. The service was slow, making our wait time more than 40 minutes. Because I am a fan of other Rick Bayless restaurants and his cooking show, I choose to push through the horrible wait. Unfortunately though, the food was not memorable. The tortas were too hard to easily bite through. As I chewed, the hard surface of the torta scraped my gums; It was a very unpleasant experience.

2014-03-15,4.0,"The food is absolutely great,  I've had a few of their tortas and they never disappoint.  However, there's a few things that keep it from a 5 star review.  First, (something they can't help), the place is very tiny and can get very crowded, so it's not a welcoming place to stick around.  Come, savour the food, and go!  Then, the food usually takes a long time to come.  I'm hoping this is because they make things fresh and quality doens't come McQuickly, but I think I've waited longer for my food than the time it takes me to eat it.  (It's very tasty, and I'm a fast eater).  Last,  because of Rick Bayless superstar status, for what it is, it's rather expensive.  I'm sure for not much more one could simply eat at Frontera and have a great time, or for significantly less drive to Pilsen and find some really good Mexican food.",0.9621,0.854,0.134,0.011,0.4106349206349206
2014-03-14,4.0,"I came here to order takeout but wasn't expecting such a fast food oriented set up. Not a negative, just an observation. I ordered the Carnitas and Authentic hot chocolate. I initially planned to save the hot chocolate for after lunch but the cashier asked if I wanted it while waiting for my food. Good recommendation. It lasted my mere 7 min wait for the food and the cold walk back to my hotel. The hot chocolate, which is made with freshly ground chocolate was rich and slightly tangy. Took a little getting used to but thumbs up. And on to the main attraction: the Carnitas. Because I got it to go, the pork and soup came in a tall cup and the greens, onions, and avocado came in a smaller cup (FYI, dry ingredients go into the big soup cup. May seem obvious but I spent 15 secs debating which goes into which. A long day). This made my experience different than if I were dining in and eating out of a bowl because every once in a while, I'd stumble upon something in that deep ol' cup that I forgot came with the soup. Avocados? Oh yeah! Dumplings? Yes! Although the dumplings were just ok.  Everything else was very, very tasty. The flavors of all the different ingredients came together so nicely and the pork was so tender. And the portions may not look impressive in that cup but I had to take a nap after mine.

2014-03-08,2.0,"I used to love this place. Maybe it was an ""off"" day for them, but judging from the lack of customers that used to line up out the door, maybe not. I'm pretty busy and don't Yelp as much as I should, so something has to be out of the ordinary on either the positive or negative to get me to spend time on a review. Chicago is overflowing with incredible options and I've always found Yelp to be helpful when I'm deciding where to go on a given day. If I see low stars, I scan the review to see if the reasoning is something that would impact me or not and make my decision. I typically don't mind when a review marks down for service unless I'm going to a very high end establishment - most service related issues don't bother me. However, the consistently terrible service from Xoco gets my attention now because unfortunately, the food was equally awful this time. They have an unusual system for ordering and getting a table, which is fantastic if it helps them manage large numbers of customers in a small space - but since it's not the norm and patrons don't typically know what to expect, it would be nice if they could refrain from allowing their thinly veiled contempt from shining through when a customer has questions. I've been coming here since they opened, and I'm honestly not sure if they've had turnover in the staff or not. The men who work here really bust their arses and seem to be generally okay with life. The women though... are consistently crabby, unsmiling, rude, terse, and cold. There is a definite ""look"" and style all these pretty, young Latinas have in common - that's why I'm not sure if there's been turnover or if it's the same bitter bunch each time I visit. (All the Hipsters in Logan Square look the same to me too, so no - it's not a racist thing - it's a haircut, makeup, clothing choice, body type thing). I've not worked in food service in my career, but I assume it's a tough job. I can't even imagine the random abuse these women must take from the crowds of tourists and pushy white people that filter through this place, but they could at least try to conceal how much they hate you when taking your order, taking your money, and seating you. I've been a major fan of their bean to cup chocolate since they opened, but today, sadly.. my ""Classic"" was watery and weak. I only drank about 1/4 of the small cup before deciding it wasn't even close to being worth the calories. This pains me! At first I thought maybe it was because I've been spoiled by Catherine Anne's drinking chocolate or Mindy Segal's Hot Chocolate, but nope. This was crap. Then I tried the formerly mind-blowing fresh churros. They used to be pillow soft, warm, and dusted lightly in crushed cacao nibs and raw sugar. These were overdone, hard as two day old bread, and buried in about 4 times the sugar they needed. Terrible. They snapped into a zillion bits when trying to pry off a bite. Okay... the scone or as they call it - biscocho. I would have told anyone that Xoco had the best scones in Chicago last month. This one was Mexican Chocolate. It was also tasteless, had the consistency of a muffin (GAH!), and had something disgusting and gooey inside that did NOT belong there when I broke off a bite. Wow. I'm just so disappointed. Maybe the quality has really suffered in the months since I've been here, maybe it was an off day - but for everything to have gone so wrong? I don't think so. I rely on other reviewers to let me know when something has changed so drastically, so here I am - doing the same. It's just no longer worth fighting the tourists, the traffic, the lack of parking, paying their highish prices, tolerating the open contempt of their female staff, for inedible and sad mexican ""street"" fare. I'll probably try again some day after I've let this experience wear off, since it used to be so so so wonderful, but not for a looooong time. Adios.",-0.9957,0.758,0.087,0.154,0.5367195554445555

2014-03-07,3.0,"In my opinion, celebrity chef restaurants have become the high end McDonald's of the food industry. Once a chef achieves a certain level of notoriety, everyone apparently wants to eat at their place, and that means its important to get customers in and out. Food then has a very pre-packaged feel to it.  Overall, these places tend to piss me off.  My experience at Xoco was no different. And despite the fact that the food is assembled in front of you, it still feels very McDonalds-like in its methodic style.  We made the mistake of coming here on a Saturday night at dinner time, when there's a line almost out the door. And for a place that looks and feels a lot like Chipotle, I wasn't in the mood to wait in that long of a line for a snack.  My wife placed our order, and thankfully we were taking it to go because we got to avoid the long sit-down line and were taken care of slightly faster. They might as well have put that extra cash register out side and made room for one more table. I got to watch sandwiches being constructed using a fired oven and also saw the guacamole put together.  We only ordered hot chocolate and loaded guacamole, but I think I got the full Xoco experience even in just that. Both items taste just like the stuff you can buy at a grocery store. I'm sorry, but they do. There's nothing wrong with the offerings here, and they're quite tasty. But the celebrity name tag and price tag that get slapped on them seem a bit ridiculous to me. Oh, sorry, I took too long. It's probably time for the next reviewer to step up. In and out as fast as possible, don't you know.",0.3881,0.894,0.056,0.05,0.5532539682539682

The shortrib red chili soup was warming and hearty.  The combination of tender meat, fresh vegetables and tomato-ey broth was exactly what we needed to brave Chicago's frigid winter. And of course, the Churro.  The star of the show was heavenly.  We had no shame placing a second order of these crispy, pillowey dessert and even less shame licking the cup of chocolate dipping sauce.

By the time you get to the second half, it has soaked up a lot of broth already.  The bread manages to hold its shape with the added liquid. So yummy.  They also offer differing spice levels for that sandwich depending on what you can handle. I love the hot chocolate and the churros.  I'm not a big dairy person, so I was thrilled to find non-dairy hot chocolate.  But even for you dairy lovers, this is rich chocolate stuff.  You won't miss the dairy and if you do, you don't have to go authentic, you can get a thick, milky concoction. Yes, the line and seating business can be complicated but the host usually handles it with grace.  The other night, he offered to seat me while I was waiting for my dinner companion to ensure we got a table.

2014-02-05,4.0,"I have mixed emotions about Xoco. On the one hand, it's really good. The food deserves 5 stars, but isn't this suppose to be the ""more affordable"" version of Frontera and isn't this suppose to be America's version of Mexican ""street food?"" I've been to Mexico, many times, and let me tell you I have had some mind blowing street food and it did not cost $15 for one item. Yeah, that's my beef with Xoco. I have been there a few times to check out the tortas and they are so good, but $12+tax+tip will leave you just over $15 for one torta and that's if you get the free water to drink.  To be honest, I have had a talk with myself, and by myself I mean my meager budget, and we agreed that I would only go to Xoco for the Ahogada: Golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, and pickled onions. Um, it comes to you standing on end in a bowl of chile sauce goodness! Get out, that's so fun. And in my opinion it's the best, most exciting thing on the menu. So ""we"" have agreed Ahogada, yes. Pozole, ok yes, on a cold day. Churros and Mexican hot chocolate yes, always. I can take or leave everything else.  My only other beef with Xoco is the incredibly absurd ordering/seating system. I mean, wtf? Did they get a hold of the DMV's ""best practices"" and go from there? You walk in and someone hands you a menu and says a number to you, but doesn't explain what that number might be used for as you make your way to the counter. Why the menu? There is a very large chalkboard with all of the food right in front of you as you stand in line and there's no where to dump the menu. The person taking your order ask for a number. Um, shouldn't you be giving me a number? Wouldn't that cut down on a lot of unnecessary confusion for staff and guests? Come on Rick, fix this. Stat. It's very silly.  All in all, the food is fantastic. And overpriced. I mean you gotta go because it's good, but if you're like me you won't like dropping a $20-$30 for a quick lunch every day of the week.",0.9972,0.752,0.205,0.044,0.6041237666237667

But I figured I could check out the local celebrity restaurant, and either get some work done or get in some people-watching while trying the highly recommended huevos rancheros.  On arriving, though, I discovered that the seating spaces are mostly along narrow counters - too shallow to take out a laptop - with the chairs all facing into walls. I was lucky enough to have a blank section of wall; my neighbors had framed photos encroaching on their plate-space. I was left with little to do other than compose this review. As for the huevos rancheros: the salsa was, indeed, delicious, with a round mouth-feel from the onions and a pleasant bite from thinly-sliced serrano chiles. But the black beans were almost non-existent, a thin paste spread between two tortillas, which were themselves drowning in the water from the tomatoes. When it arrived, I thought they'd brought the wrong dish. To my surprise, I much preferred the version I had at the charming  m.yelp.com/biz/sunny-sid…  - where they also had bottomless coffee for less than the price of an espresso here. One final note for solo diners: the waitstaff will not bring water to your seat; instead, you will have to head toward the kitchen to use the free dispenser, which obligates you either to bring all your valuables with you, abandoning your meal to possible premature clearing, or else to leave your belongings back at the table in the trust of your counter-mates.

2013-12-21,5.0,"When I was in town for a visit recently, a friend from back home (Texas) suggested this restaurant, and told me it was one of his favorite restaurants of all time. It did not disappoint. It was the perfect place to while away the time with a friend, and it made me forget the fact I was in a soaked business suit after getting caught in a fantastic thunderstorm.  I ordered a michelada and chips, salsa, and guac with two add ins (chiles and bacon) while waiting for a friend to brave the metro. The michelada was bright, peppery, and perfectly salty, and was just the thing to warm me up. The chips, salsa, and guacamole with chiles and bacon were addictive. The salsa and the guacamole were very fresh, and the flavors in the guacamole were complex, easily outclassing most I've had back home, a tough feat.  Per my back home friend's suggestion, my Chicago friend and I ordered tortas. I ordered a daily special with pork belly, and she ordered a short rib. Both the pork belly and the short ribs were melty and silky. The pork belly glaze complemented well with the arugula and queso anejo. The bread was lightly toasted, so texturally, there was a nice mix of soft and crunch to go with the fattiness of the belly.  We also had Aztec hot chocolates and a churro with chocolate ganache dipping sauce to finish off. The hot chocolates were delicious and had more chile flavor than I was expecting. But really, the best thing was the churro. Oh, the churro! It was a thing of beauty. In a simple knot, lightly dusted with sugar, moist, and crunchy without any greasiness, this was easily the best churro I've ever had. I don't really like dessert that much in general, but I could have eaten about 20 of those. The ganache was an excellent balance of sweet and bitter, and not too thick.  My only complaint is that you can only try Rick Bayless's food in Chicago. I wish I could get it in Texas.",0.9903,0.809,0.161,0.03,0.5864448051948051

The guy host there seemed to not care and gave us a what ever greeting. Usually they tell you what number to sit at but we were given no direction so we sat where ever. The guy brought us out drinks and put it on the high top next to the table we sat at. Didn't think that it was ours until he came back and put them on our table. When I was finished my boyfriend went to go ask one of the girls working there for a box to put my other half of my torta. She gave him a dumb look and them went. I mean it doesn't take much effort to get a to go box. We asked her where the hot chocolate we ordered was cause it was awhile since we finished eating. She gave me one, but not the one I ordered. Over all this place was disappointing since I have been really wanting to go. I didn't expect much because its kinda like a fast food place but c'mon.

The gunthorp bacon juxtaposed with cheese, smoky chipotle and anejo cheese was the perfect amalgamation.  Both were an explosion of fantastic flavors dancing on our tongues. We enjoyed these very much.  The dough for the Chorizo empanada was very light with a perfect crispy and chewy consistency. It was incredibly delectable! The freshly squeezed OJ was not worth $4.  What a rip off -- especially for the size that it was -- we expected more for 4 bucks!  We ate our food on the way to Macy's to see the windows and do some holiday shopping. We decided to go back again -- for lunch. We wanted to try their Tortas (this is a Mexican sandwich), but they weren't all that unique. Yes, we had high expectations for these tortas (after all this is a Rick Bayless owned restaurant). The Tortas were mediocre at best. We've had better and tastier tortas elsewhere. In fact, the best Tortas we had in Chicago are in the Pilsen neighborhood. Plus, this is where all the mom and pop authentic Mexican restaurants are located, so this is as ""authentic"" as it gets baby!  The portions are generous and the prices are super reasonable (at least half the price of what this joint charged us for their Tortas). For those who are from out-of-town and seeking authentic Mexican food you must explore the Pilsen community in Chicago. You will not be disappointed either. While you are in the Pilsen neighborhood check out the Mexican Art Museum, which is a FREE museum. It's worth a visit. Also, eating in the Pilsen area will fully satisfy your budget, your tummy and your taste buds. I believe that this restaurant is way, way too small and is meant to be a ""take out"" dining experience. Why?  Because this is a super small restaurant with limited space. We ordered the following for lunch:  Choriqueso with their homemade chorizo sausage, roasted poblano, artisan jack cheese and tomatillo salsa AND the Pepito which is their braised shortribs filled with caramelized onion, artisan jack, black beans and pickled jalapeño peppers. We rated the Choriqueso with three stars; we rated the Pepito with four stars. The Pepito was ethereal, but for the price it didn't have as much meat as we were expecting (especially for a $12 price-point).  We also ordered the Churros for dessert which were excellent. In fact, we were surprised to see this on the menu as it is not really a Mexican dessert. Churros originated in Spain and are traditional Spanish desserts developed centuries ago by Spanish shepherds. Originally, churros were about the size of a breadstick, and they were eaten plain or rolled in cinnamon sugar. In Spain, churros are still a very popular breakfast, snack or dessert.  Our lunch came to $21 and change (excluding tax and tip). I like Rick Bayless and his restaurant concepts are always spot-on. However, this restaurant didn't cut it for me. It was a bit expensive for what we got. We're glad we tried it though. It was a bit of a hit or miss experience, and it didn't meet our expectations.

So when I finally arrived at Xoco after a long morning of exploring the city, I brought not only my hunger but also my highest expectations. And boy, Xoco did not disappoint! The highly touted Ahogada Torta -- golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, pickled onions -- definitely lived up to the hype. It was rich and soulful and warmed up my belly. The mild acidity of the tomato broth also helped to cut through the fattiness of the pork. It was absolutely delicious! But what really blew me away was the Carne Asada Torta -- tallgrass flank steak, wild ramp chimichuri, local mushrooms, homemade crema -- which is the Tuesday Daily Special. The succulent grilled beef will make any carnivore happy, but that chimichuri was amazing! Tart and savory, it was the perfect compliment to the meat.

2013-11-18,2.0,"Dear Rick Bayless, What were you thinking? I cannot believe that this is YOUR restaurant. A famous chef and restaurateur? I'm just not sure right now and I'll tell you why... 1.  There is very little seating.  As we entered the host asked if we wanted to sit in high seats (bar style and also facing a wall) or at a table. I said at a table. She said it would be a communal table. She sat us at some 6 chair table with a group of 3 already sitting at it. This means my date and I were squeezed into a table with 3 other people we didn't want to sit with (and I'm sure didn't want to sit with us but were never asked).  I didn't know communal meant that you would basically sit on top of the other people that were there! I've sat at communal tables and never felt so awkward. 2.  Their descriptions on their menu are vague. My boyfriend ordered the ""Meal in a Bowl"" not knowing that means soup.  His assumption is that it is filling and an actual meal and not some watered down and oily substance with too many green leafs and a couple chops of meat.  So disappointing.  However, my torta was good.I ended up giving half of it to my boyfriend.  3.  While ordering we picked up a beer from their cooler.  The guy tells us that all those beverages aren't cold enough and that he would grab one for us in the fridge.  If none of the drinks are cold then why are they out for people to grab and take? 4.  The layout of this place is terrible!  The entire time dining we watched the servers, cooks, chefs, and managers go from one kitchen, out into the dining area, and then into another section of the kitchen. The entire time we listened to doors swooshing and wait staff dropping things on the floor and yelling across the room. Overall my experience at this restaurant was bad and I do not plan on going back. Mr. Bayless please come to Xoco and fix it up. It desperately needs your special touch because right now I can tell you probably never stop by.... Meagan",-0.9098,0.888,0.04,0.072,0.5804433497536945

2013-11-13,5.0,"!Vaya! That's ""wow!"" en Espanol. We decided to do a ""staycation,"" since we live in the suburbs and what better city to explore than Chicago?  In doing so, I decided that we had to try one of Rick Bayless' restaurants.  Since we were having some expensive dinners during our stay, I chose the least expensive option, Xoco, for our lunch on Saturday. I started with the hot chocolate, since we arrived before lunchtime, and I have to tell you that if you don't try this yourself, I don't like you!  I had the Aztec Hot Chocolate which had a spicy kick to it.  The chocolate itself was thick and creamy.  It was the best cup of hot chocolate I've ever had. The food here was so good!  The Cubana torta was better than any old Cuban sandwich.  The guacamole is not only super fresh, but you can add two additional ingredients so we went with the queso fresco and bacon.  The two salsas that accompanied the guacamole were also very good - spicy, but not enough to blow smoke out of my ears.  And the chips, oh the chips!  The tortilla chips were salted to perfection, not too greasy, and absolutely delicious.  My husband had a torta with chorizo and really liked it.   We ended our meal with the churros.  The pistacho glazed churro is the best churro I've ever eaten.  The previous day we had some at Churro Factory, which were also very good, but the pistacho one is unique to Xoco and a must-try. The food is reasonably priced.  If you go in with a bad attitude over paying $11 for a ""sandwich"" (it's a torta, first of all...) then you may be disappointed.  However, I was much more satisfied with this $11 ""sandwich"" than any other.  Our total bill (guacamole/salsa, two tortas, one beer, two churros) was just under $40. Don't avoid Xoco because you fear long lines.  They open at 8:00 a.m. on Saturdays, but they do not start serving lunch until 11:00 a.m.  So we arrived at 10:30 a.m. and I saw plenty of people sitting and eating breakfast, but nobody was in line for neither breakfast or lunch.  So we chose to grab a hot chocolate and waited outside until it was closer to 11:00 a.m.  We went back in at 10:50 a.m. and only waited behind a few people which gave us time to look over the menu.  Get here before 11:00 a.m. on a Saturday, and you won't have to wait. Xoco is best for a casual lunch or early dinner.  I wouldn't recommend it for a girls night out or a romantic date because the tables are squeezed close together to accomodate the crowds.",0.9917,0.837,0.12,0.043,0.588

I liked that we were instantly greeted and given a menu. Host gave some recommendations as we told him we were first-timers and I really appreciated that he tried to pronounce the dishes as accurately as he could. My boyfriend had the torta ahogada, I had the cubana, and we both had the agua de jamaica. I was really satisfied with my torta. It was cheesy and the salsa had a great kick. The bacon in my torta was a little too thick for me but it definitely gave it a good additional flavor to it. I wished the torta bread was a little fluffier/softer because I have braces and it made it a little hard for me to chew on.  I hated the lack of dish they used for my torta. It came in a basket (like school cafeteria basket) and it looked awfully cheap compared to my boyfriend's dish that came in a nice plate.  My boyfriend said his torta ahogada was too salty. I didn't try it because I was really enjoying mine but I'm sure I would've have thought the same (my salt-tasting sensitivity is usually more delicate than his). He tried mine and he liked mine a lot more than his.  Their agua de jamaica was a little different than what we are used to (we're mexican) because the agua was mixed with lemonade. We both thought the agua de jamaica was wayyy too sweet and acidic! We had to water it down to be able to drink it. We also ended up trying the churros and the hot chocolate. I was really expecting the hot chocolate to be the ""abuelita's"" hot chocolate mixture (to me, that is the traditional way to make mexican hot chocolate) and that is not what it was. We got the ""authentic hot chocolate"" and it was really hard too drink because it was so rich in chocolate. It reminded me of the hot chocolate that is served in Paris. We couldn't drink it because it was just way too much chocolate. My boyfriend thought the churros were amazing. I didn't think they were spectacular in any way.

I also had a churro and it was too greasy and undercooked on the inside. Oh well. I'll keep looking.

Ordered salsa and chips, the pork belly/bacon torta, a jamaica sangria, and pozole. Everything was delicious. The salsas had SO much flavor. Lots of Mexican restaurants don't make their salsa that good. My mom was a fan of the green salsa while I was a fan of the red. The torta was perfectly crunchy on the outside, full of flavor on the inside. Might have a little too much mayo for some people's palette, but it was JUST enough for me. I enjoyed every bite of it. I was surprised to see the pozole with a clear broth. Being Mexican, I normally make pozole with red chile. It was cool to see the pozole is made with chicken when it's normally made with pork. The broth tasted way too good to have been made with just chicken. I feel like the broth was made with pork for flavor and had chicken bits for added protein. I am not against pork, (I'm sure you can tell by me ordering the torta) and I make my pozole with chicken too. Squirt lots of like juice in there, throw in some of that fresh salsa for some spice, and you've got yourself a great soup on a cold day. I loved how much shredded cabbage was in there as well. Great crunch. The sangria was pretty strong and still yummy. Thumbs up to that. Ps: Rick Bayless came in while I was walking out.

There was no line at all when we got there, and the place just seemed extremely casual.  I ordered the short rib torta and grilled peach empanada for dessert.  Short Rib torta: It was good, but it wasn't spectacular. For $12, I had expected a thicker sandwich, whether it was more meat, more onions, more whatever, in between the two breads. I also didn't like how hard the bread was to crunch into, but that's just my bread preference. The meat was good though and their salsa made it even better. Still wouldn't make a full trip just to get a torta here though. For the price, it's a little overhyped.  Grilled Peach Empanada: This is what saved it for Xoco from me giving them 3 stars. The Grilled Peach Empanada was so amazingly good. It's basically an Empanada stuffed with diced peach, some cinnamon i think, and ricotta cheese topped with cinnamon sugar. SO GOOD.

2013-10-16,4.0,"***Rick Bayless' XOCO features a great Saturday chilaquiles special and their lunch tortas look very appetizing*** Rick Bayless' XOCO is a popular breakfast and lunch spot in the lively River North neighborhood in Chicago.  Bayless performed very well on Top Chef Masters and he has two restaurants in Chicago (the upscale and casual Frontera Grill and the more fine dining and Michelin starred Topolobampo), some surprisingly good tortas eateries at O'Hare, and even a line of salsas, chips and dry goods you can find in stores like Cost Plus World Market. XOCO is not a sit-down restaurant like Frontera or Topolobampo.  It is an order-at-the-counter spot where you can dine in or get food to go. I did not get to try XOCO's tortas, but I stopped here for breakfast twice.  XOCO features a mix of breakfast tortas, huevos rancheros, chilaquiles, churros, and French toast.  Their chilaquiles are dine-in only and vary in ingredients depending on when you go.  On weekdays, you can find chilaquiles with Samuel's cheese and tomato-serrano sauce and then the option of scrambled eggs or chicken.  A pork belly chilaquiles is also available on weekdays. On weekends, you can get a Saturday only chilaquiles special, which features crispy, crunchy tortillas and Samuel's Cheese but also caramelized onion, a baked egg, and guajillo chili sauce.  For an additional charge, you can add braised beef short rib. The Saturday special is the way to go.  The tortillas have a much better texture than their weekday chilaquiles where the tomato-serrano sauce makes the chips too soggy.  On the Saturday chilaquiles, the tortillas have a much greater crunch and crispier exterior.  The chips are nicely flavored too at the center with the very good sauce.  The braised beef short rib might not be the most generous portion, but the quality, flavor and crispy edge of the beef are all good.  The only thing that could have been better was the baked egg, which was a little too cooked so there was not much of a runny center. yelp.com/biz_photos/xoco… The weekday chicken and scrambled eggs chilaquiles are fine, but the scrambled eggs and chicken definitely do not stand out as much as the baked egg and the beef short rib. yelp.com/biz_photos/xoco… I also had their chorizo empanada, which was a mix of chorizo, scrambled eggs and roasted poblano in a pastry crust.  The crust was pretty good and not too dry.  The flavor of the filling was pretty spicy and good.  I probably would have preferred a moister and creamier filling than the more ground chorizo texture; however, I am not that familiar with empanadas so XOCO's version might be consistent with what most people would expect. yelp.com/biz_photos/xoco… Their churros are crispy and had a great sweet exterior.  I would have preferred more thickness so there was a soft and moist center to go with the good crispy exterior.  A good chocolate dipping sauce is also available. yelp.com/biz_photos/xoco… XOCO also features a variety of chocolate drinks like straight chocolate shots and hot chocolate.  I had their authentic hot chocolate and I thought it was okay.  It was a little too rich and strong for my taste. yelp.com/biz_photos/xoco… Service was good--friendly and quick. Prices are low, but portions are, for the most part, small.  Everything on their breakfast menu is in the $5-$7 range so you can sample different dishes, flavor combinations and proteins for $15. I really liked XOCO's Saturday chilaquiles, which is one of the best breakfast dishes I have had in a long time.  Their other items were more in the just decent range.  A lot of the food here is very appealing though and this is a very popular spot run by a renowned Chicago chef.  It is a must visit for locals or visitors for breakfast or lunch.

The house made chicharones were also very good, although not the best I have had. Alcohol is on the high side here, however non-alcoholic limonada was reasonable and tasty.

We got right to the front of the line, ordered up guac, chips and salsas, coconut horchata, barbacoa cabra, and a lovely chicken dumpling style soup.

In my opinion just as much as the quality of the food. So, here's my complaint: A control freak of a woman who sometimes opens the restaurant in the morning has started dictating where people should sit, even when the restaurant isn't full. She forces duos and singles to sit at the uncomfortable and cramped bar seats. Not only is she bossy and weird about it, staff is rude to people if they accidentally sit somewhere that's 'assigned'. They even stop by unnecessarily to taunt you that you'll have to move if the restaurant gets busy (even though it never is in the morning). Not everyone does this who manages or works here so it's unclear if this is a new policy or just this one woman and staff's dictatorial way of running the restaurant. I strongly dislike this new policy, if it is one, and this particular manager (and her morning staff) have rubbed me the wrong way on multiple occasions so I thought the repeated incidents warranted saying something. Personally, I think the restaurant should knock out that useless structure in the middle of the restaurant to create more booths and tables. Also, some people who work there will bring milk and sweetener to your table when they bring your coffee. Others expect you to take the coffee right away after you order and doctor it up (with sugar/milk) at the counter. Some are disgruntled and flat out rude (the lady today rolled her eyes, slammed the items on my table and walked away without responding to my ""thank you"") if you expect all to be brought to you. It seems like an organizational culture problem. Seems few people smile or like their job anymore. People act put out, controlling and rude. Very disappointing.

The line was quite long, and there isn't an area for you to sit down. However, it was worth the wait; estimated 20 minutes. Food: I ordered the Cochinita Pibil. My friend ordered the Ahogada. -Cochinita Pibil: The pickled onions add this tartness that really blends with the sweet, savory meat. Tons of flavor, but the habanero sauce is a double-edged sword! Take caution. DO NOT FULLY DIP THE TORTA INTO THE SAUCE. Your mouth will fall off and you will sh*t fire. However, if you just add a few touches of the habanero sauce to the torta, it really brings out all of the flavor.  -Ahogada: This was quite good as well. The tomato broth brings down the heat and gives a really warm flavor to torta. It seems more like a fall/winter dish. I recommend this, but I could not stop eating the Cochinita Pibil. Drinks: I had a margarita too, which was decent, but came in a pretty small glass for the price. Not really worth it, but good nonetheless.  Conclusion: Definitely worth coming back for Round 2.

The sitting area is quite small and probably holds about 50 customers at a time. At times, I wasn't sure if this was supposed to be a quick grab-n-go lunch place or a sit-down and enjoy some amazing Mexican cuisine place.  From my experience, if you want a table, you should do the following:  1) Flag down the hostess and give her the number of people in your party  2) Wait against the wall - even if part of the group got there earlier, the rest of the party should just cut the line and wait with the group.  3) Wait for the hostess to give you a table number - until you have a table number, you should not order.  4) Order and pay for the food at the cashier furthest from the door.  5) Water is self-serve so if you need to quench your thirst, pour yourself a glass of water before heading to your table.   6) Go to your assigned table.  7) Wait for your food to be delivered to your table  I thought the food was good - all the ingredients were really fresh.

But when I got to the cashier, she asked for my table number and told me I can't order if I don't have one. Somehow the ""table order"" person never approached us while we stood in line. Potbelly has a much more efficient system, maybe Xoco should take a page from their book... Anyhow, after ordering & sitting down, a waiter brought out chips & guacamole...which we didn't order. Turns out it was for the people next to us at the bar seats, who were give THE SAME TABLE NUMBER. huh?! Eventually they were able to figure out who ordered what and our food came out quickly. Friend & I got the pork belly and carnitas caldos. Which were so salty my mouth turned bitter after the first sip. Friend couldn't get past that first sip while I tried to pick out my carnitas from the super-salty broth. When we were ordering, we were told our hot chocolate & churros will be held until we're done with our dinner. Well they were not. Which I guess was ok coz we weren't going to finish our dinner anyways. The churros were freshly fried, which was nice.  The Aztec hot chocolate was interesting but was kind of watery because it was made with water, not milk.  This is by far one of my most disappointing dining experiences in Chicago. Yes, it's a cafeteria-style place so service is probably not at the top of their list, but they could certainly be friendlier about it, especially since they have a rather unconventional ordering procedure.

2013-08-21,4.0,"Xoco! I do not know how to pronounce you! I've heard it all X-O-Co, So-Co...and then there are those who simply avoid saying the name and say - Oh hey! Let's go to Rick Bayless's place! - which is unavoidably followed up by the question: which one?? He's got Frontera Grill and all its ""Fresco"" locations in the Chicagoland and North Shore area, Topolobampo, and of course the utterly-hard-to-pronounce XOCO.    Regardless of the name confusion, this place serves up some great food. Though, the menu presents quite the conundrum because everything sounds delicious. From their many varieties of tortas, caldos, and salads to all of the offerings of their guacamole bar to then all of the decadent dessert options, it is definitely difficult to decide on what to order!  On the topic of dessert, the selection here is insane and definitely something I'll have to revisit in my next trip here. The bean-to-cup chocolate REally tempted me despite the fact that I'd just been walking for miles and miles in 85 degree weather before I dined here. And of course their churros have to be amazing, especially considering the variety of flavors they come in. You can stick with the original or upgrade to a glazed churro that comes in variety of flavors: hazelnut, chocolate/peanut, or pistachio...add in a chocolate shot for dipping and hOLY yummm. The soft-serve ice cream also tempted me because it can be coupled with dulce de leche or chocolate sauce...oh my. Basically, everything on the pastry menu was irresistible: flan, empanadas, tres leches cake...wow, just wow.   With that sweet excellence established, I'll back up to how this shop operates.  So you walk in and are greeted by the hostess, who will ask you dine-in or carry-out. If dining-in, she'll tell you your table number. Remember it. She'll also hand you menus and direct you to the counter, where you'll order, pay, and tell them your table number. Once that's settled, the hostess will somewhat let you know where your table is, and you'll take a seat there and wait for them to bring your food over.  Simple as that.   Now for the food that we actually tried...everything was tasty. Fresh, bold flavors all around. The XOCO Salad was not only visually delicious, but rocked it flavor-wise as well. I had long before decided to order the famed-Ahogada sandwich and was not disappointed. For just $11, the sandwich was a good size and tasted great. This menu item is INCredibly messy, but undoubtedly delicious.   As mentioned, I'll definitely be back to dabble into some more of their menu. I was eyeing the woodland mushroom and pepito tortas, so I'll have to check those out in my next visit here. And unlike my most recent Xoco experience, I'm not thinkin I'll be able to resist all of Rick's sugary concoctions next time I drop in :-/",0.9886,0.854,0.112,0.033,0.5668320105820106
2013-08-20,5.0,"Disclaimer- I am a huge fan of Rick Bayless so this is probably a tad biased, but completely true. Xoco is the 'self-service' express location as compared with his other two nearby locations that are traditional sit down, and tough to get into, restaurants. Busy, bustling and loud which give it a street food feel. I ordered the Ahogada Torta which is essentially a pork carnita sub in a mexican au jus. Killer tender meat in a chewy, sourdough-like roll served planted in a bowl of delicious mexican red sauce. Bread meat and sauce all work together so well I never wanted this sandwich to end. My gf ordered the seafood caldo (soup) and it was brimming with seafood and delicious, especially the catfish! We shared a handmade guacamole with all the fixings. And finished with churros served with the most decadent rich Mexican chocolate sauce I have ever had anywhere outside of Mexico.

Delicious. All the flavors fit together perfectly in the torta and it was easy to eat. I finished on about 5 minutes flat. Our churros hadn't come yet, however, so we asked an employee about it.

I could taste that they were deep-fried similar to any other churro, but I felt that this churro had somewhat of a stronger hint than most. It definitely didn't take away from the taste though.

I tried two different tortas with my favorite being the Baja Chicken for $11.  The tender chunks of chicken topped with slaw, black beans and chipotle mayo was delicious, but the unusual aspect of this sandwich was that it was served on sourdough bread.  I've eaten a lot of tortas, but never on sourdough.  I must say that I prefer the traditional bolillo (French type bread), and also found Xoco's version to be a much smaller sandwich than average.  The small side of flavorful salsa was what made the sandwich successful.  The other torta that I sampled was the Milanesa, which consisted of a breaded and fried piece of flattened chicken (escalope) with beans, cheese and other tasty toppings.  This sandwich was good, but just not very adventurous for me.  The bread was toasted in more of a flat panani style which brings me to one of my gripes: They really should distinguish the type of bread used for each torta on the menu.   The Wood-Roasted Chicken Pozole for $11.50 was another item that I sampled, but once again wasn't overly impressed by.  The broth was flavorful and more complex than most pozoles that I've tried, but it lacked in spiciness.  When placing the order, I was asked what spice level I preferred: mild, medium or spicy/hot.  I chose the ""hot"", but found it to be no spicier than a can of Campbell's Soup.   I assumed that maybe they just made a mistake on the spice level, but someone else in our group ordered the same thing and found theirs to be mild also.  Unfortunately there were no spices or condiments on the table to add to the soup, and the place was way too busy to track down someone to ask.  There also wasn't enough chicken or hominy in the bowl that I sampled.   Overall, I'd say my experience falls somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.  It was good, but not at the level I'd expected from a Rick Bayless restaurant.  It's actually very similar to the sister ""Tortas Frontera"" located at O'Hare Airport, which earned 5 stars from me.  I'd happily visit Xoco again, but only if there is no long line.",0.9897,0.831,0.116,0.053,0.5540515577612349

When you get there, they will ask you dine-in or carry out.  As you gain your whits from seeing the huge oven that is baking their tortas, you grab a menu and the salivating process begins. I went on a Saturday night with one other and it was about a 20 min wait, which is not terrible at all for a restaurant this caliber. They do a good job of keeping you occupied as you wait to be seated.  You see the menu, the specials, get a cup of water.  They get your order before you get seated, which is kinda nice.  If you get drinks, they will make them there for you up front, so you can sip, while waiting. I had the saturday special which is a must try.  The Goat Barbacoa Torta (drooling)... It was like biting into heaven.  Crispy on the outside and oh so juicy on the inside.  A week later I am still dreaming about it.  The bread is amazing which makes me believe that any torta is equally heavenly. I also had the short rib calda.  I thought the soup would be amazing for lunch.  Hearty with a lot of vegetables and meat, it was a flavor explosion in your mouth.  A little bit salty, but I could see thing going really well with some of that bread. I made a mistake and did not have the churro to finish off the night.  Maybe not a mistake because this just gives me another reason to come back, but  I had a lavender flan and aztec spice hot chocolate.  Both were oh so good.

2013-07-19,5.0,"After a long day of sight-seeing, no dinner reservations, and having reviewed both TA and Yelp (thanks, fellow reviewers!), my husband and I headed to Xoco for a casual Mexican meal.  We noticed the outdoor seating when we arrived (too hot during this July visit, though), and headed indoors, where we were immediately greeted by a host and sent to a line.   A little overwhelmed by the quickness and the set-up, we scoured the menu quickly and apparently, with looks of uncertainty.  The host noticed and, coming to our rescue, explained the dishes to us, even sharing which were his personal favorites.  While waiting to order at the counter, you're given a table number by the host, which you then tell the lady behind the counter.  No table number, no ordering.   On our first night (yes, we returned for a second meal during our 6-day visit), we each tried a torta (a sandwich much like a panini) - he the milanesa and I, the cubana. Both were outstanding!!!  The homemade cilantro crema was rich, flavorful, and memorable.  What I liked about my torta was the thin cuts of meat, leaving the flavor to the mixture of all the ingredients, not just a pile of meat accompanied by the 'other stuff.'   We started with naked quacamole and chips (guacamole IS a food group in my world!). It was chunky, tasty, and easily dipped with the thick, homemade chips (some of the best we've had).  However, the amount of guac was rather small, just enough for the two of us, and pricey for its size.  If more than two in your party, definitely order two servings if you just can't live without it.    Two days later, my husband suggested, ""Let's go back to Xoco.""  Really? Excellent choice. The husband ordered his milanesa torta again, but this time, I went for the carnitas caldo (soup).  OMG!!!!!!! If I were stranded on an island and could have only one food, THIS would be it!  (Yes, even instead of guacamole.)  This 'meal-in-a-bowl' is fantastic: a light broth filled with spices, herbs, greens, and of course, carnitas, which were just the right amount of salty. As the soup sits before you, it continues to steam, which just deepens the flavors.  My husband laughed as I worked my way through the large bowl of 'delicious,' and kept talking about it even after we returned home from our vacation.  I've already searched the recipe online!      Rick Bayless has three restaurants in Chicago, all in the same area, and each at a different price point.  I'm betting all offer the same amazing food! If you're in need of a meal in a casual setting, be sure to get to Xoco.  And if you'd rather order and pick it up, we noticed LOTS of people doing that.  Fantastico!   Home now and ordering Rick's cookbooks online.... :)",0.9908,0.87,0.111,0.019,0.552786404416839

2013-07-13,3.0,"After watching the show on TV and being a big fan of Rick Bayless, I had been wanting to try this place. This was on my list to go when I visited Chicago. We stayed out in the suburbs and got up at 6:30 AM to avoid traffic to get here on time for breakfast. The system is a little weird here. The hostess asked us how many people were in the group and gave me a table number. We were table number 61. After that, we went to the counter to place our order. Daughter ordered the Huevos Rancheros, which was the best item. I ordered the Torreja and liked it a lot. The hubs ordered Saturday Chilaquiles without the braised short ribs. He got the short ribs anyway. His order was the most disappointing one. When his order cooled down, the food got hard and it was chewy. The tortilla got stale. We also order the churro and Mexican Hot Chocolate. The churro was delicious but the hot chocolate was WAY too sweet. Service and staff were unfriendly. After we ordered our food, the hostess brought us to the back of the place and we were immediately seated by the window, where the table was wobbly. I immediately spilled my Mexican Hot Chocolate. Hubs went to ask the hostess if they could fix our wobbly table. She tried but it was still wobbly. The hostess asked a worker to fix it but was told that no matter what, the table will be wobbly. Why the heck would they leave that table there if it's knowingly wobbly? I was peeved because the restaurant was empty at 8 AM and they wouldn't give us another table because the other tables sat 6 and we were the third customers. She told us that we could sit at one of those high chairs facing the wall. We said that we would rather not. So, she told us that she can sit us at a table for 6 next to the wobbly table but we have to scootch over because we have to be prepared that a table for 2 will be seated next to us. Well, the place never filled up. I would've given this place 4 stars but I had to knock a star off for the staff. I love Rick Bayless but I do not like his staff. Considering all the effort we made to get down to his place and to be treated like that is upsetting. I think I will stick to his cookbooks!",0.2644,0.881,0.061,0.058,0.4578148148148148

2013-07-10,2.0,I hate to give this place two stars since i was looking forward to it...i'd do 2.5 if i could.  I had a Bayless co gift cert so i went here twice and frontera express (in Macys once). First time i went for a snack and had the Aztec chocolate and Flan. chocolate was to rich and bitter but the flan was pretty damn good...maybe too sweet though. Second time had the baja chicken torta.  A little disappointed since i can always get a better torta at a local place in the burbs for a third of the price.  Bread was to stiff and the flavor wasn't all there...and portion way to small for $12....no sides or anything with that too.   Seating is a little to cramped at this place and you have to have a lot of time on your hands to wait.   I would recommend Fronterra express in Macys for more bang for your buck I give Rick props for the LEED building though and the decor is pretty cool and beer selection is the best i've seen in a mexican restaurant.,0.9678,0.781,0.16,0.059,0.5087301587301588

2013-07-06,3.0,"This is a tasty restaurant for quick food, but the seating makes ABSOLUTELY no sense. You walk in, and the host greets you (we arrived before the dinner rush). He asks if you want to sit at a shared table, or the counter. We say counter (which, um, is actually shared, because it's a counter). He says he'll come BACK to find us and tell us the table number. The place is not crowded and there are plenty of open seats in both areas, because we are there so early. Then, you go up to the cashier to order. The woman at the register asks your table number. We don't  have the table number. The host hasn't come back to tell us the magic number.  She says, ""I can't take your order without your table number."" Great. So we look for the guy and he comes back and tells us our number, which we then convey to the woman. Does seating need to be so complex, with so many variables that can go wrong? We order a torta, the Xoco salad with crispy chicken, and three churros with chocolate dipping sauce. Then the cashier says we will get dessert separately, and to ask the server for it when we are ready. Seating at the bar either faces the window (very few seats) or is at a narrow counter facing the wall, so it feels like you're sitting in a corner after being naughty.  We get our food and it's good, especially my salad. The salad is very fresh: spring greens, cilantro, crispy chicken breast (fried), black beans, creamy dressing on the side. Husband gets (I think the Cuban) torta. He says the bread is very hard, and I agree-- maybe others come with sauce or get juicy enough for the bread to soften, but his is hard (that's what she said! Hardy har har. I couldn't resist). Then, we're ready for dessert. My husband tells the guy who'd brought the food. The guy says he'll put the order in. We wait. Nothing. Husband goes up to the food counter and tells them we're missing our order. They say they will bring it right out. Nothing. 20 minutes. We see the host and he immediately sees we're looking around for something, and helps us out and gets us our churros. The patrons around us notice the churro situation and DIRECT the guy with the churros to us when they finally appear. The churros are really good.  However, the food doesn't outweigh the seating system and the whole neglected churro. I don't know why they don't give you a number to put up at your spot, like they do at Panera or Corner Bakery or everywhere else. The place is quite small. It would not be difficult to find a number. It would make way more sense.  Also, I do not like the fact that they ask for a gratuity up front, before you even get any service, because the dessert situation would have warranted a tip for a job less than well done.",0.9906,0.845,0.119,0.036,0.5286904761904762

Quite a busy place at lunch time so go early if you can otherwise you'll spend your whole lunch hour in line. If you're accustomed to exploring and finding a favorite taqueria then you may not be so excited about Xoco.  While the food is very well prepared the reality is you're paying a lot for something you can find at any number of great taquerias in Chicago, you just have to look for them.  I really do want to love the food here because I want to love Rick Bayless' cooking so it's a bit of a downer when I realize Rick Bayless isn't cooking for those accustomed to traditional moms with clay pots and handmade tortillas.  Rick Bayless is cooking for people in the Loop, Lincoln Park and River North.

I ordered the BAJA chicken torta and my wife ordered the vegetable 'meal in the bowl'. As i was eating my meal I began to think to myself that not only is this meal not awesome, it is also probably not one of the better tortas i have had. I have had tortas in Indy that were better. I tried my wife's bowl and that too was very average. All i remember was the place was super crowded and there were people everywhere and talking to my wife about not being able to understand the fuss. I have to admit though that the service was friendly and being able to catch up with cleaning tables and seating so many people one after the other was impressive.

2013-06-20,5.0,"100th Review! I had to save my 100th for a very special place to me. Not only for the food, but because I had my first date with my girlfriend here :) Okay, enough sentimental stuff. The sandwiches here are no joke. I've tried 3 or 4 of them and they are all delicious. They have a very diverse range of flavors: some are spicy, some are sweet, some highlight the meat while others are about the veggies surrounding the meat. My favorite happened to be a special that had flank steak in it (I can't remember the name or the ingredients for the life of me but I believe it had chimmichurri in it. Delicious.). I could re-write the same thing about the caldos but I won't copy and paste the paragraph above. But the best part is definitely the dessert. These churros must be hand rolled by angels because I can't believe how perfect they are. They're fried just enough to have the crispy texture, but the inside is still as soft as you'd want a pastry to be. Make sure you get the hot chocolate and the Mexican ice cream. Dip a churro in both and your mouth will literally be in heaven. The place is a little tight, trying to squeeze more people than what is comfortable, but once you're immersed in your food, you'll quickly forget about the people at the next table. It is a little on the pricey side but for the best churros I've ever had, I'm willing to walk out with my pockets a little lighter. Recommendation: 100 churros.",0.9962,0.745,0.225,0.03,0.5711279461279462

We had the carnitas and the Saturday special, the goat. I expected the sandwiches to be great but these even surpassed my expectations. What also surpassed my expectations was how well-rounded the meal was. We got the chicharonnes as well with homemade queso fresco, and for dessert we had a pistacho-glazed churro as well as the honey-lavender flan. The flan is life-changing: so cool and refreshing. The pistacho churro was good but in fact the people next to us couldn't finish their third plain churro, so they gave it to us, and we liked that even better than the pistachio-glazed because the glaze detracts from the warm crunch of the plain, cinnamon-sugar churro.  We also had the margaritas. Among the best I've ever had, but quite small for $10. But it's downtown so I understand that drinks are gonna be overpriced.",0.9885,0.78,0.209,0.011,0.5213203463203464

The Cochinita Pibil is composed of wood-roasted suckling pig with achiote, black beans, pickled onion, and habenero  (note: the habenero is REALLY spicy). Although the menu description of the suckling pig seemed amazing, I thought it was just okay, a bit on the dry side actually. The pickled onion went well with the pig and habenero, but overall we were much more impressed with the Ahogada. For dessert we ordered churros and chocolate.

2013-05-22,3.0,First of all I want to say that I am a big fan of rick bayless. With  that being said this restaurant didn't wow me like I thought it would of. I went here early in the morning because I was in the neighborhood so since me and my girlfriend have been dying to go to this place we thought we would take advantage. So here it goes...I really wanted a torta ahogada which is the only reason I came and when i go to order the guy taking my order tells me they dont serve lunch until 11. So disappointed i mean it made me feel like i was in a mcdonalds drive thru. anyways the lady hands me a full menu when i walked in only to realize that you can only order like 4 things. hello keep the menu if thats the case So since I was already there i might as well order something. So i ordered the chorizo and egg torta with churros and hot choco my girlfriend ordered the walnut french toast. Her food was very good we both enjoyed it. The hot choco was pretty good and the churros were decent she loved em however the chocalate dipping sauce wasnt all that. Here is my BIGGEST complaint...Where was the chorizo and eggs in this torta i ordered??? If your gonna charge me $8 for a torta i mean damn fill that thing up. I felt like i got robbed. however with that being said the bread was delicious and the sauces they gave me were absolutely terrifc. i will be going back but for lunch only.,0.7454,0.879,0.074,0.047,0.6701999999999999

The baja chicken is a personal favorite. Also, when it is saturday, the goat barbacoa is a great choice as well.   I also recommend following up your meal with an order of the churros accompanied with a shot of chocolate sauce.

Pretty unique pairing, but really lacking in the pork department. I'm from Texas, so you can't serve me a pork in a sandwich and call it a pulled pork sandwich. It's just not the same. Maybe it was a fluke, but the pork was overcooked. Also, I was expecting more cheese. I can't remember if there was any cheese to be honest. Cheese on the torta would've made it amazing.

I've always been a fan of Bayless, but haven't had a chance to try any of his restaurants until I tried Xoco last week. Then I went again a couple days later. It's just that good. My first visit I had the pork belly torta which is a special on Wednesdays. I really enjoyed this sandwich. There was a dark salsa negra glaze which brought a nice bit of heat to the sandwich, and the arugula and queso anejo married perfectly with the pork belly. There was a little bacon in the sandwich as well, and it brought some nice smokiness along. During my second visit I had the seasonal torta which was: tallgrass flank steak, wild ramp chimichuri, local mushrooms, homemade crema. Another home run. My only complaint with this sandwich was the chimichuri made the sandwich a bit oily, but it was so good that I didn't mind.  Of the two I enjoyed the seasonal torta better, but both were extremely delicious. You can really taste the great ingredients and care that go into each torta in every bite.

I know, I know, how exciting can chips and salsa be? But the chips were great and super corn-y, and that green salsa was delicious. The ok: -Hot chocolate. I tried two kinds (I can't remember which, but it was the ""traditional"" hot chocolate or something like that) and both were somewhat underwhelming, and in one case, rather lukewarm. I'd try a flavor at least once though. It's a nice, thick hot chocolate. The disappointing: -My ahogada torta. I ordered it with really high expectations, and maybe that is why I was less than thrilled. First of all, if I could describe the dish in one word, it would be: ""sour.""

Even at 3:30 pm (we thought we'd be missing the lunch rush) we were clearly mistaken. There was an hour long wait to be seated, so we opted out for the To-Go line.  Rick Bayless restaurant?! YES please- SUCH a good deal for price and flavor.  Don't be intimidated or overwhelmed by the menu- if you have the chance to dine in- I'd definitely recommend the ahogada- looked absolutely delicious. I regret not getting to sit down and try that.  I ordered the cubana and the milanesa- two flavorful sandwiches overflowing with meat. And to end the meal on a sweet note we got the churros and a cup of aztec hot chocolate (basically a chocolate pudding that kind of served as a chocolate dip for our churros rather than a drink) If I'm ever back in Chicago, I'm coming back here for sure.",0.9625,0.769,0.176,0.055,0.5194444444444445
2013-04-27,5.0,"Is Xoco overhyped? No way. The hype is all true! Got here around 10:30 today hoping for an early lunch when we discovered that they didn't start serving tortas until 11. No biggie - we just watched them prepare the food creepily through the window. We got into line around 10:45 and there were already 20+ people in line ahead of us. I have to say that Xoco has this line thing down to a science. They started taking orders and assigning tables at 11 and we were already to the cashier by 11:05. I filled up on free sparkling water and waited in anticipation for our food.  I ordered the torta ahogada due to my love for carnitas. I feel the same way about carnitas as most people feel about a nice juicy steak. The torta was a flavor explosion in my mouth with the spiciness of the broth, the hint of lime and the beans & onions all mixing together. Every ingredient had its place and was destined to be together in my sandwich.. The part of the bread that was soaked in the broth was soggy and the other half of the bread was crunchy but the best part was the bread near the middle. The broth was a bit spicy for me and I found myself sucking down multiple glasses of water. You do get your choice of salsa -- mild, medium or hot. Next time I'll go for the mild instead of the medium. Of course I couldn't leave without trying one of their famous churros and homemade chocolate dip. The chocolate was bittersweet, while the churros were sweet-on the borderline of making my teeth hurt. I loved how the chocolate neutralized the sweetness of the churros. The biggest crime was that I didn't order more of them. Can't wait to try more restaurants by Rick Bayless. He's a culinary god!",0.9528,0.858,0.1,0.042,0.4710905349794239

It's cut in half and dipped into a bowl full of tomato broth, which I thought was a little one-dimensional and probably could have done without it. I loved the pulled pork and the subtle chile sauce though! Frankly, I thought my friend's torta milanesa was better, which as a crispy chicken cutlet with jack cheese and a bomb avocado salsa and cilantro crema. We also got the pickled pigs feet, which I did not like at all -- the combination of the sour from the pickling and the feet texture did not mix well.

2013-04-15,4.0,"Wow, Chef Rick Bayless. W.O.W.  I'm a girl who loves sandwiches...there are _sandwiches_ but then there are TORTAS. It's a whole other level, y'all! I took a star away because, like some other reviewers noted, it's pretty confusing how the seating/ordering works. Also, we got there at 2pm and the wait was like 40 minutes. I think I'll try to get in earlier or later next time...So basically, you have to order first and then get seated. BUT, you can only order once you're given a table number. If the host or hostess doesn't give you a table number, then you can't order yet. So you just stand there at the register and wait for a table to become available. And then you can order once you get your table number. Got it? Good. OK, on to the food! There were 4 of us, so I made the executive decision of ordering a bunch of different dishes so that we can all share. Heck yeah! Vuh-Rye-Uh-Teeeeee.  TORTAS: The Ahogada torta comes with the pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, and pickled onions. They top the torta halves on top of the tomato broth and serve it that way. By the time you take a bite, the warm soup has seeped into the bread for added flavoring. I mean...wow! This was the group favorite fosho.  The seasonal torta was the Pork belly with tomatillo sauce, chicharrón, local spinach, queso fresco, and black beans. This was one of my personal favorites. I do love my pork belly! Cochinita Pibil: Woah, when they said the salsa was spicy, they meant SPICY. It's definitely got a kick that's reminiscent of the red sauce at King Taco or El Taurino. Finally! I've found a match!!!! This torta came with wood-roasted suckling pig with achiote, black beans, pickled onion, and habanero. I think the sauce was overpowering, so it was difficult to really taste the sandwich itself. Once you let the heat calm down a bit, the torta itself can be enjoyed. But beware of the hot sauce! Maybe try the sandwich before you dip it in the salsa? SOUPS: Shortrib Red Chile Soup: Braised Tallgrass shortribs, red chile broth, roasted vegetables, epazote, wild arugula, lime. This one was the group favorite soup-wise. It reminded us of a spicy Korean soup called Yook-gae-jang. It's a refreshing type of red broth that paired well with the different tortas. Wood-Roasted Chicken Pozole: Gunthorp chicken, pozole corn, rich broth, crunchy garnishes, ground red chile, lime. I kind of wish this was spicier or something. But maybe with all the amazing flavors of the other dishes, this one was sort of overpowered? It's a clean chicken broth with a lot of veggies. Someone from our group called it a poor-man's-soup haha. There was some leftover so I took it home. I'll probably add some Tapatio to it to add that extra kick. --------------- The guacamole and chips were nothing special...I don't know how crazy you can get with guac, as long as the avocado isn't going bad. **Highly recommend that you try the Churros with the chocolate shot: amazing! The chocolate has just the right amount of bitter sweetness, like a good dark chocolate sauce should be. Make sure you enjoy the churros when they first come out, so that it's hot and crispy.",0.9989,0.783,0.202,0.015,0.5448761423761422

First, the line moves super slow..annoyingly slow. The line on a Friday night was surprisingly short but it took at least 20 minutes to move only a few feet. We finally gave up and got into the line for take out orders. What else annoyed me? The fact that you can only have the ahogada torta if you dine in the restaurant. I get that the sandwich has a broth that comes with it but why can't you get it on the side in a separate container and take it to go? We were told that we could choose any other torta on the menu and order broth on the side. Except for the ahogada. No exceptions. Whatever. Instead of the ahogada torta, I tried the smoky garlic shrimp torta (the Friday special). It was okay but definitely not as great as I was expecting it to be.

2013-04-07,4.0,"This is a great concept for a restaurant--gentrified Mexican street food. I will say that the lunch fare is strong--I mean, it is really good. Rick Bayless knows food and knows Mexican food. Read his cookbooks and you will see what I mean. I have spent serious time in the deepest bowels of non-tourist Mexico (strike that image from the record, your honor), and I have eaten at more Mexican back-alley food carts and markets than I care to recall. I have the intestinal scars to show for it and regret nary a one.  The food at Xoco is authentically peasant in its approach and decidedly refined in its execution. It really hits the high points of any food-serving Mexican market--tacos al pastor, the selection of tortas, aguas frescas, caldos... Imagine walking down a street in any small, unknown-to-you Mexican town and coming across a taco cart, torta cart, corn cart, etc. Take that basic food concept and have a really inspired chef sprinkle it with additional culinary knowledge and inspiration while at the same time holding on to, and never looking down on, what it is--typically inexpensive food of honest, humble origins that accounts for how millions of Mexicans eat daily.  This is Xoco (short for Xocolatl, what Moctezuma drank daily and what became known as chocolate.)  Street food elevated to an art.  Regarding breakfast--I am glad they open for the morning hot chocolates, churros and empanadas, but meh, not going out of my way again for Xoco in the morning before they begin serving actual food they are properly known for.   4 people can eat lunch for $60 with drinks, $50 without.  But to tell the truth, don't look at the prices.

The tortas at XOCO are much tastier and better prepared than at Frontera Fresco.  At the recommendation of the cashier, I had the Ahogada, which is available for dine-in only. It's pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce and onions. So good! The torta stands upright in a shallow bowl of soup and it was a delicious pairing. Great choice if you are a meat lover like me. I love spicy food and dipped the sandwich in their habanero sauce, which is preeeettyyy spicy but a really great addition to the torta.  A friend and I also shared an order of chips and guacamole. Can't go wrong with guacamole! Not enough chips, but plenty of guac and salsa. I've never gotten a drink there besides water, but they have a great selection of beers and a few wines. $10 margaritas.  We went at 6pm and the line was a decent wait. Probably about fifteen minutes but it was well worth the wait. Remember that there is a shorter line if you are looking for just take-out and not dine-in. The line to the right is for a table (for which the hostess will give you a number while you are in line) and the line to the left is for take-out. Go elsewhere if you are with a group because it's always busy. Despite the quick table turnover, it's a small space with few tables (mostly high-tops) Definitely go to XOCO if you get the chance.

We went the other night, ordering the soup, the Shrimp Torta & a whole mess of beers. The Soup as I said before was amazing. While it was spicy, it was not overpowering and had an amazingly fresh mix of flavors, all balancing off each other (arugula & tiny dumplings for a nice mix to the heat). The pork was perfectly cooked & crispy almost like a pork belly. I had a bite of the shrimp torta and the shrimp were huge & cooked perfectly plump. As we went on a Friday night, a large sampling of beers were absolutely necessary. They had a pretty good sized mix of beers but as the display case was really warm, we luckily asked if they had chilled ones in the back which they did. As an avid craft beer (& IPA) drinker, I was impressed that there were numerous Cans (go figure) I had not heard of but were excellent. The food was 5 Stars easily but they lose 1 star for the organization of service. When we arrived, we were greeted and told to wait in line. 20 minutes late (seems pretty average compared to other reviews) we went to order and they asked our table #. We never had one and they said we needed to get a table # before going in line to order (but WHY would they tell us to go in line when we got there and not give us a #???). The exact same thing happened to the couple in front of us too. Luckily they were able to get us table #'s within 2/3 minutes so we were able to wait at the counter and then order.

We got the Smoky Garlic Shrimp, the Torta Ahogada, Chicharrones and Homemade Mexican Vanilla Soft with Churros. The Chicharrones were ok, they weren't stale, they were very thick and crunchy. Liked the sauce but wished they could have spreaded out the sauce more evenly, along with the onions and cilantro. The Ahogada can be described as bold. It was at a nice spicy level at medium. The bread was at a perfect level of crunchy and you could make it was soft as you wanted it to be by dipping it into the soup. The soup that came with it was good, it went well with the torta. The carnitas were so good. Honestly though, I preferred the subtleness of the Smoky Garlic Shrimp. The shrimp and the muskiness of the goat cheese went so well with the garlic and chipotle sauce. It was with this sandwich the bread shined through, the bread just complimented the fillings so well with its crunch, softness and slight sweetness. The star of the night though was the mexican soft serve vanilla with churros. The churros weren't overly sweet nor overly seasoned, it was a light dessert that was good by itself and went well with the ice cream. Though it was just soft serve the vanilla here isn't your run of the mill vanilla. It was much deeper and richer than the average vanilla.

I had the one with the pistachio glaze. All in all, it was a wonderful experience. It's also nice that the restaurant is very affordable. I was able to get a torta and a churro and spend only $20 (including tipping the staff). The only improvement I can suggest is that XOCO move to a bigger space. When we were there I could tell that it's wildly popular and they could barely fit all the customers inside. Also, because the space is so small the protocol for ordering and being seated was a bit confusing to us when we walked in.

2013-02-04,5.0,"The concept behind Xoco (which translates to ""little sister"") is ""contemporary expressions of Mexico's most beloved street food and snacks.""  Basically, you come inside and tell the hostess how many people you have in your party.  If they have a table available for you, they allow you to order at the counter and the food comes out steaming hot about 10 minutes later.  If they don't have a table available right away, you hang out until one is ready.  The staff is really knowledgeable and basically suggested everything that my boyfriend and I ended up ordering including: Chicharrones (fried pork rinds), carnitas soup (meal-in-a-bowl), pepitas torta (shortrib) and churros.  Everything was beyond delicious.  It was one of the best lunches I have ever had and I can't wait to come back over and over.

These cost about $10, $2.50, $3.50 respectively.    Churros is something I had the least expectation, but it ended up the best thing I got at XOCO. With a little exaggeration I could say XOCOs Churros is glorious. Churros was crispy out, soft inside, sweet, and hot. It was easily the best Churros I have ever had and I say it is worth visiting XOCO just for Churros.    On the other hand, the famed Hot chocolate and Ahogada didn't leave up to exception.    Hot chocolate was rich. I give it that, but that was only highlight and the rest was mediocre. I failed to see why so many people were fascinated by it.     Ahogada was decent, but its quality did not defend itself from being labeled overpriced. Bread baked in wood-burning oven was good, pork was marinated just right, and the spicy tomato soup was quite authentic. Overall, the sandwich didn't present anything beyond being decent.    It's worth a visit for over priced, authentic sandwich, but worth multiple visit for great Churros.",0.9966,0.725,0.258,0.017,0.5392526455026456

I had read about this place, and thought I'd try out the pork belly vermicelli. I thought it was pretty solid. The broth towards the top can be a little thin, but if you let all the avocado and pork belly settle in, you'll have some wonderfully warm comfort food to make the cold Chicago night not so frigid. The pork belly is superbly done, and probably the best part. I felt there might have been a touch too much cilantro, taking away from the heartiness of the broth, but I'd never had it before so I couldn't judge.

Still, getting a seat at Xoco can be a beast, so I highly recommend skipping on the meal and just coming here for hot chocolate take out.  The hot chocolate is bean to cup, which means it wasn't sitting in a bar or powder before it was made into a delicious steamy beverage, it was still a cacao bean.  Or something like that.  I usually get the chocolate and water. You don't need any dairy for this hot chocolate to be the richest and most creamy hot chocolate OF YOUR LIFE. Add in an order of churros and you are good to go.   The moral of the story is, the food is good but the hot chocolate is the star.  Waiting in line is the pits, so save up and go to Frontera and stand in line there.  Get the hot chocolate to go for your evening stroll through the beautiful streets of Chicago.  Mmm.",0.9965,0.769,0.217,0.014,0.5515384615384614

Nope, you order at the counter and then have to wait for them to seat you so you could be waiting for an hour like any other restaurant.

2013-01-18,4.0,"Right off the bat XOCO made a good impression with their very attentive service. My buddies and I arrived just before they started serving lunch at 11. I guess they know how awkward it is to transition from breakfast to lunch but they had a hostess guide us through the ordering process, which was a little complicated with all the separate bills for our one table. She also helped us navigate the small size of this location by getting us a large table in the back.  The slight complication was really a blip on my radar once we got to the food. Some highlights of XOCO included the churros (try using the very very thick and not-too-sweet aztec hot chocolate as a dipping sauce) and the Cochinita Pibil, a torta made with a crusty bread and really tender pork that walks the fine line between a mouthwatering punch of flavor and destroying your taste buds well. Side note: Do not take the cashier's warning lightly. The habanero sauce that comes with this torta is indeed really spicy. Also, the guacamole and chips sound simple but don't be deceived. It's creamy and flavorful without being too salty. Highly recommended. I also had a chance to try the ahogada torta, which contained some really juicy carnitas but I didn't like that it was served already sitting in the tomato broth. There's no way you can eat the entire hefty sandwich before it gets way too soggy. Also, I'd recommend sticking with the tortas. I had a taste of the Pork Belly Vermicelli, which, while it had a very nicely done pork belly, was overwhelmed by the uber-limey broth. Also, I might be biased because I'm used to eating soup noodles with chopsticks but I found it really hard to eat this with a shallow spoon and fork. Didn't particularly enjoy this dish.

The Ahogado sandwiches in tomato broth are really good, probably the only thing I would come back for. Nice and crispy bread, tastes great when dipping in the tomato sauce. I would say it fills you up just right, not too full and not too hungry. We also had the churros and hot chocolate that everyone raves about. I honestly thought I was sipping a chocolate bar, it was so thick and sweet like melted chocolate cocoa. I'm usually in favor of the sweet stuff, but I feel hot chocolate shouldn't be THAT sweet. So I couldn't finish that drink. The churros were okay, nothing too special to me, but I'm no churro expert. I would recommend that you skip on getting any of the dipping sauces or special churro styles if you're getting the hot chocolate. You can literally dip the churro in the hot chocolate cuz its so thick, I'm pretty sure it's the SAME as the chocolate dipping shot.",0.9784,0.784,0.171,0.045,0.6195105820105821

A chef has to differentiate himself as it is by opening multiple locations or multiple restaurants by putting three things all in a row, you really gotta give each it's our character.

You still wait in a line to order your food but then get whisked off to your table where you can hang out before they bring your order to you. We stopped by for dessert only as one of the fun, flirty aspects of li'l sis is the hot chocolate and churros. The churros are more refined than the ones I'm used to from the streets of the Mission in San Francisco or those ohhh so delicious smelling carts at Disneyland and cater to a more grown up palate by offering an optional addition of a rich, dark, chocolate dipping shot. The Mexico City Thick hot chocolate was thick and delicious although not as stand out chocolate-y as the dipping shot. Is this Bayless' at his best? Of course not.

Chips and guac to start -- I don't know what they do, but the guacamole is some kind of amazing. Really smooth. Also came with two salsas. A nice snack, but probably not worth $6. Split the goat barbacoa and Ahogado sandwiches. The ahogado is nice -- pork carnitas, black beans, pickled onions. A little dry if you eat it alone, but that's why they serve it face down in tomato broth. It's a fun concept, but the sandwich itself is not amazing.  The goat barbacoa is only served on Saturdays, and is stunningly good. It's goat and avocado, which makes a lusciously soft and delicious filling for the sandwich.  Aztec hot chocolate is spiced wonderfully. The first half is not too thick, but if you let it cool it will be harder to drink.  The agua de jamaica is a red colored sweet and tangy drink, almost lemonade based. Nice and refreshing, and probably a better way to wash down a sandwich than the thick hot chocolate.  Also had the 3 churros with a chocolate shot. Really good.  Had the Margarita churro which had a lemon sauce drizzled on top and was coated with crushed almonds. Pretty good, but I'd try a different one next time, or stick to the plain churros. All in all, a great food, great place minus the wait.",0.9975,0.727,0.244,0.029,0.5859611992945327

I had an intensely delicious carne asada torta at frontera fresca and was hoping to have it again here, but unfortunately, not possible on a Saturday.  The Agua fresca de Jamaica is also really refreshing and unique. Perfect beverage to wash the sandwiches down with. The hot chocolate, on the other hand, was a little thick for my taste.  The churros were as good as I had remembered them. I actually really enjoyed them plain. The chocolate shot/syrup that can be purchased as a dipping sauce for the churros is really rich and delightful, but I think it overpowers the simple cinnamon sugar coating. The margarita churros was an interesting concept as well--it was a churro drizzled in an almost custardy lime syrup and sprinkled with chopped pine nuts(?).

Yes, it was a Friday night (6pm) and yes, it was a busy holiday weekend, but our party of 6 waited WELL over an hour for a table, after being told it would only be 30-35 min. We tried to be as patient as possible while the people sitting at the only table that could fit us sat and just chatted away after their meal, leftovers packed up, oblivious to the fact that seats are in very high demand here. Eat and go, people. We had serious foodies from out of town as part of the group, and this was their only chance to sample the Rick Bayless culinary fare after learning of a 2.5-3hr wait at Frontera. The lingering patrons weren't the restaurant's fault, but the gross inaccuracy of the wait time for us was. Had we known it would take that long to sit and dine, (we also had with us a 18 month old) we probably would have chosen another restaurant. But we stood there, while everyone else behind us in line sat and ate. We get it- small place. But the system they use (stand in line, wait for table, order, sit) was really confusing and frustrating. To try and compensate for the wait, the manager(?)  offered up some chips and guac as we waited. It would have been a nice touch, but the cashier, who handed them to us, then said, ""we'll just add this to your bill when you order"". Um, what? They did FINALLY talk to the lingering table and comp the $5 side order, but wow. But let's get to the food, shall we? Best guac I've ever had. Superfresh. Everyone else loved their meals, except for me. I ordered the Baja Chicken Torta, and for some reason, it just didn't grab me. I finished less than half of it. My dad almost died after ingesting too much of his super hot sauce, but he hadn't heard the server's warning. We ended the meal with churros, a Mexico City hot choc and some ice cream. Delish.

I also got two types of their churros. The pistachio flavored one, and their regular one with soft-serve on the side. I felt that, even though these churros were good, it wasn't anything amazing either. Churros you get at any other place are just as good. Wished there was more to it.

It was DEFINITELY worth the wait.  I ordered two sandiwiches which I shared with a friend (i recommend you do the same).  1) Ahogada with the spicy salsa. This took quite a while to be served. Its a pork sandwich served in a bowl of tomato soup. It was incredibly delicious. The soup matched the falvors in the sandwich so well. Not something I would typically order, but it was so good, I was left salivating for more, even though I was so full.  2) Carne Asada: I ate this half as I waited for the Ahogada. Again, this sandwcih was incredible. The flanksteak was surprisingly tender and the chimichirri was on point. Perfect blend of spices and seasoning.  3) Chips and Salsa. The chips came with two types of salsa. Not chunky, but super smooth, almost watery. I love it this way. The red was wayyyy better than the green imo. I ended up pouring the red salso on my sandwich and the staff gladly brought some more.  4_ Chicharrones; Can't really go wrong with fried pork skin/fat. However, I will say the sauce they serve on this was REALLY hot. I like heat, but this was almost too much heat.  5) Churros. If you are sticking around for dessert, get the plain churros. They are good, and well plain. I ordered two of the peanut butter with chocolate ones and felt ripped off. Basically tey drizzle a little chocolate syrup on top of the plain churros and some crush peanuts. Definitely not worth the money they charge for them. but again the plain ones were good.  6) someone else at our table ordered the ice cream. I LOVE ice cream, but didnt order it cause iwas so full and well, it was very expensive for such a small portion. However, ......THIS WAS SOME OF THE BEST ICE CREAM I'VE EVER TASTED.

We had planned on going to Frontera Grill, but there was a supposed 2 hours wait (for lunch).  Therefore, we decided to go to XOCO (small fact XOCO is slang for little sister). I Love Rick Bayless and his cooking shows. In my opinion, he is a master at his craft.  The line was short when we walked in, we were greeted and asked if it was to-go or we were eating there. We told the hostess we would be dining in, she then handed us a menu to look over while we were in line. The line moved pretty fast for us, the menu  had a lot of options to choose from:  Made to order Tortas Meals in a bowl (soups, stews) Salads Sides Snacks (not desserts, more like chips and salsa, Chicharrones ect) Dessert  Drinks (including Chocolate coffee, Bean-to-Cup Chocolate, and Agua Fresca) Ordered a Cubana: Smoked Gunthorp pork loin and bacon, black beans, avocado, artisan Jack, chipotle mustard, Morita chiles, cilantro crema. Guacamole & Chips: guacamole, just-made chips, 2 salsas Arroz con Leche Churros with Chocolate shot for dipping The Guacamole & Chips were amazing. I could not get enough of it! The Cubana was filling and delicious for a first timer trying it out. Just thinking about it right now is making me lust over it again. The mix of meat, bacon, spicy black beans, cheese, and avocado all melted together. (Insert drool) The bread was a little to crispy as it was hard not to cut the roof of my mouth open several times but no fear I just took the bread off and ate the insides, still yummy! By the time both Minh and myself were finished with our lunches we were only half-full, which is until our desserts arrived.  Now if any of you reading this knows, Arroz con Leche is a filling dessert all on its own! I would say I prefer this to the Churros; sadly, I was not too impressed with the taste of them. Maybe it was an off day in the kitchen but I found myself having to dunk them in chocolate just to get a proper taste!

My friend went a second time and said they weren't as good (cold and not very tasty), and I actually heard the same from a third party. Most people seem to think the churros are awesome though, so maybe my friends were out of luck. A couple of my lady-friends also got the hot chocolate (authentic and classic) and found it too rich to drink. Tasty, but it just made them thirstier.  The food was honestly some of the best I've had for a while. I'm taking off a star because the hostess was truly unpleasant.

In addition, as we left the restaurant, instead of a ""Thank you for dining with us!"" or a ""Have a nice night,"" she gave us a really nasty stink eye and brushed past us.

The interior was small, and the fast food protocol started from a narrow walkway that led to the register before we arrived at tiny corridors with limited counter seating. We ordered the Ahogada ($10), Barbacoa Torta ($12), and a glass of Jamaica ($2.50). The Ahogada was put together with pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, arbol chile sauce, and pickled onions. I thought the pork had decent flavor, but the textures were uneven between moist and dry spots. I really enjoyed the tomato broth that went well to soften the torta. I liked the broth as it made a big different in this sandwich, but the price was too high for me to order it again. The Barbacoa Torta was made with braised goat, Oaxacan pasilla-tomatillo salsa, avocado, onions, and cilantro.  There were some sharp tasting flavors here and there, primarily due to the salsa to add to the smothering of smoky chipotle sauce to render a tenacious kick. The seasoning of the barbacoa could be much better, but the secondary ingredients provided the flavors when it was desperately needed.  Service was quick and friendly. I thought there was some creativity and finesse in parts of the meal. However, the primary reasons for the low rating was due to 1) the high prices for tortas that usually cost around $5 in many places, and 2) the bread that was not crisp but rather doughy, hard, and very difficult to chew.  I give the chef credit, but it is difficult to refine a street food that could be discovered cheaper and better on the streets of Los Angeles.

Drinks and desserts are good too. Mostly the churros and the agua frescas! I'm not a very big fan of their chocolate (another blasphemous stance I'm sure), but I find their chocolate to be too gourmet to feel authentic. Their champurrado certainly doesn't taste like any other champurrado I've ever had. It's almost too thick, too rich.

A flavorful green stew containing fresh ingredients creating a taste that's full of body, yet delicate at the same time...It's really hard to describe the taste exactly, but if you have the chance to visit XOCo, you should give it a try.  We ended our meal on an even happier note with churros and vanilla ice cream. :)",0.9829,0.763,0.224,0.014,0.51005772005772

A hostess will ask you if you're eating in or taking it to go. If eating in, you order then they seat you accordingly. We walked in right after a rain storm and it was pretty empty. But I can see how this place can be hectic during busy hours. -Pork Belly Vermicelli (Fideos): Crispy-tender pork belly, toasty-tender noodles, woodland mushrooms, zucchini, avocado, salsa negra. It was hot and humid outside so I had to sweat out this meal but it was sure worth it. I describe it as Mexican Pho. The broth was savory, thick, and just plain well balanced. The pork belly was tender and delicious. All the veggies flawless. I crave this dish at times. -Iced Chocolate: A glass of cold frothy iced chocolate. Very sweet and chocolatey. Can't describe it much more than that. I enjoyed it. -Horchata: The horchata here was not too sweet and very smooth. No grainy texture here. Refreshing. -Desserts (Churros & Rice Pudding): I was far too full to enjoy dessert and we had to throw it out. :(  The rice pudding was great though!

2012-08-31,2.0,"I LOVE giving compliments, and I'll stop to write a positive review before I'll offer feedback that is less than positive.  So, I will start with a compliment.  Mr. Bayless, nice work!  Your little empire over there at Clark and Illinois is nothing short of genius.  I am a HUGE supporter of the the local, sustainable and organic movement in Chicago, and you are one of the leaders in this town and globally.  Thank You!  I like your little restaurant XOCO, but I had a bad experience there today.  Let me explain... I arrived around the lunch hour, chaotically busy as one might expect.  Long line, workers rushing about.  No problem.  To the first person I made eye contact with, whom I'm guessing is the ""hostess"" du jour, I said very cheerfully, I would like to sit outside.  She shoved a menu in my face and said pick what you want, tell us your order, then we'll show you to a seat outside.  Not terribly friendly, a hello would have been nice.  So I look at the menu and as she walks by again, I asked...""I'm a little overwhelmed by the menu, is there just a lunch special?""  She says, in a big hurry, ""we have sandwiches and soups"".  I said, ""I thought you had tacos here, no?""  She says very curtly, ""WE HAVE SANDWICHES AND SOUPS"" (with a tone suggesting didn't you hear me the first time you idiot?)  Ok then Miss Sassypants hostess lady.  When I finally picked something to eat, I went to tell Sassypants, and I said, ""I know what I want now.""  She shouted at me, as she looked at me with fire in her eyes and smoke coming out of her ears, ""I DON'T TAKE ORDERS!!!""  Ok, Sassy McSassers, then who does, because that's what you told me to do when you shoved the menu in my face.  I went to a young lady who was working the cashier and said, ""I've never been here before, and I guess I don't know how this works, can you help me?""  She said ""sure, just tell me what you want to order then we'll show you to a seat outside"".  Thanks, cashier gal, that was straight forward, friendly, sans attitude.  I had ordered a Limonada drink so the cashier said ""wait here while I get your drink, then we'll seat you"".  OK, sounds good.   She brings me the drink, I go outside and sit down to wait for my food.  I look into my glass before taking a sip, and notice a hair in my drink, right on top, stuck to the piece of ice.  Now, I know these things happen from time to time, but it was just another negative in my already disappointing customer service experience.  So I go back in and happen to run into Sassy, and she says, ""I'll seat you now"".  And, I'm like ""I've already been seated, I came back in because (I increased my volume here for Sassy's benefit) I HAVE A HAIR IN MY DRINK"".  She grabs the glass from me and said ""We'll bring you another one"".  No sorry or anything.  Then some new, nice young gal delivered the new drink, hair-free, and this time with a lime wedge on the glass.  I liked this one much better.  For consistency, if the Limonada is supposed to be served with a lime wedge, then ALWAYS serve it with a lime wedge, get it right. So a while later, I received my sandwich, since that is what they have there, SANDWICHES AND SOUPS, and don't you forget it!  The Milanesa it was called, a decent SANDWICH, and my fresh Limonada went down.  I liked it fine, not out of this world, but I would go back and maybe try some SOUP next time.   A final word for you Sassarita.  I know we all have a bad day sometimes, or PMS, or whatever, but your attitude towards me, A FIRST TIME CUSTOMER,  was outrageously uncalled for, and just rude.  You ""don't take orders"" eh?  Well I've got an order for you.  In my best Donald Trump impression, but coming out of the mouth of Rick Bayless, ""YOU'RE FIRED""!!!  I only wish I were there in person when it happens.  And don't forget, when you're not nice to someone, there is twitter and facebook and Yelp to make sure you're called out for bad behavior...Oh my gosh, Santa really is watching.   I'll only go back, because Bayless'  reputation precedes him.  Otherwise, F- on customer service.",0.9954,0.782,0.15,0.068,0.4923208923208923

I routinely crave several items on the XOCO menu, including one seasonal spring special that I fear they will never have again. It was the Ham L.T. with some type of prosciutto, a delicious cheese, roasted tomatoes, and some type of greens. My other favorite is the Woodland Mushroom torta, with goat cheese, black beans, arugula, and 3-chile salsa. Absolutely melt-in-my-mouth amazing. I could eat it every day. That with some of their fresh guacamole and homemade salsas with tortilla chips, and I am in my happy place.

The grilled shrimp torta was very good.  It came with a black bean type of a paste that had a very unique flavor.  It was a good compliment to the more spicy ahogado.  We also had an appetizer that was a sort of avocado sauce with scallops and shrimp: amazing.

2012-08-04,3.0,"I love rewarding awesome restaurants with star-studded Yelp reviews. Sadly, every now and then, a place does too well for itself for the experience to work for me; the combination of unrealistically high expectations and throngs of humanity rushing the door gives me a (perhaps unfairly) high threshold for maximally enjoying a restaurant. In my estimation, XOCO falls in this category.  I'll start with the good news (which, as you can see in the overwhelming majority of the 1400+ reviews here, isn't exactly news): the food at XOCO is excellent. I started with a Hibiscus water ($2.50) - a refreshing balance of sweetness and exotic tang, perfect for this 90 degree day. Poc Chuc torta ($12) is filled with Yucatan-style roast pork, tomatoes, avocado, and a hellaciously spicy habañero salsa, all on a perfectly crisp, fresh sandwich roll. This was a very well-thought out and delicious sandwich. Churro ($1.60 each, or 3 for $4) is fried to perfection, not cloyingly sweet, and steamily tender on the inside - I probably goofed up not getting a side of chocolate to dip this in ($1.25), but you can't win 'em all.  Unfortunately, the various hoops one has to jump through to actually eat at XOCO make it almost an unattractive option for repeat dining. I came at 1:45 in the afternoon, and the line was still out the door (and slow-moving, to boot). I wound up ordering to go and (illicitly) enjoying my sandwich at the Starbucks on Clark because the line got far too long. In addition to the wait, the pricing is quite high; while the food is of highest quality, I still have a hard time getting jazzed up about paying 50+% more than I would pay for a truly excellent sandwich (JP Graziano, maxing out at $8.25) or churro (Don Churro, $1) elsewhere in this city. While neither the line nor the price was so exorbitant that I couldn't enjoy the experience, the food wasn't spectacular enough to make me forget these unpleasant elements entirely (as happens instantly upon biting into a Great Lake Pizza or a Kuma's hamburger, for instance). I love legendary grub as much as the next guy, and am generally willing to go to the ends of the Earth to get it, but even I have a line, which XOCO nearly crosses. All in all, I'd recommend XOCO with caution. I'll definitely be back to try that Ahogada, or one of the Posoles, or for breakfast, but I'll almost certainly wait for oddball weekdays off when I can go at odd times, or rainy days when others don't feel like leaving their houses. Otherwise, I'm not sure that XOCO is worth it.",0.9836,0.79,0.135,0.075,0.6353126012309687

I cannot speak for the caldos, which I have been told are extremely filling (I'm not really a soup guy). Chipotle Chicken: delicious. Extremely flavorful and the tomato sauce that is used is the perfect complement. Portion of meat is quite small though. Choriqueso: fantastic as well, but not nearly enough meat...could eat two in one sitting. Milanesa: breaded chicken--really damn good, and probably the best value for your $ as far as portion size goes. Pepito: shortribs...yet another torta that does not disappoint. Would definitely get this one again. Cochinita Pibil: suckling roasted pig. Tasty but there's not enough flavor when you compare it to the others. Goat Barbacoa (Saturday special): Downright incredible, and I don't even really care for goat. This sandwich is simply poppin with flavor. Churros: yummmmmmm. Not a bad deal at 3 for $4.

2012-07-20,4.0,"I was in Chicago in early July 2012 and during my visit I had a list of restaurants that I wanted to visit. I became a huge fan of Rick Bayless after seeing him compete on Top Chef Masters and I knew that he had several restaurants in Chicago.  Rick Bayless is known in the culinary world as an expert of Mexican cuisine and having lived in Mexico city for some time and being a lover of Mexican food, I decided to visit one of his restaurants in Chicago. After reviewing his restaurants, I selected XOCO mainly because of the great reviews it has received, and also because it is one of his most budget friendly restaurants. Remember that I did say that I had made a ""list"" of restaurants that I wanted to visit. When I walked in to the restaurant there was a hostess that gave me a number. I did not know what the number was for, but she told me to give it to the person at the cash register.  After I paid for my meal and walked over to sit down, another staff member asked me for the number I was given and showed me to my seat. Ahhh so the number was the number of my seat. It was 9am after all and my brain had yet to cease sleeping. I started off by ordering ""The Authentic"" which was an authentic Mexican hot chocolate.  It tasted a little bitter and it was very thick. It almost had a bit of an oily texture to it. I certainly think it is an acquired taste. After a couple of sips I got used to it. Though I probably would not order it again. The water they offered was not flat, which was a disappointment to me because I do not like fizzy water. When I get a bad stomach ache I take Alka-Seltzer and this is what the water reminded me of.  I am sure I could have asked for a flat water, but I took what was being offered because I wanted the ""full experience."" I love churros, so I knew that I had to get a churro at XOCO. I had high hopes that I would receive a hot churro because to me there is nothing worse than a cold pastry. When it was brought to my seat I received it nice and hot and straight out of the frier. The chocolate sauce felt redundant after the hot chocolate, though this sauce did taste like dark chocolate without the oily-like texture. So, I am not a fan of onions and I understood that ordering at XOCO would be challenging because the majority of Mexican dishes use onions. So after reviewing the menu I asked if I could have the Huevos Rancheros with the sauce on the side. They said that this would be possible, but that there was no point since the dish would not taste good without the sauce. Huh? Are you kidding with me? How can it not taste good without the sauce? I am Hispanic and I have been eating tortillas with eggs, beans and cheese most of my life WITHOUT a sauce! So they suggested the French Toast instead. NO! I said. I know what I want and put the sauce on the side. With a sigh they put in the order. So this is what I received. It looks damn delicious to me! I took a moment to taste the sauce and the onions were chopped quite finely that I could not even taste them. Perfect!  So I proceeded to pour the sauce over the tortillas, cheese, eggs and beans. I did enjoy my time at XOCO and found the food to be quite tasty. But for some reason I remember feeling a little disappointed when I finished my meal. I am not sure if it was the small portion (I like a big breakfast), or having to negotiate how I wanted my meal. Whatever it was, I am not sure I will return for their breakfast the next time I visit Chicago, but I would return to check out their lunch menu.",0.9659,0.83,0.107,0.063,0.5251724386724387

So when I landed at ORD last Saturday, I went straight to Xoco to grab a bite. When I walked in, it was hot inside and a little confusing. Then a hostess came to explain how things work. So basically you line up, order your food and the hostess gives you a number for your counter space/table. Then you are all confused when look for your table because she never places a number on your table. HOWEVER, the fact that I was sweating and all confused did not affect my opinions for the food served here! Xoco has the best horchata I have ever had! Far better than the ones I got in LA. Respect. So awesome that I had to order two. It had the rich rice flavor I always look for in a horchata, not purely sweet. I also had the special of the day which was the goat barbacoa. It was delicious! The intense flavor of goat burst into my mouth with every bite! My mouth waters even I am just thinking about it. Then I finished my late lunch with churros. The churros were made to order so it was hot and crispy when came out. They were less cinnamon-y but they came with chocolate. The combo with the high quality of chocolate was really paired well together. I would also like to try the tres leche cake, but I was really stuffed beyond imagination so I had to refrain myself.  Frontera Grill was next door. It was nice to see Rick didn't neglect his little joint here. He came by running around and making sure everything was right. Nicely done, chef.

Moreover, I have no problem waiting for a meal, if it is delicious, and XOCO certainly delivered. My girlfriend and I each ordered a torta and shared half so we could try more of the menu on our first visit. I ordered the Cochinita Pibil, which was a beautiful medley of pork, pickled onion, and habenero salsa (served on the side). My torta was absolutely delicious and definitely brought the heat. Midway through my half, I immediately began to regret splitting it with my gf who ordered the Pepito. While the Pepito was good, it did not have the same depth of flavor that the Cochinita had. Furthermore, as one who LOVES spice, the Pepito was lacking in heat.  My only gripe with XOCO was the bread. I'm not sure if it is the traditional bread used for tortas, but it cut open the roof of my mouth pretty bad.

Eggs and salsa really make the dish delicious, and the corn tortilla with black bean paste Churros: (4.5/5). Well done. I don't particular like donuts, but this was relatively non-greasy, crispy, and coated in delicious chocolate flecked sugar. Technically, excellent. Chocolate drinks are fantastic at XOCO - in fact they give the restaurant its name! They grind their cacao nibs fresh. These are some of the best chocolate drinks I've ever had. Authentic (4.75/5): ""Fresh-ground Chocolate + Water"" Aztec (5/5): ""fresh-ground chocolate + water + chile + allspice"" A spicy sour-tinge in this chocolate gives it a kick above the normal authentic Iced Chocolate with Bayless Garden Mint (5/5). As perfect a mint chocolate as I've ever had. Cacao nibs mixed with actual mint leaves. Rich, and delicious. ******** Lunch/Dinner rickbayless.com/menus/xo… Chipotle Chicken Torta (4/5): Gunthorp chicken, chipotle-roasted tomato sauce, artisan Jack cheese, avocado, black beans, arugula. A good chicken sandwich, if a bit spicy. Pork Belly Torta (3.5/5): Dark salsa negra glaze, bacon, arugula, queso anejo. A bit too sparing on the pork, you can taste more of the bacon strips in this one. Chicharrones (5/5): Chicharrones, Tamazula hot sauce, queso añejo, onions, cilantro. Chicarrones is pig skin, seasoned and deep fried. The chicarrones here is fluffy. In Singapore, if we don't roast our pig skin to a crisp (roasted fatty pork, pork knuckle or suckling pig), we usually eat it wet with yong tau foo. This is one of the few time's I've eaten crispy yet fluffy pig skin. Ahogada Torta (4.25/5): ""Golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, pickled onions."" Make a crispy sandwich pork. Promptly dump it in a spicy chili-tomato soup. You get a delicious mess that is hard to eat. I was surprised the sandwich didn't fall apart in my hands. Special mention must be made of the salsa, which is also made on Rick Bayless's rooftop. A rooftop in Chicago, apparently. Now, rooftop gardens are all the rage. Gracie's in Providence once carted a lot of soil up Peerless Lofts to make fresh herbs. ******** Verdict: Frontera's sandwich cousin.

For the food, I ordered chips and salsa with guacamole, one of the caldos, churros and a beer.  The chips and salsa are perfectly fine but come with an incredibly skimpy quantity of guacamole.  I had no idea what a caldos was and was surprised when it was delivered but ate it with an open mind and enjoyed it immensely.  Think of the caldos as mexican pho. The caldos are intensely flavored and have a perfect balance of flavors.   The churros were good as well but perhaps too doughy. My main issue with this restaurant is the bizzare method of ordering food and being seated.  You are assigned a table but order at a register.  When I entered the restaurant I walked to the register to order and was asked for my table number.  I did not have one since I had not sat down.  I was told to see a hostess.  The hostess told me all seats were taken and instructed me to stand at the front of the line (at the register) and wait for her to come give me a table number.  So, I waited for 5 or so minutes like a dope in an empty line looking at a person waiting to take my order at the register.  When assigned a table number, I ordered and was shown to my seat and food runners brought my food to me.  Very awkward and over thought for a restaurant that is somewhere between chipotle and casual full service  mexican.   So, 5 stars for food, minus one for the stupid ordering/seating arrangement and minus one more star because the basic meal I ate cost $37 with a small gratuity, which is way too much to pay for the atmosphere, quantity of food and lack of table service.",0.9642,0.838,0.112,0.05,0.552457264957265

2012-06-21,5.0,"Thanks to some awesome local Yelpers (and of course Rick Bayless), we made sure not to leave Chicago without eating at XOCO. By the way can anybody tell me how to pronounce this?! Anyways, when I was told of the concept, I wasn't sure what to expect...some greasy Mexican food made by a famous chef?!  NO!!!  We arrived at the restaurant and waited a good 30 or 45 minutes due to the size of our party of 5. Who cares- good food is worth waiting for! When it was finally our time to order, my friend and I decided to split the chicken torta- with the beans on the side, due to my fear of beans- and a side salad. We also couldn't pass up the churros and put an order in for 3. We filled our glasses with water (your choice of tap or sparkling with slices of lime- classy!) and were seated our our table. After a short time, our food arrived at our table. We were all surprised that the ""tortas"" we ordered were actually sandwiches. Totally unexpected, but what a great surprise this turned out to be! The bread was crusty on the outside and slightly scooped out on the inside to allow for the scrumptious filling of freshly cooked chicken, avocado, cheese, and arugula. The chicken was marinated in some sort of spice mixture which I couldn't figure out, but it was quite yummy. Upon biting into my ""torta"", I was in love. This may have been one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. Everything tasted so fresh and all of the ingredients just worked together. Not only that, but my friend somehow convinced me to taste the beans (which NEVER happens- EVER), and I actually liked them...enough to put them on my sandwich, as they were meant to be; Rick Bayless really does know what he's doing! The salad, which consisted of chopped romaine, arugula, jicama, and cucumbers lightly tossed in an avocado lime dressing was a great compliment to the sandwich and very refreshing on such a hot day. There was quite a bit of jicama and cucumber in the salad, which added a nice crunch, and the dressing was really good- I need to figure out how to recreate this! I also tried a bite of the chorizo sausage torta which had some unique flavors. It was good and a bit spicier than our chicken. The seafood meal-in-a-bowl-caldo was also yummy! The soup had the perfect amount of spice without being overbearing, in what looked like a tomato broth, and it was chock full of veggies and a variety of seafood. When we finished our meals, we let them know we were ready for our churros. 3 churros and a side of very dark melted chocolate showed up at our table minutes later. We quickly devoured them and didn't leave one drop of chocolate behind (we were licking our fingers- and the cup, I'm not going to lie). The chocolate had a unique taste that nobody could figure out, but it was soooo good.

I was looking forward to trying the guac and chips, but was disappointed by the relative blandness of the guacamole.  Thankfully, the side bowls of green tomatillo sauce and red salsa helped spice it up.  I prefer my guac with more garlic and cilantro.  The Oaxacan-style roasted peanuts with garlic, chili, salt and lime were highly-addictive and went very well with the beer while we waited on the tortas. The main offerings here are several types of tortas, wood-oven grilled sandwiches.  I had the pepito which featured braised short ribs, caramelized onions, melted jack cheese, black beans and pickled jalapenos.  I thought the bread was like a whole grain version of a po'boy bread, with a crunchy crust and a soft interior crumb that soaked up the juices from the meat.  Served with a tangy tomatillo dipping sauce, this sandwich really hit the spot.  Hubby ordered their Friday night special torta with smoky grilled shrimp and goat cheese ... he said the shrimp was perfectly cooked. My only regret is that we didn't save room for the Mexican Vanilla soft-serve ice cream served with a bacon/pecan/salted caramel sauce topping.  If only our hotel room had a freezer, I would've brought an order back for later.   If XOCO is a Chicago version of Mexican street food, then I need to get to Mexico!",0.9441,0.88,0.085,0.035,0.43494397759103653

2012-06-14,5.0,"I was a woman obsessed with Rick Bayless. I could not get enough.  Because I only had an hour for lunch, I chose to eat at XOCO, which was around the corner from Frontera Grill. The first day (yes, I went back the following day and I would have gone back again after that except XOCO is closed on Sundays), I had: CHIPOTLE CHICKEN TORTA: Gunthorp chicken, chipotle-roasted tomato sauce, artisan Jack cheese, avocado, black beans, arugula.  CHURRO and CHOCOLATE CAFE CON LECHE. The torta (Mexican sandwich, think panini) was absolutely delicious. I love the crispy crunchy bread sandwiching the warm tender juicy meat, accented by the flavorful cheese and arugula. The sandwich comes with salsa in case you like it spicy, I liberally dipped my torta in it, but honestly it didn't need it because it was so flavorful on its own. XOCO has great service, You can request that the chocolate drinks and churro come after your meal. So after I finished my sandwich I got my churro and chocolate con leche. The churro is very light and refined, not at all doughy. Having grown up in Southern California, churros were a part of my childhood. Admittedly this childhood delight evokes nostalgia in me and though I cognitively know Bayless's churro is better, I still prefer the thick doughy version. The chocolate cafe con leche is a perfect drink if you like non-sweet chocolate drinks. I would have preferred a slightly sweeter and creamier drink, so I think next time I will select a different drink. The next day, I had: TORTA with BRAISED SHORT RIB (I don't know what its name is and it's not listed in the menu on the website. CHOCOLATE and HAZELNUT COOKIE  and HORCHATA. The cashier nodded her head in approval and said, ""Great choice for lunch"" as she rang me up. And no, she does not say this to everyone. I have a weakness for short ribs and this was no exception.

Every ingredient was fresh (Crispy Gunthorp chicken, black beans, cheese, pickled jalapenos) and blended beautifully together. The tomatillo-avocado salsa should be bottled up and sold; however, because they prepare it fresh daily, it isn't...and that sucks because it is so, so tasty! The music is quite loud and seating is cramped and limited, so if you don't like semi-loud and small seating areas, you may want to opt for take out (or dine outside if the weather is nice). Note about the churros: I have had authentic churros in Spain, so I was hoping for something similar to what I know, and not those pre-filled ones you get from places such as street fairs. The churros are very good and piping hot, crunchy (but not too hard) with the right amount of sweetness.

Maybe they can't help all the hard surfaces, but it is certainly within their power to turn down the volume of the music.   Weird setup where the hostess tells you what number your table will be and then the cashier asks for your table number when you order.  I had no idea I would need to remember the table number, so the cashier had to ask the hostess what it was.   A simple, ""Tell the cashier you are at table 16"" by the hostess would have been nice.",0.6335,0.849,0.087,0.064,0.5261022927689595

My favorites:  -Carne Asada: flank steak, green garlic chimichurri, mushrooms, crema; seasonal. -Ahogada: pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, pickled onions; available daily. -Pork Belly: dark salsa negra glaze, bacon, arugula, queso anejo; available Wednesdays. The flavor combinations are thoughtful, and you can tell the sandwiches are put together with care. The tortas don't rely on copious amounts of oil, butter, or cheese to taste good. The bread is remarkable, crisp outside but yielding within. The ratio of bread to filling is good; almost all bites but maybe the last will have some of the tasty filling. The salsa that's served alongside is also great; the sandwiches are strong enough to stand alone, but a little salsa never hurt anything. I'm pretty sure no one can argue that Rick Bayless knows what he's doing when it comes to sandwiches. Take advantage of the complimentary sparkling water with lime. Prices range from $9.00-$12.75 per sandwich, but I feel that the flavor and quality justify the price. The sandwiches are filling but not monstrous. When I don't mind spending a little more, I really love coming to Xoco for lunch. Although I've heard the waits can be long during peak meal hours, I usually arrive between 2pm and 3pm and am able to order and sit right away.

Not only that, they got this awesome system going on with shuffling customers in and out without clogging up the lines. That doesn't stop the line from building up though. This is based solely off of whatever sandwiches I had. Anyway, I got the carne asada sandwich which was a little on the expensive side for what you get. I also ordered the chorizo sandwich for the girlfriend. Now, if you take a step back and look at exactly what you ordered, what you got, and how much you paid...it doesn't quite add up. It's literally just a sandwich with sauce to dip. *dont get me wrong, its still good* Then, when you eat it, you'll notice that the bread is awesome; a lovely crust with a soft inside. The contents are full of flavor but just isn't satisfying. I'm not sure if its this notion that I have with sandwiches - they better be full of ingredients. Then you take a look at your sauce...which may be more on the creative side due to the fact that you're pairing the two. But thats all it is... But do try the churros!! I wish I could do 3.5 stars.

My chicken was over doused in the sauce resulting in a soggy mess. The flavors were good but nothing that made me compelled to want to eat more.

Pepito - Another delicious offering from the torta menu.  The meat was so tender, and the flavors meshed well together.  The onions and the jalapenos round out the sandwich nicely.    Choriqueso - This was my least favorite of the bunch.  It lacked the balance of flavor the other two tortas had.  The chorizo simply dominated the torta.

I want my food now without feeling fancy and I want it with churros without waiting in line for two hours. XOCO is pretty much a fast food cafe with alcohol and adopts the same seating policy as Hot Doug's: you can sit down when there is space for you. Luckily the turnover here is fast as well as the service. WIN WIN WIN. We were first in line and were dawdling for about 20 minutes. The staff was really nice and apologetic. Believe me, compared to waiting two hours next door, the wait at XOCO is nothing. Plus they let you drink while you are in line indoors.  We only got snacks since we were planning to eat next door at Frontera. We got the Cochinita Pibil, chicharrones, guacamole, and churros with Mexico City Thick hot chocolate and dulce de leche. Amazing! I think I could have been content with XOCO and had called it a day. Definitely stopping in at XOCO is a meal. We had to stop ourselves not to load up too much. The sandwich was awesome. The lechon was juicy and had pieces of skin with it. It had a spicy sauce on the side which was hot on fire spicy. It's nice that we could go up to the water fountain at any time to refill our glasses. The guacamole was to be expected. I actually preferred it more on the chicharron than the chips. The churros? OMG. BEST THING EVER! Churros at La Churreria in NYC are a sad pale comparison. Yes, different styles from different countries but XOCOs are so much better. They are dusted with cinnamon and sugar, delicious alone and heightened to heaven dipped in the chocolate. Also, the chocolate was nice enough that it could be drunk as is. I finished every last drop of it. Frontera Grill, if you are wondering why your customers arrive with a smile on their face when you finally call their name, it's because they've come from next door.

Throughout the 25+ elapsed minutes of ordering by the counter & being efficiently led & seated onto this narrowed booth--allowing about 1/4 of 40 maxed-out gastronomists dining in--instead of entering the traditional table & chair zone, we chose the Ahogada ($10) and Saturday Special's Goat Barbacoa ($12).  Getting the drink descriptions out of the way already, our Jamaica/Hibiscus ($2.50) was nectarous (though a bit over my threshold of sweetness), tart, & had quite of a deep viscosity without being medicine-like syrupy.  My Single Shot Mexican Chocolate Espresso ($2.50 for small), however, was more on the average-Joe level, although I appreciated the counter dude's suggestion to have this rich, hot drink brought in right after our abovementioned tortas. The sad news, unfortunately, is about those tortas.  From literally paying the prices the supporting ingredients, such as avocado, in the Goat Barbacoa shone brightly; the braised goat, however, surprisingly had some parts dry.  Meanwhile, the Ahogada was the weaker sandwich.  Served only dine-in I did find its tomato ""soup"" quite sweetly addicting, but even w/ the broth, the pickled onions & chile together the flavor of the golden meat, i.e. carnitas, seemed to be hiding from me--was it missing a critical spice?  One of my favorite foods, black beans, scarcely helped the flavor status that I had to liberally pour the awesomely smoky & spicy Chipotle salsa that was intentional for the Barbacoa. What's worse was that I was awfully disappointed and not amused when we had a tough time biting off this bread from BOTH of the tortas, as if they're beef jerky's shamefully tasteless alter ego.  We were suspicious if the ""pan"" were dreadfully stale from the day of =(!  For paying about $30 total I left off feelin' pretty cheerless w/ my middling Espresso, and tried to temporarily forget about it while we gallivanted Chi-town. So Mr. Bayless, I may not know exactly what happened in that fateful late Saturday morning, but the happy news is that I am willing to not only revisit especially for your illustrious Churros, but to update this personally distressing but honest review of one of your renowned, auspicious restaurants.

2012-03-23,2.0,"Sorry Rick Bayless... Not impressed. I was dying to try this place after several foodie/non-foodie friends recommended it, and with the Rick Bayless name behind it there was no question that I had to go. I've been a Rick Bayless fan since I was a kid watching One Plate at a Time on Channel 11 so I was really looking forward to this visit.  To my dismay, the experience and food quality was just NOT up to par.  After working at one of the city's River North hot spots, I understand what it is like trying to seat your tables with what is open so I was not surprised about the 20 minute wait for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. As we were waiting for our table, the host kept asking us to move down closer to the register which made it really awkward for those that were ordering to go with us breathing down their necks behind them. Once we were finally told to order, we went to the assigned table number to find that we were sharing the table with a couple who was already in the middle of their meal. This is something that normally wouldn't bother me (again from formerly hostessing at a restaurant using the same seating practice), but the fact that there was an empty table for 4 right next to us which never got sat throughout our meal is disappointing.  To start we ordered chips and guac. It was overall pretty tasty, but there was a little too much lime to my taste.  Then our tortas come out, we ordered the chicken, short rib and chorizo: Presentation - not appealing. For the price of this sandwich, I expected better presentation instead of it cut in half sitting in a basket over a piece of parchment paper. And for functionality it was difficult to eat from, plain and simple.  Taste - pretty bland, and not the best quality which is what set me off! At a place with this kind of prestige I expected good cuts of meat, yet the chicken was very fatty and chewy (made me want to gag, chicken fat is not the good kind...) Besides the fat it just wasn't very flavorful... we didn't even touch the other half of this torta. My short rib was really tough and dry, and the chorizo was a little too greasy. With the short rib there was pickled jalepeno on it, so I was expecting a little heat and spicyness but there wasn't any of that. Disappointing yet again. Bread could have been good. For how chewy it was the toasted top part got too hard as it cooled and scratched our mouths a little more than preferred when eating this type of bread.  For all the hype I had high expectations. I understand that Xoco is trying to bring Mexican fare alive in a new way, but for the prices you pay you can do much better than Xoco with the quality of food presented to you and experience. The only positive thing I can say is that I was full after this meal. Not impressed.",0.9618,0.824,0.104,0.072,0.5410064412238325

Better than Banh Mi (and I'm vietnamese!), better than Bay Cities' Godmother, just better. By far. The bread is crusty but doesn't hurt, the meat was so tender and smoky, and the sauce was addictive. The carnitas soup was the best soup I've had. Better than pho? Well, it's different, but I'd say yes. It was innovative.

I had to take the other half home. Service is super nice and accommodating. If you are unsure with the menu they are there to explain anything. Ordered jamica too for drinks. It was refreshing and wasn't too sweet. Perfect for a hot summer day.  We went here close to closing time on a Saturday night. Still the place was packed. One of the annoying things of place is parking is difficult. There's valet which is totally a life-saver had I known after driving around for 30 minutes. The place is kinda small so I can imagine the lines to sit gets pretty long. Can't make reservations so be prepared to wait.

Crispy, but not crack-the-roof-of-my-mouth crispy. Good bread is crucial in sandwiches and burgers. I liked the Ahogada torta the best of the three - it had the best combination of flavors. The Choriqueso was good, but not quite at the Ahogada level. And my sandwich was the most disappointing. When I read the description of ""wood-roasted suckling pig,"" I envisioned the suckling pig I had in Peru last year (lechon). Unfortunately, this did not come with the crispy skin that I now associate suckling pig with. Therefore, my heart and stomach just did not feel satisfied. I simply did not taste anything exciting from the sandwich. Side note: I must warn you that the accompanying hot sauce is hecka spicy, so be careful. The Pork belly vermicelli was quite tasty. Maybe a bit too watered-down, but the soup hit the spot as it was pretty dang cold outside. And the pork belly in it was excellent. Finally, the churros. I had these churros during my visit prior to this last one, and I wasn't impressed at the time. I don't know if anything changed over the course of the year (probably not), but I really, really enjoyed them this time.

But Xoco is nothing special. We had a goat torta: the meat was not particularly distinctive, it could have been anything. Goat at birrerias is much better. The separately served sauce was good, and necessary to give the sandwich any character. The caldo was perfectly flavored but was mostly water with some meat scraps; true, this is how it is in Mexican market stalls as well, but there it doesn't cost $12 (or rather it does, given that in Mexico $ means pesos). The almond hot chocolate was strangely sour and left an aftertaste. The churros were fresh and authentic, which means we're now a step closer to diabetes.

I went with a chicken torta for Erica and the Saturday special of braised goat. For a number of reasons my second visit was not as memorable or tasty as my first. Getting the full experience of ordering and getting a seat and sharing some chips and guacamole is probably better than eating a sandwich out of a box in the car. Also, the tortas from XOCO are the same as all of the other Frontera outposts - the airport and now Chase Plaza in the loop - that the novelty has worn off. My goat was quite tasty though and if you add a little of the hot sauce it all comes together well. Erica's chicken was not very good though and appeared to have all the dark meat scraps instead of nice chicken pieces. Finally, it's hard to get too excited about paying $25 for two sandwiches, even if you ate in the restaurant. I still like and recommend XOCO as a fun and different spot to get tasty mexican.

So when I order a torta sans one ingredient (which I asked if they would even do, or if I should order something else) I expect it not to be on my torta at all. When it came out, the woman even confirmed- it was sans item. However, upon looking at my torta it appears that it had been pre-made and then the item had been scrapped off. Which isn't the same to me as not being on there, especially when said item was beans. So don't expect them to be fresh or made-to-order at all.

It was a short visit, so this will be a short review.  We just wanted a little taste of XOCO as long as we were on the Rick Bayless block, having checked out and checked off the more expensive restaurants.  We shared a single churro with sides of hot chocolate sauce and Mexican vanilla soft serve.  The churro came a la carte and the sides were probably more expensive than they should have been.  No matter.  That was an awesome churro. It looked kind of pale, but one bite revealed it was fried to golden perfection, with a crunchy crust leading into chewy dough insides.  Not too sugary, but definitely sweet, it went well with the dark hot chocolate sauce, which was decidedly unsweetened.  This was lush, rich chocolate, with a slow viscosity and a thick, smooth texture.  If I were hungrier, I would have eaten it with a spoon.  The Mexican vanilla soft serve was also great, though less suited to the churros.  It had a nice creamy texture and a pure vanilla bean flavor that made it more interesting than your proverbial vanilla. Next time I'm in Chicago, I will come back to try the tortas and caldos, which looked so wickedly tempting even to our food-clogged eyes.  I gave a lot of money to Sr. Bayless on this trip, but XOCO's churro was one of the best things he fed me, at the most affordable price.",0.9888,0.807,0.152,0.041,0.4548934837092732

The only thing about this place that was kind of confusing that I didn't really think was necessary was the way in which they take orders and do seating.  They want to assign you specific seats, but yet they also want you to place your order at the front counter.  With the way the system works, they basically won't allow you to place your order and make you stand in line until they have seats to assign you.  This means that you could be standing in line to place your order for kind of a long time.  There were three of us when I went, and they kept telling us we'd have to keep waiting, because they didn't have space for three, only two.  They had us stand in front of the counter at the front of the line to wait to order until there were seats for us.  So, we didn't lose our place in line, but at the same time, there probably was a party of two in line behind us that could have ordered and been seated ahead of us.  Basically, I think their ordering and seating system could use some adjustments, but the food is amazing. They have an option where you can order the food to go, in which then there is a separate place where you can place your order and you don't have to wait.  Whatever you decide to order here, do yourself a favor and get an order of churros and chocolate sauce to go with it.",0.9769,0.895,0.094,0.01,0.6241666666666668

There was a roughly 20 minute wait in line for our party, but it didn't feel terribly long; we somehow seemed to get in ahead of the lunch crowd. On the plus side, that gave me plenty of time to absorb the menu and decide. While I finally decided on the Choriqueso torta and an Aztec hot chocolate, I was also able to sample the Ahogada and Milanesa tortas, Carnitas caldo, and churros.  The chorizo wasn't as spicy or greasy as others I've had, but the roasted poblanos and onions made up for the spiciness; the tomatillo salsa it comes with added nice contrast, though, particularly from the fresh taste of cilantro. It was a pretty good sandwich, but after half I'd had enough and wanted a change of flavors. I'm honestly not even sure why I picked this as chorizo anything is not on the top of my fav meats The hot chocolate was decadently thick and rich (with an interestingly sour/fruity tang to it), but too much so for my tastes--it was like a cup of melted dark chocolate, which is not something I've developed a taste for yet. While I couldn't detect any chile or allspice, another person I was with tried it and said it had a kick, so maybe our tastebuds processed it differently? Don't freak out over how small the cup it's served in is, anything larger and you'd probably make yourself sick from this stuff.  The Milanesa was good, especially if you want something on the more mild end of things. Totally was not expecting it to made with what was essentially a chicken schnitzel. Definitely not a bad thing to me. Now the carnitas--that's the stuff dreams are made of. Big chunks of tender, juicy pork were to be found in the Ahogada and Carnitas caldo. But beware if spicy is not your thing--the tomato sauce of the Ahogada and the broth of the caldo pack a serious punch, even for people who are used to spicy stuff (like the people I went with).  And those churros? *unintelligble sounds of delight* They're brought out fresh and hot with a thick chocolate dipping sauce. These actually aren't overly sweet despite being coated in crunchy sugar, cinnamon, and a touch of ground chocolate.  I really hope I'm able to go back because I felt like I made lackluster choices for my tastes and the years of wait probably boosted my expectations way too high. Aside from that, it's really nice to see a chef of his caliber (and one of my top favs) offering their quality creations at a reasonable/accessible price and not skimping on the portions.",0.9972,0.803,0.167,0.03,0.5972784391534393

2012-01-05,5.0,I gave this place the best rating because of the food alone. I read other reviews on yelp that had no compliants but only gave 4 stars- I guess the only way those reviewers would give 5 stars is if the food was also free.  I have had the Ahogada and the cubana both delicious. However I'm vietnamese so I love soups as meals but I am extremely picky about them. I was actually reluctant to try the caldos here for fear that I would be disappointed. I orderd the Fideo and really loved it. The broth was complex and the texture of the ingredients complimented the flavors. The pork belly was insanely good. No wonder there is a screen blocking your view of how they make their caldos.  As for service. I thought for how busy this place is the staff balances it by being very pleasant- full of smiles and helpful suggestions. The hostess is very informative as well as checking back in with you about wait times often.  I especially liked this place because on my fourth visit here an obnoxious guy ( He pretended to know Rick Bayless by saying hi to him and asking why is this place always so busy. If you really knew a chef/owner of a busy restaurant it is never seen as a problem that it is constantly busy. Rick just nodded at him without a reply.) cut in front of me to place his order. He knew he cut in front of me - I mean I was standing in front of him for the last 30 minutes. But I guess Xoco karma balances things out here. I was seated next to him and my food came out quickly. I was finished eating and got up to leave before he ever got his food. I saw him look over and look confused about why his food wasn't out yet.

However, I love Rick Bayless so much that I ignore his love for all things cilantro and brave his wonderfully created and composed sandwiches. Either I've never had cilantro/parsley the way it should be done, or Rick has managed to incorporate this ingredient in a new and wonderful way. I've had almost everything off the menu (except desserts and some of the salads). The vegetarian sandwich (mushrooms and cheese) is oh so delicioso. The spicy beef sandwich (eat in only) is served in a bowl with this spicy broth... well. I would've drank it all or sopped it up with more bread if I had any leftover. The ceviche/seafood salads are excellent and fresh. I love that much (if not all) of the food is organic and local. The bread is the perfect heartiness and crunchiness for these sandwiches. Yes.

2011-12-31,5.0,"I had been hoping to dine at Rick Bayless's restaurants during my trip to Chicago in October. When it was looking unlikely we'd make it to Frontera Grill for dinner, my friend and I decided to pop into XOCO for a late lunch.  I ordered the day's special tortas--al pastor. The pork was smoked with red chilies and cooked with sweet pineapple. The sandwich was packed with lots of tender meat. It was so flavorful--sweet, spicy and savory all in one bite. And the bread--oh, the bread. The secret to a good torta is the bread--it should be toasted and crispy, providing a little crunch with each bite. The bread here was spot on. My friend ordered the seafood caldo. He gave it an enthusiastic thumbs-up and after the spoonful I tried, I'd have to agree. It was flavorful, with a mix of chilies and lime. There was tons of sustainable seafood in this soup--it's definitely a hearty meal in a bowl.  But the real unsung star of lunch was the tortilla chips. Now I've eaten a lot of tortilla chips in my day, so I don't take what I'm about to write lightly. These just might be the best tortilla chips I've ever eaten. No joke. They were so fresh, very light and packed with corn flavor. The accompanying salsas were fresh and flavorful, nicely seasoned with a touch of spice. And the guacamole was great--very creamy, with a good balance of the buttery avocado and citrus. As if we weren't stuffed from lunch, we decided to try dessert too.  We split a churro and a soft-serve ice cream. The churro was lightly fried, made fresh with a hint of corn and cinnamon. The soft-serve ice cream was smooth and rich, with crumbled brownie on top. The brownie was made with a hint of pasilla peppers, giving it a nice touch of heat that paired well with the sweet ice cream. We picked up some cookies for later, and they were all quite tasty too. I was really impressed how smoothly things ran at XOCO. When we walked in, I was a little worried how things might go since they don't offer waiter service--would it be like a land grab in the wild, wild west? Thankfully, the hostess here had things under control, setting aside tables as diner entered. I was thoroughly impressed how smoothly things ran--from getting a table to ordering to getting our food, it was a well-oiled, coordinated machine. I wish more fast casual shops were this efficient! XOCO isn't the most formal of eateries, but it's a good spot for a quick, casual lunch without having to sacrifice the quality of the food for price and convenience.",0.9922,0.855,0.138,0.007,0.5728690476190476
2011-12-31,5.0,"I've been waiting to finally find good Mexican food east of California, just a little something to remind me of San Diego. This not only brought me back to San Diego, but gave me a taste of Mexican food that is rare even in the golden state.  Beer selection: Very impressive beer selection, especially with the Goose Island Fleur exclusively brewed for Xoco and the Rabbit Ale with just enough hops to wash down those tortas. Aztec Hot Chocolate: Similar to the one offered at Max Brennner's, this is simple yet so decadently guilty - essentially melted chocolate with chili and allspice. Yum. Chips and Guac: Guac wasn't super impressive, but it is Guac so I'm a fan! Tomatillo salsa and Red Chili Salsa were very good, right on par with SoCal. An additional thumbs up for using homemade fried chips instead of packaged dry tortilla chips. Xoco Salad: Normal salad - thumbs up for adding fresh avocado, but thumbs down for the high price of 9.50 Wood-Roasted Chicken Pozole: This is an awesome soup that would be the perfect Hangover medicine of Mexican food alongside Spicy Beef Tripe Soup. Big chunks of roasted chicken, Puffed Corn Pozole (like really large barley) to soak up that broth, and spiced up with a kick of chili and lime. Pepito Torta: Awesome, tender braised shortribs that falls apart in your mouth like pulled pork or brisket, caramalized onions/beans/Jack cheese to further please your umami cravings, and pickled jalapenos to add a little flavor. Top Chef Torta: As if tender braised lengua (beef tongue) wasn't enough, they add in that spicy Chorizo just to spoil you. What made this my favorite Mexican dish I've ever had outside of California, however, was that the whole combo of these two amazing meats, potatoes, avocado, and salsa verde. If they changed that avocado to guac, and added in some pico de gallo/salsa fresca, however, this would quickly be a contender even with SoCal caliber places. Churros with Chocolate Shot for dipping: This is not your Costco or state fair churro. This is the original churro just like those I've had in Spain, seasoned with complex sugars and cinnamon, fried crispy on the outside and smooth on the inside, complete with thick melted chocolate for dunking.  Don't get turned off by the long wait, it is well worth the wait. On my next trip to Chicago, this will be one of my first stops!",0.9963,0.821,0.157,0.022,0.5274863163656266

The brother also really liked the beer selection. He settled on Fleur, the beer that Goose Island only brews for Bayless (how badass is that). Fair warning, it's infused with hibiscus flowers. It's delicious, but it has tea-like undertones, which may not be everyone's cup of tea (no pun intended). Let me tell you what, though. It's all about the churros. They are hot, cinnamon sugarry tubes of amazingness. Get them with the chocolate shot. You don't need it, but it's just so good as a dip - kind of bitter mixed with the cinnamon sugar...omg heaven.

2011-12-28,4.0,"On my holiday weekend to Chicago, I planned for XOCO to be my first food stop. After reading all the reviews, I was expecting to brave the cold for at least an hour in a line that was out the front door. To my pleasant surprise, people must have been staying in cause of the sudden rain and departures for Christmas, so we came in and immediately were reserved a table while we ordered!  The cashier was a very nice guy, who recommended our first selections at XOCO. To start, we ordered guacamole, which was already at our table when we finished ordering and walked over to it--how nice! This was more than enough for two people (even had leftover chips, and they gave us fresh pico de gallo to go for free!). Really, really tasty stuff but got a few chips that were too salty.  We also got the ahogada, as it is highly acclaimed in these reviews. It's the pork one with an upside down torta in a tomato broth. They split it between the two of us in two bowls. It was a great sandwich with some fresh heartiness to it, but I thought it was a little overpowered by a dull, one note taste from the broth. I think this torta's overhyped and nice in concept that you can dip it and make it soggy, but it was just OK. The carnitas soup was really great--hearty and refreshing at the same time--also easily spilt between two people. It was like finding little surprises inside...not only were there potato dumplings inside, there were silky bites of avocado, crispy pork, and then a nutty arugula to finish up the bite. All very well combined. Could be because of the two items I tried, but found that after finishing it all everything just tasted the same and missed sort of different flavor profile. We finished with churros and the chocolate dipping sauce, which was so, so good. I don't think it was anything different from a good churro elsewhere--the difference is, quality quality ingredients in a fast-food like setting! If you come as a couple, get the guacamole (without devouring it all), churros, a torta and soup to split and you'll be full.",0.9938,0.831,0.147,0.023,0.5762654320987656

I'm writing about the one major flaw in this place. Tourists, tourists, TOURISTS! Every time I come in here, there's a deep line ahead of me, and it seems to be full of tourists who not only have never been to this restaurant before, but who seem to have never been to any restaurant at all. None of them think about doing apparently ridiculous things like looking at the menu while they're in line, or perusing the drink case while they wait to order, or maybe even getting their means of payment out before it's due. No, why do any of that when you can wander around the city obliviously as if no one might be waiting on you. They make it really difficult for native Chicagoans to pop in and grab something and get on to where they might need to go, like work. Please tourists, helps us native Chicagoans out. Here's what you can do. 1. Read the menu while you're in line. Don't wait til you get to the register and make the cashier read the whole thing to you. Heck, maybe get on your smartphone and look at the menu before you even get there. It's a world famous restaurateur's place after all.  2. Don't insist they give you something they're telling you they don't have. None of the nice people working there can make special cups or food not on their menu appear out of thin air.  3. Don't ask a hundred questions. They're not your waiter and there's people's waiting on you. If you're there alone, fine, then ask about how they roast their own cocoa nibs. If there are people in line behind you, look it up on the internet. It's there. World famous. 4. Get your money out before they tell you to pay. Don't just stand there looking flummoxed.

2011-12-18,4.0,"Whenever I am in Chicago, hungry, and have time, I look for restaurants bustling with people. It is my theory that the good restaurants are the crowded restaurants. XOCO held true to my theory.* While standing in line for 40 minutes, I was able to have a long look at the menu. I commend XOCO for this; the menu was a ten-foot wide billboard that could be seen from fifty feet away. When I finally arrived at the register, I ordered the Choriqueso for $9.   The Choriqueso is a type of Torta consisting of homemade chorizo sausage, roasted poblano, artisan jack cheese, and tomatillo salsa. If you are like me, and like sausage, then this will be the best Torta you will ever eat. It is that simple. The cool and acidic tomatillo salsa contrasts the warm and smooth artisan jack cheese perfectly- both of which augment the phenomenal sausage. It must be from some obscure farm. I have cooked sausage from Bobak's, Dean and Deluca's, and Casey's- and non has ever tasted like this sausage. I was really able to taste the quality of the meat. The chef, a former Iron Chef, knows what he is doing. He certainly had a good recipe, and used quality ingredients.  While eating my Choriqueso, I overheard the table next to me obsessing about their exotic ""hot chocolates"". After thirty seconds of my eavesdropping, I found myself regretting not placing an order for one. The four old ladies were absolutely raving about the texture and flavor. ""This is the best cocoa I have ever had"". Coming from a grandma, who has most likely gone through a lot of hot cocoas, I confidently declare that the ""hot chocolate"" from XOCO must be pretty darn good. If it were not for my dentist appointment, I would have gone back in line and waited another 40 minutes for one. Do not let the thought of hispanic-hot-cocoa deter you. Overall, XOCO has some of the best Mexican food out there. If you are like me, and willing to wait for your meal, then you will not be disappointed. Although you can order 30 different meals from Taco Bell in the time it will take you to order one meal from XOCO, I guarantee you will leave XOCO at least 31 times more satisfied. A good Choriqueso will (possibly) be in your stomach, and (hopefully) a mug of hot chocolate will be in your hand.  *On my way out I asked an employee if they are always crowded, and she replied, ""Unless it tuesday past 3"".

2011-12-16,5.0,"Been to Frontera, was a fan and tried some of Rick Bayless' store bought stuff (really like his verde enchilada sauce, hard to find good green sauce in the store). So of course had to try XOCO as well. First time (yes, been here twice in 2 weeks, that tells you something), we brought a couple friends visiting from Ohio. To put it shortly (as if the star-rating didn't give it away) WE ALL LOVED IT.  Interesting set up, you come in, wait in line to order, but if you're eating-in, you have to way to receive a table number before you can order. That delays it sometimes if there aren't table free - but I do like this better than the alternative it could have been (standing with warm, delicious food, hovering over people in what would become a crowded area, cursing under your breath for people to leave). Both times we went, we were greeted by Max, he was like an all-around host/waiter/manager, telling you how things work, asking if you want a drink while you wait, answering questions, giving you your table, etc. He is very nice and gets 5 stars himself. As for the wait, we went on a Saturday around 7 p.m. and waiting 20-25 minutes, another day on a Tuesday same time, about a 10-15 min wait. Now the food: WOW! Foodgasms all around the first time. We loved the guac, they only do regular guac, but it was just so fresh and delicious - I wanted to bathe in it. Chips are fresh, and it comes with a bit of their verde/tomatillo and red sauce. I love gauc in general, so among 4 of us, we got 2 orders. I think it was just right. One of my friends wasn't a fan of guac (she has this thing about certain foods not being certain colors, i.e. no food should be blue so she doesn't like blueberries, ha). She tried the guac though and had to admit she really liked it, and continued to have more. Main meal - I got the pepito, hubby had woodland mushroom torta (with jack cheese instead of goat since he doesn't like goat cheese) - he loved it, other friend got the Shortrib Red Chile Soup (meal in the bowl/caldo). I was skeptical at first, is soup a meal? But this was very large, and hearty. And my friend could not stop talking about how much she loved the broth - she would have also probably bathed in it (lots of that going on at this restaurant, apparently). My pepito was awesome, such great flavors, great meat, and that jack cheese is so good!  Dessert: We go the churros with chocolate dipping sauce. Very good, the dipping sauce was a bit too dark choc. taste for me, but still loved the churro. They have other desserts that sound so good, can't wait to try them. This was totally a 5 star experience. The 2nd time, it wasn't quite 5 stars, but not enough for me to change my rating. The guac was a 9.5/10 (instead of 15/10 the first time), but the chips were even better than the first time. I got the Cubana (torta from griddle), it's bigger than the regular torta. It was good, but I liked the pepito better. Still a great experience, and would go back again in a heartbeat.",0.9995,0.716,0.269,0.016,0.5187307137307137

2011-12-06,4.0,"XOCO, love of my life. Bless Rick Bayless for opening a Mexican eatery that's a middle ground between Frontera Grill and $1 carne asada tacos from Maxwell Street Market. I can't believe there are 1200 reviews of this place, and I can't believe I haven't written one up yet, seeing as how I live down the street and eat here about 2x/month. I love the caldos and the tortas, ESPECIALLY the Cubana. With a salad, this can be made into two meals. Admittedly, I've rarely achieved letting the second half of a torta make it into my refrigerator. I wish they would deliver or let me at least call-in orders, but alas, I'm resigned to continue waiting my 15 minutes in house for take-out. It's not all bad though. At least I get to savor my hot chocolate during those moments. I'm currently on a big Aztec kick to combat the onslaught of winter doldrums, though prior to this I was an Almendrado girl all the way. And no, these are not your average hot chocolates, though that's exactly why you get them: to experience hot cocoa from an authentically rich and flavorful place that's the complete antithesis of your packets of Swiss Miss. PSA: They chucked the Thursday mole poblano special in favor of an al pastor torta that my boyfriend was not as fond of. Also, while I will eagerly devour the chocolate hazelnut cookie, I stopped buying it because it's pretty overpriced at $2.50 and I can find awesome cookies at Fox and Obel down the street for less. Other than that, I think anything on the menu is a pretty safe bet. So go and take your friends.",0.9865,0.783,0.157,0.059,0.5088453661034307

I have been here numerous times, and still have never had a bad experience with service or food.  Sure, the wait can be long, but that is no big deal because the food is pretty damn good.   My favorites: Cochinita Pibil -  A torta with roasted pig, black bean, onion, etc.  Really, really good stuff.  I'm going to warn you though: if you don't like really spicy food, then either don't order this or don't dip the torta in the sauce.  Yes, the sauce has Habenero in it.  I can handle a lot of spice, but have dipped way too much into one bite before.  I paid for it for the next five minutes.  So my tip is if you're going to dip it in, don't dip too much at one time. Seafood Caldo - It is what it is.  A caldo and a damn good one.  The broth is excellent and full of Shrimp, Mussels, and Catfish.  Actually the Mussels used in this are huge and not the standard appetizer Mussels.  I have never seen them this big in the midwest.  There's also some good stuff like big cuts of tender potatos and onions. Mexico City Hot Chocolate, and Aztec Hot Chocolate - Yes, both hot chocolates (obviously).  Well, let's just say that I'm pretty sure they grind and roast their own cocoa beans.  yes, very fresh and how a real hot chocolate should be.  The Mexico City Hot Chocolate has a nice taste, and it's thick.  They must put some sort of spices in it like cinnamon, but it's really damn good.  The Aztec is the original hot chocolate (historically).  There's cayenne pepper in this and allspice.  I personally don't think it's spicy, but then again my tolerance for spiciness is pretty high. Churros - Well this is obvious.  Order it with the soft serve ice cream and Chocolate.  Very good. Honorable Mentions: Shortrib Red Chile Soup and Choriqueso torta.  Both still really good.  Choriqueso is better of the two in my opinion. So recommendation?  Just go there.  If you are ""I'm about to pass out"" hungry, then don't go because you're going to have to wait in line.  There are not many seats and there's a lot of demand, if you know what I mean.  Order anything on the menu.  Honestly, you can't go wrong at Xoco.",0.9984,0.74,0.22,0.041,0.5577626262626263

When we saw the number of reviews XOCO had, (over 1,000.... CRAZY!), we knew we had to stop. As we approached the building, there was a large coach bus sitting there. We saw a line of people and thought it must be people waiting to get on the bus. WRONG. The line of people was for XOCO. XOCO Rule #1 - expect a line. A super nice guy from XOCO came outside to talk to the people in line. We were debating whether we should wait or not after he said it would be about an hour. He convinced us that we should.... so there we stood. We waited.... and waited.... and finally it was our turn to order our food and see if this over-hyped restaurant could really live up to its reputation. The guy was right- it was just about an hour wait.  All I'm going to say is that it was probably some of the best food I've had in my life. Seriously. Based upon a recommendation from the aforementioned employee, I tried the Milanesa - a Torta made on the griddle: Crispy Gunthorp chicken, black beans (made with pork), artisan Jack cheese, pickled jalapenos, tomatillo-avocado salsa -$10.00. All of the flavors blended perfectly. I washed this amazing sandwich down with a glass of their homemade lemonade which was insanely tart... but delicious. After we finished our sandwiches, they brought out the churros that we ordered with some chocolate sauce. Fresh churros. I watched them making the churros as we stood at the counter to order. They definitely taste better than your average churro you'd buy from a street vendor. I wouldn't say the chocolate sauce was fantastic, but the churro definitely was.

That's what an Ahogada looks like! I died a bit inside, as it taunted ""I am the best carnitas ever!""  I drowned my 'taking a premature sandwich' shame in my bowl of guac and chips.

I was afraid it might be too thick so the cashier let me try a sample first. It was a lot thicker than my friend's Almendrado, but I still liked mine better than hers. I'll have to go back to try the other varieties though. We both ordered the Top Chef Torta, which was the special torta of the day. The braised beef tongue was very tender and the chorizo gave it a nice kick. The bread they used was a little different than what I've become accustomed to in Houston.

Having mentioned Xoco's more laid back approach to Bayless' cuisine I was not surprised to find the restaurant featuring a cafeteria style ordering format, but what I was surprised to find was the lack of a line - something that had prevented previous attempts to visit Xoco, particularly during a February visit when the temperatures were near zero.  Greeted promptly on entering I was asked if I was ready to order and after a few questions regarding the daily rotating selection of pastries and empanadas I made my choices, was handed a number, and found seating near the door where I could watch the traffic on Clark Street. Sitting for mere moments sipping my water (both still and sparkling are complimentary and on tap) while listening to the festive overhead soundtrack one of a trio of servers would arrive with my first item; the daily Muffin featuring Honeycrisp Apple, Pecan Frangipan, and Sugar Brandy Glaze served warm and absolutely full of shredded apples balanced adeptly by soft notes from the frangipan.  Always impressed by Chef Bayless' ability to incorporate a multitude of tastes, textures, and spices into his food the soft interior was only improved through the use of large Belgian vanilla sugars coating the outside and the slight nose of brandy punctuated by cinnamon; a truly great start and a veritable bargain at $2.50. With my muffin only half gone as I coordinated a meeting place with my sister via text my ""main course"" of the morning would arrive perhaps ten minutes after seating in the form of ""Torreja,"" or ""Mexican style French Toast"" as it was described by my server.  Beginning first with the French Toast itself, a personal favorite for vacation breakfast, it may sound like hyperbole but I'd place the Torreja amongst the top 5 I have ever tasted as the thick bread was perfectly caramelized on the exterior and nearly a liquid custard on the interior - a veritable bread pudding, if you will.  With notes of cinnamon prevailing and topped amply with Gunthorp bacon-pecan sprinkles the sweet/savory balance was quite impressive to begin with, but all the moreso with the addition of local pure maple syrup.  Gilding the lily?  Absolutely. With the French Toast still wowing me my ""dessert"" (yes, at breakfast!) would arrive last in the form of Xoco's most famous item - a single ""Mexican doughnut"" or Churro heavily dusted with spicy cinnamon and sugar plus a ""Hot Chocolate Shot"" on the side for dunking.  Crispy on the outside, soft within, and perfectly accented by the slightly fruity pure Mexican cocoa I cannot say this was the absolute best Churro I've ever had, but considering the price and the quality of the chocolate my only regret in ordering it was that I didn't go for the trio and pair it with a cup of Xoco's drinking cocoa, though all things considering there was plenty more eating to do on this trip and given the quality (and modest price) I've no doubt I will be back.",0.9971,0.831,0.139,0.03,0.4467673992673993
2011-11-18,5.0,"My boyfriend and I stopped in here for an early dinner (or a late lunch for us) for his birthday. I've been curious about this restaurant for a while now and I couldn't afford Frontera Grill or Topolobampo, so Xoco was perfect.  We had probably a 5 minute wait, so I guess we were really lucky. I had the Choriqueso( Homemade chorizo sausage, roasted poblano, artisan Jack cheese, tomatillo salsa. $9.00)was delicious! The verde salsa it came with was amazing. My boyfriend had the Cubana (Smoked Gunthorp pork loin and bacon, black beans, avocado, artisan Jack, chipotle mustard. $11.50) and he really enjoyed it. To drink, I had the Agua de Jamaica and it was sooooo good! I highly recommend it if you like sweet fruit teas. For dessert, we had a piece of the Choco-Flan and a Churro...Both were to die for.   For the two of us, the bill was about 35. Not bad at all for an excellent dinner for two in Chicago. The only thing I didn't like was that you had to ask for a take-out bag. At first I expected them to ask if we wanted to take the rest of our meal home, but after a while, I saw the people next to us go up to the cashier and ask for one so we did the same. Another thing that I didn't like was the seating. Most of the seating has you facing a wall. That made me feel odd, but the food definitely made up for that! This was our first time to Xoco and we both were extremely impressed. Also, we were able to see Rick Bayless! I didn't want to sound like a fangirl, but my bf and I did say that we enjoyed the food and he said thank you. It was a unique experience and I loved the fact that we were able to see him.",0.9917,0.803,0.165,0.031,0.6271666666666668

The staff is friendly and well organized as well as very attentive. The first time we went I got the Carnitas Caldos : slow-cooked Gunthorp pork carnitas, potato-masa dumplings, chayote, roasted serrano chile, greens, arugula, avocado- soooo good, the ingredients were fresh and the flavors were truly authentic. It was like being wrapped in a spicy, warm and delicious Mexican blanket while being sprinkled with lime. Perfect for a cold winters day.  The BF got Ahogada sandwich: golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, pickled onions. RECOMMENDED. The sauce the 'wich was sitting in was a mixture of spicy tomato-y goodness. It just melted in your mouth. We finished up our meal with a homemade churro and home made Mexican ice cream. Now I have had a churro before, BUT NOT like this one! It was golden, sugary, and delicious topped with the smooth milky ice cream, I forgot I was full from my Caldos!  As I sipped my chocolate espresso ( also recommended) with lively folk music echoing throughout the restaurant,  I longed to be in Mexico, the cold Chicago air screaming down the street.

So we wandered around the block to find something else, but the places we were interested in trying were closed for lunch, or lunch time was over (2pm). We made our way back to XOCO and decided to just order food to go.  I split the goat barbacoa torta (special of the day) and pork belly vermicelli noodle caldo, and then ordered the churros with chocolate dipping sauce. The sandwich was pretty delicious, the avocado went really well with it. The noodle soup felt a little more asian (like taiwanese beef noodle soup), and I liked the kick it had to it. Delicious! The churros were also good... not too sweet. I tried it with the dipping sauce, but I was not a fan... the sauce was a little sour and the sourness was too overpowering. I'd love to come back if the wait wasn't so ridiculous. At least their to-go ordering was pretty quick.",0.9879,0.76,0.194,0.045,0.5444099378881988

I was impressed how quickly we were able to get seats - don't be intimidated once you walk in, we had been planning to just get take out, but our wait was less than 5 minutes even for a full house.  We got the Chips & Guacamole/Salsas, Choriqueso Torta and Ahogada torta. I'll start with the Chips & Guac, which are really the reason I can't give this place 5 solid stars. The guacamole was just OK - not good or bad, definitely more dense than I like mine and seemed kind of pedestrian in general. Neither of us cared for both of the salsas, one too sweet, the other too tart, and neither had much heat at all. The chips are my main gripe though - I have to assume they're using house made chips because it's Rick Bayless' place....but they were entirely undistinguishable from the cheap grocery store kind. Totally killed it for me. The Choriqueso torta was good - on French bread which was weird, but the sauce was a very heavy tomato base and seemed kind of like a Mexican street-food take on your meatball sub. Overall tasty. The Ahogada was both exciting and weird. There was just way too much going on - tart, spicy, sweet, sour....there was something new in every bite but not necessarily in a good way. More like torta going through an identity crisis. The heat was nice though and overall tasty. That said - their 'Mexican Style Hot Chocolate' is maybe the best thing one I've ever had.

I have a low tolerance for spice, and this was on the spicier side for me, but I enjoyed it. The empanada was flaky and the crust was well executed - I enjoyed the crust more than what was on the inside. I also had a muffin. The muffin was really good. Way better than the crap Sprinkles tries to pawn off on people. I also ordered a classic hot chocolate with 2% milk and dulce de leche. I couldn't taste much of the dulce de leche until the end of the glass, but the hot chocolate was VERY chocolate-y and VERY good. I enjoy the hot chocolate from Ghirardelli's more than here, but this was far superior to the Starbuck's hot chocolate, which I frequently get. I was trying to decide between 3 and 4 stars, but I went with 3 because I couldn't find descriptions of what was in everything (still have no idea what was in my muffin or empanada) and the woman behind the counter was not helpful at informing me when I asked her.

2011-11-07,5.0,"Salivation inducing wafts of roasting cacao beans will gently tug you in the direction of XOCO from a block or two away. This indescribably lustful scent is a beacon of hope in a city that can at times deliver aromas more akin to septic gas and motor oil. This wonderful chocolate fragrance is attributed to the on-site roasting of cacao beans that go on to produce authentic, traditional hot chocolate... the sort of hot chocolate that you want to hug with your mouth in a long embrace. It is thick, shimmery and can be delightfully dark depending on the variety you select.  Although I could continue to dote over the hot chocolate, I realize this place kicks ass in innumerable other ways. Obviously, with Rick Bayless involved, one can expect to have whatever meal in question literally redefined. I was here for breakfast, and was blown away by the friendly, efficient service that kept the ravenous crowds moving through. I ordered the aforementioned hot chocolate of the Aztec variety, a churro, and a poblano empanada. A more rewarding breakfast simply cannot be had. The churro's dusty surface of confection was the perfect contrast to the savory but subtle corn flavored interior... and it was even better when dismembered and submerged into my hot chocolate. The empanada was fresh, flaky and had a healthy but not overwhelming spice for the early morning. I also tried a bit of the wood-fired french toast with particles of candied bacon. It was like french toast, but a much better dresser that hit a lot more notes on the palette... It was incredible.  When more than one typical restaurant offerring is outdone to almost enlightenment standards, it leaves one with a mythical reflection of the meal. Living a painful 9 hours away creates a bit of a burden of inaccessibility, but I am certain that each visit to Chicago will contain at least one nourishing stop here. While, I can't wait to get back to XOCO to carefully savor every last dish on the menu, I sort of enjoy holding them in such an insatiable yet affectionate regard... much like a lover's quarrel.",0.9881,0.811,0.15,0.039,0.5567099567099567

Awesome to get to see him in person and know he is still so active in all of his places. So the above mentioned salsa was on the pibil. Even though it was spicy it worked well with the juicy pork and the pickled onions took the edge off. The mushroom torta was about as good of a vegetarian option your gonna find. The grilled shrooms with goat cheese is like tomatoes and basil - it just works so perfectly. As if that wasn't enough we also got the carnitas caldo that was crazy good. The porky broth was seasoned just right and the greens added a nice pepper bite to ward off the richness. The limonada was more limey then lemony but in a good way. I had a 5 rabbits golden ale that was had some good citrus note and helped to calm the demon spawn habenero salsa that i was choking down. We also took one of the almond hot chocolates to go - it was a little chilly this night. It was small but sooooo rich - it prob could have been diluted by half and still be knock your socks off good.

The onions were done just right. In a word: scrumptious!  The chips and guac were also quite tasty. After having a mediocre experience at Frontera that left me saying ""I make better guac than Rick Bayless"" I was a bit skeptical to give his guac another go. Rick has redeemed himself. It was well seasoned and had a nice little kick to it. My only criticism is that the portion was a little on the small side...but I'm also a piggie. The salsas that accompany the guac were also quite nice as were the chips. Nom nom nom.  We rounded out lunch with an order of churros. So.freakin.good.

2011-10-17,4.0,"We're slowly checking off the list of Rick Bayless restaurants to dine in: next up, XOCO! It was a chilly Saturday morning, perfect for some Mexican street food.   Atmosphere/Service: Be prepared to wait if you're dining in. Even though this is considered a ""quick-service café"", plan on being here for a while. They won't take your order until there is seating available (although on the plus side, this ensures that your food is always fresh & hot).  The seating is somewhat limited, and there are only a couple of outdoor seating options. However, I did like that there was a person managing the order line and seating people; this made for a faster & more efficient process. Food: While we were waiting in line, I was stressing out since there were SO many items on the menu that I wanted to order; everything sounds amazing!  I finally settled on a Milanesa torta for lunch and it will be harder to order anything else next time. SO delicious! Warm bread, thin and lightly breaded crispy Gunthorp chicken, black beans (made with pork), artisan Jack cheese, pickled jalapenos and a tomatillo-avocado salsa made for a wonderful torta. I normally shy away from tortas because they can be a bit dry, but this was not the case here. I liked the side of green salsa as well, perfect for dipping my torta. Yum. The chips and guacamole was nothing to write home about, although I did like the hint of lime on the chips.  For dessert, we got the order of churros (one of my main reasons for hitting up XOCO). We had finished eating for over 20 minutes and still were waiting for our churros. I'm glad we waited though as they arrived piping hot and fresh - with just the right amount of cinnamon and sugar. SO good. Best of all, I loved how all of the food ingredients were local; I like knowing where my food comes from!  It's pretty neat to know that the bread I was eating was from a small suburb close to where I grew up and the chicken I was eating was raised on an organic farm. Props to XOCO for using both local and organic foods. They also have a vegetable garden on the rooftop that supplies a lot of the ingredients. Awesome.

I ate at Xoco by myself tonight and would enjoy going back with a friend or small group of friends.  Here's what I ate: - Chips, guac, and salsa This was one of the only (mildly) disappointing parts of my meal.  The guacamole was, well, heavier than I expected, and the chips were both too salty (especially to pair with guac and salsa) and pretty much indistinguishable from store-bought corn chips.  The two salsas, though, were mild and very tasty (both on the chips and for dunking my torta in!).  By the way, portion-wise, this'd be absolutely fine to share amongst 2-4 people! (it was a hefty scoop of guac!) - Orange / passion fruit fresca Small (considering the large amount of ice) and a bit too sweet for my taste, but still quite refreshing. - Chicken tinga torta Wow!  The chicken was very tender, and paired just perfectly with avocado, cheese, onions, and light spices... but especially with the deliciously crisp and perfectly baked bread!  Everything was in exactly the right proportion, and miraculously the whole thing was not only melt-in-your-mouth good, but also not messy in the slightest; most tortas I've had in the past quickly sog up the bread and everything falls apart.  Not this torta!  Dipping it into the red sauce... mmm mmm!   - Churro with chocolate dipping sauce HOLY DELICIOUS!  I'm just angry I didn't get the order-of-three instead of my single churro.  It's hard to describe what made this churro so amazingly awesome, but... it just was.  Perfect texture, not too sweet, not greasy.  It was everything your standard carnival churro is not.  And the dipping sauce?  Well, if you're expecting hershey's syrup, you'd be in for a bittersweet surprise, because this wonderful thick chocolate sauce was definitely on the bittersweet side.  Complimented the churro delightfully! and lastly... - ""Authentic"" chocolate + water drink I hesitated to order this.  Watered down chocolate?  Not milk?  Sounded pretty unappetizing to me, but hey, everyone raved about it so I had to try it.  And I'm sure glad I did!  It was like drinking a melted high-quality bittersweet chocolate bar with small flecks of cacao beans, and I mean that in a very good way.  Though I happily drank the whole thing, I would have been just as pleased to share this with one or two others since it was so very very rich.  I'm actually worried about having trouble sleeping tonight after that! *  *  * Oh, and about the wait?  Well, undoubtedly due to my good looks (ha!)

My husband and I came around lunch time (11.30) on a weekday and the place was pretty busy. I both ordered Torta. One with chorizo, one with cochinita pibil as well as a churro for dessert. Both tortas come with a salsa on the side. The taste of both tortas were absolutely amazing. All though I have to say the bread they use is not the traditional bread you would expect when ordering a torta. It is more like a piece of french bread. I liked it anyways. The salsa on the side (waiter warned us that it is very hot) has a rather sour taste to me than spicy but was still good.  The churro was amazingly delicious!!!!!!! I could have eaten 10 of those.  The only downside of the place is the seating arrangement. Once you come in you are asked if you want to sit on a table or on one of the stools on the bar. If you want a table you are actually sharing it with others.

The whole ""you wait in line but can't place  your order until you have a table"" thing is kind of annoying.

2011-09-18,5.0,"TLDR Version:  Awesome food, excellent service.  It's a bit pricey for ""mexican food,"" not enough to ruin your budget, but the food is far from your normal mexican food and well worth the price.  I finally made my way to Chicago and told my friend, ""there's some pretty good mexican food in chicago, or so I've heard.""  Needless to say he was pretty skeptical, but apparently he LOVES tortas.  I was all too excited to stop by XOCO, especially knowing that this joint was started up by Rick Bayless.  The restaurant system as a whole is a different but it works out VERY well and the host that approached as we walked through there door was fantastic.  You'll walk in the place, get greeted by the host and be told to wait in line to place your order.  Once this is done he'll assign and escort you to a table.  When I say this guy was fantastic, it means his memory and attention to detail and his service was top notch.  The service isn't on the same level as a fine dining establishment, but neither is the price so don't expect it.   Of course the most important aspect of yelp is the food.  XOCO specializes in tortas and mexican soups: Pork Belly Vermicelli:  This was a little odd for me.  I felt like this was Mexican version of Vietnamese Pho.  The pork belly was extremely crispy, even after soaking in the south for a fair amount of time.  The broth was smokey and with some spice, the taste for me was very familiar but I just couldn't find the right taste to describe it.  The noodles were very thin and there wasn't that much in my soup.  Overall, I was expecting something else but this soup was very good a solid 3.5 to 4 stars. Milanesa: I opted for the Milanese because I already got pork in my soup, so let's try the Chicken.  This torta was absolutely perfect.  It was a grilled torta, so it really felt a lot like a panini especially with the cheesey nature of the sandwich.  The chicken was tender, very juicy and cooked to perfection.  The green chili based (I'm taking a guess on this) was a great compliment to the torta.  5 Stars. Churros w/ Chocolate Dipping Sauce:  A churro is a churro.  It tasted like a churro and felt like a churro, although I did feel like it was a little lighter, meaning not as dense, as most other churros I've had.  It was tasty and to be honest I could pass on the Chocolate Dipping sauce.  The chocolate was just a more bitter than I like my chocolate, not as bitter as a dark chocolate though.  4 Stars. Overall my experience at XOCO was wonderful.  The kitchen is very busy, and you can see it too.  We went in at around 3pm so there wasn't a big wait and our food got out quickly.  In my opinion, this is a must try place when you're in Chicago.  I'm looking forward to my next visit to Chicago, in which I will be back here.

2011-09-12,5.0,"A year ago I went to Chicago with a group of friends, 3 couples. We wanted to make a point of trying new restaurants so everyone chose one, the only rule was it had to be a place that none of us had visited before. XOCO was my pick, I'm a sucker for good Mexican food, and it turned out to be a crowd-pleasing favorite. We each ordered something different and tasted and passed until everyone had tried everything. A hush fell over our normally loud group as we tucked into the entrees, every one a happy plate when it was over. Then we passed around 3 different desserts, all fantastic. Since that trip whenever we get back to CHI, alone or as a group, we hit XOCO at least once.  I was in CHI last weekend with the girls. XOCO was our dinner stop the first day. Chica #1 ordered her usual and was perfectly content with her torta, upended as it was into a bowl of steaming broth. Chica #2 ended up with pork but thought she was ordering chicken so she switched with me (what I chose turned out to be too hot for this Gringa to handle) and we were both pleased. Chips and guacamole were enjoyed by all, esp. the green salsa. For dessert we had a churro with chocolate and ice cream to dip in (I think I'll skip the chocolate next time, it's too rich for me!) -- it was warm and crispy and I love that ice cream -- and the coconut rice pudding with grilled peaches. As good as the churro is, the rice pudding was the fan favorite. That was Thursday, fast forward to Saturday morning and we were back at XOCO, this time for empanadas.

South American cooking? No. But tasty dessert-making indeed.) EH, OVERRATED - I got the pork belly torta, which was nice because it had good ingredients (arugula, zucchini) but it was soooo underseasoned. It needed a good pinch of salt and something else. Also, I have a problem with paying $12 for a sandwich. I don't know. It just didn't have... oomph. Underwhelming for sure. - Price/value for food/quality/quantity in general. I got the torta and my sis got the seafood caldo but we wanted more, so we paid for kind of pricey chips and dip. - So maybe I came without doing my research, or I just don't know about outdoor dining, but I feel like somebody should have informed me that Xoco isn't a ""sit-down"" restaurant. I don't even know if I should have tipped 20% for a lady to (very attentively, I've give her that) manage a line for available seats and for the servers to tell me that I needed to get my own water refilled inside and I'd have to go back to the register to add something to my order.

While I could easily write a well-articulated review including elegant prose describing the earthy crust of the tortas accented with chile sauce and rich goat cheese or queso anejo, or the sweet sound of the simmering caldos over the din of the not-so-muted conversations during the very worthwhile wait, instead I will reminisce in brutal detail over the sweetness of the churros juxtaposed with the rich, dark, melted chocolate they're served alongside. As with either of the other Rick Bayless-run restaurants, his books and face are featured prominently, and the salt-and-pepper of his hair describe well the way his dishes are accented with artful choices of flavor.  For under 20 dollars for a three-course experience and beverage at Xoco, the only downsides are waiting both to order and for the food to arrive at your small table and learning to properly pronounce the name of the restaurant.

To start off, we had our Jamaica drinks, and the hint of lemon in it (I believe) immediately hit me, it was a nice twist to the traditional drink and was equally as refreshing after a full day of sightseeing.

To top it off, the torta was placed into a panini press which just made the cheese melt and fuse together with the other condiments- heaven!.  I could not say the same for my mom, the chorizo in her Choriqueso torta was not not great, I'm hoping it was because it was seasoned differently to what we were accustomed to, but it was still edible. For desert, we went for the churros which were not too sugary and very light to the stomach, just the right ending.

2011-08-07,4.0,"Fortunately we got there earlier in the day so the wait wasn't so bad.  Being my first time, I spent most of the time scoping the place out.  I was surprised to see Rick Bayless' daughter working behind the counter -- cutting her teeth as a restauranteur in training? -- and was caught off guard when she worked her way down the line asking if we had any questions.  I was a wee bit starstruck :) (though it would've been nice to see the big man, too.) I've never been to a place that almost exclusively served tortas, so that was a nice change of pace from typical taco etc. cuisine.  Like many, we ordered the ahogado.  The meat was sooo tender, the bread had the right bite, and the spicy broth was delish. It was kind of like eating... tomato-based hot sauce in soup form. Awesome to get your hands and face messy digging into this thing; it's hard not to pig out.  The spices definitely went through the wrong pipe once or twice.  The guac was also yummy... how could you ever turn down a dish made from avocados? I also like how they served with with a green and red chile sauce.  The churro was cinnamon delight, and I think we should have ordered more.  I kept looking at the servers bearing trays of churros with such envy. Generally pork is not my preferred meat (except for bacon!) but those carnitas... wow. Now I'm dreaming about tender, juicy pork with a touch of gristle. I want to try all the other piggy options on the menu :)   Also would like to try their beer selection.  It's cool how the restaurant has a casual vibe, but they put in high-end quirks like beer pairings.",0.9857,0.834,0.14,0.025,0.6084807256235828

From handmade churros to Mexican hot sipping chocolate, the flavors and rich and bold.  I wish I could have tried Frontera next door, but when I looked at their prices, it made XOCO sound like a steal!

We settled on a table, and were given a table number and then stood in line to order our food. Since it was in between meals, we decided on an order of chips and salsa, three churros w/ chocolate dipping sauce, two lemonades, and a large chocolate cappuccino. We paid for our items, took our drinks and were seated at our table.

2011-07-26,5.0,"I've tried almost every single torta here and I have to say most of them are pretty darn tasty. My faves are the chicken tinga, the ahogada and the cochinita pibil. Each of these sandwiches have a bit of heat to them, to varying degrees.  The cochinita pibil has habenero as a component of the sammy rather than infused in a sauce, so tell your tastebuds to be prepared for a whoopin'!!  Definitely get the tortas from the wood burning oven over the griddled tortas as the tortas from the wood burning oven creates bread with a super satisfying crunch.  The griddled tortas leaves you with bread that is kinda cracker-like, dry but brittle.  I have yet to try the caldos or any dessert other than the churros. These churros are fantastic, they are hot, dipped in a coarse sugar/cinnamon/ vanilla bean mixture and are served with an optional chocolate sauce. Get the chocolate sauce, it's freaking delicious!   I've also tried the hot chocolate and it's decadent and rich but it's too hot in the summer to get this.  A definite recommend if the wait isn't too long. I'd have to say the average waiting time is a good 30-40 minutes, but once you pay you get seated fairly quickly and they serve you within a couple minutes.  Next time I am definitely getting a caldo!!",0.9881,0.81,0.168,0.022,0.6263457556935818

That's how I felt upon entering XOCO and throughout my dining experience here.  Where do I order? How do I get seated? I just tell the guy that I want to sit inside and then order and then how do I know what table to sit at? What do you mean it's going to take 20 minutes for a seat when I see all these empty seats? What do I tell the person when I'm ordering about where to sit? How do the waiters know where to bring me my food? UGH, WHAT? We were eventually seated towards the back near the busting area? I don't know what it was but a lot of workers were coming in and out, crashing into the door, droppings plates and silverware as a result.  There is only one restroom and when it was finally my turn, there was no toilet paper and it took about 10 minutes for someone to refill the toilet paper.  I just thought it was so weird that a restaurant that was so beloved and hyped would have these management problems. On to the food: ok, the food is pretty good and I'm willing to overlook the problems we had with ordering, seating and having our complete and correct meal served to us because of the food.  The tortas are great (of which, I credit the amazing bread).  I ordered the seafood cocktail (red) and I had a lot of high hopes for it but thought it was just ok.  I also thought the guacamole was just okay too (I felt it was a bit under seasoned).  The churros are delicious and the chocolate sauce is absolutely necessary for dipping.  The real standout was the vanilla bean soft serve with salted caramel dulce de leche and streudel (I think there was bacon in it too?)   I definitely enjoyed my meal but was a bit taken aback by the dining experience.  Hopefully next time I'll be able to dine at Topolobampo or Frontera and the dining experience won't be so hectic.",0.993,0.803,0.15,0.047,0.5604310344827585
2011-07-26,5.0,"I'll be honest, I haven't written a review in ages because I've grown jaded. I just forgot why I loved food and haven't really gotten the same pleasure from finding great dinning like I used to. That changed last weekend. I knew I wanted to hit up one of the Rick Bayless hot-spots, but Topolobampo was way too expensive, Frontera Grill had a line around the corner, and my GPS sent me everywhere but to Frontera Fresco. So I wandered over to XOCO. The place itself is pretty unassuming. In all honesty, it looks like a nice chain restaurant, but just with a huge line. The ordering system is somewhat confusing, so here's the tip I couldn't find on Yelp: They'll come around asking for your party size and if it's for carry out. If you're in a small group (I was by myself) they'll skip you to this random cashier (letting you bypass the line) so you can order and sit down immediately. If you have a big group (and thus need to wait for a table) or if you're ordering to-go, you'll have to wait in that giant line. And the food. I got chips and salsa, a drink, and the Ahogada. Chips and Salsa: Meh. Sure it was decent, but (oh please don't hurt me for saying this) it's about on par with decent chains like Chipotle. Also, the amount of salsa given is pretty small. And in those stupid little bowls that are too small for any normal sized chip to fit in. On the positive side, the amount of time you'll waste trying to scope those last few drops onto your chip will make it feel like your food came relatively fast. Verdict: Unless you LOVE chips, I'd try something else Ahogada: THIS IS WHAT FOOD IS. This was messy, (I got it) spicy, and was as delicious as the Metra is inconsistent. It's basically a carnitas sandwich sitting face down in a bowl of spicy tomato broth. The broth just soaks through the bread, dissolving it in your mouth. As that hot broth dripped down my hand and the spice burned my mouth I felt the kind of pure excitement to be eating this that I wanted to stop every person that balked at the long line and shout at them, ""THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN WAITING IN LINE FOR SUBPAR CARMEL POPCORN!""

In fact, XOCO is housed within the same building as Bayless's other restaurants (Frontera, Topolobampo). As much as I enjoyed Red O, XOCO certainly was a better value across all segments (guacamole, two tortas, and churros with chocolate dipping sauce). The bill for two was approximately $35. By comparison, I paid three times that for a comparable dinner at Red O only two weeks ago.  As at other Bayless concepts, the guacamole and churros at XOCO were excellent. The tortas, which were basically fancy sandwiches from a wood-fired oven, were also very good. Order the Chicken Tinga over the Pepito, which is too spicy.

The ahogado is maybe the best sandwich ever. Pork and pickled onions on a crunchy baguette, served in a bowl of spicy tomato broth.  It is easily the best thing on the menu, and maybe the best sandwich I've ever had.  When doing take-out I've tried to get other sandwiches, but I'm never as happy so I now just plan on eating in so I can get the ahogada. The chocolate is made fresh from bean to finished product, and it's really wonderful in anything from a hot chocolate to a churros or ice cream topping. I've seen complaints that the chocolate is too strong, but I think that's because people are used to eating a lot of additive with their chocolate. This is fresh and pure, so there is a bit of a tart, berry flavor to it.  If you like real chocolate, I think you'll be very happy.  If you prefer milk chocolates, it might seem a bit strange to you. The carnitas salad is great too.  It didn't occur to me to order a salad at XOCO before, but this one is pretty spectacular. The pork is rich and deeply flavored, and the dressing and salad greens are light, fresh and a bit tart. They're the perfect complement to each other.  Now when I can tear myself away from the ahogado, I get this salad. And when I have room for dessert?  The soft serve is awesome!  It has the teeny tiniest hint of tartness to it.  Not anything as strong as tart froyo, just the smallest hint of tart, like there's a bit of buttermilk in it or something.  I have no idea what it is, but I really like it.  The baked goods and churros are great as well, but for the past few months I haven't been able to move away from the soft serve.  Come autumn, I'm sure I'll be back to churros though!",0.9982,0.716,0.239,0.044,0.57485754985755

It's nice to see a staff that  makes sure each customer was satisfied with the table he or she were sitting instead of urgently forcing people to sit anywhere. My group got a nice outside table in the front. The tables outside were long and narrow. We weren't allowed to sit facing each other because of pedestrians walking by. So, all four of us sat awkwardly in a line. It was kinda humorous because we looked like a munching spectacle. Every person that passed by would stare at us as we devour our delicious lunch.  Now the food was delicious. My friends and I started with the Guacamole & Chips ($5.75) which came with two salsas. One salsa looked like a green tomatillo salsa and the other salsa was a red/orange chile salsa. Each dip was delicious and the chips had a nice crunched to it.  Next we had our main dish. Three of us ordered Goat Barbacoa tortas ($12) which is a special that is served on Saturdays. The torta consist of braised goat with a special salsa, avocado, onions and cilantro. The ingredients were so simple but it was very flavorful. Also the bread that they use was nicely toasted and very crunchy. My other friend had the Pork Belly Vermicelli ($12). It's basically a bowl of beautiful red broth with vermicelli noodles and crispy pork belly, harmonized with chopped zucchini, mushrooms, onions, and avocados. I thought it was interesting that they would add avocados in the savory soup. My friend let me try the broth and it was nice to taste how these ingredients compliment each other. The broth was very delightful. At last, we ended our lovely lunch with some churros which I recommend getting with ice cream or hot chocolate. My friends and I were pretty full but we just ordered the churros without the ice cream and hot chocolate.  I'm giving this place four stars for the price being a little too high, but hey! I guess It's downtown Chicago, so I should expect it. Overall, I enjoyed my experience here since I'm fairly new to Chicagoland but I believe I would be coming here again in the near future.",0.9992,0.726,0.265,0.009,0.6082304173813609

On a trip to Chicago, my boyfriend and I were extremely excited to try one of Rick Bayless' three restaurants.  We are huge fans of his ever since he won Top Chef Masters.  We took a cab to Frontera Gril and were surprised to realize that all three of his Chicago restaurants are on the same block.  It was pretty early and we weren't quite sure if we wanted a full meal so we picked Xoco.  It was the least formal of the three and seemed like the best choice for brunch.   The concept of Xoco is more of Mexican street food, tortas, soups, desserts .  Yet another place popular place with a pretty long line, I was surprised that it moved pretty quick.  You line up, order and then waitress finds you a seat in this pretty bustling restaurant.  The menu was pretty large for a lunch place so we were overwhelmed with choices but decided on the following: Ahogada torta - rick bayless' take on a soup and sandwich...a pork carnitas sandwich cut in two nestled in a tomato broth soup..very spicy Jamon torta - one of the best sandwiches I have eaten, a panini style pressed sandwich with spicy prosciutto, sharp cheddar, avocado, black beans and a fried egg.  fresh guacamole with homemade chips and for dessert: Freshly made churros - warm, crunchy and chewy dusted with cinnamon and sugar with chocolate dipping sauce and mexican vanilla frozen yogurt for dipping. we were also intrigued with his choices of mexican hot chocolates. there were about  5 or 6 to choose from but we decided on his Classic hot chocolate.  It was perfectly warm, thick and creamy, rich and chocolately.  Hands down, THE best hot chocolate we have ever had.

The logistics of the place are a bit confusing, but the hostess quickly explained that you wait in line to order and pay, and are given a number in line, then are seated at that particular table and your food is brought to you. Sounds easy enough. I ordered the Woodland Mushroom Torta, and the Churros with chocolate for dipping (desserts get brought out later) and my husband ordered the Choriqueso Torta and Homemade Mexican Vanilla soft serve with the caramel sauce.  Water was free and easy to serve yourself, which I love. We were seated and our tortas came out in a reasonable amount of time. Mine was good but VERY messy to eat--slippery mushrooms and cheese everywhere. My husband enjoyed his as well and we were soon finished. Our plates were cleared and we sat, waiting on our desserts. We waited. And waited. My husband had to finally get up and ask somebody where they were. It appears they were forgotten, although no one said as much. They were brought out shortly after asking, but we must have been there for 20 minutes in between tortas and dessert.  The churros were good, although the chocolate was a bit strong and I think I would just get them plain in the future; I didn't do much dipping.

2011-07-10,5.0,XOCO is the real deal. It's the most authentic Mexican street food that you will find anywhere in the midwest. I've been several times and each time I am blown away.  I usually stick with the tortas and they have never failed me yet. From the Woodland Mushroom that has the most flavorful garlic mushrooms I've ever had to the Cubana topped with a fried egg (a MUST-HAVE) everything is delicious. For your friends who like to walk on the safer side tell them to go for the Milanesa or the Chicken tinga both very delicious but probably more easily appreciated for the less adventurous.  Make sure to add chips and guacamole or if you are one of the crazy people who don't like avocados try any of the salsas.  As a final warning DO NOT LEAVE without getting some of the authentic Mexican hot chocolate. My personal favorite are the Mexico city thick and the Aztec but I'm sure they are all delicious. Also if you feel that you especially deserve a treat then go for a churro cause they are great.  happy eating!,0.9932,0.712,0.249,0.039,0.617911877394636

My boyfriend and I arrived at the restaurant on a late Saturday afternoon before heading over to the Navy Pier. I was nervous upon arriving to the resturant because after reading many of the yelp reviews, I did not want to stand in line. However, to my surprise there was hardly a line and a hostess greeted us at the door and asked what I wanted to order. I told her I wanted some desserts to go and she led me to one of the cashiers who was very helpful in making additional decisions to my order of churros. I left happy with a bag of churros with the chocolate dipping sauce, an iced Mexican chocolate drink and my boyfriend got a Mexican vanilla ice cream with bacon and caramel bits. The churros: very fresh! warm, crunchy, not to sweet, good amount of cinnamon and sugar. It also tasted corn, like it was fried in the same oil they used to fry taco shells. But it was so good! the chocolate dipping sauce was very rich. not your typical chocolate sauce since it is a Mexican chocolate. It almost reminded me of a Filipino chocolate that i used to eat as a child. This Mexican chocolate was also in my iced cold drink that sweetened my sweet tooth. The ice cream: My boyfriend devoured this dish. The combination of bacon and caramel bits with the vanilla was so good! My tummy was very happy with all the deserts and the only disappointment I have is not actually eating non-dessert items on the menu. All the food looked so GOOD while the waiters passed me by with the dishes as I waited for my 'to go'.

2011-07-07,5.0,"So the wife and I took some time recently to take another step up the Rick Bayless ladder, having started with Frontera Fresco in Macy's a few months ago. At this rate, I'll be hitting up Frontera Grill and Topolobampo in no time. For now, since we didn't have time to do a 1 1/2 hour wait for the Grill, we decided to take on XOCO. The blow-by-blow follows: Iced chocolate -- the special of the summer... I think it's just cocoa powder boiled into water, steeped in peppermint grown on the roof, then poured over ice. The key is they use really good cocoa. It certainly had some texture to it, which was a plus in my book. Ahomado -- a pork sandwich served in its own broth. I got the distinct impression that at twice the price, this would have been mindbendingly good, but I'll take this $8 any day. The bread was toasted nicely, and I even tolerated the raw onions, because everything was spiced well. No stale ingredients or lazy presentation here. Top Chef Torta -- I honestly wondered why my wife got this, because it's lengua: beef tongue. Apparently, she didn't know that's what it was, so I benefitted a little bit. The chorizo gives it a big flavor kick, and it also comes with lettuce, tomatoes (I think) and its own green salsa. As usual, they toasted the bread just right. Excellent. Lemonade -- My wife got this and I've been making it at home since then. Fresh lemons, of course, but there's a twist of lime in it too. (I add hearty amounts of sugar.)   Churro with chocolate -- My wife described it as a cross between a donut and funnel cake. That sounds about right. Wonderfully sweet, balanced with cinnamon and served separately with Mexican (I presume... pretty safe since I've never tasted chocolate like this before) chocolate melted in a little cup.  Polvoron -- In the Philippines, or Daly City, California, depending on where you are, polvoron is a candy that's mostly flour, sometimes other ingredients (like chocolate powder or crackled rice) and butter. XOCO put the Goldlock's version to shame. Everything else I've ever had now reminds me of raw flour. XOCO toasts the flour and lightens up on the texture to ensure that you're not biting through something rock solid. Excellent. I loved this place, and really wished for something like it closer to home. Service was decent, and it wasn't all that busy at the time we went. We even got a brief view of Rick himself, probably just moving from kitchen to kitchen, so that was cool. Bring on Frontera Grill!",0.9952,0.815,0.149,0.035,0.5348181580324438

2011-07-05,5.0,"After seeing Chef Bayless on the Internet, on the shelves of numerous cookbook sections, and even on Top Chef Masters, it was no surprise that the Chicagoan connoisseur of Mexican cuisine had a multitude of thriving restaurants in the city; all of which seem to be household names in the Yelp universe. As with any restaurant under the ""professional chef franchise"", I had high expectations for Xoco. After having bad experiences with some of the more pretentious establishments in the restaurant business, I was looking for the place where the food spoke for itself without marketing the IDEA of dining there - and I am glad to say that without a doubt, Xoco met this criterion.  Walking into Xoco feels like entering a high class Chipotle: the line, the order-at-the-counter system, noise level, etc. But this is no fast food restaurant; after looking at the menu, any doubts I had about this place were repressed.  For the most part, the menu is divided into two large categories: tortas (sandwiches) and caldo (soup). I ordered the Pepito torta, which is short ribs braised into the consistency of butter along with sauteed onions and pepperjack cheese between two pieces of french bread. To drink, I had the Agua del Día, which is the Chef's pick for drink of the day, usually fruit juice (non-alcoholic). To top off the meal, a few churros with their thick dipping chocolate is mandatory.  The torta was incredible; the beef was tender and juicy and cooked to perfection. To compliment the torta, the Prickly Pear Agua del Día was refreshing and tangy. It was my ideal meal after walking ten blocks on a hot day to find the restaurant. The churro dessert is as fantastic as anyone can imagine; crunchy on the outside, fluffy and buttery on the inside, and dipped in the rich Mexican chocolate. It all slides down your throat in perfect, sublime harmony. Everything you could possibly want.  So there it is; Xoco is now one of my coveted gems worthy of five stars, thanks to my serendipitous first experience. A no BS place worth standing in line for.

The wait was not terribly long-- I went in with my sister and friend at lunch time and only stood in line for about 20 minutes. The hostess was very helpful and pointed out that there are two lines--one for take out orders and one for dine-in. The wait gave us enough time to decide what we wanted. The jamaica-lemongrass drink was AMAZING. I got the chicken tinga torta: gunthorp chicken, black beans, chipotle-roasted tomato sauce, pickled onions, avocado, queso anejo, arugula. It was good, but I felt like maybe the chicken could have been a bit more flavorful. The bread, although it was not a traditional torta bread, was crispy and yummy. I loved that they used arugula instead of lettuce because it gave the sandwich a yummy peppery taste. We also got guacamole and chips, the guac wasn't the best I've had in my life but it was by no means bad. The restaurant is very beautifully decorated and I love being able to see that giant oven and everyone working-- we saw Rick Bayless himself going through the kitchen doing quality control which was great to see that he actually cares about what his customers are eating.

My friend and I got to XOCO just around noon on a Tuesday afternoon and the place was definitely busy, but the line seemed to move fairly quickly.  We started with the guacamole appetizer. I should've carefully read the Yelp reviews about the guac order, because it was tiny!! The guac came in this little condiment dish along w 2 other tiny containers of salsa and a basket of chips. The guac was deelish- but come on, I've got all these great chips and hardly any guac to cover them.  For lunch, I went with the Milanesa Torta (breaded chicken w/ black beans, cheese, jalepenos and salsa). The torta was outstanding- very sizable, warm  and flavorful. I was getting full after eating the first half but couldn't stop myself from devouring the rest of the sandwhich.My friend went with the Chicken Tinga Torta which she seemed to enjoy. Both of us cleaned our plates! Finally, we couldn't visit XOCO without an order of churros and a side of chocolate for dipping. OMG! This was by far and way the best part of the meal. I'd go back just for the churros.  The atmosphere is very busy and a little cramped inside. This is not the kind of place where you go to have a long and relaxing lunch.

However, tortas and churros were calling, and I had to take the call.  Basically, the premise of this place is Mexican street food. Tortas, soups, guacamole, churros, hot chocolates and other goodies fill the menu. You walk in, and stand in line. I'm sure there's always a line. Our wait time was 30-45 minutes, which wasn't bad, being that we showed up at noon on a weekend.  I decided on the woodland mushroom torta, our group got the chips and salsa and we got churros with chocolate and homemade vanilla ice cream for dessert. We also got an iced chocolate with peppermint. Yes, we are gluttons.  The chips and salsa were great. There was a green, a red and a guacamole. The chips were the perfect thickness and saltiness, and all the salsas were perfectly flavored. I like a nice salsa.  My torta blew my fucking face off. Two pieces of crusty bread encasing (vegetarian) black beans, arugala, woodland mushrooms and goat cheese with a side of red salsa. This was all toasted in their wood fire oven. IT'S AS GOOD AS IT SOUNDS. Cheesy, crusty bread, perfectly cooked mushrooms - it was perfection on a plate.  Our churros for dessert were amazing. I highly recommend getting the homemade ice cream, although the chocolate dip was good as well. The churros themselves are hot and cinnamon-y, and so, so dreamy. Our iced chocolate (which was huge, we split it and still couldn't finish it) was super rich, a little bit spicy and had a dash of peppermint. So good on a warm day.  AND. AND. THEY HAVE SPARKLING WATER ON TAP. WHO DOES THAT?! RICK BAYLESS.  I highly recommend this place if you want to try Mr. Bayless' cuisine without making your wallet cry.

Gosh, when I think about this dish, I start to wax lyrical like an enthused judge on Top Chef.  Enamoured by Rick Bayless from Top Chef Masters, I've trekked down his restaurants in Chicago. Having been to all three Topolobampo, Fronterra Grill and XOCO, I've gotta say that XOCO is by far my favorite. Mexican Street Food at it's best! Chef Bayless, when are you opening a XOCO in NYC? For dessert, try the Churros. Amazing, tasty things coated in sugar and that je ne sais quoi. Best Churros I've ever tasted. Go for it. Get the 3 churros. You won't regret it.  I've been here twice. Once with a 30 minute wait, the second time with a 15 minute wait and we got to sit outside on a gorgeous Chicago day. It's well worth it! PS.

2011-06-16,5.0,"I saw XOCO featured on Food Network and I quickly added this to the Chicago agenda, I mean how can I not? I do love Mexican food! Okay, so we've got there at 1PM on a Friday and the wait didn't seem too bad at all, considering I've heard that wait time can be up to 3 hours. I think that most likely happens on weekends. So we've waited on line, ordered and paid for everything up front. They will give you a table number and then bring you to your designated table and all you need to do is wait for them to bring you your food. The place wasn't really spacious, so I see why the wait can be long. There are higher tables along the restaurant walls and then there are regular tables. For us, a party of 3 shared a table with another party of 3, which was totally fine with us. From the time we've arrived, to placing our order to getting seated it was only 30 minutes! Maybe we were lucky. Okay, so for drink I ordered the Papaya Mint Tea, which was sweet with taste of papaya. The drink was not think nor watery. I really like this drink a lot because it is very refreshing. To start we've gotten the churros with chocolate dip. And let me tell you, if you are from NYC and you've tried churros from the Mexican ladies at train stations and you thought those were good, then these will definitely blow you away! Wow, these churros at XOCO were sweet, crispy with a really nice crunch. However, after dipping them in chocolate, the churros tasted a bit bitter. I actually prefer them in it's natural state without the chocolate dip. My friend Ms. S gotten the Ahogada, which is golden pork carnitas, black beans torta in spicy arbol chile sauce tomato broth. The toasted bread was to perfection and the spicy broth was so damn good. And the pork carnita was so juicy and tender that they fall apart in your mouth with each bite.  And for my other friend, Ms. I, she's gotten the vegetables caldo, which was a big bowl of soup that has black beans, woodland mushrooms, zucchini, potato-masa dumplings, greens, avocado and serrano chile. I did not try hers, but she said it was okay. Her food didn't look as appealing as Ms. S and mine and the other people we had shared a table with. I felt bad for Ms. I because I realized this restaurant is not really vegetarian friendly. They don't have much options to choose from. While sitting there waiting for my food, I striked up a conversation with the family that was sitting with us. They were super friendly and nice. The daughter has been living in Chicago for 4 years and told me that she comes here as a regular and that sometimes she comes here just to buy churros to go. Her parents were here for the very first time too and they were liking their food a great deal. The father had ordered the Top Chef, which was created by Rick Bayless in Season 1 of Top Chef Masters and also it is the Friday special. The father was really enjoying his torta, which I really wished mine had came already. Not for long, mine finally came and I was excited to try. Took a bite and it was like fireworks in the air. The bread was again toasted to perfection and crunchy with every bite. The braised beef tongue and chorizo was full of flavor and very tender. The generous slabs of avocado made the torta rich and creamy. And adding the salsa verde to this delicious creation was literally love at first bite. Everything about this torta was amazing! Then to end the show, I've ordered the Homemade Mexican Vanilla Softserve, which was topped with maple pecan bacon streusel and drizzled with salted caramel sauce. I was so engaged in the conversation with the family we shared a table with that Ms. I (vegetarian) tried some of my ice cream. Ms. S and Ms. I thought the topping was brown sugar and kept eating until later on I informed them those were bacon. And the look on Ms. I's face was $@!#*%. I'm so sorry that had happened, but hey you didn't die from it and I bet you probably liked it haha (okay, if you do stumble upon this, please don't kill me). Any way, wow this ice cream was a pretty amazing deal. The creaminess of the ice cream went really well with the bacon and the salted caramel.

Churros: 5/5 -  I wish they would eliminate all of the food except the chips & guacamole and the churros.  The guac is stellar (no guac this time for me, but I have had it at Topolobampo in the past). Aztec: 2/5 - Too bitter and not enough sweet.  Also, staff needed to mix the drink before serving.  All of the spice as at the bottom of the cup.   Atmosphere: 4/5 - it is a cute, although small restaurant Bathroom: 4/5 - It takes up a lot of room.  But I am happy that they didn't have me go to the restaurant next door to use the bathroom.",0.7309,0.853,0.087,0.06,0.6118571428571429

Their soups are sort of hit or miss; the first one I had (forget which one, it was meat-centered, I just remember wanting the mushrooms) seemed a little one-dimensional on flavor, sort of like a saltier and less umami pho. But the all-veggie one was pretty solid. One other perk about this place is that, despite being jam-packed all the time, their service is actually pretty good.

After thinking for almost 20 minutes I settled on the pork Vermicelli with toasted noodles, mushrooms, zucchini, avocado and salsa.

This confused me further on what to get, but I stuck with my decision.  Once it was my turn to order, I asked the lady ringing me up. She suggested the same thing (half sammich half soup thing). I ended up going with that. It was the most therapeutic sandwich I have ever eaten. The tomato soup broth was amazing, the sandwich was amazing. The combo was earth shattering.

I am so glad I read reviews and made up my mind on ordering the pork belly vermicelli caldos. Man oh man did it hit the spot! I'm still craving it!! The pork belly surprisingly stayed crispy almost entirely through the whole time I was trying to devour it as it sat through the soup. I don't know how they do it! The ""vermicelli"" was something more like buckwheat noodles and not the typical white, thin noodles you would find in pho. It was cooked well and al dente. Awesome. I was a little surprised to see avocado in the soup! It worked well with the soup though. It was a very flavorful broth and you could definitely taste the freshness of the herbs and seasonings, although, it did get a little too salty for my taste towards the end of the bowl though. Omg, I wish I had a bowl right now! Sadness. The boyfriend got the Pibil torta, which was less amazing. The suckling pig was a little bland and didn't taste like any suckling pig I've ever had so that was a little disappointing. He also complained that the taste of the torta itself tasted overwhelmingly of cumin like someone dumped it in his sandwich. He figured out that the pickled onions tasted entirely of cumin and took that out, but even that didn't save his sandwich. The habanero salsa that came with the sandwich was SUPER spicy and we were forewarned by the waiter.

I've had the open-faced breakie torta with Poached Egg and slighty spicy tomato broth, the Chicken Tinga and Ahogada torta, guac and chips and to round out my xoco menu samplings the mexican hot cocoa and also the churro with vanilla bean ice cream, for dipping of course!  Might I add, this was not all in one sitting, but over a period of a few food binges.  HOT TIP: Like most Bayless establishments, this place is a hot commodity and gathers quite an audience. So....GET IN LINE EARLY! This place starts serving lunch at 11 AM so you want to ensure you have a seat, if dining in. Otherwise, call ahead and order, you'll save yourself a headache.

I'd wanted to try Xoco for awhile, so when some friends suggested it for meeting for lunch I was excited. The problem is, Xoco is just not a place for groups of people (I was with 6 others). We ended up having to do bar-type seating (there are regular tables too) and it was difficult to talk with everyone when you're sitting in a row.  Now the food, I had one of the tortas but I can't remember the name of it. Was it good? Yes! Was it amazing? No, I don't think so. I had a bite of churro and ice cream and that really was fantastic. Didn't try the mexican hot chocolate even though I've heard it's fab.  So, Xoco was good and deserves another chance.

My review isn't completely comprehensive, as we got the items to go. I did an extensive amount of research, so I decided to go during off-peak hours (anytime before 6pm) just to grab a couple of yummy snacks. Here's my individual ranking of everything we ate: Pepito Torta (5 stars) - The bread was perfectly crisp, although it was more reminiscent of a submarine sandwich, as opposed to your traditional torta. Nonetheless, the meat was incredibly tender and of high quality (braised tallgrass short ribs!), the onions added a great sweetness, and the jalapenos, black beans, and artisan jack cheese added a wonderfully spicy kick. I loved this sandwich! I would definitely get it again. Churros (5 stars) - XOCO is known for these! These were the fluffiest, lightest, and most delectable churros I've ever had the chance to consume. Perfectly dusted with sugar and tiny specks of cinnamon for a powerfully sweet experience! They came with chocolate sauce for dipping, but I actually preferred them plain because the chocolate was way too rich for my taste. Fresh guacamole, salsa, and chips (3 stars) - Underwhelming. Do yourself a favor and just pick up some Bayless salsas in the Frontera jars at any grocery store in Chicago. Pretty much the same thing. Nothing special at all. Hot Chocolate (3 stars) - Overhyped. Waaaaay too sweet and rich for my taste. You could really taste the cacao beans, which reminded me of coffee, but was unbelievably strong for my liking.  Because the latter two items were not that great...I am ranking this place 4 stars. Frontera Grill is still waaaay better, but this is still definitely a restaurant not to be missed if you are in Chicago! The churros are beyond amazing!",0.9975,0.764,0.231,0.004,0.5425702075702076

The proprietor of Xoco is Chicago's Mexico food guru Rick Bayless who also owns Topolobambo and Frontea Grill. The theme of Xoco is Mexico street food elevated. The restaurant is not very big and has a casual dining atmosphere. My wife and I arrived at about 11:30am and by noon, the line was out the door. The popularity of the restaurant was evident. The wait staff were friendly and efficient. We ordered the following: - a. Shortrib Red Chile Soup (braised tallgrass shortribs, red chile broth, roasted vegetables, epazote, wild arugula, lime). b. Pork Belly Vermicelli (crispy-tender pork belly, toasty-tender noodles, woodland mushrooms, zucchini, avocado, salsa negra). c. Pibil (wood-roasted suckling pig with achiote, black beans, pickled onion, habanero salsa). d. Mocha Tres Leches Cake as a desert. d. Aztec chocolate (chile, all spice) as beverage.  The shortrib red chile soup came in a red hot broths. I thought it was going to be very spicy. Surprisingly it was relatively mild. It had very good favor and the short rib was very tender. I only wished there was more short rib in the bowl. The pork belly vermicelli was actually a little more spicier than the shortrib red chile soup. The pork belly was both crispy and tender. Personally, I felt that the soup was a little sweet for my taste, but my wife loved it. The Pibil was excellent. The bread was toasted, but not overly crispy. The pork was tender. The wait staff was very considerate by putting the habanero salsa on the side, as it was really quite hot. We both like the Mocha Tres Leches cake very much. It was very light, airy and moderately sweet, topped with a generous supply of flame-torched whipped cream.  The Aztec chocolate was very thick with an intense favor. It had a texture of runny melted chocolate. All in all, we had a very nice dining experience and I would not hesitate to go back again.",0.9946,0.844,0.156,0.0,0.4535468697968698

Yes, the wait is long (we were told it would be 30-45 minutes just to order our food) so be prepared. Once you order at the front register, which is where the line leads you to, you are seated in the dining area where you'll wait 5-10 minutes for your food.  I read from other Yelpers that the limeade drink was good so I had to get that. Caveat: it is SO darn sweet! Too sweet! I could only drink a 1/4 of it but maybe that's b/c I'm not a soft-drink drinker. I'm glad they at least had sparkling water on tap at the self-serve water station. I had to get a glass of that to wash down the sweetness of my drink. I had a feeling that the guacamole would be great so I had to order that. And it was! It tasted so fresh, creamy, and rich. I like that they served up a small portion of that alongside two smaller portions of a red salsa (a bit spicy) and a green salsa (more on the mild side). Also, the chips, they were delish! It was obvious that they were house-made. They had the perfect crispiness to them and the coarse salt on them complemented the chip perfectly. I liked that the portion sizes of the chips, salsas, and guacamole were small. It was perfect for someone like me who typically gorges on them leaving not much room for the meal once it arrives. Not the case this time, thank goodness! Now onto the entree... I ordered the Chicken Tinga torta. The ingredients tasted so fresh and the torta bread was incredible. It was cripsy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. It kinda reminded me more of a baguette than a torta bread roll. Overall I'd say this sandwich was good but not incredible enough to have me wait in a 45 minute line. My sister ordered the Woodland Mushroom torta. I thought the goat cheese was a nice compliment to it. I thought it was good. She thought it was ok. For dessert we got the ""must have"" Churros with a side of chocolate sauce. These were incredible! I could have ate a dozen of them! The wait staff, especially the hostess, were friendly and helpful.

So it was unclear how to find our table. But I'm gifted in the brains department, so I figured out I could ask a Xoco employee. Yep, that worked. Seated!

Twice they tried to serve us food that belonged to a different table. --You pay at the counter, like you do when you buy coffee at Starbucks. That's cool.

I imagine if we went at peak hours it wouldn't be confusing, it would be clear--just follow the long line!!! There was none to follow, only until the host popped-up later. It would've been nice if they have a little sign here to give directions: get in line, wait for table number, then order.

It's always a no-brainer for me if either pozole or cubana is on the menu, but when they are both there, I'll be in trouble.  Chicken pozole was the chosen one. It (green pozole) was hearty and comfort-foody, its broth was definitely intense and complex (roasted poblano again). Chicken was tender, though interestingly, they were cubes not shredded. It'd be nice if the usual lettuce/radishes/cilantro/dried oregano accompaniments are DIY instead of in the bowl already. No tortilla chips was a bit disappointing.

However, I commend the staff for putting an ordering and seating system in place that was very efficient and quick considering the large crowd. If you want to send a friend to ""save a table"" while you order, it ain't happening!  So everything on the menu looked appetizing, but I decided to go with the Ahogada, a sandwich containing carnitas, black bean, and pickled onions served in a bowl with a spicy tomato chile broth. Think of it as a Mexican version of the French dip sandwich. For dessert I went with the highly touted churros with chocolate sauce.  After waiting for a while, I was seated along a wall mounted ledge right next to some other diners. Needless to say the seating was cramped, but this was no surprise. After waiting for some time, my sandwich came and I was excited to dig in. The Ahogada is served cut in half with the cut sides down in the broth. I went in for my first bite and was shocked at how salty it was. I love salt, I throw salt on everything, but this broth was inedible and overpowered the otherwise delicious flavor of the sandwich itself.  Honestly, it was as if they used reduced water from the Dead Sea to make this broth. I ate the rest of the sandwich that wasn't already dipped, and left the rest of the salty liquid alone. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed and considered it a waste of $10 that I would have rather spent at Panera... sad but true. As a consolation prize, the churros and chocolate sauce were phenomenal and helped to get rid of the bad taste in my mouth. I know the staff puts a lot of painstaking effort to deliver a spin on Mexican street food.

Last weekend Alisha and I were downtown for our anniversary and got to have lunch at Xoco in the River North neighborhood of Chicago.  The food is a nod to Mexican street food.  If Topolo pampers and Frontera dances, then XOCO rocks. Though the word is Mexican slang for ""little sister"" (from the ancient Aztec language), there's nothing little about XOCO's big, bold Mexican marketplace flavors. Open early, late and closed on Sundays and Mondays, this quick-service cafe from Rick and Deann Bayless proffers contemporary expressions of Mexico's most beloved street food and snacks: hot-from-the-fryer churros and flaky empanadas; frothy Mexican hot chocolate (ground from Mexican cacao beans right in our front window!); warm, crusty tortas (Mexican submarine sandwiches); and made-to-order caldos (meal-in-a-bowl soups) that feature everything from roasted vegetables to seafood to pork belly. We got there early for lunch (about 10:50 am, they start to serve lunch at 11:00 am) which ended up being a good thing.  By 11 there was a like almost out the door. The restaurant is set up like a fast casual restaurant where you order up front and your food in brought to you. The service was fast and polite. No complaints. I decided on the special of the day 'Goat Barbacoa: Oaxacan pasilla-tomato salsa, avocado, onions and cilantro' and Alisha got the 'Chicken Tinga: Gunthorp chicken, black beans, chipotle-roasted tomato sauce, pickled onions, avocado, queso anejo, arugula.'  Both were priced around $10. We also ordered the 'Guacamole & Chips: Frontera guacamole, tomatillo salsa 3-chile salsa, just-made chips' and the bean-to-cup 'Aztec: fresh-ground chocolate + water + chile + allspice.'   The tortas were really amazing.  The goat was tender, extremely flavorful and not gamy at all. The avocado and pasilla-tomato salsa was tangy and tart. Probibly in the top 3 best sandwiches I've ever had.  The chicken was great as well. I rarely order chicken in a sandwich because I feel like they ofter fall short on flavor, not this one. It was like a party in your mouth (yep I said that).  The bean-to-cup Aztec was like nothing I've ever eaten. It wasn't sweet (almost at all) but had insane depth of flavor. It was bitter, acidic, creamy and spicy.  Their bean-to-cup menu is something everyone should try. The only disappointment I had was that I didn't try any of the soups.  They looked so good! There's always next time though. Overall, I couldn't have been more happy with my visit to Xoco.  It's on my short list of 'must try' casual food spots in Chicago.

First of all, the times that I have been here, the lines were really long - I'm impatient - I live here, I have things to do, so when I want to get a good meal, I also want it to be efficient.  I could see if I were vacationing here and had some time, but I'm not, so it's not worth my time.

As for the staff - they seemed a bit disorganized.  They weren't very helpful in directing us to the correct line and explaining how the restaurant worked.

It also was hard to catch their attention when we did want them to fire our dessert.

The Environment:  Don't be discouraged if you see a line ... the host ensures that there is a seat reserved for you at the time that you order at the counter.  They put your seat number on your ticket and the servers know exactly where to bring your food.  Very efficient. I loved that the 'still' and 'sparkling' water was available 'on tap'.  I wished I'd been hungry enough to get the soft serve ice cream with the wonderful variety of toppings, or a churro, or a fruit crisp...  There is plenty of bar type seating along the walls & windows and a handful of tables for larger groups.  Brightly colored and extremely pleasant servers make this an excellent stop for a meal.  Judging by the comments of others in line around me - this appeared to be a regular stop for many.

The flavors are simple, but that's the point. The bread is fantastic! The proscuitto option has a salty sweetness to it and doesn't taste like you would expect, but it is still good. As for the hot chocolate - order one and drink it while you wait in line. My personal favorite is the almond milk hot chocolate, my dad swears by the espresso variety. If it doesn't taste thick & rich, send it right back. They will happily make a fresh one for you. Service/Atmosphere: Once you make it through the line (and let me tell you, there WILL be a line) the food comes out fairly quickly. My advice is to order it to go. There isn't much seating and it is a tad chaotic inside. I also feel like the to-go service is a tad quicker. As for the line, as long as it isn't down the block you should be ok (from my experience, it's about a 30 - 40 min wait if the line is just out the door.)

Everything is locally sourced and there is some fabulously funky artwork on the walls.  The ordering system might be a bit strange, but it's beyond effective. You put your number of guests in to the host, are given a menu and then stand on line. Once at the counter, you place your own order, but can't do so until you're given a table number. When that happens and the order is placed, you are taken to a space in the cafe-like seating area - a space that one would think is open seating. However, the sheer volume of people coming in and out necessitated some sort of structure, which I have to say was expertly executed by the brisk, pleasant manager who resembled a brunette Stephen Merchant. Food was utterly fabulous. The salsas were smoky and had incredibly deep flavor, homemade tortilla chips had a subtle peppery flavor. I went for the Seafood Caldo - a spicy light broth with gigantic shrimp and generous chunks of fish. The Tortas were incredible, and I managed to steal a bite of the Pibli torta - a glorious mixture of beans, pork, thick crusty bread and some eye-watering habenero salsa.

2011-02-24,5.0,"First and Foremost, It's pretty impressive how this place defies everything I was ever taught about supply and demand.  High Demand for anything with the Bayless tag attached to it is inevitable in Chicago... well, anywhere really. Yet, they're still able to supply high quality food at more than reasonable prices and at a *relatively* lighting speed.  Be grateful if you arrive and don't see a line forming out the door and down the block, but please, remember to be graceful if you do. With the high quantities of food and people they serve here, they *could* run it like the soup Nazi and pay no mind to you as a human being, but they don't. They've got a sort of ""maitre d"" in place to make things run smoothly and greet everyone with open arms (even if the place is too packed to even open your arms) while they wait. This person will explain the ordering process, let you know when it's your turn, and find you somewhere to sit so you don't have to feel awkward holding your food with no where to eat it.  The space is small, almost cramped, but you're so happy to be there and be able to dine (and dine well) at a fraction of the Topolobampo and Frontera prices that none of that will matter. And once you're sitting and your food is in front of you, you'll forget that there ever was a wait. In fact, you'll forget about all your worries once you take your first bite. The Seafood soup was fantastic and certainly not lacking in the seafood and the mushroom torta was a great pick as well, though I'm normally not a super fan of bread that feels crusty. My BF enjoyed his meaty meal and I took a sammy home for my Bayless loving Daddio, as well. I believe all parties enjoyed their share and the BF and I would gladly wait in line again.

I never should have feared; Rick Bayless gave this California girl some of the best Mexican food she's ever had, and it was 100% veggie, with no ""hmm...I just won't ask if there's lard in the beans"" moments. There was about a ten-minute wait, which was no biggie, and the food came out so quickly that I barely remembered the initial hold-up. Servers were attentive but not hovering, despite the shortage of tables, and we were seated as quickly as one became available. Rick himself was behind the counter tasting the beans, and he said hi to everyone in line and walked around asking how people were enjoying the food! The woman at the counter who took my order asked if I'm a vegetarian, because they have special veggie beans-- thanks, counter lady! I had the wild mushroom torta and JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR was it amazing! The bread! The bread ALONE was worth the price of the sandwich. Add to that goat cheese, perfectly cooked wild mushrooms, vegetarian beans, arugula, and the most delicious salsa for dipping...there are no words. My dining companion had the seafood caldo, which he reported was the perfect level of spicy (you get to choose the spice quotient) and I could see was chock-full of oceanic delicacies.  Churros for dessert-- mmm. The people who call them tough have clearly never had traditional churros; maybe they're thinking of the glorified tubular donuts at Costco? I had the Mexico City-style hot chocolate for dipping, which was beautifully authentic and chewably thick. Mmmmm. My friend had the spicy one, which he says was pretty much a cup full of throat-coating deliciousness.  I wasn't paying, so I didn't pay much attention to prices, but it seemed eminently reasonable for the quality of the food.

2011-02-21,4.0,"This place is unique and fabulous, hands down. I am a lover of sandwiches, but sometimes have a hard time finding one that really stands out since there are so many great sandwich places in Chi-town.  But, this one did it for me.   I came here for lunch and as expected, it was PACKED, with a line out the door.  We probably waited about 40 minutes, but it was well worth it.  I ordered a sandwich with pulled pork and the pork was one of the most tender, juicy and flavorful pork's I have ever tasted.  It came on wheat bread which was soft, chewy and delicious, and although I am forgetting exactly what else was on my pork sandwich, it doesn't matter because it was something fabulously tasty and you couldn't go wrong with this selection.  My mom had a sandwich with chicken which was also superb, and my dad had a cream of squash soup along with a sandwich made as vegetarian friendly as you could get.  What I mean by this is, the only downfall of this place is the lack of truly vegetarian options.  There is one dinner bowl that is vegetarian but not available for lunch, and many other things although they don't contain a slab of actual meat, we found have been cooked with meat.  This was a little frustrating and disappointing mainly for my Dad, but the quality and tastiness of the food could not be questioned. I am all for communal seating and meeting the people next to you, and it worked out great here, although always packed they did have a good system of ensuring that no one is left standing with no table after waiting 40 minutes in line to order your meal.  It is a little small though and I personally feel it would be a good idea to expand to have more seating, but hey, that's just me. The Mexican-style spicy hot chocolate was rich and delicious, a perfect end to an almost perfect meal.  Next time I will leave room for the churros that everyone raves about, I just couldn't do it this time.",0.9966,0.756,0.195,0.049,0.5808462532299742

2011-02-20,4.0,"Xoco is definitely worth a visit -- or twenty, as my neighboring diner was quick to note how many times he'd visited the Mexican street food restaurant since it opened. I ordered a chicken milanesa torta with crispy chicken, black beans, cheese, jalapenos, and salsa. But the food runner accidentally gave me the ahogada torta after some confusion over the table numbers. The ahogada, in fact, belonged to my loyal neighbor. I bit into the ahogada before the mistake was realized -- and was rather thankful I did. The torta, halved and wading in a tomato broth with cilantro, consisted of tasty dark pork carnitas and crunchy pickled onions wedged between two thick, slightly crusty pieces of bread, which sopped up the (too) salty broth. A single, made-on-site churro with a generous side of dark chocolate dipping sauce complemented my carnivorously savory meal. And to top it off, the gracious food runner gave me my original order, at no extra charge, in a to-go bag. Dining alone on a late Friday afternoon meant -- hooray! -- no wait. A previous attempt at Xoco on a Saturday afternoon was unsuccessful because my three dining companions were not inclined to stand around for 45 minutes. Excellent food, zero wait time, friendly service. Now if only Xoco could improve the process of assigned seating and food ordering. After stepping inside, confusion awaits as first-timers don't know whether to talk to the hostess, who is set off to the side, and grab a menu or walk straight ahead to the line and order.",0.9678,0.797,0.139,0.064,0.49724025974025976

My girlfriend and I ate at Xoco on a Wednesday night before a Broadway show. We arrived at approximately 6 PM and our show started at 7:30 PM. Do you think we made it to our show? Stay tuned to find out. As soon as we stepped into the restaurant we were greeted by a very friendly staff. It was our first time, so the gentleman talked to us about specialties and fan favorites. He also asked if we'd like something to drink or snack on while waiting in line to place our order. We took our time looking at a very descriptive menu and wound up ordering the Woodland Mushroom torta [for her], pork belly torta aka the Wednesday special [for him], a trio of churros with the chocolate dipping sauce, and the Mexico City/champurrado chocolate. The tortas. WHOA. Que FREAKIN' bueno. Let's start with the bread. It's fresh. Crunchy. Flavorful. The pork belly [which I am used to being deep fried] was so delicate, tasty. The bacon, well, it's bacon! The arugula, aged cheese, and the salsa glaze work together like Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, and [insert third Bulls player from the Repeat-the-Three-peat era]. And from what I hear from the girlfriend, the Woodland Mushroom didn't disappoint, either [PS It's completely vegetarian!!]. The churros. Really, Rick? REALLY??! They taste like they look, A-MAZ-ING. A generous coat of sugar and seasoning with a side of some chocolate sauce. To round out the meal, we had the champurrado. It was, ahem, thick and chocolatey. I liked it. Didn't love it. But the girlfriend definitely enjoyed the drink. We were interested in a couple other drinks and plan to try them at another time. If you've gotten this far, it's safe to say we enjoyed ourselves a lot. Xoco is worth the wait, money, hype, and everything else. I mean, who would've thought that the master of Mexican street food was from Oklahoma? Oh, yeah. We made it to our show with twenty minutes to spare. Yep.

You don't usually get the type of ingredients that they put into their sandwiches, so as long as you can appreciate it. On the other hand I'm sure there are plenty of people who would say I don't get the hype or I could just get a deli sandwich or $5 footlong - why bother for a sandwich. So, I'd say know what you're getting into. A tasty $9-$10 sandwich with unique flavors. The churros are also great, but again there will be some saying it's a churro. While I agree, it was probably the best churro I've had to date. For me, I really like the place, definitely think it's worth it (especially considering the premium you have to pay for either Frontera or Topolobampo) and will definitely be back. Be prepared for a wait if it's during meal times and you have to get a table before you can order your food, which is a little weird.

I ordered the pepito and the hot chocolate listed at the end of the menu (it was the thick one?)  My friend ordered the Alhogado sandwich and the Aztec hot chocolate.  I LOVED my hot chocolate, it was thick as promised and it tasted the way I thought hot chocolate should taste!  Thick, luxorious, and oh so chocolately.  Seriously, the wait was worth this hot chocolate.  My sandwhich was good, the meat was tender and juicy  but without the green sauce it would have been a bit on the dry side.  I really like my friend's Alhogada sandwich, it came served with each end sticking down in this tomato broth which is more my style since I love soupy stuff!  The sandwiches here are a bit more pricey than the ones that you would find in another sandwich shop, but hey these are gourmet sandwiches and I feel like the price tag is reasonable.  I also picked the most expensive sandwich so ;)   There was so much on the menu that looked so delicious, I really can't wait to come back here and get a different sandwich and try a new hot chocolate flavor.  I also wanted to try their churros and soft serve but that will have to wait for my next visit!",0.997,0.805,0.17,0.025,0.5888583035322167
2011-01-28,4.0,"Having spent a majority of my life in southern California, I tend to be an ardent critic of any attempt at mexican food, street vendor or otherwise, and I brought the same unsettled contempt to the Bayless restaurant. Mexican food can only be successfully devised in states bordering our friends to the south, right? Bayless is...  good, too good. He has been able to effectively differentiate three adjacent mexican venues via unique layout, menu offering, and service / pricing. Xoco is the lower end of Rick's portfolio, however by virtue of the food quality and preparation, would be toward the higher end under any other chef.  The food is decidedly more mainland Mexico and could even be argued as more central american, however I found this departure from the norm refreshing. The ahogada was ridiculous, the best torta I have experienced and surely at the price levied for the treat. On my second occasion I ordered a torta and splurged for the spicy salsa (forgot the name). Big mistake, the cursory warnings are not overselling themselves. Profuse sweating and abated inner cursing ensued while I attempted to temper the delectable taste against the culminating inferno brewing in my mouth. Notwithstanding my inability to put faith in restaurant warnings, the relatively limited menu has allowed Bayless to focus on a select  array of items that are exceptionally good, fresh, and well prepared. The beer selection was also refreshing, with local microbrew and a few stalwart mexican brands at hand. The venue is cramped, but I suppose that is part of the deal. Both times my party shared a table with another group, which was fine with the exception of the aforementioned salsa incident which undoubtedly manifested in a slightly uncomfortable experience for our unknown table guests. The spot is popular, so it is advised to either a.) show up off hours, or b.) show up at peak hours and partake in a few preemptive pints while waiting in line. My one complaint is the chips, they are underwhelming in comparison to the guacamole, salsa, and most everything else on the menu.

Xoco is a much more casual place than Rick's other restaurants, but the food is just as delicious and the flavors just as well developed.

Very, very good guacamole! -Suckling pig and pickled onion sandwich on a crusty, warm loaf of bread. Came with a habanero sauce. The meat was juicy and tender. The pickled onions were a really nice balance for the sandwich. Be careful with the sauce, though, it's actual habanero. It was pretty hot for my Danish tastebuds. With just a touch of sauce, it really rounds out the sandwich with a nice floral pepper taste.  -My girlfriend and I split an order of churros and 2 hot chocolates (the almond milk hot chocolate and Mexican City thick). Churros were crisp, sweet, and spicy. Splurge for the chocolate dipping sauce. The almond milk chocolate was tremendous and rich. The Mexican City Thick is almost thick enough to chew.

And after the meal, our guests never seem to complain. :] Besides that, the food is of course phenomenal ... most of the time. Occasionally it's less so - for example, the first time I had the ahogada (my sister ordered it) it was amazing, the next time I ordered it it was more bland and seemed rushed.  Also, personally, I'd recommend the woodburning oven tortas over the grilled ones, unless you really want a panini with salsa on it. The churros are ALWAYS good, and the chocolate is an experience you shouldn't miss. There are different types (some with milk, some with water, some spicy, some not) for different tastes, but the flavor and texture has never disappointed. Also, the soft serve for dipping churros in is a fabulous idea. Do it.

You can tell el empresario saw an under-utilized utility closet and coat room section in Topolobombo which turned into visions of dollar signs. (Like the sweaters I wore in my early-twenties, it's a tight and awkward fit, and it seems a little forced). 3. You may end up waiting in line for a little while ... outside, but it's really not that much worse than being inside; outside you can still get drinks, it's a lot less cramped, and it's roughly just as pleasant to look at.  4. The food is good and worth the wait. 5. The churros gave me the most delicious and heaven sent hyper-glycemia-induced diabetic shock i've ever experienced; I had seizures of bliss, the onslaught of blindness and potential to lose my foot was well worth it. Thoroughly recommended. 6. Try and get what the guy next to you got because it's gonna look better than what you ordered, especially if what you ordered was a sandwich. Of course, the whole order first -- then sit -- thing makes this impossible on your first visit, so just make a mental note of your neighbors meal for next time. 7. There's a distinct possibility that you could be placed at a small counter... in front of a wall... in a hallway to eat your meal which cost $50 for two. (Yes, apparently the coat room at Topolombombo that el empresario saw as dollar signs has a hallway in it). But don't worry, they put coat hooks right in front of where your legs go, that way you don't have to block the hallway with your big puffy coat -- because it is the middle of December and your gonna want to take it off, plus it's easier to talk to the person next to you if you hang your legs off the side of the chair anyway ... see. But, you could also be put somewhere else, with tables and chairs, or maybe windows. 8. It's only a little on the pricey side, and only a little over-hyped.

My friend had the Aztec version, sweeter, with milk and some allspice and chile. Very nice. We split a couple of tortas--the Gunthorp chicken and the Milenesa. I preferred the crusty bolillo style roll of the chicken as opposed to the panini-like bread for the Milenasa. All the ingredients were tasty (and I appreciate that they are thoughtfully sourced), but to this palate the tortas suffered from flavor/ingredient overload. I couldn't really taste the Gunthorp chicken for example, even though there was plenty of it, as the sandwich was over-liberally doused with salsa roja (redundantly served as a side as well.)  And though I love grilled onions and avocado, which are also on the sandwich, it was just...too much at once.

It was my first time, and there were many many choices, so I was glad that the waitress behind the register was happy to offer suggestions.

I got it without jalapenos and it lived up to cheesy. Basically its a hot, wondeful, gooey, cheesy and slightly tangy chicken breast that has been breaded in pano and lightly fried. Served with a thin tomatillo sauce for dipping, this was a sandwich I couldn't resist. I wanted to stop eating it, but could not.

So I finally made my way over to XOCO, on a weekday and at an off-peak hour.  There's no way I'm waiting in any line out the door unless someone is handing out something incredible for free, and XOCO surely is not. The first thing that's glaring about XOCO, with its Clark Street address, is that the entrance is actually on the side on Illinois.  I imagine sheep slaughterhouses don't allow the sheep to waltz into the front door either.  So I walked past Topolobampo/Frontera and the XOCO store front and was shunted to the one-door side entrance to XOCO.  Curious.   I opened the door, fearing that I would hear the sounds you'd imagine when reading Sinclair's ""The Jungle,"" but instead I walked into quite the fiesta as far as the music was concerned.  It was like walking into the upstairs of Rockit or any Four Corners bar, except the music was salsa.   I ordered a pork/bacon panini (let's face it, that's what it is), chips and salsa and an iced tea.  Eighteen bucks.  I say again.  Eighteen bucks.  I must be high.  But I'm most assuredly not.  Baa!! Even though there was no line, it still took about 10 minutes for my panini to be delivered to my table.  I can't imagine the wait if this place were hopping.   First, I would recommend skipping the chips and salsa.  The salsa is presented in very shallow dishes such that you can only get a dearth of salsa on one tiny triangle tip of your chip.  XOCO, I want to dip the chip.  Then, I want to take a bite.  Then, I want to dip the chip again.  So make your salsa containers deeper.  Okay? As to the panini, I got the Cubana, which was what I would describe as just alright.  It tasted more like cheese than anything else.  Was it worth 11 bucks?  Absolutely not.   The standout of the meal was the iced tea.  They did this up right.  Strong black iced tea, and a free refill to boot.   As to the too many men on the ice penalty, that was given because there is an over saturation of employees wandering around on the floor of the restaurant.  There were maybe a dozen patrons in the restaurant, and still I brushed shoulders with XOCO skaters.  I couldn't imagine this place if it were filled with patrons.   The last thing I'll mention is the 12 dollar soup.  Yes, it sounds really, really tasty, but for that price?  I've been in some decent sit down restaurants in this city, and I have never, ever seen a 12 dollar soup.  I wanted to try it badly, but I just couldn't make a silly fool out of myself for paying that much for a bowl of soup.  Somewhere, some folks are laughing their asses off at people paying this much for soup. Would I return to XOCO?  Eh, maybe.  Will I?  Perhaps.  I think I would just as soon go to Frontera Fresco, where you can get the same food for lower prices and without the potential zoo effect.   Three stars.",0.9825,0.846,0.103,0.051,0.5458160358160358

Now the Bean Hot Chocolate...OMG!  Fresh is just amazing!  It is unlike any hot chocolate you've ever had.  It's like an entirely different taste, but something about it makes love with your tongue :D  This is a drink only for those prepared to taste what REAL Chocolate tastes like.  It's more bitter and less sugary, which is the opposite of store-bought chocolate mix.  You have been Warned! :D :D Dunno if I'll go there again without another opinion.  That chicken was just a disappointment.  Should've stuck with the veggie options.

I had the ""meal-in-a-bowl"" wood-roasted chicken pozole caldo, a dish that really resonated with me, a Vietnamese who eats noodle soup as a meal often.  The broth is simple but flavorful, the crunchy garnishes are very fresh and made of good quality ingredients.  It is a comforting choice for the famous windy city. Recommended by a lady sitting next to us, I went back to the counter and waited in line to order the churros, paired with hot chocolate that is made from fresh-roasted cacao beans on the premises (you can smell the cacao from the streets).  It was a decision I'm thankful I made.  My favorite Mexican dessert has been flan up to then.  Now I also include churros and chocolate from Xoco.

At that point just make it table service.  My BF got the short rib sandwich...wow was that good! Tender, juice and exploding with spicy flavor. I got a chicken soup that was flavorful and spicy but was sparse on the chicken. I loved that I was able to order my soup mild, medium or spicy hot.  The chips and salsa were excellent.

There was a line when I got there but it was actually moving along pretty smoothly.  While in line I got to look at some of Rick Bayless' books that he set up on some shelves as you walk to the counter to order your food.  As i kept walking to the register there were nice chalk boards up that displayed where they got their food and i was pleased to see that they get their meats, dairy and other farm products local. always a plus for me! supporting the local businesses! When we got to the counter the server there asked how many we were and was getting a table ready for us while we were ordering our food. I ordered the pepito which had Braised Tallgrass shortribs, caramelized onion, artisan Jack cheese, black beans, pickled jalapenos all for the price of 12 dollars.  Just looking at these ingredients makes my stomach hungry.  The torta itself was cooked in the oven burning stove which made the bread extra tasty.  The short ribs were cooked to perfection, very tender and very moist. At first I thought the portions were small but after finishing 1/2 of the torta i was already feeling the impact of the short ribs.  I also ordered their chips and guacamole.  The chips were nice and crispy and they were also thick, i usually like thicker chips if i were to dip it in some guacamole so that was a + in my book.  the guacamole was very flavorful but nothing stood out for me to say that this is the best guacamole ever. But the dessert here is why i truly came here.  I am a huge fan of Churros and have been craving this sweet snack for the longest.  It is 3 pieces of churros for 3 dollars and 1 for $1.50 so the 3 is worth the deal.  I also got it with a nice small serving of soft serve to dip my churros into.  They delivered my churros perfectly right after i had finished my entree.  They came back later to give my friend his churros and the server dropped a churro on my jacket and made it rain churro all over my arm.  I wasnt mad because this churro was made in heaven! way better than any carnival or amusement park churro to date.  The soft serve was a great compliment to the churro as i dipped every bite.

Gourmet tortas!  Whats not to love?  And where else can you say youve had  a toasted torta via a woodburning oven or even griddle?  I went with a group of friends so I practically had four different tortas.  The Pepito was packed with tallgrass shortribs.  The suckling pig was accompanied with quite the heat from the habanero on the Cochinita Pibil.  The Milanesa was probably better than it seemed at the time..only because it was griddle.  After having 3 tortas wood oven toasted it just didnt seem as good.  Wood burning oven is definitely the way to go.  I myself ordered the Ahogada.  Pork carnitas wading in tomato arbol chile.  Makes me want to keep a jar of pickled onions in my fridge.   But I have to say my main attraction has to be the churros.  ""as good as"" thee best churros you will ever have in your life!  A mexican favorite brought to you by the culinary inspirations of a white guy.  A friend lured me by mentioning its like these churros are sprinkled with crack cocaine.  I couldnt imagine a better way to describe it than that.  3 churros for $3!  You have to get at least 3 or else you will regret it.   And it is a must to accompany these with their fresh, home made soft serve.  $2 for a cup to dip but I think I will go with the full size for $4.25 next time.  You wont have to worry about running out to dip and you could enjoy the soft serve by itself as well.  Unless youre a conservative dipper then your fine with the small cup.   You could possibly be thinking that how could I order a meal such as a torta and a dessert like a churro and eat it all together at the same time?  Well not to fret my pet.  You merely let the kitchen know when you are ready for dessert and they will have it out fresh for you.  Or their wait staff seems completely ontop of things that they check in on you anyhow.",0.9976,0.777,0.19,0.033,0.45876068376068374

Months later I have returned, and the quality of food has definitely not changed...if anything its gotten better! My first time there I had the pleasure of having not 1, but 2 tortas! I opted for the Ahogada and the Pepito. The Ahogada is definitely one of my favorites, if not THE favorite at Xoco. It is served in a bowl which the torta comes in, halved and stood upright. Consisting of pork carnitas, black beans, a tomato broth and spicy arbol chile sauce, you are in for a treat. Trust me when I say, you will be repeatedly dipping in this sauce! You have the option of getting it to taste (i.e. mild, spicy, super spicy), I got it very spicy =).  The Pepito is easily my 2nd favorite here at Xoco, but then again I have yet to sample the rest of the special menu during the week.  The Pepitos protein comes in the form of braised Tallgrass shortribs, caramelized onions, artisan Jack, black beans and pickled jalapenos. If that following rundown of accoutrement didnt get your mouth salivating, I dont know what will! Im glad I tried the both of these tortas! On a side note, the Jamon torta is worth an honorable mention. Definitely get this w the fried egg!  On this particular pilgrimage however, I was joined by both my brothers and our friend, as we were in anticipation for some good eats. Having been there before, I assured the bunch that they were in for a treat. Walking through the front door, you could smell the wave of aroma coming through this establishment. Did I mention I saw Rick Bayless on this visit!? This time, I chose the Cochinita Pibil (yes, only one torta this time). Which is suckling pig and achiote, black beans, pickled onion, and habanero. The habanero comes on the side in the form or a sauce. **WARNING** if you like spicy, then you will LOVE the habanero sauce! Be warned! My only gripe my first trip here was that the accompanying sauces were not hot enough...the habanero is HOT! I made the mistake of dipping my first bite of cochinita completely in the sauce and taking a bite....""Whoo!"" wow. very hot stuff. The house made chips and guac are definitely a must have as an accompanying side treat! The real delight though for all of us came at the end of the meal...yup...CHURROS! My youngest brother who I know personally LOVES churros was super stoked to try them. After finishing our meals, the churros came down with their soft serve. GET the side of soft serve to dip your churros in, you will not be sorry!  There are a few other tortas I definitely want to try, but what really has my attention is their soups...they look massive and look equally as fulfilling as any of the tortas so Ill be sure to update my review after that.

The tortas are delicious. The Ahogado is AMAZING, and one of those dishes that makes me think about sandwiches differently.  The panini aren't as impressive; I had their prosciutto panini with a fried egg, and while tasty, it was a complete mess, partially because they didn't cut all the way through the bread, and flipped it upside down, so the sandwich collapsed into the basket as soon as I lifted it up.  For $13, the least they can do is cut all the way through.

Forget Tacos and Burritos (not on the menu anyhow). Start with some Tortas, Mexican heros. We shared the Choriqueso, with minced sausage, peppers and cheese. Delicious. And a Mushroom Torta, with goat cheese, black beans and arugula. It was OK, bur the Chorizo won that round. Main course were soupish dishes called Caldos. Best of the lot was the Carnitas, with plenty of tender tasty pork, as well as potato dumplings, spinach and avocado. Close to it was the Pork Belly Vermicelli, with mushrooms and zucchini.

Anyway so we debated going here and I am glad we did because as soon as we walked in i noticed Rick Bayless behind the line actually cooking the food! I was so happy! Needless to say over the next 3 days I ate there 4 times! One morning I was asked if it was ok if the news camera man filmed my son, then the next morning I actually got to talk with Rick Bayless for a few minutes! I am such a nerd but it was cool.  MY only complaint was that my poor son wasnt eating solid foods yet so the only thing he was able to enjoy was chewing on the menu. Thankfully we will be going back to chicago next week so he will finally beable to eat!  My other observation is that my tomatillo salsa is better! Though I am willing to try xocos again and see if theyve improvedover mone haha. Btw their salsa is incredible! All the food here was good, I am very much looking forward to returning. Like I told Rick Bayless last year, I moved to a small town in az with no good mexican food, I plan on stealing as many recipes as i can so that I have good food to eat between my visits to chicago!  Highlight Besides meeting the entire kitchen staff and laughing with them, I remember one chef made an old restaurant joke like we only serve kids medium rare. We laughed and then they proceeded to play with our son and try and make him smile. Sorry the highlight of this ""take out"" place was that when I was there they we not using plastic utensiles instead when I got breakfast togo they gave me metal forks. The manager pointed out that they were not that expensive and people were more likely to reuse them thus not clogging up landfills! Stupid thing to get excited about but i think it is nice to see people actually willing to spend a little more to make less waste.   Oh regarding lines, I was there in september of 09 and hardly noticed any line. The line moved very quickly and by the time your food was ready there was a place to sit.",0.9959,0.762,0.178,0.06,0.49621468926553675

I really liked the atmosphere of the restaurant--modern, yet warm and inviting.  It really was a bit of an inspiring and invigorating place to start the day.  Yes, perhaps it is a tad expensive for a relatively simple breakfast, and I see how long lines could quickly kill the mood, but overall it is a solid place that I hope to visit again.",0.8175,0.822,0.136,0.042,0.49455782312925173

I got the Pibil (sucking pig) torta and my wife got the Gunthorp Chicken torta.  Who knew sandwiches could have such complex flavors and textures.  The pork on the Pibil was tender, juicy, and covered with an amazing combo of pickled onions and spicy sauce.  Yum!  The wood fired chicken and  tomatillo salsa on the Gunthorp was a great combination too. Also, if you like spicy food, order extra habanero salsa.  This stuff is potent and delicious.  To round out the meal, we ordered a Aztec hot chocolate and 4 churros.  The coco was a little thinner than I expected, but very tasty and the churros were superb.  Crusted with sugar and perfectly crunchy (not greasy).  The staff was super efficient despite the enormous crowds.

Just because there's no meat on the mushroom sandwich (and soup) doesn't mean it's vegetarian! It's not. The beans at Xoco are cooked in pork.  That said, the person at the counter was super accomodating, adding extra avocado instead of the beans for the sandwich. It is simply not possible to get the soup made without the beans. Therefore, the soup is not vegetarian.  The sandwich was amazing. Simply wonderful. But I have to take a star off for not having a dedicated vegetarian sandwich, and for misleading all the eaters and reviewers on yelp who are calling the mushroom options at xoco vegetarian.",0.5875,0.832,0.087,0.081,0.7172619047619048

That said, it's casual, but Rick Bayless really knows what he's doing (yet again). The Aztec Hot Cocoa is delightful, but the churros were the best part.

You stand in line to order your food, and there are a few small tables inside and outside available for seating. The menu is primarily composed of tortas (sandwiches) and caldos (hearty soups). I ordered the Ahogada since the cashier told us it was one of their specialties, and it was a cross between a torta and a caldo (a carnita sandwich in a bowl of super spicy tomato broth)... The Ahogada was a fiery explosion of flavor in my mouth! I enjoyed the contrast of the crunchy bread with the spicy tomato broth, creamy black beans, and tart pickled onions...like a French dip sandwich, but with a spicy personality. The carnitas was tender and delicious, but it was difficult to distinguish its flavor amidst the intensely hot chile sauce.  After eating at both XOCO and Frontera, my recommendation would be to skip the looooong wait at Frontera and eat at XOCO instead. both restaurants deliver lots of bold, in-your-face flavors and spices in a wide variety of Mexican dishes.",0.9117,0.873,0.094,0.032,0.476984126984127

I must admit it's pretty easy to jump on the bandwagon. I'm a sucker for cheap Mexican beer with lime and guacamole and chips. I drown my breakfast in Tapatio hot sauce. I love eating tacos from a truck. And I think I just described every single person that waited for an hour in line with me at XOCO. (NAILED IT!) =) Bottom line is this place came up short....after teasing me for an hour while I waited in line. I watched a line cook cut up corn tortillas and fry them. Sprinkle lime/lemon juice and salt on them. I watched cooks toast fresh bread in sizzle platters with braised short ribs and melted cheese. There were people walking by with fresh hot chocolate.  I was ready to start gnawing on my own arm like a zombie.  When I finally tasted the food, I was a bit underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong. It's yummy. I just don't think it's worth an hour wait in line. Here's the report card: Pepito - short rib and caramelized onion with pickled jalapenos. The short rib was a bit dry. The seasoning was flat and one-dimensional. A bit salty. I was expecting to taste Mejico. Instead, I got a really good version of an American braised short rib sandwich. Jamon- thinly sliced La Quercia prosciutto, black bean puree (emulsified with pork fat), avocado, pickled jalapenos, and a fried egg ($1.50 extra). This was a pressed sandwich that was unpleasant to eat in terms of eatability. The sandwich had too many elements that were slippery which made the sandwich a soggy mess. Every bite forced the filling out every angle of the bread. The ham was sliced too thick which meant you had to slurp up the ham as it pulled away from the bread. This is a dish that is successful in other applications (Purple Pig has a very similar menu item that is more enjoyable). Chips & Guacamole- The guacamole is buttery and smooth. It needed a bit more texture and acidity from lime to balance the richness. Overall, this was a good dish though. Barcelona- rich, creamy, and hot fresh chocolate. This was amazing. I recommend you share 1 cup which will run you $3.25 and order 2 churros for dipping.  I'll probably come back to try the cochinita pibil and the choriqueso as well as the pork belly tortas special (Wed). The Caldos look really promising too. I will def give XOCO another try. But for an hour wait and $38 price tag for 2 tortas, chips and guac, and 2 hot chocolates...I have to Yelp that XOCO is SO-SO.",0.9923,0.815,0.141,0.044,0.5360017969451933

2010-09-06,4.0,"A tad expensive for an order-at-the-counter place, but everything we ordered seemed to have been prepared with care, which showed when we bit into our tortas ($9.50 each) and churros ($3 for 3), as well as when we sipped the bean-to-cup Aztec hot chocolate ($2.50) and hibiscus + lemongrass agua fresca ($2.50). When we first walked in, a host asked if we were intending to dine in or take out, and after we answered ""dine in,"" he handed us a table number and promised that we'd have seats at a counter ready by the time we were done ordering. He probably knew that he could keep his promise because a seemingly clueless group of 15 gals was in front of us, which was our bad luck. But I would have appreciated some more coaching by the staff to get them to finish ordering so as not to further irritate the guests behind them. (There was quite a line upon and after our arrival at 7:30pm on a weeknight.) We finally placed our order at 8:00pm, accepted our agua fresca, grabbed a few glasses of water (two still and one sparkling), and had our host show us to our counter seats. The hibiscus + lemongrass agua fresca was much too sweet for my taste, but the flavor was quite nice. The churros and hot chocolate came out next, both of which were delicious. But how could anyone possibly make bad churros when they are coated in sugar, cinnamon, and bits of chocolate? You could see a layer of cocoa bean oil still resting on top of the mug of hot chocolate, which is a welcome sight to see. The Aztec hot chocolate was not as spicy as I would have liked, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The tortas (one mole and one veggie) made their entrance last. The restaurant was accommodating to my vegan requirements, so the veggie torta came sans goat cheese and pork-lard black beans and instead had bonus arugula and mushrooms. It felt like I was eating an interior Mexican panino, which is a compliment since I'm a huge fan of panini. My parents seemed to enjoy their pork mole torta, as well.

2010-09-05,5.0,"I think we probably waited for about an hour total, between waiting in line for a table and waiting for the food itself, before we ate.  My expectations were running pretty high while we waited, because I could literally see that the line of people waiting to eat was not shortening despite the fact that it was 3 or 4 in the afternoon. I live in NYC and I'm currently visiting my sister in Chicago.  I've visited Chicago before, but this was the first time since being active on Yelp.  According to Chicago Yelpers, Mexican food in Chicago is great and I should visit one of Rick Bayless' restaurants.  Originally my sister and I wanted to go to Frontera Grill.  Unfortunately for us, they were closed during that middle-of-the-afternoon time period that we arrived.  So we went next door to XOCO.  The hostess told us it would be about 25 to 30 minutes to get a table.  We considered for a few seconds whether or not to stay, and I thought, yeah if this many people think the food is worth the wait, the food should be good.  So we got in line. We started looking at the menu while we were in line, and I was undecided between the carnitas torta and the chorizo torta.  Being the social media addict that I am, I quickly sent out both a tweet and a facebook status update asking for opinions.  By the time we got to the front of the line, I still had no replies.  My friends and twitter followers are useless.  Fortunately I noticed the Daily Special Tortas menu on the wall and saw that the day's torta was Goat Barbacoa.  And that sounded tasty as hell.  My sister decided on the Cubana torta and we each ordered a churro.  For good measure, I also ordered a Homemade Mexican Vanilla Soft Serve with maple-pecan-bacon-streusel and salted caramel sauce. We were handed a number and shown to a bar table and two seats.  The restaurant was extremely busy and I'm not sure how long we waited, but it seemed like we waited for a long time.  Or we were just really hungry because we did not eat lunch.  When our tortas finally arrived at our table, we began to devour our food after the obligatory food pictures were taken.  I am not sure what else to report other than that the Goat Barbacoa torta was simply amazing.  Seasoned with oaxacan pasilla-tomato salsa, onions, and cilantro, the goat barbacoa was served in slightly toasted bread, together with avacado.  It had a hint of smokiness while retaining a slight gamey flavour that is distinctive of game meat like goat, without either components overpowering the savoury and tender goat meat.  The various flavour elements of the meat were in perfect proportion, and the avacado was a great complement to the goat. Soon after we finished our tortas, our churros and soft serve ice cream came.  The churros were tasty and fresh, but the soft serve ice cream was the item that really deserved attention.  The maple-pecan-bacon streusel was delicious and the salted caramel sauce went very well with it.  The saltiness of the sauce doesn't come through until after you swallow each spoonful of ice cream.  Every spoonful of ice cream would taste sweet and rich, and after you swallow, a bit of saltiness would come forth.  I could not get enough.  I probably could have eaten two cups of this ice cream even though I was already very full.

OH THE SMELLS, they made us stay and wait.  I am glad I did. What's really crazy about this place is that almost all the food they use in their meals (down to the meats) are organic and come from local farmers.  They even break it down to you where they get each of their foods from exactly inside the store.   You can order from here either sandwiches, a big soup, salad, chips, coffee, hot chocolate, and desserts.  I went with the Cochinita Pibil.   Cochinita Pibil: It is a wood roasted sandwich consisting of sucking pig, topped with pickled onion and a mixture of black beans and anchiote, and a dipping sauce made from habaneros.  I have to admit I was suckered in to get this because it had suckling pig.  Overall I would say the sandwich was okay.  The flavor combinations were great with the pickled onions, achiote, and black beans.  Wooden grilling of the sandwich gave the bread a great crunch to it.  The habanero... it has a good starting flavor that later resulted in numbness of my mouth (I can't take down hot pepper stuff like I use to).  Yet I kept on going back to trying more and more.  What was the big flaw for me here was the suckling pig.  It is probably because everytime I have had sucking pig, I have had ridiculously well made suckling pig.  This felt more like a pulled pork (if you try suckling pig that I have... yeah there's a difference) with a good marinate.  Yeah the pork was cooked well, it was juicy, and not dry.  It's just the bias I have with the suckling pig I have eaten in the past.  Now for sandwiches (even if it is suckling pig), I am not comfortable buying one for 12 dollars plus tax.  It doesn't come with any sides    What was really impressive about this place is the quality of service they gave us.  There was a pause in us receiving our orders so that you of the people at our table received their orders a few minutes later than our order.  We didn't complain and just looked past it and were our enjoying our meal.  The manager came up to us and apologized for this momentary break.  And because of it gave us all free churros and an ice cream to dip it in.  Now I'm not saying you will get the exact same treatment if the same thing happens to you.   But that gesture I feel was HUGE in showing their dedication.  Because 1.) The place was packed and extremely busy with a line behind us heading out the door & 2.) We didn't even complain about this because it really wasn't an issue at but they made it their personal goal for us to get the best experience we could.  This isn't a sit down restaurant where a waiter comes to you, gets tips, and etc.  It's just like a sit-down place where you order in the front, sit down, and wait for your food to get ready.  So this really meant something in my opinion. Now I must say... these churros were absolutely ridiculous in how good they were.  I have never experienced homemade style churros (I'm just use to the one's you get at fairs and bowling alleys that are premade), but these had to have been the best churros I have ever eaten.  The outside was so crispy and covered with what seemed to be the perfect amount of sugar and cinnamon.  The inside of the churros was soft and... oh I just want to eat another one right now.  BUT  what makes them go over the top is the dipping the churros in ice cream with brown chunks and chocolate mole sauce.  The vanilla ice cream itself is slightly different because they use Mexican vanilla beans to make it, give it a not as sweet but smoother flavor.  The same goes for the chocolate mole sauce.  The cocoa beans they used to make the chocolate are from Mexico and produce a sweetness that is not overpowering but finishes really pleasant.  Putting all of these together for dessert REALLY leaves a lasting impression. So overall, my experience went from a four to a five star here because of the dedication they had to go above and beyond in their service and the churros and ice cream.  Plus you can really tell the use of quality ingredients in the food.  So if you're willing to spend a little bit 15 to 20 dollars to get a good mexican sandwich or a bowl of mexican soup, and don't forget the churros and ice cream... come here. The waiting for an hour in line is well worth the experience you'll get.",0.9987,0.834,0.139,0.027,0.4243526990686084
2010-09-02,5.0,"Throughout our adventures throughout the city of Chicago, XOCO is the only dining establishment that we felt deserved a second visit. To be honest, our first visit to the restaurant was on a Saturday and neither of us were even aware that Rick Bayless and his famous Frontera restaurant were in walking proximity to our hotel. Our group had simply wandered about downtown and noticed a line formed in front of a restaurant that stretched halfway down the block so we decided that it would probably be worth our while to follow the masses. On the first visit, we ordered the Gunthorp chicken torta, a chicken torta with black beans and avocado complemented with a light refreshing salsa. Fresh from the oven and savory to the taste buds, the torta raised our hopes about Chicago dining after our previous night of failure. In addition, if the hibiscus and lemongrass drink is available during your visit, it is definitely worth an order. A bit sweet, but the flavor is deep enough when complemented with lemongrass that it is simply a refreshing drink especially when stepping out of weather ranging above the nineties. As for the second visit, we ordered the ahogada torta, also from the wood burning oven, a tender pork torta presented in  a spicy chile sauce. Even for regular diners of spicy foods, the ahogada is truly a meal with that heavy spice that warms the entirety of your body. While it is not a spiciness that will cause an awkward runny nose at the table, it may leave quite a few patrons clamoring for water between each bite of the dish. Truthfully, if you visit Chicago without visiting XOCO it would have been a waste of a trip.",0.8885,0.879,0.083,0.037,0.4673418085182791

The menu is a large selection of Mexican styled sandwiches, soups and more.  Everything included are jazzed up ingredients, fresh for that day, combined together in fits of joy.  I ordered the rib sandwich with pickled jalapenos and it did the trip.  Along with chips and the sauce on the side, each bite told a story.  I paired it with a Sophie beer and it was the perfect companion. There's something for everyone, vegetarian to meat eaters.  Even picky eaters and kids will be able to find something.  They serve authentic hot chocolate, which I look forward to trying when it gets cooler out.

People in the restaurant were so excited to see him and he was smiling and looked excited to be there.  My husband and I went for dinner on a Friday after work. There was no wait to sit inside (there was a short wait for outside). We ordered and were seated in less than 10 mins. We started with chips and guacamole. I agree with the comments as to the size of the guacamole portion but for $4.00 it somewhat makes sense (avocados are expensive). However, my one gripe about the whole place is that they did not have salsa on the table. I guess you have to order an extra side which seems odd for a Mexican restaurant considering its salsa, the one thing that should be complimentary. I guess we are talking Rick Bayless salsa, so again, it may make sense.  My husband and I each had tortas. The portions were huge!!! Way too big!! I had the Milanesa (breaded chicken) and it was amazing. There was some sort of avocado cream salsa with poblano peppers. It was nice and spicy. My husband had the Cuban (pork and bacon) and to me it had way too much bacon (Wait, is that possible). The bacon kinda stole the show for me. He thought it was fine but did comment that mine had better flavors.  We finished with just one churro bc we read they were to die for. It was hot and tasty .. super good but I am glad we only got one because we were stuffed.  I am docking one star because of the lack of extra salsa on the table and the prices. Ok, the prices are not horrible for this type of gourmet street food but there is something about going for chips and tortas and spending $40.00 that seems wrong to me.

If anything, he has inspired me to make Mexican food in my home and make it my own. I made the wait for about 35 minutes with a friend. The server was very gracious and took our order and asked us if we were vegetarian. We're not exclusively vegetarians, but when we eat out, we normally go vegetarian and seafood since I try to eat halal. The server then told us that even the vegetarian dishes such as Woodland Mushroom use lard/pork to cook the black beans. The food server told us that the food tried to preserve the Mexican manner of cooking so I understood that and order the woodland mushroom torta without black beans and since we came on friday also order the Shrimp and Bacalao torta without black beans. The shrimp and bacalao torta was very salty and had a raw taste to that. Maybe it's supposed to be balanced by the black beans and authentic Mexican and have a salty brine taste, but it was overpowered by this salty taste. I didn't enjoy this dish very much. The Woodland Mushroom was good because the goat cheese was great. I would recommend dessert which was soft ice cream, brownie / chocolate bits and just a very very mild hit of spice.

As for the food itself: we shared the Ahogada Torta and the Milanesa Torta.  Some restaurants tell you food is spicy, when it truly isn't.  Do not expect that here - the heat will stay with you.  Guzzled much of the water (great options for self-service, still/sparkling/limes available). Both tortas were fairly enjoyable, but I especially liked the Milanesa one.  Perhaps I wasn't so into the Ahogada's tomato broth, and the carnitas felt to me, a little dry.  Maybe I didn't soak it into the broth enough, or else I felt that there should be additional ingredients to make the carnitas more tender.  Something creamy (avocados?) might have livened up the proceedings... And for dessert, we shared the churros.  I think it's a tad cheaper to get three of them, instead of just one.  MMMMM!  They were very nice and crispy, with a good sweetness in the dough, although I had to knock off a lot of the sugar that was on the churro itself.  Still, bliss!

Before you get seated, don't forget to grab yourself a cup of water (still/sparkling) from the fountain. The dinner menu consists of soups and sandwiches (tortas).  Both come in pretty hefty portions - I could have eaten less than half and be completely full. At the recommendation of the host, I ordered the Ahogada sandwich with pork, pickled onions, and a spicy tomato broth.  When the bus boy brought my food out to me, it came in a bowl with two halves of a sandwich sitting in a thick pool of spicy broth.  The broth was too tart and thick, like a sauce, and the pork was tough and dry.  Overall, nothing interesting or even very good about the flavors.  The bread was fine, nothing special; I wasn't impressed. I also ordered the Aztec hot chocolate (authentic Mexican hot chocolate with chili and spices) and the Mexican vanilla bean soft serve with bacon streusel and salted caramel.  The hot chocolate was just ok, not really chocolatey in flavor, but maybe I'm just not used to the Mexican version.  The soft serve, however, was the best thing I had at Xoco.  Great vanilla flavor, smooth texture, topped with a nice sweet-salty crunch of stresel and thick, gooey caramel.  I wish I hadn't eaten my sandwich and just had this instead. The wait wasn't too bad, especially compared to Frontera Grill, where my friend and I had stopped by earlier to try (unsuccessfully) to grab a seat at the bar for dinner so this was our backup plan.  I wasn't really enamored with it so I don't think I'd return.",0.9932,0.817,0.145,0.038,0.4778017718715392

And I want that.  But the fantastic food you will likely get here will cost you like a motherfucker, both in terms of the horrendous  odysseanlike journey you may have to endure just to get the food into your fucking mouth and cost you like a motherfucker in terms of actually costing like a motherfucker - I once spent more than $35 on lunch here for myself and this place is a walk-up counter set up like a Chipotle, and yes - I am fat, too - but that is besides the point, being: the good shit is rarely cheap.  And this is the good shit: damn near blessedly braised meats, baby Jesus breathed upon produce, whole cocoa beans to be crushed for you upon demand, Labriola bread (hold up - Labriola bread? Okay, that shit was delicious as hell, but is hardly all organicy and whatnot...whateves...) - there's even a little chalkboard up that explains where all of their food comes from - LOVE IT! Especially since if most restaurants in Chicago were to do the same, it would be boiled down to pretty much one word: SYSCO. [shudders]  I could probably very happily eat here every day of my life (even tho I would have to develop an elaborate downtown panhandling scheme in order to be able to afford it...)  Carnitas soup? Fucking great - potato masa dumplings, hominy, carnitas and cold avocado.  Ahogada - suculent meat, pickled onions, perfectly crusty bread phallically jutting out of an expertly made spicy tomato brothy soup - so fucking food porny great that you should probably be at least 18 years old to even order it.  The mushroom sandwich? SHUT THE FUCK UP! Soooo good, seriously, don't sleep on it because it's a vegetarian option, because it is really one of the best things on the menu - creamy goat cheese, mack ass mushrooms, fantastic salsa - I could easily make this sandwich, but it would take me the better part of the day.  Look for the specials and limited time items, because you might end up eating something that won't ever come out again. And they're super in to soft serve right now, which I think is a little -eh - but if you see ice cream? GET IT - I've had the blueberry tequila and the chocolate Modelo - they were both grrrrreat. And the churros and dipping chocolate sauce? Duuuuuuude.......  But....  This place also has A LOT of fucking problems. The layout and flow of this place is horrible. Seriously bad. So incredibly bad that it is very difficult to believe that someone could have been paid to conceive of this space - bathrooms in the middle of the tiny, cramped dining room, kitchen space oddly tucked in a corner, odd combination of paying up front and then having the people find you with the food, super cheap feeling tables and chairs, having to be seated even though you walk up and order - it's cramped, loud, chaotic and nobody, seems to know what the hell to do to make the food-getting happen quickly - employees and customers included. How bad is it? Fifty percent of the times that I've come here, I've ended up leaving and not staying to eat. And every single time I've been there, the rules and procedures for ordering and seating have been totally different. There are just waaay too many kinks and changes for a new restaurant brought to you by someone who is already a successful restaurateur.  But even with that, the food is good as hell - and I've never even seen an episode of Top Chef. They even pop off gourmety and super complicated cupcakes on occasion, clearly tapping into my psyche. And if you're a fame whore, you'll be delighted to know that you stand a pretty decent chance of seeing Rick Bayless actually in there (but usually Twittering, not really cooking).  In conclusion? It's the ultimate clusterfuck that will yield some of the best food you've ever put in your mouth - like a dude who's only ONLY good quality is that he's good in bed, but he's really, really, really good....you understand what I mean, right?...shit, okay, neverymind....  I'm developing a somewhat serious XOCO addiction and I'm a glutton for punishment in the form of working really hard just to eat a fucking sandwich - you may or may not be similarly inclined.

But onto the main event.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, maybe it was an off day, or maybe people just eat too much damn sodium, but holy guacamole was this food salty.  I had the short rib soup, my mother the pork belly soup, and my brother the veggie soup (it was my birthday dinner).  The best way to describe the flavor, is not particularly glamorous, but here goes. When you eat a steak taco, and the delicious, concentrated, flavor and grease run down your fingers, and you lick them, that is what this tasted like.  The flavor was there, however, the salt just overpowered the actual taste of the soup. The ingredients in the soup including the squash and what appeared to be yucca as well as the beef tasted good, but again, the salt was just sopped up within these starches. I would definitely go back and attempt a sandwich instead, but I was pretty bummed.  There are so many fabulous Mexican and South American restaurants in Chicago, I was hoping for this celebrity chef hot spot to blow me away; I was sorely disappointed.",0.9754,0.818,0.127,0.055,0.4520576131687242

About 5 minutes later, however, the line was out the door. To be honest, I kind of wish we'd had to wait a minute so we could have had more time to look a the menu and figure out how the whole ordering process goes down (it's also very, very loud and hard to hear the cashier). I ordered the Pepito Torta and my friend ordered the Cubana, with a cafe con leche and Diet Pepsi to drink, respectively. We also ordered salsa and chips, two cups of Almendrado and an order of three churros. They ask you if you want to wait for your churros and chocolate until after you are done eating, which is nice. You get a number and then there is someone there to seat you (we were seated at a counter facing the wall that runs through the middle of the room). The tortas were incredible. The pepito was unbelievably juicy and rich, with braised shortribs, caramelized onion, jack cheese, black beans (I couldn't really taste the black beans) and pickled jalapenos. It kind of reminded me of a fancy Italian beef sandwich, and I mean that in a good way. The crusty bread was topnotch. The cubana was possibly even better, with smoked pork loin, bacon, black beans, avocado, jack cheese and chipotle mustard. The pork was also crazy juicy and it had just the right amount of smokiness, with lots of cheese and thin layers of the avocado and mustard.  The place is very busy and people are running all over the place, so I had to go up to the counter and ask for my coffee and our chips and salsa. She brought the chips and salsa and then I asked for my coffee again and she asked if we just wanted our churros and chocolate at that point as well, which was fine (the cafe con leche was delicious, but Rick Bayless always seems to have great coffee at his restaurants). The chips and salsa were good, but nothing special. The salsas are the same that you get with the tortas and the tortas are so huge and filling that sides are really unnecessary. The churros were amazing. They were light, airy, crisp and sweet. Certainly the best churros I've ever had. The almendrado, on the other hand, which is a shot of chocolate made from their fresh-roasted cacao beans mixed with almond milk, was way too sweet. I only drank half of mine. It was fine for dipping, but it's actually a fairly good sized cup and it was just too rich and cloying for both of us. Maybe it would have been good in an espresso cup so you had just a taste. I would certainly go back for the super tasty tortas alone, although I want to try the caldos so bad now, and ending with the churros is a must, although I'd try one of the other drinking chocolates.",0.9971,0.816,0.158,0.026,0.5712983848510165

Because you can help yourself to the complementary taps of fresh and sparkling water available at the counter.

XOCO has the best tortas in Chicago, and even my Mexican boyfriend had to admit it after visiting numerous other places. Fresh ingredients, freshly made, inventive and delicious. You will find that the soups (""caldos"")  here are also great, but the oven-made tortas are truly the best (Gunthorp chicken and Ahodaga especially). The grilled ones have to come a distant second, and first-timers shouldn't get them. Because you can finish your meal with 3 delicious and freshly baked churros for only $3, and they will be goooood. Because, as you promptly leave after you finish eating, you will realize that the metallic stools are the best way to get people to focus on the food and then to politely depart, freeing up space for those hungry excited fresh faces in the 40 minute line-up.

Yes, the bread might have gotten soggy had it sit in the sauce longer but we picked those babies up right away and chowed down. The bread was crispy yet soft enought to fit right into my mouth for the ultimate satisfaction. SCORE. Milanesa - the chicken milanesa torta was also great but just not as good as  the Ahodaga.  It was served with a salsa verde, but I kept going back to the red sauce from our Ahodaga plate to pour on top of the Milanesa. I would probably like to see a little less cheese, but that's just how I like my sammys. Churros - 3 for $3! They were so yummy, rolled in sugar and housemade ground chocolate. Since it was a humid day I shied away from the hot chocolate and went for the homemade soft serve vanilla icecream to dip the churros in. YUMMMMY!

I have been hearing about XOCO for quite a while but I never got a chance to check it out until a couple of friends came to visit from Canada. She is a big fan of Rick Bayless, so we went there for lunch. We waited in line (yes, there's a line) for 30 minutes before we were able to order.  I am a huge carnitas guy so I ordered the Ahodaga. It's a carnitas torta toasted in a wood burning oven and served with some rich spicy tomato broth in a bowl. It's not so much like a soup and sandwich meal. I see it more like a sandwich with a dipping sauce - kinda like beef baguette sandwich and au jus. The carnitas was super tender and the tomato broth has all the sweet goodness that I was looking for. Not to mention, it's spicy enough to clear my sinus. It was a wonderful combination.

Trust. I'm going to go ahead and say that the Gunthrop Chicken torta is hands down the best sandwich I've had in my entire life.  This is coming from a woman who has been around the block and seen some things in her day.  I don't know if it was the firey, spicy red chili chicken, the black beans or the avocado that made it so delicious.  Perhaps the pickled onions or the side of spicy salsa or even the heavenly, crusty bread?  Honestly, at this point I don't really care.  All I know is that my sandwich and I shared a moment today while I dined at XOCO.  And that, my friends, was worth the 30 minute wait in line. Another thing: Just get the churros and don't worry about how many calories you're about to consume.  At $3 for three decent sized churros, it's a steal.  And they're delicious.

I ordered the chorizo torta, side of churros and a agua del dia. The torta was spot on. The layers of fresh baked bread, chorizo, egg, cheese and avocado were incredible and the salsa verde on the side was a great added bonus.

I want to give this place four stars since the food is so good, but even with a rick bayless sighting, the seating, loudness and line spoils the meal enough to dock it half a star.  Food: amazing. considering this place generally makes sandwiches, it is all delicious. my table had the mushroom, short rib and chicken avocado tortas. i split the mushroom and short rib with a friend and was full without finishing my ""sandwich"" but I still wanted to taste the chicken sandwich with avocado spilling out of it. also, the table next to me had a half sandwich dipped in a soup and I would have loved to have tasted it. the tortas i had, mushroom and short rib, were amazing. the meat was soft and tender and very flavorful. the mushrooms were well paired with a pungent cheese. all very good. I also got a hibiscus drink. it was a little too sweet for me but after watering it down it was quite refreshing.  the main downer for me was the seating. we got a great table in the middle of the restaurant. but even with most likely the best seat in the house, i could not hear the conversation on the other side of the table. it became even frustrating to the point where we left early. the line is also unusual. we came early at 11:30am for lunch. since our third wasn't there yet, we were asked to wait at the front of the line (allowing others to go in front of us) until our third came. i think the hostess was very considerate of our situation and she saved a table for us as the line wasn't that obnoxious. but when we left at around 1, there was an obnoxious line. apparently they only allow you to order from the line if there's a table available. so instead of waiting at a table with a seat and good conversation with your company and possibly an order of chips an guac, you stand in line until someone leaves. i understand how this works for such a small space, but it must be very uncomfortable for those standing around.  overall, i'd go back. but i'd prefer take out rather than sit down.  as you can see from the online menu, the prices are reasonable and i couldn't even finish my sandwich.  i did have a rick bayless siting. he was tasting all the sauces, meats and drinks. very cool.",0.9973,0.813,0.17,0.017,0.49604700854700856

2010-07-26,3.0,"My aunt and cousins asked where I would like to go for a post birthday lunch this past Saturday. I knew I would be downtown so I thought this popular Rick Bayless joint would be a nice selection.  The long line in front can be very deceiving as it is for Frontera....the entrance for XOCO is actually on the side of the building. While waitng on my family members to show up, I actually had a chance to briefly say hello to Mr Bayless outside. He seemed to be in a hurry, but was polite enough to say hello back to me as he walked back inside the building. The hostess (whom I was told was his daughter) informed us if we were dining in then we would have a 10 minute wait for a table of 5. There seemed to be a separate line for takeout as well. No one really stopped to tell us about the whole dining process. We had to look at the menu on the wall and pay before we ate so we looked pretty lost while in line with others behind us. I consulted with a buddy of mine (Dylan D) via text message to ask him about the delicious sandwich he had here months ago and he told me the Pork Belly sandwich was the one that blew his mind. He also said the Cubana was tasty as well. I found out they only serve the pork belly joint on Wednesdays. I went with the Cubana which was decent. It came with a very tasty salsa which made the sandwich much better. To drink, I went with the Lemonade which was sweeter that sweet (pretty good though). We ordered the churro as well...I hear everyone raving about them, but they taste the same as the ones from most carnivals. I guess most people have never had a decent churro before or maybe because it is associated with Mr Bayless it tastes much better to them, lol!!!! Pretty decent spot. Would not mind going again, but I don't know if it is worth standing in the long lines I keep hearing about everyone standing in. I guess I was lucky enough to show up on a late Saturday afternoon to avoid their long lines. Place is pretty small so I can understand it being a wait at times. They have outside dining as well which I would have taken advantage of, but it looked like it wanted to rain.

Now onto the star of the show: the food. Cubana- My favorite torta! It was filled with beans, pork, avocado and chipotle mustard. It was absolutely delicious! The torta was pressed a little so it was easy to eat even though it was jam packed with delicious ingredients. Definitely a winner. Pepito- Short rib beef with beans and jalapenos. I did not like this sandwich as much. Something about the short rib beef that I didn't like--maybe it was the caramelized onions. I don't usually like to mix sweet with salty.  Aztec hot chocolate- Very rich with a kick of spice. It is not your mother's hot chocolate. If you get this one, don't expect something sweet- expect something made from bittersweet chocolate and an aftertaste of cayenne. Churro- THE BEST PART OF THE MEAL. I was already full from the tortas and hot chocolate, but my stomach instantly expanded for the churros. They were hot out of the fryer and sprinkled with the perfect amount of sugar and cinnamon.

I tried the Ahogada because I'm a huge fan of good carnitas.  I expected to get some of the best tasting carnitas ever and what I got were arguably the worst.  I felt the meat was very dry and pretty tasteless.  I had to bathe the sandwich in the hot sauce that came with to get flavor.  I must say, I was quite disappointed in that.  If I had to guess why it was lacking, I would say they probably don't prepare the whole pig by slow roasting it overnight.  I'm pretty sure shortcuts are taken.  That is my own speculation though.  Either way, I definitely do not recommend that sandwich to anyone who wants good carnitas.  However it is prepared, it isn't very good. My wife got a Milanesa (Chicken) torta and had mixed feelings.  At first, she wasn't blown away, but it helped when she asked for avocado.  I tried it and thought it was pretty good, but nothing special.

Overall, I feel I may be a little harsh in my words, but I feel this was a very average meal.  I'd like to add that my feelings definitely weigh in that you are paying $10 for this sandwich and a couple bucks for a small cup of chocolate milk.  The truth is that I could get a better tasting torta at half the price almost anywhere else that I frequent.  I think it is kind of ridiculous to pay so much more for a sandwich that isn't twice as good (As stated above, my sandwich wasn't even as good...much less twice as good).

I've also tried the Ahogada, which is basically a sandwich in a spicy soup.  Golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, pickled onions, in between the awesome bread, like all the other tortas and cooked in a wood burning brick oven.  It's served pointing out of the the spicy sauce like the leaning tower. Mild had a good kick to it, but my friend got hot and looked like he was getting choked out by Chuck Norris.  The churro afterwards was a good way to cool off.  Made to order churros, served hot drenched in cinnamon sugar.

This is one of the reasons we ordered takeout and of course, 45 minutes later when I left with the food those two asian groups were still there chatting it up. Unbelievable!

The side salad was light and refreshing though the avocado-lime dressing fell a little flat.  The contents of the torta (chorizo sausage, poblano peppers, jack cheese and tomatillo salsa) were very flavorful however the bread quickly became soggy which detracted from my enjoyment of the sandwich.  The limonada was a true bright spot! It was lemon-limey but not too tart; sweet but not saccharine. Love it! My dining companion and I were really disappointed with the cupcake. I'm not sure if those are done in-house but the flavor did not suit either of our tastebuds.  The frosting (usually my FAVORITE part!) was off and the cake itself was dry and lacked poignant flavors.   We dined al fresco which in theory is a wonderful thing to do on a breezy summer afternoon.  The one drawback to Xoco's outdoor set up is the layout of the seating.  Their tables and barstools are set up in an extremely tight U-shaped pattern so that one must squeeze past others to be seated, an inconvenience for all. Additionally, the poor diners who must sit on the inside of the U are virtually trapped. I couldn't help but wonder why someone chose to design the seating that way.

Don't get me wrong, the food was... not bad.  Unfortunately, everything else combines to make it a ""not so pleasurable"" experience to eat at Xoco.  I had a Cubana sandwich and some Chips with Guacamole.  The latter was perfect.  The guacamole was probably some of the best I have ever had and the chips were sturdy, hot, and fresh.  The sandwich, with pork, bacon, black beans, and avocado was crunchy and flavorful but at 12 dollars I was expecting a bit more. My total bill for both was just under 17 bucks which is a little steep.  Combine with a wait time approaching half an hour in line and an additional 20 minutes after you place your order (not sure what that is about), and it just seems to me that all the hype over this place was essentially for nothing. I was also treated to full on Trixie/Chad PDA makeout sessions from the group in front of me in line.  The entire crowd seemed composed of the Lincoln Park stereotype.  I think I'll go back to grabbing a hot dog from Gold Coast Dogs and eating it by the beach.

2010-06-16,5.0,"I am well-acquainted with the cool, refreshing taste of Haterade. I prefer to drink it from a golden goblet whilst riding my royal trolley and demanding the deeds to dive bars. Some days, however, I am in a rush and I just chug some from a water bottle while riding the CTA. Depends on my mood, you know.  I have never been one to bow at the alter of Bayless. The concept that a gringo is the definitive voice of Mexico has always left me quite uneasy. Beyond that, I was never blown away by his restaurants. My reaction to Topo: eh. My reaction to Frontera: not with MY money! My reaction to Xoco: oh, so THIS is what everyone's been raving about. I didn't want to like it. I wound up loving it! Fantastic! Despite the long lines, grown-up Chixie cluster and cattle-herding environment, I couldn't get enough of what was on my plate and in my glass. To start with, my party got the guac. Creamy, chunky, spicy, sexy...this guac might have been the best I have ever tasted. I didn't want to stop eating it. The accompanying chips were sturdy, slightly salty and perfectly suited to scooping up copious amounts of avocado. This was a terrific start to my lunch. The main event: the Gunthorp Chicken torta from the woodburning oven. Wowie wow wow wow. Crunchy bread that holds spicy chicken, onions, black beans, and more avocado. Every bite was a flavor explosion. My colleagues were talking to me and I didn't hear a word they said. This food demands your undivided attention. To wash it down, freshly made mango lemonade. I took small sips so as to prolong the drinking experience. I suppose I could have ordered another but that line was way too long for me to brave again. This wouldn't be one of my reviews without some mention of dessert, right? These hips don't lie (they also don't fit into my old slacks). Churros! Churros with spicy chocolate dipping sauce. These were some good churros...but I still contend that the ones I made at the Chopping Block were better. What can I say? I am a dessert mastermind. Oh, but I got another dessert -- to go. This time, it was Mexican vanilla ice cream topped with a bacon/caramel-y crumble thing. It was like eating a soft serve sundae from McDonalds but with expensive ingredients. The best part: I ate it on the CTA. I left my sippy cup of Haterade back at the restaurant.",0.9828,0.856,0.105,0.038,0.547442680776014

To go with the sweet treats we got a side of very dark chocolate sauce and also amazing ice cream for dunking. Bacon, maple, and caramel were involved.

2010-06-15,4.0,"This is the 1st meal I had in Chicago! After seeing all the raving reviews on Rick Bayless and his 2 restaurants in Chicago, I made it my 1st stop :) Plus I'm a sucker for Mexican food! :) :) :) Man! The restaurant was packed for lunch! And it was a random Friday afternoon! Me and my  mom had to wait at least 30 to 40 min to order! After being allowed to stare at the menu and all the food being cooked by an open fire, we knew exactly what we wanted when we got the counter. Since we missed brunch, we ordered off the lunch menu which comprised mostly of tortas. We ordered one of the ""specials"" - the Shrimp and Bacalao ($11) and one off the ""regular"" menu - the Woodland Mushroom Torta ($9). The Bacalao Torta had huge chunks of bacalao and shrimp covered in a light tomato puree topped with olives and capers. It was paired with a green verde salsa that gave this sandwich a nice tang! Unfortunately the bread was a bit soggy from all the tomato sauce. The Mushroom Torta was EVEN better! It came with wood-roasted garlic mushrooms, goat cheese, black beans and arugula. Just the ingredients themselves gave this torta a nice flavor. This was paired with a rusty chipotle sauce, giving it a nice kick! The bread was also crispier on this torta since it wasn't weighed down by too much sauce. Now on to the most important part of the meal - CHURROS!!! Ok, a little overpriced ($1.25) but welllll worth it! The churro was light and crispy - sugared juuuuust right :)  I saw a few people order 3 and I regretted not doing so! LOL! We also got a ""Almendrado"" ($3.25) - to share. This hot chocolate is made from real chocolate powder and almond milk. Really thick and creamy = absolutely HEAVENLY. Overall, the food was great, but the wait was too long and the price a little too high for the tortas. The churros and hot chocolate on the other hand was well worth the 40 min wait! LOL.. And even to this day, all me and my mom remember from XOCO is almond hot chocolate :) and all we have to say about it is ""MMMMmmmm""",0.9938,0.815,0.155,0.03,0.5953095746845748

2010-06-13,1.0,"The ruse is on!  Walked out feeling bamboozled,  hoodwinked,  scammed, screwed,  fleeced,  deceived and taken for a ride.  I limped back to my car from the action I took in the rear. It is in all honesty that writing this review disappoints me greatly.  I have read the numerous critical rantings about  XOCO and chalked them up to people who either didn't get it,  or of jealous wannabes who don't like seeing one Chef get all the attention. Dear Rick,    Why I ask are my lips burning from salt?  Not just my dish,  my girls dish as well.  Why when I leaned up against a wall did I receive nearly a second degree burn?  Is there a reason your glorified bus boy manager can't work the room and ask how your meal is?  If someone takes an enormous dump,  is there any guarantee I won't have to smell it while eating my salty broth?   I can answer one.  In your greedy quest to squeeze two more people into your restaurant tube,  you placed a piece of sheet metal around your wood fired oven.  This results in a very hot wall with a chair next to it.  Idiotic at best. I was lucky enough to find street parking right across the street,  that was the end of my good fortunes.  The line didn't seem very long and the menu was beautifully written,  it yielded great promises of culinary excitement.  As we clutched our menu,  made our choices we watched a chef make one after another perfect empanadas.  We stared at the wood burning oven relinquish its pleasures onto plates.  Unfortunately this went on for quite some time,  we waited for twenty minutes without the line moving.  We were four people back in the line with no order being taken,  no explanation.   Finally,  we order,  we get directed to our ominous table against the oven.  My buddy Jack P. in his stirring review spoke of the Feng shui being of a ""bus station,  I can't argue with that.  While waiting for the bathroom I was useful in holding the walk in cooler door open for a chef,  stepping back and forth out of peoples way and most of all just clogging up the isle. First our Polverones and hot chocolate arrive,  fantastic.  The best short bread cookie ever,  even though I suspect it was a touch raw inside.  The hot chocolate was rich,  complex and exactly what I expect from Bayless. The Short Rib soup comes and my anticipation has got me giddy.  A tremendous disappointment.  The broth was so salty it stripped me of my abilities to taste anything.  Chunks of zucchini and  potato were added to the bowl rather than simmered in this briny bath.  I think of a soup as an iconic representation of simplicity.  This was more like four ingredients introduced to each other,  and never having the time to get to know one another.   Even had the saltiness not ruined it for me,  this would have been a major failure.  At one desperate point I poured some of my water into my soup just to make it palatable,  even this desperate venture was inadequate in diluting the oceanic vibe of my broth. The smoked pork torta was served plunged halfway into a broth of arbol chilies,  we ordered spicy and it was,  problem was it was so salty,  again with the salt.  I don't get it.  I looked around at the table next to us,  a six top that was struggling with the same issues.  No one comes around to ask ""hows your soup.""  Narry a manager to be seen except to explain to people how to stand in line for a half hour. The ingredients were all excellent,  but the parts were greater than the whole. When this concept was announced I imagined a great place to get a cafe con leche,  a real churro,  maybe a tamal and a champurado.  I guess Ricks bean counters thought that would not generate enough income. Soup,  sandwich,  cookie,  and a hot chocolate=$36  if this food could have lived up to my previous Bayless experiences then that would have been a fine price to pay.  I am sorry,  but I will stick to my small taquerias para caldo y tortas.  Gracias.",0.9492,0.845,0.086,0.069,0.5214378742950171

2010-05-31,5.0,"I can appreciate Xoco because after beginning culinary training in my youth, and hosting a 26-part PBS series called 'Cooking Mexican' in the seventies, I dedicated over six years to culinary research in Mexico, culminating with the publication of my 'Authentic Mexican: Regional Cooking from the Heart of Mexico'.** Wait... I didn't do those things.  Rick Bayless did.  And thank goodness for that, because it allowed the confluence of events that yielded Xoco's opening last year.  And that allowed me to experience the Ahogada sandwich. ""Ahogada"" literally means ""drowned.""  Yes, my wood-grilled pulled pork sandwich was fantastically seasoned and fired to crunchy delicious perfection but it was also cut in half, with the middle ends ""drowned"" in a shallow bowl of a thick tomato-based spicy salsa.  The sandwich halves pointed up like twin obelisks, and when the item was served to me, everybody nearby in the restaurant looked on with awe at how fantastic the sandwich looked and the presentation was.  I have only had this sandwich once (so far) but it is rapidly contending to join the list of my top 10 favorite sandwiches ever. In addition, the guacamole at Xoco is fantastic, as well as liberally peppered with chiles.  The cubano sandwich is solid, if not awe-inspiring.  It is also worth noting that they've got about six different kinds of ""hot chocolate,"" including one I found to be an amazing novelty that was mixed with ancho chiles.  Hot chocolate with a bite!  Yes, it works.

Since we had to head downtown early in the am and well as we all know if you have any chance of sitting or not waiting 1hr you have to be there early.  So I was so excited like I was going to an ice cream shop (Because I love ice cream so much!) As we arrive we see a sign for a combo of Drink (hot chocolate or coffee), warm empenada and a churro for $6 and I though WOW great deal. So each of the kids got the combos.

Both got hot chocolate w/milk, one had the emapanda with ham, mushroom and chipotle pepper, and the other with scrambled eggs and poblano chiles and of course the churros. So verdict 1: Not a chipotle fan but like the hot chocolate and loved the churro. Verdict 2: A fan of the egg and poblano, churros but the chocolate was too rustic for her. I myself am not a fan of chipotle so I understood. But the crust was delicious and I liked the egg and poblano also.  The hubby had the Savory Bread Pudding ham, poblano, cheese which he liked but I did not try and the hot chocolate and churros. No complaints and really no words so must have been good. LOL!!  OK so what did I have you ask? Well I had the churros. Growing up as a kid we had them every weekend when we went to the store for carnitas and menudo. So that is what I wanted. And I also had a Jamaica (hibiscus) and lemongrass aqua fresca. So being allergic to cranberries and raspberries I had learned to say NO to the red drinks but while on a cruise and visiting Costa Maya I had it and loved it. That was just natural but then this had lemongrass and wow it was a great way to cut the sometimes bitter Jamaica. So loved it!!  Now lets get to the churros. OMG!!!!!!  Now I have never in my ENTIRE life have a churro like this. It was tied in this cute ribbon shape and sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon and was warm and oh so tasty and so soft and delicious!!

XOCO is Rick Bayless creation that puts an upscale spin on Mexican street vendor food.  As you walk in, there are two lines:  one for dine in and one for To-Go.  We went on a Saturday around 8:30PM and there was a 35 minute wait to get a table.  We gladly waited, especially since you can get beer, wine, and chips & salsa while you wait.   The menu is pretty straightforward.  Tortas (Mexican sandwiches) are the specialty and a must have.  Most, if not all, of the food is locally-sourced so it is very fresh and high-quality.  I had the ""Ahodaga"" torta which was made of golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, pickled onions.  The flavors were simple yet complex and an absolute joy to eat.  My wife had the ""Woodland Mushroom"" torta which was made of  wood-roasted garlic mushrooms, Prairie Fruits Farm goat cheese, black beans, wild arugula, 3-chile salsa.  She is vegetarian and her expectations were wildly exceeded.  As a meat-eater, I did not miss meat eating her veggie sandwich.  The freshly made guacamole and chips are a must as a side and the bland appearance of the side salad was deceiving as it was bursting with great flavor and texture.   We had heard that the churros are amazing so we indulged.  We got an order of 3 for $3 and they were addictive, fried, sweet goodness.  To put it over the top, I would highly recommend getting a ""chocolate shot"" for $1.25 to dip the churros in.     The prices are reasonable, especially given the River North location of XOCO.  My wife and I ate like royalty for about $40 total.  Also,  I think getting your food ""to-go"" is the way to go to avoid the wait and so you can enjoy the food as Bayless would have wanted it, as you walk down the street or as you sit on bench looking at the great downtown architecture and just people watch.  The churros alone are worth making the trip and would be an excellent substitute as dessert after a dinner at a nearby restaurant.

And of course, since it was a chilly evening, I got the thick hot chocolate and churros, which reminded me of being in Barcelona.  Basically like drinking a melted truffle.   Eggs and produce are locally sourced.  It's a quick food type place, but there is a host to welcome you and to give you instructions on how things go if you should need them.  As others have mentioned this is a smart tactic to keep things going smoothly.",0.9664,0.817,0.166,0.017,0.5897556390977443

On this busy Friday (with a seating capacity of 40, I fear the line will always be a long one), I chose to apologetically stuff my face with the Cubana, guacamole and chips, churros AND with a lemonade to wash it all down. Guac: A-. Chunky yet smooth, fresh and zesty (I think there's some red peppers in there). A small portion, so we doubled up for our party of four. Cubana: a solid A. It's a torta from the griddle, so the sandwich is pressed and grilled; the bread, perfection. It's filled with smoked Maple Creek pork loin, bacon, black beans, generous chunks of avocado, artisan Jack cheese, and a smidgen of chipotle mustard. This is my new favorite sandwich creation here, and also runs head-to-head with another sandwich I love, the al pastor Cemita of Cemitas Puebla fame. Churros: B+. Sugary, buttery, messy and delicious.  Lemonade: A-. Very sweet but in a different way... really can't put my finger on what makes it so unique, but it's a treat in itself. I can't believe I ate the whole damn thing... but then again, this is the kind of meal you strategically starve yourself for.

2010-05-20,4.0,"So, I'm a little slow to try out restaurants that are hot. Perhaps it is in my favor. A recent visit at 1:30 led to minimal wait times to order and no waiting for a seat.  Brilliant! In any event, I don't have any earth shattering news to report that hasn't been noted (holy moley, 431 reviews?!) but I like to write, so I'll give my two cents, whether warranted or not. When it came time to celebrate my pal's birthday, I suggested XOCO. This was both my and my lunch date's first Rick Bayless experience. (Well, unless you count the Frontera Fresco at the Macy's food court, which is actually quite good.)  Let me just tell you one aspect that I love: FREE BUBBLY WATER. Seriously. Serve yourself, put some ice in a real glass, a slice of lime and you can feel fancy. I love that. We started with the chips and guacamole, because, even as an Irish-German lass, I can whip up a mean guacamole and have the taste buds to tell whether the guac is solid. Win here. No shocker. Good salsa, yummy chips. For $4, this was a great start. My torta (Wednesday's special) was excellent. I mean come one, pork on pork always equals awesome in my world. A dark salsa glazed my meaty, not fatty, pork belly, topped with crisp bacon, arugula, queso anejo (not entirely sure what it is....but it was awesome). It was perfect. The birthday boy had the pepito, cuz, come on, braised short ribs are up there in the ""meat desirability chart"" and he polished his off cleanly as well. No leftovers for us. Yeah, the seating kinda sucks (I was acutely aware of the size of the gentleman's thigh seated directly to my right. I don't think his wife was really happy about that.) and it's pricey, but it is a delicious dining experience. Sadly, it's not one that I'll be able to afford that often, but I will be back.

We both loved the pork belly b/c it had a lot of flavor (and it included bacon) and the dipping sauce had a nice kick to it.  I enjoyed the milanesa as well - great smooth flavor and the salsa went very well with it.  Lastly, the churros were as good as I remembered them ... soft with enough crunch and so fresh - none of that ballpark/carnival stuff.   The place is small so beware if you've got a stroller that you need to bring inside.  As many reviewers have said, the lines are long and they do move but that's b/c ppl are waiting for seats (do the shared seating too so you don't have to wait as long if it's available).  If you're gonna just grab 'n go - that'd be the better option since you don't have to wait as long.  Don't worry, there is a host that will help you along the process.

Pepito ($12) - Braised shortribs meat with pickled jalapenos and onions and melted jack.  Meat is great, but very similar to a philly cheese, but...smaller.  No soup to dunk it in, so can be dry.

When a table was ready for us, my friends ordered the Wood-Roasted Chicken Pozole and the Carnitas (Caldo).  I ordered the Thursday special, Mole Poblano, which is a sandwich-type creation boasting braised pork, onions and cheese.  Of course, we couldn't resist ordering hot chocolates (I got the SUPER thick Barcelona) and churros.   After ordering at the counter, we were seated at a communal table next to a very nice couple.  Our food came fairly quickly, and we dug in.  At first glance, I was a little disappointed with the portion of my sandwich.  For what I paid, it didn't seem that big.  Once I took a bite though, I knew that it was going to be very filling.  The pork was so tender and juicy and the onions gave it a perfect smoky taste.  The bread was just the right amount of crispy and I was in fact very full after I finished.  My friends really enjoyed their soups, although the Carnitas turned out to be super spicy.  I actually never tried it, but based on the reaction of my two friends when they crunched down on what must have been a chili, I can say that it's probably not for the weak.  We thought it odd that there was no real indication of what was spicy and mild on the menu (although my other friend was asked if she wanted her Pozole mild, medium or hot). You order your hot chocolate and churro at the counter at the same time as your dinner, but they can bring it out to you upon request, and we got ours after we finished.  When I got my Barcelona, it was like another meal.  It was as if they took the richest chocolate bar you can think of, put it in the microwave for 45 seconds and served it.  I dipped my churro in it and enjoyed a heavenly moment as the cinnamon, fried dough and impossibly rich and creamy chocolate combined in my mouth to make one of the best desserts ever.

I replied ""no I'm just getting water"" ...  Not even 30 seconds later I was back at my bar stool to find that someone had come by and cleared my plate.  My sandwich was only about 1/3 gone, I'm not sure why anyone would've swooped in to clear my plate.  And the 3 or 4 other stools next to mine were all vacant, so it's not like they were short on bar stools.  I asked the hostess if she could find where it went, but it was too late.  She said they'd remake it, but asked if I wanted it to go.  At this point I was annoyed so I took it, and my ice cream to go. I ate my ice cream first on the way home.  It was a caramel bacon strudel ice cream.  Absolutely divine.  They also use Farmer's Creamery milk, which is my preferred milk/cream in Chicagoland.  It tastes amazing.  The ice cream was pretty amazing.  I ate the new sandwich when I got back to my office.  It traveled pretty well. A bit of a hassle to deal with going here, and it's not inexpensive...

The servers got a little confused and said they would bring it about twenty minutes after delivering the meal but I think they forgot. I asked someone about it and still didn't receive it.

The price was a wee bit high when I think about most ""quick"" Mexican food stands, but again, it was worth it [as you read on you'll understand].

It's so good to see something other than tacos at a restaurant which highlights Mexican flavors and cooking, and the sandwiches are truly unique. The ahodaga torta, which I figured would be the best to try since it is the only option they do not allow for take-out, was a medley of pork, black beans (which I couldn't find, maybe they were pureed? Couldn't taste them anyhow), and pickled onions sandwiched between a crusty bread that the angels must've made from God's tears, dough, and yeast. It is a contradiction - a delicious tragedy - that this sandwich sits in a shallow bowl of spicy tomato broth. I prefer my bread crusty (not soggy), but without the spicy kick, it just isn't ""special."" The churros were good... and TINY!

2010-04-25,4.0,"To be perfectly honest, I think my favorite thing about XOCO is how it desperately tries to be something less than it is.  If you ignored the line, the reputation, and the quality of food you would think you'd have entered any generic higher-end fast food joint.  XOCO really wants to be the next Chipotle knock-off, when it's obviously so much more. Protip: You must get churros and hot chocolate with your meal.  And you will ask them to only bring to them to you after you're done with the main course, so you get the warmest dessert possible. I went with the pepito, which was the unbeatable combo of pork and cheese.  The bread had a great crunch to it, and I'm still praying for the poor Mexican family who Rick Bayless tortured to get their amazing secret spices.  At least, that's how I imagined it went down.  You don't become Top Chef without getting your hands a little dirty. I think I was more impressed with what my friend got, the duck soup.  A little scant on the actual duck meat, but more mysterious Mexican spices is never a bad thing.

2010-04-25,5.0,"So I spent this weekend in Chicago and on the recommendation of several locals, we shuffled along hungover up Clark Street to Rick Bayless's XOCO. I was, admittedly nervous about the hype. But the line that went out the door was a little convincing. And the astonishingly delicious sounding menu gave me faith that it would really, really be worth the wait. I mean, I don't get goat barbacoa  tortas in KC. I also don't get Cochinita Pibil here. And despite the fact that the atmosphere was in no way what one would expect in Mexico City, it was like eating at somewhere great and hidden in Mexico City. It was phenomenal. There might have been a food-gasm. Or several.  As the slightly hungover, super starving kids we were, we let our churros come out immediately, and they were  oh so good. (They do ask if you'd like them out immediately or after your food. We were just way too excited.) I know it's hard to blow a churro, but these were not entirely greasy and still had some serious texture. Then we did move on to the special torta, which was goat barbacoa with avocado and cilantro sauce, and some delicious red sauce that absolutely made me want to cry and die and stay there forever. My friend had the cochinita pibil, which I used to get at this great divey place in San Antonio, and this absolutely held up, with pickled onions and a super spicy sauce that was so mindblowlingly awesome.  It was incredible. Incredible enough that we wanted to go back there for dinner.  Unfortunately, the line at 8:30 PM made the one from noon look short and manageable, and we gave up. Part of me really wishes we had waited. I would have liked to try more things. But that line was a pretty big pain, and we were a party of five... That would be my only concern- the way that one waits in line to order, and then may have to wait longer to sit, is a little strange. I would think there would be a better way to seat people, especially considering just how busy XOCO obviously is at basically all times. I would recommend allotting a whole lot of time to go to XOCO, so there's no line-related stress. The food will be worth it. Or if it's after 3 PM, get it to go. If it hadn't been raining and we hadn't been pretty far from our hotel, we would have been all about that.  Also, the beer selection is pretty phenomenal.

I had the Pepito while my sister and dad split a Ahodaga and a bowl of Wood-Roasted Chicken Pozole. We all agreed that the Ahodaga was the best dish of the night, but that they were all amazing dishes. In response to Meghan B.'s review which in which she said quote; ""My only complaint is that we were given our churros & hot chocolate right away, so by the time we wanted to eat them (after our meal, as a dessert) they were both cold. Not sure how they could improve on their system to accommodate those who want to eat their churros and hot chocolate AFTER the meal, but alas..."" We (my family) were slightly confused in ordering the hot chocolate and desserts and when they would be served. We asked the staff and they said that if we ordered them with the rest of the meal they would arrived with or before the meal. However, we were told that if after ordering our meal we wanted to order anything else we could simply walk up to the Take-out line (which never had a line backing up at the register) and order anything we wanted and have it brought out then. So if you want anything after the meal you can just purchase it after and go back to your table. We ended up getting an Aztec (fresh-ground chocolate + water + chile + allspice), a Barcelona (thick, rich) and a fruit tart for dessert. All of the desserts were amazing. I preferred the Aztec for the flavor of the allspice and the after taste of the chile. The fruit tart was a nice light dessert which had a really great pastry crust. The atmosphere of XOCO is a nice relaxed little place, which is impressive considering how packed it was. The fact that it's ""green"" adds to the charm.  Things I think people should keep in mind before going to XOCO and before giving it a lower rating: -You will have to wait in a line and it may be long. So be prepared for this (XOCO is popular don't rate it down because you can't stand to wait) -There are limited seats and tables so you may be asked to join another party at a table. We did and it ended in a nice little chat about the food. However, if you're not comfortable with this be willing to wait for a smaller table. -If your party is very large don't expect to be able to sit with everyone.

2010-04-17,4.0,"I'm the only guy I know who tacks a couple of extra hours onto an in-and-out interviewing trip just so I can stop at some place I've been wanting to eat.  I originally hoped to try one of Rick Bayless' higher-end places, so I settled for XOCO as it was the only spot open after my interview ended. Now I say I settled, but I don't mean to give any sort of negative connotation--XOCO was an excellent choice and served me an excellent meal. To be honest, I was surprised to find the place packed shortly before 4. But standing in line just gave me more time to peruse the menu and decide exactly what I wanted. Given that my flight schedule made me to miss lunch, I was particularly hungry. And that's why I ended up having a three-course meal for ""linner."" The line itself threw me a bit, as it was two-sided. The left (and empty) side was reserved for take-out while the right side was filled with people waiting to eat there, as XOCO won't let you order until a table frees up. By the time it was my turn to order, I knew exactly what I wanted. And in the ten minutes I stood waiting, I enjoyed watching the kitchen staff finish prep and get ready for what was to be a busy Friday night.  Once I'd placed my order, I was led to a narrow counter in the middle of the cramped dining room. Almost immediately, parts of my meal started to show up. First came the chips and guac, which had amazing flavor and a silky texture. Despite the fact that I had two more courses to come, I managed to polish off the entire basket myself.  Next up was the Choriqueso torta, a hot sandwich that squeezed spicy housemade chorizo, roasted poblano peppers, jack cheese and a tangy salsa in between two pieces of spongy bread. Damn, it was good. But I stopped short of finishing because I was starting to feel the bloat and still had dessert coming.  Lastly, and quite a while after my sandwich arrived, my cafe con leche and churro showed up. While the greasy churro was my least favorite part of the meal, the coffee was as good (if not better) than what I've ordered in Miami and Puerto Rico. It was a terrific cup of Joe, which can probably be attributed to the Intelligentsia beans.  I really enjoyed my meal here and by the time I left I didn't even regret that I couldn't make it into Frontera or Topolo. I got a lot of great-tasting food for right around $20, plus still had time to get to O'Hare and make my flight. As an added bonus, I even saw Rick Bayless while I was there and that was kind of neat, too. It was nice to see some fancy-pants chef actually in one of his restaurants tasting the food before dinner service.  In any case, I'd definitely go back the next chance I have.

The complexity to the ordering and seating process was a bit unnecessary, and I assume the large queue they create is to create buzz. The vegetarian options were lacking, and the prices were horrifying. I assumed I was going to get something of great quality with a price that high. I was sure wrong! What I got was a salty mess and had to eat it in a cramped rowdy place getting bumped into all the time. To make things worse, when I told the cashier that I was looking for veggie options she twisted her face up like I was making some kind of bizzarre request, making me feel terribly uncomfortable.

And I have to admit I was surprised at Dennis S.'s seemingly harsh point of view, being a huge ""Dick Baymore"" fan myself. And then I fell victim to my own overactive imagination, picturing the place as a nice big square sit-down restaurant. So imagine my surprise when I entered a place with the feng shui of a bus station. I am no fan of long, skinny rooms, whether it's my old 9' x 20' train-car living room in a prior Evanston abode, or the old Garcia's in Lincoln Square, or Sel Marie's indoors, I just don't enjoy those spaces. XOCO has the feel of being on a tourist boat in the lake, especially with the central smoke stack-like structure which houses the restrooms in the middle of the dining room. Couldn't they have put those downstairs? I'd rather not have my torta followed by a flush. I chose to wait outside for my dinner companion, since the weather was nice. The good news is at 5;30 PM on a weekday, there was no line to speak of. I was impressed with the sheer number of employees who at the time, outnumbered the customers. Enthusiastic. Outgoing. Helpful and friendly were they. I salivated at the choices on the chalkboard. We settled for the Milanesa and the Pork Tortas, a side of chips and guacamole, a wine and a Bohemia. The guacamole was a little too salty. The tortas justified the drooling in line. While I wanted to save half of mine, I just couldn't. My dinner companion and I were trying to catch up after a long period of no contact, and XOCO was not the place to do that. It 's way too noisy and frenetic. You can feel those who were behind you in line hovering and waiting for your table. So we headed out to Flatwater  to sit outside and sip wine instead.  Had I better managed my expectations about XOCO, I probably would have enjoyed it more. The food and service was superb. I will, however, remain a big fan of Dick. I will shop at his discount shoe source, I will watch him on TV. I will make his recipes, and I will fantasize about being his neighbor in Bucktown and getting invited to a cookout.

While I sort of wish we would have just lined up for a full Frontera meal (Frontera has never failed us when we've been able to get in), XOCO was our plan and we stuck with it.  My seafood caldo ($12.50) was definitely four star, studded with four or five huge shrimp, meltingly tender fish lumps, about half a dozen mussels and chunks of a nice yellow potato, all in a beautiful balanced red broth of  maybe guajillo peppers and whatever else. The tasty hibiscus lemongrass agua fresca was intensely syrupy and was perhaps even better once I topped it off with some sparkling water (on tap). As I approached the water taps, they asked me if I wanted refills--I'm not sure if that meant I could have had more agua fresca for little or no additional charge. My husband had a chicken torta that he thought high-quality and nicely toasted.  He also ordered chips and salsa. The chips were excellent and tasted like they were made from homemade tortillas. The salsa tasted much like the grocery Frontera stuff, which is certainly good, but a bit more of it would have been welcome--it came with two tiny plastic containers (2 or 3 oz. each? I'm not sure--the size take-out tartar sauce usually comes in). The young women working the counter were super bright and friendly. Service was fast. A few quibbles. I didn't love the room--the colors are warm, some cute prints on the walls, sustainable materials, etc., but it felt pretty cold overall. If you take a table in the back, the swinging of the kitchen door is pretty constant (or maybe we were there at a shift change). My husband's Modelo was pricey. Lunch for two (two entrees, one basket of chips, one agua fresca, one beer) came out to be $34--certainly more than we usually spend for casual semi-fast-food lunches, but the quality was tops.

2010-04-07,3.0,"The food here is wonderful, and the interior is sleek and beautiful.  I'm giving the restaurant 3 stars based on my carryout experience. I usually stop here as an indulgence a couple of times a month on my way to work, before 8 AM.  I've ordered about half the menu, and carrier it out, and the food has always been fantastic.  My husband and I are long-time fans of Rick Bayless' fine dining restaurants, and the food at XOCO tastes every bit as good as (though it's different than) the dishes served next door. However, if you are visitng the restaurant, I really strongly recommend that you dine in.  Honestly, I don't think that they know how to do carry out that well.  They offer one size container, and a plastic bag, and they packed my ""breakfast special"" this morning in 3 separate containers (coffee cup,. large cardboard box, and small bag).  This made it very difficult to carry to my office, especially since I was juggling an umbrella in the rain as well. In addition, I've more than once had to wait 15 minutes or more for them to hand me my carry-out order, which makes me late to work.  Each time it happened, it looked as though the staff forgot about me, because (perhaps) they don't have a good system to keep track of the carryouts.  Each time it happened, I ordered something that was NOT in the case next to the register. The churro, empanada, and coffee in the special were fantastic (they make a great latte, and it's $1 less than Starbucks).  I will probably continue to occasionally get carryout from them, but will stick with a coffee and the premade baked goods (they make an excellent apple-pear muffin) so I'm not late for work. I would also consider bringing carryout home for dinner on the train for my husband, for special occassions such as his birthday, if we can't get a sitter to eat at the regular restaurant.   I'd probably ask questions about how the pack the hot items (such as soups) for travel and which items will travel well before ordering, however.

We got there and were faced with a 30-min. wait to get in this walk-up sandwich shop before even ordering.  The crowding, the prices and the racket were stifling. so I waited outside in disgust much of that time.  Then, all the ordering gab (all for a lousy sandwich)  was far too lengthy, noisy and more time-consuming than anyone but a ""trendy"" deserves.  I remarked to the multi-tasking, order-counter woman that she deserved combat pay and ear protectors to work here.  There were no sound-absorptive materials anywhere in this skinny space and the din was huge. We ordered and split a  short-ribs sandwich and had to perch on little stools at a narrow counter facing a wall for ages until it was delivered after more gab.  The sandwich was tasty but, hey, at $12 for a lousy sandwich costing $2 in Mexico City, it had better be.  All in all, it took us an hour-twenty or more to get in and out of this overpromoted, noisy madhouse for a street-food sandwich and my ears were still ringing!  When we left, the line of ""turistas"" was 50% longer and down the street. So, I guess that I'm a local, not a tourist, a trendy or a ""wanna-be"".  I am also an experienced, non-poor individual who does not feel, like some, that he needs to make reservations at a sandwich shop well in advance just to be hip. This place is an overpriced, overly-loud, touristy and hugely ineffecient sandwich shop which does not deserve any patronage.  Avoid it at all costs.  Better yet,  visit the street stalls in Mexico City as I have or the little, Mexican grills throughout Chicago which will give you real tortas with authentic taste for lots less without putting you through this hell-hole.",-0.9063,0.872,0.039,0.089,0.4562531565656567

The only con is that, at least on the weekends, by the time the caldos (soups) are served, the sit-down line is ~1hr+. Churros - Crispy, sweet, just a hint of chocolate.. almost funnel-cake like. mmmmm.. Cubano - The smoked pork loin is very tender and moist, and not too salty. The bacon and avocado really make the sandwich. Pepito - Very nicely braised short rib. As far as tortas go, though, I preferred the Cubana. Menudo (Saturdays) - perfect amount of spiciness, loved the tripe Mexican Chocolate Cupcake with Peanut Butter Frosting - the frosting was perfect! Not too thick, very light--the cupcake was really rich as well, but not too dense. Almendrado & Classic - perfect thickness of hot chocolate for me, but the almond milk in the almendrado really gave it a richness that I preferred over the classic. Barcelona - Good, but THICK! I think they add cornstarch to thicken up the chocolate. It's good though, but takes patience because it takes awhile to drink. That's my opinion though, because a friend of mine said it wasn't thick enough (compared to hot chocolate she had in Spain). To each her own.

Overall, service was excellent and very personal. The place was a third full.  I tried the following: - CHORIZO EGG TORTA: The torta reminded me of a panini. It was full of egg and guacamole with a good kick. I did not see any chorizo, so if must have been very finely chopped. The torta bread could barely hold its contents. Since I started with the churros, I had to take half of this to go. I ate the other half later in the day and noticed that it was a bit salty. - CHURROS: The churros were excellent. I don't go out of my way to find churros, but I can say they are almost as good as the churros I had in Barcelona. They were the right consistency, thickness, and crispiness. Since I like to dip them in chocolate, I prefer them to be coated in less sugar. A few taps does the trick, but leaves quite the sugar massacre on the table.  - BARCELONA HOT CHOCOLATE: I ordered the Barcelona because of the thick and rich description and I fully intended on dipping the churros in it, just like in Spain. I was disappointed at the flavor and consistency. Its texture was not smooth and the flavor was not deep enough. It did not lack in sweetness and was still decent for dipping.

The crisp, crunchy bread contrasts beautifully with the textures of warm/oozy goat cheese and soft/juicy mushrooms.  --TOMATO BROTH. Order it on the side. Totally worth it. I preferred dippin' this torta into the tomato broth as opposed to the 3-chile salsa. The flavours in the tomato broth are simpler, yes, but eating the uber crunchy torta slightly softened by the tomato broth just felt like a match made in heaven. Vegetables & Black Bean Caldo [woodland mushrooms, zucchini, potato-masa dumplings, black bean broth, spinach, avocado, serrano chile] --HEAT. Not temperature; spice. Not for the faint of heart! Next time I'm sick,  I'm heading straight for this soup. I'm sure it's capable of curing any illness. For real.  --SALTY. The potato-masa dumplings were the greatest thing about this dish. Initially thought I had bitten into a piece of plantain! However, the black bean broth was just too darn salty for me. Perhaps I'm hyper-sensitive to salt? Churros  bit.ly/c8Pi3C --Fell in love with churros the first time I tried them in Barcelona. bit.ly/bKCOrs  To this day I prefer them exactly the way I  had them the first time: smaller in size & plain/un-sugared.

2010-03-19,2.0,Just visited Chicago and had to try Xoco (Rick Bayless). It has potential but he needs to take his hand out of the salt jar!  The posole soup was way too salty!  Along with the specialty Xoco salad!  The torta (mushroom/goat cheese) was good.  We tried Frontera Grill  the night before and it was really delicious!  I think that's why I was so disappointed with Xoco.,0.8839,0.747,0.184,0.068,0.8375
2010-03-19,3.0,"Standing in line for 30 minutes for a sandwich is something I don't do too often, and I really wanted to love Xoco, my first venture into the Bayless empire. Well, it's no one's fault but my own that I didn't especially care for the torta I ordered. Perhaps it was the flavor palate (a little acidic) that wasn't my thing, but I will say the hot chocolate is a force to be reckoned with, and if they had one line for meals and one line for drinks and pre-made sweets, maybe I'd brave Xoco once more for a cup of cocoa, but standing in line for half an hour should only happen when the drink is so good you want to renounce all others of its kind, and I'm not there yet, Xoco.",0.9613,0.784,0.167,0.049,0.6653846153846155
2010-03-18,4.0,"The latest food trend in Chicago is not from any one culture or cuisine, it's called Standing In Line. Maybe this is our price to pay for eating high end food at a low end price point - but whatever the reason is, if someone like favorite son Rick Bayless tells you to do it, you just shrug and go to the back of the queue, knowing that what awaits you is bound to be good. The specialty here is the torta, which is a meat-filled sandwich.  For such a simple dish, the quality and preparation is key in separating the street-food from the haute-street-food.  XOCO succeeds - and once you have your food (and your table, and awkwardly timed and orchestrated event), you can see why Bayless's cooking is so revered.  The flavors are all good, not overwhelming, but done just so.  We shared the Ahogada or carnitas torta, which was supposed to be the best and made even more special by its dine-in only status.  It was good, but I didn't care for the fact that it was served in a bowl with sauce on the bottom, adding unnecessary sogginess.  The Pepito, or braised short rib torta, was amazing.  That is the one I would recommend to anyone - the meat was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the accompaniments were just perfect. I had a bite of the Churros (delicioso) and the Mexican Vanilla Ice Cream with Maple, Bacon and Pecan Streusel (muy muy delicioso), and I can tell you with conviction - save room for dessert. Is it worth it to stand in line?  I think so.  Would I go again?  Definitely.  There are 4 more wood-burning oven tortas that I have yet to try,  as well as 3 from the griddle, and I will do my best to dwindle down that list next time I am in Chicago. Note:  watch the time that you go, because not everything is available when you think it might be.  Breakfast till 10, Tortas only after 11am, and Caldos (soup) after 3pm.  Closed Sunday and Monday.",0.9977,0.768,0.209,0.023,0.5413958916900095

Rick Bayless himself was working at the counter so there were some added incentives. I had my doubt walking in because I didn't enjoy my dining experience previously at Topolobampo. Plus, I didn't exactly understand the whole ""quick service"" concept being an amateur consumer. Boy, was I in for at treat.  Decided to share Shortrib Red Chile Soup and Cubana sandwich with my friend and they were both fantastic. I've always been a fan of Mexican caldo and this one was definitely on the top of my list. Ended the dinner with some churros, hot chocolate and regular coffee. My friend was not a coffee drinker and you should have seen her face when she took the first sip. She loved it so much that she immediately ran over to Rick Bayless and shared the experience with him. To her delight, even Rick was surprised that they could woo the diners with their coffee. Churros were amazing as well, which has become my stable of comfort food every time I walk.

2010-03-12,5.0,"Dear BFF (in my dreams) Rick Bayless: Is there anything you can't do? Do you think in another life you were a Mayan chef to a king? I mean, seriously, when it comes to Mexican cuisine, is there anything you can't create? Can my partner Lynn and I come over and hang out and watch you cook? Have I asked enough questions? Can you call me, leaving a one word message ""tomatillo?""  I had sworn I would be first in line when XOCO opened last year but alas the crowds scared me away. I knew the space was tiny and had an oddly shaped long layout that only seats around 40 or so people so I just didn't want to stand in line outside for an hour. But on a recent Thursday night, my friend Zenmaster Daniel and I finally made it over to XOCO - perfect timing - 5:30 pm - no line! We ordered two tortas:  the ZM had the Ahodaga - golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce w/pickled onions which was good but didn't compare to my choice - the Thursday special torta - Mole Poblano:  Braised pork, wood-grilled onions, crunchy fresh garnishes w/fresh cheese. Scumptious! Mole aficionados be forewarned - this is not dripping with mole sauce. In fact, I asked the server if I indeed had the correct torta as I was expecting (my bad) that it would be drenched in mole. Nope. But it was so tasty and flavorful!  I was going to order the ""chips & salsa:  tomatillo salsa, 3-chile salsa w/just-made chips"" (because  you can't go to one of your establishments and NOT order something involving ""tomatillos""), however, we opted for the Frontera guacamole instead - because it is to die for - because it's like manna from the gods - because I want to slather it all over my body. Since the soups are large, the ZM and I split a caldos (which are only served after 3 pm). We chose the Shortrib Red Chile Soup - braised tallgrass shortribs, red chile broth, roasted vegetables, epazote, wild arugula and lime.  What can I say except outstanding - not to be missed! And finally, the moment this sweet eater had been waiting for all night:  homemade churros with a Barcelona - thick hot chocolate. I approached the churro with great trepidation as I am not a fan and had in fact told the Zenmaster that he could have the whole plate if I took one bite and hated them. Sweet Jesus, I have seen the light!  Three for $3, I would have paid $10 for these things. Served hot, moist, lots of sugar and also some nutmeg and/or cinnamon, they were fantastic. I am now craving them so bad......it's not funny, Rick. The Barcelona was perfect - it is not too sweet or sugary and is an excellent complement to the churros. Interesting concept of ordering at the counter and having it brought to your table - and they even took our dessert order at the same time and brought it out later without us having to ask.   People complain that the tortas are expensive ($9-12) but hell, they are the size of my head! And you know what? Our meal only came to $24 each for a ton of food which I had no problem with. And so, my dear BFF Rick darling, keep it comin' 'cuz we're gonna keep supporting you and your fabulous creations. Namaste,  Deborah E P.S. Next time you go to the Yucatan, can we go? No?

The right amount of crust and filling.  The breakfast torta with the chorizo was a little bland. Needed more flavor. The chorizo itself was really good.

My husband and I ordered food like it was our last meal on earth.  We ordered three tortas - pepito, the suckling pig, and the saturday special which was goat barbacoa.  We ordered two churros, the maple,bacon, pecan streusel ice cream, and an almond hot chocolate for dessert. I had the highest hopes for the suckling pig torta but it fell short out of the three. The goat was actually the most memorable and remarkable.  The pepito, although tasty, was safe, and able to be replicated with any good braised short-rib recipe.  FYI - a torta is a sandwich with tasty bread...it's crispy on the outside and soft in the middle.  It's not so crispy that it hurts the roof of your mouth but it's crispy enough to give your sandwich a good crunch and added texture.  I'd say the one thing missing from each sandwich is some raw onion.  The salsas accompanying each torta complimented the sandwich perfectly. The churros were good. Not too sweet, crispy, and have some other spices rather than just sugar crystals.  The most outstanding dessert was the maple bacon pecan streusel ice cream!! So tasty - salty, sweet, yummy.  It's as good as it sounds trust me!! Don't miss out on this. The hot chocolate, as explained by other yelpers, is not as sweet as american hot chocolate. I went in knowing this but was still surprised by how bitter it was.  It was thick and rich but not in the way that you would expect.  I might try a different version of hot chocolate next time I'm there.

2010-03-08,5.0,"I made plans to go here about a month in advanced.  One would think that this would be good planning but really considering it was pretty much right after spending a few wonderful days in Cabo, it might have been better to wait a little longer.  I went for lunch on a Saturday and as if Xoco was calling me, I was up at 7am that day.  That or my roommate was not home and didn't turn his alarm off and the paper thin walls did the rest of the work.   I arrived and the line was out the door.  Thankfully the other people I went with were already there and I got to cut about 10 people.  We waited outside for a few minutes and unfortunately the line gets absolutely no sunlight so it was colder than it seems.  We finally made it inside the first set of doors and I guess the hunger causes people to not think rationally as the people behind us all kept the door open even after the lady that worked there told them they could close it.  She was nice enough to give us menus so we could be as efficient as possible in ordering.  The menus basically made we want one of everything though, so I spent the next 30 minutes in line drooling and reading what farms the food they serve came from.   We got to the front of the line and I had my order all set to go.  We had to wait to order until a table was open though, but the cashier got us our drinks while we waited.  I made a rather large order of the woodland mushroom torta, an almendrado hot chocolate, chips and guac, and an apple/pear muffin that seemed to talk to me and explain why it would be better than the hazel nut chocolate cookie sitting next to it.   As we waited for our food, I passed the time by burning my mouth and tongue with the almendrado.  Despite my order, I don't really have a sweet tooth, but the almendrado was pretty good.  It was super almondy and towards the end it got a little over powering but it was still good.  My friend had hyped the hot chocolate here and so I just had to try it.  She said the Barcelona one she had from here was the 2nd best she has ever tried.  I guess that is on the list the next time I visit.   The chips and guac came out first and it immediately reminded me of my awesome trip.  The chips were fried up right there and super fresh.  They had a hint of lime and the guac was super tasty with some red peppers in it.   Then the tortas came out.  The woodland mushroom was spectacular.  The bread was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  There was a layer of black beans, then a huge layer of mushrooms, followed by some arugula and topped with a good helping of goat cheese.  The arugula and goat cheese are spectacular together and the mushroom medley was out of this world.  It was some combination of mushrooms, roasted garlic and just the right amount of spices.  The crispness of the bread makes eating this torta neatly almost impossible.  Unfortunately the silverware is up by where you put in your order and with all the drooling I was doing, I didn't see it until it was too late.   After housing the torta, I went on to the muffin.  It was actually really good, not too sweet and bursting with locally grown organic apples and pears.  After eating enough for two people, I was good.  I even decided against my plan of hitting up Art of Pizza after for a slice since I was in the neighborhood.  I don't turn down pizza often either!",0.998,0.822,0.147,0.03,0.5402503052503054
2010-03-08,5.0,"Every time I go to Xoco I am impressed. The food is so incredible, and they try to be consistently local and fresh - listing the farms they use for each product. So if you feel like it's a bit more expensive that some other Mexican-inspired fare, you can take comfort in supporting sustainable, high quality sources. I really don't think it's expensive at all for what you get. And I love watching the pastry chefs at work while waiting in line! When crowded, the flow of this restaurant is different from others, and I've watched people get frustrated with it, even complain. I think it's really efficient for the set up - just trust the servers (they're really good). There's basically 2 lines. If you want to eat there, stay to the right - against the wall. You'll wait to order, and when you get near the front someone will give you a number based on the size of your party. They've already found space for you to sit by the time you order. If you're taking it to go, you can go to the left and basically jump to the head of the line to order. Then there's an area back by the door where you can wait for your food to be prepared. The space isn't very intimate. There's a lot of bar style seating around the outer walls and a few tables that you may end up sharing with other parties. People seem to expect to have a table to themselves after waiting for a half hour, but the space is small, and they're trying to accommodate as many people as possible. But with food so delicious, I'd really expect nothing less than frequently crowded quarters. After ordering (or before if you're parched from waiting), there's a tap to help yourself to water - sparkling or still. I don't know why, but this is the best sparkling water I have ever had. They always have about 4 flavored waters steeping with ingredients like tamarind, watermelon, and lemongrass. They also have a good selection of beer and wine. The chocolate drinks are where it's at, though. All of them. The Aztec (with chile and allspice), The Almendrado (with almond milk), chocolate with a shot of espresso, or with a shot of homemade dulce de leche to make it thick and creamy - the list of options goes on. But I've never had a chocolate concoction that was bad at Xoco. The food- it's all amazing. But I have a hard time not ordering the Ahogada (in-house only, folks). A pork carnitas sandwich on a crunchy Labriolla bun turned face down in a bowl of tomato broth with spicy arbol chile sauce offered mild, medium or hot. So you sop up this delicious broth as you're eating the sandwich. It's unbelievable. The show stopper dessert is 3 churros with Mexican vanilla soft-serve. If you're eating in, and you order a cake, tart, or cookie - they'll give it to you when you order. If you order churros, ice cream, or a chocolate drink, they'll bring it out to you after you're finished with your meal. It's all delicious, really, but the hot cinnamon churros with cool vanilla ice cream wins. They have other sundae concoctions involving things like bacon and caramel, but I haven't made it that far into the menu yet. In short, the flow of the restaurant is perhaps not what you'd expect, but I'll bet you'd never expect food to be so delicious, either.",0.9977,0.835,0.149,0.017,0.5167220724767895

Eventually, our churros arrived sans hot chocolate - the hot chocolate that the cashier recommended for dipping the churros into. So, you guessed it, we waited. Eventually we ended up with more hot chocolate than we initially ordered, because of confusion in the kitchen, and cold churros. As we got up to leave, an employee raced over with a bag of piping hot churros, apologizing for all the waiting we had to do.

I've also tried the Almendrado hot chocolate and it was soo good. You can definetely taste that the chocolate is ground in-house. The churros are also great, though I have had better. My second time at Xoco I had the new vanilla soft-serve with maple-caramel-bacon topping. Wow, just wow is all I can say. I am a huge ice cream fan and this was just so creamy and smooth with a great vanilla flavor, complemented by the salty-sweet bacon caramel (though you can't really taste the bacon, it's just a great caramel topping).

While I'm surely no thinner thanks to my series of voraciously greedy feed-fests, I am pretty well versed now on all things fancy street fare a la XOCO-riffic. The good, the bad and the ugly look a little sumthin' like this:  The GOOD.  ~ Tortas, Tortas, Tortas! // Go absolutely crazy for these woodfired signature sandwiches that are the cornerstone of XOCO's offerings. The only hot item that is consistently available from 11am on, you can satiate your craving for all things meaty, cheesy and yeasty chock full of unique, fresh ingredients just about any time of day. Favorites are the Milanesa (though not as good as Cemitas Pueblas - sorry!) featuring super-crispy Gunthorp chicken, black beans, creamy jack cheese, pickled jalapenos and tomatillo-avocado salsa as well as the Wednesday ONLY Pork Belly torta special. Eat this! The blend of crunchy-skinned pork belly, dark salsa negra glaze, smoky bacon, punchy arugula and smooth queso anejo make this savory fiesta in your mouth one of the most individually awesome consumption experiences you'll find, certainly as far as sammies go. Mark your calendars! Wednesday is where it's at.  ~ Caldos aka Soups // Best.Soups.Ever.Really.No.Really. All you have to do is peep the pictures of these steamy creations to know they ain't your average broth, bisque, chowder, lather, rinse, repeat recipes. I feel like Señor Bayless dedicated the most amount of time to these masterpieces and the work certainly shines! The utmost in flavorful, satisfying, comforting deliciousness, each one is a meal in itself and utterly amazing. Can I pick just one favorite? Not really. But I will tell you the 'just by a hair' front runner may just be the Shortrib Red Chile Soup. With beautifully braised, huge pieces of Tallgrass shortribs, a zesty red chile broth, perfectly roasted vegetables, fresh and peppery wild arugula and, of course, lots and lots 'o lime, this soup is heaven in a bowl. Open up, say ahhh and sip on the things made of angels wings!  ~ Churros // Need I say more? Likely not. Fresh, made-to-order, hot, cinnamon and sugar laden churros are not to be missed. A side of Mexican vanilla bean soft serve sure doesn't hurt for dipping, either. Plus, it's just how Rick likes his... sign me up!  THE BAD.  ~ The Line // Long, slow, restless. Be prepared to wait. And wait. At peak times, bring a sleeping bag. Three trips combined earned me the ""spent a total 143 minutes in line merit badge"". Go Me. ~ Bean-To-Cup Chocolate // The XOCO version of hot chocolate. Gimmicky. Expensive. Unremarkable. Opt for the fresh fruit Aguas Frescas instead - refreshing!  The UGLY. ~ Caldos - Served After 3PM // Reread that. Then show up on a freezing, snowy day during your lunch hour yearning for a toasty, hot, delectable bowl of soup only to be told you have to come back after 3pm. Ya know, cuz so many of us eat lunch - um, or dinner - at 3, right? The sheer oddness of this timing is perplexing to say the least. Take the most popular (and revenue generating) menu items and make them completely inaccessible to the lunch crowd. Why? I'm sure there's good reason but I hate being told 'No Soup for You!'... ugh, bogus.  All in all, however, the experience is by far a positive - and very, very tasty one - plus the added bonus of a Bayless sighting is just enough to send any chef groupie to the moon. The lesson here?

Depending on your palate, it may not make you feel like fireworks just went off in your mouth, but it the love put into it is undeniable.  The prices are not really high (average $12) but the portions could be a little bigger for the cost.  The real reason that XOCO doesn't get 5 stars is the lack of parking and long lines .

2010-02-14,4.0,"Oooh Rick Bayless, you've done it again!  I first found out about Xoco when I visited Frontera next door. I've been a HUGE FAN for Mexican food since I met my bf last year (he's Mexican, and an amaaaazing chef) and even though it's been less than a year, you know you are in good hands when your bf makes authentic Mexican dishes from his family recipes!   Needless to say, I am pretty picky and quick to judge when it comes to trying new Mexican restaurants. We went to Xoco on Friday night after hearing all the raves about their Churros. It was cold out and we were starving! We finally got to Xoco (around 6:45pm), and a line has already formed! A server came over and informed us that you can jump to the cashier to order if you were getting a Takeout, but the line was about 25min for dine-in. Not too bad, the server was friendly and told us we could get drinks while we wait in line too. 1st bonus: Xoco offers free water, classic or sparkling! I don't think I've ever seen FREE sparkling water on tap, ever! While we wait in line, we had a really hard time deciding what's the best torta or caldo to get. Playing around with a few choices: Torta Ahodaga, Pepito or Pibil from the woodburning over?  Or Torta Milanesa from the grill?  But the Shortrib Red Chile Soup & Pork Belly Vemicelli looks amazing too... Not to mention the dessert list: Churros + soft-serve is a must get, I know that already. But how about the Choco Flan, chocolate hazelnut cookie, or the buttery shortbread cookie?!  In the end, we picked Torta Ahodaga and Torta Pepito, + churros con gelato & choco flan! According to my bf, Torta Ahodaga is a hard one to crack:  the carnita meat has to be slowly roasted for the perfect, stringy texture without it been overly chewy/sloppy, and the spicy arbole chile sauce is hard to perfect!  We figured that's a good choice to make-or-break Xoco on our list.  2nd Bonus:  While we wait in line, it was really cool to see all the chalk-boards lined up listing different restaurants where Xoco gets their daily ingredients from.  Now we know everything is organic and freshly gazed, I feel less guilty about having a huge meal!  Finally, we got to the front of the line and were ready to order! I was impressed by the beer selection, they had an assortment of microbrewey beers like Three Floyds / Bells, and a Mexican Beer that my bf hasn't seen in the U.S. (6years & 5 cities!). The agua del dia was Pineapple,Mint & limon. I'd definitely be back just for their beverage pairing.  Be careful though, when you are at the counter.. the dessert list grows with daily special on display!! Aah, now that we've been seated it's time to look around. The walls were painted maize & blue, with framed artistic photos capturing elements of life in Mexico, the loud salsa music overhead was a great addition too!  It took ~10min for our food to be served, and oooooooh how that Torota Ahodaga hit the spot!  The Torta Pepito was great, but it lacked the kick I expected from those pickled jalapenos. The choco flan was actually pretty good, but we were underwhelmed by the churros. The churros had way too much sugar coating with waaaay too little cinnamon!  For authentic churros, you have to make a trip down to Pilsen & check out Nuevo Leon Bakery & La Baguette.    3rd Bonus:  The chef's verdict is that the food are really authentic, especially with the spices used! For a moment, my bf actually felt like he was buying from the street vendors in Mexico city! The desserts were only 3stars though. To be fair, you should be prepared when coming to Xoco:  long lines during lunch/dinner rush, amazing entrees but underwhelming desserts, and it will be 5-10min before you can get the server's attention.  Given that Xoco is the ""fast-food"" version of Bayless' restaurants, the service is way more than what you should expect.  Lastly, this is a pricy dinner running $15-$20 per person depending on what you order. You can definitely get equally great / better food for much less in Pilsen without the long line!",0.9992,0.799,0.181,0.02,0.5102579599332846

I went with a bunch of friends so I tried a few items. Everything was over salted. My soup was so over salted that I should have sent it back. However, since I'm vegetarian there wasn't even another option for me to replace it with if I did send it back (well, there is a veggie sandwich but we already had one of those).

I am really thankful I came on a Friday night around 5:30 and didn't have to deal with the crazy crowds that are there for lunch.  Even so, by 6:00 or so, the line was sneaking out the door.  I can't for the life of me figure out why, and I can't say I'd be inclined to come back to figure it out. I ordered the Gunthorp Chicken Torta.  I got through half of it before I could no longer convince myself it was just ""different"" rather than covered in a sauce I could not choke down.  My dining buddy ordered the Milanesa, which was slightly better, but nothing I'd ever want to deliberately eat again. The chips and guac were good, but so are the chips and guac at about a million other places.  So that would never be a reason to me to wait through a 40 minute line.  Same goes for the churros.  I had one just because I figured I wouldn't be back and that I should give it a try while there.  Meh.  Maybe I made a mistake in not going for the soups instead?  Beyond the food, the set up is bizarre.  There seem to be two separate lines for people who are just coming in, with another one for those who've been there and want to add more to their orders.  When I went back up to order a churro, I got nasty looks from people in the bigger line.  There is no crowd control so sitting in the restaurant to eat isn't exactly pleasant (but I won't hold that against them as I get that they were going for a nice dining-in experience) although I DID enjoy the music, which reminded me of a day at my favorite Mexican resorts.   Not impressed.  But at least now I know :) MAYBE I'll come back another time to give other categories on their menu a try, but you couldn't pay me to wait in a long line to do so.  Guess I'm just not a Bayless fan, but I can live with that.",0.8561,0.826,0.096,0.078,0.48324074074074075

It was a unique broth, a bit too salty for my tastes but I did enjoy the sesame seeds in it. As for the crispy fried pork belly in it..meh. It was my first time trying it and it was way too fatty for me. We couldn't resist the hot chocolates. I tried the almond milk one which was better as I kept on sipping it. The one without milk was more sour than rich and creamy. Last comment-the cinnamony shortbread cookie was sooooo good. I wish the wait wasn't so long...kind of defeats the purpose of this place.

So last Saturday I was running errands downtown by myself and walked right past it a little after noon and thought, ""Go! Now!""  I got there juuuust before a big crowd came, around 12:15, 12:30pm. Even then I was in line for a good 20 minutes, but there was so much to look at and figure out, that I didn't mind at all. I picked up a menu on the way in and began to immediately salivate, reading over the descriptions. Everything looked so savory and spicy. I was so happy to see they served wine by the glass and cold beer in a cooler up front. I was in this wrap around line which looks right into the kitchen area. It was fun and informative to watch each order being prepared and garnished. I also liked that they stopped letting people order when there weren't any more seats. I knew when I placed my order that I would have a place to sit. I'm a sucker for soups and that day they were serving a Cream of Almond soup that had some spices and peppers it in. Oh man. Just the right amount of heat and tons of flavor. It was fun to sit by a window, people watch and sip wine as my food kept coming to me.  Next up was the Cubana Torta. This had smoked pork loin, bacon, black beans, avocado, artisan Jack and chipotle mustard- WOW!!   Such simple ingredients yet such phenomenal taste! My mouth was in love with this sandwich. It came out hot and gooey and I ate it so so slow as to savor every bite. I had the 2nd half wrapped to go and walked around downtown for another 5 hours with this thing carefully lodged in my purse so I could enjoy it all over again later that evening. The staff was friendly and helpful. They had someone there at every turn to talk me through where I was supposed to go and inform me of what was happening next. I really appreciated that. I have kept the menu in my purse all week and have pulled it out a couple times on the train.

She had suggested it because she was a big Rick Bayless fan, and I had always been intrigued by the lines winding out the door when I passed by about a month ago. Luckily I got their early and was able to wait in line until she showed up (total wait time 30minutes). I spotted Rick Bayless himself tasting some soup while I was waiting in line so I figured everyone would be in top form tonite, well I was wrong! The chicken torta I ordered: Too much avacado ( and I'm a huge avacado fan), burned bread and some type of ultra spicy chipotle added to mask the chicken flavor completely! She ordered a Mushroom torta and was less than impressed. Beyond that we got the sub-par service. I realize that restaurants need to maximize their available space, but sitting at a counter facing a wall next to the backroom where the staff is coming and going is just tacky! My friend asked for some sugar for her tea and the staff told her to go around the corner and get it herself, along with napkins and forks. With all the hype and the cramming in of people the least the staff can do is make an attempt to set the table! The price is comparable to Panera/Corner Bakery and frankly, I feel more relaxed and welcome there. We were looking for a place to catch up and sample some Unique food.

The habanero salsa was hot, so go easy on it but it really brings out all the flavors. Everyone was more than happy with their tortas and caldos. We all got hot cocoas and split some churros for dessert.  I got the Barcelona with a Dulce de Leche shot and I could not finish it. It was delicious but super rich. That and a couple of churros could have taken the place of an entire meal. Although leaving feeling pretty overstuffed, I'm quite certain I dreamt of the meal. I had to have more! On my way to the airport the next day I risked missing my 1:15  flight home and took my chances by going back for lunch :) The XOCO salad with carnitas was hands down the best salad I have ever eaten. Black beans, crispy tortillas, avocado lime dressing, yum!! I had to bring home evidence of this magical place, so I got a box of breakfast treats to take home to my wife.

Rick Bayless may have found himself a new fan.  Now back to the Pepito--braised shortribs, caramelized onions, artisan Jack cheese, black beans, pickled jalapenos and tomatillo salsa on the side--whooooooaaaaa mama!  Let's start with the bread--hollowed out toasted baguette, crunchy on the outside and soft from the shortrib juices inside. Shortribs--perfectly cooked, tender, and juicy. Caramelized onions--I am NOT an onion person, I avoid onions like the plague--but these onions didn't taste like onion, they tasted like cabbage, I ate every single last piece. The pickled jalapenos and tomatillo salsa gave the whole thing a nice little kick! Guacamole and chips were fantastic, chips had a hint of lime and guacamole was tasty, smooth, and creamy. This time I paired my churros with an almond-flavored hot chocolate--good but a little too thick and syrupy for my taste. The almond flavor is really strong--it's an acquired taste. Service was excellent from the hostess who directed us to our seats to the bus boys who brought out the food and made sure we had everything we needed. Seating is extremely limited so I suggest going during the week--I didn't have to wait in line even at 6 pm. Luckily, some of the hype has died down so it's less crowded.

It wasn't too cold, so a friend and I waited in line for about 15mins (outside) and 20mins (inside), so not too bad. I liked the fact that they seat you, and you're not given an order number until a table is available. So while it allows the wait line to grow, it's much better than waiting with your food for a table to open up.  By the time we got to order, it was past 3pm so we could order caldos (yes!). All winter I've wanted to try the pozole, so I definitely ordered the chicken pozole (medium heat). I also ordered a choriqueso torta and short rib caldo to go (for the hubby at home/dinner that night). Also, since we were on a full pig-out spree, we also got 3 churros and a hot chocolate. LOVED that they asked if we wanted the hot choc and churros after our meal!  We were seated at the ""bar"" type seating, which is a bit awkward since your nose is a foot away from the wall in front of you, but eh, I'll take it. The food took about 10mins to arrive which is pretty fast given the volume. My pozole was a hot, comforting, perfectly-seasoned (quite spicy!) bowl of broth with organic chicken and hominy. A few condiments on the side, sprinkled on top and it was so delicious. Exactly what I wanted after a hardcore workout and 35min wait. My friend ordered the choriqueso torta and loved it as well. It smelled delicious (good to know, since it was what I ordered to-go).  Anyhow, once we were done with our lunch, we packed the leftovers, and then they brought out our hot chocolate and churros.

For entrees, XOCO specializes in two things: Tortas (Mexican sandwiches) and Caldos (meaty soups). I had the Pepito torta which had Braised Tallgrass shortribs, caramelized onion, artisan Jack cheese, black beans, and pickled jalapenos. If that sounds awesomely good, it's because it is. The meat was so juicy and tender and the pickled jalapenos added a kick that made me wanting more. The tortas were cooked in a wood-burning oven which added a nice rustic taste to the sandwich. I also tried the Carnitas caldo which was just as good. With the temperature below zero, this definitely hit the spot. The soup was so hearty with meats, veggies, and dumplings in a spicy broth, it puts Campbell's Chunky Soups to shame.  The party didn't stop there. The stars of the evening were the churro and the hot chocolate. Hands down, BEST CHURRO EVER. It was even better than the ones at Great America and those were hard to top. The hot chocolate was so deliciously rich I felt like covering myself with a blanket and taking a nap after drinking it.

2010-01-28,4.0,"XOCO was my first Rick Bayless experience and I must say it lived up to the hype (and believe me, there was a lot of hype).  We had a couple tortas, a soup and guac and it was all amazingly delicious.  Especially the guac...my tummy is growling as I write this. Can't say much more about the yummy food, so thought I would address two of the complaints I've heard a lot:  the portion size and the wait.  First, I had heard that the tortas were small and that you had to order two.  Not true at all.  I was stuffed and couldn't even finish mine.  I wanted to take half home, but unfortunately its not quite made for carry-out.  Three of us shared the guac and I must admit that I felt the portion there was small for the price.  Definitely not enough for 3 people considering I could have had it all to myself. Second, the wait. Now, I've only been here once and it was a little cold and snowy, but it was a friday night around 7p and there was no wait at all when we got there.  I don't know if it was luck of the draw or the weather, but I feel pretty lucky to not have had to wait.  That being said, it's worth at least a half hour wait, maybe more.  I would definitely go back.  Though I think I might have to try out Frontera next.",0.9757,0.837,0.132,0.031,0.5123188405797102
2010-01-28,5.0,"I have a secret PBS crush on Rick Bayless . . . so of course we had to try his food.   Definitely the highlight of our trip. Showed up around 11:30 and stood in line a good 30 minutes. At least while standing in line you can watch the kitchen do their thing. You can peek inside the oven and watch the torta makers put on toppings.  You order at the counter, take a number and they bring your food to you.  I normally dislike this type of service especially when it's crowded. People end up saving tables and there is wasted chairs and space. But the hostess makes things much more pleasant. She controls the seating and doesn't hand you a number to order unless there is a space for you to sit. Once we figured out that is what was going on, we relaxed and didn't stress about getting a table.  We ordered the mushroom torta (the ONLY vegetarian option - disappointed in that!), the Saturday special torta, guac and chips, a churro, and an Aztec hot chocolate.  Everything was amazing. It tasted different but better than any Torta ( in comparison to San Diego style) then I've ever had. I didn't know you could oven roast them! The toppings besides the meat were a bit on the skimpy side. The meat was really the star of the sandwich.  Even though they hand you a number and bring you your food, they provided the extra nice touch of waiting to bring dessert and the hot chocolate till we asked for it to be brought out. No rushing, no awkward plates, no churros going cold.  I also LOVE FREE SPARKLING water  (and still) on tap! Lots of people were drinking it while waiting in line. It helped to subside the hunger pains. Thanks for using biodegradable cups too!!!!  I really wish we could go back after 3 PM and try to soups!

2010-01-28,5.0,"This was my first Rick Bayless dining experience, save for the occasional Frontera salsa and chips I've been known to pick up at the grocery store. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. Went here in the 1P hour yesterday and there was barely a line...Granted, it was absolutely freezing outside, so maybe people didn't want to brave the elements to get some eats. Oh well, their loss! I had the Almendrado (bean-to-cup chocolate drink: chocolate and almond milk), churros and split the guacamole and chips. Everything was quite tasty. The Alemndrado was brought out hot, texture was nice and velvety, flavor was smooth and sweet. Seriously, it was probably the best hot chocolate I've ever had...Quality stuff, nothing about it tasted artificial. Mmm... Prior to tasting the churros at XOCO, my only experience was having them at the Mexican corner store in the neighborhood where I grew up. The corner store churros were room temp, probably sitting out for god knows how long. Granted, I liked them--what's not to like about sugar on fried-dough? But the XOCO churros blew them out of the water. They came out fresh out of presumably the fryer, warm, rolled in a cinnamon-sugar mixture. Soooo good. I swear, I felt like I was being so bad eating those, but it felt so good all the same... The chips and guacamole were very good as well. Lots of very nice flavors--cilantro, onion, some sort of spice...maybe chipolte? Whatever it was, top notch! Tasted very fresh! I just wished the serving of guacamole was maybe a tablespoon larger...I always hate it when you run out of dip before the chips are gone! Everything was a good value for the money...The chocolate was $3.25, chips and guac $4, churros 3 for $3. And I was impressed that they sold beer--had some on ice at the counter for grab and go! And good stuff, too! I spied Matilda, some Metropolitian offerings, and good ol' Robert the Bruce (of Three Floyds fame-NWI represent!). If I was in the drinking mood, it was nice to know my options!

2010-01-27,4.0,"For me it is all about the short-rib sandwich. Really one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. And yes, I say ""sandwich,"" because it is served on French bread baked in Chicago, which is an English-speaking city. I also do not ask for the ""Gunthorp chicken."" I do not want anything called ""Gunthorp"" on my sandwich. I do not say all of this because I am an ignorant, anti-green, gringo with a limited cultural viewpoint, but because I feel that there is a fair bit of pretention that goes into this joint, and that that pretension directly effects the prices; prices which mean that I can only eat lunch here once a month, even though I work two blocks away.  So I say a big fuck you to the bratty white culinary school cashier who always corrects me by saying ""you mean on your torta?"" when I ask for the short rib sandwich. If we were in Mexico, or even in a Mexican restaurant in a Mexican neighborhood, I would of course have the respect to ask for a torta, and I would use my best spanglish to do so. But this is not a place that was made for people in Pilsen or other any other Spanish-speaking barrio in Chicago- and little could most people in these neighborhoods -much like myself- afford this unfortunately titled cuisine.  This place was made for yuppies and business people -mostly gringos- who inhabit one of the richer areas of the city.

The pepito torta (braised short rib sandwich) was well prepared but surprisingly bland, even topped with artisan jack and pickled jalapenos.  Would return to try other items on the menu and for the warm and buzzing vibe.",0.9208,0.85,0.15,0.0,0.48935185185185176

Went around 8pm on a Friday night, and had to wait nearly 50 mins for a table for 5 people... but honestly, that was to be expected. We were kept entertained by the great beer selection (Matilda, anyone?) and the extensive menu.  First: the guacamole looks tiny but is incredibly delectable. It isn't watered down with fresh tomatoes, and is just creamy tasty goodness with the crispy, well-seasoned chips.  I had a pork belly vermicelli caldo for the main event. Rick Bayless, a man after my own heart. That hot, sweet, savory experience of a caldo, combined with the bites of duck caldo, and pepito torta that I tried, made the perfect entree experience. Lastly, the churros y chocalate... OBV a must-try. The churros are fried crispy and crunchy with sugar. And well, the hot chocolate...  Heaven. You know it's real when the chocolate isn't sweet - just pure rich _chocolate_. Perfect for dipping and sipping. And all so incredibly affordable.

I found it to be a bit salty but given the restaurant is inspired by Mexican-street food, shouldn't it be a little salty? The meat and roasted veggies complimented each other perfectly and melted in my mouth. My dining companion had the Jamon and I was drooling watching him eat it.

2010-01-23,5.0,"Well. I am sort of kind of totally obsessed with Mexican food, and I have a total crush on Rick Bayless' cooking. I mean, the man was on Top Chef All Stars! I wouldn't call myself a foodie, as I can happily eat White Castles and sushi in the same weekend, but I still love to eat good stuff. And since XOCO is way more affordable than Frontera Grill or Topolobampo, I figured this would be a good way to experience Mr. Bayless. We went a day or two after New Year's. Luckily it wasn't very crowded. It was on a Monday, and XOCO isn't usually open on Mondays, so maybe we just tricked the crowd. Also it was around 3:30, kind of a weird time to be eating. We got there and the scary line everyone hears about wasn't that bad.  BUT! OH SNAP GUESS WHAT I SAW. Rick Bayless was THERE. I could have just left without eating and fangirled myself back home, but we had come all that way, so my friend calmed me down and we got down to the business of deciding what to get. We ordered the carnitas sandwich and soup with carnitas, which they graciously allowed us to split. Gave us two separate bowls and everything!  The sandwich was in a sort of spicy red sauce that I would happily eat as soup. That made the thick bread a little more manageable. The flavors were delicious and I almost wished I could have eaten the whole damn thing myself! The soup was great too. Light and fresh with tender pork and little bits of avocado. The squeeze of lime really pulled it all together. As we were finishing we were asked if we wanted any hot chocolate. Of course we had ordered churros, so it didn't take much convincing to add hot chocolate onto the meal. I got the Aztec style with the hot spices mixed in. Very interesting and a perfect compliment to the crunchy sweet churros. If the only churros you've had are the ones you get normally around Chicago, please do yourself a favor and get some at XOCO, they are worlds different. Talk about melt in your mouth! I definitely want to go back. The menu isn't huge, but I want to try everything. I might not even share. It's that good.

It looked liked a sandwich halfway soaked in marinara sauce and it was rich, so salty, flavorful, and dense.  I loved it and could not have imagined a more filling sandwich.  The Jamon was eaten by several of my friends and on top of that sandwich was a fried egg - indulgence like whoa...The guac was totally fresh and lovely - tastier than guac I've had at Chipotle, that's for sure.  While the line situation/seating situation is not ideal as you order at the register and wait for seating/your food, it was incredibly fun and the food was so worth it.  Rick Bayless never disappoints.",0.9896,0.715,0.255,0.03,0.5763888888888888

More specifically: my friend and I were sitting brainstorming for a commercial script she had to send the next morning and we sat on hi-top style chairs by the window and had awesome convo in a cozy yet lively environment. Salsa and a few other Hispanic genres were playing a little on the loud side throughout the restaurant but I didn't mind because; any excuse to feel like I'm not the only Cuban in Chicago :). It was like 8-9pm on a Thursday night which also makes it ok. I've heard of lines but we didn't experience any.  Almendrado was great. It's an almond-ish hot chocolate. Very distinct taste so you may or may not like it. It's thick yummy goodness.  Churros- 3 for $3 I think? I have to be snooty and say that I'm from Miami so I'm used to roadside 10 for $1 from a dude in a hat, a styrofoam cooler and a Sharpie advertisment. That aside, they were pretty great, overloaded with what looked like brown sugar and sprinkled with little specks of chocolate.  Tip: Dip the churros in the Almendrado for a burst of goodness in your mouth!! Now I know why it always smells like chocolate near the Chicago stop on the brown line.

2010-01-14,5.0,"Two visits, nearly two hours in line (45 min to an hour each time) and I have no regrets. The food, by all accounts, is fantastic.  On my first visit I had the Choriqueso torta. That homemade chorizo flavor really runs the thing. There is a sort of tanginess to it too that I have to admit I'm a little unsure of, whether or not I really liked it I mean, but it definitely wasn't a bad thing. Very tasty.  Visit two brought me to the Ahogada torta. This thing was pretty much amazing. The tomato broth, which I ordered spicy, had the wonderful effect of softening up the bread of the torta while just soaking it in flavor. That tangy flavor I mentioned above was in this sandwich too, I'm thinking it had something to do with the pickled onions, but it was much more subdued this time and definitely overpowered by the spice and flavor of the broth. I will definitely be ordering this again. The place that I think XOCO really shines, however, is in the little side dishes. The chips are great. Not too salty, good size and good flavor. The salsas are extremely flavorful with wonderful colors. The guacamole is excellent, truly top-notch stuff. And, of course, the churros. Hands down the best churro you will ever taste in your life. The bread is soft and doughy and hot when they bring it out. The cinnamon and sugar and other special substances on top are perfectly mixed. Churros had been a topic of discussion for me and my wife before coming to XOCO. I have good memories of them from my childhood while she notoriously dislikes them as the most bland quasi-desert in existence. XOCO fixed all that. Not bland and definitely desert caliber (rather than a simple snack). We have tried a couple of the hot chocolates, but I have to admit that I haven't found the one I like yet. It's not that the ones I've had weren't good, they were, but just nothing to write home about. Almost more strange in flavor and consistency than anything else. Try one, you'll see what I mean. As far as service and decor go, I'd say they're both about average for the quick-serve environment. The staff does seem hurried all the time, but not upset about it. Maybe a little impersonal as a result though. The decor is, well, forgettable it seems as I don't remember much except the Bayless books in the windows. It doesn't matter anyway. If they served this food in a cardboard box there'd still be a line out the ... uh ... front flap, I guess. Oh and we did see Bayless in the restaurant on our first visit.

All we came for was the churros and hot chocolate.  Bravo!  Hot, sweet, chewy churros and smooth, silky hot chocolate.  I love that there was no milky after-taste from the hot chocolate (history lesson: the Aztecs drank pure chocolate with a bit of water and spice, not that over-sweetened, milky stuff that every one is (unfortunately) so used to).  Aaand, guess who we saw?  The chef, himself!  Mr. Bayless was kind enough to take a picture with my sister and I, how cool. Second visit, dinner time.  Early/mid December '09, went with 2 friends, waited maybe 20 or 30 minutes to order and be seated.  Had the Pepito torta, sans jalepenos.  Deee-licious!  The meat was so tender, almost dissolved in my mouth (I'm trying to make it sound good), and the onion, cheese and beans just worked so well together.  I can't remember the brand of hard cider they have (available in a 21 or 22 (can't remember) ounce bottle), but it's so smooth.  I am a fan of hard cider, and can hardly find it around, so I was ecstatic to see that XOCO serves it!

When you hit up a Chicago hot spot like Hot Doug's, Kuma's Corner and Xoco you are going to wait it is just that simple. Some people think they are too good to wait in line. If you are one of these people, don't come to Xoco. You are much too important to wait in line.

We both had the Ahodaga Torta: Golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, pickled onions. You can order the tomato broth mild, medium or hot. I went with hot and it really spiced up the sandwich although it was hard to eat the tomato broth independent of the sandwich. We ended with an order of churros. When I first heard from Johnny B that we were ordering churros I immediately thought of sitting at US Cellular watching a White Sox game and eating a greasy churro.

Gunthoro chicken sandwich had a nice flavor, but way too many onions and the squishy ingredients slid right out of the hard crunchy bread every time I took a bite, making a big mess.

Sad, frozen pastries that have been reheated and are overpriced, but that you occasionally buy anyway in a fit of delusional optimism or out of a desperate need for carbs in which anything made of dough and dusted in sugar will do. 4= costco churro. Fresher. But just a pleasant pastry, as opposed to the delectable delight that a churro could be. 8 = fresh churros in Mexico. You watch them get fished out of a vast pot of boiling oil. Sprinkled with sugar, and put into a brown paper bag that quickly turns translucent with grease.  Your delight in the deliciousness is slightly tempered by the knowledge that this is really, really bad for you. 10 = xocos. These had all the freshness of Mexican churros, without the grease. And, bonus, in addition to granular sugar and cinnamon, they are crusted with little pieces of Mexican chocolate for extra flavor.  Truly, truly amazing. Rick, open a churro window.  Seriously, that huge line waiting for food and a place to sit, how many of them would happily fork over their cash for a quick churro?  You could serve churros as fast as you could scoop them into a paper bag, and have so so many more happy customers every day.  Churro window.

What I love so much about the Rick Bayless empire on North Clark is that despite their being 3 Bayless Mexican restaurants next-door to one another, they're all different from one another to a point where you could eat three consecutive meals, one at each spot, and not feel as though you've had anything repetitive.  Topololobampo is definetly your upscale/date night out, Frontera Grill is made for fun night out with friends, and XOCO is your new Mexican comfort food eatery, probably best for lunch or a late afternoon bite.  It's perfect for someone looking for an authentic yet convenient, affordable Rick Bayless dining experience.   Be prepared to wait -- XOCO doesn't take reservations and while I've talked to others who have waited for an hour and a half or more, my wait was only about 30 minutes.  XOCO is a place where you wait in line, soaking in the smells and drooling over the menu, until you place your order at a counter.  You're seated by a hostess and your food, all of which is prepared fresh and to-order, is brought to you in about the same amount of time you'd expect at any other restaurant.  Kind of an interesting blend between ""fast"" food and a restaurant experience.  The dining room seats about 40 or 50 -- best for smaller groups, ideally between 2 and 4.  We started with the chips and guacamole and split two tortas, the ahogada and the choriqueso.   Both were delicious, though the ahogada came highly recommended by the host and it definetly lived up to the hype.  Was told to try the Pork Belly Vermicelli caldo next time, which I am absolutely planning on doing.  For dessert, we had the housemade churros and classic hot chocolate, which is made from fresh mexican cacao beans ground right there in front of you.  I'm not sure there are words for how rich and decadent that stuff was -- an absolute must-have!

I then vowed that I would kidnap Mister Bayless and force him to make me guacamole every day, from the confines of my sunroom. This didn't happen because he had to go write a book or go to Mexico a few hundred times and win Top Chef Masters and then open Xoco. I have been to Xoco twice. And here is what I've learned: - If there is a soup of the day, get it. Just do it. - GET CHIPS AND GUAC WHILE YOU WAIT. - Because you will wait. - Depending on the time you go, your wait could be an hour (noon) or 5 minutes (2:30pm). - And that's just for a table. - Be prepared to wait about 15 minutes for your food to show up. - You will probably SEE Mister Bayless walking around, generally being the man. - Sometimes I wish Rick Bayless was my dad.

2009-12-23,3.0,"I have long worshipped at the sacred altar of Bayless. With reverential care, I view my edition of ""Rick Bayless's Mexican Kitchen"" as my dogeared, sauce splattered dinner party Bible, which has sated many a palate. Chicago owes him a great debt for contributing to the establishment of the city as a premier dining Mecca. The world at large owes him heaps for shattering the concept that ""Mexican"" is simply interchangeable with Taco Bell, football sized tacos and Tex-Mex fajitas, and proving it instead to be one of the most diverse, rich and historical cuisines around. Sure he's a Gringo, but he's done the legwork. While I'm happy for his recent Top Chef Masters win, it troubles me the way the Food Network makes movie stars out of chefs. I am unconvinced that the endlessly long lines here at Xoco are primarily driven by a need for authentic Mexican street fare. The frenzied riot gathering on Clark Street seems instead to be in line for a Brad Pitt sighting, or a Johnny Depp premiere. That said, while I have enjoyed my several visits to Xoco, having eaten authentic Mexican street fare a great many times, I think Bayless is doing himself a disservice referring to the grub here as that. The offerings here are certainly inspired by, and share names with, the food widely available in their delicious natural state in Mexican markets and bus-stops but frankly can never hope to be so ephemeral. Poshified ingredients, tamed spice, and an easy hand of chiles hamper as opposed to elevate; and I find myself wanting more. But, I still have to hand it to the man... when people leave here having tasted something new and interesting, and can view ""Mexican"" as culinary brilliance for the first time, as opposed to a tepid cuisine of hard-shell tacos, he is doing his job and spreading the Gospel. Amen to that.",0.9958,0.744,0.205,0.05,0.43424983424983427

Xoco is AMAZING!  I've been too scared and distrustful of Frontera Fresco at Macy's, because I just don't know if I can trust the food at a food court to be the same and because Rick Bayless isn't there to oversee things.  However, Xoco is right next to the other two restaurants, and Rick Bayless is right in the next kitchen.   I had the Cubana sandwich, guac and chips and two churros, all to go.  I wanted to try the house-made ice cream and the agua fresca, but I was running to work in Hyde Park, and I can only hold so much food while traveling on CTA.  I also didn't want things to get cold.  So, I went out the door, took a cab a few blocks (I was running late, didn't want to miss my bus), and I started with one of the churros on the cab.  So delicious.  I could taste the dough used for the churro which isn't usually the case with a churro.  It was cooked to perfection, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, mmm. Then I was waiting for my bus, but I just kept thinking about how the longer I waited the more cold air must have been seeping into my to-go bag and cooling my warm sandwich down.  I couldn't take it anymore.  I sat down, opened the box, poured some of the tomatillo sauce on half of my sandwich, and I dug in.  It was still really warm, and absolutely perfect.  Hands down the best torta I've ever had.  So, while my experience at Frontera was good, I gotta say, Xoco blew me away with it's torta!  Also, it was one of the kitchen staff's birthdays when I was in there.  The staff all came to him with a dessert singing happy birthday.  It was nice to see they all cared.  Happy 21st Travis! (that was his name) I'm going back next week for more and next time I'm sitting down to eat my meal and I'm ordering my ice cream, my hot chocolate, my torta, and maybe the agua fresca too.

I see why the wait here is short(er).  The food, while good, is overpriced and overhyped.  My partner and I got guacamole, a soup, a sandwich, a cookie, and a hot chocolate.  Total bill: $35. First off, that's a pretty stiff bill for a simple dinner for two.  The soup (the chicken one) was super salty.  The sandwich (jamon torta) was just ok, but nothing special.  The guacamole was pretty small and delicious -- but kind of pricey at $4.  The chocolate chip hazelnut cookie was ridiculously good. And the hot chocolate?  I was so disappointed.  I got the Aztec, which is chocolate, water, chile, and allspice.  My partner thought it tasted like blood.  I thought it was just gross.  Nearly undrinkable.  Maybe the milk-based ones are better? Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Rick Bayless fan.  But I'm skipping Xoco and if I need a Bayless torta, I recommend Frontera Fresca -- they serve a Cubana torta that is pretty much the same as Xoco -- and about $4 cheaper.  But Xoco just doesn't come close to the quality and value you get at Frontera and Topolobampo.",0.985,0.726,0.2,0.073,0.6205453149001534

The side salad was really great, however. It had just the right proportions of arugula to romaine and a really light and subtle dressing that really catered to the flavors and textures of the lettuce, arugula, shaved cucumber and jicama.

It was a particularly cold day and we had heard the lines wrapped around the block since the Top Chef win, so we were slightly worried. We got there at 12:30 and luckily there was a line inside but it was all indoors.  The service was great, they managed the line well and Rick showed up and helped coordinate staff and check in on things. It was nice to see that despite all the recent attention he is still present in all of his establishments. The food is FANTASTIC and the prices are reasonable, allowing a Rick Bayless experience for the masses. It was a good thing we had to wait in line for 15 minutes, because it took us all that time to decide what to order. I wanted one of everything. We had the chips and guacamole to start and then we spilt the Jamon and Pepito tortas. Both were excellent, but I preferred the Jamon torta. We then had churros to finish. Despite the counter ordering, they let you wait until after your meal to ask for the churros so that they come out fresh--a nice touch to a casual establishment. I'm not the hugest fan of communal dining. We sat at a table with four people who appeared to have nothing to talk about as they listened to our conversation for most of the meal, which isn't entirely pleasant.  I'm dying to go back.

And I liked most of my meal at Frontera... But here's the deal. If I'm going to have ""upscale"" Mexican... and a $10 torta is somewhat upscale... I want it to hit on those specific flavors that make Mexican street food so awesome.  A year or two ago the girlfriend and I stumbled upon a random street grill in Mexico City. We ordered a couple things... then a couple more... I was a bit sick but we ended up going for the mystery stew in the pot they couldn't even describe in words I knew and I'm not bad with spanish. This was so motherflippingly delicious... and it was about 50 cents a pop. It was heaven. Now that's what I'm looking for from a gourmet street food experience. I got the Ahogada, which is why I'll come back and try another. It looked beautiful, the bread was nice, the meat seemed quality. And it was sitting in a nice bowl of tomato sauce. The problem was the tomato sauce was REALLY strong. There was no where else to put the sandwich so it sat in it and complete overpowered the meat. By the time I got to the second half the bread had expanded, sopping up sauce and was hard to eat without making a huge mess. Overall it was fine but not the deliciousness I was looking for. After I left I walked by a 7-11, saw a window ad for some terrible fried crap snack and for a moment almost thought about getting one.

2009-12-16,4.0,"The idea was to double date at Frontera.  But the moment we got in on a Friday night and the hostess casually said ""two and half hour wait"" without even batting an eye, we decided we'd have to see what else was available.  With XOCO around the corner and also on our lists to try, we stopped in to see what was available.  The funniest part is, the hostess at XOCO seemed genuinely concerned that our wait would be 15 minutes!  Talk about two different methods of management! So, onto the food: Fresh made guac and chips:  $4.  Excellent started, well made guac, perfect for tiding yourself over as you await the main orders. Cochinita Pibil Torta:  The meat was fairly good, the habanero sauce on this was wonderfully hot (one of those levels where the sides of your mouth feel hot after even finishing the sandwich!).  $12 Cubana Torta:  This was the clearn winner of the three sandwiches.  Succulent tender meat, fresh avocados, excellent flavors.  If you try torta, try this one.  $11 Milanesa Torta:  As one of my favorite tortas in most other Mexican restuarants, this one was good... but it paled in comparison to the Cubana.  It was breaded well, didn't have the crunch that I typically come to expect with a milanesa, but the flavors were good.  Just not as good as the Cubana.  $9 Pork Belly Vermicelli Caldos:  Oh lordy... I could eat this everyday if I only worked out enough to balance it out.  The pork belly, sitting int he soup, was still crisp, tender, and juicy.  The flavor of the broth was reminiscent of an excellent Japanese style ramen, but with a bit of a Mexican kick.  This is the stuff my dreams are made of.  $12 Carnitas Caldos:  A lighter broth with hinets of lime flavored through it, the carnitas were wonderfully tender and the broth was refreshing.  While our double dates preferred this soup, my fiancee and I preferred the Pork Belly.  Try em both if you can, and decide for yourself.  And who would've ever thought avocados would work in a soup cut in whole pieces?  Bayless, why are you such a culinary genius?  $11.50 Ultra Hot Chocolate:  Rich rich rich... it was looking drinking pure chocolate with all the creaminess to back.  If you like those decadent desserts, grab this.  $3 Almendrado Hot Chocolate:  A nice balance to the hot chocolate flavors with an almond tang.  This was definitely my preference, as the sweetness of the almond milk cuts the delicious bitterness of the chocolate a bit.  More balanced in my opinion.  $3.25 Mexican Chocolate Hazelnut Cookie:  Wow.  I mean wow.  This is one damn good cookie.  End with this.  The flavors were perfect, the cookie texture was spot on.  End your meal with one of these.  $1.75 Churros:  As a burb kid who only grew up on churros that you can buy from the stands in Chicago and NYC, I was impressed.  These are lighter, fresher, and more flavorful than the street stand churros, at a fairly similar price.  A tasty choice, but the cookie was a clear winner.  3 for $3.00. Verdict:  So there you have it folks.  The food is great!  One star detracted because of the seating arrangements (we were seated at a high table attached to a wall when a table for four was open... and even though I requested we grab a seat there, the hostess refused to move us there.. and proceeded to sit a different group of four there that was behind us).  It's definitley a bit tight, but still an enjoyable place to eat!  Btw, classy touch of adding sparking water via tap for customers.   My condolences to the one person in our party who didn't see Rick Bayless as he stopped to take pictures with customers and checked on the operations.  Perhaps next time.  ;)",0.9989,0.789,0.185,0.026,0.5972518443997318

The caldo in particular was just the thing for a freezing December night, perfectly spiced, fresh and green with a fantastic mixture of flavor and texture.

We had: House made chips and Guac- good and totally standard. Ahodaga: Golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, pickled onions. This was my favorite of the two sandwiches we ordered. I love my food wet and the tomato broth mentioned here was a served in a bowl, and the sandwich was served in the broth- it was perfect for dipping! The sauce was lip-burning spicy, but not so much so that the flavor was obscured, in fact the heat focused the flavors, and the pickled onions provided the perfect amount of relief and contrast to the spicy sauce. Pepito: Braised Tallgrass shortribs, caramelized onion, artisan Jack cheese, black beans, pickled jalapenos. We almost didn't order this sandwich because I'd made short-ribs for the dinner the night before, but I'm glad we did. This was my mom's favorite, while she found the ahogada a bit too spicy, this was perfect for her. Moist and tender- the cheese really held the sandwich together- both physically and with respect to flavor.

Now that Oprah is leaving, I fully expect Chef Bayless to take over as the ambassador of Chicago. The man is the man and keeps doing it and doing his stuff well. His newest place is coming with a slight twist at his XOCO. Dishing out wondrous street fair as only R.B. does, he hits the ground running and he does it in true Bayless fashion.  First off, the space is small, but the staff is friendly and around to help you figure out what is what. Buuuuut here are a few tips: If you are eating there and they don't have a seat available, you have to wait to order. So eat, enjoy and skedaddle. People are waiting for their chance to eat. Carry out doesn't happen from 10am to 3pm, but if you can't finish your food you can always get a to go box.  Bring a friend or two and split and try, try try! I came with a client of mine who shares the same excitement for food as I tend to, we decided to split a few tortas so we can get the maximum taste testing in. When we scanned over the menu at about 2pm, we had more room in our eyes than stomach. We paired it down to four, down from the original 8. A trio of churros and some limonatas. We grabbed a pair of seats at the end of one of the counters and waited for our food.  Oh wait. Churros already? Not a problem. (Who says you can't do dessert first?) We chowed down on these slightly sweet, cinnamony, chewy and crunchy morsels of heaven. I think next time I will have to get them with a hot chocolate. Then our quartet of tortas came out, the griddled Milanesa chicken, pickled jalapenos, tomatillo avocado salsa and cheese was my favorite. Flavorful and blended so well. The choriqueso was probably a close second, cheese and homemade chorizo, roasted poblanos  and cheese made me think twice about sharing. But if I didn't I don't know if I could have tried the very spicy, (or mild or medium if you prefer), Ahogada. Pork carnitas with black beans and spicy arbol chile sauce make this a pretty good choice. Though not as hot as I had hoped, it still brought a sniffle to my nose. The Pepito, shortribs carmalized onions, jack cheese, black beans and pickled jalapenos was fourth but really, there are no losers here. All five are winners. Oh wait... I still had room for my fifth which was the Gunthorp chicken with pickled white onions, black beans, avocado and salsa.

Everything here is made from scratch, and it shows; the flavors were so balanced, so delicious, the menu items so well thought out. I was overwhelmed by how solid everything was, especially given it's popularity.

Keep in mind that you can order churros with your meal at the counter, then just tell the servers when you are done with your meal and would like them to bring your churros and hot chocolate...a fresh, warm and delicious dessert.  Don't be deterred by reviews saying there is a long wait... maybe you will get lucky as we did! It is worth the wait.

2009-11-20,4.0,"The moment I heard that Rick Bayless was opening a restaurant with his own take on Mexican ""street food,"" I knew that we'd have another gem in Chicago.  I find the idea of street food very enticing, possibly given that Chicago doesn't have an abundance of options in the category.  Whether or not XOCO is actually street food is debatable... but the food itself is undeniably excellent. A few weeks ago, I went to XOCO for lunch with a co-worker.  We walked up to a line nearly (but not) out the door.  I immediately noticed a camera crew and a few Food Network-looking people standing around with microphones.  Soon, a restaurant host told us that there would be dine-in service only today, meaning that we couldn't order the food to go.  We said that was fine.  I assumed it was because of the television program, as it would give the illusion of more customers.  After a few minutes, we noticed that Rick Bayless was actually in the restaurant behind the counter.  I have since heard this same story from a few friends, so I believe that Bayless was overseeing operations for quite a while during the initial start-up.  This is a good sign. After a 20-minute wait, we reached the counter to order.  I took a pass on ordering the hot chocolate, which my co-worker later made me regret, as he dragged on and on about how delicious it was.  I'll definitely try one of the varieties when I return.  Instead, I opted for the spicy, wood oven-roasted cochinita pibil torta with pickled onions.  I am an avid fan of adobo-spiced pork, and this torta definitely did not disappoint.  The pickled onions were a great compliment to the habanero heat.  It made me wish that I had ordered some of the other food, but with the process of ordering, and another long line behind us, I wasn't sure how that would work. I'm looking forward to returning, but unfortunately, so is the rest of the city.  It's been packed every time I've walked by.  From what I've heard, they still are offering take-out during non-lunch hours only.  This sort of defeats the purpose of ""street food""-- quick and consistent.  I would characterize it more as really delicious and classy cafeteria-style dining.",0.9941,0.817,0.149,0.034,0.5361861861861862

For starters, I ordered a churro and it was the best I've had in my life. It was hot, ooey gooey and chewy. The sugar coating melted in my mouth. Just thinking about it now is making me salivate. For my main meal, I got the Gunthrop Chicken. I loved every bite of that sandwich. Every little ingredient was packed with flavor, from the super tender chicken to the caramelized onions. Mmmm M! My coworker ordered the Ahodaga and it looked equally delicious, if not more. (I was jealous of the tomato broth that she used as the dipping sauce.) Even the portions were perfect.

The Empanada was very good, the taste was subtle and refreshing.  They give a chipotle sauce on the side to spice it up if you need that wake up jolt.  The hot chocolate was not like your normal swiss miss.  I was expecting sweet but it was more like semi-sweet chocolate with a slight spice to it.  I found that it balanced well with the super-sweet churro.  Oh, that churro.  Bayless you've really outdone yourself this time.  Pictures do not describe how perfect it was.  It was warm, moist and crunchy all at the same time.  It has large sugar granules and cinnamon, but what tops it off is the bits of chocolate on it as well.  So good.  I would come back just to taste churro perfection once again.",0.9894,0.757,0.197,0.046,0.5291751700680272

My mother handed down his books like they're sequels to the Bible. So when we went to Chicago, we had to go to one of his restaurants. And since the fancier places were pretty much out of the question on short notice/without having heaps of money at our disposal, Xoco was the place for us. Rick wasn't there. Which is okay! Because we got churros and chocolate and a breakfast empanada and a breakfast torta and breakfast bread pudding and homemade granola to console ourselves. And they were delightful, but I'm glad we ordered so much for three people, seeing as I could have easily walked out of there and into the nearest pancake house for breakfast part 2 afterwards. But really. Total deliciousness if you ask me--the quality of the ingredients was outstanding, like chorizo and rich chocolate and pumpkin seeds. My eyes were crossing uncontrollably at least a couple times over the majesty of it all.  My only issue was the fussiness involved in getting helped/finding a seat. It's a small space, and the layout is really bizarre, with the restrooms smack dab in the middle of an otherwise cramped dining area. We arrived on a Saturday at about 10 without much of a line in front of us; however, the cashier asked us to wait for a few minutes while some of the tables cleared up. I appreciate their paying attention to the seating situation, but I started getting anxious when I noticed some people making bee lines for open tables before ordering, ruining the loosey goosey seating process. I can't handle chaos on an empty stomach. Also, they don't allow hot food for carry out--only pastries and beverages.

The service was really uptight, especially when we asked about vegetarian options, they reacted as if we asked for Thai food.  When we asked about Frontera, they said, well you can't go there. Umm why? Because you have to line up for a few hours and come at 3, after which you may have a slight chance of making it in.  I understand they work for a celebrity chef, but they aren't celebrities and need to lower the heat on that attitude.   The ambiance was loud and totally unenjoyable. Everything here was rickety - the tables were unstable and spilled water every time you picked a chip from the basket. The chairs/couches were vibrating (no, not from a phone).  The prices were very high - tiny bowl of unseasoned guac was $4 and a few chips with a pinch of salsa were for $3! See pics!  Their only 2 vegetarian items on the menu are mushroom-based, which I'm allergic to.

I had the fried something chicken torta w/ jalapenos, monterey jack cheese, and avocado-tomatillo salsa. It was delicious and oh so filling; plus that paired with the ""aztec"" hot chocolate + chili powder and all spice was the perfect 'brunch' to start a brisk but sunny Saturday in the city. I do wish there was more on the menu that didn't involve pork; but there were enough options for my one visit. Lastly, my recommendation is to get there early.

Now on the to the food and drink ... 5-star food.  Excellent bread, fresh and well-seasoned veggies, and, according to my friends, freakin' amazing pork belly.  I ordered the ""Woodland Mushroom"" torta and some chips.  It's the only fully-veg option on the menu, and I was expecting a soggy, balsamic-coated, garlicky mess.  Instead, I had perfectly sautéed mushrooms that were nice and earthy, a mild goat cheese, and perfectly toasted bread.  The salsas were good, if a bit mild, and the guacamole was a nice touch--also mild, but flavorful.  I had the chocolate espresso as a dessert, and it didn't disappoint.   Bayless uses only local and--when possible--organic ingredients, even going so far as to list out the various farms and cop-ops he uses to stock the restaurant, and this really appeals to me.  It's worth an extra star ... but it loses one for the service setup.",0.9917,0.778,0.178,0.044,0.6193012716450218

2009-11-07,4.0,"Ok, I've been to XOCO for breakfast once and lunch twice now. Time to write a review. Breakfast: Went at 10:10 to avoid the breakfast 'rush.' There was only one person in line at the time. Maybe I was more into brunch that day. Who knows. All I know is that they were out of everything when I went there, save for the egg and chorizo torta. I had this and a churro for breakfast. The torta was $7.50, and pretty much worth the price. Had avocado, mushrooms, egg, chorizo...I'm thinking cheese, too. Came with a mild green salsa. Overall, wasn't amazingly flavorful. Not a 'knock your socks off' chorizo spice - more mild. But good. The churro has an interesting flavor to it. Can't place it exactly. Came out warm and sugary. Almost too sugary, maybe...but I'm not complaining. It was good. Next time I am coming earlier for the empanadas. And bakery - which looks great! Lunch: 1st visit...came at about 1:45pm, again to avoid the lunch rush. Waited for maybe 3 minutes behind two or three people. I asked the cashier's opinion on what to get. They suggested chochinita pibil torta and the 'royal' mexican chocolate drink. I obliged. They gave me my number, I got some flat spring water that they have on tap - also have the sparkling spring water on tap and some tasty looking flavored waters/juices, which I didn't get. Sat down at a table and waited. Maybe 5 minutes later they brought out the mexican chocolate, and I rushed into it and burned my mouth. Whoops. Wait a moment when you get it. It is worth it. Very rich and delicious. Then, maybe 5-10 min later I got the torta. It comes on a harder roll with shredded pork and pickled onions. At least I think they are pickled. It also comes with habanero sauce. I have been here twice and people always burn their mouth off with the habanero sauce. Be careful! I did this too, then tried to drink the hot chocolate to wash it down...disaster. Ouch. From what I could taste after that, the sandwich was delicious. The bread was a little on the tough/hard side, but overall I really enjoyed the meal. It was a little expensive, though. I remember paying upwards of $20. Oh that's right, I had the tres leches cake too. That was solidly above average, and I'm not even a big fan of that type of cake. Lunch # 2 consisted of the guacamole and chips and the 'pepito' torta. And some mexican chocolate afterwards. The guacamole is really fresh and good, but there is not enough based on the amount of chips you get. Oh well. The pepito is basically a shortrib sandwich with cheese, and green salsa on the side. It was really good. Warm, oozing, flavorful. I would order this again. They were a little late giving us the mexican chocolate. No biggie. This time I got the version with spicy stuff in it (Aztec in the title?). That was really good. Maybe it was because I could taste it this time, but it was better than the royal version I got the first time. Not quite as thick, with a hint of spicy. I would say about XOCO that I never walk away saying 'oh my gosh that was amazing!!' It is always solid, but I don't crave it afterwards. I want to, but I don't. Is that weird? I'll probably keep trying, though. Solid place overall. Worth at least 2-3 visits before you make up your mind because they have a diverse menu.

Roast suckling pig is on our list of 'must-order' meats so that was a real bummer.  It's also one of the more expensive sandwiches on the menu at $12. The other sandwich (Ahodaga:  Golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, pickled onions.) for $9 was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had--it's served in a bowl sitting in the chili sauce so you eat it more like a French Dip.  It's spicy, but still complex.  I would go back just for this sandwich.  The people next to us had the pork belly soup with vermicelli and they seemed to find it orgasmic. The Barcelona hot chocolate is listed as thick on the menu, and that's an understatement.  It was tasty, but a few sips are plenty.  The second one on the menu has milk added and that one was perfect. The churros were good, with a sort of Belgian Waffle gooiness that's really good.

I even complimented (in my head) my Tia Lulu's pozole, (and which I thought was hideous) but after one sip of this one I knew hers was yummy... I went with a friend who ordered a torta (or something closely related, can't quite remember) and after he let me take a bite ( and this torta was ok I must say) was definitely not worth the $8 or more it cost. I could have gotten two big $4 tortas at Nuevo Leon for that price and saved my $13 spent on pozole by asking my Tia to make me some of hers!

One hour and 45 minutes to sit staring at a blank wall 15 inches in front of me, begging time and again for the cup of coffee I ordered with my chicken sandwich. Rick Bayless is an awesome chef. But he should have hired a consultant for the setup of the front of the house for XOCO.  Negatives:  - Giant kitchen area but minimal seating area.  - The seating area is crowded and horrid, with bare walls In front of most customers.  - In line for an hour watching the kitchen staff stand around talking to each other, because they had few orders to cook, as everyone waited for tables to clear and customers to then be allowed to order.  - Watching the TWO cash register girls visit with everyone since they couldn't take orders. Is the over-staffing the reason for such high prices?  - Why no breakfast after 10:30am? Worried the cooks will have too much work to do?  - No takeout until 3pm. The line is long because there's no place to sit, not because the kitchen is busy.  - No soup until after 3pm. In chilly Chicago, this makes no sense.  Could someone have told Mr. Walk-On-Water Bayless how his unique ordering system, his house rules, and his big-kitchen-no-tables setup stinks? If he hasn't opened a new restaurant in 20 years, maybe he's a great chef but not a great restaurateur??? Maybe the master could have spent some money on figuring out the front of the house instead of spending it on so many signs proclaiming how organic he is and what a god of local produce he is. (Has he read any of the articles about the bad carbon footprint the inefficient growing and consumption of local produce creates?)  The food? - Best chicken sandwich I've ever eaten. Even cold when my cup of coffee finally came. Great coffee, great hot chocolate. Wonderful churros. Chocolate biscochos cookies-boring. Maple pecan muffin-very ordinary.

2009-10-24,3.0,"The night before we came to the restaurant, we had ordered some takeout. We thought the food was mostly salty and greasy.  We got a pork belly vermicelli (fiedo), and the vermicelli just felt out of place - and we love noodle soups.  I didn't care for the XOCO salad because I generally don't like meat on my salad except chicken or shrimp.  I find the texture clashing, and the color of the carnitas just dampened the fresh vegetables.  The torta was okay, but I could get a better cuban sandwich in LA for much cheaper. We thought, given the pedigree, the restaurant could do better.  So we went and ate at the restaurant.  We got two other sandwiches this time, the cochinita pibil and shortrib pepito.  The latter was the better sandwich, though my friend preferred the first.  He liked how the pork tasted like it had been stewed for a while, though I thought it was dry.  In any case, all the stuff we tried reminded me of better versions of each that I could get in LA.  The only exception was the churros we had at the end of the meal.  It was hot and crunchy outside and creamy inside.  I thought the sugar and cinnamon was great, especially with a cup of chocolate-coffee.  Definitely a must if you get nothing else here.  But both sandwiches illustrate the sum of what I thought of Xoco's offerings.  It was good food, but not worth the wait in line or the dining experience.  I don't even mind the price, because I believe in its socially responsible philosophy.  We waited 30 minutes for our second meal just to order our food.  We got there before 11:30 a.m. on a weekday, i.e.  before the lunch rush.  The hostess told us we had to wait 15 minutes when we first walked in, and then 15 minutes later, we moved up about 2 feet in line, and she told us we had to wait 15 minutes, again, as if she didn't remember meeting us.  At least have the smarts to say 10 minutes or something, so we wouldn't feel like we were being misled the first time.  I don't mind waiting for good food, but in other places, if you tell me it's an hour wait, I can go hang out somewhere and come back.  Here, I'm stuck in a very narrow queue.  If that's the case, maybe give us sample of the hot chocolate, or churros, or chips and salsa while we wait like cattle.  I don't feel appreciated.

2009-10-24,5.0,"Finally, FINALLY, I was able to try this amazing place. First of let me tell you that I've gone 2 days in a row. Yup, you read right, 2 days in a row....less than 24 hours even. I had a late dinner with my friend there last night and felt the need to return for lunch because I didn't get to try the amazing tortas. And let me tell you I'm SO glad I did.  When my friend and I went for dinner I had the hardest time making a decision of what to order. The tortas looked amazing, but the soups smelled delicious. It was about a 45 minute wait so I had time to decide, but I could have eaten everything on the menu and by the time we got up to the counter it was a game time decision. I ended up ordering the Carnitas soup, which was just incredible! Chunks of avocado, chiyote, corn/potato dumplings, and shredded carnitas topped with arugala....what's not to love??? The serving size was just right and trust me there's was nothing left to eat from that bowl once I was through with it. My friend and I also shared a basket of chips and guacamole which was great...but my only complaint is I wish the guac portion was a little bit bigger. The chip to guac ratio was like 10:1.  It was actually smart for me to order the soup for dinner because they're not available until after 3pm, so after I had been bragging about this soup to my husband, we decided to go there for lunch today. Since we were early it was only a 10 minute wait, but because it was before noon, soup was not ready. Luckily XOCO's menu is set to please everyone.  I ended up finally trying a grilled Milanese torta which was breaded crispy chicken, pickled jalepeno, black beans and cheese on bread served with a tomatillo salsa. The portion was HUGE, but honestly it was too good to stop eating. My stomach was saying no, but my mind kept saying hell yes. My husband ended up ordering the Carnitas wood fire torta which not only was delicious, but the presentation was gorgeous. Served on a baguette, there were chunks of shredded carnitas, pickled onions and a chile sauce, served dipped into a bowl of salsa. Much like you dunk grilled cheese into a bowl of tomato soup, the sandwich was crispy, but had absorbed the wonderful sauce. It was a mouth full of heaven.  We topped off this last visit with one of the many hot chocolate options and let me tell you....this alone could be the reason why I give this place 5 stars. I have grown up with spanish and mexican hot chocolate, but have found it hard to find in places unless I have it shipped. Rick Bayless, culinary god, serves a long list of different hot chocolate options from the Authentic which is ground chocolate and water to the Barcelona which is pure, thick and rich chocolate. My husband ordered the Barcelona and I had the Ultra which is a shot of hot chocolate with almond milk...and both were AMAZING.  Honestly, I know that I went 2 days in a row, but if XOCO was open on a Sunday I would round it out by trying breakfast there tomorrow, but unfortunately I'll have to wait until Tuesday.

A little steep for a Corner Bakery type experience. We got seats at a little bar on high chairs and tucked into the chips and salsa. Ok, nothing special, can get the same at Jewel. The sandwiches were tasty, but not special, about the level of a Corner Bakery club panini :) The churros were super gross, greasy and hard, I totally have no clue why people are raving.

2009-10-21,5.0,"My girlfriend and I wanted to try XOCO since it opened, and we finally made it there yesterday directly after leaving the office at 5:00. It was a good time to arrive, since we waited only about 15 minutes to order and grab a table.  We ordered chips and guacamole, the woodland mushroom sandwich, and the cochinita pibil sandwich. Everything was tasty. I had the cochinita pibil, and the pork was moist and tender, but what really stole the show was the habanero salsa. Rick Bayless captured everything I love about habaneros in that salsa, the bright pepper flavor, and the intense searing heat. It's difficult to capture both at the same time, the heat usually overpowers the pepper. Nice job, Rick! There was nothing unique about the guacamole, but it was as fresh and tasty as you can get. The woodland mushroom sandwich had a generous helping of goat cheese, and a nice roasted pepper salsa. There are several beer selections available, including Three Floyds Alpha King. We chose a 750 ml bottle of Goose Island Matilda. There are more than enough reasons to make a return trip to XOCO, several hot chocolates, tempting soups, even a breakfast menu. Next time! The service was perfectly adequate for the type of restaurant. This is not a fine dining establishment, but everyone was friendly and the food arrived quickly. Rick has hit a home run with XOCO. If you're a fan, you must try it!  As a side note, I refuse to dock an restaurant stars for a wait. If waiting for a table makes it an unpleasant experience, go somewhere else.

Especially given the amount of people waiting and how long they are waiting for!  The 'authentic Mexican street food' is OK, but doesn't really remind me of any street food I have had on the streets of Mexico City.  But, the Tortas from the griddle are really delicious and remind me of many of my Cuban favorites from Miami (where I moved here from).  I don't think that is what he intended, but still very delicious!  MUCH more expensive than the Cuban variety, but very delicious!  I will go back, when I have several hours to wait in the ridiculous, convoluted, line.",0.9811,0.801,0.18,0.019,0.5499999999999999

Yeah, no.  Apparently they start serving soup at that time, eh who knew? Well an hour's wait worth of people that's who. So just as the hubby was getting queasy and I was profusely apologizing for the millionth time for making him come with me, we found ourselves at the head of the line. Score! The staff was really friendly and cheery which I very much appreciated. Nothing like looking forward to a meal, waiting in line to the point of passing out to be met by rudeness. That did not happen here, smiles all around. I will say that when we got our order there was a small mistake but they rectified it very quickly which was a relief. So everything was great, the sandwiches, chips and salsa, beverages but the pozole was just ok for me. Not so great at all for the hubby who craved the authentic stuff. The sandwiches were by far the highlight-the top of his head was sweating from the heat of the sauce for crying out loud! I want to go back again but I want to go when there is a shorter wait and I can sit where I don't have to face the wall.

Okay, onto breakfast pastries. I had the Vanilla sour coffeecake and the toasted bolillo.  The coffeecake was GREAT.  Not overly sweet, even though there is a streusal topping.  Very light, airy, and not too rich, which is great because the Almendrado needs to go with something not too sweet or overpowering.  Great pairing!

That would be super helpful, because the line is deceiving! Expect a solid 30-45 minutes from the door. They wont take your order until there is a table for you, which I think is annoying at times, but a nice touch. And for everyone who bitches about the wait, you are going to arguably the hottest chef in the country restaurant. Deal with it and soak in the awesomeness. On that note, well worth the wait. I recommend starting with chips and salsa/guacamole. Not that they are anything in special, but when at XOCO, do as all good XOCO'ans do. I've had three sandwiches so far .. - Milanesa:  Crispy Gunthorp chicken, black beans, artisan Jack cheese, pickled jalapenos, tomatillo-avocado salsa. - Pepito:  Braised Tallgrass shortribs, caramelized onion, artisan Jack cheese, black beans, pickled jalapenos.  - Cubana:  Smoked Maple Creek pork loin and bacon, black beans, avocado, artisan Jack cheese, chipotle mustard.  All are mouth-watering and special. I strongly recommend the Milanesa and Cubana. The bacon on the Cubana makes this a cuban sandwich like you have never experiences. The Milanesa is one to go back for. Crispy on the outside, spicy jalapenos, and creamy avocado salsa. YUM. The pepito was average. You should go for the Hot Chocolate - The Aztec (I believe?) Chocolate and 2% milk is ABSOLUTELY BY FAR the BEST hot chocolate you will ever drink. It is chocolately and creamy and you will do everything you can to not burn the entire roof of your mouth by drinking it in one gulp.

I went on opening day for lunch around 11:15am, and waited about 15 minutes which wasn't too bad.  My first go around I ordered the torta ahogada and a jamaica agua fresca.  The torta ahogada is still my favorite food item on the menu.  I ordered it hot, and they aren't kidding around!  I love spicy food, so this was fine but I usually expect hot to be medium in most restaurants.  The jamaica was amazing too, and a great refreshing drink to go along with the spicy meal. For round 2, I decided to try breakfast before going into work.  No wait time around 8:30am. I ordered the Aztec Hot Chocolate.  It tasted just like my grandma's! Amazing. And later I would learn, Xoco imports their chocolate from Tabasco.  The Aztec is my favorite drink item on the menu.  I also had the spinach and egg empanada, which was good but probably wouldn't get it again (it looks like they have some better breakfast items). Round 3, I went for dinner after work.  I got there around 5:45pm and there was no wait again.  My suggestion is to find an off peak time to go visit for the best experience.  I ordered the short rib caldo along with the Jamaica.  The caldo was quite good, although wish their was more meat.  But it hit the spot for a cold October evening. I finally got a friend to come with me for round 4 last night, and this time it was at 6:30pm with a wait.  The floor manager said 30 minutes but it felt more like 20, but maybe its because I had good company to pass the time.  I got the gunthrop chicken torta with avacado which was excellent.  Along with an authentic hot chocolate, I was in heaven.

2009-10-12,1.0,"A Funny Story (GOSSIP ALERT!) But on the books, this is a review about management and service. With visitors from California in tow, we went for the famous ""Churros and Hot Chocolate"" for dessert. We saw the churros under the heating lamp from outside, and our mouths were WATERING. But wait, it's kind of late, are they still open? Did we wander too long trying to find this place? It was 10:35PM on Saturday night and the doors were... open! Yay! We made it in time! There were orders still not yet filled, dishes were still coming out, and there were patrons who appeared not to have even ordered yet! How lucky were we? A man (presumably one of the hosts or managers), beelined to our cheerful group and  said swiftly, ""We're closed! Sorry!"" We cried, ""What? Oh, but we just want the churros, we don't even have to be seated, we can take it to-go..."" ""We don't have anymore churros."" But here's the thing, we just saw a mound of them under the heating lamp from outside, right above the huge sign that says, CHURROS. So we say, ""Yes, you have churros, we just saw them. Can we just get those to-go?"" He says he'll check, and he's a nice enough guy, there were girls in our group pleading with him that they were from California, heard about the churros, please oh please in the way that girls bat their eyelashes, etc., so he at least appeared like he would try, and later came back saying he might be able to do something, but the hot chocolate was unlikely. NOTE: one of the cooks was giving this guy STINK EYE the whole time. I guess he didn't care about the girls and their eyelashes and California and all that. He wanted to go home OR maybe there was a principle that needed to be upheld, one that exists between hosts and cooks (I'm guessing). So next thing we know a woman comes up to us (presumably the real manager/hostess, or one who is more man enough than the last), and tells us they can't help us.  ""But we only want the churros..."" ""We can't help you, we closed at 10. But you can go next door, they're open."" ""Oh, great, they have churros?"" ""No."" ... We just kind of look at her and squeak out, ""But we only want churros..."" ""Sorry, we're closed."" So we leave. And hope they will lock the doors behind us like they should have at 10. So we go out by the big pile of churros under the heating lamp and take the ""Came all the way from California and was denied churros"" photograph. We start laughing and talking and trying to think of other places to go. We do that for about 10-15 minutes, just standing out in front of the CHURROS sign on the glass... THEN (here's the kicker!), we watch one of the workers in one of the dark XOCO  t-shirts get a TO-GO box and dump a ton of churros into it with a little thing of (I'm assuming) a to-go dipping sauce (chocolate?).  We're suspicious, but we think, well, I guess one of the legitimate patrons ordered it, another one bites the dust... But no. She boxes it up and appears to HIDE it in one of the under-shelves! What?! Did she just do that? Is she saving it for herself, just in case the last of the patrons buy up the rest and she can't have any for herself to take home at the end of her shift? What's going on? Are the churros so good that the workers themselves need to hide them away  so they aren't  wasted on paying customers? And more importantly, if you work there, aren't you sick of churros by now? I mean, C'MON, they're friggin' CHURROS! CHURROS, people! Has Rick Bayless made a genius move by cornering the churros-for-rich-people market in Chicago? I'm beginning to think so.  So even though the ""spirit"" of Mexican street food (the notion that vendors want to sell their food) was not embraced in its management or service (are they annoyed with their overwhelming success?), I'm going to guess that these particular churros are out of this world amazing.

2009-10-12,5.0,"I wanted to be absolutely sure about this place before I wrote a review because it somehow seemed too good to be true. A Bayless place that's reasonably priced and still unbelievably delicious? I couldn't believe he could possibly do it without reducing the quality proportional to the price reduction. And yet, I found myself absolutely blown away by my first impression of the place. Although the line was quite long, especially for a late lunch (2:00 and the line was nearly to the door), it was well worth the wait. The first thing you notice about the place when you walk in the door is the smell. It combines the earthy notes of Mexican Chocolate with the spicy kick of chiles and the delicious smell of cheese melting over a grilled sandwich. It's totally intoxicating. As the line moved forward, I could see a familiar face as Chef Bayless sprinted around the kitchen, plating dishes, mixing chocolate and talking into an ABC camera all at the same time. I figured that if Chef Bayless was at the helm, I couldn't lose. I was right. My jamon torta was beautiful. There's no other word for it. The serrano ham blended smoothly into the avocado and the manchego, and all of that blended seamlessly into the soft-on-the-inside-and-crunchy-on-the-outside bread. It was definitely in the top 3 on my great sandwiches list. I also snagged a bit of Melissa F's red chili and pork shoulder soup and it was almost as delicious. I found myself craving the food again less than a week later, and since I had a lot of time on my hands (between work ending at 3 and school not having started), I headed back. I was curious, above all, to see if the same quality held up without Chef Bayless in the restaurant. Although I wasn't entirely surprised, it did hold up. I ordered the same jamon torta and shared the red chili soup with a friend and it was just as good as the first visit. In fact, writing this review makes me want to go back right now.

2009-10-09,2.0,"A word to the wise, my experience with Xoco was less than impressive on the food availabilty and customer service fronts. Me and my buddy decided to catch a late breakfast at the much heralded chef Rick Bayless's restaurant in downtown Chicago. We arrived at 10:31am on a Friday and were approached by an employee who informed us we had just missed breakfast and no food would be cooked until the lunch menu takes place at 11:00am. I've never seen this advertised on their web site or elsewhere...one minute tardy to the party and no breakfast, really? Really? We decided to order some Churros which were really good. My buddy, very nicely, let the lady taking our order at the counter know that we were disappointed that being one minute late on a non-advertised deadline for breakfast was a 'rule' and being so strictly enforced. The order taker, I use that term because there was no 'customer service' involved, said...""Well, you would not believe how busy we are between 10:30am and 11:00am"". No empathy, no accommodation, no nothing. A quirky smile and ""That'll be $3.45"".  So, first visit to Xoco was less than impressive. We'll try it again to see if our experience was an anomaly or business as usual. Really. Lastly, I'm giving it 2 stars for lack of service and food.",0.3276,0.818,0.086,0.096,0.5018518518518518

The food did not live up to all the hype.  The bread cut the top of my mouth because it was so hard.  The salsa was good, but otherwise nothing exciting and definitely not worth the rigmarole we were put through.  My friend didn't even finish her sandwich as she was so unimpressed.  And my cookie was overcooked.

Words of advice: be prepared to wait in line.. Yes, even at 1pm on a Wednesday afternoon, since that's when we went.  It took us about 30 minutes just to order our food..We even had to wait for a few minutes outside because the line was out the door. After ordering your food, you are seated by a hostess..At first the hostess, wanted to squeeze my husband and I in between a group of people just because there were 2 chairs available at the bar against the wall. I'm sorry but we just paid $30 for sandwiches I am not going to be smashed against a wall just to say I tried Rick's sandwiches. So my husband asked if we could sit at another table and the hostess hesitated and said that it was reserved.. Interesting. I didn't know tables at sandwich shops are usually reserved.   Eventually we made our way to 2 chairs against the bar and sat down.  We were served our chips/guac within 5 minutes.  The guacomole was good but nothing to brag about.  (Sorry Rick) Sandwiches arrived shortly thereafter.  I had the Gunthorp Chicken from the oven and immediately noticed how hard the bread was. I barely could bite into it.  My husband ordered the Milanese and his was excellent!! I wanted to keep eating his after just one taste.  My husband even sampled my sandwich and agreed that the bread was too hard, albeit flavorful.  Basically the food was flavorful, but nothing orgasmic. We ended our lunch with a churo which was delicious..But like anything else, this place will soon lose its luster after the Rick hype dies down.

Their prep kitchen seems to be at the back of the restaurant, so anytime new plates or food was being exchanged, workers had to walk through the whole dining room. NOT cool. 2. The lady at the cash register was NOT helpful at answering any of my questions and was having co worker problems which turned her attitude a little sour. 3. My boyfriend sent back the seafood soup because of various reasons, however when the manager came over she did not apologize but tried to correct and school him on the nature of the dish. NOT cool.

2009-10-03,4.0,"When I heard the news that Rick Bayless was finally looking to open up a spot in homage to classic Mexican street food, my first thoughts were a mixture of excitement, high hopes.  Yet inklings of trepidation and questions about whether this would be a smart move on his part also popped in my head.  Business-wise, there is little doubt that he can succeed.  He has built an entire brand around his love and execution of traditional Mexican cuisine.  Mexican food on all levels is incredibly diverse.  I won't try to explain it all to you (nor will I even try to pretend as if I am some kind of expert on it), but just think of how large the country is, how many different ethnic groups have called it home, how Mexico played a huge part in the Spanish trade routes coming all the way from Asia, through Mexico, and then off to Spain (and vice-versa).  Not to mention the influence of French rulers for a few years, and of course- the traditions of the pre-Columbian people who had lived there for hundreds of years. It is from this vast and diverse ""arsenal"" of ingredients, cooking techniques, and people's tastes and traditions that brought about comida Mexicana- what some would consider the first form of ""fusion"" cuisine. Still from there, and even today with even more influences going on, one of the finest examples of the every day people's foods in Mexico took form in little roadside stands, and vending carts.  In reality, the same can be said about really any place in the world. But please, don't tell me that Mexican food can't be fancy or upscale.  I promise if you compared the techniques, the steps and the preparation involved in let's say boeuf Bourguignon, or a terrine to a well executed mole con pollo- the chicken mole would be much more complex and difficult to do.  Besides, French food, which is regarded by many to be the most refined and ""fancy"" out of all of the types of food, was developed by peasants who had to make do with the scarce resources they had! Which brings me back to XOCO.  Bayless' concept seemed to be the perfect balance of refined flavors using excellent quality ingredients and well executed cooking techniques, but with all of the pretentious notions that follow fine dining establishments thrown to the side.  But there was a problem.  Here you have a concept that embraces and highlights an aspect of Mexican cuisine that most Americans know about, even if on a minimal level- street food.  Yet focusing on tortas and caldos, not tacos and the basically American invention- burritos, may confuse some who don't explore it more.  Not to mention the prices, while not at the level of fine dining establishments throughout the city, are still a bit steep (up to $12 for a sandwich) compared to quite a few taquerias that offer tortas (for as little as about $4). That is where my anxieties for XOCO grew.  Would I leave this place thinking it really was better than the handful of Mexican places I frequent on the south side?  Would it really take me back to Tulum Puebla or Ensenada?  Would this place be viewed by Harriet of Cedar Rapids, IA as the quintessential Mexican experience?  Or maybe not tasting quite as good as that ground beef burrito with ranch sauce and shredded cheddar cheese at Taco John's? As I have stated above- I would hate to see the history and the traditions of Mexican food be even more misunderstood. And so I have gone.  Twice, actually.  The first time was for breakfast.  The two tortas that we tried were quite nice.  The star of these sandwiches was the bread- or at least how they got it crisp without over doing it.  Flavors were nice too.  We tried a couple of churros, and while they were tasty like churros are, they were just churros.  Which is to say, nothing special in my opinion. We also tried the sipping chocolate.  ""Made in house"" is an understatement.  They actually take cocoa beans from whole and do their own processing, and it shows!  So rich and yet not at all what you would have if you took a good quality chocolate bar and melt it down.  Try the Azteca.  The mixture of the heat from the cayenne and other spices with the rich chocolate is a delicious treat. The second time I came was for lunch- and this time gave me a better feel for how this place does.  Food this time was good too.  I ordered the cochinita pibil and was happy with it.  The suckling pig was not dried out, had a great flavor and was put on that nicely toasted bolero-like French bread (which I found out is not made in house- it comes from a major national bakery) with some pickled onions, and black beans.  Is XOCO a success?  In business terms, so far in its early days- absolutely!  However, I am hoping that Harriet from Cedar Rapids has her eyes opened to the wonderful traditions and flavors of real Mexican food, in an environment that is very much American, and walks away realizing just how refined and special comida Mexicana can be.",0.9985,0.84,0.129,0.031,0.4607795965608466

I prefer mine to have a bit more garlic and cilantro, but who knows, maybe that is not authentic. My crazy American palette thinks Taco Bell's Crunch Wrap Supreme is awesome. My torta was good. It had a nice spice to it, but did need a little salt. The torta was way too hot for me to eat at first. I had to open it up and let it cool for like 10 minutes. After that, it was great. The suckling pig was good, too, but needed a little extra hot sauce and some salt. The beer selection is good. They had Matilda. I also love how they have sparkling water on tap, for free.

My Torta- Could NOT have been more disappointed. Unsalted pork. It said SUCKLING PIG on menu. Total lie. It was a dry actually. It needed like avocado, cheese, mayo something fatty since the pork was eh. And smeared with beans, couldn't even tell. But the price was already at  $12 for sandwich, which included no sides.  The side sauce- just gross, unedible hotness. Like it had heat, but no flavor.  What I kinda liked- Churro-it was good. But.....I had better. Sorry Rick Bayless!  Hot Chocolate- Yes it's fresh from the bean. But the best I've had? Sorry, no. I give it 3 stars. Chips and guac- Chips are 4 stars, guac was only 3.

So this line may sound like a big deal.... but trust me it is a blessing in itself.  If you think you're going to say give me a beef torta and that'll be the end of that, think again.  Rick don't do 'standard' Mexican. Each torta comes with its own sauce, with toppings that are more than just lettuce, tomato, onion, cilantro.  This is a Frontera experience that is on the cost for the average person. So I digress.  We get two tortas (different ones so we can go halfsies and get two tastes).  My friend gets guac and chips and a churro.  The sandwiches.... the choriqueso and the Wudford Chicken. The choriqueso had some the best chorizo I ever ate.  It was creating the magic pool of orange grease that usually accompanies a chorizo burrito at the local burrito place.  The sandwich had poblanos, a jack cheese, and maybe some other stuff.  It came with a tomatillo salsa.  It was.....mmmmmmm The chicken sandwich had avocado and other ingredients and it came with a red sauce (I can't remember everything on it, but it was good.... not as good as the chorizo sandwich IMO). I tried a little guac with a chip.  The chips were fresh and crisp with the right amount of salt.  The guac was pretty creamy, but not enough garlic or spice for my taste.  It seemed like a good safe guac with nothing special to stand out. The churro looked good and possibly had a cream center.  I didn't try it so I don't know.

Oooh, what's that over there... WHAT?! Did she just say next?! I'm not ready, I'm still deciding, shit, shit, shit!"" To the cashier: Ok, I'll have some pastries to go...for um...a...meeting. I'll have the coffeecake, ginger-lime muffin, and an apple-pear muffin. Oh wait, and a churro too, yes someone specifically wanted one of those! Cashier: Ok, that will be $8, we'll call you when it's up. I admit it, I'm weak - don't judge me! I'm just grateful my pants didn't burst into flames from my shameless lies, then the jig would've been up. Instead, I sauntered out shamelessly with my bag of waistline-destroying treats. The churro was gone before my computer finished booting up, but in my defense it is a really old, slow computer. It was amazing, not overly greasy or bland, but fried and sugared perfection! Next went the coffeecake, which was also quite good. Nothing fancy, but that's what I loved about it. Moist cake with a tasty, yet simple streusel on top, definitely something I'd stop by for again with a churro chaser of course. As tempting as it was to make one of the muffins my lunch, I saved it for that evening's dessert. The apple-pear muffin was really yummy and this comes from someone who usually shuns anything with fruit filled, baked or crammed inside of it. The big chunks of fruit were fresh and tasty. Again, the simple streusel on top was the perfect compliment to add just that extra pinch of sweetness. The last muffin, the ginger lime, went the next day and was my only real disappointment. I was expecting more zing and more tart than I got, to me the flavor fell flat. Definitely not bad, just not a standout like the other 3. Late breakfast appears to be a good time to hit Xoco.

We finally  got up to the counter and were told that there was no takeout for the savory dishes, only the sweets.  It wouldve been great to know that before we got in line as the restaurant was really crowded and it looked like it wouldve been a wait to get a seat.  Plus we were tired and kind of just wanted to go home.  This is where we ran into a little trouble.  There was a woman handing out numbers to people after you ordered and paid for your food, scouting out the tables and seating you.  After ordering our food and getting our number we stood around waiting for the woman to take us to a table for another 10 or 15 minutes.  She kept walking past us and  I asked my husband a couple of times if he thought the woman remembered that we were waiting for  a table.  Soon enough we saw our food turn up on the line and the runners taking it out and bringing it back because we werent seated.  Finally, after a pair behind us in line were taken to a table I stopped the woman and reminded her that we had been waiting for a table.  Apparently she had forgotten that she gave us a number and forgot that we were waiting (even though she had passed us 12 times over the past 15 minutes).  We sat at a table with 4 other people (the seating in the restauarnt is very close together and very communal.)   The food itself was very good.  I had the Xoco salad with pork, good dressing, flavorful, just what you'd expect from Rick Bayless.  My husband had a chicken torta which looked great and he said was amazing.  Ill return to try the chocolate drinks but the service still clearly has a few kinks to get out.",0.9948,0.814,0.147,0.038,0.6095945945945946

(Try to go right after work on a weeknight.) I had read some reviews and knew that they mostly had tortas, which I am not a big fan of typically. I ordered the carnitas torta.. can't remember the name... and was pleasantly surprised. It came with a tomato-based soup/sauce that you could dip the torta in. That made it very flavorful and juicy. I also ordered the chips/salsa but that was just average. I was all excited b/c they were homemade but honestly they kind of tasted like the store ones. The salsa was good, but again not great.  Overall, it was a nice experience. It was a casual atmosphere, counter service and mainly bar seating. I liked how they had some desserts, some different drinks and some yummy-looking ice cream flavors. For some reason I had thought it was going to have tacos, as well, so I was a bit disappointed, especially since I am not huge of tortas or soup. But I wouldn't mind going back when it gets a little cooler and trying some soup and the much-raved-about hot cocoa.  While we were there, Rick Bayless came in and was talking to some people. My friend and I were excited and wanted to talk to him after we finished eating but by that time he had gone into the kitchen or something and wasn't around. So was really bummed out about that.

She briefly stopped taking our order to roll her eyes at an inexperienced co-worker who asked a question that met her disapproval. I ordered two drinks that came in tiny little cups, the gucamole and chips (totally overpriced, $4 for something that is costing 70 cent to produce), the Gunthorp Chicken and the Cochinita Pibil which came to $33. The Gunthorp chicken was very plain and my Mexician friends could make better with less fuss. The Cochinita Pibil was tasty and if there wasn't a line I would eat it again. The seating is very compact and they don't do carry out but the food is served very quickly by friendly food runners.

And I still ended up changing my order 3 times! From the entrance of the restaurant to actually ordering took another 20 minutes-but once I was inside, the wonderful mix of rich chocolate and other fragrances took over.  Also the fact that Rick Bayless was in the kitchen almost the whole time, and I oogled him from 3 feet away was AWESOME! At one point, my boyfriend had to tell me to calm down cuz I was acting like a school girl frazzled by the hot science teacher (Ha! j/k) SO THE FOOD!!!!! The Mexican Hazelnut chocolate chip cookie probably the best cookie I've ever had.  It was rich, LOTS of chocolate, soft but not without texture. The Chips & Salsa: 2 different salsas-green and red.  Both delicious!  THE CHURROS!!!!! Why don't all churros taste this delicious?!?!?!? Sugary, crispy, the right amount of cinnamon! RAWR!!! I want moremoremore!  The Pepito was soo tender and tasted like it was cooked and marinated forever! yumyumyum! The torta bread was crispy and not too much bread!  The Ahogada was spicy awesome! The tomato dip is very well seasoned. My bf ordered the medium and it was the perfect amount of spicy, not at all wimpy! I can't imagine what the hot tastes like?!?! Also it was super awesome cuz Rick Bayless actually put the final touches on this torta himself! AHHHHH The Azteca chocolate: very well balanced-great chili taste, light and balances out the chocolate well to let out its natural sweetness.  I love that you can sip the drink and really taste all the flavors instead of artificial sweetness like chocolate drinks at other places.

Although I had my chances to dine-in early in opening week, I did have the unfortunate timing of trying to dine-in after the word was unleashed the world that XOCO was open, and that Rick Bayless would be working the counter all week. I do suspect that the lunchtime crowds will be larger than normal for awhile, so plan accordingly. Also, they will eventually do take-out orders, it doesn't look like they will be offering that option any time soon. How's the food, you ask? Excellent taste, and wonderful value for the price point. Although the tortas range from $9-$13, they're worth every mouth-watering bite. It's a fine strategy to go with a friend, and split two sandwiches to maximize your flavor potential. On my initial trip, I split an Ahodaga, and a Cubano.  The Ahodaga sits in a tomato broth and a chile sauce (which you specify the spice level.) It's quite a flavorful dish, and you may be tempted to use your sandwich to mop up the sauce (as I did). The Cubano was a nice griddled torta as well. The pork was well seasoned, and the bacon was cooked well. Another excellent combination of flavors. You can get chips and salsa ($3) or chips and guacamole ($4) as well, but don't expect an overwhelming amount of chips.  I definitely will have to bring my co-workers to try the breakfast menu, and the churros as well.

XOCO is a bright space with lively colors and lots of windows.  It has a distinctly relaxed flavor, and if it were not for the well-trained staff and decadent smells it looks like it would fit in well on Seven on State or some other high-end food court.  And that certainly isn't a bad thing. We placed our order, collected our number and were seated at a counter near the back of the restaurant.

The tortas were all visually appealing--slightly charred breads that were halved to give you a look at what is inside, all served in a basket.  The Choriqueso was the lowlight.  I wouldn't've thought so, but it seems like there is an amount of chorizo that is a little too much chorizo.  The Pepito was like an extraordinary refined cheesesteak--tender onions and peppers mixed with beef and cheese all in this chewy, slightly crunchy bread.  You can taste the woodfired grill in the mix, which all sort of oozes nicely together.  The wild mushrooms were paired with just the right amount of goat cheese, and it was a simple, tasty combination.  The Ahodaga was served in a bowl of very spicy red carnitias sauce--kind of like a Mexican French-dip.  The sauce gave a nice warm glow, and the pork was exceptional.

Cutting, cleaning, cooking. that made me pleasantly surprised. Let's get to the good and the bad (or just unpleasant/wishlist... cause again, no bad). Good - the hot chocolate (aka cocoa bean drink) and the churros. I will repeatedly return to XOCO JUST for these two items. Numerous times. Maybe twice in one day even. I had the Almondrado (probably spelled wrong.. made with almond milk) and my boyfriend had the Barcelona. The man who brought it to our seating area took his time to explain the finer points of the drinks.. how the Barcelona is popular in Europe, but they make it thicker there, even if it gets more like pudding. I loved his enthusiasm in explaining our drinks. Wishlist - I know, vegetarians often get the shaft when it comes to eating. I'm used to this. XOCO did have a veg-friendly torta... made with mushrooms. They also had another offering after 3pm... made with mushrooms. Mushrooms are not always my friend. Maybe another veg offering that doesn't revolve around mushrooms? However, the mushroom torta that I had was made with goat cheese that did slightly overpower the subtle flavors of the mushrooms.

The cochinita pibil sandwich was interesting with the addition of the pickled onions, but it was far too small for a gentleman of my stature and it lacked much meat. It also wasn't very spicy, even though I ordered it as such while mentally preparing my bowels to go to war.  Mom got the ""Jamon"" sandwich, which is mostly prosciutto, cheese, and avocado spread. Obviously, this tasted good. And obviously, I ate most of it. It was a much more generous portion than my cochinita pibil.  We also shared guac and chips. The chips weren't fresh, which was disappointing. The guac was good, but had a strange undertone of lavender or vanilla or something. Or maybe someone sprayed perfume in it. I don't know. To drink, I had a Mexican hot chocolate, which was tasty, but not really unique if you've had it before.    Total cost for all this: About $32. That's not terribly expensive for two people for lunch... But considering my mom only ate about 3 bites of food and I consumed the rest, it came out to more like $27/person, which is steep, even for people that eat 9200 calories a day like Michael Phelps and myself.

When we walked back 10 minutes later it had grown to around 25 people, burn! That's fine, I totally expected to wait on a Friday during the first week. Unlike the lines at Hot Dougs the line here moved pretty fast. It took us about 45-50 minutes to order after getting there. We overheard the people behind us in line saying that they were the oldest people there and that made me look around. It really was a pretty young crowd.

We ended up ordering lots of food and spent $50 for the two of us.  You can't watch someone making churros and not want to eat them. The same goes for chocolate flan cake. That cake was amazing and it was the first thing we ate. Our chips and guacamole were really yummy too. The carnitas with pork and dumplings had a lot of spice to it and it was probably my favorite thing next to the chocolate flan cake. The suckling pig tortas were good and we dipped the leftover bread in the carnitas broth...I highly recommend doing that! The crispy gunthorp chicken in my Milanesa was yummy but the jalapenos in it were definitely packing a punch and I had to take a couple of them out.

Sure, the line was out the door and yes, it was about an hour wait in line but it was a lot of fun and totally worth it. First, the decor is awesome. very simple and modern but yeah, there isn't a ton of seating. Fortunately, there is a very nice hostess who will meet you at the register, give you your order number and then take you back to your seats. I was honestly shocked when she did this because I had nightmares of eating on the floor or huddled against the wall. It is communal seating for a small group so be ready to make friends with strangers but the vibe was fun and everyone was talking about what they ordered. If you have to wait outside, it will be about an hour before you get up to the register but people were crowded around enough watching Rick Bayless walk by and once you get inside the action is much more interesting. You can see the food going in the woodburning stove and the crowd/action is more than enough entertainment. Food: one word: awesome. I've been to Frontera and liked it a lot but this is the PERFECT lunch or casual dinner place. A friend and I split several dishes, including the homemade hot chocolate (recommend the Azteca), churros (TO DIE FOR), pork belly/avocado soup (not spicy, very tasty), Jamon Torta from the griddle (definitely get the fried egg for on top) and the Choriqueso Torta from the oven (good and with a nice kick but somehow not as satisfying.) My friend and I left SUPER full and happy. I definitely want to go back and try the desserts and get the carry out. Prices were fair and definitely cheaper than Topo and Frontera. I would absolutely, 100 percent go back. Lots of fun (minus the wait)",0.9987,0.694,0.282,0.024,0.5221704623878537

2009-09-10,4.0,"Great job, Rick!! I arrived at 10:45 this morning and was greeted with a warm smile from Mr. Bayless himself.  Bonus.   We were first in line for lunch service today.  Two friends are in town from Phoenix and this was their lunch pick.  Apparently, day three at Xoco was going swimmingly according to the girl taking our order.  If you don't know the drill, you place your order at the counter and are given your cold drinks and a number.  Your order is delivered to your table as it's ready. Definitely a few kinks to work out, but nothing major and I'm sure everything will be seamless in a week or two.  We ordered 3 agua frescas (2 jamaica/lemongrass and 1 limonada), 1 churro, 1 Ultra chocolate, 1 gazpacho, 1 chips & guac, 1 chips & salsa and the following tortas:  Choriqueso, Cochinita Pibil & the Lingua special.   The Jamaica/Lemongrass was delightful!  Not too sweet.  We sat and the first things to arrive were the churro & chocolate.  A true case of eating our dessert first, but we didn't mind.  The churro was great -- crispy, chewy, cinnamon delicious.  And the Ultra chocolate was fabulous.   Next came the chips, guac, salsas and the gazpacho.  Guac was clean and simple, salsas were flavorful and fresh.  But the gazpacho was divine!  Pure, simple tomatoey essence!  I loved every bite of it. Sandwiches arrived piping hot and crunchy.  They're served on that super crunchy, rustic bread that is so tasty but that tears up the roof of my mouth.  I might say that the Choriqueso was the winner with its porky cheesiness.  The Pibil was very good, nice and spicy with the habenero salsa.  The tongue was good too.   Overall, a great experience.  The line was moving quickly, the staff was all very friendly & helpful and the food was great!  $55 for lunch for three wasn't too bad and we were FULL!   Break a leg, Rick & Team!",0.9989,0.696,0.298,0.006,0.5646984126984128

While I could do without the chicken being ""fried"", it was still good chicken, OH and the artisan jack cheese - OMG - it was dripping out of the sandwich; the pickled jalepenos SO flavorful. DH got the carnitas caldos (apparently soup for anyone not aware, as we weren't). It was SO tasty with some kick - I don't think we got any dumplings, but it wasn't lacking - the greens were so bright green and fresh. Also got chips & guac - SO fresh. And then by accident, we were given what we think was an Almendrado - it was assigned to our number but we didn't order it, so he gave it to us anyway. INCREDIBLE!  I want to go back for churros & chocolate & everything else!! It's a little chaotic in there, but you've got it nicely organized. Your staff knows what's going on and what to tell people when they seem confused. They do help with seating when folks are standing around. Today was confusing b/c they were not doing take-out, whereas yesterday, opening day, I believe that's all they did; not sure.

2009-09-09,4.0,"The same great flavors and Rick Bayless' ability to refine traditional Mexican ingredients has flowed easily from Topolobampo and Frontera right into Xoco, the 50 seat, counter service restaurant around the corner dishing out Bayless' take on Mexican street food.  From the roasted chicken coming out of the wood-burning oven, to the hand-ground chocolate for traditional hot chocolate, to the fresh made churros, the emphasis here is on great ingredients going into house-made dishes and drinks.  I had the Torta Ahodaga: golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, and pickled onions, and it was beyond good. As at Topolo, each component of the dish stands on it's own while creating a perfect bite each time. The balance of smokey, spicy, sweet, and acidic was perfect. I wanted more, even though this was plenty. Then my wife decided we should come back each week and try something different from the menu listing over 10 sandwiches and a half dozen fresh soups. I am powerless. So now, of course you can see me in there once a week until I make my way through the menu. Maybe twice. Or so.",0.9814,0.827,0.158,0.015,0.5857619047619047
2009-09-09,5.0,"Went to Xoco opening day and was not disappointed. The line was only about 5ish minutes to order at about 5:50 PM. I was expecting the line to be around 1 hour and that I would probably wait until another time to try out the food. The menu is pretty large and there are small dessert items and drinks everywhere you look too. I ordered a ""Aztec"" hot chocolate, a glass of 2007 Topolovino Syrah, a Churro, and a Choriqueo Torta. The Aztec was very good with a hint of spice, very different than the hot chocolate I am accustomed to. The wine was good but overpriced at $12 a glass. The Churro was light and sugary. It wasn't a heavy, oily, gross filling mess that many of the ballpark / amusement park churros are. By far the best Churro I have had but it doesn't seem like there's much competition in the Churro arena. The Choriqueso Torta is a homemade chorizo sausage, roasted poblano, artisan jack cheese, tomatillo salsa. The torta come out of the oven about 15 minutes after I ordered. The torta was very flavorful and spicy. I normally do not like onions and poblanos on my sandwich but these were very flavorful but not overpowering. The chorizo was spicy and oozing a bit of yummy pork juices.  I can't wait to get back there and try some of the other tortas and desserts. I will skip the wine next time and stick to other beverages. It was also fun to see Rick Bayless in the kitchen making delicious foods.",0.9798,0.842,0.126,0.031,0.519021164021164
2009-09-09,4.0,"It is awesome.  Go there. We arrived at 6:30pm on their second day and the wait was about twenty minutes.  That's twenty minutes of watching Rick Bayless do his kitchen-thang five feet away and thinking about asking him for a picture.  By the time we were done around 8pm, the line was out the door. Started out with guacamole and chips, which were decent but not mind-blowing.  Then the torta ahogada arrived -- and it was ridiculous.  Mexican-style French-dip-like awesomeness with tender carnitas and spicy tomato salsa-broth.  Had a few bites of the torta milanesa, which was delicious.  Kind of like a panini with crispy chicken and melted cheese.  The spicy seafood caldo was packed with shrimp and mussels, very solid.  Very good food. There is one thing -- it's kind of expensive for an order-at-the-counter place.  Dinner for two (with a couple beers... and we ordered a lot) ended up costing almost $60 including tip.  Kind of weird getting packed in with strangers due to limited seating.  Cool place though, busy but still great service.  Rick Bayless was very involved and welcoming, personally answering questions about the menu and taking pictures with fans.  We'll be back.",0.9778,0.825,0.14,0.035,0.5838419913419914
2009-09-09,4.0,"From the moment I heard they were grinding their own cacao beans on premises, Xoco became a sweet flavored dream. To avoid the opening rush, we got there at 4pm the day after  opening. The only thing that kept me from ordering immediately was staring at smiling, composed, stately Rick Bayless.   We ordered the Pepito Torta (spicy) and the Jamon (griddle) Torta.  Everything was as expected- simple, fresh, super, super tasty.  The cheese on my sandwich literally dripped into my basket.  I just couldn't wait for the sandwich to cool down- but it was more of a cheese sandwich with ham than a ham sandwich with cheese.  A side note- descriptions are slightly deceiving. I expected black beans and avocados on my sandwich and it appears that they were there- in spread form.  A little expensive for a regular lunch....but I am cutting other parts of my budget to make room for  THE CHOCOLATE. We had the Authentic and the Almendrado -both with homemade Dulce de Leche shots.  I am not a fan of almond flavored food or drink so my companion had most of that tasty chocolate concoction - and I'd like to point out that he hates chocolate.  I've actually seen him spit it out of his mouth when catching an accidental bite.  He enjoyed his.  I wanted to dive in and roll around in mine.  We also had the churros (cinnamon sugar bliss!) and a flan topped chocolate cake.  A cake that  caused people who don't seek out  flan (me) or chocolate (him) to fight over the last bite.",0.5482,0.856,0.081,0.064,0.5299181929181929

Since it was opening day I was expecting a line, but I was shocked to see that it wasn't as long as I thought it would be. Sadly they had a sign that said there was no carry out today. I really didn't want to eat there with all the Rick Bayless fan boys. But I really had no other option. I ended up waiting in line for about 20 minutes before I placed an order. The menu isn't that large, maybe 10 different sandwiches. After going back and forth on a couple different options I ordered the Cubana and a chocolate espresso. These two items set me back $15. I thought XOCO was the cheaper of the three Rick Bayless restaurants!  It took a really long time for my Cubana to finally show up at my seat. Bayless and his team need to speed things up here, I'm sure this being opening day had a lot to do with that. I could have had free chips at Frontera and waited just as long. The taste did make up for the long wait.

2009-09-08,4.0,"This was the grand opening.  We went here for dinner (an early dinner as we thought the line was going to be ridiculous).  There was barely a line and like all these previous reviews - Rick Bayless was there overseeing!   The place is a tad small.  The menu is limiting.  But there were several things I wanted to try, regardless of the limited menu.  We went in line twice just so we could try more!  I wasn't expecting  a lunch type place - ie: ordering in line then waiting for someone to bring your food out determined by a number.  The second time we got in line, the place was a lot busier and more crowded.  The line was definitely growing that the Manager had to stop the cashiers from taking orders since all the seats were taken.  We aren't sure how long the line was stopped for, but seeing as the restaurant only had dine-in only for the Grand Opening, it makes sense. Here's a rundown of what we ordered - Torta Ahogada, Cafe Con Leche, Almendrado (Chocolate and Almond Milk), and Churros.  The pork and black bean sandwich dipped in a bowl of a tomato-creamy, spicy broth was a weird combination, but oddly, delicious.  You have to eat the sandwich quickly so it doesn't get that soggy, but if you're like me, I didn't mind a tad sogginess.  The Cafe Con Leche was a normal, a nothing special latte.  The Almendrado was different.  I think the almond milk was a tad overpowering, but you could definitely tell the cocoa beans were freshly grounded.  Worth a try, but I wouldn't order it again  I think I would try a different ""bean-to-cup"" chocolate drink though.  The churros were fried and sugary and amazing.  So simple, yet so good.   I agree with the prior reviews in regards to the service.  It was ""okay.""  Maybe they were stressed.  The cashiers were knowledgeable (as we asked their preferences), but a tad slow.  The sandwiches came out timely for dinner, but you couldn't go for a super quick lunch.  Expect a wait.  The Manager was rude, probably due to her stress.  Definitely not welcoming.  She looks unfriendly and mean, which she is - and her eye-makeup job doesn't help at all, but that's a different story.  Let's just say you don't want her as the Greeter.   Here is my advice to XOCO:  As the servers deliver the food, take the number.  It prevents them from running in circles, and stopping everyone.  (The place isn't that big either and more of a bar seating type place).  Finally, either have a place to drop the dishes off or have the servers grab them more promptly to increase efficiency (Still not sure what we are to do with dishes!) Overall, I would definitely try this place again - especially for the pastries and coffee.  Way to go Rick on another success.",0.9752,0.794,0.124,0.083,0.5305674603174605
