Everyone that worked there was very friendly. I think one guy maybe owner? Had his family there. They all were happy having a good time. Which is nice to see. Our waitress was very nice made our drinks on point. I ordered a mojito which I'm not a fan of but this night I was!

The beer selection is good and they have some fun cocktails.  We tried one with bourbon & lemonade.  My only issue was that there weren't prices on the menu and I didn't see them listed anywhere.  I understand that these places close to Wrigley Field have ""event pricing"", but should that still be conspicuous? We started with the buffalo shrimp and it was excellent.  Lightly fried, two dips on the side, this was a great starter.  We also each had a burger.  We split the Cortland & the Sheffield.  They were huge, cooked well, and had an excellent proportion of toppings/beef/bun.  The Cortland come with avocado and it was magnificent.  They both were, really.  Good luck choosing one!  We also had fries and tater tots on the side.  They were okay, but not special.

Nothing special from the outside (or really on the inside for that matter), but a nice bar, lots of tvs, and good service. The burger list is pretty extensive, and everything I've had there has been really good. There are also a lot of food and drink specials during the week. If you are there on the weekends or post Cubs game, it will be packed, but if you push your way through the crowd and make it to the back bar area, it's never too bad.  Shots come in mini mason jars, but they are not mini shots. Too many mini mason jars served with rumple or fireball with make you experience slight memory loss and hunger for Ian's next door.

It's common knowledge bars in Wrigleyville are an embarrassment of riches. Like a couple hundred in a smallish neighborhood. The deciding factor usually is if they have live music or a dj, if there's specials that tickle your fancy, and if there's a cover. No matter which one you choose you'll be ass to ass and it'll be crazy. These factors or fate led us to The Stretch.  We found a hi top right in front by the window for prime people watching inside and outside. The crowd was pretty fun and friendly and definitely got wild. A few were crazy with the dance moves (guy kept boogieing then landing in the splits, 2 guys gave lap dances, one person did the Carleton, one girl trying to dance with me slapped my ass twice). The music wasn't bad. Old faves with current hits. The margarita was blah. We also ordered beer buckets. Service was great. The waitresses were good. Shrewdly, they posted a security guy by the bathrooms lines to make sure people moved along. The door man was a giant as tall as a 7 foot tree (I asked him his height).  I heard the food is ok from a yelp pal. So I'd go back to try that or just for weekend night fun.",0.9294,0.752,0.153,0.095,0.5017195767195767

I went here last night after receiving a gift certificate from a charity event.  The place is very narrow and long, but the decor is nice with the urban industrial meets earthiness (Lot of metal fixtures with wood paneling on the walls and dark wood tables and chairs). A decent amount of TV's, but they are not all positioned perfectly for each table.  The staff is very attractive and friendly, but I agree with other reviewers that the service can be a little slow at times, especially when ordering. The beer list is a little weak, with no craft or higher-end import or domestics besides Goose Island and Bell's Oberon.  Don't order Guinness here, there must be something wrong with their lines or the keg was old, b/c it tasted a little off....and I drink A LOT of Guinness.  They also offer some cool infused liquor selections and some kitschy cocktails in mason jars (similar to Moonshine).   Food was A-OK.  The Mac&Cheese Fritters were bad-ass...highly recommend.  Crab&Artichoke dip was 'meh, and the burgers were good and affordable, but nothing stunning.  Opening Day Hot Dog was a cheesy bacony take on a Chicago classic. In conclusion, if you are looking for a small and hip place to watch a game...or want some good specials or a new place to try in Wrigleyville, this is worth checking-out.   Also, since it is smaller, it really feels more alive on those Cubs off-season nights where the behemoth Wrigleyville bars feel a little too empty.",0.9672,0.785,0.146,0.068,0.5263390663390662

To me, Stretch is something different. For those who prefer a great deal without sacrificing quality, this review caters to you. In my mind, there is no reason to ever go to Stretch except for burger night on Wednesdays. This is a deal to plan your evening around. One glorious night a week, Stretch serves burgers that almost gives Kuma's a run for their money in terms of deliciousness. Tack on that you'll sit immediately, eat within 30 minutes, and pay half of the price, and it kicks Kuma's overly tattooed ass.  For $5, you have your choice of every burger on the menu. My standby's are the meaty burgers covered in more meat like pulled-pork or steak. That's right. Steak is a TOPPING at Stretch. Somewhere, Ron Swanson just fastened a bib.  The service is ok. One of the Stretch waitresses is always cheery and on her game, the rest are forgettable. But the burger isn't.  For those who argue Kuma's is the best in the city, I agree.

They were at least 25% bigger than most wings I've tried.   For my entree, I went with the Dugout Club. It was a extravaganza of meat. It's a 4 inch tall sandwich that includes Chicken Breast, Ham and two types of cheese. It's rare that I can't finish a entree, but I only got half way through this behemoth of a sandwich.

2011-01-30,5.0,"Man, this sucks. Rarely do I get a chance to make a pun about a business name, and I had some great ones for The Stretch.  I was kind of hoping the experience would be less than stellar (and being located near Wrigley the possibility is always high) so then I could bust out with ""hoo - boy. It would be a STRETCH to make me want to come back here"" or ""everything was already lame, until we got to the HOME STRETCH, where all hell broke loose"" See?  dammit.  Instead, we were greeted by a clean, classy, modern interior, with vaulted ceilings and flat screens covering the walls.  Our server was prompt, helpful and attentive.  We got an order of the ""Hell Yeah"" wings, which were the hottest version they offered. IMO they had a good kick, but of course I say they could always be hotter.  I got the Fielder's Choice burger, which was a lovely, juicy burger covered in blue cheese (you have your choice of 7 different kinds of cheese), on a fluffy bun with perfectly fresh and delicious tomato, lettuce and red onion. This came with a heaping, yet also excellent, order of sweet potato fries.  Andy got a massive club sandwich just piled with meat and cheese. Of course, the longer we were there, the more you could see that this was going to turn into a John Barleycorn-esque drunken meat market for the 21-25 year old set.  And from reading other reviews describing ""Shotski's"" and beer bongs, you know from 9pm on The Stretch turns into another kind of place entirely.  Whether you are into the scene or not, you can have a great time here regardless.  Just make sure you STRETCH out your stomach before you come to handle the oversized portions (oh look, I managed to get one in!)",0.9917,0.796,0.165,0.039,0.5555819507290095

2010-10-10,3.0,"Went here on Thursday night to watch the Hawks opener.  Being that it's on Clark Street in Wrigleyville and that there's about a million tv's, it seemed like it would be a good place to watch a game.  I'm still undecided about this. The waitress was very nice and attentive.  She told us that the audio for the game would be on in the back so we made our way back there.  There were 7 tv's on 3 walls, making it easy for everyone to see the game regardless of what direction they were facing.  The audio was turned on until the 3rd period at which time the dj took over.  The dj was confusing because there were girls feeding money into a jukebox which was right across from the dj.  Not sure if they ever heard their songs, and if the jukebox was not operating due to the dj, then one of the several employees who passed them should have told them. When the game ended, the bar staff immediately turned off 6 of the 7 tv's.  The back bar became very dark as a result, and despite it only being midnight and the place being open until 2AM, it felt like they were telling us to leave.  Yes, we were sitting in the back while the overwhelming majority of the people were crammed in the front (no idea why some people didn't filter into the back as the music was on back there but my assumption is that the type of crowd out past midnight on a Thursday in Wrigleyville likes the closeness). The good news is that the drinks (they had $8 32-ounce long islands and margaritas on special along with beer specials) and the food were great.  I got the grilled cheese with bacon which came with both tomato soup and a choice of a side.  Tons of food that was very good and only $11.  Certainly above the average bar food with a comparable price. So the pros were the waitstaff, the food, and the drinks.  The cons were that the audio was turned off for the third period and we felt like we were unwelcomed after the game ended.  I might be back, I might not. As a side note, there were 2 different softball teams there that night who were sponsored by the Stretch.  So if you're looking for sponsorship, you might want to look here.",0.9885,0.89,0.1,0.01,0.4325504075504076

2009-07-20,1.0,"Awwww, my first flagged and subsequently removed review.  Apparently my two line and drunken (yet still perfectly grammatically constructed and got at least one FUC each) review did not display enough information to convey that I really had stepped foot inside ""The Stretch Bar and Grill.""  I will change that now, because I'm a whiner with a strong opinion. You know that Poison Idea song ""Pure Hate?""  You know, the one where the chorus has the line ""look in my brain and see the hate/it's pure.""  Here's a streaming MP3 -  imeem.com/scottrod/music…   That was the internal soundtrack in my mind, which was unfortunately drowned out by tasteless pop hits.  I've been to hundreds of shows where my ears didn't ring as loud as they did after a couple hours in here.  Why was I here you ask?  A good friend of mine from high school, one who has spent the last six years not living in the city, and subsequently doesn't know much about where to go out, was in town to celebrate her birthday.  If we get a chance to hang out twice a year it's a huge deal; we literally see each other that little.  So despite my misgivings and begging not to go into Wrigleyville, I was overruled and my quest to hang out with my friend put me into my personal hell.   Little did any of us know but apparently Wrigley Field had just hosted Rascal Flats that night so the neighborhood was a hoppin'.  Crap.  So ""The Stretch Bar and Grill.""  The front area was so congested that it took a couple minutes to even make it to the back.  I'm amazed that in a place where I managed to overhear ""Fags"" and ""Bitches"" used in an obviously derogatory connotation (heard these colorful terms while using the bathroom, which was the only place I really could hear) did not see a problem cramming so many sweaty men into such a tiny area and into such compromising positions. Once done wading through the cramped opening we made into all the way to the back where it was still packed but slightly less so.  I ambled up to the bar and waited a good long time before getting any attention; it's a crowded bar I know but still.  Luckily a table opened up so we plopped ourselves around the table and I took the role of ""that guy sitting down scowling instead of dancing.""  Fucking Rashida Jones could have showed up and asked me for a dance and I wouldn't have done it.  I did notice out of the corner of my eye that the bartenders were dancing quite a bit though, which is kind of counteractive to their job.   Eventually the horrid meat market/stockyard atmosphere began to grate everyone and I was asked if I knew any other places in the area that were better than this.  THANKS FOR ASKING FINALLY, JEEZ!  I let them know about The Gingerman, described it a little bit and sold even the frattiest frat boy I know that leaving was a solid business plan. So what did I walk out of ""The Stretch Bar and Grill"" with?  I walked out with the smell of Axe clinging to me from the leaving effort, two ringing ears and less self respect.  So yes, I was here.  I survived two hours; can you do any better? Addendum 1 - Bathroom floor was completely covered in piss and broken glass.  I'm pretty sure a rip in the canvas of my shoes occurred while using said bathroom.   Addendum 2 - One thing I liked?  Hamm's.  Very cold Hamm's.  It may have cost as much for one can as a six pack does at a store but at least it was Hamm's.",0.9919,0.846,0.11,0.044,0.4801254480286737

I have to say the burger was fantastic.  It came piled high atop a fluffy square bun, each ingredient visible in the stack, delicious and present in every bite.  The turkey patty was obviously handmade and it was extremely well seasoned.  I couldn't quite identify the flavors that had permeated the meat but they were very enjoyable.  Finally, the french fries were pretty standard as well but were seasoned with some large grain kosher salt, a nice touch that kicked them just a notch above ordinary.
