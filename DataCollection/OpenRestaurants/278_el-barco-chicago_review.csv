2017-08-17,2.0,"I ate here a couple of weeks ago as a group of 6 girls for a friend's birthday dinner.   Overall I would not recommend this restaurant as you have SO many choices for authentic Mexican food in Chicago and this was underwhelming on food and service.  First, we were sitting on their covered patio and it was windy and started to rain.  They looked baffled that we asked to put down the plastic rain sheets and then once they finally did they didn't secure them properly so they were banging around in the wind and one almost hit my friend in the head after a strong gust.  Then once the rain and wind stopped they struggled heartily to get them rolled back up.   The food was extremely underwhelming; small portions of the main fish or meat in the dish - mostly just mushy vegetables and cheap rice/beans.  Servers never checked on us; every time we needed something we had to wave/yell to flag them over to our table, and by the way it was a very low key Wednesday when the restaurant was not busy at all.",-0.3824,0.909,0.033,0.058,0.4699415204678362

The meal was solid - think of your average neighborhood Mexican restaurant. The steak was well seasoned but a little too chewy. Loved the selection of hot sauce they had.  My friends and I suspect that our service was was terrible due to the fact that the server knew she'd be tipped regardless of service quality (we had a large group and gratuity would automatically be included). The server did not refill our water once; completely forgot to bring my buddy's order out; and generally seemed uninterested in doing her job.  I was astonished service could be so bad on a random Wednesday night with the restaurant only half full.

2016-09-04,1.0,"Re: Carmen  I was there last year October for the first visit and sometime in June this year. A friend did recently recommend your ceviche over everything else but to be honest I am still not over my bad experience and doubt I'll be back.  I don't understand what the hoopla and the lines at this place are all about!!!!! What is their go to dish?! Someone enlighten me!!!! I waited to write this review because to be fair, the first time I dined here I was in a very ""Pissy"" mood before I even got to the place; but I gotta say-giving this place a 1 star is being generous.  First of all, the tables are practically on top of each other. I don't know about you, but I need space to eat!!!!  Due to the lack of space my lap got a taste of a whole plate of rice and two sodas  and we had absolutely NO Napkins at our table.  A waiter acknowledged the spill so I thought: ""he must be coming with napkins""  -well No!  After a wait that seemed eternal I had to get myself napkins from the patrons next to us. The cherry on top?! We had a bigger table before but we were asked to give it up for another party! Because we were nice enough to give up our table we got a free guacamole; which was the ""best"" thing on the menu we tried but even that needed work.  I like to taste the lime in my guac-so I asked for lots of limes.  I was given and charged $1 for 3 slices!  The guac was certainly NoT made fresh since I asked to hold the tomatoes and was denied the request.  The food is simply inadequate----I don't know where the clientele at el Barco usually have their seafood but this place gives you a whiff of seafood at about $30 per plate. We ordered the snowcrab plates different ways which mainly consisted of 3 legs, about of cup of rice and a fistful of salad with a corny orange on top.  The bill was unsettling at almost $200!! I returned from the bathroom to find that the darling husband had already paid-but the numbers didn't add up so I asked to see the bill. We were overcharged but the cashier refused to give us a refund. I immediately asked to speak to the manager. After a 30 minute wait and still no manager, I finally decided my time was more valuable so I left highly disappointed.  Save yourself---across the street a joint called 'El Veneno' does it much better. I gotta say I'm not a fan of that particular spot (I like the one on 61st street much better) but I'll take it over el Barco anyday!",0.9921,0.788,0.148,0.065,0.4764478764478765

For dinner I had the mahi mahi fajitas and my girl ordered steak and shrimp; both dishes were delicious. Only draw back was they forgot to bring us our appetizer.

We told another waitress about the ceviche size (because our waitress never came back) and she didn't do anything about it, packed up our food and gave us the check.

I highly recommend the butterflied grilled shrimp - it's garlicky and has tons of seasoning. We also got the grilled calamari and decided we will never go to El Barco again without ordering it!!

It was delicious, scrumptious and fantastic all put together. I am not a big fan of refried beans and I scraped my plate, they were that good!

Michelada with camarones(shrimp)will set you back $ and it was not what I expected. Shrimp were obviously frozen then cooked. The drink was not as great either it was lacking flavor. The plate i ordered was carne asada with camarones a la diabla(spicy shrimp) meat was chewy with some hints of salt(could of been more flavorful) the shrimp was inedible by myself as it was hotter then flavorful once again. The amount of rice and beans it very generous but way way way too greasy. You can see the grease as it just sits on top of refried beans. The tortillas were already hard and cold even though they were wrapped in foil. The only great thing about my meal was the vegetables(mexican zucchini ,carrots, and broccoli,with a small piece of whole corn.) It was a party of 4 with similar meals for a whopping $150. The waitress never came back to our table and the music was exaggeratedly high. Had to ask for 1 cup of water at the end because I was just ready to wash my food down and make an exit.

The dish is overpriced and flavorless. Its almost as if they dont season the fish... they just fry it and pour sauce over it. We went around 2pm and the place was not busy at all. It took a long time for us to get served and while waiting around 45 mins for our food not once did the waitress stop by to check up on us to see if we wanted a refill on our drink.

Not only were the entrées bland overall, but one of the empanada appetizers actually contained a long metallic fiber from a Brillo pad. After my girlfriend pulled this disgusting discovery from between her teeth and presented it to one of the servers they simply took away the partially eaten empanada and came back 20 mins later with another. Nobody cared to apologize or offer to adjust our bill... Nothing, we were just another table to turn and seat the next unassuming guest. It was my first time going there and I was apprehensive as I've heard mediocre reviews from friends who had dined there in the past, needless to say it will be my last. Fool me once, shame on you... Fool me twice shame on me. Don't bother waiting in the line here, trust it's not worth the wait.",-0.8017,0.748,0.112,0.14,0.3957671957671957
2015-12-30,1.0,"So, I'm on vacations in México, just went to a seafood place with my family, food was great, and I remember that I've been wanting to write this review for a while. El Barco, WORST Mexican seafood in Chicago, why? 1.- Food: Just awful, rice with seafood was just sticky, salty and way too buttery, cocktails are flavorless and octupus is either under or overcooked. I read a reply from a El Barco staff member saying that ""we specialize in authentic Mexican food, like the one that u get in México, that's why some people are unfamiliar with the food"". Haha, no, no, no sweetheart, the food u serve there couldn't be less authentic, and I can say that cause I grew up in México, I know what real Mexican food taste like.  If u raid your spices cabinet and throw it all in a pan or cauldron add oil, garlic and onions, yes you'll get a flavory sauce, I doubt thats authentic Mexican though. 2.- Service: I wish some owners focused on hiring efficient waitresses with some people's skills instead of just ""pretty"" ones (subjective) with a bitchy attitude (objective). I had to beg for my waitress' attention, after a few tries, she turn to me, sporting a face that almost said ""talk to the hand"" lol. Come on!! I'm not trying to ask u out or your number, just wanted to ask something about the menu, damn it lol. I observed the situation for a while and it seemed that all the waitresses are annoyed or upset about something, specially when.serving fellow Mexicans. 3.- Prices: Downtown prices for JJ Fish quality food. I've been to this place a few times, first time cause I wanted to try it out, second one, well, I wanted to give it a ""second chance"", my mistake. 3rd and 4th time, I was dragged there by friends, I would never go back there on my free will. If u wanna pay downtown prices for JJ Fish food and hot dog stand service, go ahead, u won't be disappointed! !!! :) You'll find better food in a mom and pop small place though.",0.9813,0.757,0.157,0.086,0.4522321428571429

We had a couple of appetizers, all were very tasty and for not being much of a seafood lover I can vouch for them as yummy.   I spilled some sauce on my white shirt and some of the servers were very nice and offered ideas and help on the spot so I was able to get the stain out in the washroom! Food and service was good until the end when payment time came. I paid with my debit card but did not want to tip with card rather personally hand cash to our server so when she brought the receipt with my card I asked for change for her tip as I had a large bill. I guess she thought she deserved more than 20% and brought back although smaller all were still larger than her tip amount. I did not like that she tried being slick and made me feel pressured into leaving a greater amount so I just left her the tip on the card for the amount I wanted to give.mHer service was good but not 40% tip good.",0.9668,0.838,0.132,0.03,0.4430827067669173

That line had an amount that added to the bill, another 6 dollars and change and nobody could explain why. Everything else we ordered was listed but this extra charge was for nothing. If I hadn't looked at the detailed bill, they would have gotten away with it. Just an FYI.  El Barco continues to disappoint with the service and it's a shame because 99% of the time the food is awesome. But unfortunately when you have servers that could care less, no matter how good the food is, bad service ruins the entire meal.

So everything started ok, we got seated right away and the waitress came by to greet us. However that's pretty much the only good thing I have to say...... My kids plates were brought with the appetizers (about 20 minutes before mine and my husbands plates arrived) we were left without silverware so pretty much ate their food with a tostada. My husband finally seen our waitress at the bar had to get up and ask her for some because she pretty much had disappeared!! Finally by the time our food got to the table the kids were finished and pretty restless. I ordered the langostinos which were cold and flavorless :( I am a regular at Veneno and Islas so I know my prawn!!!!! My husband had the red snapper and the presentation was good but the Diabla sauce that came was inedible it was pretty much just smashed chipotle peppers!!!!

IMHO the item that excels at this place is absolutely free, the smoked pepper spread that they bring out with the chips. Beyond fantastic. My tip would be to come off hours to dodge the masses, have a drink, and pig out on the smoked pepper spread.

I get it, they are laughably big, but it provides for added entertainment surely? 2) crowded seating - please visit Paris then get back to me on crowded seating. I think the fact it is cosy is all part of the atmosphere, so try and dig it! 3) mushy sweetcorn - I am grateful for any vegetables adorning my plate in this country. I can name countless places where their idea of vegetables counts as deep fried green beans.I welcome the veg with open arms and it's a welcome break from the spicyness of everything else. Who really cares if one item is slightly overdone? perhaps this is not the place for you? 4) shrimp with heads - these are langoustines, make sure you order them! The shrimp without heads are just as good too! 5) fishy ceviche - 'nuff said, of course it is FISHY. It's made of fish. My favourites: - mixed ceviche - langoustines el barco - shrimp el diabla - calamares el ajo - red snapper  - snow crab legs I am a seafood lover and bounce back between this place and Fahlstrom's Fish Market in Lakeview.

2015-07-06,3.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed the fried red snapper, and the ceviche was delicious; generous portions. The margaritas were very good as well and inexpensive. I also ordered a side of refried beans that I really liked!  The reasons why I am only giving this place 3 stars is first off, because they put me and my boyfriend in the worst spot to sit. We try not to be complainers but I wish I had said something. They put us right by the host stand/computers, where most of the traffic flowed through. My boyfriend was constantly getting bumped by the bussers, and the waitresses would be standing right over there all veering there way around my boyfriend who was sitting on the corner. It was distracting and uncomfortable. This restaurant is small, although it looks way bigger from the outside. They should not have that table we were sitting at be a place to sit at all; not nice whatsoever.  Lastly, the service was just okay. The waitresses were not very nice and seemed annoyed and even bothered when I asked for things. A very unwelcoming attitude overall. We were given one word answers and questions that were bothersome, such as, ""Ready?"", ""Drinks?"" ""Done?"" ""Beans"" (as she practically threw the side of beans that took over 15 minutes to get to my table). We also felt rushed, we were not even done with our food yet, when she asked ""Done?"" Like no, we are still sitting here, enjoying our food and taking time to eat it. Even after we paid, our waitress watched us sign our bill, and grabbed it right as we put our pen down and looked at the tip right in front of us, which by the way I've worked in the industry and that's a major NO-NO. We left a good tip regardless. I never tip less than 20% even if I wasn't entirely satisfied with my dining experience.  Although the food was delicious, I feel like restaurants forget that even though people come to eat good food, they also come for the experience and kind service. That for me can be the difference between just an OK place and an EXCELLENT place.  And like others have said, the SALSA IS VERY SPICY.

I don't get all the rave reviews, maybe they haven't tried really good seafood like we have on the southside, I dunno.  Food: Everything was super salty! The rice had way too much seasoning & way too much salt, same with vegetables. The shrimp was not even peeled, the skin was still on, yuck!  There were 4 of us & no one liked their dish. The skirt steak had no flavor & my mom who had the fish soup said the fish was hard & had no more than 2 bites of it. Even the piece of corn on the cob that they give you was weird, it was so overlooked & mushy I didn't even eat that. The mango margaritas were just that, certainly nothing special. Nobody even took their leftovers, and we had A LOT of leftovers.  I really tried to like this place but I've had way, WAY better seafood than this. I really don't know how this place is so busy.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the owner/manager was super nice & went out of his way to accommodate me & even ran over to avoid customers' cars getting tickets from CPD for blocking other cars.  The restaurant itself is very crowded, a lot smaller than it seems from the outside & super cramped. Chairs are super hard & uncomfortable. All the waiters, waitresses seemed annoyed because they had to navigate around all the customers waiting to be seated.

We ordered the Parrillada for three people. And boy oh boy is that a huge serving. It has chicken, mahi mahi, calamari, octopus, shrimp, steak, prawns, and even crab legs.  It is easy to overcook calamari and octopus and I am usually very weary about ordering them anywhere. However, at El Barco. Wow! They are both tender and delicious.  The steak was tender, the grilled chicken had a deliciously sweet/ tangy taste, the mahi mahi was moist, and even the grilled veggies were grilled perfectly.  The tables are communal and each has a key lime basket. The basket is so smart because I love me some line with my lime juice with my sea food.

Me, wanting to look for another option for my mom, I asked the waitress to call the manager just to see what he could do, not much for complaining.

It was a lot of food so maybe I'll split it next time as most people should know, seafood is only best when eaten fresh (obv. if you take it home to reheat, it's going to come out looking a little hungover). One of the girls ordered the langostinos and that was delicious if you love explosions of flavor in your mouth. Another girl had the fish tacos. I didn't try them and she said they were decent. I can't wait to go back during the summer and enjoy a margarita outside with some more ceviche. Perhaps with one of those fried fish that everyone's talking about. or langostinos. yum.

The fish was over fried, it was dry, and the chipotle butter was lack luster. The snapper plate came with rice, beans, mixed veggies, and some guacamole. I was told that the portion of the guacamole was small and ended up ordering a side of guacamole, which turned out to be too much guac. The guacamole was decent. I would have prefer some kick to it, like adding jalapenos or something. In addition, we also ordered the grilled octopus, which was very tender, sweet, and needed more salt. I was told by the waitstaff that most people tend to load on the sauces so they don't typically add much salt to it. On top of that, we also had a pound of prawns, which included the heads on it.

So hot it made me drink almost half of my margarita to get the fucking taste off of my tongue. They should have a least warned me it was gonna be extremely hot but when you dip your chip in it and try it you wouldn't think your tongue would fall off. Try it at your own risk.  The other salsa (I guess that's what it was) was good at first then it got weird on my taste buds.  So I asked the waitress what was it.  She said it's pepper and oil. I really didn't know what that meant and she didn't stick around to discuss it with me.  I didn't give up though. When she came by the table again I asked her what was the actual name of it. Thinking I would Google it and learn more about it. She replied it doesn't have a name they just make it, as she quickly moves to another table to avoid any other conversation about it. Now you know that was some bullshit. She knew damn well what the name of it was, cause when they need to make more of it someone in the back yells ""hey we need more of the black stuff"".

My bf and I dined here on New Year's Day as we were looking to cure the effects of the previous night's par-tay;) El Barco definitely did the trick. Well first of all, they were open. It's hard to find places to dine on New Year's Day but El Barco proved to actually be sort of packed...I think some party revelers had the same idea as us.  I started with a mango margarita. OH LORD this was the worlds largest margarita...it was large enough to bathe in, but I chose to drink it instead. Delicious, and full of tequila! Scoreeeee. The chips and guac that came next were were very fresh and accompanied my marg perfectly. We also chose the queso fundido for an app. It had the option of coming with shrimp, which we ordered on the side, and that gave it an interesting twist. The fundido was good, but very very greasy.  For the mains, I ordered the steak tacos. LOVED!!!! The steak was so fresh and they appeared at the table piping hot as they came individually wrapped with a personal helping of cilantro and onion on the side so you can chose to put as much, or as little as you like. Hands down best steak tacos to date. My bf had the fish tacos which were good...they were light, not fried like most fish tacos. Although we were in the mood for fatty and fried. Both taco platters also came with a side of rice and beans.  Overall the portions and quality of food at El Barco can not be beat.

We had Margs and modelos to start and a fish empanada. Everything was great. The empanada was probably the cheapest thing on the menu (less than $3) and the size was reflective of the price. But it was a great item to share while we waited for our entrees.  My boyfriend had the steak fajitas. Much bigger portion than what you get at most places. Lots of rice and veggies, beans and guac. No cheese but they were great. I had the garlic shrimp. Also delish. Such big portions though! We could have easily split one entree although we didn't want the same things :) I ended up taking 12 shrimps home. There must have been more than 35 on the plate. Yum.  No dessert for us. The place was very authentic and filled with locals. Can't wait to come back and sit outside in the summer.",0.9822,0.828,0.142,0.031,0.5744444444444444

There is something about the atmosphere here that reminds me very much of Mexico -- not just the bustle and the many happy families, but also the rack of limes, salt and hot sauces which you're expected to combine with the tostadas and salsas to assemble your meal.  I could imagine this place in Puerto Nuevo; apparently their two other locations are in Mexico City and Houston.  Highly recommended for a cold or snowy day when you'd like to imagine that you're a thousand miles or so to the south.",0.9772,0.845,0.138,0.017,0.6623015873015872

Came here for lunch on a Sunday around 2pm, this place was packed! Managed to get the last table available. The menu is HUGE, not only with choices but the mere size of the menu took the entire table!  Ended up choosing the two options most popular on yelp: whole red snapper and the seafood platter for 2. This was shared between 4 people. Plenty of food and we managed to finish pretty much everything and were stuffed! Definitely don't order the seafood platter for 4, it would be way too much food.  The red snapper was made with garlic and fried ($36). I love garlic but I couldn't taste it at all. Not much seasoning on the fish but it wasn't overcooked and still pretty tasty. The seafood platter had octopus (surprisingly really good and tender, slightly charred),  calamari, shrimp (overcooked), mussels (a little fishy), crab legs (moist and delicious), mahi mahi, and fried fillet of fish: All for $58. That's a steal for the amount of food we consumed. We also ordered frozen margaritas, their ""small"" ones are called enormous and they truly are.

So we ordered an appetizer the pulpo a la plancha and it was was phenomenal, prob best octopus plate ive had yet. After that I ordered camarones sarandeados and she ordered camarones empanizados (her favorite).

I tried the rice myself it was just ok. My plate was slighlty above average, the adobe flavor on shrimp was good but overall flavor of plate was ok.

Our favorite was the carne patas -a juicy, tender skirt steak cooked to perfection (medium rare) with crab legs. Holy cow was that good!!!  The grilled shrimp was amazing too! And the mahi mahi with diablo sauce? Another winner!! Guacamole, salsa, sides, everything was fabulous.  It's tight quarters and very crowded.

Several times I have not finished my appetizer , or barely started and I'm being served my main dish. To be fair this is not the only restaurant which has been guilty of this.

We had to wait a bit on a Saturday night, but it was not a huge problem because they had us seated within when they told us they would. Not all restaurants do that! Upon being seated, you have at your table a basket full of saltines (?) and tiny limes. A bit random, but unique and kind of cool! The guacamole people at my table ordered was incredible. We also had a frozen and regular margarita pitcher, and I liked the frozen that I tried.  I knew the selling point was seafood, so I got shrimp ceviche and really liked it. I expected a bit more from it in terms of ingredients (love jicama, cilantro, etc. in mine!), and I found a small shell in it. It was had good flavor, but I might get the tomato sauce-laden shrimp cocktail next time! The main dishes here are ENORMOUS. They can feed two people easily. But let me back up - I got the carne asada fajitas, but I also wanted some shrimp, and they let me mix the two (not sure if they usually mix them, so adjust expectations). Unlike many Americanized fajita plates, this one comes with a huge variety of vegetables (corn, broccoli, peppers, onions, and more). The shrimp was delicious and so was the perfectly cooked steak. By the way, I think I ate about 1/4 of it at most. It was so big. And other plates are big, too, such as the snapper AKA an entire fried fish. It is a cool restaurant, too, because it feels like a real neighborhood spot and not somewhere that's trying too hard and either overpriced or takes itself too seriously (love you, Big Star, but...yeah...).

The decor is pretty cool with an entire wall full of different tequilas. There are large fish hanging from the ceiling and mariachi blasting from the speakers. We got our complimentary chips which were more like tostadas and they arrived with two different salsas. One was very dark which resembled molé but it was very deep in flavor. I really like it! The second one was orange in color and also had great flavor... Both had a good kick to them. We ordered apps. We got the shrimp empanadas and 6 oysters. The empanadas were perfect. They had a really nice, luxurious filling and the outside was nice and crisp. It came with a Chipotle mayo. The oysters on the other hand.... That was a failure. I use to work at Frontier and definitely know my oysters. They came to me without being disconnected from their abducter muscle so I had to flounder with them with my fork which just felt foolish. Not Only that but instead of putting them on a bed of ice they just put cubes of ice right in the oyster. THIS MAKES NO SENSE. The most important part of an oyster is it's natural liquor inside and the ice just waters that down. Some one needs to train these guys on how to serve their oysters. I ordered a pitcher of their margaritas! Lime, blended, and they were delicious and cost effective ;) Next was the entrée. My friend ordered chicken enchiladas. I felt bad because she was the one that talked this place up and she ended up having to send her entire plate back because El Barco was heavy handed on the salt. The plate did look good though. The waitress was very kind about the situation and took them off our bill. I ordered shrimp tacos. They came with rice and beans on the side and interestingly enough the tacos came individually wrapped. I was kind of disappointed because the tacos didn't come with any veg inside... Just meat and cheese. Pretty boring but they did taste good. El Barco has some good stuff going for them. They are definitely different and they have some unique flavor. The service is good, also. They really need to work on some key things, though, like how to properly handle their seafood and how to hold back on the salt.

Meaning,  l took someone else's food. I did not believe what was being told to me. I believed that the hair was simply removed from the dish and I was served the same food.

My boyfriend wanted the tamarindo margarita but they were out of them. I wanted a blended margarita but their blenders had broken, instead i got a margarita on the rocks. Kind of a bummer.  - I ordered a ceviche, which I was sick of eating by the time I got halfway. And I love ceviche! My boyfriend ordered a tilapia and it was alright. Enjoyed the veggies and fish, but the rice was really salty!  Check came and ended up being around $60 (with tip) So was it worth it? Probably not.

2014-05-31,5.0,"Full and drunk, two sensations I don't often feel together but did after my delicious meal at El Barco. We arrived and were seated outside after about a 10 minute wait. We got a pitcher of strawberry margarita immediately and man was it tasty. I'm told that it's made with fresh fruit. It really hit the spot on a warm summer evening. We then ordered the steak fajitas and a plate of rice and seafood after munching on some toastadas. The plate I got was pretty epic...a huge slate of rice, calamari, octopus, shrimp, potatoes, and guac. It's kind of hard to find really good seafood around Wicker, so El Barco is definitely a treat for me. It's a little pricey, but definitely worth it for the portions. The one thing that bothered me about the outside seating was that there was a lot of fuzz flying around. Not sure where it was coming from but it was enough to make note. Outside of that, really good service and food overall. I'll be back, and not just because I live across the street.",0.9894,0.764,0.204,0.032,0.5013285024154591

The only negative I'd say is they don't take reservations so we had to wait 20+ mins (granted it was a Friday night at 8pm). And the place is small so your kind of squished like a sardine while waiting but it's ok we just salivated over the great looking food and drinks! The food is amazing and the portions are very generous. The atmosphere is fun and the decoration is unique (covered in tequilla). The margaritas are so good and very fresh, it looks like they use fruit to make it right there.  Now the food is outstanding. We got one of the special to share for 4 and they literally brought out a HUGE tray of seafood (so fresh and tasty) and meat (seasoned and prepared very well). Everything we saw on other people's tables while waiting was jaw dropping too. Highly recommends for good foood and a fun time!",0.9973,0.642,0.335,0.023,0.5891836734693878

2014-05-04,1.0,"For months now, I have been passing by this restaurant wanting to try it as I love seafood and Mexican food, but alas, no one who was with me at these times wanted to go there with me...Hindsight tells me that the universe was trying to warn me...lol...I finally got a ""taker"" to come enjoy some Mariscos with me today, there was a line outside the door which to me was a good sign, but after we were seated it was another story. We ordered guacamole as an appetizer, who can mess up guacamole? I make it at home all the time! Well obviously this establishment can, because the guacamole while looking very fresh and lovely, was so salty it was inedible! I like salt in my food, but this was horrible! We asked the waitress to bring us a new batch with less salt and after 15 minutes she came back and said that all the guacamole was made from the same batch for the day, so if we got more, it would be just as salty! So she asked us if we would like to try something else, so my dinner partner ordered the calamari that is cooked in a garlic white wine sauce. We waited another 15 minutes before that arrived...Good taste,to the seasoning, too bad the calamari was the consistency of rubber...either a sign that it was overcooked or sat for a time before it was served! Either way, it was left uneaten. Next up, we ordered a platter for two, that consisted of shrimp, ma-hi ma-hi, chicken, muscles, prawns, octopus, fried fish, skirt steak, crab legs, and veggies and beans and rice...let me break down this platter by what was edible...The Shrimp was very good, tasty with a lot of garlic, I love garlic! I do not eat chicken or beef, but my dining partner does and after having to search for it under all of the fish, he found it to be very tough, so did not finish it. There was absolutely no ma-hi ma-hi on the platter, but by this time we were afraid to ask where it was hiding because we are not big complainers! The prawns were basically shells re-stuffed with bread crumbs, octopus was good as were the crab legs, but obviously not a lot of either of these two items to make up for what was lacking in the bountiful servings of the items that didnt taste good. the muscles were questionable as several of them in the mix were not open, and I know all too well what muscles that will not open when cooked means! The battered fried fish that was sitting on the top of the platter were large, but tasted undercooked, which was surprising as the meats were tough and overcooked. This platter was NOT worth the approximately fifty bucks they charge for it! I would have been better off going to one of the smaller mexican restaurants on Ashland ave. in the vicinity and had a much better dining experience! This ""Platter"" turned into a dinner for 4, as we brought home the majority of leftover food and gave it to our 2 dogs, hope they dont suffer any gastro-intestinal issues overnight! But I will not be going back to El Barco any time soon!  Before I post this, I want to also mention one more thing! The state of a restaurants bathrooms says a lot about its quality and while waiting for our appetizer, I needed to run to the Ladies room. I entered a single stalled bathroom that reeked of urine, and had toilet paper covering the bathroom floor...only no toilet paper on an actual roll on the toilet paper dispenser! Did they honestly want me to pick a piece up off the floor and use that? Thank goodness, I had some tissue in my purse! I should have ran after the bathroom experience and saved some money! But alas, I did not! At least we learn from our mistakes and like I said, I will not be returning any time soon!",0.9946,0.807,0.13,0.064,0.46285891496417814

ODD.  The fish was accompanied by Mexican rice, squash, carrots, green beans, one piece of small corn and half a potato.  The presentation was very good looking!  Until it hit my palate, the entire thing was cold!!  The huachinango was very plain, tasteless, good thing they had valentina sauce and limones on the side.   Also, I ordered a Margarita that arrived to the table in 15 secs (okay, maybe 30 secs lol)  These drinks are pre-made, and stored in their fridge, you gotta be kidding me!!

2014-01-06,3.0,"Good stuff. As far as I can tell, most dishes are large enough to split if you aren't starving - if you are, there are plenty of appetizers (but few desserts). I've had shrimp each of the three times I've visited, and have left (overly) full and happy, particularly due to all of the other delicious things on the platter: roasted vegetables, guacamole, and rice. Totally worth the money for two if you can split something - otherwise it gets pricey quickly. Despite this praise, El Barco really isn't anything outstanding. There are far too many TVs for the small space, so I  hope you like Spanish-language music videos! Service is fine but inattentive. It's quite loud and can get claustrophobic quickly. In the summer, you can wait outside, but in the winter, you and 15 of your brand new closest friends will be crowded together in the entrance, buffeted back and forth by servers with enormous platters of food and other diners coming and going. I'm not sure that the salsa you're served is intended for dipping - or how fresh the ""chips"" - entire tortillas - are. I've also never figured out what exactly you're supposed to do with the basket of tiny limes. The michelada, however, is a total steal.

On the first occasion we were seated in the left corner of the restaurant, which is really dark and I did not appreciate nor enjoy the ambiance there. The second time we were seated in the main dining room and it was great. My advice is to turn up the lighting alot in that left corner! Note that if you order certain beers, there are the large sizes which I think are not too much more, and they'll pour half and bring the other half of the bottle in a bucket and keep it on ice table side, pretty sweet! On to the food, which is without a doubt first class!... On my first trip we had the deep fried red snapper in garlic sauce and it was amazing!!! We also got the octopus diablo, which had a great meaty texture to it and the diablo sauce is nice and tangy yet spicy with a kind of chipotle kick to it, overall a really tasty sauce. The snapper itself is huge so it's plenty to share, you could probably share it between 3 if you wanted to. There's also some sort of a yellow seasoned rice that comes in a healthy portion around the fish as a compliment but I have to say it's likely the best seasoned Mexican rice I've ever had -- so good it's hardly a side dish but more of a main attraction! On my second visit, I ordered what I believe was called the Caldo de Muchos Mariscos, which is a huge seafood soup. It comes out piping hot with all sorts of seafood hanging out of it, including crab legs! It's really, really hefty and I couldn't even finish it. The seafood was great and the broth was spicy and great for a cold winter day (though on this particular day it was a warm Summer night, not the best choice in a poorly ventilated dining room, haha).

2013-06-03,3.0,"Went to El Barco again this past Friday, and it was not nearly as good as last time.  Service was not as prompt or attentive.   I ordered the shrimp stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon.  I had asked the server if I should order that or the shrimp enchiladas, and went with her recommendation.  Bad choice. First, the bacon was SALTY!  And not just a hint of salt...I felt like a cow licking a salt lick.  The salty bacon overpowered everything, and was not tasty at all.  It was so bad I had to peel off the bacon because I could not eat it (and I *LOVE* bacon, so thats saying a lot).   Second, the shrimp had a lot of shells still on them.  You would assume when they are wrapped in bacon (and stuffed), that the kitchen staff would remove ALL the shells (and Im not talking about the shell at the bottom by the tail, Im talking about the ""meat"" of the shrimp) So not only was I eating salty bacon, but I was crunching on shells.  Which was DISGUSTING.  I had to spit out a few bites.  And it was not just one shrimp that had a piece of shell, it was probably half my order.  I ended up not even finishing my meal, and eating some of my fiance's shrimp (grilled - much better choice).   And the final low point of the meal?  The veggies that come on the side with my shrimp were COLD.  Not warm, not cooling....COLD.   So to recap:  Poor service, SUPER salty bacon, unpeeled shrimp, and cold veggies. The meal (literally) left a bad taste in my mouth.  Might think twice before going there again.  And that makes me sad, because my first meal was so good.  Now Im not sure which is the norm for this place.",-0.9699,0.845,0.044,0.11,0.5597222222222221

We were quoted 20 minutes, which seemed reasonable so we headed over. Well, 20 minutes turned into 45 minutes....just as I was suggesting we go somewhere else our name was finally called. We surmise that they must tell EVERYONE 20 minutes because that's just about the amount of time anyone would be willing to stick around to wait (we saw a group of friends there, who came separately, who were also told ""20 minutes"" and waited approximately 40-45 as well). The dining room is small and almost uncomfortably cramped. There is absolutely no elbow room on the table if you are sitting next to someone. Luckily they don't cram you in there so tight that you don't have any room to back your chair up! The table is also crammed with saltines (couldn't figure out why) and tons of sauces. Frankly, all that stuff is just clutter that takes up valuable real estate. The service was.....not the greatest. The waitress didn't bother bringing us menus the first time she came to the table; we actually had to ask for menus (WHAT?!!?). Several times we had to ask for additional napkins, remind her to bring us our margarita pitcher we ordered and she never came by to check on it, we always had to flag her down.

We got one of the seafood sampler platters that said it fed 4....but honestly it could probably feed 6 people (we had 5 in our party). Everything was cooked to perfection, and thankfully the only thing the waitress delivered on time was the food, so it was still very hot. The margaritas are also very good--we got the lime flavor on the rocks. There is a decent amount of alcohol, not an overly generous amount, but as much as I would expect.

This dish was quite yummy with just the right flavor! Our appetizer on the other hand was a different story. We got the spicy grilled octopus which was slathered in a thick sauce which wasn't spicy and had the consistency of mole. We definitely don't recommend it.

She did not come by to check on us, NOT one time! Strike 2! My boyfriend was done with his drink and you would think they would readily offer to bring more drinks but we actually had to flag her down for another one which she never brought until we reminded her another 15min later. You would think this would be Strike 3 but not yet. We were so disgusted by the lack of service that we just asked for the check which she brought back promptly along with the drink we asked for oh so long ago. My boyfriend didn't even want his drink at this point so we just left. We then saw the manager outside and I proceeded to tell him about our horrible experience and he just nodded his head and blankly stared at me. Offered no apologies or anything! I guess he was more concerned with moving his car than talking to a dissatisfied customer. So here was Strike 3! So as they say, Strike 3...you're out! You're outta here El Barco!

2012-08-18,4.0,"My co-workers and I enjoy going out after work on Friday and we decided on El Barco. The service was attentive and the food was very good. The tortillas and spicy sauces served on the table were good appetizers. I ordered the Salmon Rellenos for my main course. It was foil-wrapped, steamy deliciousness. The salmon was tender and well-cooked and the accompanying shrimp were perfect. I really enjoyed the side vegetables (zucchini, corn, carrots, peppers, potatoes). I found that the guacamole was lacking a bit of salt, but that was easily remedied. However, I thought the rice served with the fish was incredibly salty and it was my least favorite part of the meal. I ordered a standard margarita on the rocks, which I felt was pretty tame and didn't pack enough wallop for me.  All in all, El Barco serves really delicious, fresh seafood and should not be missed!",0.9788,0.787,0.193,0.02,0.6566666666666667

All other times went there it was very busy and for them to keep up w the service i think they pre-cooked a lot of the sea food and it tasted very bland! no flavor at all. for last time i guess we went there yesterday and i ordered some grilled calamari and they looked bad and tasted the same. very greasy and had a black color i guess maybe from the grill that wasn't cleaned for a long time. i told them about it and they took it back but i didnt order anything else because i didnt wanted to get another bad plate. They give u a lot of food but not quality. for the prices they charge i think they could do better, but maybe its not in their interest.  not only my food wasnt good my friends ordered some crab legs which had no flavor and also the rice was bad....

They start you off with chips and salsa but the salsa is just way to spicy and you need to make sure you have a drink on hand. Don't get me wrong, I love spicy but this was overwhelming. The fish/shrimp were cooked well but lacked a little flavor, especially the Shrimp Ceviche. It was really good but in this area it could have used some serranos or jalapenos for kick.

Right when we sat down, these sauces arrived on the table with chips. BEWARE: They are SPICY, and trust me, I learned the hard way when I consumed a huge scoop of it. My mouth was numb for about 10 minutes. It doesn't help when the drink situation is lacking. Waters didn't arrive right away and they weren't very good about refilling them either.  Right off the bat I ordered a pitcher of traditional margaritas because I didn't realize they had all sorts of fun frozen ones. The traditional margarita was gross, but loaded with booze. We then tried some sort of frozen passion fruit which was SO good.  The seafood platters arrived and I couldn't believe how much food we had in front of us. Of course my boss over ordered and ordered two huge platters for 5 people but we chowed down. Everything was really good and seemed fresh. We enjoyed it!  The bathroom situation though presented a problem and we dined on a slower Monday evening. I can only imagine how long the lines are on the weekends.

2012-07-03,1.0,"When we walked in the door and saw the fish hanging everywhere and the vibrant environment, we thought this would be a great place. Unfortunately, appearances can be decieving, and everything else about this place sucked. It took at least 5 minutes before a waitress even brought menus to the table, and another 5 before we got water. We decided to split one of their specialty meals, which included an array of seafood, meat and vegetables, as well as rice and beans. We ran out of water pretty quickly because the dips they put on the table were so spicy (and we love spicy), and the waitress didn't come by to refill. I saw her standing in the kitchen eating, so we asked the bartender to give us more water. When our food finally came, it looked like a delicious feast. However, taste was a different story. The meal only came with 3 scrawny crab legs, all overcooked and soggy. There were also 3 prawns, but they were so overdone that we only ate 2. the octopus was underwhelming, as was the breaded fish. The flank steak was dry and tough and the shrimp were in little bits, but all still had shells on them. The refried beans were crusty and overdone, and we didn't even touch the rice. It looked like it came out of a box. The only mildly decent items were the mussels, which were surprisingly not overcooked, some kind of whitefish, and the broccoli. By the end of the meal, we both had stomach aches and felt disgusting. This was made worse by the bathroom situation. The bathrooms are located right next to the kitchen and services area where the kitchen door constantly swings open and you have to stare at piles of dirty dishes. There is only one women's and one men's bathroom, so men and women have to line up amongst the tables and press against the wall to avoid being trampled by the wait staff. The rug by the doors was soggy and dirty, and the person in the ladies' room before me couldn't even get the door open. My fiance said someone had thrown up in the men's bathroom sink and hadn't rinsed it very well. Gross. This was the first time in many years that I consciously did not tip 20% because the service was so bad. I think all the good reviews must come from people who had the margaritas and were drunk when they ate this food.

2012-06-22,4.0,"I absolutely love El Barco. Trust me, it's for more reasons than the strong margaritas that will have you on your ASS if you over-indulge. Not only is El Barco great for libations, it's equally awesome for great food.  The Spot I'd like to begin with the big fish outside of the restaurant so you're sure not to pass it up. Come on, the fish is BLUE! It might be a sword fish, hell, I don't know. Anywho, you walk into the spot, and of course, there's this tank right in your face with alllll kinds of sea creatures. I don't entertain that tank...ever. Next, if you look around, you'll see TEQUILA...all.kinds.of.TEQUILA. Blue tequila, red tequila, here a tequila, there a tequila, tequila alll around. It really adds to the festive atmosphere.  The Service  After you're seated, they uncover these tortilla's and bring you several sauces. Eat this sauce at your own risk. Your butt hole will be burning for a few weeks if you over-indulge! SPICE-EYYYY!! However, if you're planning on grabbing some margaritas, which you'd better if you want to be happy and ride ponies and fly like beautiful butterflies. These margaritas will make that happen for ya, eat lots of the tortillas so you can soak up the tequila! Wait, the service is good. The waitresses are a little off on the English, but hell, most of us Americans can't speak English too well. But, they are super nice.  The Food My first time going, I tried the Garlic Red Snapper. AMAZING. It's huge, it's succulent, it's flavorful (with garlic...DUH) and it's filling. It comes with beans, rice and lots of vegetables and of course, your choice of tortillas (corn or flour)...This IS a Mexican spot, after all. The tacos and fajitas are also all yummy. I really like the steak and chicken tacos. All their food is soooo flavorful. The prices are SO reasonable. I think it's less than like $20 bucks for the whole red snapper.  Take away this...

I remembered their margaritas from a long time ago and, since we had 1 hour until a massage, we thought we could cram in a meal before hand.  We started out with the chips and salsa. And by salsa I mean the most delicious chipotle sauce. It was so tasty that we ate two bowls of chips with it before our meal even came. That with the two margaritas in my system, we were nearly full. But we ordered anyway: My partner ended up with the very simple, but sublime camarones (shrimp) and I ordered the overwhelming mixto. As always, the fish was INCREDIBLE and I know it's not the tequila talking. It's always good. Always. We inhaled our food, had some more chips and chipotle, and got on our way.

Instead, I will just give a warning for those of you that consider hygiene a serious issue.  This is what happened. We order some Negra Modelos. When we started drinking them, we tasted an odd taste and smell--not typical from this nice Mexican beer. After a more careful examination of the bottle we realized the bottles were covered with VOMIT. So literally, we ate a random person vomit. My friend went to the bathroom and vomited herself. I could not eat no more.  When we asked the waitress to change the beers due to this peculiar episode, she did it. And she did it so naturally as we were ordering some guacamole. Apparently, changing vomited beers is as common as ordering guacamole at El Barco. Without apologizing she then charged the whole beer later on our check--plus an extra for the request of changing the beers. Beautiful.  Finally, let me add that the men restroom was also vomited. May be is all part of the same loop: give vomited drinks to customers, customers vomiting and then eating the vomit again, and so forth.

Typically I push them and the mexican rice aside on my plate or I'll ask for none at all but these look different, not like grey trying to be brown death on a plate. And it looked rich and fatty. I can't resist fat. So tasty. The focus here is mostly seafood so I always have to order something from the sea here and good thing they have lots of that paired with the carne asada. Heaven on a plate I tell ya. The best of both worlds.  The plates- they're huge retangular plates to hold all that comes with your entree. Mexican rice, refried beans, a mix of lightly perfectly seasoned veggies like corn on the cob, green beans, brocolli, cauliflower and a generous dallop of guacamole at the end of the plate. It's enough for 2 people to split. I like how it's all served without any tortillas as I'm not a fan and wouldn't have touched them :) the carne asada, delicious and simple. The shrimp fajitas is really good with lots of well cooked onions and peppers, tomatoes and big, plump perfectly cooked shrimp.  Their margaritas are huge and perfect for some day drinking. I would have accepted one from a drunk hanging near our table (we were seated right by the bar) and told him to shoo once I received my drink but that's messed up. Their shrimp empanadas are also pretty good- very shrimpy and very rich that I could only finish one in one sitting. I loooove how they also have a nice little row of hot sauces to put on your food, as I like mine really spicy and my favorite habenero sauce was present. I see they also serve red snapper the way vietnamese presents our version- fried whole but sometimes we put a sauce on top of the whole fried snapper. That made me miss home.  It can be packed on weekends and there will be a little bit of a wait. I was cool with a few minutes but nothing over 20, hell no. It's cramped, expect people to constany bump into your table during your meal. Drunk patrons trying to buy you drinks if you're a female. The one thing I didn't like was that since it was tight quarters in there, the waitress often hovered over us and I felt like we were being watched as we ate. That was a little unpleasant. I'm willing to overlook that a little because of the food. Entrees are about 12 dollars and up and you get soo much. My takeout box felt pretty heavy afterwards. It was my first meal of the day see.. I couldn't do a shock and awe on my stomach. I have to come back and see if the oysters are any good.  Word to the wise: let your waitress pack up your food for you. Doing it yourself is a pain cuz the tables are small, the plates are huge retangles so it's heavy and awkward to try and efficiently pack your food to go. I highly recommend, the line starts here.",0.998,0.725,0.197,0.078,0.5658351648351648

2012-02-25,3.0,""" me le quita me le pone, ni madre!! nos chingan la medida"". (quote from their menu) After a failed attempt to eat here (1 + hr wait, not me thanks) I came here a few days ago. Not before calling and asking about the wait time. Table was available. So we get there and get seated shortly granted it was a Tuesday right before 11 pm. We were not crazy hungry but still decided to go for the seafood platter. It was only 2 of us and thought maybe we could manage to finish it. Service is nice and the drinks are decent. The tostadas they have there are about the worst tostadas I have ever had. They do have a little basket with key limes in each table and that is pretty cool. The salsas: the red salsa is great. It is perfect for seafood. (this sea food???? we will see when the food arrives). It is always packed. from the very young to the very old, couples to families. We were there past 11 pm and for some reason there were a lot of people with babies in the restaurant. I guess a lot of people don't get that babies do not do well after their bed time  LOL. And yes, by that I mean there was a lot of crying and moving around. Don't get me wrong I love babies and for that reason I wouldn't have my babies out so late. So come on people!!! Little chit chat a couple of laughs and the waitress is there with the food. And now that we are talking about the waitresses. They all were really pretty. I think that is a requirement to work there. lol Joke aside they were really pretty, all of them. So the food is there, huge platter with different types of sea food. Calamari, shrimp, prawns, crab legs, clams and everything was OK. Honestly I don't know what is the big hype about this place. I could go to some better seafood places in the southside of Chi town. The portion was huge no way we could've  finished that much food. I had to take a little less than half home. It is a little pricey",0.9968,0.767,0.193,0.04,0.5919352159468437

We have been to El Barco a couple of times and I have not been impressed with the food.  We weren't interested in spending a ton on dinner so Dani ordered the chicken enchiladas and I ordered the tacos al pastor instead of some of the fancier seafood entrees. The enchiladas were good, pretty much your run of the mill enchiladas, but they were tasty despite some of the side vegetables that came with being so overcooked we weren't interested in trying them... The reason this review is very poor is for the tacos.  Now, I'm no taco connoisseur or anything like that, but I think (or thought?) I knew what a taco al pastor is.  Really delicious marinated pork with a lttle bit of pineapple, cilantro, onions....  delicious, and one of my favorites...  So you can imagine my surprise when I unwrap the tacos and realize I'm looking at fish tacos with nothing else in them other than some cilantro. I called the waitress and told her I had ordered the al pastor tacos, not fish.  She proceeded to tell me that at El Barco, the al pastor tacos are fish tacos.  I asked her in disbelief a second time just to be sure I heard her correctly... I went ahead and ate one of the tacos and Dani had one too, and we both agreed that they were about the worst taco we've ever tasted.  There was something the fish was dipped in but the sauce was completely tasteless.   I have no problem with restaurants departing from the normal standards of a dish, but come on... if you are going to offer a dish that is known to be one thing and serve something completely different you'd better highlight it on the menu.  It's like a burger joint serving you a turkey burger if you just ordered a regular cheeseburger... On top of it all, the food is overpriced for the experience.  We won't be back.  Particularly when the place directly across the street has some of the most fantastic Mexican dishes I've had this side of the border.",0.9693,0.813,0.118,0.069,0.5650289987789988

I hadn't been there in a while, years actually so I was excited to go back.

Some may call it risque latno dancers, I call it trashy. I get it if it's a sports bar - but it's not, it's a restaurant. And from the looks of it, more of a family restaurant. I'm not a prude, but when it comes to having such trashy programming on with very young children present (approx age 3 and up), that just seems so wrong.

Waiting for a table at 10 pm on a Tuesday night. This place is not about sterling service. It's crowded and loud and the waitresses will ignore you if you give a hint of attitude. It's high energy and really great authentic food. It's just a fun place to eat.

Hell yeah. It's a whole lot of food and it's really, really, good -- grilled squid, prawns, fish, octopus, fried fish, calamari, chicken and steak piled high on top of grilled veggies and mexican rice and beans.  You order the dish by how many people are going to be in on the nautical feast, and per the waitress ""order for two if you are going to be three."" She was right -- We ordered for two and we had enough sea creatures left over to feed even the drunkest of pirate. The decor in this place is awesome -- think giant models of sharks hanging from the rafters. The food is pretty inexpensive as well for how good (and plentiful) it is.

We ate outside both times and the service was friendly & prompt. The decore is awesome as well, haha (fishy and fun in a copper boat-shaped restaurant!) Full disclosure: we always leave inadvertently trashed. They have AMAZING margaritas that are made from real fruit ($11 for a pitcher). First time we had lime on the rocks... and the second time they mixed up some strawberry and mango margaritas for us since we couldn't decide... Fajitas are gorgeous! Tacos are delectable.

2011-06-27,1.0,"I am very disappointed with this place, what a letdown. I have been going there for years and have taken many people there who are now frequent customers, but I had a horrible experience that I would NEVER return. On 6/16/11 I was there and enjoyed a taste dinner with my husband. As we usually do almost every other week. There is nothing special about the service and they don't even recognize their frequent customers because they have so many of them, but I have overlooked that b/c I have enjoyed their food. But, on this one visit I paid with my debit/credit card and when I checked my account online the following day a noticed I was double charged. One charge was for the meal without the tip and the second for the meal with the tip. All in all it added up to over 100 bucks, I don't know about all of you but every penny counts for me so I wanted to make sure I took care of the error ASAP. I called them as soon as I noticed the charges and Daniel, the Host, told me to wait a few days b/c sometimes the bank will do that. I'm not sure if the banks do or don't do that, I just know this was the very first time I have ever seen that since I've had my account over 10 years. So, fine I did not want to give anyone a hard time and gave it a few days. With no changes on my account, it clearly looked like there was two separate charges. I called on Monday they were too busy to help me over the phone and Lila, who I was not aware was the business owner, took my information and said to call her the next morning. On Tuesday I called her at 9am and she explained that she was too busy and could not look into it and would have to return my call. I wanted to make sure she did b/c it almost seemed that at this point it was going to be a while b/f anyone helped me, so I asked her at what time to expect her call b/c I'm very busy with work and wanted to get this resolved ASAP. She could not give me a specific time, so I asked her if I could speak with the business owner and that's when she told me it was her. I was pleased to hear that thinking I was going to get some help with my situation, but as it turns out it was the complete opposite. She began to get nasty over the phone and would not listen to anything I had to say or would shut it down. One of the worst experiences I have ever had with a business. I eventually ended up getting my money back (the second charge without the tip) from Daniel one week later.  I had to go in person with a statement printout. The experience I had with Lila was just unbelievable that I refuse to go back and spend my hard earned money and give it to that arrogant, selfish, greedy person, who obviously does not appreciate her customers.",-0.7936,0.816,0.083,0.101,0.44399963086009603

Now I can forgive one mistake -- mistakes happen.  But oftentimes when something like this occurs, the server apologizes and perhaps offers a dessert or the like.  We got a hasty apology and our server continued being hard to catch the rest of the night.  I bet it took us 10-15 minutes to pay our bill after we were finished.

I have seen countless customers leave this fine establishment to be greeted with a parking ticket on their windshield seemingly because they didn't notice or chose to ignore the signs posted along the street. I would recommend the owner(s) of El Barco post a BIG sign on their front door reminding customers of these parking regulations.

When we got there the place was packed and I thought was a good sign so I was excited to eat here.  We had to wait for a table but that was ok, what wasn't Ok was watching the man at the door seat people before us that we knew came after us (they were 2 so were we) because we watched while he wrote their names down after ours. We were finally seated and because it was busy the server took awhile to come to the table and when she finally came she asked us what we wanted to drink but we were never given a menu so we had no idea what they had especially since it was our first time here so we had to ask for menus. We looked it over and decided on a pitcher of margarita on the rocks.  We drink margaritas often but this one was horrible, it tasted watered down and as though there was no tequila in it at all. I guess that is why they only charge $10 for the pitcher, lime juice and ice only. Our server never bought us the tostadas and salsa they brought to other tables until we asked and even when she brought the basket she didn't give us plates or silverware, we had to ask for those things when our food came. We ordered our food and it took a long time but I figured it would because it was busy.  I ordered Carne asada with crab legs and when we finally got it, it was cold.  I ordered my steak well done and it was medium rare. I picked at the food a little and just ended up packing it up. The experience was bad for me and I will not go back.  I also thought the place was kind of dirty.

2011-03-31,4.0,"When our girl Maria first told us about El Barco we were intrigued. Flash forward to a few years later and we finally made it. Actually, we made it there twice in the past two weeks. Our first experience was on a busy Saturday night; there was a bit of a wait and when looking into the restaurant it appeared crowded and crammed. But when we actually got seated, it felt as though there was plenty of room. However, the menus are so giant it made it a bit difficult to sort through all the offers between its pages. The first thing we ordered was a pitcher of margaritas; these margaritas are the tops and the most notable thing about them is they are $10 a pitcher and freshly made to order -- they aren't a sugary margarita mix. Score. For an appetizer we got pulpo a la plancha, one of our most favorite octopus dishes and one which we order wherever it's offered. Real meaty, this pulpo, and tasted great -- nothing over the top with spice or flavor but just a really solid dish. We got this both times we went; the first time it was better, more blackened and grilled. The second time it was still good, but could have been charred more. So, food. First time 'round we had the ceviche and a salmon steak dinner. The ceviche was fresh and nice, nothing out of this world in flavor, but satisfying and a good portion. The salmon meal was good; it's essentially a salmon steak and rice with a bunch of vegetables on the side. Good, and a lot of food, but nothing mind blowing... for $16. Second time, we got chiles rellenos with shrimps and cheese enchiladas; both solid dishes and satisfying. We thought the enchiladas were fine, better than many places and the rellenos were good but surprisingly not breaded. The service was fine, friendly in general, though our second trip to El Barco pitted us against a waitress who didn't seem to care to be our waitress. She barely spoke to us or attended to our needs; instead, she let her coworkers take care of us when we flagged them down. Strangely enough, the first time we went it was real busy and we had great service from three or four waitresses; on a slower weekday night, we still had good service from all but the waitress who seemed to be in charge of us. Maybe she doesn't like the looks of the Rose. Most notable about El Barco is the decor. It's comical, really. Big ol' fish hang from the ceiling, the whole place is nautical themed, and there are bottles of alcohol lining the walls. The place looks like a ship. There's even a pirate up front who stared at us creepily the entire meal. It's is a spectacle, a wonderful spectacle. Overall, worthwhile place to catch a meal and a decent price, especially the margaritas (they gotta be the cheapest, tastiest in the neighborhood). For two pitchers of margaritas, an appetizer, and two entrees, you're looking at about $70. Nice environment with a friendly staff and a look that makes you wanna set sail. We'll definitely be back for another taste, baby.",0.9976,0.812,0.158,0.03,0.48931327160493837

2011-01-31,1.0,"My boyfriend and I have been looking all over the city to find a great and reasonably priced seafood place. Since we often pass El Barco and our friends have raved about the place we figured it was time to stop in for a taste.  Upon arriving on a Sunday afternoon we were seated at a back table that is rectangular shaped. The table is divided by a shelve and some hot  sauces along it. My boyfriend is very small and even he said he was cramped in the little space we had. Not to mention we had another couple just next to us hearing our every word. I guess though, this is common for the city and busy restuarants.  Next the waitress came to our table to take our drink order, I ordered a bloody mary since it was Sunday... but they dont make those even though they have a FULL BAR. My boyfriend stayed true to the Mexican theme and ordered a Michilada. Usually a waitress will ask what kind of beer you want it made with... instead our waitress did not and just brought a watered down Michilada to the table made with American, Bud Lite.... I mean, are you kidding me!?? Why would you make a Mexican drink with American beer?  Anyway, my boyfriend could not even drink it so he asked her to have it remade with Modelo instead. That drink NEVER CAME.... I do have to say that the food portion of the meal was alright. The Ceviche was good but could use some sort of kick to make it a bit tastier, I had the Camerones El Mojo De Ajo. I have to say that either the waitress didnt hear us correctly or perhaps this is just how they make it but there was NO GARLIC in the whole plate. There were some odd stew like veggies included on the plate but nothing like the menu promised; like the garlic and wine sauce...  then again, the waitress didnt speak much English and my boyfriend had to translate everything so perhaps it was lost in translation. We finished unsatisfied and we wanted to get outa there in a hurry. We spent $50 for the two of us to eat. It took FOREVER for the waitress to bring the check, and she didn't until we asked her. She however, was very quick to come back to get it repeatedly. She actually ended up charging us for the Michilada that never came so we had to have her correct that. She didn't even appologize, she just said that another waitress was suppose to bring it and was shocked that she didn't.  We gave her cash and waited for the change... and waited, and waited. Finally I was getting agitated and got up to ask the manager at the front for our change and let him know we had been waiting for quite some time. I was so disappointed in the service. Like the reviews said, the place is cute, the food is good but the service is the WORST I have seen in quite some time... and I have to say that I am not a picky person as we aren't fancy people expecting too much.... It's to bad too because if the waitress would have been more attentive, appologetic or some how come back from the Michelada incodent I think everything else could have been avoided.

They have gone a little 'overboard' (haha) with all the giant fish hanging in the restaurant - though interestingly enough they are fake. Their menu has an awesome selection and everything sounds awesome. They bring tortilla shells, two sauces, and lemons to the table when you sit down. The sauces are both really good, but you find you are a little confused, as they are not 'salsa' and you feel strange about breaking up the tortilla shells to use as chips - never really got an explanation. As an appetizer, we got calamari in a white wine sauce - different grilled calamari than I'm used to - very thick pieces - but still quite delicious. I got the shrimp that they describe as ""very very good, just order it"".... and it was very very good but probably 3 lbs of shrimp worth - for 2 or more people. Though, a be prepared that it's pretty salty. All in all, great place for a Mexican seafood dinner and not overtly pricey for fresh seafood.",0.9875,0.768,0.187,0.044,0.5567621527777777

The menu was overwhelming and we wanted to try a lot of things, so we went with the Paradillada (sp?). It included flank steak, chicken, mussels, shrimp, octopus, and fish. Even though there were three of us, we got the platter for two, and it ended up being more than enough food. All very good! We also got an order of the fish tacos, which were good too. The best part was probably the margaritas... $10 pitchers! They were so good. The other thing I really liked about this place was that we got a second pitcher at the end of our dinner, and we did not feel rushed at all to leave even though the restaurant was very busy.

We had the ceviche trio (great texture!), el diablo calamari (great heat!), and the garlic deep fried snapper (great value!). They were out of the smelt when we were there, but that's somewhat acceptable in my mind when a place prides itself on the freshness of their seafood.

For some inexplicable reason this place is packed,  luckily we arrived and got the last available table before the slam,  this gave us plenty of time to stare at each other wondering which of these well tight t-shirted latinas would be waiting on us.  They should line them up and let you pick. We started with some drinks,  the guava margarita was good,  the Modelo was Modelo $3.47  no complaints so far.   We attempted to order the grande snapper for two,  but they were out.  our apps arrived while the over-sized dirty menus were still in front of us. 6 on the half shell oysters covered in ice.  I take issue with this because the brine around an oyster is magical,  it should not be diluted with Chicago's chromium and chlorine rich lake water.  On second thought,  thanks for diluting the rank off flavor the oysters had. Not rotten,  just ick.  Not even the bland table salsas could resurrect the flavor. The other app was coctel de cameron.  I love shrimp cocktail Mexican style,  there are plenty of places that do it ok,  but the ones that do it well are dear to my heart.  This was the worst version I have ever had.  The shrimp still had some ice crystals inside,  most likely they are bringing in pre-cooked frozen shrimp.  The coctel sauce was watery,  bland and only help to dilute the already watery flavor of the shrimp. Entree's,  I got the fish soup,  the broth was rich,  over reduced and murky,  with scant amounts of anything other than some talapia.  Really lame.  The other entree was whole snapper al mojo de ajo (garlic sauce)  when this preparation is right it is amazing,  this one was not amazing.  After it arrived we could see no garlic,  I asked the waitress if this was indeed al mojo de ajo,  and she smiled without looking and said yes.  Bullshit then,  there was no flavor other than some pan roasted onions on this fish.  Fish was served with potatoes,  broccoli and cauliflower,  the potato was cold enough to hold in your hand,  none of the veggies were seasoned and were just there to fill the plate.   As for the fishes preparation,  as usual it was dry (whole fried fish more times than not are this wauy)  but it was a bit fishy,  and we left a third of the fish there. Next time I want some amazing mariscos,  I will get in my car and drive to the south side to one of many places (I can think of four on Pulaski alone) for Mexican seafood,  I will be treated better,  fed better,  and not have to worry about 100 people looking over my shoulder to see if I am done yet.",0.9953,0.763,0.165,0.073,0.5252338435374149

I even went in once and looked at the menu but decided it was expensive (I must have been feeling really broke that year). We finally took the plunge. Will we be back? Aye-aye. We walked in fairly early on a Saturday night and got both parking in the lot (which isn't very big) and a seat by the window right away, so things got off to pretty much a perfect start. Our waitresses started trying to take our order within about 30 seconds of our being seated, and our food came quickly. If anything, I felt dinner flew by too fast. It was our anniversary, and it would have been nice to linger a bit. We were in and out in less than an hour--and that spanned a pitcher of drinks, appetizers, huge entrees and the wrapping up of leftovers/settling of bill. Lively, congenial, fish-studded room, with way too many televisions, but I didn't mind because they weren't tuned to sports. Just Spanish-language videos, commercials and the like. And they're mounted high, so it's easy to mostly ignore them, or look at a hanging plastic shark instead. Our order: On-the-rocks margarita pitcher--tasty, cheap (about $9), not strong. On this occasion, we appreciated all of those qualities. Served in attractive barware, which counts as well. I kept seeing huge tankards of micheladas going by to other tables, and they looked good as well. Raw oysters--not amazing (might be better if served colder), and about a third were almost too tiny to bother with, but okay for the price (I think about $8/dozen). Next time I'm getting ceviche or a seafood cocktail of some sort. Shrimp quesadilla--succulent, with a generous amount of nice-quality shrimp. Served with a tasty remoulade-like sauce.  I'd order it again. Whole fried snapper mojo de ajo--About $19 and huge, perfectly cooked, not oily in my estimation, though I'd like to notice the garlic more. Love that it comes with an abundance of lightly cooked vegetables, a pile of grilled red onions and a nice bit of fresh guacamole. Plus the rice was tasty--a little salty, but in a good way. This easily could have been shared by both of us. Shrimp chiles rellenos. I just had a little taste, but good. The poblano peppers had nice color, not overcooked or overwhelmed by batter and cheese. Again, generously portioned and plated with rice, beans, vegetables and a good dollop of guacamole. On the table: a couple of unexpected salsas, lots of hot sauces, a basket limes (you cut with provided knife) and whole fried tortillas, which are waiting on the table under what looks like a hair net or shower cap until you sit down.

They also bring out freshly fried tortillias along with some spicy tomatillio salsa and mole sauce for dipping. (Another review mentions spicy guacamole I can assure you that it is not guacamole!)  The menu is huge and extensive but I highly recommend sticking to the seafood.  I really love the whole fried snapper. The one with the garlic. Yum.Also they give you a small side of assorted veggies, really tasty yellow rice, and a glob of guacamole.All goes very nicely with the fish. I tasted Aaron's shrimp ala diabla and that was also very tasty and nice and hot just like it should be.",0.9882,0.8,0.193,0.007,0.5138672438672439

Eeek! The waitress took a while to get to us, and when she did, she seemed annoyed that we weren't ready.  Wait let me rephrase that; she seemed annoyed AT ME.  My companion even asked me if I knew her from somewhere else, since that would be the only way to explain her cold behavior. This was consistent throughout our meal, and it got to the point of being so uncomfortable, it was funny.  I'm sure the kickin' margaritas added to the humor of the situation. We ordered our meals; I was excited to get my ceviche tostadas.  So I was pretty confused when she brought me a martini glass full of ceviche.  Apparently, what I received was the ceviche appetizer.  Maybe I should have been more specific, but in all of my dining experiences , when I order a  dish that appears in both the appetizer and the dinner sections, the waiter will ask me to specify which one I wanted.  Ugh, whatever rude waitress.

This place has mastered enormous portions at value menu prices. But in all seriousness, this place falls short in a couple areas which leaves a restaurant with great potential with just lackluster reviews. The waitresses often don't seem to speak English, which would be okay except every time I have been there they have completely missed a part of my order. The seafood is good quality and fresh, but it is always slightly greasy. I ordered grilled shrimp and it clearly came out cooked sauteed in oil.

Between the lights, the 10 TVs playing music videos and the bright display case of tequila, your retinas will get burned while you eat here. No matter.

The portions are huge. Tons of shrimp, octopus, squid, chicken and even crab. It's quite a feast. On each table there are no less than 8 or so different kinds of hot sauce. And then they bring you more sauces once you sit down. The orange one is super hot so use it sparingly unless you're well trained.  Their drinks are extremely reasonable. We got one pitcher of a mango frozen margarita and another one of jack fruit. They were both really good. Out of all of the hits of the evening, the service was sometimes a miss.

Service - A little sloppy.  Server just kept walking by after awhile as we sat on the patio, but once we reminded her and a busser that we hadn't ordered, they got it together.  Tables are a little close together out there. Food - Delicious!  Mostly seafood offerings.  Fantastic, traditional ceviche that could be a meal in itself.  Shrimp in a guajillo sauce was mild in heat (plenty of hot sauce options on the table, 4 total, plus the two sauces they give you with the fried tortillas), but very flavorful.  Everything seemed to come with a side of rice, veggies, and a guacamole covered potato.  Pretty standard, well made guac.    Margaritas, on the rocks, were sub par, but there's a lot of frozen fruit flavors for those who need their margarita frozen (you people are shameful).  Next time I'd just see if they have a tequila list because of all those wall bottles, and sip something good.

This adventure (not really) started when I was speaking to a neighbor, who was obviously a food lover, who also happened to be of Hispanic decent. So who better to get suggestions from, on where to get some good ol' Mexican style seafood? Si? Ole!  And.....when we went inside El Barco most of the people where Spanish speaking....hello?! Jackpot baby! We waited several minutes for a table outside (such a cute seating area) to be wiped clean. We had not yet realized what a mess a giant fried red snapper, a platter of langastinos and rice with seafood makes....but stay with me. We started off with a reasonably and dare I say cheap, yet tasty pitcher of margaritas. We were hungry and dove into the basket of tortilla chips and 2 different, spicy sauces.  They were not salsa, but whatever they were, they were good, especially the darker, sweeter one. We tended to stay away from the bright red...usually that means danger. They were out of the smaller snapper, so we had to get the 3lb one.  We got that deep fried and served with garlic and onions. We wanted to get it broiled, but it would take 1hr and 15min and we just weren't willing to wait that long. The fish was huge and tasted nice and flaky. There was plenty of ""fish meat"", and we had no problem avoiding the bones. It came with veggies, guac, Spanish rice and corn...as did all the meals. Half the fish came home with us, but was a little dry the next day My langastinos were made in that same brown sauce that came on the table and was tasty...but messy to eat.  Although, it seemed like all of us were making a mess, since the portion sizes are big and can barely fit on the platters. My fiance and I liked the langastinos, but our friend was a little standoffish.  It was too much work for him and a little too messy. Or maybe he just felt sorry for the little guys since you could still see their little black eyes starring back...some still had them. Half of this came home with us as well, and I swear it was better the next day! Our friend had mixed seafood (crab legs, shrimp and squid) with Spanish rice.  It was garlicy and yummy. Our waitress Cary was very friendly and nice, and did a good job dealing with our silliness and Spanglish. Everything we had was good and again very reasonably priced.  We will definitely be back to try some of the other menu items.

Loved the steamed veggies that were served with the dish. My friends ordered chicken tacos and adobo salmon fillet and they loved their dinners as well.  Overall, everything was delicious including the giant round corn tortilla chips with their unique salsa.

I wouldn't suggest ordering the quesedillas though, you get about 3 pieces and they are tiny! The margaritas are HUGE, I didn't try one, but they looked good. I had the paloma's and they were great!

2010-04-03,2.0,"I went there for dinner on a Friday night with 5 other people. We arrived around 7 and only had to wait 10 mins or so for a table. We had been wandering around looking for food and were excited that we found such a great looking place. There were so many people there it had to be awesome right??????? NO - it wasn't.  We received menus, chips, and salsa/dips as soon as we sat down. However, it was probably 15 minutes before anyone offered us water. I'll also mention that none of these water glasses were refilled ONCE throughout the entire meal. Um.. usually when customers are eating spicy food, they like to wash it down with some water... just an idea.  We were ready to order drinks and food at this point. We placed our order. About 20 minutes later, we don't have any of our drinks and the waitress brings out half of the entrees..... 7 minutes later... still no drinks. Meanwhile, some of us are staring at our meals waiting for our buddies to get their food. The rest of the food arrives yet there is no booze on our table. After we ask, the waitress tells us that there are no clean margarita pitchers and it will be just a few more minutes. Why couldn't she have mentioned this before and offered to serve us something else? Or at least to let us know what was going on.  By this time we are just a bunch of grumpy people who need a stiff drink, which only makes the overly loud pop music even more annoying. And it turns out the drinks were closer to koolaid than a real margarita.  There are only 2 toilets for the entire restaurant which probably seats about 200 people? Dumb idea if you ask me.  The only part that was good was the food. And honestly, that did not make up for the poor service, cramped tables, and incredibly loud volume of the place. Maybe regulars receive better service.

2010-03-05,3.0,"So in college, while driving around, we saw the sign of a huge colorful fish over the street.  Curious?  Yes.  But onward to the destination... In graduate school, El Barco was reviewed on some show on TV with focus on a whole deep fried red snapper.  Intriguing?  Absolutely...  Three years after grad school, and a total of over 10 years later, I finally decided enough is enough.  I'm coming here to try the food already. My fiancee and I immediately sat down and fumbled with the massively sized menu.  (Note, the menu is massively sized, but it doesn't mean they have a massive amount of items to pick from).  Everything translated into a simple line, no real descriptions, so we went with the fried snapper for two that I've been curious about for years. And as the 3.5 lb snapper made it's way to our table from the kitchen, I couldn't help but think ""Man, that's a whole lotta fish..."" The first few bites were delicious.  Crispy skin, tasty seasonings, soft tender fish.  The veggies accompanying it were good, the guacomole was excellent, and the rice was alright. As we picked apart the snapper over time, we found that little by little, the flavors and textures just weren't as good anymore... the oils crept into the meat and the fish was only alright.   It seems like everyone around us got tortilla's to eat with their meal, so I don't know if our waitress forgot or lost something in translation (which seemed to happen a few times) but it would've been nice to have them to help balance out all the fish. Since we agreed we may not likely come back as regulars, we decided to try to pile in some dessert while we were here... resulting in a flan with a chocolate cake base.  The flan was slightly stiffer than what I was used to, but the taste was superb.  The chocolate cake tasted dry when eaten with the flan, but on it's own, it was actually quite moist and respectable. Verdict:  Three stars, A-OK.  This would be a fun date place, and I'm curious about some of the other food on the menu now that the Red Snapper has been tried.  I would suggest you share the Red Snapper with a few more people (maybe group of four) along with some apps, so that it doesn't have too much time to cool.  Dessert was tasty, but nothing to go out of your way for either. Bonus:  I've never seen so many different bottles of tequila in my life.  Their tequila wall is nuts.   Who knew?",0.9954,0.822,0.148,0.03,0.5510839212228102

The actual make-up of the restaurant is lively and very casual - walking in I noticed that there were a lot of people eating there which was a good sign that the food would be good.   Oh, and they had some interesting looking margaritas although I didn't try one....I chose to stick with Pacifico.   This place is not really much of a 'date night' place as it's boisterous and well lit, but I'd pretty much go here for anything else.  I'm looking forward to going back again to try something else out!",0.9881,0.817,0.169,0.014,0.51440329218107

Honestly, now that I've moved back to St. Louis, I wish I would have gone to El Barco more often! The famed red snapper does indeed deserve it's fame. You can get it cooked several different ways and with a variety of sauces. mmmm. And who doesn't love taking a funny picture with a whole fish standing on a plate of vegetables? (c'mon, you know you've done it). I also loved the fajitas and quesadillas. I adore the fact that their food comes in huge portions, aided by the generous sauteed vegetables that accompany most dishes. Not all of them taste particularly mexican-y (green beans and red potatoes?), but they are fabulous. The place gets packed, parking is what you expect along Ashland Ave., but El Barco is definitely worth the trip!

2010-02-08,4.0,"El Barco. Look for the restaurant that's shaped like a boat with a sign with a big fish on it. There's a small parking lot, but you can find street parking unless it's a busy night. Big Fish. Not the movie. Big Fish. It's what you order here. It's usually red snapper. A whole fish. Head, tail and everything else in between. You can order it several ways. I like mine with the garlicky sauce. The whole fish is deep fried so there is the chance it may become dry. I suggest ordering the smaller size fish. Aside from the main attraction, I reccommend one of the grilled seafood platters. You can order meat if you want, but it's like ordering a hamburger from Bob Chinn's. The first time we came here, we ordered the grilled octopus with shrimp. It was delicious. The octopus was tender and the shrimp was cooked to perfection. For our entree, we ordered the smaller version of the red snapper wih the garlic sauce. The next time we visited El Barco, we had 4 people in our group. We got adventurous and ordered the seafood paradilla. It came on el barco, literally. The platter was huge and came with tons of fish, shrimp calamari, octopus, and crab legs. In addition, it came with lots of vegetables, rice and beans. We polished off the platter with barely enough room for our huge red snapper. El Barco has a full bar so you can order your margarita or cerveza. If there's room for dessert, you can order authentic sweets like tres leches, a cake made with 3 kinds of milk or other Mexican specialties. Everything at El Barco is big. And the huge tables and chairs make the fairly large dining room seem smaller than it really is. It doesn't help that the dinnerware and serving dishes take up most of the room on the table. If the weather permits there is outdoor seating. My biggest complaint is that there is only one bathroom and on my first visit, we were seated far from the bathroom.  Every time I'd get up to go, someone else would beat me. Otherwise, I would consider El Barco one of my favorite seafood restaurants. Another thing that won me over is its fish theme. Even its business cards are shaped like a fish.

El Barco is always full.  This is a good sign of popularity, no?  People eat at every hour too, since many Latinos will eat late lunches or dinners.  There's extra room in the summer when they have outdoor seating.  I think El Barco is actually less crowded now than it used to be, once Mariscos El Veneno opened up across the street. The food is very good.  Their garlic grilled seafood is great, especially the pulpo (octopus).  The langostinos a la diabla are great too; hopefully you don't mind a bit of spiciness.  I enjoy the ceviche a lot; I think there are five seafoods to choose from like shrimp or fish.  I really like their seafood cocktail.  If you've never had a Mexico seafood cocktail, you gotta try it!  Tomato juice with a bunch of seafood in it, served in a margarita glass.  Works wonders for hangovers....  I had the deep fried red snapper for the first time yesterday.  That's a great fish dish!  We had it flavored with garlic.  The parradilla is fine but nothing special.  You could do better by ordering individual dishes. A bunch of Yelp reviews knock on the service a bit.  Yeah they may not be as attentive as some other places.  But I don't think many authentic ethnic restaurants care to be so attentive.  Sometimes you just need to flag someone down, or show em you need some dishes cleared out.  I'm still very full and satisfied once I leave the restaurant. All in all, El Barco is a very enjoyable ethnic restaurant.  You may be able to get better, fresher stuff in Mexico, especially in coastal towns.  But for an inland American city like Chicago, El Barco will stimulate your taste buds nicely.",0.9943,0.793,0.189,0.017,0.5587996031746032

The appetizers definitely had a Mexican twist, not the usual sauces/batters you find at American seafood places.  I find that they complemented the food well and were not overpowering.   For lunch, I had the salmon and shrimp platter which is pretty big.  It comes with delicious veggie sides which include corn on the cob, red potatoes, carrots, etc.  Also served on the side is a generous portion of rice and some guacamole on a banana leaf.   My friend had some shrimp wrapped in bacon with Mexican cheese.  Unfortunately, the cheese was non-existent...not a trace to be found on the shrimp... (the waitress claims it ""melts"" during cooking) but the dish was still quite yummy evidenced by the fact my friend ordered yet another dish!    The service itself was pretty standard.  The waitresses do need a bit of nudging to remember to bring you water/drinks, etc.  However, everyone was pleasant, and nobody was rude.  Overall, I would recommend this place and would come back here again.  I would love to give it one more star, but the seafood did not blow me away.  Alas, I have been spoiled being from the Gulf Coast of Mexico and used to tasting seafood right out of the water :( so please don't let the 3 star deter you from trying this place.  It is pretty yummy!",0.9978,0.754,0.207,0.039,0.5322492401215805

I was surprised because the place was packed.  Oh and on the way in, we saw my hubby's cousin dining al fresco.  It was her first time as well.  Anyway, I kind of knew what I wanted because I have this problem where I look at the menu on their website many times to get a feel for the food.  Naturally, when I arrive and start looking at the menu, I still have to be the last person to order.   They have an extensive menu.  Whatever you want, they probably have it.  The one dish I order over and over again is the whole fried red snapper with garlic.  This dish is delish! They fry the fish and set it on a stand so when it arrives to your table, it's sitting there nice and pretty for you to devour.  And when I say whole, I mean the eyes, the teeth everything is still on the fish.  The insides are removed though.  In addition to the fish you get rice and veggies.  This plate is almost as long as my body and I have a long torso.  My husband loves the Diavolo Shrimp.  Pretty sure he get it every time.  Portions are so big that we are always bringing food home.  And it's no easy feat to jam a whole snapper in a styrofoam to-go container. One thing that is cool about this place is the wall of tequila.  It's amazing and impressive that the shelves are able to hold them all.  I would hate to be the table against that wall if anything were to happen.",0.9611,0.84,0.112,0.048,0.5595734126984128

What an amazing unassuming place. We were immediately seated and handed the largest menu I have ever seen! We walked in and saw huge margarita glasses and giant super fresh red snapper. My mouth began to water.  I quickly reviewed the menu and ordered the small Ceviche to start with. While we were waiting our server brought over fresh corn tortillas and three different salsas, all of which were fantastic. They also brought over the spiciest guacamole I have ever had, did I mention how much I love spicy foods? It was great! When they brought over the Ceviche it was in a huge margarita glass; I thought to myself, wow this is a huge serving of Ceviche for $3. Turns out they brought us the wrong size but I am glad they did, it was fantastic!! For my entrée I ordered the deep fried snapper with garlic sauce and my boyfriend ordered baked red snapper with tomato sauce. My deep fried snapper was huge!! I mean HU-MON-GOUS!! And the price was incredible, about $15 for the whole dish which is included veggies and rice. You can't buy a snapper of that size at the store for $15 and it was cooked and seasoned to perfection.

The bf and I went here in June and sat outside...nothing fantastic about the view (you get to see people eat at el veneno across ashland) it's just that it was back-sweat hot inside.  It took about ten minutes before we got a waitress...a bitchy one.  She seemed annoyed we were there and generally above it all.  We ordered margaritas, guac and fajitas.  The guac and margs were ok, I've had/made better.  The fajitas were pretty incredible, you get a big spread (a bit overwhelming and landing on the overkill side of overkill, think carrots-i.e. why?,) good quality and cannot be beat for the price.  But uh, where were the tortillas?  I must have been mistaken and not have gotten fajitas right?  We had to ask for them and got an obscene amount of shitty attitude when doing so. We got the check and were in the process of polishing off the margs when the waitress stopped by 3(!) times to ask if we were ready to pay.  We handed over a card, signed and tipped.  She then opened the binder to see how much we had tipped and rolled her eyes so hard I thought her bitch head was going to snap off and roll down her bitch back.   Second time we went was with a friend.  We ordered fried calamari but got grilled calamari, they're mistake? WRONG.  Asshole waitress told us what we ordered, clearly three people remembering an order are trumped by a curmudgeony waitress.  We ordered fajitas, same deal with the tortillas...are all the waitresses there giant bitches?  Our friend ordered tilapia thinking it would be a fillet not the entire fish.  She couldn't the fish and wanted a replacement.  The waitress refused and we asked for the manager and my bf got all gay-bitchy and finally they complied.   So to summarize: they've got good food but expect to get treated like a dirty tampon.  I'm actually surprised they don't order for you then tell you that you made the mistake in ordering and force you to heat up your own tortillas.",-0.9078,0.805,0.081,0.114,0.5883201058201057

2009-07-24,3.0,"Okay, after many attempts and reading many mixed reviews, I finally made it over to El Barco.  Some goods, some not so goods.   First off, we ordered WAY too much food.  We were so stuffed after starters that it was hard to eat little more than a taste of our entrees.   Lets break it down shall we. Oysters- small, briney, no sauce or lemons but plenty of key limes and hot sauces on the table, not great, not horrible, eh. Shrimp empanadas- So good on first taste!  Crispy, well seasoned, good.  But upon closer inspection we came to the conclusion that the crisp dough tasted exactly like puff pastry, the filled tasted like cheese mixed with cream of broccoli soup with diced shrimp.  It on the whole, reminded us of some recipe they might have printed on the back of a Cambell's soup can.  It was good, just sort of strange and processed tasting. Shrimp soup- Slightly salty, slightly spicy, scalding hot, MANY HUGE shrimps, no veggies, but none needed.  This was great!  I think a soup like this could kill any cold as good as if not better than, dare I say, my late grandmother's matza ball soup.  Do a mitzvah and order a bowl of this soup. Mixed Seafood Ceviche- Mostly shrimp, a little fish, a very little octopus, couldn't even find the calamari, lots of cilantro, tomato, crisp, clean tasting, very good. Could have used less shrimp and more tentacled sea critters. Mesquite Broiled Snapper in Garlic Sauce- Huge! I didn't get much mesquite flavor in the fish, but it was moist and flaky.  Way under-seasoned for my taste, but the addition of a little salt helped a lot.  Loved the veggies, rice was okay, guacamole was not my favorite, but not bad by any stretch of the imagination. Margaritas- On the rocks, fine. Frozen with tamarind... my honey thought it was outstanding.  I thought it was a little too sweet.  Overall, okay. Service- Fine, no problems on a Friday night.  We were a little confused as to who our server was, but everyone we asked to help us did a fine job.  Maybe it's one of those team scenarios. Decor- Cornball as hell and I loved it!  Like Red Lobster with booze on the walls.  I liked it inside and out. Overall- Fine, great value, best part... that ancho chile garlic mole/pesto/whatever it was!  Amazing!  Might be back, we will see.",0.9956,0.678,0.217,0.105,0.5219482496194824
2009-07-24,4.0,"Proving to the world that there are several ways to prepare fish, El Barco Mariscos allows you to choose how you'd like your red snapper prepared - that's what they are famously known for. While they have an expansive menu, I do like the snapper fried with garlic sauce. Not only does the red snapper dish come with rice, veggies, guacamole, and corn on the cob, no matter what you order, you get a complementary plate of housemade crispy tortillas to dip in two delicious sauces - one is a mole sauce and the other is more like creamy green salsa. The chips may seem ""harder"" than most places but it's sturdy enough to hold the sauces. For appetizers, the ceviche and mussels are also VERY tasty.  When I have friends in town, I like to bring them to El Barco Mariscos for good quality seafood, heaping portions, and overall value (did I mention their portions are huge?).

We got the margarita's after a few minutes of waiting, and they were just ok. Tasted like it was just poured from a generic/pre-made mix.  The oysters came out first, and these were just ok.  Nothing special. I've had way better.  I was starving, so I sucked them down. After a few more minutes of waiting, our entree's come out.  My wife ordered a side of cheese with her tacos, and they forgot to include and had to wait about 5-10 minutes for them to bring it out.   My shrimp tacos were very very boring and lacked much flavor.  I tried my wife's steak tacos as well, and they were the same.  Very bland, again lacking necessary flavor.   By the end of our meal, the margarita's were WAY too sweet and combined with lack-luster food, we headed out very disappointed.  Me with a pain in my stomach.

We went there during the Lunch special but we didn't like any of the lunch specials. The portions are huge and worth the money. The fish & chicken was too dry. The shrimps, skirt steak, & other were cooked properly and tasted good. The floor was wet in the bathroom & eating area. They forgot our water & gaves us flour tortillas instead of corn. It was very distracting to eat while they restocked tables with condiments & etc. I did not like the wooden chair they were unstable and old. The place is not good for large groups.

The ceviche appetizer and grilled octopus with diabla sauce were also delicious. I came here over a year ago, and the food and service was top notch.  The quality of the food and service at El Barco have diminished while prices have shot up since then. The homemade earthy red salsa has been replaced by a green, creamy salsa that packs some heat but is otherwise boring. The black salsa has become oilier and less tasty. The shrimp soup is no longer served in a cast iron pan and is not as rich as before. The lunch menu is smaller and cheaper, however, the grill items are not served on hot plates like at dinner. The steamd fish and scallops dishes are no longer on the menu.  El Barco is still unique and delicious but clearly not the amazing restaurant it once was.",0.8737,0.78,0.137,0.083,0.5637254901960784
2009-06-22,4.0,"I'm giving it 4 stars because when you roll up the atmosphere, price and food, ""Yay! I'm a fan"" applies. Each one of these categories on its own probably wouldn't be a 4, so there you you - an aggregated rating for you. It is definitely a casual, neighborhood type of place, so again take that into account. If you have a special occasion and/or someone slightly snobbish when it comes to food and service, take this into account. To put it another way, this is my Thursday or Friday flip-flop and humid hair type of place; if I want to dress up and play sophisticated snob, I go elsewhere. Anyway, back to the actual review. I thought the atmosphere was fun - the place is decorated well with a large display of tequilas as the backdrop. Very cozy and comfy. The food was super cheap for what we got - pitcher of frozen margaritas, which were fantastic (mmmmmm), a couple of beers, and 2 entrees and an appetizer cost us $60 with a generous tip. Portions were enormous - in fact, our party of 2 was joined by someone late, and we had so much food, that we all had enough and there were leftovers. I would highly recommend their fried snapper specialty - we tried the garlic sauce; AWESOME! and the presentation was fun too. My clothes did smell a little fishy afterwards, because everyone around us got that fish too, so take that into account if you're planning on going someplace where people might care. I just went home, and my dog loved it although I think he hated the fact that I didn't bring him anything. I didn't smell THAT fishy, but it's sort of similar to when you order fajitas and they bring them up all steaming, and afterwards you smell a little like fajitas. You get the point.  Service was decent - ""family"" type service, very relaxed, so again take that into account if you're in a hurry. Anyway, I'm a big snob when it comes too food and service and all that good stuff for restaurants which market themselves as such and where prices are high. This place is a neighborhood place, so if you adjust your expectations accordingly, you will be a very happy camper.",0.9892,0.834,0.141,0.025,0.5663020833333333

2009-06-21,3.0,"Last night, my husband and I got the itch to get out for some al fresco dining and booze.  We're semi-new to West Town, and I've recently discovered that I'm gluten-intolerant, so we weren't quite sure where to go. After walking for way too long, we remembered passing by El Barco a few times, and realized that it met all of our requirements for the evening: booze, outdoor seating, and lots of options for someone on a gluten-free diet.   I think it's unfair to judge a restaurant based on one visit if that first visit is a Saturday night.  The staff was very unorganized, a little ditzy and completely ignored my husband when he told them that there was no tp in the mens room.  After waiting for way too long, he eventually grabbed a bunch of napkins and went in.   Despite these annoyances, there were a few things that made our visit worth the long, aimless walk: - The portions are INSANE.  I have an impressive appetite, but I'm the type of person who usually will eat half of my food, and take the other half home for lunch the next day.  I'm now in my second El Barco-induced food coma in two days, and I still have enough leftovers for dinner.  My husband and I agreed that the next time we go, we're going to split an entree.   - The margaritas may be a bit on the weak side, but the prices are excellent.  Pitchers are about $9.  Many places charge that much for just one margarita!  A pitcher serves about 2.5 giant margaritas.   The actual flavor of the food was decent, but I wouldn't say it was excellent.  However, they load your plate with so many different vegetables (and a potato), that it makes up for it a little bit.   Two entrees, two margaritas, and two pitchers of margaritas (um, yeah; we got a little hammered last night) came to just over $60 plus tip.  However, now that we know that one entree can fill up both of us, and their pitchers are so cheap, we figure that we can easily stuff ourselves and get a good buzz for probably half of that.   One major problem with this restaurant: I absolutely will never go there in the colder months or when it's raining.  The smell inside the restaurant was intolerable to me.  My husband didn't seem to mind it that much, so I'm probably in the minority. Oh, and if you plan on dining here a few times, save your receipt.  You get a free tee shirt with $200 in receipts!",0.9678,0.879,0.079,0.042,0.44160756501182025

Otherwise, on ""better"" days their appetizers and margaritas are great! Think of typical Mexican fare with a strong seafood presence. Cheese quesadillas with shrimp, fish tacos, seafood soup, so forth. I would suggest sticking with the margaritas and beer buckets because their Sangrias tasted like Kool Aid.  The complimentary tortilla chips shaped like saucers is always something to look forward to right when you sit down....add some lime juice and some hot sauce on top of it then eat it like a pizza!

The parking lot across the street is nice if you can get a spot.  If you can't, there's metered parking within walking distance.  The outdoor patio is a nice touch too in warmer months.  Onto the food and drink review. Others have alluded to the variety in liquors.  The micheladas are delicious, and properly spiced.  Don't like ice in your beer beverage?  Don't get it.  But if you understand that ice in your michelada is as traditional as apple pie and baseball games, then you'll be a fan.  They're pretty flexible at the restaurant and will let you pick which beer you want it made of.  You'll notice on the menu that there's something that says ""good tequila"" priced at a modest 4 dollars.  Yes, they do shots of Patron Silver for 4 dollars.  Four.  Not 8. not 7.50, not 7.  But 4.   Who likes prawns?  I do.  The prawns here are huge, and you can get them grilled as is or with a variety of sauces.  They are a definite ""must"" as an appetizer platter to share.  Their whole fish is a hallmark, but I myself like the combination platter that has just a little bit of everything.  The mixed ceviche is a personal favorite of mine. If you pick the right time to go (early evening, or even in the afternoon if you can cut away from work for a few hours), it's a very relaxing atmosphere with no feelings of being rushed or ushered out quickly.  I have seen the place packed at night though, so just beware of that.   Overall, a really fun place that has good pricing on food and drinks.  It gets loud when it's packed, but if you go during non-peak hours, it's a really chill place.",0.9904,0.843,0.143,0.014,0.5234250992063493

2009-05-18,4.0,"I went here Saturday with a couple of friends. The dining room was busy but not packed, and we did not have to wait for a table, so we chose one on the patio. The atmosphere was a little loud on the patio, and the seating was a little tight, but not too bad. There was a table next to ours with some people who were wasted, and had been over-served. They did not stay the whole time we were there, so it did quiet down on the patio after a while. We started off with some mussels in white wine sauce, and a ceviche. Both were amazingly good. There was a huge amount of shrimp, fish, and squid in the ceviche. I think you could easily make a meal out of one or two appetizers at El Barco. They also serve a basket of chips (tortila-size) at the table with some amazing and VERY HOT chili sauce and some other green sauce that was also good. Not your usual chips and salsa. When the main courses came out, I didn't know how they would fit on the table. They were huge. I ordered the camarones a la diabla, it was amazingly tasty, and again, very spicy. It was perfect for my palate, but I think most people would find it about ten times too hot to eat. The menu did warn that it was hot. It was served with some vegetables, guacamole, and Spanish rice that seemed a little on the dry side. The veggies and guacamole were yummy. I can't believe I did it, but I actually finished all the shrimp on my plate. The portion was ginormous. My friends ordered the tilapia tacos, and a whole fried fish that I don't recall (it was not the snapper). I did not taste the tacos, but the fried fish was perfect. I think next time I will get the red snapper, unless I decide to just sample some appetizers. We had two pitchers of margaritas that were quite tasty. They were not the strongest I've ever had (one reviewer complained about the seeming lack of alcohol) but they were not the weakest, either. The mix seemed home made, not out of a bottle. After we left the restaurant, we went home and made margaritas with Mrs. T's (out of pure convenience) and 1800, and they simply did not compare with the margaritas at El Barco. The service was certainly adequate, but not the most attentive or friendliest. Given the price (just under $90 plus tip for 2 apps, 3 entrees, and 2 pitchers of margaritas) I think El Barco is an excellent value, and the service is in line with the price.

Always get a fajita plate to share along with any other main. Triple Money Shot! As many will mention a must have is the Red Snapper. Money Shot in the left eyelid! Margaritas are great and so are sangria pitchers.  All that aside great food but now the reasons to avoid: Service is spotty at best. Sometimes non-existent. One time we had to wait about 30 mins to get a check and the second time I had to ask some one else's waitress to get our check for us.  The tables are so small! It makes no sense to order so much and then have to put cups on top of plates and balance utensils on top of your cups. It is like a dangerous tower you are building over the course of dinner. It also does not allow for easy sharing of dishes. In fact because you have to stack stuff around it is actually like building a little wall around your dish.  Lastly, the last time I went there even with the bad service I decided to tip 20%. Apparently that was not enough for the waitstaff because when my credit card bill came in the mail at the end of the month they conveniently added a couple of zeroes to the tip.

Arriving at El Barco early Saturday evening, the three of us were quickly seated outside, which was extremely lucky as the inside of this restaurant was absolutely sweltering.  A young lady, slim, very attractive, never cracking a smile, or offering a pleasant look and certainly never a kind word, quickly arrived to take our order.  We had literally just been seated and only just then handed menus so we asked for a few minutes but were lucky enough (unlucky as it turned out) to grab her as she was fleeing to order a pitcher of margaritas.  The margaritas were quickly delivered by a male server and tasted like processed limes on steroids, I don't know if I/we were expecting fresh-squeezed lime, nor do I think it absolutely necessary for a decent margarita but, holy jeezus batman, this stuff will turn you inside out AND, I challenge anyone to show me there was ANY tequila in this mess!

If giant American portions are your thing or perhaps you measure the pure heft of the food as a quality indicator then this is your place.  The platter arrived and can only be described as seafood nirvana, it had everything you can think of, was 3/4 the size of our 4-top table and could not be lifted by anyone with one arm!  The food however tasted rubbery and overcooked at best, bland, unappetizing and prepared last week at worst.  Not at any point did our server or anyone else ask how was our meal or if we'd like anything else. So, I repeat, are you people high or was our experience, soup to nuts, just an aberration?  Actually, I don't really care to know, as I will never go here again, no matter what.  The service was as unkind, unfriendly and rude as I've ever experienced, the food is not fit for human consumption and, ironically enough, God bless the ether their patrons must clearly be on for it to be the money maker (hand over fist by the look of things) it clearly is.

Margarita: Okay, I can honestly say the margarita here is great.  I normally do not like margaritas but I thought I'd give theirs a try and I wasn't disappointed.  It was the right amount of alcohol and it wasn't too sweet even though I got the frozen variety.  Mango margarita- give it a try. 3.

We got the one cooked in garlic white wine sauce.  if you love garlic, this is the dish for you.  Quite good, but I must warn you, it was a bit on the buttery side.  If you are looking for a more fresh taste, try a different sauce b/c the calamari comes with many different sauce choices. 4. Steak fajitas - The steak itself was not well flavored and it was tough.  However, the steak came with refried beans that were to die for.  There was also fresh guacamole and sour cream, grilled veggies, corn, rice, etc.    and it was quite good.  A great add-on dish to the main meal, which was the deep fried snapper. 5. Deep fried snapper - Mmmm quite good!  We picked the Diablo sauce to go with the snapper.  It is spice and my bf enjoyed it, but I wished for something sweeter.  I'm a fan of lighter sweeter sauces with my snapper so this sauce didn't work for me as well.  The snapper, however, was very impressive.  It was meaty and tasted great.  It is big enough to share between two people. 6. Chips on the table- Delicious and it comes with two sauces.  You won't find your regular salsa at this restaurant.  One sauce is a spicy chipotle sauce that I found delicious.  I ate it with my fajita and it worked great.  The other sauce was an olive type sauce.  It was very good although I couldn't pinpoint exactly what it was made of. All in all, good food if you are looking for seafood with a mexican flare.  I can't wait to go back and try some more dishes!",0.9989,0.708,0.25,0.042,0.5544332334332335

Bad service! Really? Close quarters! I'm the queen of claustrophobia, so again...Really?  I guess every restaurant can have bad days so if that's the case I definitely went on a good day.

Well yes because you are in a restaurant that primarily serves seafood so there is a likely chance that it will not smell of roses, puppy paws or fresh linens.  It was not a bad smell or over powering or even pungent by any means but it is what it is.  We were immediately taken care of and continued to receive really good service for the rest of the night. It's not the kind of restaurant where they're on top of you anticipating your every move like perhaps Alinea or even Gibsons but I never felt like I had to flag our server down.  In fact they were so attentive that as soon as I sat down and spilled my glass of water all over the floor, it was cleaned up before I knew it.  Onto the food... We ordered a shrimp empanada and a shrimp quesadilla with a delicious cheese/chipotle dipping sauce as appetizers and they were very good. For our entree we shared the seafood platter for two. It came with assorted veggies and some potatoes, a little bit of chicken and steak but with goo gobs of crab legs, shrimp, calimari, octopus, mussels, white fish etc.  Just a big platter of yummy seafood, as the name would suggest.  There was even enough to bring home for lunch the next day. I also had a glass of sangria to wash it all down with and I could not have been more satisfied because it was all just so friggin delicious! Now, the deep fried red snapper?

My friend and I were completely overwhelmed by the options, so limited ourselves to appetizers.  We went a bit overboard, but everything was pretty good and we got a great range without filling up with the unnecessary extras that come with entrees. The best of what we had was definitely the empanadas.  Fish was very good, but shrimp was phenomenally good.  Ceviche was also tasty-- we got the fish version and the fish was very firm, served with pickled onions and fresh avocado.  For landlubbers, the quesadillas are a good bet-- thick with chihuahua cheese and pretty exceptional in a world where every chain restaurant thinks it can do passable quesadillas.    The one thing I would pass on in future visits would be the oyster and shrimp appetizer.  Oysters on the half shell were meh and not served with any of the usual accompaniments (though a basket of key limes and a supermarket shelf of hot sauces are available on every table).  In a bad expediting choice, the raw oysters are served, not on a bed of ice, but on the same plate as the large hot shrimp (which we expected to be cold.  We also expected that their heads would have been removed, but that was before we saw the mammoth whole snappers and recognized a theme.)  So the oysters got a little warm and that did not make them tastier. The pitcher of lime margaritas on ice was good, cheap and nothing exceptional save its goodness and cheapness.  The glass pitcher came with the tiniest glasses you've ever had a drink that wasn't a shot out of, but since refilling was difficult with shrimp-head covered hands, they served to slowed our drinking to a reasonable pace. El Barco is definitely not the place to wine and dine someone you're trying to impress, unless that certain someone is into a hands-on, shrimpy-fingered, noisy room, okay service, overwhelming options of Mexican-style seafood experience.   I'm generally that kind of person, though, so I had a good time.",0.9959,0.795,0.165,0.039,0.5656538897610326

Well,  we walked in and the place was hot, like a sauna, whatever, not a big deal.  SO, we decided to order some oysters (which I tried to order last week, but they forgot to bring them, but not to charge us for them) and they were quite frankly the sickest item I have ever ordered in a restaurant.  Milky, sweaty, absolute sick. I love oysters, and truly appreciate a good one.  Each of the 4 of us tried one, and we had to send them back.  I told her not to worry about bringing out more, I was grossed out.  We ordered the rest of our meal which was pretty good (carne asada, snapper, shrimp, mahi ...tiny mahi) and when the bill came we saw that they charged us for the oysters.  Was a little pissed, but said nothing.  At the same time, the server came up an said she was sorry about the oysters and would take them off.  I was content and watched her go up to the manager, and watched him argue with her.  She than came back and only took off half of the oysters..  Whatever, but the place just let $4 come between me ever going back there.  I am not cheap, the bill was over $100, but just to see that manager argue like we were trying to scam them for 4 oysters completely pissed me off.  Fire that guy and the place has a chance.

And we were exactly right - walked in to the place and it was paccckkked, took us 5 minutes just to figure out who was taking names, and another 5 minutes to actually give him our name. But it looked promising, bustling with folks eating and more waiting to eat, cute atmosphere, lots of seafood decor and nice lighting...we took our hour wait and jetted to a nearby joint for a quick marg to kill some time. Upon our return the place had died down a little, and we were seated in the bar area, up against the window. The menus are ginormous, lots to choose from and funny prices, like 11.97 for an entree. There was a mystery red sauce on the table and a cup filled with tortilla wedges...looks like chips and salsa, should be chips and salsa, but alas, wasn't chips and salsa. The red sauce was scary, I tried it  and have no idea what it was. The waitress was busy, I'll give her that - but we did have to ask for silverware. I ordered an appetizer that she said was popular, had shrimp, octopus, mussels, various other fish and veggies all sizzling on a platter. You had to peel the shrimp, but ours for whatever reason was completely unpeelable, so no shrimp for us. The appetizer was totally meh. I ordered the steak fajitas because that's what I always get and my dinner date ordered the big Barco Fish thing that is basically an entire fish, battered, it's huge and a fun spectacle, I did take a picture. My fajita platter was OK - had to ask for tortillas though, and it was kind of awkward, like, really, should you have to ask? And again, no salsa to be found.

I recommend adding the beans from the plate, some lettuce, cheese (had to order it extra), lime (available at table), and the red salsa. And some salt. After that, they were great, really delicious. The refried beans were the best I've ever had. By far. My gf says thats because they're made with lard. I say, make more food with lard if it tastes that f-ing good.

2007-05-12,5.0,"This is one of my choice places during the summer and it has some of the best seafood in Chicago for the price you're paying. If you've never been, someone at your table has to order Red Snapper something. Anything really. My personal favorite is the steamed Red Snapper with the garlic sauce if you have 40 minutes to wait for a giant Red Snapper to steam perfectly. If you want to horrify and garner awe from newbies, you will order their deep-fried Red Snapper. You ever watch Blue Planet? It's a crispy golden brown version of the angler fish, but edible!  The Shrimp Diablo is a spicy wonderful mess and their butterflied-grilled Shrimp is a delicious alternative to heavy BBQ food if you want something with a charcoal taste.  Seemingly, nobody realizes that the brown sauce is their house recipe Mole sauce. Something that families pass down from generation, a good Mole sauce is a guarded recipe. Seriously, it's something I've tried to coerce out of old Mexican grandmothers because that's something a chowhound does; we accost grandmas for recipes. It's a spicy chocolate sauce combined with roasted chilies of all sorts like ancho or chipotle. AND you can buy it to go.  Next time you make quesadillas or enchiladas, do it with Mole you didn't make but can pretend you did! No one will believe you because you're not a grandmother, but it's worth a shot. You and Rick Bayless can rule the homemade and Mexican-food-made-by-Non-Mexicans world. Warning: the portions are gianormous. Most people could split an entree with someone and be full. When I train to competitively eat, I come here and try my hands on a single entree and appetizer. Their appetizers are about the size of an entree elsewhere. I strongly recommend splitting appetizers to a table, because otherwise nobody will be able to come close to finishing their dinners. The oyster sampler is amazing and the mussels appetizers are BIGGER than what most restaurants offer up as entrees. If you're drinking, and just want something to nibble on, try the ceviche. Ceviche is raw fish ""cooked"" in acidic liquid like lime/lemon juice. Theirs is  just absolutely perfect.  Alcohol: do yourself a favorite and go with the house margarita (lime) on the rocks. Yes, bright pink and blue margaritas are amazing delicious adult slurpees, but they're not as amazing as their own house-blend here (especially since they're more expensive). If you can't stand the traditional margarita, there is a delectable mango flavored one. Things to avoid: It's true their crab legs are soggy and wet. I find them to be awesome, but then again, I only order crab legs when I'm wearing a bib and lack any concern for outward appearances. I also avoid their octopus. It's not so fresh and sometimes they just overcook it. Overcooked octopus is just not delightful.",0.9968,0.771,0.172,0.057,0.5598983281675588

So the dinner comes out on a giant cast iron platter and it's like they took a big net with the catch of the day and dumped it on the grill.  Breaded fish, steak, calamari, grilled chicken, octopus, potatoes, peppers, onions...wow.  This isn't a meal, this is an experience.  I took my brother and some other out of towners here (this ain't Applebees chappy) and he proclaimed it gift from the seafood gods and second to none as far as as monumental meals go. Dinner for Four runs you about $68 bucks...not bad the copious amounts of food you get.  Margaritas are a steal at $6 apiece and they are as potent as they are tasty.  Their tequila selection borders on absurd and if you order enough food the owner may just buy you a round of free shots. Even the 'chips and salsa' are unique.  You get a big basket of fried round corn tortillas (full size) that come with two dips or salsas...I don't know what they were but they were spicy, tasty and good enough to make me play the air drums at one point.  Actually that may have been the tequila that made me do that, but I digress.   Come here with a group for a memorable experience that you won't soon forget.  A word to the wise, if you don't like seafood or your idea of good Mexican food rhymes with 'Farlos O'Jelly' please stay at home and make those Ortega Taco Kits and play with your cat.   Thank you.",0.9877,0.863,0.107,0.03,0.5200235950235951

2006-04-29,3.0,"I originally gave this place five stars.  Portions were good and tasty and served ona  hot plate.  They in fact had one of the best carne asadas I ever had.  I was especially fond of listening to a drunk woman loudly cackling at the bar, which was funny.  The only drag was finding parking. However, since they ended up on ""Check Please,"" the quality has gone down.  I think it is purely from being overwhelmed with lots of business.  The portions are still good and the price isn't bad, but the taste isn't what it used to be.  But what really kills it for me now is the atmosphere.  It is extremely packed and you are forced into a cramped seating situation.   It is almost like those nights back in college or high school when you go to a kegger and it turns out that there isn't another party within 20 miles and everyone knew about this one and it is just begging for the cops to come in and bust it as you take about 20 minutes to move ten feet with all the bodies in the room.     Last time, a friend called in our reservation around 5pm and we were told that we'd be able to get a seat at 8:30.  We all got there early and didn't get seated until 9:15.",0.3792,0.848,0.088,0.064,0.537306763285024

They are prepared with a complex (adobo) sauce and about 3 pounds of grilled veggies on the side. Seriously, I thought I ordered 2 tacos ""a la carte"" and out comes a family-sized feast. And it was really cheap! The veggies were great left over, and it's really colorful and loud w/out being too overwhelming.

You have to ask for the lunch menu, but you get a HUGE portion for a great price. And you get so many fresh grilled veggies with your meal.
