We came in for a party and he proceeded to charge us $20 each to get in, said he had to make his money! What a thing to say to a customer he didn't know. Once inside the place has a very shitty setup! The front bar was impossible to get a drink from. Walking to the open room room where the dancing was, the tables on the outside and private rooms or whatever they are were designed horribly! How can anyone walk past to get to the back tables? Just a shitty design! I went to the bar and paid $21 for a drink and a beer, way overpriced for what appeared like a bar I could find on 26th and California. Overall this place was just a nightmare expletive, I left after 40 minutes and will never return!

2017-06-20,4.0,"This place has two vibes. First, you walk in and there's a bar. It's called Tall Boy Taco. Very casual, nice bar with a nice mix of drinks and some appetizers and obvi, tacos. At the same time, you're also confused... there's a Line that starts to form around 9Pm. People with 10 inch heels, tight short dresses, and men nicely dressed. Looks like they're waiting to enter a Miami Club. Turns out, behind Tall Boy Taco, there's a restaurant called Nacional 27. It turns into a Latin Dance Club at 10PM!  I dug both vibes. Had drinks at Tall Boy and then dinner at Nacional27. The food was delicious. We started with ceviche sampler and the Nacional Platter. The ceviche is not like Peruvian ceviche! But it's still delicious. The platter was smaller and we could have done without. It was a mixture of 1 shrimp skewer, an empanada and something else. We also had the elote. THIS WAS BOMB. The corn was nicely charred and then mixed with delicious cheesy goodness. For dinner I had the gaucho served medallion with chimmichurri. This was delicious. I was overall satisfied with my dinner. The food baby I had would not let me look good on the dance floor, so sadly I didn't stay for the Latin Dancing.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars, is because all the food we ordered came out really fast and one after another. It didn't allow me to enjoy the apps before easing into dinner.  I will definitely be back, this time I'll try not to eat as much so I can dance to ""Despacito"". I liked this place so much that we booked it for our rehearsal dinner.

Here's what I'd say about the food at Nacional 27: it's food for people who don't like food but love sauce. We ate the tiny tacos, several types, and they were covered in various sauces that tasted somewhat institutional. The rest of the meal followed accordingly. I ordered a gin martini with no vermouth, and it was undrinkably vermouthy. Our server was very sweet, but had no idea what she was doing. We cancelled our dessert order because everything took so long and we had a show to go to. Coffee was served cold. And it took 10 minutes for anyone to check on us after it was served, so we couldn't even tell anyone.

I still have guests to this day saying what a great wedding it was.  I think the best part was how accommodating Leye (lettuce entertain you) was during the planning, if I could dream it up they could bring it to life.  I am actually a wedding planner myself so this is no easy feat.  I was so sick of the same old plated seated wedding dinners, I wanted something interactive and fun and I wanted my guests to eat when they were hungry so that is why we decided on food stations, different items available throughout the night and a ton of amazing appetizers during cocktail hour.  The built in DJ booth was key as well and gave our guests the club like feeling so the dance floor was packed all night long.  If you are looking for an amazing wedding or event venue, I highly recommend considering Nacional 27/TBT they will give you your money's worth and more!",0.9948,0.766,0.211,0.022,0.5376955782312924
2017-05-18,5.0,"Wow! This place is a true gem. The service, ambience, food, drinks and seating space was excellent. I had originally made reservations for 5:30pm but due to Chicago traffic wasn't able to make it on time, they were very flexible and allowed me to change my reservation time. Once we got there we were seated promptly in the dining area which is in the back room behind the bar space up front. The seating area was elegantly decorated and very spacious. They have u shaped booths and tables for seating. Lucky for us we got a booth right in front of the dance floor. Happy hour is from 5:30-7pm for select wines. The Chardonnay . The server and the trainee provided excellent service and were very pleasant. They brought out chips and salsa and gave us adequate amount of time to view the menu. We decided to go with the Tiny taco flight of three( $9.95 ) which includes BBQ lamb, grilled beef, and chimichurri chicken tacos. In the Tapas section we got two of the suckling pig croquetas ($4.95 )chorizo fundido ($8.85 ), and empanadas which included  chicken ($6.95) and (2) short rib ($7.95). Last but not least the roasted plantains ($4.95) My favorite was the suckling pig croquetas, it had so much flavor. My second favorite were the empanadas. The chorizo fundido was good had a little heat to it probably would not order it again but it was good to try  once.  The plantains were almost like desert for me it was nice to have a little sweet in between all the small meals. From 7:30pm -8:30 the dance floor opens up to anyone that wants to learn how to salsa and bachata. The dance instructor was excellent and kept the crowd entertained.

The only bad about the meal was maybe a bit too much salt on the steak meal, but everyone's taste buds are a little different.  When we were finished, we noticed the staff starting to clear out the restaurant to make way for the dance club.

For dessert I had the platter. I like that this is an option so you can try multiple desserts. The portion size for $6 is great!

Amazingly, given the tiny portions, I only ate one of them because they were so lacking in taste. Also got the mahi mahi fish tacos, which come with a teeny side of rice (like 2.5 tablespoons) for $20. They were barely seasoned at all and also completely lacking in the flavor department. The rice was good, but it took two bites to finish it.  Drinks: good flavor but lol on alcohol. They shouldn't even card for their sangria pitchers, which are $60 a pop.  Service: meh.

Being the food lover I am, I couldn't pass up all of that food for that price, and besides I could dance off a few of the added pounds after with the salsa lessons haha.  So a few of us arrive and the hostess asks if we want to check our coats. We decline and sit at the bar because we have to wait for the rest of our party before we're seated. A few more folks show up and we're escorted to our seats. We sit down and are immediately greeted by the server with chips and salsa. We take a look at the regular menu and notice that some of the entrees themselves cost over 20 dollars so we instantly knew that the deal was worth it! Everyone at the table ended up ordering the 2017 special, and we each got a different entree to share with one another.  The good thing about the place is that since the dance floor is in the middle of the dining area, you're free to either enjoy your food and watch others, or eat a little and dance a little as most of us did haha. All of the appetizers were really tasty, my favorite being the Lamb taco!! Nice and crunchy she'll, and the Lamb reminded me of barbacoa! All of the entrees were also really good and everyone enjoyed them. I ordered the steak and I was pleased with it. It was cooked nicely as I had asked and the potatoes had a crispy texture that I enjoyed. I tried the salmon and enchiladas as well, and they were also pretty tasty! Most of us at the table also ordered the Hennessey Mojito which was actually really good, and I am by no means a fan of Hennessey which says a lot haha.  As for the salsa lessons, the instructor was funny and helpful which really helped to lighten up folks that were struggling a little. That night was a mix of salsa and bachata, so we did 30 mins of salsa and 30 mins of bachata.

2016-12-11,3.0,"Hmm I have a few thoughts on this place. I met up with my girls here on a Friday night at 11:30 for some dancing and drinks. The first thing I noticed about this place is the amount of guys that show up alone, stand around the bar and didn't dance or do much else other than drink and check out ladies. And yes, I know, there are a few of those at every bar, BUT the amount of guys on the prowl for latinas here was overwhelming. Thankfully my girls and I looked out for each other.  I think overall, the beers were reasonable for the area ($5 Coronas!). The female bartender was pretty rude, but the male ones were okay. The dance floor got packed and stayed that way until the end of the night - which is a good sign! I heard Sirius radio playing when I first got there (no joke, I heard the SiriusXM announcement), but thankfully, the DJ picked it up afterwards and started to play good mixes. Of course we heard your standards like ""Danza Kuduro"" and ""Suavemente"", but he also mixed in some Bachata (Prince Royce!) and slower songs. During the last hour it was a good mix of 80's and 90's with some House music thrown in there too.  I noticed a few people getting bottle service by the dance floor - maybe they should do that by the tables outlining the dance floor? The dance floor was extremely crowded already. Just a thought. There were a good amount of bouncers standing on the far side of the dance floor to keep trouble away. However, nothing could stop the large amount of people making out all over the dance floor - come on, get a room! Now this could have just been a weird, ""off"" night. Or this place could be notoriously known as a hookup bar, a place to meet lots of latinas. Who knows. I'll give it another shot (since I liked the music).

Apparently, our table was a VIP bottle service table starting at 11. A heads up before we sat down or an alternate dining area would have been more appreciated, rather than having to move all together.  Food - 3 stars since as much as the food is good, it's not wow worthy. My salmon was a little too dry while my wife's skirt steak a little chewy.

We breezed past the unwelcoming greeting and were seated. We had been seated for about 10 minutes -- no server yet, but all of a sudden one of the servers arrived and said ""I have your drinks..."" -- Interesting - we didn't order any yet because we didn't meet our server yet. Then our server finally arrived, she was polite and friendly, but seemed busy so she didn't have anything to recommend or say besides take our drink orders, and came back for our dinner order. Food was mediocre, portions were very small. Party of 5 - so we had to order two of many of the tapas plates. Overall, we weren't very impressed with the food or service, and to top it off the valet momentarily lost the car keys for one of the girls in our party -- and all of sudden after 20 minutes of searching the keys miraculously appeared - no explanations, apologies, or offerings to credit the valet charge.

Our friends ordered the skirt steak, which came on a bed of crispy potatoes, and the suckling pig that came with a different kind of potato.  They both said they were great.

It is more for professionals, well dressed types, dating, birthdays .....etc. The music is awesome and you will find plenty of ""Gringos/ white people"" dancing on the floor and trying to move to the latin beats. lol.

I will say that the décor seems a little bit outdated, it reminded me of the club scene in Scarface.

It seems that when you want to reserve a table for the evening with dancing - there is a ""per person""minimum order - $35.  With a group of 9 ladies who were eating and drinking - this was not a problem.  Our organizer went the ""heavy appetizers"" route - which was absolutely perfect. We had the opportunity to taste: :: shrimp & scallops ceviche - citrus, sweet peppers, avocado.  Everything about this was on point.  The taste, texture, balance of flavor - really delicious. :: ahi tuna & watermelon ceviche - spicy rice wine vinaigrette.  Another winner - and quite possibly my favorite of the evening.  The sweet/spicy/buttery combination between the watermelon, vinaigrette, and tuna.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it now, a few weeks later. :: short rib empanadas - caramelized onions, pepperjack cheese - the flaky crust on these was my favorite. :: tostones with corn salsa - I love a good plantain.  The flavors were a little flat - but I still devoured these. ::beef & chicken gaucho skewers - really really delicious.  Well cooked, seasoned, nice vegetables to go along with.

But I've wanted to go back there for dinner and finally got a chance to do so this past weekend. So the restaurant is nicely done and the service was also good. The food overall was good. What I appreciated is that they are very flexible with their menu and were willing to make adjustments for vegetarians. There are other places which get unnecessarily snobby about this stuff - but not Nacional.  To start, the chips and salsa were a bit disappointing. The chips are like really really oily. The salsa was fine, but with the oil dripping with the chips, it sort of ruined it. On to the mains... with the tapas theme, we tried a variety of food.  - Veggie tacos - were really good. The crispy shell was really nice - unique.  - Fried potato tapas, which wasn't even on the menu, but it was good as well.  - Cheese empanadas were nice, with this spicy sauce on top, which made them tasty.  - Veggie enchiladas - these were a bit disappointing. They put too many veggies in      there are very little cheese. Probably healthy, but not very good, even though we      had mentioned that we wanted very little of the grilled veggies.  - Tres Leches - This was the winner of the night.

2015-01-11,3.0,"Cover at the door is reasonable for a spot located in downtown Chicago. $10 cover. If they play their cards right they can charge $20-$25 easily and let all ladies enter free and tax men instead. But that's miami.  The layout is seductively dim. Nacional 27 understands that with music you must create the visual mood to grasp the full effect of latin music. Drink prices are affordable and the bartenders look great. However the method they make the drinks is on the stingy side (more juice less alcohol no matter if you tell them that you'll pay more).  Coat check is free with welcoming tips. The attendant had a organized system and was prompt.  The DJ was good. (Aka good overall but excellent for Chicago). The dj played all types of music not just latin music and their blends between songs worked well.  Dress code was sexy with women but saw some men with tee shirts and baseball caps. I wouldn't accept this because it misconstrues the ambiance of Nacional. Dressing too down also promotes thugs and that's no bueno. If women are dressing up, men should too, no exceptions.  Friday nights - more ladies and less of a crowd. Couples everywhere. Literally as they came in they were all coupled out. I guess it's a good spot to bring your girlfriend or a date.

2014-06-26,2.0,"First I want to review on the experience I had for my birthday. After checking out a few places Nacional 27 seemed to be the best place to have my birthday dinner and dancing. Everything was going great until after all my guests arrived and I realized we all didn't fit at the table (group of 14) The waitress was not very attentive, she seemed great at first but after ordering a pitcher of sangria and it not come out until about 30 min later I realized she wasn't paying much attention. Guests continued to order drinks and had their food come out first. I was very embarrassed with my guests at this point because two of them ended up having to go sit at the bar, and even then the space was very VERY limited at the table. Dancing was extremely crowded and I'm use to going out dancing at other popular places. Nacional just had no space to even walk to the dance floor. My second review is for an event I attended during the world cup. I received an email for $2 all you can eat tacos so I decided to give them a second chance. Showed up around 11, game had already started however they weren't very busy. We weren't greeted by anyone to we assumed it was safe to seat ourselves (possibly yes our mistake) once we were seated we began to eat our tacos which were the usual appetizer size however for the price is was a steal! After eating for about 20 min my bf wanted to order another beer. 20 min after that he still wanted another beer, no one had come by to ask if we wanted another drink after almost 40 min. However we could hear the table behind us get constantly asked if they wanted another drink. This became very irritating to my bf, so he simply went to the bar and got his own beer. After that we noticed the staff became more attentive. We thought well ok they are trying to correct their mistake, but then we hear an announcement about a raffle going on. Apparently everyone around us had raffle tickets. Honestly I don't care about the raffle it just made it more apparent how much we were being ignored. When the check arrived we were charged for chips and salsa that we never ordered or ate. It was only $5 which I would've not cared about it if I would've received better service. I am not the type of person who complains or leaves these kinds of comments because I work in the service industry so I understand servers become busy.

The food was alrite, little pricy, but specifically liked the roasted garlic potato, empanada and quesadilla (all vegetarian).  Now coming to why one star rating, lot of reasons: Q- Why are there ice buckets with scooper on the side of the customer? A-  Well, so that the customer can add more incase he/she needs more ice. Apparently as per the Manager, this is not acceptable and it is hygiene issue and we were not supposed to touch it. Because my friend did, they would have to change the entire bucket and replace the ice. Seriously, why even keep the ice on the side of the customer.  Q- 9$ for 30 ml on the drinks menu. But 9$ for 10ml? A- The bartender, gave us three of us 10 ml shots for 9$ each. This angered my friend and he gave the bartender 50 cent tip. The bartender has the audacity to say, thanks mate for the 50 cent tip and then we showed him how much drink he has given us and he claimed we drank the rest in like 2 secs. He was just upset about the tip and after confronting him he added more. Then a senior guy comes and say, you need to ask politely and we were like we didn't do anything wrong other than show him how much we got and did use the F word showing that he was being unreasonable. Q- Is asking for what we paid for unfair? A- Yes at Nacional. According to them, my friend didn't ask politely so they asked my friend to leave the bar. Obviously the rest of us left with him, but the reason was ridiculous. Would I go here again- Never. Starting with the ice episode and accusing us for not being polite.

The menu was $75 per person (which again was not explained)...way overpriced for the choices of food and the quality of food.  This did however include a nice splash of champagne to get started which is a lovely touch (haha) :)  We started with chips and salsa, guacamole and corn fundido which was fine but nothing special.  Then we had a lamb tiny taco (not given the choice of any others so you better like lamb), queso empanada, plantain tostone and something else...clearly not memorable.  For dinner we both chose the chicken enchiladas out of the limited choices available and those were just ok.  The dessert was the worst part of the meal and coming from someone who lives for dessert that is quite the statement.  We both took one bite and then immediately asked for the check. To spend $250 (dinner plus drinks and tip) on a mediocre meal at best really just adds salt to the wound.  I know its Valentine's Day which is a cheesy holiday but to gauge your patrons while not providing top notch service is really just a shame.

Waited for about 10 minutes for someone to come to the front to seat us. We were the only people in this very odd dining room. It looks like a wedding hall from the '70s. Very brown decor, big dance floor in the middle. I felt like we were at a banquet hall. Eventually 3 more couples arrived for dinner. In over an hour and a half, there were never more than these 4 tables. Even though there were 3 waitresses for the tables, we ended up waiting more than 20 minutes after she dropped off the check for her to come get it and run the credit card. We literally got up and started to walk towards the front/bar to see if someone would let us pay them (amazingly waitress finally appeared when she saw us start to walk).  I didn't like the food, everything was super spicy. The restaurant week portions were weird, almost a tasting menu. I gave it 2 stars instead of one because my dining companion thought the food was ok.

We ordered, I swear some of everything! The Chef came out to thank us personally for enjoying his food and even bought a round of drinks which was really sweet. The mango sangria was very refreshing, but seemed out of place on a cold winter's night. No worries, the next time I go back I'll try the red and make note to enjoy the mango in the summer time on the patio (I can hardly wait!). We had the tapas, salmon, a grilled shrimp skewer that was out of this world, chicken enchiladas, empanadas, the shrimp guacamole (which was THE BOMB!) and the ceviche which in all honesty I'll have to try again because we were ready to burst by the time we turned to that.

Next, it was a platter of Boniato and Plantain Croqueta, Smoked Chicken Empanada, BBQ Lamb Taco, and Grilled Shrimp Adobado - I was afraid that they would only give 1 or 2 of each, but they served accordance to how many people were there at the table. The croqueta tasted like a taro croquette and the empanada tasted like bbq shredded chicken in an empanada shell - both were okay. The BBQ lamb taco was quite delicious and I would have had some more. The grilled shrimp was alright.  Next came the Costa Rican Hearts of Palm, Avocado, and Papaya - a little too salty, brine-y, and it tasted like they used a rendition of the chunky avocado salsa in this as well. For the entrees, I ordered the Grilled Jumbo Prawns with Passionfruit Butter - I thought it was medicore. One friend had the Slow-Roasted Pork and Chicken Paella, which was good - I enjoyed the little sausage slices in there, too. Another friend had the Winter Vegetable Enchiladas with Mole Verde - my favorite of the three - a little salty and cheesy-goody, but it was quite good and you didn't even miss the meat! The desserts were a Cinnamon churro, Key Lime Tartlet, and Grand Marnier Chocolate Cake (the lime tartlet was the best). +NYE specials +live salsa dancing",0.9956,0.802,0.193,0.005,0.6645833333333333

2013-11-24,2.0,"To be honest, this place is over-priced. If the price was more reasonable, i'd try again. Services could be better: I came with friends for a birthday gathering. We were a group of 20 people. By the end of dinner, we were told we couldn't have the tables any more. But the waitress found a table by the bar and was confirmed by another waiter that we can have the table. One minute later, a customer came by the table and claimed the table because his group spent more money in dinner so that he took the table. And we, a group of 20 people, were kicked out of that bigger table and put to a small table at the corner. For the rest of the night, we were standing in other people's way and by the bar. Technically, we didn't quite have a table any more.  Price should be lower: 10 dollars for 3 baby tacos. If you order individual one, it's almost 5 dollars for each one. It's two bites each baby taco.  The big jar of mojito is 60 dollars. I think it's just over-priced.  My two friends who had birthdays were given desert at the end. We didn't ask for that. They brought out to them, and we thought it was a gift and free. But we found out they were charged 8 bucks each. If we asked for the, we would pay. But the fact was, they brought that out and expect us to pay? So just ask before you dig into something they bring out that you didn't ask for.  From a classy restaurant, it turns into a salsa club.  If you have some extra money, this place knows how to help you with that, I'm sure.  The overpriced food was good, but still overpriced.

The dinner was for 15 people, and by Nacional 27's norms, you have to customize your own menu for any party over 12 people. You can't order from their original menu, you are restricted to just options they have on those menus, so we were selected 4 Entrees plus the tapas dessert. Upon making the reservation, I was emailed forms to fill and sign. First form was a reservation form where I had to provide a credit card number incase the reservation is canceled (there was a fee to be charged since our menu was customized, which is a reasonable fee to have). I checked the box to use that card ONLY incase a cancelation fee is to be charged. The second form was to customize the menu for the party and select the 4 Entrees we wanted. The event took place, and the 15 guests paid collectively for the bill, the waitress was nice and wished us a good night after we were told to leave the table because there was another reservation coming in. 2 days later, I notice a $200 charge on my credit card that I used to hold the reservation. I email the person I had been exchanging emails with to set up the party, and her response was that the waitress made a mistake and the bill was actually more than what we were presented at the table. My card was given for them merely to hold the reservation & a cancelation fee incase we cancel. I did not authorize them to use it for any other reason. However, Nacional 27 felt that they had the right to correct their staff's mistake at my expense.

2013-07-01,3.0,"I'd heard some pretty good things about this restaurant/dance club and was excited to go to a friend's birthday here. All in all, everyone had a pretty good time on the ""Miami Friday."" The main kitchen is open until 10:30 and closes completely at midnight. They charge cover after 10:30 and start checking IDs at 10:00. Dancing begins around 11:00. That's pretty much the basic info. Oh, and I'd suggest getting a reservation. First impressions: upscale interior and decor, but it does have faults if you really look. Overall, it is quite nice, though. The menu is higher-end, modern Mexican fare and is a bit pricey. The presentation is good, but the food isn't worth the price. We were there mainly for snacks and dancing, but got a lot of attitude from the waiter for not ordering entrees for each person. He even said we'd lose the table if we didn't order 2 drinks per person after 10:30 (a few people ordered one, but we weren't booted out of the booth).  The dancing here was quite fun even just to watch! At first it was a bit intimidating because it's all Latin music and many of the patrons are obviously regulars and experienced dancers. However, our bad dancing didn't seem to irritate anyone. My only wish is that there were more mainstream music aside from the occasional 30 second remixed top 40 song. The dance floor can also get a bit crowded, but it's not too bad. The patrons seem to be overall in their mid-30s which is a bit old for my personal taste, but I saw a few of those ""creeper"" older men watching the young women. The bar was also lacking.

2013-06-28,4.0,"So I now understand why this place is so popular. It has a few downsides but it is def a place worth checking out .. im sure for some people it will be the best experience.. Food: small portions, interesting flavor combinations. I tried the ceviche sampler (four different ceviches on menu) , bbq pork tacos ( a lil too sweet for my taste ),  I would like to try the other small bites some time.. I think the food on the menu is great going to club food ...not too filling but satisfying.. Drink: I had their famous mojito..i like that it is served with a piece of sugar cane...that was nice.. if u are planning to order something other than their specialties u may be in for a surprise... really watered down stuff... bf  and cousin ordered  regular drinks (martini and VRB) and were disappointed..  Music: I did enjoy the music. The dj was pretty good ..i know its suppose to be a latin club and thus play latin music .. but I did appreciate the regeton and the mixes not everyone is well versed in dancing salsa etc.. I think the music makes it comfortable for tourist and ppl new to that sort of scene to blend in and most important have fun... The only down to the music and I may sound funny saying this..its so loud! After awhile My ear drums went numb and the following day was hearing bells... I have yet to find a club that doesn't do this ... maybe its just me.. haha .. but this place did have me ears ringing louder than usual... Anyways.. I probably would go back here .. I do have family/friends visiting every so often so I think it would be a nice spot to take them out to..",0.9969,0.771,0.213,0.016,0.5602085948239794

Now that to me, is beyond amazing.

My friend told me to meet her there and after having a long week and no Friday evening plans, I was down.  Decor was warm, modern and cute. From what I understand, it turns into a nightclub with Latin dance in the late evening. Background music for Happy Hour was bachata, merengue, cumbia, etc --it enhanced the ambiance of the bar as we munched on food and downed our Latin Libations.  We sat around the bar because we were expecting people to arrive in chunks. Service at bar was fast and friendly and the 'tenders made great recommendations for food and drink.  I started off with the ""el corazon"" which was a tequila based drink with passion fruit juice, pomegranate and salt & pepper rim. It was a bit on the sweet side but the rim kinda balanced it out. My friends had the bacardi mojito with a sugar cane stick and it was yummy!  For food, we ordered numerous items and shared everything which worked out just fine. Among our choices were chips and guac, ceviche, chorizo fundido, and paps. The fundido was defintely my fave -perfectly cheesy and it came with tortialls to make lil' tacos.  A bit on the pricey side for me, but not necessarily overpriced for what you get. However, I would not suggest coming here hungry unless you are willing to spend a lot.  I'll definitely be back.

2013-04-20,2.0,"Went here after dinner with the girls and was underwhelmed. Let me start by saying that I don't like giving sub-par reviews but I think people ought to know what they're getting. With that said, Nacional felt more 'touristy"" than anything else. When my friends and I arrive we immediately found some seats at the bar. The bartender CLEARLY noticed my friend and didn't come over. We both looked at each other and decided that maybe WE were not giving him the correct eye contact. So, we stared him down and after about 8 minutes (PS: the bar wasn't busy) my friend calls him over with a polite ""excuse me, may we have some drink menus"". (PS: He stopped twice to check in with the man seated next to my friend). He hands us drinks menus and QUICKLY states: "" We cannot make everything on the menu because many of the drinks take a long time to make and so we cannot make everything after a certain time."" Then he leaves. WHAAAAAAAAAT? What kind of place is this? I won't go into the 10 minute conversation my friends and I had about this statement, but we decided to go ahead and order a drink anyway. I ordered a blood orange something that wasn't that great for $10.00. I still wanted to give this place a chance, so we stayed for some dancing. At about 10:45pm they started to clear some tables and chairs to reveal a SMALL dance floor. My living room is larger than this dance floor. The music started off GOOOD and then it turned into LATIN-TECHO-RAVE-BACHATA? Huh? The mix of the crowd was actually the best part. Tons of different cultures all dancing together made my heart sing. I even danced with a guy from Romania who was a better dancer than most.  We didn't stay long after that because it wasn't a true salsa club. (Glad I forgot my dancing shoes in the car). Best thing about this place was the diversity of the crowd. I cannot speak for the food but the tiny tacos the man seated at the bar next to us had smelled WONDERFUL!  Will I go back? NOPE. I would also suggest hiring some LADIES to work behind the bar. It was a little strange seeing an all male bartending staff over the age of 27. A ladies touch might kick that bar up a notch or two.  I also suggest having a staff training on what to do when a group of ladies come to bar.

I selected this location because it is a great sit down restaurant and pretty nice Spanish dance club after a certain hour too. When we arrived, happily, we were escorted to our table quickly. As we reached the table we realized we were 3 chairs short and had been placed in a very odd awkward corner. I was furious! The staff brought us over 3 additional chairs, but the table was in such an odd place to say the space was a tight squeeze would be grossly understated! It ended up being two separate tables and both had no room for anyone to move their arms. This was a big and important moment and it's sad that my guests were so uncomfortable, and it's more upsetting that half our guests were at another table where we could hardly communicate. I was really flustered and appreciate the staff being attentive. The manager came over to apologize, we were given 2 free pitchers of sangria, and what seemed to be bottomless appetizers! Overall the food here is pretty good, actually pretty damn good, and their Sangrias are phenomenal! Yes they slipped at an important event, but their efforts to make things better did not go unnoticed. The prices are a bit high but with the atmosphere and location it's nothing unexpected.

The rice is cooked in coconut milk, so its creamy with a hint of coconut flavor, and they have black beans mixed in.

I've eaten here a few times and the food was very good, but what I remember most is the salsa dancing. I love to dance, and this place works well with my level of talent and my inability to ever dance with whomever I was dating at the time, but ability to dance with random guys.  Why does it work well for me you ask? Well, I'm no expert. But I don't feel like anyone's judging my ability/inability. There are people who show up to SALSA. Like in some serious outfits. But there are also people who have no clue what they're doing. There's also a ready and willing pool of men who don't seem to speak English, but they speak the language of dance, and they'll dance with you, generally won't be creepy, and then let you go on with your night once the dance is over.  I found this place to be very low pressure. Don't want to dance? Hang out in the bar, or stay at your dining table and watch. Don't want to get down and dirty with some dude you just met? No problem. Dance and walk away. Want to get down and dirty with someone you just met? No problem. But realize you're going to be sharing close quarters and most likely a lot of sweat, so freshen up before you head out so you can minimize your addition to the sweaty mass of dancers.

First of all, as soon as we arrived our waiter tried to talk us out of the restaurant week menu and told us we should upgrade to the menu which was $11 more per person because the servings were all you can eat. Since we were not starving we thought a typical sized meal would be the way to go.  Consider the spirit of restaurant week - the menu you offer should not be a ploy to get people in to up charge them. Restaurant week is a time to celebrate and introduce people to the great food Chicago has to offer.  Despite the sound of the food on the menu - Nacional 27 has nothing to celebrate. As I mentioned above, the food that was served to us sounded good by the menu description but was bland and boring when we actually ate it. The portion sizes were so small - we were only served 2 of everything even though there was four of us and we had each paid for the menu. Our table of four was served the same amount of food for each course that tables of two were getting - and we were paying twice the amount of money. I could say more about the taste of the food we were served and the service we got while at the restaurant but in the end we had a very lackluster experience at Nacional 27. We left hungry after paying $230 for our ""restaurant week deal"" menu.  I voiced my concerns to the restaurant and have not received any acknowledgment.

Older and younger people, lots of different ethnicities, and unfortunately there were a fair share of douche bags. We mingled with a lot of people, it seemed like everyone was so friendly.

2012-12-16,3.0,"This place gets a C for (C)rowded (C)omfort (C)ustomer service. And I'm a first timer @Nacional 27. I spent just under $2k on my wife's surprise MBA celebration party, and at the end I think it could've been spent better elsewhere, but not all was bad ... the food was really good (as guest from our party stated), as well as the music and ambiance, but there's much to improve on, to take this place to the next level. The plan was to surprise my wife with 20 friends and family members, who'd wait for us to arrive (note: my wife thought it'd be only us for dinner, and she loves surprises). Well, as I walked into the restaurant, who do I see before anyone right in the front, all family and friends ... thanks for helping with the surprise. Luckily my wife was looking the opposite way.  Then, I tell the host, ""reservation for 2, under Ivan or Emilia (wife)"", I was given the dear in the headlights look, all while my wife is eyeing the place (note: all my guest had menu's over their faces- attempting to hide). You could tell this place does not have pre-task meetings to inform their employees on the plan for the day/night, shame on the Managers (I do this for a living, and it's as effective as you make it). Also, while planning the night with the event planner (2 months prior to the night), I specifically noted that I would be with elders (7X60yrs+), and needed an area to fit  20 people comfortably ... we ended up in an L shaped booth. So, when one of the elders needed to use the restroom, 3 people would have to remove themselves from the table, and again when the person returned. I mentioned this to the manager, who said the space seated 20 people in the past (?). I wanted to ask if she would sit her parents in that area, but did not want to start the night off bad. I was frustrated knowing I was going to spend $,$$$, and was not going to get what I asked or paid for ;-(((. Then, we had a person in our group with a deadly allergey to shellfish, which was communicated day one upto the event with the event planner and Chef, and the first thing put in front of the lady was the guacamole with shrimp. To test the staff, I asked the waitress (cute girl with first initial D) if there was any shellfish in the guacamole, her response was ""no"". The lady (who came from Canada) with the deadly allergy, ended up talking to the Chef (who was aware of the allergy and was highly professional and understanding). The food was made separate, but ended up on the other side of the table, this after I pointed out to several employees who had the deadly allergy (lack of communication among the staff was evident). I don't want to poopoo the entire place, because there were many positives, but that's to be expected in any business. It's not what you do right, it's what the customer see's as ... what you do wrong. Customer is always King in a business, because they keep the business, in business.  So in a nut shell: 1. The ambiance was nice 2. The Food and drinks were delicious!!! 3. The music was great, but the floor was crowded and people were literally throwing bow's (note: I'd remove the speakers from the floor to add space, and tell people if they're not dancing to get the ---- off the dance floor). 4. The manager was attentive after our discussion about the seating, and the speed at which the waitress was providing drinks (she'd disappear, but we were an assertive group ;-), and the drinks came fluidly after. The place is compact, which is obviously to generate the most revenue, but this can also equate to lowering customer satisfaction, which can decrease revenue.  As a student of Business Management at Roosevelt Univerisity, and an employee of General Electric for the past 13yrs, there's opportunity to improve the customer experience (Kaizen) in a place with such great food, drinks, music, and ambiance. It starts with the customer in mind.  I probably will not go back to Nacional 27, but it's definitely a place to go if you enjoy Latin American food.",0.9986,0.827,0.148,0.025,0.4478885893980234

They have a parking lot right in front of the building but cost $14 for the night.  The place was decorated nice inside but a little dark especially when you're trying to eat dinner, the lighting was from small candles on the table. My mother had a per order menu for us for $27.95 per plate. She called ahead of time to do this because it was a large group of us and she wanted to have the table for the night. The food was awesome!!!!!  Their was fresh tortilla chips on the table with salsa which I wasn't a fan of, it was dark and had a bitter taste. Then came out with guacamole and it was good but had too much lemon. The main course we had smoked chicken empanadas that were my favorite. Seasoned very well. We also had veggies, mash potatoes as side which were both great!  Other two meats we had was the skirt steak that was tender and the red snapper. The food over all gets a 10 no complaints at all. I also had a cocktail. I had red sangria which was strong and had a great taste. Once dinner was done it was time to dance, we sat by the speaker which was too loud to hold any conversation and the dance floor was way too small! I kept getting bumped to the point I had to move my seat. I recommend going for dinner early but not stay for the club part of the night because the space is limited.

Great variety of food if you are a tapas fan. We pretty much shared everything and loved everything we ate.  For tapas we ordered Roasted Corn Fundido was sweet and delicious. Boniato & sweet plantain croquetas came in 4, and melted right in your mouth, same with the queso empanadas. Everything tasted freshly cooked. We chose 3 tiny tacos for 9.95. The shell was my favorite part, it was crispy and unique. The meat is diced in small pieces and every bite has a lot of flavor and seasoning. We ordered the bbq'd lamb, grill beef tenderloin, and shrimp and scallops.  The mojitos were my favorite. The service was excellent. Everything was great!

2012-11-15,4.0,"As the saying goes, you only get one chance to make a first impression.  You also only get one chance to make a second impression.  On that note, Nacional 27 succeeded wildly. I should point out that the circumstances of my most recent visit were very different from those leading my first review.  After a negative first experience on a Friday night at the bar, Liz was kind enough to invite me back after giving some feedback.  This time my girlfriend and I came in for an early dinner before a show on a Wednesday. Admittedly, for the first fifteen minutes of our dining experience we had the complete undivided attention of the entire staff because we were the only customers in the restaurant, but even as tables started to fill service was excellent... vastly improved from the last time I came in.  Our waitress was fun, friendly, and knowledgeable about every item on the menu.  When a bottle of wine that we ordered was out of stock, she got creative and found a solution.  The food was great and worked for my vegetarian girlfriend.  I could recommend a number of things off the menu, but most of all I would not go back without ordering something off of the empanadas menu. For the budget conscious, it's important to know what you're getting here.  Expect most drinks to be $10+, bottles of wine to be $40+, and each person's share of food at least in the $15-20 range.  But it's worth it.  For our purposes of looking for a fun, upscale dining option prior to a show downtown, Nacional 27 was perfect. It is clear not only from my experience but also from the recent upward trend in ratings that management at Nacional 27 has made a conscious effort to improve customer service.  I'll definitely consider returning if the right circumstance arises.",0.996,0.793,0.2,0.007,0.5065249433106574

The carne asada was delish! 3/5 at the table ordered it and one (a quite picky one at that) said it was ""one of the best steaks I've ever had."" The flavors were great and the meat was tender and accompanied by a bunch of sides. The variety dinner plate was rather small, but did give a little taste of some of their best selling dishes.

First, let's discuss how a side of ""coconut"" rice and beans is 4.95....for a container that my 6 year-old niece could probably devour in 2 minutes.  How do they expect grown  people to actually be satisfied off that?  (Sidenote: What is with people holding out on RICE?  It's one of the cheapest things at the store...let's be honest.)

Only 1 margarita and 1 mixed drink plus food for two and price $130 which should be maybe $55 to $65. Grilled Salmon burnt in places and bad sauce. Tenderloin Medallions on menu at $25 in the light on bill was $29.95 and consisted of 3 one inch by 3/4 inch pieces of so so meat. That's all. Deserts soggy and how can you mess up deserts like this but the presentation was really nice and should be for the high price for size of deserts. Service by brown haired waitress in black jeans with pony tail was really spotty and she has horrible attitude at times, must be rough place to work.

Even the water with ice has an odd flavor but the water in the large bottles of extra water seem ok.

One couple with woman in blue ballroom long dress and guy in jeans and blue shirt moved jerky style pulling each other then stopping and then rushing a ballroom turn. Guess what somehow the instructors from Latin Street decided they were best. Go figure. Doing ballroom turns is not Salsa dancing no matter how fast you do them. The losers were dancing Salsa. STRANGE! The Prize posted was trip for two to Puerto Rico. Turns out trip is to Puerto Rico BUT a two day trip only.  In between someone played extra fast Mambo style salsa. Few dancers. Announcer announced the ballroom dancers as the winners. Gave free Bacardi Mojito. I really like Bacardi. The Bacardi Mojito was so bitter I could not drink it. How could they do that to Bacardi.

People asked for checks and started leaving. Many tables just sat and stared disgusted and then over next half and hour got checks and left. While this came in some barely 21 overweight that seemed to like the noise. This DJ mix of House Percussion with some token latin pop songs occasionally. DJ FROM HELL's NOISE SO LOUD if you talked in a person's ear they had difficulty hearing. VERY BAD EXPERIENCE. Never played any Salsa music. Never played any Merengue but played Merengue song but with HIP HOP HOUSE beat that's why it's the DJ FROM HELL. I just checked and they list DJ KONSEPT.

IF YOU ARE A VISITOR OR COMING TO CHICAGO if you want a bad experience and unload alot of money but get nothing compared to your expectations, then be sure to come to Nacional 27. Might wish to bring ear plugs and eat something good somewhere else. By the way dance floor is small and no wood doubt it is 14 x 18 but tables in way. IF VISITOR nearby Zocalo has good service and very good food every time eaten there but be remodeling it seems. Guess motivated to write review when extremely disappointed. Honestly how feel especially by the disturbing DJ's Speaker Noise. By the way, in the rest room is a guy who pulls paper off roll plus forces you to let him squirt soap in your hand and give you two pieces of paper for money and sink area does not really leave enough space for him. I feel sorry for him that management did not have things arranged better.",-0.9715,0.697,0.146,0.156,0.5258218462823728
2012-08-04,2.0,"This review is based on the salsa club aspect of the venue only.  VERY sexy. We could have been in a  Miami or L.A. club with all the pretty people. But looks can only go so far.  I've only been here once on a Friday night to go dancing. It wasn't the best dance space since the floor was super crowded and there were a lot of drunk people bumping into us (which has usually not been my experience when I go Latin dancing, since people are mostly there to, you know, dance). In addition to the level of intoxication of much of the crowd, they weren't as friendly a bunch as I'm accustomed to. I mean, there was an actual fight while we were there. Not too classy at all. On the positive side, the club does have a wooden dance floor and a coat check.  Nacional 27 reminds me of that hot guy you crushed on until you got to know him a bit better and he totally turned you off with his attitude and behavior... yet still left you somewhat intrigued. He seemed more about scene than salsa, but I would happily give him another chance to reel me in and then break my heart -- for dancing or to try some of the well-reviewed food during happy hour. He's just too beautiful to let go of quite yet.",0.9746,0.836,0.126,0.038,0.6425785634118967

My husband and I chose this place to celebrate our second wedding anniversary.  We liked the idea that the menu allowed us to each have our own dinners, or just share a multitude of plates, depending on our preference that night.  We preferred to share, so tapas it was for the night!  We had the roasted corn fundido, papas bravas, tuna watermelon ceviche, and a flight of empanadas (chicken, chorizo, and vegetables).  I loved the corn fundido but it looked quite different than most queso fundidos we've had (and we've had a lot).  Instead of having a solid based of melted cheese, it definitely appeared more as a creamy corn salsa consistency.  However, the flavor was all there and I loved it!  Corn and cheese...yum!  My husband though it was OK but not amazing.  The papas bravas were delicious...not too spicy but enough of a kick, and the ceviche was a favorite of my husband.  It was good, but it definitely had a vinagarette kick to it that I think I just wasn't in the mood for.  Another day and I may have been wowed.  Finally, we ordered the empanadas (and we were definitely full by this time but had to try them).  I loved the chicken, as did my husband.  The vegetable was one was also quite nice, but I didn't love the chorizo.  It seemed to have more of a one note flavor for me.  Again, though, it  could've just been my mood that night.  Though we wouldn't have ordered dinner (based on our level of extreme fullness) they brought out their churro appetizer to celebrate our anniversary, which was something my husband had mentioned on our OpenTable reservation.  Lovely touch! Overall, I wish the place had a little more life to it.  It was a Tuesday night, however, at 7:00 P.M. so I can completely understand.  But with a great band playing, it just seemed a little duller than I was expecting.  I'd love to return late on a Friday or Saturday evening to see how it fares then, and I think we definitely will.  That dance floor looked quite inviting!",0.9973,0.772,0.189,0.039,0.6212737127371274

The service itself is pretty horrendous--after the food comes out, don't expect the server to come around at all.  We had to flag our server down for dessert menus and our check and it was only after she brought out our check that she began talking to us..almost like she was sucking up to us.  Lady, if you want a big tip, then work on your service first. They open up the place on weekend nights for dancing and lounging, but I felt rushed to finish eating, because they started clearing tables and chairs as patrons were still eating.

2012-04-09,4.0,"The recent negative reviews made me wary but my friends and I had a good experience here on Saturday. There were about 14 of us for a bachelorette party. Our reservation was at 8pm and we were promptly seated. The waiter came and took our drink order, then brought out chips, guacamole and fundido. The chips were a bit too salty for our liking, but we LOVED the fundido! It was different yet tasty. The guac was good as well. The night got even better when we got our first pitcher of mango lime sangria. Ohhhhhh man was it delicious! We also tried the sparkling and white but the mango lime was everyone's favorite. Since we had a large group, we had a pre-fixed menu. The guac and fundido were appetizers and after that, vegetable empanadas were brought out. These were very good but I was anticipating the tiny tacos! We had: -shrimp and scallops: AMAZING! Surprisingly I didn't eat the whole plate. These were the only tacos that didn't have any left over -bbq'd lamb: I'm not a huge lamb fan but these were tasty -black bean: these were pretty good, but nothing exciting We were at our table until 11pm and were never rushed to leave. Our server was very nice, attentive and quick. The dance floor was a bit packed but it was fun to dance off all of our calories! I'm surprised to see this place doesn't have dessert!

2012-04-03,2.0,I've experienced better pretty much sums it up.   The first time I came here was for their Cinco de Mayo event last year.  It included drinks and food - they couldn't have been less prepared for the amount of people that attended.  I think they had 2-3 bartenders to serve the crowded bar and make drinks for tables.  We started ordering an obnoxious amount of drinks because it was 30-45 minutes before the bartender would be around again.  The food was nothing special I thought.  I don't even think we stayed the entire time because it was 1) annoying to wait around for drinks that long & 2) overly packed with people running into you is not a chill event to me. I came back for dinner with a friend a few months later and just wasn't impressed with the food.  The outside patio is nice although the service can be slow.  It took entirely too long to get drinks - and even longer for a refill!  I recall getting some ceviche which was okay but again I've experienced better. My friend had the enchiladas and commented that there was too much mole on it.  We left unimpressed for sure and commenting that we expected better. I'm not sure I will be back a third time - but they do say third times a charm?!,0.958,0.829,0.126,0.045,0.4348710317460318
2012-04-01,1.0,"So most of my friends tell me I'm a pretty positive person.  Judging by my Yelp distribution curve, I would say that that's accurate when it comes to places I've reviewed as well.  However, in all my years of Yelping in Chicago, I've never seen such horrific service as I had here. (Please note that if you're looking for a review on food, you won't find it in the next few paragraphs.) I came here with a group of friends because one of them was invited to an event that involved open bar (until the tab ran out).  We got there around 9-ish, early enough to grab a few drinks before the dance floor opened up.  You would think that our server would then be incented on getting us drinks as quickly as possible so that he can close the tab and start charging.  Nope.  It took us 30 minutes to even FIND our server, and then another 20 before we got our drinks.  The second round (on my card) was the same story. So that meant that in two hours I was only able to get two drinks out of our server.  Undeterred, we headed to the dance floor and it was pretty fun.  Then I tried to go back to the bar and get a drink.  Another 20 minutes passed before the bartender even came anywhere near me.  When I told him I had a tab open, he told me that I have to go find my original server because they all kept their own accounts. Are you effing kidding me???  The place is dimly lit, all of the servers have the same black T-shirt on, with the same height, build, and hair color.  Most times in clubs, I can barely even recognize the people I came with.  And if it took me 30 minutes to find my server the last time around (when there were far fewer people there), what is going to be different this time around?  Finally my friends and I stalked out the area near the bar where the servers were flowing in and out, located someone who vaguely looked like ours, only to have him say, ""Oh, my partner has your cards."" THEN we had to track down the partner server, who finally produced our credit cards after I've been trying to close my tab for an hour. The cherry on top was two big lines in the middle of my receipt:  ""20% GRATUITY WAS / AUTOMATICALLY INCLUDED.""

2012-03-28,2.0,"First of all, the rating could have been a 4star, but our server basically downgraded the rating to 2.  I was in town over the weekend and my girlfriend who lives there suggested Nacional 27, also due to a last minute reservation availability. The reviews looked promising other then the 'slow service'. Which after the fact, I truly believe is the big downfall of Nacional 27. Front bar area is great, plenty of room for seating, waiting for your table, etc. The mojitos aren't anything toooo special- so may as well grab a regular cocktail. I've had better, stronger mojitos elsewhere. I'd highly recommend the ceviche sampler platter- amazing! Comes with a cilantro based shooter that cleanses the palette perfectly. 4 types of ceviche and was a great mixture including tuna, shrimp, etc.The sea bass was fantastic and the other guests dined on the salmon.  Throughout the dinner our glasses went dry. DRY. To the point where we just sat at our tables looking for ANYONE to help us with water. My friend had to get up from the table TWICE to ask where his cocktail from 20minutes was, and reminded our server that we also ordered a bottle of wine. When a server is told that our group is going to continually order drinks, I suggest for your TIPS sake, to swing by every so often. Even getting our bill and trying to pay took a good 15 minutes. Clearly not focused or perhaps management needs to take a hint and hire another server. Around 11ish, the dining area turns into a salsa scene, very loud- so here's hoping you actually finish your meal by then!

We then shared a ceviche--salmon and shrimp. While the salmon was good, there was far too much sauce and the shrimp was so overdone it was rubbery and inedible. We then shared an entree, the suckling pig. It was good. I guess this place is ok, but I don't think I'd return as the prices were so high for mediocre food.

I just said, ""OK!."" and proceeded to order over $650 worth of food. Sometimes just being nice and agreeing with people will help them realize that you are not there to cause problems. They should work on that, cuz it felt very rude. They have a free coat check & free salsa dancing lessons on Thursdays.  So I show up at 6PM with half the 8 people total and they say wait at the bar. when there are 6 of us, we should be sat right? Naw. They were still making up the table. For real?

When we were finally seated we were at a table that was not really large enough for our party and we could tell that they cobbled it together to accommodate us, but we pressed on despite rubbing elbows every time we moved in our seats.  The music was loud, but not overbearing, so that was fine and we were packed in a little close to some other tables, but I suspect that was a symptom of the hasty preparations and not by design. Half of us did the restaurant week prix fixe and half ordered off the regular menu.  The wait-staff was prompt, although some specific requests regarding our food were ignored until we had to send a couple dishes back, then they took those requests seriously. The food itself, once properly prepared, was good enough, I enjoyed everything I had, but some other people in my group weren't thrilled.  Maybe it was just the end of the night or the r-week menu, or something, but some of it was a little uninspired.

We're not lame people, we love to go out to all kinds of places, and loud music isn't a deal-breaker for us... but this was ridiculous.  There was no transition, no warning, no nothing, just sudden, loud music following lackluster service.  And if we'd been seated on time it wouldn't have even been an issue!  The drinks were good, but that's probably not enough to bring me back after this experience.",0.9674,0.809,0.113,0.078,0.44807461930103454

We ordered a few different drinks, I split a pitcher of sangria with a girlfriend, while the two other people at the table got mojitos. They said their mojitos were just average, I tried it and agreed, just average and not much alcohol either. Our sangria tasted fairly watered down and even though we were just splitting a pitcher between two people I barely felt buzzed.

It came with chips and guacamole, both delicious but usually hard to screw up. Though I've been to some places that have found a way.

Then we got to pick 3 entrees - we chose the seafood paella, grouper, and skirt steak. The grouper and the steak were amazing! I'm not sure what the steak was marinated in was it was sooooo good. It made up for the other mediocre apps and drinks. We also got an order of 3 additional tapas we didn't pay for - some more croquetas and potatoes bravas. Nothing too exciting but this addition really made us too full. The server said the kitchen sent it out because our entrees were taking awhile.  The service was fairly good and I was in no rush considering we had an entire pitcher of watered down sangria to drink. I'd go back again just for the adobo shrimp appetizer and the grouper and skirt steak entrees. You can find better drinks elsewhere.",0.987,0.817,0.138,0.045,0.5429166666666667

2012-02-01,4.0,"How many of you have salsa'd while eating a Beef Empenada? Wow! That many of you? Nacional 27 is full of life, energy, and spontaneity. Plus some of the best finger food this city has to offer. I only wish the entrees followed their cohorts as well. The drinks are damn good too.  When group was seated, we ordered a slew of things to munch on. This included guacamole, Ceviche sampler, crispy steak nachos, and variations of their empenadas and tacos. The guac and ceviche were extremely fresh and very refreshing to start off with. The nachos, empenadas, and tacos were all comforting, loaded with great flavor, and touches of heat. These kinds of food are what I believe Nacional does best.  Next up is their great selection of drinks. The N27 Margarita is a good way to start. While eating, dancing, and resting we all had a bunch more drinks. The El Corazon was one of my favorites, the salt and pepper rim kicked off the acidic flavor from the rest of the cocktail. The La Jefa, Spica and Ice, and El Cubano were all really good too. My girl got some Sangria and she said she enjoyed it. That's a pretty big statement since she makes her own versions frequently. I typically drink it like it's juice... My only disappointment with Nacional was their entrees. I had a crusted ribeye, cooked nicely, but the rest of the reduction sauce and side pairings were nothing I'd write home (or yelp) about. Everyone else seemed to be relatively unimpressed with what they ordered. But we all kept coming back to how good the drinks and app's were.  Once it gets late, they turn into an all out salsa bar. I got owned by all the Latin men who could dance like they were getting paid to do it. Since we were all buzzed, we had a lot of fun kicking our feet and moving as best as we could to the music.  Nacional 27 is a great place to celebrate. I'd recommend a lot of people and stick with their finger food. Order in waves and don't hesitate to try a lot of their appetizers, their all good.

The space is still sleek and sexy, though the abundance of drapery makes it seem perpetually unfinished! We had shrimp and scallop ceviche, which was outstanding and filled with avocado. The rainbow ceviche was filled with tuna, salmon, and shrimp, and despite liking tuna and shrimp, the overabundance of tomato sauce made it difficult to tell where the salmon was, so I ate some, which wasn't fun. As I told my mom, ""This tomato sauce needs to calm down."" It was a ceviche! Oy vit the sauces! I had a delicious, perfectly cooked filet. The potatoes were above-average, nothing major. The chorizo was a nice touch. The red wine sauce was good but perhaps a bit much given how rich the dish already was.  Even though the entree I got wasn't the best in the world, I really like Nacional 27. It is expensive, so it's hardly an everyday sort of spot. Still, the food is bursting with flavor, not to mention well crafted and imaginative. The same can - and should - be said for the cocktails.

The grilled vegetable empanadas could have used more spice. I was thankful that the outside was nice and crispy because otherwise the inside was a little more mushy than I like. The gratin was truly disappointing.

Anyway, the atmosphere was fantastic.  All the staff were friendly.  I really liked our waitress.  We were seated in the center of the room, which I think is normally a dance floor or a place for bands or entertainment but I assume they had extra tables for the special weekend.  I would like to go back sometime when a band or dancing is going on.   I hate when I forget to write reviews right away because it is hard to describe the food as well, but I will do my best.  I loved the lobster bisques, nice big chunks of lobster and super tastey.  The appetizers were quite good, but not that memorable.  I think that what elevated them were the sauces.  I had the marinated skirt steak and LOVED it, again the sauce on the steak was fantastic and it was cooked just right.

The food, the atmostphere, the service, the dancing...everything combined for a terrific, unique way to spend an evening!  The sangria was flavorful and not watered down at all.  The mojito was also spot on.  For appetizers we shared the shrimp skewers, chicken empanadas, bbq'd lamp tacos and boniato and plantain croquetas.  All were delicious but the unanimous favorite at our table were definitley the tacos!  For our entrees, we had the seafood paella, grilled marinated skirt steak and the chicken enchiladas.  The mole sauce on the enchiladas was fantastic!  All the entrees were well-received but my personal favorite was definitely the enchiladas.  I'd love to go back to try some of the other amazing sounding items on the menu. After taking a look at the full menu, I think Nacional 27 is a much more reasonably priced restaurant than one would think by its atmosphere and location.  And the salsa dancing that starts around 11 is so entertaining and really makes for a fun night out.  If you can wait for a late dinner reservation (after 9), you can keep your table for the duration of the night and enjoy some great people watching!  Next time maybe I'll hit the dance floor :-)",0.9966,0.772,0.228,0.0,0.6535586277521761

Well for starters the place wasn't really happening but that could also be because it was St. Patty's day and everyone was at Irish bars. The service was excellent and so were the passion ginger and mango sangria pitchers we got. The guacamole we got as a starter was fantastic. As always, I was looking for a good vegetarian dish. I was a little disappointed that they didn't seem to have any veggie entree options that couldn't be shared. Since it's unlikely that most vegetarians also have friends who don't eat meat, it's rather inconvenient. However, to make up for it, the waitress was actually vegetarian herself and gave her honest opinions about what veggie options were truly flavorful and worth it. I didn't love the costa rican hearts of palm salad like I was promised. It was a little too egg-y for me. However, the boniata and sweet plaintain croquetas were excellent...melted in your mouth. The spicy green rice had what my friend described as a ""Ba-bam!"" to it. It definitely had a kick to it and had a lot of flavor. Finally, the fried plantains did not disappoint either. As a vegetarian, I would like to see more entree options but all in all, especially given the great service, I really enjoyed my dinner experience.",0.9958,0.694,0.255,0.051,0.5891304347826086

We ordered a lot of food.  We ordered a whole lot of drinks.  We sampled a good portion of the menu, but there are still some dishes I'd come back to try-- like their Latin paellas.   You must tried at least one of their ceviches.  We had the rainbow coctel and the ahi tuna/watermelon.  I so fell in love with the ahi/watermelon.  I've never had that combination, but it was so crisp and refreshing.  Something I definitely won't forget anytime soon. We also ordered the smoked chicken empanadas.  There were alright, nothing special.  I still prefer Filipino empanadas or the homemade ones I make.  The boniato and sweet plantain croquetas was also so-so.   I ordered the chimichurri crusted filet.  It was delicious and cooked perfectly medium.  It was juicy and tender and I loved the potato chorizo hash and malbec reduction that accompanied it.  My friend got the sucking pig cubano.  I was expected to see the actual pig, but they serve it already chopped up.  Tasty, but a bit heavy on the spices. And I saved the best for last--the drinks.  OH man, the drinks.  They have five or so different sangrias.  We got a pitcher of the mango lime sangria.  It was dangerous because you can't taste any of the alcohol, but you can sure feel it.  Also ordered a pitcher of the traditional mojito--very tasty and authentic as well, not too sweet.  They also had some drink specials for carnival.  The mango batida (mango puree, condensed milk, and bacardi) is so yummy.  If anything, you should visit Nacional for the drinks alone.

My husband, then boyfriend, pulled a trick on me so even though I enjoyed this place, I always had bad memories. Well, I decided to make a reservation to get rid of those feelings and I am so glad we came.  We got seated at a two top that was spacious and fit in to the curve of the booths below. One thing that did bother me was that everyone at the table had to do the restaurant week menu. This was the only restaurant we had encountered that requirement. It didn't really affect us since we were doing that but there should be that option. The appetizer sampler included shrimp skewers, lamb tacos with BBQ sauce, croquettes, and chicken empanadas. My favorite was the lamb taco. The BBQ sauce on lamb is genius. I didn't know how that would taste but the combination is just lovely. For dinner, I ordered the suckling poblano pig with spicy eggplant and rice and beans and the hubs ordered the chicken enchiladas. My dinner was sublime. The pig was garnished with crispy pork rinds which were amazing. I've tried pork rinds in the past and they never tasted this good. The pig was tender and the spicy eggplant was delicious. The hubs enjoyed his chicken enchiladas but I feel you really can't mess those up.  For dessert I opted for the small scoops of chocolate and banana ice cream with mango sorbet. It was the best way to round off my meal. Very light and tasty. The hubs got the chocolate cake which he enjoyed but couldn't finish. We both had to go boxes as we had filled up on the appetizer course. Service was good and the meal well paced. It never got packed in the dining room but the bar was hopping when we left.

2011-02-25,4.0,"I went to Nacional 27 with two friends during restaurant week.  One of my friends and I got there a little early so we snagged a seat at the bar and grabbed a drink (very cool decor in the bar area.)  The mojitos sounded refreshing so we each ordered a traditional mojito.  YUM!  I don't know if it was just the bartender that was working or if they all have it down, but the balance of mint - lime - sugar was spot on.  Delicious! Once my other friend arrived, we sat down at our table.  We were in the area with what I'm guessing is a dance floor later in the evening but while we were there (from like 7ish-9ish), there were just tables covering the floor and lots of other diners.  My first thought that it would be a great place for a private party - even possibly a small wedding reception!  Loved the atmosphere/decor. Anyway... back to things that really matter... the food... The first course on the restaurant week menu was a quartet of tapas.  1) Boniato and Plantain Croqueta 2) Smoked Chicken Empanada 3) Lamb Taco 4) Shrimp Adobado Skewer.  All were very good!  One of my friend's favored the Croqueta... my favorite was the taco (YUM YUM YUM!!!)  Lots of flavor and unlike any other taco i've had... i don't know what the sauce on it was, but seriously... YUM.   For the second course, we split three entrees (three very generous portions!)  1) Suckling Pig Cubano, Spicy Eggplant, Black Beans & Rice 2) Grilled Marinated Skirt Steak, Salsa Criolla, Costa Rican Potatoes, and 3) Seafood ""Paella"".  Again, all were fantastic!  We couldn't really decide on our favorite - the Sucking Pig was amazing but the salsa on the skirt steak really made the dish (had a balsamic base that really complemented the tomatoes and the steak... very good, balanced flavor!)  The paella was by far my least favorite... still really good, the other dishes just made me want to pick up the plates and lick them! For dessert... It should be noted that I am a dessert snob, so I just thought they were okay.  The Grand Marnier Chocolate Torte was too chocolately for my taste.  It was almost like a dark chocolate fudge cake.  It was okay but once you have a bite of, you're done.  It needed something to balance it out more.  The Tres Leches Cake was delicious.  Tres Leches cake naturally has an odd texture so my one friend didn't care for that but if you're okay with the more squishy/soaked cake texture, the flavor was good.  The sorbets and ice cream were good but nothing spectacular and the flavors were kind of an odd combination - mango, chocolate, and banana.  I am not a fan of banana flavored things so that was not for me.  The chocolate was fine but nothing to write home about.  The mango was the best of the three - very refreshing and tasted like fresh mangoes. Finally --- Our service was fantastic!  At the bar we got waited on right away.  Our waiter was friendly, helpful, and attentive.  Our water glasses were always filled and plates cleared.  The manager (i believe?) stopped by to make sure we were enjoying our evening.  Overall - very good.

The croquetas were ok and I didn't taste the shrimp b/c I dont like shrimp, but my friends said they were decent.

My other friend had the chicken enchiladas and they were good but dry....really dry! But the mole negra sauce was great.  Dessert for me was the chocolate torte. When they gave it to me, it was like a 1 inch sliver of torte. I was thinking to myself 'do I look like a little kid here?!' I can eat more than this!' But seriously, that torte was so rich and creamy and that 1 inch piece was just enough! Oh and their whipped cream is homemade so it's nice and light and not super sugary.  The resturant itself is nice. Not overly loud and crazy, but simple with a touch of Latin here and there. Word to the wise: Do NOT sit by the windows when it's cold.

Even with the ahi tuna ceviche, I decided to have the center cut ahi tuna entree.  Perfectly seared and not too sizeable, this is exactly what I was going for after filling up on appetizers.  Looking around the table, no one could be bothered with conversation as each person focused in on the culinary treat in front of him.   As a bonus treat for the birthday boy, a mixed tray of amazing desserts were brought out, and everyone ordered an espresso beverage.  Although I was quite satiated with my meal, the creamy pudding type dessert (whatever that was), the flan, and the chocolate cake were all phenomenal.

Thursday - Saturday nights this shiek latin spot transforms into a salsa club.  This is the most accessible way to experience salsa in the city, as the interior is quite open, and the music is great.  Some people claim to be good dancers when they have a few drinks....Chances are these people have nice friends who can't tell them the truth.  Regardless, the delicious drinks here are sure to give you that confidence to sway your hips to lux Latin rythms. The Lamb tacos are incredible, and in my opinion the most delicious thing on the menu.  I like Nacional for drinks and appetizers more than a full meal.  It's a great spot to stop in after work for a sip and a bite, but a little overpriced for a full meal. Whenever I've been here to dance, I immediately think of the scene from Scarface where they are sitting at that round booth in the club.  There are similar looking booths, and the decor screams plush.  There are generally some pretty attractive, well dressed people here strutting all over, but it still feels real and relaxed.

2010-12-19,3.0,"I'm a big fan of tapas, so I thought Nacional 27 would be a good location for my birthday dinner this past Friday. I made reservations for 10 about 2 weeks in advance. For large parties -- 8 or more, I think -- the restaurant requires credit card info for the reservation. If you need to cancel, make sure to do so 24 hours in advance, otherwise you'll be charged $20 per person for flaking out. Per OpenTable, parties of 8 or more order from a pre-set menu, but this wasn't the case for us. We all ordered individual entrees.  Nacional 27 currently has 11 items on their small-plates menu, which seemed a bit limited to me. We ordered guacamole & fundido as our appetizers. The guac came with a tiny cup of salsa as well - wish there was more of that but everything was tasty. I split a $27 pitcher of passion-ginger sangria with one of my girlfriends. It's supposed to serve 6, but we easily finished it ourselves. It definitely could've used more alcohol because I only had a tiny buzz after 3 glasses & I'm a lightweight. Tasted good, nevertheless. Another friend ordered the passion colada mojito & that was DELISH. It was very tropical, with hints of coconut, pineapple & passion fruit. So good!  Two of my guests ordered the grilled salmon & they both loved it. I had the grilled marinated skirt steak & it was juicy, smoky & well-seasoned. The crispy potatoes provided a nice contrast to the tender steak, & I enjoyed the tangy salsa.  Once the clock strikes 11, tables are moved & the dance party begins. We were still seated at our table, watching the great & not-so-great dancers hit the floor. Three of us got in a quick dance before making our exit.

2010-12-15,4.0,"my rating on this might be a little skewed as i went for the first time as a guest to a holiday party. but from the vibes, food, and drinks i can say this place was really fun. i really liked the interior and the set up. (including the dance floor...i dont really know how to salsa but i am not afraid to dance and this would be a really fun date) the drinks were great. i dont love tequila or mai tais but that were free flowing. i did have a caipirinha for the first time AND LOVED IT.  THEN THE FOOD. i was so sick by the end of the night because i had to taste everything: cold seafood tacos, hot lamb (maybe) tacos, steak quesadillas, GOAT CHEESE AND PUMPKIN CROQUETTES (!!!!!!!!!!!!!). after that THEN WE SAT DOWN TO EAT i was dying. the chips were awesome as was the salsa & guacamole. then FOUR types of ceviche. i wish i hadn't been drinking (and eating so much other stuff) so that i really could have enjoyed the ceviche! The one with watermelon was awesome. then came the entrees. i only remember my date having the salmon and really enjoying it and then i had the chimichurri slathered steak. it was awesome.  anywho i had a blast and i would really like to go back for a 'date night' and only get a few things so that i could appreciate everything more.  *i am wondering why everybody is not liking the food as much...maybe they really pulled out all the stops for the party? i am not sure but i am willing to try the food (non-party) for myself!*",0.9967,0.709,0.237,0.054,0.591455853174603

2010-10-18,5.0,"We recently came here on a double date to celebrate a birthday on a busy Saturday night - Sweetest Day unbeknownst to us so it was pretty crowded. Fortunately we had made a reservation in advance. Just a heads up on reservations - you can reserve online, however if you don't cancel within 24 hours, you will be charged $20/person on the credit card you register.  We arrived ~30 minutes early but they seated us anyway, which was great since we were pretty famished after a long day. I think in anticipation of the crowd (since on Fri/Sat nights it becomes ""Club N27""), they tried to squeeze more tables in than usual, so our seating wasn't that comfortable; being right up against other chairs' backs. Surprisingly, this never became an issue during our stay. We were promptly greeted by our friendly waitress who did her thorough spiel about the menu, specials, etc. While we browsed the menu, we dug into the delicious chips and salsa.  The tortilla & taro chips were warm and light and the salsa had a very tasty smoky flavor; I would absolutely LOVE to get the recipe for this. This is not one of your usual watery, tomato-y salsas. We ordered the guacamole as an appetizer - very fresh, topped with cilantro and came with more tortilla & taro chips. For dinner, we all ended up ordering the same thing - the grilled marinated skirt steak and it did not disappoint. Smothered in salsa criolla, and topped with bits of caramelized onions, this steak was very tender & flavorful. The Costa Rican potatoes that came with the steak were equally amazing - baked to a perfect crisp. We also ordered a side of the spicy green rice which lived up to its spicy name and was very moist and provided a nice little kick. For drinks, we went with the passion-ginger sangria, a white-wine based sangria and it had great flavor, although I will admit it was bordering on being a little too sweet and was a bit weak in the alcohol department - tasty nonetheless. Even though they were very busy, our waters were always filled, our waitress came back to check on us rather frequently, and our chips were refilled. All in all, great service.  To top it off, the birthday boy got a complimentary dessert topped with a candle. For dessert, the rest of us shared an order of the churros which are amazing - and a must-try. The texture of the churro and cinnamon flavor topped off with a creamy dulce de leche ice cream mini-scoop is amazing. However, they certainly administer portion control when it comes to these - you only get 4 small pieces (probably half of the size of a normal churro in all).  One more thing to note - this is definitely a place to go for a nice dinner, but it is also a great spot for happy hour or just to hang out at the bar. I'm definitely looking forward to coming back here for some more chips & salsa as well as to try out a different entree.

We always compare skirt steak entrees to Carnivale, who serves some mean skirt steak. And Nacional 27 exceeded Carnivale last night in that department.  Service was spot-on as well. The waiter was completely professional without being overbearing or at all annoying. Our waters and drinks never went empty. Oh, and speaking of drinks?

2010-07-27,2.0,"I'm gonna buck the trend here and not fawn all over this place. Just got back from here on a Tuesday night that started off fairly promising, but was killed by the main course.  To begin with, the place was dead, turns out we didn't need those reservations after all. After standing at the hostess stand for a good two minutes, we were finally greeted by the hostess. The bar is right next to the stand, and although the bartender saw us, and was not otherwise engaged, he didn't bother to flag down the hostess, or at least tell us that someone would be with us soon.  We were seated right off the dance floor, which was fun because they had a couple of professional dancers doing some salsa dancing and giving lessons to some of the braver patrons seated throughout the place. I have to say, the girl was pretty fun to look at.  Ok, food. We started with the guacamole and the fundido, both were excellent. The fundido was not overly cheesy (normally, I like my fundido to be smothered in gooey cheese) but was absolutely delicious. The guacamole was also really good, but was a little too chunky so I ended up mashing it up with a fork so I didn't keep busting my chips when I went in for a dip.  The main course was pretty bad. We ordered the Pork Paella, which was supposed to come with pulled pork, roasted chicken, and chorizo. It was mostly bits of chicken, with one very small clump of pulled pork, and 4 or 5 tiny bits of chorizo (about the size of a nickel) that had been horribly charred beyond all recognition... Unless you knew it was supposed to be chorizo, you would have sworn you were biting down on mini charcoal briquettes.  The evening was somewhat salvaged by dessert. We ordered the cinnamon churros topped with dulce de leche ice cream and candied brazil nuts. It was pretty tasty, but the ice cream tasted more like regular chocolate than dulce de leche, and there was barely a teaspoon of brazil nut pieces crumbled in the center of the plate.  You know, as I'm writing this review, recalling just how unspectacular the evening was, I am making the decision to go from the three stars I've got for it now, to the two stars you will see when this review goes live.

They used to bring a chef's tasting to start the meal, which was delicious and added that touch of class. Now you get a basket of chips and salsa, not classy. The menu has also changed, and I'm afraid not necessarily for the better. There are nachos here now!?!? Again, I love nachos when I go to a bar and grill, not at Nacional 27. Not sure what they are trying to accomplish with the changes, but I don't like them. They also added paellas and gaucho-style dishes?!? WTF? Trying to compete with Texas de Brazil? Perhaps business has been slow and they are trying to become more mainstream? Bad move in my opinion. Also, I think cocktail prices have gone up. I paid $14 for my drink. It was really good, but not a big drink and $14 is really way too steep.

I was slightly less impressed with the cocktails - they looked awesome but tasted okay.  Also, I think that tapas menu is kind of chip & dip heavy.  They have chips & guac as well as a queso dip on there - I left feeling like I'd been bad at someone's Superbowl party.

2010-05-03,4.0,"My office reserved the restaurant for our 5 year anniversary party; we were fortunate enough to enjoy a gorgeous evening with some cocktails on the small patio off the bar. I started out with an El Corazon - one of the signature cocktails. The drink was fabulous, albeit a little too fabulous; sweet and smooth, I had two in something like 20 minutes. Since I didn't want to be the coworker passed out in her dinner, I had to step away from the El Corazon.  My first greyhound, my standby drink, was 5:1 vodka to grapefruit juice; it was all I could do to choke the thing down. I appreciate a stiff drink, but if I had wanted a glass of vodka, I would've ordered one. My second one was just the opposite, so weak and sweet that I wondered if I had been mysteriously cut off. I moved on to the margarita, which was adequate, but there was something off about it that I couldn't put my finger on.  During cocktail hour we enjoyed some passed hors d'oeuvres; I particularly enjoyed those little balls of fried awesomeness, the boniato and plantain croquetas. The grilled veggie empandas were fine, but forgettable. The shrimp skewers were fantastic, but difficult to eat without looking like a savage and/or dripping the fantastic marinade on your nice outfit or the floor.  For dinner we moved into the main dining area, which is intimate, yet also not. The cozy half-round booths were nice, ideal for a romantic dinner, but situated along the perimeter of the dance floor, less than ideal for a group event.  Our meal was served family-style, which was fine, but the size of the table made 6 place settings and all of the dishes a tight squeeze. To start we had chips, salsa and guacamole; salad and verdita shooters. The shooters were quite strange; green in color, they had a grassy taste and smell. Surprisingly, it wasn't the grassiness that bothered me, but the extreme sweetness of them.  For our mains we had seafood paella, beef tenderloin medallions, vegetable enchiladas in a mole verde, chicken in a mole verde and sides of boniato and grilled vegetables. I don't eat beef or chicken, but the rareness of the beef caused issues for most of my table; it looked one step above moo-ing. Sadly, the paella was forgettable, skimpy on the seafood and not very flavorful. The enchiladas were amazing, the mole delivered the perfect amount of heat. I think it was unanimous that we all would have taken another platter of those. The mashed boniato (Mexican sweet potato) was another standout - sweet and savory, I shamelessly could've eaten the entire bowl. For dessert we had a chocolate cake with chocolate sauce and fresh whipped cream over it - heavenly.  Service was attentive, especially during cocktail hour; no one went long without the offer of an appetizer or cocktail. When I snuck out, my coworkers were dancing & karaoking it up like it wasn't a Thursday and the bartenders were still rock stars, effortlessly churning out drinks.  This place was great, there really wasn't a detail overlooked; you wouldn't have to twist my arm to come back here. However, I think it works better for dates or small groups; maybe if the seating plan were different I would change my assessment.  P.S.

That turned out to be croquetas, chips and salsa, and two kinds of paella. It was good, again nothing amazing, but hey less than $3 for dinner? I'll take it.  Of course, then we ordered one teeny tiny taco (meh) for $5 and one shrimp skewer (3 shrimps) for $5. We split a pitcher of sangria between 3 people for $27. So somehow our ""super cheap"" dinner equated to $60 with tax and tip, for three people - $40 of that was for my husband and me. And really, what we ate was not worth that much.  Except it actually ended up being $50 ($70 total) because while I clearly wrote the tip as $6.83 (and then threw in an extra buck in cash for a total tip of $7.83 on $52 - service was mediocre) I accidentally made the total $70. So for bringing us plates for the buffet, two dishes, and a pitcher of sangria , our waitress received a nearly $18 tip. Yes, it was my fault for writing the total as $70, but the tip amount was clearly $6.83 so waitress probably looked at that and made the executive decision to go with the higher amount.

For $2.95, you can indulge in an all-you-can-eat mini-buffet with two types of paella, chips and salsa, and the boniato and plaintain croquetas. Add a pitcher of sangria to split amongst friends and you have a very affordable meal.  We also tried some things off of the menu. A mini beef taco, which tasted sort of barbecue sauce-ish, and a shrimp skewer, which had the same barbecue sauce flavor. Man, those Latins love the bar-b-que. I also had the oyster shooter. An oyster in a little bloody mary shot glass and for an extra buck they throw some vodka in there too. It was good.  Nothing else off of the menu really stood out as a ""must try."" As my friend said ""this is like the Latin version of a chain restaurant...like the Latin TGI Friday's."" Except there were no pieces of Latin flair.  I would definitely go back for the Friday special. Also, their drink menu was phenomenal so I might go back on a Friday or Saturday night for some salsa dancing and drinkies.

We came on a hush hush night, not a salsaaah night, just a mundane Monday. It was friendly enough as we walked in, but it took about 15-20 minutes for anyone to greet us, get us water, or ask if we were ready to order. A few people passed by asking if we needed help, and when we said yes..they nodded and walked away. I was confused. After the initial waiting, we asked for the tapas tasting menu and decided to go for it. We ordered one of everything (it is all you can eat, no?). Everything was so-so..the queso fundido with corn in it was addictive, but I am also easily addicted to anything with chips and a dip. On that note, the guacamole...I LOVE guac, but this guac was fizzy when it hit my tongue. My husband agreed with me and the staff brought us another..but it was still fizzy..kinda like soda fizzy. Somebody tell me if I am losing my mind on this!  The best dishes: steak taco (yeah, I know it's not on there, but the chef made a boo boo and gave it to us by mistake, darned good mistake), the tuna watermelon ceviche, palm heart salad, churro/ice cream, and chocolate cake. The empanadas were doable, but were fairly starchy, so just a heads up on that.  Service after the aforementioned finger tapping minutes was delightful and helpful. We would come back perhaps for the ceviches, perhaps some chimchurri dish, but for tapas...we will hit our favorites instead.",0.9924,0.803,0.166,0.03,0.4774509803921569

Still a fan though!  We wanted to take advantage of the free salsa class on Thursday night. It was advertised as starting at 630 so we arrived around 6 to have a drink at the bar. Eventually we were told that the class wouldnt actually start until 7. The teacher came by and got us when she was ready which was nice. I have never salsaed before and I thought she did a good job of teaching us the basics. It was actually kind of fun-- even though I'm what you might call ""rhythmically challenged."" After class we sat down for dinner. I had told the host that it was my boyfriends birthday and she had promised to let our server know so he could bring out a complimentary dessert. I was a little surprised that she sat us at one of the less desireable tables in the restaurant considering I had told her it was a special occasion and there were nicer spots available, but we went with it. The food and drinks were great as always. The Tuna Ceviche is one of my favorite dishes in the entire city and I don't even really like watermelon. Don't miss this dish!! Everything was really nice until we finished our food. Our waiter completely went MIA on us. We sat there for at least 20 minutes wondering if he was going to bring the bday dessert. We never even saw the guy elsewhere in the restaurant. I finally had to go ask the hostess about it, and she had desert sent over right away. The waiter mysteriously showed up right after that. Kind of lame. Anyway, this is generally a great spot, I was just a little disappointed in the service this time around.

2010-03-20,5.0,"I needed something to take the edge off from my full-time job as a girl detective (a Yelpencyclopedia Brown, if you will), so good food, drinks, and company were just what the doctor ordered.  We got a 9pm reservation for dinner and after bidding our cab adieu, were greeted by a cacophony of infant wailing and screeching tires.  My date and I spun around to see a pram rolling across the boulevard while a racing Karmann Ghia sped towards the tot. Without a thought, I darted out into the road scooping up the carriage with one arm, while doing the Heisman stiff arm with my right. The car stopped, duhviously, from my formidable strength. Running back, I saw the bumper was unfortunately dented by my force, while I reunited the baby with its mother on the curb and myself with my date. Within seconds, we heard the caterwaul of sirens. The Five-Oh informed me, as they cuffed the driver, he was a runaway car thief and not to feel too guilty about the damage I inadvertently did to the car, the owner is a known bigot. They confided they were already aware of my talent and good deeds, and knew my skills were being wasted in menial duties. They shared there's a job for me as an operative; involving clandestine, undercover work (with maybe two others), as a model, pageant contestant, or cocktail waitress for big wigs solving crimes and using kung fu. Moreover, a key for the City is mine to be had. I admit I was tempted and even thought of the catch phrase for me (""Book em' good lookin'"").  But siren song of dinner harkened.  While my date talked to the charming hostesses and put our coats in the complementary coat check, I look up and see Dr. Peter Venkman.  He started hitting on me ruthlessly- hey! He's funny and hot, but go chase a ghost, gopher, or groundhog, my dance card is full! We were sat by the lighted circle thingy in the dining room.  I wisely chose to sit adjacent, while the companion was backlit by the fixture, and we ordered the house marg and ""look better naked"" marg, both without salt. They came with salt anyhow, but we had straws and they were delish.  The drink and beer list is long and inexpensive. The free chips and salsa were unimpressive (the green salsa was mild and portion small, my date liked it though). The ""caliente"" shrimp & scallop nachos appetizer were super meaty and flavorful, hence, made of win.   Our server shared charming, memorized, origin stories of the specials; her effort was cute and appreciated. My date, it being Lent, and refined to boot, ordered the crab stuffed halibut entrée.  I ordered as an entrée the n27 combination platter - smoked chicken empanada, boniato and plantain croqueta, bbq'd lamb taco, shrimp skewer. Yikes, it was ok, but please be advised, do not order it as an entrée! It was mucho small and we ignored the empanada and boniato creating sad face. Luckily, I ordered as a disappointed afterthought to my ill-conceived first choice; the farm raised chicken mole verde, which to our delight came out pronto!!! We loved it. Upon leaving Murray tried to jock me, but we climbed into our cab going home happy and with leftovers. And then I woke up. Psych! Ha, actually all the above set forth were true, except I had four drinks and the car was a Camaro.

So my friend and i went to Nacional 27 (after i looked all over yelp for reviews of salsa dancing) Now our friend that was too sleepy to come with had visited here before and said it was horrible, but that was a year ago and the new reviews of this place seem promising. So we though we'd give it a try.  the place had nice atmosphere, there were quite a few people there dancing... a little more on the Caucasian side than I'm used to when going out dancing. But i did end up dancing for the rest of the time that the place was open with a few different latinos. It was fun and i would go back again. Although it was an eye opener that for both my friend and i to have a drink (2 total, one for each) it was over $20.00, so if we were to visit again and go here, again we would not be drinking anything but water.

The main dining room was booked up for the time I wanted so they told me I could reserve a table in the lounge area...I accepted the terms. When we made it there we found out it would be 8 of us instead of 7 so the staff easily accommodated us and brought an extra chair. We started out with drinks as most of us went with the mini mojito which was really good. They brought out the chips and salsa which was very good as well. The salsa has a very sweet taste to it..not too spicy. For an appetizer we went with the ceviche sampling platter which included the following: ahi tuna & watermelon, shrimp & scallop, rainbow coctel and hamachi verde...good stuff!  For my meal I decided to go with the Roast Suckling Pig Cubano which included of course the ""cubano"", coconut rice with beans, mashed cuban sweet potatoes and eggplant with tomatoes. The suckling pig was delicious as the flavor meshed very well with my taste buds. Very sweet and tender! The mashed sweet potatoes were very good as well as the rice & beans. All 8 of us had delicious looking plates and everyone enjoyed their choices The ambience of the place is great...Very latin look and feel to it. For a minute we felt like we were in Cuba or Miami. At 11PM they ususally clear out the main dining area to make room for some serious salsa dancing. The only thing we didn't understand was when the music stopped being latin influenced and they started blending in pop/old rock music into the rotation. That alone took away the whole mood of the place. We had a great outing here and definitely plan on making a return visit",0.9942,0.807,0.171,0.023,0.5769230769230769
2010-03-09,3.0,"Hello fellow Yelpers! This is my first time doin a review...I love food & I love trying new restaurants, so lastnight my husband & I decided to try Nacional since we were in the area (and, unfortunately, Topolobampo was closed :-( ). I'd say the restaurant has a nice relaxing atmosphere, with some nice latin tunes playing that weren't too loud. Now I haven't been to many small plates restaurants, but Nacional's menu seemed to be all over the place to me; I had a hard time choosing what to order! For a drink, I had the el corazon margarita...it was made with some gin, some other liquors and blood orange juice, and I had mine without the kosher salt rim. It was juicy and sweet, but upon finishing the drink I realized I didn't have a buzz at all. And I expected one because it was $14! But on to the next. Overrall, it was quite tasty. Oh yes..they offer a take-home mix of this drink for $10 (not a bad price, where else will you find blood orange juice?)  For starters we tried the bbq'd lamb mini taco, the beef tenderloin taco and the chicken skewer. The lamb taco was just ok, it tasted like fake pork to me (and I've had my share of lamb chops, shoulder etc). It was served with some guacamole, which seemed to have been old (there was some brown in the avocado chunks) The beef tenderloin, though, was great! There was the tender beef & a green pepper of some sort & a tasty cheese, yum! It was served with a tomato & cilantro (I think) little salsa. We ordered two more. The tacos are $3.95 apiece, worth every little bite :-) The chicken skewer was great! It had chicken chunks, red onion and a spicy salsa to dip it in..very tasty and tender. For dinner, we shared the pork paella. It was surprisingly flavorful! It had chicken, pork, red bell pepper, green olives, pork rind, cripsy sausage discs and an unidentified green vegetable lol. The dish was green, due to the sauce I'm sure. It was a nice sized dish. My husband enjoyed it but he says he felt like it was more of a side dish instead of a main course. It was $16.95 per person, so a little on the steep side if you've been noshing on mini tacos & ceviche.  I give Nacional 3 stars because everything tasted so good. Good seasoning, nice atmosphere. We had our coats checked (compliments of  the restaurant)   The only complaint I have is about the server. He seemed to be a little confused when asked to describe their signature drink (which I'd say was the El Corazon). Our tab was $83 without tip, kind of expensive for a regular dinner. I say go for the mini tacos..in fact, do a couple taco flights and try the skewers. Have a drink but only one or you'll run up a high tab faster than you can say Nacional 27!

The whole experience was wonderful. We shared one of those huge drinks and loved it! They put a light in the bottom of the drink as well which gives it some more appeal. The meal was great. We added the ceviche sampling to our 3 course meal and were extremely satisfied. For some reason, our main entre came before the second course and our waitress was very attentive and convinced us to send back our entrees and wait for the second course.

2010-02-21,4.0,"My boyfriend and I went here for their Restaurant Week special, since I'd been wanting to try it out for a long time!  The restaurant is big and expansive, so it doesn't feel cramped.  We were seated at a small table on what I think would later become the dance floor.  We had drinks to start with, of course, and the waiter suggested the chadwick - which is basically a pomegranate mojito with a bit of ginger-habanero syrup in it for a kick.  It was one of the most delicious mojitos I've ever had.  Totally well prepared, absolutely delicious all the way through, and I'd order it again in a minute. Their Restaurant Week pre-fixe also included a drink (score) - sparkling sangria, which was delish.  First thing to nibble on was a little bowl of house made chips and some salsa.  Yummy though that was, I wish I had waited until the guacamole came out, because it was loaded with creamy avocado deliciousness and I wanted to eat the entire bowl.  Our appetizer sampler also included Boniato and Sweet Plantain Croquetas (do not ask me what bonaito is....I could google it....but no) and Smoked Chicken Empanadas.  The empanadas were so good that they inspired us to try making them at home ourselves this week!  The croquetas were tasty also - little fried balls with a very sweet flavor.  that was a poor explanation, so you just have to try it. My entree was the farm-raised chicken mole verde, and my dinner buddy got the suckling pig cubano.  I tried both of them, and I think mine was the nommiest.  The chicken was SO TENDER, tender like I've never eaten it before unless I simmer it in something for hours.  There was just enough of the delicious sauce, and I was extremely happy.  I did not care for the side dish - winter squash with cilantro and caramelized onions - I don't know, it tasted like there was some kind of cheesy sauce on it and I just didn't dig the flavor.  I left most of it on the plate. Desserts for us were the tres leches cake, and a chocolate torte.  I couldn't eat the torte - far too rich for me, but I'm sure a chocoholic would go nuts over it.  The cake was great though - I've never had tres leches cake so I can't speak to its authenticity, but it was pretty darn delicious. We didn't stay for the dancing, perhaps another time, but we really had a nice meal and enjoyed the sexy, swanky atmosphere.  A fun opportunity for me to dress up and feel a little saucy!  I'd be happy to go back again for more food (gotta try that ceviche platter) and some dancing!",0.9972,0.814,0.172,0.014,0.6574678760393046

We then were seated at one of the large half-circle booths that surround the dance floor...very comfortanble and great view.  We were greeted by our waitress who was extremaly nice and accomodating to my gf who is allergic to gluten.  We ordered a fantastic bottle of wine (a pinot noir but can't remember details, I'm bad with that!), sipped on a glass while we munched on some declicious home made tortilla chips with some smoky-spicy fresh salsa....yum.  We then finally decided what we wanted....menu has a great variety, small plates as well as entrees and some fantastic appetizers. We started off with probably my favorite thing of the whole evening...the fundido-OMG!! seriously spectacular.  Fresh corn mixed with melted spanish cheeses and an amazing what tasted like wine-based sauce...we coudln't pinpoint what exactly the sauce was made up of, but wow, delicious...this is also served with tortilla  chips.to  die for! We then split the salmon and ahi tuna ceviche with avocado and spicy tomato sauce, lime juice..YUM...., a skewer of jumbo shrimp in a creole-spice, as well as another salmon small plate that was DECLICIOUS! And, the waitress timed it out absolutely perfectly..with time to relax in between each one.  We were gonna go for dessert, but were really full at this point....can't wait to go back because there were some fantastic looking ones on the menu.

Decor-wise, Nacional 27 has the feel of a hip urban lounge.   Here is what we ordered: 1. Appetizer sampler - Included lamb tacos, empanadas, grilled shrimp, and potato croquettes.  None of the 4 really stood out.  The lamb tacos were very gamey, the empanadas doughy. 2. Ceviche sampler - Included an assortment of 4 different ceviches.  This was the most memorable dish of the night.  I especially enjoyed the shellfish one, as well as the one with the watermelon relish.  Who knew salted watermelon could be so tasty. 3.Paella - Oddly enough they insist on the whole table ordering it (it is not as if it were a buffet).  We got the seafood and the pork versions.  What came out though was not paella.  Jambalaya, risotto or porridge might have been more appropriate names, given that they were not served in traditional paella pans, and there was still quite a bit of liquid.  The rice itself tasted a bit one-dimensional, as if it were cooked in salted water as opposed to stock.   Despite 2 out of 3 dishes being letdowns, I would not write-off Nacional 27.  The ceviche was absolutely delicious, and there are so many entree options that look very appetizing.  After all, one of the best things about Latin American cuisine is its comfort factor.  Just make sure to avoid the paella.",0.979,0.878,0.102,0.02,0.5178927203065133

Our waitress was courteous and sincere.  She was fairly attentive and brought my drink promptly.  I ordered a coconut-pineapple mojito.  It was very tasty, but not very strong.  Also, while the glass was large, there was so much fruit muddled in it that there was hardly any drink.  If we go back I would like to try the giant sangria.  They have a variety of flavors (like sparkling and guava) that sound delicious. For appetizer we ordered the N-27 combo - shrimp, chicken empanada, croquettas, and pork taco.  The shrimp adobado was the best thing on the plate.  The taco had sauce on it that totally overseasoned it.  The pork is so tasty that they sort of killed it by drowning it in other flavors.  The empanada was pretty subpar if you've tasted other empanadas.   For dinner, my hubby ordered the pork special - pork stuffed with creamed spinach served with a side of creamed spinach.  He said it was excellent, though the side of creamed spinach was overkill.  Would have been better served with another side.  I love roast pork, so I ordered their roast suckling pig.  It was served with sides of coconut rice (delicious) and mashed sweet potato (also tasty).  The pork was again killed by being drowned in sauce.  I love roast pork (LOVE) - it's always so tender and delicious.  I picked at the pork to try to get to parts where I could actually taste the meat.  I would definitely order it again, but dry. For dessert: grand marnier flourless chocolate cake - it was ok.  The dulce de leche tasted like whipped cream.  Disappointing.  We also ordered banana ice cream.  It was very good and served in a double bowl on ice so that it wouldn't melt.  It was a nice touch. Overall, I thought the food was okay.  I would go back, but I don't think I will be craving it.  Upon return I would stick with our take-out standby: paella varieties.  Even though the minimum order is for 2 people, it's okay to order extra because it's nice to have as leftovers.",0.998,0.75,0.2,0.049,0.5199893654732366

You could have told be that at the beginning so I would have been prepared to wait. Especially since you held a 20 buck deposit on my reservation.  So we were finally seated and enjoyed a wonderful meal with great service from our server in what I though was a great location. My mood didn't turn until the dancing started. I guess because we were seated near the dance floor the edge of our table turned into a waiting station for everyone drinks.  Nacional you lost your second star when I had to get up from my table  to hand some guys drink back to him because I was still dining.  Overall Nacional 27 I will return and enjoy your great food and service but I won't make reservations. I will walk over around 4 o'clock request a table for later, go shopping and come back later to get a table away from the dance floor.",0.9962,0.765,0.209,0.026,0.5222222222222223

I came here one night b/c I have heard about their ultra cheap $20.10 3-course dinner, and also, my bf had a gift certificate for $50 to LEY restaurants. So N27 was screaming at me.

Okay, whatever, I'll have a drink. She handed us those TGIF glowing disks. Finally after 10mins, she calls us back. She goes, oh your table will be almost ready, did you pay up? Of course we did retard! We saw you buzzing us over so we paid the bill! So there we were, awkwardly waiting again. After another 2 minutes, we got seated. WORST SEATING SYSTEM IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE. On to the food. The food was surprisingly delicious. We ordered the Tapas tasting, ceviche, suckling pig, chicken mole, and for dessert we had the churros and icecream. Everything was perfectly seasoned and tasted delicious.

Nonetheless, it was fucking delicious so we just swallowed it without asking questions. Many say the cocktails are pretty extraordinary, but I don't have anything to rave about.

I was upset with her but once he took my hand to the dance floor I forgave her :) Jose if you are out there you are an amazing dancer and gentleman. The music was awesome with a nice mix of salsa, merengue, bachata, reggaeton, and top 40s. If it weren't for the lactic acid build up in my thighs I'd of been dancing the whole night. You really work up a sweat on the dance floor, like the kind of sweat that makes it so that you need a team to get your skinny jeans off.

The decor is very cool, fun looking bar, and entertaining music sets the mood for the Latin theme. We sat down and were greeted pretty promptly by our server.

No ""welcome, let me tell you about the specials"" or ""here's some suggestions"", etc. She even forgot to ask us if we wanted to order drinks. The rest of the service was very poor. We started with a variety of appetizers that all had great presentation, but terrible execution. We didn't think much of the tiny tacos or croquetas. The Ahi Tuna and Watermelon Ceviche was the highlight of the meal.....but the Rainbow coctel was very fishy, and we even thought the fish might have been bad since it smelled so terrible. The roasted tomato and tortilla soup was the worst thing I have ever had. My friend order it, and offered everyone to taste how bad and tasteless it was. Truly bad. The rest of the entrees were disappointing, and I felt robbed after spending about $50 bucks a head for a very poor dinner with service to match. I will stick to Carnivale or Frontera.

Then our server, whose name I forget (sorry!) told us right off the bat he was just out of training, but catered to us as though he was an old pro.   He started us off with some bread crisps and an amuse bouché of chorizo sausage.  We then ordered off the Yelp  Eats menu, which consisted of: THE SIGNATURE PLATTER (appetizer) Smoked Chicken Empanada * Boniato and Plantain Croqueta * BBQ'd Lamb Tiny Taco * Shrimp Adobado Skewer.  The Croqueta was the clear winner in this line up.   I had Spiced Seafood Zarzuela as an entree which was Shrimp, Mussels, & Bass in a spicy tomato broth and a Piquillo Pepper Toast alongside. A nice medley of flavours - excellently prepared seafood. Andy M ordered the Grilled Smoked Pork Tenderloin Adobado that was served alongside a Corn-Purple Potato-Smoked Bacon Hash and Adobado Salsa.  He gave me a bite of the pork and it was wonderful. For the dessert, we both chose the Coconut Crème Brûlée.  But, it was awful!  We were so disappointed.  Instead of this warm, silky goodness trapped under a hard sugar coat, we got this heavy, eggy custard under the sugar shell that wasnt even that warm!  We told our server how disappointed we were, and we thought it was very nice he offered to replace them with something else, but we declined.  Suddenly this other guy comes out and places two new desserts on the table!  I thought he had made a mistake and tried to tell him, but then we found out the chef had made us all new dishes! And these were so, so much better - we were given: ""Churros"" with Trés Leches Ice Cream with Cinammon Doughnuts, Dulce de Leche, Candied Brazil Nuts and a Sour Cherry ice cream with cherry jam, whipped cream and flourless chocolate cake.  Man was that yummy!

The weekends are much better. Bit of a slow start, gets crowed up fast.  People tend to come in groups, sometimes making it hard to find dance partners.

We were seated at a table suited for 6, but there were 9 of us.  We were all basically touching elbows and there was no room for the food that the waiters had to shovel the food on our plates in order to bring out the next course/dish.  This was ridiculous. Now moving on to the horrible service and pea sized amounts of food.  I think they thought we were children as my little brother might have been full, but not adults, and especially not full grown, 6 foot 4 men.  We first had the barbequed steak skewers, although tasty, were only served 4 pieces per a table of 9.  Same went for the grouper and the suckling pig, which we were charged an additional $5 per person.  The seafood paella smelled and tasted like it came out of the garbage, but the sides itself were pretty good-mashed potatoes, corn, etc.  The salad was overly salted-who salts salads anyways???  The only saving grace was dessert-the creamy semi-flan dish was fantastic as was the chocolate cake and sorbets.  I did forget to mention the amuse which was a shot of pineapple and mint that really did cleanse the palate well.

2009-10-22,5.0,"I had a 5-star experience for sure. But I go to restaurants for food. If you go for ambience then maybe it'd be a little lower (but then again I went on a Tuesday night). Drinks: I had the passion colada mojito. Delicious. And for $11 at a nice place that turns into a nightclub I was expecting a tiny cocktail but instead got a rather large drink. Later I had the mini mojito, which was equally phenomenal. My husband and I each tried a grilled beef tenderloin taco. They're only about 2 bites of food, but they were very good bites. The spicy tomatillo salsa on them was very good. Then we had the shrimp and scallop ceviche. Not much to say other than ""delicious"" again, although I will add that it was on par with the ceviche we were enjoying in Belize a few months ago. My husband ordered the roast suckling pig. I only had a few bites but like everything else we had tried it was great. It was served with caramelized onion mashed cuban sweet potatoes which were phenomenal, and coconut rice that was again just like the coconut rice we ate (and loved!) almost every day we were in Belize. I ordered the beef tenderloin medallions, and chose to have them crusted for an extra couple of bucks. 3 pieces of perfectly cooked medium rare beef. One topped with chimichurri (a sort of garlic, cilantro, citrusy deliciousness), one with blue cheese, and the third with a truffle crust. All of them were fantastic but the truffle piece was quite possibly the single best thing I've ever eaten in my life. My mouth is watering thinking about it. Overall it might be a pricey night out that you can't afford to do all that often, but the portions for the main dishes were huge, and everything we ordered was just incredible.",0.9956,0.818,0.17,0.012,0.5742879818594103

But let's concentrate on the elements that Nacional 27 CAN control: creative cocktails, a menu full of fresh Latin favorites, gorgeous insides and skilled service. They do all of the above and then some. Food: we started with the shrimp and scallop ceviche. Served with sweet peppers, avocado and a nice citrus bite over ice. Delightful! For my main, I went with my gut and ordered the center cut ahi with fire roasted corn, a mound of avocado, and cilantro salsa. All of the flavors came together beautifully. To do this dish well, the tuna has to be fresh and seared just perfectly (yes and yes!). Seriously, I think this is my new electric chair meal. Cocktails: try a mojito (their signature cocktail), pisco sour or margarita. I had a classic michelada with a twist: Goose Island's 312 Urban Wheat beer with ancho-chipotle lime, passion, kosher salt, and cracked pepper. Not a drink for the faint of heart! A little hot, a little spicy... maybe not the ideal pairing with my ahi but I did enjoy it. I would have tried a mojito but this particular night I was attempting to stay somewhat dignified (read: sober).

I'll admit I do have one of the more discerning palates in my circle, but I was really impressed with all the offerings. Like Anne S. said, they kept refreshing the empty chafing dishes which was awesome. I never knew I'd love a veggie paella, but it was prolly the highlight of food side of my meal. Our berry mojitos were also perfectly balanced. I hate sweet drinks so I was a little cautious, but I enjoyed every drop.  One note: Please leave a decent tip on your buffet bill. Due to our insanely cheap tab ($13 for four people... we had a round of free mojitos due to some offer I'd found on teh interwebz), and my prior serving experience, I insisted we fork over $7 each. There's no reason our server should've been so shocked to get a $15 tip for a four-top. But she was. Granted, that may be a bit more generous than is really *necessary*, but with the savings we'd received, it only felt right.

I have to say, I have had ALOT of sangria and I think that the sangria at Nacional is by far the BEST sangria I have ever had!  It's not too sweet, very refreshing, and the sparking sangra is very crisp and bubbly.  Hmm just writing about it makes me want to go back and have another few pitchers!  All of the boys in our group went with the suckling pig, which was bascially pulled pork with different sides.  I had a bite and it was very juicy and tender..the only complaint if any I would have, is that I feel like the portion size was not enough for the boys.  I order the seared tuna, our waitress suggested that I order it light on the lime sauce..I definitely would pass that suggestion on! I loved the avocado salsa is very limey but ordering it light on the lime sauce gave it a sizable lime kick but it wasn't too overwhelming.  I tasted my friend's salmon and skirt steak, and those were both excellent.  I kinda wished I had ordered the skirt steak!  My tuna seemed boring compared to that.  I remember last time we were here, we started with the delicious pumpkin goat cheese croquettes, I had wanted to order some this time around but wanted to save more room for my entree.  Nacional 27 is a fun place for a dates and with friends, I hope I get to come back here soon!  I hear that sangria calling my name!",0.9965,0.804,0.18,0.015,0.4896520146520146

My husband and I arrived early on Friday and got a mojito at the bar while we waited for our friends to arrive.  My husband thought his mojito was better than the one we had in Costa Rica.  I beg to differ though.  Although it was a close second in my opinion.  Red Sangria was also excellent. As our friends arrived, we wanted a table outside, but it seemed as though there weren't tables big enough to accommodate 4 people - only for 2 people.  We were kind of disappointed since it was such a nice evening outside.  But the hostess ""cheesily"" (is that a word) said that she'd give us one of her BEST booths inside.  Ok whatever chick.  The decor is fairly plain with lots of whites going on.  I think of a Latin/Cuban place as decorated with lots of color. We started off with the ceviche sampler.  All were magnificent, but I am a huge ceviche fan.  We also got the guacamole and chips.  I was disappointed in that because it was like 1/2 cup of guacamole for $9.  The table gets chips and salsa anyway, I'd pass on that next time.  Since we filled up on that - we orders some tapas.  They were good for the most part...but again, not outstanding. Now for the service.  I think this guy had like 6-7 tables by the time we left.  When we first got there, he didn't have as many tables but as the night went on we saw him less and less.  It was really frustrating because we were trying to leave to see a concert.  Also, when we ordered the tapas he didn't write anything down.  I joked with him saying are you sure you're going to remember all of that?  Sure enough he messed up my husband's order and forgot about our friends order.  Also, 3 different bus boys came over to the table asked us if we were done with our ceviche dish when there was still food left in the dish.  And they took my fork with two of my dishes.   grrrrr.  I know they are doing their job but it was just kind of annoying.

It was good, but call me a traditionalist - I much preferred the shrimp and scallop.   Had the carne asada, which was listed on the menu as ""gaucho grilled skirt steak.""  It was served perfectly rare, with a nice carmelized crust.  It was topped with a poblano sauce that had the perfect amount of heat to compliment the tender meat.  It had a side of crispy potatoes that they called Costa Rican style.  These were nicely seasoned and perfectly prepared.  A really lovely dish! I also got to taste a bite of the Cubano roast suckling pig.  This incredibly tender pork was covered in a delightful ancho chili sauce that had a hint of pineapple in it.  The sweetnesses blended nicely with the spice level.  It had a bunch of sides included that I did not sample but they were reported as very good by my dining companion.  They were a carmelized onion sweet potato mash, spicy eggplant, coconut rice, black beans, and chicarrones.   As dinner was wrapping up it became clear that this is very much a night spot and we found out that dancing was going to be starting a bit later.  We could stay though as we had to get to a reception.  But it looked like it would be a very fun evening to combine the drinks, delicious food, and dancing.   Great spot!  I wonder if they would be willing to open up in Vancouver?!?!?!!!  Chicago is advertising everywhere that it is bidding on the Olympics.  Vancouver already is having the Olympics - so Nacional 27, why don't you just move now?!?!?!?!   (Ok, that was my failed attempt to get this type of food into the Vancouver market - a guy can dream!)",0.9983,0.775,0.213,0.012,0.6243589743589745

The drinks were probably the best that I had my entire time in Chicago. They were a bit fruity (but not necessarily in a girly way) and very refreshing. The atmosphere was very cool, and since we came here on a Thursday night, it was not at all crowded. Of course, the service was among the worst I've ever experienced anywhere. First, the waitress checked our ID's (which we're not really all that used to anyway, but fine). But she didn't just check them, she took them to the back and didn't come back for like 10 minutes. Then once she finally did come back (what the hell was she doing in the back anyway?), she proceeded to quiz each of us about the information on the ID's to make sure that they weren't fake. Then it took her another 15 minutes or so to finally get our drinks to us. All in all, it was a half hour that none of us will ever get back.

2009-07-16,5.0,"I have been back several times and my experience there has been generally satisfactory.  Besides the lamb tacos and ceviche, I haven't been much of a fan of the appetizers.  However, I have had hit estatica level with the rack of lamb, ahi tuna, huachinango, and cubano.   I can go on and on, but the reason I'm writing this review is to put the word out about Adam Seger's cocktail class.  It runs every third thursday of the month.  The hour long class costs $20 but really, you get much more out of the class than the $20 you put in.  You get 2 full cocktails made by the man himself.  About every 10 minutes, servers come by with some nibbles.  Not only do you get to watch him closely on how he makes the two drinks, but depending on the drink, you can muddle your own drinks.  All of this happens while he educates you on where the restaurant gets its ingredients, the history of the spirits, and how each added ingredient balances each other.   I myself was a bartender back in college.  Although it was ages ago when cosmos and apple-tinis were the ""da bomb"".  And I even try to keep up with current cocktail trends.  In spite of that, I learned quite a few things.  For example, I learned about the stevia plant and how it can be harnessed to make a natural sweetener.  I believe it's entering the main stream market now with commercial drinks.    The only slight inaccuracy I found with his discourse was when he said yuzu was a Japanese citrus fruit, but it originated in China.  But, I guess you can consider it a Japanese fruit because we use it in many food recipes.   Anyway, at the end of all this, I got to take home printed recipes for the Rhubarb-yuzu gimlet and a strawberry-rhubarb-basil-balsamic mojito.  These recipes can definitely make for a entertaining cocktail party! *Side note*- I couldn't make it to my first cocktail class because I had to help a friend purchase a car.  I called in the next day, to see if I could at least get a copy of the recipes.  Adam was nice enough let me schedule for another class.  GREAT SERVICE!",0.986,0.891,0.097,0.012,0.38091397849462366

It had excellent flavor and top quality ingredients, but was a bit runny compared to the paella I have had in the past at other establishments. But the taste more than compensated! My husband had the bbq skirt steak and he, of course, shared a couple of mouthwatering bites with me.  Dessert was good, but not great which was surprising given rest of the experience. I had the rum cake. It was tasty, but somewhat plain. My husband had the churros. Again, they were good, but odd. They were little disks topped with ice cream.

If you like to dine out during the week, they have some great specials.  The Wine-Down Wednesday is a five course tasting menu with wine pairings for under $50 a person.  They often have adventurous choices such as sweatbreads or pork cheeks on the tasting menu but they're always delicious.  Tapas Tuesday is a great way to sample some appetizers with your meal and for early diners, the late latin lunch is one of the cheapest meals (at least with two drinks included) you can get at a fancy sit-down place in the Chicago Restaurant district.",0.9929,0.79,0.195,0.015,0.5301111111111111

Oh how nice, I thought,  A table for two in the back, which will be a little quieter.  Not so.  I love Latin music, food and ambiance...and well, I got two out of the three.  We waited 10 minutes for the bus boy to come over with water, while we intermittently silently reviewed our menus and then shouted to one another about how our days were and what looked tasty. Twenty (veinte) minutes later? No server.  Nada.  Just mind-numbing thumping.  Granted, it's Cinco de Mayo so one expects the crowds.  But no one?  We made the executive decision to get up and just leave. And no one stopped us along the way, either!  Terrible. In an effort to torture myself, I brought some clients to N27 a few weeks ago, determined to actually EAT this time.  I arrived on time for our reservation and was asked to sit at the bar for 10 minutes.  There were 6 of us, so luckily we secured a table to chat and wait.  In true form...no server. For 10 minutes! Then a waitress came over and asked us if we wanted drinks.  I asked if we could switch the bar bill over to the table, to which I was told no.  In return, I politely asked her to check into how long it would be then, as one is wise to the game of making people wait to jack up the bar bill.  Never saw her again and the maitre'd all but disguised herself when walking by. I was steaming, and getting off my chair to have a chat with her when ANOTHER server came over with a complimentary round of white sangria (which was tasty).  However, with visions of empanadas and pork loin dancing in my head, I needed to find out when we were going to eat!  It was another minute or two, and we were seated. The food, after being practically the Holy Grail, was quite tasty.  We all shared the sampler app, with shrimp skewers, potato ""poppers"" and empanadas, which were all delightful.  I did not wind up with the pork loin, as the steak with blue cheese crust sounded divine, which it was.  Five of six of us enjoyed our meals - the sixth ordered the chicken dish, which was, regretably, ordinary and bland.  But the others - scrumptious! So, despite the food really being stellar, actually getting TO it proved difficult more than once, so it isn't worth the effort until they up their service policies and honor reservations as one should.",0.9883,0.845,0.109,0.045,0.4847222222222221

I forget what the name is, but its ahi tuna and melon..... mmmm delicious.  I also enjoyed the boniato and plantain croquetas.  For my main course I had the beef tenderloin ""medallions"", which is basically three beef tenderloins all draped in unique sauces and seasonings.  The entre was awfully enjoyable.  As for dessert; plantains were on the docket.

My date obsessed over the oyster shooters with the extra citrus vodka included.  Both croqueta flavors are tasty and light, but the empanadas were greasy and heavy.  Vegetarian options for the main course were limited, so I stuck to an assortment of appetizers and the fresh green salad.  Previous reviews are spot on- the price seems a little high considering the quantity and the quality of the food, and I am not opposed to paying for things that are worth it. Tuesday nights offer a tapas tasting and free salsa lessons early in the evening.  If you come to eat, you must stay and dance!  (And drink!)  The music and the center-stage dancefloor are the best parts of Nacional 27 besides the authentic Latin American cocktails.",0.929,0.829,0.11,0.061,0.42155462184873954

The sangria is good (a little on the sweet side; the $27 pitcher serves 6 glasses), and the food is ok but very small portions.  The appetizer sampler is literally 4 pieces of fried foods for $11 that are placed at the corners of a very large square plate, psychologically making you think you should order more food.  The BBQ pork tenderloin is probably 8 oz of meat for $20.  The mashed Cuban sweet potatoes with caramelized onions is delicious!   On Tuesdays, they have $9.95/pp tapas plates, which is about 4 items plus ceviche.  The items vary every week, but it's 4 items from the ""small plates"" menu.  Again, none are crazy good.  Our items were: beef tenderloin skewer (2 cubes of meat), shrimp skewer (2 large shrimps), 1 mushroom empanada (dry), 1 pumpkin & goat cheese croqueta (interesting), and about 1/2 a cup of hamachi ceviche (pretty good).

From the onset, the waiter, Jonathan, was so...prick-y.  Just the tone of his voice and his brusqueness.  I don't drink alcohol often, but I wanted to try a sangria.  Instead of offering a suggestion--ya know, just doing the whole job bit--he just kind of stands there, annoyed, when I'm trying to choose between two different sangrias.  They're fuh-reaking $9!!!  Help me out here!  Then he just mentions the red one as being a ""classic"" just so I stop inconveniencing him. The whole dinner just feels like he HAS to come up to us, and dammit, we're just one big inconvenience.  But he does manage to chat it up with the table of 3 behind us for awhile (I guess he thought he'd get a better tip from them).  He does the bare minimum for such an expensive place, and at one point, while he's talking, looks away at all the distractions in front of him, while he's still talking.  And then darts off...it was a weird moment.

The cocktails are incredible, true.  Try the Chadwick, which was renamed from the more-descriptive but somewhat less masculine pomegranate ginger mojito about a year ago.  But don't get the absinthe rinse, because it makes the drink taste strongly of absinthe, which has a strong licorice flavor.  (I didn't know this before I ordered the rinse the first, and only, time.)  The mango habanero martini is my wife's favorite and is also great. Dinner always starts with an amuse bouche for each guest and two signature breads and sauces.  The best dinners at Nacional tend to be those where you let the chef make the most decisions, in particular the chef's tasting, a five-course dinner that changes regularly.  Wine/cocktail pairings are also available for every course with the chef's tasting, but they cost extra.  On Wednesdays, if you get the chef's tasting, each course comes with the wine or cocktail pairing for free, which is why Wednesday is the best day to visit (unless you're there for salsa dancing, and then it's the weekend).",0.9932,0.826,0.174,0.0,0.5433455433455434

We started out with drinks--my friend got a mojito, which she said was okay, and I got a caipirinha, which I thought was pretty good. Frankly, the entire appetizer menu looked delicious to me, but I ended up getting pumpkin and goat cheese croquetas (tasty, although only three fairly small balls) and my friend got the smoked chicken empanadas (tiny, but delicious!). I was a little annoyed that the busboy snatched my plate away before I could eat all the tasty pepitos that were garnishing my croquetas, but I survived. Entrees were next. My friend got the sirloin steak with chimichurri sauce, and I ordered the grilled smoked pork tenderloin adobado. She said her steak was good, probably in third place on her favorite steak list, but I have to tell you--this was my all-time favorite pork dish ever that did not include bacon. It was unbelievably good. None of the flavors was overwhelming--it was smoky, slightly sweet, and had just enough heat that I could feel it afterward but it wasn't overly spicy. And it was so tender and moist. It was good enough that I will probably never order any other entree there. And I ate the whole thing, which is fairly unusual for me. And as if that weren't enough, I had seen on their online menu that they offered ""guava three ways"": as a cake, ice cream, and sauce. But sadly that was not on the dessert menu this evening. What was on the menu was champurrado: home-made hot chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon & coffee. Best hot chocolate EVER. And it came in this little teapot, and a tiny little espresso cup, and they gave you enough for like four little cups. Sooooo good. I am so going back there, even without gift certificates.

I've been twice, once on a Friday night and once on a Tuesday night, and the difference was as you might expect: everything was a little quieter on Tuesday, but the service was just a little better, too, so as long as you don't plan on dancing, you're not really missing out. A dance club and a very nice restaurant? It can be done! The vibe is more ""1920s Miami"" than anything else, and you may feel as though you've been transported back in time when you walk in. There's a nice mix of latin flavors on the menu, and I think the ""fusion"" label duly applies, though dishes some are more traditional than others. My table had samples of this and that, including four outstanding ceviches and probably the entire selection of steaks. Really, I don't think the steaks could have been much better, nor could the ceviches have been any more inventive. Truly outstanding all around. And, of course, dessert and coffee succeeded at ending the meal nicely; everybody seems to order ""cuatro chocolates"" which is both heavy on the chocolate and, indeed, infused with a latin flavor that suitably bookends the end of an outstanding meal.

We tried it again last Saturday with some friends and things have changed a bit, but for the most part, it's just as nice a place.   We started out with our yummy drinks - Mo-healthy-ito for me (the acai, rosemary and mint made it a tastebud tickkler).  Hubby got the limey drink we can't remember the name of, but it was refreshing! We ordered the ceviche sampling platter and were not disappointed in the choices.  My favorite was the Ahi Tuna & Watermelon, although there was some salmon in there too.  All five samples were light and citrusy - perfect! Then I ordered the chicken mole with winter squash and carmelized onions.  I don't usually order chicken in a restaurant, but it sounded interesting.  It was just enough and the green mole sauce gave it a tang.  I was all over the squash and onions - buttery flavor! Hubby got the Slow Roasted Gunthorp Farms Pork ""Cubano"" with coconut and black bean rice.  He was in pig-heaven! Dessert was the cuatro chocolates.  A chocolate cookie on top of rich chocolate ice cream on top of a scoop of chocolate mousse on top of a round of flourless chocolate cake accompanied by a small chocolate shake.  For the dark chocolate hound, it was everything and more!  We shared this one because it was so rich. Prices were what you'd expect $$$ and the service was prompt and friendly. The only negative thing I can say is that THE MUSIC WAS TOO LOUD in the dining room.  We had to almost shout to talk to each other and the server had to come around to each side of the table to let us know what the specials were.   The music was actually softer in the bar....seems a bit backward to me.

We really wanted the snapper, but it was missing from the menu when we got to Nacional 27. Also, the prices are higher than on the website menu. It makes me angry when restaurants don't update the prices their website, I feel like I have been lied to when I get there and pay more than expected.  Is that the bait and switch? Regardless, we enjoyed our food, nothing mind blowing but good. We had the empanadas which were probably the highlight of the meal. For our entrees the bf had the Pacific Blue Nose Grouper with green rice salsa/cilantro sauce. It was good, but over salted. I had the beef tenderloin medallions which were overcooked but the meat was very tender. So tender, in fact, that I could cut it with a butter knife (they didn't give me a steak knife). The red wine reduction sauce was ok, not lick your plate good as I had hoped.  Service was friendly, but a little slow. It is hard to eat spicy food when your water glass is empty.

2008-10-26,2.0,"I'm not too sure why this place has gotten so many high reviews....maybe I just had bad luck. Me and my GF went here last night for dinner...a date night since we don't get to do those as often as we'd like.  She asked me to pick out a restaurant that we have not been to before.  She said...keep it in the $$ range. So I went looking online and Nacional 27 caught my attention. I failed to look at the $ signage when I spouted off details about the restaurant. She was totally down, then I realized it was a $$$. So I told her and she was like, whatever, it sounds amazing lets do it. So we made our way to the restaurant, we were really early on accident. An hour early. We asked if anything was available to sear earlier. The hostess said they were running a little behind but she should be able to seat us closer to 8, than 815(our original reservation) So we went and had a drink across the street at the green door. (which was an excellent choice) An hour had passed, we made our way back around 8 pm. Got there and the host said ""we are still seating our 745 reservations but you're the first 815""..ok no big deal. We went and had another cocktail at the Nacional 27 bar...The bartender was really nice, and made us two drinks that were perfect. The only problem was that it was now about 830.  It's not that big of a deal, but when you tell someone you can seat them at 8, they have a reservation at 815, and you don't seat them till 830...You should inform the guests of what is going on. We got none of that.  Im not sure why, this place has had such rave reviews. So we finally get a seat, in the middle of the dining room at a nice table. Our waitress comes to the table, she seems very nice, first impressions are not always true. So we look through the menu and get excited about all the different eclectic things.  We decide what we want appetizer wise. The waitress takes our drinks and app order. We ordered the Ceviche app sampler, the guac and a ""bourbon"" and coke and Some cocktail they have.   Then the waitress disappears. We are enjoying our time and then we start to realize that its been a long time. We get an amuse bouge(spell check on that) which is really nice, but we still don't have our drinks.  She finally comes back with our drinks, My gf gets her cocktail and I get a jack and coke.  I ordered a bourbon and coke...there is a difference. Im usually not picky but going to a restaurant that is this expensive and supposedly has a famous mixologist working there...the waitress should know the difference. Having worked in the industry, it's something you should know. So I bite the bullet and drink the jack even though I wanted Jim. So time is passing now, and we start to wonder where our food is.  We look around and see people who have sat after us, with drinks and apps already consuming.  We some chip bowl, which is their version of bread, with some sauces...which were actually really good.  A food runner comes to our table with an app, we think its ours. Nope, wrong table. That was about 45 minutes after we have sat down.  An hour after we sat down, we finally got our first app. The ceviche. We finish the ceviche and wonder, where is the guacamole we ordered. Another 30 minutes lapse and our guac comes. The ceviche was really good....the guac medicore at best. Then the soup comes, we split the soup. And they actually split it for us which was nice.  It was too spicy for my gf, which was no big deal. But before asking my gf if she wants something else, they just brought black bean soup out. Which isn't spicy, and was a nice gesture, but the gf hates beans of any sort. Nice attempt, poor execution. It's about 945 and our main entrees haven't even arrives. We sat about 830, and we are pretty hungry. Not to mention that everything has taken an extremely long time.  People who sat down after us, and right before us have already left the place and gone on to their respective bars. We are still in the middle of the restaurant, waiting for our entrees. Tables around us are empty, they are preparing for their late night festivities.  We finally get our entrees and sides. My GF ordered rare tuna and it came out more medium tuna.  I got the fillet and it was cooked pretty well. The food wasn't horrible, but after waiting so long, I wasn't too hungry anymore. We had some of our meal, it wasn't the best, but if the service was better  our experience might has been different.  it was 1015 and we were ready to leave. I asked for a box 3 times and finally got one. We got the bill and paid. I'm not too sure why we got crappy service. Our waitress would disappear at times on end.  It might have been because we were young, younger than most the crowd in there. But you should never judge guest like that. We both worked in the industry and all the waitress had to do was give us good service, not great service, and she was guaranteed 20%.

Everything was amazing although the cerviche was not quite what I had envisioned when they had said watermelon and tuna. For our main course we had the cumin crusted fish, pork cubano and the steak. From the moment my friend got her steak I was eyeing it with envy. When she gave me a bite it was the best steak I have had in a long time. My pork and the husbands fish were equally good. Although stuffed decided to order Venezualan Brownies. Ugh! More cream but very little brownie. Dont think I would order dessert there again. *sigh* but that steak...

2008-08-04,4.0,"More tasty eats for me! We tried all sorts of delightful dishes. Mr. Hubby got the $30 Late Latin lunch(5:30-6:15PM) which comes with two glasses of sangria. Since he doesn't like sangria, I got to have it instead. I went for a variety of tapas. + The appetizer: The smoked chicken empanadas were delicious. The smoke chicken was very flavorful and went perfectly with the creamy guacamole. + The entree: The skirt steak entree was a very generous portion. The meat was cooked a perfect medium rare, a little on the rare side, but that's how I like it. The avocado and pico de gallo that came with were awesome.  + The ceviches: I had the hamachi mojito ceviche which unfortunately was fishy tasting and didn't have enough acid. However, the shrimp and scallop ceviche was awesome. The portions are pretty good though. + The tapas: The beef tenderloin skewer was flavorful and tender. The flight of croquettas were wonderful. I liked all three kinds. The plate comes with two of each kind. Each of them were flavorful and creamy.  + The dessert: Cuatro chocolate is for SERIOUS chocolate lovers. The chocolate sorbet was my favorite. The flavor is deep, rich, and not too sweet. The chocolate pudding was more like a flourless chocolate cake. The shake that came with was interesting.  + The drinks: My first sangria was passion fruit and the second one was the red. I didn't really like the red that much but the passion fruit one was so good. Hubby's caipirinha martini was perfect.  We were absolutely stuffed. I highly recommend coming early for the Late Latin lunch. It's not crowded and the deal is awesome. It comes with two glasses of sangria. I would suggest that the other person order tapas off of the menu so there is more variety and everyone can share. I love to share! I ordered 2 ceviches, 1 beef skewer, and the croquettas flight.

The second time, I actually went to dance with some friends.  Huge (but crowded) dance floor with great salsa music.  The diversity of the crowd was astounding - old, young, and of all different races.

My friends and I went for the $25 price fix and we all pretty much rolled out of the restaurant because we were so full!! The bread and butter/dips are delicious, but a little crumbly. It was kind of interesting to watch people eat it! Also they have an amazing wine selection. They brought out a few random appetizers that were fabulous. Maybe one was an octopus dish and the other was a muscle that was extremely snazzy looking. Even my picky friend thought they were tasty.  I had the Hearts of Palm salad to start. It was delicious, and very rich. It was an interesting blend of avocado, olives and papaya. For entrée I had the Grilled Tasmanian Salmon... perfect. It was a little oniony, but delicious. My friend had the Baja Catch of the Day. The menu said it had a passion fruit butter sauce and I had no idea it would taste sooooo good!! She loved it, too.  The best part (or maybe the worst for my food coma) was the dessert. As a chocolate lover, I was thrilled to see the Cuatro Chocolates. I read ""Chocolate Cake, Sorbet, Pudding & Shake"" on the menu and was immediately sold. Well, I can tell you this was the richest, most decedent chocolate dessertI have ever had. I did that annoying, ""Mmmm this is so good"" thing after trying each part of the dessert. It couldn't finish it, but I tried.  The service was also great. The music was a little loud so it was hard to hear our server, but my water glass was always full and the wine kept coming.",0.9981,0.683,0.273,0.044,0.638963963963964

First off, I was reading other people's experiences from the special menu and was excited to try the ceviche sampler for the app. Turns out, our waiter tells us we had to choose only one. (When did that change?) That was disappointing. Although it was a huge dish, it was a lot of raw tuna. I ordered the special catch of the day, Bass, which was pretty tasty. For the dessert, I got the flan which was not to my liking. My dining companions' desserts were not that great either. Maybe we were just so full by that time and so annoyed because the service was so slow. It was a Tuesday night and it wasn't that busy, but everything took forever! We really liked our waiter at first but then barely saw him the rest of the night. After we finished our entrees, the dishes still sat in front of us for a good 15 minutes before they cleared them and then brought over the dessert choices. Seriously, a dinner on a Tuesday night should not take over 2 hours, even if we did have a good time chatting away. One more thing that I thought was a bit tacky... was that they gave us a clear plastic bag to take our leftovers home in. It looked like a produce bag, but was a recycled one so a little better quality. But still, for a restaurant like that they should think about presentation. One good thing, though... the mojitos were really good. I remember that from last time, too. Go for the drinks!",0.9928,0.752,0.193,0.055,0.550410610894482

I started with the Signature Platter, 4 of their top selling appetizers - all I can say is that it was DELICIOUS.  Then I had the Pacific Blue Nose ""Huachinango"", fabulously prepared and served over rice with a cilantro puree sauce.  For desert I had the Navan Flan, although this did not impress me at the first bite, it grew on  me with every subsequent mouthful. About the only ""not 5 star"" comment I have is the Caipirihnia, I have never had one that came close the way they make these drinks in Rio.  Nacional 27 was closer, actually using the Brazilian sugar cane rum - but they add citrus vodka to it, this is the downfall of this drink.",0.8933,0.878,0.111,0.01,0.5170329670329669

A seating policy is understandable if a place is packed, but we were there very early at 6:30 and one of our friends was late and they refused to seat us. They kept coming around to ask us for drinks and of course right when we order drinks our friend shows up so we have to stand there and wait longer until the drinks arrive to close the tab before getting seated. All in all over 30 minutes to be seated in a half-empty place. Very lame.  However, the food completely made up for the lame policy and lack of common sense. At least the hostess was very nice and it wasn't her fault that the place had such a lame policy. I understand why businesses have the policy but not when the place has plenty of tables open. False exclusivity is a major pet peeve of mine. Anyways, their signature platter was off the hook and so was the cerviche. I also tried the huachinango pacific blue nose and it was the best fish I've ever had (although my friend said she didn't like it but she hates seafood period). Their chicken milenesa and pork chops were excellent as well. It was fun going with a group of friends and trying each others food. The creme brulee was amazing but yeah a little eggy but I liked it alot. Almost as good as Marche's but not quite. Their flan was excellent but the sorbet = Epic Fail. Oh well, you don't go to a latin place for sorbet dessert. Am I coming back? Yeah probably, the food is excellent... but not with a large party. Oh I wasn't drinking that night but my friends were TOASTED off what they said were super excellent mojitos and papaya something drinks.

Pleasantly surprised for $25 Service - ***    Host was pleasant  BUT it took ages to get a drink at the bar while we waited for our whole party to arrive. Then our server was a little slow and not very friendly (it seemed like she was put off by the fact that we weren't drinking and eating off the Yelp menu). She wasn't rude, per se, but not friendly and not very attentive... we waited -for-ev-er- between courses....

I would not want to be stuck here with that slow of service on a bad date, thats for sure. Food - ****    Fresh, unique, fun combinations. Non-greasy, flavorful, huge portions (we were shocked at the amount of food we got for $25). Not amazing, but good and different. I think if we had paid full price I may have been a tiny bit disappointed. Sampler appetizer was mixed. Shrimp skewer and mini taco - yum! Empananda and ball thing - meh. Pork tenderloin was tender and sauce was a good balance of sweet and vinegary with a flavorful spicy kick. Potatoes and onions were tasty, but too many onions and kind of a lot of big chunks of bacon on top... awkward to eat. They were ok, but I didn't feel that the potatoes provided a very complimentary flavor to the pork.  Coconut Creme Brulee, good, but not awesome - the texture was off - too custardy or something. The cuatro chocolate was good, but sooooo much chocolate. A little taste of all 4 chocolates would have been plenty. The sorbet was light and tasty.

For my entree I had the cuban pork.  My first bites of pork were really good, but then it got a funny taste (or I got to a fatty part or something) and it got less good.  The rice/black bean/plantain side pile (they were all together) was tasty, but does not a meal make.   We decided to pass on dessert.   I think the others I was with enjoyed their food perhaps more than I did, but I don't think anyone was blown away.  I would be happy to give Nacional another chance.  It wasn't bad.  It was good.  I just wish it had ended on a stronger note.",0.9972,0.71,0.263,0.027,0.5611111111111112

Let me just say that this restaurant is a bit full of itself.  Located in the old Hat Dance space (and still owned by Lettuce Entertain You) I expect more from Rich Melman and his crew.   First they messed up on the Yelp Eats program so the group that we had arranged was not able to go and enjoy that program.  I thought, ""No problem.  Friday is a busy night for a discounted dinner,  I'll just pay full price"", and I called to make a reservation.  Well- let's just say that they did not go out of their way to make me feel welcome.  They needed a credit card, told me of other restrictions and then reiterated those restrictions.  Hmm. . . .I eat out alot.  It's supposed  to be fun and this was turning out to be anything but. When we got there that same attitude was evident with the two hostesses at the stand. They wanted to seat us early (we stayed at the bar and finished our drinks) and later they marched through the restaurant with paper in hand looking to see what course you were on giving me the feeling of being rushed as they wanted my table.   The third hostess who actually sat us was delightful, smiled and seemed out of place in this land of attitude. Our server was slow and often disappeared and we were constantly flagging him down.  They also had a timing problem last night as the bread came after our appetizer and our drinks came after our dinner. If there was a winner last night- it was the FOOD!  It was delicious!  We started with a grilled calamari appetizer that was warm and cooked with olives for flavor.  For our entrees, I had the skirt steak served with avocados and salsa (full of flavor) and the Spanish potatoes Au gratin which were shredded potatoes with cheese that were really good.  My friend had the tuna which she thought was a bit greasy ,but good, and the coconut rice. I liked the ambiance and it is clear that later in the night the center area is cleared for dancing. I also thought that this place was reasonably priced.  Most entrees were in the $14-$19 range which I felt was good given the portion sizes. All in all- the food trumps some of the other issues but if I could talk to Rich Melman, I'd say ""Get over yourself.  This place is not that good"".  Re-train your servers and get some people who can make a positive first impression taking care of your guests.

One last thing--we decided to go here at the last minute (about three hours before we ate), so we weren't able to get a reservation.  However, we found a table in the patio area immediately (which was, like the bar and lounge area, first come, first serve) and were served within ten minutes of sitting.  It was a little bit of a wait, but I found it completely acceptable considering how busy they were--I was happy we were able to find a table so quickly!  Moreover, our waitress (and, later, her manager) was on top of her game the entire night.",0.9955,0.803,0.189,0.008,0.5263055555555555

2008-05-11,4.0,"Great, fun place for food, drinks, and dancing.  Having been informed that it was a special occasion, Nacional 27 prepared special menus for us with ""Happy Birthday Wendy!"" across the top. The cocktail menu was really extensive and everything sounded really good.  Upon the waiter's recommendation, I ordered the mango sangria which unfortunately did not taste like alcohol, and I say ""unfortunately"" because I downed two of them and paid the price later.  It seemed like my friends really enjoyed their caipirinhas as well. The prix fixe menu started with an appetizer platter of chicken & beef skewers, smoked chicken empanadas, vegetarian croquettes, and shrimp & scallop ceviche.  I was starving, so I found everything very tasty, especially the tender beef skewers. I ordered the grilled salmon for my entree and was pleased with my selection.  The salmon was cooked rare - it was flaky, tender, and had an appetizing citrus flavour.  I also sampled my friends' entrees and found the skirt steak to be the winner among the dishes.  It was marinated in their special steak sauce and had exceptional flavour.  The NY strip paled a little in comparison as the flavour wasn't as good and was oddly a lot chewier than the strip steak.  The slow roasted pork cubano was tender but pretty dry. Dessert was again a sampler platter and there was more than enough to go around.  Of the desserts, I found the passionfruit sorbet the best and most refreshing, though the coffee creme brulee was quite tasty as well.  The chocolate cake was a little too bitter for me and the flan tasted way too much of cinnamon (something I dislike). Surprisingly, all the dishes were of good size (I expected small portions like at some fancy restaurants) and we were stuffed by the end of the meal.  The only reason that I am docking off a star was because the service wasn't great - it took them a really long time to get our drinks, take our orders, and bring us the check.  The prices were reasonable for our meals - averaging to a little under $60pp. The dance floor opened at about 10pm, and empowered by our alcoholic hazes, we unabashedly showed off our moves.  My friend tried to teach me to salsa but I was two sheets to the wind.

2008-04-13,4.0,"When in Chicago . . .  Visiting from Los Angeles, my business colleague and I checked out Nacional on a Wednesday night. There is a $44 prix fixe menu on Wednesday -  5 courses that includes wine. At first, the layout of the menu appeared confusing (its lack of style is inconsistent with the beautifully appointed, well lit room, but don't let that throw you at the start.)  That's right, for that price you have a 5 course dinner (not including a very good amuse bouche starter) along with great wines, many outstanding choices from South America. Standouts in the dinner included a delicious seared scallop, cooked to perfection and served over a roasted chile salad. Perfectly portioned, intensely flavored and perfectly seasoned roasted fish and grilled beef followed. The wines were all good, but the standout in teh entire meal was a fantastic Argentina Vigonier that had deep notes of wet slate and and herb flower, subtly balanced with fruit and acid that reminded one of the very best in dry Reislings. A killer food wine.  The service was attentive and the staff well versed. If the waiter wasn't at the table when a course arrived, the runner was able to explain the dish in sufficient detail, showing that the back of house cares and knows what's happening up front, one of the good signs of a high quality restaurant. There's also a wide selection of Latin-inspired cocktails to start you off. You have to expect a lot from a bar that makes a Pisco Sour, but while the egg white foam of this classic drink was there, a lot of the zip and sting of a great cocktail seemed to be missing from the mix underneath (hopefully not due to the inclusion of an industrial drink mix). I'd recommend showing up early and having a cocktail at the bar, so you can get the input of the bartender.",0.9975,0.748,0.22,0.032,0.5347186147186149

Yet another great meal and night! We started with drinks (passionfruit margarita and beachcomber). Both were excellent and used the freshest of ingredients. For starters we had the ahi tuna/watermelon ceviche, pumpkin and goat cheese croquetas, and tiny lamb taco. The ceviche was really light and refreshing, the tiny lamb taco had great bbq sauce and the croquetas were nice and light. Then for an entree we split the beef medallions. The medallions were extremely tender and the potatoes gratin were amazing. I had the margarita flight (nacional 27, the hibiscus and mango). what a great deal. Each were excellent in their own way and different enough to warrant their inclusion. I always finish my meal with the champurrado, and always look forward to the next time I can have it. The perfect blend of coffee, chocolate and cinnamon is the best way to end things. Nacional isn't cheap, but their use of ingredients and fresh products justifies their prices. This is upscale latino and they do it right. I'm a big fan of Cuattro and Carnival as well but each has their own personality and individualism. Nacional is slightly more refined and the dining room can range from elegant to energetic depending on the time you visit.

The hostess was such a sweetheart and kept checking in on us to see if we were sure we were comfortable enough. We ordered a bunch of tapas, six to be exact, and boy oh boy, were they scrumptious or what?! Their bread and dips... YUMMMY!!! But beware, because it is addictive and will fill you up even before the real food arrives. We ordered the shrimp and scallop ceviche, barbecued lamb tacos, pumpkin and goat cheese croquetas, fall squash and goat cheese arepas, calamari a la plancha and duck confit and chorizo con queso fundido. Doesn't all of that sound absolutely mouthwatering?! Believe me it was, and we were just stuffed and totally content after! The duck confit and chorizo was a cut above the rest, absolutely orgasmic! The croquetas and arepas were close seconds. Not to mention the ceviche, the calamari and the tacos, because those were quite delicious, as well! I am surely going to be back!!! :-) Oh, and on Thursdays, they have live music, usually percussionists, and the one they had last night was really good.

The other thing that's noteworthy is the service.  Every server that I've had here has been observant, responsive, and interactive.  By interactive I mean they usually go above and beyond to make you feel comfortable with whatever you're ordering, especially if you're new to the tapas scene.  They are great at explaning the menu and they don't push specials or any particular dish.  I've gotten some fantastic recommendations from the servers and I didn't feel like they were giving me some cue card answer.  There was one server in particular whose name I wish I could remember.  She was a bubbly brunette with cute and curly hair with stylish glasses and had she not been hard at work I would have invited her to sit down and have dinner with us because she just had that kind of personality that you warm up too very fast.

I just had the most spectacular meal of my six-month stint in Chicago. On par with many restaurant experiences I had while living in New York, Nacional 27 has it all.  I'm rarely impressed with a restaurant immediately when I walk in, but my mouth hung open at the beauty of the airy, circular dining room, the artfully chosen lighting and even the nondescript hightop bar tables made sophisticated when draped with black fabric. My mom and I always grab tapas and drink till we drop when I'm home in Kansas City, so I thought a little Latin American flavor would be nice for our night out together last weekend.  To drink, she had a mojito flight; I tried the margarita flight. If I were doing it over, I'd just have 14 of the originals. Mid-shelf tequila balanced with a wonderful Grand Marnier flavor on top made it one of the better margaritas I've had in a while. (Cesar's Killer Margs are great and all, but this was just a few notches out of their league!) We split an apple and chorizo salad for appetizer, perfectly dressed with a creamy, garlicky sauce. The chorizo was sliced into thin, smoky strips with apples cut to match.  By the time our entrees came, I thought life could get no better, but I knew I was wrong as soon as I sampled one of the sweet plantains that came with my skirt steak. My mom had the signature tapas platter -- the highlight was a divine shrimp skewer -- and finished the whole thing. I wanted desperately to polish off my steak but had absolutely no room left. This meal truly exceeded all expectations I had. On future visits, I'll skip dessert (it was just meh) and go for my 15th original margarita instead.

On one of our previous visits, we got the chef's tasting menu, a specially prepared 5-course meal developed daily by the head chef based on the best ingredients available to him that day. It was an experience, to say the least... a meal you remember for years to come. As good as it was, we ordered off the menu this time around... I ordered a ribeye steak from the ""market menu"", which changes frequently based on season and availability of ingredients. This steak was AMAZING. It was grilled and served basted with Nacional 27's house-made steak sauce, along with stacked slices of sweet potato, parsnip, and other tubers. My fantastic dining companion had the grilled fish served over a pesto rice which was also terrific. We split the ceviche sampler, with three types of ceviche presented beautifully and that provided a great mix of flavors. For drinks, I veered away from cerveza and opted for the signature mojito, which was served in a nice big glass with a giant piece of sugar cane poking out the top. As delicious as it tasted, I did not find it to be nearly strong enough to justify the $9 price tag. Yana enjoyed her mojito martini. Reserving a table for 9pm or after on Friday and Saturday night entitles you to keep the table for when the restaurant opens up the dance floor at 11pm for salsa and other latin music.

Which became even more annoying when we looked around and saw that in some of the big booths along the wall there were parties of 2 or 3, yet our party of 4 was at this tiny, douche table. Once we were seated our waiter was attentive, but his speech about the menu was over 10 minutes long. Shut up dude, I'm really hungry after waiting for my table all this time. And to make matters worse, because we weren't seated until 9pm, the tail end of our meal got cut short by the addition of the 'dance floor.'

For dessert we went with a cherry flan that blew my mind. I never go for sweets like that, especially cherry, but it was flavorful enough without being too tart or rich. Everyone also enjoyed a pot of the Peruvian-pressed coffee. (blows the regular stuff to shame.) If I were to have one quibble, it would be the main hostess (the one checking names off the computer.) She was too preoccupied with the seating to make any eye contact or to smile. I waited approximately 5 uncomfortable minutes standing alone in front of two hostesses before even getting an acknowledgement.

I can't believe that as a born and bred Chicagoan that I have not tried this place until now. Always see it, never tried it, til now. The server was very knowledgeable. The only thing I would criticize is the almost long-windedness of his pointing out highlights. He covered half of the menu! But he was very able to answer any questions and was not snobby. Very nice and approachable, and courteous we gave him a niiiiice tip for it. After working in restaurants and catering, I have to say I'm impressed that their breads are made in house (plaintain bread and cumin flatbread).  Nice calamari amuse on a house made potato chip. The ceviche sampler was great. We loved the ahi tuna watermelon one the best. I love ceviche in general. Drinks are a bang for the buck. Seems pricey but you will not leave there sober. Awesome margarita with exotic fruit/flower add-ins. I tried the Nacional 27 margarita with elderflower syrup. Excellent, but Couldnt taste the syrup though. Cocktail flight is a neat idea - we tried the corazon, beachcomber, mango-habanero?  Entrees: Marinated skirt steak with a good corn blackbean tomato salsa.

We made our reservations through one of the managers of the restaurant who recommended we order a vegan version of their tasting menu - not on the regular menu but available by advance request (so we were told).  This was the premise for choosing this place to dine at.  More than one call was made ahead of time to speak to said manager and make sure that everything was arranged and would go off without a hitch. After waiting over 30 minutes past our 8:30 reservation to be seated, we found out that the manager had not communicated with the chef what had been discussed earlier - we had empanadas prepared, and that was it.  All five of us were expected to order one of two things on the menu and no other courses were to be prepared.  The server, manager on duty, and chef were not aware of any of the arrangements that members of our party had gone out of their way to make (and had been told were absolutely no hassle to arrange).  Needless to say, there was a lot of confusion at the beginning of our meal.   Thankfully, the staff that night was absolutely wonderful and pulled a five course vegan meal AND non-alcoholic cocktails out of their asses for us (that's a good thing, really) at basically a moment's notice.  The food was good and the experience was wonderful after we got past the initial WTF of being screwed by the person who made our reservations.  Our waiter was attentive - and really, really, REALLY freaking nervous and adorable.  the highlights of the evening were the delicious sorbets for dessert and the ear splitting (also a good thing, really) salsa music and dancing going on.   I would go back, and plan on learning a few steps so that the next time a hunky latin dude asks me to dance, i won't have to decline for fear of crushing his toes with my giant, clumsy feet.",0.8972,0.787,0.121,0.092,0.5309628739316239

The decor is very contemporary and energetic, with some techno music bumping in the background, but not so loud that I couldn't hear my friend.   Our waitress was fantastic - when we couldn't decide between two wines, she brought us both to taste.  And when we couldn't decide which entrees to pick, she described them in detail and made excellent suggestions.  The other servers were also extremely professional - it speaks volumes about the restaurant when servers know when to fill the water glasses and clear the plates.   We started with some amazing salmon and cucumber ceviche - I don't like cucumber, but I polished off my portion with no problem.  My friend's grouper was exactly as spicy as the waitress described, and my pork 'cubano' with plantains was perfectly balanced.  Despite getting full, we both ate every last bite, which was a testament to the quality of the meal. We each spent $40 with tip, which is pricier than my normal meal out, but it was worth every penny.  Worth the stop if you like South American food, great ambiance, and excellent service.",0.9873,0.739,0.177,0.084,0.47138888888888886

The food was extremely good (we did the Wednesday night menu fixe with wine), but portions are small. The idea of the wine pairings (free on Wednesday) was nice, too. Overall, though, I didn't like this place. It's one thing to be hip and cool and nonchalant, quite another to be so overtaken by your apparent ""hot"" status that you treat your customers like crap. There are plenty of other hot places out there (Cru & Alinea, for example) that make the effort to treat you like you're their most important customer, ever.

Not bad, but not great and you'll be paying for ""The Scene"" as much as you're paying for the food-and at least the cocktails will be good (and they are, try the mojitos)! But Nacional 27 has bucked that trend by giving me one of the best meals I've had in recent history, even with a thumping techno beat in the background. I'm a huge ceviche fan, so I had a serious conundrum chosing between their many options for a starter. I went with the ahi tuna and watermelon and was not at all dissapointed. It was different from any ceviche I've ever had, a lot sweeter, but in a good way. Everything else, down to the breadbasket (onion and plaintain foccaccia? yes please!) was just as delicious. Everybody raved about their meals and there wasn't a lot of sharing, because nobody was willing to give up precious forkfuls of their own meal. Once we finished and had paid the bill, there was the usual chorus of ""oh my god I am so stuffed I could never eat again,"" but after we'd lingered for about 1/2 hour, somebody came by to give us a complimentary plate of chocolate truffles.

2007-03-30,2.0,"It was my birthday.  I had a LEYE gift card, and was hoping to treat myself to a multi-course feast.  When some of my co-workers heard that I had boldly made a reservation for one, they told me that was not socially acceptable, and joined me on my escapade.  They wanted tapas.  So instead of a multi-course feast, we had tapas.  And we spent the whole night cranking about work. I would consider trying Nacional 27 again on one of their salsa dancing nights.  The tables in the main dining room are clearly set up facing inwards towards the center of the room, specifically for watching such a spectacle.  Unfortunately, this means that sitting in the middle of the shallow-oval of a booth we were in, I had to turn my full body to see the two other people I was dining with, and was only capable of making solid eye contact with the waiter and the people who were sitting directly ahead of me.  Since the waiter was constantly at our table pestering us to order more food and drinks or encouraging us to quit lingering, this became rather uncomfortable. The acclaimed mojitos were in fact quite sweet and their enjoyable flavor combinations went down easily.  The various tapas we sampled after navigating the poorly designed menu were satisfying, if not particularly memorable.  I wanted to try a ceviche, which my dining companions weren't thrilled about.  When they agreed to share an order with me, our waiter insisted we order a larger one if we were going to split it.  So we did.  And ate half of it.  Because there's really only so much ahi tuna and watermelon a girl can eat.  We were encouraged to get the churros with ice cream for a dessert to share, which again was good, if not remarkable.",0.9825,0.824,0.138,0.038,0.5175653594771241

After reading all the glowing reviews on here I expected to be wowed by Nacional 27, but it fell a little short of my expectations. I came here with a few girlfriends on a Saturday night for my friend's birthday and we made our reservation for 9:15, which is the earliest time you can come for dinner and then keep your table for the rest of the night after the dancing starts. The hostess tried to seat us at a table literally five feet from two swinging doors which led into the kitchen and I actually sacked up and asked her to move us to a different table. She told us we would have to wait another 15-20 minutes for a different table, which wasn't really a big deal, we just ordered some drinks from the bar, however the table she re-seated us at 20 minutes later was open when she initially tried to stick us in front of the kitchen. I think she must have noticed that we recognized this and volunteered the information that despite the fact that the table was open earlier, another table in that section had just been seated and they never seat two tables in the same section at once so that the server has time to adjust. I've never worked in the restaurant industry, so I don't know if this is standard policy, but I think it's odd that they would put their staff's needs ahead of the needs of their customers like this. We sampled a few things off the menu -- the ahi tuna and watermelon ceviche and the pumpkin and goat cheese croquetas were good, not mind-blowing, but good. However, after our appetizers were cleared away it took so long to get our entree that we actually thought that the our server might have forgotten to put the order in, especially because he never stopped by our table to let us know that it was coming. By the time we finally got his attention to ask him about it, my friend and I didn't even really want it anymore, particularly since the lights had already dimmed significantly and they were in the process of clearing away the tables and chairs to make room for the dance floor. I think he sensed that we didn't really want it, but he sort of pressured us into taking it since they already started to make it. Once it came out, I was unimpressed. It was some sort of fish special which had a delicious passion fruit and pomegranate sauce, but the fish itself was probably the toughest, chewiest piece of fish I have ever tasted. After dinner we stayed for about an hour of dancing, which was fun, but the dance floor got extremely crowded and there were a lot of skeezy guys who kept coming up to our table. The one part of my whole experience that I was really impressed with were the drinks. All of their specialty drinks were absolutely amazing. I started off with something that had fresh watermelon in it and then I tried the mojito flight, both of which were out of this world. I would come back here just for the drinks, especially since the bar half of the restaurant was really much more interesting looking than the dining half. Bottom line: if you're a fan of salsa dancing come here for some cocktails and an evening of good Latin music, but skip dinner.",0.995,0.871,0.104,0.026,0.4401927437641724
