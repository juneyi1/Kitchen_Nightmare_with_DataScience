I used to mess with a place a couple blocks from where I live, but China Nite Cafe has straight up stole my business away. I dig it because the veggies always taste fresh and crisp, and the food in general isn't super salty or greasy.  Another perk is free orange chicken when you spend $35, which is not hard to do because we go H.A.M. when we order Chinese.  Only things I don't enjoy are the egg rolls. They're on the smaller side and don't have much filling. They taste of mostly dough and peanut butter. Also the delivery can be spotty. Most times they're quick but there's been times it's taken close to an hour or more. One time they forgot half of our order, which is a nightmare scenario when you're hungry af and been waiting for your food. They amended it in a timely fashion though, & wasn't a huge deal, but surprising since Chinese places are usually on their game.

Only when comparing with other Chinese restaurants near UIC, it becomes one of the best. However, there are some newly-added dishes that are really good and very authentic.
