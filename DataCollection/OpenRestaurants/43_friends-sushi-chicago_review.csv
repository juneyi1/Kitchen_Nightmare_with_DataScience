2017-08-17,2.0,"I was all set to bump them down to three stars based on my most recent dine and the one prior...but now down to two. Why? Read on!  The ""Tuna Lover"" ""specialty roll"" was quite small, ($16 no less) did not come with any sense of dijon balsamic (as advertised) and upon request, I was brought some type of liquid that added really no flavor to the roll. The fish itself was slightly dry and the wasabi was dry and crumbling...so that's hardly fit for a four star rating. As for wine selection, only one of several popular varietals ( i.e. only one Chardonnay, one Cab, offered) on the menu is hardly adequate.  I've also dined here a couple times since my prior review and was already leaning toward a lesser score and this most recent dine confirmed it.  The seaweed salad was the only thing that was actually wonderful.   They slid further - from a three to a two star - when I looked at the app that I use to book my table they did not credit my dine - my reservation was no where to be found, even though I checked in at the hostess stand and my name was there on their screen. I find this sketchy - ""Friends"" uses a reservation platform and then didn't follow through and check me in. Seems they are not crediting the guest nor the app that brought them in. That's not so friendly now, is it? A shame too, I'm going to skip checking out their nearby second location.",-0.4521,0.877,0.054,0.069,0.48311111111111116

2017-07-13,3.0,"Called in an order late one night for a chirashi and a Devil's Tuna roll. The employee on the phone was polite and the order was ready pretty fast. I opted to pick up since ordering through Yelp actually goes through a 3rd party site that charges a fee. Picking up was easy and I really appreciated how compact & nicely packaged all the items were since I had to go home. Devil's Tuna Roll: A wonderful combination of flavors. Their mix of spicy tuna wasn't too spicy but had just enough of a kick that let it work well with the creamy avocado and cream cheese. Everything about this roll was fantastic and I would get it again in a heartbeat. It's a bit pricy at $16 and unfortunately it isn't big enough for a meal (4.5/5) Chirashi: I opted for the large chirashi that cost $29 which is pretty steep for a chirashi. However that'd be ok if the fish was good. Unfortunately the fish was relatively meh and the size was about what I expected. The selection was ok and included common and less common items including: salmon, tuna, ebi, hamachi, hirame, escolar, albacore, & ikura. The rice was also very bland. (2.5/5) Overall Friends Sushi may be the place to go for rolls but I would definitely pass on the chirashi in the future.",0.9848,0.787,0.175,0.038,0.512192118226601

They have house music playing in the background as well. Glad we made reservations on OpenTable a few hours prior since it was pretty busy on a Saturday night.  We ordered the following items: - Sweet & spicy signature maki - Can you handle it? signature maki - Fire wing signature maki - Creamy spicy tuna raw maki - Salmon nigiri All of the rolls were pretty good, paired nicely with a Sapporo beer. They do have decent selection of makis to choose from. I would pass on the salmon nigiri next time though, felt like could have gotten better quality for the price elsewhere. My favorite roll out of the 4 was the can you handle it?, which had salmon, avocado, jalapeño, Japanese peppers, cucumbers, topped with unagi, mango, spicy mayo, and unagi sauce. Usually comes with cilantro too but I asked for it without. #thanksOR6A2gene Anyways, the service here was fantastic. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly.

The tables are quite small so it's hard to fit anything more than 2 plates on them, which was kind of inconvenient during our lunch there.  We ordered the tuna and salmon poké, with an additional hamachi roll. Food was decently priced and came out in an orderly manner. The food, in my opinion, was merely average.

I had the yakuza roll because I love tuna; it has soft shell crab, spicy white tuna (not too spicy to handle), avocado, and more tuna on top. It was delicious! They had many unique rolls-my mom got a beef teriyaki asparagus roll. It is a little pricey for appetizers and entrees, but I thought the food was awesome. The service was quick-I also made a reservation on OpenTable. Also, inside, the seats are comfortable, but really close to each other.

Thankfully I ordered the hotategai nigiri ... which was awesome. The miso soup was good and the smoke salmon nigiri was decent.

2017-04-29,2.0,"Overrated Place We heard this is one of the good sushi place so my friends and I decided to give it a try. My friend even came here directly from the airport, However, we're actually very disappointed... it's not a must go place in Chicago. After reviewing the reviews and photos, we ordered  Scallop Butteryaki for appetizer. it's very delicious and the scallop is very big and mushroom is very tasty. The photo on yelp was showing 4 pieces but it came 3 pieces only. I guess we forgot to check when they took the pictures compared with the current market price...lol Main dishes we ordered Yakuza, Friends, Salmon Zen, Alaskan, Philly, Fire Dragon and Veggie Angel. To be honest, it's very just okay, non of the maki we ordered is very special or made you tasted that this is one of the best sushi place in Chicago. It makes us very disappointed and thinks why we even rush to be here. The only things we like is dinning environments and drinks. We ordered lychee martini, Asian Pear tini, Maitai...etc, It's very good. I think this place is cool as a cocktail bar with some appetizers. It's a very cozy place with too many waitresses. They're all standing at the end right next to the restroom. It makes this place even smaller...lol the chair I sit is one of foot parts missing and it can't be balance, so I fall one side all the time when I'm having my dinner.  At the end, our waitress even came to our table and asked for more tips. First, tips is only a suggestion base the way you served and food and the dinning environment, second, we tipped you over 14% to made the integer number so we are easy to split the bill, she came back and said we only paid 10% tips, not sure what's in your mind or you are bad with number? Third, base on our experiences above, 14% tips is VERY generous.  Running a restaurant is hard, you are not only need to focus on your food/menu, store cleanliness/design/environment, but also provide decent service. In general, I gave 2 stars as our dinning experience for table of 5.  I will suggest you go for drinks but you might want to think twice when you decide to go for dinning.",0.9875,0.827,0.128,0.045,0.5637490551776267

Not sure I really expected more given the environment, but the waitress we had laughed/scoffed when we asked a question about the menu. No matter how stupid a customer's question seems, you're in the service business. Keep your reaction to yourself! (1/5)",0.7702,0.713,0.166,0.121,0.5608187134502924

The wait was only like ten minutes, and then we were sat.  It's a fairly cramped space, low-lit, packed with kidney-shaped tables, and blasting EDM music--and I mean blasting.  We had to borderline yell to hear each other.  The service was decent, I suppose.  They were crazy busy so it always took awhile for the server to come by the table, but we were pretty chill without him.  The miso was standard, but my boyfriend got the spicy miso and it was out of this world.    NOT for the faint of heart, though; it even set my lips on fire and I grew up on spicy food.  We each got a specialty roll and they were both delicious.  We also polished off two bottles of sake between us, which my boyfriend was delighted with--he'd never had sake before.

I thought the point of sushi was to taste the fish with a hint of something you like. Many sushi places cover or mix the sushi roll with ingredients that take away from the taste of the fish, Friends sushi is no different. I recommend this place for people who like a light taste of fish and a lot of other ingredients.

My favorite was the Friends which was a crazy complex roll with so many different flavors. The green apple and cream cheese gave it a surprising and delicious texture. The Crisp Creamy had parmesan cheese on top which I've never had before but I really enjoyed it. The Tiger eye had a spicy kick to it that I enjoyed but sometimes was a little overwhelming (but then again I'm not the biggest spicy fan) We also ordered sake: draft sake and an interesting champagne-like jelly sake. There were little chunks of jelly in mine which I enjoyed at first for the novelty, but I did wish there was less jelly. Also if you let the jelly sit too long, it started getting even more chunky.

2017-02-20,4.0,"One night after shopping around the Magnificent Mile, my boyfriend and I weren't sure what to eat for dinner. We've come to Chicago to try new things and to get away from all the Asian food, but unfortunately it's a must for us so we ended up Yelping and Friends Sushi showed up nearby enough to where walking wasn't a big issue for us.  We came here around 7pm and the place itself was pretty empty minus 3-4 tables so we were able to snag a table right away. And here's where there is a missing star- because this restaurant seems like it is located inside a house so it is very narrow on the inside and not wide. They try to use up all the space available to them which makes for a very crowded room if this place was to be filled. Even just having a table sitting next to us caused some trouble trying to get out as we were seated next to the wall and had to utter some ""excuse me's"".  Now one thing that was good about them was the fact that their menu was relatively simple. We don't really like going to places that have an extensive menu as that could take a while to go through so we were happy when we were able to order things quite quickly around here. And food came out in ample time as well. I can't remember exactly what my boyfriend got other than their salmon belly nigiri and their hamachi nigiri, but I do remember us both being content with what we got so no complaints there. And not completely sure how people feel about this next part but brace yourself- there is a TV in the bathroom. I will not lie, that is a nice change. And while I can't seem to imagine myself spending maybe more than 5 minutes in there, I do enjoy the fact that they thought of that because my boyfriend ended up staying in the bathroom for a good while just to watch TV.

White walls, club chairs, and a small, dark space leads to a fun atmosphere for a date or for a fun night with friends.  The menu is extensive, and works well for a sushi-enthusiast or someone on the fence. They separate options by cooked, raw, and signature rolls. I had a few friends that were uncertain about raw fish, so we got a mix of both.  From the Signature Maki, we got the Can You Handle It? (Good roll, but we most definitely could 'handle' it, and it wasnt our favorite of the night), the Ticky Tacky (mint & wasabi? Surprising combo, but I loved it! I would definitely recommend, and was pleasantly surprised by the cool flavors), the Fujiyama, and the Big Friends (both were good but not as memorable).  From the raw menu we got the Jazz, which was a good option for someone not as into raw sushi. The salmon was good, but the flavors balanced out the texture.  From the Cooked Menu, we ordered the Winter (w/o cream cheese) which was also good but not particularly memorable.  Overall, the food was solid, the atmosphere was fun, and I would recommend!

They only had one bench for people waiting that sat two people. We got the sweet raspberry sake and it was amazing. I would say that I think things would be easier if they sacrificed a table or two in order to give a little more floor space in between each table. The ambiance is very intimate but servers were constantly bumping into tables and each other trying to get around. I loved the place tho.

I had walked by this place several times and was always curious about it.  The atmosphere is very laid back and almost lounge like. They have chill electric music in the background. The tables are really close to one another which is something I didn't like.  Their specialty roles are good but it takes away from the flavors of the actual fish. I like their sashimi because they're were great and very generous with what they gave you.

The chicken was the worst I've ever had. It was chewy; with a fatty texture but it didn't appear to be fat. Just overcooked, reheated chicken. My appetite was ruined. When the waitress asked how everything was, I told her not good. She apologised and asked if she could get me something else. No. It took two more passes of the waitress and and explicit request for my plate to be taken. She brought some ice cream as compensation. It wasn't good either. When the bill came, my dish, which had two bites taken, was on the bill! I told her it needed to be removed. She said she couldn't remove it because she didn't have the password and the manager wasn't there. ""Don't tip me,"" she said.

2016-07-22,1.0,"In the area, so I stopped in for lunch on a whim. First impression: Odd. The cramped interior is in bad need of an update...sort of 60s by way of an 80s airport lounge. Uncomfortable, round, white leather chairs and irregularly shaped, tiny tables. Traditional style ceiling fans that bore no connection to the rest of the, um, design.  A small flatscreen TV in the restroom (?) tuned to some daytime drivel. Deodorizing system courtesy of a Yankee candle. More oddness: Why did they take the carnation off my table while I was eating? I noticed when leaving that the staff was unwrapping roses. Perhaps lowly carnations are for the 'cheap' lunch crowd; roses for those willing to spend more. This seemed to be the tacky case, although lunch specials still ran for another hour. Regardless, wait until I leave before dismantling my table setting. All of that is inconsequential, however, if the sushi is good. Unfortunately, the fish was not as fresh as it should be (in other words, it shouldn't be served)  and the rice was absolutely flavorless. There's really nothing else to say about it. I love sushi, so I was looking forward to my meal. It was quite disappointing. Don't care for the plastic chopsticks either. Not particularly hygienic (imagine a restaurant reusing plastic forks) and slippery. One time use wood please. Worst of all: One of the sushi chefs blew his nose, didn't wash his hands, and immediately grabbed a pile of rice. Made me queasy, to say the least. Had I seen that before I ordered I would have walked out. Should have anyway. One star for friendly wait staff. Definitely will not return.",-0.8956,0.822,0.066,0.112,0.5541666666666667

2016-07-20,2.0,"Visiting from California, I am fortunate to be able to get good sushi.  Sorry FRIENDS, this was not up to par! Pricing is high for such small rolls with skimpy cut of fish and minimal sprinkle of gold tobiko. I could understand the pricing because of the neighborhood, but taste was not good either. Sushi rice is seasoned, I didn't taste theirs at all. I eat without soy sauce and appreciate the flavors of it all. If you're someone who uses lot of soy, you may not mind so much.  Food: King California roll- small size roll, hardly anything inside...not even cucumber. NOT enough gold tobiko to add flavor. (Sorry, I was too hungry to take pics). $13 not enough crab at this price. Not even enough fillers to compensate.  Unagi roll with avocado- small roll and for $9, the should give the cucumber it avo or cuke) since it was only a few thin thin slivers in the King roll.  Rainbow roll $15!? Tiny slivers 3 kinds of fish, not even the size of an average nigiri sushi elsewhere.  I won't return, people's rave reviews?, I was very disappointed. I will seek a better choice in the city. Save your $ and have a better meal at Rosebud next door.   Chicken teriyaki came with rice, miso soup, good portion of edamame. $14 pricey, but expected for the area. For this price, you could eat a better plate of chicken at another restaurant. Chicken wasn't marinated, grilled, not moist, bit dry white meat. Sauce for to go meal was on the side, but it wasn't very good. Tasted more like soy sauce than teriyaki.  Miso was good, and good portion of edamame (steamed soy beans) could of used a sprinkle of salt.",0.9924,0.82,0.157,0.023,0.5740416666666668

2016-07-17,4.0,"Wow, this place was an amazing find!  I landed in Chicago yesterday morning and after a long day at the beach I was craving some sushi. I started to look up Sushi places near my hotel and this place came up.  I looked at the pictures and decided to give it a go.  For 6:30pm on a Saturday night, it was extremely busy.  I would highly recommend making a reservation if you plan on coming here.  I was a one person party, and the host even asked me if I had a reservation. Even though there were no tables left, she offered me a seat at the bar and I happily agreed.  The inside decor was interesting, white furniture, dim lighting, the seats looked weird but were very comfortable!  I browsed the menu and they had quite a few amazing choices.  Now I am a sushi lover, but some of these things on the menu I have never even heard of.  So I just drank my wine took my time with ordering.  And being at the bar wasn't helpful, it was making me even more confused because I got to watch the sushi chefs prepare each meal for the costumers. Everything and I mean EVERYTHING looked so good!!!  Finally, I decided to stick to what I know.  I ordered two pieces of Tako and a spicy tuna roll.  And WOW absolutely amazing! Probably the best spicy tuna roll I had in quite a long time. The Tako and the Roll were extremely fresh and the portion was huge! Worth every penny.  There was a part of me that wanted to try something else but I was way too full to do so. Overall, the service was great and the food came out fairly quick even with it being extremely busy.

I cannot remember the exact names but I love that this place used fresh and quality ingredients. That's the only way to make sushi in my book. Sushi isn't bogo so it can be expensive, but I don't think you'd break the bank ordering two rolls.

""Sweet & Spicy"" combined eel, cucumber, and salmon, but the piquant kick of the dollop of red sauce was what made it interesting.  In the ""Jimmai"" the hamachi, cilantro and seabass were really complemented by the smokiness of the grilled asparagus.  Our favorite roll was the very unusual ""Ticky Tacky"" where the predominant flavors came not from the king crab or tender thin octopus topping, but rather the mint leaf and wasabi mayo.

I had the Umi roll, and my boyfriend ordered a combo with a Spicy Tuna Roll, miso soup, and sashimi. Both were delicious! Prices are reasonable as well.  However, there was one issue that we both couldn't seem to get over. I had bitten into an edamame only to find a maggot was hanging out. I'm grateful I didn't eat the thing, but the response we not what we anticipated. Our waitress said that this happens because the edamame is ""all natural"" and they don't use chemicals on them. Their solution was to bring out a new edamame, which I was slightly reluctant about. Why would I want to eat more when I just had a bug come out of one? I'm not one to be demanding, but I felt as if other means could have been taken to address this situation.  Otherwise, we truly did have an enjoyable experience.

I'm hungry, but I don't want hotel food. I don't want to spend an arm and a leg on hotel room service. What do I do? Order delivery using the Yelp app! I settled on this restaurant because they had both dim sum items and a regular menu. This is unusual for an Asian restaurant, but I was willing to take a chance. After all, I hadn't had dim sum in a while. I ordered easily via the app. The food arrived on time, as expected, and the hotel front desk allowed the delivery guy to come to the room, thankfully. I didn't have to sign anything, which was great. GrubHub restaurants sometimes make you sign a sheet of paper, which I am not sure why. I opened my bag of food. I was not impressed by the look of the shumai because the wrapper was almost white. Nonetheless, I paid for it, so I should eat it. The taste was MUCH better than the aesthetics! The shumai was on point and reminded me of dim sum places in Houston, yum! I also ordered the medium spicy miso ramen soup. The broth wasn't too spicy (just right), and the noodles were packaged separately from the soup, which I appreciate (prevents overcooking). The soup was chock full of seafood and tofu, as promised. I am glad this place doesn't skimp. I think the prices are a bit steep compared to Houston's Chinatown, but on par with Chicago's downtown. Would I order from here again? Yes!

The Black Shrimp Tempura didn't offer us much flavor, but we chose that roll as a way of balancing out the other two rolls. The Crisp Creamy was full of unique flavor. It was topped with parmesan cheese which was new to me and quite delicious if i do say. Friends was my favorite! It had a kick to it, but it offered so much to my tastebuds that they didn't know what to do! The service was wonderful. They were very efficient in making their sushi.

Only one of the yellowtail pieces was buttery and delicious but that is one out of about 15 pieces of fish. My friend got two rolls and was also disappointed.

The place is intimate with dim lighting, white seats all around. Many people were in 'after work groups' or on a 'first date' to a small gathering of friends.  I started off with some hot green tea (the flavor was very light) but that's okay because it was less than 3 dollars. I also had chicken soup and my friend had miso soup. Both soups were not salty, filled with great broth flavor, and my chicken soup was shredded, breakable, and there was tons of chicken in there! For 6 dollars it was a perfect way to start.  I wasn't watching my calories so I ordered a creamy spicy tuna roll. Yes, it was spicy - and that's exactly how I wanted it. They didn't binge on any of the ingredients. Nicely cooked rice, a flavored mayo sauce, a good amount of tuna filling and lots of it. I was impressed. For 10 dollars, you will get your fill. So choose what sushi you want wisely!

The seats were surprisingly comfortable and almost felt like you were at a modern home. We started with some waters. I really feel like water should always come with lemon! Takes away the tap watery flavor and the water here definitely had that taste.  We reviewed the menu over and over trying to finalize our choices and landed on three:  Fire Wing roll to start with. It sounded great on the menu but it was so basic--not worth the price. I wouldn't get it again. Lacked combination of flavors that I look for in a roll.  Big Friends was next. This one was very delicious. Had a great combination of flavors and texture. I would get this one again and highly recommend to others.  Can You Handle It? was our final roll we shared. I love spicy food and this was a spicy roll. I liked it but not too much. I would say if someone sounds intrigued by it from reading it on the menu then you should try it. If i come here again I probably wouldn't get it again.  There were other rolls that I would try if I could fit more down my belly. I noticed that a lot of rolls included cream cheese which I'm not keen on much of that.  The service was interesting, I couldn't really understand the girl that was serving us.

2015-10-30,4.0,"Our last night in Chicago with nine girls, and we were looking for something on the healthy side near our hotel for our last meal. This isn't necessarily a spot you can make reservations and arrive early to enjoy a drink at the bar, especially not for a gaggle of hungry girls. Our table wasn't quite ready yet when we got there a little early but they appeased a handful of the girls with edamame. It has this almost retro-futuristic Star Trek, I could be on the inside of a boat OR a spaceship feel with nice comfy white chairs.  Our waiter was very sweet, and we did our best not to be ""those girls"" and pooled our requests together so only one person was spouting off the order which was about 10 or so rolls, a handful of appetizers, and dishes. One thing I think that would benefit this place is the paper sheet menu that they do in other sushi restaurants to tic off your order, but maybe that's just not their bag.  Thank you to my fellow Yelpers for the photos of some of the great sushi rolls to help us make our choices. Top rolls were the Friends Roll and Devil's Tuna but I think they did a great job with your usual rolls like the Rainbow roll, and have two options for spicy tuna rolls, creamy and crunchy, which I like! For ordering that much it came out in a timely manner, and we were all able to fill up. I did think the Yuzu Ceviche was a little small for the price, but had some of the girls that wanted to order it anyway. Not much for sharing for more than two people, just an FYI!  Our bill was around $50 per girl for apps, food, and drinks.

The maki rolls we got were overdressed with sauces which might have been an attempt to mask the poor quality of fish.  The past times that I've been here, the food has been much better.

2015-09-21,2.0,"Overall: Mediocre sushi fare for high Chicago prices. Ordered a roll that was a little too sweet... Food: I got the Mad Maki and the Triple, which I shared with my girlfriend. The Mad Maki was weird... It came with like 8 pieces and was drenched in eel sauce and spicy mayo. Like the roll was soaked in a puddle of the sauce on the plate. It also had a weird sweet flavor, almost to the same tune of candy. The Triple was a lot more normal but wasn't too satisfying. Friends Sushi is a weird place. It was packed outside with people waiting on the Sunday night that I went but they seated us immediately. The interior is like a futuristic space bar.. I was nervous that the fish would taste like freeze dried space food. Instead, one of the rolls came out to be soaked in sauce. I felt my blood sugar rise after eating a few pieces. I basically ordered sticky rice with candied eel sauce for 15 dollars.

The chairs are pretty low and you can not move them forward or back since they are pretty heavy and flat bottom. Service: Our waitress was really sweet but realllllyyyyy slow.

He kept checking on us every now and then and even brought us waters. The place is very well managed. I should also mention that this place is extremely compact, you're chair to chair with everyone. I didn't necessarily mind this just because there's still plenty of room at your table. Just a heads up!  Now to the food, we ordered the grilled calamari as an appetizer. I've never had it grilled before and I must say I prefer the fried calamari. But the rest of my family would disagree so I guess it's just personal preference. Our main courses came quite quickly. My mom and dad ordered sashimi that was presented beautifully. I ordered teriyaki chicken and a dragon roll.

I felt as if I got 1/2 of what I normally get. Eel sauce was pretty standard.  Also ordered green tea ice cream. I would rate this below average of all the green tea ice creams I've tasted.

Rolls were all super fresh and since neither one of us eats cooked rolls, we thought the fish was VERY fresh. Sashimi salad was just a basic plate of about 7 pieces of sashimi on the bed of spring lettuce with a side of wasabi cracker.

First off I must say the service and ambiance is really nice. But the rolls were just horrible I mean Mr.Pac or whatever packaged sushi they sell at seven eleven was better than this stuff.  We got 3 rolls one was fried squid(was actually decent but not in anyway amazing), dark shrimp tempura, and a specialty maki Sweet and Spicy. We asked how many rolls would be in the cooked (not specials) rolls and the waiter told us about 6-8. With that one would expect the 15 dollar specialty roll would have more rolls right? But five rolls came the normal rolls and 6 with the specialty.  And then the rolls themselves were so small and no meat at all! I mean one of them I swear was a piece of a mushroom which I believe was black shrimp tempura. The sweet and spicy had no unagi like the description said. And barely any meat that was just filled with celery. On top of that the roll kept falling apart so I couldn't even get one full bite. Overall I was not satisfied or full. I do not plan on coming here again. Go to RA sushi instead or I even the CVS probably has better sushi! I feel really cheated to be given such little food for so much money.

We actually arrived a bit late, but lucky for us we were able to be seated immediately. The restaurant is teeny tiny, rectangular, with all white interior and decor. Our waitress was fairly nice and attentive. I dined with two of my peeps, so we all decided to order a roll and share. We ordered four specialty rolls which cost about 15 bucks each. Pricey, but it's Chicago, so what do you expect. We ordered the Can You Handle It,  Friends, Spicy Tuna, and Winter rolls.  Hot diggity dang! It was heavenly. I enjoyed each roll immensely, but I think I was overwhelmed with sadness when the Winter roll was all gone. The Can You Handle It is a bit spicy, but the mango on top was a nice touch.

Decor inside is contemporary and very cozy.  Service is good, but as it was busier, it slowed down a little near the end.

My husband and I stopped here shortly before they closed on Friday night 10/24/14 after flying in from San Diego and asked if we could place a to-go order but the 3 ladies at the front were extremely rude and stated last call was 15 minutes ago, I comprehend last call was 15 minutes ago but an attitude is not necessary for me to understand that; that should have my first indication. On Saturday we decided to give it a try again since it had so many good reviews, so we placed a pick up order and headed over. When we got there the lady gave me a total of $35 and some change (we ordered a Jimmai Roll $14, Tuna lover $13, and 2 ponzu sauces $1 each) I looked at the receipt and each roll was $15 so I explained to the lady their website says $14 and $13 so she points to the receipt and says oh no it $15 so I respond with yes I see on the receipt it says $15 but your website says the opposite so she hands me a menu that they have on display at the front in a plastic display and I say to her yeah this is the same price that's on the website NOT $15 while I'm explaining this some other worker says oh we changed our prices a month ago (um okay but your website doesn't reflect that and neither does the menu you just handed me so I don't care!) I explain the same thing to him and this entire time they are talking over each other (lots of chaos) talking to another guy (owner/manger maybe) and he comes over and says we changed prices a month ago what website did you see this on? and I look at him and say um YOUR website (mind you I don't care bc it's only a few bucks but seriously get it together!) so he starts looking it up on his phone and eating up my time while I'm just standing there then decides to give me some sodas for the inconvenience - how about I don't want your dang sodas bc I don't drink sugar for fun how about you do the right thing and give me the price that is advertised on your website!

It's right next to a Thai place and when we entered, I swore the people in the front were not speaking Japanese, so this place probably has Thai owners. Eager for a variety of fresh fish, I settled on the large chirashi bowl ($29). It come with miso soup. The bowl, which looks shaped like a boat, has 15 pieces of fish, but it really comprised of 7 different fish. Pretty good and fresh. Great presentation of the fish as well.  The one surprise is that the chirashi bowl did not include tamago (egg omelete sushi), which had been pretty standard on other chirashi bowls I've ordered. Nevertheless, the bowl was a good value for the price. There is also a smaller size for $4 less, and I think it comes with 2-3 less pieces of fish. We also ordered the agedashi tofu ($6) for the appetizer. Quite yummy as well. Comes in 4 pieces.

We came here on a Sunday night after walking downtown all day because it happened to be closest to where we were around dinnertime. One of my friends said this was an OK place for sushi nearby where we were- her favorite place was 2 miles away and we weren't interested in walking that far after 5 hours of walking already. There didn't seem to be a lot of people here around 6 so that's telling OR maybe Chicagoans eat dinner much later? Anyways, we ordered two rolls (cali and raw salmon) and we split the Salmon Teriyaki.  The rolls were ok...the salmon better than the cali. Maybe this is wrong, but I judge a sushi place by how they do their cali rolls since it's the most basic roll out there. Theirs resembled the same quality of Cali roll that you would get at a grocery store...edible but not savory. The salmon teriyaki was, however, really good! It came on a plate with crinkle cut carrots, asparagus and broccoli. The cooked salmon was tender, flavorful and cooked just right! Lastly, I had to make a trip to the bathroom and even though the hallway was narrow (you pass by their VERY narrow kitchen), the bathrooms were clean (albeit very cold). Plus: There's a TV in the restroom in case you want to catch up on your favorite show!

Which I believe only came out after I had to flag her down (keep in mind that we were sitting right next to where the servers would pick up the food and she had to walk past us to take food to the table behind us who's sat down AFTER us) to ask her where our food was. She then had to check the ticket and then bring out the food which looked liked they had scrapped it off other plates on to a larger plate to bring to us. She checked in on us exactly twice and we had to flag down another server to get a refill on water. It is hands down some of the worst service I have ever had.

2014-07-22,4.0,"If the menu doesn't have helpful pictures, I usually stick with my tried-and-true favorites. But our server at Friends Sushi was so thoughtful about describing her recommendations, we didn't even need visual aids. We listed our standards (unagi nigiri, yellowtail nigiri, and any spicy roll with salmon or tuna), and she told us what most customers order, like the ""Can You Handle It?"" and the ""Devil Tuna"" which both sounded amazing. But then she said, ""I prefer the Salmon Zen..."" and went on to lovingly describe what was clearly her favorite maki on the giant Friends' menu. And it didn't disappoint.  We also ordered a bottle of Nautilus Sauvignon Blanc, which paired perfectly with our choices of fish. *side note* I don't really know anything about pairing wine with food. I just know that I love Sauvignon Blanc and I think it goes great with everything from hot dogs to cereal to steak to sushi to another sauvignon blanc.  Although the unagi, yellowtail, and Salmon Zen were enough to fill us up on a warm summer night, we decided to have one more roll before we left because we still had a little more wine to kill and also because why not? The hubs made an executive decision and ordered the Tuna Lover. It was fabulous.  The entire meal and experience were outstanding. Our server was equal parts knowledgeable and adorable; the food was a total mmmm-gasm from start to finish, the wine was crisp and grassy without being too heavy or overpowering, and the place is delightfully outdated. The all-white interior is becoming a bit dingy with age, but still cute enough. It kind of reminds me of being on an airplane a little bit, especially since the whole place is so long and narrow; but it's like being on a party plane with no turbulence or screaming babies, so it's really kind of fun.  After experiencing Friends Sushi, I'm more than a huge fan...I'm a friend. Yeah, that cheesiness was intended. Once you try it, you'll feel that way, too.",0.994,0.778,0.186,0.036,0.6186507936507935

Small tables, closer together, but I kind of like that; we're all FRIENDS here right? (See what I did there?) We started off with a round of miso soups, which in my opinion is always a must. They were delightful as expected. We also got two bottles of sake. I can't remember, nor could I pronounce the names if my life depended on it, but they were both very good. They bring them out in their respective bottles and pour them for you. I remember going to read the labels on the bottles and not being able to, because, well, they're entirely in Japanese lol (that's how you KNOW it's real). I'm embarrassed to even say, we ordered six rolls for three people, and one of them barely ate (hint: it wasn't me). I remember we ordered the Crunchy Creamy, Diablo Tuna, and some Pink roll, but I can't remember the rest. If you're a fan of tuna, the Diablo Tuna is your best bet, it's phenomenal. Everything else was very very good as well; very fresh, the sauces weren't too heavy, they were very well balanced and presented. The service was also very good. The waitress was very pleasant, suggestive, and responded perfectly to the banter my friend was throwing her way.

2014-07-18,4.0,"Creative and flavorful rolls. Good sushi, although a bit on the small side.  Same with the very inventive and tasty appetizers like the unagi egg rolls.  But this defines many good ""Americanized"" sushi places which cater to the American palate.  What sets Friends Sushi apart for me are some of the little things they do on the traditional end of things.  For example, most sushi lovers know that if you order ama ebi you can request the fried shrimp heads. They are fried and you can eat the entire head- eyes, tentacles and all. They were fried with a light touch and trimmed back tentacles that made it a delight to eat. So many places give you a heavy, greasy version that spoils the experience.  Here's my one negative:  the tables are so close together in this small space that I didn't feel comfortable .  This is not a problem at lunch when the crowd isn't as big but I stay away from here at dinner time.

2014-07-16,3.0,"I was recently in Chicago and was craving sushi. I went for a late lunch, 2:00 pm. The restaurant was nearly empty so I was seated immediately. The waitress was friendly and prompt.  Their menu is a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Some of their rolls have so much inside you can't tell what's going on. So I ordered the Mad Maki and asked what other roll I should try so the waitress suggested the Crispy Creamy. While waiting for my food, I took a peek around the interior. It's almost a modern retro, if there is such a thing. There is a lot of white but the chairs are super comfortable. My food arrived rather quickly.  I dug into the Mad Maki first. It has a really unique texture because the inside is rolled up and deepfried but then rice and nori are wrapped around that. I found it to be interesting but the flavors all get jumbled, not really in a good way. And over the whole roll is wasabi mayo. Now, I like wasabi, don't get me wrong. But whoever made that wasabi mayo....holy moly!  Quite unluckily for me, the Crispy Creamy is also drenched in it. Quite luckily, I was one of two customers in the place and I was facing the wall so I could make godawful faces and wipe the tears out of my eyes, as the wasabi mayo was incinerating my nasal cavity. I wouldn't recommend getting either of these rolls unless you LOVE wasabi or you have a cold.  The Crispy Creamy, I couldn't even tell you what was in it. It just tasted like crunchy, deep fried stuff doused with wasabi. I'd like to try other rolls in the future when I go back, I just will steer clear of the wasabi mayo.",0.9866,0.805,0.143,0.052,0.5513888888888889

2014-07-11,2.0,"Within about 1-2 miles of N. Michigan and Superior, there are a few sushi places, and we decided to try this one because yelp said it was rated high. Situated a few feet from the Peninsula, just off a very busy corner with a few restaurant, this is a non-Japanese operated sushi places that gives the vibe of a trendy place. It has this weird white-themed tables and chairs.  Tables are plastic top, and the chairs are more armchair style.  Chairs are very uncomfortable due to the low height: very tiring on the knees.  Place is a bit tight: for New York, it is actually not bad space, for Chicago, it is cozy but a bit uncomfortable. They have a ton of stuff on their menu, mostly rolls and appetizers.  We tried a few things: - shumai, - miso soup, - a few rolls, - sashimi platter, - sakes. Everything was mediocre at best, bad at worst.   Shumai was 3 out of 5, heavy on the shells, on top of some heavy sauce.   Rolls (Manhattan and King California) were void of any fish, and precisely what you would get at an above average super-market, Sashimi platter was horrible.  While there was a good selection of fish, most of them were basic fish that you can find in the frozen section.  One or two of the fish outright smelled bad. The sake I got (house cold sake) was so bad that I did not finish half of it.  I checked the rating on a couple of websites, and it was solidly rated 1.5 out f 5. All in all, this is the type of place that in New York city, would either close, or would be relegated to delivering on  seamless.com  only in far-to-reach neighborhoods on weeknights, serving mostly to corporate drones who are working late and have little to no choice. I hope this place either gets a clue and starts serving some decent food (maybe Thai?), or just outright closes down.",0.901,0.843,0.095,0.063,0.5200769600769602

Came here late evening- about 8:15pm with a reservation on a Tuesday (although it was pretty quiet, but I wanted the points), and managed to get the last outdoor patio spot. They have a very small outdoor seating section, with lights overhanging and planters. It's pretty nice, but only three or four tables out there, so don't expect outdoor seating on a weekend. The service was good, although we were told the outdoor section closes at 9pm, so we promised to be quick as not to hold up someone from going home. We ordered edemame, which was great as always, and two lychee martinis. The martinis are always spot on and really good, this time around was no exception. Along with that, I got the teriyaki chicken which was phenomenal. Absolutely delicious. I'm not super good with chop sticks, but I made do. It comes with brocolli, carrots, rice, and plenty of chicken. The portion size was perfect and allowed us to order strawberry mochi! Delicious.

It's full of flavors and I really enjoyed the green apples among the ingredients. I'm also a huge fan of spicy mayo.  Spicy Ebi - This sushi had a very slight kick to it that I really really liked . Grilled shrimp and spicy mayo. Mmm. Very delicious!  Black Shrimp Tempura - My least favorite out of three. That doesn't mean I didn't hate it! It was still really good. I probably didn't like this one as much because it didn't contain spicy mayo. Heh. Honestly, though, you can never go wrong with shrimp tempura.  Beef Yakisoba - a bit mediocre. The beef was a little bland, but at least the noodles were saucy and flavorful to make up for it. Overall, it was nothing special. Definitely spend your $12 on some more sushi instead of this!

It's been a month since I've been here and I'm still dreaming about the Friend's Maki because it's THAT GOOD. There's just something about the mix of king crab, shrimp tempura, green apple, unagi, and the wasabi mayo and unagi glaze they put on top that just makes this roll unforgettable. Even writing about it makes me want to eat it again...*drool*. I also had the ""Can You Handle It"" Maki and it was the perfect antithesis to the Friends maki.  It was spicy and hot where the Friends maki was sweet, light and creamy. This maki's shining fish it the salmon and combined with some chili oil, jalapeno pepper, more spicy sauce and unagi sauce. It was actually kind of fun eating it back and forth between the two rolls.  The 3rd roll I tried was the Tiger Eye. For me, this roll was my least favorite and the most forgettable. There was so much spicy mayo piled onto this roll that I could barely taste what was in the roll. I found it unbalanced and not all that great. But the other two rolls more than made up for it! The interior of this place is also very cool and has a futuristic feel. It resembled the scene in Men in Black when Will Smith has to sit in those egg seats and take the test...but these seats were more comfortable :)",0.9751,0.844,0.124,0.032,0.5603225806451613

This place gets packed and people even order to go! But not to worry, it's not THAT bad, I waited 30 minutes. The sushi here is pretty good!

The gyoza is nothing like in Japan.  Although tasty it has a strange sweet sauce and a a sprinkle of peanut flavoring on it.  Again tasty but not Japanese for sure.

Even if one was not seated at the bar, with the right seat you'd easily be able to see the chefs doing their work.  I had a Jimmai (?) roll and a bottle of Kirin. The roll was good - something in the sauce had a strong flavor that stood out with the avocado. I was hoping the asparagus / fish would have more flavor. The total price ended up being... 21 with tax? So not bad for a sushi outing. Overall I had a nice experience, the service was curteous and checked on me frequently.

To be honest, I don't understand why they have so many rolls that incorporate cream cheese inside them. Maybe it's an American thing but I requested no cream cheese for the Friends and Fire Dragon makis. The freshness and creativity of the rolls were fantastic. Although the concept seems odd, green apple in the Friend's maki gave a great texture and subtle flavor that complemented the overall taste.

We ordered drinks, a martini and just a soda, and the drinks took about 10 mins to get to us even though other tables got their drinks. We ordered our sushi and that came out pretty quick. The sushi was fresh. We got the Umi, Summer, Crispy Creamy and a veggie roll. The only one we didn't like was the veggie roll, it almost had a burnt smoky flavor which wasn't good. The rest of the rolls were amazing! We also had 2 flavors of the Mochi, both of which were good. The restaurant started to get really busy around 5:45p so I definitely recommend making a reservation.

Given that it was a very very cold night, I chose to go with spicy miso ramen (NOT recommended, as it was very average for ramen) and a few pieces of super white tuna and salmon sashimi. Maybe it was cause my last great sushi experience was in Seattle/Vancouver, but the sashimi fell a bit short. And the mochi ice cream was a let down too - the chocolate syrup tasted like cough syrup.

2013-10-28,2.0,"Made a reservation for 2 @ 5:45 pm on a Wednesday night, but turns out it wasn't really necessary since there were many empty tables. The decor of this place is kind of strange - also, the tables are way too cramped and close to each other, and I had to listen to the entire loud conversation of the table next to ours. They could probably also hear ours... and I like to have my privacy.  Even though it's a sushi restaurant, we actually did not order any sushi... we shared the agedashi tofu and each got a bowl of the spicy miso ramen. The agedashi tofu was crispy and chewy, unlike the steamy, softer tofu that melts in your mouth when you bite into it (which is the type one typically finds in traditional Japanese restaurants). I actually prefer the traditional, softer kind, so I was not a huge fan of this dish. The spicy miso ramen was definitely not worth $13, since there was such a tiny portion of noodles and barely any extra ingredients in the soup. Speaking of the soup, when they say ""spicy miso,"" I think of a spicy miso broth... it turns out it's just a plain miso broth, with a small plate of generic chili powder for us to dump into the soup... Why am I paying money for something that I can probably make myself? Plus, they didn't even give much chili powder (barely changed the flavoring of the soup), so we had to ask for more. Don't come here if you want to have an intimate conversation (or even be able to hear your dining companion over the loud noises of other tables). Don't come here expecting to get full without ordering multiple dishes per person & spending a lot of money.

I went a Tuesday so there was no issues getting a table and we didn't have a reservation.  I will say the place was pretty jammed up for even a Tuesday so maybe that says something. Went with some house warm sake and then unfiltered cold sake per the waitresses recommendation.  Not bad and moderately priced. Sushi was a different ball game.  The rolls are good but the cuts of fish are small and the rolls are priced about 25% to 30% higher than they should.  My guess is this is to cover their overhead as their location is pretty choice but regardless... if you are paying for this on your own you are going to drop some coin.   Here is what we all shared: * Ikura (Nigiri) - Salmon roe.  Amazing * Hotategi (Nigiri) - Scallops.  Get you some.  Buttery and smooth.  Get you some * Unagi (Nigiri) - Baked Eel.  If you don't like this you are no friend of mine * Fujiyama (maki) - we did it less the Mayo.  I hate how fat boy some people get with their rolls that have cream cheese and mayo.  We are better than that America * Fire Wing (maki) - solid roll.

The important stuff and why we were here, for sushi!! It was no Coast nor Toro, but it was pretty good. I had the much talked about friends roll filled with shrimp tempura, eel, cream cheese, red tobiko, crunchy stuffy and it was absolutely delicious but for $14 it better be. All their special rolls that we ordered looked and tasted pretty good. My issue was more with the simple rolls that they were a little over priced, like a spicy salmon was $8 and a simple tuna was $8 as well, which is a little too steep for simple rolls. I guess overall, the quality was good, but a little too pricey for it was since it didn't taste the freshest. My friend had a piece of hair in her roll so that immediately ruined my appetite.  The one good thing about this place is the service, the ladies working there are super sweet and brought out all our sushi at the same time. When our check came, they were even nice enough to split the bill for us without us even having to ask. Overall, Friends sushi, you're definitely worth trying at least once but I'm not dying or craving your rolls enough to be back anytime soon. If I'm in the area, I would definitely go again. Plus, you're a close walk to Sprinkles cupcakes which is always a plus.",0.9984,0.716,0.251,0.033,0.49385185185185193

2013-09-08,5.0,"This is now my go-to sushi place for when I'm downtown, and I'm so glad I found this place.  I was looking for a sushi restaurant my husband and I could go for our anniversary after we went on an architectural boat tour, so it had to be near Michigan Avenue and the river. After doing an extensive Yelp search, Friends stuck out as a good option.  I made the reservation online for 6:30 on a Saturday night. We actually ended up getting there a little early, but they were able to seat us right away. There were a couple of other people in the restaurant, but it wasn't super crowded. I'm glad we had a reservation, though, because the place did fill up by the time we left.  I really liked the decor. It's cozy and modern at the same time. There were little candles on the table, which I thought were romantic. I actually really liked the chairs. I know a lot of Yelps were complaining about the chairs that they didn't have back support, but whatever, grandpa or grandma, I thought they were fine. Sure, they're not the type of chairs you can slouch into, but slouching is unflattering so you shouldn't be doing it anyway. For drinks, both of us got some kind of pear martini. It was really tasty and went well with the food. All of the food we ordered was excellent. For an appetizer, we had an order of seaweed salad, gyoza and shrimp and veggie tempura. Everything was tasty. I especially liked the batter they used on the tempura. It had the perfect crunch.  For an entree, my husband and I split Philly, Crispy Creamy and Asparagus Beef rolls. All were exceptional. That Crispy Creamy roll just melts in your mouth. Delicious!  I thought the service was really good. Our waitress was nice and attentive. I suppose the one snafu of the night was when it was time to get our credit card back after paying the tab. Our table and two other tables had their cards switched. It wasn't a big deal, but I still don't like someone else seeing my bill or credit card. We had a really great time and will definitely be back.",0.9959,0.778,0.179,0.043,0.5638053467000836

The decor is unique as they have low back and high back seats (more like barstools), tables are not square shape but more of geometric shapes. Pros: Calamari - grilled calamari was different from traditional restaurant fried ones. These were chewy and felt more like a cool appetizer which was creative. Tiger Roll was alright. Had too much sauce that it really suppressed lot of the natural tastes within the sushi.  Cons: Tables too close together. Despite sitting fairly close to our table, we were still almost grinding the next table's chairs. Staff - they seem to have 2-3 dedicated servers, a host, 2 sushi chefs, and a floating manager.

However, Friends had good reviews and we were excited to be in Chicago so we went ahead to try it. MISTAKE! Positives: The mango martini was very tasty and well made. The Malbec was also very good.  The environment and decor was very trendy!  Negatives: We started with the Firecracker appetizer. It was difficult to eat and the rice cake it was served on was just bland and noneventful. The actual filling wasn't tasty either. It was too creamy and the consistency was just off.  Between the two of us we had 4 rolls. Mad Maki roll, which was waayyy too creamy, the spicy salmon roll, which had  too much crunch, the Spider roll, which tasted like they have never changed the oil, and the crunchy tuna roll, again wayy too much crunch! The rolls were not rolled very tightly and we had such a difficult time picking them up and fitting them into our mouths. We looked like animals trying to eat these rolls! We ended up finishing about 2 rolls between the 4 and asked for the check. Unfortunately, they were just terrible tasting. Our stomachs were bothering us before we even got up from the table.  Adding insult to injury they charged $1.00 for a small side of spicy mayo. Seriously!? It's a type of condiment!  I also didn't appreciate watching the servers and sushi chefs taking saki shots next to our table, which was by the bar. This is a no no in PA and even if it was permitted by law it's just sloppy looking especially after our server told us the bar was closing. I guess they believe in the waste not, want not expression. Also, the high top seats we were seated at were very uncomfortable. We're not itty bitty people but we're also not mammoths. The entire experience was just dreadful.

It probably looks nice while it's empty, but it seems like there wasn't a lot of thought put into things like personal space and storage. The staff looks like it's struggling to figure out where to put stuff. The guys behind the sushi bar don't really talk to you while you're sitting at the bar which is a bit strange. They operate as if they're running a backroom kitchen, focused on getting the sushi out without necessarily speaking with the people in front of them. I only interacted with the waitresses, which is fine but makes the place seem frenetic. They have a lot of volume there but seem unprepared for it. My main problem with it was the music. They just seem to be blasting alternative rock over speakers overhead which kind of kills the experience. Lighting is kind of harsh and not really though out.

Bert's skills are evidence of good training. Chef Manlai and Ken have also done a good job when Bert was busy.   The best thing about the fish they use for sashimi & nigiri netta = Always FRESH. They have a great selection of fish and they sell so much that they are constantly cutting fish.  I believe they go through 8 - 10 whole hamachi per week, double that with salmon and tuna (for those who don't know - that's alot of fish compared to most other sushi restaurants.  Every time I go there, they are cutting more fish! This is why their sashimi and sushi netta are always fresh.  The biggest enemy of fresh fish is slow restaurant business.  Restaurants that are always struggling to stay busy have a hard time keeping their fish fresh.  This restaurant doesn't have that problem.   As for the non-food related things, this place has a trendy vibe with upbeat music.  If you're looking for a traditional Japanese restaurant that plays koto music and has a peaceful surrounding, go elsewhere.  If you're looking to have a good time with friends and great sushi, you won't go wrong here.  It is small, so prepare to wait on busy nights.  Lastly, I like that they stay open until closing (no breaks between lunch and dinner),  They also open until 11pm on Fri and Sat for those late eaters.",0.9959,0.808,0.164,0.028,0.5147435897435897

Probably not the best place to bring your parents if they are older and not into 'scene' type places. The food and service were great. It took a while to be seated but our waitress was quite nice and attentive. My sister ordered the Salsa roll based on the waitress's recommendation and she loved it. One thing I appreciated was the prices on the veggie maki, since some places- especially in the River North area- gouge you and charge you similar prices to the fish, even though cucumber and whatever costs about 1/10 of the same portion of salmon. The kampyo roll was fantastic and the Veggie 7 roll was great. I felt pretty full with the veggie and half the kampyo (shared with my sis).

I got the large chirashi which was excellent.  The sushi rice was perfectly seasoned and well made.  The selection and cut of fish was fantastic and plentiful.  They don't include any of the Japanese vegetables that a lot of places do, but seem to make it up with more fish.  No complaints about that - just a note for those interested. One of the highlights of the evening was the appetizer we got which was a cold spinach roll which is basically cold compressed spinach in the shame of a roll.  It sits in a serving of cold peanut sauce.  OMG - I could have had 6 orders of that and been totally happy!  A must have by far!

Wait, I lied, the tables, man are they freaking small and the sushi comes on very large plates (at least when I'm ordering sushi). They are oddly teardrop shaped and the menus are long and narrow; suffice it to say I wore my beer before we even got the food. The determining factor for me in judging good versus great sushi is the freshness of the fish and the creativity of the maki rolls. The fish was fresh and they offer a good variety of rolls. Two things I don't like in my sushi rolls: unagi and cream cheese and I would say about 60% of the rolls have one or both. We ordered the seaweed salad that was tasty, the firecracker appetizer that was a little bland, a baked roll that was delish, and a few other rolls that were solid. I liked all of them, but I want my sushi to blow my sushi loving mind.   On a side note, the sparkling sake is a new favorite! Yum!

I have been to friends sushi for three times and the previous two visits were okay. However, this time I was insulted by a server and the manager(maybe) during my dinner there.  First of all, soon after we sat down, our ""designated"" server pushed us to order several times while we were still looking at the menu. My friends and I ordered three sushi rolls, two ramen, and some sashimi as well as appetizers. The appetizers and sashimi were relatively fast. However, it took them forever to bring our sushi as we were extremely hungry at that moment. All the tables around us who came in later than us got their sushi. So when a server passed by, I asked her to speed up our order as we were hungry. However, the server stared at me and replied in a very rude tone saying that she would bring our server instead. It turned out that our sushi was ready a long time ago and our server was just waiting on the ramen so that she could serve everything together. We asked her to bring the sushi ASAP and everything was fine. Suddenly, while my friends and I were eating, a server/manager jumped into our table, and shouted to us ""is there any problem with our server?"" in an insanely rude tone. We were all shocked. So I replied that our food took forever to come and the server spoke very rudely to us. The manager replied ""maybe u should be nicer"" and left very angrily. None of us didn't know what the hell was going on and I was simply shouted twice. Friends sushi was firstly recommended by one of our colleagues and I recommend it to several people before.

I'm also not a huge fan of the interior set-up.  It feels a little too cramped and the tables are very mod and funny shaped.  That being said, the staff is lovely and the food is very tasty and fresh.

The location of this restaurant is quite empty, which scared me for a moment. A restaurant on a quiet street....seems fishy. Sunday night, this place was not crowded. The decor was absolutely adorable - it was like a kid's jungle! Even though it was like a Japanese kid's kind of restaurant, the place maintained a romantic-like atmosphere with the low-lit candle setting.  We had the Friends roll and the crunch & cream roll. Both were unbelievably creamy and crunchy, it was delicious! I don't think $14 for the Friends roll was exactly worth it  but good to know what it's like. Both rolls were loaded with tempura crumbs..yum!  Also had the red bean ice cream & banana tempura, which I don't think was worth it. The ice cream was average and even though I did like the 2 slices of banana tempura, it was not worth the price. The presentation was very plain and they could've used a whole banana.

The sauce was waaay over powering to the point you cannot taste any of the ingredients. It wasn't too spicy, but very saucy, salty and too sweet at the same time. My friend had the tempura udon, which was just ok. The tempura was a little bit over cooked.

2012-09-26,4.0,"Was out in Chicago on a business trip and figured I'll grab sushi for dinner. Was greeted by a friendly waitress and decided to sit at the sushi bar since I was by myself. What I found interesting was that I wasn't greeted or even acknowledged by the sushi chefs and even though I sat at the sushi bar, the waitress still took my order instead of me ordering directly from the sushi chef. Also when the sushi chef made my food, he didnt place it in front of me. Instead, the waitress take the food he prepared which was basically 1 foot away and then place it in front of me. Anyways, I ordered a bunch of stuff. Miso soup - good and hot Hamachi sushi - decent Spicy tuna handroll - this was pretty good Unagi roll with avocado - i thought this was average Yakuza roll - this was pretty good, similar to a spider roll Ama ebi sushi - i dont think the shrimp they used here was live. They fried the shrimp heads and give that to you separately. As for the sushi, they left the tail's shell on the sushi. When I bit into the sushi, there were like spikes on the tail or something so that wasn't very pleasant. I would pass on this. Super white tuna sushi - this was pretty good. Texture was almost melt-in-your-mouth style Banana tempura w/red bean ice cream dessert - I think the best part of this was the red bean ice cream. Didn't care much for the tempura banana. A bit soggy actually. Total damage was close to $70. The waitresses and some of the sushi chefs were Thai. The head sushi chef is Mongolian. I don't think there was a Japanese worker there if that matters to some of you. The music they played was pretty cool, kind of like ambience/lounge style music. The bathroom was clean, had some nice freshner in there and a TV.  Oh, I saw the sushi chef that made my food start playing with his smart phone when there wasn't any orders in.

We walked in around 6:30 p.m. without reservations but were seated right away.  My first observation was that the restaurant smelled a bit fishy.  Okay, I understand it's a restaurant that serves raw fish, but this usually is a sign that the fish is OLD.  In hopes to forget about the fishy smell, we went straight for the drink menu. I ordered the house sake (warm), and my friend tried the Japanese beer, Asahi. We were both pleased with our selections.   We began with the Fire Cracker app (mixture of raw fish, avocado, scallion, creamy wasabi, and black tobiko atop shrimp chips) and an order of edamame.  The Fire Crackers had a great balance of flavors and textures, and the edamame was perfectly steamed and salted.   Next, we split the Deluxe Sashimi - a platter consisting of miso, white rice, and 15 pieces of chef's choice.  That night it was Maguro (tuna), Kajiki (super white tuna), Nama Sake (salmon), and Hamachi (yellowtail).  The fish was fresh (not fishy at all!) and stylishly arranged, but the platter only came with one cup of miso.  We ordered another cup so no one slurped solo; no big deal since the miso is a mere $2/cup.   Feeling indulgent, we asked our waitress for her two favorite rolls, and she quickly pointed out the Devil's Tuna and the Fire Wing.  At 8-10 pieces each, these spicy rolls were delicious and very filling!  My only qualm with Friends has to do with the layout of the restaurant. The quarters are a bit cramped with tables right at the entrance, pushed under the lip of the bar, and crammed into corners.  It may have been the location of our particular table, but I was nudged, more than once, by the patrons behind me. Probably not an ideal location for an intimate date, but perfectly acceptable for lunch/dinner with friends...hence the name, I suppose.",0.9912,0.781,0.16,0.059,0.5631069784915937

We ordered a bottle of sake to start.  Good nose and a crisp flavor to the Hana Awaka sparkling sake.  The sashimi combo was well presented with nice slices of fish.  We ordered a the salsa roll from the ala carte menu; succulent white tuna, cilantro, scallion jalapeno and lime juice made this a ceviche in a roll.  We finished off with another bottle of sake - Oka ""Cherry bouquet"".  Light nose with flower hints.  Cleansing finish with a lingering bit of sweetness.   All in all a good experience.",0.9776,0.819,0.17,0.011,0.4811111111111111

The firecracker was a nice mixed of different textures; crispy chip and soft tuna.  I liked the jazz roll and the big friends roll. Very unique and great looking rolls. The jazz roll was the best. I wanted another after we finished it.  We ordered other stuff, but that is the only stuff that stands out for me. The lychee martini was okay, but tasted too much like hairspray.

The miso is always delightful and the green tea ice cream is so refreshing after a big meal. I go to friends often now, and always celebrate special occasions there.  Recently, I had my bachelorette dinner there before my big day!  I love it so much, definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the city.",0.9933,0.685,0.315,0.0,0.5339285714285714

We went with the Shumai appetizer, which was SPLENDID. Stuffed dumpling with a delicious dipping sauce. The chopsticks were also pretty legit -- sanded off nicely with some lovely nubs on the ends. For the meal, I got the Yellowtail roll, and my girlfriend got the ""Hot Triangle"" which was a combo of 3 styles of tuna. They were both delicious and prepared well -- tasted extremely fresh.

I pre-ordered online (nice feature!) and the food was just being bagged as I walked in (very prompt!).  I ordered something light: edamame and the specialty maki roll: Ticky Tacky. This was on featured prominently on the first page of the online menu and caught my eye. Ticky Tacky is crab meat, ebi, mint leaves topped with tako, wasabi tobiko with creamy wasabi sauce.  For the price, I was unsure if my crab was real crab? It wasn't very sweet tasting. I sure hope this isn't the imitation crap errr crab! Also, where was the mint leaves?

I had yelped this place and was a little hesitant after spotting Friends Sushi from across the street, but trusting the reviews, we went inside and were really surprised.  The place was rather small, but the design was so modern and pretty.  The plates were also very fresh and uniquely-shaped, and even the chopsticks had an earth-y zen vibe.   We went around 3 pm on a Wednesday afternoon so there were no other customers, and the workers were just sitting at a table in the back, taking what I presume was their lunch break.   Grilled calamari with spicy fresh lime sauce: Absolutely delicious.  The calamari was fresh, grilled perfectly, and the sauce was a perfect combination of sweet and spicy but with a lime kick.  The presentation was gorgeous as well-- it came in a martini glass with the calamari in little rolls grilled to perfection.  Friends Maki (specialty):  It was a crispy king crab and unagi roll, with various ingredients including green apple, topped with tempura flakes, wasabi cream, and unagi glaze.  Although VERY tasty, the only issue I had was that the fish:other things ratio was not what I was used to.  The crab and unagi was a little overpowered by the tempura flakes and rice, and the tastes were rather blended together.  BUT, the best part was that green apple kick.  Whenever I thought the roll was too heavy, I took another bite and that sweetness of the green apple changed my mind.  We also had a Winter Maki, which tasted kind of similar to the Friends Roll-- a bunch of crunch with the same sauces, but with asian pear instead of the green apple. After finishing both, my friend and I decided to order one more for possible leftovers.  Oops, there were no leftovers.  This time we tried the Sumo-Ae and I very much enjoyed the spicy mayo, but the roll was pretty similar, with the crunchy king crab and the tempura flakes.  Overall, the place was very yummy but we may have just ordered 3 Makis  that were too similar to each other. Still, I love that such a small place was so inventive with their menu-- especially with the green apple and asian pear in the rolls.  Will definitely come back again to try something different!!",0.9986,0.754,0.225,0.021,0.5198979591836735

Tucked away in a stone building, it can be easy to miss.  Once inside, you will wind it hard to forget.  It is this cool little mod/pod of white and candlelight.  Cool ambiance. Our table wasn't quite ready, so we set at the super small bar and I ordered a lychee martini.  On an empty stomach, it packed a punch, but I sat down and ordered another!  Speaking of sitting down, the chairs were cool to look at, but just as others have mentioned, they are incredibly low, small and uncomfortable.  There's no way that my long legs were even at at 90 degree angle.  Luckily, we were distracted by some killer sushi. We settled on hamachi jalapeno, pan fried dumplings and miso soup.  All excellent and well seasoned.  I can't remember all the rolls we had, but I know one was spicy tuna.  We cleaned our plate. The ambiance was so inviting that I temporally forgot about my numb butt and ordered one final cocktail for the road.   This place will continue to be on my Chi-list!  I love eating in this town!",0.8992,0.729,0.15,0.121,0.6101111111111112

Everything about the experience, from their user friendly website, to the fact that when I called to make sure I was in their delivery range, was a pleasant experience.  But it was the food - the FOOD that I am here to rave about. Is it possible to have sushi delivered artfully? beautifully even? Yes! Is it possible to have the hot stuff hot and the cold stuff cold in the very same bag? yes!  Among the plethora of dishes that I ordered, where a few complete standouts; the crispy creamy roll was a confection of hot, spicy , savory a little sweet crab , shrimp , tobiko and some sort of amazing sauce with a help of Panko like crumbs that should have been to much, but my guests ate every bit of it. The perfectly executed dragon roll that came curled in its take out box. the perfectly rosy beautifully cut Maguro, the Salmon Sashimi that was dotted with jalapeno slices.

Both were delish! We gobbled them down and ordered 4 more rolls and two pieces of toro sushi. Our waiter told us the toro was about to turn and he didn't feel comfortable serving it. Wow, I'd never had a waiter be that honest! So we skipped the hunk-o fish and anticipated our rolls. Before the maki was complete our server came back with a special sushi the chef made just for us on the house since they didn't have the toro.

2010-07-02,2.0,Yelp doesn't normally steer me astray but I've got to say that the general reviews on on this site for Friends Sushi were totally off. The fish did NOT seem that fresh.  The service was NOT that great.   It is NOT that inexpensive. I wouldn't even consider it a value. I'd rather pony up the extra $ and spend it at South Coast or Mirai where I know I'll be getting a quality product that's worth paying more for. You see I'm not a sushi snob. I've picked up a party tray from Costco and happily devoured every last California roll.   On the other hand I've had enough sushi to be able to differentiate between fresh and stale. I've also had enough sushi to know that finding a crab shell and a shrimp tail buried inside your roll isn't status quo. Out of the 4 rolls I had two were infiltrated with part of the fish that shouldn't have been there.  I was disappointed at first thinking that cracking my tooth on a small crab shell was an honest mistake. After bringing it to the attention of my waiter he said he would bring it to the Chef's attention.  You've gut to guess how sad I became after biting onto a shrimp tail 5 minutes later in a different roll.  That's not a mistake. That's just lazy prepping.  The place luckily gets two stars only because of the interior design and the fact that they comped my two rolls (after much complaining and tough negotiating).,0.9805,0.763,0.161,0.076,0.5630952380952381

I crack myself up. But really there is no way, in this small sushi joint that you can not bond with your friends, because, with a packed house it was still pretty quiet, and you are ridiculously close to each other. So if you hate the people you are with, don't come here. And find better friends. Meet new ones at Friends. Okay, maybe I'm just trying to measure how many times i can say friends. Okay, on the food........ The menu, for a tiny place is actually quite extensive, and extremely inventive. The Jazz roll was out of this world. It features ""salmon, cucumber, avocado topped with king crab, seared spicy scallop, masago with a special house sauce."" MMM. My friends didn't get to try it, because I devoured it. The Sumo-Ae was one of the best rolls I have had in my life: ""shrimp tempura, soft shell crab tempura, cucumber, avocado, radish sprout, cream cheese, scallion topped with orange tobiko, tempura crumb, spicy mayo, and unagi sauce."" Can I get an Amen? There were not so hot things too, the miso was sort of blah. And our waiter was a pretentious blob of unfriendly-non-friendlike-complainy- poopyhead.(TM)  But overall......

Tuna, salmon and avocado on shrimp chips. Those shrimp chips are fantastic. Asparagus and King Crab Salad- Delicious. Yuzu Ceviche- Very tasty. Sashimi Salad- Very good, one type of fish is always chewy- some type of white fish. Miso dressing is great. Rolls: Tuna Lover- This would PROBABLY be good except they pour a Balsamic Dijon dressing over it. Yuck. Tangy and sour over a fresh roll? Get it without. uckkkkk. Hot Triangle- Tuna, Super White Tuna, Albacore. It was good, nothing to write home about. Spicy White Tuna- Our favorite, the least going on.

The rolls that we got were both unique and delicious.  The jazz maki was really unique with its salmon, king crab, seared scallop, and house special sauce.  The crispy creamy was a favorite as well - I can appreciate any maki that can incorporate parmesan cheese and still taste really really good.  We also ordered a salmon avocado roll that was not too special, but how special can you get when you order a roll that consists of salmon and avocado?   You can tell that Friends uses fresh ingredients and is willing to take risks on its creations....I definitely recommend going here if you're in the area and are looking for a reasonably priced sushi meal.",0.9953,0.718,0.27,0.012,0.5862554112554111

Alas, the gleaming paint job hasn't yet translated into a bustling trade. I was really happy with the ultra, lux, edgy, clean, modern, star trek like feel. Everything from the table, lamps, floors, front door and logo just complements each other. -=Sake=- We had the sparkling semi filtered Sake... both where awesome and sweet. This is the ideal drink to have while having sushi in my opinion. I see Red wine for the more full body means such as meat as to white wine for fish or veggie course like meal. But in this case, the sparkling Sake brings out the flavor to a new enrichment.  -=Sushi=- Everything taste a hundred times better that it sounds. We removed the cream cheese as that is simply the Americanized modification... if you think about it... majority of Asian food and culture does not consist of dairy products. Each roll provides a different texture. We had three Signature rolls and one traditional Roll.  I would love to suggest the following rolls. **JAZZ - Salmon, Cucumber, Avocado, Topped with King Crab, Seared spicy scallop, Masago with a special house sauce.  **Friends - crispy king crab, cream cheese, sriracha sauce, green apple topped with unagi, avocado, tempura crumb, red tobiko, creamy wasabi sauce, and unagi glaze.  **Crazy Winter - crispy squid, shrimp tempura, asian pear, avocado, cream cheese, black tobiko, topped with tempura crumb, creamy wasabi sauce, unagi glaze and spicy mayo.  **Spicy Super White Tuna - super white tuna, scallion, and spicy mayo.

2009-12-08,4.0,"I'm from California where every sushi restaurant has their own special rolls and most of them are Korean run (not that that's a bad thing).  Friends sushi is a kind of sushi restaurant you don't see too often in Cali, namely a sushi restaurant designed by caucasian yuppie folks for caucasian yuppie folks.  2001 Space Odyssey interior decor aside, the sweet sauced gyoza and the miso soup in a cup will be sure to keep most informed Asians (and definitely all Japanese people) away.  Nevertheless I trusted the reviews on this site to venture out to fulfill my craving for decent sushi in the blistering cold Chicago (a trip to the ice-ages for a Californian) winter night. To my pleasant surprise, the Sushi combo was amazingly solid.  Wherever Friends Sushi sources their fishes, they make sure the selection is fresh and delicious.  The buttery hamachi was full of flavor and as good as any sushi I've had on the westcoast.  Sure it's not as fresh as the renowned Tsukiji Fish Market sushi I had earlier this month, but I was not expecting this level of sushi this far from any ocean coasts.  If I had to complain, the rice was a bit dry and was not seasoned as one would have liked, but the end result was that I still had a satisfying sushi experience.  I'm sure their roll selection is dependable as well. It all reinforces my theory that a sushi restaurant in the end lives on its quality of its main ingredients, and establishes my ideal of a solid B-level sushi restaurant resembling a solid B-level action flick.  Friends Sushi is like the hit action movie Taken which exemplifies the gratifying B-action flicks.  The plot can be excruciatingly cheesy, the dialogue unrelentingly cliche, but give the viewer some good, solid, uncompromising action sequences and the audience will leave satisfied.",0.9948,0.749,0.217,0.035,0.6002645502645505

Nothing much to look at. Imagine my surprise when I returned a few months later to find it the exact opposite: bright and white like it was lit by sunlight (yes, I purposely made that rhyme). A little overdone in my opinion, but maybe they were just compensating for the way the restaurant looked before. Anyway, on to the food. This remains one of the best sushi places in the Mag Mile area for value. Considering it's just 2 blocks off Michigan Ave, you get supremely fresh, creative sushi at very reasonable prices (Kamehachi, please take note). I particularly enjoy the Friends roll (apple!), Crispy Creamy (who doesn't love those textures?) and Jimmai (because when I grow up and have babies, I will name them Yellowtail and Hamachi). On the ""traditional"" side, I enjoy their Rainbow roll, although it's one of the more expensive ones I've had in Chi-town. But it's a good way to sample their fish selection.

For starters, we ordered the Scallop Butter Yaki.  When it arrived, we both thought it smelled a little fishy.  But it tasted amazing.  The scallop and mushrooms are served in this delicious butter sauce.  I wanted to eat everything with that sauce.  This one is a must order.  We also tried the Yuzu Ceviche, which was good, but not something I'd need to order again. For our main sushi items, we ordered two from the ""Friends Signature Maki"" section: the Jazz roll, and the Hot Triangle.  I just ate this for lunch today, but I really want another Jazz Roll right now.  Another must order.  The Hot Triangle, I will definitely also order again.  We ordered a few more rolls and some sashimi and all the fish tasted fresh and delicious.

Very spicy, but the flavor of the fish still came through. I had the red spider roll which was solid - not exceptional, but still tasty. Nigiri was nice and fresh. Service could have been a little more attentive. Our waitress seemed a bit distracted. I hate to nitpick, but why is the busboy dressed like he just walked in off the street? When the rest of the atmosphere is so chic, it's jarring to see the guy pouring my water dressed in baggy jeans and sneakers. It was just kind of off-putting.

Making matters worse, the greeter (who identified himself to us as the evening's manager) tried to offer me money for my cab fare, which on its face might seem like a gesture, but when he pulled his own wallet out of his pocket, it seemed dismissive and rude in context with his words, demeanor, and the overall situation.  I declined his offer.

Jazz roll: 4 stars: A crowd favorite! --------- *Sushi so good here we decided to order two more: Jazz roll, which didn't come out the same as the first one. They didn't add the masago with the special house sauce and roe on top. This time it looked like they only topped it with imitation crab or something. Tuna Lover, which was not good at all. I think the balsamic dijion sauce in the roll killed the flavor of the fish. ----------------------------------------------------- My favorite was the ""Hot Triangle"" just because I love tuna and this roll had three different types.

2009-03-17,4.0,"For good sushi, there can be some stellar standouts in Chicago, and Friends [along with newly tested Rise (Southport & Roscoe)] may take the cake for sushi worth returning to.  Friends gets the edge, however, as it is much more intimate, less expensive, and has at least an equally diverse menu.  I left a star off for 2 1/2 reasons. One: they were out of Toro (tear).. Two: the chairs are cushy, which is nice, but slightly small (and I'm an appropriately weighted 5'9""), which could be difficult for some oversized eaters.. 1/2: I can see this place getting very packed very quickly, so look into reservations. However, in response to the lack of Toro the server immediately offered up an alternative of Uni, which I had never had (and loved - although the girlfriend was -to say the least - not fond of).  This is tied into one of my favorite (or most important) parts of dining out, which is a knowledgable staff...  [See, when the staff (and most importantly wait-staff) knows about the product they're serving, they are more likely to be passionate about the product, test the product, like (or love) the product, and therefore make great suggestions and answer questions that can help guide the consumer, whether he or she is informed or not.] Back to the fish.  The maki selections are really flavorful, diverse, and approachable if you don't eat a lot of sushi...  We had some versions of Tuna (one was spicy and topped with tobiko, my favorite) and something else, but I don't remember - she liked it a lot though. However, the Nigiri (avg. $6 for 2 pieces, not bad) was where Friends won me over.  As I already mentioned the Uni, the Hamachi (yellowtail) was fresh and very soft, but the Smoked Salmon (which apparently came from Germany, appeared fresh - as opposed to smoked - tasted smoked) was absolutely perfect.   Edamame appetizer at $4 was plentiful, chilled and salted, and large House Sake at $14 is a pretty nice bargain for Rush St.   Thinking more about it this place is really legit. The wait staff was totally cool and completely laid back, with a lax (if any) dress code, which I am a huge proponent of.  The music was upbeat electronic instrumental and I regret not asking the hostess who it was (as from my table view, I could see it was playing from an iPod).  I'll definitely return the next time I'm in the area.

Gross.  Disgusting. Foul.  When the scent of old fish wafted up from the plate, I knew there was trouble, but I thought maybe it was from something someone else was ordering.  Not.  The first bite was clearly fishy.  Their buyer must have worked in a bait shop before coming here, because he sure ain't no sushi chef.  The guys behind the counter must be suffering from head colds, since to let this detritus slip by must have required either a viral infection or years of chemical destruction of the olfactory nerves. I choked down two more pieces.  It's kind of like a car wreck . . . horrible, but you need to look back a couple of times to confirm the horror in your head.  In this case, your mouth.  No amount of soy, wasabi, or ginger could help.  I was doing sake shooters to clear the palate.  Leaving more than half the order on the plate, I begged to quickly pay so I could get out.  On leaving, I realized that in the interests of quality assurance, I should mention something to someone.  I chose my youthful waiter.  Upon sharing my culinary vivisection experience after only a few bites, he dutifully said, 'I'm sorry"".  Gosh.  I felt all better after that.  And came right home and wrote this.

The music blares from the stoop on Rush and walking inside is like walking into a womb. A very modern womb-like submarine with dazzling sushi chefs and cushy white pod chairs.  My coat fell to my feet. Oh wait, the hostess took it. And we were seated and starving. The miso soup was perfect (though it's hard to go wrong, right?), and we ordered four rolls. I asked my dear hubs to do the ordering and he nailed it. Emi maki roll, salsa roll, crunch roll, tuna avocado roll. I want to take them all home with me and just look at them more. They were perfect. Really. Our server was exceptional, and giving with banter about their tea. It's imported from Japan and a blend of three green teas and grains of brown rice. As good as what hubs gets from Todd & Holland. Well, better of course.  And he knew his shit. We loved him for it, and we'll be back. Shhh. . . don't tell anyone.

The bean-shaped tables and the retro chairs would fit well in a nightclub or bar which made me skeptical about this place -- did they put all their effort into making the place look good so they could skimp on the food? Luckily, they did not. Friend's specialty sushi rolls and generous serving sizes were unexpected surprises. We ordered 3 specialty rolls ($12-15) and they were about 10 pieces each! Each roll was decadent and rich: two rolls had cream cheese and all of them had some fried component and were topped with thick, rich and delicious sauce. While it wasn't the light, healthy sushi dinner I had anticipated, it sure was satisfying.  We also ordered hamachi sashimi, yuzu ceviche, miso soup and fried banana with red bean ice cream dessert.

Yes, they make a mean lychee martini and to boot, cocktails as good as a Peninsula bellini. A warning on the décor, unsightly to behold, I wondered if their decorator was blind, or just old. Note to manager: Mork and Mindy is just a TV show. No need for a reenactment, padded walls, nor seats so low. But the food itself isn't as cringe-inducing as its environment, And the servers have absolutely lovely temperaments. Those niceties aside, if you're looking for some dinner tips, definitely try a Firecracker of avocado and salmon on shrimp chips. Never forget that appetizers are the highlight of this River North nook. Also, please don't go without ordering Scallop Butteryaki. Succulent mushrooms, perfectly tender and expertly cooked, this dish more than redeems any underwhelming maki.  As the rolls were ordered, consumed, and occasionally panned I realized the strength of this spot lies in a secret skill: To use creamy or spicy sauces with a heavy hand, and artistic, inspired plating to mask fish otherwise bland.

2009-01-18,3.0,"I can honestly say this was one of the ugliest places I've ever dined at... Everything is just very... white. Mental institution white. The space is awkwardly set up, but given the dimensions, I don't see a better way to arrange the tables. Speaking of tables, they are terribly small, bean-shaped, and low to the ground. The stools (yes, stools, not chairs) are also way too low and unsteady, making for a very uncomfortable dining experience. To best visual the decor, think of a bad 1970s sci-fi movie where we see a glimpse into what life will be like in the year 2000 (you know, robots and flying cars, of course).  Although the food was good, the interior just really dragged this place down for me. For starters, the Scallop Butteryaki was well-prepared and presented, and the Fire Cracker (fried shrimp chips topped with salmon, tuna, avocado, and spicy mayo) was pretty good. The Hot Triangle maki (tuna, super white tuna, albacore tuna) came with a pretty hot spicy mayo, which was good, but had a strong jalapeno oil aftertaste, and the Jimmai maki (hamachi, grilled asparagus, cilantro, topped with sea bass and ponzu) was very well prepared and delicious. Unfortunately, our server failed to inform us of the specials, one of which included a hamachi maki we certainly would have ordered had we been aware it was available.  Also, the martinis are very sake-based, which can be a good thing, but my Jasmine Kiss (sake, bacardi, jasmine syrup, pineapple juice), was just a little off.

The bathroom has been designed to be funky as well, but was dark and dirty and sort of gross.  There was also loud, rhythmic music being played.  It was all very odd, especially in combination with the staff, who were wearing casual clothes like jeans and polo shirt and t shirts.   I ended up getting the steamed sea bass instead of the Bento box (who can resist sea bass?), and it was very disappointing.  Look, I am a person who goes to cheap thai places and adds salt to my food.  When I sprinkle my popcorn with salt, no one else can eat it because it makes them recoil.  I could drink miso all day from a bottle.  I am a salt fiend.   So when I am served something that is too salty to bear, that's a big deal.  This sea bass was in a sauce that not only tasted like it was from a bottle but was so salty I couldn't even taste the sea bass.  They really ruined a great piece of fish.   Shame.  Service was generally very sweet and friendly.  My plate and water glass were covered with oily fingerprints (and I mean covered), which is sort of gross, but I don't know whose fault that was.",0.6218,0.779,0.12,0.101,0.5783571428571428
2008-05-22,2.0,"It really pains me to do this, but I can not let you get away with this egregious mistake. If i pay 12 dollars for a roll, I expect my seaweed to be firm but not chewy.  Chewy seaweed is the ultimate killer of the sushi experience. You were probably having a bad night, but the crazy summer roll had way too much sweetness and not enough quality ingredients.  (The tako had the consistency of rubber). I will give you a 2 for the nice appetizer.  The tuna and salmon on shrimp chips tasted all right and if not for that, I would have had an awful dinner.",-0.9481,0.734,0.065,0.2,0.6402380952380953
2008-05-18,4.0,Convenient location and second only to Butterfly Sushi.  The Sumo Ae is great! Lots of tempura flakes on top and great taste.  Tried the Crispy Creamy roll too and it was awesome as well... Cool decor.  Def. give it a try!,0.9515,0.673,0.327,0.0,0.6642857142857144

2008-05-10,5.0,"This is one of the best sushi places in the city, in my oh-so-modest opinion.  The prices are great, the service is cute (oh OKAY the service is competent too, I guess the more important of the two) and the food is fresh and delicious.  I usually go here for lunch and order one of their lunch bentos. I loved the original dark wooden deep and sexy vibe, but it looks as if they have spruced it up with an all white decor.  Sucks for them if you get a clumsy loon like me in there sloshing soy sauce all over, but it's very modern and cute.  Reminds me a bit of Milk in San Francisco.   Anyhoo, I digress...Eat at Friends.  And gawk at the tattooed server.",0.9767,0.741,0.237,0.023,0.566984126984127
2008-02-23,5.0,"This place is just great. Great service, great food. I dare say that this may be my favorite sushi spot, in the city, and this is based on the phenomenal sushi and lovely service.  Went here last weekend  and will for sure go back. Once seated and having a drink, our server asked if we could move to a different table due to a larger group coming in.  She stated our drinks were on the house. Very classy.  Started with the seaweed salad which was good. I've had better but it had a nice balance to it and very refreshing. We had been walking all day in sub-zero weather so opted for something spicy. Some places create fictitious disclaimers that an item is ""spicy"" and you're left underwhelmed.  These really delivered. The heroine, salsa and crazy summer makis were exceptional. I love spicy and this left me flagging our server down for more water.  A lovely woman who I assume was the manager came to our table numerous times to see if we liked everything and to get our opinion on the maki. As we left we were offered a Japanese candy which had the texture of a gummy bear. Even this was delicious. Really one of my favorite sushi spots downtown. ******** Got take out from them the other night. Again: spot on. Maki assembled just beautifully and melted in my mouth. Such a gem of a spot.",0.9954,0.766,0.222,0.011,0.5734567901234567
2008-02-02,4.0,"So, I'm pretty sure I came here on my very first visit to the city, but that's beside the point.  I'm very dissapoint that I didn't realize this place was so close to my apartment earlier.  I went with 2 friends and we thought everything was pretty good.  Cute atmosphere, nice waitstaff - the waiter split our check into random $ amts on each person's card and didn't mess it up).  Miso and edamame were on par (at least they weren't bad! -I mean, have you ever had bad edamame?   It's horrible, I know.  And it's not hard to prepare...)  We ordered a few rolls that were average, and some that were outstanding: Outstanding: -Namesake ""Friends"" maki roll -Crispy Creamy Average: -Alaskan (a bit different with the cream cheese) -Creamy spicy tuna So, I'll definitely be back and sure to order the friends' signature rolls.",0.9951,0.654,0.321,0.026,0.6199444444444444
2007-10-21,4.0,"I had sushi for the first time since moving from NYC a few months ago, and I was pleasantly surprised by the food at Friends.  I went in with very low expectations as I've generally been unimpressed with the food in Chicago (maybe because I have no idea where to go), but I found the rolls here to be relatively cheap, fresh, and quite big.  They also didn't have avocado or shrimp tempura in every single roll like they often do at cheaper NYC sushi joints. The rolls are mostly around $12 each, which is quite reasonable considering that they are located one block west of the Magnificent Mile.  Beware of the ""Crazy Summer"" - the little bits of jalapeno will set your mouth on fire. On a side note, I hate avocado in my sushi.  What is it doing there?!?!",-0.6047,0.757,0.109,0.134,0.5425079365079366
2007-09-05,4.0,"Update 3.18.08: In addition to my favorites, Crispy Creamy, Black Shrimp Tempura and Philly Roll, I now love the Triple Roll (tuna, yellowtail, and salmon) and the sweet potato tempura (yum!). I have never had yellowtail before, and I would have to say it is not so bad.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Friends Sushi used to be the location for Silver Spoon, and now Silver Spoon moved next door, lower level? Well, anyway... I grabbed a menu (or two) a week ago after work and decided to order from them just the other day. They have a cute little menu with an interesting selection. I'm not a sushi expert and not that brave to try anything with more than 2-3 ingredients (i.e I usually order a Philly roll, a veggie roll, etc.). This time I thought what the hell. Here's what I ordered: (1) Crispy Creamy (shrimp tempura, avocado, asparagus, scallion, cream cheese, spicy sauce, tempura crumb, topped with cheese, wasabi cream, and unagi sauce); and (2) Black Shrimp Tempura (shrimp temp, avocado, cucumber, mayo, & black tobiko). I don't know which I like better. They were both pretty damn tasty. Because of what was in it, I kept dropping pieces out of the Crispy Creamy, . Then again, I'm a messy sushi eater.  I called in for take-out, and the woman said my order would be ready in about 20 minutes. I decided to stop by about 10 minutes early just to check out the inside of the restaurant. It looked pretty much the same when it was Silver Spoon. The wait staff seemed pretty attentive as soon as I walked in, though I was only there just to pick up. I was early, but my food was ready for me to pick up and chow down.  Overall - food good. Carry-out good. Next time, I'll stay and enjoy sushi there (& hopefully not make too much of a mess).",0.984,0.82,0.14,0.04,0.520873015873016
2007-07-08,4.0,"My husband and I were hunting down a lunch spot on Sunday afternoon and came across Friends Sushi. The restaurant had a board set up outside with the entrees and rolls they offered as well as take out menus. The menus actually said the place was slated to open September 2007. It being early July they must have opened a wee bit early. ;) So we went on in and were greeted and seated right away. The restaurant itself is small but the ambience is cozy and sleek. Cold glasses of water came right away which was great considering how hot it was outside. Friends Sushi has a good selection of hot and cold items on their menu but we decided to go with a couple of their lunch combos. I got the salmon teriyaki. Salmon, california rolls, vegetable tempura, salad and miso soup rounded out my combo. I also ordered a glass of plum wine. My husband ordered the filet combo which was basically the same thing I got except his came wifh fried fish. He also ordered a glass of iced green tea. Everything was delicious. The soup, salad, rolls, tempura, plum wine, teriyaki all above and beyond what I had been expecting having not even known the place existed. We ended our meal with a shared bowl of green tea ice cream. Mmm, yummy. So for $44....not including tip we got two lunch combos loaded with yummy food, wine, iced tea and ice cream. Good eats and a great deal.  Friends Sushi is definitely going on my favorites list.",0.9959,0.799,0.201,0.0,0.5205891330891331
