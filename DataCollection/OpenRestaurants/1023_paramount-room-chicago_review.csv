There was a also a mishap with the checks and misplacing our credit card.

2017-06-02,4.0,"I'm giving this place 4-stars because we had so much fun on our first visit! We came here with a Gilt and were able to try several things on the menu, including mussels, scotch egg, poutine, oysters, fried green beans, and even a dessert! (It also included 2 drinks.) It was one of the best Gilt deals I've ever purchased.  All of the food was incredible. The portions are huge, so you feel like you're getting your money's worth. We couldn't finish everything, so I recommend ordering less than you think you'll need. Okay, I have to say that the place looks a little sketchy. If you look on their website, it looks like some elegant restaurant, but it is far from it (or maybe it's fallen from grace since opening?). In reality, it reminds me of a hole in the wall place you'd find in New Orleans. No frills and slightly run down. Also, if they're having an event downstairs, there is very little seating in the main dining area. There are only about 4 tables and some of them are very awkwardly positioned. Despite the appearance of the place, it somehow works. I think it even added a sense of adventure to our night out. The bartender is real serious about his job, doesn't seem to have much of a sense of humor, but is professional and attentive nonetheless. He made good recommendations for us and made sure we never had an empty drink. I would go back! I want more of those mussels and scotch eggs!",0.9712,0.816,0.144,0.04,0.5102441077441077

However it picked up quickly, around 11 PM with many more people. The mussels did not taste fresh but the beans and burger were great. Their collaboration beer pairs very well with the burger.  The only reason I wouldn't give it five stars is because the server gave our burger to another patron, and he started eating off of the plate and then brought it over to our table. We had to flag it for the server and ask him to get us a new burger - that was terrible. I wonder what would have happened if we didn't see that. The bartender was kind enough to comp the burger and then proceed to apologize to us and explain to the server that it was unacceptable. Also we wanted to host a party here but we never heard back from the planner.

Next time you are there, ask them if you can tour a bit of the basement. Love the tempura fried green beans to start. The brioche French Toast is heavenly.

There is something to be said about a restaurant listening to feedback as well, which means a lot to me as a customer.  The wagyu burger is perfection, as per usual. I think adding the two sandwiches back on really rounded out their menu, there are a lot of great options while also having some casual fare. Beer list continues to be stellar. Rarely a wait.

2017-02-22,5.0,"How to explain why I've selfishly justified - for years - hoarding my appreciation for Paramount's existence from all but my closest friends, foolishly thinking that it will somehow change if everyone discovers it? Because, I've told myself, it's conveniently hard to find, small, and fills up quickly with regulars who appreciate great people and great food. And beer, really awesome beer. But mostly, it's because of Bartender Russo. When we go for weekend brunch, it's quite clear that it's not just my husband and I who have fallen for her loving sarcasm and absolutely hysterical stories. And Stephen's food is probably some of the best ""pub"" food around; our favorites are the superb wagyu burger (I'm equally infatuated with the frites and tempura green beans that may accompany the burger), fish & chips, BLT and omelets - when there isn't a special. If there is a special, order it! They are fantastic and usually limited.

2015-09-19,4.0,"I've loved quirky Paramount Room since I moved 3 years ago from the burbs to my first place in the city, the nearby Echelon K Station, and discovered PR's awesome ""wagyu burger."" This is kind of their signature item, though they're a Bib Gourmand award winning gastropub and their other food is also excellent. I liked their thick juicy pork chop, Amish chicken and queso fundido. I had oysters a couple times and they were meh one time and excellent more recently. It's worth noting they have a $1 oyster happy hour 3-6 on some days. Desserts are good (cream cheese ice cream!) But the burger stands out as my favorite in Chicago. Not long ago Au Cheval got crowned the best burger in America. I've had it and it's fine, but it's a thin patty underseasoned concoction in my book. There are certain things my fellow Americans rave about (football, Miller Lite, Taco Bell, etc.) that I just don't give two hoots about and Au Cheval's hipster burger is one of 'em. Paramount Room's on the other hand is a true big pub burger and the meat seems to be lightly seasoned. This is important --- it seems many of these hype-y burger joints get by on their toppings or bacon or something...but don't season the damn meat! Quality meat is fine, it still needs seasoning! Well, the wagyu burger is moist and delicious. Served on a big pretzel bun with some kind of house made special sauce. PR is not the best at getting temps just right. A med-rare usually comes out medium or worse. Fix that and get 5 stars! Signature side tempura flash fried green beans served with a lime wedge and a sriracha-based dipping sauce are the bomb! Their fries are seriously good too. PR touts ""no crap on tap"" on an ever rotating menu of about 7 draft beers. You can also get a flight. For $5 get a PBR tallboy and a shot of house whiskey. Service is always friendly and neighborly. You feel very welcome here. The space is weird. It just has a small red/blue LED sign way up high out front of the door on Milwaukee that reads ""Lounge."" Inside it's quite narrow with a few high-top tables, a bar with maybe 8 seats and a few booths and a bathroom to the back right opposite the narrow kitchen to the left. But downstairs is a big a$s cavern with a high ceiling. I far prefer the convivial vibe of the upstairs though. Bollocks to your hip/hype-ster burger. Go get a wagyu and shut'chyer mouth!

2015-02-15,2.0,Original review is below.  I upped this from 1 to 2 stars due to the nice server that comped our meal.  Trust me I would rather pay and have a nice dinner than have a horrible experience for free. The entire ordeal still ruined this place for me.  I don't want to be the one complaining but this was out of control and unnecessary loudness from (given the explanation I got from the server) the temporary help who was bussing tables and screaming  in spanish to the cooks who were screaming back in spanish.  These guys were yelling and banging dishes so loud it ruined my night to the point that I literally had to yell back.  I'll never be back for food.  Maybe for drinks at the bar because I still nostalgically like this place for that.  I live 3 blocks away and have lived there for 10 years (been coming to this place since it wasn't even Paramount Room...I remember when it was 4-Taste) so it is hard for me to say this but it has gone that far downhill in management/ambiance/whatever.  The owner needs to either be there more and/or learn to tell his kitchen staff to keep it down to a mild roar and maybe people could halfway enjoy the 2 cool booths in the back. Since I'm taking this long to tell the owner what I think.  You need to replace the leather seats in the back.  They are getting old and ripped.  7 years it's time to spend on this.  People do notice things like this. - ORIGINAL REVIEW: Used to be awesome.

While it isn't the largest selection in town, it was all good stuff. The ""no crap on tap"" mantra lives true here.  For the first course, I had steak tartare and my fiancée had the onion soup. We shared and were both very happy with our choices, but the steak tartare was really great. If you like a little punch in your food, it is for you.  For the entree, I had mussels, while she had the fish of the day. Again, both were great, but the Mahi Mahi was the big winner. The sauce was fantastic and the fish was delicious.  Lastly, I went with the chocolate stout pudding and she enjoyed the cheese plate. The pudding had what I can only describe as a chocolate stout truffle on top, which was delicious as was the rest of it.

I first found this awesome place before moving to Chicago, and when I found an apartment nearby it was serendipity. The food is awesome, the drinks are great, the music is good, and occasionally there is something on television that I give more than half a crap about.  The best things about this place, though, are the people. There is always a friendly crowd of (us) regulars there - having a few laughs and the occasional cry. The staff, however, is top notch. April is uncanny in her ability to never be in a bad mood. Dan has a razor sharp wit and knows an incredible amount about beer. Alan is always incredibly welcoming, Mel has an infectious laugh and a killer smile, and Susie is a radiant ball of energy. The owners and other crew are also amazing.  But Danielle - Danielle! Not enough good things can be said about this one. She is always first in line for a hug - asks you about your day, your family, and remembers all of your favorite things. She has hilarious stories, is a compulsive over-sharer (which is awesome), and turns even the worst day right around. She's also a great server, but really, who cares about that?!

I tried the short rib ravioli and my boyfriend had the scotch egg as appetizers. The scotch egg wasnt even a true scotch egg, it was completely hard boiled. The short rib ravioli was undercooked. The pasta was extremely tough and almost inedible.  We both had the pork chop picatta for our entrees. It came with spinach (which was actually pretty good) and bland orzo. The pork chops themselves were over cooked, lacked seasoning and barely had the lemon flavor a picatta is supposed to have.

I was originally eyeing another stout, but our waitress nudged me towards the Arcade and I'm glad she did. I hoping to try another one of their beers on tap, but I ended up going back to the Arcade.

The bottom piece of rye is usually kind of soggy, because of all the delicious gruyere cheese and pickled sauerkraut that drips into it. In fact, I stuck my pinkie finger through it as I took a bite the other day, and it made kind of a weird NSFW noise, the sound of which I have no idea how to spell phonetically, but it was hot and great. And the top pice of rye was nice and toasted and crunchy, so you get the best of both worlds. And Danielle, one of the bartenders, is very friendly and has a fantastic taste in music, assuming you like the Stooges and the Adverts, etc.  Unfortunately, one of my friends got the pork poutine the other day and said it was flavorless. He's also a devil's advocate, though, who can't live a day of his life without complaining about something, and the Bears were losing while we ate, so I guess he needed a punching bag. What a jerk.

Well, the Paramount Room is the culinary equivalent, putting out interesting, affordable and even surprising food from a quiet corner of the city (and an unassuming facade) that matches anything its flashier competitors are doing in their kitchens and at a lower price point.  I recently took my brother there for his birthday, and started my meal with an excellent gin-based cocktail that was perfect for the summer (they have an interesting rotating cocktail list). We paired this with some bar snacks. First we had the belly sticks, two perfectly cooked pieces of pork belly with a mustard sauce - be aware each is really bite sized, and you will probably want a whole plate for yourself. We also got a small order of the tempura fried green beans, which come with a spicy sriracha sauce and a ranch dipping sauce if you get overwhelmed with heat. Unlike the belly sticks, the small order of green beans is plenty for two people.    We folllowed this up by switching from cocktails to the ""no crap on tap"" beer list (which I think is a dig not only on bars who waste their lines on Old Style, but those bars with 8 taps who choose to devote 6 to various IPA's: bad news guys, some of those are crap). I got a $10 beer flight, which brings 3 healthy pours and allowed me to try a Belgian ale, a saison, and an interesting smoked beer. We also ordered an order of octopus that was perfectly cooked: tender, rather than chewy and seasoned to perfection. Finally, we split an order of the mussels which came in a rich ale sauce with plenty of toasted bread to sop up the broth.  Finally, we finished the meal with the carrot cake and a glass of port, both of which were perfectly sized not to overwhelm us after having put away plenty of food. Total damage for an amazing dinner: $93. Just like the porsche and the volvo, I don't think you can get this much quality for this price anywhere too many places in this city. I will definitely be back! Why did they end up with only 4 stars after such an amazing culinary experience? Well, the one downside of the location is that the space itself is a bit of an oddity: the bar takes up almost the entire first floor with only 3 tables that all seemed a bit wedged in around it. There is also a downstairs lounge with more seating (and a second bar), but the evening we were there (a Tuesday, admittedly) it was empty, so we were forced to wait for one of the few tables upstairs unless we wanted to eat by ourselves. I know there is nothing the owners can do about this layout minus a complete renovation, but I still have to reluctantly take away a star.",0.9939,0.819,0.135,0.046,0.5205757575757576

2014-05-12,2.0,"Living in the Fulton River District allows for many choices of great restaurants. Paramount Room had the potential to be categorized with some of the other top restaurant/bars in the area. It's somewhat trendy, has a great vibe, nice bar scene, and is a place that you can take some out of towners as well as a stop for locals.  I would love to give this place at least 4 stars but I simply cannot.  The first time I went there was the fall of 2013. My friends and I got a booth, ordered a round of their specialty cocktails and deluxe burgers on a Friday after work. The drinks were great and the service was good at this point.  Then they brought us our burgers which we all ordered medium/rare (which is how I take nearly all beef). The burgers looked fantastic and we were all pretty excited to dig in. Unfortunately medium/rare to the cooks definition was a raw beef patty with a little browning on the outside. Every single one of our burgers was cooked the same. We promptly sent the burgers back which the server agreed and apologized about the rarity of the beef. It wasn't a huge deal but after waiting roughly 45 mins to get our cooked burgers, we were quite annoyed. On top of that, our server never came back to ask if we wanted more drinks in the interim.  We all agreed that our best option was to simply cross Paramount Room off our list and cut our losses for the night. Our bill was $90 for 3 cocktails and 3 burgers. Our server took off 10% for the inconvenience of the meal. I thoughts a 10% was a bit of a slap in the face considering how much everything cost, so I left a 10% tip which was essentially just tipping the amount they discounted.  Apparently this was not to the server's liking as the next day when I checked my credit card online, she had doubled my tip to 20% for herself! I was infuriated and viewed to never return.  Fast forward 9 months later and I returned to Paramount after other friends forced me back. I had a Reuben this time and the meal was phenomenal. It was one of the best Reubens I've eaten. However the hysterical part of this experience is that the table next to us sent their medium/rare burgers back to the cook for being undercooked! I'm not sure why they have so much trouble cooking burgers.  Overall, their food is very good as long as you don't get served a rare burger! I've been back 2 more times and will only stick to non-burgers or make sure to specify medium/well.  I would love to give them a better rating but just can't. They didn't earn it with their food or the shenanigans when manipulating my tip.  Be better Paramount Room.",0.994,0.754,0.167,0.079,0.4745885419694944

It was roomier and seemed like it'd be a good spot in the summer when you want to step in from the heat & cool down. However, my bf did say that the stairway down smelled like a mixture of the chocolate factory nearby & a fishtank. I can't confirm as I had a stuffed nose.  After a day of drinking at the game we decided to give the 'ole livers a rest but the beer list looked pretty decent.  As for food, the bf had the fish & chips with fries and I went with the burger & fried green beans.  The fish & chips were good size and nicely battered. The coleslaw that came with it was good but somewhat bland.  My burger was good but nothing to write home about. It came with some special sauce but there wasn't much on mine so I couldn't taste it.   The green beans were better. Maybe could have had a touch more batter on them but that's just me being picky.

Every time I go in it seems worse than the last. The last time i was in for dinner the bar manager guy was working the bar and a group of his friends or something must have been sitting on the opposite side of the bar because it took him 10 minutes to come back and get my drink order. After that first drink was finished I sat with an empty glass in front of me for another 10 minutes before he could be bothered to get me another. I had to stop him from walking away after i asked for a second drink to order a burger. Someone else dropped it off, he didn't glance over once to ask how it was (overcooked has become par for the course), and again I sat without a drink as mine was finished. Now for the brunch. They replaced ALL the meat on the menu with pork belly. Its on the breakfast blt, its in the french toast. Its wiggly and gross. Go back to real bacon or at least offer it as an alternative. (the old bacon was amazing) And taking the cheddar potato cakes away and offering nothing in their place was also silly. The price has increased on EVERYTHING which is fine if the quality has gone up. It hasnt. Same for the menu, I am all for change if its positive, however it seems like a lazy effort.

It was a tiny bit expensive, but it is what it is, and since it was a good burger, I'm not going to hold that against them. I also liked the fried green beans instead of french fries - nice change of pace. The downstairs is probably where you want to be. A little more open and restaurant-y (if that's what you're there for). Otherwise, as Colleen noted some years ago, the upstairs is a pretty crammed in space with the bar and the kitchen. We were there on a cold snowy night, so I'm not sure if the place is hoppin' in the summers, but it was reasonably empty. The service was good, so no complaints there.

The stairs are really high though and i imagine the running up and down makes quickly grabbing a server passing by (or trying to) is difficult compared to restaurants with a more traditional layout. Probably why they have a separate bar down there, though kitchen only puts out food upstairs.  They have very nice and clean bathrooms that are single use with super sonic hand driers.

There are bar seats and about three booths in the bar area and that's it for seating. This place gets a lot of regulars so they must be doing something right. We had to wait about 15 minutes for two bar seats because the bartender kept giving seats to the regulars before other people.  On the the beers.  They have a ""no crap on tap"" policy and the beer list was solid but short. They also have a decent wine selection for a bar like this, and they will do half pours if you ask nicely.  The food was just okay, better than average bar food but I won't go seeking it out unless I don't have any other options. We ordered the belly sticks to start. Just two pieces of over cooked and crunchy pork belly. I like my pork belly tender and chewy. We also tried the tempura fried green beans served with a spicy dipping sauce. I enjoyed these although they weren't as crisp as I would have liked. The bf isnt a big veggie eater so he passed.  For entrees we went with the fried chicken and wagyu beef burger.

Great vibe and menu - we snagged a great table by the open window and ordered the burger and the reuben. The food looked great when it came out and the portions were generous. The reuben was great and the burger had the perfect accompaniments. Here's where we went array. My burger was ordered medium and came out rare (and yes, I know my meat temperatures as I was a server/bartender/line cook at several steakhouses for a good number of years). I am also acutely aware that some chefs take offense when you send meat back to be cooked up slightly and purposefully overcook it. Unfortunately, the grill guy had this exact attitude and absolutely charred it to the point that it was almost inedible. It couldn't have been anything but blatant, which really annoyed me, but we had a Groupon so I decided not to ask for another burger. Would I give them another shot? Yes.

The pros: We came on a Sunday prime brunch time with a big group and it was no wait. Given that it is off the beaten path a bit, it made sense.  I tried the bloody mary and it was very tasty. It was the really spicy one, and while it tasted good, it was a bit harsh on the stomach, so I'd get a less spicy one next time.   It also has a substantial skewer which is nice.  They also freshly squeeze their own juice, so that was delicious.  That's about it on the good experience.  The cons:  Overall, the food left a lot to be desired. I thought the menu was limited so not a lot of some of my favorite brunch things were available (no grits, no hash-browns, no eggs Benedict, no breakfast burrito ect...) So I got an omelet.  It was really greasy, had way too much cheese on it, it was flat, and didn't have much flavor overall. The coffee was also meh.   To be fair the yogurt/granola was really good, but I usually want something more substantial for brunch.  Bottom line....you'll get a warm plate of food that fills you up without much wait in a dark divey atmosphere.",0.7296,0.841,0.095,0.064,0.43805803571428564
2013-06-29,1.0,"Update: Came here last night with a bunch of friends to have some of those Kobe burgers, which for the record, I still find tasty. However, on this visit, service was absolutely heinous. It took around 45 minutes for our burgers to come out. I can forgive this; maybe they had to slaughter the cow themselves or something. The delay certainly wasn't due to a backed up kitchen, because the restaurant was basically empty at this point. We felt compelled to track down our waitress after half an hour; she'd been AWOL since we ordered, and we felt that she may well have forgotten our order. When we finally found her, she assured us that the burgers were cooking, and felt compelled to remind us that ""this isn't McDonald's"". Gee, how informative; I couldn't tell from the $15 price tag. As a Jew, I enjoy sarcasm, but her tone and demeanor was overtly disrespectful - I actually think her impression was that, as a group of twentysomethings, we hadn't eaten non-fast food hamburgers before. When the burgers finally did come, half of them were cold, as were the fries. Clearly, the waitress hadn't thought to check whether our orders were done, presumably because the exercise of coming up with quippy remarks takes priority over carrying out her duties as a server. Virtually every time I dine out I tip 20%, only making upward exceptions for flawless service, but on this visit, I felt compelled to corroborate her anti-youth attitudes by tipping a solidly single digit percentage.  All in all, this was a huge disappointment. I am as low key about service as I am fussy about food; all I require is for my order to be taken, for the waitstaff to remain in the general vicinity of my table in case I need something, for my food to be brought out fairly soon after it's ready, and to not be actively insulted in the process. This visit failed to meet these pedestrian standards, so I must alert the intertubes, or at least the pithy fraction of it that reads my reviews. I hate to say it, because I previously found the Paramount Room to be perhaps the most accessible of Chicago's elite burger joints, but after this visit, I absolutely cannot return in good conscience, and must actively recommend that the rest of you stay away as well. There are simply too many great restaurants in Chicago; especially within a four block radius of the Paramount Room, to spend an evening being berated by a waitress.

My beet salad was the most boring salad I've ever had.  I needed to ask for salt and pepper.  It was the beets that you get in a jar - which I'm ok with but it seems they could do better - arugula and the goat cheese was smeared on the bottom of the dish.  Zzz zzz zzz.  That was the only salad option on the menu.  The burger must have been great because he ate it all and looked happy.

2013-04-22,5.0,"I'd like some more, please. Paramount Room, there are just no words to properly convey to the masses how delicious you truly are. After visiting Paramount Room about a year ago, my boyfriend and I decided to come back for dinner and drinks this past weekend before going to the Blackhawks game. We arrived  for an early dinner around 5:30pm and we were enthusiastically greeted by the bartender as soon as we walked in. They weren't seating in the lounge area, but we were able to snag a table in the front window. The bartender was also the waiter at this hour, so he brought over a few menus and ran down the specials for us.  Paramount room has a small, rotating draught list of local craft beers as well as a few Belgian offerings. They also have a pretty impressive can and bottle list, so choices aren't limited! My boyfriend and I both found a beer to our liking, and the beers were quickly brought out to us after ordering.  As for the food, it was definitely better than memory served, and I'm already itching to go back. After Chicago Magazine showcased the Reuben here as one of the best sandwiches in the city I was eager to try it, considering that I normally would just stick to the burger. My boyfriend and I decided to split the burger and the reuben so that we could branch out a little bit, but still be able to have the burger in case we were let down by the reuben. I laugh in retrospect of thinking that we could be ""let down"" by this sandwich, as we are STILL talking about how much we enjoyed it. Anyhow, here's a breakdown of our sandwiches: 1) The wagyu burger with cheddar, bacon, and cheese: Holy bacon. Those two words together bring music to my ears. I want to say that this burger was loaded up with 6-7 pieces of crispy, thick cut bacon that was a meal in and of itself. The cheddar cheese was expertly placed below the bacon, adhering it to the burger and the bun. The beef was tasty and well flavored, but it arrived more medium-well than the ordered medium, which took a lot of the flavor and juiciness out of the burger. That is my only complaint about the actual flavor of the burger itself. As for the bun, it was soft and warm, and the complimentary red onion, lettuce, and tomato are completely unnecessary in the consumption of this wonderful burger. 2) The reuben: I just don't know where to begin--is it with the tenderness and flavorful corned beef brisket? The gooey gruyere cheese? The soft marbled rye or the perfectly pickled sauerkraut? I'm not quite sure if the deliciousness lies in one of the sole ingredients, but the sum is definitely greater than the parts as this sandwich is fantastic! You definitely have to eat this one quickly though, as the bread starts to absorb the liquid from the beef brisket and it starts to fall apart and putting it back down on your plate is out of the question. 3) The fries: These deserve their own honorable mention. They're thick cut (compared to frites) and seasoned with sea salt and herbs and served with a side of ranch (I believe) and ketchup. Very delicious and you get a fair portion alongside the sandwiches. All of the staff members from the bartender to the bus boys were incredibly friendly and prompt with their service.

The downstairs is gorgeous, but rarely open...would be a great space to rent out for a private event if they do that sort of thing. Only iffy thing I've had was the oysters -- something seemed off and I got spooked and didn't finish them. It's probably just that I used to live in Boston where oysters were super fresh and there was never any question as to how long they had been out of the water, whereas these had a texture and temp that made them seem frozen.

The location leaves something to be desired too.  There's not really a convent place to park that doesn't cost $4/hr and the walk from the blue line is a bit more than I'd want to make on anything other than a sunny, summer day.  But if it were a sunny summer day, I'd be picking somewhere with outdoor seating to hit up instead.

She was a bit sauced during the service, or so it seemed, and that made for a rough go throughout our dinner. Not only was she M.I.A. during all of the night, but the food that came out was on super hot plates, plates that sat under heat lamps for far too long. She also brought out the wrong beers on our first round, then after I said something about it she told me that she was sorry and would bring out the correct beers, ""on the house"", but forgot to hit the comp' button and they were still on my tab at the end of the night. At that point I just wanted to get going and left it at that.  As far as the food was concerned, well it was 4/5, maybe 5/5 but to hard to tell since it was dying under the lamps... I had a chance to share two plates. Here goes... A. Roast Pork with Bacon Brussel Sprout Hash. This dish was just what I was expecting. The pork was juicy and had a nice layer of fat on top which is exactly what I had hoped for. The fat just rendered so much moisture and flavor into the pork. On top of that, the sprouts were fantastic. Crispy bacon bits mixed with tender sprouts were a perfect combination and tied the entire meal together. B. Hand Dipped Fish and Chips with creamed slaw, hand-cut frites and malt vinegar. I saw this dish the time before while boozing it up at the bar, and knew I had to order some up for myself. Damn!! The Icelandic fish was super moist, and the semi crisp batter just held all the flavor packed tightly in. Each bite was filled with flavor, and when you mixed the fries and slaw in with the fish on a single bite you create magic. Hot damn was that good. All in all this place is a great time. They have a nice list of good beer, pour a strong drink, and the prices are very fair.

This place got a really good hole-in-a-wall dive vibe which I really liked. The wait was 20-30 mins at 8pm on a Friday night. Between the two of us, we got the Ahi appetizer (good, but not mind-blowing), tempura green beans, the kobe burger, and the fish and chips. For drinks, I tried the 3-sampler and my roommate got some unmemorable drink with a fancy name that, for $10, ended up tasting like an overpriced gin and tonic (with a splash of ginger ale).  The much-hyped up tempura green beans were just... good. Heavier than I expected. The burger was, again, good, but I've had better. The fish and chips were just okay. My roommate said his favorite part of the meal was the cole slaw that came with the fish and chips. That experience would've warranted a 3-star for A-OK... but the long wait and the surprisingly expensive bill ($80 for the two of us. with only one drink each. should've gone to restaurant week instead!) for such a ""good, but not great"" meal knocked this place down to a 4 star.

The exterior is not particularly inviting and the bar is in a rather odd location but that never deters me. As you enter you're greeted by a cozy bar area with virtually no seating other than at the bar. If you're there to eat, you're directed downstairs - the first level of which is a single table in sort of a mezzanine arrangement. As you continue down you're well below street level in a high ceiling, dark, but small dining area. It's not exactly a comfortable or warm place but OK, I can deal with that. But certainly not a place to bring a date. The beer menu was OK and the ""no crap on tap"" motto is encouraging but the selection of draft beer isn't overly large. Lots of bottled beer and cans (really?) but that's never my first choice. The draft beer I ordered was ""out"" so I had to make another choice. On to the food - I came for the Wagyu burger so that's what I ordered. People who call it Kobe beef are mistaken -  it's not. They are completely different. But it was very tasty and very well cooked. Thick and juicy but not very large in size. At $12 it was a pretty good deal. On Monday you get the burger and a pint for $12 so make a note! I added mushrooms for a buck and that really helped. My wife got it with the bacon - thick, delicious cuts of bacon. A superb choice. She started with the marinated beets which she claims was the best thing on the menu - beets with arugula, herbed goat cheese and lemon oil. I got the fries, she ordered the tempura green beans - they were good but nothing special. I've had better in cheap Chinese restaurants - but worth ordering just the same.

Gosh, it looked so good... But it was dominated by Dijon mustard.  The burger...

Yet they forgot our order. The bar tender - sweetest girl every - came out to apologize. She gave us 50% off our burgers. It was sweet of her, but not so cool of the kitchen.  The diet coke was flat - almost watery. When I mentioned this to the waitress, she explained how they don't use real coke. Disappointing to the max.  Would I come back here again? Maybe.

Of course I ordered the burger which lived up to its hype...I didn't even have to add ketchup to it; the flavor was so good. I also tried the fried green beans which were surprisingly good. It came with sriracha to enhance the flavor. They had a house whisky also that was pretty good.  Our waitress was very nice as she went over all of their specials.

No problem, we didn't mind. We simply asked the bartender what the wait would be like (place seems small with minimal tables).  I could see a continuous crowd of people dressed as from the Prohibition Era heading to the speakeasy lounge downstairs, very entertaining.  Instead of waiting for a table, we just pulled up to the bar which had some open chairs.  Be warned, the whole front of the bar and tables near the windows are cold (we went last night, mid-Jan).  Told the bartender we had a Groupon we wanted to use off of my phone (not printed out) and she said that it would work fine.  Drinks:  We both ordered ""The Skeptic"" (and we were!) I ordered mine with the cucumber vodka and my gf did the basil vodka version.  Looking at the menu the rest of the ingredients were: lime juice, simple syrup, and SRIRACHA.  Like I said we were skeptical, the bartender described it as a ""spicy gimlet."" I really wanted to order one of the draft beers but could not pass this cocktail up.  Both were really delicious.  The cucumber version providing a refreshing feeling while the basil version providing a very savory feel.  They both finished with that slight kick of spice due to the sriracha, not overpowering though.   Food: Gf orderer the grilled chicken sandwich, she really enjoyed it and noted that it was cooked perfectly.  I ordered the $10 Kobe burger and added cheddar cheese, mushrooms, and a fried egg on top (which all cost extra). I ordered it medium, though I think (as other posters have mentioned) it came out a little more done than medium (though it didn't matter). The burger was delicious and also huge! I could barely hold it properly without making a mess all over my plate.  The meat was very juicy, plenty of dressings were provided (onions, lettuce, tomato, pickle).  Even though it seemed overcooked, it still was incredible, they know what they're doing! We also ordered as sides to our meals, the french fries and tempura fried green beans.  I thought both were tasty as well.  The fries were good, better than most places, but not memorable.  I really did enjoy the fried green beans.  They didn't seem too oily or soggy, I could taste the nice flavor of the green bean with every bite.  The friend green beans came with this GREAT spicy dipping sauce.  I don't know what was in it, but all we know is that it offered some great spice and flavor to anything we put it on.   Dessert: We were both really stuffed from all the food, but I figured I had to try the ""Black and Tan Float.""  The bartender noted it was delicious and sounded that way too. Root beer soda with Guinness flavored ice cream.  How can you say no to that. It came out with some cookies as well (maybe snicker doodle? or gingerbread? couldn't tell).  It was hands down one of my most favorite desserts anywhere.  Simple, sweet, and a nice end to the night.

If you order fries 'poutine style' (which is not at all faithful to Canadian poutine fwiw), it feels like you get a dozen fries under a mountain of gross pork and melted cheese. I can't recommend AGAINST the pulled pork strongly enough. I wish they'd take it off the menu entirely. The good:  - Kobe burger is super tasty and reasonably priced. It's perfect at medium-rare - you're doing yourself a disservice if you go for well-done.  - The fries are great, as are the tempura fried green beans  - Friendly bartenders (particularly during the week when it's not packed)  - Great ambiance, whether you're in the upstairs bar area, or the downstairs speakeasy.

Bacon did what bacon does...be awesome. But there was something wrong with the fried egg, as it didnt add too much to the dish. Or maybe I was just in a Kobe beef trance.

And we got to smell the sweet sweet chocolate being made at the chocolate factory on the way.  Anyway, when you first walk in it looks like a tiny bar with a couple of booths to sit in. Bar tenders warmly greeted us within second of walking in and informed us that there was more seating downstairs. This intrigued me so down we went. Once you head down the first flight you come upon a 'platform' seating area with 4 tables over looking the rest of the underground portion of Paramount. We opted to make the final descent to the lowest level.  Our waitress, who also happened to be tending the downstairs bar, was a bit aloof. I ordered a beet salad (just saw Harry Potter and ate a ton of popcorn) and the person I was with ordered the Kobe burger. When the food arrived, our waitress decided to take a hiatus to hang out with her friends that were there. Food was pretty good. The burger is an excellent value for the money, but the beet salad (although good) was a rip off at $10, I say $7-$8 would be more in line with what it should be priced at. The fries that came with the burger - delish. We ended up sharing a dessert (mini apple pie thing) that was really good, but you could tell it was not made in house.  Service was super slow though and  due to our waitress's inability to check up on us I got my water filled up a whopping one time the whole 3 hours we were there.

We started with the oysters. I was skeptical of oysters at the Paramount, but my boo has never seen oysters on a menu that she didn't order. The good thing was that these were the largest oysters I have ever seen. The bad thing was that there was no flavor. In fact, they were the blandest oysters I've ever had. At $3 a pop, I could have had awesome oysters elsewhere. Paramount Room frequently finds itself mentioned among the best burgers in Chicago, so I had to order the Kobe burger with fries. The burger was good, not great. Worth eating? Sure. One of the best in Chicago? Not hardly.  It's a small burger on a big bun. Not quite 1980s Wendy's ad small, but seriously, a third of the burger is bread. If I want all bread and little meat, I'll go to Subway. The fries were good, the garlic aioli not so much. My boo ordered the mussels which were good, not great, and they come with not so great bread instead of pomme frites. Disappointing. Paramount Room is just ok. I liked the big beer selection and the relaxed setting. The service was good and the staff was friendly. The food was competent bar food, but nothing to rave about.

If you go downstairs, there's a cavernous seating area with a second bar, as well as a slightly strange mezzanine level with two tables that looks down on everything below. Even on a busy night, you'll probably get a seat.  The food, again, is excellent--steak tartare with a raw egg? fries made with beef tallow? (at least they were at one point--the menu no longer advertises this fact, which suggests they made the switch to vegetable oil. they still taste good, they just might be orders of magnitude more unhealthy). And the list goes on--the skirt steak and the burgers are similarly brilliant.  The beer list is fine--hard to differentiate yourself on that point these days, but it's got everything you'll need. But do try the cocktails--sidecar and whiskey sour are both among the best I've ever had, the latter made with real egg whites. Though it does come in a tiny, tiny stemmed glass, so be warned you'll look a touch dainty while drinking it.  Only thing that keeps this place from five stars is the The Noise. Good god this place gets loud on weekends. If you're downstairs on a Friday night, you'll have an awesome meal, but you'll probably be hoarse by the end of it.

2011-01-28,4.0,"A dive bar with a menu that does not scream bar food (steak tartar, pate', oysters, mussels, duck confit). This place was a gastropub before it became the cool thing to do in Chicago (I doubt its a pioneer, but it definitely was well established before it became trendy to do so) and its one that does so without the glitz and glamor. Its all about the food here (and booze, they definitely care about their booze, which is a good thing). Given that, the food here is very affordable for what you get. They have a great Kobe beef burger for $9. They also have a rotating list of microbrews that are always well selected and offers a variety of beers that you rarely see anywhere else. I believe they got rid of their $10 for a burger and beer deal (which was a steal given that most of the beers on their menu are $7-9).  My most recent visit I had the reuben, in my experience I've never had a reuben that is average. Its either terrible or spectacular, thankfully PR does it right and makes a killer Reuben. The corned beef is cooked perfectly and offers the right balance of kraut, russian/1000 island dressing and gruyere. It is a little on the soggy side due to the abundance of filling, but that is nothing more than a speed bump in consuming this massive sandwich. Toss up between the fried tempura green beans or the truffle fries, can't go wrong with either. The french onion soup is nice and rich, with a cheesy layer of what seems like a pound of gruyere. You'll end up spending more on drinks than you will on your food, but still come away with a very reasonably priced meal that will leave you full, but wanting to come back for more.

I'll admit I was hesitant at first because when walking from the Grand blue line stop, it feels like Paramount Room is in the middle of nowhere.  We went on a Sunday night and the bar was pack and felt too small and uncomfortable.  However, the server pointed us to the back where there were nice big, leather booths.  I felt a little like a VIP.  I love the ambiance of this place, it reminds me of Kuma's, a faux hole in the wall kind of joint, but I could actually hear myself think.  They played nothing but old-school punk (read: The Ramones :) ), but it was played as background noise so I didn't have to yell across the table.  In fact, the people in the booth across from us were having a beer and working on their laptops. We ordered the beet salad as an appetizer (I don't particularly like beets, but the mix of them with the creamy goat cheese was actually really good). We both ordered Kobe burgers and split a side of the tempura green beans, which was more than enough for both of us.  The meat was amazingly tender and I like that the sauce really compliments the meat rather than covering it up.  The tomatoes were huge and hearty.  They were just really really good burgers.   I am still obsessing over the green beans.  They are very lightly fried, so it doesn't taste like you're eating nothing but breading.  The spicy sauce was actually really spicy, but not overpowering - just that kind of spicy where after five or six dips your mouth is on fire, but you can't stop because it's so good. If I had to sum up Paramount Room, the words to use would be: simple, but high quality.  Everything is delicious - you can taste all the ingredients, nothing it too overpowering.  And the ambiance is also enjoyable, but not overpowering.

The fact that they actually CARE enough about how they are perceived means a lot in my book. Hence, you may want to give them the benefit of the doubt after reading this review. First, off: a couple of large parties rendered service unacceptable. 2 appetizers, a side, and a sandwich: 2.5 hours, not to mention the 20 minute wait to be seated. Horribly managed and organized either in the kitchen or with the staff, who were all very nice and understanding, but still slow. I stared with their version of a Dark and Stormy cocktail: it was disgusting. They used some kind of syrup rather than the ginger beer and black rum they claimed. I sent it back and had diet Cokes after that. Then I got steak tartar . . . I must have been high to order it. The steak was half chopped with strings of tendon holding together bits of chewy tough meat. I ate the toast points so I wouldn't starve waiting for the rest of the meal, but the meat stayed on the plate. Then the tempura batter green beans: Interesting concept- let most of the batter fall off so you have beans with occaisonal strips of batter. I had never seen that before . . . don't want to ever see it again. Their take on the 'cuban sandwich' was actually just a pork/cheese/pickle sandwich, but it was actually good as were the fries that came with it. Sadly, it was too little, too late.

To be fair, the only item ordered by my group was the Kobe Burger we had heard so much about. Everyone ordered their burger medium, everyone got their burger well done. Fair enough, this happens at a lot of restaurants. Also, it's worth noting that my dining companions asked for BBQ Sauce, Steak Sauce and yellow mustard, and they had none of them. Sauces aside, the burger was fine, the bun was terrible (Seriously, if you're going to claim to serve Kobe, it deserves a little better than what it was served on), and the fries were fine.  Maybe Paramount Room does other stuff really well, but they really seem to hang their hat on this burger (I'm assuming the neon sign for the Kobe Burger was custom made).

It's a very small, cozy, super dark, 2 floor bar.  Anyway, as we ordered our burgers, we noticed it wasn't exactly $9 for their Kobe Beef Burgers.  I believe it was $1 for extras (various cheese, bacon, eggs, etc.) and $2 for fries or fried tempura green beans.  What are burgers without fries? Let alone, fried tempura green beans?!  My boyfriend ordered his burger with fries, mine with green beans.  The fried tempura green  beans were deeeelish! Especially with a side of the aioli sauce. Oh yeah, the burger, tasted like any other burger. Nothing that sets it aside from other burgers but still tasty.  Overall, service was good. Food was good. Price for the food, I guess is average (after all the add ons) if we were at a restaurant.  I'm not so sure about the drinks, as we did not order any drinks with our meal and the visit before this one, we were already pretty intoxicated before our stop at Paramount Room. hehe :) I'm not sure if my review made any sense since I'm sitting at home, trying to find things to do whilst recovering from the flu.",0.8983,0.845,0.103,0.053,0.528888888888889

They do, on both counts. This fact alone is definitely worth a visit here. Overall, I would say the beer selection is very good. The seating is creative. I like that there are different area, both upstairs and down. I think the service was so-so. Our waitress was nice, but she had double-duty at the bar. I didn't hold it against her, tip-wise, because it's not like she was just standing around. She can only be in one place at a time. This is more of an issue the management needs to correct on how they distribute the staff. Also, it was self-seating so we picked a table. We were only 2 people, so a couple minutes after we sat down we were asked if we could move to a hightop against the wall. I didn't mind moving, but it makes for a slight inconvenience when you're on a date. if they want people to sit in a specific section or table type, then they should have someone hosting.  I will be back for the delicious burgers, for sure. I think if you come here and keep in mind the bill can add up quickly, then you can enjoy a good burger and pint for a decent price.

2010-08-09,4.0,"The Paramount Room is another attempt to combine casual fine-dining cuisine with craft beers. The proprietors have backgrounds in moderately-priced fine-dining restaurants. I stayed upstairs here. The address has been serving alcoholic beverages for about a century. For the 13 years when this was constitutionally prohibited [a lot of good that did], the ""illegal"" potables were dispensed downstairs. Upstairs is a naturally illuminated room with mostly seats at the 'L'-shaped bar. I deduce there are tables downstairs. (I didn't look.) The beers are all good solid ones, with at least one of them being a seldom-glimpsed draft in Chicago. On a second trip here one Friday afternoon, I opted for its ""burger & a pint"" special; and I got a surprise. Before 7:00 pm, you can order this for $10. Your beer will be one of the $6 16-oz. glasses. The burger is made from Kobe beef; a thicker, richer cut from, I should say, 'coddled' cows. You can add cheese for $1, and switch to tater tots for another $2. My burger came on the medium edge of medium-rare. (I specifically declined to order the cooking level.) The burger was fine. It was on-the-mark for taste. It needed no sauce or ketchup. The surprise was that Rachel, who was the bar manager for most of my years at the Twisted Spoke {and was mentioned in a couple of synopses}, is now working here. Prices are above average. But then, you *are* close to downtown. Rehabilitating this edifice was probably exorbitant. It doesn't lose or gain any half-star due to this.

There is one flat-panel television above the bar with cable TV service (I think it is Xfinity.) The venue has wi-fi access. Ask bar staff for the password. Transit options: For being as close to downtown as it is, this is amazingly limited for when you leave. Yes, you're near the CTA routes #8 Halsted, #56 Milwaukee (doh), & #65 Grand. Grand ceases at 10:00 pm, Milwaukee halts at 10:30 pm, & Halsted quits at 12:30 am.

It almost didn't happen.  We weren't even considering Paramount Room.  Our original plan was to grab dinner somewhere and then meet up with our friends after they finished roller derby.  But things got late and we decided just to go to the bar that had the after party and order food.  Well, upon getting there, we find out they don't have the dinner menu anymore.  So we left. We weren't finding anything savory around Lake and Ashland, until we got an text from our friend who suggested Parmount Room.  I'm glad it was put out there, because I wouldn't ever thought of them as a place to grab a very good dinner. Well, being the vegetarian I am, I ordered the Tofu dish with Sundried tomatoes and avocado mayo.  I was a little hesitant at first, but after tasting it, I was in love with the dish.  The tofu was soft and the avocado mayo gave it a nice creamy taste.   My friends got their famous Kobe Burger and they enjoyed it, though I did hear a slight disappointment that it was rare instead of being medium rare, but no complaints on the taste. Plus the ambiance is a unique experience.  You enter on the main floor and it looks like a bar that totally fits the area.  But you then go downstairs and its almost as it belongs elsewhere (and I can't figure out where).  There's not many places that you can go down two levels, well, the basement in cavernous.  There's a ""second floor"" on the basement level that only takes a small portion of the area.  The rest of the basement has a very high ceiling.  There's a strange blue hue downstairs which makes it a great place to be with a group.",0.9821,0.822,0.136,0.043,0.5277361111111112

We were out to celebrate a friend's birthday who'd looked up this place as having gotten excellent reviews. Based on the photos on the restaurant's Web site, she thought we'd get to have a cozy experience, something different from your usual bar/restaurant scene. Was she ever disappointed when we entered the place! As you walk in, no one greets you and you find yourself in your basic unfriendly, loud, dark bar. Eventually someone was willing to talk to us and upon hearing that we had reservations, we were taken to a tall table near the window. Do not *ever* accept to sit here in the Winter. The corner was freezing.  We all left our coats on for the entire meal, but we were still really cold.  Fortunately, I had one of those coats on whose inside comes out so I was able to put that on my lap, which helped a little.  But when we told the wait staff about the temperature, she couldn't have cared less.  To balance out the cold, I asked for some hot water. Fifteen minutes later, I asked whether I would get any hot water and was told that they had to go downstairs and slowly make it so it takes a while. I guess the additional lesson learned then is that you wouldn't want to finish off a meal here with a tea unless you ordered it at the beginning of the meal giving them enough time to make the hot water. (What restaurant can't produce hot water in a few minutes?!) One more comment on the spot. There was someone smoking three feet from the entrance several times during the night, right outside the window where we were seated. The cold was not the only thing getting through, the smoke was as well. (No one seemed to mind that it was illegal for him to be so close to the entrance.) The menu itself was intriguing. The tempura beans were not bad although nothing exceptional. They didn't have much of a taste and the sauce they came with was too hot so that left us with either near-tasteless beans or super hot beans, which is not a great choice. I had the cauliflower/cornbread option, a dish that doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. It tasted fine, but I still can't figure out what exactly was going on there. The one positive experience was the chicken liver. The portion was generous (for an appetizer mousse) and it tasted delicious with some nice bread on the side.  I waited until the morning after to write this review to see if I'd have a more generous perspective, but I'm afraid I don't.

Scuba Steve and Dave were hating on it, but nobody asked them to drink it. I had two of them.

The burger is particularly good with the fried egg, and please: do yourself a favor and forgo the fries and get the fried green beans instead. They are great with the spicy dipping sauce. The beer selection is good too. It's the only place I've seen with Old Rasputin on tap. Not that Old Rasputin is my cup of tea, but I was impressed nonetheless. Their draught list is always changing, which is another thing I like. Nothing better than finding a new, good beer! Another thing I like about this place: my group of friends and I have always gotten super-nice waitresses. They split my group's check without us even having to ask! My girlfriend, who is not a big beer drinker, wanted to try a new cocktail. The waitress just asked what kind of alcohol and tastes she likes, and she went behind the bar and whipped up a special drink just for her! I give this bar 4/5 stars because of the better-than-average food and good beer selection.

The fries are cooked in some animal lard and they don't specify this anywhere (on the menu or in person), so if your vegetarian and didn't read these reviews your screwed. Luckily, I had and asked for the meat-free version of the fries. Our meat eater friends tasted both the meat version and ours and said they couldn't tell the difference...what's the point then?? Didn't McDonalds get sued for this? Anyhoo....after politely telling the server I was vegetarian, I ordered the Caesar salad. Of course, the two didn't get comprehended because there was the sickest fish smell coming from my salad. Gross! Apparently some vegetarians eat fish. Well I don't (And yes, some Caesar's are made without anchovies. I've have it many times before). My server, annoyed but polite offered the beet salad instead. No problem I love beets. Love them. I just didn't assume that would be the only thing on the plate!

2009-11-08,4.0,"The boyfriend and I realized right around 3pm on Saturday that we hadn't eaten yet that day. Being famished we set out for a good early dinner that would leave us stuffed enough for the rest of the night. We stumbled upon Paramount Room.  Now first off- we were totally scratching our heads at first. Apparently the main area is downstairs. Upstairs (where we were sitting) there was a small bar and 2 large booths and a kitchen. Nothing else. The booths are huge and face each other- so it would be a cool spot to reserve for a party or a large group. Now onto the food. YUM! We each got a Kobe burger. Mine had cheddar cheese and apple-wood smoked bacon.. The cheddar cheese was SO MELTY and in such abundance! I really haven't had a burger with such perfectly melted cheese in every bite. It was delish! Other than to say the thing was mammoth in size, I can't give a real indication as to how big this thing was. It was intimidating. I think I ate all but 2 bites. And really, I would have unbuttoned my pants had I been eating at home. The man's burger had mushrooms. I have no idea what kind of mushroms these were or what they were marinated in but O.M.G. We were both blown away by the  mushrooms. He was kind enough to share 2 with me.  I also had a cup of their onion (French onion) soup. The piece of cheesy bread that came with it was better than the soup itself. I'm accustomed to french onion soup having melted cheese covering the top of the bowl. Here they give you a small slice of bread with melted cheese topping it- all floating in your soup. It was just OK. I wouldn't get it again.  My better half had the Tempura Fried Green Beans with his burger. They were AWESOME! They came with a spicy dipping sauce- much the consistency of hot sauce- but not quite THAT spicy (at least not to me).  OH- and they serve pickles with the burgers. I have a real issue with places that stiff ya on the pickle. These were HUGE and SO GOOD! I'd rate them as high as I rate my favorite (Portillo's).  I do plan to return, only next time I really want to try the marinated beet salad with truffled goat cheese. I LOVE goat cheese and beet salad is always delish!

Paramount Room is a fine everyday establishment.  The quality of the food is definitely above average; there are no tourists (which is a selling point if you live in River North); the ambiance is nicer than a typical bar (actual natural light in a bar/linen napkins); the staff is pleasant; and the beer selection is interesting.

Based on my desire for a dark, chocolaty beer, she recommended a porter that was yum.  Parking: a little strip lot around the corner was practically empty. Watch out... $2 an hour. Wowza these parking fees are getting out of control...  Finally, food: fries with the garlic mayo stuff... YUM. I clearly liked the green bean fries more than some of my table mates... I thought they were delicious. Mussels were decent but I'm not the biggest bivalve fan so I'm the worst person to ask. I ordered the fish and chips. They were pretty good! The fish was perfectly cooked and nice and meaty. $14 seems a tiny bit steep for fish and chips but it really was pretty good.

I got done with work early and KM and RL had dinner together. It was a very exciting night. I finish with work and quickly make my way over to PR. KM had already secured a table for us in the corner and was half way finished with his beer when I got there. Again. Raving about the burgers. How he got his with blue cheese and bacon... blah blah blah... well I found out a few things that night that I'd like to share.  1. The $10 burger and beer deal is on Monday's until 7pm only.

I don't know if I would get their special sauce again, but I wouldn't get it dressed again, (tomatoes, lettuce, onion). Mainly because when I got the burger, with the gruyere and cheddar cheese, the bacon, I quickly forgot about any veggies and had to go to work on my burger.  3. Apple. Smoked. Bacon. And a few slices to boot. No skimpy half a slice on these bad boys.  4. Fries were not particulary crispy so you may want to ask for them extra crispy, but the garlic aoili that came with them... well its addictingly good, but note no vampires will be coming near you after eating it. Well, perhaps neither will your date unless they had some too. 5. The tempura fries were tasty, but definitely shareable and should be. Squeeze some lime, the tang enhances the hot sauce you get on the side. The service was good, in fact the bartender was more than happy to shoot the shiznit on beer, the place or anything we needed or asked. Even calling over from the other side of the bar to see if I wanted another Malbec, (um yes please). No fancy stuff, but plenty of good stuff.

To make matters worse, my parents have been here several times. I'm slowly coming to terms with the fact that I didn't just stumble upon the newest cool place in River West, but it is pretty cool nonetheless. Upon entry, I saw yupsters that cursed a lot, well-mannered bikers, and the occasional tattooed punk rocker. The scene was reminiscent of another place that is well known for their burger and beer selection. What's that place I'm thinking of?  Unlike that other mystery burger bar though, Kings of Leon was playing instead of death metal. There were large plush leather banquettes and well-spaced tables instead of sardine-can-like circumstances that I can only refer to as ""eating areas"" at mystery place. The waitress at Paramount didn't seem like she had somewhere better to be, nor did it seem like she immediately disliked me for my business casual attire. That's always a nice touch.

The fries or tempura fried green beans are also $2 extra, but well worth it. And when I say ""well worth it"", I mean, you'd have to be clinically insane to not order the fries.

I had two cocktails that were just right.  They offer a great list of classic cocktails with their own take on them.  I started with the ""Elder Fashioned"", which they do right with muddled cherries and orange, then add St. Germain for an aromatic, floral compliment to the bourbon and fruit.

2009-09-24,3.0,"I tried the kobe burger.  I definitely know it ain't the real kobe burger, if it were it'd be $25 more on top of this.  But the meat is a variation of the kobe which makes it a higher quality of meat that you would normally find in a bar or pub.  But wow good burger, I had mine with grilled onions and fried egg (dollar extra, worth it!) on top and it was delicious.  My burger was cook well, not perfect but it was still medium rare but this is probably because I had the burger to go.  But the meat was just so tender, and juicy as well.  Moreso the kobe patty had a distinct spice that had a hint of black pepper and possibly cajun spice but no idea.  It was just seasoned very well!  The bread had good fluff texture and thus a great burger. I would have to say though $9 for this burger would have been great but the meat just didn't fill the surface area of the bread.  Actually I had to take a couple bites of my grilled onions and egg only to make sure the last bite of this great burger had actual kobe!  Where's the beef??  bite bite, ah there you is. But yeah it was a thick patty but rather have a smaller bun to have a better ratio of meat to bread.  Come on  I love my meat and I am not about to have an egg sandwich at the end!  This is the only thing that I'll knock on this burger. Also the burger does NOT come with fries which was a major disappointment, its an extra $2!  Whoa thats a bit much but my friend and I split fried green beans which was a choice.  It was like a tempura you'd find in any japanese restaurant but not fried nearly as well.  But it came with 3 dipping sauces (ketchup, spicy chilli, and ranch) which made it fun to eat.  But didn't finish thus tells you how great it was. Overall it was great, 25 dollars total for 2 kobes (extras on each burger (cheese and egg), with fried green beans.   This was a great burger probably in my top 5 best thus far.  I still gotta try kuma's, and couple more to solidify this.  But yes go try it if you got the money!",0.9983,0.755,0.225,0.021,0.5098824786324786

2009-08-04,4.0,"I often dream of burgers. Really good burgers, handpacked, oozing with flavor. The burger of my dreams is hard to find in Chicago barring an hourlong wait on an empty stomach. Lucky for me, I knew of the Paramount Room and their kobe burger special. I found it more difficult to persuade my mister over here. It took a busy Saturday afternoon to get here. I'm so glad that I did!!! When I walked into the Paramount Room the first time, its size or lack thereof which threw me off. It's remarkably small, but there was a back booth open. The bathrooms are small, but they have the Dyson handdryers that my fiance couldn't get enough of.  Coming here, I knew what I wanted instantly. I wanted the burger of my dreams. I braved a beer since I gave it up at Christmas in preparation for the wedding. I went with a tasty raspberry ale. For my lunch, I had the kobe burger with vintage cheddar and fries. My fiance had almost the exact same thing with a different beer. My dad chose the eggs benedict on the suggestion of a patron who exited the restaurant as we entered.  The burger is hands down amazing. The meat had a rich, smoky flavor topped with light salt. It had a complex flavor profile where every bite was flavorful and delicious. This burger fulfilled my desires for a quality burger in the city. There's no frozen patty thrown on the grill and priced $9 here. The burger came with a garlic aioli of sorts thatt made fry dipping tasty. Yeah, I'm the girl who mixes mayo and ketchup together when eating fries. The fries were tasty as well. My dad raved about his eggs benedict which looked nommable. We had great service here. The waitress was nice, helpful, and a little snarky. She made sure that I experienced my one beer of the summer or the year for that matter. When my dad ordered another beer, he asked her for a recommendation. She didn't even suggest anything but she tapped a beer for a taste. He loved it and it hit the spot. She knew the perfect beer for my dad. For a Saturday afternoon, the staff was pleasant and nice. I would definitely return here because that burger is too amazing to pass up. Their other menu items look delicious as well. Be prepared to take a nap after the wonderful burger. You may need one.

So we decide to see what its about one night after dinner. So we walk over and we're about 20 feet away from the spot when I ask her ""okay, so where is this place supposed to be?"" ...she says ""its right here"" (pointing to building right in front of my face). Whole in the wall alert light goes off.  I'm lookin at this joint from the outside and I'm hoping a swarm of guys in leather dont stare me down and the record doesnt come off the player when I walk in...had a flashback of the movie Police Academy and the bar The Blue Oyster that Lasard's dumb ass went to for a unwanted hazing session. We walk in and it's in-fact a hole in the wall. Very narrow spot. So much so, if somebody's sitting at the bar, you almost need them to scoot in to get past them. Well maybe not, but it's close.  We sit down at the last two spots available at the bar (there are a total of about 10 of them by the way (L shaped bar...5 on one side, 5 on the other).  There are also a few booths and tables by the window, for the record.  I'm starvin like marvin up in this bitch so I ask the bartender to get me hooked up with a menu.  Can't really decipher if any of the dishes will meet my tastebud needs with a stomach so empty its touching my back....so I spot the burger and give the bartender the green light. (note to public: make sure you order it what they call ""dressed"" and I would also recommend it with cheddar cheese) The burger comes out in a very reasonable amount of time (but not so soon that you're concerned if it was cooked thoroughly). I investigate and am pleased at the presentation. I take a bite and my taste buds may have had some of the best sex of their life with a burger.  Seriously, one of the best burgers I've tasted in years, or possibly ever!  Am.not.bullshittin.you!  After I down the burger with my brew of choice (Amstel Light...they have a nice selection of brews, a few others of which I also downed that night too), I take a visit to the bathroom. The bathroom is one of those one-person-at-a-time set ups, and I opened up the door to find a guy already in there (sorry buddy, lock the door next time!). So once the guy comes out and I apologize...I make my way in and am very impressed. Look, this is a whole in the wall, the ambiance is not the greatest or the worst, so I expect average from the bathroom.  Look, the owners of this joint invested some money in the bathroom, and I appreciate it. That tells me you care and makes me trust the food you're serving up.  The bathroom has this Star Wars inspired Dyson hand dryer. You basically stick your hands down this machine and it turns on...and you slowly pull your hands out and they're totally dry! No bullshit, I'll come back to this joint just to wash my hands...and yeah, I'll probably hit them for a brew on the way out. Overall, good place to go with one or two folks who are non-pretentious.

Yes, there are good beers on tap... and a kind of bitchin' daily specials of $5 for a shot and a beer or $10 for the Kobe burger and a pint.  That's where the love affair ends.  Here's the deal with Paramount Room: It's got the most bizarre setup ever (the upstairs has a little bar and four tables and the downstairs ""lounge"" has a few more tables), it's claustrophobic, kinda expensive and hard to find. The patrons aren't particularly friendly. And I didn't really get a warm fuzzy when I walked in. No one greeted me and I stood awkwardly waiting for some stools to free up at the bar. I wasn't sure if I could just sit at the tables or if someone was supposed to seat me. And certainly no one who worked at Paramount Room asked me if I wanted a table, etc. It felt... odd.  However, when I settled into my seat at the upstairs bar, I found my groove. The hilarious and spunky bartender told me that the Bells on tap was delicious, so I went with it. She regaled my friend and me with tales of running into Harrison Ford (he bought her a drink to stop her from calling him Han Solo) and the crazy 40-something women throwing themselves at Duran Duran at their reunion show at the House of Blues a few years back. I dig a nice, witty banter with bartenders, and the gal bartendress at Paramount Room is tops. Now can we talk about those Kobe burgers? Ahhhh-mazing. Perfectly seasoned and cooked well, they're served on a grilled bun and served with your choice of awesome toppings like vintage cheddar, bacon, grilled onions, etc. You get the picture. The best part? You can substitute fried green beans instead of fries. They're rockin'... and a nice change of pace from the fried 'taters.  While my burger was fairly priced, I did notice the menu had some interesting, yet pricey options. I'm not sure it this type of place warrants such a fancy-schmancy menu.

The $10 kobe/pint deal got me in the door.  My medium rare Kobe was delicious, melty mouth good; so good you don't want to brush your teeth that night because that fat flavor lingers.  My date went Medium, a common mistake of the younger female species; a bit charred but serves her right for angering the meat gods.  Her fries were good but I'm on an all meat diet and they distract.  However, the 'No Crap on Tap' held true and we had a Stiegl from... WAIT the menu says GERMANY! Ahh, but an embarrassed bartended quickly reprinted the menus with the correct origin of Austria.  The list was a good mix of local favorites Gumball Head and Matilda to solid imports Kostritzer, etc. and of course cans of another beer, the winner of a blue ribbon at the 1893 Columbian Exposition.     What us Fulton River Districtians are in need of is the cool businesses that take years upon years of entrepreneurs to build up over time, but we want it rather soon, like now.  This is precisely what I've been looking forward to.   Instead of cop bars where the owners let the boys in blue turn their patrons blue and red; or over priced Italian, this dare I say the overused term, Gastropub, is good beer and good meat and that's all I require.     I think I may learn the meaning of the term regular in due course.",0.9802,0.773,0.154,0.073,0.4340822867608582

2009-04-11,4.0,"After hearing my husband rave about this place after two separate 'boys night out occasions', he finally took me here this weekend so I too - could experience this $10 burger and pint deal.  He swears that this is the best damn burger in Chicago. However, I beg to differ.  Price performance ration: Outstanding.  Where can you get a burger and a pint for $10?  However, I hesitate to believe that they use Kobe beef here.  Why?  I've had Kobe beef burgers at three other area restaurants and I order it medium.  Here, the meat was very lean.  Kobe is more fatty - and at the other restaurants that I've been to, they were fatty.  I also found my patty to be covered in black pepper.  Thank goodness I enjoy black pepper but there were some bites where the taste was a little overwhelming.   Decent burger, nice thick buttery bun thats toasted.  But not the best burger in the city.  I still prefer Sweets and Savories Kobe burger. Sides: they offer you two choices - either fries or green beans. Thinking that I was going to be healthy, I ordered the green beans- but NO ONE mentioned to me they were deep fried.  But good nonetheless!  Your plate will come with two limes - I didn't know what they were for at first, but I squeezed some juice over the fried green beans - delicious!!! I highly recommend the steak tartare.  It is very, very good here.  I enjoyed that the dish was served near room temperature because you can taste the flavors better than when something is cold out of the fridge.  They use a very nice combination of herbs in their tartare including parsley which I don't think is normally found in tartare.  It's $11 but great for sharing among 3-4 people. My buddy Matt ordered their Cuban sandwich.  It's American style cuz it was HUGE and stacked high - not pressed and thin like the typical Cuban.  However, it was tasty.  No skimping on meat here!  Portion is huge and enough to share for sure! Great selection of beers including my current favorite - 3 Floyds Gumballhead.   Big bonus: our waitress was awesome enough to split up our totals on the check so we knew what we each owed - we didn't even have to ask.  That is something I have never seen at a restaurant before.  Awesome.

My friend and I were riding our bikes downtown from Wicker Park when we passed the ""kobe burger and a pint $10"" sign. We both agreed we'd stop for lunch on the way back. Disclaimer: I've been watching what I eat, so I haven't had a burger in months, and this could have impacted the deliciousness of my burger... but I doubt it. Having had no expectations, we were both impressed. I ordered my burger med rare and the server warned that it would be very bloody. He was right and I was happy. I made sure the burger came sans mustard, and the server explained ketchup and veggies were on the side, but our burgers arrived with special sauce (1000 island), which I was fine with , but my friend had to scrape off. Beer selection was great and reasonably priced. Cocktails were pricey, though. Fries were also fantastic and one order was enough for us to split. This place did seem to have a split personality. The main level was like a pub and the basement, which is where were seated because the upstairs was full, was more of a lounge. They maximized the small space with their banquet seating in the basement and a small mezzanine with a couple of tables. Some reviewers claimed it was way too small, but I think they did a great job with the cozy space. I will definitely be back.

Cons: - The sauce they put on that burger is overwhelming, I would have much rather they kept the thing plain and allowed me to savor the meat a little more.  In the future I will try to order it sans sauce. - Location is not the most convenient for most people, but it must be a Godsend for River Westers / West Loopers.

I was impressed with the fact that we were seated before our party was complete - that's pretty much never happened before, and it was quite nice. We were seated on the very bottom level of the restaurant - very dark, and very close quarters.  When my friend ordered her first beer, she was informed that they were out of it. She then tried to order another - they were out of that too. The waitress was helpful in making another similar selection, and my friend was happy with it.  We all started with a  caesar salad, which was very good - the dressing was delicious and there was just enough on the salad. I was a little thrown off by the aftertaste of bacon on the crostini though. Two of us got the kobe beef burger, and we did not like it at all. It was way overseasoned, and something about it just wasn't right. Hands down, one of the worst burgers I've ever had - I've had kobe beef before, and it tasted 100 times better than this burger. To say that I was disappointed would be an understatement - I didn't even finish half. I also opted to get fries on the side - they arrived soggy, mushy, and somewhat overcooked.  We attempted to order dessert - the waitress explained the 3 desserts that they had, and we opted for the turtle brownie concotion that sounded pretty amazing. Our waitress came back a few minutes later to let us know that they were all out of our dessert, and had been for a few days. I had baked the birthday girl some cupcakes to take home with her, and I brought them into the restaurant with me - the waitress let us eat the cupcakes I had brought, which was nice. When I asked for a candle, the waitress said that even if they did have one, we were right underneath a ceiling fan and it would get blown out anyway.  Our water glasses were filled up twice - once at the beginning of the meal, and once after we had already paid our bill.  After we had eaten the dessert that we brought, the waitress brought us over some champagne to toast with, to make up for them not having our dessert - that was an added bonus, but we still left disappointed, thirsty, and a little hungry, I wouldn't try this place again, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.",0.9751,0.865,0.106,0.029,0.5466269841269841

I want your snails!   The first time I was there we ordered an array of sandwiches that we split amongst the four of us.  My favs were the reuben and the burger.  The only underperformer was the Cuban.  I've only ever had the $5 PBR and shot special to drink, which always works for me.  You have two choices for your shot, tequila or whiskey.  I usually mix it up because I'm a dumbass.  First time I tried to order a shaken shot of Sambuca, which I did not receive.   The service is honest and anti-bullshit, which I admire.  The music is a nice mixture of alt/indy rock tunes you'd probably hear at the Gap, which I have no problem with as that's where I buy my jeans.   Two out of three times we've had our bill reduced, both times by the same waitress.  Maybe she thinks I'm hot, or maybe it's that whole industry discount thing I mentioned earlier.  Either way, I'll be back for more shots, PBR and steak tartar.",0.9897,0.831,0.133,0.036,0.5838197644649259

The bartender handed me a draught menu, which must change often as today's date is printed on there. They've got a small but diverse selection, however, nothing really fantastic imho.  We both ordered the Kobe burger and a pint deal-- don't pass this up, the burger is nothing short of perfect and for only $10. My pint would have been $7 on its own so you do the math.

2009-01-05,3.0,"I've been here a number of times, thanks to a friend who became a fixture there (in a good way). The space on the main level is cramped, but the lower floor was great for a birthday party with a lot of our friends. On tap and in bottles, the beer selections are mighty tasty. They cover microbrews, Belgians, Germans and more. There's a wide range of lightness to darkness too, so there's something for everyone. The servers can recommend a beer based on what you generally like, describe each of the offerings or even let you sample them. If you aren't completely sure about downing a whole pint of an unfamiliar brew, get the 8oz ""shorty"" and save a couple bucks. While it's a gastropub, the food is less accessible for me. Please, consider a vegan option! The grilled brioche sandwich without the cheese or mayo is the only vegan-able entree. Now that I know that brioche bread is pretty much always made with butter and eggs, maybe the roll needs to be left out too. :( The tempura fried green beans that come with the sandwich (or can be ordered as an appetizer) are more than ample though; I can never finish them without help. Careful with the spicy dipping sauce; it sneaks up on you. I went for brunch with about 8 or 10 friends once; we smashed into the  ""Barcelona-style banquette"", making it a little tricky getting in and out when someone had to get up. I was sad to find that nothing substantial on the brunch menu was vegan-able. I opted for an order of frites (no aioli) and the grilled asparagus (ask for no cheese or butter). Too pricy for what it ended up being. I can vouch for what Aaron S. said about the remarkable memory of the server at that party. She had everyone's tab separately, making it easy to take care of my share without having to wait for an overall tab and then juggling dollar bills among everyone. I'd love to give this place four or five stars, but the constricted space and smaller beer selection (compared to Hopleaf, at least) don't make up for a lack of a real vegan dish. However, I'll still come here for beers with friends. It's right off the Grand Blue Line stop, but keep your eyes peeled as you could easily walk by it.",0.9945,0.755,0.174,0.071,0.5535233285233285

There's three levels to this place. When you first walk in, you see the bar, a few tables, and along the side there's a couple large booths that are sort of connected and could accommodate a party of 10ish(?). I think on this level is where the ""regulars"" or ""neighborhood"" folks hang out. Head down the stairs to the lounge where there's another small bar and more tables. Right in the middle on your way down is sort of a mezzanine level that has two tables to seat 6-8 and is kind of cute and private-ish. You can see the lower lounge level from here.

Walking in I was thinking to myself ""The burger is going to be tiny and you will have to pay for your lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, etc..."" or ""The pint is going to be Natty Ice"" or ""The burger is just going to suck.""  Paramount room dispelled each of those notions.   Actually they kicked each one of those notions asses. The burger was very good.  It comes served with a special sauce and to the right of your burger you will find tomato slices, pickle, onion, and mixed greens.  The burger was so good in fact that it didn't need anything else, not even ketchup.  It was cooked perfectly at medium, juicy, and the flavor of the meat was great.  I might even say that the actual burger patty itself was better than Kumas!  If I had to manufacture a knock, I'd say the burger was a hair on the small side.  When it comes to your pint, you are able to choose from a list of boutique beers that they have on tap ($5 & $6 beers are included and you can pay a bit more to get a $7 or $8 beer), which includes my favorite, Three Floyds Gumball Head.  Oddly, I decided against the Gumball Head and went with Two Brothers Oh Brother, which was delicious.  From what I seen all beers are served in proper glasses, which I always think is a nice touch.   The space is a bit small, but I guess it's more of a bar than a restaurant.  The music was great!

2008-05-21,4.0,"Personally, I always enjoy meeting the chef at a restaurant.  Particularly so when he also happens to be the owner.  I am certain you've shared similar experiences yourself and, good or bad, it generally gives you that 'aha' moment where you truly understand the food and the atmosphere in which you are being served. The Paramount Room is a very good reflection of Steve Dunn.  I only met and spoke with him for three minutes, but he seems very cool and  committed to the success of his place.  His staff and he seemed to have genuine rapport and Steve was clearly proud of them, e.g. his bartender who Steve explained was an expert in all things beer - the nectar of the gods.  And he was right.  They have an incredible selection which on its own is reason enough to visit.  Not too many places have as wide a selection of high quality beer AND have the guts to serve Maredsous Belgian Tripel side by side with PBR in a can. The food was tasty.  It's not a high end French restaurant nor does it aspire to be.  You can read the attached menu.  Suffice to say, it's one of those restaurants where you have a multitude of choices and have to make some hard decisions.  Me? I'll just say the mussels were great and my friends and I used the crunchy bread to sop up every drop of the broth.  The entree portions are pretty hearty so be prepared to manage the disagreement between your needs & desires as you forced to decide. Why four stars versus five?  A number of different 'must have' entrees were not available that night so I cannot in good conscience give them a full five stars.  I am sure they will earn it from me because I know I'm willing to go back there again.  Hope you enjoy yourself.",0.994,0.779,0.182,0.039,0.5626485260770975

The upstairs room is fairly small, with a bar, a couple of booths, and a few tables. There's more seating downstairs -- there were several large parties the night we were there, so I assume quite a bit more seating. Bar service was terrific -- the bartender had a good knowledge of what was on tap, and did well at offering suggestions. The table service was a little forced, but we learned that the server hadn't been there long, so she's probably still getting a feel for the place. The food was good. The chef/owner is also the chef at Volo. The food here is quite a bit simpler, and while nothing blew me away, everything was satisfying.

2008-03-30,3.0,"At 7 pm on a Saturday night, one of my expense-account friends called me from his downtown hotel with a request that I take him out for a drink and dinner. I'm not a 'downtown on saturday night' kind of gal - I hate dressing up, I can't stand overpaying for mediocre food, and I detest paying for parking.  After desperatedly making excuses not to get together (""my friend...her cat just died...she needs me more than you need me to take you to dinner"") I was worn down by his refusal to take no for an answer.  I drove to the hotel grumbling. Where on earth would I be able to take him that would have available seating and decent - nay, acceptable - food at 8 pm? As I was driving I found my answer: The Paramount Room. I had driven by it dozens of times and heard tell of its 'gastropub' menu, but had never bothered to stop in - with so many other choices in the city, it just wasn't on my list of places to try. So I escorted my friend, a Parisian who loves to remind me that I treat him like a bumpkin who just fell off the turnip truck, to the restaurant. We were seated immediately, and we had our choice of tables. Service was prompt and friendly, and the menu had a large variety of items, some expensive (the $18 pate plate...with complimentary foie gras terrine, wink wink) some cheap (burger, $11). There was an ample selection of typical gastropub fare, from Scotch Eggs to charcuterie to cheese to fries with truffle mayo. There was also the right side of the menu, that had slightly pricier items - a small dish of steamed mussels for $12 - that excluded frites (as an aside, The Hop Leaf serves a cast iron pot full of mussels with frites for $10).  There were also meaty entrees in the $20+ range. We ordered from the left side of the menu, and were not dissatisfied with our food. Everything was adequately tasty, nothing was particularly bad. Nothing was particularly wonderful either, though. We had the mussels, the charcuterie, frites, a veggie, and steak tartare and a couple beers. We were absolutely full by the end, and I think it was about $35 per person, which was not unreasonable. Considering that my expectations were extremely low, I was not disappointed. Would I go back? Probably not, but it isn't a bad place.

We went on a Friday so, while it was pretty busy, the great thing was that we got a table pretty quickly.  The server was incredibly helpful in helping us navigate the interesting menu, as well as covered all the points of service (I was a server and bartender while in college and law school, so she was GOOD), but she never told us her name, so I can't properly credit her, unfortunately. When the food arrived, we were kind of disappointed. The ""putine"" (sp?) french fries we got were gross.  The fries were super soggy underneath and it must have been sitting in the window awhile because the cheese was already hard and not hot anymore.   I ordered $11 calamari that turned out to be only 3 pieces.  I  wish I would have known that, but I assumed it wasn't a small plate since it wasn't under the SMALL PLATES part of the menu.  My BF got the burger that he said was awesome, but recommends asking for the ""special sauce"" on the side since there was a TON of it on the sandwich.  Overall, so-so on the food. After the meal, we had one drink at the bar.  A man who introduced himself as the owner came over and talked AT us for almost an hour.  He seemed kind and surely meant well, but he basically stole my boyfriend away for some time.  We were on a date and I just did not need to hear this guy talk about how great all of his restaurants (I think he said something about Volo in Roscoe) are doing and where he plans to go with it all.  Like I said, he meant well, but we wanted to sit and talk to each other since it was a datel.  We kind of laugh about it now, but it was a little annoying at the time.

The menu looked great (more selections than the menu posted on the web). Unfortunately, the service was extremely slow. Initially, we waited at least 20 minutes for our server to come and take our drink order. There may have been only 1 server there that night, which would explain our wait. It took an equally lengthy time to receive those drinks, so some in my party ordered a second drink when the first drinks came. We were served a fries with gravy and cheese dish for the table to share (which were soggy-er than they should have been), and were not given silverware or napkins, until we were able to flag down our server 10 minutes later. A member of my party requested a glass to pour his bottled sparkling water into, but never received it and gave up trying to flag the server down. I ordered the calamari, which cost $11, and was disappointed when I received a plate with 2 pieces of calamari on it. I am used to small plate restaurants, but this was insulting. And the calamari dish was actually listed under the seafood section of the menu, not the small plate section. One member of our party ordered a Reuben sandwich which turned out to be juicy, great, and size-appropriate. Another member ordered the Croque Madame which was decent but small. At the end of the meal, the server did not offer us the option of dessert or another drink. To sum this up, I didn't feel at all welcome here. And I felt robbed when the large bill came.

There were mini-pool sticks since the pool table was so close to the wall-that was kinda funny. The beer selection was great- I had the flight for 7 bucks which was nice.

We tried both the fried green beens and pickle spears which were good but again- soooo salty. I probably would not go back nor recommend this to anyone",0.9724,0.836,0.152,0.012,0.5627428571428572
2007-09-15,2.0,"When I first read about this place opening, I was really excited because this area could use some more casual bars, however, upon visitiing the paramount room, it was very average at best. Here are some of the Pros and Cons. Pros - They have a great selection of beers here so that you can try various beers from different regions of the world. I tried the beer flight and didn't like a couple of them, but then I tried one of their ""bottle"" belgian ales and it was delicious. - The space itself is kind of cool. The downstairs area is laid out very different from any place I've ever been to so it was kind of cool to see. They also have 3 TVs in the downstairs and a pool table. Cons -The place itself is very awkward. In the same way that it was cool to be different, it wasn't laid out very well. While a pool table is nice, they really could use that space to put more tables in - which leads to: - We were told we had to leave our table later in the evening because it had been reserved. I don't get that pub (be it more upscale or not) reserves tables. - Food: I only tried a little bit off of a few things but the food was average. Their menu is very weird and the food that people did order wasn't that great. - Drink prices: While the beers aren't bad, many of the signature cocktails and martinis were 12 bucks. That is the same price that you pay at The signature lounge or bella. Overall, this place is trying too hard to be something it shouldn't. I would maybe go back if a lot of people I was going out with were going there, but definitely wouldn't pick it myself. As much as I wanted to like it because its a ""pub"" and close to my place, I didn't",0.9841,0.839,0.121,0.04,0.5425213675213676
2007-09-01,4.0,"This ultra hip bar and lounge just opened in the old 4 taste space. The place looks great and so does the food. The menu is filled with interesting new concepts with old standbys, like fish and chips and fried green beans...delicious! It's 2 levels  - 1st floor bar, kitchen, and a few booths, basement level, bar, lots more tables, pool table, dj booth and tons of character. We went last night, their first night open and had a great time. The beer and wine selection were large but not overwhelming I had a Holy Moses White that was tasty!  I noticed a nice martini menu for my next visit I will be trying one of them for sure. Paramount Room is a great place for a nice dinner or just to grab a few drinks with friends. Nice job Stephen and Jon! See you guys at the Paramount Room again soon.",0.9866,0.794,0.206,0.0,0.5096524248698162
