2017-07-16,4.0,"Annapurna is arguably the best casual Indian restaurant on Devon Avenue.  And I will certainly be back to enjoy the full variety of their North-South-West Indian menu. You place an order at the cashier in the back, and then take a seat, waiting for your number to be called out when the food is ready.  Effective but not always efficient.  However, other alternatives will likely introduce chaos or require more labor--both with unintended consequences on the peaceful vibe and low prices of the restaurant. I tried the samosas, the vada pav and the Jain-style peas uttapam.  The vada pav came close to what one might find on the streets of Bombay, perhaps not as fresh.  But the uttapam was off-the-charts good.  For a restaurant that has such a wide range of Indian cuisines represented in the menu, they do an amazing job of combining quality, price and speed.

2017-04-04,3.0,"Vegans, Vegetarians, check it out! I am a huge fan of authentic Indian cuisine, and Annapurna has a variety of excellent options to satisfy the hungry picky carnivore you might bring along with you. Thali, Aloo dishes, Samosa, Chat, Chana Masala, and Daal dishes fill the menu from top to bottom, and all of them can be had at a very reasonable price in either half or full orders. When I went, like almost always, I requested a variety of dishes to try, and was glad I did. Pro Tips: Order it to-go, and avoid the plastic and Styrofoam plates/dishes as much as possible. I was sad to see that such good food arrived with a plastic fork, so next time I'll do take out. Order extra rice, and extra naan - because I've found that it's always better to have too much than not enough, especially since so many of the dishes have extra sauce. Go at a slightly off-time - trust me on this one. Because everyone who visits this location also loves authentic cuisine, I quickly found that the small space fills up fast! I also went right at the height of dinner, (between 5-7pm), and it was almost standing room only. (Which is always the sign of good food.) Try a dish you haven't ever had as an extra. It's the only way to learn what your new favorite will be. Best of all, the walk down Devon afterward - it's a vacation unto itself! Namaste!",0.9883,0.819,0.161,0.02,0.5554994846423417

2017-03-11,5.0,"Found ourselves on Devon Avenue one day and eventually the big question about where to eat. Too many Halal restaurants and many ""is that even hygienic enough to be legal?"" looking store fronts. Checked Yelp a lot and decided on this place. Walked it and it was heartening to see a place full of lively customers at that odd hour when it's too late for a late lunch and too early for an early dinner.  Tight quarters, busy staff and not the best seats. So why 5 stars? Well, it tasted like homemade cooking, nobody seemed to rush us (we stayed for well over an hour) and great bang for your buck. We were staring at each other in joyous disbelief when our food arrived. Totally hogged for the next hour and forgot that the food had taken some time to come. If you're a fan of Indian fare, they seemed to have done justice to both north and south Indian dishes (we're one of each). Portion sizes are generous and the ambience is very casual. You just gotta make sure you get in outside of ""rush"" hours as I imagine the place would be packed otherwise and worsen your experience.  Oh, and I didn't write the review for you. I wrote it so I'm not stuck on Devon Avenue ever in the future again trying to remember the name and/or location of this easy to miss gem. That should tell you something.

This place needs to get it together.  I ordered a bhel which was pretty tasty. It was good but nothing to jump up and down about.

But looks alone don't make for a great dining experience.  On the day I visited, the restaurant was busy, but not slammed, so the gruffness of the service (both at the counter and in the dining area) was a little disarming.  AP would definitely benefit from additional staff to help with busing and cleaning tables.  The one employee I saw performing these tasks appeared to be overburdened, and the cleanliness and orderliness of the dining area suffered as a result.  As for the food: the samosa chaat was excellent: great flavor, very nicely balanced.  I also really liked the mango lassi (generous on the mango), which paired nicely with the paneer dosa (crisp and warm).  I was less crazy about the bhindi masala, which was very heavy on the oil.  If the counter staff try to talk you into a platter combo (as they did me), be warned that the naan is nothing to write home about, and the ""salad"" is just a pile of tomatoes and onions, so kind of useless.  NB: ""half"" portions are pretty substantial, and the price is more than right.

2013-02-18,4.0,"Everyone asks me where to go for the best Indian food, and I always have to go with Annapurna, although it does appear to be the biggest hole in the wall. But, let's be honest, almost every place on Devon is a hole in the wall. My family usually gets the following: Samosa Chaat: incredibly spicy and more ""soupy"" than one would expect, since chaat is usually a dry food. They add a little bit of a curry to the dish, but it is really filling and has all the components of a chaat. Masala Dosa: This is that looooooong doughy/crunchy item a lot of people see when they google ""South Indian food"". It is a similar taste/texture to the bread you get at Ethiopian restaurants, slightly sour and spoungy. The filling is usually potatoes and onions and is served with two different types of sauces. One is more like a soup, but you are supposed to dip your dosa into this before eating it. YUM. I feel like this is such a specialty because it's hard to make at home. Or maybe it's because my parents stem from a different region, so I only get this meal 1-2 times a year. Chole Bhature: This is a garbarnzo bean-heavy dish with a large circular bread. The bread has been fried so it's not the healthiest, but it is the most delicious!! =) They serve this with onions, jalapenos, and achar (pickled vegetables), so you can make it as spicy as you want. This item is definitely more of a morning breakfast/brunch item, and it's quite filling.  Chai: This is a black tea boiled (usually for hours!) with milk and various spices. They usually don't serve it with sugar, so make sure you get some before you leave. This is a real staple for Indians, as many people drink a cup after every meal.  They have a good array of desserts as well, so if you are brave enough to endure the sweetness of Indian desserts, then go for it. However, my personal opinion is that Indian sweets are very much an acquired taste so there's a good possibility that you will not like it the first few times you try it.",0.9958,0.843,0.15,0.007,0.4996261487050962

I remember back in the day (probably like 20 years ago) this was the go to snack shop on Devon.  I remember my parents taking me there many times.  Over time, unfortunately, I remember the place just deteriorated in terms of up-keep and quality.  I had been there a couple of times when I just felt like it was filthy.  Plus, other great options were springing up all around. Well, the other day we went to Devon and most of the other places were closed.  The place we usually go actually moved their closing time up to 7pm, which is strange. Well anyway, so I had heard that Annapurna had remodeled so I figured I'd give it another shot.  I'm happy I did.  So with the granite tables, floors, etc. the interior was definitely upgraded.  It's funny, but I don't know why casual fast food places on Devon think granite is appropriate for their decor.  Have you ever seen a McDonald's with granite tables?  At least never in the US.  Anyway, that's an aside.  It's just weird, because even with these upgrades, you can see how the attitude of cleanliness of this place hadn't changed.  Tables that had been used were left uncleaned and there was garbage on the floors.  Well, I won't be long before this place will become the dump that it was once again. Hmmm... this review is starting to sound more negative than I intended.  I guess the stars still represent.  Well, the reason for my good rating was the value for the food.  We got chole bhature for like $3.99?!  Crazy... and that includes two huge bhaturas, chole, chopped onions, pickled peppers, mango achar, and even some suji halwa.  That's outstanding.  Plus, when the chole ran out before the bhature, they willingly gave us more chole.  That's pretty cool.  Not only was this a great deal, but the taste was awesome.  Very Punjabi flavor, which was impressive given that it's a Gujrati-run shop. The bhel puri and dahi puri were good.  Not the best on Devon, but they were pretty good. Well, so Annapurna is back on my list of chaat shops on Devon.  Now, if they could only remember to sweep floors and clean tables more regularly.",0.9974,0.759,0.206,0.035,0.5698717948717948

It had a weird taste, the texture was too soft, and the shape was too flat. Samosas should be pyramidal, crispy on the outside, and starchy-dry on the inside.

2009-07-22,3.0,"The great: It's cheap! The OK: The food itself. My main meal was a masala dosa, a crepe made of fermented rice and lentils, and stuffed with spicy potato and onions.  I have had better but at nowhere near the same price. My favorite part of the meal was the vada, fried lentil donuts accompanied by a coconut sambol. The not-so-good: The décor.  Anapurna, with blue bench seating and cracked laminate flooring, has the feel of a run down fast food restaurant.   The scary: The grumpy old man behind the counter.  When I placed my order he mumbled something.  That I didn't understand him seemed to aggravate him even more.  While awaiting my meal I enjoyed watching the confused looks on the faces of other patrons as the old man announced orders over his PA system.  Dinner and a show. Will I be back? Probably.  The cheap meal/entertainment are difficult to pass up.",-0.387,0.815,0.091,0.095,0.5169191919191918
2009-06-17,3.0,"Annapurna is as close to Indian street vendor food as it can get. The food won't blow your mind away, but it's ridiculously cheap. Actually, I wouldn't recommend the ""entrees"" like Mutter Paneer (though it's tempting at $2.99 for a combo). Stick to the appetizers and you'll be alright. (Mmm, idli sambar.) The old man/cashier is extremely, extremely difficult to understand. There is no description of dishes, so first timers may have troubles deciding what to order. The food takes a while to come out, especially on weekends. Overall, Annapurna offers no thrills Indian fast food with everything being under $4 (no lie). NOTE: They are CLOSED on TUESDAYS.",-0.8878,0.773,0.072,0.155,0.4033333333333333
2009-01-28,3.0,"This palace is the McDonalds of Indian snacks. Yes, its a fast food place. And no, they are not great at it. Just average. Cheap, quick, and satisfying. For a little more authentic tasting fare, I recommend going across the street to Sukhadia's. Sukhadia's service SUCKS, but they have better tasting sambar, and even better tasting chaats 'n snacks. I agree with previous reviewer that Annapurna could up its taste and quality by 50% or more.",0.893,0.738,0.194,0.069,0.5476190476190477
2008-08-11,1.0,"Devon is a wonderful place - full of restaurants that offer cheap treats and tasty food; well there are some higher priced ones. Anyway, when it comes to cheap ""treats"" this one was cheap - getting a meal for two for $6.85; can't beat that, right? Well, enough good about this place - now the real dish about this place. It's the worst food I've had on the planet. I went there got a regular thali. Ate it - fully dissatisfied as it was cooked three days ago. Went home, puked. Apparently, the people I was with suffered the same - even worse.  If you feel the need to go to this place; please, spare yourself. If you want to go to this place, call me or email me, I will pay you to go to an 'ok' place like Tahoora.",-0.3804,0.773,0.112,0.116,0.5461023351648352
2008-07-14,4.0,Great Indian fast food.  I love that it's all veggie and the music is also authentic and enjoyable.  I used to live much closer and this is one of the places I miss most.  It's definitely on the dive end of Devon but incredibly reasonably priced and exceptionally great if you want something quick and you want to try different Indian dishes and snacks. Mango lassis are also great!,0.9725,0.689,0.296,0.016,0.5857142857142856
2008-04-21,4.0,"I've been coming here for 10 years and I don't think it hasn't changed a bit.  I think if it did, it just wouldn't be the same - terrible decor, prickly owner (he takes your order and works the cash register, and is generally impatient about hemming and hawing).. but super good, super cheap south indian fare.  The last time I was here, I explained the menu to two young indie-20-somethings, and tried to emphasize how big the portions were (despite the $3-4 prices) - they didn't believe me and ended up with enough food for 4 or 6 people, on $20!  The other caveat is that you should know what the dishes are before you go, since there is pretty much no explanation on the board above the food prep.. Also, dosas and bhel puri are best eaten fresh, so brave the cafeteria/fast food type tables, get a mango juice (carbonation doesn't help with spicy food), and go on a cool day (hot day +hot food +warm restaurant = hard on your digestion!)  The samosas and indian sweets travel well though!  I always get extra for snacking at home",0.9906,0.739,0.204,0.057,0.532986111111111
2008-02-15,4.0,"Best samosas I've ever had.  If you're freaked about about the cashier/owner, don't be discouraged, especially if you're not of South Asian descent.  Become a regular customer and he'll remember and open up to you.  Minus one star because although it appears that they have passed all inspections, the dining area just looks like it will never be clean.  The menus don't have English translations, but once you know what you want, you should be in and out in about five to ten minutes.",0.4939,0.878,0.085,0.037,0.2974358974358975
2007-12-14,5.0,"This place takes me back to the good ol' chaat joints in India. Food's really yummy - its not the romantic place by any means or even a place to have a nice social dinner, you go there to eat 'n that's it..for those who are not used to the kind of decor in there, it could feel a bit weird..but well if you're not used to that decor, well this might be a totally different story. Especially on cold winter nights, I yearn for some of the nice spicy bhel puri and hot chai..'n as good as the food is, the prices are even better..really worth the buck..if only this joint was a stone's throw away.",0.9512,0.812,0.17,0.018,0.6011904761904762

My friend played it safe, and ordered samosas, but she loved 'em. I got Dal Wada and Kochari (think that's how it's spelled). Little fried balls of goodness . . .

2007-07-20,4.0,I only got the samosas to accompany my own Indian meal at home but they were delicious!!  Probably the best samosa I've had in Chicago.  I would have given it five stars but the sauce they gave with is was weak!  I went to go buy chutneys at the grocery store for more flavor. But yeah I feel they do treat you a little differently since I'm not of Indian descent.  But I don't hold it against them.  It's their culture and own experience.  I'm sure they've had the some racial experience sometime in their lives that make them so cautious. Yummy!!  Go get a samosa now!,0.9738,0.737,0.214,0.049,0.7413888888888888
2007-03-18,4.0,"I'm surprised that I haven't reviewed this place yet. Today I went with a group of four and all of us feasted for less than $20 total. Their samosas are delicious and only 65 cents. Anyway, this place is a kind of hole-in-the-wall type of place that is frequented almost exclusively by people who actually speak Hindi. The menu doesn't have translations of the different dishes are, so you can just kind of guess and order dosi, roti, chana, aloo gobi, and you can generally be assured that it will be delicious whatever you choose. Everything is vegetarian here, and it's all very inexpensive, fast food. You order from a counter, choose a blue formica table and wait for your number to be called, get your food, feast, bus your own table and then go. Easy, filling and simple. This place is no-frills, unglamorous, but a great place to stop in for a quick bite to eat.",0.8968,0.879,0.104,0.017,0.6398496240601504
