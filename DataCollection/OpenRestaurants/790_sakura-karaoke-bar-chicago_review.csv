2017-07-27,4.0,"Easy call-in reservation a week ahead, guy who answered spoke both English and Mandarin fluently and was conscientious about explaining the private-room gratuity policy (18% as of July 2017). Medium room was large and very clean. Song software was a little frustrating for non-Chinese readers because the default setting is not in English and the panel is set into the wall next to the big-screen TV without any sort of remote control. Staff came very quickly when summoned to take drink orders and bring them. We were there from 8-10pm on a Saturday. Did not attempt to extend our reservation and staff was very prompt about presenting the bill, which was fine by me because we had other places to be :) Song and artist selection was pretty good although certain hits were missing from certain artists. Not every song had its own music video - sometimes we enjoyed hilarious b-roll of random Europeans walking around. Powerful sound system.

It's decently clean though, the floors aren't sticky (1st star), and the karaoke system - while it doesn't have recent month's music - does effectively control the mics and the backtrack (2nd star).  So why the poor review?  The staff is really unpleasant. Simple as that.  Just the minimal rude interaction of asking which room we could have and the employee barging in at 10 minutes before our time was up to give us a check made my group feel unwelcome. We get it; time is money, so they have to keep everybody on track. But the employees' people skills are sorely lacking in maintaining a balance between time management, professionalism, and courtesy.

2016-05-08,1.0,"Horrible Experience  I reserved a medium room on a Saturday night to celebrate my birthday with a total of 8 friends. We were rudely interrupted about an hour in and accused of smoking. The manager stormed in during a song, turned on the lights, and said okay you have to go. When asked why, that's when we were accused. My whole party was defensive and offended by the accusations. The manager looked around our table and once he noticed there wasn't any signs of smoke, he cut off the light and closed the door without another word. I would have loved to continue with our session but my guest were taken back and were no longer having fun. The real issue did not start until I went to speak with the manager. I peacefully told him that we were going to leave because we were offended but we purchased drinks and we could finish in the common area to not hold the room any longer. The manager was confrontational and told me that he was not dumb. I told him we weren't either and each one of my guest were college graduates and continuing education. He told me that we could finish our drinks in the room because he didn't want us out in the common area, so basically we weren't staying in the room as a customer service but as a way to hide us from the rest of the crowd. I walked to the register prepared to pay and the manager printed my bill, as I reached for it he walked away and greeted other guest before giving me the bill that he was holding in his hand, I guess his intention were to non-verbally let me know that my time or money didn't matter. I told the manager I can't wait to write my Yelp review and he replied I can't wait for you to leave. We definitely left without drinking the 2 buckets of beers we had just purchased for $60 bucks. The private rooms are beautiful but the song collection could have been better. There was a shortage of American artist but the selection did include Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Nelly, Nicki Minaj, Mary J Blige, Justin Timberlake, Drake, and Adele.

2016-02-28,2.0,"The only reason why I'm only giving this place two stars is because of the karaoke room and modern songs.  I made a reservation at 9:30pm. I even called and double checked our reservation earlier that day. We get there 10-15 mins late because some of my guest got there before I did. They tell us to go to room 8, when we get there it's occupied. The guy who I'm guessing is in charge of reservation seems to be pancking. They are looking through the reservation book and by then it's 9:50. He rudely proceeds to tell me that because we are twenty minutes late they gave our room away. So I asked him that there's no way under 15 mins the people in the other room ate all that food and drinks under 10-15 mins because we weren't even that late. He then told us nothing will be available until 11:30. I was furious and told him I called today to double check my reservation and he did not tell us there was a late policy. He told us we will get a bigger room at 11 but he would still pay extra for the big room but he would buy us a round of shots. It was my younger sisters birthday so we decided to stay. The round of shots was something weird which later we found out was only a martini drink from their menu because I had the same drink afterwards...wow what great service.  We waited for an hour to get the room. It was 11:05pm and I had to remind the guy about our room. He once again forgot about us. We get to our room and we start having fun. We didn't know how to run on the mics when my friend went to go ask she said one the girl who helped was very rude saying ""it's quite simple"" and looked at my friend as though she was stupid. Later we press the service button only to be told by the staff that we have to go get our own drinks at the bar. So that's we all started doing. You order the food at the bar too. Some of these girls don't even know how to bartend, took them 15 mins to make our drinks plus they had to double check with the only guy in the bar who knew what he was doing to make sure they were doing them right. Don't have signature martinis if your staff won't know how to make them.  At then of the night we get our bill for the room only to find that there's a 18% gratuity included. For what? So someone can come in and tell us that we have to give ourselves our own service. They close at 2, at 1:50 they come into the room and shut of the TV while we were singing my sister her birthday song. We had three different staff come and tell us that they are closing very rudely. We told them kindly that we were finishing our last drinks. When we walk out to leave we find other people still at the lounge hanging around and it seemed like we were the only ones forced out.  I would love to come back to this place because the karaoke room was awesome but the service makes you not want to come back.

If you are a karaoke noob, make sure to ask because this style of karaoke was very new to me. Usually, in a korean-style karaoke room, there is a remote type of device where you input the songs you want. But here, there is a screen attached to the wall where you do everything. This was pretty inconvenient because we had to constantly stay by the screen rather than holding a remote and sitting on the couch to pick our songs. It was also difficult to maneuver through the screen. When we tried to type a song, the system was really slow. But we still had a great time here! The service was great and very prompt!

2015-06-03,3.0,"The environment here is pretty swanky and nice, with nice little VIP-style lounge sections with mostly-comfortable seating. The staff is small (no this isn't a jab at their heritage) but they're very friendly and accommodating.  I also like that they have both a public karaoke as well as private rooms, although every time I've visited it has been during the week and we were literally the only people there besides the staff.  The potstickers, edamame and wings are pretty tasty.  Many of the songs that AREN'T in Chinese are up-to-date, modern pop with the actual videos playing along. It's interesting that you can also have the song play the original if you're worried about singing off key or if you ""don't remember how it goes,"" it's really helpful. The sound is pretty decent, as well. So why three stars??? (In fact, I would have given two stars, but the staff is actually very nice and polite, so I didn't want to be too much of a nag with a 2-star). The main reason is that they actually have a $15 minimum purchase per person. This was never mentioned to us the first time I visited, since I think almost everyone in our party ordered food and drink. But the second time they mentioned it several times. Luckily, they were very nice and didn't really FORCE us to buy more, but they made it clear that next time (which there probably won't be one, in my case) they have to stand firm in their ""policy.""  The song selection is limited and doesn't seem to have any karaoke classics. It's ALL pop songs. And there is no KJ (karaoke DJ), the song rotation should be ""first-come-first-serve"" but it's really up to whoever's tooling around with the system. And it IS Chinatown karaoke, so sometimes you might get a mis-interpreted lyric up on the screen. The drinks and food are rather expensive, especially for the portion sizes. It's roughly $8-12 for appetizers; while they're delicious, it just seems to be a bit much to not have an actual meal. I don't drink alcohol, but I do enjoy their mixed juice. I think I threw them off guard when I asked for something sweet but non-alcoholic and had to instruct them to mix cranberry, orange and pineapple juice for a virgin mocktail.  Again, the biggest problem with this place is that minimum purchase. I don't drink alcohol and if I just want to sing when I'm not in the mood to eat or spend $15 on appetizers, I shouldn't be subjected to a minimum order; especially when the place is DEAD, other people in my party are spending money and I'm tipping almost as much as my drink costs ($3 for a juice). For those of you who need to get that liquid courage before singing, or who are actually out to drink AND sing, this place is a great destination, and I would recommend it. For you die-hard karaoke crawlers who just want to sing (like me) and nurse your drink, probably not the place to go.",0.9968,0.792,0.161,0.047,0.4964061096136566

We were informed that it would be $15 per person minimum in drinks to sing/sit in the open area (if no drinks were ordered, we were still obligated to pay the fee). When we asked for a room, we were told both the small rooms were ""booked for the entire night"" (even though it was a Wednesday night before 9pm and they are open to 2am? hmmm). We were told only the large room was open so we decided to book that for $50/hr.

When you go inside the office building, there is a tiny laser thing on the wall, letting you know, that doye, it's downstairs..I'm not sure why they just don't have a sign. We were greeted and told we could sit anywhere. When we were there, there were only two guys singing really bad in Mandarin (or Cantonese, or Taiwanese)..for like ever. We decided to sit at the bar and order drinks.  When asked how much the songs are for the stage and whatnot, they said FREE. What? Why get a room when you can sing for free? We soon found out why.  The setup is nothing like I've ever seen. There is a stage, with 2 mics, 2 chairs and the karaoke screen for you. You select your songs on the side of the stage via a touch screen computer. It takes forever to select a song because there is almost no selection. Unless you know the entire Abba collection, you'll spend like 10 minutes trying to find one song that you remotely know.  I did love that the videos that went with the songs were either the ACTUAL VIDEOS (!) or something completely relevant to the song..like if it was a disco song, there would be people dancing to disco and a disco ball, not a handicapped baby in a wheelchair. The drinks are pricey, and they only have one kind of sake, I'm assuming because it's Chinese, but we had a good time. Get the lychee martini.

It's in the ""basement"" I guess you can call it of a multi-use building (residential/commercial), down a set of stairs and there you are. It was a Sunday night, place was slow so we got awesome service. Next few times I went was Friday's and Saturday's still great service then too. Sakura has really comfortable booths and tables too but, they're just a bit too low (just personal opinion). ""We got the bottle - you got the cup, Come on everybody let's get ffffff... Brass Monkey - that funky monkey..."" They've got a sweet selection of brews here, Tsingtao, Sapporo and the typical domestics too. They've also got  Sake and Shochu if you care for either of them. Sad thing is that the last few times I've been there the Shochu wasn't available. Sake bottles (6-8 shots) is $10 last time I was here a few weeks ago.

The room is small but, has a huge projection Screen for everyone... gotta see those words right? There is a couch that runs all the way around the room on 3 of the 4 sides. It's severely comfortable and there's some low-pro tables you can pull closer and use to set your drinks.  ""Should I stay or should I go now? If I go there will be trouble, and if I stay it will be double"" that's what we ask each time we're here... no one wants to leave... it's a seriously good time and the drinks are pretty damn reasonable for Chicago. The staff is super friendly and will take the time to check on you, or if they're busy at the bar the bartender will acknowledge the fact you're waiting and not just ""ignore you"" like some places I've been to.

We get there and are told that all the rooms are currently occupied but that the large would be opening up soon which would then be $40 per hour. So we decide fine we will wait, but immediately after we decide to wait we are told that the people in the large room are going to stay an additional 2 hours!!! Wtf!?!?! Seriously!? But at no time did she mention anything about the two other rooms and how soon they would be opening up. Instead we were told that we could be seated in one of the open sectioned off lounge areas but if we did that it is mandatory that we spend a minimum of $10 a person. We were 8 people, so that was $80, double what we thought we were going to pay, though before going there I looked up the rates for the small room which was $25 an hour and on their site says it is good for up to 8 people so it's actually then $55 more than what we were going to pay for an hour of singing.   We had just come from dinner so we weren't really going to order any food and being a Tuesday night I really had no intention of drinking so to quote a mandatory policy of a $10 spending minimum per person to be seated in an empty (seriously there were maybe four other people there and I'm not even sure if they weren't part of the staff), retarded open lounge area with a stage and wait for the two terrible singers to stop and give a us turn on the mic is not how I wanted to spend my time or money.

The latter issue was helped somewhat by the fact that there were pictures of many artists/groups as well as their names, but it was still a bit weird. The English song catalog wasn't very extensive, so people had a hard time picking songs they wanted to do.

The mixed drinks were very small so if you plan on doing rum & cokes all night, make them doubles. The karaoke is good too. A decent selection, but definitely glaring omissions in terms of classic English-language karaoke songs. But the background videos on some of those songs are funny (and sometimes a little unnerving) enough to be worth giving it a go. One snafu which was no one's fault, really, but pretty bad form for any restaurant is that after we got the bill, they took it back because they forgot to tack on the gratuity. I don't mind paying gratuity, of course, but taking a bill back to bring back a higher one is just wrong!",0.3157,0.753,0.134,0.113,0.5334615384615383
2010-08-18,4.0,"Every one was right..the lychee martini was oh sooo good.  I had 3 all by myself!  My friends and I came here for a birthday celebration and booked the large room.  It was a good idea that we did because we got to sing all the songs we wanted without waiting and we also had a private bathroom!  The karaoke and sound system are more technologically advanced than some of the other karaoke bars I've seen.  Everything is touch screen.  The only downside was their selection of songs.  There were a lot of Chinese songs (which I understand since it is in Chinatown) but there wasn't much variety of English songs. There wasn't much service though.  If you need a drink or something to eat, you will have to walk out to the bar to order one.  Oh, and biggest mistake is for them not to serve tap water!!!!  They force you to buy bottled water for a ridiculous price!  Seriously?  I don't think that's legal by the way. But other than that fluke, everyone enjoyed themselves and it was overall a great time.",0.8556,0.842,0.099,0.06,0.44851190476190483
2010-08-15,2.0,"Sakura is a beautiful bar.  Very trendy, modern, swanky.  The service was good & the guy handling the karaoke was really helpful & accomodating.  The problem: they have the worst collection of English songs I've ever seen.  They have Kelly Clarkson, Beyonce, Madonna, The Bangles, Phil Collins, Bon Jov, and maybe 20-30 other artists.  It's not that it's a bad collection (I mean, I will sing the hell out of some Bon Jovi), it's that it was so, so, so limited.  Some of the artists only had one or 2 songs listed, and they didn't have songs by artists I commonly hear elsewhere, like Blondie, Sublime, Pat Benetar, Queen, Violent Femmes, Vanilla Ice, The Eagles, Journey, The Go-Gos, Bjork...I asked for artist after artist that they didn't have, and as you can see I'm not talking about obscure Indie rock.  I will definitely have to pass on this place in the future.  The bar is nice, but I went there for karaoke & that part was a let down.",0.0354,0.851,0.081,0.068,0.5466269841269842
2010-08-01,4.0,"A long night of bike riding and a discussion about Bryan Adams over dinner led us on a hunt for a karaoke place in Chinatown. A friend tipped us off to Sakura, and so we headed down (this place is in a basement, friends!) into the lounge.  Unfortunately for us, karaoke was not happening that night due to a party sponsored by Ultimate Vodka. We decided to stay and grab a drink instead. First impressions: it's pretty swanky in there--white couches, bar, and barstools made it look rather futuristic and sleek.  Though it was pretty empty when we walked in, the waitress informed us that the tables were reserved, but that we could sit at the bar. She finagled us three seats together and we ordered our first round of drinks. My lychee martini was amazing--sweet, booz-y, and with lychees as a garnish. If you're not a drinker, Sakura has a pretty extensive menu of non-alcoholic drinks as well as light snacks.  Music was loud and the vibe was very clubb-y, but I'd like to come back here for karaoke one night. The have a stage and private karaoke rooms available, so it would make for a fun night.",0.9604,0.868,0.116,0.015,0.5369444444444444

2010-03-09,3.0,"This is one of two karaoke bars in Chinatown. They have remodeled which makes it  look cleaner and trendier. But I don't like their tables setups. This is the one  when you are looking for a nicer place to have a drink and chill. If you go for singing karaoke, I'd recommend another one. Songs selections are kind of limited here if you are looking for popular hits to sing. I only go there on the weekends. And I've never been there during weekdays, Sometimes, it's not even busy in the weekends. The owner Kenny is a very cool guy. He likes to give us free drinks.",0.923,0.802,0.16,0.037,0.698265306122449
2010-02-07,4.0,"Who would ever think Chinatown would have something semi-decent enough to drag friends over for a few drinks? That's definitely the question I asked myself prior to going and even while walking down the stairs to this place.  Apparently, from the original reviews below.... they must have done a complete renovation in 2010 (went in Feb).  This place is surprisingly trendy, and the lighting is nice. Couches in the middle and about 4 to 5 other small booths around the bar. There are two smaller private karoake rooms around $30 to $35 / hour up to about 6-10 guests.  The large room is $45/hr up to 18 guests. [Pretty good price, but beware, the selections are very modern with some of the newest hits  BUT not a good selection of old school songs]. There is no cover to enter.  If you aren't in one of the open 3 rooms singing your heart out, you can always sing in the main area.  Free, but they say a $10 drink minimum if you use the main area equipment/karoaoke... which is reasonable given you're probably going to drink at east 2 drinks and others might  have to put up with your singing.  The bartenders seem to be relatively new to the nightlife scene, but they are trying.  Most of the crowd seems to be from HK/international... but still a good mix of Asian-Americans, Asians, and even quite a few Caucasians.  The Friday night bartender girl is very down to earth and the staff are relatively friendly.  Probably 70 to 80 people were there that night with a guy to girl ratio of 8 to 1... yeah.  Drinks are a great price: $6 for import beers, $5 for domestic, $7 for upscale mixed drinks (Belvedere Vodka, etc)  $6 for others. They give you free peanuts to munch on.  Check out this place sometime!",0.9886,0.861,0.125,0.013,0.45202868452868455
2009-11-09,4.0,"They have redecorated yet again.  This time, they've completely changed the whole atmosphere.  The new decor is way more chic and the bar has been redesigned and you can actually (*gasp*) sit at the bar!  They've removed all their sushi entirely and now only offer a few dishes for you to munch on - still very tasty selections.  They've completely re-focused their business and it's more karaoke/lounge-y now, with more private rooms for singing if you're the shy type, or a stage in the main room.  Their women's bathroom is also very cute and CLEAN - it used to be a hot mess before!  I love the remodeled look and definitely see myself coming here more often now. Their lychee martinis are still a must try.  They've also added this passion something (I forget the name) martini and that's currently my new fave.",0.9576,0.809,0.149,0.041,0.5111426767676768
