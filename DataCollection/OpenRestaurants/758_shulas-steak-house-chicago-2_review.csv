2017-04-12,3.0,"When you are traveling, and have a really tight schedule, you don't always have time to look for a new, exciting places to eat. Even if you have the time to look up a few places, you might not have the time to actually go to one. In this case, what you wish for is a great restaurant inside the hotel you are staying at. This is exactly what happened with me when I traveled to Chicago. I stayed at Sheraton Grand, and thankfully, they had a real restaurant in it. The inside was a nice size, much bigger than I expected. The restaurant is on the ground floor, and right by the hotel entrance, therefore, they have a street view. The interior is classic, with wood floor, dark furniture, and tables covered with white tablecloths. Lots of photos in sepia, creating kind of historic atmosphere. We were taken to our table with a football! Their signature steak menu was on the football, how cool is that? They do have more steak offerings on the actual menu, on paper. Since I was not super hungry (regrettably), I didn't order their steak. Instead, I ordered Pan-Seared Sea Scallops. The scallops were really nice and plump, soft and tasty. The roasted corn was sweet and flavorful, asparagus was crunchy and fresh, and bacon added that extra punch of deliciousness. Didn't get much truffle flavor, but it was still a good dish, I enjoyed it. My companion ordered one of their steaks and seems like he really liked the steak, as he devoured it all. The staff was really nice, friendly and polite. He made sure we were well taken care of. We didn't have to ask for anything.  It was a very pleasant, relaxing dinner, I wish if I was more hungry so I could have tried their steak...maybe next time.

The steak came late on a very hot plate (i.e. heat lamped!) clearly intended to be delivered when the food for the party next to me was ready not when my steak was ready.  The house salad with ""roasted artichokes"" had pickled artichokes from a can.  The dressing was goopy and screamed Sysco!   This is a perfect place for rich old people with no taste buds left and plenty to spend.  This meal would have been mediocre at 1/3 the price.  Tourist trap.

I have visited this establishment on several occasions and had the privilege of having Shaun as my bartender. His food recommendations have been spot-on and his drinks are balanced and made well. Most bartenders just want to take an order and leave. Shaun talks to you and makes you feel like part of the Shula's family.  I'd go back simply because of his service but thankfully their food is also worth it. Most steakhouses don't season their steak. That's their choice and many people love that. Me, I like a steak to not only be tender but also seasoned. Their filet cut like butter and was seasoned perfectly. The double baked potato was a little dry but that's okay. I was going in there for the meat, caesar salad and margarita tonight. If you're in there, ask Shaun to make you a drink not on the menu.

Trio seafood consisted of half a lobster, 2 large shrimps, and crab meats. The sauces consisted of cocktail, tartar sauce, and my favorite of the 3 is the last one with a pink looking color 'I couldn't tell what kind of sauce it is' The price is hefty $29... Nothing special about this dish. Tomato Salad with fresh mozzarella balls and basil with balsamic dressing. The salad is good but the balsamic dressing is just too much which makes the salad soaking wet. I'd prefer the dressing to be in the side and let the customer pour them over. The kitchen over did the dressing. Cowboy ribeye is juicy and tender but no flavor even though I have asked for the red pepper chimichuri as topping.

2014-07-20,2.0,"Shula's American Steakhouse Review ""Inattentive"" We dined at Shula's in Miami Beach back in 2001 and had a wonderful experience. My wife had a work-related dinner there last month, so she and my son decided to take me there for my birthday dinner last night. What a disappointing experience, though the steaks were great, as was the company. Everything else was a missed field goal Coach Shula: ""Wide Right"" as the saying goes. Before I start, it is noteworthy that the restaurant was more than half empty, so it was not a busy night. First, I asked our waiter--after we had been seated for over 15 minutes--about the oysters Rockefeller. He put in an order for me without ever returning to see if the others at our table wanted appetizers or a salad. BAD SERVICE! 30 minutes after he delivered my appetizer he returned to take our entrée orders, but no one ever came to clear the plate, or refill our waters. BAD SERVICE! The 16 oz NY Strips were perfectly prepared, as was the 12 oz Filet Mignon, but that is to be expected in a first class Chicago Steakhouse. After we finished our meal, they never asked if we wanted coffee or dessert!!!!! BAD SERVICE! Instead, after sitting without touching our plates for 30 minutes, the waiter bought a hotel dinner check, as if to say: ""get out!"" BAD SERVICE! (By now you've discerned a theme I hope). So other than good steaks, and a wonderful béarnaise sauce and red demi sauce (on the side, not on the steaks -- explicitly recommended by me that you order it that way), the mashed potatoes were horrible; they tasted like they had been prepared hours earlier and were so dry we could not eat them, not to mentioned they lacked seasoning entirely. The steamed asparagus was ridiculously cold. The steak fries were the only appetizing sides served with this meal (a la cart). The oysters were so small I thought they were clams! So let me go back to the very beginning, and to the very end with the same comment: Get a new hostess! I have never been to a fine dining establishment where I was greeted with less enthusiasm, and when we left she did not say ""goodbye"" or ""I hope you enjoyed your meal."" She was too busy flirting with an old guy seated at the bar to even acknowledge our departure, or the guest who was seeking directions to the restroom! BAD SERVICE! Chicago has many high-quality first class steak houses: Stenson's, Charmicheals, Firehouse, Sullivan's, Morton's, Kinzie Chophouse, Gibson's & Genie & Georgetti's to name just a few (ph). To be distinguished you have to have first class service; they all serve great steaks. This is where Shula's trails the pack.

I'm a picky eater.  I particularly don't care for hunks of fat on my steaks, and certainly no gristle. A steakhouse lives or dies on its steak. I ordered the 16 oz New York Steak.  And I ate all of it.  No scraps, no nothing.  I ate every last bit of it.  Oh sure, that last bite was kind of fatty and gristly, but the ghost of Don Shula (I know, I know... he's still alive) told me to either eat it or drop and give him twenty.  So I did it for Coach.  I ate it all. Because it was just that good.  No, it was amazing.  They had clearly fired it at high temp, and the nicely trimmed fat along the edge was almost bacon-y in texture and taste.  If I were to be reeeeaaaallly picky, I'd say that it was a little too salty, but this is small potatoes. Okay, the sides were all also very nice.  We tried the grilled asparagus (excellent), mashed potatoes (fine), potatoes gratin (good, but not as good as I hoped), and corn relish (meh).

I asked for a booth or remote table as my date and I had serious conversation ahead. We were taken to a table next to 3 teenage girls on a romp with daddys credit card and next to a family from Ohio . I asked to be moved more privately in the large mostly empty restaurant and was told open area seating was all the offer. This was b.s. as a man came in who was a regular and was seated alone tucked away as we had also asked. The woman who brought us to the table set this football on a plate a menu on the other did not welcome us nor held out the chair for my date. She also put her bare hands on the plates.  The waitress speedily ran through the ""best money can buy"" schtick. Ask for drink orders but took several reminders for me to get my tea. I asked that the plates be changed which cause her to launch into mocking us. "" These are display plates if you havent been to a better restaurant this is how it is presented we even have salad forks and butter knives.....you know what ill just take them now since you dont know that. "" i also asked her to take the football as my date is under five foot and i would rather look at her face and a football. Who the hell puts a ball on a tee in front of a vertically challenged guest.  The steak was very good. The fries great. The shrimp was warm. The baked potato was great except 4 requests for fresh ground pepper went ignored.  The chocolate cake was very good but dry.  Requests for lemons for the water was also ignored. Fortunately my warm raw shrimp cocktail came with lemon.  I realize i may look like a hick and maybe smell like one. But i do eat at NOMI and Les Nomades and Ruth Chris. I know what a salad fork is. I also know what a filthy disay plate looks like and that i dont want a woman who handles menus and shakes hands putting her paws all over the eating table.  If i wanted to pay 200+dollars to be mocked and ignored Ill just give the money to my teenage daughter.

2014-01-07,1.0,"Diners, Chicago has so much more to offer when it comes to both food and service! My latest, and definitely last, experience here was absolutely disappointing. After dining here in late November 2013, I contacted Shula's corporate offices about my awful experience. I sent them this email:  ""I am writing to comment on my recent experience at the Chicago Sheraton Shula's location. While visiting your restaurant this weekend, I was expecting the very same excellent service and fare I had experienced in previous visits. However, my family and I were highly disappointed with the entire experience and have no plans to return to this location in the future. Being in a prime tourist location, we were sure to make reservations in advance for our party of five. When we arrived, we were led out of the restaurant, through the lobby, down a hallway and into a room clad with tacky decor and absolutely no ambiance. It appeared to be a small banquet room where the only other table was a group of 20. It seemed a bit awkward, and almost felt as if we had infringed upon their party. We were seated and greeted by our waiter, who from the beginning appeared to be very annoyed by our table for no apparent reason. Our group was never loud or demanding, but all inquiries and comments directed toward the waiter were met with annoyance. Despite the strange seating arrangement and bothered server, my family was looking forward to the famous Shula's fare. Upon it's arrival, we were once again disappointed. While the food was fine, we expected a great meal for the price we paid. Nothing was noteworthy. We all joked that we should have ordered nothing but the crab macaroni and cheese because it was far more impressive than the steak and seafood entrees we had ordered. We finished up, paid the check, and went way disappointed. I wanted to bring this experience to your attention, as it does not align with the reputation of this restaurant. The food, service, and over all experience were less than impressive and exceedingly disappointing. I will not be returning to your establishment, but do hope you will pass this along to the location manager."" The manager of this location promptly emailed me with an apology, and invited me to email him back if I was willing to try Shula's again, as he would send me a gift certificate. Impressed by this gesture and recognizing that everyone and every place may have an off night, I emailed him back. It has been a month and NOTHING. No contact. No gift certificate.

2014-01-02,1.0,"This establishment is located inside of the Sheraton hotel. It gives off a sophisticated vibe as you enter, and has very dim lighting. Enough so you can see, but no more. We made reservations via open table a few hours before arriving, and were promptly seated on arrival. As far as the ""good"" of the visit, that's about it. It all went down hill from there. After we were seated, it took about 10-15 minutes before anyone even came to our table to give us the starting glass of water and ask for our drink order. I ordered the ""Shula's Special"" martini or some nonsense. That and my girlfriend's martini order took another 15 minutes. Now, you must also understand that this was a New Years Eve dinner and the diner was surprisingly not really that packed(I can see why now), so there was no reason for any of this to take that long. Anyway, once the waitress finally arrived, she managed to get my girlfriend's order wrong, and the waitress stated she would take it back and replace it. This never came to be - she simply walked away and the next time we saw her I simply asked for our check and we left to go to Timothy O' Toole's, which was completely booked upon arrival. So we had to head back to our hotel to finish off our night. The service of this restaurant completely screwed our New Years plans up and put a sour taste in our mouths until we could both drink our faces off at the Hyatt's BIG bar(check out the Gold Coast mixed drink!). The $35 check for 2 martinis(one being wrong) and the terrible service obviously show that this establishment could use some training, and should get off their high-horse. Just because the majority of their customers are tourists or young couples doesn't mean that their money is less valuable.  They definitely seemed to highly favor checking in on older-looking customers than us 20-somethings.

T-bone (medium)-It was really juicy and very flavorable (i know its not a real word). I like the cut but it wasn't my favorite. It has a little too much fat for my taste. To compare, the rib-eye I took home is more my flow and was DELICIOUS and I probably will stick with ordering a filet or rib-eye. I also ordered the crab mac and cheese, which was a big enough that i had plenty to take home.

I didn't order dessert bc I was stuffed with dinner. I ended up taking part of my T-bone home, along with the Ribeye and more than half the crab mac and cheese.

There seemed to be some sort of convention going on, so I was worried that the restaurant would be very busy and loud.  Surprisingly, it was relatively slow and quiet.  I am not sure about the autograph football menu.  Maybe the football fanatics appreciate the idea of it.  It just makes me question the cleanliness although I know menus don't get wiped down either.  I had the delicious crab cake for the appetizer, and the porterhouse steak.  I also got a side of asparagus and a glass of red wine.  The steak was flavorful, and cooked perfectly.  Our service was spectacular, and the ambiance was very relaxing and not pretentious.  Since it was the holidays, the restaurant was kind of quiet which was really nice to have a peaceful meal.  Made me think about home a little bit.  It is steak so the cost of the meal is still going to be pricey, but it was very delicious.  It is very competitive to other steak restaurants in the city.  I would certainly like to come back.",0.9787,0.816,0.168,0.016,0.5643857832988268
2012-02-07,4.0,"The 1972 Dolphins are fucking badass.  They had the No-Name Defense, they went undefeated and they used to ditch practice and party at Scarfaces' Mansion for days.... Logically this takes us to modern day Chicago. Comparing Shula's to Ditka's is inevitable in this city, but just like the 85 Bears vs the 72 Dolphins would have been, Chi-town takes the prize every time.  A place named after a Miami Dolphins Legend right here in Chicago, a place where you can actually eat a Dolphin for dinner if you feel like it....   Gladly Ditka's doesn't serve Bear on the menu, but I have seen some massive hairy gay guys being served at the bar,so I guess that makes them even. I had a Travelzoo groupon coupon and was here to use it before it expired. I had dinner with a friend who idolizes the Dolphins, especially the '72 squad; and considers Larry Csonka royalty.  We were pumped and ready to crush some fucking food when we got there. Know you got the background, here is the fucking show... Shit Everyone Talks about: Football is placed on the table and has the steak menu on it. Service is odd since you will have no less than 2 waiters Everything sounds very rehearsed and cold  Don't order the Mushrooms...even if you love them You can't see the prices (I will list them for you....you're welcome cheap ass!) Now that's off our chest we can get to the real review. Appetizer: Calamari They serve it with a homemade maranara, and a mild tartar sauce that also appears to be homemade. The calamari is the long chicken tender looking kind, so no O's or Spiders which I usually prefer. It was not bad but it was nothing to write home (or Yelp!) about either. it was about $12.00 Main Event: Surf and Turf I ordered the Surf and Turf, this is a 9oz Lobster Tail that is grilled to perfection and served with a drawn butter and a homemade mild tartar sauce that was the same as the one served with the calamari. The typical Filet Mignon that is served with the surf and turf is 8oz but for $5 you can upgrade that bitch to a 12oz, so you pretty much gotta do it. My buddy got the regular 8oz surf and turf and I was curious to see if my Filet would be noticeably bigger and it was. Steak was seasoned very well.  I got mine at a Med Rare temp and for a 12oz Filet I recommend to get this medium since 85% of the steak is rare. If you like your Steak a certain way, go up a temp when you order a Filet over 10oz just based on the thickness. The lobster tail was awesome and I started getting pissed when I realized I had about 3 bites left. This was about $85 on the regular but since I had that Travelzoo Groupon thing it knocked $48 off the entree or otherwise I would be writing a review of a Ruben Sandwich like that other loser did..... Side: Mushrooms These were fucking disgusting. I would not feed them to anyone. They looked really fucking slimy and gross. I really like mushrooms and these were nasty. I mean if they were going to take me on a magic carpet ride I will deal with the flavor, but for a steak house that is trying to be taken seriously in a competitive marketplace they need to do a better job here. I will say that I didn't miss them since the entree was so fucking good, but just be aware. Wine: Pino Noir (glass) - $10.00 Drinks: Belviedere and Soda with a Lime - $12.95 As we drank and actually had the same waitress come to our table a few times we got her to laugh and she loosened up making it a better experience. We made fun of the way they have to recite all the monotone bullshit about how awesome their steaks are and how they age them etc... EVERY PLACE DOES THAT TOO! I don't think its a messaging thing, its a delivery thing. Its hard not to notice and that is why I emphasize that here. Ambiance: Room was nice, had nice big windows with a deece view. Pictures of old school Dolphins adorn the walls and a replica Super Bowl trophy is positioned right up front to let you now what the fuck is what right when you walk in.  Weird: Lots of old motherfuckers were eating there, but it was a the day before the Super Bowl so who knows if that was the regular crowd. Just a odd mix of peeps. Looked like a lot of mid 50's dudes taking the wife out but now that the kids are old enough to do be home alone they really don't have anything to talk about any more, or necessarily like each other after all these years.....  Okay maybe that was just the 5 tables around me. This has nothing to do with the restaurant but it kind of killed my buzz a little which does kind of effect the mood and lively-ness of the place. Would I ever eat here again? I am not sure. The food was great but I thing Ditka's gives you more for the money, and this is a Steak House city. I would suggest they step their atmosphere game up and take the cold - lifeless service out of the training schedule.

He had always wanted to order one and finally did on his birthday. He enjoyed it, but said that he probably wouldn't order it again...at least not from Shula's. We also ordered a side of asparagus which tasted and looked wilted and burnt! Awful, we hardly ate any of it. Knowing it was my husband's birthday, they presented him with a chocolate cake at the end of the meal - to my surprise they charged me for this piece of cake which cost $12.95!!! I wish staff would have told me I would be charged for this! Unacceptable!  I gave Shula's a one star rating as the food was horrible, but I must at least say our server was friendly and the manager of the hotel restaurant came by to check on us - again, I regret not telling her about the half eaten cherry in my drink!

The atmosphere is as many have described- very typical of a steakhouse type restaurant. It is surprisingly roomy with a great view of the city outside. Our food was excellent but I'm only giving it 4 stars because I felt that the service left much to be desired. When I'm paying $200 for dinner for 2 people, I'd expect my service to be top notch. Instead the hostess was robotic at best.....then the greeter/server/busser combination of men stopping by our table was confusing. It was hard to understand many of them and they were trying to joke and be funny and they often ending up just interrupting my client and I. Furthermore, small things like this- my client stopped one of the hostesses walking by and asked for a cup of coffee. She looked very inconvenienced and said, ""I'll find your server so he can get that for you"" -- that's NOT the right reply (and if you've read my reviews you know I've worked in the restaurant biz for 10 years or so during high school and college, I KNOW what good service is and it's not that difficult to do)- she should have simply said, ""No problem sir, right away."" instead of scoffing at us and letting us know it wasn't really ""her job"".

2009-10-26,3.0,"I should have known better after reading the reviews on Yelp that this was going to be a disappointing experience.  I needed last min reservations for a steakhouse and Shula's had the only available slot for the time we wanted. So, reluctantly I booked it.  When we first walked in, the place stunk like old sweat or dirty rags. It was so gross that I was ready to walk out! Even though we had reservations, we still had to wait 10 mins to be seated which I didn't understand why because there were a few empty tables when they seated us.  We ordered 2 drinks from the bar while we waited and it came out to $30!!! I don't think I've ever ordered drinks that was so expensive! It's not like we ordered top quality wine.. It was only hard liquor. Although the drink I ordered wad the size of my head so maybe that's how they justified the price?? The food was mediocre as well. The cocktail shrimp was not as crunch or fresh as I thought it should have been considering how much they were charging for them. The presentation was also very sad looking as it was 4 shrimps on a small plate; there was no pazzaz whatsoever.  The steak on the other hand was good - not great, but solid. The Bearnaise sauce on the side was very tasty. We also got a side of lobster mash potatoes and I was very, VERY disappointed. I guess just because they put 2 mini pieces of lobster on top, they can call it ""lobster mash potatoes??"" We might have very well ordered regular mashed potatoes for $4 less!  We did decide to order desert, but the original one we ordered was going to be a minimum of 60 mins, but our primary waiter told us it was only going to be 30-45 mins. We found out when the 2nd waiter came by (and asked if we wanted coffee), and told us that particular desert was going to take 60 mins and not 30-45 mins! We decided to go with a different desert that took only 30 mins instead of 60. I don't understand why the 1st waiter decided to skip out on telling us the full truth. After all the drama, the desert was good, but just like rest of the meal, it was very mediocre.

While able to leave the restaurant under my own power, I quickly settled into a deep food coma once returning to the office.  This account has become a oft told, almost legendary, tale among those that were there.  However, unlike some legends, time has not added any embellishments to it.  It's all true and is remains the height of my culinary gluttony.",0.9855,0.825,0.151,0.024,0.5032266009852215

We had reservations at 5:30pm. The dining area doesnt open until 5:30p and we arrived early so we hung out in the front looking at pictures. A few couples arrived after us and the hostess asked them if she could take their coats. We were still wearing ours and she never asked to take our coats. I dont know why.... We had two servers attend to us the entire dinner. This was great. Both were very nice and helpful.  We expressed that we were interested in the restaurant week menu but they still explained the full steak menu in case we changed our minds. If you are going here for restaurant week let me warn you that the choices are slim. Starter is either potato leek soup or cesar salad. Entree is 10 oz Shula cut steak. And dessert is apple cobbler. Total cost $32. (avg cost of regular steak alone is $40)  I was a little disappointed that we didnt have choices for another entree or dessert dish.  The steak was OK. It wasnt very juicy or flavorful. The only side it came with (that was included in the meal) was broccoli. Not much flavor in that either even though they provided Hollandaise sauce (I'm not a fan of Hollandaise sauce so I didnt bother with it). I've had better steaks at David Burke's Primehouse and Gibson's. Parking was super easy.
