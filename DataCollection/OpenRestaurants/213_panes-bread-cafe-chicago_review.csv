The lady on the phone said we could either come back in and pick up the dressing, or she could give me a credit for dressing on a future order. How does one give a credit for just dressing, when it's included in the salad and not an additional cost? Poor customer service - she cared more about giving us a $8 credit for a future salad than retaining a long term customer. Very dissapointed.",0.9093,0.84,0.125,0.035,0.3032051282051282

I had the spicy philly which was kinda like a cheese steak with a bit of chipotle mayo thrown in there. It was absolutely incredible. and despite only costing about $7.50, I got two meals out of it (admittedly had an appetizer to start with). Great, quaint atmosphere with a bit of random everything, but again perfect for when you're not sure what you want. The pizzas look quite good and they have salad and even pasta options.

A generous plate of chicken, scrambled eggs and tortillas with green tomatillo sauce + cream and queso fresco. Sided with breakfast red potatoes, this was a real winner. My kids had the mac & cheese which was made from scratch and really good. A highlight of this breakfast was the banana bread --which is made from scratch and baked in-house! This tasted gloriously while sipping my coffee before my chilaquiles came. Really good service, very clean and priced right. I cannot say enough good things about this place.

2015-06-20,4.0,"While I was in Chicago visiting a friend we were trying to decide on what to do for lunch. Subway came up as an option and I mentioned maybe we try something unique to Chicago since I can get Subway back home anytime. She suggested Panes and I double checked to make sure I could get a sandwich, since I was really wanting one at this point and she said yes. So we drove over there and parked on the street.  I decided I wanted a Turkey Club and ordered and just as I was getting out my credit card, the woman working said they don't take credit, it was cash or check only. Being that I didn't have any cash on me, my friend picked up my tab.  I ordered the turkey club, with no cheese and a water. I asked for a pickle, because I'm pregnant and really, what pregnant woman doesn't love pickles? I mean, come on! But they didn't have pickles, so, better luck next time. The sandwich comes with a side of potato chips (which to me, tasted like Lays). I asked for water and she pointed me to this little side bar, that had a set up for old fashioned plastic glasses and a little freezer well for ice and a special little spout, just for water. It was quite cute. After my friend finished ordering and paying, they gave her a number to put on a stand when we chose a table.  I went and got water and sat down. The cafe itself is cute and small. It has very tall ceilings and an open feel. It has about 12 tables inside, maybe 15 at most and a seating area outside as well. After I sat down, I noticed an ATM, in case you didn't have cash.  They brought our food out within 5 minutes of sitting down and everything looked great. Once I took one bite of my sandwich I realized I had been there before. I asked my friend if her brother lived near there and she said he did, about a block away (at one time, he's since moved) and I asked if she had brought me there before and she remembered a time when we had been there. How funny! Something as simple as a turkey sandwich, but I remembered it from my past, and about 13 years ago too I might add. So if that says anything about the flavor. It definitely stands out.  We spent some time reminiscing from that visit so many years ago and I noticed she didn't order a sandwich, but she had what appeared to be eggs. I asked what it was and she told me Chilaquiles Verdes. Which I had never heard of before. However, my well traveled friend, who recently spent close to a year in Mexico, knew exactly what they were and explained the ingredients to me. Crispy tortilla strips, simmered in fresh green tomatillo sauce, shredded chicken breast, scrambled eggs and potatoes. She offered a bite to me and I gave it a try. It was pretty good, with a little spicy kick to it.  After we were done eating we bussed our own table and put our stuff in the designated area. It was good, so good I remembered it from so many years ago. What a nice blast from my past. I'd recommend giving it a try if you're in the area, it's a quaint little cafe.",0.996,0.858,0.132,0.01,0.49944366635543136

I ordered a sandwich - often the Oaxacan Pork or Turkey Turkey - and asked that half be packed to go for dinner while I ate the other half in house. They were more than obliging and even gave me extra chips each time (hopefully it wasn't a pity move!). I live a block away and use Panes as my regular go-to for something fast, delicious, and time-saving. Their Monster Cookie is the best little gift to lock up for a friend or roommate who is feeling down; the homemade bread selection doesn't leave me wanting for a neighborhood bakery.

2015-01-18,4.0,"The Pollo Diablo sandwich made on their fresh baked Tomato Bread is something to write home about. When it comes to dining out, I never choose chicken because nothing compares to the tender, juicy beer-can chicken off the grill at home. But Yelpers convinced me to try this Pollo Diablo sandwich here at Panes, and I am so glad I did. Juicy, delicious and sooooooo tender! This sandwich is described on the menu to have some kick to it, but I never discern such. I think they dilute the sriracha with too much mayo.  FYI, when I ask for onions added to any of their sandwiches, all they have to offer are sweet caramelized onion. I like happen to enjoy these onions, but some people probably wouldn't --they are super sweet! They are so sweet in fact, I had to inquire about their preparation. And the answer is yes, the onions are caramelized with sugar. Stuffed mushrooms are well executed, and the surrounding marinara sauce is a great touch, but... $3.75 for 4 small 'shrooms is steep. Taking home fresh loaves of bread is always a win. They are super delicious and very reasonably priced. I like the country white for homemade grilled cheese.  I love how they roast the vegetables for the sandwiches, rather than putting them on an oily grill. I am usually afraid to order Portabella sandwiches at any restaurant, because I know that mushroom is a sponge for oil. Panes takes the danger out of ordering mushrooms; their roasting process is spot on!  Go to Panes and order off their menu freely. I'm quite certain everything is a win.  They just know how to create tasty stuff. But with that said, whatever you choose, do not order a monster cookie! I repeat: Do NOT order a monster cookie.

I ordered a breakfast sandwich with bacon and cheddar and a cup of coffee.  In short order, a paper-lined plastic basket was delivered to my table with my sandwich and an order of breakfast potatoes.  The sandwich was divine!  The eggs were perfectly cooked, there was just enough cheese, and the bacon was crispy (without asking!)  The bread was pillowy soft, but not in a wonder-bread kind of way.  In a we-know-how-to-bake-delicious-bread way.  I don't like a sandwich that has such hard bread that the fillings go splat! right onto the table. The potatoes were rather bland, even with the little cup of ...chili sauce? that came with it.  I was expecting some kind of hot sauce, but it was only a little bit spicier than ketchup.   The dining room of this little place is so cute.   There's an eclectic mix of signs and pictures, but my favorite is a painting that looked like it was WPA-era (it wasn't) and depicted bread-making as being similar to giving birth.  I guess it's not far from the truth, actually.  Isn't bread the staff of life?  And the bread here is really, really good.",0.9723,0.85,0.117,0.034,0.6818783068783069

The Pizza Bread appetizer/starter was pretty bland and my Pollo Diablo was served on some pretty tasty bread but was light on filling...this ended up being a blessing in disguise, since I walked to DMK next door for a stellar chocolate shake.  The potato chips on the side were also pretty plain and there were not many of them.  But I love anything BYO and the outdoor patio was perfect two days ago for sitting outside with my big (11 peeps) team of friends.

Came in with the boyfriend on a snowy Saturday morning and it was basically empty. Panes has a casual atmosphere with a great homey feel to it. You order at the counter and then find a seat. We had a really difficult time deciding what to order, they have several omelet, egg scramble, and breakfast sandwich options. I ended up going with the roast beef egg sandwich and the boyfriend got an egg scramble with  veggies that he added bacon to. Our breakfast was incredibly inexpensive, I think the prices at Panes are a few dollars less than most breakfast places in the area.  Our food was up quickly and brought to our table. My sandwich was phenomenal! Plenty of perfectly cooked roast beef, muenster cheese, sweet caramelized onions, and scrambled egg on, what was definitely, a freshly baked sandwich roll. The flavors complimented each other so well and I had to forfeit some monster bites to my dining companion because it was so huge. The sandwich came with really tasty roasted potatoes. The boyfriend had an egg scramble with veggies and bacon that was incredibly flavorful. It also came with the roasted potatoes and a green salsa.

Its placement just a block away from CorePower Yoga, its delicious tomato bread, large sandwich menu, and adorable atmosphere has enticed me to return again and again. I just scarfed down a whole sandwich between the Wellington station and Fullerton, if that's any indication if how delicious these sandwiches are. Or how hungry I was. Or how shameless I am.

So far I've had the Popular (a chicken sandwich on tomato bread with caramelized onions), the Turkey Turkey, and the portobello sandwich. The Turkey Turkey was, by far, my favorite. The other two were lacking slightly in flavor, but still gobbling-down-worthy. So next time you are in the market for a $7ish sandwich, head on over to Panes and eat some good food.

I've lived in the neighborhood nearly my entire life, and have been to Panes several times throughout the years, and after eating there today I finally felt compelled to write a review.  First off, their bread is really nothing to write home about. The roll I had today was just about one step up from a hamburger bun, and on par with a grocery store bought French roll. And the turkey they serve is just awful! I mean slimy, super processed, doesn't even mildly resemble what would come from a real turkey awful! I also shared a chicken sandwich with my husband and it was just edible (which is more than I could say for the turkey).  The only reason I gave this place two stars is because at least the prices are reasonable, and the only reason I've given this place so many tries is because it's close to my house, and sandwiches are my husband's favorite food. But we both agreed that today is officially our last time eating at Panes.  In a city full of amazing restaurants there is no need to waste your time, money or calories at Panes. If you want a great sandwich head over to Birchwood Kitchen and get a taste of what flavor and quality really are. And if you want something cheaper, stick with Jimmy John's or Potbelly's ... both are better than Panes!",0.9686,0.831,0.128,0.041,0.5609722222222223

The trip up to Chicago usually involves an hour long planning session detailing when my friends and I will go to Panes and what we will order.  That is usually followed up by three hours of narratives chronicling our favorite Panes sandwiches from days gone by. I'm not exactly sure what makes the sandwich so great.  I've tasted all the ingredients on their own and each is delicious but not exactly captivating.  Together, though, it all combines for an ambrosial and divine taste that is the perfect combination of salty and sweet.   For $5.95 you get the Super Panes and a bag of Lays potato chips.  You might think that is a yawn-inducing side but somehow the chips go perfectly with the sandwich.  Perhaps because it is hard to complain about anything when you are biting into a Super Panes.  For a few minutes, everything is right in the world. When I get back to St. Louis, I pretty much sit at home, stare out the window, and wait until I can go to Chicago and be reunited with a Super Panes.",0.9944,0.754,0.205,0.04,0.6133174603174603

When I was anticipating new Seinfeld episodes, living and hanging out in pre-hot, pre-self-conscious Andersonville, eating at The Dellwood Pickle on Friday nights, tooling around in my '93 Camry, debating O.J.'s guilt or innocence? Well, yeah. I coulda. And recently I found what I was missing. Another fine sandwich place in East Lakeview. My friend Heathcliff and I came in for a Friday Old Man lunch. The place was consistently busy but never crowded. The only challenge was the strollers. Kind of a cozy and close place which I don't think was necessarily contemplating strollers. But the clientele was a mix of local professionals, and young families. We ordered The Turkey, Turkey, and the BLT, and did the old bite 'n switch by sharing very generous-sized halves. Both sandwiches were scrumptious mouthfuls of fresh, fresh bread and an exciting combo of meats, cheese, veggies and avocado. I am officially going to stop making my own sandwiches. There are too many other people who make them better. Love the casual bakery vibe here, too. Loaves to take away, of course. Even though a polite little sign almost apologized for a price increase, all of their choices whether salads, sides, pasta dishes and sandwiches, are all very reasonable. Their generous and toothsome sandwiches are all around $5.95. They would be twice as much at Jerry's, for example. So even the prices are kind of 1994. I'm so happy I finally made it here.

If I lived close by, I could see myself stopping by regularly for a quick bite, but I wouldn't go out of my way to try this place again. It's a cute, hole in the wall type spot. The seating is overly cramped, and on a Saturday at noon, there was a steady line of people, so don't expect to enjoy a leisurely lunch or a comfortable chat after finishing.  Water is self-serve, with an ice-bin and ice-scoop that are probably health code violations if I've learned anything from watching Restaurant Impossible. Also, it's cash only! The prices here are great - 5.95 for their blackened tilapia sandwich special, which came with chips on the side.  The sandwich was very solid, but nothing that blew my mind - the fish was surprisingly flavorful and well seasoned, and with none of that ""fishy"" taste I was half expecting.  The garlic mayo was better than I expected.  But, the sandwich was pretty greasy, with the bread in particular rather than the actual innards, somehow being oily to the point that when I touched the bread it left a film of oil on my fingers. I agree with a previous reviewer that a side of something lighter like salad or fruit would have been much better than chips, which tasted exactly like Lay's. Summary - solid, good-tasting sandwich, but overly greasy and nothing out of the norm - a good option for a neighborhood joint if you live in the area that offers a simple, quick bite.",0.9933,0.774,0.194,0.033,0.455072039072039

I came here on a Thursday for lunch with some co-workers, and the tables were surprisingly full for a neighborhood place. It is sort of cramped inside, so maybe it just made it feel packed. You order at the counter, and they give you a number for your table. Then when your food is ready, they bring it to your table. That's how it works. Nothing too revolutionary, but it got the job done. I ordered the Turkey, Turkey sandwich, which has turkey breast, chopped avocado, roasted red peppers and spicy mayo on tomato bread. OMG! I already want another and then one for the road. It was so delicious. The sandwich was soft and juicy everything I could have ever hoped for. The flavors were spot on. I ate the whole thing without a problem. Delish! It came with potato chips.  I thought the menu was very reasonably priced. My sandwich was $5.95; all of their sandwiches range between $5.25 and $5.95. Not bad at all. They also offer salads, pizzas, pastas and omelets. Then, of course, they have cookies and other sweets. Lots of variety. I guess the only negative I had is that it's cash only. I actually didn't have any cash on me at the time, so my co-worker had to front the money. It worked out fine, but if I had been alone, they would have lost my business. I know places don't want to pay credit card transaction fees, but they're missing out on a lot of business by not accepting credit cards. It's kind of my pet peeve.

We split an order of Pasta salad which was a huge, flavorful portion with artichoke hearts, lemon zest, feta, sun dried tomatoes, olives and an amazing dressing.

The fresh tomato bread it was served on was soft and delicious. The pesto was flavorful and perfectly complimented the pieces of portobello. The sandwich, served with kettle chips, was so large, we each took half for later. It was just as delicious hours later!

Don't order pasta!  She wasn't crazy about it, as it was quite generic.  I tasted it and found it to be pretty bland myself. Atmosphere is pretty average.  Small place with a decent amount of small tables inside.  Probably 4 or 5 outdoor tables along the sidewalk.  We like to sit our here to people watch.  Never a dull moment in Lakeview.  Big plus - they tie a water bowl up outside and keep it fresh for the pups.  Love that play. FYI - this place is cash only.  If you happen to forget, though, there is an ATM across the street.  Just don't leave your card in it like I did!

Panes is the picture-perfect epitome of a hole-in-the-wall--a delightful, relatively undiscovered culinary gem offering delicious, homemade comfort food. My friends and I came here a lot as starving grad students. The owner is Canadian (yay!) and a Parisian-trained chef. Virtually everything is made from scratch, and you can really taste that. My absolute favorite item was the Chocolate Coca-Cola Cake with cream cheese frosting. Chocolate + Coca-Cola? How can anyone say no to that? The cake was always so moist and delicious with the perfect amount of frosting. I enjoy frosting, but it's often too overwhelmingly sweet for me. I could have eaten this frosting by the bucketload. One time, in a fit of culinary ecstasy, I ended up buying 3 slices of the chocolate coca-cola cake to take home with me. The owner laughed and gave me a 4th slice on the house. Score! Other great items include the monster cookie, pretty much any sandwich (as the bread is made from scratch) and the pasta with vodka cream sauce.

The first time i was here i tried the Sunny California (2,5/5) vegetarian sandwich. It was later in the evening and they were about to close. I dont know why but this sandwich was not good. The ingrediences were not well balanced and the bread was not fresh anymore. Moreover it was simply boring. I think it is not good at any time because there is no leading ingredience its only lettuce on a sandwich. When i was there i bought a carrot cake, a cookie and a brownie for the next day. The carrot cake (5/5) was overwhelming, very good, very moist and not to sweet (very important) one of the best i had. The cookie was also pretty good (4,5/5) just how you want it. The peanut butter brownie (4/5) was very good but as i am not the guy that like very heavy stuff, it was a little bit to much for me but i couldnt give it less than 4 stars because the taste was really good. After these delicious sweet desserts i thought maybe i should go there again and try one of their more recommended sandiwches so i tried the Pollo Diablo (5/5) which was genious and one of the best sandwiches i ever had. The bread killed me :D. I tried some other desserts, too. The Monster cookie (4/5), lime cheese cake (3,5/5) and white chocolate rice pudding (3,5/5) which were okay.

Panes is hands down where I go to get a delicious sandwich not just in my neighborhood, not just in Chicago, but IN THE WORLD.  The Oaxacan pork tenderloin, roasted peppers, and spicy mayo sandwich is the front-runner for my favorite sandwich IN THE WORLD, but I've had sampled many tasty runner-ups. If you must stray from the Oaxacan, the Spicy Philly and Sloppy Pollo are also delicious. The bread and the sauces make these sandwiches, so don't try to modify  perfection or I can't vouch for your order. I have also had the breakfast egg sandwich which applies the same winning equation of fresh rosemary bread and ranchero sauce. The Greek salad is also very fresh and flavorful if you're looking for lighter fare. I give Panes 5 stars, because I just can't resist the sandwiches. In all fairness though, the service is pretty slow, they don't accept credit cards, and their desserts are terrible. The brownie is dense, but tastes chalky, and the m&m cookie looks softer than it really is. I also would pass on the goat cheese crostini and the pizzas. Their fantastic bread just isn't pizza dough. Ignoring all that, Panes does deliver and you can order take out in advance, they are cheap, and the restaurant dinning area is super cute for a nice Sunday morning brunch.

I live just down the street and started frequenting Panes about three years ago.  They had a cute little place, great prices and the food was INCREDIBLE! The service is okay, but I think the girls who work there are just shy, so I can respect that. The owner is a professionally trained chef who broke off from the restaurant scene years ago to open this delicious little cafe/deli/bakery  hybrid.  They make all of their food from scratch - right down the the bread (you can buy fresh bread there).   Up until recently, they never missed a beat - fresh breads, fresh fruit and vegetables, amazing service.  But recently, probably within the past three months, they have, well, kind of sucked.  On more than a few occasions the food has been yucky.  For example, I ordered a container of their fresh fruit only to find it practically fermented from being so old (no joke).  The melon was literally translucent from being in the container for so long.  And just last night, I ordered a Chicken Quesadilla (it comes with homemade salsa and mashed potatoes).  I got home from picking up my order to discover no mashed potatoes (bummer, I was feeling sick and really wanted those bad boys) and the salsa was fermenting!  The salsa has been a problem several times in the past. What is with the fermentation of their produce!?  I'm not exaggerating, the stuff was literally fermenting.  It was disappointing to see that half of my meal was missing, too. I will say that I ordered a piece of their delicious Coca Cola cake and it was every bit as wonderful as I remembered.   I really, truly love this place and I love giving this small business my service.  I also don't mind that it's cash only...shoot, if I had a small business I would do the same thing!  I just wish they'd watch some things, take the time to throw out old bread/fruit/salsa and keep the freshness going.

However, I recently had such a bad experience and downright rude service, I will not be going back. We ordered takeout, and I chose a pasta that was supposed to come with artichokes, spinach, sundried tomato pesto and goat cheese. My husband picked up the order, and what I got was plain pasta with a few peices of eggplant, a couple chunks of raw tomatoes and a glob of goat cheese on top - no sauce.  I called and explained the mix-up, and the first person I spoke with did say if I brought the pasta back, they would make me the dish I ordered. However, given that it would have taken me another 30-45 minutes to walk back myself, exchange it, and go back home to eat it, I asked if they could just credit me for the pasta. She said, ""Oh, I don't know..."" So I asked if there was someone else she could ask. Another person then got on the phone (I assume this was the manager) and told me that was the pasta I ordered. I read her the description from the menu I had, but she told me they changed the menu, and I had in fact ordered the dish I received, and I must have an old menu. No apology whatsoever. I had an out of date menu, and that was all she would offer me. (Why would you change a menu, but continue to use the same names if the dishes had changed? But I digress...) So I asked one last time if there was anything she could do, and she simply said ""no."" I then told her that they would be losing our business since they refused to do anything to rectify the mix-up. She said, ""ok."" I then told her I'd be writing a yelp review as well, and again, she just said, ""ok."" It could have easily been fixed with a promise to credit me next time, or even just a simple apology.

Not to mention the fact that the 4 customers that came in after me got their food first.  And it's not that I ordered anything elaborate, it was a BLT.  How hard can that be to make, and to make quickly? After the 4 other customers received their orders I asked a woman why I hadn't gotten my food yet.  She checked in the kitchen and nonchalantly said it would be right out, and a couple minutes later it was finally ready. Once I realized I had gotten a parking ticket I went back and saw the girl I had asked about my food.  I was visibly upset but I was not yelling when I started to show her my ticket and tell her that they lost a customer.  In mid sentence she walked away and mumbled something about getting the manager.  I said that wasn't necessary, all I wanted to do was let them know that they had lost a customer because their service was so terrible.  She wouldn't listen to anything I said and kept walking away from me. There was a busboy standing there so before I walked out I told him that I will never be back because it is ridiculous to wait for 25 minutes for a BLT, AND get a parking ticket because of the wait. I was not interested in talking to the manager because I had already wasted enough of my short lunch break.  But also, I wasn't seeking compensation.  I know they won't pay for my ticket and I don't want my next lunch to be free, or whatever else they might do, because I will never be back.",-0.9461,0.889,0.033,0.079,0.410561224489796

So I was pleasantly surprised after that back and forth, this decidedly not warm loaf of cranberry bread was moist and wonderful and the butter was soft so it spread oh so easily, this good size loaf was easily consumed most with butter but when we went through all our butter rations and a third of that beautiful bread loaf still sat winking at me...I dove in dry, holy good even unbuttered batman, it was still wonderful and soon it was all gone!

The neighborhood is a lot of fun and I thought that I'd found a new sandwich spot (yes, it's bread with stuff in the middle but getting it right is an art form). Sadly, I have not. Why? 1.) The service. For most of my visit, I thought I was at an ice cream shop -- I got the cold shoulder. Yikes. I understand that everyone has bad/off days, but I interacted with three people and all three avoided eye contact, acted as though they wanted to be anywhere than at Panes and doing anything else than helping me. I was beginning to develop a complex but I was relieved (ha!) to see that patrons after me were treated in a similarly dismissive way. 2.) The food. It wasn't bad but it wasn't memorable. It's times like these that i am glad I make notes about my business experiences. Hey, it's a job. I take it seriously. I ordered 'The Popular' and by description, I can understand the name: chicken, carmelized onions, spinach, peppers, and provolone. It's also supposed to be served on tomato bread. Mine was not. I don't know whether they ran out or made a mistake, but I ate my sandwich on a crunchy baguette. I am not a baguette kind of guy because, invariably, the hard sonsofb!tches rip up the roof of my mouth. This one was no different. The sandwich was not enjoyable and not what I ordered. 3.) Lack of attention. The bread thing shouldn't have happened. Either the person making my sandwich didn't know how to make it (problem), didn't care what s/he was doing (problem) or couldn't be bothered to tell me the difference in the item on which I spent my money (problem). In any of these scenarios, I can't find a satisfactory answer. When coupled with the bizarre service, it's more proof to me not to come back. Luckily for them, I am a fatty with a sweet tooth. The monster cookie came out of nowhere to give me good lovin', rock me through the night, light my cigarette, AND make me breakfast in the morning. That cookie saved this review.

I am not necessarily hard to please, but this place did not get the job done. My boyfriend got the linguine with chicken and spicy tomato sauce. It was bland and the pasta was kind of soggy. I got a small salad with honey mustard dressing (which tastes nothing like honey mustard and a lot like mayo) and the chicken club sandwich. Halfway through my meal I took off the remaining chicken because it was flavorless...other than charred flavor. After that, the sandwich did get better but at that point I was just eating cheese, tomato, avocado, and bacon on bread (which is not a bad combo but not what I ordered).

Accordingly, I've been there numerous times over the past few years and make sure to take out-of-towners for lunch. It has always been well received. All you need to know is this place offers infinitely better food for the same price as any of the chain places (Subway, Potbelly, Quiznos, etc.). The space itself is tight/cozy but theres a fair amount of seating crammed into it. It does get crowded at lunch and the table turnover can get slow at times. But between the decor and people it definitely feels like a busy cafe which is cool if you have a seat to take it all in. Usually the same woman takes the order; I'm guessing shes the owner or manager. The process seems a bit robotic and at times has reminded me of the Seinfeld Soup Nazi, but true to the show the food is worth it. Sandwiches, pastas, salads and pizza anchor the menu and everything I've had has been most excellent - I'm partial to the BLT. Additionally theres usually a good variety of deserts, sweets and cookies that are worth the trip themselves. They also offer several different fresh loaves of bread or baguettes that are great for dinner at home. The Sweet French is delicious.

I got the portabello - it was decent, but not that flavorful. A friend got the turkey sandwich and he was grossed out by the fact it was pressed and processed turkey as opposed to sliced turkey. I got a fountain coke, it was way watery as if it didn't have enough syrup and when I asked my friends about their fountain drinks, the root beer had too much syrup, but the diet coke was just right. I heard the chicken soup was divine, but the bread that accompanied it had a moldy taste to it. Due to the coke tasting oh-not-so-good, I got a glass of water. It had some funky taste to it.

As time as gone on this sandwich has dwindled down to mostly just bread. I ordered this tonight and felt I had to review for the mere fact that this is shitty. I cannot handle 1 slice of thinly sliced tomato on each half along with a couple red peppers and maybe just maybe one small (TINY) mozzarella ball on each half. That's just crap.

2009-06-15,5.0,"""Loaves of Bread"" is the translation from Spanish, for the word ""Panes."" I have no idea if that is the orgin of the name; but if so, the owners are not doing their cafe justice.  The homemade, fresh-baked bread is outstanding, but only one part of their quality menu. Panes offers appetizers, salads, pastas and homemade desserts, but the stars of the menu are their delicious sandwiches.  I've been going to Panes for nearly 10 years and have never been disappointed in the consistent quality of their food. My favorite sandwich is the Oaxacan Pork - marinated pork loin, caramelized onions, spicy mayo and roasted red peppers - all on melt-in-your-mouth, warm-baked bread. Flavorful and tender, spicy and sweet - this sandwich is a winner.  I also like the Todo Italiano - homemade pesto grilled chicken, roasted red peppers, provolone cheese and thin sliced prosciutto. Or try The Popular - chicken breast, caramelized onions, spinach, roasted peppers and provolone cheese on tomato bread.  And guess what? All sandwiches are less than $6 or $7.  The only drawbacks about Panes: the crowds can sometimes make the wait a little long, and there is not a lot of seating.  For take-out orders, try calling in advance to avoid the wait.  Panes is one of the best and most affordable little cafes in the city. It's much more than the ""Loaves of Bread"" name would lead you to believe.",0.9928,0.814,0.169,0.017,0.5559027777777779

I love the California sandwich, it's full of veggies and has avocado. Panes also has amazing baked goods. The best is the everything cookie, seriously can not go wrong. The only bad thing I have to say is they always seem to be out of wheat bred.

The bread is excellent, some of the best I've had in the city. The elements of the sandwich are tasty and they even toast/warm the whole thing a bit before serving it to you with chips. And they are cheap, about $6 after tax. The one consistent thing is that they tend to skimp on the protein. I had a Turkey Turkey last night and there was about 3oz of turkey on the sandwich, which is not a lot for a store-bought sandwich. This problem hits home a little harder in the salad arena. Their salads are served with rosemary bread, which is the best part of the meal. The salads themselves are alright but are not filling at all. They have way too much lettuce and even if the description says it includes chicken, there are about 4 small pieces of chicken in it. So I definitely recommend this place if you want a pretty good sandwich on fantastic bread.

This cozy neighborhood stop cooks up some of the best sandwiches, pastas, and desserts in the area! Most includes their delicious and hearty homebaked breads, which unlike the fancy breads of nearby Bittersweet, are much more rustic. Lets start with the appetizers. I almost always get an appetizer when I am here, because they have two of my favorites in town: GOATCHEESE CROSTINI - which is their toasted bread with huge helpings of amazing goat cheese and sundried tomato relish and HONGOS RELLENOS - which as large mushrooms crammed with mouthwatering cheese, spinach and chopped mushrooms, all in a tomato basil sauce. Yum! I've not tried any of their Pizzas or Salads, but I've tried most of their Pastas and Sandwiches, and have no complaints. Standout pastas include the SPICY PENNE and FUSILLI CON JAMON. My favorite sandwich is the SUPER PANES (bacon, turkey, ham, swiss, lettuce, tomato and honey mustard) but my mother always likes getting the Portabella mushroom sandwich. They have a white board inside that changes with daily specials, always offering some great non-menu options (their soups are always spectacular).  At the end of the meal, grab a dessert (I recommend the lemon custard with fresh blueberries, if they have it) and don't forget to grab a loaf of savory or sweet bread to take home with you! The only two things to watch out for are 1) It is a small place and it gets crowded around rush times. During the summer there is a bit of outdoor seating, which is lovely. 2) They only take cash!

Pretty good selection of sandwiches, although many if not most of them are vegetarian. That's great if you're into that kind of thing, but me, well I'm just not. If we weren't meant to eat animals, then why are they made of meat? Why are they so delicious? They serve breakfast until late; I think 3pm.

They hooked it up with a free refill on the coffee.  Not much impressed by the following:  - The line has nowhere to go but woven amongst the tables, which can be awkward. - Many of the tables are pushed together in an effort to get them all to fit in the restaurant, which means you'll likely be dining elbow to elbow with a new friend. And some other people in a line right next to you. - Cash only. Get with the picture, friends, it's 2009.

I'll go right out there and say that I think it may be the best sandwiches in town, both in terms of quality and price. The amazing fact is that if the sandwiches were $8.95 a pop, i'd still be writing this review. However, they're not. A mere $5.50 get's you what a potbellies could only dream of offering. REAL fresh baked bread. Excellent meats. Delicious vegetables. Adventurous combinations. Phenomenal.  When I first walked in, I was amazed by the warm and relaxed atmosphere. Huge latino-inspired murals adorn the walls, almost in a Diego-Rivera style. I ordered the Oaxacan pork loin sandwich and a cup of the Soup 'o the day. The soup was most certainly homemade, the broth being nice and rich, but not too salty. I like when restaurant let's you salt your own soup. They also gave me a big chunk of bread with the soup and at that point, I was sold. The sandwich came on a really dense and crusty bread, similar to ciabatta. The juicy pork loin was seasoned with a magical combination. Seriously, I think the secret ingredient may have been magic. I could detect chili spices, cinnamon, chocolate, lime. It was absolutely amazing. For $5.50, it was unreal. As well, I shared a chocolate chip cookie, which was huge...being about two inches thick. It too, was excellent.

Maybe we caught them on a bad day; who knows...but I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt. Hopefully the next time I come back they will be much more pleasant. They're primarily known for their bread. Because of my innate and unwavering hatred for sandwiches (except the GC, of course) I opted to go a route whereby the main ingredient was not bread. But, I did order the hummus appetizer (which sadly came at the same time as my entree AND my salad) which came perfectly spread on some Panes bread and it was absolutely delightful: both the hummus and the bread. I also ordered the Mac n' Cheese and was in food heaven. Very tasty and one of my favorites yet since I've moved to Chicago. There was nothing extra special about it; no fancy cheeses or finely grated green apples to adorn the top; just good ol' mac n' cheese with cheddar and parmesan. Simple, not overly done, but yummy for the tummy! I will definitely be back. Thank you Panes for a wonderful food experience.

2007-01-24,4.0,"This is a great alternative to all of the large chain sandwich shops. The food is fresher, there is a great selection of entrees and more healthier options than say, Panera or something similar. I always order the quesadillas, which come with mashed potatoes. The are considered an appetizer but I can eat them as a meal. They make amazing desserts, such as chocolate clouds, which is low-fat chocolate mouse with cinnamon cookies. It is great. Another fantastic aspect is their wide array of diet beverages. I have diabetes and I am always looking out for places that sell more than diet coke. This place has a lot, fountain diet sprite as well as many other offerings in cans, namely fresca. My only complaints are that the fresh dressings seem a bit heavy and the cashier never ever smiles. Other than that I would recommend this place highly. Oh, bear in mind, they only accept cash and personal check. No debit cards.",0.9762,0.766,0.181,0.053,0.5934285714285714

We had the BBQ chicken sandwich & the sloppy pollo sandwich - essentially the same sandwich, just slightly different. The sandwiches were terrrrrriffic. The bread was warm, soft & chewy with a nice crust. The chicken was juicy, with nice bbq flavor. My sandwich also had sauteed red onions which added some nice flavor.

2006-11-18,4.0,"I have been to this place quite a few times now. Since I'm usually there during peak hours (lunch time) there is always somewhat of a wait, but nothing to the point where it's driven me to insanity. Plus, no matter how long the line or how busy it seems, by the time you order a table or two always seems to be free. And of course, you can always do carry-out. Never seen it really busy during dinner time.  Something that hasn't been mentioned yet is that they have a small breakfast menu on Sundays (until 2 or 3, I think). My bf had the french toast w/apples and he said it was ""damn good"" & I had a taste and agreed. I've stuck to sandwiches & salads, but have never been disappointed--- except for the fact that I was under the impression that they make their own salad dressings (as the Spartan salad came w/an obviously homemade Greek dressing) but once I got a salad that came with a packet of honey mustard. Go figure.  If you are calling in carry-out, I would you suggest you ask about what the specials of the day are. If in this little restaurant, these are written on a wipe-off board up high on the right wall if facing the counter--- it always lists a unique soup, salad, sandwich, and pasta dish not usually found on the menu.  Some of the deserts look tastier than they really are, but you can tell they are homemade and I can appreciate that. However, I find it hard to pass up a cream puff for less than a buck. :-) Lastly, the people are really nice. Once when we did carry-out and they messed up my bf's sandwich (he abhors mayonnaise). He called & explained & they apologized for their mistake, and even wrote down his name so he could come in and get a free sandwich on his next visit.",0.6179,0.827,0.094,0.079,0.45146678424456205

2006-05-26,4.0,"Panes is a great little bread place off the Brownline Wellington stop.  It is really close to where I live and even though there are some things that bother me about it, the more I go the more I like it.  I think the quality of service and product increases exponentially with the more buzz/traffic it gets.   Things that annoy me:  Panes only takes cash and this can be a real buzzkill on a hung over morning when you want a sammy but your pockets are empty from the night before.  Also, it tends to be VERY crowded on the weekend. Ugh, I feel trapped inside one big yuppie-fest.  Yikes!  I don't really like eating ""in"" here unless I am able to sit near a window. For food, I tried the BBQ pulled sandwich and was not impressed (too blah).  The salad I tried was bland and boring (but looking at other diners' salads recently, they look better so I may have to try again). Now the good: My favorite here is the BLT sans mayo.  The BLT is SOOOO good (and worth all the stars).  Honestly, the BLT is one of the best I have ever had.  Seems weird I would find my salty pork love at a bread cafe, but you never know!  The vegetable sandwiches and goat cheese sandwiches are also pretty good.  The bread is fabulous.  Try the tomato bread - no need to add anything to it!   All in all, Panes has won me over - especially when I'm achin' for some bacon.",0.9914,0.708,0.205,0.087,0.5745098039215687
