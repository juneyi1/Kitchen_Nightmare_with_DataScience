2017-08-15,5.0,"So glad this restaurant is literally across the street from me. It's my go to whenever I'm  craving Thai food and it has not disappointed so far in the two years I've been here.  I've tried multiple curries (Penang, green, red) and my favorite is the green curry. I like how they include eggplant and bamboo shoots. The tom yum and tom kha soup is also very good- a little on the sweeter side. Pad Thai and pad kee mao are both solid choices as well. We tried the pineapple fried rice too but it's a little mushy for our tastes.  Just a warning - if you can't handle spicy food, always be safe and go for the mild. I love spicy food but sometimes even their medium is too much for me, especially with the soups.  I'm not usually home during lunch, but they have a very good deal for lunch, regardless of if you dine in or carry out. It's $8-9 for an entree, soup and appetizer. Good portions - was pretty full just from the soup and appetizer.",0.9828,0.809,0.175,0.016,0.5549999999999999

I highly recommend ordering like that (you can try more things too!)   I feel like this is a place that people don't typically sit down in so the space reflects that.

2017-05-22,5.0,"This spot was pleasantly surprising! Good food, nice prices, BYOB, and great service! We ordered the following to share between 3 peeps: -Larb Gai ~ essentially ground chicken cooked with chili, lime, and spices. Light, flavorful, and fresh! -Appetizer sampler platter ~ a couple rolls of lumpia (WHOOP WHOOP), shrimp egg rolls, and some crab or lobster stuffed with cream cheese puff things. All good!  -Pad see ewe with beef ~ solid dish. I would say I'm basically a Pad See Ewe connoisseur at this point. You can't go wrong with this one if you're looking for a noodle dish here. -Seaweed salad ~ mix of shredded seaweed and pickled cucumbers. Nice light dish to start the meal. -A spicy chicken fried rice ~ generous portion. White rice stir fried with chicken, peppers, onions, and spices. Medium was definitely closer to hot, so beware! Anyways, the lumpia definitely caught me off guard, but at the same time the husky lil Filipino boy in me was jumping up and down with excitement. Who knew a Thai spot could bang out a Filipino staple. Overall it was a great & affordable meal. Not to mention the 10% Yelp Cash back deal. Whoop whoop! That's all I got on this one.

2017-04-20,5.0,"I used to go to a place in Chinatown to fulfill my pad thai cravings. However the place closed down, leaving me in search of a good restaurant to get some Thai food at. After a couple failures, I finally found this gem. Their restaurant is a spacious place located in Lakeview right off the 151/156 bus lines. The place is usually pretty empty (I go for the lunch specials around 2 PM) and service is friendly and quick. Onto the food: They offer a lunch special between 11am to 3pm , I believe. You get a small appetizer, soup and entree for only $8 (dine in)!  Appetizers with lunch meal: These apps with the lunch deal are a pretty small size, usually only coming with 2 pieces or so. Vegetable egg roll 2.5/5: I usually get this because how can you go wrong with a nice crispy egg roll. They usually are pretty good, however the last time i got it the inside was pretty mushy which was kind of off-putting. However , it's just a decent standard egg roll with a sweet dipping sauce. Chicken Lumpia 2/5: Was essentially meat and the wrapper. Not horrible but I much prefer the egg roll over this. Comes with a sweet dipping sauce which is nice, but needs something to cut all the meat and wrap. Crab Rangoon 3/5: these were also pretty standard, crispy wrapper with a creamy filling. I've definitely have had better ones elsewhere, however It was alright. Cucumber salad 3.5/5: this is probably my favorite appetizer on the lunch special. It's fresh and refreshing (especially before eating a bunch of pad thai). Comes coated in a sweet dressing which I always love and mixed with a couple other veggies such as carrots. Soup: Tom Yum Soup 4.5/5: Oh goodness do I love tom yum soup. It's so flavorful and delicious I always find myself getting this when I get thai food. Here the soup is no exception. The broth is really flavorful and you can choose your protein. Personally I don't care for any protein in the soup, so I ask for extra veggies instead. Just a warning, If you ask for it to be spicy it will be HOT. Usually places that say hot are pretty meh, but this place really does give it a kick. Entree: Chicken Pad Thai 4/5: The pad thai here is flavorful and really quite delicious. They give a pretty decent size with the meal also so you won't ever leave hungry :D. Just a note, the pad thai here is a little more oily./heavier than other places I've eaten at, so if you don't like heavier foods I wouldn't recommend it. However I personally enjoy it, and am never left unsatisfied. Overall the lunch deal here is a really great price that you can't beat. The service is fast and friendly, and food is great. The only irk I have is that they charge extra if you ask for a couple more pieces of lime with your food, which isn't too bad considering that it's cheap.",0.9985,0.743,0.211,0.046,0.5952484023912596

I didn't need the seafood, as it turned out, the soup and veggies were spicy and delicious, hearty enough. She had beef and asparagus. That was so flavorful, and the asparagus was crunchy.

Miss Asia could have received 3 stars from me because the Pad Thai was actually pretty good and the delivery came quick, however I can only fairly give two stars due to the subpar food and the disrespectful delivery driver.  As mentioned, the Pad Thai was good. The sampler appetizer plate was just okay, the crab rangoon and lumpia rolls were cold and a bit soggy. The chicken teriyaki was my least favorite dish. The presentation was unappetizing first off. It was cut up flavorless grilled chicken breast sitting in a pool of very watery teriyaki sauce. The chicken did not hold the sauce at all. The dish was also supposed to come with a side of veggies but it came with 3 pieces of broccoli and a random piece of iceberg lettuce, which I think was supposed to be some type of decoration but it was gross and drenched in watery teriyaki sauce.  My biggest disappointment was that the delivery driver crumpled up our online order print out( we used the EAT24 service and it was the print out correspondence between them and Miss Asia). The order receipt had all our personal information ( full name, phone number, special entry instrucions, address, and order, and he threw it into our landlords window flower box, who lives on the first floor of my house.

The waitress responded with, ""We actually close the kitchen at 10:45 PM."" With 17 years of restaurant and bar experience while growing up, I completely understand that people want to go home after a restaurant is closed. However, this is a Thai restaurant, most Thai restaurants only take 10 to 15 minutes to prepare the food.

Its not bad but its not the best Thai food I've had. It does hit the spot if you're craving Thai though. The restaurant itself is really empty because most people order pick up and that's the majority of their business. The in-restaurant dining was still pretty timely nonetheless. My only complaint is that the portions werent large enough so I left wanting more food. If you live close by, I would recommend this place as the convenient neighborhood spot for Thai food. I wouldn't make the trip out here to try it though. However, the lunch special is a great deal because you get an appetizer and an entree for around $7.",0.9532,0.765,0.157,0.078,0.5288359788359789

Recently went out for late night dinner with my BFF and we ordered some things we normally don't. I ordered the sweet chili tilapia and I also wanted to review the pad thai. On the menu it says the tilapia is a filet but once it was on the table it was pieces of filet and what I had originally imagined this dish would be like was all wrong. It was swimming in the sauce and I was really confused because the menu stated it was a filet piece anyways so I tried it and it was horrible. There was no meat at all and the sauce was just way too much. It was overflowing onto the table whenever I moved the plate lightly . So hopefully miss asia reads this and can come to a better way to cook the sweet chili tilapia. In addition to the meatless fish, it was also very dry ironically ;( weird right? And as much as I love the pad thai, there's too much sauce too. My bro in law owns a thai restaurant in CA that I used to work at so I kinda have an idea how certain foods should look like and also too I've eaten at plenty thai restaurants and friends home and never have I Seen the sweet chili tilapia cooked so wrong .

2014-05-19,2.0,I am so disappointed about ordering from Miss Asia tonight.  I used to live upstairs above the restaurant and order from them at least once a week.  I was very sad when I moved out of town and had a hard time finding a Thai place that had as good green curry as them.  So as you can imagine when I moved back in town I was so excited to share my favorite Thai place with my friends on movie night.  I placed the order on their website and never received any sort of notification that my order had been recieved so after 35 minutes I called to ask if it was being prepared.  My phone call was answered by a woman who seemed very agitated to be taking to me and made sure to inform me that they were extremely busy and that it would be another 30 minutes at least until it was to be delivered.  After another 35 minutes went by I called again to see if they were on the way.  The same woman answered the phone even more agitated and acted as if I was bothering her and that I just needed to be patient and it would be there shortly because they had 7 other orders that needed to be delivered before I would receive my food.  After I recurved my food I realized that it wasn't delivered the same way that it is normally prepared.  After that I called again to let them know that I think that I was missing something from my order.  I was then asked if I knew what it was that was missing to which I responded that yes I do that my entree wasn't served the way that I was used to the portion size was much smaller than they usually serve..  She then responded that there wasn't any left over green curry and that it was just to bad and there was nothing that she could do.  She then raised her voice at me and told Mr that I was being rude and that she was much too busy to speak with me.  I then asked if I could speak with the owner to which she said yes and proceeded to walk into a back room where I heard her telling people that I wanted to complain and then I heard laughing for about 5 minutes and then she returned and said that the owner wasn't available.  I then tried to speak and she city me off and raised her voice and told me that actually she had spoke to him on the phone and that there was nothing that he would do differently for me. I then asked to speak to a manager and she that there wasn't one but actually she was basically the manager.  When I asked for her name she responded very curtly that it wasn't necessary for me to know her name and proceeded to hang up on me.  I am so incredibly disappointed in the service that I can not give higher than 2 stars.  The food was fantastic as always except for the fact that there wasn't enough green curry.,-0.1866,0.9,0.049,0.052,0.42493540051679585

We ordered the Tom Yum(and it was that),Tom Khai(I hope I spelled it right), chicken satay, as well as the Pad woon sen (one with chicken and one with beef) I was a little adventurous and added medium spice to my Tom Yum...trust I won't be that adventurous again not because it wasn't good but because it was so good and so flavorful that the soup was dancing on my tongue like a cool dance of great food and freshness, but as I got closer to the bottom of my bowl I was sweating from the heat of the soup but in a good way. The chicken satay with the peanut sauce and cucumber salad was so amazing and I have had this dish at many places and this has become my favorite...why do you ask well first the pieces of chicken were a nice size as well as juicy and flavorful. My girlfriend ate the rest of the peanut sauce even after we ate all the chicken satay. I was thinking the samething but she beat me to it...lol  I wanted to order more cucumber salad but with all the food we had I knew I was being greedy. I will just have to wait till next time. The main dish Pad Woon Sen wth the glass noodles was unbelievably good and again I felt adventurous and added the medium heat I'm so glad I was able to switch with my girlfriend because I wouldn't have been able to enjoy the dish as much as I did without all the heat.  She had the beef and I'm so glad she was willing to take the chicken. I also have to say in every dish we had everything tasted and look so fresh.  My snap peas popped, my red onions crunched, my mushrooms were savory and not from a can and our sauces were delightful and tasty.  My only warning to you is if you can't stand the heat stick with the mild.  I learned my lesson the hard way!!! I can't wait to go back thanks for the great experience! Now the customer service was excellent the waitress continued to check on us but not in away that was annoying.  What I also like  is the fact that she kept my water glass full even with her other customers. Although it was a slight language barrier our waitress still answered our questions and if she didn't understand she told us right away and didn't make us feel dumb with things on the menu like mock duck that we were unsure of while we were there. I can't wait to go back and explore more things on there menu like the sampler, green curry and crying tiger.

Miss Asia was often a go-to because it is almost literally around the corner.  I never got delivery from here, because it seemed dumb to have them deliver around the block, but I've gotten takeout numerous times. I've eaten in probably 2-3 times. I'm a sucker for easy Americanized Thai-ish Asian food, and Miss Asia creates such food pretty much in the middle of the pack. I really like the curry noodles, the pad Thai is decent, and my roommate at the time was religiously addicted to the teriyaki chicken. Don't go here expecting fireworks, but if you are hungry and you don't want to cook, Miss Asia will fill your belly.  I am generally unimpressed by Thai food in Chicago, but places like Miss Asia are sort of in a different category for me.

Meanwhile we were waiting patiently for water, napkins and chopsticks. I finally started waving my hands to get their attention. I could go on and on but I will stop here. It's too depressing. So at the end I was assisted by a very rude young waitress who told us that we couldn't take our left overs home with us because we had a Groupon???  An Asian gentleman who didn't speak very good English came over to our table and asked us if everything ok. We told him No, the service was bad and so were the noodles we ordered.

Came over in 10 minutes and food was waiting ready for us. Two lunch specials $7.95 and Pot Stickers $5.95 or so. Pad See Ewe was VERY delicious. I know not every restaurant can keep the exact flavor each time it's made, but if anyone who ate the Pad See Ewe I ate and reviewed it negatively, then they haven't tried the 1000 other Thai places in Lakeview which in all honesty don't even hold a match to this dish. Flavor profile was perfect. Also wow on the sizing when I also get a soup and an egg roll for the price. Pot stickers were fine/good. The sauce makes it for me, and I enjoyed the sauce and they were warm. Tom Yum Soup was really good. Piping hot, spicy, and had a very clean natural flavor profile. Sometimes when you order from worse Thai restaurants, there can be an odd flavoring in some of the soups. This was great. Egg Roll was weakest point, but even then the flavoring was pretty good.

I've eaten sober at some of my usual late night  drunken stupor joints, and they have been all pretty sub-par.  Anywho, I was definitely surprised at the outcome. Saturday night, around 7:30ish, we walked in and were the only customers in house. Sketchy, I know. I wanted the pork lumpia, my lady the crab rangoon. We glanced at each other, and just new: COMBO APP. This came with both said items, in addition to fried skrimps. All of them were pretty good then, as well as a late night snack.  Main dishes were tasty too. Bangkok chicken was crispy chicken pieces tossed in a tasty medium spicy sauce. I enjoyed the hell out of this dish. Next was the shrimp and asparagus, which was in a lighter sauce that was pretty good as well. The black mushrooms were few, so if you are into shrooms, ask for extra.  Portions were decent.

2011-07-16,1.0,"This is the worst place ever!  My dining experience was so poor, I had to write my own review , even though my husband wrote one too.  First off, I think something was wrong with my dish as I've had stomach and bathroom issues all morning.  I asked others who dinning with us and they too were not feeling good either. As my husband mention we made reservations for 6 at 6:45.  As we walked in we wait a good 6-8 minutes before anyone from the restaurant appeared.  Once someone came over to greet us, she was confused about us making a reservation or even getting our last name correct which is only 3 letters long.  Then we had another 5 minute wait before they even sat us even though there was maybe 3 other tables occupied. We ordered appetizers which took over an hour to arrive.  I think at the hour mark we inquired about what happened to them and was at least 20 min later before the showed up.  To their benefit I think it only took them 30 more minutes to bring out our dinner. They never came by to refill our water or check on the meal.  I had to get up and go to the counter and ask for our waters to be refilled several times.  It also took 4 attempts of me going over and asking for our bill to come.  There was also mass confusion for them to pay part of the bill on credit card.  After we got that straight we asked them how much was left to pay in cash (because the took the bill and wouldn't let us keep it to figure out the difference) and they told us $20 ish.  We then said, no how much, give us the bill and we will figure it out (which was only $16). I can not think of a positive thing to say, worst service, food was ok and then 2 of us got sick.  There are so many other good restaurants out there, skip this place and try somewhere else.  It will save you a lot of time and frustration.",-0.9771,0.846,0.04,0.114,0.5397447380206001
2011-07-15,1.0,"Just returned from Miss Asia and all I can say is wow, this was one of my worst dining experiences in Chicago (and I eat out quite a lot)! I was with my wife and four friends and the service was so painstakingly slow we all thought we had to be on an episode of Candid Camera or Punk'd. But at the end of the two hour meal (which included just two courses) no hidden cameras materialized.  This dinner at Miss Asia will probably be an inside joke among us for the next few years and anytime in the future we receive slow service it will be compared to Miss Asia. We are all distance runners and as we left one of my friends summed up the experience by saying we could have ordered our food, gone and run a half marathon, and finished running just in time for the food to arrive.  When we first walked in the restaurant had a bit of an odd appearance to it, and the decor just did not seem to work. For some reason it took several minutes to seat our party even though we had reservations and the place was at most 30% full. The waitstaff had a heavy accent and were not easy to understand and did not seem to understand us so well either. The menu was rather expansive which has pros and cons (nice to have so much to choose from, but usually when I place tries to do too much, the quality of the food rarely aspires beyond mediocre). One positive was the BYOB policy and the prices were fairly inexpensive.  We ordered a couple of appetizers and I ordered Tom Yum soup. For some unknown reason it took nearly an hour for the appetizers to come out (and again it was not busy). The food was OK, but nothing special. The chicken in the soup was totally bland. I needed to drop several ice cubes in the soup to make it an edible temperature. The main courses likewise were alright, but nothing special. Definitely plenty of better Asian restaurants nearby with much better food for about the same price.  In addition to taking nearly an hour for a couple of appetizers to come out the waitstaff was absent for extended periods of time. The food was very spicy (despite my request for only medium spice) so I drained my first glass of water. I kept looking for a waiter to get more water, but this was to no avail. My wife spied a pitcher of water on a nearby counter, so she got up and retrieved the water for me. I guess the place is not just BYOB, but BYOW too; if I am ever forced to come back here I will definitely bring a few bottled waters. I also recommend bringing some napkins with you as well as these seemed to be hard to come by as well.  Obtaining the bill was a fiasco too. We had to ask four times for them to bring us the bill. This was the first time in years I was so upset with the service that I was planning on not leaving a tip, but of course they had automatically added a surcharge. My wife was all fired up and was going to complain, but then we noticed the bill was completely inaccurate (fortunately in our favor) with a few items left out. The amount left off wound up being a bit more than the surcharge, so we decided we would call it even and just pay the bill and get out of there. Of course it took another 20 minutes for them to take our credit cards (we split it between three different credit cards and they acted totally baffled by this as though it had never been done before) - two different servers approached multiple times each after we handed over the credit cards to keep asking for clarification on how we were paying. It was like something from the Twilight Zone. I had been holding off giving a one star review on Yelp until I found a place that was truly deserving. While, this one was a no brainer. I know from reading other reviews of this place that usually people have a decent experience here, so maybe this was just an off night, but the experience was so bad that even were I to be offered a free meal I would turn it down. Quick Update: I have now completed 100 Yelp reviews; Miss Asia is my ONLY one star review - that should say something .",0.792,0.837,0.084,0.079,0.4524611191277859

To elaborate, here's a fun story for you: I placed an order on GrubHub and left special instructions, telling the delivery driver to call me when he arrived because the buzzer isn't hooked up to my mobile. I get a call at 15 mins past the estimated delivery time with the driver telling me that he buzzed me and nobody answered. I told him about the special instructions, and he said ""oh"".

People, please, please, please, don't buy into a restaurant that claims to sell and specialize everything under the sun in asia.  Per Anthony Bourdain in a recent Top Chef episode (note, i'm paraphrasing here): It's hard to specialize in Asian cuisine, Asia is enormous.  Anyway, you get my drift. With a menu that's as big as a dictionary, it's hard to even delineate what their specials or specialties are.  Needless to say, this place is always empty, which makes me question how fresh their squid, beef, duck, chicken are.   The dishes we got (very simple ones) were pho and fried rice.  Pho was tasteless and awful, and the fried rice??! How can you mess up fried rice? It was oily & greasy, and had no taste.  I do love greasy food, but the whole point of eating greasy food is for the taste!  Needless to say, I will NOT be back here.. the decor is cheesy and lame, the waitresses don't know how to speak english, and the food sucks! I wish I could give it -5 points.",-0.5213,0.837,0.073,0.09,0.5379399585921326
2008-05-31,3.0,"Service here was...interesting. The kind of service you gripe about if you're having a bad day and laugh at if your day is alright.  My food (wonton soup and pad see yew) was tasty. The person I was eating with ordered an indonesian dish. When my food came out we were told the Indonesian chef was not there and the other chef couldn't make that dish. So he reordered and got... something else. Whatever he got was tasty, we just have no idea what it was as he ordered something with beef and the dish that appeared was clearly chicken.  That said, the menu is very diverse and includes all asia foods (Indian, Indonesian, Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Cambodian, You name it). Apparently these offerings are dependent upon the appropriate chef being there... Hopefully the quirky service was just a function of being new.",0.6486,0.889,0.073,0.038,0.46635101010101015
2008-05-27,3.0,"This is a pretty cute little restaurant and the interior is cozy and bright and the staff very friendly and welcoming.  That being said I do think they might be stretching themselves a little thin with offering so many different kinds of cuisines. Each item we ordered was either a hit or a miss. Appetizers were a hit, both entrees we ordered were a definite miss and the dessert was definitely a hit.  The misses were the Indonesian beef dish. It was basically just 4 HUGE cubes of meat...almost tasted like a barbacoa. It was supposed to come with curry rice but that was unfortunately missing from the plate. My Mongolian Beef...well as soon as they set the plate down I knew it was going to be a tragedy. Beef shouldn't be gray after all. Needless to say the meat was tough as a piece of shoe leather.  The hits were my duck soup...omg I swear it had crack in it! The Filipino eggrolls were really tasty and the Thai custard...again...probably laced with crack. One bite and I wanted to yell back to the kitchen to bring out 30 more orders to go...luckily for my waistline I held back.  In the end the duck soup and the Thai custard will definitely have me coming back to give Miss Asia a second chance.",-0.1772,0.808,0.1,0.092,0.5175925925925927
2008-05-25,5.0,"After seeing the article about Miss Asia saying ""This Miss is a No Miss"", we knew we had to round up a group of friends to check out this hot little addition to the Diversey and Pine Grove corner.  Because there are SO many Thai and Asian restaurants in the area I was banking on this place having something to set it apart from the rest.   We found ourselves there with 3 bottles of wine (BYOB!!) and a packed house at about 8:30PM.  Thank goodness we made a reservation because a group of people came in about 5 minutes after us and ended up having to leave.   The restaurant was loud, the colors were very bold on the interior, and the ceilings were freakishly low - at 5'9 I could actually touch the ceiling in some parts of the restaurant.  The facilities were nice and everything was sort of trendy but not over the top. When we got the menu, it was a little intense.  I would guesstimate 8 pages full of menu items in little itsy bitsy font, equaling out to about 200 different options.  Good for people who are looking for a little variety; bad for people like me who get overwhelmed with having more than 10 options to choose from.  They actually have dishes from a whole bunch of different Asian countries, making it nearly impossible for people not to find anything they would enjoy.  After weighing out all my options, I was able to decide on the Rama Chicken with some pot stickers to start. I have to say, I am impressed.  Food came out in a timely manner, the portions were just the right size, and the waitstaff was friendly and attentive.   The best part:  on top of all that, the bill for 6 people came to $62.  $62!!!!!!!  I don't know where else in Chicago 6 people can dine-in with appetizers and dinner for that type of cost.  You could probably spend more at Panera or Taco Bell quite honestly.   The BYOB aspect is clutch, and I do not believe there is a corkage fee, or at least we were not charged for one. I highly recommend stopping in here for some great meal and a happy checkbook.",0.9931,0.804,0.149,0.047,0.5886353077816491
2008-05-09,4.0,"Awesome menu and a chic atmosphere made for a great dining experience at Miss Asia! I don't know of any other restaurants where you can sample cuisine from 15 different countries - it's a little bit overwhelming at first because everything sounded really tasty. My friend and I decided to stick with Thai dishes because that's clearly the restaurant's specialty, but next time I think I'm going for Cambodian or Nepalese! Anyway, we ordered Pad See Eiw and Pad Num Prik Pao (chili-based sauce, but not spicy IMO) and enjoyed both of the dishes. I've eaten Pad See Eiw a million times in my life and thought this was one of the best (in recent memory)! Definitely a good spot for a date, and reasonable prices. Two entrees, a pop and a Thai iced coffee came out to only $25 including tax and tip. Also it's BYOB and there's a liquor store nearby. (Don't know how much the corkage fee is). I'm not sure how well these dishes would hold up for carryout, so I'd definitely recommend dining in. The waitstaff was very nice and attentive, the food looked as good as it tasted, and the restaurant itself has a sort of laid-back, cool modern vibe.

The space is very pleasant and comfortable.  The staff was very good.  Our waitress was very helpful with the menu and it was a pleasure chatting with her.",0.9865,0.722,0.253,0.025,0.6655128205128206

My only complaint is the lack of authentic ingredients.  They use as close of substitutes as possible - and is reflected in the relatively cheap prices. However, i wish they would use authentic ingredients (i know they are available in chicago).",0.9807,0.782,0.191,0.027,0.7398245614035087
2008-04-10,4.0,"Again, I am writing a review of a restaurant solely based on delivery of Vietnamese spring rolls and stir-fried vegetables, garlic sauce on the side. I like the rolls, they are heavier on the green stuff (lettuce, herbs), than most rolls I have ordered in this area. I asked for them without pork and they arrived at my door without pork. The lady that took my order kindly asked if I would like shrimp, I said ""yes"". The shrimp was fresh tasting and not fishy smelling. The sauce is of the hoison based variety (I think...it looks like hoison at least...its not plum, or peanut). If you like a lot of sauce ask for extra, the one they include only lasted me through 2/3 of the order. Also, the rolls are not the tightest in the city, but i think the room for air may work for this roll. Allows the flavors to mingle properly. They have a great variety of vegetables (including baby corn)! And they cooked them perfectly, not too soggy. The garlic sauce was a little watery but that's okay. They also included a little hot sauce, two packs of soy sauce, a paper napkin and plastic fork. No fortune cookie. Delivery was very fast. It seems like a nice place overall, they offer a smattering of asian foods from various locales. Of course the question comes to mind, is Miss Asia spreading herself too thinly? I'm thinking probably....but its okay because I got what I wanted when I wanted it. Also this is a good place to go if someone wants Korean and someone wants Indian, although the selection is limited.",0.9833,0.841,0.134,0.025,0.5030357142857141
2008-04-09,5.0,"I'm at a loss for adjectives on this one, albeit I only ate there once.  This is not a cheap quick fast-type Asian food gig.  They have chefs and prepare the food carefully and articulately.   In my first carryout experience with Miss Asia I was able to eat Thai, Vietnamese, and Lao food - and topped it off with a bananna leaf desert!  I was pleasantly surprised to find they not only served *real* coconut juice, but they give you the freakin' coconut to drink it out of!  This new family owned and operated (the family is Vietnamese... I know this because they introduced themselves and are very friendly and personable) restaurant will be around for a long long time!   Although I haven't been in the Chi for a long time, this is the best Asian food place I've been too.  Great job!",0.9689,0.832,0.148,0.02,0.5396043771043773

2008-03-23,4.0,"What a surprisingly pleasant little restaurant! It really is. I walked in expecting a run of the mill asian restaurant (and really didn't know what to expect from the menu since I hadn't peeked it yet and the name lends it's name to any number of possibilities.) What I, on a whim, stumbled upon was a tasty little Asian spot with a really nice atmosphere and friendly service. The menu is huge. I'm not exaggerating. The reason the name is so ambiguous is because this is not a Thai or Chinese or Filipino restaurant, it is all of them and more. Admittedly their Thai menu is by far the largest but there are many choices of cuisine from any number of other Asian countries. I ordered Thai Fried Rice. No, not very original, but it is a guilty pleasure and I haven't had it in a while. It was quite good. I also tasted my boyfriend's dish, although I couldn't tell you for the life of me what it was called, and it was also tasty.  The two girls who helped us were both very friendly. They checked in on us frequently and made sure our water was filled. On our way out a man who I assume was the manager asked us how everything was, wished us a good day, and seemed genuine about it all. For dessert I had mochi ice cream. I would not order it again. It was pricey for the size, and the gum on the outside was not as solid as it should have been. If you are in the area, are hungry, and don't know what to do I would recommend a visit. You may have trouble deciding which country on the menu to visit, but at least you will have skipped the ""which restaurant to visit"" question.",0.9654,0.835,0.119,0.046,0.4795682287061597
