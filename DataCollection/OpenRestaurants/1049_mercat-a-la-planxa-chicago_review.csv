The dining room is beautiful and a good vibe. I ordered the Mercat G&T, verde salad, and xoco fritos. The drink comes. The gin is good, but the flavors in the mixer were a bit bland. I sip away and it is 50 minutes later until the salad arrives. A leaf with a large brown spot sits on top. I quickly move it. Overall, good flavor and love the spicy combo with cucumbers to balance. The xoco fritos arrive as I'm working on the salad. The description led me to think it'll have rice, but it looked like they fried it with rice in the batter. Pretty solid.  The wait was pretty long. I was thinking of doing a fixed meal, but glad I didn't. The couple next to me did and they had some long waits followed by a lot of plates at once. For me, the G&T became diluted and I finished it without a check in. A manager or someone came to apologize for the delay as I was finishing, but that appeared too late.  I asked for the check. It came and sat with my credit card for 15 minutes. I even moved it to make the credit card more visible. The waiter also checked with the table next to me during that time. A server even put dessert hardware on the table, even though I didn't order anything and a check and payment sat on the corner.

2017-06-15,4.0,"Mercat a la Planxa is definitely an interesting restaurant. Came here on a Thursday for lunch (6/8/17) not knowing what to expect. A vendor suggested we try this place, and I was along for the ride.  The menu is somewhat small, yet slightly difficult to decipher. We asked our server for a brief rundown, which was super helpful. After some indecision, I decided on the ravioli d'anyell (lamb ravioli), priced at $17. This place is a little pricey. The atmosphere is great. I really enjoyed the open space. The decor was on point. Exactly what you would expect from a restaurant with the name that it has. No complaints about the ambiance. I'm not sure what the first floor is all about, but we sat on the second. Service was slow at times, but friendly.  I thought the food here was really good! I loved my ravioli. Everything was on point. The serving sizes were not very substantial, however. For the price, I was expecting a little more, but I've definitely been to worse. Bring some extra cash if you come here hungry.  While the food is great, I'm not sure a simple entree will fill you. That being said, I think this restaurant is more of a small plates/tapas kind of a place where you share. Now that I think about it, I guess we went about it all wrong!

We came to Mercat dying for some Spanish food and I was blown away.  Things we ordered: Blanco Sangria, Patatas Bravas, Gambas Al Ajillo, Tortilla Espanola, Ravioli d'Anyell, and Churros for dessert.  Most of these things are typical orders for me when I have tapas, but I was blown away. The Patatas Bravas was served in a way that I had never expected (almost tater tot shaped) and were deliciously smoky. The Gambas were slightly spicy but perfectly cooked; the Tortilla Espanola had the MOST DELICIOUS saffron aioli I wanted to lick the plate. And maybe you're like, ""Ravioli?"". I know. Don't overthink it. It's fantastic. Like actually top two things I ordered.  The sangria is bomb - sometimes it's made with too much fruit and it get bitter and weird but this was perfectly sweet and citrusy.  If I'm honest, I almost gave 4 stars because the Churros are v salty (I didn't read the menu stating that there is manchego cheese in them). I have never met a Churro I didn't wanna marry - and at a Spanish restaurant no less.  But fear not: our server was phenomenal. Quickly recommended this peach dessert (don't remember the name) that was astounding and so flavorful with crispy phyllo pastry and perfect peach sorbet.

2017-06-11,3.0,"Rough go at the place in terms of getting food and value proposition.  I ordered the boquerones, an anchovy dish which I have had at places before so I know that I like the dish. The execution here was very different, being the orange slices served with it and the green olives. One wouldn't think green olives with an already salty fish & oranges together. It actually worked. I did wish there was some sort of starch with it, though - it needed it. At the same time I ordered the boquerones, I ordered one of the pulpo dishes (which is octupus). It took about an hour. And it was a very tiny piece of tentacle. They clearly had an issue, at the expense of my time, but the bartender serving me did remove it from the bill so that was fair/nice. Even though the cost is about $30 (not including tax, tip, drinks) for those very small dishes, I had to order more. Those tiny bites of food weren't close to being enough for dinner. I don't have a problem spending money on food... but come on!   Next I went with the ravioli, it had oxtail, fresh peas and a light sauce. It seems like there were bonito flakes on it, and ended up tasting more like a tuna past dish. Weird though because it was oxtail. It wasn't bad but seemed misrepresented and need more seasoning. The fresh peace were really good.  I even went with a dessert, which I don't often do, but since I did not really get very full. Olive oil cake sounded great. I ate about half and that was all I could do. It wasn't very good. The cake was dense, cold, almost gritty. The accessories to the cake overdid it on the citrus. What is with this chef/restaurant and oranges?? There was orange marmalade in between the cake, a dried orange in top, citrusy orange sorbet on top of the cake (should probably go on the side) and a sweet caramel sauce. They should've probably taken it off, too but since the pulpo fiasco, I didn't expect any more.  Overall, the bartenders were great (I ate at the bar). Food was good, kitchen needs to improve timing, and again the value proposition is way off.

My husband is a huge fan of tapas, so this was our obvious choice when we were looking for good food before the C2E2 convention (in 2015). From the get-go, the decoration and ambiance is cosmopolitan and cool, the house music mix was banging throughout the evening, and this is important to me, so I was happy.  We were, as always, on a budget, so we began with the classic tortilla española, which for such a relatively simple dish, the flavor combination was fantastic. Then we had the morcilla and oh man, it was delightful. My husband had never had morcilla before and was apprehensive but after this he was hooked. We nibbled on beautifully cooked camarones al ajillo but unfortunately decided on ending with the octopus, which was not bad except for the fact that the sauce was olive-based and we hate olives. So skip that if you dislike olives.  Great service, fabulous ambiance, great tapas. - or at least it was in 2015. A must if you are in Chicago!",0.9798,0.766,0.182,0.052,0.7070238095238095

The 1st course included mussels which were simply okay; tuna that lacked seasoning; and octopus that was again okay.  Three types of  olives were served and they were delicious.  The 2nd course included charcuterie, cheeses and fruit, and bacon wrapped dates.  The meat (all pork)  included in the charcuterie lacked flavor and seasoning. Now the bacon wrapped dates were fabulous!  Shockingly the salty, sweet and savory worked extremely well.  For the 3rd course we were served grilled prawns, roasted pork shoulder, and two sides of asparagus.  The roasted pork shoulder was mighty tasty, the asparagus was nothing to write home about and the prawns you guessed it not seasoned.  What happened to the steak that was promised and why two sides of asparagus. We splurged and spent $85 per person for under seasoned seafood, multiple lack luster pork options, cheese, fruit and asparagus.  The best dishes were the bacon wrapped dates and the pork shoulder.  Even with the cheese and fruit, the meal wasn't worth anywhere near $85 per person.  I would give one star if not for the bacon wrapped dates.",0.9748,0.859,0.109,0.032,0.43866666666666676

Maybe it's because it's kinda tucked away in this hotel, and it's not really something you can easily happen upon. It's also on the southern end of Michigan, so maybe that's why. Who knows!

Scallops - Absolutely delicious and also beautifully presented! 5. Lamb - My favorite item on the menu!!! The lamb is really tasty! 6. Shishito Peppers - These are a nice side dish. I always love ordering these at tapas places. The sangria is also really good here. It doesn't taste like you're just drinking sweet wine with fruit in it. It light, but still packs a punch.

Our fault -- we should've looked more closely at the price, but regardless, $44 is steep for what is essentially watered down wine w/ some fruit thrown in it. This coming from a Spaniard, Sangria is not the luxury cocktail it's become in the States. Sangria in Spain is made with run of the mill wine and is a cheap option. Sangria aside, tapas were scanty, tasty, but overpriced for what you get. We found ourselves eating hot dogs later than night after catching a show downtown because the meal at Mercat was far from satisfying (and we shared 5 tapas dishes -- and we're not heavy eaters). I've been to Mercat a handful times -- this will be the last. No complementary bread to soak up the juices either (they charge you for it) -- couldn't be farther from an authentic Spanish experience.

2017-01-01,4.0,"I stopped by here after work one day in the mood to try something a little a little different. I've had tapas before, but I hadn't had them in a while so it was time for a refresher. Just as a tip, when you walk into the place you have to go up the stairs to get to the actual restaurant. The lower level is basically all drinks.  So anyways I get upstairs and I'm seated right away. Everyone seems really friendly and generally pleasant. It is a tad dark in the restaurant, but not to the point to where you'll be tripping over yourself haha. So we're seated and they almost immediately bring out complimentary drinks and an appetizer (my kind of service!). Having already had experience with tapas I kind of knew the drill, but if you've never had tapas before the menu cam seem kind of overwhelming. The good news though is that there are several ""chef tasting"" options that allow you to try several popular dishes at a set price. The waiters are also pretty flexible, so if theres something in the menu that you don't like, just tell them and they'll probably swap it for something else! The waiters are also super helpful and will give their opinions of what they think you may like!  I ended up getting the smaller chef's tasting which featured 8 of their popular tapas! I feel like the waiters we're watching us because all of the plates seemed to come out with perfect timing. Literally one plate would be taken and the next one would come out right behind it. Another thing I appreciated is that the waiters didn't make us feel rushed and consistently asked how we were doing and if we needed anything. Fast forward to the end of the night and dessert! Although I'm not a fan of chocolate I must say that all of the desserts were good and not too overwhelming. I didn't feel as though I was stuffed and forcing myself to finish which was definitely a plus.

My coworker and I started at the bar. The cocktail menu could be a bit more inventive as most people will order what's on the suggested cocktail menu. I recall perhaps 4-5 house cocktails and only one with whiskey. It's Chicago in the winter. More whiskey, please. Aside for that limitation, there was one bartender working the small bar and fulfilling drinks for the whole restaurant. Service was slow. Drinks were fine. Not life changing, but adequate. Enough with the drinks, let's discuss the food, which was done tapas style (multiple small plates). Food at Mercat ranged from pretty good to life changing. Dramatic? You have not had pluma iberica. It was one of the best things I've eaten in my life. No exaggeration. Aside from the pluma, we had a smoked trout salad which was recommended by the server. It was much better than what I expected. The salad is served with potatoes and the trout's smokiness was wonderful. We also had octopus which was cooked well, pimientos de padron (algunos pican, otros no), lamb chops (cooked perfectly), and gambas a la plancha. The shrimp (gambas) was spicy, in the right way.  Overall, the food was very good and on the food alone, Mercat deserves five stars.  Service was not bad. It just wasn't good. It was well, serviceable. It felt like the server was nice enough, but he could've been more attentive. For example, if you have to ask for your water to get refilled, that's a bother at a restaurant of this level.

Great music, food, and service!   Wtf happened with this place and why 4 stars.  I was excited so pretty disappointing.  If i wasnt so hungry, Id hve found a Mgr to inform about their service.  Good luck or try another place nearby (not many with as high as yelp reviews ugghh).",0.9225,0.804,0.136,0.059,0.5814285714285713

2016-09-23,4.0,"We chose this place for dinner as it was around the corner from the Auditorium Theatre where we were catching a show. It was a nice dining experience. They have a notable wine list and it appears that they rotate some of the dishes based on pictures of the menus that have been posted here. First thing to note is that all of the dishes on the menu are tapas-sized portions.  Compared to other tapas places I've visited, the dishes were quite small so keep this in mind when ordering. We ended up ordering more dishes as we were still hungry. Because of this, the bill can be a bit pricey, but the quality of the food is very good and makes up for that. Thirdly, this is a lively place and it can be quite loud so conversations can be a bit of a challenge depending on the time of day you go. We dined at 5:30 pm on a Thursday and by 7:00 when we were leaving the noise level was fairly boisterous. Otherwise, the place had a cool vibe and the service was great. I'll offer a review of what we had: Datiles con almendras (bacon-wrapped dates) - there were only 4 and they were quite small but very flavorful. $9 Patatas bravas (spicy potatoes) - there were only 7 about the size of a tator tot. The sauce had a kick but wasn't overly spicy. Decent tasting, but not overly wowing. $5 Truita De Patata (Spanish omelette) - was the size of a drink coaster, decent tasting but nothing I'd rave about. $10 Empanada De Verde (spinach and cheese) - this was one of our favorites.  It was only one cut in half but the taste and sauce was excellent.  Enough for 2 people to split. $10 Costillas De Ternera (short rib flatbread) - another favorite and a good size for 2 people. The meat was very tender and the horseradish taste was very subtle. Excellent dish. $14 Ravioli D'anyell (lamb and cheese ravioli) - another highlight. There were 5 and very of a good size. The sauce made the dish. Enough for a few people to split. $14 Pici Amb Xoriço I Botarga (chorizo bolognese) - good size for 2 people. This was good but not as good as the other pasta dish on the menu. $14 Albondigas (beef and lamb meatballs) - came with 7 medium marble-sized meatballs. Had a slight kick and the sauce was tasty. Enough for a few people to sample. $12 Mar I Muntanya (chicken thighs and scallops) - came with 3 small scallops and 3 chunks of chicken.  One of the larger dishes. Scallops were good but the chicken was average. $14 Horchata Bon Bon - $4 each but very good. Nice for a small dessert treat. Xocolate Y Avellana (dark chocolate mousse with ice cream) - this dessert was decedent and a good size for 1-2 people. Liked the espresso kick, which wasn't overpowering. $12 Good overall dining experience and recommended to others.",0.9979,0.815,0.167,0.018,0.5819642857142859
2016-09-20,5.0,"Simply amazing.  The soup (Arroz A La Cazuela) is in a saffron chicken broth.  Ingredients include lobster, rabbit, chicken, artichoke, chorizo and paprika Aioli.  Gambas Al Ajillo is about 9 shrimp sautéed in olive oil w garlic and mild Guindilla chili.  Xocos Fritos is fried sepia (like calamari) or also called cuttlefish.  Lightly fried strips of delicious calamari like fish with a red and white mayonnaise (Aioli).  Outstanding!  They have Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA on tap too.  100 out of 100.  I'm a big eater but am trying to eat less carbs and more protein.  I'm stuffed.  My bill was $55.00 before gratuity.  So you can eat here without spending a fortune, at least by American standards.  And I feel great.  Great Mediterranean meal.  Feeling healthy already!",0.9795,0.798,0.202,0.0,0.524537037037037

2016-08-11,5.0,"The simian food critic, Iota, and I have visited this place three times in three days. The only mark against it, which I am forgiving, is that last night the waitstaff overlooked me for quite a while until a bar tender came by--and then they made up for the oversight by camping my glass of delicious and authentic sangria tinto and an amuse bouche of pan y tomate (I could've eaten a whole plate of that). Here's the run down of our first visit: ""Ickkkeeeiiesddola."" Iota warned that hotel restaurants are rarely great. Well, she was wrong this time. We didn't know this was Too Chef Jose Garces restaurant when we came in. I started to suspect something special when I saw what I consider to be an authentic tapas, modern and traditional, menu.  When the first dish came out, she said, ""Ickeiaia xtalanop."" Which translates to, see I told you. No way I'm eating those fish on nuggets.  By the time the padrón peppers came to the table, though, the brave simian had fallen in love with really good, well prepped anchovies brightened with lemon and olive oil on a pile of toasted pine nuts and chopped olives. Perfect bite territory, folks.  ""Yayayayyyyieeeaaaah! Coooorrreeeasddpopppo! Yum."" And when what she called the meet lollipops came out, she nearly knocked her chair over with excitement."" Um, me too, frankly. This place is knock your chair over good, people. Highly recommended. In fact, we are hear this afternoon for the third time.

The place was pretty empty when we got there but we didn't read into it. We let the host know we were there for their happy hour and interested in sitting at the outside patio. She said the patio didn't open until 5pm. Fine, we'll sit inside, it was a hot day anyway. She seats us at a table brings us their lounge menus since the full kitchen doesn't open until 5. Someone later hurriedly passes by to ask if we'd like something to drink and again we ask what the happy hour specials are since they weren't on the lounge menu. The serve says they only do half off on sangria and that's only at the bar. So if we want the deal we have to move. Moving wasn't a big deal, but the way he told us and tone he used were out of place. I proceeded to tell him we had made the hostess aware we only were there for happy hour and she still say us at the table. I take issue with the servers attitude. As a customer, I'm following the lead of the hostess and it was her mistake to seat us there. I did not appreciate the servers condescending manner towards us.

On the phone, we were promised a semi-private dining. However, when we got there it was a completely wide open dining setting. Another issue was the menu. Several of the guests had dietary restrictions, which we let the chef know way beforehand. When we got there, we see that the very dietary restricted items we had asked to omit were added to the menu. I mean this is completely inexcusable. We call our waiters and a manager came into supposedly help. He did apologize and said we could substitute the dishes for something else on the menu. When we got the bill, they double charged us for the dietary restricted item and the substituted item. Seriously, is that how you handle your own screw up. They tried to overcharge us for items, which were not agreed to our contract that we had signed weeks in advanced. Now, the biggest selling point for us was the whole pig that would be roasted. It was completely overcooked. There was no tenderness and moisture within the pig. If you are going to charge steep prices, at least learn to properly cook the pig. I would completely abstain from hosting any private events. I did not appreciate their tone and handling with us.

So, when you sign an event with her, don't expect the restaurant or the manager know the details of your event because they for some reason have a breakdown in communication between the event planner and the restaurant manager.  They told us we would have a semi-dining space, which  means you are just on the floor of the main dining room with a long table apparently. Then they add in food to your specific menu and expect you to pay for it even though it was not on your original contract list. Then when you have specifics actually put In your contract such as a no bacon for a specific menu item, they leave that out. We had also asked for duck and lamb meatballs as was on the original menu, they change it at the day of the event.  And then, DON'T GET THE SUCKLING PIG!  This was the main reason we picked the place, and the pig was extremely dry.  Watch your bill at the end because it will not equal the contract price.

I live in San Francisco so perhaps have very high expectations of restaurants in general but I was with a team of people from GA, NYC, OH, NC etc and we were all disappointed. The waiter sold us on the chef tasting menu and every restaurant where I have had the chef tasting menu you have to usually tell the staff to stop bringing out food as it is always too much. But the chef tasting menu at Mercat left us hungry and angry.  Also, there was an additional charge of $123 on top of the $65 per person which I only saw after I left. So not sure what it is for. They brought out rabbit ravioli as one of the dishes and a couple of people do not eat rabbit so passed but yet there was not enough to go round the table. We shared our feedback with the waiter and he suggested we should have got the LUXURY chef tasting menu?!?  We would have done very well had we ordered a la carte.

Our waiter was knowledgeable on the menu which we appreciated. I also got La Mora for a drink and it was delicious! For dessert we got le leche & because it was my birthday they also brought horchata!  The 4 stars is because the receptionist was not aware about how the valet works at all. she didn't know the address of the parking lot for valet, nor was she willing to take the keys or find someone to help. it's also free coat check so she gave me a number for my coat but when I went to go pick it up after dinner first of all no one was anywhere to be found so I waited until my waiter had to come and help and then I realized that she had just left my coat on the receptionist table.

Separated into tator tot size pieces topped with a light yet mildly spicy sauce, this dish is a great snack for a comparatively low price. The cauliflower dish incorporated an element of depth and texture through a crunchy topping, and the vegetables themselves were also very well cooked with a firmness and crispness that was neither chewy nor overly soft. Lastly, I loved the flatbread...they bring it out to you so warm that the cheese essentially melts in your mouth with every bite you take. My biggest disappointment, however, was the monte enebra cheese with a pear and saffron compote. The three flavors did not complement each other well as the saffron compote was not sweet enough to balance out the overpowering acidity and strength of the cheese/ pear combination.

My husband and I dined here tonight for Valentine's Day.   We made our reservation on Open Table.  When we reached the restaurant, much to our surprise, the only menu available was a special V-Day menu.  Open Table did not reflect this restriction neither did the staff when they called to confirm the reservation.   Our waiter said only minimal items off their regular menu would be available today.   With no other choice, my husband and I opted for the $85 tasting menu + $40 wine pairing.   Based on this pricing we were expecting a stellar meal, not because it was vday, because of the pricing.  Again, for the price of the meal, I have had better dinning experiences in Chicago.    Pros: The Staff - the wait staff was very attentive to clearing our table and bringing fresh plates and silverware.   They also didn't take dishes without asking if we were actually finished.  Our server was very informative on the dishes themselves and the wine pairings.  He explained the wines very well.  The Drinks - We got the wine tasting with our meal.   I felt as though the pairings really enhanced the food.   One of the better pairing experiences Ostres - Kumamoto Oysters, Espellete-Orange Mignonette Cordero - Van Well Farms Rack of Lamb, Guidndilla Aioli, Romenesco Cons:  Everything else.  We did not like anything else.  The lobster was over cooked. The scallops were over cooked. The shrimp were under seasoned.   Just disappointing.   Also, as I stated before, our server had informed us that the regular menu was not available for dinner tonight.    Which, was actually not true.  After our meal, and cringing when we got the check, we talked to the manager.   We explained how our experience was not up to par.   He was very humble and apologetic.  He also gave us a gift card to please dine with them again to make up for tonight.

2015-12-07,3.0,"We decided to try Mercat on the recommendation of a friend and based on our own experience at another José Garces restaurant in Philadelphia called Amada (that serves some of the best paella around, for sure).  Unfortunately, I was somewhat underwhelmed by Mercat, putting it solidly in middle-of-the-road territory. First, the restaurant itself is quite nice, with the modern interior complementing the beaux-arts style of the building and the dining room's high ceilings. This is a space you want to spend time in, but the food didn't totally rise to the setting. As I've already hinted at, the food was good, but I can't say that it was great. We had a variety of tapas, including a very small truitta de patata (the Spanish omelet), a very nice cauliflower dish (the highlight of the evening), the costilla de ternera, an empanada verde featuring plantain, and the patates arrugatas. That last dish was a fall-back, since we were taken aback when we were told that the kitchen had run out of patatas bravas. Every tapas lover knows that patatas bravas are an absolute staple when having tapas, so I'm puzzled as to why a restaurant at this price point can run out of something so basic as this dish. (There were obviously potatos in the kitchen, and the patates arrugatas were hardly a good substitute.) Finally, the gambas al ajillo, while tasty, came out lukewarm - those should have been piping hot when they hit the table (and, in retrospect, I should have sent them back). As far as the drinks went, we had the red (tinto) sangria - again, good, but not great. If you happen to be in the Loop and are curious about Mercat, sit at the bar, have a cocktail, and order one or two dishes, so you can try it out and decide for yourself whether to linger a little longer and have dinner.",0.9923,0.851,0.136,0.012,0.5853065134099616

I've been to Spain before so I was missing the tapas.  I don't remember the names of all the dishes I had but I believe one was a chicken skewer dish, wrapped dates, and another one.  Don't get me wrong, it was very flavorful and enjoyed every bite but the portion size is TINY even for tapas (~15 each).  This ended up being a very expensive appetizer instead of a full dinner for me.

2015-12-01,4.0,"So our evening started on a weird note -- we came here on a snowy weekend evening and were told that they were full, despite having several long tables open. Yet we had seen reservations on OpenTable in 15, 30 and 45 minutes -- when we pointed this out to them, they said (in a somewhat weird way) that couldn't be the case because they were full. Not wanting to make things extra awkward, we (and other parties behind us) took their advice to go down to the bar downstairs. The service downstairs couldn't have been more different. My friend and I both ordered the sangria flights, and when we asked how many. We were recommended to get 2 plates each, but since we were pretty hungry since we had just flown in...we went for 3 each. Spoiler alert: we were REALLY full, but all of the food was great. Ranked in order of my preferences (note that the coliflor, pulpo and costillas were recommended by our server): Pimentos de padron - Although not too complicated to make, I just couldn't stop eating these little peppers. Less smoky than izakaya shishitos, they were just the right amount of salty. We were told for each order there are a couple extra spicy ones; I stumbled on one of them and it was great. Coliflor amb mostassa (roasted cauliflower) - the texture on the cauliflower was nicely crisp, and overall a nice balance of flavors - the pickled mustard seeds cut the goat cheese, while the spicy bread crumbs (the best part) cut the raisins. I would have been happy ordering a second dish of this but it was also a pretty good quantity. Pulpo a la planxa (grilled octopus) - simple preparation to big effect. Texture was just right. Gambas al ajillo (garlic shrimp) - the six shrimp were large, juicy and sufficiently garlicky. The accompanying toast was a little bit harder than I would have liked, but I was just happy eating the shrimp by itself. Conill amb castanyes (rabbit agnolotti) - pasta filled with ground rabbit in a broth and covered in a rich brown butter foam. Perhaps it's because this was the last dish to arrive and we were pretty full, but although the plating is beautiful (#foam) the broth was a lot lighter than I thought it would be given the ingredient list, and the foam/agnolotti/broth felt like separate parts. Costillas de ternera (sparerib flatbread) - I think the flatbread might be the best value on the menu in the sense that you could just order one of these and be full, but in that case, I'd probably prefer to order two of the veggie dishes (or a veggie and bar snack) for the same price. The flatbread is about 1/2 to 1/3 the size of that at a New American restaurant, but regarding the taste itself -- it tasted a bit more like a BBQ pizza with a lot of meat and in my opinion, not enough horseradish. We were also given a couple complementary bites (crostini, a little extra sangria), probably since they were heading out for the evening. I'm taking off a star for the welcoming experience and the slightly high pricing - but overall, we had a really fun time at the bar, and would go back again.",0.9986,0.813,0.172,0.016,0.4981453762809695

I went with my very foodie friend so we ordered a bunch of different tapas and a great bottle of Spanish wine. We probably got 4-5 dishes but my favorite were the bacon wrapped dates (because...bacon) and the short rib. Both went really well with the wine we ordered and both were very rich with flavor. Our server was fantastic and very helpful with his recommendations to us. The atmosphere at Mercat is romantic with its opulently upholstered booths, high ceilings, and dark colors. It's a great date or special occasion spot. Not many locals think to go here as it is within a hotel but they are really missing out!

The wait staff is incredibly knowledgable and attentive. Water glasses were constantly refilled and dirty plates removed in a timely manner. Individual plates are not expensive but when you order 3-4 plates per person, the bill skyrockets. Our bill for 4 was $280; we had 2 glasses of wine, 2 beers, and 4 desserts.

We arrived at 6:50 for a 7:00 reservation on a Saturday, and were told our table wasn't quite ready.  The hostess suggested we get a drink at the bar downstairs, even though there seemed to plenty of open tables in the dining room.  I had just watched a group of 4 (with no reservation) get seated at an 8-10 person table, so I couldn't quite understand why we couldn't sit at one of the empty 2-4 top tables.  I mean, they walked in immediately before us, and I witnessed the entire exchange.  However, I enjoy a drink before dinner, so I didn't really mind too much at the time. Cocktails were pretty good.  Draft beer is $9/pint.  I understand downtown pricing.  However, service should match.  Bar service was slow, and it took at least 5 minutes for the empty glasses from the previous drinkers to be cleared once we sat down.  I should note that the bar has seating for about 10 people, and there was both a bartender and a barback working the area.

2015-08-04,2.0,"Terrible.   I travel a lot and eat Tapas in almost every city I travel to and this was by far one of the worst experiences I have had. To start with, the sangria tasted like watered down grape juice and had very sparing diced lemon in it? What is that even? For $10 a glass you can afford to put some fruit or alcohol in it... The Mixto Meata was OK, but the portions were greedy small, maybe an ounce of each? Again, for $16 you can afford to give a consumer more meat. We also got the cheese plate, which was not bad, but the cheeses included were all VERY aggressive, VERY strong flavors to most people would not care for, I'm a huge fan of Spanish cheeses but not of the taste of foot so we did not even finish this.   The dates were delicious, nothing bad to say about them. The octopus tasted like paprika, and that's it. And, again, was about a 2 ounce portion sliced thinly with sliced potatoes giving the appearance that it was a full tapas plate.   The patatas bravos tasted like a greasy fried potatoes covered, again, and paprika. I don't know what the chefs obsession with paprika is but almost everything we ate at copious amounts of it.   Lastly, the one entrée we tried the scallop and chicken dish that a piece of glass in it!  The chef assured us it was not a piece of glass, but we are certain that it was.  It made my friends tongue bleed so riddle me that.  They were kind enough to comp the dish but that is still inexcusable.   Highlight of the meal.. Was the olives.   And that is sad for a Catalonia-styled tapas restaurant.",0.9899,0.762,0.173,0.065,0.6401521164021163

2015-07-15,1.0,"I ate here with a group of 7 over the 4th of July weekend on the patio and had one of the WORST dining and customer service experiences I have ever had. The Story: We had a group of 7, 3 couples and 1 single, all at one table on the patio. We ordered drinks and waited an extremely long time for the waiter to bring them back and finally take our order. We then placed our food order and all 7 of us ordered a dish. Over 20 minutes later, 3 dishes were brought out. We then waited for the rest of our food thinking it was just another waiter coming. We waited, and waited, and waited..... Our server kept walking by and never said anything or checked on us. After 30 MINUTES, over half of our table still had no food. We finally got the waiters attention and he acted like he was amazed the food never came and said it would come soon. ANOTHER 20 MINUTES later a manager finally walked to our table to say they were firing our 2 missing orders. We corrected him and stated that we were in fact missing 4 orders and were asked to place the orders AGAIN. Finally another 20 minutes later, the final 4 food orders made it to the table. During this time, there were no apologies offered. No drinks were offered. NOTHING WAS DONE other than saying our orders never made it to the kitchen. After an almost 2 hour dining experience, another manager came to the table to ask how our meal was. When we voiced our concerns he didn't care and walked away.  Finally, after another 20 minutes of not being checked on we were able to get our checks. The waiter stated that the manager had placed discounts on our meal due to our bad experience. We all (4 checks) opened our bills to find that NO DISCOUNTS had been placed on our checks. We called the manager out and asked him where the discounts were and he stated ""He split them among the checks."" When I pulled out my calculator to show him that NO DISCOUNTS were on our checks and that we were in fact charged for drinks we never received, he huffed and puffed, snatched the checks back from us, and stormed off. Another 10 minutes later, our waiter (not the manager I may add) brought out our checks to show a 10% discount for a HORRIFIC dining experience. In all of our complaining and issues, NOT ONE member of the staff offer any apologies. I was amazed at how awful the service was for such a highly rated restaurant. We were in town for the holiday and a concert and Mercat wasted our afternoon and left a bad taste in our mouths. In summary, the service was simply deplorable and Mercat should be ashamed.",-0.9892,0.874,0.023,0.103,0.4843095238095237

The drinks were watery, which didn't bode well, but the figs w/ marcona almonds were delicious. Unfortunately, the figs were the highlight of the meal. The croquettes had an odd texture and were overpowered by lemon. They did bring us comp tomato bread, but it was aggressively salty and very, very heavy on the balsamic. The saffron sauce that came with our cheese selection was cloyingly sweet. The cheese was delicious, but four tiny slices of bread was a bit light given the price. After that, we decided not to order anything else. I would go back for wine (not cocktails or sangria) and the figs, and maybe to try the fideos, but otherwise there is much better tapas in the city.

The lamb chops was cooked just right, the sauces on the side added a light flavor to the overall natural flavor of the lamb. The best part of the meal had to be the dessert. It was the sweet corn cake with blackberry ice cream. The corn cake had puree next to them that added just the right amount of flavor and tartness to the sweet and moist corncake.

I would come back here just for that  Meet and cheese plate: i always wanted to try iberico pork it was great a really high quality pork the sauce was to die for when he said it was lavender i was really worried but no it was great it wasnt a true meet and cheese board because there was only 1 cheese and it was hard it was really delicous though and one meet the condiments didnt really help i just dipped everything in the sauce  Tortilla:lol for the price dont serve me an omlett there was saffron on it though just wish it was implimented in the sauce not as a garnish didnt like it just a normal omlett with potatoes  Chicken croquette this was really good it was really crisp and i loved the sald the sauce was really good tasted like lemonaden really good successful dish Ox tail ravioli: i thought this was gonna be amaizing it had like the littlest bit of truffles wish  there was more i didnt like it at all the sauce didnt taste good and the actual ravioli wasnt good really a poor execution  Flatbread: this was really good the cheese was really high quality it was salty and really rich the actual bread was really crisp it was really good Roasted cauliflower: this was so good be warned the sour cream underneath is really over powering so try to avoid it because theres alot of it and it kind of ruins the dish! It was perfectly cooked really was a home run best vegetable dish i ever had Grilled shrimp: it was cooked perfectly there wasnt any actual seaoning on the shrimp though so it was flat the sauce was good though not enough though Lamb chop: i love lamb but i hated it it was over cooked and needed seasoning really badly and there was a lot of sinu on it the sauces did improve the taste of the lamb not alot though Mushroom rice: this was really good tje rice was cooked perfectly not gummy at all then there was shaved asparagus on top which was really tasty all in all really good would order again Corn cake: this was really delicous everything worked together perfectly i didnt eat the canella because it made the dish way to sweet. All the condiments were really great the cake was moist not dry loved the fresh berries the crunchy stuff on the side of the plate was really good the icecream was really good but was way to frozen so it was hard  Bon bon the sauce was really good the bon bon wasnt really thay good way to frozen really disappointed  Service: it was okay didnt really like it didnt like his recommendations and he would disapear for a while and my plates werent picked up so they would just sit there and no new utensils which sucked because i need clean utensils its awkward always waiting for him for long periods of time  Atmosphere: its really pretty i love the big open windows which u can look out,0.9843,0.686,0.164,0.15,0.5509477427334574

For those of you who don't know, Mercat is connected, but you can enter from the street or inside the hotel. We were in the lower level of the restaurant which was pretty small. My understanding was that this was more of a cocktail/lounge area for folks to mingle, because there weren't really any large tables for seating. Although there was a crowd, we were able to snag a couple stools up at the bar. Their cocktail list is pretty extensive. My sister and I both decided to go with their Menta Cidro which is grey goose vodka, st. germain, mint, fresh citrus, and soda. I highly suggest this drink! We both thought it was amazing and so refreshing. No alcohol tasted at all which is always delicious (and dangerous). I want to say the cocktail cost about $8. We were pretty hungry and originally planned to hold out for the event we were headed to in a half hour, but of course decided to peruse the menu anyway. It was a little much for what we were looking for at the moment, but I would love to check out their tapas another time. We were kind of just hoping for like some chips and salsa, but the closest thing to a snack was their quesos and meats, which we weren't feelin' at the time.  Our waitress was so nice and attentive.

2015-05-08,3.0,The best thing we had here was the chicken croquettes.  They were good but everything else was pretty marginal.  The spicy potatoes were bland.  The bacon wrapped dates were good but it's pretty hard to less those up.  The cheese plate was alright.  The flatbreads (shrimp and mushroom & sausage).  The paella negra was probably the biggest disappointment as it was incredibly salty.  I would not go here again.,0.9253,0.698,0.231,0.072,0.6537878787878788
2015-05-03,5.0,"Whenever I lecture at Columbia College Chicago, I end my day at this restaurant. It's located inside the Blackstone Hotel, which is simply gorgeous. The atmosphere is lively, always crowded, and the noise level is above average. The decor is pleasant, a mix of cutting edge and traditional.  The seating is comfortable and the place is clean. The waitstaff is efficient, but cold.  I credit the lack of warmth with the fact that they seem to be understaffed, so each person has a tremendous amount of tables to hustle. The food is phenomenal.  Each bite is a symphony of flavors.  Those reviewers complaining about portion size don't understand the concept of tapas.  Each plate is supposed to be one or two bites. This restaurant is pricey, meant for special occasions or for those who can afford to indulge. Valet is available at the hotel entrance or you can walk from a nearby parking lot or garage.  I always choose valet, since it winds up costing less than a lot or garage. This place is great for groups, due to the nature of tapas and the availability of a very long table with ample seating. The flavors are authentic Spanish.  I highly recommend the garlic shrimp, bacon wrapped dates (could eat a hundred of these), and luxury tasting menu.  You will leave full and satisfied.",0.9831,0.816,0.152,0.032,0.6104244306418218

That being said the cava I ended up with was delicious.  Also, the amuse bouche, a bruschetta like tomato toast was great and the diver scallops were tender and delicious.  As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a tapas plate, which means you will likely need to order a few plates. This place is not inexpensive.",0.9745,0.71,0.235,0.055,0.5019607843137255
2015-04-22,4.0,"Located inside the beautiful Renaissance Blackstone Chicago Hotel, this trendy tapas restaurant has a great presence. For starters, try the  MENTA CIDRO or the GINEBRA & TONIC for drinks. For an ""appetizer"", we had the  GARROTXA / GOAT'S MILK.  It was our least favorite of all the dishies we tried.   VENERAS Diver Scallops was very good. Cooked to perfection. SETAS AL HORNO Wild Mushrooms, Confit Potato, Shallot, Truffle, Parsley, it was okay for me, fincee loved them though..   OLIVES Arbequina, Cornicabra , Zorzalena, Gordal, Surprisingly Awesome! That is if you like olives.  COSTILLAS DE TERNERA Beef Shortribs, Horseradish, Parmesan, Bacon Marmalade, a little heavy on the parmesan but excellent none the less. DATILES CON ALMENDRAS Bacon-Wrapped Dates, Marcona Almonds, La Peral, the keyword is bacon.  Anything wrapped in bacon is wicked awesome but actually it is the almonds that make this dish great. CORDERO Rack of Lamb, South Dakota small version. we had the small version the lamb was a little to rare to my liking and would have liked to see more of the sauces for the portion given. Overall good dish.   Dessert XOCOLATE Y AVELLANA 70% Cacao Barry Dark Chocolate, Creameux, Hazelnut Nougatine, Espresso Granita & Caramelized White Chocolate Ice Cream, One of the best desserts I have ever had!  Perfect.  CROQUETES DE XOCOLATA - On the house. We ate all of this too very exellent. 38% Cacao Barry Milk Chocolate Croquettes, Banana Marshmallow, Rosemary Infused Caramel, Arbequina Olive Oil This was great dinner.

2015-04-19,4.0,"A big group of us came here on a Saturday night for a friends birthday. Surprisingly we had no problem getting a reservation at a decent time. When you walk in from the street, it just looks like a tiny bar, but when you go upstairs, it leads to a huge open room with a high ceiling. Overall it had a pretty lively vibe. Service: We had a big group and the service was pretty good. The food came out quickly and they checked up on us pretty frequently. It was my friend's birthday and they were nice enough to bring out a glass of champagne and a dessert with a lit candle in it for him. Food: As a lot of the reviews have said, the food was pretty good but the portions are tiny, and it's definitely on the pricey side. Our waiter was suggesting 2-3 plates per person, which added up real quick.   Pan con tomate - They take complimentary bread to the next level. This was basically their version of bruschetta. Super crispy piece of toast with a garlicky, tomato mixture on top. If only these were unlimited! Patatas Bravas - Basically fancy tater tots (only 7 total). Eh. They didn't taste bad, but it just wasn't anything special. I was really excited when I saw how great it looked, but was disappointed at the flavor of the paprika aioli. It was just sort of neutral and didn't really have a bold flavor.  Croquetas de pollo - Another case of the food tasting ok, but nothing really too special about it. The outside was fried crisp and the inside was the consistency of mashed potatoes. I didn't really get any hint of chicken at all.  Bacon wrapped dates - A must order at any tapas place. Each order came with two toothpicks containing literally a bite sized bacon wrapped date. As usual, this dish had a great sweet and salty flavor mixture with a nice crisp layer of bacon on the outside. This place was a little different by having an almond in the center. I'd still say the bacon wrapped dates at Avec or Meson Sabika are better though.  Pintxos Muranos - Now we're talkin. Two skewers of bacon wrapped lamb covered in a super rich lamb au jus sauce. The lamb was tender and the seasoning and flavors were on point. In the middle was like a small cherry tomato. It was served over a big crouton and some sort of puree. Solid dish overall. Paella Valenciana - This dish was brought out last since it took the longest to cook. It was one of bigger dishes, so it's great dish to be shared by the whole group. It was different than the usual seafood based paellas I've tried. The rice was amazingly flavorful and was mixed with chorizo, tomatoes, peas, etc. The chicken on top was juicy and on the outsides of the bowl were crispy pieces of toast with some sort of saffron aioli on it. Just delicious.  Costillas de Ternera - Crispy flatbread that had beef shortribs, parmesan cheese, and a bacon marmalade. I loved this dish. The shortribs were as tender as can be and the flavor of it was just great. There was a huge mound of parmesan cheese on top and it paired awesome with the sweet/salty/smokey bacon marmalade. Coca de Jamon y Queso - Ham and cheese flatbread. This had a creamier texture than the other one. A bunch of cheese blended together seemed to bake right into the crust and then it was topped with strips of serrano ham Rabo de Toro - Braised oxtail ravioli. Probably my favorite dish of the night. Again, the braised meat was super tender and whatever reduction sauce that coated the ravioli was awesome. It was dark and had a really bold flavor. I wish it came with a bigger serving though.  Chorizo - This dish was pretty standard, meaning it was what I expected Chorizo to taste like but nothing too memorable. I wish there was a stronger garlic flavor to it.   Albondigas de Cordero - Lamb meatballs. Not a fan of this one. It just tasted like generic meatballs, and the meat itself was a little dry with a tougher texture in the middle.  Iberico secreto - Slices of succulent pork that was super fatty and tender, with the perfect amount of char. The fat caramelized on the outside and it was just endless juiciness in the middle. This is some quality barbecued meat. It came with 3 different sauces, but the meat itself was so good I didn't bother adding them.  Dessert: Croquetes de Xocolata - Tiny pastry balls surprisingly filled with melted chocolate.  Xocolate Avellana - This was an awesome dessert that had some creamy mixture of hazelnut and coffee flavors served inside a crunchy caramelized ice cream cup.  Overall, I thought this place was pretty good. The main drawback for me is the price. The bill for our group of 10 was over $750 (including drinks though). Price aside, it was a quality dinner where we were able to try a bite of a lot of different things without killing the night by being too stuffed to go out drinking afterward.",0.9997,0.753,0.227,0.02,0.5494112554112555
2015-04-14,5.0,"5 stars all the way! 100%! This place far exceeded my expectations in every way. I have to say that this is probably one of the best meals I've ever had! This restaurant has made me rethink the five stars I've given to other places in the past. They hit the mark on so many levels.  Ambience: you walk up the stairs thinking ""am I in the right place?"" When you reach the top of the floor, you look over the railing into the sprawling dining room with bare lightbulbs dangling like stars in the sky. The room has a warm feel to it. And although this place was entirely booked, leaving no room for additional reservations, it didn't feel absurdly crowded. The square footage was well used. There was enough room between tables that you didn't feel like you're part of conversations you weren't supposed to be part of. It still felt relatively private. Customer Service: wow! Our waiter knew his stuff! We were seated promptly and greeted promptly. We had waters immediately. Our waiter did a great job of welcoming us to the restaurant, explaining what they do, and making some great suggestions without seeming pushy or dishonest. Initially, when we asked if there was a gluten-free menu, I felt a tinge of disappointment. That was quickly remedied because our amazing waiter ran through the menu on what options would be good for us. And trust me, we eat at enough places around the country to realize this takes a lot of work and passion for what you do to have that sort of knowledge of such a large menu.  We never had a dirty dish sitting on our table for more than a minute. We didn't wait long for food. They had a full staff, food runners, bussers, you name it. The restaurant worked like a well oiled machine, and everyone was professional. The food: Oh. My. God. The food! Everything was so delicious. we had Pimientos de Padron, Gambas al Ajillo, Patatas Bravas, Arroz Verde and finally Braised Short Rib with Scallops. We each had a wine flight which pair do really well with our entire meal. Neither one of us knew very much about Spanish wines, so it gave us a good opportunity to sample some. Our waiter also gave us a colorful description of each wine. I could go on and on.... Just make a reservation and go!",0.9952,0.817,0.162,0.022,0.5185714285714287

2015-04-06,2.0,"I've been wanting to try this place for sometime now after hearing good things.  After dining with a friend for her birthday - I left completely disappointed last Saturday.  Were there some good tasting tapas in the middle of all of this - yes - but overall, the experience did not meet my expectations.  Unfortunately, I think our server had something to do with it. On a positive note - it is a nice room with a good vibe.  There were some really tasty dishes we enjoyed.  Top of our list was the Black Olive crusted Ahi Tuna - YUM !  Also, the Mixed Baby Greens with Green Asparagus, Avocado,  & Shaved Mahon Cheese - awesome.  Grilled baby octopus also very good.   On the not so good -Rabbit and Foie Gras Rillette - huge disappointment.  Their drinks were also a huge disappointment.  A bourbon cocktail HIGHLY recommended by our waiter was overly sweet and a very, very small pour (for $13 - really???).  Also, as others have commented, their Sangria's left me underwhelmed especially when the waiter pushed the Rose' flavor as THE BEST (best if you like a watered down wine drink).   Biggest disappointment was our waiter.  He was mostly smug and disinterested.  When I asked him about about some menu items, instead of explaining to me what they were - he would simply say - ""everyone likes that one best - you should get that"" without explaining what it was.  When I asked for some help with the Charcuteria selection, he response was - ""well they are all pork - what do you want.""  I tried to politely explain what I wanted was to understand what type of meats they were so I could decide which one(s) to order, I got a roll of the eyes and a sigh and he quickly tried to direct me to the chef's selection but could not tell me what they were.  At this point - I knew we simply had a bad waiter and decided not to order any meats from him.  It's unfortunate because I heard the waitress serving the table next to us and it seemed like they were getting a much better experience and were given much better guidance with the menu.   So after spending over $200 for tapas and a few drinks for two - I leave here not recommending it to any friends or visitors to the city.  Some gems on the menu but drinks and service were the major detractors for me.",0.997,0.728,0.21,0.061,0.4865686628186629

With 3 in our party we tried 9 different plates and 3 desserts as well. Every single dish was strongly and uniquely flavored and everything went together beautifully. Cheeses were unique and had well thought out sauces, cured meats were salty and garlic was a star. Highlights included a mild and moist halibut, always a favorite of mine, and truly amazing braised short ribs that were so tender that you didn't even need to cut it.

2015-03-01,2.0,"I want to start this review with a couple benchmarks. I really like Cafe Babareeba, and I love Jaleo in Washington DC.  I had really high expectations with this place because of Iron Chef Jose Garces and because the place has good reviews, but this place falls way short of being good.  We came in Friday night after work.  It's February so we had coats and our work bags--they didn't offer coat check, and they tried to sit me and my 6-foot tall husband at a tiny corner table for 2 where we would have to sit diagonally from each other, both on the bench.  We said this wouldn't work and they moved us to a better table that was in the corner of the restaurant.  The server was slow and inattentive. He ignored us and 3 other tables in his section.  He said that we had to order our entire order and couldn't add orders because the kitchen had to time the food.  This comment is amazingly confusing to me because tapas are small plates that are meant to be shared and are part of an experience of having food and drinking--a good time.  Their concept seems contrary to the ideology of tapas to me, but okay, we did it their way.  So we ordered 5 items with wine and sangria.  The sangria was sugar water, no flavor of wine or saffron, plus they used canned pears--not worth $9.  The rioja my husband ordered was good though.  The food came individually, one dish at a time, very, very slowly.  The first dish, garlic shrimp was terrible.  I've had better quality shrimp from Chinese take out--it had no flavor, the texture was almost fake, then to make it worse, it was under-seasoned and the oil had a strong raw garlic flavor.  The octopus was good, good smoky flavor, tender, good dish. The blood sausage was good too.  The roasted cauliflower was not roasted, it was steamed and so underwhelming that I forgot the flavors.  Same with the potatoes, and plantain empanada, no flavor and boring.  These dishes came out one by one in a span over an hour from when we ordered, unbelievably slow.  Terribly run restaurant, mediocre food.",0.9588,0.787,0.131,0.083,0.532113652113652

And not spend an arm and a leg. After all, we ate our main meal at lunchtime. Now let's move this concept to the USA, Chicago. Let's park ourselves at a huge hotel restaurant--if we can get a table and put up with the noise--order some designer cocktails and a ton of small plates--for we have big American appetites, and dinner is our main meal--and try not to have a heart attack when we see the bill. The dishes here tend to be good.  The plates tend to be small.  The prices tend to be high.  The problem is the concept. Order delicious oxtail ravioli in a dark reduction. You are served 3 small ravioli (for $16 before tax and tip). I estimate I could easily eat 9. (That would cost $48). Or instead, order additional plates of something else. I had the verdosa salad, a heap of mixed greens with tiny, hard to find slices of asparagus and avocado hidden in the mix. Don't forget drinks. All the while, the tab is mounting. Whose idea was it to serve appetizers and charge like entrees?

To start, the sangria flight. It all tasted so watered down. Not flavorful at all. As I was reading the descriptions, I kept wondering ""where are these flavors?!"" The patatas bravas and the rabo de toro came first. The fried potatoes were okay. The smoked paprika aioli was good but...eh. This was just okay. I really did like the oxtail ravioli. Only thing was that the edges of the ravioli were too tough. Also, the oxtail was tender, but the shaved truffle and manchego cheese was lacking flavor. The star of all the dishes I got were the scallops. These were perfectly made and well-seasoned.  I came here solo and dined at the bar which was fine. Would I come here again? Maybe. I don't know. I need to really be stunned by the food next time. Wouldn't get the bland sangria flight though. Disappointed. Good service though from bartender.",0.9624,0.823,0.136,0.04,0.5211805555555555

I ordered a ginger-based cocktail, which was nice. Note: people dress up to come to Mercat!  We ordered a few dishes to share, tapas-style: tuna tartar, bacon wrapped dates, and around two more meat-based dishes that I cannot seem to recall.

Much. Food.   As if those FOURTEEN dishes weren't enough, the vegetarians in our group had an incredible complementary substitution menu!     Very reasonable price for how much food they gave us, especially considering the quality of it.  5 stars isn't nearly enough for how wonderful everything was!

However, it did help that the restaurant is actually really good! I've been here once before several years back and tried the chef tasting menu. I loved it then and I still love it now. This time, since I went with a group of friends, we just decided to order a bunch of stuff to share instead of doing degustation. The place was a crowd pleaser as some of my friends were pretty hard to please and they all were pleasantly surprised of how good Mercat was. The sangria was awesome and definitely a must have. The tapas.. You name it.. We didn't have anything bad from the patatas bravas or spicy potatoes, gambas al ajillo that was super garlicky spicy, the pork belly with fried oyster and blood sausage, chicken croquette, the empanadas, the wagyu steak, the mussels... All hit the spot! I love love the amount of garlic they put in their food. It was so much that it burned! Good thing I wasn't kissing anyone if not God help that guy! Lol. It wasn't the cheapest tapas and it was definitely more refined form of it. The portion was smaller but we were all stuffed. However, after getting and splitting the check, it didn't end up that bad per person and it was well worth it. No one was sticker shocked at $40 per person with the alcohol and the gazillion amount of plates we ordered. The service was great too. The place was packed from the crowd of the All Blacks rugby game that just ended. Our server also had a ten top table next to us that consisted of all Kiwis, garbed in All Blacks jerseys ready to drop some USD on the table. However, between our eight top and that ten top, our server didn't skip a beat. At the end, when we thought we were done, he told us that there were still at least two or three more plates that hadn't made it to the table yet. We asked him that if they were not made yet just to cancel it as we were full. They were made but he cancelled our order with no fuss.

I will say that while we enjoyed the delicious food, the portions were far too large. By the second course (out of 4), we were completely stuffed. This is really unfortunate, because the flavors are lost when you're THAT full.  When we asked what the third course was going to be, my fiance and I were hoping he would say something along the lines of ""oh, it's going to be a light sorbet or a macaroon or a glass of water"", but no...""your next course will be lamp chops, lobster and stretchy pants to accommodate your ever expanding stomach"". I would still recommend this place to anyone visiting the S. Michigan Ave. area, but try and stay away from the tasting menus; unless you have the stomach capacity of Kobayashi. Here's a rough list of what was served: - MIXTO: Chef's Selection of 3 Meats (it was okay, but nothing spectacular) - AMANIDA DE QUINOA: Quinoa, Grapes, Fennel, Pine Nuts and Lemon Yogurt (very refreshing and very tasty!) - DATILES CON ALMENDRAS: Bacon-Wrapped Dates, Marcona Almonds, La Peral (tasty, but very rich) - RABO DE TORO: Braised Oxtail Ravioli, Shaved Truffle, Currants, 18 Month Manchego, Tempranillo Reduction (Enjoyed this one very much, very rich) - COCA DE JAMÓN: Serrano, Manchego Bechamel, Yellow Tomato, Arugula (Meh, it was okay) - PULPITO: Grilled Baby Octopus (Liked this one a lot as well. Very tender and flavorful) - COLIFLOR AMB MOSTASSA: Roasted Cauliflower, Pickled Mustard Seeds, Golden Raisins, Paprika Bread Crumbs (It was good, but couldn't enjoy it since we were WAY too full by the end) - CORDERO: Rack of Lamb, South Dakota (again, good, but way too full to enjoy) - LANGOSTA: Maine Lobster (such a shame that we were this full to not enjoy the lobster)",0.6263,0.872,0.074,0.055,0.5565306122448981

It's a good thing we stuck indoors for a bit; the skies opened up for at least an hour while we ate. Tapas is something that's grown on me over the past couple of years. I started out not liking it very much because I didn't understand the tiny portions, but over time, I began to appreciate the subtle differences across the variety of food options. Mercat helped me enjoy tapas a little bit more. To start off, I ordered an El Bolero drink (lime and avocado) and it was excellent. It was a perfect blend of tart and sweet. For our meal, we ordered the Datiles Con Almendras (we ended up getting a second order because we liked the dates that much), Gambas Al Ajillo (garlic shrimp), Mixto Croquetas (Serrano ham and chorizo croquettes), and the Truitta De Patata (Spanish omelette with spinach, potato, and saffron aioli). I didn't think I'd like the omelette, but it was surprisingly light, and the aioli was a nice touch. The Gambas Al Ajillo was a little too garlicky for my taste, but still delicious. The Mixto Croquetas were also good, albeit tiny. Our service was prompt and efficient (I think our server's name was Jacob), and at no point did I feel rushed or pressured to order anything I didn't want.

The best thing about this place is the way it looks- with an open kitchen and cool decor, it definitely looks the part.  Just like a ""black light beauty,"" things fell apart once we looked closer.

I spent a few days before going over reviews, drooling over pictures, and making a game plan for the day. Haha WELL....it was the most disappointing dinner ever!!! :-( First, service was great. I ordered a Sangria flight and I loved the variety and WOW was it strong! I usually only like white sangria but I was surprised how great the rose & red sangria tasted. If you are not sure what sangria to get I recommend their flight. They also have a great wine flight. Their cocktail drinks are also great...which is a plus! Dessert was probably our favorite part of the night. We ordered xocolate y avellana. It had a lot of different flavor going on, but the bits of saltiness made it good. Unfortunately, our food was not good.  Patatas Bravas: Looks great....but Small portion and there was something weird about the Aioli. The potato was good but the sauce was not. Setas de Horno: I love mushrooms. I just didn't like the texture of these mushrooms...very rubbery. I think they were over-cooked. Plus this dish was very very salty. Oxtail Ravioli: VERY VERY small portion 3 Raviolis for $16, but it was probably the most decent tasting tapas of all. Pork belly: Horrible. Waste of money because most of it was left on the plate. In one word it tasted ""dirty"". Tortilla Espanola: another major disappointment. I think they worry about presentation on this one and forgot flavor.  We ordered another tapas but I just can't remember much about it... On a side note, the main room in on the 2nd floor and is very opened so it was a little loud but you can still hear your table. Unfortunately, the bathroom is downstairs and it is a very creepy dark bathroom.  The bill does not equal the quality of the food and it was a waste since food was basically left on the plates after a few bites.

2014-06-30,5.0,"I have to say that our overall experience at Mercat was excellent (despite a little hiccup in the beginning). We planned to have a large party dinner at Mercat as the last night of our family reunion a couple of weeks in advance . Not only was I excited about the menu, but knew that it would be a great experience for a few members of the family who would not otherwise have Spanish cuisine or the seek the variety that tapas offers. The skinny on the hiccup has to do with the reservation and accommodations not being what was previously discussed, arranged or confirmed, but Casey quickly made sure that everything was set right and we had a wonderful time! During the reservation process we were told that the family reunion name could be printed on the menus- Casey came through with that and it was a great little keep-sake as well. For all of that, I could not give less that 5 stars- it was a pleasure dining there! From Casey (extremely nice, intuitively accommodating and professional restaurant manager- a true rock star!), Naomi (our amazing, knowledgable and humorous coordinating waitress- our guide on the tapas trip!), to the additional serving staff and the hostess, we were quickly made to understand that they would care for us and do so well. Casey and Naomi put us at ease and allowed us to trust in the dining experience. SOO happy we did! The food was delicious. I mean- REALLY delicious. We had the La Mesa De Jose Tasting Menu and were pleasantly met with top fresh ingredients, spices and flavors for each and every item. It was a absolute treat.  In our party we had a couple of vegetarians and pescatarians- easily accommodated with individual adjustments in the menu. Some of the favorites still being talked about days later: Pimientos De Padron, Gambas Al Ajillo, Verdosa (that salad will give you pause- just wow), Pelotas, Veneras and the Ribeye. The desert was the PERFECT closer: Croquetas de Xocolata. A member of the family may or may not have foraged for these on the other end of the table because there were being ""consumed too slowly"". Unconfirmed. The table wine and cocktails well matched the food. The accommodations exceeded our expectations as we had planned to be on the main dining floor. Naomi even brought in a couple of small speakers so that we could enjoy the music during our dinner (a couple of elders hinted they may be moved to even get up and samba!).

2014-06-19,3.0,"Just got back from dinner at Mercat, which came highly recommended by no fewer than three people. Yet, my husband and I found the whole experience to be, on the whole, rather disappointing. The menu is long and a little overwhelming. Lots of things looked tasty, but we were torn between choosing our own selections and going with one of the tasting menus. We asked our waiter, Jerry, about the difference between the standard and ""luxury"" chef's menus and were told that the luxury version featured more ""exotic"" selections. I wasn't sold, but my husband, riding high on a recent dinner during which we had (and loved) beef tongue and frog legs, wanted the more adventurous option. So, we went for it, even though I was nervous about flying blind. Our meal started with the bacon-wrapped dates, which were warm and salty and sweet. and helped get the meal off on the right foot. It was followed by the Serrano ham, Cadi Urgelia (cow's milk cheese with a bacon caramel and thin green apple slices), and a tricolor quinoa salad with pine nuts, raisins, and a lemon yogurt sauce - all very good.  Before we received our first course, I ordered the Menta Cidro (Grey Goose Citron, St. Germain, mint, fresh citrus, and soda) - it was fantastic, but I pretty much fall in love with anything that has St. Germain in it. I finished it by the end of the this round of dishes, but Jerry never asked me if I wanted another, or followed up with me about any of the wines. The empty glass sat on our table until right before the check came.  Next up, we had some flash-fried peppers (eh), oxtail ravioli with aged manchego in a tempranillo reduction (delicious sauce - one of my favorite bites), grilled baby octopus (surprisingly tender), a flatbread with more Serrano ham, some microgreens, tomato slices, and cheese (good - my husband liked it more than I did). We were given the roasted cauliflower next, which we liked...and then came the proteins. The lamb chops and accompanying sauces were excellent - the meat was super tender and full of flavor. But the half lobster that was served with it was completely overcooked. I'm talking rubber lobster, to the point where we actually sent it back. Jerry apologized (insincerely - he looked at us like we didn't know what we were talking about) and ordered us up another lobster half. This one was inconsistent; in some places, the lobster was cooked fine and in others overcooked again. I have a hard time sending the same thing back twice, so we just picked at it trying to find the less rubbery parts. I should mention that in the middle of the meal I went to use the ladies room and it was a horror show. The room is dark, and by dark, I mean there are literally three small orange lights in the room, one by the sink and one in each stall. The walls are painted black and you can barely see anything. One stall had water all over the floor and two rolls of toilet paper sitting in the water. The other stall's door wouldn't close; I had to force it shut. The sanitary trash can's lid was broken, the sink wouldn't drain, and even the woman who was using the facilities before me remarked, ""This is disgusting. Why is it so disgusting?"" So when the lobster incident occurred, and our waiter Jerry seemed so detached from the whole thing (almost annoyed), I started to feel soured on the experience. Even without the overcooked lobster, I definitely don't feel like I got my money's worth. When you pay that much for a nice dinner, you expect the whole package - great service, perfect ambiance, impeccable food. I've had that at other places with similar price tags, and just last night, I had that to the nth degree at a higher-quality restaurant with a much smaller price tag.  When Jerry asked us about dessert, I mentioned the issues with the second lobster. He said, ""You should've told me. I could've done something about it."" Well, we did tell you about it the first time, and you didn't do anything except give us another overcooked piece of shellfish. We asked for the check and left. If the dinner had cost even half of what we ended up paying (which, for the record, is the most amount of money I've ever spent on dinner for two), I might have been able to overlook the lackluster service, bad dish, and gross bathroom. But I didn't. I forked over a lot of cash for a meal that ended up leaving a bad taste in my mouth. literally and figuratively.

We came in around 9:15 on a Tuesday night, so that was our mistake, although the restaurant is open until 10:00 PM. We went with the chef's tasting since it was already fairly late. Let's get this out of the way: the tapas were all excellent. I would recommend the mushroom flatbread, the bruschetta, bacon-wrapped dates, garlic shrimp, and many of the other things that we had. The sazerac made at the bar was very good. That being said, our service was really, really, really bad. The restaurant was pretty empty; we were asked if we had a reservation (we didn't because it was a Tuesday night and we were in the adjacent hotel) and were seated in a corner with very little space. We were barely checked on by the wait staff and they seemed annoyed to be serving us at all, though they were perfectly happy to be serving all the other patrons. We went for a while without refills on drinks, then five tapas would be brought out at once. We were made to feel unwelcome for coming in late. I think our server recognized there was a problem at the end and tried to pull it together, but we really just wanted to leave at that point. The food was great, but being treated poorly soured the experience substantially. My recommendation is to tell patrons that your last seating is at 9:00 PM if you don't have any interest in new customers at 9:15 PM.

I loved the Blanco and Rose better which have a more crispy taste without too much sugary stuff. Ladies, you will like this. Tapas, Tapas! Everything we tried from the Tapas menu was delicious.

Garlic shrimp was so juicy and flavorful.  Ham and Chorizon Croueutte were fried so nicely. Perfect crunch outside and soft in side.

2014-04-29,4.0,"Mercat a la Planxa was a singularity in my life. I bookmarked this establishment weeks ago on the recommendation of my friend Mark G.  It turned out that the two of us were going to be in Chicago at the same time, so it was natural for us to visit Mercat together.  I told him that I'd defer to his recommendations. To my surprise, he suggested the tasting menu, which normally I would never have chosen.  Not only that, he wanted us to order the *luxury* tasting menu.  With wine pairings!  I felt a bit out of my league, but I consented without much further discussion.  Our server complicated things by pointing out that we wouldn't get much wine with our pairings, which were $40 apiece.  ""I can put you into a really good bottle for your 80 bucks!""  We ended up with a 2007 Rioja, which was only $75 -- I immediately felt a rush of virtuous moderation.  Actually, I was baffled because I thought that it would be natural to start with a glass of sherry or maybe a vinho verde.  No, said the server, the house cuisine calls for red wine. We sat back, relaxed and enjoyed the show.  The iberico ham was pretty darn good, but it didn't match the ham I'd had in Barcelona.  Everything else was good to excellent, and there was a lot of food that passed the top of our table.  Someone served us a plate of grilled peppers that were declared to be padróns.  I could see at a glance that they were shishitos and asked if they weren't possibly shishitos instead of padróns.  ""No, sir, they're padróns.""  I was sufficiently puzzled that I asked another server who passed by our table to ask how everything was.  She told us that the house gets its padrón peppers from Wisconsin (!) but that the growing season is very short (no surprise there!).  I was right; we were eating shishito peppers (and enjoying them tremendously). Mercat a la Planxa is definitely worth visiting.  I suspect that you'll get more bang for your buck if you order individual dishes and stay away from the tasting menus.  But maybe I'm wrong about that.  I had a headache the next morning, but it went away after a few double espressos.",0.9942,0.815,0.152,0.033,0.5281473214285715

I don't understand why, but definitely not complaining.  They have a small a la carte menu featuring pretty normal options (eggs, pancakes, Benedict's), but the way to go is the tasting menu. The menu changes daily, but it's usually six to seven dishes total plus charcuterie and pastries. It's TONS of food for only $28, such an unbelievable deal. The food is pretty solid, i usually love most of them and feel okay about a couple. Our menu today was manchego, chorizo, churros, cupcakes and cookies (charcuterie and pastries), bacon wrapped dates  + almond pancakes (first course), appetizer sampler plus chorizo eggs benedict (second course), then finally scrambled eggs with pork sausage and veggies + pork shoulder and potatoes (third course).

2014-03-30,4.0,"I found my happy place. Obviously, the happy place involves cheese. So I usually avoid ordering cheese plates at restaurants...not always, but I definitely think extra carefully about it. Mostly, because it's f*cking expensive, and I can go to one of my favorite cheese shops and pay significantly less for a larger portion of fancy cheesy goodness. At Mercat a la Planxa, they made the cheese board well worth my time. Each cheese selection is carefully paired with an accoutrement. Each cheese selection offers its own unique flavor combination.  And my happy place? Came in the Monte Crudo paired with truffle lavender quince compote. I seriously wanted to pick up the ramekin and lick every last drop of it. As classy as I am, though...I merely pulled it over to my plate as the busser was taking the mostly empty (save my compote happy place) cheese platter...and then I used bread to swirl the remaining contents into my mouth. I have zero shame. The other cheese and accoutrements were tasty, but the truffle lavender quince? I want to Sinead O'Connor that shit and start singing to it.  So the server recommended that we order 3 per person and that we order it all at once. We're not really the type to follow directions, apparently. While three of us waited for two others, we ordered bacon-wrapped dates and our server brought out the tomato bread (which was really good). We also placed an order for the paella, knowing it would take the longest. I'm pretty sure our server was super annoyed at us for not listening to her and for going out of order--basically our paella was going to come out before most of our food, which turned out to be a really good thing.  While we were eating the paella, we ordered a few of the tapas, a cheese and charcuterie, and a salad. We did not order 3 per person. We didn't even order 2 per person. And because the paella was so filling, we were down for the count a little past halfway through the tapas, with just enough room for dessert.  A quick rundown of the meal: DINNER Datiles Con Almendras - you can never go wrong with bacon wrapped dates. Paella Valenciana - my first venture into the world of paella. The BF doesn't do seafood, so we went with the chicken and sausage option. OMG. This thing fed an army and tasted AMAZING. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. The rice and seasonings were perfect. YUM.  Mixto Croquetas - ham and chorizo thingies. Very delish.  Patatas Bravas - if I told you they were just okay, would you believe me? Verdosa - this green salad was super refreshing and full of flavor.  Queso Mixto - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.Or just order 3 of the monte crudo.  I don't actually know what the other two cheeses were. The were not near the limelight. Charcuteria Mixto - It was okay. The mustard creme fraiche was quite tasty. DESSERT Croquetas de Xocolata - OMFG. I can't accurately describe how sweet and delish these little pots of gold sitting on marshmallow clouds were.  Blueberry Creme Fraiche ice cream - tasted like blueberry cheesecake Carmelized White Chocolate ice cream - my fave of the ice cream trio Blood Orange Cava sorbet - this was nice, but nothing to write home about I really wanted to give it 5 stars, but I just couldn't. The food was really delicious, but the service was really rushed. Our server was nice enough, but I feel like all of the items being brought out at one time is a waste. I can't imagine having ordered FIFTEEN dishes that all ended up on our TINY table at the same time. With five of us, crammed around a table that should only seat 3-4, we barely had room for the plates. It was a race to make room at the table. Additionally, I think that the 3 per person recommendation is off. I guess it depends on what you're ordering, but with a paella, we were good for 1 other tapas item each.",0.9983,0.807,0.158,0.036,0.5712865497076024

We were seated quickly which worked because I was approaching serious levels of hunger.  I noticed that the table next to us got some pan con tomate so I asked if perchance we would be treated to some, as well. I cultivated a true love for pan con tomate while in Barcelona so I was feeling like this was a good sign of what was to come.  We were brought the pan (fine, pretty good actually, probably the most 'authentically' presented thing we ate all night) and ordered a few other items from the menu to share. They were out of one thing we wanted and our server had some trouble recommending something to replace it, but we figured it out.  Then, inexplicably, our server took a turn from being decently friendly to not giving a crap about us anymore. He could not have been less interested in giving us an enjoyable experience. He obviously cared deeply for the two out-of-town ladies sitting next to us. They were being fawned over by not only our server but basically the entire male staff while Stuart and I are sitting right there feeling like outcasts. Let us in to your revery!

2014-03-06,3.0,"There are so many different tapas restaurants scattered across the Chicagoland area, but Mercat a la Planxa was one that has been on my list for a while that I haven't tried.  Due to the high recommendations from my foodie boss and knowing that Chef Jose Garces (winner of Iron Chef) is the executive chef, I knew I would have to give this place a try.  So during restaurant week, my two friends and I decided to take advantage of the discounted price.  But when we arrived, we just decided to order a la cart because the pre fixe menu didn't offer enough variety. We started off with some complimentary focaccia bread which was amazing.  It is probably one of the best tasting complimentary bread offered at any restaurant I have been to.  Everything on the menu sounded delicious, so we kind of ordered quite a few dishes: Coliflor Amb Mostassa: roasted cauliflower toasted with pickled mustard seeds, raisins, and paprika bread crumbs.  The cauliflower wasn't overcooked, so it retained its crunchiness which I liked.  I also enjoyed the different flavors that were tossed into this simple vegetable dish. Gambas Y Chorizo Flatbread: marinated shrimp with chorizo cantimpalo, garbanzo bean puree, tomato escabeche, and manchego.  This was very similar in flavors as the focaccia bread.  The only difference was that there was shrimp that topped off the bread.  We liked it, but were disappointed that it had a similar palette as the complementary bread. Ropa De Cabra: goat ropa vieja and goat cheese served with baguette.  This was way too rich for me.  Something about the mixture of the meat and cheese made the whole dish really hearty.  I couldn't bear to eat more than one tiny baguette. Datiles Con Almendras: dates, almonds, and la peral wrapped in bacon.  This is one of the dishes I was looking forward to because my boss kept raving about it.  I thought it was just ok.  To me, the dates weren't sweet enough to balance the saltiness from the bacon, but I did appreciate the surprise almond in the middle.  It gave everything a good nutty after taste. Gambas Al Ajillo: garlic shrimp served with guindilla chilies and toast.  This is one of the best dishes we ordered.  Everything about this dish was just right.  It was piping hot, the shrimp was very succulent, and the sauce seemed to be seasoned well. Mixto Croquettes: serrano ham and chorizo croquettes served with a romesco sauce.  We ordered this based on the reviews of many Yelpers.  There was nothing about this dish that stood out, but it wasn't bad. Patatas Bravas: spicy potatoes served with smoked paprika aioli.  This is a staple whenever I eat at a tapas place.  I thought these potatoes were just mediocre.  It didn't have enough kick to them, but I did like the crispy texture. For dessert, we ordered: Horchata Bon Bon: horchata ice cream, cinnamon, and puffed rice dipped in dark chocolate and garnished with coconut cream and marcona brittle.  Oh, this was so delicious.  Anything dark chocolate lures me in.  I enjoyed the freshness of the ice cream, spice from the cinnamon, and sweetness from the chocolate.  So many textures and flavors made this a winning dish for me. Croquetes de Xocolata: milk chocolate croquettes with banana marshmallow, rosemary infused caramel, and olive oil.  I didn't enjoy these croquettes as much as the bon bons, but it was still good. There are a handful of delicious tapas offered here but there was also a lot I wasn't too fond about.  Was this place worth the hype?  I don't think so.  I appreciate how they play with flavors and textures that you don't usually see in traditional tapas, but some just didn't work that well.  Also, the price tags on each dish are more expensive than other tapa places, approximately $12-$25 a dish.  I wouldn't mind paying the extra bucks if this place offered something spectacular, but it wasn't consistent across the board.  If I'm ever back in the area, I might stop in for a quick bite but I would not make the extra effort to come here.",0.9987,0.82,0.157,0.022,0.5288813303099018
2014-02-13,3.0,"My friend and I had dinner here on recommendation from a fellow foodie friend. Overall, it was a good meal, but didn't quite live up to the hype - and nothing kills my impression of a restaurant quite like unfulfilled expectations. We started out with a complimentary bruschetta-type dish that was garlicky and delicious. The crispy brussel sprouts and bacon wrapped dates were easily my two favorite things on the menu. I was sorely disappointed by the patatas bravas - I had high expectations after eating them for almost every meal while in Spain. At Mercat they were incredibly bland and the seasoning on it tasted like flavorless seaweed. Not my favorite.  For the meat dishes we ordered the 'mari y montanya' and a pork belly dish. The short ribs and scallops in the mari y montanya were to die for - absolutely worth it. Pork belly is usually my favorite, but the texture was not what I am used to. Instead of a crispy exterior the whole thing was soft and was more of a boiled texture. The flavor was great, though, so no complaints there. We washed everything down with a pitcher of rose sangria that was light and refreshing. All in all there were a few so-so plates and a few great plates. If I lived in Chicago, I would definitely come back to try out some of the other dishes. The price point is a little high but for a special occasion it's worth it.",0.992,0.696,0.225,0.079,0.5447495039682541
2014-02-11,4.0,"January is acting a fool this year, providing you with all the more reason to treat yourself to a warming meal during Restaurant Week in Chicago. There's nothing quite like braving negative wind chills to gorge on tapas that are much more appropriate for warmer weather. It's as close we're getting to a vacation. I tend to feel skeptical towards tapas: they're so tiny that you're smart to arrive with a semi-full stomach and aren't there always a couple of blah dishes?

2014-01-31,4.0,"I was curious about Mercat a la Planxa, so the hub and I decided to check it out during restaurant week. We weren't disappointed.  We got there early and they didn't have a table for us yet, so we took a seat at the bar. Both bartenders were very friendly and helpful with the menu. I had the sangria flight, because I couldn't decided. Hub had a gin and tonic with house infused gin and kumquats, which was hands down the drink winner of the night. It might be one of the best gin and tonics I've ever had. I enjoyed it so much that after I finished my sangria flight, I drank gin and tonics for the rest of the night. Hub had a couple of other cocktails as well but we both agreed that the gin and tonic was divine. After hanging out at the bar for a bit, they had a table ready for us. The dining space is really cool and comfy. We were seated in a little rounded booth. The tables are small and space is limited, but since it's tapas, you don't really need tons of room at the table and I didn't feel cramped at all.  We knew going in that we wanted the restaurant week menu. It's a great set up. You get three courses of small plates and a dessert. Everything is perfect sized to be shared. The first thing that came to the table was complementary bruschetta. It was deliciously salty and acidic and a great way to start things off. Then there was a salad, with serano ham and figs. And one of my favorite things of the night, the bacon wrapped dates drizzled with fondue. I could eat a whole plate of them! They are the perfect little umami bite of sweet, salty, savory, and yummy.  The second round of dishes included my second favorite thing of the night, which was a mushroom flatbread with manchego cheese. The flatbread was a perfect crispy texture and the nutty cheese really complemented the earthy mushrooms. We also had garlic shrimp with the second course that came out sizzling hot. They were garlicky and  really well prepared.  The third round of dishes included lamb chops, prawns, and patatas bravas. All three dishes were really good. The lamb was cooked perfectly and had a tasty romesco sauce with it. I'm not sure I really needed a second shrimp/prawn course, but the prawns were really large, and very flavorful. The patatas were really good too...sort of reminded me of tater tots for grown ups.  Now, I'm a dessert girl and honestly, I wasn't super excited about dessert based on the menu. However, when it came to the table and I took a bite, I found I didn't really want to have to share with my hubby anymore haha. The marshmallow was like the stuff in the jar but a thousand times better. and the little chocolate croquettes were a really fascinating texture with the crispy outside and gooey inside. All the flavors really worked together to make a very playful, but grown up dessert.  I loved Mercat a la Planxa. Often times we try places and they're good, but with so many other amazing places in the city, it's always more tempting to try something new rather than return to a place we've been. But that said, we'll be going back to Mercat sometime very soon. Between the perfect cocktails and so many delicious little dishes, there are more things that I'm dying to try.",0.9993,0.754,0.226,0.02,0.5136250257678829
2014-01-27,4.0,The food was great. The restaurant week menu did a great job of highlighting their tapas. The lamb and dates were my favorites. I was not a fan of the potato topped with sweet potato puree but the croquettes for dessert more than made up for that.

2013-12-30,3.0,"After skimming through some of the other reviews, it looks like most of us are in agreement here. Overall, I've really enjoyed the food both times I've dined at Mercat. However, it's not worth the pretty penny you've got to drop to try many things and fill yourself up here. Each dish is priced like a full entree ($15-$20 each approx) but is extremely tiny - even with a group of 4 you'll need to order multiples of the same dish! Now that I've tried a lot of the menu, here are some specific thoughts: patatas bravas - one of my favorites, made better than most other places wild mushrooms - delicious, but $15 bucks, really? empanada de verde - tasty, only comes with 2  flatbreads - all of them are good, again small for the price but easy to share oxtail ravioli, lamb meatballs, bacon wrapped dates - all are delicious!  There are a few I'm missing, but these are the dishes that really stand out to me. The space is great and I like the location, especially for hosting visitors that want to be near Milennium Park and other parts of downtown. The desserts and cocktails are also fantastic (and relatively reasonably priced), so overall this place will offer you the whole package. However - bib gourmand is a bit of a stretch, price-wise.

The foie gras was phenomenal, and we would definitely recommend this. dátiles con almendras and bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with almonds.  ahh, one of the highlights. sure many tapas places do this as well, however these were perfectly executed, and came with some  costillas de ternera and beef shortribs, horseradish, parmesan & bacon marmalade. good, the serving of shortribs was miniscule. still it was sufficient to whet our appetite.  escalivada d'alberginia and eggplant fritters with roasted red peppers, tomatoes and cipollinis, goat cheese and lavender honey. Excellent. the hint of lavender honey balances and enhances the otherwise too salty eggplants. all in all, it could work better as an appetizer.  ended with morcilla traditional catalán blood sausage, spain Good first experience with catalan blood sausage, a must try.",0.9915,0.799,0.194,0.007,0.6406432748538012

However some of the things we saw come out of the kitchen looked very good, and we had a little bit of buyer's remorse not ordering a la carte in the first place. Everything tasted fantastic, though, and we were worried there wouldn't be enough food but we left completely stuffed.  The second time was more recently, and we did a la carte in a group, and that worked much better. The portions are small, as expected, but everything was cooked perfectly - especially the seafood. Also the rabbit dish was excellent. They bring small palate cleansers/intermezzos complementary, sometimes, which was a nice touch.

2013-09-27,5.0,"Nothing works up an appetite like strolling thru the parks of Chicago.  We stopped by Mercat at lunchtime for much needed sustenance.  And this turned out to be my favorite meal in Chicago.  I had watched ""The Next Iron Chef - America"" when Chef Jose Garces competed and very happy when he won the competition.  So, I was more than happy to try his restaurant.  And as an added bonus, chef de cuisine Cory Morris was born in Salt Lake City, Utah.  So, I consider him to be my home boy. We weren't sure of the location of the restaurant other than it was in the Renaissance Blackstone.  When we arrived, I was thinking it was located on the first floor which is really the lounge area and was deserted.  I called and we were directed upstairs to the second floor and was greeted right away by the very friendly host staff.  We got a table over looking the dining room and near a bright and sunny window.  The tall arched windows are beautiful, lighting is cheerful and so it the use of color in the room. Our server was extremely professional and helpful and we knew that we were in good hands and even trusted him to assist us in making our choices for lunch.  BJ started with a local beer, I tryed a La Mora, which as Bulleit bourbon, agave nectar, blackberries, mint and black pepper.  When my server noticed that I was not a fan of my cocktail, he asked about that, but I refused a replacement.  But he took it upon himself to select me a different drink.  He got me a Menta Cidro, which was Grey Goose Citron, St. Germain, mint, fresh citrus and soda.  This drink was amazing and I loved it. For my meal I started with Arroz a la cazuela, which is a saffron scented broth with shrimp, chicken, chorizo, artichoke confit and piquillo aioli.  This is the best soup that I have ever had.  The very best.  It was very filling, full of flavor, so incredible.  BJ got an ensalade verde, the salad was mixed greens, asparagus, avocado, green beans topped shaved Mahon cheese.  The salad was also very good. For our meals, BJ got a hanger steak sandwich, which was a perfectly grilled medium rare.  It was topped with la peral cheese, caramelized onions and tomatoes.  It was really a good sized sandwich.  I got the shrimp & chorizo flatbread with garbonzo bean puree and tomato.  It was so good!   The only blip in our perfect lunch occured when somehow, my flatbread got confused for a short rib one.  The kitchen quickly worked to make me the correct one.  No complaints from me, mix ups happens.  But our server felt the need to reward us with a dessert.  Croquetes de xocolata was a welcome sight at our table.  These little balls of yummy goodness - milk chocolate croquettes, banana marshmallow, rosemary infused caramel and arbequina olive oil.  Perfect finish to a perfect lunch.  We loved Mercat.",0.9985,0.769,0.201,0.029,0.6007402008422417

Took away another star for the service- was told that in order to eat outside I would have to order dinner (not just drinks and appetizers).  This was at 8:00 on a Tuesday night....with tables open.  How pretentious do you have to be?,0.2197,0.908,0.045,0.047,0.5625
2013-07-05,4.0,Loved this place. The restaurant is beautiful. The sangria flights are a must. We couldn't decide which paella to eat so we ordered both. First off the bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer were amazing. We had the chicken-sausage paella and the all seafood paella with black rice. Both were awesome but if I could take the chicken-sausage paella and add shrimp or calamari it would be the perfect dish. The mussels in the seafood paella felt dirty- a bit too gritty for my taste.Overall loved this restaurant and would go back in a heartbeat.,0.9468,0.777,0.187,0.036,0.7106060606060606

A little too oily and salty for me. The pan con tomate was weird too, more like a bruschetta. That being said, everything from la planxa was very good, as were the vegetable tapas (espinicas a la Catalana, calcots, pimientos de padron, setas al horno) and the jamon iberico was very good (somehow was quite a bit better at Amada though, perhaps because it was hand cut?).

This time, its said to say I did not have the same experience. First, the food was coming so fast you couldn't find a spot on the table for it and the waiters continued to circle like vultures circling road kill in the summer heat looking for any empty dish they could take...nothing like having someone stare and you with the ""are you finished"" look. I wanted to have a little bread with some of the drippings on one of the plates, but I feared I would lose an appendage if I tried to grab the empty plate. Second, due to the fact that the food was shooting out of the kitchen like tennis balls from a machine during a practice session, the food on the table was getting cold. Once you went to have as taste (it is all tapas), the portion at the table was cold.  Third; can you be more over priced? Seriously. I eat at some very nice restaurants from coast-to-coast and I'm not opposed to paying for great food, service, atmosphere or something unique, but come on. It was $95 per head and we weren't boozing it up with wine or cocktails. What once was a fun inviting place now feels like an overpriced corporate food shack.",0.9409,0.798,0.132,0.071,0.5375

2013-06-18,1.0,"I've had a yelp account for some time and have NEVER taken  the time to write a review on a restaurant. Needless to say, I must have had a pretty bad experience to start now. Right off the back, I will say this: the food was delicious and innovative, albeit over priced. My issue was NOT with the food but with the service. I arrived at this restaurant prior to 8 last night. It was busy but I was seated right away. Once seated it took several minutes for anyone to even acknowledge my presence. Eventually someone came over and offered me water. Waited some more. Then my waitress arrived. She was friendly enough so I didn't hold the wait against her. I ordered an iced tea and 3 tapas. And then I waited ...... And waited........ And waited ........ After about 30 minutes, my first tapas came out. It was a clam dish and it was excellent. Unfortunately I didn't have anything to wash it down with because my server never once stopped by to check on me or offer a refill, even though she walked right by me several times.  So I waited ...... And waited. And waited. As plates of delicious looking food whizzed by mean without stopping, for more than 30 minutes.  At some point a random server literally tossed a bowl of olives on my table and almost ran. I called out to stop him and told him I hadn't ordered olives. He quickly said they were compliments of the chef and jetted off. So I waited. Finally, someone showed up with the 2nd of my 3 tapas. By then I'd stopped tracking the time. As I shoved the food in my mouth, starving, my waitress magically appeared. For the FIRST time ever she apologized for the wait. Blamed it on the kitchen. The same kitchen that had been cranking out orders for everybody else. Interestingly, STILL NO OFFER TO REFILL MY DRINK. Now here is what sent me over the edge. When the waitress came over, I promptly cancelled my order for the 3rd tapas. Given the wait, that should have been a CLEAR indication to the server that I was ready to get the hell out of there. But rather than applying good common sense, let alone good customer service, and bringing me my bill, the waitress disappeared AGAIN! And there I found myself waiting AGAIN. It took all my self control not to lose it. I spotted her as she came to service the table immediately in front of me and then started to walk off without even looking in my direction. I called out to her and requested my check, handing her my card at that time so that she would get the sense of urgency. She came over with the bill immediately after that and gave me another half hearted apology for the wait.  I actually contemplated not leaving her a tip. I've never done that before. But I decided that the problem wasn't just her. I do believe that something went wrong in the kitchen that contributed to the delay. But that was no excuse for her poor service either. I left exactly 10%. In the end, I walked out of that place feeling like an outcast. That is not a good feeling. And I don't care how amazing the good is, if I don't feel wanted in an establishment, I'll never return. I will not pay money to be ignored or abused. To Management: there are many excellent restaurants to choose from in Chicago. Folks on this site consistently complain about your prices. One of the ways you can make them feel that the prices are worth it, is to make them feel like THEY are worth it.

My husband and I dined at this restaurant for dinner service on memorial day. Within 4 hours of consuming our meal, which we shared, we had sudden onset nausea with vomiting and diarrhea. Both of us. Our symptoms lasted for 48 hours. I reported the incident of FOOD POISONING as soon as the restaurant opened the following morning. Management refused to take responsibly for the contaminated items they served us, and we were told that we would still be responsible for payment of our meal.  My husband and I are both doctors, and I was in the care of another doctor the next day. I offered to provide them with my medical records as proof of the incident because bloody diarrhea, vomiting, chills, and abdominal cramps do not typically constitute ""the flu,"" which is what we were diagnosed with by the manager. And it's definately not about the money; it's the principal. It digusts me. And instead of keeping it quiet, I have sent the written report to the Iliinois State Department of Public Health.

We made reservations for 8pm, we arrived ten minutes early and were told to wait at the bar until our table was ready, no biggie because we were ahead of schedule. We waited until about 8:10 and checked on our table. Still, not ready, and the hostess told us there was one table ahead of us. A table ahead of us?? We're not on the wait list. We have reservations which means there should be no one ahead of us since our reso was for 8pm and its 8:10. Clearly they were behind on wait times, but she didn't seem too apologetic, which was even more annoying. So back to the bar we went. I had some kiwi cocktail which was very refreshing! We sat at the bar until 8:40 when someone finally came to get us. On a positive note our server, wish I remembered his name, was pretty awesome. He knew the menu inside out and was efficient. We had a pitcher of sangria, which was delicious, and ordered 6 small plates: cheese mixto plate, jamon serrano, garlic shrimp, scallops, bacon wrapped lamb, and short ribs on flat bread. Each dish was amazing!...with the exception of the scallops, they fell a little flat, but still edible. For dessert we had chocolate and marshmallows. Sweet and just the right portion, little flavorful bites. Overall, the food was pretty good, but Mercat might want to have a talking to their hosts. If you're behind on times, communicate that. Don't make the guest feel as if its their problem. Maybe check on the guests a few times to reassure them you're working on their table. Apologize!

Also, the small buffet they advertise was a joke. It was just sliced up manchego cheese and chorizo. 2 items in a buffet? RUDE. There was dessert included in the buffet but it was just a big display of the same items (boring cupcakes cookies and muffins). Also a joke.  Most of the dishes were tasty and the bacon wrapped dates were prob my fave. The icing on top of the cake for me was that they brought out all the dishes really rapidly, but then we waited for awhile for the paella. In my head, I thought ""oh they must be cooking up a big batch of the paella since it takes time"".

No biggie, Saturday offers a ""Catalan Express"" menu which includes 1 appetizer, 1 main, and a iced tea or fountain drink for $18. Not bad. I had the Spanish omelette -- a classic tapas dish and a good gauge for any Spanish restaurant. It was cooked to perfection -- moist and flavourful eggs and potatoes with spices, with a crispy outer layer. I tried one of my DC's mushroom soup which was very rich and delicious too. Another DC had the jamon serrano over salad -- a very big portion but not the most exciting option (you could easily make the same dish at home). For the main, I had grilled sea bass with spring peas and red quinoa. Everything was very fresh and bursting with flavour, with nothing too overpowering.  Service was a little scattered but not so much to distract from the amazing Catalan food. Location is great! 2 of my DC's said it was better than any restaurants they tried in Barcelona!

2013-04-06,3.0,"Good tapas, but the portions are too small and the prices are too high. You are dining at an Iron Chef's restaurant located in the South Loop so the high prices are to be expected.  The restaurant is located in the Renaissance Hotel right on Michigan Avenue.  You can get great views of the lake from the restaurant as well since it is on an upper level. My boyfriend and I shared five tapas while my parents each got an entree.  For our tapas, we started out with the bacon wrapped dates, the goat ropa and the lamb meatballs. The bacon wrapped dates were unlike any other bacon wrapped dates that I have ever eaten.  This was because they were stuffed with an almond.  I loved the crunchiness of the almond mixed in with the sweet and salty flavors of the dates.  Delicious!  I could have seriously just eaten these as my meal. The goat ropa was excellent as well.  The goat meat is shredded in a way that resembled pulled pork.  It was served with goat cheese and grilled baguette pieces.  The goat was absolutely delicious and was cooked perfectly.  The tangy and creaminess of the goat cheese were nice additions to the meat.  I liked mixing it all together and topping the baguette pieces with it.  However, there could have been more baguette pieces served along with the meat.  We had to request more bread so we could finish it. The lamb meatballs were OK, but definitely not anything to write home about.  I really didn't enjoy the way that they were prepared.  It was served with a sherry foie cream and peas.  I didn't care for the sherry. Next, our server brought out the salad, which comprised of Catalan spinach, currants, pine nuts and thinly shaved green apple pieces.  I really wish that he would have served us the salad first instead since my stomach was already very full of meat.  The flavors were good, but the portions were too large. Last we had the diver scallops, which I didn't enjoy.  It was served with some sort of basil and pesto sauce.  I thought there was just too much sauce on them.  They were cooked well, but the sauce ruined it for me. For dessert, we shared the ice cream and sorbet trio.  We tried the pink peppercorn strawberry, vanilla peach and blueberry creme fraiche.  You must try the blueberry creme fraiche!  I wanted to ask if I could take a pint of it home to go!  It was creamy and tangy with a nice hint of sweetness from the blueberries.  The pink peppercorn strawberry was good, but it could have used more peppercorn.  The vanilla peach was a solid ice cream, but nothing out of the ordinary. Service was fine, but he didn't check up on us much.  I think that would have been different had we each did the tasting menu ($65 per person).  The ambiance was just OK as well.  It definitely was not as lively as other tapas restaurants that I have been to.  Maybe this was because we dined on a Sunday night, but nevertheless.  It was way more mellow and subdued. Overall, I'm glad that I got a chance to visit and eat at an Iron Chef's restaurant.  But, I don't see myself rushing back any time soon due to the small portions and the high prices.",0.9982,0.79,0.173,0.037,0.4998384353741496
2013-04-05,4.0,"Loved this place, great atmosphere.  We came here because 1) Purple Pig had 1:45hr wait times at 5:30pm on Friday (What???) and they don't take reservations 2) because this place was three blocks away from the CSO and we had tickets for the concert that started at 8pm.  Needless to say, we wanted classy and yummy dinner.  Mercat a la Planxa was just the ticket! We loved the intimate bar located on the ground floor so much that we decided to just sit there at one of the funky tables that reminded me of my grandma's sewing machine with a butcher top block instead of where the actual sewing machine should be.   There was an impressive wine selection with several Catalunyan wine options, plus decent choice of Scotches, Whiskeys and other top shelf stuff.  We had white Anchovy dish with pine nuts (to die for, if you like anchovies), a Manchego cheese plate with absolutely delicious lavender and quince jam and an apple, a mushroom tapas (probably the best among all of the other stuff that we ordered) and Spanish omelet (forgettable, don't order- it's tiny to the point where it's almost seems that it's mockingly grinning at you from the large round plate on which it is served).   The bartender also brought us some fresh baguette to scoop up all the olive oil from the anchovy dish.  She took our order and when I told her that I was a vegetarian, she kindly asked the kitchen to sub chorizo for mushrooms on my flatbread.   The prices here are a bit on a high side (flatbread for example was $10 for approximately 4-5 small slices, enough for two people to share if you are ordering other stuff).  But considering how great the service was, we did not mind paying more.  Also, we were able to have a great, quick and delicious quiet dinner without loud music or high noise level that is omnipresent in more popular spots.

This area seems to be nice for those that are dining by themselves or with one other person for a quiet quick bite. You go up the stairs for the main dining area, which is very open and spacious. We came for Chef's Week, but there was no special menu. We got the regular choice of the lunch options that they have available La Mesa de Jose where the chef creates his own special tapas menu for you or The Catalan Express where you get a choice of 2 options. I was pretty disappointed by this because we could have come any other day for this. It was misleading as the restaurant didn't specify that they were doing Chef's Week only for dinner here or I just made assumptions that they would have a special menu. In any case we shared the Spanish omelette and the croquetas. The portion of the croquetas were really small. I had the salmon as my second and that was the item I probably enjoyed the most. The patatas bravas were french fries with the spicy orange sauce that was not spicy at all. We also split the hazelnut mascarpone gateau with apricots.

2013-03-17,2.0,"I had wanted to try Mercat for quite some time, but had been put off by the prices. Recently, I threw frugality to the winds and paid a visit. Sorry to say I was disappointed -- the place just didn't deliver value commensurate with the prices. We ordered the $65 tasting menu so we could sample a variety of dishes. On the plus side, there was plenty of food. A few of the dishes we sampled were OK, but none really stood out, with the exception of bacon-wrapped dates, which were quite nicely done. Octopus was tasty enough, but a little tougher than it needed to be. A salami plate and a cheese plate were enjoyable. Prawns had a faint ammonia character (as happens all to often). A steak plate was flavorful, but very gristly. The vaunted spinach with currants & apple was much too salty. (Saltiness was in fact a theme, as can be the case at Spanish restaurants.) Patatas bravas was nicely presented, and tasted fine. Drinkwise, I had the wine pairing, and was underwhelmed by the quality (my suggestion: start with a glass of nice garnacha, then have a glass of tempranillo). There is a fairly comprehensive selection of Spanish wines by the bottle, but they seem a bit pricey -- based on my experience buying Spanish wine at retail, there ought to be a few decent bottles of garnacha and tempranillo in the mid-$30s, not the mid-$40s. Service was admirable in one respect: pacing -- our courses came in a timely fashion and we got out in time to make a show without rushing. The plate runners were courteous, but spoke so quickly that we couldn't really understand what they were presenting. The bussers were similarly courteous. The main server did a decent job of introducing us to the menu, but seemed rushed & brisk. The ambiance was not to my taste. We were fortunate to have a four-top table -- if we had been at one of the tiny two-tops, it would have been miserable trying to fit all the dishes on the table. The noise level was OK when we arrived, but built throughout our visit to the point where trying to converse was unpleasant by the time we left. The whole experience reinforced for me why I'm about done with hotel restaurants: overpriced, so-so food, unrelaxing ambiance, rushed service and an overall ""food factory"" feel. There are Spanish dining options in the city that deliver much better overall value, and I'll go to them when I want a tapas fix.",0.9924,0.822,0.136,0.042,0.49291666666666656

2013-03-16,5.0,"I came here for a $25 brunch and was extremely impressed. I got to sample the meat, cheese, and dessert station located in the center of the dining room. The cheese I think it was gouda was alright - pretty standard. They had chocolate-covered strawberries and super cute tiny raspberry tarts. Our first course consisted of sweet potato-almond milk buckwheat pancakes topped with sliced strawberries, cardamom whipped cream, and syrup on the side. These were most excellent. And then came the bacon wrapped dates. They were amazing and couldn't be any better. Our second course was a salmon benedict and peppers. The beautifully-plated benedict was made of seared skuna bay salmon, a poached egg, a sherry compressed tomato, and maltese sauce atop a potato croquette. The padron peppers, green and shaped like chili peppers were served with a yummy salbitaxada sauce. By the time our third course arrived I was feeling pretty full, but didn't want to miss out on the revuelto de conejo and cochinillo asado. The first was soft scrambled eggs, braised rabbit, brussels sprouts leaves, glazed carrots and truffle chestnut toast. The cochinillo asado was a roasted suckling pig with grilled onions and romensco sauce. I didn't care for this dish so much, but then I probably wouldn't like it no matter who made it.  The bloody mary bar had three choices of mixes - a traditional, and then two lighter mixes - one a pale green which was really mild, the other pink which I didn't try. I went for the traditional, and added chili powder, paprika, a pepper shaped like a tiny pickle, and a celery stick. They had one kind of fun addition which was a jalapeno pepper stuffed with sausage and a watermelon ball on either side stuck on a skewer. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. One of the people in my group is a vegetarian, and the cook actually prepared separate dishes for her, which I thought was really thoughtful. For each course, the chef came out to tell us all about what he had made. All in all this is a fantastic choice for brunch and I would definitely come back.

The last time I was here, we ordered a pig for a friend's 30th birthday.  Now I know that sounds like a great idea on paper, and G-d knows there are few more effective ways to firmly establish yourself on the top of the food chain, but take it from someone who has walked this path too many times, it's ALWAYS a better idea in theory than in practice.  When you order an entire animal at a restaurant you make the chef focus on the arduous task of cooking a very large thing, and not the act of making the meat that you get from that animal taste as delicious as possible.  This has been true every time I've done this, from multiple times at Frontier, to getting a goat leg at Girl and The Goat, and here.  Seriously: just don't do it.   Thank you for listening to this very important public service announcement.",0.9935,0.774,0.207,0.019,0.6056166056166056

2013-02-14,3.0,"My friends took me to Mercat for my birthday. It worked out that a Wednesday night would be the best for us so my friend made a reservation requesting a window seat, divulging that we are foodies not some out of town conventioneers and foodies who would be reviewing their visit. Not only that, we were there to celebrate a birthday and wouldn't it be nice if they could stick a few candles in whatever dessert we would end up ordering I arrived first, or so I thought, and took a seat at the bar in the Bodega just inside the front door. I ordered a specialty cocktail called the Matador, a Hendrick's Gin based cocktail with, among other things, beets and fresh thyme. The drink I received had neither beets or thyme because, the bartender said, he was out of them. Nevermind. A few moments later one of the other two friends arrived. She poured over the menu and ordered a white-foam topped cocktail that had, again among other things, white wine and basil As our reservation approached ee made our way upstairs to the dining room and  checked in. The hostess assured us that she had reserved the requested table at the main window, until she realized someone else had been seated there. She did note that another window seat was about the empty and that we could have it, but it wasn't really the table my host requested. The other person at the front desk offered us each a glass of Cava while we waited for our friend and our table in the small and tight holding pen a few steps below the hostess stand The space is punctuated by a view of the kitchen, lots of tile, a 70's inspired honeycomb that stretches from the Bodega downstairs to within a few feet of the ceiling from which hangs modern bare-bulb pendant lights. Mirrored walls with caricatures of Iron Chef Garces and his staff working the Bodega and restaurant seemed to expand the space while the warmer tones keep the space exactly that. When the table was ready we were seated and our waiter was quick to approach and walked me through the menu as I was the newbie We were encouraged to order 3 to 4 things per person and I was assured the portions were big enough to share which hasn't been my experience in other tapas restaurants. But my fears were soon quelled. We each ordered 3 things and before we knew it the food was flying out of the kitchen before slowing down towards the end of the meal. The 2nd flat bread we had ordered was one of the last things to come out. It was considerably more 'done' than the first which was recommended to me: a beef short rib bread with bacon jam and caramelized onion topped with a copious amount of Parmesan cheese that didn't bring nearly the salt the dish needed. The 2nd flat bread had mushrooms and ... allegedly ... sausage, but the sausage was sliced paper thin and only noticed by one in our party who peeled it away from the bread. I still wasn't entirely sure it was sausage as it was overpowered by truffle oil that intensified the taste of the mushrooms. In fact, the running theme of the evening was truffle oil Fried dough balls were the most disappointing, including the ham and cheese croquettes that had no ham flavor whatsoever and the, what turned out to be 'free' dessert, of milk chocolate croquettes that simply tasted of fried dough, over-powering the weak milk chocolate. That they were free in honor of my birthday was a poorly veiled insult. Salmon was over-cooked and lacked flavor beyond the crispy skin and I almost forgot the unimaginative salad we picked through and let the waiter clear when it was just over half eaten Stand outs included the rabbit in pasta, rillettes (with more bread), the plantain and spinach empanadas (mostly thanks to a very flavorful 'relish' that contained red bell peppers that were beautifully marinated) and the foie gras. The only grilled item (apparently their 'specialty') was the garlic shrimp ... with the heads still attached. I was excited about sucking the head, but they were empty. What is the point of serving a shrimp with the head if the brains have been removed ... and by whom? The shrimp were nice and large, beautifully cooked, meaty, white and redolent with garlic and sauce. There were questions about the quality of the vodka served over the vodka ordered ... and lo and behold, the 2 more Matadors I had both contained beets (a mash in the bottom of the glass that lent a very faint earthiness to the drink) and a soft sprig of fresh thyme Freebies included the garlicky-tomato bread and fresh, mild, green flash-fried chilies with a Romesco sauce ... and the milk chocolate croquettes thanks to my making it through another birthday While this review feels a bit harsh, we did enjoy our time and most of the food. I think when I go back I'm going to play it differently and order a bottle of Spanish wine and eat my way through their grilled tapas",0.9959,0.858,0.104,0.037,0.4203360131931561

Not really the case, they just select items off the menu. Perhaps I misunderstood and that would be ok except that nothing that came out was stellar. The lamb chops were very good and a cheese/apple/caramel plate had perfectly blended flavors, otherwise nothing to get excited about. Omlette/potato, mushroom flatbread, bacon wrapped dates--all very basic. Two dishes were just bad--head on shrimp was literally mealy. Something was wrong. And overcooked octopus. Fantastic wines, great bartender & host--very flexible on a snow-stormy night.

The concept of the Tapas are great and they are indeed very filling. The plates were a hit and miss. Some were delicious and we would eat them all in a matter of seconds, and some were just ""okay."" Took a bite and pushed it to the side. I expected the meats + cheese stations to have a little bit more selection than the one meat to choose from and the two cheeses.

2013-01-11,3.0,"Went there for dinner on Christmas Day, and with very low expectations, and they delivered right on. We did not want to do Christmas-inspired special menus at other  places and Mercat seemed to be the only reasonable place that wasn't offering one (and neither were they closed). To our surprise, when we were seated we were given a Christmas Special Menu, 15+ courses of small plates to be shared.  When we asked for the regular menu they gave us one! (why not just give both at the same time?)  No pressure to go for the special menu however, later on during the meal we heard our waiter trying to sell the special to other tables. We got the Arroz a la Cazuela with lobster, chicken and some other meats in a saffron broth, the Chorizo with paprika and garlic, the Ropa de Cabra  (stringy goat meat with goat cheese) and the sausage flatbread with roasted garlic and manchego. (we probably ordered another dish but I can't seem to remember, guess it was the least memorable of all). The waiter disappeared after we got served the first three dishes, the flatbread took what seem an eternity. We attributed it to the fact that perhaps they were not expecting very many flatbread orders (almost every other table was doing the special menu). The goat was the only one I would go back for - it was delectable given that it isn't easy to get that right stringy consistency.  We found service lacking but like I said we went with very low expectations so we shielded ourselves from disappointment. Our waiter even brought us the wrong check (and I couldn't imagine why anyone would spend upwards of 300 bucks on this kind of food).

So my wife missed my graduation ceremony in Urbana-Champaign, her flight was cancelled so I had to pick her up in Ohare.

2012-12-31,2.0,"We picked Mercat a la Planxa because we've had pretty good luck with other Iron Chef-owned restaurants.  The reviews were generally good, etc., etc.  We were visiting Chicago for a few days and wanted to plan for a couple of high-end dinners. In general, though, we thought that the tapas delivered by Mercat's Degustación de lujo were mostly flat, safe and/or ordinary and the price was ridiculously high, especially with the wine paring.  We chose the chef's menu because of all the rave reviews we had seen on-line.  Honestly, we didn't even look at the rest of the menu.  I'll come back to this later. Service was attentive, if a little over-the-top with the description of the wines (""little hint of dried peach and chrysanthemum honey..."" really?), until 2/3 of the way through--about the time we ran out of wine--when it turned rather rude. When we were done with the last course, the waiter whooshed by and plopped the desert menus on our table without saying a word. OK, if you don't want details, go down to the the wrap-up. The first course consisted of five dishes, introduced by the waiter as ""strong flavored tapas,"" all paired with a white wine. 1) Tortillas with saffron sauce.  Good taste, could have been stronger on the saffron, but the fact that it was lukewarm was a letdown (you expect food that should be hot to be hot). 2) Cheese with fruit spread and apples.  The cheese was rather ordinary (cabra al vino, similar to a Manchego), and the fruit spread was a pretty good pairing.  Overall-eh. 3) Pan con tomate (bread with tomatoes).  Honestly? This one tasted like the chef poured a can of diced tomatoes on a piece of bread and served it. 4) Jamón Ibérico.  This is supposed to be the very best dried ham in Spain, similar to an Italian prosciutto only drier and more flavorful, and it was good, but ...I'm not sure... I honestly don't think it was real Ibérico. I think they got away with serving regular Serrano ham. 5) Dates wrapped in bacon.  These were pretty good. The white wine that was served with this dish was good.  Light, slightly acidic, smart pairing.  But I was thoroughly disappointed at this point.  I thought we'd see more unique, daring choices. The second course was the best (credit where credit is due) and was served with a fantastic Pinot Noir. 6) Grilled chilies.  Yum. 7) Lamb meatballs.  Double-yum; nice and hot. 8) Rabbit ravioli with truffle sauce.  Very, very good. 9) Mini-pizza with mushrooms.  Given the rest of the dishes in this course, this one was a letdown.  It was just a mini-pizza. The last course started promising, but then woefully fell apart.  It came paired with a pretty average-tasting red wine (don't recall the exact type). 10) Brussels sprouts.  Delicious. 11) Risotto with truffle.  Probably the best risotto I've ever had.  So far so good... but then 12) Spinach.  Ordinary. 13) Colorado Lamb chops.  Ok. 14) Half of a small, grilled lobster.  Looked nice but was -horror of horrors--overcooked. The wine was ok, but the courses took so long we ran out of it before the spinach came out.  So we had to drink water (or purchase more wine) for the rest of the meal.  My sense is that if tapas come paired with wine, there should be enough wine to last the entire course. ""Tapas"" means ""tops"" or ""covers"" and it originated in Spain when they would bring out your beer with plates covering the mugs with little bite-sized munchies.  For me, the thrill of tapas is in a huge way measured by how creatively a chef can serve pretty simple dishes: flash-fried anchovies, braised pig ear cut in slivers, stuffed mini-octopi, shrimp, etc.  Many of the dishes on this chef's menu simply didn't fit the tapas concept. Then I decided to take another look at the menu online (remember that we didn't look at it carefully at the start of our meal).  WHAT?  Turns out they do have exciting, adventurous tapas selections, but none of them made it to the chef's menu.  My suspicion is that most people don't order that stuff, so that's why the chef's menu is made up exclusively of the bland-palate selections.  What gets me is that the waiter asked us whether we had any special requests, food allergies or phobias, etc., and I told him ""no, no phobias of any sort, in fact, the more adventurous, the better!"" and I'm willing to bet we got exactly what everyone else got.  So why ask? I don't like to compare restaurants... too many variables... but in this case I'll say this: fellow-Iron-Chef Mario Batali's Casa Mono in New York City is a FAAAAAAR better place to eat tapas.  Go there and spend your heart out.  You won't be sorry. I'll wrap it up by saying that when the bill arrived I was pretty bummed.  The whole thing cost $340; no extras, except for a  1/2 of a pour my wife had of the white wine during the first course, and a tip.  I expected to pay that much.  But I also expected a LOT more quality, variety, courage to serve off-the-wall selection, and--especially with the wine--quantity.",0.999,0.786,0.166,0.047,0.5507181510721332

2012-12-28,5.0,"A foodie friend drove me from the southern suburbs to experience one of the most creative brunches in Chicagoland.  She was spot-on. Located in the Blackstone Hotel, Mercat has an ever-changing three course tasting menu that also includes unlimited trips to the cheese (manchego) and meat (chorizo - some of the best) and dessert stations.  At $25 bucks this is a bargain in quality and quantity. The servers understand the elegance of allowing conversations to continue while timing the presentation of the next course.  Directly before our trip to the cheese/meat bar, we passed by a drink station that offered either virgin or alcoholic versions of Catalan-inspired bloody Marys, which one could dress with an inspirational number of ingredients lined along the bar.   Cornichons with the Mary?  How could I resist.  As we slowly completed our manchego app, the server was attentive but not hovering.  Our plates cleared, the bacon wrapped dates stuffed with almonds and finished with a special sauce had my eyes rolling to the back of my head.  Am I in heaven? I wondered.  The second half of the first course consisted of minipancakes with nutella, toasted banana marshmallow and rosemary caramel.  The addition of the rosemary to the caramel gave me pause, so I had to try the strange combo.  It worked (this coming from someone with no discernable sweet tooth). Next the Mercat Eggs Benedict arrived with a perfectly poached egg complemented by a perfect truffled hollandaise and brioche.  Was I in France, Spain, or Chicago? The second half of the second course consisted of flash fried peppers with an almond x--- sauce.  Those things nearly drove me home to grill some on my own -- but I do not know what kind of peppers they were.  They must have been imported because I have not known the delicate yet lingering taste before.   GIVE ME MORE was my thought.  I am glad I had room for the final two third courses. Suckling pig melted in my mouth. Is there nothing in life my porcine friends cannot fix?   To end with seared brussel sprouts w/cranberry, walnut and French feta could be mundane if not executed with such care.   The dessert bar was the only disappointment.  This selection was mundane, and the nibbles were not worth the calories. Speciality drinks were offered for a mere $5 and appeared to be generously poured.   We left sated but not stuffed.  It is a wonder to experience an excellent tasting menu that did not have me wondering where the nearest fast food chain was, so I could actually have food instead of snotty snacks.   Bravo!

Also, we ordered first two apps and the first came after 20 minutes, we ate it quickly because we were starving, after another 20 minutes the server came over and barked (he barked regularly) ""ANY QUESTIONS!!"" - um, yeah, where is our next appetizer?  half hearted apology and another 15 minutes the next app comes out.  6 apps later, $250 out the door, we were still hungry and went to Atwood Cafe for a couple appetizers that filled us up, with outstanding service.   The service at Mercat seemed forced, like they were told to ACT like they care, flashing fraudulent smiles while contempt dripped off their saber tooths. Really, like we should feel lucky to be there.  I don't mind paying big bucks for an outstanding meal with outstanding service and ambience, but Mercat failed at all three, and now for the second time we left still hungry and very disappointed.  The cabbie was cracking up while driving us home as well complained of being raped by Mercat. I give it two stars because some of the food was tasty, but way over priced, too small portions, and the service sucked twat.",0.4688,0.706,0.152,0.142,0.39833990795529256

I didn't have time to sample a whole meal of tapas, but I did have the arroz a la cazuela (saffron scented chicken broth with lobster, rabbit, chicken, chorizo, shaved artichoke salad, and piquillo aioli. My Argentinian friend complained that it wasn't authentic because it came in a bowl, not a cazuela, but these American eyes and taste buds were in no way put off. It was, simply put, the most extraordinary thing I've ever seen happen to chicken soup. The colors were so beautiful, too; it was really a feast for the eyes as much as for the palate. It came with fresh focaccia topped with a tomato bruschetta (those are Italian terms, I know, but I don't know the right Spanish ones for them). Overall, it was a perfect light supper.  I think my favorite thing about this place is its spectacular cocktails menu. I had the sangria flight, which was three half-glasses of seasonal sangrias: a white with apple and pear; a rosé with orange and cranberry (best sangria I've ever had); and a red with apple, orange, and cinnamon. All were delicious. I came back another evening with a friend and we tried a few of their other house cocktails. All were creative and delicious.  Mercat's a bit more expensive than I usually go on a business trip, but I'm really glad I went. It would be a great place for an intimate date.

2012-11-25,3.0,"Located inside the Blackstone hotel, Mercat a la Planxa is a Jose Garces tapas restaurant.  The restaurant is located on the second level with soaring ceilings and a view of the Lakeshore Drive (no water).   Service: Service was pretty standard for what you'd expect at a restaurant of this caliber.  People were friendly.  When our server was taking my order, I told him that I had a couple of dietary restrictions.  He noted them, but the kitchen must have forgotten about it.  As a result, I was brought out an ""entree"" or second course of a dish that I wouldn't have eaten.  As we were about to pay for our dinner, our server brought out another dish and apologized for the oversight.  I thought that was really nice.  Food:  I think the food is why the restaurant deserves a solid 3 to 3.5 stars.  The food was okay.  Nothing spectacular.  I'd say good but not mind blowing.  We ordered the $35 chef's choice, ""la mesa de Jose,"" and the $18 express meal.  The chef's choice came with an assortment of food based on obviously, the chef's choice.  The $18 express meal allowed us to pick one first course and one second course, along with a soda.  We chose the Spanish omelette and the burger.   TRUITA DE PATATA CON ESPINACAS: The omelette was what you'd find at any other restaurant except they have this ginormous hunk of cheesy aioli on top.  It tasted fine.   THE MERCAT BURGER: This burger had some sweetness to it.  Comes with PATATAS FRITAS, basically fries with a bunch of seasoning to it.  La Mesa De Jose Dishes: I must admit, I wasn't expecting hefty portions.  And I don't know what the normal portion size for a lot of dishes are.  However, we were given 1/4 of a slice of the Truita de patata.  I don't know if everything else was just 1/4 of the normal portion size, but just FYI.  But I think we had quite a few dishes so I guess it's a pretty reasonable thing to do. ARROZ A LA CAZUELA: The soup was good.  I especially like the broth.  You get a shrimp sliced in half in this meal along with chorizo. SERRANO HAM & FIG SALAD: The salad was pretty decent.  I liked the dried figs where the sweetness contrasts with the saltiness of the ham.  It's a hard dish to mess up and it was alright. PIMIENTOS DE PADRÓN: These peppers were fried but not too greasy.  Came with more aioli than we could eat, but that's fine. MIXTO CROQUETAS: This was decent.  But again, portion size was tiny.  I think it was 2 croquetas that were the size of the thumb of a child. VIEIRES I ALBERGÍNIA: This was one of our second courses.  It was a single scallop that had been pan seared on top and bottom.  Then they sliced the said scallop in two and put the two halves on a skewer.  Felt a little cheap, honestly. ESPINACAS A LA CATALANA:  This was my veggie dish.  It was good.  The apples were supposed to be sliced into tiny matchstick slices but some weren't sliced all the way through, so you had hunks of apples.  But I didn't mind too much. SHRIMP (not seen on menu): I got this shrimp dish way later.  It was well cooked.   I think overall, the food was decent.  Nothing was bad.  It was all good but just not super delicious or great.  Maybe my expectations were a bit too high for this place.",0.9958,0.83,0.135,0.035,0.5098015873015873

Now, had all this came under $100...I may cut them some slack.  But this was one of the most expensive and just not very good food, I've had in Chicago.  Worst part...we left hungry!  I am not even going to go there on the service, but that also sucked.  Impossible to get a drink, our plates were never cleared once another dish was brought so we just had stacks of dirty dishes sitting in front of us....Oh wait, I went there.  Not sure why there are so many good reviews other than maybe for ambiance?  Though I am not big on tapas places either, so I can chalk this up as just another tapas restaurant I'd wish I never wasted money on.",0.9617,0.745,0.143,0.112,0.6020162174008329

I felt like I was part of their birthday celebration - they even asked me if I wanted to share some of their tapas....ok, that is way too close!

I highly recommend this. Short ribs with scallops - YUM! it was so so wonderful. I had something for dessert and it was quite good - some chocolate and apricot thing. Now, back to bread. The first round that I got had clearly just been baked. It had just the right balance of crisp and warm, topped by a cool topping. So good that I wanted more - everything here is small servings and the bread was not different - I got two small slices. When I asked the bus boy (oh, more on him later!) for ""more bread"" sometime later someone brought me one small slice - this one was not as warm and crispy. So then, I asked ""can I please have more bread?""and they brought me one small slice. Why is something so delicious so rationed? The 3rd slice was not warm, not crispy, and not worth eating more. The bus boy. There was something not quite right about him. No eye contact, by the time I could thank him for refilling my water, he was gone, by the time I could ask him for something, he was  gone.my  empty soup bowl was lingering too long.

Our appetizers were both excellent: the watermelon-tomato gazpacho was perfectly spiced and perfectly creamy and the goat cheese- and crab salad-topped toast was a fantastic addition to it. My husband loved the spinach, serrano and fig salad- it also had spiced, slivered almonds and some crumbled Spanish cheese and was dressed with a lovely sherry vinaigrette. For our mains, I opted for the free-range chicken grilled with two sauces and rosemary white beans.

We had (roughly in order): sliced cured ham, olives, chorizo, monte enebro cheese,  blood sausage, butternut squash dumplings,  mushroom flatbread, jumbo prawns, Catalan spinach, spicy potatoes, lamb, and rib eye. The portions were sizeable, especially the cured ham, which we were still poking at half-way through the meal. The chorizo and blood sausage were superb, slightly crispy, salty, but not too greasy. The spicy potatoes were molded like tater tots with a spicy dollop of sauce on top. They tasted like they were fried in bacon fat and were excellent. The spinach was surprisingly good and very flavorful. The lamb was transcendent and melted in your mouth. We got there early (~5:30) on a Friday night and the service was excellent. By the time we left two hours later the place was packed. Overall, the quality of the food we had was very good, though the prices were steep. They do have more than a few unique dishes on the menu that do not seem to be typically offered at other tapas restaurants.

If you have a problem paying a premium for a smaller portions of amazing quality food then this isn't your place. I had the luxury of a business travel expense account which softened the blow.  I ate at the bar two nights in a row and food price and size concerns aside, they have a kick ass bartender named Bobby who not only knows his stuff about the menu (everything he recommended was amazing), but made me a handful of drinks that were so far off the wall that I can't even remember what was in half of them. One had egg whites in it and was out of this freaking world.

The selection on the menu is impressive, and the dishes all SOUND appealing.  We appreciated being able to split Mercat's gazpacho interpretation, made with golden tomatoes and enriched with a bit of crab and caviar.  The briny flavor of the crab was lost a bit in the tomato base, though the contrast in textures was appealing. Grilled jumbo prawns arrived with their heads on - supposedly an indication of freshness - but several tasted heavily of iodine and one was so bad I had to discretely dispose of it in my napkin - too horrid to swallow. Grilled octopus was better, nicely charred and flavorful, if nothing special.  The best dish of the evening was the cauliflower, with the pairing of currants and cauliflower complementing both.  Flash-fried piquillo peppers with an almond dip sounded good, but the dip was a boring brown with no discernible almond flavor and the piquillos had no heat, just a vague herbaceous flavor tinged with oil. Tasting plate of 3 ice creams looked pretty, but none of the ice creams packed a punch, even on a hot late summer night.   Service was fine, if a bit ""bossy"", but none of the individual dishes stood out enough to make me want a repeat.  There are lots of other great restaurants in Chicago, so I doubt I'd come back here again.  It was just ... boring and bland.",-0.8041,0.775,0.102,0.123,0.5794217687074829

I have an allergy (""intolerance"") to onions and therefore called ahead to order paella the day before. We began with tapas and the flights of sangria. The flights sampler of sangria was totally worth the $13. The cheese and meat platters--- meh. The meat sampler has a good quantity, but the slices of cheese were small. The sauces they come with are fun, but nothing to rave over. Heirloom tomato salad with feta was yummy-- good for sharing. Then comes the paella. The nice thing is that they give you a time it will come out, so you can pace your tapas eating accordingly. However, it had onion!! Ugh. The waitress told us ""so sorry--- I got the message about the paella, but there was no mention of onion."" Hmm, ok... She said she would check in the kitchen for an alternative, and said that this ""never, ever, ever happens"" but they will make an exception and make me a small paella. She promised it would be quick, so I agreed.  Here comes the baby paella-- super, it looks DELICIOUS. I dived in with a big woo hoo--- sausage, crispy rice, fresh tomatoes, a crapload of parsley (wtf?), and... ONION! Seriously?? She confirmed with the kitchen. ""The chef cleared it, but the message didn't get to the cook..."" How big is this kitchen?!!? They said they'd make another. My friends were already done with their food, and my meter was about up. I was embarrassed that this had to turn into an ordeal. I said I didn't need anything else and I just needed to leave.  The manager came over to apologize, and brought lamb ravioli. That was nice, since I didn't order it. But I didn't like it (mooshy gravy/stew-like sauce, but great pasta), and again was just embarrassed that this was holding up our check. They also brought out comp'ed dessert. 4 pieces of chocolate covered cinnamon ice cream over a rice krispie. They were good, but awkward to eat-- too big to be bite sized, but not easy to bite into. Luckily the check came afterward, so no one was looking at eachother eat... we were busy bulking at the check. I am REALLY REALLY sad that I couldn't eat the paella. And I spent $50 walking away hungry. Luckily I didn't get sick from the onion (it -can- get pretty bad...). I'm used to orders getting screwed up, but I expect more of place like Mercat.

I met my cousin and his gf there for a 5:30 dinner. They had already ordered red sangria, so I had some. Far from the cloying hot mess that sangria is, with generic fruit bits and cheap brandy throughout, this truly tasted like red wine. So far, so good! Almost everything you can order here is tasty - at least everything we ordered was! I like how this restaurant has so many options, too. The ONE negative thing is that the portions are tiny and the prices are sky-high. That much makes the restaurant very much a NOT everyday sort of place. Still, I think the flavors are so good that it's worth it every so often. Helpfully, the service is relaxed and friendly. Our waiter and my cousin had a nice time chatting about scotch. The presentation itself is fantastic, but even the presentation doesn't match the sheer quality and taste of the ingredients themselves. Perhaps the best example is the side of mushrooms - we ordered two in total. My cousin's gf and I thought, ""These look and smell good. I bet we will enjoy them."" Then we ate them. The intense flavor of the wood-roasted, garlicky (but not overly so) mushrooms - with bits of eggplant and potato chunks - were beyond our expectations. Our cousin wondered if they could be that good. Then he ate them, and you could tell that he agreed. The sizzling gambas al ajilo were perfectly executed, and I'm still drooling thinking about the oil and garlic in which they were cooked. The potatoes are a tiny portion, well plated to boot. Their smokiness is almost overwhelmingly intense! The pork belly was also great - not too fatty, with a nice, light sauce that balanced the dish. The croquetas were smoky and intensely flavorful, too. I am forgetting what other dishes we had, but they were outstanding. I've had good tapas before.

We were able to arrange breakfast deliveries to our hotel room. Being woken up by Mercat's Blackstone Eggs Benedict was like heaven. The meal consisted of tender chorizo and perfectly poached eggs in a savory, creamy sauce. The toasted brioche soaked up all the deliciousness. The crispy breakfast potatoes were fabulous too. This was one of the best, if not the best eggs benedict dish I have had. For my 3rd Mercat breakfast, this time at the actual, beautifully-decorated restaurant, I decided to try something different.: steak and poached eggs ( s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com… ). The steak was definitely tasty though it could have used some sauce or extra flavor to give it some oomph. I thought it was weird that they didn't have steak sauce. They ran out of biscuits, so I had the delicious brioche again. The sauce for this dish was again, absolutely delicious.

If I pay $20 for a dish, it shouldn't be three bites worth. The drinks were excellent, so no complaint there. The service was terrible. The first three dishes came fast, almost too close together. However, then we had to wait 30 minutes or longer for the last dish. When we asked the waiter if it was still coming he responded, ""It will come when it comes."" If you're looking for a fun, upscale experience, skip the high prices of Mercat and go to Nacionale 27 instead. -------- A year later, and the management never followed up on my poor review and experience. I expect a restaurant that charges upward of $80/person to follow-up on a disappointing experience.

First of all, our waiter didn't seem to listen to us.  We asked for iced tea with a little bit of ice (actually I said ""two"" ice cubes because I know it might be difficult for people to judge what is ""little"") but apparently he was not listening and still gave me a lot of ice in my iced tea.  Then, at the end of the meal, we asked for a small glass of warm water to take my medicine with (something needs to dissolve in water), and I got a glass of room temperature water.  I returned the water, then when he brought us new hotter water, it was in one big mug.  My husband decided that we would just pour water out of a glass and measure the right amount of water that I needed instead of asking him to do it. If the food was great, perhaps we could still be happy with the overall experience, but they were just OK.  We both ordered the ""Catalan Express"" ($18), which is a glass of iced tea or soda, then two courses.  Both my husband's serrano ham salad and my chicken and shrimp soup could have been good, but they were both over salted which killed a lot of flavors.  Then our entrees came.  His was a very small portion of fish fillet (I wanted to say maybe the size of my palm, pretty thin) and mine was two scallop skewers (4 scallops total, but you could tell the scallops were sliced in half to create the skewers).  The flavors were fine, but neither of us were satisfied.  I would not recommend coming to this restaurant.",0.9747,0.858,0.105,0.037,0.5396521335807049

And the price was well worth it for the flavors.. okay, now to my review: Yesterday my boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place because we needed something to eat while we waited for someone in the JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge to be done. We were trying to choose between tapas and sushi, and boy am I so glad we chose tapas. When we entered, after walking up the stairs, we were astounded with the interior of the restaurant. With it's high ceilings, unique lighting and modern decor, I was already happy with our choice. As for what we ordered, the only thing I wasn't 100% happy with was the Red Sangria, mainly because I figured it would be sweet like it usually is, but I've noticed that city drinks are just stronger. I later tried the (and yes, I'm just copy and pasting the names from the menu online) CHARRED PINEAPPLE MOJITO, which was fantastic. It was almost like a pineapple version of a Mike's Hard, haha. But it satisfied my sweet craving. For food, we ordered: TRUITA DE PATATA which was just what I had been craving. I would definitely order this again. The flavors were fantastic! PULPO CON PATATAS which was great! I had never had octopus before so I have nothing to compare it to, but flavor was very unique and the meat was very tender.  GUATLA ANEC UVAS Y POLENTA which was quite delicious! The roasted grape glaze on the quail was to die for. But my favorite thing on this plate had to be the goat cheese polenta croquettes. That cheese was to die for! I definitely want to sample their cheeses next time.  TOCINO CON CIDRA which was the best thing out of the entire meal. It was to die for!  If you're looking for something fantastic, get this! Combining all the ingredients on the plate has got to be one of the best flavors I've ever experienced. For dessert we ordered: ""CREMACATALANA"" which has the be one of the best desserts I've ever had! That sweet potato ice cream is amazing! And the combination with the bavarois... YUM! PASTISSOSD'AVELLANA which I didn't care too much for, but that's because I didn't want it in the first place. My boyfriend really enjoyed it though if that's your cup of tea! c: And to top it off, our server was amazing. She was very knowledgeable of everything on the menu and she was of great help when it came to deciding on what we wanted and selling us more food/drinks. I wish I remembered her name though.

2012-05-05,2.0,"This review boils down to a couple of low points that unfortunately took away from what could have been a really nice dinner out.   1) Hostess and Seating: We were a party of two with a reservation and yet had to wait a half an hour for our table.  Once it was time to seat us, the hostess came out to the pool table in the Blackstone (that was nice) and said our table was ready....but, then it wasn't again... a very ""oops, just kidding"" moment, followed by some sort-of-awkward standing around in front of the hostess booth time.  In a nice restaurant--as suggested by the prices, the celeb chef and the ""buzz"" --hostesses (once upon a time, I used to be one) should seat people who have reservations promptly, or quote an appropriate time that they will have to wait, do all of this while being accommodating, and actually HAVE a table when they retrieve the guests.  Also, If you sit by the window in Mercat a la Planxa, it is freezing.  Like, put-your-jacket-back-on freezing. 2) Waitstaff: There are so many of you!  But they breezed past our table with 1/2 second mumblings about what they were serving. This is ""foodie"" stuff!  And as the selections came off of a tasting menu, I was curious about the dishes.  That extra moment it takes to describe--briefly, I know you're busy-- what I'm eating makes the experience much more rich and enjoyable.  Besides, I want to know if you've given me horseradish cream or a butter sauce; there's a huge difference in flavor. 3) Food:  It was nice, some of it outstanding, and delivered at varying temperatures, some of it much too cold.  I wondered, if I can see the kitchen from here, why are my shrimps cold?  The spinach dish is unbelievable.  I could have eaten a pound of it. Everything else was nice...Alas, those low points sure were lame.  The Gilt City deal made it a nice experience, albeit one that I am unlikely to repeat.",0.9812,0.847,0.118,0.035,0.6151433691756272

The server immediately tried to steer us away from the RW menu and pushed their higher-priced tasting menu on us. We had to specifically ask to see the RW menu and he begrudgingly brought one, claiming that the portions were significantly smaller and that we would need to supplement other courses from the regular menu or we would leave hungry. We went ahead with the RW menu anyways (it's why we came, after all) and added a few side dishes. The couple next to us was persuaded to order completely a la carte, and chose several of the same dishes that were included on the RW menu. When the food came out, the portions were identical! Waiters brought out the same food for both tables and there was absolutely no difference. With the extra courses that we ordered at the insistence of our waiter, we ended up with way too much food. We felt totally ripped off in the end. Combined with the inflated drink prices, it was way more than we intended to spend and we couldn't even finish our food. I don't understand why Mercat participates in Restaurant Week if they aren't willing to embrace the basic principle of it. Additionally, the service suffered throughout dinner service.

Went for a late lunch over the weekend and were one of 4-5 tables filled (out of idk 30+) -- the menu looked limited at first -- perhaps 7 starters and 7 mains -- but everything we had was delicious. The turnip soup (sans serrano) was creamy and soul-lifting, and my avo, asparagus, and green bean salad was crisp and tasty -- each ingredient in every dish served a purpose. Oh, and the side of catalan spinach w/ pine nuts and currants was tassssssty. Scallops were nice, but only 4 per serving. A lady with my lust for these creatures needs at least 8, please chef Garces, please.  They have a lunch deal, $18 for 2 courses or $35 for 3 -- I didn't look at the dessert menu, so I can't judge the worthiness of that option, but for 2 courses of this quality for $18, I'd go back any day for a quick lunch.

While it may not be my absolute favorite Catalonian spot in the city I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone in the loop or south loop area.   When my mother visits she often stays at the Blackstone, the hotel which Mercat is attached to, so the restaurant is an easy jaunt from her room after checking in.  I can say I've had most everything on the menu and you really can't go wrong with any dish you choose but I would highly recommend the scallops and the quail. Seriously delicious.  The sangria is good but I'm an after dinner drink kind of girl and love that they serve absinthe in the correct fashion.   Every now and then they have brunch for $35 per person for a three course pre fixe menu which I think is a pretty great deal. Add an additional $8 and you get bottomless mimosas and bloody mary's - which you can make yourself if you'd like at the bloody mary bar, which has allllllll the fixin's you could possibly imagine.   All in all this really is a great place and a wonderful choice is your looking for authentic Spanish cuisine.",0.9887,0.754,0.19,0.056,0.7725396825396826

While we waited to be seated, we ordered drinks at the bar. If you check in on foursquare there is a $1.99 sangria deal! When we were seated we received the pan con tomate, which really reminded me of when I lived in Spain. Just a simple piece of garlic toast with tomato. Delicious. We then received a beautiful bowl of Spanish olives, some Spanish salami and a cheese plate. The salami portion was huge and the flavor was insanely good. My favorite part was the cheese selection with apples and a burnt caramel sauce of sorts. The meal was off to a great start. We continued with our 2nd course, which was a selection of tapas. My favorites were the bacon wrapped dates stuffed with almonds. They were rich-almost could have been a dessert. The ravioli stuffed with butternut squash and lamb were also very tasty.The gambas al ajillo were done very well, as they were a dish I would often order while living in Spain. Moving to the 3rd course, I really liked the jumbo prawns with their heads still on. There were only 2 of them to share, but their flavor was incredible. The rib eye was a little tough for my liking and my boyfriend's pieces were full of gritty fat. The spinach with currants was also decent, but was missing something. Seeing as I was already pretty full, I was ok not loving our 3rd course as much as the 1st and 2nd. Dessert were small chocolate croquetas that were served with a rosemary caramel and banana marshmallow. I thought these were the perfect mini dessert. They weren't too sweet and the portion was great after such a large meal.  I enjoyed my time at Mercat. The decor is great and the dishes come out at a reasonable pace.

If there was a 4.5 option, that's what I would give vs. the 4 or 5-star review. Ambiance, I'd give an 8 out of 10.  I was cold (temperature in the restaurant, sitting by the window), but I really liked all of the rustic touches and warm colors. I deducted a point for the bathrooms - not super-clean and not that great, compared to the rest of the restaurant. Service, I'd give an 9. They were attentive, but the descriptions of what we were eating were delivered a little too quickly. Would have liked to hear a little more about what we were eating. Food was amazing - 8 out of 10.  [First Course] Chef's selection of charcuterie, cheese and olives. - Very straight-forward, very good. [Second course] Short ribs with horseradish, parmesan and bacon flatbread - This was to-die-for. I would go back just for this dish. Unlike the other reviewer, I found there to be a hint of horseradish - it was not at all overwhelming. It was a great complement to the savory short ribs. Rich and delicious. Bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with almond - This just proves that everything is better with cheese. The best bacon-wrapped dates I've ever had. My boyfriend said he didn't like bacon-wrapped dates and quickly changed his tune. Butternut squash dumplings with lamb ragout, beech mushrooms escabeche and black truffles. - Nice mix of flavors, but you have to love butternut squash. Not a fave, but worth trying. Gambas al Ajillo - Garlic shrimp. Good, but expected and... too much salt.  [Third course] black angus rib-eye - Good, but It's rib-eye. Perfectly cooked, but could have trimmed the fat. I liked the sauces in the order they were served - chili sauce was great, green sauce was good, mayo-based sauce was forgettable. jumbo prawns with lemon and garlic - A little fishy, salty and not cleaned properly.  Average. Catalan spinach, currants, pine nuts and apples. - Fantastic! A highlight. Spicy potatoes with spicy paprika aioli - Not my favorite. The middle was scalding hot. The sauce was just so-so. Needs more heat. [Dessert] Milk chocolate croquettes with banana marshmallow, rosemary caramel and arbequina olive oil - This is a must try, Seriously. I thought the banana marshmallow sounded gross, but it was sooooooooo good. Yum. [Drinks] We had the seasonal sangria. It was light and refreshing.

2012-03-24,3.0,"I don't think there is any city in the US that can compare with Chicago on the concentration of tapas-style restaurant.   Mercat a la Planxa is one of the last Chicago restaurants I visited before relocating out of the mid-west.  I made the mistake of reading the dinner menu before heading out there for lunch, so I was a little disappointed with the offerings.  However, the chef was kind enough to let us order a few items off the dinner menu.  The waiter was also very patient.  He went back to the kitchen a few times to check with the chef on our special requests.  They deserve extra points on the service front. The dishes we ordered off the dinner menu are Jamon iberico, and bacon wrapped dates.  The Jamon iberico didn't quite measure up against my experience at De Rosa in Paris, but it certainly had the hint of fruitiness.  The bacon was overcooked and slightly burnt on the dates.  There seems to be a debate on whether the bacon wrapped dates here are better or worse than the chorizo stuffed dates from AVEC.  For me, the AVEC version is still the winner hands down.  I wouldn't mind coming back for dinner, but the lunch items we ordered weren't too impressive.  Well, the black angus hanger steak wasn't too bad.",0.8082,0.856,0.085,0.058,0.40575396825396826

We arrived at exactly 10:00 only to be told that due to some ""issues"" in the kitchen, brunch would be delayed and we could come back in 30 minutes if we'd like.  We were determined to eat here so we asked if they would give us some coffee and let us wait in the bar.  The hostess was very sweet and apologetic about the delay, so the wait wasn't as annoying as it could have been.  We sipped coffee and waited to be seated. Half an hour later we were seated and greeted by our server.  We were told that pastries, cheese, meat, and some suckling pig were available at a buffet we could help ourselves to and the other items (7 tapas) would be served from the kitchen.  We wondered to the buffet only to discover that nothing was set up on it yet but some dessert items.  Not meat, cheese, or pig.  Why did they seat us if the food wasn't ready?  We were perfectly comfortable waiting, sipping coffee.  And also why did out server not inform us the buffet wasn't set up yet?  Eventually it did all come out and the pig was to die for.  The other items were okay too but half of them were lacking serving utensils.  Anyway, back to the tapas. 1. Spanish omelet - this came out first but was cold.  Not a good start to the meal 2. fried peppers - Amazing and made up for the cold omelet.  They were perfectly seasoned.  3. Bacon wrapped dates - the most amazing thing I have ever eaten 4. Shrimp and grits with short rib - AWEFUL!!!!! The grits were lumpy, the shrimp bland, and word of all the short rib on my plate was a wad of slimy fat.  I wanted to spit the meat out so badly but i didn't want to embarrass my mom.  Worst of all I couldn't get the awful taste out of my mouth.  My mom's short rib meat was much better. 5. Chorizo - Amazing. 6. Egg with veggies - Yummy.  especially the little onions 7. Blueberry pancakes - my mom's favorite.  Yummy, fluffy, and not overly sweet.  Overall the food was great.  Some items were disappointing but most were great.  I could eat the suckling pig and dates every day.  If I ever saw the shrimp and grits again though I would run away screaming.  One other little pet peeve was that our water glasses were empty rather often.  I would like to try this place again, but definitely not for brunch.",0.9969,0.757,0.179,0.064,0.5681244778613199
2012-03-18,3.0,"This was my second visit to Mercat and I think my first was a bit better. The first time I had gone, I think my experience was better because I had a bigger budget to play with. My fiance and I were able to try ANYTHING we wanted- the second time, I went with a gal pal and we didn't have as much to spend- so we picked quite a few of the ""traditional"" tapas that were a little less expensive and fancy, and unfortunately, they tasted that way. The best things about BOTH meals- the bacon wrapped dates must be had, the complimentary brushetta (super moist) and the platter of 3 meats- all very good. For the rest of the small plates, I didn't find the portions matching up to the price. I will pay good money for good food, but most of the entrees were just- maybe a 7 out of 10, and probably $3-$5 more per plate than I considered fair for the plates. I will say that if you do have the ability to spend the extra money, the ""fancier"" plates definitely give you a better bang for your buck, taste wise.

2012-03-13,2.0,"OVERALL: We bought a Gilt Deal for this place ($100 for 2 people) and we were really excited to eat here as its only a couple of blocks from our apartment.  We were so disappointed. Next time, I'll skip Mercat and make the trek to Lincoln Park to go to Ba Ba Ree-Ba or take a cab down the street to Tapas Valencia. It's not even about paying more because we can afford it, it's about this food not even being worth what they are charging.   I don't know what the big deal about this place is.  I found the restaurant's ambiance to be lacking and full of old people and probably mostly tourists. We went on a Saturday night at 730pm so it's not like it was the first service of the night.  I swear the average age of people there was 60+.  It was not a place that I would want to start my night out at like other tapas places.   Out of the 10 plates we tried, I would only order 4 of those again. FAIL.   SERVICE: For a Saturday night, I'm surprised at the poor planning on Mercat's part.  Our server told us right off the bat that he was the bartender and they asked him to fill in for the day so he apologized for his performance in advance and that he may not know all that was on the menu.  Great.   Could have been because he was the bartender, but even so, it does not excuse the fact that we had to have a busboy hunt him down several times to get refills on our drinks.   FOOD: [First Course] Chef's selection of charcuterie, cheese and olives. -nice spread of meats and breads   [Second course] Short ribs with horseradish, parmesan and bacon -these were like little pizzas with the shredded short rib and bacon on top and parmesan/horseradish as the base.  The horseradish was overwhelming.  We picked out the beef and left everything else.   Bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with almond -absolutely delicious.  By far one of the best dishes we tasted throughout the night.   Butternut squash dumplings with lamb ragout, beech mushrooms escabeche and black truffles. -Must try! Im not a fan of lamb as it tastes quite gamey but this was excellent.  Great mix of flavors and the dumplings were creamy with a touch of sweetness.   Spanish octopus, confit potato, smoked paprika -octopus was greasy and chewy.  Also very fishy tasting.  We each ate a piece and left the rest.   [Third course] black angus rib-eye -very fatty pieces.  Not worth the price.   jumbo prawns with lemon and garlic -Disappointed that at a restaurant of this caliber, the prawns weren't even cleaned properly.  I cut the head off and with it came prawn poop.  Gross.   Catalan spinach, currants, pine nuts and apples. -this was really good. spinach was not overcooked and sautéed nicely.   Spicy potatoes with spicy paprika aioli -pretty hard to mess up this dish at any tapas place. nothing exciting.   [Dessert] Milk chocolate croquettes with banana marshmallow, rosemary caramel and arbequina olive oil -by far, one of the best parts of the dinner.   [Drinks] We checked in on foursquare and got a glass of sangria for $1.99. We opted for the white sangria/ pear, peach and rosemary and liked it so much, we got a full pitcher. -definitely could taste the peach schnapps.  And the rosemary was not overpowering.

I see other people were complaining about the service but I did not find this to be much of an issue, although I was there on a Wednesday night.  We were seated right away, waiter was attentive and very knowledgeable.  The only complaints i would have about the service was that the food was slow to come out of the kitchen and the waiter was a little too much of a salesman.

Even on a weeknight, the restaurant was at maximum capacity.  Parched due to the unusual heat wave Chicago was hit with, we ordered the seasonal sangria with rhubarb. The uncommon ingredients married perfectly to create a fresh, fragrant, and chilled cocktail. We simply couldn't get enough of it. Our waiter was professional and polite. One couldn't help over looking his tardiness as the restaurant was super packed and he didn't even have a minute to breathe. Yet, he attended to us with a smile.  Tapas, certainly not what you would expect from your local neighborhood joint in Spain. Chef Garces has taken Tapas to a gourmand level with intrinsically prepared dishes and addition of fusion flavors. The community of Catalonia (north eastern Spain) favors garlic and one can surely taste that influence on the dishes here at Mercat; I for one relish garlic in all forms. In between savoring the rhubarb sangria and catching up with friends, we ordered pintxos muranos, patata bravas, morcilla, flatbread, tocino con cidra, gambas al ajillo, cordero lechalel en curry, pimientos, and cheese selection. Aside from the lamb brochettes (kitchen ran out of), we managed to taste everything else we ordered. They even have Roast Pig on the menu which involves advance ordering. The Patata Bravas were presented unlike any of my previous encounters with this classic dish. Crispy tater tots like potatoes topped were adequately with spicy paprika aioli; we ended up ordering seconds. At times, the description of a certain dish tends to evoke fear or disdain in diners; morcilla, blood sausage falls into that category. However, I for one love them; hence I look forward to the signature touches of the restaurant that are bold enough to offer them.  Mercat a la Planxa, had one of the best I have tasted in my various travels. It even won the vote of my friends who hadn't tasted them before. With the right amount of sweetness combined with the rice, the morcilla melted in my mouth. Nicely done! The Chef's selection of 3 cheeses was a befitting ending to our delicious meal. The generous portions of cheese were accompanied with finger licking dipping sauces; yet another display of the Kitchen's uniqueness.  Mercat a la Planxa seems to serve minuscule portions with higher prices in comparison to average typical tapas fare; however each dish coming out their kitchen is uniquely paired, packed with bold flavors, presented beautifully, and most importantly tasting exquisite. What should have been a casual evening out with friends, turned into a spectacular dining experience commendable of any epicurean's delight.

I suffer from Celiac disease and was astonished by the condescending-- if not downright malicious -- tone the server took with me. I erred on tears. After feeling pressured on our orders, the server took them and went along. He spent significant time dwelling at other tables while ignoring ours; and while I drained my water glass, the server addressed my family member's fuller glasses while I waited a good 15 minutes before he took heed and filled my glass. This isn't even the worst part-- it took him 45 minutes to deliver our lunch and he delivered my lunch last. In most cases a server will generally augment the flaw of bad service with a special consideration towards the table (i.e., wine, dessert) anything to reflect better on him or her... However this waiter was quite arrogant, displaying hazardous traits that guaranteed him a very scarce tip in return for his poor, poor service. My conclusion being: the Mercat a la Planxa hires ageist servers that are insensitive towards the gluten-intolerant/Celiac community and for this reason the service they hire reflect horribly on the restaurant itself, thus giving the restaurant a veneer of pretension that ill-suits it.",-0.6596,0.766,0.11,0.124,0.5765664160401002

The meats are delectable!!  The lamb, what can I say...literally melts in your mouth!  Cannot stop thinking about the lamb!  The best lamb I have ever eaten!  Everything we tasted was recommended by our waiter and he brought us a few other great tasting dishes as well. The only two items that we ordered that I would not order again are the Spanish squid, I like squid but didn't think this was the ""bomb"" and the garlic shrimp, which you can really order anywhere.  I thought both were a little tough too. Drinks, well they were very expensive!  Holy cow expensive!  I had the charred pineapple mojito which was served in a rocks glass for 13.00!  I had a few and didn't catch a buzz  :(  I would think for the price of some of the drinks they would be a little potent and delicious!! Atmosphere was great!  Dark and modern, very relaxing!  Open kitchen.  You can see the cooks prepare.

Yes, the prices are up there, but it's worth it for the amazing flavor, the attentive service, and the beautiful presentation. On my first trip, my dining companions and I ordered at least 9 different items. Not one of them was remotely disappointing. Many had ingredients that I don't always love (caviar, goat cheese), but they were created in a way that made the flavor combinations meld together in a wonderful cacophany of taste.   My second trip was for a birthday lunch with co-workers and I opted for the restaurant week tasting menu. The turnip cream soup had the perfect amount of earthy root vegetable flavor mixed with cream. The Angus hangar steak was cooked to perfection atop moist, succulent short ribs and a crispy on the outside, extremely tender inside potato croquette. Don't even get me started on the desserts. One large gumball sized, chocolate filled bit of decadence felt like eating an entire candy bar...only way, way better! And unlike other people, our server encouraged us to order the Restaurant Week tasting special. Speaking of server, request Gerald, he was fantastic!",0.9934,0.74,0.224,0.036,0.5973333333333334

Don't get me wrong, the food and service were both great, but I found it to be a bit too similar to Amada for my liking. I guess living in Philly has ruined me, as I rather think of Mercat as a slightly watered-down combination of elements of his other seven restaurants. A Chicagoan would probably never notice.  Despite everything I said above, the restaurant is actually quite good on the whole, just a bit lackluster when compared to the other jewels in the Garces crown. It was the best meal I had in Chicago. Except for the drunk Dominos delivery. That was killer.",0.792,0.713,0.173,0.114,0.5047619047619046
2012-02-25,4.0,"So this is what expensive tapas taste like...and it was so worth it!  I'm so glad to have chosen Mercat for Restaurant Week!  The ambiance and decor of the place was trendy and romantic.  The lighting was just right to set the mood for a nice dinner out with lover and friends.  The food was amazing!  Since there were 4 of us, we decided to have everything Mercat offered on its Restaurant Week menu and shared.  Sharing is caring, and loving every bite was what we did.   In the order of deliciousness (with detailed descriptions of my faves): Patatas a la Riojana: It was all about the sauce. I don't know what else they could have done other than weaving magic into this dish.  The pairing of heirloom baby potatoes and cider braised chorizo was out of this world.  The potatoes were soft and soaked up the sauce really well while the smokiness of the chorizo complemented them perfectly.  But the manchego espuma sauce was bowl-licking good!  Drooling! Serrano Ham and Fig Salad: Fresh with just the right amount salty and nutty. The sherry-shallot vinaigrette laced everything so that every forkful was tasty and tangy but not overwhelming. The serrano ham and fig added character to the dish while the nuts gave it some crunch.   Pelotas de Calabaza y Cordero: Each item by itself would have made this dish ordinary, but together they could conquer even the pickiest eater's tastebuds!  The delicate flavor of the butternut squash dumplings matched with the lamb ragout in the most interesting way. Somehow the squash diluted the ""gaminess"" of the lamb and made it into some sort of awesome.  The beech mushroom escabeche & black truffle rounded out the dish.  Trutia de Patata: Playful square packages of yumliciousness.  These spanish style omelette with spinach, potatoes, and saffron aioli would kick any other square packages and gigantic half-moon shaped omelette's butts.  The pasta-like skin on the outside was al dente while the inside was mashed potato heaven. It's hard to describe the overall flavor profile of this dish.  You just have to try it for yourself.  Too bad it was only one or two bites worth.   Everything else (the flash fried peppers, the serrano ham & chorizo croquettes, the shrimp asiago-esque flatbread, and the goat cheese & grilled sourdough) were excellent as well.   We ended a great meal with Croquetas de Xocolat - small fried balls of milk chocolate on top of sticky marshmallow, caramel, and premium olive oil.",0.9951,0.819,0.157,0.024,0.5976512226512227

The server emphasized how small the portions were. Well, my friend and I DID order from the restaurant week menu, and there was plenty of food for 2 women. In fact we didn't finish the last couple of dishes.  With the 2 of us, and the way the deal works, we had everything on the special menu. So it's a very good deal that they are trying to steer you away from.  So why be part of Restaurant Week if you don't want people to actually take advantage of it? RW gives people a chance to try a new place, and if they like it, they'll be back. So they might lose money in the short run, but will gain new customers in the long run.  I don't know if this practice is coming from the servers or management, but they should really rethink it.

2012-02-20,2.0,"I really don't know how to feel about this start to my restaurant week. Presidents Day off = taking advantage of a stress free Monday by consuming lots of calories. Instead this was a stress filled dining experience.  My friend and I, walked in today at lunch about 12:15pm and were pleasantly surprised to see very few patrons. Not completely empty but not obnoxiously crowded, CHITOWN LUNCH SUCCESS!      We are seated immediately. We chat, scan the menu, chat some more ... Ok where is the waiter? 15 minutes later he rushes to our table, pen and pad in hand, ""What would you like?"" Ummmm...ok. An explanation of your menu would be nice, maybe even a recommendation or two? After prompting, He explained that Mercat's restaurant week menu was the regular Catalan Express menu For $18 (we soon learn there would be nothing express about this meal),  which included one choice from a list of options under 1st course and 2nd course. Dessert could be included for $22. We order a few glasses of wine first and he immediately walks away from the table to put in the drink order. Probably would have been more time efficient to put in everything together, but whatever. At this point we just want to get the ball rolling, it's now 12:35pm. To start, we have the Arroz a la Cazuela (essentially a spicy soup reminiscent of gumbo) and Ensalada Verde (simple salad). Second course, We order the Mercat Burger and Barri Gotic ( hanger steak).      We sip, we chat, we sip some more. It's 12:50pm and still no first course. Ooooooook. We stop a busser and request our waiter. We sip, we chat....we then watch the table next to us receive their 1st course. It's now 1:00pm. But we were seated and ordered before them, what's the issue?!?! We stop another person walking around ""hi, we've been waiting for our food...hmmm... FOREVER, can we speak to our waiter to see what's the hold up?"".  They come back and say it's coming right out and drop complimentary peppers on our table. I don't want your peppers señor, I want WHAT I ORDERED. And I want you to apologize because the reality is, you forgot to enter our order. I'm no fool. Things started picking up a little after we walked in and you were overwhelmed, just say it!!!!      Finally we get our first course: a salad and soup. didn't realize salad and soup took 40  minutes to prepare. Did you pick this fresh from the lettuce farm? Was the soup flown in from some foreign country prior to? So confused. We annihilate the soup and salad. WAITER: ""would you like us to get your 2nd course started""  US: ""Hell Yea?!""      We received our 2nd course shortly thereafter, thank God. It is now 1:40pm. The waiter comes back to the table and asks if we would like to try dessert. I ask if it will take long? He laughs. I straight face him. It takes everything in me not to say, ""I'm f***ing serious, is it going to take you another hour or can you make it quick"". We decide not to risk it, pay immediately and leave. It's now 1:55pm.      I'm not a fan of two hour lunches, servers neglecting tables, and overall ""so-so"" dining experiences. The food was pretty tasty but overshadowed by the service.

It's fairly creative, slightly above average execution and technique- however nothing earth shattering. My gripe is that they dress the food up so much you can't actually taste the food- you mostly taste sauces, my tongue was saturated with salt.

Rather, it was my last meal in my 20s, and since attending the Mercat Yelp event in November, I have been hoping to have a full meal here. Saturday night the nearly four month thought came to fruition.  Our wonderful server, Sally, toured us through the menu, highlighting some of the more popular tapas options there, as well as her personal faves. She didn't lead us astray on anything. My group of 4, shared a very reasonably priced pitcher of white sangria. It was some of the more flavorful sangria I've ever had, with a lovely peach taste to it. Since we were planning on being up in da club after dinner, we stuck to a few light options. Here is the list: chef's cheese selection (very generous portion), Verdosa salad, bacon-wrapped dates with almonds, butternut squash dumplings (which melted in our mouths), and short rib flatbread. I loved that the dates had almonds; it was a nice change to a tapas staple. And the meat on the flatbread was about as tender as it gets.

2011-12-15,4.0,"Another day, another celebrity chef's restaurant. I recently ventured over to Mercat a la Planxa with 3 others for my birthday, so I knew I would have the opportunity to try a lot of food. FOOD: Tomato bread for the table: basically like pico de gallo on top of buttery bread. Delicious and light, only the ends of it seemed to be at all greasy. Great way to start. I loved this so much. Pulpo con patatas: I love mollusks, they taste delicious. This dish had a lot of paprika in it, with some acid from what I would assume is lemon juice, which together combined for great flavor. I don't know if the potatoes really added anything as the dish itself wasn't very strongly flavored, and not at all salty. However, the octopus was awesome, and would strongly recommend this to anyone. Bacon wrapped dates: My friend told me a few different time about these dates - I'm not sure if it was because she didn't remember telling me about them, or if she just loved them so much. Well, it was probably the latter because these things were my favorite dish of the night. It was a classic sweet + savory combination that worked so well. Get these. Truita de patata: I was surprised at how much I liked this dish - very creamy, well seasoned, and not a lot of saltiness. All good things. I'm glad Chef Garces went with a goat cheese for this one - the subtle and soft flavor went really well with the creamy lentils. Albondigas de venera (scallop and shrimp meatballs): Some might not agree with mushing up scallops and shrimp into ball form, but I think it was genius. I like meat balls, I like seafood, I like this dish. Like scallopballs (not to be confused with scallop testes) with chunks of shrimp in it, if that makes sense. Serrano ham and fig salad: an't go to a Spanish restaurant without getting some of that jamon, right? The jamon de Iberico de bellato (or something like that, basically Iberico pork-belly ham) was a bit much on el dinero side, but we got this ham and fig salad based on a recommendation from a friend. Very good, although I didn't taste much fig until I went digging around looking for it. Serrano ham was delicious, albeit extraordinarily salty. I guess I'm more used to the more subtle flavor of proscuitto. Pinxtos muranos (lamb brochettes wrapped in bacon): Well, this was good. But bacon wrapped anything is good. One point here is that I didn't get much of a lamb taste. I hope this wasn't due to being two pitchers of sangria deep, but I felt like the lamb was overpowered by the bacon + sauce. Sauce was sweet btw. Paella valenciana (chicken & chorizo paella w/artichoke and tomato salad): I love paella. I usually like rice dishes. Good flavors (chorizo in here was great), but the chicken was pretty bland on its own. Probably a good thing considering that my salt sensing 'buds were in overdrive. I prefer paella del mar (I think I can speak el espanol, I really can't though), and I actually prefer Cafe Babareeba's paella to this one. However, I (we) was (were) really full at this point, so maybe that impacted what I tasted. DESSERT:  Croquettes de xocolate (chocolate and caramel filled croquettes): So good. Deep fried balls filled with chocolate and caramel? YEA GIMME. Shove one of these with the banana cream into your fat face and wait for a gush of awesomeness and sweetness. There were 6 croquettes and 4 of us, I decided to grab two. Someone else was smart enough to grab the last one. SERVICE:  Fast, friendly, and very helpful with recommendations. They also weren't very intrusive, but were around whenever one of us needed a refill or we needed some more sangria. Our server was also very personable and just fun. VALUE/OVERALL: I think that for a tapas place owned by an Iron Chef, Mercat is a pretty good overall value. It's more expensive than some of the other tapas places in the city, but not by much. Alot of it could be the inherently more expensive ingredients used in Chef Garces' menu. Overall, this was a great dinner. I'll definitely be back, if for nothing else but to get my hands on those dates again.",0.9994,0.781,0.208,0.011,0.5494471196718389

The first experience I had here was during restaurant week in which we did a prix fixe menu and got a wine flight. The service was good, at times a bit slow but again, it was restaurant week at dinner time. The server was great though in ensuring we got what we wanted. the BF doesn't like seafood and they were accommodating to that. One wine really stood out and after asking about it he wrote it down so we could get it ourselves (as we did...on they walk home). I was most impressed with the prosciutto ham fig salad wrap and continue to get it every time I go. Don't miss it!

2011-11-30,2.0,"This place is actually the reason I decided to finally cave in and make a Yelp account.  Let me start off by saying I've worked in the service industry for over ten years and cannot believe that a place like this has such AWFUL service. I have never, ever, complained about a server or bartender, but I actually really wanted to last night.  I dined at the bar last evening and was underwhelmed by my whole experience. The only reason I am even giving this two stars is because of the free flatbread (5 stars) that preceded my meal, which was fantastic.  I ordered the patatas bravas (NOTHING like Las Bravas in Madrid, which has the world's finest) and the slow cooked pork belly (which was good, but super tiny, and nothing to write home about). Upon contemplating ordering another small dish or dessert, I asked the bartender (who didn't smile once in the almost two hours I was at the bar; oh, or ask how anything was) if there was anything that really stood out on the dessert menu that I should consider. Her response? Wait for it.... ""I don't really like dessert, so I don't know.""  Jose Garces, Iron Chef winner, I think you need to give your staff a lesson on customer service. Not only was the bartender uneducated on service (you could've made something up, and I would've never known!) but your hostess stand and service area were continually complaining about tables (they even were talking about asking a table to actually get up because they sat them in the wrong area). Unreal! Needless to say, I won't be back, EVER. And I won't try any of your affiliated restaurants in the Philadelphia area, which I frequent often.",0.9816,0.841,0.122,0.037,0.46666666666666673
2011-11-29,2.0,"We wanted to like to this place, but walking home, my wife and I had trouble figuring out a highlight of the entire dining experience.  We were torn between the server (he really was trying hard), or the apple slices on the cheese plate.  Yes, it was that disappointing.   Where to start.... When responding to my question ""is there a place to check my coat,"" the appropriate response is usually NOT ""no, but I can bunch it up and put it behind the hostess stand.""  Seriously?  Is this Chicago?  Are the temps cold in the winter?  Is this restaurant in one of the nicer hotels on Michigan Ave.?  There was no chance I wanted our coats bunched up like that, so I opted to keep them, a decision I would soon regret.    Good grief, could you be sitting any closer to the table next to you?  How many people are you trying to cram in the restaurant?  It was virtually impossible for anyone to enter the booth areas without completely disrupting the dining experience of the adjacent tables.  The waiter had to stand behind the table and shout across to the people in the booths because there was no room.  Oh, and those jackets that everyone had with them because they could not check them, where do you think they ended up?  On the floor, on the dinners next to them, under butts like a booster seat.....   We went to this restaurant because they advertise ""Iron Chef Mondays"" on the website.  It's still listed there as a type this. This special offers the tasting menu for $35.  Well according to our waiter, ""we haven't done that in a while (while laughing).""  Well, then take it off your website!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't imagine we were the only people there interested in that. The waiter was selling us on the tasting menus, so we obliged and got the wine pairing for each (1 basic and 1 ""premium"" tasting menu).  Unfortunately, the ""chef won't mix the normal and premium tasting menus at the same table.""  Not sure why.  If I was dining alone could I still order a single tasting menu?  If the answer is yes, you can mix and match the two tasting menus at a table with multiple people.  Are all the single diners in the restaurant on the night we were there not permitted to order off the tasting menu?  There were the same amount of courses on each tasting, so it's a bit perplexing.   The quality of the food was, at best, average.  While appealing to the eye, the taste was just not there.  Many of the initial tapas dishes were loaded up with way too much bread and lacked any remarkable flavor.  It wasn't by any means disgusting, it just wasn't very good.  The two better items on the menu were the short rib flatbread and the garlic shrimp.  Hindsight, I'd probably get those as my meal if I went back. Overall, for nearly $250 (two basic tastings, basic wine pairing, tax, and tip) it was not worth it.  There are many other tapas places in town that are just as a good (if not better) for a fraction of the price.  Hindsight, I should have used the $1.99 Sangria special after checking in on FourSqaure (unless they haven't done that in a while).",0.9689,0.821,0.105,0.074,0.4287481281820905

Once we were in the restaurant, we liked the airy look and feel of the place.  We had a great table and started with the Roasted Suckling pig buffet, yes and yum!  We enjoyed that with cheese plus juice and coffee.  We then had the melon and almond first course, both fabulous.  The second course of shrimp and eggs was even better - best Eggs Benedict of my life.  The third course wasn't my fave but my husband really liked the duck confit croissant french toast and the brussel sprouts.  I made up for it by tasting all the sweets on the buffet and the mini dark chocolate tarts were worth the trip alone. Our waiter was very earnest and we liked the laid back vibe.  Jody Weis came in and no one bothered him at all.  That must be such a relief to him after all the shouting, protesting and picketing he used to get, and that was from the police officers!  Everyone was very cool and interested in their own table companions.

2011-11-13,4.0,"The earliest draft of this post began, ""yumyumyumyumyum."" Perhaps that's all the review we need. The main dining area of Mercat is on the second floor and is bright and colorful, though its most striking feature is how very open it is. There are tall ceilings, a partly-exposed kitchen and a multi-tiered floor with tables of different shapes and sizes. The food menu is expansive with mostly tapas-style dishes, though there are some larger entree-sized options as well. The wine menu was also deep with many Spanish wines by the bottle and a fair number also available by the glass. We settled in with refreshments. A few tried some deep red wines, but the drink of the evening remained that tapas staple, sangria. Mercat offers a few varieties of the traditional red wine type, but we stuck to the lighter and more refreshing white varieties this evening. One version with pears, grapes and rosemary was stellar while another with rhubarb was a bit forgettable. As we sipped, our meal began with bruschetta-like Spanish toast to which we added pimientos de padrón, a serving of flash fried padrón peppers with salbitxada. The toast was tasty, but our pimientos were a bit bland, both in the too simple peppers and the boring sauce. Next came our first batch of tapas plates. The mixto was a particular standout featuring Serrano ham and chorizo croquettes; these incredibly flavorful little bites were gone way too soon. An order of calamari with olives and fennel surprised us -- cornmeal breading! -- and the verdosa ensalada -- baby greens, asparagus, avocado, confit cherry tomatoes and shaved mahon cheese -- was a strikingly simple, but delicious green salad. No good Spanish meal would be complete without paella, however Mercat offers an unusual version sans seafood. This giant platter came with grilled chicken, chorizo and olives and was topped with toast and a saffron aioli. Like all good paella, there was a slight, deeply flavored char in the middle of the rice and the whole giant pan disappeared before we even thought to snap of picture of it. We would it that thing again and again- insanely delicious.  Somehow after all that food, we found the room for dessert and a shared glass of port. A nicely presented thick chocolate cream with hazelnuts and a buttercream ice cream finished the meal off well. As much as we loved the food, we did have some quibbles with the service. Tapas dining involves a lot of plates coming and going and, with so much sharing, spills and dropped bits pile up. Surprisingly, there didn't seem to be anyone tasked with wiping tables or even just keeping the meal orderly. There just seemed to be an overall lack of ""mise en place"" to the whole operation (if we can be a bit liberal with the phrase). Our waiter also seemed to often be disorganized, forgetting one drink order and then getting it wrong after we reminded him. These nit-picks are slight, though. Mercat provided an absolutely delicious meal in a great setting.

2011-11-09,5.0,"""One of the best meals I've ever had in my entire life."" That was what my dining companion said halfway through our meal (even before dessert).   Mercat a la Planxa has been a must-try for me the past two years and I finally found the perfect time to try it out.  We made a 12:15pm reservation for lunch and were seated immediately next to giant window overlooking Michigan Ave.  The dining room has a high ceiling with mirrors on both sides with painted birds on them.  Very decorative and trendy.  The tables near the outside of the restaurant can be close together (probably during busy times the two-tops can be frustratingly close) but for the most part are well spaced out.   Our server was very professional and mentioned he also worked at Smith & Woolsensky's, so you knew he knew his stuff. For lunch, Mercat offers an $18 per person Catalan Lunch, where you choose one item from the list of First Courses and one item from the list of Second Courses. I chose the Serrano Ham & Fig Salad and my companion chose the Pimentos de Padron.  The salad was huge  (check the photo uploaded) and filled with fresh figs, some type of fancy blue cheese, and tossed with a sherry vinaigrette.  Any salad using spinach leaves is always good, and other than maybe a tad too much dressing, this one was great.  The Pimentos de Padron, which were fried pimento peppers, were very tasty and had just the slightest crisp to them and a hint of spice.  The thick specks of sea salt made them eve more enjoyable. For our Second Courses, we chose the Black Angus Hangar Steak and the Vieires i Albergínia (grilled diver scallops).  The steak was ordered medium rare and came out close to rare, but it wasn't a major concern.  The steak came topped with fresh beech mushrooms and was served on a thin layer of short ribs and a thick potato croquette.  The croquette tasted like a fancy hash brown and was perfectly crispy on the outside and moist in the inside.  One of the best dishes I've ever had.  The scallops were flawless as well.  Four giant diver scallops a la planxa (on the grill) were cooked to perfection and almost melted in your mouth.  They are served on two wooden skewers and come with an addicting roasted eggplant puree and a confit of artichokes.  Muy delicioso! All items on the menu can be orded a la carte, so we decided to try a side order of the Setas al Horno (wild mushrooms, potatoes, parsley, and shallots). It was served sizzling hot in a mini black cast iron skillet.  If you order one thing at Mercat a la Planxa, make sure it is these mushrooms. Unbelievable flavor and if this was served in a giant bucket, I would have no problem finishing it. For dessert we ordered both available options: the Pastissos D'avellana (Hazelnut-Mascarpone Gateaux, Apricot, Dulche de Leche, Salted Hazelnuts) and the Croquetas de Xocolata (Milk Chocolate Croquettes, Banana Marshmallow, Rosemary Caramel, Arbequina Olive Oil). I gave the full descriptions because they read exactly as they taste. We destroyed both of them and left no sauce or crumbs on the plate. (check the photos to see how they are composed) I can't wait to return here for dinner one night and try the rest of their items. Do yourself a favor and stop in Mercat a la Palnxa and if you follow my ordering advice, you will not be disappointed.",0.9951,0.858,0.112,0.029,0.5150957854406131

2011-10-22,4.0,"My boyfriend and I came to Mercat a la Planxa as a form of distraction from school. Catalan tapas sound pretty good when you realize mid-quarter that classes are much harder than you expected them to be.  Mercat is on the corner of Balbo and Michigan and conveniently accessible by a ton of buses. The entrance to the restaurant is slightly difficult to find, though. You have to go in The Blackstone, and if you enter on Michigan, pass through the bar and ascend a flight of stairs to the main dining area. The dining room is spacious with tall ceilings and an odd beehive theme. We got there a bit earlier than our reservation but were seated promptly in what I consider the best two-person table in the house, at least for a date.  We each got the Chef's Tasting Menu and he got the pairings as well. The meal is broken up into three courses, with a couple of dishes each. The first course came out all at once. On the house were a big bowl of olives and a plate of light, airy bruschetta. Three different servers brought our dishes: a plate of cured meats accompanied by crisp bread and various pickles; goat's milk cheese with crisp Granny Smith apple slices and a mango chutney; a spinach and potato omelette. It was a good portion of food to start off the meal, and because the rest of the dishes are brought out more leisurely you get full at a slow, happy pace.  The second course began with the bacon-wrapped figs, which are just as divine as everyone says they are. They came out with a plate of butternut squash dumplings accompanied by lamb ragout, beech mushrooms, and truffle which was also wonderful. These are both dishes that I will definitely order a la carte when I go back... probably in multiple portions. We were then served a dish of tender, perfectly cooked shrimp swimming in a garlicky butter sauce. Last was a flatbread of beef shortribs in a sweet barbecue-like sauce with baron, parmesan, and fresh sprigs of arugula.  Intentionally or not, a decent period of time separated our second and third courses. This was probably a good thing, as I was starting to get stuffed after the generally portioned flatbread. Our last course began with two vegetable dishes: patatas bravas i.e. spicy potatoes resembling tater tots with a rich aioli, and Catalan spinich sauteed in vinegar with a salad of thinly shaved apple threads on top. I wasn't crazy about either. I thought the aioli was a bit too mayonnaise-like and excessive. The Spinach dish seemed to have a weird aftertaste, but I usually don't like Spinach all that much anyway. The meal then concluded on a plate of medium-rare steak accompanied by two sauces. The steak was cooked well with a crisp edge, but there were some pieces of gristle that I wasn't too fond of.  We ordered the Croquetas de Xocolata for dessert and wolfed them down immediately. The banana marshmallows tasted like dollops of heavy whipped cream. Overall we left quite happy and full. One of the reasons I decided to come here, actually, was that most reviews seemed to agree that the Chef's tasting menu was a good amount of food. I think it's a good place to start, but I will definitely order a la carte next time I go, especially since the tasting menu doesn't seem to vary much.  I am really not a big fan of Iron Chef America; the Japanese version was overdone in a hilarious way, but there's something about the sanitized and glossy production values of the stateside equivalent that lacks the original's kooky charm. Still, Mercat a la Planxa was pleasant and satisfying. My hats off to Iron Chef Garces.",0.9979,0.814,0.15,0.036,0.47894524959742363

The Arroz a la Cazuela soup was pretty good too.  The Wagyu ""Zabuton"" steak was absolutely delicious. The Conill Amb Castanyes (braised rabbit) was very good.

2011-09-29,4.0,"This was a good place for a small crowd, since it's bustling, right off of Michigan Ave, and consists of small plates (where cost gets diluted if you have larger numbers). We had a party of 5. Unfortunately, since we made a reservation at 8:15 on a Saturday night, we had to wait a bit for our table. The house bread was a delicious parmesan bruschetta which whetted our appetites before the food came. Our selections: Queso mixto - came with a blue cheese, a raw cow cheese, and a sheep's milk cheese (I think) and each one had its own sauce/accompaniment. The cheeses were good, though the amount of bread was pretty minimal. Tocino con cidra (Pork Belly & Granny Smith Apple-Black Truffle Slaw) - very good, decadent. The acidic apple was a nice contrast to the earthy truffle. Mar i Muntanya II (Serrano-Wrapped Yellow Fin Tuna, Potato Croquette, Pickled Red Pearl Onions) - also delicious, especially the onions contrasting with the creamy  potato croquette. Paella Valenciana (Chicken & Chorizo Paella, Artichoke & Tomato Salad with Saffron Aioli) - this was a little disappointing. while the flavor of the paella itself was good, i was hoping for more substance (seafood, meat, whatever). also, olives were included (which i hate) that threw off the flavor of the dish and you could taste it all over the bites that touched an olive. Pelotas de calabaza y cordero (Butternut Squash Dumplings, Lamb Ragout, Beech Mushroom Escabeche, Black Truffle) - this was really delicious, creamy, rich, earthy. unfortunately the order only came with 3 so we had to order 2 more but i definitely recommend it.  All in all, the order came to about $33 per person, which isn't bad for all of us being full and having a good amount of paella left. For the price and location, it's also a good deal.

2011-09-29,4.0,"The only reason I am not going to give Mercat a la Planxa 5 stars is because it is too pricey and the waiters are inconsistent, but this is an amazing place. Let me start out by saying that I love Chef Garces. I've eaten at all of his restaurants including my favorite, Amada in Philadelphia. I ate at Mercat for the first time four years ago when I first moved to Chicago. Garces was not an Iron Chef yet, so the place was less packed than it is now! I still go to Mercat any chance I get. The menu changes twice a year and I prefer the Autumn menu. My favorite things on the menu: the mushroom soup with caviar and crème fraiche, Wagyu beef, patata bravas, and the chocolate croquettas. This places is expensive because the portions are so small you need to order a lot to walk out satisfied and the alcohol is also expensive. I've gone to Mercat several times and the quality of the food never changes. The wait staff however is hit or miss. I've had two bad occasions there, once when the waiter wouldn't leave us alone and was being too pushy and the other time when the waiter mocked me for not knowing that the menu changed when I asked for the soup I loved, he was relentless and brought it up the whole time during dinner. Also, Mercat has a tight seating layout, you sit VERY close to other people, so if you're looking to have a romantic dinner you have to specifically request a table.",0.9814,0.821,0.136,0.043,0.5588435374149661

"" We had 9:15 reservations on a Saturday night, and the joint was jumpin' -- still waited 20 minutes for our table.  The problem is that there's no real way to get a drink -- there was no place to sit, no way to even get to the bar, no one to take our order/ask if we wanted a drink.  (Minus one star.) When we were finally seated, we got our menus and -- OK, the waitress was stressed, overworked, busy -- but does she REALLY have to explain what ""tapas"" are to people?  Really???  Maybe so. So we ordered cocktails, and ordered several tapas, and I said to her, ""Since paella takes some time to make, we should probably order that now.""  She came back and told me the paella would take an hour.  So we skipped the paella (kitchen was backed-up?), and ordered a couple of more tapas . . .  The first two tapas arrived *before* our cocktails.  OK, so the kitchen *wasn't* backed-up, the bar was?  (Minus another star.) The waitress returned to tell us a) the cocktails were on the way, and b) that they were sold out of the baby octopus and the Jamon Iberico  . . .  so we ordered two different tapas . . . .  Uh -- I don't know.  The food -- what they DID have and when we DID get it -- was quite good.  The cocktails were very good.  The wine list was OK, nothing too exciting, and NO sherries -- tapas and Fino (or Manzanilla) is a classic pairing, and they don't have any??? Sherry DID appear, but only on the dessert menu -- why a Fino is on the dessert menu when it's an aperitif is beyond me . . . .

If they did a buffet style spread where I could serve myself, get my own drinks, refill my own water, bus my own table and ring myself up that would kick ass. But that would defeat the purpose of dining out....so I don't have to do any of those things.  First time we went it was 3 of us: me, my sister and her bf. We were sitting at a table, me in the middle with them on either side of me. Why does this matter? You'll see.   Our server seemed really pre-occupied while she was talking to us. She kept glancing away at other tables and seemed in a hurry to be done with us. We ordered and sat back waiting for our food to arrive. (it was restaurant week so we just did the fixed menu) Our server didn't come to our table to do the customary check up to see if everything was ok, did we need anything, etc. until AFTER our meal was done. Really, lady? There are no plates in front of us anymore and now you're concerned about what we might have needed?  At one point of our meal I looked in the general direction of the bar area. Our server was walking down the steps with a glass of red wine for one of the tables. I watched in disgust as she PUTS HER WHOLE NOSE AND MOUTH into the wine glass to sniff the wine. Wtf???? Is that normal, before you serve someone wine, to put your face into that person's glass and smell it??? I don't mean a general hover above the glass, it was a full-blown chin, lips and nose inside the glass. The second time I went for brunch with my sister. Again service was meh at best.  I ordered a coffee and didn't get it. I asked again and still didn't get it. So I just resorted to drinking water since it was obvious I wasn't going to get anyone to give me any coffee.  So yeah at this point I'm probably not going to go back there anytime soon.

First, we didn't have a reservation and they were gracious enough to seat us on the patio.  It started to rain and we were sat right away inside.   We had a wonderful waiter who was very patient since we had never been before and were trying to catch up after 4 years of not seeing each other.  We ordered a bottle of wine and then the fun began.

But on to the food! They have a Catalan Express special for lunch with includes 2 courses and a fountain drink. For the first course, we had a serrano ham & fig salad and the mixto croquettas.  I'm usually not a big salad fan but this was amazing!  I wish they bottled the dressing and sold it..it was sooo good. I think this was the highlight of the meal. The croquettes, filled with ham and chorizo were also very tasty.  The second course, my friend ordered the Las Ramblas grilled chicken sandwich.  He thought it was good (being a big bacon fan) but thought the bread was kind of dry.  For me, I had the Black Angus hanger steak.  It was cooked just the way I liked it (medium-medium well)...but if you like your steak more rare definitely tell them.  The waiter didn't ask how I wanted it (actually he was pretty non-existent...thus the drop in star. But the busboy was cool and answered some of our questions).  Then the waiter came with our check before we even ordered dessert...the MAIN reason I picked the restaurant!  We quickly corrected him.  Unfortunately the chocolate croquettes didn't blow me away.  Don't get me wrong...it was tasty but maybe I built it up in my head too much.   But either way, we'll definitely be back!  We heard good things about the Sunday brunch too.",0.9956,0.785,0.19,0.025,0.5227551020408164

2011-07-01,5.0,"The last time I reviewed Mercat I had dropped them down from a 5 star to a 2 star. I was sad to have to drop their stellar reviews but Mercat has more than redeemed itself based on the sincerity of the staff and their quick response to issues we had mentioned. Needless to say, Mercat will remain a 5 star restaurant, especially after tonight. I'm glad to say that I will continue to return to Mercat for their high quality food and their great customer service. I was promptly contacted by the Chef de Cuisine and we were invited back. This time service was stellar and we had a wonderful time there. Our server, Fred, is probably one of the best servers I have encountered in a long time. He was very personable and friendly. In addition, all of the issues that i had noted from my last dining experience there have been corrected and service was even better than before. We started out with the appetizer special, which was an Oxtail Empanada. The dough was nice and light and wasn't greasy at all. The oxtail was delicious and tender.We also enjoyed the Pulpo Con Patatas, which was tender and had a nice smoky taste. In addition, we ordered the Arroz ala Cazuela which was just divine. It was super flavorful and all the flavors were married really well. I would definitely order this again.  Now the show stopper-- The half SUCKLING PIG was amazing. It was perfectly seasoned and had tons of umami.The skin was perfectly crisped. The table side presentation was also awesome. The chef neatly separated the parts of the pig while giving us an explanation and even discussed the process of cooking the pig with us, which was really nice. We are the adventurous type so we took advantage of the head and tried the jowl, brain, and ears. The brain was prepared with a cherry gastritis and it was magnificent. If you can try the suckling pig, do so! The pig was accompanied by wilted spinach w/ apples, fingerling potatoes, and rosemary white beans all of which were delicious as well.  I'm so glad we went back. Mercat a la Planxa you have won my heart once again!",0.9993,0.701,0.292,0.008,0.5956424792139078
2011-07-01,5.0,"A third update seems a little excessive doesn't it?? I would've thought so but there's no way I could have NOT done another update. It brings me great pleasure to relinquish Mercat its previous 2star rating and bump it to a 5. A very important business principle IMO is Customer Retention. Smart businesses operate via returning customers who continuously pour money into profits versus the one customer who pays a big bill but is never to be seen again (it's common sense).  You know someone is serious about business if they monitor social outlets such as Yelp for any unsatisfactory reviews. Mercat does just that and their loss prevention warrants them a much deserved update.  I understand everyone has their off days and  I'm certain my last visit was probably one of those. But if you don't call attention to these minor slip ups, they could very well become a new model of what's to be expected.. I couldn't bear to allow that to happen to Mercat.  Things You MUST Try: - Oxtail Empanadas: the dough is very light, but flavorful. Great texture. The filling had a very great flavor profile. Basically, think of your favorite braised dish stuffed into an empanada shell. Oxtail meat is decadent. - Arroz a la Cazuela: Spanish take on Gumbo. Nice smoky broth accented by the rich unmistakable taste of saffron. Nice accents of spanish chorizo and assorted meats. Very satisfying. Also served with crouton and rouille. - Suckling Pig: Seriously worth the procedure of calling 3 days in advance, etc. Table side presentation, LOTs of pork. If you're a pork lover.. this is for you. I love that they didn't over-complicate anything. The beauteous pig was allowed to shine, and it was not in vain. I would suggest splitting this among 6-8 people. The accompanying sides are very complementary. I used to boast about Chinese Style roasted pork but this has honestly bumped it down a notch on my list. At this point, Mercat's suckling pig reigns.  If you have the opportunity, check this place out. Try the dishes I mentioned. You will NOT be disappointed.",0.9973,0.756,0.205,0.039,0.5113718534551867

2011-06-14,5.0,"Dinner at Mercat a la Planxa was one of the things I was most looking forward to on my most recent visit to Chicago. My last meal there still stands as one of the best meals I've had in my life. I was looking forward to being able to re-sample some of the dishes I loved last time (espinacas a la Catalana, how I love you!) and trying some new ones. While the experience was not as stellar as the last (we visited on a Friday evening at 7:15, so the restaurant was much busier and service understandably less impeccable), the restaurant maintains its status as my favorite in Chicago - and gives Amada a run for its money as my favorite JG spot.  This was my first meal after making it to the city, so I arrived hungry and ready to do damage to the tapas menu. Luckily, my friends can eat, so we were able to try everything I was looking forward to. The menu is expansive and you're not going to want to choose. Come hungry, bring friends, and leave the picky eaters at home (although vegetarians will be perfectly happy - 67% of our table did not eat meat or fish, with me being the notable exception).  We started with the cheese mixto, which is very well put together. I have forgotten two of the cheeses, but one was a very good, rich garroxta. The highlight of the cheese plate is definitely the accompaniments, though. The vegetarians were in ecstacy over the garlic dulce de leche (one is coming to visit me in Philadelphia soon and is thrilled to know that she can actually purchase it at Garces Trading Company!). What they don't know is that if they ate meat, they could have had the sherry-bacon caramel, which puts absolutely everything else we ate that evening to shame. I literally licked the bowl. That good.  Although the menu is very meat-heavy, there were plenty of dishes to keep my vegetarian friends happy. We ordered one of the specials, which was reminiscent of scrambled eggs - with truffles and truffle oil. It had incredible flavor and depth. The special was intended to include shrimp, as well, but was absolutely great without them. We also ordered the bomba rice. I skipped this dish (you'll see why by the time I get to the end, I can only fit so much at one meal!) but the vegetarians enjoyed it, including the one who is not a particularly big fan of rice. All of us loved the truita de patata, which is a traditional Spanish tortilla (and essentially the same thing as the tortilla Espanola at Amada). The espinacas a la Catalana was just as delicious as I remembered, leaving me wishing that Amada or Tinto would add it to the menu.  To round out our vegetarian selections, we had the patatas bravas, calcots a la planxa, and llientes i cigrons. The potatoes and green onions were very good and prepared perfectly, although not particularly innovative. The table was split on the lentil and garbanzo bean dish. It arrived at the end of the evening, though, so those of us who did not love it may simply have been too full to appreciate it. It was definitely innovative, though - the texture and flavors were new to me! I was the only one at the table who ate either of the two meat dishes, so you will have to trust my word on them. Don't worry, I have vast meat-eating experience (on this vacation alone I managed to eat 9 different animals) so you can totally trust my opinion. The first dish was the cordero lechal en curry - roasted suckling lamb with chickpeas, broccolini, and served with flatbread. When I first tasted the dish, I didn't love it - I just had the lamb with some sauce on the flatbread and didn't think the flavors were great.  Then I got smart and tried a bit of everything on a fork. Oh, my! That made all the difference. The flatbread turned out to be absolutely unnecessary; we used the rest to eat the llientes i cigrons. My last dish was the conil amb castanyes - braised rabbit agnolotti. It was absolutely delicious. When I described it to a friend, she was suspcious - rabbit in pasta? The answer is yes. Rabbit in pasta. Thumbs up.  Along with the incredible meal, we enjoyed some of the seasonal sangria. It was very refreshing; my only complaint is that, with the addition of Absolut raspberry, it's dangerously delicious! By the end of dinner I was definitely feeling my drinks. We shared the chocolate croquettes and crema Catalana for dessert, although we just nibbled the flavors were great. One friend reported that the chocolate croquette made her feel like a chocolate-eating vampire.  Mercat a la Planxa did not disappoint. It is definitely always going to make it onto my list of places to eat when I visit the Windy City. With absolutely delicious food, great service (even when the restaurant is slammed!), and innovative flavors, it's everything I expect from my favorite Iron Chef.",0.9996,0.747,0.221,0.032,0.6027974234600743
2011-06-06,4.0,"I'm not normally a fan of tapas only because I tend to favor places that give you larger portions for lesser prices. However, Having had such positive experiences at 2 other tapas restaurants in Chicago, why not go for 3 for 3? I was set up to come here to meet a guest. I left the burbs an hour and some change early, got there 20 minutes late anyway. Word of warning for those who are coming from the burbs...either plan ahead or...plan ahead. That's all there is to it. Traffic in downtown Chicago is brutal (to say the least) and coming during dinnertime is a verifiable nightmare. Anyway, enough about my travels, let's get to the grub. The table ""bread"" is amazing. I think it was some kind of bruschetta, but it was absolutely delicious. I could have gorged myself on just those alone. My dinner companion and I elected to go with the ""Chef's Selection"", which is cornucopia of food. Be warned, however, it because it IS the Chef's selection, you are going to PAY for the chef's selections. Very impressed with the types of flatbread, cheese and spread plate. As well, I loved their dumplings (I think that's what they were). About an hour into our meal, we still hadn't finished anything and the waiter brought out steak knives. At that point, we were both stuffed...but we managed to get some more food down anyway. I think it was more than 7 different types in total, but my memory is somewhat hazy. We also elected to go with a pitcher of the white sangria. However, since they were out of pitchers, our waiter instead promised us 3 glasses of sangria apiece. Since this was an option, we decided to try all three types out and we were very happy that we did. The white was very weak (emphasis on VERY), the red had a very strong wine flavor that didn't overpower and yet still left you with a pleasant tingle, and the seasonal was nothing to write home about. Can you guess which sangria we liked best? Check time came and I realized why we had gotten so much food. I remembered rather suddenly why I don't eat out very often. I'm not complaining though...we had an exemplary meal being served by a top-rate waitstaff. While I'd love to come back often, it's the price tag that makes me realize that perhaps often is a little much. Save up a little and make an occasion of this trip. It's also important to note that it can get a little crowded, making navigation to the bathrooms a little difficult. That and some of the prices  were the only things that knocked off a star. (Hey, have you SEEN gas prices? How does one afford to eat AND drive these days?) End result: Parking is available through valet, food is pretty pricey, but with good company it's a great dining experience. Highly recommended for the more casual dating scene as it's not overly pretentious (I thought) and the staff is very friendly and helpful. Great times!",0.9981,0.787,0.174,0.038,0.5754124579124579

And thats saying something.  My bf and I have found that when food arrives at our table and our first thought is - wtf that tiny thing is $40????! - we're probably not going to like it. Wish we could have known that prior to going. We ordered the bacon wrapped dates (mine had a pit it in it), the ""house bread,"" (a overly citrusy version of bruschetta), the patatas bravas (not spicy AT ALL), some fish on the grill I forget, and the lamb in curry (which was passable).  We tried the dish that the chef apparently made when he was on Iron Chef - he won the 2009-2010 season - which was a beef flatbread.  All I can say is that he must have been in the bottom three that night. I recommend Café Ba-Ba-Reba (northside), Café Iberico, or Tapas de Valencia (south loop). Two stars for great service and a beautiful atmosphere.

Somehow he managed to keep looking at his monitor while he felt our presence in front of him. We told him we had a reservation and gave him our name. Then - while still having not lifted his head to look at us - looked over at the girl who showed up next to him and instructed her to sit us.  We sat at our table for a good 15 minutes at least. The place was nowhere near packed and there were a handful of servers just kinda standing around, looking around. Turned out that none of them was our server. Our server finally arrived and we ordered drinks and food:  - Mixto (Chef's Selectio of 3 Cheeses - $16)  - Datiles Con Almendras (Bacon-Wrapped Dates Stuffed with Almonds - $7)  - Verdosa (Mixed Baby Greens with Green Asparagus, Avocado, Confit Cherry Tomatoes and Shaved Mahon Cheese - $12)  When the dates came out, it was two sticks, each one with two bacon-wrapped dates. Definitely not worth the $7. Then another server came and put the cheese down on the table, then quickly walked away. That's out it was with all our dishes. We weren't even informed what the cheeses were. The Verdosa was probably the best dish but still nothing to write home about.  All the while, we were watching as servers came around and cleared the tables of their dinnerware and set out what looked like glasses and plates for breakfast.  Even another diner a couple of tables away from us we could tell was having a terrible experience. He came in after us and left before us. When his server came to pick up the bill, he looked around to see if the diner was still around somewhere, then shook his head.

2011-05-21,2.0,"How far can you really expect $35 to go at a place like this? I'm not really sure. But that's Mercat's weekly special for their Iron Chef Mondays, where they recreate all the dishes from an episode that Iron Chef Garces competed in. Well, after our dinner, I went home and pulled up the very episode our dinner was supposed to be based on - Battle Truffle. Now, I know truffle's expensive. I know that. But I noticed a few key differences between what we ate and what the judges ate: 1) Much less truffle. Ok, some of the dishes on the show had piles of shaved truffle, and there's no way $35 could cover that. But maybe a couple slices at least? 2) Straight-up substitutions. We got wild boar instead of veal, and there were places where the IC used some truffle variation of an ingredient that we didn't get. 3) Again, I know it was just $35...but the portions were really disappointing. With 4 of us, we had to split either one or two of the sizes that the judges got. Trying to split one egg and four small pieces of steak four ways is both simple and sad. It made me wonder what I would've received if I came by myself and ordered the same special. I think this could've been better if we were told ahead of time that it'd be wise to order something to accompany the special, or even if they had a more expensive option that let us have more. I wrote in my last review of this place that my dad joked about going to Wendy's after coming here. There being no Wendy's in the south loop, my friends and I hit up White Castle.

2011-04-06,2.0,"What a disappointing birthday dinner. I came here on Monday for my special Iron Chef birthday dinner and it was just so underwhelming and failed to meet any of my expectations. Let me start with the good... *We got lucky with our street parking spot.  *Our waiter was so well informed about the foods and also the wines. I didn't know which wine to get and he brought me a couple of wines to try. He was just like a sommelier with his vast knowledge of the liquids. However I should have known he would bring me two of the most expensive wines on the menu to try. $16 for my glass of South American vino. *Not on the Iron Chef Monday menu, we had the Cadi Urgelia which was quite good. It's a cow milk cheese platter but honestly, nothing is cooked so if this was somehow messed up, that would be a big shame. *The Serrano Ham & Fig Salad (on the Iron Chef & the regular menu). This had such a creative presentation and was so tasty. I don't usually like salad but this was encased in the thinly cut ham with just the right amount of sherry vinaigrette, plus tasty spiced almonds to boot. Perhaps my favorite dish of the night! *The bacon wrapped stuffed dates, Datiles Con Almendras (only on the regular menu, we ordered & paid for these separately like the cheese plate). All tapas places seem to have these but the presentation and being topped with the sauce make them top notch here. Mediocre which should probably be under bad but I can't say they were horrible.. :P *Truita De Patata Con Espinacas, Spanish omelette with potato, spinach & saffron. Not much I can on this except it was just okay. *Espinacas A La Catalana...Okay spinach but nothing too appealing. *Gambas Al Ajillo, garlic spciy shrimp. Underwhelming. Now the bad...Dun Dun Dun Dun... *some people had their own nice tables, but if you're a party of two expect to be smooshed next to a bunch of other parties of two. Lame to not have the proper personal space while dining. *Nowhere did they say you need to be very specific in saying you wanted the Iron Chef menu. The table next to us went to try the Iron Chef Monday menu and the waiter informed them that was not going to happen, they only had 20 portions! Really? For your special opening night of this you made enough for 20 people? Errrrr. That really sucks. The guy at that table was quite annoyed because he called and asked about it the menu when he made their reservation and nothing was mentioned about having to secure the menu. Thankfully we did note we wanted the Iron Chef menu in our Open Table reservation so we were granted the privileged. The worst part....they substituted menu items and no one ever told us this was going to happen!!! Um....since when can you just change someone's dishes? Especially one of the special Mexican chocolate items! What in the world!? This was just such a poorly executed special menu for Mercat. We never got the Kobe beef tartare or the Canela waffle with chocolate sauce. Ridiculous when that was the whole point of this menu. Argh! *Costillas De Ternera beef shortribs, horseradish, parmesan & bacon Flatbread...we each had one piece of this and didn't finish the rest....didn't even take it home. The flatbread itself was good but the toppings weren't great. *Mexican chocolate tamale and Mexican chocolate Iberian pork loin. Yay I thought! Something from the special menu! The Pork was good, the tamale was not. *Mexican chocolate linguine with smoked duck. The duck was good and I realize duck is greasy but the dish overall was extreeeemely greasy and extreeeeemely salty. Not a fan. *Although our server started out nice, it got extremely slow. He told us the kitchen was backed up and I'm understanding of that...but at this point we were just waiting on our dessert. *Dessert. Well this wasn't the dessert we were supposed to get AND we just waited 30 minutes for it to come out...30 minutes for some cocoa puff things and a bowl of sorbet. Argh. *So after we finished our dessert, we waited another 30 minutes for him to ask us if we needed anything else. Then another 10 minutes for our check. We put our CC right in for him to take so we could leave but it was another 5 minutes before he came back to us. All in all we spent two and a half hours there when it should have been about 90 minutes. *They were also supposed to have Mexican chocolate atole with doughnuts as a dessert but that wasn't on their menu in the restaurant. Check the sites ( chicago.eater.com/archiv… ) ...it was supposed to be 5 courses but it was actually four & 2 of the dishes listed were not offered. It was tasting sized portions of the middle three dishes mixed with some of their regular menu items. I'm sorry Mercat a la Planxa, but you did not make me a happy birthday camper and you truly failed on the Iron Chef Menu premiere night.

2011-04-05,3.0,"Came last night for the first ""Iron Chef Monday"", which was featuring Mexican chocolate.  We got the Iron Chef tasting menu for two, but also ordered additional items since those portions were smaller.  Tooootally didn't have to do that, since I was struggling half way through the meal... or maybe that was because I had huge burger for lunch.   The Mexican chocolate tasting menu included 3 courses and a dessert (each course having 2 menu items and 1 Mexican chocolate dish).  I now realize some of our chocolate dishes were substituted with regular menu items.  The kobe beef tartare never came out and we never got the waffle with chocolate sauce.  Instead we got a chocolate ""funnel cake"", which was more like chocolate covered rice krispies with a papaya sorbet.  I was just so full I couldn't think straight.  But it all makes sense now, since the table next to us was told they had run out of the Iron Chef menu portions.  Out of the the special dishes I tried, both were okay.  The smoked duck over the chocolate linguine was perfectly cook.  The chocolate mole pork loin could've been a bit more moist, but the chocolate tamale was delicious.  Out of the other dishes from the tasting menu, the only one that I really enjoyed was the serrano ham & fig salad.  The salad was wrapped by serrano ham, into a salad meat log.  Filled with figs and large crispy chunks of pork belly.  Also the bacon-wrapped dates were delicious.  Crispy bacon, stuffed with almonds, with hot blue cheese poured over.  Other then that, the rest of the dishes were just okay.

2011-04-04,2.0,"My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary dinner on a recent trip to Chicago. We picked Mercat over several other tapas places in the area because it billed itself as ""Catalonian"" fare. Having sampled many delicious tapas in Barcelona last year, we were pumped. However, I think we would have enjoyed the meal much more if the restaurant avoided drawing that comparison.  We made a reservation for 9:30 PM, but when we arrived we were told that there were no open tables. What? There isn't really a great spot to wait upstairs, and we were afraid that if we went to the bar downstairs, we would miss being seated. So, we stood and waited next to the hostess stand for about 20 minutes. The atmosphere was awesome, though. Great interior decorating, house music playing. When we finally did get seated, our waiter was slow to take the order, and seemed very ""pushy"" about getting us to order everything we would want at the beginning of the meal. While in Spain, we ordered tapas a few at a time, eating and drinking slowly to savor the food, so this was a little disconcerting. To start, we ordered the bacon wrapped dates, patatas bravas, jamon pato, and a pitcher of the seasonal sangria.  To Mercat's credit, the food did come out promptly. The bacon wrapped dates were phenomenal, and we ordered a second helping almost immediately. The jamon was good, but we needed additional bread. The patatas bravas were a letdown, little more than glorified tater tots. We also wondered why the aioli and the spicy paprika sauce were mixed together, and why the portions were so darn small! Still, we are suckers for anything with mayonnaise, so we ordered a second helping of those, too. To finish, we tried a trio of sorbets--- the mango sorbet is a real shocker, I'd advise anybody to try it once.  Our chief complaint was our waiter. He clearly snubbed us because he felt that our $100 pre-tip tab was not up to his standards. It was extremely difficult for us to get ahold of him throughout the meal to order more courses, although he doted on the tables on either side of us who ordered the overpriced tasting menu. We are young professionals, and regularly leave a 20% tip for good service, but his nasty attitude cost him. Also, why don't they train their servers to correctly pronounce the names of their dishes? I did not order ""bravo potatoes"" ;-) The seating is very tight, so if you get jerks seated next to you like we did, your experience could be affected. The women next to us were going on and on about how one's daughter just came out as a lesbian, and constantly yelled about how the food was ""horrible."" So, be aware.  Overall, we got much better tapas at a much better price in Spain, even in touristy spots, and even with the crappy exchange rate. I was really expecting something more authentic than this--- if it's not authentic, don't say it is. I'd advise anyone interested in tapas to get a cookbook and try it at home, because if this is what Americans will rave about, you can do much better at home!",0.9759,0.817,0.11,0.073,0.46586453669787004

We had a reservation for 13 at 9:30.  When we arrived, which admittedly was about 10 minutes late, two of our group had already checked in with the hostess upstairs, who told them that they were ready for us.  So, 10 minutes late, we went upstairs and said we were only going to be 10 people, and they told us that it would be about 10 more minutes - um, what?  Okaaaaay...so we went to the upstairs bar and ordered drinks.  About 30 minutes later, they had our table ready.  Just a ridiculous delay considering the time and that we had a reservation. We ordered pitchers of margaritas and a LOT of tapas.  Personally, I ordered 3 dishes.  45 minutes later, I had received one of them.  The tapas that came out for the table was badly timed - some people didn't get anything they ordered for 30 minutes.  So after 45 minutes, when the waiter came back and asked how things were going, I told him that I had only received 1 of my 3 dishes - the seafood meatballs, yum.  I didn't get the patatas bravas or the croquettes.  He went away to put in the order and 10 minutes later came back to say they had just run out of the patatas...and then blamed me for having ""just ordered them"".   I said, ""well actually, I ORDERED them 45 minutes ago.""  He suggested another lentil dish, which I agreed to try, and which never showed up.  The croquettes came out and were quite tasty. Our server should have checked in with us earlier about our food.  He did try to salvage some tip by getting us free desserts, and then of course added 19% tip for himself since we were a large party.  We didn't argue the tip but certainly didn't contribute any more than that, which we would have done if the service and food delivery had been better.   The food that DID make it to our table was very good, hence the two stars.  The classic margaritas were excellent.  Too expensive for my taste on a normal basis, and based on this experience they can't handle big parties, so no real reason for me to go back again.",0.9363,0.873,0.083,0.043,0.46981481481481485

By the time we were shown to our table it was 7:50. We wouldn't have cared if the bartender wasnt horrible. The bald asian bartender needs some serious help. Not only was he rude, he poured the weakest .75 ounce of tequilla ($13) I have ever had. Even the young hostess was  pathetic. At one point, another party complianed to her about the bartender and she just rolled her eyes.  At our table we had a pleasant waitress who really didnt provide assistance with the menu. However,  the food quality was great. We are large foodies and ordered a wide assortment of the plates, which were all delicious.  We did have a manager come to our table to check on how things were going, but she showed up 2 minutes after we sat down. The waitress never checked on us until all of our plates were finished.  Overall, I dont think we will rush back. I really liked the food but did not like the whole experience. For our party of four, we spent $250 and I would have appreciated a better experience. Even on our way out, another manager asked about our night.

All this for $25? Add a $8 all-you-can-drink assortment of mimosas, sangrias and bloody mary bar... and you've got yourself an incredibly decadent three-hour brunch.  OMG.  I'm drooling just remembering it.

Anyway, Ben was chatting with us about the menu while pouring our wine (and our glasses were always topped off before we even needed to reach for the bottle) which just shows how ""easy"" the whole meal felt.  He made amazing suggestions.  We had the three cheese plate with the manchango, bacon wrapped dates, fried peppers, chorizo, a flatbread, dessert...I mean, I feel like if I list everything we ate you'll judge me, so I'll stop here.   Honestly, once we were able to give Ben a sense of what we liked, he was spot on in recommending even more things for us to try.  I loved that!!!! One thing that sets great servers apart from others is their ability to anticipate your need as a diner.  Ben D. did that...and more.  This was one of my favorite meals in the City. The meal was spectacular, the service phenomenal, and I can't wait to plan my next trip to Mercat.",0.9977,0.731,0.258,0.012,0.6641129032258065

I had their brunch tasting menu, which included a 7 course menu, a charcuterie buffet with suckling pig, and a dessert bar.  For $30, this was an absolute steal. Highlights:  - Roasted suckling pig was hacked apart while still crackling and juicy.  Seriously made me forget all about Purple Pig.   - Their take on Eggs Benedict with truffle oil was incredible.  Fluffy yet decadent.   - Crab topped toasted brioche was also similarly amazing. - They made a tasty spinach and green apple salad dish that I originally thought was going to be the weak part of the menu but turned out to be an delight.  Very light and fresh, and the interplay between cold,tart apples and partially sauteed spinach was clever. All in all highly recommended.  I can't remember the last time I had a meal that good.",0.96,0.785,0.158,0.057,0.6307291666666667

2011-02-04,2.0,"I have trouble giving just 1 star.  Especially to a restaurant I know COULD be good.  I've been here twice.  Once for dinner, when my experience was pretty good.  I enjoyed the food and the service was alright... The second time was for brunch.  The experience was enough for me to never go back, unless dragged, kicking and screaming. After surveying my coworkers, friends, and foodie acquaintances alike, we've decided that Mercat can't do large parties.  You'd think they could, being a tapas place whose menu is designed for sharing... On to the brunch.  We were a group of ten.  We all did the $25 pick five tapas and each of us chose a beverage (bottomless Bloody Mary bar, the only awesome thing about my experience!) as one of our dishes.  The idea with this is that each person orders his own dishes, which of course we were anticipating sharing, but which we expected to be delivered to each person individually. Not the case.  The server (I wish I remembered his name...Bob?  I'll call him Bob, although it could have been Matt or Mark or I dunno...) told us that he would ""just bring everything out family style...""  Um, ok, Bob, sure, just do whatever you want huh?  So my boyfriend and I (sitting at the end of the table) were the only ones who had ordered the brandade.  They delivered one to each end of the table, and no one at the other end even knew what it was to let us know that it was down there.  When we finally discovered it hiding at the other end, it was all good because the brandade tasted like crap anyway.  Possible the worst, most tasteless brandade I've ever had.  So this was the case with all dishes, causing us to yell out to the food runners when they brought the dishes over, ""OH!  I have the pork belly,over here!"" We tried almost everything... Loved the benedict, it was actually delicious!  The bacon wrapped dates, as in my first experience, and as promised by everyone and their mother, were AWESOME! Everything else... especially the shortrib and the hash... boring.  Uninspired.  I could make much better at home. At one point our server, ""Bob"" got into an argument with the chefs in the open kitchen.  I noticed.  Most diners wouldn't but I work in a restaurant so I did.  You have to be careful about these things with an open kitchen.   Other notes about ""Bob"" include: -HUGE rip in his pants!  Just below his butt on the inside of his thigh, I mean 3-4""!  I don't want to stare at my server's hairy inner thigh while eating, thank you! -When the hash came out for one of our guests, my boyfriend, who cooks professionally, asked if the egg was supposed to be poached, or fried, or hard or what (it was sitting on top, poached, but over.  A hard rubbery mass).  ""Bob"" replies, ""Uh, I dunno, you wanna new one?""  The replacement the egg was fried.  Uh? -Didn't ask us if we wanted any coffees or anything, left us sitting for 20 minutes with no food or anything.  I got up and asked the chefs, assuming they would love a reason to make ""Bob"" feel bad. -When the girls at the other end asked what was available on the dessert buffet, he responded, ""there's some rolls and fruit, I'm not sure exactly what they've got today...you can go look?"" -Informed us that normally he brings the vodka for the bottomless bloody marys, but we should probably just head to the bar, it's easier. All in all, the restaurant seemed unprepared for our 10 top, food was disorganized, and left us waiting at awkward moments, some with food in front of them, some not, the carving and cheese station was a mess, the manager/host seemed to not give a flying eff about what was happening on the floor (she never came near our table, of course), the food seemed like it sat warming for extended periods of time, the service was god awful (definitely ""Bob's"" fault).  The only employee who seemed like he cared about his job was the bartender. Thank Jeebus for AUTOGRAT, huh ""Bob""??? With a smaller group, Mercat A La Planxa is a good value, with a few really tasty treats.  Is it worth the risk of a TERRIBLE experience?  I don't think so...  Head to Emilio's or Cafe Ba Ba Reba, which are more consistent, delicious, and less pricey!",0.9949,0.784,0.14,0.076,0.5894737207237208

It was pretty good, just staple Sangria if you ask me, but we werent here for the drinks. We had about 10 tapas and each was just as good as the last. I think my favorites were the spicy potatoes, garlic shrimp, bacon wrapped dates and the cheese with the caramel bacon dipping sauce. The standout to me was the dessert. We ordered the chocolate empenadas with the banana marshmallow on top and OMG I am still dreaming about that dessert. This dessert was by far the best dessert I have ever had.   Each of the dishes had such a great flavor profile. We were never sitting and waiting for food. We always had at least 2 of our tapas on the table at all times. The service was great.  My only gripe was a cappuccino was $5, coffee was $4 and the espresso was $4.50. Everything else seemed to be a great price point, until we came to the after dinner drinks. $4 for a coffee? Seems to be a bit of a rip off to me.

The decor is very nice and hip.  As you flow up the circular staircase you come into a room where the curved theme pleasantly continues.  Tables, walls, walkways all having some curved elements.   High ceilings give the space a nice open feel.  Bright colors and varying textures abound.  You know immediately you are in a lively cool space.  Just what one might expect from the restaurant of an Iron Chef.  The only questionable concept is the abundance of mirror walls.  Yup.....I did flash back a couple times to childhood memories of late 70s/early 80s at my friends house where the mirror wall was rockin' it out!  They make it work here at Mercat somehow.

I can totally understand how, per some reviews, the food seems overpriced and poorly executed.  Our main courses (seared scallops, and seared ahi tuna) were definitely poorly cooked and somewhat sloppily executed.  Likewise, the first courses were sort of thrown together (a tasty stew of chorizo, shrimp, artichoke, etc.; and a green salad with asparagus and avocado, etc.) without any creative presentation to speak of. That said, the ingredients and flavors were all wonderful.  The stew was delicious, and the celery root and eggplant purees on our main courses were so creamy and wonderful.  So it's kind of what you'd expect from the forgotten side project of an iron chef:  Iron-Chef caliber flavors and ingredients, with line cook execution. Now, if you were going for dinner and ordered $80 worth of different individual plates which all fell short, the above-described compromise might not be a comfort to you.  But at lunch, it's definitely worth it.  Get the Catalan Express lunch deal.  A soda, any first course, and any second course (in combinations that would normally cost as much as $27), all for $18.  A great deal worthy of 4 stars, despite the compromise in quality.",0.9689,0.841,0.129,0.03,0.5555555555555555

The food, desserts, wine, and cocktails are all excellent.  We've had the flatbreads, gambas al ajillo, patatas bravas, paella negra, lamb, and several other things I can't remember now, but I DO remember it all tasted great.  The mushroom soup was so heavenly I could have drunk a gallon of it.  Both red and white sangrias were yummy, and the ""Dark and Stormy"", gaaaahhh.....",0.9795,0.798,0.175,0.028,0.49673913043478274

One of my besties was in town just for one night from Calgary and she was celebrating a new job. I decided to try out Mercat, which is where I almost went for my birthday dinner this summer had Girl & the Goat not opened that same week!  The ambiance is nice, although a little too brightly lit. The music was really good! The food was quite delectable, although nothing in particular was memorable.  But the reason I'm not coming back here is the service! **Absolutely terrible service!** The guy was so busy flirting with a neighboring table of 5 girls all night that he couldn't care less to make sure our tapas had arrived at the table, our glasses of water were refilled or stop by to ask if we wanted to order dessert. He was exceptionally rude and threw around an attitude that had no place to be there.  I completely disagree with all the Yelp Talk around the fact that service shouldn't be part of a review, only food should be. When you pay such premium prices, you're doing so for the experience and service is an integral part of that experience.

2010-11-30,5.0,"Take a jaunt away from Barcelona's Gothic Quarter and Las Ramblas into Mercat Santa Caterina: A Catalonian market possessing a myriad of colors, flavors and aromas.  After experiencing the real thing in the homeland of Espana, your heart will be calling for Chicago's South Loop Mercat a la Planxa located in the gorgeous Blackstone Hotel.  I finally had the opportunity to bite into their contemporary take of traditional and modern Spanish 'planxa' (grilled and made-to-order) tapas.  Now normally tapas are ""bar bites"" in Spain so Mercat was a ways off when it came to price...unless I was unknowingly paying for the currency equivalent price in Euros.  Otherwise, everything was Spain bumped up a notch involving chic decor with Gaudi-inspired mosaics and octagonal shapes.  Mercat even offers a Whole Roasted Suckling Pig (Cochinillo asado)!  [Note: Must be ordered 72 hours in advance]  I took all my fellow Yelpers advice and ordered the Premium Mesa de Jose's Tasting Menu.  Our fabulous waitress covered all bases by checking if anyone had allergies or dislikes, explaining the difference between the Premium Tasting and ordinary tasting (the premium basically includes the more expensive menu items; ej. lobster versus shrimp) and was super friendly and courteous to the point of giving me a menu marking down which items were including in the tasting.  Accompanied by my wino friend, we purchased a bottle of Garnacha/Tempranillo mix to accompany our food versus paying the overpriced wine pairing.  This was after sipping on a cocktail each of El Bolero and Merengue; both nothing to call home about. On to the Tasting...I will say that our favorite dishes, note that none were disliked, were the following (I included the menu's Catalan names for reference): -Bacon-wrapped Dates Stuffed with Almonds (Datiles con almendras): Best I had EVER had, which says a lot since they seem to have become popular at many restaurants across the city. -Braised Rabbit Agnolotti (Conill amb chestnut): One of my top dishes that was similar to a rabbit ravioli with a delectable truffle-chestnut puree and sweet brandied cherries. -Colorado Rack of Lamb: Easily the best lamb I had ever eaten with a delicious jus poured over the top with tons of flavor. -Colorado Lamb Loin Brochettes wrapped in Bacon with Lamb Jus (Pintxos muranos): Ultra tender with tons of natural juices and tasty bacon. -Serrano Ham & Fig Salad: I have been to the Museos de Jamon [""Ham Museums""] throughout Spain and wherever Mercat gets their serrano ham from is outstanding, plus this salad his huge with large, tasty figs hidden within. -Morel Mushroom Bomba Rice (Arrox con morels): Ultra fluffy rice dish with tons of truffle oil; What's not to love about that?! -Green Bean Salad with Serrano Ham (Judias verdes con jamon): I'm not a fan of vegetables but if this is what my mom prepared as a kid I would have quickly eaten my daily portion of greens. -Also included in the tasting were the following: Mixto cheeses and marmalades, Spanish Omelet (Truita de patata), Mussels (Mejillones a la rousillon), Porcini and Catalan Sausage Coca (Coca de cepes y butifarra), and half Lobster. I finished off my meal with the Croquetas de Xocolata which is not to be missed!  They're little fried balls of dough (croquettes) injected with milk chocolate which are to be dipped in the accompanying banana-marshmallow foam/creme and rosemary caramel.  The display alone is gorgeous being served on a deviled egg platter, but once you pop into one of those little fried gushers the display is easily forgotten about. My one [easily fixed] complaint is that the dishes came out quickly in the beginning and then became spaced out by 20 minutes or so towards the end.  My other would be the close proximity of the tables, but that's just how it goes.  Otherwise, Mercat is the perfect spot for a special occasion like an anniversary and the Chef Tasting Menu is extraordinary with a good variety of dishes and plenty of food.  So make that Open Table reservation ASAP.",0.9934,0.869,0.107,0.024,0.5243664717348928

A few recommendations, although I don't think you can go wrong with anything here: cheese: cana de cabra - goat cheese with strawberry balsamic  tapas: pimientos de padron, bacon wrapped dates, spanish octopus,  flatbread: short rib (sounds strange, tastes unbelievable) We are fairly picky eaters (one of us, very) and we did not have a single complaint during this meal.

Yelp Disappointment PERIOD The ambiance is good, the service was the worst I have ever experienced and the food just blatantly overpriced, over hyped and useless!  So we walk in, with reservations. I am impressed by the decor and  the size of the place! I have heard good things from Yelp, and I am excited about trying this place. So our hostess walks us over to a TINNNNEEEEEE, believe me TINEEE table in a corner for two people, so much so that my friends and i have touching knees ( not cool ), and worst so, the couple right next to us are right in our face too! We are embarrassed, they are embarrassed, I mean there is no way enough space for 4 people, and we don't know what to say! The hostess has mysteriously disappeared, we wait for our server to appear. 5 minutes wait, server comes.. could we have a different table please? No.. we are full up. Umm... I see some tables empty right there. We..eell, those are reserved! ok.. I gave up!  Uncomfortable as we were by this breach of personal space, I was not going to let it ruin my soon to begin superior culinary experience. Well, I am about to be disappointed!! I will begin with the best- Complimentary Tomato Flatbread- Maybe they should make this a menu dish. It was really good! Verdosa Mixed Greens with Green Asparagus, Avocado, Confit Cherry Tomatoes & Shaved Mahon Cheese- The only highlight of my so called culinary experience. I would have it again. Spanish Omelette with Spinach,Potatoes & Saffron Aioli - Would be a decent dish, maybe, had it got Salt in it! Patatas Bravas Spicy Potatoes with Spicy Paprika Aioli- PLEASE dont call this a dish! It is a side.. and a poor man's over hyped, over priced one at that! Catalan Spinach, Raisins, Pine Nuts & Apples - umm.. blanched spinach stacked with green apples is NOT an appetizing dish,.. you DO NOT have to be Gordon Ramsey to realize that please! Arroz a la Cazuela Saffron Scented Broth with Maine Lobster, Chicken, Chorizo, Rabbit, Shaved Artichoke Salad & Piquillo Aioli- By far the ugliest, and most tasteless dish I have ever eaten! It was like they dumped all left overs together and brought it to us in a bowl, with a n enormous price tag. Please please avoid this dish. I don;t even want to talk of the desserts now.. sigh.. I have a terrible memory of the horrors! I will never ever go here again! But I must say the service sucked! We had the two dishes on our tinee table,a nd the server unceremoniously dumps another one, then one more.. and now there is no place for the 5th.. please can we finish one at a time?! The server appeared ONLY when we had waited atleast 10 minutes each time for him to grace us with his presence, never explained any dish and was just blatantly unconcerned. And with this, I cannot go on any more,... I hated the place.. and ohhhh... the Seasonal Sangria.. have it only if you LOVE Cinnamon.. thats all it has!

2010-11-27,5.0,"BEST BRUNCH!! I've been to Mercat maybe 5 times for dinner and it's always SO YUMMY! We almost always do the Chef's Tasting menu to make it simpler because we are usually a party of 6 to 8. The servers are always attentive and accommodating. They know exactly how much to bring out with perfect timing, and if there is a special request (like someone doesn't eat shellfish) they will bring a substitution for that person. HINT: ask what is new for the season. For example, last winter we had an amazing tapa made from chestnuts, not on the summer menu. The servers will then be sure to incorporate any tapas that you specifically want into the tasting menu. I don't understand the people who complain about the small portions. Um, they're tapas. They are supposed to be small and no one is limiting your order. I've brought some friends here with cave-man sized appetites and even they came away stuffed after the Chef's Tasting. True, the restaurant isn't ""cheap"" but what good Chicago restaurant is? Whatever our final bill, we have always thought it totally worth it and so has everyone else I know who's been to Mercat - especially when we've spent just as much at other restaurants very mediocre food. But I digress ... this review is really about BRUNCH! Went for brunch last Sunday with a few friends and we all loved it and will definitely be back. It's an amazing deal ... for $25 you get a choice of four tapas and that includes bottomless mimosas, sangria or bloody marys. For brunch they have a special section to choose from with 'eggy' selections in addition so to some of their best tapas from the dinner menu. Additionally for an extra $6 (I think) you can go up to the carving station for the suckling pig and charcuterie selection. Trips are unlimited so I suggest some creative ordering if you get my drift. We started with coffee and our 'eggy' selection with mimosas for course. Then had the more savory selections brought out. Service was great. We never ONCE had to ask for our mimosa glasses to be re-filled. Our server must have been on auto-pilot with that! YOU MUST TRY THE ALMOND-STUFFED BACON-WRAPPED DATES SITTING ON SLAW & DRIPPING WITH BLEU CHEESE EMULSION!! Forget the bacon-wrapped dates you had at any other Spanish restaurant or tapas bar - NO COMPARISON. These are little nuggets of heaven :-)",0.9967,0.8,0.171,0.029,0.5171698671698672
2010-11-23,4.0,"My wife and I  have been going to Mercat since it opened in 2008 and we have introduced friends and family to its Catalan Spanish delicacies since the beginning.  The ""small plates"" format is more than a little overplayed at this point but Mercat came in at the beginning of that phase and with it's chef winning Iron Chef the restaurant which is also beautiful and well located in the Blackstone Hotel was off to the races.  While you can certainly order off of any of the menu's different segments we have have loved their tasting menu which is a real value at $55 because they bring selections from each of their menu segments and you get their best. It is a lot of food though but the variety is incredible. Highlights for starters are the tomato bread, the aged spanish hams, croquetas and the fantastic white anchovies. For flatbreads try the beef short rib & horseradish, for vegetables must haves are the wild mushroom with confit potato and the amazing stuffed cipollini onions. From the planxa (grill) try the amazingly marinated ribeye and the Colorado rack of lamb. I have always wanted to call ahead and order the whole suckling pig for four or more people but never had the takers.

I mean that's cool, it's kind of early for lunch ya know? For my first course I had the ""arroz con la cazuela"" - the broth with shrimp and chicken and the first tasting was good but I realized it was way too salty. Can you say sodium overload? My second course was the Mercat burger - Decent but too greasy and again, too salty. I also ordered the patatas fritas which was nothing extrodinary at all - tasted OK like McDonald fries. Shoot, I think I rather eat McDonald's fries. Overall, I was super disappointed in the lunch menu - there was not a variety at all. The service here was terrible also, we both had soft drinks and no one came to ask if we needed a refill except toward the end when we were paying our bill. This place wasn't even packed!

My husband and I both agreed that the one off part of the night was the fact that dessert was not included in the tasting menu.  I guess we kind of figured that at the price we were paying, all courses of the meal would be included.  We decided to try out the desserts regardless, and were delighted by what we ordered - he had the rum cake (I think), and I have some sort of chocolate croquettes, which were delicious. Aside from the food, the space itself was a treat in itself.  Housed in the former ballroom of the adjacent hotel, the dining room is high-ceilinged, colorful, and comes complete with a wonderful view of the park (and probably the lake during the day).  I also really enjoyed the very open layout and modern decor.  I would love to get some of their window decals designed to look like the pavers on las ramblas.",0.996,0.8,0.2,0.0,0.6524285714285715

I know, tapas are not supposed to resemble gyro plates or super-sized value meals, but these portions were extra tiny! I've eaten at 5 or 6 other tapas places, and I felt that this one served the smallest portions at the highest prices. I also felt that the cocktails were weak, which did not help the cause.

2010-10-18,2.0,"I was hoping for amazing.  What we got was so-so.   The restaurant is cool, has a great energetic vibe, and the promise of catalan tapas prepared in the style of Chef Jose Garces is all delicious sounding...  Sadly, their waitstaff (ours named Wesley) isn't particularly well versed in Catalan sophistication.  Instead, there's more of a South Western Avenue Used Car Salesman approach.  Pushing the chef's selections and boring sangrias before even bothering to get to know their customers... I, for one, am a vegetarian, and had he taken 2 seconds to ask a few questions, he wouldn't have had to run through all the suckling pig options.   What was worse, however, was having an unfinished $13 cocktail snatched up before it was finished, and being told that their ""coffee machine"" was ""broken"" and they didn't really ""do"" spanish coffees anyway.... and the manager went to Starbucks to get us coffee.   Had they given us the choice, we would not have ordered Starbucks coffee at Mercat for $5/cup.   I like that they are so business savvy that they made a profit from that coffee sale, but annoyed so much so that I was in too big of a hurry (to get to the symphony on time) that I didn't want to further deal with Wesley.   His continual response to each table's requests within our earshot ""No problem"" seemed more like he thought he was doing everyone favors for waiting on them/us.  Not a memorable experience, but one that did in fact detract from our overall rating of our dinner.   Whatever your pleasure, request a server who knows his/her Catalan soul, and not one that is more interested in cranking out % of customers per minute.",0.9245,0.82,0.114,0.066,0.5144927536231884

Now onto the food: starter: Bread rubbed with tomato, garlic and herbs Octopus and potato Then we had these little balls of cheese, chorizo, deep fried over a roasted pepper sauce-I forget what they were called, but all I know is they rocked.  Fig salad, bleu cheese, wrapped in prosciutto--this was fantastic Prawns a la Planxa (suck-the-juice-from-the -head-delicious)--I went somewhere far away while eating those.  YUM.  Special of the evening: homemade lamb sausage and feta black lentils, chickpeas, and feta Dessert was a cross between chocolate pot du creme, creme brulee, and vanilla ice cream, with espresso granita on top.  A mixture of all of my favorite things in one bowl--too bad I had to share :)  We'd definitely return, bring some friends, and try the suckling pig.  It was a great night, expect to pay approx $100/pp ""all-in""  We also heard about their brunch--$25, 5 tapas, and unlimited bloodymary bar?

2010-10-11,3.0,"Let me preface by saying I've been here twice.  The first time was several months ago and I thought it was really good.  The second time was less than desirable. So I'll review the times separately since I had two totally different experiences. The first time I went, we had a group of about 10 people.  Tapas isn't really meant to accommodate large groups since the portions are small but we ordered a few things for the table and the individual things we wanted to try.  Our waitress was very good and extremely helpful.  She made sure anything we ordered individually got put right in front of us and that we knew it was ours.  The patatas bravas are the main reason to come here and I wasn't disappointed.  I also enjoyed the cheeses - if you're with a group, get the Mixto platter to share.  It's chef's choice (I wish you were able to pick which three you wanted to sample) but I haven't been disappointed with the chef's choices yet.  The atmosphere was wonderful, the sangria was delicious and we had a great time.  We were also given a few freebies on the chef that were delicious, which I thought was a nice touch. I recently visited Mercat again, this time with 4 other people.  This experience was much different.  They seated us at a table meant for 8 people, even though there were plenty of other smaller tables available (we had a 10pm reservation) and the music was way too loud to try to hold a conversation.  Our waiter stood at the opposite end of the table and we could barely hear him.  When our food was brought out, it was mostly just dumped in the middle of the table even though we'd ordered specific things for ourselves and no one really said was anything was or if they did, we couldn't hear them.  I ordered the bacon wrapped dates for myself and the portion was smaller than I remembered so I thought it was a freebie from the chef and told my friends to eat them because I was waiting for mine.  A friend's dish was also brought out with the complimentary dish from the chef and no one told us what it was so we ended up eating his dish as well.  We had ordered patatas bravas and they never showed.  When the waiter came by later, we asked him where the rest of our food was and he told us they were out of patatas bravas and that all our other food had been brought out.  We were pretty disappointed by the time we left. At some point, I'll probably give it another chance but the last experience totally evened out the awesome experience I had the first time I ate at Mercat.  I do have to say though, the white wine sangria is delicious.",0.9978,0.803,0.173,0.024,0.4736081716637272

Patatas bravas, different try to eat them around the edges since it was very hot (temp) inside.  I don't know if it was shaped with mash potatoes, but the sauce was not hot enough for my taste.  Hard to do a traditional dish with a new twist and please everybody. All other appetizers were also very good, tasty with a small portions.  After all it is a ""tasting"" menu. The lamb chop was perfect, rare and caramelized with a long bone to get a hold of it. So was the beef, very rare indeed.  Which was fine for most of us.  Did not miss the mint jelly with the lamb, as was my favorite. We had the vanilla ice Cream with expresso, wrapped in a caramelized sugar bowl.  Nice presentation but we would skip it next time.  Nothing else on the desert menu seem interesting to me, but I am partial when it comes to traditional spanish desserts, nothing beats my mother's home cooking by far.  We left a generous tip 25% because of the superb service.",0.9956,0.772,0.213,0.015,0.6112032412032412

Clever guy, I knew there was a reason to keep him around! We had a special prix-fixe menu with multiple courses that was incredibly reasonable at less than $50 each, with alcohol up to our own choosing. They also allowed us to bring in some of our own wine, which was very kind. We more than made up the difference in cocktails and a generous gratuity which should be standard for those who BYOB in an establishment with a good wine list. Remember that, people, it's only fair to the staff! I should mention first that the space itself is gorgeous. Great energy, high (HIGH!) ceilings, and Spanish music that was at the appropriate volume. Small bar area, which is unfortunate for those without reservations or waiting on their late-comers.  And now, the star of the show, the food. Oh, the food: The tapas were delicious and filling. We ordered, ala carte, a cheese course before our menu began and feasted all evening. The cheeses were wonderful and well appointed with pairings of jams and savory tapenades. Plenty of bread. Our first course consisted of pan con tomate, truita de patata con espinacas, and ensalada verdosa. Translated (for your reading pleasure) that means we started with bruschetta, a clever potato/spinach omelette that was delicious and hard to describe, and a green salad. Plenty to go around. Second course was gambas al ajillo, costillas de ternera, and datiles con almendras. Essentially, it was shrimp in a bubbling garlic oil, beef shortribs tapas-style, and bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with almonds. OH EM GEE. Those dates and shortribs haunt my dreams. Frankly, by the time we got to our third course which was chicken and chiorizo paella (paella valenciana), we were stuffed and it was actually anticlimactic. I nevertheless ate my share (what can I say, I'm a trooper!) and was very thankful that the kitchen was willing to take care of our non-meat eaters in the group by preparing alternatives to the paella and bringing extra non-meat tapas throughout the first two courses. That's just a major sign of class. Our server (who was the BEST) patiently took photos of our entire group and did an all-around outstanding job. And then they brought us the croquetas de xocolata, which have this marshmallowy banana in them as well as the chocolate, with candles for my birthday boy. Of course we all sang for him and embarrassed him thoroughly. It's only fair.

Mercat is just a wonderful dining experience.  Wifey and I celebrated our anniversary there last night and I just had to rave for a few minutes.   Eddie, our waiter, was outstanding, really brought it home for us.  He was knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the menu, but not in a pretentious or intimidating way.  If you are going to Mercat, especially for a special occasion, ask for Eddie's section.  Also, tell them that you are celebrating, two years in a row we've gotten a seat next to one of the Michigan Avenue-facing windows for an awesome view.   And now the food (not a total breakdown, just what we had last night) Queso - Monte Enebro - get this, it is super. Tapas de Siempre - Datiles con Almendras & Pulpo con Patatas - I don't eat these myself, but Wifey's eyes glaze over while eating these.

Fideos - Pelotas de Calabaza y Cordero - I would step over my own mother to get these and sort of forget my own name for a minute after eating them. Carnes - Tocina con Cidra - Melt in your mouth good, an amazing blend of flavors. Pescados - Mar I Muntanya II - ordered on a whim, had me over the moon. Verduras - Patatas Bravas - the only disappointing part of the meal but that is definitely because we were in Spain in May, I remember LOVING these last year, this year - not as much.

Be warned, it is pricier then your standard Chicago tapas restaurant for dinner.  But the food is worth every penny and the portions are enough to fill you up if your order the amount recommended by the server.  The sangrias are different and very good as well.   The atmosphere is very ""clubby"", but has different areas to choose from.  We were at a table ""upstairs"" that was a bit weird to get to, but then gave us more privacy and quiet.  They also have outdoor seating if you desire.",0.9604,0.84,0.141,0.019,0.6459798534798534

The only bummer is that the tasting menu doesn't come with dessert or a sparkling wine and it is kind of loud in there.  We went on a Monday night and it was almost packed full.  The decor is nice and swanky though, and the service is excellent.",0.9744,0.765,0.202,0.032,0.6982142857142858

I felt like I was eating in a huge aircraft hanger filled with screaming nursery school children.  Added to this noise was pounding music with a relentless dance beat.  The place is a dining room--not a 1980s disco for heaven's sake!  My party of five was also seated around a huge table--so that any conversation was impossible.  Our poor waitress and waiter--who were more than excellent--had to yell to be heard.  I hate to think what their throats must feel like at the end of their shift.  The food was good-if uneven.  Sometimes it was fabulous.  Unfortunately it came out of the kitchen with very strange pacing--so that dishes that were ordered together (for a reason) came out at very different times and the intense flavors of the small plates often warred with each other.  The service was wonderfully gracious--we were given generous samples of a number of wines before we chose our bottle--and the waitress noticed and accomodated my nephew's teenage metabolism.  It is a shame that this graciousness was nearly negated by the assaultive atmosphere--and that interesting, and expensive, food could not be appreciated fully.",0.9682,0.727,0.178,0.095,0.5778061224489797

The Arroz a la Cazuela was a solid dish.  The saffron added a great aroma to the broth, and the flavor was subtle, but not hidden.  I didn't care too much for the artichoke confit--the shrimp, chicken, and chorizo, when eaten with the aioli, blew that away.  My second dish was essentially house made sausage with with truffled white beans.  The white beans knocked my socks off.  They were the best beans I had ever had.  The accompanying fries were well cooked, the but the aioli wasn't too memorable. For desert, a friend and I split the chocolate croquettes with banana marshmallow.  My friend loved the croquettes--she devoured hers so fast, but I didn't enjoy them as much as I did the marshmallows with caramel.  Silky smooth with rich banana flavor  . . . highly recommended.  Don't let the olive oil turn you off of this desert--it adds a nice contrasting flavor to this dish.  I will definitely visit Mercat when I'm in Chicago again . . . I can't seem about to forget those delicious truffled white beans . . .

2010-08-08,4.0,"I really wanted to love this place and it came really close but just didn't quite do it for me. First of all, went there for the 25 dollar brunch special with a couple of friends and I'd like to start by saying that even without this awesome special that allowed me to load up on sangrias (more on that later), their food prices appeared very reasonable for their brunch items.  Most plates were five or fewer dollars normally.  Now, these are tapas plates, but I'm used to spending a lot more for a tapas plate at most places of this caliber. The food was good, but not life changing like I had hoped for from a iron chef Jose Garces restaurant.  Some dishes were on the very good (but again, not life changing side) such as the bacon wrapped dates, the eggs with truffle butter covered bread and the two open face type sandwich dishes I had (had the suckling pig and the short ribs, the short ribs being the better of the two by a slim margin).  Others were downright bad: we had some sort of fish dish which had the consistency similar to mashed potatoes which was so salty it was kind of disgusting, also the pimentos left a lot to be desired.   On food alone this might have been a 3 star experience, though I think I would still be willing to check it out for dinner as I suspect that possibly their brunch menu isn't their A-game.  Luckily, however, I went with the white sangria which was hands down the best sangria I've ever had.  It was perfectly sweet and didn't really suffer from the dry wine mouthfeel you often get with sangria.  You could easily go to brunch and make the $25 dollars worth it in just sangria if you wanted to.   I liked the ambiance of the place, it was modern and well lit which was great for brunch.  My friends and I all came pretty casual and didn't feel the slightest bit out of place (the bussers were running around in t-shirts so definitely not stuffy in there).  The music was spanish inspired and interesting, not overly loud.  Tables seemed a bit close together, not sure if it would have felt a little crowded had the place been full (we went at 2pm so things were dying down).  Service was ok, I expected our server to be a little more forthcoming with suggestions and I went a while with an empty glass at one point in the meal, but it wasn't bad and when asked the server was knowledgeable about the menu and made sure I got a last glass of sangria when he brought the check so I was happy with the service by the end of the meal.

2010-07-30,4.0,"I must say I am a tapas snob. The beauty of tapas is that you get a taste of many different dishes. That, however, is the downfall of tapas at the same time. Since they are smaller portions the dish has to be made perfectly... there are only a couple bites that determine whether the dish is good or not.  With that in mind... Mercat is the best Spanish style tapas that I have had in the city. All the dishes we ordered were very good... not bland or cold or over cooked, all of which are easy to do with tapas. I must make two specific recommendations on the behalf of my date and I... we LOVED the scallops (and he is typically a meat guy) A La Planxa and the Chocolate Croquettes for desert. If you go... try both... you will not be disappointed.  By the way...

Service - the service was decent.  It wasn't overly great.  Maybe for a more upscale restaurant like this we should have had a little better service.  One of the girls we were with had nut allergies and we told them that if there was nuts in the plate or in the sauce to just tell us and she would just not eat it.  They brought out the bacon wrapped dates with the almonds with no warning and she was about to eat it.  Thankfully someone at the table cut into it first and warned her.  Close call!

2010-07-06,4.0,"I met up with two friends for dinner at Mercat a la Planxa, Chicago's only Catalan restaurant, on South Michigan Avenue. I was up on North Michigan between work and dinner and I thought ""oh, I'll just walk down for dinner."" Right. That's a long walk from Chicago Avenue. I ended up arriving wet from the rain, blistered from my shoes, hot, late, and frazzled. My friends were having drinks in the bar and I joined them for one before we headed up for dinner. Nothing like booze to calm the nerves. Mercat a la Planxa's bar is on the first floor, street level. The dining room is one floor up. I didn't realize beforehand that the restaurant is located in the Blackstone Hotel. The interior is really beautiful. Warm colors. Modern touches. I thought it was cool how the kitchen is wide open, making it almost part of the decor, a show of the process. Chef Jose Garces is the the owner of Mercat a la Planxa. I'd heard of him from the Food Network, where he won the Next Iron Chef challenge. Think what you like about the Food Network and it's challenges, but Chef Garces also won the James Beard Award for best mid-atlantic chef. Our waitress that night was a firecracker. And really good at her job. Funny, but not trying too hard. Friendly. And she knew her stuff too. She mentioned to us that Chef Jose Garces was in the kitchen. I commented that I was suprised, since he owns 6 restaurants in Philadelphia and only one in Chicago. Our waitress said Chef is in Chicago a lot and told us that he's from Chicago and attended Lane Tech and Kendall College. For dinner we decided to split 6 small plates and a pitcher of the seasonal sangria. We were first served tomato bread, which was so light and fresh and delicious. Next up we got the chef's selection of 3 cheeses. Each of these cheese were served with a special side. The goat cheese was paired with a garlic dulce de leche. The sheep cheese with a orange marmalade. The cow's milk cheese came with a pistachio truffle side. So good. The pairings were right on and just as delicious as the cheese itself. Next we had some delicious croquetas of potato and cheese with some jamon (ham) inside. We also had pimentos de padron, flash fried padron peppers with salbitxada and sea salt. The croquetas were very rich and salty, but in small little pops, were so good. My friend had a dish similar to the peppers somewhere in New York and ordered them to compare. She said the ones at Mercat were better than the ones she had in NY. We were loving this food so far. So it was no surprise, after eating this deliciousness, pondering over how local the Chef is and how much he's accomplished, we were forming little foodie crushes. We looked up and Chef Garces was standing next to our table talking to a few people. Someone at our table may have made some saucy gestures behind Chef's back and been really embarassed when our sassy waitress called her out. May have happened. Or may have just been a sangria daydream.. but it would be quite a coincidence then when we saw the waitress talk to Chef and then when he came over to our table to introduce himself. Blush blush blush! Ahem. Back to the food.... It was coming out fast and furious at this point. We had the pinones con boquerones, which was a flatbread with white anchovies, pancetta, goat cheese and marinated pine nuts. We also had some slow-cooked pork belly with cider glaze, green apples and truffle. There was also a dish with mussels. All very very good. For dessert we had croquetes de xocolata - milk chocolate croquettes with banana marshmallow, rosemary caramel and arbequina olive oil. OMG. These were so good. There were six little croquetes and I remember sitting and talking a bit before eating my first when my friend interrupted me and yelled to just eat it already because she had eaten hers and it was THAT good. My other friend was making a face while she ate hers. I couldn't tell if it was pain or pleasure. Turned out that's just how good they were. Make sure you get this dessert if you visit Mercat. The food at Mercat a la Planxa was really well done. Great dinner. And not too expensive. We were stuffed at the end and including the drinks, the bill was about $45/person.

I choose the split-pea soup with truffle oil (delicious, and generous portion) as well as the hangar steak sandwich with caramelized onions and a balsamic reduction. The sandwich was perfectly European, and having been to Barcelona twice, was a very Spanish portion...and perfect. It tasted delicious and I would recommend both dishes.

2010-06-21,5.0,"Maybe I am lucky and my first visit to restaurants end up wildly successful.  Apparently, it happened again.   The wife and I decided to celebrate our first anniversary by trying out Mercat.  We weren't sure what we were going to do so we just threw caution to the wind and did the Chef's tasting menu with wine pairings.  At $85 per person, it's not cheap, but this was a special occasion so we went for it.  Holy jeez.  This was the steal of a lifetime!  12 bountiful courses with 3 different wines.  We honestly expected 12 amuse-bouche courses.  Instead, the portions were large and delicious!  But let me take a step back... When making the reservations, I mentioned that it was our anniversary.  Our waitress (who was beyond awesome) brought us complimentary cava and what could be described as Spanish bruschetta.  Both were absolutely perfect.  The flavors matched perfectly.   I'll preface the description of the meal by saying that I don't recall the names of the wines that were paired.  What I can say is that they matched perfectly with the food, melding one course with another.   As for the food, we had the following dishes:  cadi urgelia, serrano ham & fig salad, some sort of Gazpacho with salmon roe and pork belly, truita de patata con espinacas, croquetas de bacalao, datiles con almendras, gambas al ajillo, costillas de ternera, conill amb chestnut, coles de bruselas (with lentils, I think), imperial wagyu short ribs and diver scallops.   Again, everything was well sized and delicious.  By the end of the meal, I asked the waitress if we were finally done since my stomach didn't have any additional room.  This must be a common question because she brought out soda water with bitters and said that it would make us feel much better and less full.  Guess what...It worked!!!  I'm putting that down as a trick from now on!   Honestly, the whole experience we had was above and beyond.  It's not a cheap date but I think we got every penny's worth.   I would absolutely recommend Mercat to others.",0.9956,0.814,0.163,0.023,0.5674836601307189
2010-06-20,5.0,"Always reliable...but how do I get to this statement? First, let me state that I am not a big fan of Spanish Tapas because in general tend to not be vegetarian friendly (very meat reliant dishes) nor tasty (spices are not incorporated into dishes well). Also, I am bias in favor for this place because a good friend (Patty, bartender) works there and hooked me to this spot. But I have taken my mother there for her birthday, first dates, business associates, and even had a small gathering of friends for an early birthday dining outing. But the service is also knowledgeable, attentive, cooperative (if you are a vegetarian just tell them an idea for an alternative to a menu selection), and prompt. But it is what they serve that always is dependable...well seasoned food, that is full of flavor. Who knew spanish tapas could be so full of life and color?! The Spanish omelette is a must as are the jalapeno peppers! The cheese selections are always incredible with their separate dipping sauce. The chocolate croquettes with marshmallows is unbelievable.   My guest typically are drawn to the large prawns, octopus, or the chef selection of meats. The sangria is something special as well. Although the restaurant is large it tends to not get too loud in there unless you go downstairs to the lounge on a Friday night.  Highly recommended! One",0.9463,0.877,0.098,0.025,0.4493849206349206
2010-06-20,2.0,"The ""Meh, I've experienced better,"" rating sums up my experience for Mercat to a T.  I went for the Sunday Brunch this morning, $25 gets you 4 items off of the tapas menu and bottomless cocktails, or 5 items and no booze.  I'm not one for 11am alcohol so I went for the 5, although I tried a few of the cocktails others had at the table. I found the food to be overly oily, and greasy. The bread used on the sandwich entrees seemed to be bussed in or bought at costco, it wasn't anything to write home about.  I've had shrimp and grits down in the gulf region and loved it. I know there's butter in grits, I know thats what you have to do to make them palatable. This place apparently felt the need to throw two or three sticks of the stuff in. The chorizo hash was heavily overdone.  The garlic shrimp seemed to be a bit underdone.  I tried to like this place, I really did. The  cocktails I tried seemed to follow the old adage ""how much sugar can I put int this before they notice there's not discernible taste?"" I skipped the deserts, although for $4 for unlimited trips up there, it probably was the best value.   I bring this up for this reason, and this reason alone. I was charged $4 for about 8oz of weak iced coffee. $4. It didn't taste like anything special, for all I know it could've been folgers or store bought ground starbucks. I don't know why I was so blown away by this. As for the ambiance of the place, nice location, although it seemed that four or five different interior designers had fought over the space, and few things seemed to go hand in hand, in a non-ironic way.

The staff: our waiter seemed to whisper a bunch, seriously.  we could barely hear him.  Tables were far too close together as staff kept knocking into my fiance - without apology - and he was sitting in a non-traffic lane.  Our waiter also spilled my mom's sangria on her, as well as dumping another into the purse of a lady behind us, and blamed the glass, stating it had a ""small bottom"". The food: I cringe as I type it, but I've had better tapas from the tourist trap Ba-Ba-Ree-Ba.  Or Iberico, or People or any number of tapas places I've been to.  For an Iron Chef, the menu was singularly uninspired and boring.  It all looked and sounded interesting, but the taste was often flat. The get 2 stars where they should have 1 because: we did the ""chef's selection"" and they made sure I had a substitute for every seafood dish they brought out, which was a really nice gesture on their part because I don't eat seafood.",-0.8512,0.814,0.076,0.11,0.6651944444444445
2010-06-06,2.0,"I would not recommend dining here. If it were only a matter of the food, my rec would probably be to give it a shot. In fact, we had a number of very tasty dishes. The short rib flat bread, pork belly, mushrooms, and black lentil concoction were all stand-outs. The starter meat plate was very weak (they choose three jamons or something similar for you - none was particularly good); the halibut was not that flavorful nor were the mussels. We did enjoy the desserts a lot. Terrible brewed coffee; the Golden Nugget's is better. However....as a dining experience I wanted to get the hell out of there as quickly as possible, as did everyone at the table. A lot of things to note:  * It was a very rainy night and generally S Michigan Ave is a dumpy location for a nice restaurant (maybe all the tourists around don't know better) but no valet parking that we could identify; in retrospect maybe the Blackstone hotel (where it's located) had it but the point is it wasn't in front of the restaurant and we circled for street parking.  * As several other reviewers noted, it was way too noisy and pounding house music wore us down through the evening (I actually like house music when it's a great mix; this was really generic). The place was the opposite of hip (if that's what they were going for): it was mostly older couples (guilty!) and a bunch of tourists in shorts and golf shirts (at 8pm on a Saturday, I just don't get that) who probably stumbled over from the Hilton & Towers next door. * The menu was really hard to figure out. I mean, really confusing. Hard to describe without actually seeing it and then having it explained for 10 minutes. Supposedly ""everything"" was small plate and there was supposed to be some sort of progression (we were told three stages, but nothing on the menu would suggest that), but then you had meats at 3-4 different parts of the menu and generally the price range on these small plates was massive, ranging from ~ $6 to ~ $50. We got it but it took too long. It also led to other problems.... * The service was very mixed. Oddly the restaurant had very few bus boys so it was our server who was always filling our waters. More importantly, we had dirty plates and silverware (this is small plate tapas with lots of different flavors/sauces coming at us) sitting in front of us with no one coming by for more than 10-15 minutes. At one point I insisted on a clean plate and the helper we found brought just one for me and not the others at the table. Re the menu-related issues, we ordered WAY too much because our server pushed more and more food. Not having any sense from the menu of sizing, we ordered a ton and somewhat predictably walked out too stuffed. She seemed to be going by a script that we had to order a certain amount of food at each stage and was a bit aggressive about it. Most aggravating, she kept pushing that we order the $45 8 oz. wagyu beef dish or the $48 lamb chops (four small chops), which by the way were listed up near the small starters and not near the mains at the bottom (?). If she tried to up-sell it once, but it was more than once and as our wives noted, it was all too pushy. For a bunch of reasons, don't eat here.",-0.7533,0.89,0.047,0.063,0.4773386243386241

2010-05-01,3.0,"Well, our meal was tasty, though I would have to say that some of the dishes were a little off. The decor is beautiful but there is pulsing, loud music the whole time. If you don't like eating to a beat, you better not go in this restaurant.  We had paella negra, which was very tasty and seafoody, but much too salty. However, when I bit into a big chunk of octopus I felt like I was hanging out in a tide pool in the sun. It was a most delicious feeling, though I got only two big chunks of octopus.  We also had some goat's milk cheese with green apple slices and garlic dulce de leche. I know, garlic? Dulce de leche? It was so good that I didn't understand why no one else was putting garlic in their dulce de leche.  We also had rabbit in homemade pasta. Mike had to convince me because, you know, rabbits, but this was my favorite dish. It came out with foam (I love that, Mike doesn't), with brandied cherries under (I was worried they'd be too sweet but they were not) and brown butter sauce and pureed chestnuts all over. It was delish. It was so delish that I sat there and ate the sauce with my fork while my boyfriend sat there and judged me. The only issue was that the rabbit was a little tough, though I understand that's the name of the game with... game.  For desert I had chocolate mouse with some sort of crackly hazelnut and sugar shell, espresso hanging out in the shell, and sweet cream gelato on top. It was good, but unlike all the other dishes it was too big to finish. So, a good meal but I would have been happier paying about half as much for it, as it had issues. Mike and I each had a (pretty small and unremarkable) glass of sangria, we had three dishes, dessert, and an after-dinner cocktail for Mike. It came to around $80 without tip. By the way, the service was really stellar. But don't get indigestion or drink too much water, because the bathroom is all the way downstairs.",0.9952,0.823,0.153,0.024,0.5213235294117646

2010-04-23,5.0,"Holy moly, the food here is sooooo good!  Every bite, every morsel, was delish!  I went here for the first time with a group of 6 and we were seated at a great table right by the 2 story window with views of Grant Park.  We ordered a bunch of plates to share as a table - after all, this is a tapas place, you gotta share! Our waiter was very attentive and started us off with some tomato bread (kind of like a spanish bruschetta).  The unique and robust flavor was due to sherry vinegar.  Yum!  And we began with a pitcher of the red sangria...very good and a MUST!   Our tapas meal started off with my all-time favorite -  Datiles con Almendras (bacon wrapped dates stuffed with almonds).  Omg, the sauce they put pour on top when the bring it to your table is yummy!  Then we had the Gambas al Ajillo (garlic shrimp).  I'm not much of a shrimp person so I didn't try this one, but I'll have to take my friends word for it that it was good as well.  After that, we had the Gambas con Garbanzos (flatbread with shrimp, chorizo & garbanzo bean puree).  Wow...very flavorful and just wonderful!  The next dish was  Albondigas de Venera (scallop & shrimp meatballs, marinated grapes & shaved idiazabal).  This was probably my favorite dish of the night.  The texture of the meatball was amazing...very smooth.  And the grapes added just the right amount of acidity to this dish.  I wanted to soak up the sauce that was left in the dish it was so good!  That dish was the fastest to empty.  We also ordered Patatas Bravas (spicy potatoes with spicy paprika aioli) and that was tasty too...nothing too different than other places that I've been to in taste/flavor, but the presentation was beautiful (all of the dishes were presented beautifully; very simple and classy).  The Setas al Horno (wild mushrooms, confit potato, shallot & parsley dish) was amazing too.  The flavor they pulled from the mushrooms was outstanding... very savory.  The last tapas dish we had was Tocino con Cidra (slow-cooked pork belly, cider glaze, green apples & truffle).  This was my secondfavorite dish of the night.  The dish had this parsnip puree on it that was to die for!  Such a great textural addition to the dish.  And the green apple & truffle salad was a nice and light compliment to the savory, flavorful, well-balanced pork belly.  Melt in your mouth wonderfulness. We ended the meal with a fantastic sweet note.  Croquetas De Xocolata (milk chocolate croquettes, banana marshmallow, rosemary caramel, arbequina olive oil). You have to try this!  Talk about an experience! I highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend this place.  It's a bit pricey, more than Cafe Iberico, but I think it's worth it.  I loved every dish that we ordered.  And there are so many more on the menu that I am dying to come back and try!  The sexy ambiance with high ceilings, swanky decor, and friendly staff makes it a great place for a date or a get together with friends.  Our waiter, Fred, was especially awesome.  So attentive and friendly.  He made a point to explain everything that came to the table.  You could tell he believed in the food, supported the chef, and loved working at this restaurant.  Just listening to his descriptions of each dish made your mouth water!

2010-04-08,4.0,"I've only recently went for breakfast at Mercat on a weekday morning, but I've also had dinner here numerous times since it opened.  So this write up will be for both. Ok so breakfast first.  There were only 3 tables in the entire place, including us.  Mornings are definitely a very different vibe here.  The whole place is very quiet, and really gives you a chance to soak in the gorgeous room, and the gorgeous view outside.  We had the Two Eggs scrambled, with rosemary-apple sausage, and the Eggs Benedict.  The eggs were light and fluffy.  The sausages were 2 glistening vermillion patties.  I almost thought it was chorizo.  Very flavorful but mild (although I was expecting spicy seeing the way it looks).  The Eggs Benedict (eggs, chorizo, toasted brioche, truffled hollandaise) was one of the most decadent Benedicts I've ever tasted.  The hollandaise was such a concentrated blend of yolk and dairy, and hints of truffle kept lingering.  Both dishes came with a breakfast potato that was very creative.  It was basically a shredded potato cake.  Think latkes or hash brown, but in cake form.  Bits of rosemary assault the taste buds.  My only one grip is with coffee (which was called Royal Cup).  It was pretty bland and boring.  Give me Intelligentsia or Metropolis. At dinner time, Mercat takes on a very sexy and fun vibe.  If you enter from the street, you will probably hang out at the tiny lounge downstairs first.  Excellent cocktails, try the seasonal sangria if you are so inclined.  When your table is ready, walk up the spiral staircase to the wonderful dining room.  High, high ceiling; mirrored and stenciled walls; the semi circular set up reminds one of a supper club; and then, the large windows looking outside to great views of Grant Park. They have various tapas size dishes, as well as larger plates.  Some all-time favorites include:  Pimientos de padron, flash fried peppers in a Catalan sauce.  Reminds me of Japanese shishito peppers.  Croquetas de bacalao, pillowy soft salt cod fritters in a piquant sauce.  Datiles con almendras.  At this point for me, nobody can beat the dates at Avec.  These ones at Mercat is a close second.  The cabrales sauce drizzled on top is very creative.  Pulpo con patatas.  Nothing like the garden variety octopus dish you get at any other Spanish restaurant.  Tender confit of octopus and potato.  Paella Negra.  A little (teeny tiny) skillet of squid ink tinted rice, with all the goodness from the sea.  The cauliflower gratin.  Thin shaved slices of cauliflower, crunchy almonds, in a sea of cream and truffles. Cocas, or flatbreads, are another signature dish.  A relatively small platform housing rich and decadent flavors.  My favorites are the short ribs, and the clam and bacon.  The Ala Planxa items are always good.  Simple, well seasoned, tasty.  A few standouts are the chipirones (baby calamari), barramundi, hamachi, and lamb chops.  Service is ok.  Not too cheerfully annoying, although it could border on perfunctory at times, especially when they are packed.   Why 4 stars?  Mercat is definitely a night-out place.  Sexy vibe, gorgeous room, fun atmosphere, beautiful clientele.  I think many people have the misconception that this is a tapas restaurant, therefore comparing Mercat to Café Iberico or Meson Sabika.  Wrong, people.  Apples and oranges.  For me, Mercat is a modern Spanish restaurant serving creative Catalan food.  Yes, the portions could be small, and prices are high for the portion size.  But factor in the creative tasty food and great ambience, you will have a fun evening.",0.9993,0.755,0.222,0.023,0.5609206349206349

The atmosphere in general is a little ""hip"" for me- but it was also a Friday.  The restaurant itself is very pretty.  I love the decor and the high vaulted ceilings.  We waited about 20 minutes after our reservation time (so not too bad). After being seated we were brought a crunchy bruschetta like bite- this was fabulous. Next we ordered wine and some starters. I asked the server to recommend me a dry white wine. She chose the most expensive glass on the menu which ended up being sweet. My husband ordered a middle of the road temperanillo which he enjoyed. We ordered the olives, the sardine dish, and the bacon wrapped figs. We loved these three dishes (although my husband thought the bacon figs were a little too sweet). Next we ordered the brussel sprouts, the patatas bravas and the pork belly. The brussel sprouts tasted as though they were drenched in oranges. The patatas bravas tasted fake- we hated them. The pork belly was really tasty. We finished with the chocolate croquetas which were not very good- tasted like the outside of a mozzarella stick with a yucky chocolate inside.

Fantastic. Really. Yum. Maybe the night my husband and I went was just an off night? We actually came for our first anniversary dinner. I LOVE Catalan food. I've lived in Gava Mar, el Masnou and Barcelona and I'm just a big fan of Catalan cuisine. I've been wanting to try Mercat for awhile. My husband made a reservation for our special occasion. Really lame that we were seated with no privacy squished next to another couple. If a guest makes a point of making a reservation, just give them a table. There were tables available. We asked to move after a few minutes because it was so uncomfortable. Still not the best location, but at least we had a window on one side and weren't stuffed between two parties. Whatever, it's about the food. The wine was good. We ordered a lovely bottle of Rioja. The short ribs and scallops that I ordered were pretty good. Half of the short ribs were way too salty though. We ordered about 5 more dishes, but I don't remember anymore. In general, very good. Creative plating. That serrano spinach salad stood out though. If I come back, that'll be part of the reason.  It was a nice night overall because it was a special night for us and we were determined to make it so. If I had been with other company though, I think I would have had less patience. The service was horrible. Our waiter was friendly but honestly we never saw him. He took foreverrrrr to take our orders and never came back after that. We had to literally flag him down if we needed something. SUCH slow service. We were done eating for awhile and just talking thinking our waiter would show up with a dessert menu.....but after awhile, again realized we'd have to flag him down. Fine, did it. Literally takes him 10 minutes to reappear with the dessert menus. Yes, about the same time line to take our order..... Well, I really wanted to love this place. Like I said, I love Catalan food...it has a special place in my heart. I wanted this to be a great first anniversary dinner. I'd say we had a great night...but not particularly due to Mercat.

Have to say I'm really happy we did. Starting with service - bartender, waitress, servers - they're all friendly, helpful, and have a great attitude.

Delicious cheese plate; mushroom soup was AMAZING; loved the salad; desserts were all top-notch (maybe too rich after all the delicious food!) I can't comment on the meat/seafood items but everybody seemed pleased (I think they had scallops, short ribs, and a few other things) The problem was with our waiter. We were a group of 20-something grad students out for a prix fixe- maybe he assumed we would be bad tippers? In any case, he seemed very frazzled and inattentive. My salad didn't come for close to 20 minutes, at which point I had to flag down a bus boy to ask for it. Nonetheless, I worked in the food service industry for long enough that I tip 20% standard unless something is *really* wrong. So I did. We had spread the tab equally across 5 credit cards; I quietly tipped a couple dollars more than the others (who, it should be noted, were all tipping at least 15%). At the end of the meal, our waiter came to the table where he blatantly read our credit cards slips RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. ummm what? I'm no Emily Post, but that is some bad etiquette. He then said, very pointedly, ""thank you [my name]"" to me alone, and left. Last I checked, you thank people for patronizing your restaurant when they could have chosen to go any number of places, NOT because you consider their tip sufficient for your (frankly sub-par) service.

2010-03-14,5.0,"This month's dining excursion coincided with the arrival of some friends. Mercat a la Planxa, which features an Iron Chef, is a Catalonia-based Spanish Tapas place. We all went with the prix-fixe menu, which featured an amazing array of food. Our service throughout was exemplary, which is not something I have come to expect from Chicago eateries. The decor was rather over-the-top and somewhat 70's feeling, with a sunken dining room, making the bar and kitchen look elevated. The Chef Jose Garces was walking around, talking to the various tables throughout the night, which was very nice. Course #1:  We started with a Bruschetta-esque entree on thick toasted bread. It literally hit all five tastes, and was of a sufficient enough portion that one slice was enough for several bites worth of this. I actually liked it a lot better than bruschetta, because it had an excellent array of spices on it.  Additionally, they served very thinly sliced Chorizo sausage along with a light mustard, sliced yellow peppers, and gerkins. The chorizo was flavorful but not overpowering, and sliced so thinly that it didn't end up being filling. Also, they served us little dumpling-sized bits of a ""Spanish Omelette with Spinach, Potatoes, & Saffron Aioli"" -- this was just amazing, and even one of our friends, who truly hates spinach, ate this. It didn't actually taste very spinachy, but it was incredibly savory and while not particularly omelette-y, you could taste the eggs and potatoes very well. The aioli was a small dollop, but enough to be delicious. They also served us Manchego cheese along with a sherry/bacon powder sauce that I personally didn't like, but everyone else adored. Finally, they brought out fried pimientos de padrom, with salbixada and sea salt -- small green peppers with a very, very light mustard sauce. I'm pretty sure I ate half the allotted amount. Course #2:   We were served dates, wrapped in bacon, stuffed with crushed almonds, and then for the final decadence, a cheese fondue sauce was poured over the top.  They then brought out ""Patatas Bravas"" -- spicy potatoes with spicy paprika aioli. Seriously, these were one of the best items of the night -- tiny little bundles of mmmmm.  They served us ""Arroz con morels"" -- morel mushroom bomba rice, fava beans, green asparagus & lemon oil. An odd consistency, but seriously delicious. Then, they brought out ""Gambas al Ajillo"" -- simply, garlic in browned butter, served BOILING. The shrimp was hella hot, but sooo good in the simple butter. I used the toast the served it with to sop up the sauce, and would have poured it into my mouth directly if I could have done it and not looked like a TOTAL idiot. They served us a flatbread, ""Costillas de ternera"" -- beef shortribs, horseradish, parmeson and bacon. As one of our friends said in surprise, ""Hey, this has a bit of a bite!"" -- it was an incredibly complex bit of food in terms of taste, with a bit of spicy, a bit of tart, a bit of everything. SO GOOD. Additionally, they served us ""Conill amb chesnut"" -- braised rabbit agnolotti, Rosemary, Truffle-Chestnut Puree, and brandied cherries. This was very ravioli-i, with a very interesting foam on top (the puree) that had a lot more flavor than you'd expect. Course #3:  For the main course, which doesn't have the awesome descriptions that the above head but does not take away the amazing quality of the food, we had: ""Colorado rack of lamb"", which I am pretty sure everyone at the table pronounced as the best lamb they'd ever had; Some sort of beef-related product (we can't figure out if it was skirt steak, short ribs, or what; we are pretty sure though that it was the short ribs; and prawns, which were served with heads and tails attached (though I pulled 'em off, 'cause... yeah.) And then there was dessert. Course #4: We had SIX types of sorbet (approximately 2 teaspoons of each): Turkish Fig, Dulce de Leche, Chocolate Peppermint, Milk Stout, Apricot, and Coconut. Chocolate croquettes with creme anglais (AMAZING) A chocolate mousse goopy thing with vanilla ice cream on a wafer An orange creme with some sort of citrus compote (that orange creme was something special) Rice pudding with another sort of creme and a citrus compote Finally, at the very very end, in a ""just one more little mint, Sir? it's wafer-thin!"" they gave us a pomegranate chocolate cookie thing that was about the size of my pinkie, and it was a wonderful end.",0.9982,0.822,0.143,0.035,0.5727869352869353
2010-03-13,5.0,"Went here last visit in Chicago and it was a flawless experience. I think we had the best seat in the house (second floor, right next to the glass over looking the entire restaurant). Some of the dishes we ordered included the bacon wrapped dates which were deadly, the garlic shrimp (wouldn't order that again... boring), the short ribs and scallops (AWEsome), cider pork belly (I mean, it's pork belly sooo of course it was amazing), and the rabbit pasta. We ordered a good amount more but we went to pop's for champagne and NoMi before for drinks so my memory isn't the best... not to mention we had a thing of sangria at Mercat. They also gave some delicious tomato bread while waiting. I would definitely come here again... next time without drinking so much before hand.  LOVE IT!",0.9848,0.809,0.191,0.0,0.5007086167800454
2010-03-07,5.0,"I just wrote a tepid review for Avec, and couldn't help but reminisce about my great experiences at Mercat.  Mercat ALSO has a beautiful open kitchen, delicious bacon wrapped dates, great atmosphere, and good service.  I don't even think Mercat is more expensive, although the portions might be a bit smaller. I went to Mercat once for dinner with about a month ago, and then came back for the Restaurant Week luck recently.  Both times, I had no trouble getting reservations the day of, and we were seated right away.    For dinner, we had the dates, mushrooms, Paella De Mariscos, the spanish octopus, and some buttery chocolately thing for dessert that was amazing.  Also had a great wine list- lots of fun Spanish bottles to try. For lunch, I had the Arroza a la Cazuela (another seafood paella style dish), Tuna with pine nuts and basil, and croquestas de xocolata (fried chocolate things with marshmallows).  Also got to try the fried peppers, scallop and hanger steak, which were all great!  My co-worker also got a glass of the sangria and seemed very very happy with it.   I'll definitely be back for another romantic dinner soon, or for a good break to the work day!",0.9966,0.687,0.27,0.043,0.5211180124223602
2010-03-07,4.0,Everything from the appetizers to the flatbread was delicious but the suckling pig stole the show.  I'm not a big fan of brain but every other part of the pig was simple (seasoned with nothing more than some salt and drizzled with oil) and packed with flavor including the cheeks.   The restaurant reminded me of NYC.  As you walk in there is a small bar and a humble entrance but then you walk up the stairs to be seated and the actual restaurant is one giant room where the ceiling never comes into view surrounding you with a lively atmosphere.  Definitely a good change of pace from the typical chicago-style restaurants around town.  I would go there again.,0.9033,0.87,0.111,0.02,0.46785714285714286

One of my friends saw Mercat on Check please and decided that we all needed to go and try it out. When we went in the menu had so many different items on it that we were a bit overwhelmed Our waiter was very helpful though and told us if we got the chefs selection he would let us know what was on it and let us substitute. That is what we ended up doing. We also ordered the Sangrea and it was amazing. The Chefs special was also amazing and we got so much food. The bacon covered dates were amazing. The Kobe stake was also very good. The spanish meats we got were great also. So many great things. While the food here is pricey it was also very good and worth every cent.

One problem, it appears that the chef used coarse salt to salt the food, so that several people at our table complained that they would get a very tasty bite, followed by a way-too-salty bite. Other than that, food was quite good, though not the best Tapas I have had. If it weren't for the salting problem I'd probably give them 4 stars. Actually one other thing, one of us ordered apricot sorbet, another ordered mango, and the gut that delivered them had them switched - they look identical. I'd suggest to the kitchen they need to do something to distinguish those two. They were both delicious.",0.5136,0.797,0.111,0.092,0.4608333333333334
2010-02-25,4.0,I absolutely love Restaurant Week in Chicago.   I went to Mercat with a few friends on 2/23/10 and was taken by surprise as I walked in because of the cute little lounge/bar area.  The hostess was very pleasant and greeted me with a smile.   The coat check is in a very awkward location (out the exit door and in the lobby of the Blackstone Hotel) but I understand since the first level isn't really all that big. We had sooooo much food.  I'm not a huge red meat or pork eater but I found myself digging in the tapas plates of my friends because everything looked and smelled so darn good.  (And wow did it taste good).  There was not one thing at Mercat I did not enjoy.   The waitress was so pleasant and smiled every time she came to the table.   The one thing to be very cautious of are the stairs.....maneuvering them can be a little tricky if you've had one too many pitchers of sangria.,0.9817,0.737,0.206,0.057,0.5090909090909091
2010-02-24,4.0,"I travel for work a bit.  When I travel I almost always travel alone so thus I eat alone etc.. Keep that in mind with pretty much all my reviews (unless the review is in Dallas).   I stopped in for dinner one night.  I was staying across the street at the Hilton.  The entrance to the restaurant was through the Blackstone, however they do have a street entrance it just was not open on this night. The place was pretty busy maybe 80% full.  I asked for a seat in the bar (my favorite place in a restaurant to eat when traveling.. read first note about traveling alone)  and got seated at a bistro table that overlooked the whole restaurant.  The restaurant looked relatively small, or at least smaller then i expected.  they had a decent selection of beers.  The only wheat beer (big fan) they had was blue moon. I like blue moon but its on the not that list so I decided on my typical standby Amstel light.  Usually when there is a tasting menu that is what I choose but I was not that hungry and for some reason was a little reluctant to do that while alone (which never stopped me before). So I ordered the mixto of cheeses and meats.  this is 2 different dishes.  They have a mixto of meats and a mixto of cheeses.  I thought it odd that they didn't have one of both.  each one came with 3 of the chef's selections. I would imagine you could request a particular one or more but I did not.  I do not know which meats I had (sorry I guess I was not listening to what the server was telling me) but they were all great.  They were cut very thin which for some is ok but on the salami I would have preferred it cut a little thicker.   It came with some pickles, some country mustard and some great little sliced peppers. the mixto of cheeses I got was the cana de cabra, the aragons, and ombra.  They all were very good.  The can de cabra surprised me the most.  I am not a big fan of brie, this one by it's self had that nutty taste that brie has.  but when accompanied with the balsamic strawberries it was awesome.  They all were great. I also was brought a complimentary order of tomato bread.  I don't know if they do that for everyone or if it was because I am ridiculously good looking but it was out of this world.  I looked at their menu online and could not find what it is called but I swore that is what they said when they set it down. The service was good.  My waitress was timely and helpful.  My only small complaint is that i wish they would have suggested parings for the meat and accompaniments.  By the time I had gone through several variations and found the one I wanted I only had like one piece left.  Also I was dissappointed to see when I got back to my room that it is restaurant week in Chicago.. No one mentioned this at the restaurant.  so they lose points for that Overall very good.   one last thing... Dear Restaurant Webmaster... remove the music from your site.  I had the site up while typing this review and it almost cost you a star.  You are lucky there are no Yelp half stars.   one more last thing.  ""Mercat a"" sounds a lot like Merkin which makes me giggle.",0.9947,0.808,0.131,0.061,0.5020272904483432

The first time I dined at Mercat was this past summer and my best friend and I decided to go with the Chef's Tasting Menu...simply phenomenal. Today I decided to take advantage of Chicago Restaurant Week and I grabbed my sister for a prix fixe impromptu lunch at this South Loop gem.  Under the pretense that my sister had never dined here, my good friend Griffin C. and fellow fan of Mercat and Slooper extraordinaire said it best, ""you are going to rape her pallet."" And though I found out my sister has been here (for brunch only), the lunch menu sure did just that. For Chicago Restaurant Week, Mercat's lunch menu allows you to choose one item for the first course and second course as well as dessert...and iced tea and/or pop is included. What a steal.  I had the fried peppers for the first course and they were refreshing, unlike any pepper I'd ever tasted before, not spicy but certainly light and memorable. The second course was the hanger steak that was prepared on top of a layer of short ribs which then lay quite amazingly on a crisp, potato croquette.  It was quiet the getaway from the office but also worth much, much more than $22/pp.  The service is always great, attentive and informative.

I checked out Mercat a la Planxa with a few friends and we all ordered a la carte items instead of partaking in their tasting menu. We tried an assortment of hams, which were awesome. They DO have jamon iberico fyi, but of course it's pricier. Dishes such as bacon-wrapped dates, shellfish croquettes and Mar I Muntanya were delicious as were most of the tapas we ordered. My favorite may have been the paella de mariscos. Chef Garces uses bomba rice and it really absorbs the flavor of the stock very well. For dessert we ordered the crema catalana and the croquetas de xocolata. I liked the croquettes not because I thought they were amazing desserts, but mostly because I liked how Chef Garces juxtaposed flavors with rosemary and caramel. My main complaint overall was saltiness. Some of the tapas dishes were too heavily salted and I've definitely had better tapas, but Mercat a la Planxa is worth checking out for the paella and other dishes.",0.9904,0.785,0.201,0.013,0.47083333333333327

Our server was not knowledgeable about the food or wine, having to field all our questions to another although he wasn't new. He was not attentive, and our drinks went without refill for quite awhile. He never smiled. It did seem he had five tables to take care of, but with a prix fixe menu it shouldn't be that difficult. The atmosphere wasn't intimate, and unfortunately still felt like we were in a hotel (yes, I know it is a hotel restaurant, but the restaurant should feel like a separate dining experience when you enter in my opinion).  The food was decent. The Serrano ham and fig salad was really good, but I thought the extra smoked bacon was unnecessary and overpowered the other flavors. The scallops were the best part of my meal with the roasted eggplant puree and wisp of basil sauce very delicious and melding together. I couldn't eat any of the dessert options so they were kind to substitute cheese instead, which were good.  My husband, however, enjoyed the milk chocolate croquettes with banana marshmallow to no end and suggested I take a bite and suffer through a few hours of pain (from my allergy) because it would be worth it for how amazing they are. I did not, but his final course did determine that this review was at least 3 stars.  Recommendation? Just go for dessert.",0.989,0.768,0.174,0.058,0.5998353096179183

Started off with a spinach salad that had a gorgonzola like cheese, a sweet vinaigrette, serrano ham, and bacon. Smokey, sweet, and delicious. Next was a cheese, apple, sauce pairing. The cheeses were tasty, though not anything mind blowing. Following this was an amazing soup, the chicken broth infused with saffron giving it an incredible flavor and color. It had delicious chorizo, chicken, potato, and rice in it. It was topped with a slice of toasted bread covered in their house-made smoked paprika aioli, which paired amazingly well with the soup. This was probably one of the stars of the meal. Next was a skewer of their amazing chorizo, and some tiny omelettes with spinach, onion, and potato (this was the only thing I didn't really care for - but I'm not a big omelette fan anyway - others at the table loved it).  Following this we had wilted spinach with black currants and pine nuts topped with shaved apple. Perfectly charred steak (with amazing flavor) over shredded short rib meat, on top of a potato pancake. Gigantic tiger prawns (with the heads still on - that was a little weird for me, had to have someone else behead the beast, haha). And an AMAZING little cast iron skillet filled with a medley of garlicky mushrooms. I was totally full at this point (and worn out thanks to the stupid cold) and did not partake in the chocolate croquettes, which were apparently orgasmically good.

The Conill Amb Chestnut (Braised rabbit agnolotti with rosemary, a truffle-chestnut puree, and brandied cherries) was delicate and delicious. The Lobster and Waygu short rib a la planxa were prime examples of the restaurant's signature grilling style. We were also impressed by the bartenders at Mercat. We enjoyed the Martini de la boqueria (bombay sapphire, pomegranate liqueur, fresh sour, and fresh mint) and the Spanishattan (Bourbon with a vanilla-soaked raspberry and vermouth), which were tasty twists on traditional favorites.

My girlfriend is from Philadelphia and had been dying to go to this restaurant, as it is currently the only Jose Garces restaurant outside of Philly. First impression was that this place was much larger than it looked from the outside. Attractive interior, great location, and clearly a hot spot as the place was jam packed when we went for dinner. Excellent food. We began our dinner with the Serrano Ham and Fig Salad and a pitcher of white wine sangria. I highly recommend this dish to kick off dinner, unless you are not a fan of ham (as this thing is loaded with it! This is not your typical salad!). We then had the Pelotas de Calabaza Y Cordero (which was also very good) followed by the Paella Negra (she loved it, but I am not crazy about seafood or black rice). We ended with Croquetas De Xocolata as dessert, which was pretty good. Now to the downsides... Our waiter made excellent recommendations on the dishes, but was not around much. We had to ask three times where the bread was (it finally came after we finished our second courses!). Restaurant is relatively loud and seating is arranged very close together, taking a bit away from the intimacy.

The goat's milk cheese with dolce de lecce I didn't feel was the best compliment but it went really well with the apples so I can see what they were going for.  The butternut squash dumplings were absolutely the highlight with the escalivada as a close runner up.  The chorizo was good as well but didn't blow me out of the water by any means.  We were also served a complimentary flat bread tapa that was similar to a bruschetta. Very delicious.  The wine selection although limited to Spain varietals was good.  The service however cost this restaurant a star. Our waiter was very rude and tried to rush us through ordering only to tell us that he would prefer if we ordered everything at once. He was irritated that we asked him for a little extra time to decide and never bothered to check up on us again. We were there a little before the dinner crowd so it was clearly not a matter of opening up space.  I felt that the tables were a little to smashed together.

We were a little put off by where we were seated (table for 4 right by the bar), but it was a busy night so we forgave them. The Coles De Bruselas (brussels sprouts) - divine. Super tasty. The bacon wrapped dates were to die for. It was an explosion of flavor. The ""Mixto"" selection of 3 cured meats was served with tiny peppers and grain mustard.

2010-01-22,3.0,"A group of nine of us went on Saturday Jan 16. Many of us have done tapas elsewhere (BaBaReeba, Barcelona, some of us old school in actual Spain, etc.), but we had a couple newbies.  PROS: Our server, Deirdre, was very polite and attentive and made knowledgeable suggestions. (Although we did not necessarily go with said suggestions. It did at least show she knew what she was about there!) We got two comped items: some delicious tomato flatbread and these flash-fried chili thingies.  Food very tasty. Things I tasted at various points: patatas bravas (delicioso), the mushroom paella (rich, somewhat salty to me, but good), chorizo (good), salchichon de vic (good), datiles con almendras (excellent), diver scallops (excellent). I was somewhat surprised the place didn't have the standard bread and olive oil offered. It would have been nice to have something to go with the extra salchichon, for instance.  Decor is swank. Things to consider (not necessarily CONS):  Mercat, IMO, is one of those ""for show"" restaurants. It's got the swanky decor, the swanky downtown location, you should dress appropriately. The food is staged and dressed up as well.  Compared to some of the other tapas places I've been to, they were more expensive for less on the plate (and we had a lot of people to go around, so we were ordering multiples). I guess I've got it in my mind that tapas should be more fun and relaxed and casual. It's not that this place wasn't fun (it was), but the overwhelming impression I have is it's a place for people who are more interested in the looks and social cache of going to such a place. And of course you are going to pay for that because hey, the place has got to pay that expensive downtown rent! I'm just not into that. If I'm going out to eat, I'm more concerned with service and food quality. Overall, I am glad I went for the experience, but I probably won't be back.

2010-01-20,4.0,"This still keeps the dazzling first impression I had of the place a year ago.  We did the chef's tasting last year and enjoyed every bit of it.  This year, since the family travels to Spain at least once every year we were yearning for the comfort tapas and ordered those a la carte.  My review will be based on comparing the ones I'm familiar with in Spain: Jamon Iberico: Not sure what's their source, but it's not as dark as I'm used to.  However it's shaved thinly and less fatty than most Jamon Ibericos, so I personally enjoyed the flavor sans that fat.  Melts in your mouth! Octopus with Potatoes & Paprika: I know this more as Pulpo a la Gallega, and it's pretty spot on.  More garlicky than normal, slightly less meat than one would normally serve, and a tad overcooked than its usual preparation, but still delicious and the closest I've had to the real thing this side of the Atlantic. Patatas Bravas: Much more cutesy and less messy than the traditional presentation.  (You get 7 slices in a row with a bit of the salsa brava on top of each)  But it's perfect!  I judge tapas restos on this dish, and the fancy plating doesn't mask anything - the flavors are dead on. Croquetas de Bacalao: These are little babies compared to their cousins in Andalucia.  I couldn't get the bacalao flavor I was hoping for in this one, so this is probably the most disappointing.  I wouldn't get it again. Sadness. Pork Belly: They definitely know how to win a tocino-lover's heart. Sangria: Fabulous. Probably even better that the hangover-inducing ones you'd get in Spanish bodegas. The seasonal ones are magical amalgamations of delicioso. Mercat has become the new go-to tapas resto over Cafe Iberico just because the dishes are slightly more reminiscent of the Spain we love and visit every year.  Authenticity is still there despite the fancy ambiance and plating.  I'd give this a fifth star if I could actually afford to eat everything I want on my own, but I'm on the whim of the padres' Spanish cravings.",0.9924,0.797,0.159,0.044,0.5242985409652077

2010-01-16,5.0,"We had a Saturday evening dinner with friends in celebration for a birthday.  Words cannot describe the overall experience we enjoyed. We started the evening with a photo and short conversation with Iron Chef Jose Garces!!!  What a delightful and down-to-earth guy!!  He was in town to premier his 1st Iron Chef Battle tomorrow. I was eager to experience this Catalan restaurant after living in Madrid, traveling to Andalucia, eating at Emilio's and Cafe Iberico.  This by far topped every American tapas restaurant I've been too, and brought back great memories of Spain. Each of us chose 3 entrees, for a total of 12 dishes, rather than the chef's list, for more variety for a little less cost. The pitcher of Red Sangria was sweet, and nearly perfect. We began with a tapas assortment of olives, garlic shrimp, and marinated anchovies with pine nuts and green olives.  The anchovies had a nice smoky fish flavor combined with the saltiness of the olive, and contrasted the soft anchovie and the firmness of the olive, for a surprisingly tasty dish.  The garlic shrimp were outstanding.  The bacon wrapped dates with almonds were a table favorite! We had a mixed platter of jamon serrano, chorizo, and jamon de pato (duck)...all great. Next came the patatas bravas, or some lightly fried/crunchy potatoes with a paprika aioli, which were fantastic!  Along with this came the Braised Rabbit Agnolotti with a truffle-chestnut puree, and cherries.  Hands down the BEST DISH we had all evening!  Essential to pair the cherry and the pasta in the same bite.  This dish gave me a glimpse of what it must be like to be in kitchen stadium.  Absolutely incredible, and a must for anyone going! Our ""main dishes"" were the pork belly with cider glaze, apples, and a parnsip puree (outstanding!!!), short ribs and diver scallops, Muscovy duck breast with a duck confit-foie gras crepe (don't know why they ever outlawed the stuff, it's divine!), and serrano wrapped tuna on a potato croquette, were cooked perfectly. We ended with a dessert of chocolate croquettes, banana marshmallow, rosemary carmel, and olive oil.  I never imagined olive oil, chocolate, and caramel all together, but the pairing of olive oil and caramel, and the little marshmallow were absolutely heavenly! Samuel was our server and was outstanding, meeting our every need.    The atmosphere was hip and modern (so say's my artist wife), mood was good.  We all agreed this was one of our best dining experiences (1.5 hours as the servers gradually introduce each course). We will definitely be back, and will savor this for a long time!  The best dining experience we've had in Chicago....",0.9964,0.843,0.149,0.007,0.5099747474747475

Each dish was prepared and presented exquisitely and carried some unique twist that marked a departure from similar dishes had elsewhere.  A couple of the ten or twelve dishes we shared we just so-so. The rest were each stellar and very unique. The scallops should probably be avoided, IMO.

I mean this in all sincerity: if you are hungry, eat before you go or be prepared to spend heartily to match your appetite.  Extreme Low Light:  The wine list is fairly boring and overpriced.

We decided to give it a shot for a special New Year's Eve dinner.  This is definitely a special occasion destination. We did the special NYE chef's menu and a wine flight each, and the tab came to about $250 with tax and tip. This is more than we normally spend for anything but our more expensive/special outings. My wife recently commented to a friend that there is a primal conflict between my love of good food and being a complete cheap-ass (she said it nicer).  But I don't mind paying for quality, and this place was worth the price. The ingredients were really high end and the service was excellent. We also got a lot of really tasty food for our money. I was full before the meat course (lamb chops and Wagyu beef--it goes without saying that I got my second wind after tasting it).  Major highlights:  * Great service. We ordered the chef's menu but they tailored it to our exact likes and dislikes, replacing two items with items that were more palatable for my wife (she doesn't eat shellfish). The waiter also kept really close tabs on us, and the food and wine was brought out with pretty flawless timing.  * The Serranno Ham and Fig salad was out of this world. So simple, yet such a perfect balance of flavors.  * The lamb chops were simply fantastic. Served with two sauces that were completely superfluous IMHO, since the chop was perfect on its own.  Minor low lights:  * The tuna was only ok, and not up to the standards of the rest of the meal.  * The bacon-wrapped dates, which is a classic tapas dish, was prepared with an almond inside the date. The almond balances out the sweet/savory contrast a bit, which to me is the point of this pairing. I think I prefer the classic version (no almond) better. The whole experience was perfect for a special NYE dinner, and Mercat has now officially been added to the PILETTCOTHD* list. *Places I Like Even Though They Cost Over Two Hundred Dollars",0.9977,0.774,0.204,0.022,0.5419691690423398

2009-12-08,4.0,"I hit up Mercat back in October (before Jose Garces won Iron Chef and the restaurant presumably turned into a madhouse).  I love Catalan/Barcelona-related things so Mercat was definitely a huge draw for me.  When I discovered the day before that this was one of Garces' restaurants, I was definitely in.   The place itself was really quite nice.  The interior was a bit dark with some interesting lighting and décor.  It was a stylish, good-looking restaurant - I liked it a lot.  Apparently other people did too - it wasn't busy when we got there but it was packed by the time we left.  Anyway, the food & drink... Sippin' on: Altovinum - Spanish Garnacha.  This was pretty good, but I'd probably opt for something else.  Though I've never been particularly crazy about any Spanish wines I've had.   Munchin' on: Pan con tomate - BAM! They hit you from the start with this FREE tapa.  This was delicious and perfectly executed.  Great bread (lightly toasted for a bit of crunch) and a very flavorful mix of tomato, garlic, olive oil, etc.   Bacalao croquetas - These were decent, but not amazing and I probably wouldn't get them again.  I didn't really care for the peppers served with them.   Butifarra sausage - This was pretty good.  I mean, it's pretty basic - just 3 smallish sausages.  The seasoning was interesting.  If I was in the mood, I'd get this again.   Patatas bravas - Eh, honestly I've had better versions of this common dish.  They weren't fried/crunchy enough and the ""spicy"" paprika aioli wasn't a welcome addition (or spicy). Tortilla - The omelette had potatoes and spinach in it.  Maybe onion and I think saffron.  It was a pretty typical take on this dish - it's good, but didn't really amaze me.   Pork belly - Bull's eye.  My favorite dish.  Pork belly with cider, tart apples, and a truffle-y turnip puree.  It was a fantastic dish.  All the flavors and textures worked really well.  I was worried about the truffle being too much (I might be a little sensitive to the flavor of truffles), but it was the perfect amount.  It was one of those dishes you want to keep eating and eating.     Chocolate croquetas - How the hell are some of you hating on these?  I pity the fool...These are ridiculous!  Chocolate-y, gooey, perfectly-fried little nuggets of awesomeness served with a variety of tasty pairings - banana marshmallow (!!), rosemary caramel (!) , and some exotic olive oil.  This dish was excellent in terms of texture and flavor and is certainly one of the more memorable, clever and unique desserts I've come across in a long time.  Can they make them baseball-sized? So while the food overall was very good, there were some additional disappointing aspects of the meal aside from a couple of the actual dishes.  Well, it's probably obvious, but the portion sizes were too small for the prices.  The prices were steep and, even acknowledging that they surely use high-quality ingredients and such, I couldn't help but feel a little gypped at some of the tiny portions.  Also, the odd number of servings in each dish was really wacky - it'd be like 5 croquetas or 7 patatas.  Why is that?  It's kinda annoying to split food like that.  It's a small quibble, but seriously, it seems pretty basic.  Anyway, Mercat is definitely a quality spot that offers some great tapas.  While the prices/portions aren't ideal, the food in general is very good.  I'd definitely hit up this place again if I was back in town.   4",0.9986,0.7,0.223,0.078,0.6029009782207455

It was delicious.  The biggest portioned dish out of our entire meal! Next was the bacon wrapped dates.  Total four dates, two per skewer. Flavor was excellent. We continued on with the Shellfish Croquettes.  Five little tiny shellfish on top of a bed of rice. Surprisingly, this was very good. It was something in the rice....  We then tried the butternut squash dumplings. These were OUTSTANDING!!! My favorite dish of the night! There was only three small pieces!!!! I wish there were more.... For substance, we ate the shrimp, chorizo, and garbanzo bean puree flatbread. I made sure to drink lots of water, hoping this would expand and fill my stomach!  To end, we ordered a cake with plum sauce and almond ice cream. It was the least memorable part of our meal.  Four tapas, one dessert, and one martini was over $80.

2009-12-02,2.0,"I've been to more than a couple of tapas places, and Mercat places itself near the bottom of my list. I was so excited to visit the restaurant when I was staying at the Hilton across the street, but sadly the restaurant disappointed me. It was crowded, and we were seated at the tall sofa area (was this the waiting area? I couldn't tell). We ordered drinks, and our waitress completely tipped her tray, broke the glass, and spilled our drinks all over. We didn't mind this too much because we could tell that she was new. The drinks we ordered were pretty good: my friend had something with strawberries in it and I had something with peach... I know it wasn't sangrias though. We ordered some food and the little tables in front of us couldn't hold all of the food, so you eventually moved us to a high table. But I actually liked the atmosphere where we were originally seated. Upon the waitress's recommendation, we ordered the bacon covered dates. I don't know about my friend, but I didn't really like this plate. It was too sweet for me. We also ordered the octopus, but I liked Cafe Iberico's way better. The plate was too bland. We also got some kind of flatbread (I think it had sausage in it, but I don't really remember), but I didn't enjoy that either. The flavor did not jive with my palate at all.  We ordered a plate of the duck, and that was just mediocre. I don't remember what else we ordered, but whatever it was, it wasn't very memorable.  Although we didn't get to meet the iron chef, I was not impressed at all. Cafe Iberico will still remain my favorite restaurant for Spanish tapas.",0.9568,0.816,0.118,0.066,0.6380695847362513

Our menu: Cheese plate paired w/apple marmalade and sliced raw apples Tomato & garlic bruschetta Spinach salad w/serrano ham & sherry vinaigrette (dressed just enough) Shellfish croquettes (IMO, was fried for too long because the crust overpowered the filling) Garlic shrimp Prawns Spicy potatoes w/paprika aioli (I thought these were a little dry) Porcini & sausage flatbread Rabbit dumplings w/candied cherries (a favorite for some of my friends) Warm spinach w/raisins & pine nuts (nice light accompaniment to the meats) Rack of lamb (my favorite - very tender and very little game taste) Ribeye The sauce pairings for both red meats were perfect.  However, I thought the shrimp & prawns were overly salted and not very innovative.  We also tried 2 desserts: the chocolate croquette with banana marshmallow and the ""Crema Catalana"" (figs with orange whipped cream (?) and a golf ball sized scoop of berry sorbet).  The latter was the most disappointing (a dining companion said it was like eating ""air""), and the former was just ok.  Desserts don't seem to be their strong point.

2009-11-15,4.0,"TAPAS DE UPSCALE-EO A little history on tapas - originating in Spain, it was really its meant to be inexpensive, locally sourced, bar food.  It was to keep people from getting too drunk and too sick.  Luckily, tapas was born out of Spain, and the food there consisted of most things being cooked in garlic and olive oil, and only the freshest local ingredients.  So, any of you Twilight vampirers, or New Mooners or other wise, you can't eat the garlic tapas (more for us!). Back to the present, Spain is now the world center of new cuisine, and Barcelona is their growing jewel.  Being just there a month ago, I ate as many forms of tapas as I could EVERY DAY for two weeks.  Even in the pricey places, its not that expensive (8-10 Euro, depending on the place), and the plates are a sharable size, with no more than 3 plates needed to make a very complete meal.  Meats, cheeses, vegetables, seafood, whatever was closest was served. At Mercat a la Planxa, I will say the food tastes GREAT.  The only thing is, due to the location and the overhead, you will only get to TASTE the food.  Some portions are small, some are translucent (meat plate).  Don't expect enough to share a tapas portion with anyone but aspiring models (4 models to a plate, which means you will need to order a lot more food to avoid that midnight after dinner Whopper, if you came in hungry earlier).  It is not a local style restaurant - it is a big name one, and with the big overhead comes an artisan tasting gallery (i.e. small samples) of very tasty food, possibly leaving you hungry for more - LITERALLY.  So be warned, Chicago appetites!  If you are a skinny European, then this place is PERFECT. As for understanding the food, the staff had little knowledge outside of reciting the ingredients.  For instance, the first dish (which was complementary) was ""pan con tomate"" - a simple piece of toasted bread rubbed with garlic and crushed tomato, drizzled with olive oil.  I asked the bartenders where this dish came from, or its origins.  The only spanish person working mentioned a story of how it was made, but really, it is a Catalan dish - meant to make something special out of day-old bread.  Here, the interpretation was much more advanced, even for a piece of bread. The rest: Charcuterie Mixta - 3 kinds of meat served with bread and condiments.  The slices were ultra thin, and the size of a silver dollar. Nice flavor, but that was our protein for the night.   Setas a la planxa - Nice mix of 3 different mushrooms, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  This was the best main dish of the night. Paella Negra - Squid ink rice with squid, very good and rich.  Nice dish, but just enough for 2 to share, for one to finish.  Protein here too. Croquetas de Chocolate - little fried chocolate balls with marshmallow pillows and caramel.  Tasty - 6 bites was enough.  The croquetas were hot and the execution perfect. Datiles con bacon - not much you can do with a date wrapped in bacon, but they put a little frise salad with a light blue cheese dressing (almost a play on a buffalo wing presentation).  If they had added a bit of heat to the date, it would have been over the top. So, to summarize, expect a great flavor, great food, but make sure you're on a diet, cause you will be wanting a bit more.",0.9973,0.839,0.136,0.025,0.5220769470769472

Visit #1 - Made a reservation through opentable and was promptly seated.  We ordered a few drinks, and six tapas.  Everything was going great until our last two tapas took 20-30 minutes to come out.  Our waiter stopped by and basically asked us if we were done.  My wife said we were done ordering but we were still waiting for our last two dishes.  He pretended like he knew what we were talking about, but the look on his face told us otherwise.  He said there must be a hold up, but I knew that he didn't even remember that we were waiting for two dishes.  The dishes finally come out and they were very good, it was just annoying to have to wait and then have some pretend that they didn't screw up.   Visit #2 - I called for the reservation since we had six people.  They told me that if I wanted eight people, that we would have to be seated at 5:30 or 6, which was too early.  So I didn't invite my other friends.  We get there promptly at 8:30 and the people at our table have paid their check and we are waiting for them to get up and go.  I'm not blaming Mercat for having to wait 20 minutes to get seated, but I'm annoyed that the table we are waiting for has eight people!  Ugh.  Luckily the hostess had ""hot shoes"" and she was very nice and it was entertaining to look at her shoes.  Anyway, we wait to order our drinks after we get seated.  Drinks take 10 to 15 minutes to get to our table.  Seriously?  I asked the waiter if I could order my next beer right away, cause if it takes that long I should just order right now.  I don't think he appreciated that.  The bar was ""backed up"", and each drink took way too long to get.  The food service was actually pretty good, other than the fact that I was moving dishes off to the side all night long because nobody was clearing our table.

When we arrived we were told there was a 45 minute wait.  No problem, my friends wanted to sit in the lounge anyways because it was more private and secluded.  Sure enough, it was so secluded a server never showed up.  We waited 20 minutes and asked twice for a server but got nothing.  My friend got up and asked the hostess, who was very gracious and apologized, and then suddenly a table was open for us in the main area.  Funny how this works. Other comments about the flatbreads are right, they are very good.  The porcini and catalan sausage was quite tasty.  Other selections - braised rabbit pasta - i think this was my favorite in terms of flavor, but the portion was small slow-cooked shortribs and diver scallops - i was disappointed in this, the meat was a little rough and lacking.  The scallops were ok, not enough to save the dish though. patatas bravas - spicy potatoes were flavorful, but not spicy paella - it took almost an hour for the paella to come out.  In fact we ordered the potatoes after the other dishes came out, and even that came out before the paella!  For that long of a wait it better have been the greatest paella ever, but alas it was mediocre. When finished we asked the waiter for dessert menus.  15 minutes later, nothing.  We flagged down a busser to retrieve menus, and he got them quickly.  We ordered the chocolate croquettes with banana marshmallows.  Pretty flat and disappointing, but it is a dish to try.   It was pretty busy for a Thursday night, but the service misfires were too much to overcome.  I hope others had a better experience than I did.  Skip.",0.9905,0.733,0.176,0.091,0.5568698412698412

I was with two of my besties, and we had a fantastic night of delicious food, cocktails and laughs. I still think it lacks a certain level of refinement, but I enjoyed the energy and crowd on a Thursday night. We did the chef's tasting, and while it was way too much food for me, it was very good.  We had: Serrano Ham & Fig Salad Cana de Cabra - Goats Milk and Balsamic Strawberries - This was fantastic. I could not stop eating the balsamic strawberry spread. The beef shortrib flatbread - How could you go wrong?? It was beefy, cheesy deliciousness. Garlic Shrimp - VERY GARLICEY - You do not want to eat this if you are on a date.  Jumbo Prawns Seafood Ceviche - This was probably my favorite. It was light and refreshing. Rabbit Ravioli  Lamb - This was probably my second favorite. It came out pretty rare, tender and flavorful.  For dessert, we had the chocolate croquettes with banana marshmallows. It was definitely something to try, but a bit disappointing. The three of us were not satisfied, so we got ice cream. :)  The drink menu was good... but what do I know? I got drunk on half a glass of wine.  Service was a little slow, but not bad.

The Merengue is the very reason that Absolut Grapefruit has become my vodka of choice. it's blended with fresh strawberries and a mango and lime puree. Yeah, a girly drink, but so what. Turns out it was the best cocktail I've ever had. Then we headed upstairs and had a variety of tapas and cocas: patatas bravas, espinacas a la Catalana, almejas y tocino, costillas de ternera, and lucky for us, one of Jose Garces' iron-chef-winning dishes was on the menu that night: sliced iberico and cantaloupe terrine. The patatas bravas were like grown-up tater tots. they didn't have that hashbrown texture, but were more refined and served with a paprika aioli. Delicious. The almejas/tocino and costillas cocas were excellent Spanish-style ""pizzas."" a little on the salty side, tho; the former combined bacon, clams, and brandade (which is a like a salt lick all by itself), and the latter consisted of shredded beef shortribs, horseradish, parmesan cheese, and more bacon. Pairing these with salads instead of tapas would have been a better choice. Next time... The terrine was the best thing I had that night. It was simple but had a stunning presentation, with layers of thinly sliced serrano ham and cantaloupe; that classic pork-fruit combination doesn't get any better than this. Mercat is pricey, but well worth it, in my opinion. Aside from the mind-blowing food, the atmosphere was lively, the music was fun, and the vibe was vibrant.

I was with 8 people when I went and we all had the chef's tasting menu which I recommend. We decided to just have excessive amounts of sangria and Absinthe for desert instead of the additional wine pairings. I do have to take ONE star off for service. When spending over a G on a meal you want start to finish steady service. I do think that an automatic gratuity over parties of six doesn't help that situation. So all throughout about 85 percent of the meal the service was impecable. But for the last fifteen percent it tailed off to let's say, non-existence. Couldn't get the check let alone see the server anywhere inside the restaurant. Could've been in the bathroom or havin a smoke, but either way unacceptable.

Classically trained, latin-global cuisine perspectives; 4 successful restaurants in philly.  Iron-Chef winner and has a restaurant 4 blocks away from me! Sweet. So without even tasting the food, I root for this guy already.  Just had brunch but was very pleased.  I opted for yet another eggs benedict variation (Such a sucker for these) - Tuffle hollandaise (list truffle as an ingredient and I'm a sucker for that too), over poached eggs, chorizo and a perfect rectangle of chiabatta toast - Simple, sophisticated twist, great balance and delicious.  The sea bass tapa was very delicate and compex - intentionally unsubstanial and the french toast i sampled was made unique by a fresh berry compote and cheese.

Well, you get a huge pour, and an extremely knowledgeable bartender who will pour you ample samples until you find one you like.

2009-08-28,3.0,"Chicago ""owns"" Mercat about as much as it owns, say, Rick Bayless or Boul Mich--that is, not at all. It's inevitable, I suppose, that a whole micro-verse is necessary to serve the convention and tourist crowds, but it's also unfortunate that the city's best ""Spanish"" restaurant belongs, and wants to belong, squarely in the realm of the out-of-towners rather than in the cold (and overweight) embrace of area foodies. You gets no love. Ah, air quotes--nature's pretense. But work with me here: this is largely not a Spanish restaurant. Sure, Mercat advertises itself as Catalonian, but it's serving tapas (uh, Madrid), with lots of non-native elements (see: eggplant puree)--definitely not Catalan. That's bourgeois American conceptualization of Spanish food, folks, and that is pretty fascinating to observe...sort of like watching old people run frantically to catch a Blue Line Train that has, in fact, been stalled in the station for the last five minutes. Okay, kidding: watching old people run is much fascinating. But isn't it amazing that what we perceive as contemporary Italian or Spanish is really American, rid of regional dogmas and nationalist preoccupations? Let's have a little more faith, people! Well. It had been a year since my last visit; they did, finally, change the opening menu--which  must have been in place for a year--but took off the one knockout dish, a squid ink pasta with aioli that was among the better things I ate in 2008. Jose Garces, for what it's worth, is one of the most consistent whole-menu visionaries I've come across--there isn't a single thing on the menu I wouldn't want to eat--but rare is the truly memorable, truly unforgettable dish. That's by design, surely: you come here, max out your per diem, enjoy your meal, and poop it out a day later. Ephemera. But plenty of pop, though. With tomatoes in season, the introductory pan de tomato (Catalan!) sings--so much so, that I'm not sure why Garces serves this the rest of the year. The cheese plates are nice, bowing to tradition with a little contemporary flair: we had a hard goat cheese that came with a garlic dulce de leche, allowing us to make nice little sandwiches of cheese, granny smith apple, and the caramel. Pasta remains a strong point: the squash dumplings were beautifully creamy, a glimpse of fall; I found the lamb ragu and lamb bacon superfluous, however. Of the two surf-and-turf dishes, skip the scallop-short rib dish--over-salted, and the additional parts (eggplant puree, artichoke salad), while tasty, did not cohere--and go for the serrano-wrapped tuna, which is a fun textural experiment thanks to the accompanying foie gras and croquette. Because my father doesn't eat pork, we also ordered a couple of classics--tortilla Espanola, gambas al ajillo--that were entirely inoffensive but were presumably far below what we could have gotten if the, well, 85% of the menu was more amenable. To the part where I get to being an old maid: the pricing is getting obnoxious. This place was never cheap, but the 10-20% per-dish increase over the past year is especially gnawing in light of the steadfastly small portion size. On a per-bite basis, only Spiaggia has more expensive pastas: we're talking three small dumplings (smaller than Urban Belly) for $14. Really. Some of the vegetable sides were also $14. We had the Escalivida, a ""plate"" of marinated vegetables that literally had one small pepper, three grape tomatoes, a cippolini onion, a small mound of eggplant puree, and some figged-out bread--it was great; it was $11. Again, really. We had to prompt our server to get the once customary petit fours.  In other news, I've now officially become my mother. Last year I would not have hesitated to bestow a four-star-er on this place, but natural's not in it, no longer. The cooking is (generally) great, but it is not true. It is, in spite of the talent behind it and the consistency within, depressingly corporate.

2009-08-21,5.0,"Lucky me, my girl took me to a fancy place.   First of all the service was positively kind.  The first time we showed up was on a busy Friday night, and we tried to weasel our way into an outdoor seat.  They were really nice about it, and did their best to accommodate us.  When we told them we couldn't wait 45 minutes, they they told us in a sincere manner that they hoped we'd come back another time. So we did, this time with a reservation.  Service was immediate, friendly, and unobtrusive.  When it started to rain, and we apologetically asked if we could move from our table for two to a table with an umbrella -- even though the umbrella-table seated four -- they cheerfully told us that we could do it, no problem.  When it came time to explain the menu, the waitress was highly knowledgeable -- without a trace of condescension or pretension.  This was important for me, as I know next to nothing about wine in general or Spanish food in particular. When the waitress asked what I would like to drink, I started with lemonade, which turned out to be a good choice as the light lemonade she brought out went really well with the food.  I asked her to choose my wine, and told her that all I know about wine is that I like Sangiovese.  She brought me a perfect Tempranillo.  When I told her how much I liked it, she was genuinely overjoyed -- and wrote down the name of the bottle for me.    I also should point out that the food came out McDonald's-quick. (That's a compliment!) We started with escalivada, which is plate of different cooked vegetables.  While all of it was good, the onion was scrumptious.  I really would have liked a whole plate of onions like that.   Then came the rabbit ravioli, which I wasn't that excited about because I don't know about eating... foam.  But my girlfriend really liked it. We then had the morel mushroom rice, which was like a mushroom-asparagus risotto.  It was OUT OF THIS WORLD.  They used some kind of top-quality Spanish olive oil that created an extra layer of flavor between the vegetables.  My girlfriend said it was so good that she could eat another plate of it -- more on that later. The next dish was the only one that neither of us liked -- the patatas bravas, which are non-greasy tater tots with some kind of aioli that coats your tongue. As our next dish came out, they brought us another plate of the delicious morel/asparagus rice.  When we pointed out that we had already had ours, and that it probably belonged to someone else, the guy said ""Uh, okay,"" shrugged and said ""it's a compliment.""  My sweetie got her wish - more of her favorite dish! The last two dishes were OFF THE CHAIN they were so good -- tender, sweet lobster in creamed corn and... A hearty, non-tapas-like bowl of fava beans, lima beans and serrano ham with some kind of Spanish cheese that made it pop!  I could eat this ham-and-beans dish every day!  It seems like something you'd eat every morning before going out to work the fields in a Catalan winter.",0.9984,0.807,0.181,0.012,0.5221350762527233

The grilled shrimp were the most traditional thing we tried but that shouldn't count against it. Excellent presentation and nice flavor. The La Peral cow's cheese almost made me weep if only because I was too stuffed to eat or order more of it! The good: Dates wrapped in bacon and stuffed with almonds (an always dependable dish but am I being high maintenance wanting more than 4 per order?); Seafood paella--generous servings of fish but a bit lacking in flavor. Still a solid dish. The fennel and white bean salad arrived late in the meal and as a result, we didn't finish it, but it was flavorful and had a nice portioning. The meh: Mango sorbet started out sweet and nearly destroyed my throat at the end. Say what? There's red pepper in there? Put it on the menu please. While the service overall was solid, it's a bit annoying when you have to ask twice to see the wine list. Also, our waiter never stayed put for long and I had to ask him for more water.

While waiting at the hostess stand this very nice woman, obviously a tourist, recommend the dates. She was so sweet and excited to be there. It was cute.The lounge area was filled with tourists, doesn't really bother me, just throwing it in here 'cause I know some people prefer to stay away from touristy areas, and this was.  The service was excellent! The hostess, the servers, everyone was great. However, the food wasn't. We ordered: 1. Gambas con garbanzo, which is a flat bread with shrimp, chorizo and garbanzo bean puree. Reminded us of a pepperoni pizza with shrimp. My husband said it was like a fancy Pepperidge Farm pizza.  2. Paella Negra. Very salty 3. Peolotas de Calabaza y Cordero, butternut quash dumplings, were ok. Not very exciting.  4.Butifarra Con Judias; house made pork and apple sausage. Kind of sweet, I would prefer to use the sausage for breakfast or brunch with some pancakes, and without the truffled white beans. The best item of the night was compliments of the chef, the Bacon-wrapped dates. I would have been happy just eating this alone.  We also had the Ajo y Tomate Flatbread. It's like a bruschetta, only I prefer brushetta when it's warm and crispy. Desserts were good. Had the Croquettes, my husband loved it.

We've been here twice, once just the two of us and once with friends from Toronto.  The food is very good and the tapas concept is great for dinner with friends.  The four stars are because we had bad hostess experiences both times and, even though we made reservations and showed up a little early we had to wait 15 minutes past our reservation both times.  This is not a HUGE deal, but the bar / waiting area downstairs is not huge and crowds up quickly.  Additionally, although the food quality and taste is very high, the price tag is equally high if not a little higher (for some of the grilled meats, I think)... so on value for money this one is about even if not a trifle on the negative side in my book. All that being said, I think this is a fantastic place in a great location.  The decor is hip and fun.  The first time we were there we went a-la-carte and the 2nd time we did the tasting menu.  The tasting menu is probably better value for money then ""DIY"" ordering and is highly recommended - they bring out a great sample of what the menu has to offer.",0.9877,0.774,0.18,0.046,0.5380355555555556

There were more that I can't remember, but it was all delicous.  I was totally disppointed with the seasonal sangria though. It was completely watered down.  Also, at the risk of sounding like a geezer, it was so loud in there! If you go with a group, be prepared to only talk to the people to the left and right of you b/c you won't be able to hear anyone else.

We started off with a white sangria, mojito, and the seasonal sangria. The drinks were ok but the food was what really blew me away.  1) Serrano ham and fig salad: I liked it but it was slightly salty.  2) Bacon wrapped dates stuffed with almonds with a creamy cheese sauce: I loved the combo of the sweet, salty, and creamy. I've had the bacon wrapped dates at Twist and Avec and I think Mercat has the best ones hands down (although Avec's is pretty rockin' because of the chorizo).  3) Tocino con cidra (pork belly with a cider glaze): this was my FAVORITE dish of the night. I've had bbq'ed pork belly before but the cider glaze at this place was awesome  4) Short ribs + diver scallops: the scallops and short ribs were so tender. This dish was my dining partner's favorite but it was a little salty for me  5) Australian sea bass: the fish was super fresh  6) Butternut squash dumplings: I thought this dish was ok. I didn't like how creamy and running the filling was  7) Arroz con morels: this was a pretty good risotto-style dish. I didn't think it had quite the texture of risotto because it was a bit too mushy for me but i can't tell whether this was really a risotto  8) Milk chocolate croquettes: at first I was hesitant but this dessert won me over.

We also knew we wanted Sangria.  And lots of it.  We wanted to try all of the three different varieties, but our waiter convinced us to get the seasonal and then just one more.  He said we would love the seasonal and shouldn't even get another type.  We should have listened.  There was nothing wrong with the red, but the seasonal was really amazing.  So amazing, in fact, we ended up getting 6 carafes by the end of the night. Ok, on to the food.  The Chef's tasting was amazing.  The food came out consistently and with enough time to enjoy it and say  ""oh my GOD!"" after each bite.  Out of all of the items, the prawns were the only thing that we probably could have done without.  Highlights include:  Bacon-wrapped-walnut-filled-dates, tomato flat bread, chorizo and cheese plates, beans with pine nuts, and the lamb chops...oh the lamb chops!!!  We couldn't quite figure out what made them so good, but then determined that they must have been dipped in s*x.  That really could be the only explanation.  They were that good.  The atmosphere was very ""hip"" but without feeling intimidating.  There were some tables of people that I'm pretty sure thought they were in Vegas, but we honestly were too focused on our food to really notice.

The barramundi fish tapa was sparkingly fresh. Its creamy texture and crisp skin was perfect. The pulpus (octopus) and potatoes was very tasty spiced with smoked paprika. We finished up with the short ribs and diver scallops--very rich and delicious. The staff could not be more attentive. It is difficult on timing in a large restaurant. Some dishes came too soon.

The smoked meats and cheese, the risotto, the lamb, the crab--seriously everything was great.  And waiting and wondering what the next dish would be made for a lot of excitement.  Each dish is enough for four to taste.  We were afraid we'd be hungry at the end of the meal, but we really weren't.  We ordered the large portion of lamb for the four of us and it was generous.

For the second course, I tried the Australian sea bass.  My friend had the scallops.  Nothing too creative about either dish.  The sea bass, that I'd heard rave reviews about, was very fishy and smothered in another really heavy sauce.  The scallops were also fishy and more heavy sauce.  I'm starting to see a pattern here... For dessert, we tried both the crema catalana and the chocolate croquettes.  These were actually very good, but nothing special.

Service:  Our waiter was super friendly and efficient.  Our food came out in stages, but all very quickly.  We'd almost be finished with one plate when the next one would arrive.   Decor:  Red, black, tall ceilings, single light bulbs hanging from the trusses, a water feature under the stairs.  The loungey electronic music was a bit too loud, but it wasn't bothersome. Highly recommended for special occasions... or when you are looking to take an out of town guest to a restaurant with a big city feel.  Something they definitely cannot experience in their hometown.",0.9963,0.752,0.214,0.034,0.4404074074074073

Throughout the 1st portion of our meal, the waitstaff/servers kept knocking into my friend's chair and then one of them accidentally dropped something on her.  The liquid went everywhere.  The 2nd tier manager...some snooty french guy acted as though she was an inconvenience to whatever it was he was doing and told her she should get her coat cleaned and that she would have to come back to bring him the cleaning bill.  What???   The food!!!  WONDERFUL, DELICIOUS, FLAVORFUL!!  The morel mushroom risotto was one of the best things I have ever tasted and would have licked the bowl if I was in private!   The pork belly with some potato puree and the short rib was just delicious.  The chef really put some thought into his dishes.

As far as comments on service, I'm baffled.  Maybe it's because they wore black put some folks off?  Our waiter was attentive and professional and made some genuinely good suggestions;  no posing at all.  I was also sensitive to this from other comments and every table nearby seemed to be having friendly, helpful service - back waiters not bad either...   I was also impressed that they seated us promptly at 9:00 on a Saturday evening. We had basic Jamon Serrano, Chorizo (both classics and well done) with the bacon-wrapped dates (very good).  The Barramundi was superb and the pork belly sublime.  The shellfish Croquettes were also a nice alternative to typically denser and heavier croquettes.  I also highly recommend the Catalan spinach which I wouldn't normally have ordered if not for the recommendation of the waiter - a nice surprise.  The Butifarra (homemade sausage) was deftly seasoned - piquant without being overpowering.  To top it off, the chocolate Croquette dessert was really amazing. I also have to give Mercat credit for a substantive and moderately priced wine list offering many options by the glass, half carafe and larger, all at very reasonable prices.  The half-carafe option also let's you mix things up a bit and try various wines.

As far as food and drinks...they were spot on. I deferred to my friend to ordering the wine and tapas as she's an expert on both. We all split the bacon wrap dates (my friend likes them so much she was seconds away from licking the plate when the waiter came back), the Serrano Ham and Fig salad (which was so good I almost licked the plate), the garlic shrimp, the albondigas de catalana (Spanish meatballs) and the mixto, which is a cheese plate with three of the chef's choice.  I can't remember what three we had (thanks to the two bottles of wine we had) but you really can't go wrong with cheese.

We went here as a foursome at 8PM on a Thursday night.  The look of the place is hip and cool.  Lots of activity, but not too loud.  The meal was quite good, but our waiter nearly ruined it.   Example one: Three of us ordered white sangria and one ordered red sangria.  The waiter suggested: ""How about a pitcher of white?""  I said, ""Sure, but he still wants the red.""  So, we received a pitcher of white, no red.    Maybe we just confused him. Example two: Many tapas places will cycle in fresh plates. I thought this was one of them, so when I had a plate a little messy (with olive pits and various sauces), I requested a new one.  The waiter took my plate and disappeared.  When our next group of tapas arrived, I still did not have a plate (or utensils).  I tried to say something to the guy who dropped off the food, but he appeared to understand absolutely no English.  So I waited.  And waited.  I finally flagged down our server, reminded him I needed a plate, and watched him leave again.  Several MINUTES later, he returned and grabbed a plate from a shelf near the kitchen.  Unacceptable. These are just two of the multitude of problems with the service.   As for the food, it was delicious.  The bacon-wrapped dates were my favorite.  I also liked the meatballs and shrimp.   Very tasty food, but very amateur wait staff.  I won't be returning.",-0.4159,0.801,0.091,0.108,0.4047673706764616

Octopus and potatoes in olive oil with lemon and paprika.  Octopus was more tender than i could have imagined and paired beautifully with the confit potato.  3.  Crab rice was a perfect size portion of risotto-style rice with large chunks of crab, a crispy crab cake, and tiny quail egg on top.  4.  Shrimp, chorizo, garbanzo flat bread was served with some sort of sweet fresh cherry tomato salad on top.  5.  Duck breast with a crispy salty skin, diced Cabernet-marinated apple on top of a swoosh of La Peral cheese and a foie gras-duck confit crepe.  6.  Lobster, rabbit, chicken and chorizo rice soup. The soup came first and was good, enhanced with a slice of bread and neon orange piquillo pepper aioli.  Everything got better from there.  Octopus is a must have, served on a round wood plate and garnished with a lemon slice.  So fresh, so tender and delicious.  The crab rice was generously laden with crab meat and a refined touch of perfectly cooked english peas.  The flat bread was amazing.  The flavors of each ingredient vibrantly individual yet harmonizing into something new and spectacular.  The duck was cooked perfectly--salty on the outside which mixed with the sweetness of the sauce and the creamy le peral cheese underneath the wine soaked apples. Then desert.  Liquid chocolate croquettes with a vanilla marshmallow and rosemary-caramel came on a beautiful plate with just a dash of really fine olive oil.  Sweet pea-lavender ice cream sounded insane and was...But i like that kind of thing.  Rosemary-olive oil ice cream was the best of the three, while the mango-chili sorbet took third place as the spice from the chilies was surprisingly absent.   Some of the best food in town...not to mention fast intelligent service as well as a beautiful dining room.   I will certainly be back.",0.9989,0.717,0.272,0.011,0.5632884972170686

Walking in, you'll think you've walked into a small bar/lounge.  Continue around the corner of the bar and up the winding staircase, however, and you'll enter a venue that from an ambiance standpoint, rivals the hottest restaurants in Vegas.  Always packed, this is a place where reservations, even on weeknights, are a must.  Take some time to clean yourself up as folks here are clearly out to impress. Take in the gorgeous artwork, enjoy the music, and get ready for a pure Catalan dining experience that will leave you wondering why you waited so long to visit. Cocktails, wines, and sangrias are all wonderful.  Really valued that my server was knowledgeable about Spanish wines in particular, had a simply divine cocktail made with fresh fruit, and love the seasonal spin on sangria. Highly recommend the chef's plates of meats and cheeses as a starter.  The meats are sliced paper-thin and the cheeses all have perfect pairings of fruit, nuts, etc.   Bacon-wrapped dates -- I might seriously go back just for those.   Love the butternut squash dumplings with lamb ragout and black truffles.  The Ribeye is a solid bet -- mmmm.  A scallop freak, I couldn't get enough of chef Garces combination of flavors!  The shrimp, chorizo & garbanzo flatbread had delicious written all over it and did not fall short! I love dessert.  Save room for it here.  The chocolate croquettes are not only tasty but one of the more unique interpretations of chocolate dishes that I've seen in a long time. Had a phenomenal server the first time but not as memorable server the second.  Across the board, however, this is a place you can expect to offer stellar service and attention to detail. Aside from ambiance that leaves other tapas places in its shadows, what really differentiates Mercat from all the others is its menu.  There's just something here that screams authentic, pure, true to Catalunya...you just won't find it anywhere else, absent a trip to Barcelona.

There are many different menu options ranging from lobster to more traditional tapas. My only complaints are that our service was a bit slow when the restaurant was definitely nowhere near capacity, and also the cost. Due to the small plate nature of the restaurant, you have to order a fair amount to fill up. We overdid to be safe and ordered 7 items and had a couple carafes of wine. We were full, but wound up dropping over $200 for two people.  I have no problem spending $200 for a meal, but I would like for it to memorable.

The courses went something like this:  - chorizo and chaucuterie  - goat cheese with apple slices and a balsamic vinegar and strawberry mixture  - pulpo con patatas (octopus and potato)  - peltotas de calabrazo y cardo (butternut squash dumplings with a lamb ragout)  - grilled scallops on a skewer  - Lima beans with serrano ham  - rice with morels (more like a risotto)  - flat bread with braised short rib  - meatballs  - rack of lamb with an aioli and romesco sauce  - grilled ribeye with the same aioli and romesco sauce  All of the dishes were good, and there wasnt a bad one in the bunch (11 dishes!). But the standouts were the scallops and the flat bread. The scallops were perfectly cooked and could not have been any fresher, while the braised beef was incredibly flavorful. We also ordered a few desserts to share, but they were largely forgetful. Overall, Mercat was an unexpected surprise in an area void of decent dining choices.",0.9899,0.794,0.188,0.019,0.47612103174603176

The restaurant was pretty empty....it was around 1:30pm so that could have been the reason? Anyway, the brunch menu was pretty limited. I wasn't crazy for the options so I requested the continental buffet (meats, cheese, pastries, etc) but for what ever reason they stopped offering it just before we got there....(whateva).  So I ended up ordering the brioche french toast and the rest of my party ordered the steak and eggs. Although everything tasted ok....the portion were so small that we were all considering going somewhere else to grab a ""real"" meal.....but then we realized it was just the fat kids in us and opted not to.  Overall the food was just ok....nothing to rave about. I won't be returning for brunch nor would I recommend it. Maybe dinner would be a different story.",0.6811,0.883,0.078,0.039,0.4342857142857143

Mercat a la Planxa is located in the Blackstone Hotel on Michigan Ave and is an upscale tapas restaurant and it gets busy. I was so happy I had reservations because it was a Friday night and it was crowded.  I had dinner with my BF and we opted for the Chef's tasting menu for $55 a person. At first we were scared that it wouldn't be filling but they brought out so many dishes, we left happy and stuffed.  I actually can't remember all the dishes but the best ones do stand out still. The tiger shrimps (wow, they were huge), papas bravas, pulpo con papas (octopus and potatoes), the skirt steak with three different sauces, and the flat bread with aged asiago cheese, just to name a few dishes. OH, don't forget the dessert croquettes, pure heaven (Chocolate and Carmel fried with ice cream)  The staff was extremely nice, however our waiter was on some sort of controlled substance. He still was very attentive but his eyes were so far gone, it was actually funny.  Drinks: Know that's the reason I didn't give the place 5 stars. We ordered a glass a wine each and wow were we shocked when we got the bill. $24/glass. The hostess recommended the wine but it was our mistake not asking the price. Ouch. For our second drink we order the house sangria and it was good but I've had much better. However, the food was excellent so that made us forget about our drinks.  Price: The restaurant is very pricey, but its a nice treat once in awhile. I highly recommend it for a romantic date. wink wink...",0.9971,0.743,0.229,0.028,0.604
2009-03-09,2.0,"I'm going to risk the wrath of the Mercat fans by saying this place was just not that great.  The food was ok, worthy of 3 stars, but the bad service, a sneaky upsell incident, and overpricing knock it down to a 2-star experience for me. The dishes are very pricey across the board, and given the overall quality of the food, we definitely came away feeling like we had spent much more than the dinner was worth. As far as tapas go, these are some of the fancier ones I've had, though not among the best.  The basics and classics, such as bacon wrapped dates, were disappointing- you can get better at a less chi-chi place, like Ba Ba Reeba.  Fair enough though; this place is geared towards the exotic tapas, and some of them were quite good, like the spinach with green apple, and the short rib with diver scallop.  Others, like the butternut squash pelotes were weak.  More on the topic of this dish in a minute though. Service was really the big downside of the experience though.  Our waiter was weird and irritating, sucky-uppy and constantly doing the not-so-subtle upsell.  An occasional, ""excellent choice"" after I place my order doesn't bother me, but it's tapas.  We ordered six or seven dishes and really don't need to be patted on the head for our food selecting savvy after each choice.  ""That's my personal favorite,"" ""Oh, those are delicious!"" Yep, thanks.  The more obvious upselling ('What delicious cocktails can I get for you?' ""Which dessert would you like?"" instead of 'Would you like to order something to drink?') was annoying, but it was the covert, sneaky upsell that really bothered us.  We ordered the butternut squash pelotes ($14) and the waiter said, ""and that dish usually comes with 3 pelotes, but I can do it with 4 for you.""  It was close to closing time and there were two of us so we assumed he was doing us a favor, and said, ""thanks!""  The dish turned out to be essentially four teeny squash tortellini-  overpriced for what it was, but it turned out that they had also charged us an extra $5 for the 4th one, bringing the cost to $19 for 4 little squash lumps.  And if you do the math, you'll also notice that the ""bonus"" one was more expensive than the three that came with the original dish!  Overpriced already, not very tasty, terrible pricing for the add-on, and truly awful and sneaky upselling. When I brought it up with the manager, he seemed shocked that the waiter had not informed us that there would be a charge, and also said he was surprised that they would have charged $5 for the extra squash tortellini thing, and said he'd talk to the waiter about it.  But no offer of a refund or anything like that, just said he hoped we'd still consider coming back at some point.  All things considered, probably not.  Even if it had been cheaper and the service less sketchy, there are better places for tapas in the city.",0.9832,0.76,0.143,0.097,0.5054613935969868

Super stay, super food. I think not. We first went for lunch and were really hungry. The menu was good and had nice choices. He went with the ham and fig salad and I had another salad with cheese and veggies. Nice. Good sangria, too. Then it took forever to get the next dishes, like about 45 minutes. And we were hungry so it seemed longer and the other tables were being served and they were leaving. Finally, the manager came with the food, to apologize. Nice touch, good hanger steak and spinach for me. We thought we'd give it another try for dinner. That was the worst idea yet. The service was horrendous and we didn't even get served! We went to the bar at 6 and were told we couldn't get an actual table for dinner until 8:15. So we sit at the bar. They told us we could eat at a bar table then. We know what those are like, tiny with little doll-chairs that are so uncomfortable. We passed. We'd wait. We returned at 8:15, promptly. ""it''ll be a few minutes,"" we were told. At 8:30, we are offered the same bar table from 2 hours before. The exact same table!!! I told the woman this so she said we could have another tiny table but with a banquette for seating. Okay, a little better. Then she said she was sorry and would bring us a glass of wine to make it up. Next thing we have a hostess staring down at us telling us that we are lying about waiting two hours and it was ten minutes and we were relaxing in our rooms. I asked, ""are you lecturing me?' and she actually said, ""yes, sort of."" Wow! Then a male manager comes and gets in our faces and says that we are so lucky that they fit us in and we should have taken the first table at the bar because they take reservations for those tables too.

It was me, a white American, two of my Chinese friends, and two of their Polish friends.  We all spoke perfectly understandable English. When we arrived, it was a little late, but they were still posted to be open for another hour.  There were plenty of empty tables and yet the hostess looked put-upon when I asked for a table as opposed to sitting at the bar. I'm pretty familiar with tapas and Spanish food in general, but not an expert by any means.  So we had a few questions about the meal.  The server had a difficult time answering our questions and had to go to the kitchen to get some of the answers - and they weren't complicated, esoteric questions. The dishes came out in odd orders, and some of them were cold.  I thought the scallops were poor quality - they were flat and tired looking - I actually think they may have been skate, not an acceptable substitution at a restaurant that charges this much. Which brings me to another thing - pricing.  It's a nice enough space, but their pricing is overboard.  Flavors were mixed - some plates were awesome, others were watery and missed the ball.  Neither food nor service were really up to the level needed at their price point.

We ended with a cheese plate--three cheeses chosen by the chef,  We felt like the chef did not let us down with the dishes we chose for our meal, so he could do no wrong choosing the cheeses.  It was well worth getting the thee cheese selection.  The accompaniments that came with the cheeses were all delicious, adding to the pleasure of eating the cheeses. In addition to the cheese plate, we also shared a dessert: a sheep's cheese torta, which was more like a warm cross between a souffle and a cheesecake.  Heavenly.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  The food is inventive and very high quality.  The atmosphere is chic but not too trendy.  I love the cavernous dining room and the beautiful murals, and was grateful that it was not at all loud or overcrowded (Maybe because it was a Monday night?).  I had one of the best meals I've had in recent memory.  I'd definitely recommend it to others and of course eat there again myself.",0.9982,0.719,0.252,0.029,0.582167901234568

It turned out to be one of the most disappointing dining experiences we've had in a long time.  The ambiance: The restaurant is on the first floor and looks like it used to be a club or something. The seating area is in a 'pit' that probably was a dance floor. Everything was too dark and sort of loud for a 'fine dining' restaurant. The tables were too small and too close together. We were easily within a foot of the people sitting next to us and it was uncomfortable to say the least.  The Service: Decent enough. Although they brought out everything we ordered at the same time.

We spent most of the evening maneuvering our arms and hands around plates and glasses just so we could eat without knocking something over (and probably into the laps of the people next to us).  The food: Terrible. Everything was cold. Nothing lived up to expectations. We got a charred green onion dish and it turned out to be something one can make at a campfire. Take a bunch of scallions drowned in olive oil and throw 'em over a fire. Although then you wouldn't have the pleasure of paying 8 bucks for it. We couldn't eat it and had to send it back (but they did not take it off our check).  The raw cow's milk cheese wasn't very good either and came with a strange assortment of lavender jam (which tasted like everything but lavender) and sliced stale baguette and apples..not sure how one eats apples, cheese, bread and jam together. The only decent dish was the confit tomatoes and roasted cipollini onions.   ( I dont think its important enough for me to look up the actual names of dishes since they all sucked anyway) The drinks: Simply crap. $10 bucks for a 'caliente' which was supposed to be mango nectar and orange liqueur and soda water and chilli powder. The drink had no taste of its own - the only thing I could taste was the alcohol. The Sangria wasn't great either - had too much ice which diluted it further.

It totally exceeded my expectations of what the ""new and improved"" Blackstone has to offer .  I hear Blackstone and think old and creepy, but au contrare, mon frere! The decor was sophisticated and plush with warm glowy lighting that makes everything look lovely. Ceilings are way up there and the main floor is open and airy.  When we initially checked in with the hostess, she told us there weren't any tables until 10 and to try the lower lounge. Did that, and the next thing we know, we were being escorted via elevator to the 3rd dining area. It was less glitzy, more secluded with mellow brazillian tunes piped in. It would be the perfect area to dine with kids, but we were satisfied just to get in on such a busy saturday night. While we were waiting on our mojitos to be delivered, the customer service got even better. We were asked if we wanted the best seat in the house--a quaint little spot in the other dining room overlooking the main floor. We took a look and made the move. Stellar! Let the feast begin! My companion gave me full liberty to order for the both of us, and the menu accomodated us well. I'm the adventure-eater but he's darn near vegetarian. They had a wide variety of tapas and everything we had was presented well. Let me say this: they had me at my cranberry mojito and the little toasted bruschetta like starters.  Everything was tasty, but I can't rave enough about the pulpo con patatas (octopus w/potatos) cooked perfectly. The standout for me was the bacon wrapped dates. Wasn't incredibly impressed with the dessert menu, however, the dessert croquettas are like nothing I've ever tasted; like a truffled explosion in my mouth. Not a bad way to finish off a meal. The vibe of the place was very hip yet not pretentious.

2009-02-09,3.0,"I came here last week for lunch and I believe that lunch vs dinner at the same restaurant can be completely different experience so I can only base this off of my recent lunch.  I was torn on the decor - on one hand I liked it but on the other hand, it was sort of off since it is in the Blackstone Hotel - a recently restored and historic building.I realize they aren't the same but something didn't fit. However, I like the high ceilings, the windows and the bar area. I think it would all look better at night. Then again, I think about other restaurants that are vibrant and I think I'd say the same thing.  They offer a lunch special - the Catalan Express where you choose from a soup, salad or sandwich for $18. Online, they listed cured meats and cheeses as an option but I didn't see them on the menu. My dining companions arrived before me and I didn't ask our server about the meats/cheeses as they had already made up their minds.  We each ordered salads - they had the serrano ham and fig and I had the ensalada verde. The serrano was a surprising big portion and apparently tasted great too - the combination of the saltiness and sweetness with the cabrales worked well. I really loved my salad as simple as it was - asparagus, fava beans, avocado, green beans and a spanish cheese. It tasted fresh and filling - not like what you normally get in a green lunch salad - usually it's a bunch of greens tossed with a cherry tomato or two and a balsamic of some sort.  For the entrees - one had the scallops which were nice and big and freshly seared and the other had a grilled chicken dish. The chicken looked and tasted good, not necessarily an interesting dish but I think that for one who isn't adventurous and wants something straightforward, it was a good choice. Maybe it's just me, but I find that most of the restaurants around the Loop have these ""safe"" dishes on their menu for lunchtime. I assume it's because they get people who work in the area or are tourists that are scared by anything that has any spice or is ""different"". I had steak medallions - small portion over what I think was a potato puree. The server advised me that the meat was prepared medium-rare which I thought would be fine. It was still a little bit to rare in the middle for me but I was pressed for time and didn't want to send it back.  The service was fine, our server was a little slow in getting our order compared to how not busy the restaurant was - but not a big deal. Another server saw us trying to get his attention and came over to help.  After spending time looking at the dinner menu, I'd definitely want to come back here - I'm curious what it's like on the weekends, I heard it was packed and wonder if it's with hotel guests or people from the neighborhood.

2009-01-11,1.0,"My boyfriend and I went here after skating at Millennium Park. After reading some of the rave reviews here on yelp, I was excited to finally give Mercat a try. The space was impressive but as soon as we got seated disappointment sank in. The tables were so cramped together that we were literally an inch from the next table with no space to move around and felt no privacy at all for we can obviously hear the conversations on the left and right tables.  Despite that, I was still rooting for a great meal that was going to win me over easily. We ordered a variety of meats, vegetable and rice tapas. The prices for these were on the high side but we were willing to splurge hoping it was going to be worth it and unfortunately it was not. Out of the 7 plates we ordered, all but two met my expectations. The seafood croquettes and verdona salad was exceptional, the rest was abysmal. The skirt steak was served rare--almost raw. We expected our waiter to give us the option of how we wanted our meats but didn't care to ask. The arroz congraje was way too salty and I am a person that normally overseasons my meals but this just tasted like I was shoving salt in my mouth. The quail with foie de gras looked better than it actually tasted. The patatas bravas was just smokey and bland. The specialty drinks was extra sweet that by the time we were to the last few sips it was all sugar. The dessert was even more disappointing. I love desserts and practically eat anything with chocolate but the fried chocolates was just too much for me.. It was way to sweet, it tasted like fried sugar. We also tried the Helados (sorbet) and this was okay but not great. I probably would have gotten better quality sorbet from the gelataria at the corner of my place. Anyway, you got the point the food just did not cut it. The service was also pretty bad. We went on a Sat. night and there were only two waiters that were taking orders for all the tables, granted there were a ton of people walking around bringing the plates to the tables but they all had a set task. After the waiter took our order, we did not see him until almost 2 hours later. We wanted to add an additional plate but by the time he came around we just gave up. At one point, our table was full of empty plates that the people that were bringing the plates didnt care to take them (presuming I guess this wasn't their job) and just kept on moving them on the table so they can make room for the new plate. At the end of the night, we ended up with an exorbitant bill and a stomach ache. Although, the actual experience at the restaurant was not the worst part. Let's just say Mercat also stays with you the next day. Well, depending on how you see it. Let's just say you'll be needing some Imodium the day after. Overall, this place is pretentious, way too overpriced, overseasoned food and drinks and horrible service. With that said, we are never going back. Next time I am in the mood for Tapas I'll just stick to Cafe Iberico--unpretentious and does not disappoint.",0.9908,0.813,0.124,0.063,0.5059550653428204

2008-12-20,3.0,"I'm dying to give Mercat 5 stars, but I'll have to settle for 3.5. It has all the makings for the perfect tapas restaurant - a gorgeous array of cured meats, cheeses, vegetarian, rice, steak and seafood specialties - but it has fallen just short both times I have been. With some simple fixes, Mercat can live up to itself. The high points: 1 - The cured meats plate, especially the jamon iberico, is delicious. I consumed my own weight in this stuff in the Basque country several weeks ago, and this was a lovely culinary trip back there. 2 - The 8oz filet mignon was perfectly medium-rare. I didn't care much for either of the sauces on the side, but the steak itself was to-die-for. 3 - Simple, but the patatas bravas at Mercat are delicious, too. They're always piping hot, a little spicy, and decoratively plated. 4 - The cheese plate also has some very interesting accompaniments like olive caramel. Unexpectedly, peculiarly delicious with the sharp sheep's cheeses. 5 - Prawns a la planxa. Perfectly grilled and garlicky. They leave the heads on so you can enjoy the best part in the empty cavity. The disappointments: 1 - The pulpo. It was chewy. The smoky paprika was lovely, but I had to pick around the plate to find the softest pieces for my boyfriend so he could taste what it should really taste like. 2 - The paella, both times, was far too salty and burned on top. It's great conceptually, loaded with seafood and chorizo, but we had to request an additional bottle of water after finishing half the small plate. I also didn't care for the overcooked crust on top. It's important to mention that the service is wonderful - very attentive, courteous and helpful. Decor is also a major plus. The space is innovative, modern and comfortable. Although there are a few too many tables and it can get noisy, it's so visually appealing that I didn't mind. The menus - dinner and dessert alike - are memorable for their mix of classic Spanish fare and very unique flavor blends present in many of the sauces.  Overall, a very pleasant dining experience in a beautifully decorated space with a delicious menu.

Mercat a la Planxa delivered on all of this: the spreads of chef's choices for charcuterie and cheeses were both delicious, a spinach salad with fig and ham was nothing short of wonderful--the presentation in particular was rather clever, with the salad ""wrapped"" within the prosciutto--the stuffed dates in blue cheese sauce were scrumptious, and the scallops special delivered up my favorite shellfish in an excellent bit of spice. And while it wasn't cheap, it really did end up being a bit filling. The house martinis and the sangrias were also agreeable, and the decor pleasant, with a semi-retro early '60s mod vibe in rich, dark, orange/red/gold overtones (which sounds ridiculous, but it works).

A note about the space: the dining room has enormous arched windows that face east onto Michigan, so the room is flooded with that orange sodium light.  (A plus in my book.)  Also, there are several bar / lounge areas to wait in, with lots of nooks for chatting with a small group.  So if you're up for a kind of big restaurant experience: the food is fantastic.  (The normal small-plate place caveats apply here.  It's probably more fun with more people because you can taste more things, it can probably get quite expensive in that way, etc.)   Since we were only two, we did the tasting menu.  It was... well, tasty, but they don't give you much of the distinctive food, and the portions were really too big.  My favorite part was the wine pairings; there were three, and they were all really interesting and/or delicious.  (I asked for a list of the choices and our server forgot it.)

I didn't think 8 would fill me up... but I was wrong.  By the time the steak slices came at the end, my boyfriend and I were pretty full.  The dishes were presented very nicely and they were all tasty!   Fantastic variety.  I would definitely go here again.",0.9768,0.768,0.197,0.035,0.6919467787114848

A pitcher of sangria goes a lot further than you'd expect here. The restaurant is pretty & you have a great view of one of the prettier parts of Grant Park.

It was a weeknight, and it was more busy that I thought it could be. The atmosphere is nice and casual, with a hint of sophistication here and there. Too bad their food didn't live up to the decor. We had 7 people in our party. It was mommy's bday so I thought it would be nice to try something new. BIG mistake... I don't remember everything we ordered but we spent upwards $500, so I'm sure there wasn't too much on the menu we didn't order...We gave the flatbreads a try, the paella, short ribs, dates, mushrooms, baby squid ink pasta, fish, lobster, steak, sangria, potatoes, scallops, shrimp, etc.... Almost everything was either underseasoned or oversalted. I think the best dish was the grilled rib eye we ordered which is sad because I can make a hell of a grilled steak at home. The flat breads came in second to the steak. The Sangria was SO boring... much different from the way they described it in the menu, but daddy managed to finish off the pitcher.  Our waiter was mucho attentive, knowledgeable, and nice but I wish he would've recommended me to get the chefs selection thing for $55/ person because I didn't like the fact that 2 tinyyy dishes came out at a time, to be shared amongst 7 people... I tried to have our waitor wait for things to come out before he started serving but he said the kitchen was scared that it would be too much on our table.

2008-08-22,5.0,"When I heard Mercat had opened I was excited to try it out! I've been wanting to eat delicious Spanish cuisine ever since I had some of the best meals ever whilst on holiday in my favorite country, Spain!!  My first visit came after watching FC Barcelona beat Mexico at Soldier Field!! What better way to celebrate their win than dining at Mercat! It was also the final day of Lollapalooza, so plenty of people watching. I was with 3 friends and 2 of them had a long drive back to Michigan, so our first visit was kinda rushed and we didn't spend as much time as we would have liked. Next time, I plan to stay longer over food and drinks and soak in the gorgeous interior.  The space is beautiful. I love how it is reminiscent of Spain in that they've mixed modern with old world and used an array of colors and patterns throughout. I thought the glass wall with the etchings of birds (I believe they are birds?), was quite cool and the open kitchen is also nice. They started us off with some bread that took us on our food journey. We each ordered 2-3 tapas and shared what we could, as I don't eat meat, just fish. I ordered the espincas a la catalana - catalan spinach, raisins, pine nuts, apples. It was delish!! Very tasty, a good combination of salty and sweet, which I love. I had the diver scallops which were cooked to perfection and extremely tasty. Of course the patatas bravas had to be ordered because I was craving the ones I had in Malaga, Spain a few years back. Mercats were pretty damn close to those! We had a few varieties of cheese which I cannot recall at the moment. There were a few more things that I ate that I am completely forgetting but I capped it off with a latte and will definitely be making my way back for a longer dinner!! Definitely a superb place for those visiting Chicago and to those looking for a cool experience in their own city!! Oh and glad to see that Mercat is within the charming Blackstone Hotel space - So glad they saved the building and renovated!!",0.9969,0.791,0.2,0.009,0.5425925925925927

Yes, neither my months of traveling around Spain nor my Spanish gf had ever heard of fideua or paella served as a tapa, but there they are at Mercat: tiny, but beautiful and delicious.  I've been here twice and everything I've ever gotten or tried has been delicious. People talk about the sangria, but honestly I think the food is the highlight (maybe I just prefer no brandy in my sangria). So many options to choose from and flavors to combine. Anything with seafood in it is divine. Their saucier is amazing. Ingredients are consistently top-notch and prepared perfectly. Things I particularly enjoyed (again, everything was delicious) were the chipirones a la plancha (tough to find chipirones around), gambas al ajillo, and of course the fideua negra. But there is so much that I have not yet had and want to try on my next visit. For two people, expect to pay around $100 for a generous meal, pitcher of sangria, tax and tip.

2008-04-13,5.0,"This place is excellent. Beyond excellent.  I came here with a party of 17. We hands down received the best service I have ever had in my life. And I am a serious service SNOB. I waitressed for a long time and I know all the excuses. You either know your stuff or are a lazy sack who doesn't deserve a job. This place was AMAZING. They handled the table extremely well. Because there were so many of us we did the chef's selection. They began preparing for us when we were in the lounge. Initially I was concerned that with such a large group I wouldn't be full after something like that. Boy, was it the opposite! Everything was perfect, the service, the amazing food, their timing.  We even had a vegan girl with us. As soon as we told them, there were special vegan dishes coming out left and right. It was great! I honestly can't even think of enough good things to say about this place. It was excellent. I highly recommend it.",0.9925,0.708,0.254,0.038,0.6088949938949939
2008-04-10,2.0,"this was not a great experience at ALL.  the service was horrible, overall, and we got a 5 minute speech on what tapas were when we sat down.  annoying.  the restaurant was really busy, especially considering that it was a wednesday night, but it almost seemed that there were more waiters than people.  the people who sat down next to us waited about 45 minutes (!!) to get someone to take their drink order.  yikes.   the tapas were good...not great, but good.  my only real complaint about the actual tapas is that, without fail, watercress was sprinkled all over every single dish.  seriously-even my dessert (essentially, the orange creme brulee) had watercress covering it.  it really gave the impression that there were sprouts planted on top of each piece of food.   despite the bad service and apparently ubiquitouswatercress, this really would have been a 3 or 4 star review.  after we paid our check, our waiter brought out these complimentary chocolates.  so we popped them in our mouth and they were DISGUSTING.  they were salted chocolates, which they had told us, so we were prepared.  i also happen to really like salted sweets.  however-it really tasted like these chocolates were dipped in sea water or dipped in morton salt and then just thrown on our table.  the salt was NOT a complementary flavor and was completely overpowering.  after we got over the shock of that disgusting chocolate, we decided to try the little white chewy thing that the chocolate was on top of.  it was apparently really sour lemon?  i am still not completely positive beause it was just so disgusting.  it was insanely saltly, incredibly sour and really ruined the entire meal.  truly--it almost made us nauseous.  i can inmagine that the only worse flavor than those 2 things alone would have been those 2 things together which is, i believe, how they were meant to be eaten.  don't do it people!!  those 2 innocuous looking little chocolates will ruin your entire meal.",-0.9583,0.765,0.097,0.138,0.4907949931205744
2008-04-09,4.0,"Went to Mercat last night, and any of the early reviews with criticism of staff, their silly headsets, and any other nonsense must be ignored.  They have smoothed out the kinks, and there was only one earpiece in evidence, on what I assume was their rail-thin manager. As background, I was in Barcelona with my wife and parents last summer, and we found some amazing places to spend our devalued currency.  From the classic Taller de Tapas to a new, fusion joint, Bar Lobo, we tried everything.  As a side note, I would not be surprised if the decor in Mercat was inspired by Bar Lobo -- my wife and I both noted some great similarities. That's just the tip of the iceberg.  We were four, the magical number where tapas is no longer a wasted effort, and you get to try a wider variety.  And what variety -- Jos Garces has maintained a very close relationship with traditional Catalan style and yet pushes the boundaries of those traditions with insightful, inspired plates.   We ordered ten or twelve plates to split between the four of us, and only one was a disappointment.  The samplings of cured meats from whoever serves as their charcuterie were excellent; the seafood was impeccably prepared, and the seasoning was outstanding on all the dishes.  We selected the Black Angus ribeye as our meat course (and I ate a full helping of morcilla just cuz I'm a greedy mug), and it did not disappoint: it was perfectly prepared.  Brilliant/standout dishes include: 1) Squid in Its Own Ink, a challenging dish, and when it comes to the table, your jaw will drop, but the flavors and textures are perhaps some of the finest I have ever had the privilege of experiencing and 2) Bacon-Wrapped Dates, which, beyond the fact that the strong flavors are so delicately balanced, comes draped in the most amazing cream sauce imaginable.   Note: the beloved classic staple, Patatas Bravas, fails to taste like anything but soft barbecue chips.  They are oversalted and under-imagined.  If Jos could read this review and know that I love what he does, but wish he made different potatoes, I'd be happy. Our server was enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and personable.  I cannot point to any missteps she or the service staff made. So, in all, this really deserves a 4.2 or 4.3, because of its nearly flawless execution on ambiance and food, with no notable bumps in service.",0.9941,0.79,0.16,0.05,0.6234848484848485

My Wallet Wasn't Heavy Anymore!!! ....just kidding  ,  love the way that the place just opens up when you climb the spiral stairs to the restaurant .The massive windows looking out at the park are impressive but i agree the etching thing is a bit off. The service was fantastic, polite and attentive .       We went with the Chefs Choice and You better be hungry because for Tapas it fills you up . choose to go with our servers choice on wine instead of the pairings and was he spot on. It was Lent so for my date we asked for a more seafood laden choice and were told  ""not a problem we would be glad to do it"".  Everything was perfect and the final dish was lobster for two  ....WOW!!!!!!!  we were stuffed . Dessert was excellent.               There are 2 down sides - Only bathroom requires you going thru the dining area back downstairs to the tiny lounge area (so what right) , and if you are not comfortable meeting new people your in trouble because this place is Packed Tight , try getting up from the booth area without moving entire table!!!!

2008-03-31,3.0,"Great room; decent service and strong cocktails.  That's the low down in a couple of seconds.   I was here Friday night with a friend and overall, our experience was ""nice enough.""  I must say that there wasn't a thing ""bad"" about our experience; it just wasn't anything we hadn't experienced before.   Instead of opting to wait 45 minutes for a table (clearly we should have thought about this prior to traversing out on a weekend night), we decided to sit upstairs (main dining room) in a sunken in lounge like area that could seat about 4-6 parties.  Our server was attentive (albeit very very young, much like the rest of the staff here) and brought us our drink order swiftly.  Damn, my drink was strong - some red concoction with anise in it.   As we weren't starving and were only looking to graze that evening, we ordered the tortilla (not the name on the menu, but it's a lot like the tortilla served at Cafe Iberico), a flat bread with mushrooms and manchego and a couple of grilled (a la planxa) items, namely the calamari and tuna.  We loved the tortilla and flatbread, but the calamari and tuna left us lukewarm.   I'd definitely give it another shot, but with a bill for over $80.00 for 4 tapas dishes and 2 cocktails, I may wait a little bit before making it a destination.   Oh, the room is splendid; high ceilings, sunken in dining area with a theater style kitchen in the rear.",0.984,0.843,0.144,0.013,0.5130982905982906

2008-03-24,4.0,"Because I'm a hater, I must first note that there were a few WTF's up in here. First and foremost, one of my pet peeves is walking into a restaurant with 15 ornamental staffers hangin out and still waiting ten minutes for a menu. Get to steppin' folks, I'm here to eat. Second, what up with all the wireless headsets? The restaurant was half empty at 6pm on Sunday but there were still a lot of frantic ""emergency"" sitchos being handled via walky-talkies, with nary a celebrity in sight. Kinda diva. Plus, earpieces are so Whitney in The Bodyguard. And we all know Whitney is an I-don't-do-crackhead. Because I'm also a lover, let's move onto the good. The specialty drink menu was fantastic; really refreshing, fruity drinks with HEAVY POURS. I was knocked the f*ck out after one, and I'm 6' 2"" (with a booty) motherf*ckers!! I had the Shoco Cocktail (peach vodka, fresh sour, OJ, cucumber and sage leaves), and my friend had the Merengue (fresh strawberries, lime and passion fruit puree, grapefruit vodka). Mine was good, hers was insane.  We shared a couple tapas because we were just there to sample the goods; specifically, the Higo Con Almendres (bacon-wrapped figs stuffed with almonds) and Alcachotas y Seta flatbread (artichoke and wild mushrooms, black truffles, and manchego). The dates were wonderful, if a little small. Perfectly crisp, salty, chewy bacon wrapped around warm, sweet, soft figs. The flatbread though, HOT DAMN, where you came from?! Hearty, heady flavors; the vibrancy of a strong spanish cheese with truffles, with light hints of lemon to offset the richness. It was make-your-night delicious.

2008-03-19,3.0,"Mercat a la Planxa is the new bar and restaurant addition to the beautifully refurbished Blackstone Hotel on South Michigan Avenue. With a relative paucity of stylish bars and restaurants nearby, Mercat has the potential to be a star attraction in the area.  Entry to the restaurant on the second floor is through a curiously small bar which with seats for about ten and a large screen TV, seems incongruous for the whole vibe the Mercat is trying to achieve. The restaurant itself appears to be a very expensive refit of a large two storey space, with a high ceiling, gorgeous arched windows, naked bulbs, and mirrored walls.    The food is fine, but to me it was overworked in presentation and just okay for taste. There are no real stand out dishes, save perhaps the diver scallops (the current seafood belle of the ball) and the spinach and prosciutto salad. The flatbreads are expensive, as are the salads and rice dishes.  We shared the 'sorbets', all three of which were, unfortunately, a disaster: the apple was very fake in taste and colour; the lumpy blackcurrant tasted of raisins and was actually inedible; the third a very weird 'cherry oak' which made us wonder where the 'oak' flavour came from. We didn't finish them. The drinks list is fine, with to me what seems a silly choice of 6 or 9oz wine glass serving sizes (what's the point?) and bottles. The wine list runs predictably heavy on Spanish wines, the verdelho and the syrah I had were fine. There are several run of the mill 'other' wines available, Mondavi etc. Cocktails, sangrias and after dinner drinks are also available but I am VERY suspicious of  a restaurant that includes a STARBUCKS so-called 'liqueur'. For fear of encountering further Starbucks products we didn't try the coffee or tea. There seemed to be a ridiculous number of wait staff for what was untimely service. When drinks take longer to appear than food, you know there is something wrong... especially when at one point there were 5 staff behind the bar. Odd too was the penchant for two waiters appearing at once, one the big silent type who said nothing until contradicting the other; his partner a really annoying younger person who asked 57 times if we were enjoying ourselves. Having spent several hundred dollars on dinner for three I expect a far better standard of food, wine and service. Maybe I struck it on a bad night - and I hope for Mercat's sake, this was the case. Until I hear otherwise, it will be a while before I return.",-0.9084,0.818,0.085,0.097,0.4887425467614147
2008-03-16,3.0,"Tried out Mercat this Friday night.  Had 9:30 reservations and didn't get seated and our pitcher of sangria until 10:30.  I understand they've been open for less than 2 weeks but an hour wait? FOOD: Overall pretty good, but definitely hit or miss.  The diver scallops  were the only real stand outs.  Calamari was terrible: incredibly rubbery and off-smelling. Goat cheese & ham ravioli melted in the mouth but the portion was laughable; 3 of the smallest pillows of pasta I've ever seen.  Seasonal sangria was quite nice and the basil toned down some of the sweetness. STAFF:  Friendly overall.  They seem to be doing the best they can with an awful setup: the tiny bar and restrooms are downstairs while the dining room is upstairs.  Apologetic about the wait but didn't comp anything which was a bit outrageous.  THE ROOM:  Some cool elements but a bit theme-y.  Honeycomb spiral staircase was interesting and the tile above the kitchen is fabulous.  Offset by the fact that every window & mirror is covered with decals which sends it into Disney/Vegas territory. Tables were too close together.  Music was cheesy early-90's-runway-style dance music and too loud.... why can't they just play some new school bossanova?  The kitchen/dining room was loud enough without a techno soundtrack. OVERALL:  I would probably try it again in a few months when they have time to work the kinks out, but won't run back (which is unfortunate as i live 2 blocks away).  The bill for 2 of us was $113 and we left with a full belly and a nice buzz so definitely a good value.  Oh yeah, those headsets NEED to go!",0.9913,0.739,0.19,0.071,0.567840567840568
