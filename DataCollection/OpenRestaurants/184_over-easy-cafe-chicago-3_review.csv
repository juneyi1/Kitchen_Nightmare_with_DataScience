2017-09-01,5.0,"This place is fantastic and runs like a well-oiled machine! I stumbled upon it while driving back from a round of golf, and almost decided to go to the place 2 or so doors down because their was a wait. Glad I didn't. They've got free coffee outside while you wait, and seemed to underpromise and overdeliver on the wait time (so don't stray too far, the table will come up quick). I had to order the sassy eggs because they came so highly recommended, and they delivered. The weekly special of french toast was delicious. With both plates, the presentation was great as well...whipped cream dollops in each corner of the french toast dish, and the sassy sauce drizzled on the eggs with a twisted orange slice on the side - very nice. What impressed me most about this place was a sign that urged diners to wrap up their business after they're done eating so they can keep the wait down. LOVE THAT! Instead of the awkward ""I think they want us to leave"" hints that many places send when trying to turn over tables, this place is just out with it and it is great.",0.9881,0.794,0.181,0.025,0.6016335978835979

2017-08-22,5.0,"This is my first ever review on Yelp of any restaurant.  It's not that I lack of opinion or judgement when it comes to my expectations of a restaurant and a dining experience.  This is simply the first time I was very positively surprised by having each expectation surpassed. The service was great, someone welcomes you in by opening the door and allows you to pick your seat based on the size of your party.   Water is served as soon as you sit down with an offer of coffee of course.  You are then greeted by your waiter waitress incredibly shortly thereafter.  The food is turned around very quickly even for a breakfast place so much so it stood out.  The attention to you as a guest gets to the detail of noticing you are patting the bottom of the ketchup bottle indicating it is empty or in my case just trying to shake it up a bit to get rid of any water condensation/separation on the inside. They came over with a new bottle mid-pat.   Everything is very clean and well organized.  As for the food, it was cooked as requested and tasted great.  I can't guarantee you will enjoy it as much as I did because that is so subjective.   Little things I appreciate and is subjective as well are: the toast was left whole, but if you wanted it cut I am sure they would.  They also don't butter the toast, again which I appreciate so it is it over or under buttered.   I simply had a great dining experience and imagine it is something that would be repeated when I come back.",0.9774,0.847,0.129,0.024,0.469239800603437

My only complaint, which annoys me increasingly over time (hence, minus 2 stars)...their soda (in cans) is usually expired. This has happened to both me and my gf several times. Yeah, I'm sure almost nobody notices and expired soda won't hurt you, but it can taste a little weird or skunky. And besides, my general policy is to not eat expired food, which I don't think is terribly picky. They are nice and apologetic when we inform them of an expired can, but it bothers me that this issue has been pointed out many times... Rather than own up to the problem and junk a few cases of soda, they'd apparently rather rely on the probability that most people don't notice, which is a weirdly crappy attitude for a place that generally excels at service.

If you go, you have to try it. I am a huge fan of sopes, and haven't had a breakfast style before. The sope itself wasn't too thick, and fried perfectly.

What I did not realize was that my tastebuds were about to be in for an epic experience. It's early - around 8 or 9 am by the time we find parking and arrive, there's a little bit of a wait. Good sign! It must mean that the food is so good that there's a waitlist early on a Saturday. We were fortunate that we didn't have to wait very long, since there was only 2 of us. We were seated and greeted warmly by our server. We asked for recommendations/popular dishes and we settled on one sweet and one savory - the Cannoli French Toast and the smoked salmon scramble. Both dishes were absolutely phenomenal and cooked to perfection. The thought and creativity coupled with the artistic assembly on the plate really served as a great first impression. The Cannoli French Toast was incredible - not overwhelmingly sweet, just the right amount. The smoked salmon scramble was delicious, creamy, and provided that perfect savory flavor I was looking for.

I know their dishes that include pork tend to be very popular, but I do not eat pork. When I saw the smoked wild sockeye egg scramble with havarti cheese on the menu, I had to try it. Very good, but a little salty. The potatoes were nicely browned, simply seasoned, and perfectly cooked. I am a tea lover so I dibbled and dabbled with and sipped on some Earl Grey for a caffeinated pick me up. Needless to say, walking home was a necessity after such a great, indulgent dining experience. Dining here was a much needed great start to what ended up being a long, but very productive work day. Thanks! Looking forward to coming back soon.",0.9952,0.74,0.244,0.016,0.5490624999999999

Stay away if you are time sensitive, are dragging kids or if you have a large group. The tables are very close and the  Wait can be very long. The daily specials are truly special and the service is pleasant and efficient. They don't rush you but there is an implied sense of urgency as other guests are stating you down.

In my fifth attempt, we decided to order Togo. It was ready in five minutes - We have bought it for Togo ever since! Banana French Toast: This was incredible. The little crunch sprinkled on the toast was perfectly sweet. The creamy sauce was light and airy - and didn't make me feel guilty for eating it! The bananas in the toast was a good portion. I decided to add more bananas myself cause I liked the sweet toast with bananas. I loved how this dish looked so full and luxurious without making me feel heavy Sassy Eggs: This is delicious and mouth watering. At first glance, I was WOWed.

I contemplate licking the plate every single visit.  The BF never gets anything but the Sassy Eggs, and has proclaimed them his favorite egg dish he's EVER had (and that's saying a lot because we brunch way too often).  Yes, there's a wait no matter what day or time you visit. We could all afford to take a walk in Winnemac Park to burn off some of the calories we're about to consume anyway though, so grab a cup of complimentary coffee and get to steppin'!

Sometimes, my girlfriend and I will split an order of these and the Chopped Salad, which is huge and generously portioned with avocado and bacon. I would, however, suggest to ask them to go easy on the bleu cheese, as sometimes they can be a bit heavy-handed with it. One thing I did notice on my last visit was that the ""Fresh OJ"" was not quite...fresh. This is a new development. Being from Florida, I am a self-admitted citrus-snob (not that the average person can't tell the difference between minute-maid and fresh OJ), and that little switch-a-roo was a bit of a bummer.

Autumn Apple Crisp French Toast - (5/5) I swear you must get their special french toast, no matter what flavor it rotates to (prob depends on the season). This was well decorated, and the french toast was soft but crisp with delicious flavor. Sassy Eggs - (5/5) If you want something savory or just something to balance out the sweet breakfast options, get this! The chorizo jalepeno hash is to die for.

I also saw a few plates of corn flake crusted french toast with strawberries wiz past my table. It looked decadent and delicious!  The food was really solid but the staff is what clinched the 5th star. I arrived before my friend and was happily sat and served served coffee while I waited for her. No one looked at me like I was a bother for holding a table. Once she arrived, the server was spot on. She mentioned a few menu highlights, explained some lesser known ingredients ( I happen to know what a ramp is but I'm sure a lot of people don't) and was attentive without being in our face.

Provencal chicken sausage, roasted celery root puree and thyme scented sauce soubise on an English muffin. Does that not sound amazing? And it was an out-of-body experience eating it. The eggs were poached to perfection and dipping the chicken sausage in the eggs was heavenly. Over Easy, can you please make the Beaujolais Benedict a permanent addition to your menu? Pretty please? I'll start a crowdfunding campaign and have you paid to make this a regularly featured option!  The staff at this cafe is wonderful. I can't say enough good things about the people who work here.

The wait was about 40 minutes (something that seems to be recurring in Chicago) but they provided complimentary coffee shots which I thought was very considerate. We were seated and I ordered the freckled OJ and Bernsterns egg scramble.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu. Apparently, their brunch options change every week. I thought that was interesting. The options included fancy French toast (not the actual name), a salmon dish, and I forgot the rest. But our server explained each thing in detail.  The orange juice was amazing. I drank it well before my food came. This restaurant is BYOB so I plan on trying champagne with that orange juice. I'm sure it'll be amazing.

2016-09-19,5.0,"Had a wonderful brunch at Over Easy Cafe 2 Sundays ago! My husband and I decided to be brave and hire a babysitter so we could go on our first date since becoming new parents. We chose Over Easy Cafe because it was close(ish) to our house and it had really great reviews. We showed up on Sunday around 10:30AM which is probably prime time for brunch. There was a wait, but the host said it would be about an hour but hopefully not that long. He was super polite so we didn't mind waiting.  It was a beautiful day so we waited outside along with about 2 dozen other people. I sort of wish they had seating outside but we just leaned on the bike racks and on the windowsill of the laundromat so no problem. They had a coffee station outside so those who were waiting could still get our nectar from the gods aka coffee. Our wait wasn't quite an hour - maybe 30 minutes? - I don't know, but it wasn't an hour. We were seated in a booth next to the counter and the egg wall (you'll know what I mean if you go). It ended up being a good place to sit--even though the restaurant was completely full, I could still hear my husband and felt like we could still have private conversations without everyone listening. Our server. Was. Amazing. I was so conflicted about what to get - sweet or savory? SWEET OR SAVORY? and she helped seal the deal on the Blueberry Peach Cobbler French Toast. It was between that or the Bernsten Brothers' Scramble. The server said the Bernsten Brothers' was named after her ""Granddaddy"" and she even thought I should choose the cobbler since it was the last day it was going to be offered for the next year (it's only available 2 weeks of the year apparently!). The cobbler was freaking delicious. You have to love blueberries to enjoy this dish but it was sweet (but not too sweet) and was piping hot--just the way I like my french toast. The cobbler was between the two slices of bread so you could taste both the bread and the cobbler.  She also recommended a side of bacon--which was pure genius. I got the sweet and savory that I needed that morning. The coffee was delicious, as well.  We'll definitely be heading back to Over Easy Cafe!",0.998,0.769,0.206,0.025,0.53070029563932

Menu offers weekly specials that are constantly changing and a house menu that's filled with deconstructed breakfast favorites.  House special, the sassy eggs delivers deliciously bold flavors to eggs made to order. I had my two eggs scrambled over:  pork chorizo, jalapeños', cheddar cheese, ancho ketchup, sour cream, and guacamole. This monstrous dish was AMAZING and I highly recommend it. Bares the warning of a hot dish but I found it to be spiced just perfectly. ( low tolerance to spicy food and I was ok with it)   Definitely would not recommend ordering two dishes as the portions are enormous but my date and I could not resist trying the cannoli French toast !!  French toast was served warm and oozed out with cannoli filling in the center. The cannoli flavors combined perfectly to create the best French toast I could remember ever having.  Place is very trendy and popular so expect a wait. Definitely well worth it and a refreshing breakaway from your typical breakfast menus.",0.9953,0.684,0.296,0.021,0.5270476190476191

Food - Large portions! I had the Sassy Eggs which were vibrant in color and flavor. My fiance had the Banana Spiked French Toast which was not too sweet and wonderful with the Intelligentsia Coffee which he had ordered.  Overall, we had a great experience.

There is coffee and water outside for those that are waiting in the cold! I sat at the bar and was greeted by my server right away. She was very friendly and accommodating. I ordered the famous sassy eggs because I usually crave for something salty and I normally like omelettes. When it came out the presentation was beautiful and looked very appetizing. It tastes just as great as it looks! The sauces with egg and chorizo and avocado went really well together in my opinion. It is a bit on the heavier side for breakfast but I very much enjoyed it.  As if that wasn't enough I decided to try the spiked banana French toast. The ""spiked"" part is supposed to be rum mixed with the caramel but I didn't really taste much of it.

It was just kind of blended tofu with spice. But somehow no heat or true flavor came through despite it having salsa and guac in/on it. Definitely my least favorite. It came with potatoes, again not having any flavor, and over cooked, hard sour dough toast.

Once inside and seated, it felt comfortable and not too crowded.  One of my concerns when visiting a smaller restaurant like this is that the noise level would be high and the space would be cramped, but here this was not a worry.  There was a quiet hum of conversation, but nothing invasive, and it was cozy without feeling like you were sharing your table with other groups.  And the other patrons were very friendly as well.  One couple seated next to us appeared to be regulars who had moved out of the area, and the staff came over to greet them briefly.  And speaking of the wait staff, everyone was charming and efficient.  They never appeared rushed or impatient, and were happy to answer any questions about the menu.      There were many delicious-sounding choices, and it was hard to decide, but I went for the Bettina's Blood Orange French Toast which was scrumptious, and my boyfriend had the Banana Spiked French Toast, which I sampled.  I generally don't care for many banana dishes, but this one was tasty and filling.  The dishes of the other patrons also looked fantastic, so we've already decided we must go back and try more selections.  Very impressed with our entire experience.",0.9942,0.796,0.17,0.034,0.5075714285714286

2016-03-10,4.0,"Before I moved to Chicago in the beginning of 2015, I used to visit a close friend who lived in the Ravenswood neighborhood. After a late night/early morning of drinking 'water', we needed help with our hangover, and, for some reason, waited in the 1-hour line to get seated. Spoiler alert: it was worth it. Over Easy Cafe isn't transformational, per se, and that's probably the part I appreciate most about it. While the dishes are unique, nothing is rooted too far away from what you would expect from a classic breakfast experience. It's just done really, really well--and fast. There are rotating specials that serve as an ancillary edition to their standard menu, and by all means I would recommend trying something off of it. The Sassy Eggs are probably the most popular on the permanent menu, for the right reason. It's just the right amount of spice with the chorizo, and who doesn't love a conglomeration of potatoes, chorizo, eggs, and avocado? The servings are portioned well--you won't be hungry, and there won't be any food left on your plate. The space is small, and on the table cards they politely ask that after your meal is finished, you leave so the next group can have a seat. This shouldn't have to be said if socialites were decent people--but, they don't understand that while they're gossiping, there is some young Ravenswood couple with a stroller standing outside in -20F weather on a 1-hour wait desperately wanting their Sassy Eggs. That's correct--you have to wait outside. But, the experience is surprisingly pleasant. Over Easy provides coffee to those on the wait list. I have nothing but high accolades for Over Easy.

The wait was more manageable since they provided free coffee outside for people who were waiting, which was nice! The hostess was also very nice about the wait, and the rest of the service here was great as well. The food here definitely looks amazing and tastes amazing as well. I originally was going to try the corn pancakes, but the waitress suggested the special Cannoli French Toast Parte Due, which was a french toast stuffed with pistachio-mascarpone and it was DELICIOUS. Looking at it, I was a bit hesitant to eat it since I was afraid it would be overly sweet and difficult to finish, but this was not the case at all. It was subtly sweet with a good amount of pistachio taste and i gobbled it up super quickly! This french toast was super unique and awesome, but my only complaint was that I wish the mascarpone layer was warm and not cold.

The only con is the super tiny standing area in the back, but I wouldn't take away points for that.  We grabbed a coffee a couple of blocks away to stay warm.  (Note: they do have coffee by the entrance that you can have and bring outside too!).   I wish I remember our waitresses name (super sweet girl with glasses and partially shaved head), but she was absolutely wonderful.  Lent has brought some major restrictions to the diet and she helped me take away/add some stuff to make it work.  I ended up with  Sassy Eggs (a staple AND a must try!) with a side of fruit and the boyfriend got a Benedicto special that changes every week or two. Both were amazing- we didn't even chat while we ate except to comment or share bites and say who we should come back with. Also, I love that they have a couple of guys that come around to get your drink order immediately as well as keep the water filled.  I feel like it really keeps things moving, yet you never ever feel rushed.  Food came out SO fast.  Everyone that worked there was full of smiles, saying hi, and wishing you a great day.  This place is completely out of the way, but I would come back time and time again.  It'll be hard to not order the same meal.

The two egg meals I've had here have been satisfactory to quite delicious. Especially the Bernstein something-or-other I had this morning. Really good scrambled eggs and perfectly-done potatoes. The space really holds together, too. Kitschy without being obnoxious. Crystal-clear menus and a fun sort of retro vibe. A couple things I'd recommend they do to improve the experience: There seems to be a conspiracy underway to deprive Chicago diners of salt and pepper shakers that actually shake salt and/or pepper. Cramming the fashionable large-grain grind for both in to shakers designed for smaller-grain grinds seems to be the causal factor. And Over Easy is a major offender. And second, though this establishment has figured out that the built-on vestibule is the best way to keep their paying patrons from freezing while they eat -- by creating an airlock effect in which patron A opens door 1, closes it behind them and then opens door 2 -- they have yet to train their greeters in the proper use of these vestibules. The woman they had greeting customers at the door this morning merrily threw door 2 open just as visitors were opening door 1 and my gf and I were treated to gust after gust of frigid air howling through the dining room every time she did. Pretty annoying to watch my gf glumly pull her coat back on so she could finish her breakfast without shivering.

My boyfriend and I went about an hour before close on a Sunday afternoon which is why we scored a table right away, and didn't have to experience the notoriously long wait.  It is really small inside with no waiting area so I probably won't come back during normal brunch rush hours times and have to wait out in the cold. I'm not sure if this is a place where they call or text you when your table is ready.  Anyways, I ordered the banana spiked french toast and my boyfriend ordered a Mexican scramble that was on special. BOTH DISHES WERE AMAZING! The french toast was so beautifully plated I didn't even want to eat at first because it was so pretty! It was oh-em-jee delicious! My boyfriends scramble was equally amazing. So much flavor and heat! I overheard they serve sourdough toast which wins points with me even though my boyfriend went with wheat toast...  I will say that this isn't the "" let's sit and chill for a bit and chit chat at brunch"" kinda place.

I encouraged Gwen to give us a second #OverEasy location in Naperville.

I can't remember the name of it when I went, but it had eggs, caramelized onions, pancetta, and cheese. It was absolutely delicious. At $12 I was a little worried about how pricey it was. Fortunately the sandwich was absolutely HUGE! I eat a lot and I only ate half of it since I had a lot do to that morning, but was still surprisingly full. The side of potatoes were also cooked well and were nice and crispy. In retrospect I'd say that they could do a half sandwich for half the price and still sell a lot of it.

2015-11-17,4.0,"Tiny space, great flavors.  I dined here solo for breakfast on a Friday and still found I had an approx 5-10 minute wait before i was seated. The space seats maybe 40-45 people and there was always folks waiting for a table during my whole stay there.  Probably not the best place for big groups of people unless you come right at opening or at an off hour.   The menu showcases their egg creations but there is also a nice list of pancakes and sides.  I opted for the Nueva Mexicana Omelet--eggs, corn, tomatoes, red onions, goat cheese and salsa verde.  it comes with a side of breakfast red potatoes and toast and I also added a side of chicken sausage.  The omelet was delicious! The salsa verde is some of the best SV I have ever had.  It had a slight smokiness to it and that just elevated the dish.  I wish the omelet had more goat cheese though--but that's just me. I love goat cheese.   The potatoes were well made--so soft they almost melted in my mouth.  The sausage though---sorry but YUCK.

My friend was visiting from out of town and we were looking for a brunch place.  I thought Over Easy would be a good place to take her (mostly because my husband was not with us and he doesn't tolerate waiting in line).  It was also raining, so we felt that the lines would be shorter.  I believe this assessment was correct as we only waited about 15 minutes.  My feeling is that the 15 minutes was just about the right wait time.  If I had to wait much longer, I would have felt jipped.  My food was very good- I ordered the Nueva Mexicana Omelet with a side of guacamole (Over Easy Cafe people- if you're reading this, please add guacamole to this dish.  It really works well).  My omelet was delicious, but my mind wasn't blown.  My friend ordered the sassy eggs because the people at the table next to us had ordered this dish and it looked delicious.  She really liked her sassy eggs- especially the chorizo.   The staff were very friendly.  Our waiter was very attentive and other servers even chatted with us a little bit.  Our food came out very fast.  Overall, the food was good, but I wouldn't say that I had a mind blowing experience.  So, I'm giving it 4/5 because I don't really understand why there is such a wait here.  I know the space is small and the food is good, but Chicago has no shortage of good brunch places.  But kudos to Over Easy for being so successful.  I would definitely return, but only if I didn't have to wait more than 15 minutes.",0.9963,0.766,0.206,0.028,0.5972556390977444

With 4.5 stars on here I thought it was for sure a safe -nay, blow-my-mind, bet. However, while the staff were top-notch and the presentation was beautiful, the food was really, really bland. We got the Sassy Eggs and the weekly special Cornflake-Crusted French Toast. The Sassy Eggs normally come with chorizo, but since I am a pescetarian and saw Over Easy had homemade soyrizo, we decided to give it a go - much to my meat loving Partner-In-Food's chagrin. I hated to admit he was right about it being a bad idea. The soyrizo had no flavor whatsoever, and not to be finicky, but my guacamole came with the avocado stem nub (or whatever that little hard thing on the top of an avocado is). The french toast, though beautifully presented, was nothing to write home about. Additionally, the bill for 2 dishes and 2 coffees ended up being over $30, which I blame mostly on the price of coffee ($3), which is relatively steep given that they don't even give you real cream, but rather those little creamer cups (one of my pet peeves at places like these). I really would give Over Easy 2 stars, but since the service was fantastic, the place was beautiful and clean, and they let you have ""free"" coffee while you wait (though, admittedly, in very, very small cups), I'll round them up to a 3.",0.9826,0.75,0.177,0.073,0.5759082892416224

My best guess: When you've been waiting a long time to eat your first meal of the day, even decent food will seem especially tasty. The potatoes have a nice crisp, but the pancakes always taste of griddle grease. The breakfast sandwich, no matter how much the server touts its seasonal ingredients, just tastes like oniony eggs. The sugary sauce on the French toast is pretty indistinguishable from similar items served at any number of other brunch spots around town. And the coffee tastes no better than the stuff at Golden Nugget. With an eager crowd waiting right outside this small eatery's front windows, you never feel like you can just casually enjoy your breakfast, but rather like the protocol here is to eat and run.

My husband and I were in Chicago for an anniversary trip and, being big fans of breakfast food, we were on the lookout for a breakfast place. I used trusty Yelp! And found this restaurant.  The first time (yes, it was so good that we went twice on our trip!) was on a Friday at about 11. There was no wait, we were greeted at the door and seated right away. A waiter came over almost immediately and offered coffee or fresh squeezed juice. We ordered coffee, which turned out to be intelligentsia coffee- yum! Our waitress came over next and explained the specials to us- they change weekly and with the seasons. I decided on the blueberry peach cobbler French toast, and my hubby went with the candy apple French toast. Our waitress told us that their food comes out within 8 minutes... And it was true! It seemed like we had just put in our order when we saw the two most beautiful stacks of brioche French toast we had ever seen heading our way!! We were in absolute heaven! The candy apple French toast was served with fresh Granny Smith Apple bits and cinnamon pastry cream between the toast... Holy cow. The blueberry peach cobbler French toast had a vanilla bean glaze and it was topped with house made granola. We couldn't decide which was our favorite!  The second time we went was on a Sunday afternoon around 1, and there was about a 30 minute wait. The wait didn't seem very long, and it moved quickly because of their 8 minute standard- which held true even on a busy Sunday. Since I had already tried their sweet dishes, I decided to go savory this time. I ordered the Sassy Eggs- one of their specials. 2 over easy eggs on a bed of chorizo and potato hash, topped with ketchup and sour cream. Oh. My. Gosh. It was amazing. My husband ordered scrambled eggs and their bacon pancakes (bacon cooked into the pancakes!) both of which were great.  Both times, the service was excellent and the food was excellent.

We've been there a lot over the years, and learned quickly to trust their judgment.  The space is quite small, and as others have mentioned, the wait can be very long on the weekends.

2015-09-01,4.0,"I'm giving it 4 stars for the food, and the fact that too many truly awful breakfast restaurants are somehow highly rated on Yelp. I used to live a block away from this place and would order take-out breakfast frequently, and dine-in maybe once a month. I still live in the neighborhood, but I'm a bit further out and I can honestly say I don't really miss this place that much... The main reason is the perpetual line out the door. The average wait on a weekend is about 45 minutes (but can be much longer), keep in mind you're standing the entire time (rain or shine, arctic cold or simmering heat). It doesn't help that people come to this place from other neighborhoods (I swear it felt like they bussed people in from the suburbs - stick to your own neighborhood breakfast joint, this is ours!) They make an effort by offering free coffee - which is superb - but it's still a pain in the ass to wait that long when you're hungry. Especially when, once you're inside, they do everything they can to get you out of there as fast as possible. It's like herding cattle. They refill your drinks every 2 minutes (no complaints), they serve you quickly (no complaints), but then - while you're still eating - they slap the bill down, and unconvincingly tell you to ""take your time, no rush"" (all the while the busers are hovering over you waiting to pounce on the table). They're polite, but it's uncomfortably palpable when they want you to leave. Sadly, this is not a place to relax and have a conversation over breakfast - which is unfortunate because that's precisely why I go out. The tables are tightly packed and if you're unlucky enough to get seated next to a toddler or cacophonous adults, consider your breakfast experience ruined. It's been this way for years, so I don't understand why they haven't bought the place next door and expanded or re-locate it entirely.  I must admit though, their food is excellent (and that's a rarity because - despite a plethora of breakfast options throughout the city - I think a lot of similarly priced breakfast joints are overrated, with subpar food). Most of the egg related dishes here are stellar and they do amazing pancakes with bits of bacon in them - though it's all quite heavy. I'm a HUGE french toast person though and I dislike their varieties, which are essentially just desserts topped with pie fillings, powdered sugar, and flavored syrups. The huevos rancheros have the potential to lure me back (god damn, they're tasty), but I wouldn't travel across the city to come here.

2015-08-19,4.0,"Service: 5/5 Ambiance: 5/5 Friendliness:  5/5 Food: 4/5 I find that the true test of a good restaurant is when you walk in right before closing and...they serve you in the same manner as if you were the first customer of the day!  No long faces, no attitude, just good service. Honestly, I didn't intentionally get there late, it's just that I kind of forgot the address and had to stop in at the Perfect Cup and ask for directions.  Okay I could've taken my car, but why drive when you walk for free!  Plus I'm a cheapskate. They were so nice about it I made a mental note to go there in the near future. Nothing wrong with nice! Taking this a step further, I'm really starting to like this stretch of Damen in the Ravenswood area, it's not overly commercialized and it hasn't been overrun with hipsters, tattoo artist's, tourist's, bums, Lincoln Park types, or what-have-you and best of all it's clean.  It doesn't have that dirty, grungy, hipster look, like Bucktown or Wicker Park.  It's stable.  Call me old fashion, but I like cleanliness and stability.  It kind of reminds me of Southport Ave. in Lakeview years ago, the way it use to be.  Ordered the sweet and salty, which means there was bacon in the pancakes, sausages and eggs over easy on the side.  Hit the spot and I was left with a good feeling on my way out, plus it was easy on my pocketbook. Kudos to the manager/owner. The one with the beard. I swear he was the one seated right behind me keeping an eye on things, making sure everyone was doing their job.   There's a reason this place is busy and the lines are out the door.  Just try it and see!",0.9971,0.74,0.23,0.03,0.5831519274376418

I've only ever ordered the sassy eggs, and have since tried recreating it at home, with moderate success. Typically if something is hard for me to replicate, forcing my return to see what I missed, it's a sign of solid culinary craftsmanship on the restaurants part. That said, the rest of the menu looks pretty damn good, and once I've nailed the sassyness, I look forward to making my way through it.

Have you ever wondered how it felt to watch everyone who came after you be served before you? Well it doesn't feel that great! We were a larger party of 6 but it still it shouldn't have taken that long just to be seated! Then our server had the audacity to be rude to one of us! We were later informed that they were extremely short staffed... But that doesn't justify rudeness! Her name was Martha and while I don't think she is naturally a bad person she should learn how to deal with customers under pressure because all my friend did was ask a question! So the snappy response was completely unnecessary! So I guess the reason I'm sparing them 2 stars is one because of Emily! She was the hosts who seated us and patiently answered our questions. She also refilled our water for us at one point! She was amazing and is the face of the seating issue! Nonetheless she handled everyone, the pressure, the questions very well and stayed energetic at all times! I also gave a star for how delicious the food was!

On to the meal! I ordered the Key Like Pie French Toast which looked dynamite and too pretty to eat when it hit the table. (My girlfriend got the Smoked Salmon Scramble which was very good.) It was served over a vanilla bean cremé anglaise and stuffed with a homemade keylime custard and blueberries. The brioche was a very well cooked golden brown and had a nice spongy texture to it as well. The custard was nice as well and paired well with the plump and ripe blueberries. It also had fresh lime zest in it which gave it a nice flavor boost. Overall, it was a little too sweet in my opinion. Something that it lacked which would have helped temper the sweetness would be adding more of the lime juice to the custard to make it more on the tart side.

2015-03-27,5.0,"Its been about a month since we ate at Over Easy and I think about it all the time.  I never got around to writing a review because frankly, it got away from me as so many things do.  It was truly one of the best breakfast places I have ever been to (on a par with the Bongo room which is downtown).   We chose to go on a Sunny yet  bitterly cold Saturday,  The place isn't very big and there is no space to wait for a table inside,   We were to be a group of four so we arrived 30 minutes before our friends and commenced the wait.  You would think that this alone would have thinned the hordes waiting at their door to get in but Chicago has some tough folks and the prospect of a good breakfast is a strong draw.  After we were served our food and I had my first bite, I fully understood the pain endured and the extent of the privilege which I had had bestowed on me that morning.   The wait staff was apologetic for the long wait outside (they do provide coffee for those waiting outside, but we are not coffee drinkers) and even brought us in at one point when I asked if they could seat one of our friends because he is diabetic and has a bad foot. The scene inside was bustling like a bee hive and smelled of sugar and spices and all things yummy.  We watched as one tempting creation after another passed above our heads and searched to translate it to the description on the menu.  All four of us tried something different and we each tried a bite of each others'.  I no longer remember what anyone had except mine.  I had the Damen avenue omelet and I would have it again in a New York minute! Other than the No Reservations/long wait thing, it was really a great place for breakfast/brunch with friends.  It's probably a good thing its not in our neighborhood or I'd be there every morning.",0.9869,0.797,0.144,0.059,0.4899760765550239

2015-03-04,5.0,"Over Easy is the first place in Chicago I can truly give five stars to.  I've only been on this planet a mere 30 years of my life, but I have to say that the breakfast I had here was by far the best morning meal I've had in my life.  And to think it was just roasted potatoes, scrambled eggs, and rye toast.  Incredible.  No wonder there was a 30 minute wait at 11:00 on a Saturday!  So, so worth it. I specifically got their Parisian eggs (which were a special that day) that were these luscious, fluffy, mountain-sized pile of perfectly cooked scrambled eggs mixed with greens, BUTTER-braised leeks, Gruyere cheese, and more.  Each and every forkful was absolute bliss to my mouth.  They were so soft.  So tender.  So perfectly seasoned that I couldn't get myself off of cloud nine no matter how hard I tried.  Paired with perfectly buttered toasted rye bread to make little scrambled egg sandwiches was just a pairing for the Gods.  It was transcendental.  And the potatoes!  The potatoes!! Soft in the middle, but wonderfully crisp (with a crunch too) on the outside!  I've never had roasted potatoes this good ever!  They were all maybe 1 - 1 1/2"" in size and not a single one was overcooked.  They were like eating perfectly pan-fried gnocchi except instead of being the pasta, they were just potatoes.  Seriously mind-blowing.  I don't know how they did it, but they managed to make the perfect potato product.  Seriously one to remember for years to come.  So long story short - good Lord do these breakfast chefs (not cooks! Chefs, I say!) know what they're doing.  You may have to wait a little if you go to dine here, but if your meal was anywhere near as good as mine was, you'll be singing their praises forever.  And remember - once you eat here, breakfast will never be the same again.  It's just that darn good.",0.9978,0.749,0.222,0.03,0.5329472329472329
2015-03-04,5.0,"This is my favorite breakfast place in Chicago. I've been going here for several years, but it's only been in the last year that I have truly become a regular. I probably eat here twice a week now, and never regret doing so.  THE BASICS Over Easy is a breakfast/brunch/lunch place. It closes at 2:30pm, though I confess that I've never been here past 11am. The lunch items look good on the menu...but I've never tried them.  As other Yelpers have noticed, this is a popular establishment  It is also tiny. very tiny. The staff does the best they can with the space they have, but space limitations mean: 1. This place fills up quickly.  Be prepared for a wait. If you come on a weekend, they'll have an urn of hot coffee outside or, on particularly cold days, in the vestibule. Help yourself! 2. There is minimal room inside for people who are waiting for tables. 3. The hosts have to apply strict rules when dealing with incomplete parties. They'll seat you when EVERYONE is there. Not before.  4. Courteous patrons should be aware of their surroundings and whether hungry people are waiting for tables. There is a wonderful coffee shop, Dolce Casa, next to Over Easy. Head over there for after-breakfast/brunch conversations. 5. While Over Easy has a coat rack in the back, you may want to keep your coat with you during the colder months. This is because patrons keep coming in and drafts can blow into the restaurant.  The menu changes weekly. They have a number of standard dishes, but each week boasts a special breakfast sandwich, scramble and French toast. Sunday brunch features different specials, including the weekly eggs benedict. I strongly advise monitoring Over Easy's website and checking out the specials BEFORE visiting this establishment. This will make it easier to choose your breakfast. THE MENU The menu is an ongoing progression from standard breakfast/brunch items. The basics here are eggs, French toast and pancakes. Side dishes include bacon, sausage (veggie and regular), ham and the like. (Egg dishes include red potato hash and your choice of bread for toast.)  Over Easy then takes these basics and creates beautiful things from them. For example: Frazzled Eggs At first glance, this may appear to be a simple dish of fried bologna and eggs, drizzled with a wee bit of maple mustard. It is all these things, actually. It is also simply delicious. The eggs are perfectly cooked and the bologna is the high-end, gourmet variety.  Sunrise Omelet Smoked gouda, pesto and sun dried tomatoes make for one of the most delicious egg dishes I've ever had. Meat lovers: Sunrise Omelet has a wonderful savory quality that eliminate the need for a breakfast meat. Enjoy.  Sweet and Salty Pancake Platter Bacon-infused buttermilk pancakes with a side of delicious, porky sausage and two eggs. Sweet and savory heaven. Benedicts Benedicts are only on the menu once a week for Sunday Brunch. This gives the staff plenty of time to come up with amazing creations. It also means that if you see a bene that you like, you better order it: It might not show up again for months. Indeed, it may NEVER show up again. My personal favorite is the BLT: Spinach, sun dried tomato jam, and bacon with Mornay sauce. French Toast Superb thick-cut French toast that can be enjoyed plain (with butter and maple syrup) or in a variety of configurations. Weekly French toast specials typically involve some sort of creamy filling, fruit and a homemade syrup or sauce. Mmmm. THE COFFEE The coffee and tea is from Julius Meinl. It is absolutely delicious. The staff is very good about keeping your cup filled. SERVICE The service here is excellent. The staff is friendly, fast and competent. Ditto for the arrival of your food: Place your order and you should have your food in 5-10 minutes.  Once again, I remind you to be aware of the traffic flow in the restaurant. Over Easy gets your food to you quickly. Return the favor by not lingering when there is a line out the door. THE FINAL WORD I truly love this place. The coffee and food are great. The staff is wonderful and I'm glad I have friends who discovered the place. Just go, already.",0.9997,0.748,0.252,0.0,0.5788868410070942

We got there at about 1:15 a little more than an hour before closing time. I know that's late but we figured with the snow and the late time we'd be ok. We were told it'd be a 45 minute wait even though I only spotted 3 other groups waiting. Still, not totally unexpected. Was WAS unexpected was what came next. The host said that the kitchen closes promptly at 2:30. If we weren't seated by then we would be asked to leave. I couldn't believe it! What I heard was ""you may wait more than an hour to be seated and even then we may not feed you."" I found the hosts demeanor to be incredibly unprofessional, though I find management is to blame. If you can't accommodate guests you should close the waiting list or plan to stay open long enough to feed the guests you have waiting.

I began by requesting to sit in a certain section, in which the hostess happily sat me in with no problem. After sitting down and getting a drink, I was prepared to order. Before I had the chance to do so a man who I assumed was the chef came over and rudely told me that I must get up and sit at the bar as he ""needed the two top table"" for another customer. I found this strange as I saw while I was waiting that there were other single parties occupying two top tables. Not wanting to make a big deal of it I moved to the bar area and ordered my food. As I did so, I overheard this ""chef"" cursing about me occupying that table.   I have worked in many restaurants before and found this to be surprising behavior and highly insulting. I got the feeling that my money was not as good as other customers simply because I knew the waitress in the requested section. This treatment goes against what I know to be good customer service and professionalism. After I finished eating I was delivered my check, at this time another server, Gwynn, came to pick up the bill. I politely refused stating that I would prefer to pay my server directly. She then condescendingly told me that she would take care of it and ignored my request. This came off as pretentious and another example of how I felt treated as less than equal compared to other customers. I do have to say that my experience was not all bad, as servers Juvy, Amber, Marta, and all of the bussers were extremely polite and attentive. Also, the food came out quick and was delicious. There is no reason that I deserved to be treated differently than any other paying customer. I feel I was discriminated against because I knew the waitress and was young. In the future I hope that the management can learn to treat each paying customer with proper respect and equality that he or she deserves.",0.9609,0.812,0.117,0.071,0.4993003341687552

We really weren't impressed but I can't condemn the place on one bad experience considering its great reputation.  My mom didn't like her food- and mine- when it did come out- was just ok.

The wait on a Sunday was also twenty minutes for two, which was nice. Here is what I got: If you were to get one thing only you should get their signature dish, the Sassy Eggs. Sassy eggs were two eggs served over chorizo potato hash with cheddar cheese, red peppers, guacamole, sour cream, and ancho ketchup. These were quite delicious and definitely lived up to the reputation. Apricot ambrosia French toast. Layered with vanilla bean pastry cream, red raspberries, topped with chocolate ganache and served with Apricot syrup powdered sugar and whipped cream. These were decent. The sauce was delicious, but I felt that the bread was a little dry for my liking. Overall, would come back again for the Sassy Eggs and maybe try some of the other dishes.

2014-12-14,4.0,"I have lived in Chicago for nearly a decade now. Which I feel like should make me an official CHICAGOAN...however I have been informed that this is not the case. That unless I was born and raised here I will never be considered a Chicagoan. This of course is all besides the point. I am here to review Over Easy Cafe.  I mention my length of time in Chicago only to say that I feel as someone who has lived here for almost a decade I know the ways of Chicago more than say someone who has only lived here for five years. I know that over the course of time you learn to love Malort. That no one loves the cubs, at the very most people like the cubs. However if you live along the red line you probably fucking hate the cubs on game days at the very least. That Carol's Pub is the most amazing bar in the city and that if you want good brunch food you will wait in line on a Sunday morning.  I have only been to Over Easy Cafe once and I believe it was in the first month that it opened. I lived right up the street from it and had the schedule of a graduate student that afforded me the luxury of brunch on a Wednesday morning. So I went here and it was FABULOUS! So much so that I still remember what I ate and how good it was. I tried to go back the following Saturday with my friend and the wait was 90 minutes and I was hung over and I wasn't going to wait. Mostly because I refuse to wait for food (which is why I never made it to Hot Doug's), but also because if I had to wait that long without food I couldn't guarantee that I wouldn't wind up hitting someone.  Of course then I moved the half-mile away to Andersonville and discovered M. Henry. Which is to say that I also learned one other thing about being a Chicagoan...if it isn't in your neighborhood the chances of you making it are slim to none. So I haven't been back. But I do remember it being delicious. So if you have a free weekday morning...go tomorrow. If you can only go on the weekends get there early.",0.9813,0.885,0.1,0.015,0.5797186147186149

When we sat, the server brought my son diced fruit immediately, which was great. The annoying part of the meal was that she seemed bothered by our questions about the menu- just generally impatient, like she was trying to be nice but didn't really like us very much. Who knows...My mom had two eggs over a pancake, which she thought was very good. I was disappointed by the lack of a whole wheat or whole grain pancake option. I had the banana spiked french toast and it was just okay- there was too much cream and the center of the french toast was dry. Good coffee though.",0.7539,0.787,0.128,0.085,0.48185185185185186

He then politely asked her how long the wait would be, this is about 10:10am, and she responds ""Well at 9:59 I said it was 20-30 minutes.""  He told her ""Oh I didn't get that memo because I wasn't here, but thanks.""

Over Easy won me over before I even stepped through the doors by making my wait that much more pleasant. Once we were seated (which didn't take too long, I might add), the service was super quick and dishes spot on. My coffee cup never stayed low for long - I actually had to turn it away at one point. Our waiter was a CHARMER. He was so sweet and kind, and took interest in all of our situations, whether it was our first time to the neighborhood or lived around the corner. I don't know how he had time to spend even a millisecond more than he had to at our table, but he made it work and made it look good. The food was exceptional. We each got something different from their specials menu, and I was so glad to be dining with food sharers...talk about a feast. Each plate had an ample serving, and we passed bites back and forth.

Overall, I think there was too much going on here.  I should have stuck with my gut choice.  Boo hoo!  My other half tried the SWEET 'N' SALTY PANCAKE PLATTER.  The dish comes with two pancakes filled with applewood-smoked bacon & served with two eggs any style & three pork sausage links.  The pancakes were pretty tasty.  He wished it also came with a side of potatoes.   The decor here is really cute and service was friendly and attentive.  We did not have to wait at all which was great.

2014-07-18,4.0,"If you are seeking out a hearty breakfast (or brunch) with quality ingredients coupled with the savory and sweet this may be a great place to try.  There is something on the menu for everyone (including children). We first went here for Sunday brunch on June 8 at 8 am. We returned again, July 18 at 10:30 am. We ordered the John Wayne breakfast sandwich (it was scrambled eggs with applewood-smoked bacon, jalapeños and green onions, then topped with smoked cheddar cheese and served on a toasted Telera roll) and red potato hash (this was a $12 sandwich but it was a generous portion). My husband's final rating = 5 Stars -- My friend ordered the Tarte Aux Amandes French Toast (this was basically brioche french toast layered with almond cream and fresh red raspberries) served with toasted sliced almonds, powdered sugar and fresh 'real' whipped cream and their house-made blueberry syrup (not regular). She said it was light and fluffy, but a bit too rich for her taste. Her rating = 4 Stars. On July 18, my husband ordered the ""Sweet N Salty"" breakfast platter. He really liked the pork sausage links, but didn't think the scrambled eggs and pancakes were anything spectacular or unique, so his final rating was 3-1/2 stars.  My niece ordered the corn cakes with scrambled egg whites. It was really cool that the applewood-smoked bacon bits was inside the corn cakes. The sweet and salty made for the perfect amalgamation. The corn cakes were a bit too dark (almost burned), but she said they did not taste burned. They were light and fluffy. Her final over all rating for this was 4-stars. Both times that I have been here I have ordered the smoked salmon scrambler which is served with dill Havarti, red potato and toast (I had the multi-grain bread).  The cubed red potatoes had a crispy exterior and tender interior. This dish was/is worthy of four stars.  TIP: Everyone in your party must be present in order to get seated. Also, the FREE coffee is only offered on weekends (don't expect it during the week though). On July 18, one hour after we arrived tons of people were waiting outside for a table. I was surprised that it was very, very busy even for a Friday morning. I guess lots of people are (a) taking off from work every Friday (b) are unemployed (c) work from home or (d) are teachers and students who have the entire Summer off! I've experienced four to five star service here. I'll rate service with five stars (we had a great server who anticipated our needs at all times despite the fact that it was very busy and every table was occupied on July 18). Price-point, 4-stars; ambiance/decor receives four stars (it's very small) while plating receives five stars. Sunday brunch can range any where from $10 to $12 (depending upon what you order). I like that they have fantastic quality ingredients, and the food is always fresh. It is a small and cramped restaurant, so I recommend coming here on a week day. It is summer time so lots of people tend to ""work from home"" on Friday (or they work 10-hour days and have every Friday off) so it was fairly busy for a Friday morning. Come before 10 am (though we didn't have a long wait). Street parking can be challenging. However, since we arrived super early Sunday morning (June 18), we didn't have any issues finding a legal parking spot. We enjoyed our breakfast, conversation, and had a fun experience here. We found a parking spot almost in front of the restaurant on July 18, and it was FREE parking!  The next block south of the restaurant is ""pay to park"" though. Would we go back again? Was the food fairly good? Was service decent? Was the price-point reasonable? Did we enjoy our food? Did was have a fun experience?

I asked if there were other veggies I could add to my omelette, such as broccoli, and again, I was told ""No, we can't do that."" There was no explanation given by our waitress, so I just ordered the omelette ""as is"" but with disappointment, as I had been looking to visit this place for quite some time. What kind of restaurant in a major city tells you ""no"" to a request to throw a few pieces of a vegetable, to a paying customer? It's not like we're at Alinea or Schwa or something.  When the waitress returned, I was just so curious, I asked her why I couldn't have a vegetable, that was already on their menu, added to my dish? She told me ""Chef has already portioned out the ingredients for each dish, so there's a certain amount set aside for each menu item."" When I asked, so no one in the back can throw a few pieces of a vegetable into another omelette?"" She said (condescendingly) ""Chef spends a lot of time portioning out the ingredients.""  As you can imagine, this does nothing more than clearly state how ""Chef's"" time is more important than your time or your dining experience. There are plenty of other breakfast places in Chicago, who are more than willing to give a paying and 20-30% tipping customer, a few pieces of mushroom or broccoli. I'm totally willing to pay extra for an extra item in my eggs, no problem, but Over Easy will not tolerate such antics.",-0.6127,0.855,0.068,0.078,0.5266009852216749

2014-07-11,5.0,"In a nutshell: Small but quality breakfast place on the north side of Chicago. This place was suggested to us by a friend of my gf. We had dropped someone off at O'Hare and this was on the way back to the city. The door was opened for us by a staff member, and there was plenty of seating on the morning we went.  Ambience 4/5 Very simple and comfortable. The place is small, but the decor is really warm and inviting. Feels like you're sitting down to eat at a friend or relative's kitchen. They also leave cards at each table so you can remember where to go the next time you're in town. ( yelp.com/biz_photos/over… ) Service 5/5 The guy who greeted us at the door was really nice, and our server was even sweeter! She was very attentive without being overbearing, and was very knowledgable with the menu. She gave some great suggestions, and was very prompt with all our requests. Parking 3/5 Street parking. Had to park around the corner but it wasn't too difficult to find a spot. Food 4/5 Make sure to eat here often, because they have a seasonal menu that changes every couple of weeks or so....really cool! Here's what we got: Pancetta Breakfast Sandwich - A+ ( yelp.com/biz_photos/over… ) So. Good. The Pancetta really brought everything together in this otherwise simple breakfast omelette sandwich. Highly recommend this, but I believe it was a seasonal item. Damien Avenue Omelette - B+ ( yelp.com/biz_photos/over… ) Very good omelette of eggs, sauteed portobellos, spinach & goat cheese, served with red potato hash & toast.  Bowl of Granola with Soy Milk - A ( yelp.com/biz_photos/over… ) Cinnamon all up in this granola. It was a great way to start the meal, and I'm glad I got it because the omelette wasn't enough. Overall 5/5 Loved the atmosphere, service, and ever-evolving menu. Definitely not too far away from Downtown Chicago, so I'll probably be coming here the next time I'm in town.",0.9976,0.792,0.204,0.004,0.5119098822324628

I saw the server write it down and even saw the ticket, that said no sour cream.

We had- the scramble with lamb bacon, which they make, of course.  Local, in house, yada yada yada.  Yeah, those things are cool, but it's not my whole life.  My friend found the bacon a lil' salty, but bacon generally is, so I'd give it a pass/try if you eat lamb (baaa).  Lol.  I was vascillating between one of the scrambles (there are parts of the menu for rotating/changing specials and then the usual goodness) or one of the bad girl carb heavens.    I figured, I was only in town for 1 full day and 2 partial days, so I'll eat what I dang well chose even if I regret it later.  I had the blueberry cakes, even thought their key lime cakes and banana foster-esque sounding options sounded oh so amazing.  The blueberry ones had pecans and granola, and that sold me.   Trust me, you won't hardly need syrup, the blueberries were sooo good and there was legit whipped cream (not that bottled bollocks). 2 folks, 2 beverages- 1 coffee, 1 tea-that's me.  And two brunches of champions (pas de champignions cette fois, ha) will set you back anywhere between 30-40$, you could possibly get by on less if you didn't get the beverages.  Service was excellent, although they were probably wishing we'd get a move on and stop yapping so they could seat all of the folks who were waiting outside.  By the time we left, a little before 11am, there were probably at least 30 people waiting, if not more.  They have a great location and do a good job getting folks in and out, training staff, and cranking out some excellent dishes but maybe a larger storefront is in order.  Wowzers.",0.9949,0.809,0.163,0.028,0.45714285714285713

My Mai Po Benedict was a perfectly balanced and executed combination of...here we go; Poached Eggs, English Muffin, Homemade Jerk Chicken Sausage Patties, Pineapple Chutney and a Lime-Annatto Hollandaise Sauce with a side of perfectly seared red potato hash browns.   The other standout dish and house favorite (which are highlighted on the menu) was the Nuevo Omlette; Tomato, red onion, corn, goat cheese, salsa verde drizzled with sour cream.     Over Easy Cafe has been an A+ player in weekend brunch for some time and now I understand why.  I'm a fan.

The first time was in 2007, we had been up all night moving into our new apartment during a snowstorm with my wife 7 months pregnant, so needless to say, I did most of the moving. So, after about an hour of sleep and 3 days of packing and moving we decided to reward ourselves and visit a breakfast spot somewhere in our new neighborhood, we had no idea where! Well, we ended up going north on Damen (instead of south, thank God, or we probably would have ended up at the horrible Rail bar) and were lucky enough to experience our 1st breakfast at Over Easy. I remember I had the Sassy eggs, my wife had some kind of fruit-stuffed pancakes, all of which were outstanding. Clean, nice, fresh...the service was excellent and the chef/owner came over and greeted us, introduced himseld and welcomed us to the neighborhood. We have since been back for special occasions, when our parents are in town, and just when we feel like treating ourselves because you always feel special at the Over Easy, the food is always amazing, great specials, and super service.

The french toast was just alright, not bad not great.

I had a french toast special not too long ago, that was amazingly not too sweet, but hit all of the right combinations of flavors.

One of the things that I was told to keep in mind was to make sure to come here either early or during off peak hours; this place will get filled in no time. My sister and I decided to come here as soon as the place opened, which was 7:30am on a Sunday. Wouldn't be too bad, right? Wrong. We got there at around 7:40-ish (d*mn Chicago parking!) and were lucky to get one of the last two tables that were open.   I decided to order something different, so I went for one of the specials: the Barcelones Benedict. Two poached eggs served on a toasted english muffin with serrano ham, manchego cheese, fig jam, & asparagus relish, topped with a smoked paprika - saffron hollandaise sauce, served with red potato hash. I was mad that I forgot to bring my camera...the presentation on this dish looked stunningly beautiful. I hardly will ever order poached eggs because of the sheer rawness of the egg, but this dish didn't taste too bad. My sis ordered ""Emily's Dream Pancakes"": pancakes layered with blackberries & topped with orange butter, raspberry coulis, whipped cream, & powdered sugar.

It wasn't so visually appealing, but wow, it was delicious. The flavors were incredibly unique and balanced each other perfectly. My Sassy Eggs were phenomenal, as was to be expected. The chorizo was the perfect accompaniment to the guac, ancho salsa, potatoes, and other ingredients. I was definitely tempted by the delicious sounding specials, but if it's your first time at Over Easy, I would go with this house special.

Everything I've tried here is absolutely ding-ding-ding good. Bernsten Scramble, Sassy Eggs, Pulaski breakfast sandwich, and more. You can't go wrong with anything. But what I want to say about Over Easy is this: Care and Balance. There are new ""breakfast boutiques"" sprouting up all over, using quality, locally-sourced ""artisan"" ingredients. Well and good. Over Easy does too. But the care and balance with which Over Easy's dishes are put together just amazes me. I just haven't seen such attention to what something actually Tastes and Eats like, anywhere else. Each ingredient contributes to the whole, and the whole flavor profile of each dish just makes your mouth laugh. So good. As with most ""IT"" places - and you can tell by the crowds that Over Easy is an ""IT"" place right now - it's crowded and you have to wait, usually outside. Unless, like me, you decide to dash in by yourself during off-peak hours - say around 10:30am for breakfast/brunch. They nearly always have a two-top or a chair at the bar open and it's fast.

First, they're open early for breakfast, so we don't need to wait for the brunch hour. We have a toddler, so we're early risers. We gave her a snack before heading over around 8 am, but she was hungry for reals by the time we got a table. There was about a 20-30 minute wait, and the place was full of families with small kids. Apparently we're the only ones up at that hour on a weekend. The hostess and server were both very friendly, and our server offered us a pancake, a scrambled egg, or some fruit for our wee friend as soon as we sat down. Our kiddo is actually really cool about waiting for food in restaurants, but it was much easier for all of us when a pancake and fruit hit the table within five minutes of being seated. Not just because we didn't have to distract her from being hungry and asking for her food, but because she had her meal well underway by the time ours arrived--no letting our food get cold or taunt us with delicious smells while we help her get started. Win-win! Our food, by the way, was delicious. My husband had the banana french toast and remarked that it was sweet, but not so sweet that he felt like he was eating dessert for breakfast. I had one of their specials for the day, a breakfast sandwich made with eggs, caramelized onion, cheese, and pancetta. It was a little on the salty side (not really surprising given the pancetta, but maybe could have been a little more balanced with more sweetness from the onion), but oh so good.

We finally got called and were seated at the counter.  You don't have to worry about another long wait with this wait staff, they are all very efficient.  Water and menus were given to us immediately and coffee was offered.  We placed our order with our waitress shortly after.  My friend ordered the la dolce vita benedict (two poached eggs served with caramelized onion jam and prime rib roast on top of English muffins, topped off with truffled taleggio cheese and served with a side of potatoes) while I got the pumpkin pie french toast (brioche bread layered with a mixture of pumpkin, ricotta, and mascarpone, drizzled with rum caramel sauce and topped off with pecans, powdered sugar, whipped cream and a graham cracker.)  The entrées' looked as good as it tasted.  My friend's dish was cooked perfectly: eggs were runny, the ribs were tender, and the cheese was warm and bubbly.  I also enjoyed my french toast.  It wasn't overly sweet so it didn't overpower the pumpkin taste.   You'll probably never find the same dishes that someone else had the following week because they have a rotating menu every week, but you'll always find something that is delicious and unique.  The impeccable service and wonderful food definitely made the hour long wait worth it.",0.9969,0.771,0.219,0.01,0.5296850998463901

I loved their changing menu, it really spoke to the idea of fresh and locally grown foods.  Everything felt like it had been picked from the vine or snagged right below a chicken.  They also do a great job of experimenting with different ingredients like tortilla chips in a huevos rancheros style omelette, delicious! The absolutely best part of the place is pricing, you really get your bang for your buck with portion sizing.  I'm not sure if most of my choice brunch places usually have most of their menu at or under $10, it's really nice.  I also appreciate the owner who came by after we had waited over an hour.  Very sweet lady, humble and never once said she was the owner.  Just felt like she was abolsutely supportive of her staff and made you feel the team spirit.

It's not a massive-sized place, which I guess explains the long wait, but they move fast!  My fresh squeezed orange juice appeared quickly and tasted delicious.  Our server was super friendly and complimented my friend on her TARDIS shirt, and engaged in some friendly Dr. Who chat before taking our order.  Nice that she didn't make us feel rushed!  I went with the sassy eggs, like everyone else, but I subbed in veggie chorizo.  Very nice touch to be able to do that!  I got the eggs sunny side up. What seemed like merely five minutes later, this beautiful plate was before me.  Potato-chorizo hash was hidden under two sunny side up eggs, which in turn were covered with cheese, diced bell and jalapeno peppers, a drizzle of sour cream, a dab of guacamole, and another drizzle of ancho ketchup.  WOWZA.  So much happening!  Everything was cooked wonderfully, with the eggs perfectly done, the guacamole fresh, and the ancho ketchup adding just the right flavor to each bite.  My one complaint was the veggie chorizo, which felt greasy to me. Still, it's nice that they can make it vegetarian if need be.  The multigrain bread alongside was basically just wheat toast you could buy at the store, with whipped butter coming from packets on the table.   They have a very interesting menu here, loaded with weekly specials and creative choices for egg dishes and sweet breakfasts alike.  I definitely admire the innovation and thought the dish was incredibly well-balanced in terms of flavors.  I would be happy to come back and try almost anything else.  Great place to try something out-of-the-ordinary, but my friend ordered simple scrambled eggs and pancakes and she seemed to think they were pretty fantastic too!",0.9992,0.697,0.291,0.012,0.5760741971207086

I really liked the food but I'm not sure I had a moment where I gasped in shocked splendor...just a very strong all-around performance by the Cafe.  We tried a scramble that might have had chicken sausage (The Chicken or The Egg Scramble, maybe?); this was delicious.  It wasn't anything I had never seen before, just very well executed.  I got the corn flake french toast; original, crunchy, the strawberry syrup was a nice touch.  But even I had to admit later that it was ""just"" french toast, even if the coating was tasty. And for better or worse (better for my wife, worse for me), for the price I'm looking to leave full, but the portion sizes at Over Easy are relatively non-Chicago...damn near European, really.  As it is, I left sort of full but definitely not stuffed.  This is important if you are the classic Hungry Man, because if you are thinking you'll be getting Bongo Room portion sizes you are mistaken.  I was considering getting a donut after leaving this brunch...it's actually a better breakfast size than a brunch size, if you will.  As the first of three meals in a day, you can put this down without a problem.

We were immediately greeted by a friendly staff member who opened the door for us and got us a table right away. Just seconds after sitting down, our server came to take our order, was very cheerful and gave us excellent recommendations. Less than 10 minutes later, our food arrived, hands down the best omelette I've ever had (Damen Avenue Omelette) and the lamb bacon was the perfect   combination of sweet and salty with a hint of smokey  flavor. We talked to the owner who was very much a down to earth gentleman, our server was attentive throughout the meal, and our glasses were never empty. Our bill came quickly and we were in and out within a half an hour. I never write reviews, but felt I owed it to this fantastic restaurant.

Once inside, you'll appreciate the wait because you are welcomed by friendly and knowledgeable staff that attend to your every personal need. I ordered the Strawberry Rhubarb French toast that was quite sweet but very delicious! I love anything sweet and this was an awesome experience. It just melted in my mouth and I felt like I would have kept on eating if more servings came my way. Since then, I have gone back and ordered pancakes with the blackberries and orange butter coupled with omelet Mexican style. It just gets better and better.

2013-04-15,5.0,"This is by far the best breakfast place I have ever been too.  The service is excellent and extremely friendly, its just a very well oiled machine. I have been to this place at least half a dozen times, introduced to the restaurant by my sister, and have introduced many others to this restaurant since then, no one nor I have ever observed any issues with their food, its just as close as it gets to perfection in breakfast. A warning is needed however, this is not the place you go to and expect to sit down immediately, or a place that you call to reserve your spot, if you are not among the first to show up, expect to wait outside of the restaurant for 30-90 minutes along with everyone else.  You will have access to coffee that is placed outside for people to consume as they wait, and this is the first introduction to the quality of their food.  I hate coffee in general, but I have to admit, their coffee is the only one I not only tolerate but will gladly drink, you can sense the quality of their coffee, it is great.  Considering how long the wait was you might expect that the reason may have been the result of people waiting for their food and might think that you need to get ready for that, but you cannot imagine how wrong you are when no more than 2 minutes later you are already served, even if you mentioned to add more or take away an ingredient, its like magic, the presentation of the food is just spectacular, it looks like it was taken out of a picture advertising the food.  And then there is that first bite, where you realize this is probably the best food, not just breakfast food, but food in general that you have ever tried.  You find yourself downing the food very fast and not talking to your friends because you just can't get enough of the flavor.  Even the orange tastes like the best orange you have ever tried. After so many times visiting this restaurant I highly recommend their orange juice, its perfection in a bottle and the best orange juice I have ever tried, the only time something even got remotely close was this time when there was an orange tree growing outside of my house in Miami, Fl that my dad would pick up a few pounds of oranges and squeeze them, its that fresh. I would refrain from ordering the chocolate milk, so far it has been the only item in their menu that did not taste special, with that sole exception, everything else has been the best I have tried. I highly recommend this place and I will continue to take friends and family there to introduce them to what may be the best breakfast place in town.",0.998,0.805,0.173,0.021,0.5195205026455028

I love simple brunch food - hash browns, french toast, omelette, pancakes, etc. So we went there for brunch on Sunday and sure enough there was a 20 minute wait, so we waited outside and they had provided free warm coffee outside, which helped because it was freezing outside, which was a really good idea on their part. Once we got seated our server quickly took our order and our food came out very quickly also, which was great because I was starving! Which by the way... the service is amazing! I ordered the banana spiked french toast, it was really good, a bit too sweet for ME though, maybe if they didn't put so much banana cream I would've loved it, nonetheless it was really good... I would definitely recommend it! My husband ordered the nueva mexicana omelette  and the Antonio Gramsci's breakfast sandwich . The omelette was really good, I liked the sauce they drizzled on the top, I felt like it completely changed the taste of the omelette.  As for the sandwich, it was pretty good... I liked the sausage bites that were in it, my husband loved it. My only complaint would be their red potato hash, I'm really big on hash browns/potatoes, and I did not like them at all, they were pretty bland.  Over all it was a good experience and they definitely have a unique touch to their food.

I was excited when our waitress, Cassidy, asked if I wanted anything with my tea and was offered soy milk.  Good start. Moments later, that tune quickly changed.  I was quickly shut down when I asked questions about the menu and the possibility of having a tofu substitute for one of the special egg scrambles offered today.  WHOAH!  Cassidy, I appreciate your adherence to ""chef policy"" and your interest in efficiency.  Unfortunately, it was at the expense of entertaining the actual needs of your customers. Your response and your need to keep things quick, mainstream and efficient were rude.   Your attitude lost you a set of new customers who were very interested in experiencing your eatery for the first time.  To the Chef/Owner, I can't imagine that when making a scramble fresh anyway, that substituting tofu and arugula would throw your balance completely off when the items are already on the menu.  I was disheartened by my experience and disappointed in what might have been... had someone taken a moment to really listen before responding.

Changes up specials weekly and their breakfast sandwich is always amazing. 2) While there is a wait sometimes, they move tables so fast w/out making you feel rushed for one second. They just know you sometimes want to get in and out, and will always get you your food within 5'ish minutes from when you place your order. 3) You won't be able to get your coffee less than half full bc they are constantly circling and filling it up (if you want it filled up). They do this on all drinks to make sure you're set without having to seek anyone out.  4) The wait staff is extremely nice - all of them. And I've now been here at least 15 times and it's always the same people.. you can tell they really like working there.  5) Need to go back to the food. Sassy eggs might be my 2nd favorite, but whether you are looking for salty or sweet, they have so many delicious options.  I like this place to eat in or to go. I do call in often bc I know there will be a wait at prime times, so I order take-out and can pick it up less than 10 minutes later up at their food bar area without any delays.

I usually take my friends to brunch whenever they're visiting and in the past we've gone to The Bongo Room and Pick Me Up Cafe--both pretty decent in their own right--but OEC gets the medal for near-perfect brunch experience. I decided to avoid the trek to either of the aforementioned places and visit this brunch place closer to home. My friend and I got here at noon on Tuesday on a very cold March day and there were a few tables to choose from. It's definitely a tiny place, but if you can come in during the week you can avoid a wait. The place is pretty cute, although they could benefit from expanding a little bit; it would boost the ambiance. That being said, like most good brunch places, it was so busy the hustle and bustle really distracted from the surroundings. I ordered the breakfast sandwich special of the week--""Antonio Gramsci's Favorite Breakfast Sandwich"" (mostly for the awesome name)--and a lemonade. My friend ordered the Sassy Eggs and we got an order of Emily's Dream Pancakes to share.  Our food got to us quickly and was presented wonderfully. The sandwich was delicious and big enough to last two meals. What sealed the deal for me were the potatoes--absolutely perfectly cooked red potatoes. Most places tend to overcook them or season them poorly, but OEC's potatoes were perfect. The lemonade was amazing and fresh. My friend ate all of her dish and really liked it. We were pretty full when we moved on to Emily's Dream Pancakes, but they were delicious too. The blackberries tasted fresh, the pancakes were perfectly fluffy, and the orange butter complemented the dish wonderfully.

They offered a handful of daily specials, and I selected an egg scramble special while my friend ordered Frazzled Eggs.  My eggs were very good though I was a bit stuffed from the pancakes.  She seemed to enjoy her dish as well. As you would expect, the restaurant is no more than a diner.  Service was great - friendly with frequent coffee refills.  I highly recommend Over Easy Cafe!",0.9942,0.715,0.274,0.011,0.6060052910052911

2013-01-30,5.0,Over Easy is one of the best brunch spots in Chicago!  I'm lucky to live close by that I could go all the time. I've been here a few times and each time it's been great.  I love going on the week days because you don't have a long wait like if you were to go on a weekend.  I don't mind waiting for a table when you know that in advance.  The free coffee is a nice touch!  My friend and I went recently and we waited 20/25 minutes for a table.   We were seated and our server came over right away.  He was cool and was helpful in deciding what to get.  Not that you could go wrong at Over Easy.  He pointed out that a few of the items were only available for that particular week. We were able to enjoy our awesome food and catch up on events over the last couple months.  My friend loved Over Easy we will be back for Sunday brunch again hopefully sooner rather than later.,0.995,0.702,0.283,0.015,0.5534832451499119
2013-01-30,2.0,"Me and my roommates have traveled to a new brunch place every weekend for the last couple of months. Over Easy is probably one of the most hyped I've patroned, and its unfortunately the worst overall. The food wasn't horrible, there just isn't any reason to put this on your to-visit list.  The restaurant is TINY. Because of that the wait will be unreasonably long. It didn't help there was a table that took up a quarter of the shoebox sized restaurant and thought it was a lounge. For the sake of the poor saps waiting outside, keep it moving people.  We waited for exactly 45 minutes for a group of 3 with the added benefit of being sat by the door on a cold Chicago morning. We got a nice little bone-chilling freeze every couple of minutes. Lovely! The ladies working there were pleasant. At least their hiring is up to standards I ordered a special scramble which incorporated ""pork belly"", onions....and some other stuff. It wasn't memorable at all. What I can recollect is the fact that the ""pork belly"" seemed like nothing more than bacon with all of the flavored soaked out of it. It was sliced thin, fatty and wasn't crispy, so it had the texture of rubber making it unpleasant being integrated with scrambled egg.. A complete waste of good pork belly. Oh yea, it was supposed to be a sandwich but they ran out of the bread. I wanted french toast, but they didn't have funky flavors like key lime or dulce de leche the other yelpers were lucky enough to get. Whatever they had for the day probably would have been better than what I got. Another at the table got bacon filled pancakes with eggs and sausage. It only came with 2, which he felt was kinda stingy(I agree).  If I lived close to Over Easy I wouldn't mind the place. But this is NOT a place you'd want to go out of your way for.

2013-01-22,5.0,"This place is so great! Now that transportation isn't a problem, this may become a fairly regular brunch spot. At 9:30ish on a cold Sunday morning we were quoted around a 30-45min wait with around 10 people standing outside. Free coffee! But the girl also told us we can leave and they'd hold our spot even if a table opens up early. So we went back to our car and she remembered us immediately when we came back 25ish minutes later and we were seated promptly. She was so nice! As were all the staff we interacted with - the girl at the front, server, coffee refillers, the dude who took our drink orders in the beginning.  Speaking of coffee... GOOD coffee. Speaking of service, great service. Never even half empty water or coffee before a refill. Food came very quickly despite the wait for a seat, which was nice. And presentation of the food is amazing. Everything was plated to look probably as appetizing and decadent as possible. Lots of drizzles, but hey - it works.  Tasted great, too. This first time we had sassy eggs, sunrise omelette, and banana spiked french toast. Everything was really good without being over the top heavy.

Anyway, the family and I came from a race at Montrose Harbor.  It was only 9:30 so dairly early before the brunch crowd got in.  We were seated withing 20 min.  It was a cute little place, bright and cheery.  There's no room to wait indoors and the option is to wait outside, but they supply delicious Julius Meinl coffee out there to warm you up and make the weight a bit more bearable.   The hubs ordered a special tostada filled with black beans, rice, mole, sour cream, ham (which wasn't on the menu description), sour cream, plantains (hmm not mexican like the rest of the disn) and peas (? interesting), and an over easy/ medium egg.  The hubs was skeptical. and the waitress wouldn't allow him to get the black beans on the side or to get the eggs scrambled.  Some mumbo jumbo about the water content not going well with the sauce.  I think the black beans and eggs could have been changed... and even if they made the dish ""different"" it was my hubs' choice.  We weren't substituting ingredients. I ordered the egg with swiss chard, red pepper, andouille sausage, and cheese scrambled sandwich served on a soft roll with red potato hash.  Delicious.  The red potato hash was a bit underdone, like they didn't let it sit long enough, or the oil wasn't hot.  It was more like oily potatos.   We also ordered the apple pancake.  Delicious and worth the 25 minute wait.  Not as dense or oversaturated with sour apples like at other joints selling the same.  The batter wasn't as custardy but it was light and fluflly with the edges and bottom nicely carmelized and crispy .  I LOVED it and the hubs surprisingly did as well because of the more batter the less sour apple ratio.   The daughter (8 1/2 months) fed herself some peas, plantains, egg, and potatoes but by far enjoyed the orange wedge, which the nice waitress provided us extra and even took in a bit of the rind.  Good thing we're not some of those parents that freak out over the unedibles that accidentally get passed us.  Hahaha And the coffee... great I do have a suggestion... you need a changing table in the rest room.  Granted it's a small unisex restroom.  But I''ve been to restaurants that have provided the little Koala care in there.  Therefore, your high chair to changing table ratio needs to improve.",0.9962,0.78,0.162,0.057,0.49176139272913466

2012-09-19,4.0,"Being an honorary Ravenswood resident, you can't help but notice the line out the door of Over Easy on Saturday and Sunday mornings. It's only open for brunch/breakfast/lunch, so the line essentially doesn't end until the restaurant closes for the day. I've been burned by this line more times than I can count... so we usually end up at brunching elsewhere. But finally the fiance and I were able to make it inside for a meal at Over Easy a few weeks ago. The design of this tiny restaurant is so cute, which is what drew me to it in the first place. It's like if Salvador Dali designed a diner without going too crazy with his crazy. I mean, the man put eggs on top of his museum in Figueres (Exhibit A:  flickr.com/photos/293097… ). It's one of the best places I've ever been, so anything reminiscent of that is a win. I had coffee (filled will frequency) and the famous Sassy Eggs. The portion is more than enough and it's was pretty good, though I think I'll try something else next time. The Sassy Eggs are two eggs with a potato and chorizo hash, cheddar, red peppers, guac, sour cream and ancho ketchup.  Good all in all, but the ketchup threw me off. I thought it would be more flavorful, but it tasted simply like ketchup to me... and that's not my favorite condiment. I ended up siphoning some of the tastier sauce from my fiance's plate and using a lot of hot sauce. It was kinda my bad for ordering something with ketchup though. I think if you're a fan of the stuff, you'll like this. Whatever the fiance got was a special, so I'd pay attention to those---his plate was really good! The service was great and even though my choice of meal didn't rock my socks, I could tell it was made with care and would definitely come back here (on a weekday, when it's not a madhouse).",0.9971,0.762,0.209,0.03,0.5739434523809527

2012-04-28,2.0,"So I am giving this two stars because although the food is very good, and for the most part the workers are friendly, I tend to find that there is a lot of stereotyping and bias there. I have noticed numerous times that if you fit a certain image or are gay you are more likely to have better service and get seated quicker.  Today I talked my husband into going. I had been looking forward to it. We waited 30 mins, which was fine, however I distinctly noticed three two person tables were seated before us. One hipster couple, one gay couple (they didn't have to wait at all) and a wealthier looking older couple. I figured they we sitting at the bar since the hostess asked if we wanted to sit there and we said no. But when we finally got seated I realized that the three couples were not only sitting at TABLES they had already been served. They placed us directly next to the door, and then ignored us for five minutes. I used to work in the food industry and I currently work in costumer service/ hospitality and I felt everything about this was wrong. I have noticed a sort of restaurant profiling in the past, but never felt as slighted as I felt today. We are great tippers, always 20% or more and maybe 15% for bad service. Like I said I worked in the food industry. I became so upset and completely lost my appetite. As we walked out the manager came up to us, but closely followed by the hostess. Like I want to talk about her in front of her... Very unprofessional. Then the hostess had the nerve to say the people were waiting before us. I saw the list, and confirmed they came after us, and even one of the couples said they walked right in as we were sitting (before we left). The service and bias completely ruined my morning and really left a bad taste in my mouth about how they run their business and value only certain customers. Like I said I have seen this in the past, but not like this. Bad service. Used to be one of my favorite restaurants, but now I doubt I will never go back again. There are too many good restaurants in Chicago to waste my time with this one. Sad but very true. They successfully ruined my perception of them, my appetite and my day.",-0.8922,0.758,0.115,0.127,0.5512458471760798

I'm happy to report that I was pleasantly surprised. Sure, I went in there on a Friday morning, but I couldn't have been happier with our service.  From the minute I sat down the staff was super attentive. My coffee cup never fell below half full, and everyone seemed very friendly. I can see how it would get crazy on weekends for brunch, so maybe you should plan a weekday visit first. The food was great. I ordered the savory scramble, which was delicious. It was the perfect serving size, which also meant that I didn't have very much left over, but that's okay!",0.985,0.67,0.262,0.068,0.6524691358024692

They are both equally delicious. Thankfully I went with the hubs so I can shamelessly pick off his plate.  Also, they had the Huevos Rancheros al Sancho. Apparently this item is not always on the menu making it more of a lucky charm to have for breakfast. My goodness if noone was watching, I would want to have both the Banana Spiked French Toast and Huevos Rancheros side by side eating both simultaneously.  The Huevos are three corn tortillas with chicken over a bed of rice and breans with guacamole on top. All the right flavors all the right deliciousness. The wait was pretty long (40 minutes for 2 outside on a Sunday @ 1030AM). They generously have free Julius Meinl coffee for the outside waiters.

The food is always delicious, though the serving sizes are way too big. There's usually a wait, even if you get there right when they open. For two people, brunch runs about $30 + tip.  I'd say under 30 minutes for the wait and as a treat, it's a great brunch spot. It would never be my every-weekend brunch, though. I think that while the food is incredibly delicious, I'd actually get tired of it if I went all the time and I really dislike a long wait between me and my breakfast.

I am amazed by their ability to reproduce each dish to perfection every time. I'm sure this is one of their secrets to longevity. The owner/chef comes out from the trenches frequently to check on guests experiences every chance he gets. The last time I was there, I am pretty sure he came out just to watch us take the first bite, he could tell how much we loved it by our expression.

They were very nice about it, and recognized that it's a long wait outside. They saw we were especially cold, and let us wait in the back by the kitchen/bathrooms with a few other people, but there isn't really enough room back there for that.

The problem was that the previously attentive staff was streached thin and paid us little attention. Mind you, I don't need a lot of attention. I typically don't like people. However, ordering food does take some sort of human interaction. So do refilling my water glass. To compound the problem, they were out of loving everything. We ended up ordering our 3rd or 4th choices. The food was still good, but just not exactly what we wanted.  I really do like this place and I chalk up our second experience to a bad day.

Then the other complaint about not getting seated with a kid and having to wait til all four of your party had arrived.  Why would they make an exception for you?  They make everyone wait until the full party is there.  As much as you'd like to think you are, YOU'RE NOT SPECIAL.  Leave the kid in the car, or get a baby-sitter next time and maybe you'll have a better experience.  I hope you tell all your friends with kids not to go - I hate sitting next to your messy, annoyingly loud brats.  So thanks for that.",0.9885,0.716,0.212,0.072,0.4721532091097309
2011-10-02,5.0,"Like all the places we often visit and kinda take for granted, it's been a shocking oversight to have not yet reviewed this local favourite. Only Julius Meinl compares for reliable standards when it comes to breakfasts, and we tend to divide our Sunday brunches between the two. Over Easy's key success is, believe it or not, their staff. There is no more fluid and efficient machine than the folk who keep this place running, turning over tables, refilling and removing, and at the same time remaining consistently pleasant and unobtrusive. I've never seen anything quite like it, and without it, Over Easy would be just your typical diner. It's the surprising flipside to an expected 1ish hour wait...and there will be a wait, especially on a weekend. I wanna take a minute to say this: don't come to Yelp to bitch about the wait, princess, because a) you can always get there early to skip the crowd, b) who else offers free, delicious Julius Meinl coffee outside for those waiting (especially gracious in the winter months), and c) once you're seated and your order placed, food takes roughly 5 minutes to arrive...remarkable, and I have no idea how they do it. So the wait? Worth it. Quit your whining. On to the food - okay, so it's not just the service. The food here is pretty damn incredible. It's simple, consistently good, beautifully presented. The machine running out back is just as efficient - food arrives quickly, and there's an unfussy perfection to it. These are serious comfort food breakfasts, perfectly portioned, and often with a Mexican twist (The Husband always orders a variation of the special Mexican-themed dish on Sundays, and more often than not he's grinning while eating). I always stick to my favourites: Bersten Brothers scramble (best and most savoury scrambled eggs, ever), Sweet n' Salty (for those pancakes-with-bacon mornings), and occasionally, Over Easy claim to fame, Sassy Eggs (a magical mountain of Mexican-themed breakfast with chorizo...and you can get VEGETARIAN chorizo, which is even tastier....mmm). The Husband also loves the corn cakes with red pepper sauce, and I am quite in love with their house potatoes (peeerrfection). Am sure the sweet stuff is also very good, but we're savoury breakfasters so can't help you there. Aside from weekend creativity, Over Easy is pretty straightfoward - it is refreshingly without breakfast pretension. The staff are actually lovely; professional, attentive, and accommodating. The food is, as said, consistently good. It's not the cheapest of breakfasts in the area - nor the most expensive - but it happens to be one of the best. A queue forms for a hotspot, then peters out. Over Easy's queue is an ongoing tradition, and there's very good reason for it.",0.994,0.794,0.159,0.047,0.5869061070755988

There is no real space in the front and people would hold the door open while putting their names in.   This year they installed one of those winter wind flaps around the door and it is much warmer as a result.   If you go to Over Easy, plan on a wait but it will be worth it.",0.9906,0.799,0.181,0.02,0.5058974358974359

These sweet words should make me feel all warm and fuzzy though unfortunately it was so chilly inside that I was forced to eat my entire meal wearing my down jacket. This is not an exaggeration, I also saw a few other people eating in their coats.  There is NO waiting room at Over Easy Cafe. Perhaps this would be acceptable if it never got below 65 degrees but unless I am mistaken we live in Chicago where for about half the year it is intolerable to be outside. Though I guess the free coffee they offered outside is a nice touch, if only it warmed your chilly toes.  The hostess was super cheery and took down our name and when we said we thought it was too chilly to wait outside she said we could wait inside but we had to go 'all the' way to the back, stressing all the way. So to the back we ventured, yeah it was not pleasant. Luckily there were chairs being stored back there but it is nothing more than a 3x3 ft hallway wedged between the back door, the bathrooms, and a bustling bus station. I was miserable 'waiting' when it was just me and my friend but then a whole family toting toddlers came back there and it was comical that Over Easy actually treated their customers like this!  Over Easy Cafe has a great menu, I had to narrow my choices down from about 10 things I wanted. I got a breakfast sandwich off the specials menu by recommendation of the server. It was delicious as was my friends Mexican omelet and the breakfast potatoes were surprisingly crispy and fabulous! Though we were really drooling over the Emily Pancakes that the people on both sides of us ordered. After our 30min wait I was glad to see the food came out about 5min after we ordered it.

2011-02-27,5.0,"I've heard nothing but good things about Over Easy and decided to give it a try for a Sunday brunch. Admittedly, I knew we had picked the single busiest time to go, but I wasn't expecting to wait an hour to be seated.  It gave us a chance to discover another little jewel right next door though, Dolce Casa Cafe. A big plus for Over Easy was the hostess coming over to the cafe when our table was ready. Talk about service! The space at Over Easy is very small so a group of 3 or 4 would have felt too crowded. And as you can expect, in a small space it gets a little noisy, but it wasn't anything that diminished the experience.  The waitstaff was very welcoming and seemed to handle the pressure of a busy service in stride. The menu had a good mix of sweet and savory options, and the specials change weekly. We ordered the Bernsten Brothers' Scramble and an egg topped enchilada dish (I don't remember the name) and loved them both. However, the French Toast at the table next to us looked simply AMAZING! and I'll probably be ordering that the next time because it looked so delicious. Despite the wait, I was very pleased and can't wait to return.",0.9931,0.751,0.207,0.043,0.49666666666666676
2011-02-25,3.0,"PROS: Food, Staff, Atmosphere CONS: Parking, Food & Coffee (for the past few times only) I was going to write a great review on over easy.  I have been going since they first opened and after the initial fire they had. So this review is going to be a bit tough for me.  Its a great little place in a great neighborhood. ' I have been kind of disappointed with them the last few times I have been going.  Everything started off fine, great service with a smile ..................That is when it stopped being great to just being good.   FIRST.....  The waitress we had left in the middle of my order (to do, oh who knows what) then did not come back until about 10 minutes later.  The coffee I had to get was from the bus boy after flagging him down and even then it tasted like dish water.... SECOND, after the order was taken and my plate was set in front of me, i was even more disappointed with the food.  ""How is this possible"" I said to myself.  I had ordered my usual ""Sassy Eggs"" and my friend had ordered one of the specials.   Well to say the least, quality control was not a standard in the kitchen that day.  My Chorizo was burnt, my eggs was not cooked they way I wanted them (Which b.t.w. has changed dramatically from being this beautiful huge portion to a decent small serving size) and the coffee was just ewe.   Granted, this could of been my order only and maybe I thought to blame it on the owner/chef not being there.  Nope, he came out soon after I had thought this to myself.  What a bummer...  I sampled my friends special and that was really good and so something was going right back there.  I just feel this place has gone down a bit in quality but not because they want it to be bad, just maybe the popularity has been a bit more than what they can handle. So, to say the least.  It is still one of my favorite places to go to, but I might have to give it some thought before making that decision now. PROS & CONS Even though it has been a downer the past few times I went, the place is still good and the only real issue is trying to find parking before a long line gets in front of you.  Thank goodness the cafe next door is open to keep you warm, especially on those cold winter days.",0.9891,0.829,0.133,0.038,0.4899698960043789

The boyfriend and I went for brunch on Sunday, which was way cold and way rainy, and we were pleasantly surprised by the free coffee carafe waiting for guests that were standing outside. Free coffee while I wait? Why thank you. It was only a 45 minute wait (for Sunday brunch!), and the hostess was nice enough to call our cell so we wouldn't have to wait outside the whole time.

2011-02-09,5.0,"My favorite brunch place in the country. When I lived in Chicago & my boyfriend and I went looking for an apartment on the North side, we literally chose the one we ended up living in for 3 years because it was around the corner from Over Easy. Seriously. A perfect and lovely place to meet a friend(s), have a coffee, and chat with the staff- or Chef Cignarale, who pretty much epitomizes Chicago, great cooking, & cuisine accessibility. I tend to be a woman of habit- I get the Sassy Eggs w/ veggie Chorizo (no pig for me) or the Damen Ave omelet. Whatever the fiercest sounding French toast is what I tend to order just to share with the table- gluttonous, I know, but whatevs. It's gonna be delicious! Sometimes, on a slammed frigid Sunday morning, I think the absolute BEST thing about Over Easy is how effectively they triage their incoming customers; endless hot Julius Meinl coffee outside, super attentive hostess, and she'll call me on my cell phone when my table is ready- leaving me able to chill at home or at the coffee shop next door. This may not be as important to some people, but I'm a brunchaholic, and have found myself saying dozens of time: ""why is this place so disorganized? Why are we all huddled in the front foyer like lemmings? Why can't they be as organized as OVER EASY IN CHICAGO?"" Oh Over Easy. Keep doin whatcha do.

It's a hard choice between this place and Tweet.  They have so many great menu options, and some really delicious Sunday Brunch specials. We've had just about everything and it was all good. Damen avenue omelette, smoked salmon scramble, sassy eggs, and one of my absolutel favorites - spicy tofu scramble.  For real, one of the best things on the menu is vegetarian :)  A few friends always get the pancakes and swear they are divine, I can never get away from their savory egg dishes so can't speak from experience. Great beverage options for breakfast too.  Love the juice mixes (the OJ freckled with strawberry is my favorite), and they have a nice selection of pots of tea as well.  They serve Julius Meinl coffee, and even have a nice big decanter of it outside for when you're stuck behind a huge line of smart brunchers like yourself who know it's worth the wait, and there will inevitably be a decent one too. Breakfast is not cheap, probably close to $16 per person when you add tax and tip, but it's a special treat and definitely worth the ocasional splurge.  Service is always friendly and attentive, but there is not exactly a ton of seating there either so they'd have no excuse to not come by once in a while :p  Parking in the area can be tough since it's chock full of condos.  But it is free, you just might have to park a block or two away.  they do not take reservations, and I want to stress if you're even remotely near a reasonable breakfast hour you'll probably have to wait, particularly on Sunday.  Just bribe a friend to get their early and put your name in and enjoy the free coffee, LOL.",0.9954,0.717,0.232,0.051,0.5872321428571428

The brunch options alone were hard to choose between, but we both settled on the eggs beny.  This was not your average brunch though, or eggs beny for that matter.  Placed on a moist but toasted english muffin, a generous dollop of mashed sweet potatoes spread on the muffin, some incredible chicken maple sausage covered with poached eggs and butter hollandaise on top.  It all worked together in a superb way.  The hubs quoted it best - ""its like a really really awesome McGriddle"".  And McGriddles are fairly not good.  It all just worked SO well, and snaps to the person who thought it up.  The rest of the menu was equally hard to decide between and with many choices, we will be back (a lot).   Prices range around $10 for breakfast, with the eggs beny at $13.  Worth it.  It was a good serving size, with some grilled up potatoes.  The server was friendly and our cups were full .  Not a thing to complain about, except that it was cold out and the door opening often didn't help keep where we sat warm.  BUT, that would hardly affect my review.  A great cozy and quaint place for some good brunch in Lincoln Square!",0.992,0.749,0.187,0.064,0.6002777777777778

The menu was full of interesting dishes such as the cannoli french toast (someone in our group got it and it was a big hit). I went with the Sassy Eggs...they were indeed sassy! The sassy eggs are two eggs (I got egg whites) served over chorizo-potato hash with cheddar cheese, red peppers, jalapenos, guacamole, sour cream, & ancho ketchup. Lots of chorizo comes with this dish so be prepared, lol. I ordered a side of smoked chicken sausage which was very good. Once we finished we sat around and gabbed quite a bit.

I won't give away what they say; you'll just have to check them out yourself. A word of advice: If you truly want to be seated as quick as possible, get here as early as possible. I suppose that would apply to any popular Chicagoland breakfast/brunch venue, but with a space as small as OE's and with food as yummy as theirs, the early bird really does get the worm.

It didn't take me long to decide what to eat. I ordered the brioche pumpkin french toast and a side of veggie sausage. Wow! It was served up fast and it looked just as great as it tasted. The veggie sausage was the ""skinless"" link style and was a bit on the dry side. What the heck though, it's veggie sausage and I always pour maple on sausage anyway.

Some might think they were plain but it was one of the rare times I was able to enjoy a potato's flavor without the noise of salt, pepper, ketchup, or other embellishments people love to mix in. As delicious as everything was, the corn cakes were my favorite. Shaped like pancakes but with the consistency closer to cornbread, it had pieces of corn and peppers, creating a sweet yet savory balance. Paired with the sauce, it added a creaminess and slight chipotle flavor that had me yabbering on and on ""omg this is so good.""  Brunch gems like this are hard to find.

Last Saturday I decided to take my daughter and her boyfriend to Over Easy.  I had been here a few times before and the food was different but good so I decided we should give it a shot.  The restaurant was crowded as usual.  We had a short wait and were seated without 1 of our guests  was finding parking.  The waitstaff and hostess were in such a hurry to get our order and to get us in and out I finally ordered for our other guest.  The food came out quickly and was not even served by our original waitress.  After we finished our meal it was like OK thanks do not let the door hit you on your way out.  But the real reason for this review is I had left the waitress over a 15% tip and her and another waitress were right next to my daughte talking about how they both got screwed on their tip money.  Come one really - if they are upset thats OK with me but I think that when the waitress does next to nothing 15% is more than sufficient and they certainly should bot be complaining about anything within earshot of the customers.  Even though the food is delicious there I will never go to that restaurant again and I will never recommend it either.,0.958,0.81,0.129,0.061,0.4472857142857143

2010-09-01,2.0,"I have to start by saying that I used to be a fan of this place. Both the food and the service are typically good, and in the past few months my husband and I have eaten there pretty regularly. However, a recent experience has changed my opinion and lost my business. Over Easy is a neighborhood cafe. Considering the neighborhood where it is located, that means that about 75% of their clientele is families, many of whom have young children. Given that fact, I was more than a little confused and frustrated when my husband was told during an early (8:30am) Friday breakfast visit that he could not bring our sleeping six-month-old son's stroller into the restaurant because ""the owner is not really crazy about strollers in the restaurant"". This was upsetting for several reasons. First of all, there was plenty of room. We do not have a particularly large or wide stroller- just your run of the mill one baby set up. There were several open two-top tables which could have accommodated the stroller while keeping it out of the way of other customers and staff. In addition, the restaurant wasn't particularly busy and it was early enough in the day to assume that he easily could have gotten in and out before it became so. I mean, how long does it take one man to eat breakfast? I can understand not wanting a room full of strollers during a busy brunch shift, or even during the height of a weekday breakfast or lunch rush.  But the place was half empty. And it was a weekday morning. The most frustrating part, though, was the attitude that was presented about the whole situation. The hostess he spoke with recognized him and clearly knew that he was a regular customer. Yet she still felt justified in (essentially) turning him away. In the past when we have eaten there, we have done so with the baby both in and out of the stroller, according to the specific time and circumstances. In this particular circumstance, all of the high-chairs were taken and my husband did not want to remove the baby from the stroller because he was sleeping. Given the fact that the restaurant was not busy and there were tables open, it was clearly possible to accommodate his needs without inconveniencing any other customers or staff. This, I feel, should be the goal of any business that caters to the public: keeping its customers (especially regular customers) happy as often as is reasonably possible. I'll add to that statement that both my husband and I worked in the restaurant industry for 20 years, from diners to fine dining; we know that the customer is not always right and that some requests (and some customers) are indeed UN-reasonable. But this was not the case. When my husband told the hostess that he would be leaving since he could not bring in the stroller, she seemed taken aback but made absolutely no offer to remedy the situation or keep him there. That's just bad business. Furthermore, when I myself called back later to complain to the manager, I was passed off to the same hostess, who insisted that her actions had been justified while offering no apology whatsoever. I know that Over Easy is a very popular local restaurant. And I'm sure that this rant will not put even the slightest dent in the crowd of fans who gather outside on the sidewalk every weekend to wait to eat there. But I for one will not be going back. Because I think it's sad when a local business that is supported by its community decides that it can afford to lose a local customer over an easy-fix situation. This tells me that for this restaurant, the crowd has become more important than the individuals who make it up.",0.0939,0.881,0.063,0.056,0.4514256074038683

2010-06-13,5.0,"My favorite breakfast place in Chicago. I often get the same egg dish - Nueva Mexicana Omelet. I have it made with egg whites. Other ingredients include corn, tomatoes, red onions, cilantro & goat cheese. It is topped with a delicious salsa verde & sour cream, served with red potato hash & toast (I recommend the sourdough). I like it very spicy, so I always add some hot sauce. It is always excellent  (or given, their decor, eggcellent -- sorry, couldn't resist).  But, other things on the menu are also delicious.  The pancakes fabulous! Even a simple fruit plate is beautifully presented. The staff is friendly, attentive, and professional. The hostess, Petra, is the most genuinely enthusiastic greeter I have ever seen and always makes me smile. Caution: Waits can be long. We try to get there before they open so that we don't have to wait very long. But, waits can be 15 to 20 minutes before 9:00 and 25 to 40 minutes after that -- or longer.

Instead I came away slightly disappointed but I would go back and try again because the menu seemed so interesting. The one big negative: our very unhappy server (not sure if this is her usual attitude or she was just having a bad morning). It seemed all the other servers had smiles and a friendly attitude, so here we just lucked out! Once seated there was definitely a sense of being rushed to get our order. I like promptness but I don't like getting a sour look because I'm not ready to order. Hey, I haven't been here before and I waited on the sidewalk for my turn at a table!! If you really want to move me along, find out whether I want savory or sweet and make a suggestion! My suggestion would be to add the brunch specials next to the menu in the window. While waiting I thought I had decided what I wanted to order but then discovered the brunch specials once we were seated. The area is small but the hostess was very organised and the available coffee outside made the wait ok. My husband ordered the Blueberry Crunch pancakes and thought they were just ok. I, on the other hand thought they were yummy...yes I stole some :)  He didn't think they were anything special and I liked them because they were simple and not overly sweet, so I guess its all a matter of taste preference. I ordered the Biloxie (sp?) Benedict from the special brunch menu. It was ok but not great. I always order my eggs hard and the sauce on the side. Definite plus for getting my order right (you'd be surprised at how many places can't manage that). The greens under the sausage patty was a nice touch, very tasty. Sausage patty was good and the potato side was hot (big thumbs up for that) but neither were anything special. I don't use a lot of sauce (which was just as well because I got the tinest amount on the side) and it was fairly nondiscript. It wasn't terrible but I wouldn't order it again.

This is not a place for anyone over 35.  There was definitely a twentysomethings vibe going on, and not just from the patrons. This seems like a nice option for young singles and couples, but it didn't seem fit for families or an older crowd.   I felt a little out of place.

I had the burger with a side of mac salad.  Good, but not earth-shattering.  I wouldn't be inclined to order it again unless I was REALLY in the mood for a burger, or if it were a couple of bucks less than the $9 I paid for it.

My party of four finally got a seat, but unfortunately it was by the door, where other people waiting didn't seem to realize how discourteous it is to crack open the door while they waited. Despite the bad beginning, Over Easy redeemed itself with the service and the food. I ordered the Nuevo Mexicano omelet. Holy crap, it was so good. Food came out pretty quickly too and the waitress was great. Everyone at my table loved their food. That's not rhetoric. Everyone in my 4-person party said their dishes were super, including one of us who had the highly touted sassy eggs. Decor was cute, vibe was fun.

The portion was large enough, and thankfully, they did have Cholula on the table...not sure eggs would be the same without Cholula.

The other gals had the veggie burger (average) and the muffaletta (which did look pretty darn tasty).  Service was a bit spotty for us. Friend S, who happened to be undercaffeinated that day, had to flag down the severs to refill the coffees.

The second time around, I went with the above mentioned Yelper. We really did not have to wait this time around which was nice, although we may have gone on a weekday now that I think about it.

On the plus side, the wait was very short at 1030 on a Saturday morning (about 10 minutes). Probably because the only place to wait is outside and it was freezing! The restaurant is really cute, all decked out in eggs. Between the name and the decor, I was ready for some delicious eggs. Imagine my surprise when I opened up the menu and found more pancake/French toast choices than egg dishes! Eventually I found the specials list, and there were more egg options there, but I still thought this was really weird. I ended up ordering a special - the egg sandwich. I was really unimpressed. I love a good egg sandwich (I dream about the one at M. Henry) but this was just not that good. The bread was dry and unflavorful. The eggs were scrambled up with bacon, onions, etc. They were okay, but nothing I couldn't make at home. Evenutally I ditched the bread and just ate the eggs inside. Also, the menu said I would get ""potato hash"" as a side. But it's not hash at all. It's just red potatoes that are also just okay. My friend didn't seem blown away by her pancakes either.  Since I'm a decaf drinker, I have to review the coffee, and the decaf was nothing to write home (or yelp) about. My friend (who also ordered decaf) didn't even drink hers. Plus, they kept forgetting that I had decaf and trying to refill my cup with regular. A big no no in my book. All in all, the theme of the meal was ""it's okay.""

I don't know if I made the *right* choice, but it was a darn *good* choice.  Utterly delicious.  I liked the simple potatoes too, although the menu described them as ""red potato hash"" when in fact they were just potatoes.  And I swiped a few bites of my lovely breakfast companion's delightful strawberry/marscapone french toast.

My girlfriend, well she absolutely loves potatoes and bread (toast), especially sourdough. The main dishes we had were SO good she dropped the toast and the roasted potatoes like a bad habit.  We decided to do sweet and savory, so she ordered a sun dried tomato and pesto omelet, and I got the baked apple pancakes. The omelet was tasty, no doubt. But the star was the apple pancakes. The first thing I noticed when they came out was the sheer size. They were huge. Then the smell hits. A big waft of apple and cinnamon takes a hold of you and you lose track of everything else going on. They have a cinnamon glaze of some sort, and when the flavored butter melts all over it, it's almost like the best cinnamon bun you've ever had. Add in the apple slices that are baked right on top, and it's seriously so amazing. The only drawback I could find about the place is the side of bacon we ordered was only 3 average sized slices, and at a cost of $3.50 it seemed like a bit much. But that is probably my only complaint. You must make your way up to Lincoln Square and try Over Easy if you love breakfast.",0.99,0.743,0.197,0.06,0.6342120181405896

I would've preferred a table but it wasn't a deal breaker for me.  Also, the hostess was just so sweet about it that I couldn't say no. Service is fast! Everything came out in less than 10 mins.  I ordered the smoked salmon omelette.  It was good but I wish the potatoes on the side had more flavor.  Next time, I think I'll try the sassy eggs that everyone seems to rave about. As busy as the place was, I never felt rushed.  I'd definitely go back for seconds.",0.9863,0.773,0.205,0.022,0.4796875

So a Friday morning came so I went. I ordered a great mexican omelet (forgot the name). It was delicious. It came with a side of red potatoes. I will say it was plenty of food, but I somewhat wish there was more potatoes on the side as that side of the plate looked somewhat bare. The green salsa on the omelet was awesome, and the presentation was many notches above what you would expect from a breakfast joint. Also, the freshness of the ingredients you could taste. Even the prices weren't that bad... I would say maybe a dollar or so more than you would pay at a Golden Nugget. Check this place out if you have a free week day morning. We waited 15 minutes. I would say though it's probably not worth it on a Saturday/Sunday morning with really long waits.",0.9788,0.792,0.162,0.046,0.4898148148148148

Over Easy Cafe won us over when the hostess told us that the wait might be 45 minutes to an hour, but that there was free coffee outside for us. While it might have been more exciting if they were able to keep up with the demand for it and actually have some when we got there, we were still quite pleased when we finally got some halfway through our wait.  We sat at the bar and got to watch all the serving action - and got plenty of attention from everyone who walked by, not just our server. After the coffee outside, my friend and I split a pot of tea and even got hot water refills, and were surprised to pay for just ""one tea."" I got the weekly special mexican omelet, with corn, tomatoes, goat cheese, and a salsa and sour cream drizzle, which was really fantastic - the combination of eggs and corn worked well and the salsa was very good. My only complaint was that the potatoes looked sad on the large plate; the serving size was probably just fine, but the way the plating was done made them look sparse and lonely. They were also just run of the mill, slightly fried red potatoes - nowhere near good enough to match with the omelet.  The unfortunate thing is that it seems like the only way to avoid the lines is to come on a weekday, but the special brunch menu is only offered on Sundays. The regular menu looks good, too, but it seems like they save the really special dishes for brunch . . . .",0.9944,0.736,0.203,0.062,0.5639998036151882

I love that:  *It is tucked away in a residential area of Lincoln Square that you probably would drive right by without noticing.  *The hostess who welcomed us and got our name was the friendliest person I've ever met, the kind of person who you want to give a hug to and tell them your life story. And as we were exiting after our meal, she also stopped and thanked us for coming in and wished us a very good day.  *As I waited 30 minutes for a table, I got to sip on coffee and sit in the sun surrounded by my fellow hungry peers.  *The decor of the restaurant, simple with its photographs of vibrant colored food and random over-sized egg beads that hang on the walls.  *Our southern waitress that called me ""dear"", ""honey"", and ""sweetie"". Often I find that to be condescending coming from someone my age, but she was nothing but endearing. She was lovely, made clever remarks, got us our food quickly, checked on us, and when she brought us the check she made sure to emphasize, ""Here's the check, but there is NO hurry.""  *The food was incredible. I got the Sunrise Omelet and it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The pesto gave it flavor, the cheese made it rich, and the sun dried tomatoes made it fresh. My friend got the Blueberry Crunch Pancakes that were scrumptious and mess-free.  I honestly can't wait to come back here. I want to order almost everything on the menu, and will probably make that my mission over the next few months.

My wife ordere eggs with salmon which came out in a pool of water. My wife tried to send the dish back for being too runny, but the waitress insisted that the liquid was released by the salmon during cooking. That may have been so, but it did not detract from the overall grossness of the presentation. To sum up, if I'm paying twelve dollars for eggs and potatoes, I better be blown away.

Sometimes it's worth it, and every time I return, it becomes a special occasion. Of course there have been times when the meal does not justify the travel time. This is one of those times.  I had high hopes for Over Easy Cafe after seeing it on Check Please. One guy said it changed his mind about breakfast forever! As a person who loves eggs any ol' time, I was looking forward to something pretty fantastic.  Silly me for thinking that I'm the only lazy girl in Chicago. I arrived at 12:45 on Saturday, thinking that I could just breeze in after all the early birds had left. We were greeted with a 30 minute wait and a fresh pot of Julius Meinl. At least it was a nice day!  Once we were finally seated, the service was prompt, efficient, helpful and friendly. The breakfast/brunch menu was quite promising. An interesting mix of sweet and savory plates, many that sounded both unique and delicious. I liked the Latin influence in many of the egg dishes. I enjoy french toast or pancakes every now and then, but most of the sweet dishes sounded more like dessert than breakfast! I wish they had a few options that combined sweet and savory flavors.  I think the star of the show is the Sassy Eggs, they seem to be the most popular. I let Mr. Man order that, since the blackberry & cream french toast he had his heart set on wasn't available on Saturday. I asked our waitress for a reco, and she pointed out El Gordito's Corn Cakes, which had already caught my eye. The Sassy Eggs were not bad. Despite all the different flavors going on in the dish, I still found the potatoes a little off. Maybe a bit under-seasoned? And a little undercooked? I was expecting yummy crispy potatoes, rather than big hunks of potato. The corn cakes were also not what I was expecting. They were like pancakes with corn in them. I had been picturing something thicker and denser. They were served with syrup on the side, but I really don't think they need it! Just enough sweetness from the corn, and a deceptive amount of spice! After a few bites I really started to feel the burn of the chiles in the corn cakes! The eggs and grilled ham were also good, but nothing extraordinary.  Over Easy Cafe does get a few things right. Good coffee (a brunch MUST) and a unique menu.

Twice I went on my own so I could be sure to get in, as they have a bar where singletons can sit and have intimate moments with their delightful minx of a menu.  Service: tops! Everyone who works there is busting their tail to keep you hydrated and the food comes out lickety-split. I developed a total girl-crush on one lass with a Southern accent who also speaks Spanish. The accent may be played up for us Yankees, but whatever, it works. I met the owner on my last trip. I've seen other reviews that comment on his mannerism with the staff, but in context, I could see he was trying to run a tight ship. The staff seemed to take it all in style, ""tranquilo"" as one guy advised another.  Food: As I wrote on another site (that I've since thrown over for Yelp!): brioche french toast was so amazing i didn't bother with syrup. The combo of blackberries, orange cream, blood OJ reduction, and whipped cream was such a delicate ecosystem I didn't want to upset it with syrup. Nor did I want to waste time getting it all down my gullet! The Strawberry Sublime French toast lived up to it's name"": brioche french toast with strawberry compote, marscapone cheese, & dusted with powdered sugar. I thought the mascapone would be too much, but it was all perfectly balanced. I had the Damen omlette (eggs, sauteed portobellos, spinach & goat cheese, served with red potato hash & toast) and, while it was tasty, it didn't wow me. The hash at Tre Kronor is better.  My last meal for this visit was the Rio Grande Breakfast Sandwich. It included eggs scrambled with chorizo, red onion, tomatoes, & cilantro, topped with pepper jack cheese & served on a toasted telera with red potato hash. I don't think I've ever had telera bread and didn't need to know it exists because it's now on my list of must-haves.

It's not their fault that they won't let you stand inside and hover over those who got there first. If they let everyone wait inside they would be quick to get a occupancy violation.... it only takes a few of those to tax a business into closure.  Further if you are inside and sit at your table 30 minutes after you are done eating while people are waiting outside, you are a jerk.

2009-07-13,5.0,"Over Easy Café Review Let me start with a little story about how my friends and I discover this wonderful place before I give my review. Last year my friends and I are were training for the 2008 Chicago marathon with CARA (Chicago Area Running Association), so every Saturday morning we were out on Montrose running our butts off doing our long mile run. After a few weeks of doing this we all decided that we should treat ourselves to breakfast at the end of our runs, as a way of celebrating and saying  ""yeeah, you just ran 12 miles and your not dead, way to go."" At that time I had on been living up on the north side for about two years so I was still getting familiar with Rogers Park and the surrounding neighborhood and the only two places that I knew to get breakfast was the Golden Nugget and Devon Diner. One of the guys in our running group suggested that we go to this place called the Over Easy Cafe, he raved about how good the food was and how we would not be disappointed. So we all caravan it to over the ""OEC"" to get our celebratory after-run breakfast on and I have to say the breakfast dishes here are off the chart delicious, Sassy Eggs nuff said. It's been a year and a half since the first time my friends and I came here and we've tried other breakfast spots some good and some bad but the Over Easy Café has never been a disappointment. From the food to the services the Over Easy Café will always be at the very top of our list.  Ok now on to the review if you haven't already guess from the story how I'm going to rate this place: Location: I think location is perfect because it's not place in a high shopping area meaning the street traffic is light, which is really important for when there is a line outside. Service: The service here are friendliest group of people I have ever meet, especially for a breakfast service. It's not like their trying to be your friend because they want a tip from you, from the servers to the busboy everyone really seem appreciative that your there. Some Saturday there will be a line outside but I have never felt that I was being rush out of the place by the staff to sit the next customer down. The service also goes one step above most places by offering you free coffee if you happen to be waiting outside in a line. Atmosphere: From my reviews a year ago I like places that have a low-key atmosphere to them and Over Easy Café fit that same bill. The atmosphere here is great because the service here seem to have everything under control, their not all running around like chicken with the heads cut off or screaming at each other because they can't handle the morning breakfast rush. Also what adds to the wonderful atmosphere is the size of the OEC. You don't feel like your sitting on top person right next to you, which is great for me because along with enjoy my food I also like having my own personal space to enjoy it in. All the tables are all perfectly space with enough room where you and the wait staff can move freely around each other. The only suggest I would make to the owner is if he could possibly buy the building next to him which looks empty and knock the wall down and expand the dining area, but they seem to be doing just fine as is. Food: Ok the food here gets 5 stars from me just for the Sassy Eggs alone, I mean how could you go back to a regular Denver omelette once you've had scrambled eggs with chorizo, potato hash, red peppers, jalapenos, guacamole, sour cream, & ancho ketchup. I've only had the Sassy eggs here because 1. I'm a creature of habit, 2. Sassy Eggs never fails to satisfy and 3. I can only take to being addict to one dish at a time, two or more might get ugly. I'm a huge fan of cooking shows, Top Chef, Hells Kitchen, Etc, and one thing about those shows mention is along with making great food is you must present it on the plate just as well. The chef (Chef Jon) must have gotten an A+ in presentation class because every dish that I've seen served here are presented beautifully, and even your going to destroy it the moment its hit the table it's a lot better then looking at something that been slap on a plate and place in front of you with no care or attention (my God, I think I just became a food snob).   Overall: This is definitely a place you want to try if you looking for a place to have a great breakfast experience, try to get there early to avoid the line, which I think starts to form around 9:30, but if you have to wait at least there always free coffee for you to enjoy.",0.9992,0.768,0.186,0.046,0.5344709566338779

Sweet: Apple upside down pancake Okay, I forget if that's what it's actually called, but it's a HUGE pancake cooked in a skillet with the bottom-now-top covered in cinnamon sugar caramelized apples. Definitely not something you can eat by yourself, or if you can, man am I impressed. Personally I like to order one of each and share with someone else, because on its own, the apple pancake is a bit much, but with half of that and half a grilled cheese, I am perfectly satisfied.",0.9909,0.712,0.279,0.009,0.4603864734299516

2009-07-06,5.0,"PREFACE: An excellent meal deserves a review that gives the establishment its due.  Enjoy. INTRODUCTION: Ever since the time I was 12 or so, I remember that to me (and as far as I know, to a significant amount of the population, as I always saw many people at these brunches), ""Brunch"" meant that you went to a buffet where you could serve yourself gigantic amounts of dishes that were both traditionally eaten at breakfast such as scrambled eggs and dishes that were traditionally eaten at lunch (such as pasta or tuna salad).  Sometimes, there were also chefs (or possibly just waiters dressed up in a white coat and hat that sat behind certain parts of the buffet and made you an omelet or perhaps cut you a piece of prime rib).  Being 12, a fat kid, and having little idea what the words 'serving size' referred to, I wholeheartedly embraced the notion i understood as brunch, frequently having 3 plates of food: 1 for breakfast items, 1 for lunch items, and 1 for dessert items. After an approximate 10 year hiatus (HS, College), I found that the meaning of the word had completely changed from under me when I wasn't looking:  It now meant that you had 1 dish, not a buffet, and that this dish was only breakfast food, not lunch.  However, something else had changed too...the quality was significantly better!  And of course, instead of being taken to brunch by my parents, i was going of my own free will with good friends. I discovered the new meaning of the word ""Brunch"" while living in New York City, when many Saturday and Sunday mornings I would find myself at a table of one of many great brunch places: French Roast, Good Enough to Eat, Cafeteria, Sarabeths, The Popover Cafe, and others.  Needles to say, these excellent establishments have given me the opportunity to build high expectations over the past few years.  This weekend was my first real foray into brunch here in Chicago, with brunches first at Over Easy on Saturday and Lula Cafe (review coming forthwith) on Sunday.  REVIEW: The bottom line is that my NY expectations were BLOWN AWAY today at Over Easy.  While there are admittedly probably other great brunch places in Chicago of which I don't know, Over Easy not only hangs with the best New York had to offer, but in many ways puts a Chicago stamp (bigger portions, friendlier service) on the newly quintissential brunch experience, improving it to a level above any of the aforementioned NY restaurants. Now, let me say here before we go any further that if you go when i did (prime brunch time on the weekend) you're probably going to experience a similar wait time: 1/2 an hour before you get to sit down. But you know what? It was totally worth it and also not really a problem!. You know why? because they have coffee for everyone waiting outside!  You don't have to ask for it, it's just there! you can just serve yourself a little cup...and then go back for a 2nd one! Upon entering, (and even outside) the atmosphere was lively and friendly, and the service almost *too* good:  a busboy came by and filled up my water when it was 11/12 full, 3 different servers came by and asked if we had a drink order all within 2 minutes of sitting down. Food wise, I had one of the specials: the ""All American Breakfast Sandwich"" and it lived up to it's name.  When it arrived, I didn't think i was gonna be full when I finished. I was wrong. Also, upon slightly more careful inspection, I was shocked to see how fluffy my eggs were! I still am not sure how they accomplished it, or how many eggs they had to use for my sandwich. The eggs were topped off with a flavorful slice of cheddar cheese.  Every bite was a perfect blend of egg, cheese, the various perfectly cooked vegetables (red onion, green pepper?, parsley?) that had been expertly diced and mixed into the eggs, and the soft (kaiser?) roll on which it was served. The flavor just popped, then mellowed, then built upon itself. Mine was also not the only stunning dish as my friends ordered the Sassy Eggs (which was of such a stunning presentation, it must be seen to be believed - will definitely be a future order) and a couple omelets that were both tasty and inventive: A pesto omelet, and a cilantro one.  No taste disappointed. Before I knew it, I had finished my meal and brunch had turned into a wonderful memory.  It is simply easy to say that brunch at Over Easy goes over real easy and will not be easily forgotten.",0.9975,0.84,0.128,0.031,0.55625452778514

I had to come on a Friday morning, but it was worth it. I had two, out of town guests and we still had a 15 minute wait at 11am on a Friday. Totally worth it. The place is adorable and the service matched the decor. Sunny, cute and cheerful all over the place. We had SUCH a hard time deciding what to order since everything looked so damn good. Seriously, I was in pain with indecision and had to ask for reco's from our server to finally make a choice.  My companions had coffee which I tasted and was delicious (also served in the cutest little mugs; which didn't bother me because they were so attentive with refills) and I had earl gray tea which was high quality loose leaf and came in a pretty substantial pot. I got 3 cups out of it! I had the Mexicana omlette which was awesome, but after tasting the sassy eggs and banana french toast off my friends' plates, I was jealous. Everything was extremely fresh and flavorful.  I'm already counting on going back and will wait with the masses for another chance at those sassy eggs.",0.9918,0.67,0.239,0.092,0.5951762820512821

Sure, the price might be more for brunch (In Chicago) but on the whole the quality and freshness of ingredients more than make up for it. Go anywhere in this city on a Saturday or Sunday and you have to wait. The true joy of Over Easy is too walk in at 2:00 pm (ish) on a Wednesday and order whatever you want. I guarantee you will not be disappointed. Also, it's BYOB (not advertised!) and you can get anything to go if you just tell the hostess. Not a bad idea, you will be out of there in 10 mins with Sassy Eggs to enjoy at home.

Because he loudly explained this to the whole restaurant and then said that no one else would get their food until he ""made her happy."" The girl was CRYING into her napkin! When he promptly left to enter the kitchen and make her something new, the entire (full) restaurant was silent and couldn't believe what had just happened. He came back about 5 minutes later with, sure enough, a new dish. I don't think she even took a bite. I'm surprised her whole family didn't curse him out and leave, quite honestly.

2009-06-09,5.0,"I've now been to Over Easy plenty of times and it is really as good as it gets.  Sure, it's a particular style, a little on the richer side of things, but who doesn't like an amazingly presented, hearty breakfast?  Apparently TimeOut Chicago, which put Over Easy at the bottom of its favorite brunch spot list, calling it ""too sweet.""  Of course, they must have had one of their French toast plates or the upside down pancake, which are more like desserts, but seriously, what food critic goes to a place called Over Easy and doesn't order their signature Sassy Eggs to gauge the overall quality?  Further proof that TimeOut Chicago is only good for listings.  Their movie reviews tend to suck too. Anyway, moving on from my obvious unhealthy obsession with hating on TimeOut's critics, Over Easy really is the bomb, but I also want to address another issue-- THE WAIT!  Since this place is very small, and since it is very good, there will always be a wait on weekends.  This is a pretty natural result.  So to all the people on here who downgraded the place for having to wait an hour to sit down, look yourself in the mirror and ask if you need to lay off the pipe.  It's a busy, popular restaurant with limited seating, and you're just a customer, not the center of the universe.  If you don't want to wait, you'll usually be seated right away on weekdays.  Check it out then.  The food is great either way. Finally, I'm not sure where else to address this, or if it is within Yelp's rules and guidelines to call someone else's review out, but I think the reviewer who gave this place one star because they camped out for half an hour after their meal was over and were asked to leave is another crack smoker who needs to look himself in the mirror and ask, ""Am I really only a human being?  Am I not the center of the universe?""  Look, I assume it was on a weekend when this happened, or there wouldn't have been an issue.  He makes a big deal about some out-of-town guest that he wanted to spend time talking with.  Hell, they even let you sit for a whole half an hour past your meal.  Most places would kick you out faster than that if there was an hour wait of people outside in the cold.  Personally, I think it's rude to camp out like that when you know a place is extremely busy.  They have to make a living too, and don't give me this whole ""we paid $45 for three people nonsense.""  You think that's expensive?  Give me a break.  Besides, you're paying for the food, and the time it takes you to eat it, nothing more.  You weren't paying to sit in the restaurant until it closes, especially with people waiting outside. Okay, needless to say, I love this place, and anyone who trashes it for self-centered, picky, or whiny reasons deserves to be ridiculed to the full extent of the law. The coffee is superb as well.  :-)",0.9827,0.783,0.131,0.086,0.5360785844392403
2009-06-09,5.0,"I will start by saying that this is my favorite place to have breakfast or brunch. I always take guests here when they are in town, and they are ALWAYS blown away by how amazing the food is and the high quality of it. I have been to Over Easy roughly 20 times. That's not exaggerating, I'm serious. I live 2 blocks from this place, so besides taking visitors here, I order pick up very frequently.  This restaurant is small, and will most definitely have a wait on Saturday and Sunday of at least 20 minutes. The nice thing is that there is some coffee outside for you to sip on while you're waiting for your table. You will, though, be waiting outside. So plan accordingly with the weather.  If you're a first timer, don't be shy, go all out and try something that you've never seen or heard of before (which will apply to most of the items on the menu). My room mate and I like to split to dishes when we go. We do this because the sweet dishes and very sweet, and the salty very salty. Splitting dishes with your party or date is the way to go because then you are able to get the best of both worlds. All the dishes I have had are as follows:  1. Sassy Eggs. This is my favorite dish. Potatoes, hash, two eggs cooked to order with a big slice of cheddar melted over the top of them and a scoop of guacamole. If you're a salty eater, order this. You will not be let down. I like to get the eggs over medium so that I can mix in the yolk with the potatoes and hash. It is SO good.  2. Banana Spiked French Toast. Almost like candy, but it's not. I can only eat half at a time because it is so rich. Two slices of french toast with some banana's and creme sandwiched in between. Drizzled with Caramel and sprinkled with crushed pecans and powdered sugar.. Absolutely delicious.  3. Upside Down Apple Pancake. This takes about 25 minutes to cook. It is essentially a giant apple fritter, but more pancake-y than doughnut-y if that makes sense... it is delicious. VERY sweet though, I'd split it with someone.  4. Emily's Dream Pancakes. Served with a mango butter. If you like fruit with your pancakes, you'll love these.  5. Strawberry Sublime. Very rich, and tasteful. It'll make your taste buds dance.  6. Sunrise Omelet. This is probably my least favorite item on the menu, but it is none the less very delicious. Because their ingredients are so fresh, the omelet has a lot of flavor.  7. Smoked Salmon Scramble. If you like Salmon you'll love this. Perfect combination of herbs, fish and eggs that will make your tummy very happy. If you're a first timer, you should go on a weekday. That way your first experience won't involve a 45 minute wait, or a possible mix up on the list that makes your wait an hour and a half. Keep in mind though, they're closed on Monday's.",0.9985,0.803,0.188,0.009,0.5526868686868689

You can't go wrong. I will DEFINITELY be back. I also had the blueberry crisp/crunch pancakes. They were perfect. They had a special butter that went on top, and granola inside, so it had a little bit of a crunch to it. Parking was super-easy - I got a spot right in front. Prices were a little higher than other breakfast places ($10 for the Sassy Eggs and $10 for the Pancakes), but they deserve every penny.

Even if the place is packed food comes quick and with a smile!  When I said little, I do mean little, but that just adds to the local feel and charm! Hint about going: On the weekend, wait until the prime breakfast hours have past and brunch is almost lunch and you most likely won't have to wait.

If you are a fan of very tart key lime, the french toast isn't for you.  It was great for my tastebuds.  Not overly sweet or tart, and the fresh blueberries complemented it well.  No leftovers again!   Over easy, is easy going as it gets.  Has a laid back attitude but the customer service didn't suffer at all.  Brunchin' in chicago has only gotten better and better!",0.9934,0.72,0.245,0.036,0.6013640873015873

Of course, I am also looking for a place that will have lots of sweet & savory options when it comes to breakfast fare--I kind of want the menu to wow me. This one unfortunately doesn't--do not get me wrong, they serve good food, but it is a tad overpriced for what you get.  That being said, Over Easy is a fairly decent option although, I cannot say it is anything super special. It is good and you will get good food, but I have to say it was a wee bit of a let down from the last time I went. I met up with a girlfriend of mine last Friday morning for some catch up time & good eats.  As I entered I was sincerely welcomed and seated right away--so far so good. I have to admit, I was impressed with how many people were there for 9:30 on a weekday. My friend was running a bit late, but no matter because as if out of nowhere, coffee appeared on the table (ah heavenly coffee)--Julius Meinl coffee is served here--woot woot!!  We both ordered sweet dishes, she got the strawberry stuffed french toast, and I ordered the blueberry pancake special. Hers looked beautiful on the plate and mine just okay. They do like to make a splash with presentation. Both very good, however, I feel that they portions sizes are a tad on the small size for the price they charge.  One complaint I do have however & it kind of marred the experience, is that they are overly doting on their customers. Every 5 minutes someone was asking us how we were doing & that can get a bit old after the 1st 3 times. I can understand if they were jam-packed and needed us to hurry up--but they were not.

2009-04-06,3.0,"My husband and I refer to Over Easy as ""Over Priced,"" with a teensy pinch of affection and a dusting of bitterness. It's a ""special occasion"" breakfast joint we venture to rarely, typically when flush with paychecks. I give a mere three stars because, in this economy, it's as painful as the undercooked-egg shitz to drop $28 on two plates of breakfast food and two coffees. OK, fine, and a side of bacon. But seriously, two bucks for a cup of coffee? Julius Meinl coffee is served here, and it's a little strong for my taste. I admit ""Over Priced"" is beloved by the neighborhood, and its designer breakfast food rises far, far above the standard diner fare in the immediate area. If you can afford the latest $600 baby stroller, you can afford to eat here every weekend and ""be seen"" amongst toddler wielders. Do avoid the French toast. Very meh. Frazzled eggs does miracles to bologna. Lovely. Brightly flavored sandwiches with a charming macaroni salad are worth a try. Also, don't take your visiting parents here if your dad hangs out at the American Legion. Too hip. The only suitable thing on the menu for him will be the Retro Omelet. And he won't like it.

Once you get in the staff is very efficient.  They will ask you to leave if you linger after your meal on a Saturday or Sunday during the rush period.  They're friendly and very good at their jobs, but they also see the crowd waiting outside. As long as you can deal with these things, you can go in and have the best breakfast in Chicago.  The banana spiked french toast is creamy, fruity, sweet, and rich all at once.  The specials are always creative and worth checking out.  If you're like me and need a little soda in the morning they serve their Coke in bottles, always something that makes me happy. I would only add one caveat.  The one time we went and ordered lunch, we were not as impressed.  The food was decent, but nothing spectacular.  Stick to the breakfast foods on the menu and this is a five star place.",0.983,0.8,0.156,0.044,0.5557407407407408

2009-03-14,1.0,"Let me start by saying that this review has nothing to do with the quality of the food.  For those unconcerned by my tale of unthinkable ""customer service,"" you'll love the food here nonetheless.  I ordered the Sassy Eggs, and as most of the reviews here illustrate, they're pretty amazing. That said, I've never in my life had a more awful customer service experience.  I dined at Over Easy with my fiance and our mutual friend from out-of-town, whom we haven't seen in over a year.  So naturally when breakfast was over, we wanted to sit and chat.  Unfortunately, the Over Easy folks didn't love that idea.   Thirty minutes after our meal (for which we paid over $45 for three people), we were asked to leave.  Not because we were rude.  Not because we were too loud.  But so they could increase turnover.  The hostess explained that another family waiting outside was cold (mind you it was a balmy 45 degrees in Chicago), so the hostess requested that we could leave so those waiting outside could sit down.  Are you kidding me???  Did I rent my table for an hour only to be promptly kicked off when the timer runs out?  Is it my fault that instead of allowing your customers to wait inside for a table, you require everyone and anyone to wait outside the shop? And here's the kicker -- I politely explained that we were with an out-of-town guest, and we'd really love to catch up.  The hostess then responded,  ""There's a coffee shop across the street.  You guys can chat there.""  Wow.  Here's an idea -- tell the people waiting outside to go to the coffee shop to warm up.  The people who HAVEN'T paid yet.  And let the paying customers enjoy their meal.  Or maybe invite the poor, frigid customer inside as a kind gesture, instead of forcing them to wait outside.  No, that would make too much sense. I loved the food here, but unfortunately, you'll never find me at Over Easy again.  My experience defied all notions of customer service.",0.9577,0.846,0.104,0.05,0.6408496732026144

There were 3 of us, so it took us a long time to get a table. Two tops were being sat faster because of the LINGERERS!! Okay people, this is a small restaurant and a lot of people wait outside, sometimes in the cold and rain, for a table here, so this is clearly not a restaurant for lingering and chatting it up after you are all done with your meal and paid up!

2009-03-02,4.0,"I decided to try this place out after seeing it reviewed on Check, Please! and noticing how there tends to be a line out of the door to get in. Luckily, either it was a really cold day and people were too lazy to attempt brunch, or the hype died down, because I didn't have to wait for too long to get in. So why is it usually so difficult to get in? Because the food is great and the place is SMALL. My friends and I had to wait for 15 minutes in the back, by the kitchen and bathrooms, before they could seat us. But it was well worth the wait. We each tried different dishes and sampled each others. The dishes were, to the best of my recollection, as follows: - Smoked Salmon Scramble (ordered with an extra short stack of pancakes);  - Ham and eggs basted with a special mustard sauce;  - Damen omelet (with spinach, mushroom and goat cheese); and  - Blueberry granola pancakes with candied pecans. I also ordered the freckled OJ (strawberry orange juice).  The freckled OJ was good, but I don't think I would order it again because the glass was pretty small and it cost $4. But you should order it for the experience. Each of us really liked our food and I would say that my favorite was the Smoked Salmon Scramble, which I had ordered for myself, although I'm partial to smoked salmon. I also liked the mustard, egg and ham combination my friend ordered, with the mustard being a nice compliment to the protein. The granola blueberry pancakes had a nice texture that made you think you were eating healthy (despite all the butter and syrup we drizzled over them). The Damen omelet is a safe choice for anyone not willing to try out the risky, TexMex influenced menu that involves ingredients such as red pepper sauce and jalapenos. Overall, I plan to go back again, especially because I want to try their hoisin turkey burger. Mmm, turkey burgers!

2009-01-24,4.0,"I'm a little torn between 3 and 4 stars here, but I'll give Over Easy the benefit of the doubt. Met a friend here early this afternoon for a little lunch.  The place was cute, intimate, and very busy, but we ended up waiting only about 15 minutes.  The hostess and our server were very charming and polite, and more than willing to answer any questions we had.  I would say we definitely had 5 star service. First, I ordered tea.  Rooibos orange, and it was fantastic.  A complaint--the tea pot they served it in was adorable, but not the easiest to pour from.  Both my friend and I ended up with tea all over the table even before we ordered.  Our server then came over to tell us that this is a common problem, which made me feel slightly less like I ride the short bus, but would have been nice to know BEFORE I tried to pour my first cup. Perusing the menu, many items looked delicious, but ended up having something that I don't/can't eat (red meat, fish, pork), so I had very limited options.  Making things even more complicated--I don't eat onions or mushrooms, and the only veggie-friendly options that were not sweet contained one or both of these.  The pancakes and french toast all sounded amazing, but it was just a tad too early in the day to go into a diabetic coma, so I decided to pass (though the blueberry crunch pancakes and banana-spiked french toast were tempting).  So, limited menu items for me to eat without consuming 8 cups of sugar= 3 star menu. On our server's 3rd visit, we were finally able to settle on things we wanted to order.  I got the Sassy Eggs, but substituted vegetarian chorizo for the real thing, with multigrain toast.  The dish was very good, but the chorizo was a little sweet for my taste.  My friend very much enjoyed her omlette.  4-star food.

2009-01-14,4.0,"From reading the reviews, I found it helpful to visit during a Friday morning around lunch time. I was off from work and decided lets try this place out. According to many yelpers trying to go there for breakfast during the weekends is like having a very bad nightmare, in addition to waiting for up two hours to get a seat. The Place. The place is very big, and therefore probably would not hold a lot of patrons during very busy weekends, hence the wait times. The décor is slightly newer, very clean and friendly they do have a small counter with seating for up to 5 individuals. There are store front windows that open out to the street and provide adequate lighting. The food. I visited there withy my fiancée, she had the French toast, she wanted the upside down pancakes and was told it would take 25 minutes to bake,  and so she opted for French toast instead. I had the sassy eggs, which was great. The sassy eggs came with home fries, ground meat, and covered with two eggs over medium with Guacamole. It's very difficult to make breakfast food unique; however this place has found a way to do it. I am definitely a fan of this place, and still need to try a couple of more meals before I can give it a five start.. The Service. The food was extremely fast, we had our meal within 10 minutes of placing the order, which was record time for us, granted it was about 40% full the time we visited. The waitress, who was our server, was very friendly and welcoming.  We will continue to stop by this nice little place again, just not during Sunday and Saturday breakfast rush hour.",0.9724,0.861,0.111,0.029,0.5232850241545893
2009-01-14,5.0,"The so called ""Check Please Syndrome,"" can be an interesting thing for a restaurant. It can literally hype the hell out of a place, only leaving something to be desired. Not with Over Easy. On my first visit this past weekend, they lived up to the hype and then some.  My lady-friend and myself are early risers (madrugadors), so we were at the restaurant around 8:30am and were seated almost immediately. The first impression was that the space was far out and really cool. A weird ""egg"" theme carries throughout the place, letting you know that you're in a 'Breakfast' spot. Our waitress set us up with coffee and tea. My coffee was good and strong and my girlfriend loved that they gave her a teapot, complete with a press. Nice touch.  Pouring over the menu, I had a really hard time trying to decide what I wanted. They have a vast array of interesting and kicked-up breakfast dishes, with a distinct Mexican theme. I finally decided on the Sassy Eggs....my lady friend, the Banana Infused French Toast. The eggs were definitely Sassy. Two over easy eggs, covered in cheddar cheese, over a bed of chorizo-spiked hash. On top, a glob of guac and artful squirts of salsa and sour cream. It was fantastic. The balance of flavors was right on. The french toast? Divine. Covered in perfectly ripe bananas, the toast is made from big slices of Texas toast. A creme anglais infused with banana drenched the toast. If you like dessert for breakfast, I highly encourage this dish!!!  Overall, the service was prompt and kind, while the food was just plain awesome. I will say it's a little pricey at about $10-15 a plate, but i'll say it's worth every penny. I can't wait to go back, but get there early if you want a spot, the Check Please Syndrome is hitting this place hard.",0.9854,0.82,0.157,0.024,0.5312891986062719

Today I finally convinced four friends from around the city to meet my husband and me there for an undoubtedly delicious meal. Probably tired of my raving about this spot, they obliged. Since the temperature was in the teens, we huddled inside and were directed by the hostess to wait in the back. No problem. We were just happy to be safe from the frio. We made our way to the very back of the restaurant and gathered by a handful of other waiting patrons. Suddenly, the kitchen door swung open and a very rude, angry cook / owner started barking at us for being in the way. We had just been told to wait there! Geez!! Anyhow, one of my friends did not react too kindly to the owner's very unpleasant manner, and it started to turn ugly. Very ugly. We left with me in tears. The only saving grace was the red-haired hostess who truly felt bad about the situation. Unfortunately, what can she do when it's the owner who's being such an a**hole? Needless to say, I will NOT be back.  The man can cook, but he's not deserving of my hard-earned money.",-0.4995,0.794,0.094,0.112,0.6708620689655173

2009-01-02,3.0,"As my daily breakfast is usually vegetable, egg, fruit, and yogurt based I tend to go all out for the sweet temptations when on Vacation and during my recent trip to Chicago I kept true to form in electing to check out Over Easy Cafe for one of my two breakfasts.  Conveniently located with unique dishes and cozy size and appearance, Over Easy is the kind of place that would be at the top of the breakfast food-chain in most major cities, but on my visit there was something lacking....that something was  service.  To avoid bashing the place entirely, as my food was quite delicious, let me just suggest avoiding the chubby female waitress with the nose ring - unless of course you want to have her avoid eye contact while she helps her myriad other tables. All service issues aside, I found the setting to be very quaint and the prices to be about what one would expect for a restaurant of its ilk.  Parking was cheap and plentiful, Coffee was Intelligentsia and refilled rapidly by our bus-boy, and the original service of our food took only approximately 15 minutes from the time we ordered.  For our dishes we selected three of the specials, the famous banana french toast, and a glass of the speckled orange juice - Pretty, but $4 for 8oz?  Skip it. Dish one, selected by my aunt, was the Banana Stuffed French Toast with whipped creme fraiche, bananas, caramel, crumbled walnuts, and powdered sugar and it was worth every bit of the hype.  Not overly sweet, the Brioche was perfectly grilled and wonderfully soft while the filling was airy and light, yet smooth and creamy.  The crumbled walnuts provided a modest crunch while the caramel and dusting of sugar allowed for just enough sweetness without burying the subtle flavors.  A winner, by all accounts. The second choice, my sisters, was vastly less impressive.  Titled Blueberry Crunch Pancakes with granola, candied pecans and blueberries, cinnamon butter and whipped cream, the dish was excessively dry and modestly flavorless until syrup was added...syrup  that we saw poured from a large container akin to those you'd buy at Sam's Club behind the bar.  For the prices charged, I rather expect pure maple syrup at restaurants like Over Easy; if they can do it at Griddle Cafe in LA and Bongo Room in Chicago, Over Easy should be able to do it too. Dish three, my mothers, was Spicy Corn Cakes with Scrambled Eggs and Berkshire Ham and another knockout.  The Corncakes were like  fantastic corn bread with a slight hint of sweet and an undertone of spice that perfectly offset the salty pork and airy cooked eggs.  While a better syrup choice would have made the plate an even bigger hit, I was glad my mom had eaten too much sweets at Bleeding Heart and left me a whole pancake to endulge in. The final selection, and second only to the Banana French Toast in appeal, was my Cannoli French Toast with brioche and sweetened  mascarpone cream, chocolate chips, strawberry coulis, pistachio, and whipped cream.  Another stunning example of perfectly prepared brioche, this dish was similar to the other French Toast in its subtlety and excellence at bringing forth multiple flavors and textures while still maintaining a cohesive concept. While not as sweet as a typical Italian Cannoli, the smooth mascarpone was brilliantly highlighted by crunchy mini chocolate chips and chopped pistachio.  The strawberry coulis was a wonderful addition, but far too little graced the plate to have any meaningful effect on the taste. Great concepts handicapped by corner cutting and service that suffered from both inadequate staffing and poor attitude - All told, Over Easy is a good little place for breakfast and we happened to luck out with immediate seating when we arrived (When we left there was quite a line,) but it isn't the sort of place I'd rush back to on subsequent visits to Chicago - or the kind of place I'd wait more than 10 minutes to grab a seat at.  Try it once, then head over to Bongo Room...repeatedly.

Yeah, on the expensive side, but then again, you're not getting a Denver omelet w/ a side of hash browns. Each meal is beautifully presented, with delicious combinations.

But to not make any sort of gesture is just poor. ...after waiting for nearly an hour and a half in the cold, I didn't expect the bum's rush the very moment the plates are cleared. I understand its busy, and the tables need to turn. But you can wait a minute or two, especially after spilling coffee on us? So why two stars instead of one or none? The food was very good -- but not good enough to put up with all the above. No, we won't be back. The food was fresh and good quality, Julius Meinl coffee is always a plus, and it is a nice touch that they put a coffee urn outside for the folks waiting -- they do get some things right. So maybe if you're just a party of two, don't mind a long wait in the cold, and don't mind heading back into the cold the moment you put down that last bite... this place might be OK. But the way I see it, there's lots of good breakfast places in Chicago -- so I'll stick to places that have great food AND treat their clientele well.",0.9965,0.775,0.182,0.043,0.505803329461866

I never had to wait for more than 20 seconds for anything! The menu was very creative and inventive for your usual breakfast spot - items such as, ""Sassy Eggs"" were on the list and there was even vegetarian friendly omelettes with tofu and non-meat chorizo! I did not order this item, I ordered a Mexican Omelette (I forgot the name!) off of their ""Brunch"" menu. It was delicious with beautiful and clean presentation and such speedy service. I think we waited a total of 8 minutes for our meals! We also had a DELICIOUS pumpkin french toast with the most amazing pumpkin spread! Highly recommended. The decor was very cute and roomy enough, not very large but not so crammed that it felt uncomfortable. I felt that the meals were more on the pricey side - paid $22 each person. Also, Over Easy is BYOB which was gladly appreciated by my company; they brought champange and made mimosas.

Awhile back one weekend, we went to Over Easy right at 7 a.m. when they opened. As the place is always packed, we were psyched to get there with no wait. Within a few minutes, all hell broke loose as the owner proceeded to yell at his female waitstaff about some menu issue. I mean YELL - and swear - loudly. We were so embarrassed - we were mortified. In fact, one of the waitresses quit on the spot and walked out. Don't get me wrong - I have nothing against swearing. I swear - a lot. If I didn't swear, I'd have to kill. Take your pick. But never, ever, ever should a restaurant manager or owner display this kind of staff treatment in front of customers. Ever. Take it outside or go in the freezer - but not in front of us. Our waitress arrived at our table apologetic at what we just witnessed - but we were so pissed we left. I later wrote the owner a letter telling him how unprofessional this was and how irritated we were as he treated us as if we were invisible and it did not matter that we bore witness to this. I will say, he called us twice and left msgs, apologizing, and he did send us the letter for free breakfasts. We just have not wanted to go back. Prior to this we had been there a few times and loved it. We had hoped it would be our new hangout but, alas, this didn't happen. We will be back - sometime.

That being said, this is DEFINITELY a ""sell your first born for a table between the hours of 10 and 1"" type of brunch place.  So if you can, avoid the weekends, or if you must on a Sat. or Sun -- go early or go late. We went late, at around 1:30 on a Sunday, and only had to wait about 10 mins.  They do a good job of trying to keep those waiting happy, with a cart of Julius Meinl coffee parked outside the front door.  There is pretty much no space for waiting inside, so I'm guessing in the frigid months, this is not a place you want to go on the weekends.  Nonetheless, sometimes you have to brave the weather for something you want.  And even though it was raining a bit, I stood outside in the rain, sipping my gratis JM coffee, waiting for my table (ok, but only for 10 mins). Oh the food.  OH the food.  So many interesting choices, so many egg dishes done so many different ways.  I had the ""dates benedict"" (was actually a spanish name i now cannot remember) but here is the gist -- english muffin slathered in a date jam, topped with perfectly cooked poached eggs and ham, topped with a succulent piece of bacon and an amazing yet light red pepper sauce for a little kick.  It's like bacon wrapped dates and eggs benedict got marred and had a baby.  And since I love both, I was in absolute heaven with this dish. As we usually do with brunch, fiance ordered a sweet dish and we split both dishes -- so we each get some sweet, some savory.  I highly recommend this brunch tactic.  Our sweet dish was the strawberry cannoli french toast, which was absolutely amazing.  Between two large pieces of french toast was a delicious ricotta/chocolate chip mixture, surrounded by a strawberry coulis.  I have no words.   Server was incredibly nice and sweet.  The owner was out and about and actually working as host (I overheard him say his hostess got sick so he sent her home).  Super friendly and obviously cares a lot about his business, and it shows.  Great atmosphere, great staff, even better food.  It's no wonder this place has lines out the door.

I don't know why the owner keeps changing the name of the breakfast sandwich, when it is basically the same sandwich every time. Is he trying to trick people? The egg sandwich is just about the only thing I like here, though. The pumpkin/sugar french toast/pancake specials are always way too sweet, with lots of whipped cream, for some reason. Who wants whipped cream at breakfast? Not to mention the bizarre spicy omelet/guacamole combinations. Most of them do not even sound appealing.  If you want a much better brunch that's worth the $, head to Glenn's Diner on Montrose, or trek all the way to Bongo Room in the South Loop.

2008-06-10,5.0,"One of my clients has raved about this place for months. He and his partner are regulars here and on several occasions he told me about the great brunches he has had here. Since I was being good to myself this weekend and I had stayed in the night before I decided I needed to take myself out for breakfast. Since Paige W told me about her experience sitting at the counter, I too was hoping to have a seat there and some good conversation. I spent about 10 minutes looking for parking, (not super easy folks!), but finally secured a spot and walked in. It was just a party of one, a hungry party at that, and though the place was jumping at about 8:15am, I was seated at a two top in an instant. Sadly no counter top conversation for me this morning. I perused the menu, though I kinda knew what I was going to order. My client had talked about this dish called ""Sassy eggs"". Hmmm I needed to check this out, I put in an order with scrambled egg whites and a short stack of pancakes. As I sipped on my fresh juice, I looked around. Families, friends, couples, in a bright cheery atmosphere. The waitresses knew the regulars, chatting with them, playing with the kids, heck my waitress, (Gwen I just learned today), called me ""honey""... gee... *kicks the ground a little, starts to blush and looks away*... I kinda feel like a regular a little too.  Then it what seemed like minutes, (more like 5 of them), my food pipping hot came out. Cripe... I ordered a lot of food. My ""Sassy eggs"" were piles of chorizo, red and green bell peppers and pan fried potatoes, which were then covered with my egg whites, cheese and guacamole and chipotle ketchup. Um... yum. Could I have eaten it any faster? Probably not, but everything was fresh, hot and tasty. The guacamole was seasoned well and everything lent itself to some sassiness. Then after quickly scarfing down my hearty breakfast I looked over.... shoot I have pancakes too... crud. I manned up. I looked at those two large and tasty cakes of pan square in the syrup... and poured it on and made them disappear. Okay just kidding I was still hungry and polished them off post haste, they may have been a little dry, but I drown those puppies in syrup so I never notice that, just that they were darn delicious.  The bill came from my sweetheart of a waitress, she was seriously a nice girl but I think everyone is like that here. Even the busboys were saying ""Hello! How are you? Good to see you again!"" to the customers. I paid and left quickly as a party of one I don't have any reason to take up a table on a busy Sunday breakfast.  Some things to note, they apparently do one BYOB dinner here a month, inquire with them, not with me. Also they had a fire a while back, what did the owner do? Found everyone who works for him a job until they got the place back up and running. I'll be back in a heartbeat, just know, there might be a wait for a table, but there is also coffee for you while you wait... in case you like that kinda thing.",0.9967,0.806,0.157,0.037,0.4931202395488112

It had the kind of spice that kept building and building until I had to pause to wipe the sweat from my forehead. The sauce was fiery and the eggs were fluffy.

The coffee was also tasty (not quite sure what type of bean, but a unique flavor).  The aesthetic was a modern one infused with egg decorations, and pulled together nicely.

They're all about being playful, but they still get the job done. (Unlike swirly, curly straws...too much time and effort involved getting that liquid to your mouth, if you ask me.) I strolled over solo to this bustling Ravenswood joint on a chilly May morning (grr) with a tote bag full of magazines I needed to catch up on. I fully expected to spend at least an hour outside, reading, enjoying free cups of Julius Meinl coffee and listening to the street musician who'd set up camp next door.  But ah, the joys of dining alone: I walked in, held up one finger and was immediately seated at the brightly lit breakfast bar. Score. The restaurant itself has all the trappings of a Chicago brunch hotspot. Exposed brick, mirrors on the wall to make the interior seem bigger, tables practically on top of each other, multidecibel sound rating, servers tripping over themselves.  I was handed two menus when I sat down, one with loose-leaf tea choices and the other with my food and beverage choices. I settled on a ""freckled"" orange juice (plain ol' OJ blended with strawberry puree), a bottomless cup of coffee, blackeye French toast and a side order of bacon. I knew it would be too much food, but honestly, I see the word Applewood and simply cannot resist. The French toast was fresh blackberries and an orange cream with the consistency of pudding (Jesus) sandwiched between two slices of French toast. With some sort of orange marmalade reduction-y type syrup. And whipped cream. And orange zest. The bacon was delicious, though bacon's pretty tough to screw up. I am sad to report, however, that the French toast looked much prettier than it tasted. Give me plain ol' Victory's Banner French toast any day. Or my mom's. Man, I miss her cooking. Umm. The best part of being at Over Easy by myself was the opportunity to converse with strangers. It's the best part of life in Chicago, really, if you're me. I was seated next to a lovely redhead named Samantha who'd just moved into the neighborhood. We talked about jobs, plants, suburban work and city life, and I pimped Yelp as I always do. Meeting another like-minded local resident made me so happy that I wayyyyyy overtipped and practically skipped out of the restaurant.

2008-05-10,5.0,"I was hesitant to go on a Saturday morning around 10 a.m., but the wait was only about 10 minutes for two of us.  As someone else mentioned, it's a very small joint and seems heavily skewed toward two tops, so if you're a larger party be forewarned during peak times.  We were in and out while a party of four that arrived at the same time was still waiting to be seated.  Free coffee outside during the wait was a nice touch. This place gets five stars for food and incredible service.  One hostess, three servers and two busboys had this place running like one of those debit card commercials.  Both busboys had visited our table for drink orders within a minute of sitting down.  Our server timed her visit to take our orders perfectly.  And shockingly, our orders came out in what had to be only five minutes.  It was so fast that I thought they must have made a mistake and brought us somebody else's order.  My smoked salmon scrambler was great (not stingy with the salmon), and my wife loved her basil and sun-dried tomato omelet (very flavorful) with enough leftover to take home.  Refills on water and coffee were never lacking, and they even take the time to clear small trash like sugar packets from the table when they stop by. I did deduct half a star (but rounded up) since it does get rather noisy because of the space it's in.  I'd also be wary of showing up with more than two people on the weekend.  Also, the prices seem to be on the higher side - $10 and $9 respectively for the scrambler and omelet.  So with coffee and tip, you're over $30 for breakfast.  But if the food and service continues to deliver consistently, I won't mind paying the premium.",0.991,0.811,0.145,0.044,0.5628418803418803

Very generous that anything is free these days.      Inside is svelt and loft-like. Great colors, exposed brick and big, bright windows make for a cheery experience. I loved the bottomless lemonade. Seemed we rubber-necked longer than usual as this was our first visit. So many interesting dishes were plopping down near us it was a chore to chose one. I eat like I'm on the Zone diet, but weekend breakfast is when I treat myself. Had a mish-mosh of smaller dishes instead of a special or menu dish. The eggs are carton-style but were perfectly cooked, just under dry and lots of them. The pancakes(2), which I ordered as a side, were plate-size, fluffy delicious, airy and moist. I consider a pancake good if I can eat it without syrup. These qualify easily. They were amazing with just a slice of orange squeezed on them. Honestly.      The apple bacon was very sweet and meaty. It took an extra trip to the kitchen to cook it well enough for for my taste. I dig crispy, though not burned, bacon. I think I'm in the minority, which is always fine by me. The potatoes were seasoned nicely.      The only issue we had sitting against the south wall was the shrinking table space as our food arrived. A few consolidations cleared this up pretty quick, though. We were two at a two-top and the bench seat had a cozy indent where the last folks had sat. Very friendly crowd.

I'm afraid I wasn't impressed with my food.  The guacamole piled on top was tasty, but the scrambled tofu itself was bland.  The veggie chorizo mixed in was ground to a pulp and the dish was just too spicy for my liking.  I was disappointed that the one vegan dish on the menu was spicy (there are a bunch of us wimpy, non-spice-loving vegans ) and not very good. To their credit, my omnivore dad loved his blueberry pancakes.  And my Black-Eyed OJ (orange juice mixed with blackberry juice) was excellent, though quite pricey.

Don't be put off when you pass by the people waiting outside; there is no room to wait inside but the wait passed quickly for us (15 minutes tops at about 8:30 on a Sat morning) and is made easier by the complimentary coffee stationed outside (really nice touch in my opinion). Once inside an offer of coffee came immediately, and the waitress was not far behind to take any other drink or food orders that we were ready for.  I had a very difficult time choosing because many items looked good, but finally settled on the Damen Avenue Omelet, which was one of the specials.  When it came out, I thought there was no way I would ever finish it, but in fact it was a perfect portion because it was so fluffy.   The toast selection is about 5 different types, although to be honest, I stopped listening after she said ""sourdough"".  My husband went for the Sassy Eggs, which were well named.  Very spicy, with rather a lot of jalapeo, but that was perfect for him.  He described it as perfectly balanced and not needing any hot sauce - and this from a man who has literally 6 different types of hot sauce at home (don't laugh - they each have their own purpose, or so I'm told). Our usual judge of service comes down to getting the check since we've been to many places where service was great until we were ready to go and then the wait staff was no where to be found.  Not so here!  Check was prompt but not in a manner that made you feel rushed out. Inside was loud (but aren't pretty much all brunch places?) but not to the point where we couldn't have a conversation (albeit with a few ""what?""s).  I liked the color scheme - some light orange and greens against the exposed brick walls, and the mirrors made it feel a little bigger than it was.  The egg decorations were cute but not overdone (no pun intended). The only suggestion I would have for management (if you're reading this): keep the front door closed a little longer until it gets just a bit warmer!  I certainly understand the desire and it makes the entrance more welcoming, but unfortunately it also cools off the food and coffee rather quickly if you happen to be close to it.",0.9979,0.741,0.204,0.055,0.6227945665445667

That being said, I feel my rating is a little bit low.  I guess it's above average, but I don't think I'll ever be suggesting it to anyone as a place they, or we, should go.   It's not bad.  It's really not.  There's nothing 'wrong' with it.   There's just nothing that makes me want to go back.  I had the sunrise omelet.  Sundried tomato, pesto, gouda cheese.  All things I'd punch kittens for; yet, it was just okay tasting.  The potatoes were very flavorful.  The toast was overly crusty and a bit mediocre.  The applewood bacon was three and a half bucks for three slices.  Maybe I'm just cheap, but that 1/16th pound of meat didn't do it for me at that price.  It was just bacon.  My favorite part of the meal was probably the fact that my orange juice was extremely cold.  I don't know why it was so good, but very cold orange just is very good. I am not a big a fan as the decor as everyone else seems to be.  OMG CUTE SALTSHAKERS AND HOLY SHIT LOOK THERES LITTLE BREAKFAST THEMED ART ON THE WALLS HOLY SHIT SHIT SHIT OMG OMG OMG.  Yeah, doesn't do it for me.  It's okay, but the seating is honestly a bit cramped (when a woman was taking off her coat to sit at the counter, her ass and my face came DANGEROUSLY close for us not having met before).   The waitress was good. Fast, attentive, and responsive.  But is that a real southern accent?  My companion and I could not tell.  Because when she was talking to us, she had a southern accent.  But when she was practicing her Spanish with the other staff, it was accent free.  And when talking to a different set of customers, she had a different accent.  It wasn't bad per se, just confusing. I guess my low rating is more reactionary than anything.  I'm a blue collar guy.  I'm not the least bit ironic.  When I wear jeans, they are not at all skinny.  My knit hats don't have bills, or fluffy balls attached to them, or long strings to which I will need to tie the earflaps down.  Were I a different kind of guy, I'd be falling all over myself to give this place a handjob.  But I'm not.  I'm just a regular guy, and this place is nothing special to me.",0.5218,0.772,0.117,0.112,0.5453108516997406

That being said, it WAS good: There's free coffee while you wait, the wait wasn't too long (25 minutes on a Saturday at the height of brunch time), and you can wait in the great little coffee shop next door if it's raining. The food was gorgeous, and delicious- my friend and I split the banana spiked French toast with toasted pecans, a menu standard, and an omlette with spinach, goat cheese, and portabella mushrooms, which was a special- and it was suprisingly not greasy or heavy. The roasted potatoes on the side were super flavorful, and there was actually Cholula to put on them! Plus, our waitress had a great Southern accent. That being said, there were some things that could use improvement.   They ran out of free coffee for those waiting outside, and even after we mentioned it to the hostess, they never brought out more. They use prepackaged half-and-half for the coffee, rather than the real stuff. And there was Smucker's jam for the toast, which didn't seem up to par with the rest of the menu. Also, there was little in the way of healthier options, just the standard fruit, yogurt, and granola combo.  So maybe I'm nitpicking, but I think with a couple of minor improvements (especially in the arena of condiments) this place could become my go-to weekend brunch restaurant.",0.9969,0.781,0.219,0.0,0.4590986394557823

When we arrived, parking was-a-plenty. Then again, it was a Tuesday. Anyways, the place was so cute. There were egg decorations all over the place. It was small but not cramped. I ordered the sassy eggs, one friend got an omelet and the other got French toast. The sassy eggs were a good change from ordinary skillets, but it was a little too heavy as a breakfast item. The dish was a little spicy, there was ketchup, sour cream, and guacamole and I think, ground beef. The omelet was yummy, nicely portioned and not overcooked. The French toast was simple, not soggy, so what more can you ask for? The service was quick and the atmosphere nice. I'll be back!",0.9941,0.8,0.2,0.0,0.5155525030525031

2007-03-19,4.0,"Cozy brunch spot with a small, creative menu.  I went here for the first time this past Saturday around 11am and was seated right away.  I had a Greek omelet which was light and delicious.  My friend had the Sassy eggs which have some kick to them and were delicious as well.  The chef/owner hails from such places as Tweet, Uncommon Ground, and M Henry. Another patron next to us had a upside-down apple pancake that looked heavenly and apparently tasted as such judging from her audible moans of approval!   I'll definitely be back for more...",0.9753,0.748,0.237,0.015,0.5187675070028012
2007-02-23,5.0,Ordinarily I would recommend simplicity when talking about breakfast. Over Easy is anything but. They have chosen the adventurous route and for that I commend them. Afterall if you are going for plain you might as well stay home and make breakfast for one.  Try the Sassy eggs. They will make the usually lengthy weekend wait worth it.,0.928,0.762,0.238,0.0,0.4900793650793651
2007-02-06,2.0,The food not great.  I had this thing with bologna and eggs which was pretty good.  However my friend had the french toast it was rubbery and dry. I wouldn't go back.,0.7189,0.674,0.241,0.085,0.4916666666666667

2006-08-23,5.0,"This has become my favorite place to go for breakfast or brunch.  I still have not had everything on the menu, but I plan to.  They have great omelets and egg dishes which never fail, and when I feel like something sweet for breakfast they got that covered too (Mascarpone stuffed strawberry french toast, very good!).  There is always a wait which can be as long as 45 minutes so get there before you are starving.  You can tough out the wait with a cup of complementary coffee which they leave outside which I think is a nice touch.",0.9579,0.738,0.202,0.06,0.5763333333333333

2006-05-28,5.0,"Expect to spend anywhere from $9 - $20/per person if you eat here. I think it is well worth the price considering the portion of food you get.  EDIT: I come here all the time for the Sassy Eggs. TRY THE SASSY EGGS AT LEAST ONCE OR IF IT IS YOUR FIRST TIME! They have very inventive dishes. A lot of the omelettes are Latin-inspired (I can't believe I just used that term). They have a lot of great pancakes and french toast concoctions as well. I had the ""New Mexican Omelette"" or something to that effect and it was pretty good. The potatoes were tasty. You even get this strawberry and orange garnish. The presentation of the food is well done. The Sassy Eggs are great. I was told that breakfast is served all day. The lunch menu has really great selections as well.  Don't come here on a weekend unless you're ready to wait. Parking can be kind of a nightmare depending on when you come down as well. If you're going to come on a weekend, I recommend heading down after 1:30. But make sure you're there before 3pm!!!   It is definitely worth trying...",0.9905,0.794,0.206,0.0,0.5058080808080807
2006-05-15,3.0,"This place reminds me of Bongo Room in terms of its high prices, long waits and yuppie patrons.  That said, it does boast a creative menu that definitely deviates from the standard fare.  I had the Strawberry Sublime -- french toast stuffed with strawberries and mascarpone and drizzled with strawberry syrup all over -- and it was decent, though not quite on the same level as the French Toast Orgy at Toast.  My girlfriend's peach pancakes were tasty too -- three big pancakes plus they didn't skimp on the peaches.  Although  we didn't indulge in the option, I liked the fact that the place is BYOB, even if I question my bloody mary making abilities on a Sunday morning. A few minor gripes: 1) With so many tasty options to choose from, Over Easy would be wise to follow Bongo Room's lead and offer half orders of their pancakes and french toast 2) I wish they had more egg dishes but that's just because I'm normally a bigger fan of the savory stuff vs the sweet stuff 3) If Over Easy is going to charge the prices that it does, then it should really start serving freshly squeezed orange juice, not the stuff from concentrate that you find in large plastic milk jugs All in all, Over Easy doesn't really compare to the likes of Bongo Room, Toast, Orange, M Henry, etc.  But it's not bad either so as long as you don't get your hopes up too much, you can expect to have a pleasant meal there.",0.9857,0.839,0.143,0.018,0.4565699404761905
2006-03-29,5.0,"An excellent addition to the stable of fine restaurants in Ravenswood (Yes Thai and Cafe Dorado). This upscale breakfeast/lunch joint provides a higher end fare than nearby Golden Nugget and Pauline's. The service is excellent and the prices are reasonable for the high quality that you receive. A note of warning however, every single weekend since they have opened that have been packed so make sure you either get there VERY early (i.e. 7:00AM - 8:00AM) or stop in through the week when it is less crowded.",0.8548,0.806,0.146,0.048,0.5636219336219336
