I'm a vegetarian and they do an amazing job of accommodating! I order Kimbap  and Chopchae  and I usually have to ask for the Effie option. This menu has it already on it! Love that!!!

The music playlist is as sumptuous as the food- we really enjoyed the modern mix of jazz, electronic, and house in the background. This would make a great date spot. We ordered the bulgolgi roll which is sushi-style Korean bulgolgi beef and a variety of fresh veggies served with pre-mixed wasabi and soy sauce. This might make a purist cringe but like many Americans I enjoy the combination of salty and spicy so this was really convenient. It was also served with a garnish of pickled radish which complimented the savory maki well. I ordered the kimchi soup as an entrée which was served with a side of pickled and fermented veggies. The soup itself was perfectly spicy; enough to linger on the tongue but not make you gasp for milk. The pork was ample and the broth was perfect for a cool spring evening. It is served with steamed white rice and brown rice is available for $1 extra. My friend ordered the bibimbap which was served with fresh veggies and an instagram-worthy garnish of sprouts wrapped with seaweed and a delicious red bean paste on the side. We mixed the savory paste in right away.  My friend also ordered a lychee martini which is made with sweet potato alcohol and comes with a whole lychee. It was delicious and reasonably priced at $9.

2017-04-10,2.0,"I've been a Korean food eating machine lately and I was pretty excited to try this place, but to quote the almighty Yelp god, ""Meh.  I've experienced better.""  On a Friday night, it was full of cool, interesting people having interesting conversations (I know they were interesting because you sit so close to your neighboring diners, you can't help but hear their conversations). So, it's got the I'm-out-at-a-cool-place-on-a-Friday-night vibe, but this old married lady only cares about one thing: the food. And this is where they lost me.  In short, I've had much better Korean food for nearly half the price.  Nothing wowed me.  Standard dishes like Bi Bim Bap and Chap Chae were just standard.

Unlike other Korean restaurants which I have been to, Jin Ju is modern, more western or possibly modern Korean. I ordered the spicy squid stirfry. My friend ordered the bibim bab. We got a few complimentary munchies but they weren't as good as I have had them in other Korean restaurants. The kimchi wasn't memorable. My friend's bibimbap came in a white cereal bowl. It tasted fine! But the hot stone bowl effect, which is key in that experience was missing. Our server insisted on mixing my friend's bibimbab, which raised a question mark in our heads. Apart from that, he was friendly. My stirfry was good! The tea, is a tea bag tea - well, they could do away with tea bag green tea. It takes away from the Korean experience.  Pricing was ok! It was $20 plus per person. I think there are better Korean places but maybe not in Andersonville. So, if you're in the area, wanting Korean try it.",0.8627,0.855,0.099,0.046,0.43668831168831174

The only place from our Chicago dining spots that the dishes were worth a photo. Unfortunately, we've done touristy stuff all day long and our phone had no more battery life to take photos. We got there early Sunday evening. I was surprised that it wasn't packed. This place is so packed and so not pricey that it should be packed. The decor is very nice and quaint. Love the dark colors and the huge mirrors.  They have a full bar, so that's already a plus in my book.  I started off with a Lychee Martini (made of soju) and later I had a Scotch, champagne and Campari cocktail (Autumn Lief). Decent wine list, really good whiskey  The menu had too many things we wanted to order, but we settled on 4 dishes. It's not a Korean barbecue, like the ones we're used to in LA. it's a Korean fusion restaurant and I loved it.  We had the Sam Gyup Sal and it was just effin amazing! Such a great idea of ingredients combination. It worked perfectly, The pork belly practically tasted like chicken, it wasn't fat at all. The Brussels sprouts were perfectly cooked and all the flavors just blended perfectly. Not only that, but it looked beautiful. The presentation of all the dishes was just amazing! They all looked beautiful (on other tables, too).  We also had the Haemul Pajun as our second appetizer. The scallion pancake was the best I've had at any Japanese or Korean restaurant. There was plenty of squid and two large mussels on top. The spicing was also perfect.  For entrees we had the Dol Sut Bi Bim Bap. I must say, it was the best and also the best looking Bi Bim Bap dish I've ever had.    Just yummy! It's basically, rice topped with beef, beans sprouts, spinach, carrots, shiitake mushrooms, shredded radish, green leaf lettuce, fried egg and a spicy red pepper paste sauce served in a sizzling hot pot with sesame oil and a side of miso soup. I really wish we could have taken a photo of it, but there are photos of it here. It is as delicious as it looks. :-) We also had the Dak Bulgogi and it was just fantastic. The flavoring, the portion size, the presentation, everything was just out of this world. I could have had another one.  We got so full from these 4 dishes that we didn't even ask for a dessert menu. I wish we stayed in Chicago for more days, so we could try some of the other dishes as well,  The service was wonderful. And the prices are very affordable for what you get (and what we're used to in LA).  They do have a back room for private events. I would totally love to have my birthday party there.

We also tried some dumplings which were really good, although the sauce could have used a little more flavor.

2016-01-24,4.0,"My fiancé and I came to Jin Ju thinking it was a sushi restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised to fine this small Korean restaurant tucked away in Andersonville. For starters we ordered the SAM GYUP SAL. It was slicked pork belly with roasted garlic and brussel sprouts.  If you're at all familiar with brussel sprouts you are well aware they aren't anyone's favorite food. Yet Jin Ju found a way to make them a delicious addition to this dish without making them unhealthy. Needless to say my first impression was a good one. For the main dish I had one of my favorite Korean dishes Chap Chea. This is a colorless vermicelli noodle usually served in a sauce with mushrooms, onions, and chicken, pork, or beef. Jin Ju choose beef, roasted red peppers, sesame seed oil, spinach, Shiitake mushrooms, and carrots. It was a truly wonderful and well thought out dish. My one complaints is that it wasn't quite flavorful enough. My experience with Chap Chea from other Korean restaurants is that it's a spicy option. Jin Ju made a very tasty entree that I felt could have had a little more kick. But, if spicy isn't your think, then I definitely recommend this item. My fiancé ordered the O Jinga Bokum. It's a sautéed squid dish with veggies in a red pepper sauce. Now this was a meal with a kick!  It had a heat that built up over time making you take a time out to cool your mouth with a drink. But the heat didn't linger and he was back to eating not long after. The squid was prepared perfectly which is hard to find.  Overall Jin Ju was our happy mistake for a Saturday evening meal.

We never wait long for our appetizers, and the main dishes arrive on time and still fresh and hot. Even when they are busy. 2. The AMAZING flavor of everything on the menu. We have tried too many dishes to name (most of which can be made vegetarian, which we really appreciate), and every one of them, no exception, has been out of this world. Just bursting with flavor but subtle enough not to overpower the palate. Not easy when you're dealing with kimchi and peppers, but these chefs know how to make Korean food right. Super impressive dishes, every one. Although our favorites are the Kimchi Pancake and the vegetarian Jab chae--you just can't go wrong if you order those. 3. The atmosphere. It's a calming, dark, intimate setting for a date or a party. Not too loud, but not unnervingly quiet.  My new hubby and I just had a private party here, and the service and execution of the entire 3 hours was far more than we expected.

They were also super accommodating and cleared the table and gave us fresh dessert plates when we pulled out a cake.  The food itself is great! I've always been a fan of the cocktails.

2015-02-28,4.0,"I expected Jin Ju to be a traditional Korean restaurant filled with middle aged Korean people and where a distressed Korean waitress seats you and places a hundred side dishes in front of you. However, I walked into a very dimly lit place, illuminated by a few candles. The first vibe you get is that it is a hip bar, but if you are here for the food, a host will seat you in another area. People in the restaurant were mostly young professional hipsters, mostly in groups of 2-5. The slim, 2-sided menu offered various options. They offered many appetizers including mandoo (dumplings), pajun (thin scallion pancakes), and tegim. We tried the hemul pajun, which was very fresh, simple, and delicious. They offered two soups: mandoo soup and miyuk soup. My friend, who never tried miyuk soup before, loved the miyuk soup.  I ordered the yookgejang, and as it was spicy, I recommend it to people who can tolerate spice. It was very rich and savory, and it really cleared up my head. I was in love. My friend ordered the sanchae bibimbap, and she was in love with the blend of flavors and freshness. The side dishes were adorable- not really sure about why they chose  The waiters were  friendly, and the place wasn't too loud or too quiet so we could chitter away. The music was calming, yet energetic and I really liked the mood lighting. Dining there was a wonderful way to destress on a Friday night.  I would love to try the drinks next time!!!  Tips: -It's not a large space, and it's certainly not a place to go with a mass of people. -Not Korean BBQ -the only Vegetarian dish would be the bibimbap.

For my entree, I got the Chap Chae dish with beef and vermicelli noodles.  Nice and thin stretchy noodles with a tasty sweet, soy sauce. My friend got the Dak Bulgogi.

I can honestly say I've been here five times in the past five weeks.  I've had basically every appetizer, the Kim Chee Pajun, the Daeji Kalbi; which is my partner's favorite, the Mandoo, and MY personal favorite; the Dak Gan Jang chicken wings! I don't know what spices they put in these, but they're just as addictive as crack. Not that I've tried crack, but I find myself craving these on the daily-so I can only imagine! As far as dinner goes, I've only had the Dak Bulgogi. It's. That. Good. It has this mildish firey flavored seasoning (how can that even exist) that is so damn delicious, my mouth is watering now just thinking about it.  How could I forget the drinks!?!? I've never experienced soju vodka before, so imagine my surprise as to how smooth their sojutinis go down. So light and so smooth, hardly sugary or overly sweet.  The Pear is my favorite, with the Jinger coming in second.  It's easy to down 3 or 4... Okay, 4-and I'm hardly a lush.  Aside from the food and drinks, what I really like about this place is the atmosphere and staff. It's totally casual, with a chic urban feel that's just as comfortable as it is stylish.

2014-05-25,2.0,"Came here on a Saturday night. Surprisingly, the place was not too busy. Came here with my fiance and his parents. We all got the bibimbap, cocktails, and an appetizer.  Once seated, we waited about 10-15 minutes before our waiter even got to our tables and asked if we wanted drinks. After our orders were in, our drinks came within 10 minutes, but our appetizer didn't come for another 20 or so minutes after receiving our drinks. The bibimbap comes with banchan, which are the traditional small-plated sides that come with Korean meals. After our appetizer, our waiter never came to our table to check in (another 15 minutes after we had finished our appetizers) until he served us an individual serving each of kimchi, potato salad, and pickled cucumber slices. He told us it was ""to share"". However, the portion size was lacking for the banchan considering that four of us ordered entrees that came with it and we only had enough for one person; it was less than the one order of appetizers we had shared.  After he served us the banchan, our waiter quickly left before we could even get a word in and order more drinks. I looked around and, again, the place was not that busy so we don't know why we scarcely saw our waiter if at all. We had to actually ask a different waiter if we could order more drinks.  Again, it was another waiting game for our bibimbap. After we had finished the banchan, which didn't take long, we waited another 20 or so minutes until our bibimbaps came to our table.  Overall, the food was decent, but the service was lacking. It took over an hour to get our entrees after ordering. Also, our waiter never checked in on us in between courses and we had to actually ask someone else in order to order more drinks. I might try this place again, but considering the countless authentic Korean restaurants located all over the city that offer better (and timely) service, similar if not better quality food, and better banchan, maybe not.",0.9455,0.955,0.045,0.0,0.42933333333333334

Our waiter here was great, very attentive and knowledgeable.  When the food came out, he asked each of us if we were familiar with these dishes and how they are traditionally eaten.  I thought that was nice of him.  Although I loved the atmosphere and service, the food was nothing spectacular.  It wasn't bad though, but just didn't measure up to the vibe they were trying to present.   We started off with the kim bap.  If you aren't familiar with kim bap, it is like sushi but without the fish.  It was good, but kind of expensive for a roll of vegetables, rice, and seaweed.  For the entree, I ordered the domi (lightly battered tilapia filet served with eggplant, mushrooms, and carrots.)  I thought this dish was phenomenal.  I loved how the different flavors from the ginger, hot mustard, and soy sauce came together to give it a nice sauce that wasn't too overwhelming.  But the awe stopped there for our entrees, the rest of the dishes (dol sut bi bim bap, yook gae jang, and bulgogi) ordered was just ok.  I had similar dishes elsewhere that taste a lot better at a more affordable price.     Overall, we did enjoy ourselves and the food.  We just had better Korean food elsewhere.  Also the banchan (side dishes) didn't have much of a variety like I'm used to.  But if you were looking for a more contemporary spin on Korean food definitely check this place out.  It is a good place to kick back and relax over drinks and food.",0.995,0.82,0.17,0.01,0.5853174603174603

2013-08-19,4.0,"I had Jin Ju on my bookmarks for quite some time now and so happy that we finally ventured out to the city to have some great, contemporary Korean cuisine. I have to say it isn't the best that I've had but I absolutely loved the trendy atmosphere with the brick walls and the dim lighting and the open window to the restaurant. Oh and the service was phenomenal, loved our server, he really was on top of everything and made sure everything was brought out fast and timely as well as gave us some wonderful recommendations. Also, they do take reservations as it can get pretty busy on a late Saturday night so don't forget to do that in advance. Here are the goodies we tried and enjoyed at Jin Ju: -Mandoo- Dumplings filled with beef, onions, scallions, bean sprouts and tofu served fried or steamed but we had to go with fried obviously and they were super yummy and flavorful -Kim Bap- Seaweed roll filled with rice, bulgogi, spinach, carrots, cucumbers, yellow pickled radish, crab stick and egg. This was just a okay, I know a lot of reviewers rave about this but I supposed the only thing I prefer in my seaweed rolls is raw fish. -Yook Gae Jang- A soup filled with spicy beef broth with beef, bean sprouts, scallions and clear vermicelli noodles. Now this was delicious, super spicy so be prepared but full of flavor and texture. Definitely enjoyed it and would recommend it. -Bulgogi- Thinly sliced ribeye beef marinated in a mild soy sauce and sauteed with onions, shitake mushrooms, carrots and scallions. Also served with sticky white rice. This was tasty, but I felt like the portion wasn't as big as I would have liked it to be since it had the veggies. It was yummy, but would have preferred a little more.  So overall, Jin Ju didn't wow us off our feet but it was definitely tasty and if you're in the mood for contemporary Korean in the area, than come here for a fun night out with tasty food.",0.9985,0.734,0.244,0.022,0.5924005945745077

Jin Ju is a contemporary bar and lounge located in Andersonville. The ambiance is very zen and romantic. Great for a date night! The food is authentic but served with a contemporary flare.  For starters, their seafood or vegetarian pancakes, and Kimchi Mandoo (choice of steamed or fried dumplings) are amazing! They have many main entrees but my favorite there is the Bi Bim Bap (steamed hot pot filled with rice, vegetables, beef chunks, topped with raw egg) and the Dak Bulgogi (chicken slow cooked and simmered in a special sweet and sour spicy red sauce). They also have many vegetarian options but being a meat lover I naturally gravitate towards the meat and seafood dishes.

For apps, my party shared the pajun (pancake) with squid and mussels and Kim Bap Te Gim, which was basically a fried maki roll. Both were delicious and the wasabi that came with the latter was seriously spicy -- sinus-clearing spicy, but worth it. The pan chan was great -- esp the pickled broccoli. Our server brought us more when we ran out. For an entree, I got the Chu Gu Mi Dol Sut Bi Bim Bap (totally had to look at a menu online to get name/spelling right). It was phenomenal. Rice topped with octopus and scallops, kim chee, veggies, fish foe and an egg on top. It was served in a stone bowl that continued to cook the ingredients while I was eating it. I couldn't get enough, it was so so good. Also came with a little soybean and scallion soup on the side. Perfect meal for a freezing Chicago night.

What followed was one of the best meals in recent memory.  I have to assume that they would have given the same outstanding food and service to every table, and that they weren't just taking extra-special good care of their little erstwhile marketing props.  In any case, I was in heaven. Our waiter Shane was outstanding.  I greatly appreciate a server who genuinely seems to enjoy his job; in fact, it is almost priceless.   We started with the kim chee mandoo dumplings, which were pretty good.  The delirious portion of my meal was the entree, one of the evening's specials.  This was basically a beef short rib marinated for two days in a frigate-load of wonderful ingredients, then braised with some carrots and a few other vegetables, plus vermicelli noodles made from sweet-potato flour.  Shane summarized it as ""Korean pot roast,"" and I didn't realize until it came to the table how literally apt that description was.  The name that showed up on the bill was ""kolbi chim"" which I believe is Korean for ""send you to the moon in a short-rib boat."" Neither my Korean nor my English is proficient enough to describe how delicious that pot roast was.  In a way, I'm glad that it was a special, which gives it more of a ""lightning in a bottle"" mystique.  If it were on the menu, I would love to eat it more regularly, but that would detract from the magical memories.

2012-05-15,5.0,"Dinner at Jin Ju was a nearly flawless outing, from candlelit, sophisticated atmosphere to some of the best service I've had at a restaurant lately... and of course, the food. The man and I made a reservation, but ended up coming a little early and getting seated right away at what I'm convinced is the best table in the house (the first half-booth up the stairs and to the right).  Our server (I think her name was Randa?) was 100% wonderful---attentive, friendly and she appeared genuinely interested in our experience there. She happily explained a few entrees when I asked her some questions and even brought out some special dipping sauces to eat with our appetizers just because she likes them. She also gave us thorough descriptions of each dish when it arrived at the table, much more so than what was on the menu. Someone give that woman a raise. For starters, we ordered a tall Korean beer to share (Hite), the steamed kimchi mandoo (kimchi-scallion-tofu dumplings) and kim bap (sushi with bulgogi, veggies and crab). I loved both of these and would definitely order them again, though the kim bap would've been a bit dry without the extra sauce that the waitress brought. I was craving bi bim bap, so that's what I ordered even though I was so tempted by the dak dori tang (chicken and potatoes in a spicy-sweet red pepper broth) and the kimchi chigae (pork, tofu, kimchi broth). Of course, I had to have the hot stone pot version with sesame oil---the dol sut bi bim bap. The rice is crisping perfectly at the bottom of the pot and comes topped with beef, shitake mushrooms, some crunchy veggies, a fried egg and a sweet-spicy red pepper sauce. I also added kimchi to mine because that's the way I like it. Not only do you get this feast delivered sizzling to the table, but it also comes with a drinkable cup of miso soup and the small spread of banchan (little sides) that always comes with Korean meals. I couldn't even finish half my dinner because it was so big, but somehow my boyfriend managed to finish his enormous seafood bi bim bap AND save room for dessert, so we ordered a scoop of mango ice cream. I don't know if they make it in-house, but the little spoonful I had was tasty nonetheless!  To sum this up, I could not have been more happy with Jin Ju and I can't wait to come back and try more things... MANY more things... like the soju cocktails and the spicy soups and the kalbi and the pajun...",0.9974,0.841,0.155,0.003,0.5248120300751878

My parents were in town and I wanted to take them to get some delicious noms. Jin Ju appealed to me because: We haven't tried it (and have wanted to) It's close to our house I wanted spicy comfort food to cure my cold and I thought my parents would enjoy it Bing bang boom. I made a res and we showed up on time on Friday. We were seated immediately and started perusing the menu. First impressions? It's REALLY dark in Jin Ju. My vision is pretty good and I was holding the menu about 2 inches from my face. Some party members started off with drinks (I passed...I had taken enough cold medicine to kill a horse in the past 24 hours and alcohol wasn't needed in that mix) and we ordered several apps - the Kim Chee Pajun and the Kim Chee Mandoo. Basically, a scallion pancake filled with kim chee and steamed dumplings filled with kim chee. Both came out piping hot and tasty - though I will say, they were both VERY salty. I LOVE salt, but this was pushing it - even for me. The pancake was pretty thick and dense, as well...which isn't a bad thing, but it was a lot more filling than I thought it would be.  For my main I ordered the Kim Chee Chigae, which is a kim chee soup with pork, tofu, green chili peppers and scallions. Oh so good! It was SUPER spicy (the type of spice was reminiscent of the chili sauce they give you at Ethiopian restaurants) and there were huge chunks of pork and tofu with onions.

Now on to the important stuff.  For appetizers I've had the daeji kalbi (bbq pork spare ribs) and dak gan jang (fried chicken wings).  Both were exactly as good as they sound, and such a generous size that I could fill up on the appetizer alone.  For my entree, I always order the bulgogi (sliced ribeye beef) because when you find a keeper, you stay with it.  And I like my meat.   Still not convinced?  Well, with gdine you get your choice of an appetizer and entree for $16, so you're pretty much getting the app for free.  There's also an option for two sojutinis per person, and they're awesome enough here to let you split flights however you want amongst the table.  So if you're on a hot date and think two drinks might lead to a morning walk of shame, get one flight and split it.  See, I'm always lookin' out for ya.",0.9948,0.713,0.237,0.049,0.6253663003663004

Next time I'll be sure and bring my boyfriend.  Although the space was smaller than I imagined, I really liked it. It's a pretty sexy space. We were seated on the banquette, and although the tables are somewhat close together, it didn't feel cramped. I also liked that the decibels levels were reasonable - I hate having to shout above the din at my dinner companion.  I wished I had been more adventurous and started with one of their soju cocktails, but we decided to drink wine instead.  For starters we both ordered their house salad. This is easily in my top 5 salads of all time. Mixed greens, cucumbers, scallions and tempura-fried portobello mushrooms all lightly tossed in a sesame-soy vinaigrette. My lovely dining companion didn't eat all of her salad but I couldn't let it go to waste so I finished hers too. Clearly I have no shame. We each ordered bulgogi which comes with rice and assorted sides and kim chee. I think the sides change because the table next to us got different ones than we did. Ours were daikon, cucumbers and potato salad; all of which were fine but I didn't want to fill up on sides.  The bulgogi was good, but it wasn't great. I prefer mine a little more grilled -- theirs seemed steamed or boiled so it had none of those crispy edges that I love about bulgogi. The flavor was good, if a little on the sweet side and there were a TON of onions. I'd have preferred more scallions and less onions.  Desserts were a little disappointing as they offered no choices but green tea or red bean paste ice cream. And what's with no coffee? Since we heading out after dinner, we both wanted some caffeine and they don't offer it. I get that it's a Korean restaurant, but it's not exactly the height of authenticity, so why not offer some coffee for us Westerners?  The service was fair. It started out kind of frenzied; our server greeted us with ""What can I get you?"" -- there were no introductions or pleasantries given. The food also took a long time to get to our table, but we weren't in any rush so it wasn't a big deal.

2010-10-10,4.0,"Came here Saturday night in a group of 10 people.  We milled around at the bar while waiting for our party to arrive, and a few people had some cocktails which they appeared to enjoy (I did not have any so I can't really say anything about them).  Once our party was all present, we were promptly seated. The wait staff was attentive but didn't seem to care how long we stayed, which is good with a group of 10.  I always appreciate it when they take your appetizer order first and take your dinner order later.  The group ordered several different appetizers, most of which I tried.  They were all very good and did what appetizers should do - tided me over until dinner got there and got me excited about the main course. For dinner I ordered the chap chae.  It was quite tasty but the noodles were so long, it was somewhat difficult to eat.  After downing so many appetizers, I only ate about half of the noodles (side point - they served it with a side of rice which I found to be unnecessary for a noodle dish) but ate all the meet and veggies out of it.  I was definitely full by the end of the meal. I'm taking off a star for a few minor reasons.  First, they charge a $10 corkage fee.  I know they have a bar so the corkage fee is to encourage you to make use of the bar instead of bringing your own bottles.  But still, this can be a little pricey if you bring a $5.99 bottle of wine to split between 2 people.  Luckily there were 10 of us with about 8 bottles of wine so the $10 charge was acceptable. Secondly, the kimchi was sparse.  I love Korean food, and I LOVE kimchi.  There were three teeny tiny bowls of kimchi for 10 people to split.  This was a little sad.  They did bring out 3 other salads for sharing - apple/potato salad (a little bland but had a good texture), broccoli (it had some kind of light dressing and was a nice change from the main course), and a carrot slaw (had a definite kick to is - almost made up for the kimchi shortage). Finally, it was LOUD. Like REALLY LOUD. We were in the front near the door, and there weren't too many tables around us.  However, it was one of the loudest restaurants I've ever been to.  The decor is nice but on the minimalist side, and I think the tall ceilings mixed with the sparse decor made for some poor acoustics.  If it weren't for this, it would have seemed like a nice date restaurant.  But I suspect it's hard to be romantical when shouting across the table.

The Kim Chee Mandoo was a delightful combination of flavors that I wasn't expecting. The Deaji Kalbi were amazing. I'm not a fan of eating ribs in general, but some pieces were off the bone, which I took advantage of, and the boyfriend savored every bite of meat on the bone.

I returned after last visiting several years ago and was happy to see that things are pretty much the same- great service, delicious food with pretty presentation, and a modern and hip ambiance.

I loved the subtle flavors in my sojutini.  - Pajun potato/scallion pancake app  - Salad (fresh and colorful)  - Bulgogi (beef stir fry, heavy on the garlic and sesame oil flavors)  - Bi Bim Bap (you gotta get it in the stone bowl so the bottom rice cooks into a solid cake- that's considered a delicacy). They give you hot sauce to add to your taste and the mix of ingredients is quite plentiful.  - As is traditional with Korean cuisine we also received the various sides that come with the meal: kimchee (fresh!), broccoli, potato salad, and green beans. All were fresh and tasty with a little heat.  Our server was very friendly and the bus boy refilled our glasses frequently (a + in my boyfriend's book) and cleared our plates quickly. I would have liked to try more sojutinis but they are strong. They also had a great selection of Korean beers and extensive wine list. The place was packed (it was Saturday night) but we were seated immediately after arriving 10 minutes late to our reservation.

2008-12-22,4.0,"I've been to Jin Ju numerous times over the years and cannot believe that I have not yet reviewed it!  What was I thinking? Well, here goes... Jin Ju is a striking little spot on the Andersonville strip.  The decor has a minimalist chicness, yet manages to eschew pretension.  It's an upscale vibe that feels comfortable and relaxing. They have an extensive bar list (as well as a groovy little lounge in the rear of the restaurant) which features an abundance of soju-based (Korean liquor made from distilled sweet potato) martinis.  The Jinger is my favorite -- very gingery and very refreshing.  I have tried some of the others with mixed results.  I must add that I am not a fan of sweet drinks, so most of my previous nixes were due soley to the sweetness.  On my most recent visit, my fabulous new friend tried the asian pear soju-tini and offered me a sip.  It was sweet and not very pear-y.  It was by no means terrible, but not my drink of choice.  I'll stick to the Jinger.  Of course, they can mix up anything you'd like and have a good wine list as well The menu at Jin Ju offers a nice variety of traditional Korean dishes (Bibim-bap, Bulgogi) that are served up with style and innovation.  A good appetizer selection is also available. Recently, they offered a lovely Korean carpaccio (on special).  Although its presentation seemed more like tartare than carpaccio, the flavors were wonderful -- perfectly seasoned beef atop thin strips of Asian pear, garnished with peppery greens.  My friend had the Pajun (Korean pancake) --  savory scallion goodness that was delicious, if just a tad greasy. For an entree, I chose the Kim Chee Chigae.  It was a brisk, chilly evening, so a nice, hot soup seemed just the ticket.  I was not disappointed.  The soup was perfectly hot in both spiciness and temperature, full of tender beef and Kim Chee vegetables and was immensely satisfying.  The sticky rice on the side was a worthy compliment.  What with all the recent frigid weather, I will most likely be back for more of it soon!  YUM!  I should have offered my friend a taste, but I was enjoying it so much I fear I was overtaken by greediness.  I hope I will be forgiven!   The best part?  I was perfectly satisfied -- not too full nor did I feel compelled to eat more.  I love those establishments that have mastered the ""perfect portions"" of food. Prices at Jin Ju are quite fair -- it's not dirt cheap, nor is it ridiculously expensive (I'd say an average of $30-$35 for a cocktail, appetizer and entree). The quality is excellent, so it's a good value -- definitely money well spent. The service on my recent visit was quite nice.  Our server was knowledgeable, friendly without being effusive and timed out the meal well.  There is another server there (whose name I sadly don't know/can't recall) who is a hoot (in a really approriate way).  He always adds a certain sassy sparkle to the proceedings without being obtrusive or inappropriate which is something I really appreciate.  After all, a bit of sass can be a very good thing! The space at Jin Ju has a hip, romantic ambience making it a great date spot (plus, it will impress, yet not bust the wallet).  I suppose my only real criticism is that it can get a tad noisy when the restaurant fills up (but that is true most anyplace, I guess).  Also, the little lounge in the back makes a great ""getting to know you"" cocktail spot.   Andersonville had a lot of really great restaurants, but Jin Ju offers that little something different.  It's always a great change of pace!",0.9997,0.669,0.299,0.032,0.5884879406307979

Make a reservation on the weekends.  It seems Koreans prefer beef, although every dish is available as chicken etc... The dishes were hearty and flavorful. Interesting. I had a dish with a bed of rice noodles and slices of beef on top. The beef could have easily been overly seasoned, cooked, parked in a tray... but intead it was fresh, delicate and tender. My new found friend had the Kimche soup and said it was delicious and warm to the bottom. He also had raw beef appetizers, something I like to call land sushi. It was good. Just good.

The martinis, which are a specialty here, are made with Soju, which is apparently an imported Korean spirit. They're good, but very light flavored. My cucumber martini tasted a lot like cucumber-tinged water... which is not really a bad thing--it was very refreshing. The scallion pancake is a great appetizer. We also had a raw beef app that was on special--I don't know if the seasoning is authentic or not, but it sure was delicious. My girlfriend has become a full-on bulgogi addict, and she really liked hers here. It's actually presented with some vegetables, as opposed to being just beef on a plate, like you get at other Korean places. For me, the star of the show was my entree, which was Dolsot Bi Bim Bap. Most of the time, bi bim bap is served with the vegetables cold, so when you mix it up with the hot rice, the whole concoction ends up sort of luke warm. It's good that way, but it's even better if you get the Dolsot version, which is served in a hot stone bowl, so the whole thing keeps warming while you're eating. And the rice bits that stick to the sides get all toasty... MMMM! Anyway, if you're an American who likes Korean food, you'll love it at Jin Ju. And if you're an American who WILL like Korean food, but you haven't tried it yet, go here. It's a great place to start off.",0.9983,0.777,0.217,0.006,0.6103298192322584

One bumpy plane ride, two crying babies, and thirty pounds later I arrive back to DFW... after buying another seat for my ass. We fought for the window seat. This neighb of Chicago reminded me a bit of Brooklyn with it's side streets lined with cute walk-ups and casually dressed peeps with a dab 'o style walkin' the streets. My wonderful dinner companion and I walked in to find two more fabulous ladies to dine with. Hey girls!  You automatically go into relaxed mode when entering this cozy spot. The aroma of spices floods out of the kitchen and locks onto your nostrils, guiding you to an open table. The tables near the front window look like a perfect space to people watch over a flavor-packed meal and a nice glass of red.  I was a bit jealous of my girl's Orange Crush cocktail that she ordered since it looked so damn good. I was pretty happy with my Pear soju though. I followed that with a nice enough glass of a shiraz-cab blend. Here is what I recommend ordering. Actually you may want to order half of this... Cucumber and Crab Salad (Split it to start out a meal. The spicy tangy red pepper vinaigrette has a hint of sesame and peanut sauce in it.) Mandoo Soup (You'll enjoy the mix of dumplings and egg in a yummy broth, comes in a pretty big bowl.) Kim Bop (A large seaweed roll filled with rice, bulgogi, spinach, carrots, yellow pickled radish, fish cake, and egg.) Bi Bim Bop (Rice topped with beef, bean sprouts, spinach, carrots, shitake mushrooms, shredded radish, red leaf lettuce, fried egg, and a spicy red pepper paste sauce to mix in. It's kind of spicy, so just add a bit if ya don't like the heat. Can also be ordered without meat, and err the fried egg was the only thing left in my big bowl. But I don't like fried egg. Eek.) Domi (Lightly battered pan-fried tilapia fillet served with marinated eggplant, portobello mushrooms, and baby carrots in a ginger hot mustard sauce.) We all liked our entrees obviously because we went from enthusiastic chatter boxes to heads stuffed in bowls. I was super full (again) when leaving the restaurant, so I was happy that we had to walk a bit to find the car. It was honestly probably more of a shuffle than a walk though.

Basically, it's accessible and offers what other Korean restaurants do not- friendly and educating staff, clean air that wont leave your clothes smelling like food, and a spacious, well- decorated room. It does come with a price, though. I'd say that it's almost twice as expensive than Cho Sun Ok or San Soo Gab San for the dishes that they do have.

Bi Bim Bap (still fun to say) was tasty.  I had it with brown rice and I can probably say that it is probably the only way to get it.  I'm half Chinese and so I grew up with the Chinese version of this type of food - this was probably just  a really prettied up version with quality ingredients.  I mean, that's what these places are about I guess.  Some dishes that native Koreans probably grew up eating and don't really consider anything special or out of the ordinary - this place with its ambiance and location can attract non-Koreans to try basic Korean dishes done with a little more flair, quality preparation and ingredients.

The food is fresh and attractively presented. The pajun (scallion pancake) is a winner -- I generally get it with squid and mussels. And then there are the sojutinis. Soju is a traditional Korean clear liquor, and they mix it up here in a number of tasty ways. I'm partial to the pear, the ginger, and the cucumber sojutinis. They also have a full bar, and a respectable wine list. This is a good date place. The dining room has two levels, and large windows look out onto Clark Street.

I'm not ashamed to admit that, likely as the result of my sheltered upbringing in the US, I prefer Americanized versions of every cuisine that I've tried.   Italian -- c'mon, don't we all prefer really heavy, bad-for-us American pizzas to those authentic flatbread-based things with some tomato slices and a pinch of oregano?   Chinese -- When you order a chicken dish at PF Changs, aren't you secretly happy that this Americanized version leaves the chicken's foot in the kitchen where it belongs? Korean is no different for me.  I don't know if I've even had authentic Korean food.  I thought that Jin Ju was authentic, but some of the reviews suggested otherwise.  I guess that's why I like it so much! So, if you're willing to come out of the closet as a culinary heathen, then I think you should give Jin Ju's allegedly less-than-authentic food a shot.   The Dak Bulgogi is the can't-go-wrong dish for the inexperienced diner.  Try all of the Soju-tinis.  As far as I can tell, Soju is the hangover-free alcohol that I've been searching for my entire life, and the vegetable tempura appetizer is probably the best that I've had anywhere. **Special tip** Jin Ju apparently decided to take the tempura app off of the menu on the weekends, much to my dismay.  Honestly, I won't even touch the place on weekends now -- the tempura is THAT good. The folks there told me that only one woman knows the secret to making their tempura, and I guess that she doesn't work weekends.  I really hope that this fix this problem sometime soon.",0.948,0.871,0.088,0.041,0.5271645021645021

They accidentally gave our 2nd appetizer to the wrong table so it came out a little late, but they were so nice and apologetic about it that we didn't care.   For our entrees we had a spicy chicken dish (Bok Bulgogi).  This was my boyfriend's favorite part of the meal..  I was busy devouring a special on the menu (can't remember the name....darn martinis) which was Bi Bam Bap, but it had pieces of raw tuna, snapper, other fish, seaweed, etc in it.  I loved it and will definitely be going back for more...apparently they have this special on the menu every weekend.   A few hours and $80 (before tip) later we left the restaurant smelling like Korean food.  We really enjoyed our first Korean food experience and plan on going back again soon.  I loved Jin Ju, but I want to try Solga and San Su Gab San at some point too!",0.9981,0.725,0.243,0.031,0.5206608993843037
