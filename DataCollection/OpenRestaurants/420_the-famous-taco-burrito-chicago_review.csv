Hole in the wall taquerias are my lifeblood.  But.. Should have gone to Taco Bell next door.  Ordered a Burrito Suizo - Red sauce was weirdly sweet, not good. Hardly any cheese on top (which should be a federal offense). Had to drown in salsa and sour cream to make it edible. Pretty sure the burrito was supposed to have other ingredients, but all I saw was meat, tomatoes and like 1 pinto bean.  Side of Chips & Salsa - Also not great, small portion of chips, salsa is a cloudy, weird color and it was pretty bland. Also, I asked for a lengua burrito and the guy said ""we don't have lengua"", but after I ordered I saw it listed on the menu in English - Maybe he doesn't speak Spanish? Who knows.

2006-08-08,4.0,"Once upon a time I worked the graveyard shift and lived nearby. One disadvantage of both my living situation and my schedule was the laundry situation as my landlady didn't allow laundry to be going after 10pm and I was rarely awake or alert enough to start it early enough so I found myself at the 24-hour laundrioteca next to The Taco Burrito King, or Rey del Tacos y de los Burritos for my espanol speaking fans.  They're cheap, I'll give you that. You get that whole ""don't know exactly what I'm eating but hey at least it's not moving oh whoa whoa ok maybe it's moving a little but hey at least it's not singing"" kind of experience. The ""meat"" is typically chunky and fatty, you'll find yourself chewing more gristle than you'd like. The lettuce is a bit soggy, the beans a bit flat but what the hell, man? We're at the Taco Burrito King. Live a little don't worry about the health department so much.  Many a night was spent washing my undesirables and munching on a steak burrito, no tomato or sour cream. Along with this a nice  cool cola and then it was off to desert from the vending machines. Stale 3 Musketeers bar, score!",0.437,0.854,0.075,0.071,0.4650000000000001
