2017-08-27,5.0,"We came for brunch, which is three courses. We sat in one best seats over looking the pond; this is probably likely since we made reservations months in advance and were seat righted when they opened. Since it was birthday they even printed on the menu my name and then gave it to me as a souvenir.  Service: impeccable, I think I drank 2 liters of water just because the waitstaff was so adamant on keeping the glass full. Incredibly knowledgeable staff, very accommodating host staff. Presentation: A+ very manicured and lots of hard work went into preparing and crafting the dishes. The Food was also excellent in taste, I would not recommend the first shrimp course (personal taste in flavor), but also it was exciting just to see what we would be served next, all the while taking in a great view.",0.9342,0.881,0.1,0.019,0.5683333333333332

2017-08-10,5.0,I was so surprised about the bad reviews North Pond has I was ready to tell the manager about a 1 star review when this restaurant has a Michelin star. I was very delighted to have come to this beautiful and romantic restaurant right by the Lincoln Park Zoo.  I was seated at he section that has open windows to contemplate  the beauty of the park.  It also allows the guess to eat al fresco but with out being outside.   The food is very delicious. Everything was delicious.  The only thing I did agree with some of the bad reviews is the meats are NOT throughly cooked.  So if you eating pork and chicken I hesitate to eat it because it is served rare.   I was not asked how I like my meat cooked I so  I did  not eat it because it was rare.  A lot of people also complained about North Pond charging $50 for making reservations.   I agree with North Pond because it has to order food specially made for us and if we do not show up they are stock with unnecessary extra food.  So for those people that love to eat at nice high Michelin restaurant paying $50. Is not a lot.  I loved the service and I love the food. The deserts were so amazing.  I had a wonderful time and specially eating at the open window section.  Thank you big spender I love you.  you made a good choice bringing me to North Pond it is gorgeous and the food is amazing.  The service is great too.,0.9974,0.664,0.274,0.062,0.6889115646258503

The service was impeccable, views were gorgeous (especially when they could open the sides of the restaurant up), and food was delicious.

There was only one dish out of the tasting menu that I remember not enjoying, but somehow I still appreciated it!

Here's the quick story: Called month+ in advance, made a reservation for engagement. Reassured we would get preferential seating in pond room with nice view. When I say engagement, I mean the most important day in our lives after our wedding/child birth. Called 3 days in advance to confirm everything was ok. Was told they can't guarantee anything blah blah... spoke to manager, she gave me a routine monologue. What really stands out is how COLD the manager Natalie was, insensitive and difficult to relate to as I expressed my excitement for our engagement dinner. To management-- perhaps it time for a change.  Showed up for our 8pm reservation at 715, I saw at least 3 tables open up before 8 that were all given away. I pleaded to be sat, it was such a special day for us. Bottom line, we were sat at 830 for our 8 special day. You're an embarrassment to Michelin.

2017-07-23,1.0,"My family came to North Pond to celebrate a special event. Management is unnecessarily rigid. We were not permitted to order one course of the tasting menu a la carte, which was disappointing, but not outrageous. But when one member of our party asked if he could pay for the entire tasting menu, and elect to only receive the single course and waive the rest of the meal that would be fully paid for, the answer was a ""No"" that rolled off the manager Natalie's tongue as if she were born for it. The bottom line is they have the food, we were willing to pay for the food despite not wanting to eat all of it, and she gleefully denied us. Rather than trying to accommodate us, she made efforts to aggravate us, on some sort of power trip. We would like to take this opportunity to remind Natalie that she is but a restaurant manager, and that there are myriad dining options in Chicago which will happily make an effort to give diners an enjoyable experience devoid of confrontation or the word ""No."" Keeping the Chef's ego inflated (even though he was not there on a Saturday night!) is clearly more of a priority for this place than their customers.  Despite this, our waitress Hillary was very professional and pleasant. We did enjoy the food, minus the tasting menu item that was more tightly guarded than the Crown Jewels.  PS - They do not serve name brand alcohol. A request for Grey Goose yielded a ""small batch vodka from Wisconsin"" which was undrinkable.

2017-07-12,5.0,"""Stunning."" The sole adjective that one should ever use to describe the essence of North Pond. Stunning. The exterior views of the pond right outside of the front dining room: stunning. The interior design in all of its rustic splendor: stunning. The art of the plating here: stunning. The flavors of each and every dish that hit my table: stunning. My overall experience was truly, stunning! I visited North Pond solo on a summer Sunday afternoon for brunch. In all honesty I am glad I opted for an earlier reservation because this menu was a delicious and more affordable way to experience the genius of Chef Bruce Sherman and his team.  Although the brunch is advertised as 3 courses, I received two amuse bouche from the chef. To start, I had a dried cranberry and orange scone (housemade of course). The scone itself was dense and dry and perfect as it was supposed to be. Next I had the whole soft-shell crab and avocado mousse with slaw. The crab was absolutely incredible. The shell was soft, flavorful, and crispy as it was lightly fried and you could still taste the oceanic aspect of the crustacean. The avocado mousse and the slaw provided a very nice contrast of acidity and creaminess to the savory crab. Following the crab came my second amuse bouche, a delicious summer soup of carrot and pineapple puree with charred carrot and pineapple with a corn and cucumber salad underneath. For a crunchy element, they placed puffed crispy granules of rice inside. This soup was mind-blowing. I loved how I could blatantly distinguish the difference of each ingredient. The pineapple is my favorite fruit and it was so very fresh and very much so welcomed as a great surprise.  My main entree was the flatiron steak. Phenomenal. The beef was cooked a perfectly medium rare, had amazing flavor (not at all over-seasoned) and when mixed with all of the other components of the dish, it was just an overall perfect taste bite after bite after bite. Finally, came the dessert - one of the most STUNNING desserts I have ever seen. The chocolate was creamy and sweet and paired well with the tart, fresh raspberries and the sprigs of mint leaves presented that fresh taste that quickly cut out most of the heaviness from the mousse and puff pastry. The service here was good. The servers were attentive, and the staff who brought out the dishes were all very informative as well as polite to answer all of my several questions. Out of all the Michelin star rated restaurants in Chicago, North Pond certainly just reached my Top 5 list, and definitely landed a spot on my Top 10 Favorite Restaurants in Chicago.  North Pond should NOT ever be a question. If you are questioning whether or not to stop in...just do it. You will not be disappointed.",0.9988,0.766,0.228,0.006,0.6245912698412697

2017-06-20,5.0,"For the day after my 35th birthday, I apparently decided to turn into an older person.  Despite hearing incredible things about the food at North Pond, I confess I had a hard time getting excited about it, because I feared the food and the atmosphere would be both dated and stuffy. But you know what? I had a really great time. The food ranged from very good to extraordinary. The most extraordinary item was the soup -- a green garlic veloute, served over a bit of fried chicken nuggets (!?), with many other garnishes, including delicious fresh cherries. While I am normally wary of any sweetness or fruits in my savory dishes, a hefty backbone of black pepper gave the soup a spiciness that made it balanced, delicious, addictive. Everything else was very good too, including a salmon dish with mushrooms and a sorrel puree and a so-called open-faced ravioli, which was really a bunch of beautiful vegetables on a large homemade wheat noodle. You get the idea. The other standout item was a little gift at the end -- a perfect little fruit gelee with the intense funkiness of passionfruit and a beautifully creamy texture. They take produce very very seriously here, and you should come and partake. But I will confess that part of my enthusiasm for North Pond came not from the food but from the setting. The service was friendly, attentive, helpful, and patient. (This is not something to be taken for granted in a world of places like The Girl and The Goat.) The building was a beautiful craftsman, with open but cozy spaces and nice little views. The views, of North Pond and the summer enthusiasm of Lincoln Park, were a perfect dash of nature on a city weekday. The word that keeps coming to mind is ""civilized."" There was a time -- in college, of course -- when I was known to loudly and annoyingly insist that the only thing that mattered about a restaurant was the food: not the location, not the service, and certainly not the decor or the atmosphere. People who cared about those frivolities were chumps, not to be taken seriously. I now smile indulgently at that past self.",0.996,0.796,0.184,0.02,0.6925886524822694

But that was not why i was not impressed. The first course (duck liver mouse with ginger bread cookie and rasberry jam like liquid) was too sweet. It was a dessert starter. The next dish the crab subsitute was nothing. Just a piece of crab with a carrott on top. Followed by the scallop (one scallop) which was a good dish. Followed by the beef dish, which was a mini (2 slices) of petite fillet with sweet chutney and sweet onion puree of some sort too. All the notes were hitting sweet and occasionally nutty. The entire set menu is a round of overally sweet purees with nutty flavours. After 4 courses that note gets boring. The dessert was very average .. the red velvet cake on the dish could have passed for a kitchen sponge. Finally, we paid $100 each for the set menu and $20 for a glass of wine each. The price point is higher than MK, naha and blackbird and the food is worse.

I requested a nice table by the window and they did a lovely job with personalizing our menu and gave us a complimentary dessert. Those were the ups.. Now here are the downs....  First of all, we wanted to have a fancy dinner to celebrate the occasion. I was looking for a Michelin Star restaurant downtown. Out of all the places, we liked the neat location of North Pond and their menu seemed promising and diverse, so we picked it. I have to say, their menu is definitely misleading.... When they say ""chicken and waffles"" I honestly can't tell you what was the chicken, and there was no waffle on that plate... Apparently it's waffle batter smeared ...? I mean... totally misleading.  Obviously the portions aren't huge, but none of the plates blew me out of the water. The best thing we had was their pasta dish, and again, it wasn't spectacular...  I have to say, the most disappointing dish was the pheasant. I was really looking forward to trying it because the way it's described in their menu it sounds so delicious and cozy, but the second I tried those dehydrated olives on the plate.... The first word that came to mind was ""Eww."" I can't believe I said ""eww"" to a dish at a Michelin Star restaurant...  I guess we can chalk this up to being ""too fancy"" for us. We are definitely people that like to indulge on expensive and fancy meals, but this was just over the top and not appealing from start to finish.",0.9822,0.818,0.142,0.04,0.6162202380952382

Preparation was so-so, and as beets have the highest sugar content of all vegetables, most people can only safely eat beet a few times a week. I think I got a year's worth. I had a ""steak"" that looked awfully like a roast cut; only satisfactory part of the meal. Those who had the fish described it as gelatinous. I can't really remember the fruit plate to even call it memorable (good or bad). Wine pairing...perhaps ""barnyard"" is okay (even preferred) with some meals, these barnyard aromas and texture were like chicken manure or horse sweat. Yuck.

It was light and sugar-filled, everything nice~ I started my brunch with the Eggs, Bacon course - A sunny side up hen egg, maple pork belly, maitake mushrooms, sourdough foam, spinach & strawberries - Loved this! Every element was delicious on it's own and together they made a sweet medley of ingredients.  For my main I had the Whitefish, Pasta option but now that I think about it...there wasn't really any pasta to speak of! Ha! The pan seared whitefish was atop roasted carrots, white pesto and almonds. Enjoyed this course almost as much as the first course! But wasn't quite there for me.  Dessert was Apple, Pecan which was a change for me as I'm a chocoholic. This dish just sounded sooooo~ good though! Caramel cremeux, apple butter, pecan feuilletine, granny smith sorbet and sugar. A lot of sugar. This was to die for! I had a bit of my friend's tea & citrus dessert as well and it was good - but couldn't compete with the apple & pecan!

Perhaps our expectations for North Pond were too high and much too influenced by the elegant setting, but my boyfriend and I were not blown away by the food.  The dishes were all beautifully plated, but the flavors weren't anything special.  My boyfriend chose a red meat-heavy menu, and he really was not too impressed.  I guess there is only so much that you can do with bacon and sausage for breakfast/brunch options.  His meal was not too different from what you can get for half the price at the small, local, farm-to-table places.   Would I go again?  Probably not, but if you are looking for a low-key yet elegant brunch, then North Pond might for you.  Especially if you want to splurge a bit for a special occasion.  The service is friendly.  The dress code is casual at brunch, and it is definitely family-friendly in the early hours.",0.9866,0.809,0.163,0.028,0.535203373015873

2015-12-20,4.0,"My second to last Chicago Michelin starred restaurant to check out and I'm glad I finally made it here. However, despite a wonderfully enjoyable meal, this isn't a Michelin caliber place to me.  Very cool location in the middle of the park, but when its cold its not a fun place to access or catch a cab home from.   I wasn't a fan of the confirmation call as they made a very big deal of being on time, and if I'm not closing the kitchen since I was the last reservation of the night.  From my point of you view, if you want to close the kitchen set earlier reservations, don't bother me about my experience. Upon arriving they quickly checked our coats and sat us.  Then we waited almost 10 minutes with only a drink menu before a server came.  It's really hard to plan what I want to drink without seeing the food menu to determine what I want to eat or if you are doing the tasting menu. So this is a fail as you're 20 minutes before anything gets ordered. When the server finally got there she was super friendly but I had a few major problems. First of all, she told us that the 5 course tasting menu takes 2-3 hours.  At 9 o'clock, I'm guessing that was a cheeky way to discourage people from doing it.  How in the world could 5 courses take 3 hours?  Secondly, being it my first time there I really wanted some solid suggestions.  She refused to do so either from training or ignorance, but she didn't provide any guidance at all as to what to eat. All she would tell us was, what new items were, as if that somehow has guidance to anything.  She might as well said, ""here are the popular items"", another pointless saying, who cares what the masses eat, I want the good stuff. Bottom line, have an opinion please.  The seasonal tasting menu looked rather boring and not wanting to wait 3 hours, we opted for the regular menu. After ordering things got exponentially better as the food came fast and was excellent. I started off the foie gras, which was great, as most foie is. They gave the biggest piece I've seen outside of Paris for a very reasonable $18.  I didn't get much ginger at all, but the bourbon apple sauce paired perfectly with the foie. My wife started with the squash and crab, this was a boring miss.   For my second course I got the charcuterie. Another great value for the amount of food for $20, and again it was one of the better charcuterie I've had.  The jowl pastrami was killer, huge portion size, this dish is meant to be shared. My wife got the beat salad, the pumpernickle crumble was a revelation. Awesome dish.   For my main I had the pheasant. It was pretty good but overall didn't excite to much as it was very straightforward.  My wife's grassfed beef stood out, especially combined with the spaetzle.   We skipped desert, as nothing stood out to me.   Rocky start, soso service, but great simple food with big portions.  I'd come back to North Pond on a regular basis, but the food just isn't elevated to the top to me, but more approachable hearty french food.",0.9955,0.763,0.162,0.075,0.49112421180969573

You can`t really park at the restaurant but you can easily find the spot either on N Stockton Dr or N Cannon Dr. The place has an interesting decor for the place with an old history that goes back to 1900`s when it was used as a skating shelter. The restaurant welcomed us with candles placed at the front giving it a great ambience. The place does not have many sittings so reservations are highly recommended and they fill up way ahead in advance. We started with drink which were done superbly as they use small batch alcohols for their drinks. I had Old Fashioned and my wife took Journeyman Rum-they add lightly burned rosemary sprig on the end which gives it nice aromatic burst. It was my wife birthday so they gave us menus with her name on it which was a very surprising gift :) and we could keep it. We started with bottle of white wine as an accompaniment to our food, the list is short and prices are a bit on the high side and starts from about $52 and up for whites.  You have to start with Foie  Gras --it is delicious but for me a little bit too many sweet elements, and my wife said it was her best ever. Salads were very fresh and Chef Bruce Sherman inspect every dish before it hits the floor so it is perfectly decorated and has a balance when it comes to taste. We ordered pheasant and lamb for main dishes and it was harmony of taste as both were very delicious.

The chef here is incredibly creative and talented. Service was good, and they did inscribe ""Happy Birthday (name)"" on the menu, which was very nice.  Unfortunately the hostess and management skills are nowhere near that same level of quality. I made reservations several days ahead of time and mentioned it was for my mother-in-law's birthday celebration when they called to confirm. We were seated in a back corner by the restrooms, which was disappointing enough when you have made reservations at a place known for its view of the park, and have also mentioned it was a special occasion, and even gushed to the person who called to confirm about how excited you are to come for the first time, etc. But when a LARGE group of children was seated right beside us and was loud and running around the table, that really ruined the experience.  I realize the staff obviously has no control of other people's lack of parenting skills, but you do have control over planning where you seat guests when almost all parties no doubt have reservations. You also do have a choice in whether you enforce your dress code, which they definitely do not here. And you certainly have the choice to stop people who are coming in from their walk around the park just to use your restroom.   It was just really disappointing to research restaurants for a special occasion meal and purposely choose a place for its purported view, upscale ambiance, and food quality and then only have one of those be true. Really took the ""special"" out of the special occasion. And most unfortunately, when my husband asked to speak to the manager about it, she was unapologetic, defensive, and said it was a ""family place for brunch."" So bottom line, if you want to have an upscale $35+ per person dress-up brunch with a view, go elsewhere or maybe be very specific about seating preferences.

Natalie Labun:  Please pay attention to your reviews.  The problem with some restaurants with chef owners is that they get entirely too wrapped up in their art, or their rating as a chef and forget about their customers.  They disregard the feelings of their patrons and this is passed on to the manager.   North Pond's greatest asset is its location, not necessarily the gourmet food.  Do not deny patrons their desire to be seated where they have a view of the pond/Lincoln Park.  This is a huge mistake currently being made by your restaurant.    Many of the complaints have to do with initial treatment of customers and the handling of seating.   Your front of the house manager/staff is the main reason for this one star rating.  Why?  Because the treatment of customers upon arrival is crucial and North Pond fails miserably.   My complaint is not much different from others that I have read about this same issue, however I wish I had read them prior to going to this restaurant.  North Pond is very expensive,  and the level of service from the moment of entry by customers into the restaurant should be of a high quality.  This did not happen.   We made our reservation over 10 days in advance for a birthday celebration.  We specifically asked to be seated with a view of the ""pond,""  which was on a  weekday early evening.  The restaurant was not busy, just a few tables of 2 or 3.  We arrived on time,  and were told by the management that there were no tables available for our party of four in the front area of the restaurant which had the view, even though there were two empty tables for six.   We were told that seating was on a first come first seated basis, even though we pointed out that we had a reservation that specifically requested a view.  We also pointed out to the manager that there were two tables in the front section for  six.  She said that this was for ""larger"" parties who might come in and so that needed to be saved in case this happens.  Please note:  those table were not reserved.  As far as I could tell, those tables were never filled for the duration of the time that we were there, which was about 2 1/2 hrs.   We were led into the main dining room,  and seated in a dark area with no view whatsoever except of the kitchen.   The attitude of the manager is what set the tone in a negative way.  Had she been nicer, and more willing to accommodate our family for this special celebration, this being on a weekday early evening around 6pm, this would have made all of the difference to us.  Management needs to change this system, if indeed it is their policy to ignore reservations and reservation requests.  Otherwise, this manager should really be fired,  because as someone said, it is one thing to aspire to be a high end restaurant, but when the front-of-the-house treats the customers as if they looking to be seated in a diner, it is unacceptable.  We were shuffled to a booth in a dark corner to the left part of the interior dining room,  and behind the front-of-the-house podium,  in front of the kitchen with a clear view of the comings and goings of wait staff and workers in the kitchen.  As many frequent diners would agree, this is probably the worst location in a restaurant.  The level of service from our server was top notch.  The food was interesting and beautifully presented.  However, the initial experience that we had  via the manager, regarding getting the seating we desired was more than disappointing. I doubt that we will return anytime soon unless we find out that this has changed, and I certainly cannot recommend this restaurant at this time. At a cost of over $530 for four people, we expect more.",-0.4654,0.866,0.065,0.068,0.4929904761904762
2015-08-03,4.0,"Went here to celebrate with family.  First of all, best Valet Parker in Chicago.  He seemed to be working alone but was so quick and with it.  It's a crowded corner on a busy summer weekend but he directs traffic, parks cars and smiles simultaneously.  The setting is gorgeous on a summer evening.  Despite being in the main dining room without a view, the walk up to the restaurant and the Art Nouveau decor make up for it.  Great place for family photos with the pond and skyline in the background. Also, the tables are nicely spaced and the noise level was conversation friendly.   We ordered the special cocktails. We asked our server which drink was not too sweet.  The lemony one we chose was way overly sweet. The other flavors were not discernible. Also, drink service was really slow.  20 minutes for 3 cocktails and a soda?  And forgetting the soda? Had to ask twice where it was.  The food was really good.  The chef must be on his middle eastern kick with the use of feta, apricots, melon, pistachios.  As a former resident of Israel, I loved it. Everyone loved the food, even our picky 18 year old.  My yellowtail was outstanding. The sweet spicy mix on the melon lettuce tabbouleh was delicious. Our server was meh. She answered questions perfunctorily and was rarely seen. The hostess was much more attentive and welcoming, bringing an amuse bouche and truffles and checking up on us during the meal.  Back to the Valet who handled a big group with several cars and us with alacrity . My cousin said he must have his PhD.  Definitely a special place and a great place to bring out of town guests.  Wear comfy shoes and you can stroll through the park after dinner.

2015-08-02,1.0,"By far one of the most disappointing dining experiences in Chicago. The restaurant came highly recommended and so it was an obvious choice for date night.  The service was decent - our waiter was attentive, but the wait for each course, including the drinks was uncomfortably lengthy. There were several times throughout dinner where we found ourselves sitting at an empty table for 15+ minutes at a time.    The food was not edible. I ordered the carrot, crab appetizer which came out with a beautiful presentation and looked appetizing. I cut into it in and a gray liquid came out. I proceeded to try and eat it, but it reeked of the fishy/seaweed smell. I sent the dish back in hopes of better luck with the main course. I had initially ordered the potato-crusted sea bass, but was informed that the restaurant ran out, and was instead talked into a potato-crusted mahi. When that arrived, again, beautiful presentation, but it had the most unbearable fishy smell. I tried a little piece, but it was just not something I was willing to consume.  I ate the boiled baby potatoes that came with it and called it a night. The bill was hefty, the experience was sub par and the food was not edible. I walked out hungry, and will not be coming back.",0.9032,0.835,0.102,0.063,0.545

2015-07-15,4.0,"I'd like to start by mentioning the fact that I've given this place an extra star just for the server and pastry chef. My husband and I went to start my birthday with a brunch at North Pond.  The location is amazing undoubtedly. At the end of the experience, we were given our personalized menu and a page talking about the history of the place.  We were at the restaurant 10 mins before our reservation and in spite of the restaurant being empty, we were made to wait about 20 mins. I understand the 10 min wait but not the extra 10 mins.  Moving on, we weren't given a choice of where to sit. Again, we should have asked but after a 20 mins. of wait, we were fine sitting anywhere.  Our server was really nice. He got us custom menus printed with ""Happy Birthday"" - I do wish it had my name but nevertheless, it was a much welcomed.  For the food,  Lamb - Better than the average! The lamb was cooked absolutely right but it was too bland. Chicken - Egg was poached perfectly. I wish the fried chicken was served somehow different. For the first course, the presentation does matter a lot. Whitefish - To me that was totally overcooked. Additionally, I think it could have been better without Broccoli. I loved the use of rice. The peanut sauce was well thought of. Pork - Under - cooked and not prepared well. Couldn't taste the bourbon. Loved the combination of jam and garlic. Tartelett - Absolutely brilliant! Pistachios had such a brilliant texture and added just the right taste to the Raspberry Sorbet. Pudding - Again, brilliant! The compote and olive oil ice cream were an amazing pair.  Price - Couldn't be better. Parking - Not the best experience. We followed the open table email and found the guy in the right place. My only complain is for our host. He didn't inform the parking guy to get our car back. Ambiance - The inside room is pretty dark and definitely not a Michelin star. Also, since we were next to the kitchen, it wasn't a pleasant experience hearing what all people are ordering. Dressing - The place requests people to not wear flip flops or shorts but that certainly wasn't the case with 70% of the crowd. Looking forward to giving it another try - may be for the dinner.",0.9981,0.749,0.215,0.036,0.6272283272283271
2015-07-06,4.0,"Probably one of my best dining experiences ever. My partner took me for a special treat. The whole ambiance was very vintage romantic. The place is well designed with gorgeous wood trim all over. It's nice and dark giving it that mellow romantic mood. There's another ""sun room"" that gives off more of a brunch vibe. At first they sat us in that room, and we asked to be moved to the other side where it seemed more romantic with the dim lighting. They did so without any hesitation. It looks as if they re-renovated an old out house - you know the one's you see a long the drive/beach. Pretty cool, I think I overheard another waiter explaining that.  Our server was nice and attentive. The menu was kind of small and I was told the portions are small sized so I decided to order a soup (shrimp, potato) which was really good. I think I might have ate a flower, but it was a bit spicy so I had to keep reaching for that delicious bread! Yum! Then I ordered a egg/lobster salad with semi-boiled egg with bacon bits. It was very delicious. All in all, everything filled me up. The portion sizes were perfect. I forgot to mention I ordered a glass of pinot grigio too.  For dessert, we ordered strawberry/fennel which was a flourless chocolate cake with pecans. I don't like fennel so we asked if we could go without it. The waiter seemed hesitant at first to not disappoint the chef, but in the end they made the accommodation for us. :-) It was well worth it, at least I enjoyed every bit of it. Although, I think they snuck one piece in there!  Bonus was we were served two complimentary items: one was a sample main dish (forgot what it was) and the other was a delicious chocolate dessert.  The thing that made this place stand a part from other restaurants was definitely the exceptional service. What looked like the manager would come around to ask us if everything was okay and if we needed anything along with our waiter doing the same, but it wasn't overbearing either.  Lastly, the view of the Lincoln Park pond was beautiful. Although, in the romantic room you couldn't see it, but we stopped by afterwards and took a romantic walk in the park. This is a little hidden gem located near a LP lagoon! Perfect especially for a special occasion.  It is on the expensive side, but like I said the price is right for a special occasion.",0.9981,0.753,0.22,0.027,0.5866071428571428

2015-06-09,3.0,"If the rest of the staff was on the same level as the kitchen there is no question this restaurant would have received a 5-star review.   While our server was great, her support staff and front of the house management leaves a ton to be desired.  Our experience wasn't as frustrating as others have indicated in their reviews but there is certainly a trend that can't be ignored. Having read the other reviews and wanting to take guest from out of town who would be celebrating a special occasion I booked a reservation weeks in advance.  When they called to confirm the reservation, the day before, I reminded the person confirming we'd like a table with a view, as our guests were from out of town.  The person from North Pond said, to paraphrase; 'not a problem at all.  I'll note it in your reservation and we look forward to seeing you tomorrow night!' Fast forward to being seated at an oddly shaped table just behind the host stand with a clear view of the kitchen door, restroom, backroom of restaurant and food line only.  The hostess did nothing to acknowledge my request to be moved to a table with a view, so we ask for the manager.  Manager comes over and proceeds to tell us every table 'is on a first come, first serve basis'.  What is the point of a reservation then?  What is the point of taking a note in said reservation?  I mean you aren't OCB.  Not only did she say there is nothing they could do.  She also implied that I was completely lying when I communicated what her co-worker had said to me about 24 hours previously by stating, again to paraphrase; 'We would never say that.'.  You did and then you called me a liar when I expected you to provide what you committed to. Total failure on her part to a) address my valid concern and discrepancy between what her staff communicated and they provided in the way of a table and b) attempt to resolve a legitimate request even if the request couldn't actually be accommodated exactly as requested.  By insinuating that I was lying when I said her co-worker had confirmed he would make sure we had a view, she put a bad taste in our mouths before we even had our first bite.  If you are serving fine dining food and attempting to cultivate a fine dining experience you can't have Diner level management staff to interact with customers.   Jeez, it took this long to get to the food.  Not a good sign.   However, the food was amazing.  Everything was of extremely high caliber.  They present a seasonal menu and execute perfectly.  There was a tasting menu that looked great but we didn't participate.  The general menu is brief but I'm certain I would have been happy with anything I ordered.  Each of us ordered a different first course so we pretty much covered everything but the soup they had.  My lady and I shared a second course.  For entrees, again we each ordered something different or four different dishes out of the seven or eight that were available. My rabbit dish was top notch.  The level of sophistication and complexity was unexpected but really appreciated.  This is where I think there is an issue with the Food Runners.  They don't explain the dish, how it's prepared or what is what on the plate.  All of the kitchen's efforts to present unique, complex flavors and presentation are wasted by not taking a few extra seconds to highlight the main points of the dish and the preparation.  My rabbit dish was so unique I honestly thought I had received the wrong plate.  A tasty plate but until our actual server came by and explained the dish and how it was prepared I wasn't sure. She did an amazing job.  If it was just her and the Chef this review would have been just a few words comprising of, 'Check out this little hidden gem in the heart of Lincoln Park.'.  Sadly, due to the high-end fare and questionable execution by the front of the house I'm not sure I'd be too keen to suggest this place to other.  Especially those who only go out to this sort of restaurant once or twice a year for special occasions.   I would be worried the experience would be a disappointment. For avid diners looking for a unique experience with amazing food, who are comfortable overlooking some of the finer touches that should be by default be a part of this dining experience, you should go.  For those looking to have a perfect special occasion dinner you may want to think twice about booking a reservation here.",0.9982,0.785,0.161,0.054,0.5650163690476189

2015-05-04,5.0,"First of all, our server Nicholas was knowdgeable and a around delightful. He made the experience 10x better - he took the time to explain describe so many things on the menu to us. I  took my fiancée here for his birthday/our anniversary of the night we met. We started off with amazing concoctions from the bar.. Highly recommend their egg white whiskey sour (sounds way different than it tastes), and an extensive list of wines.  When we were seated, we were delighted to discover that our menu had been customized for our occasion.. The title read ""Happy Anniversary,"" and then our names. We are keeping this as a memento for sure. The Foie Gras was excellently prepared & I wish I'd ordered two of them. The charcuterie salad is not a salad whatsoever, but a charcuterie board of a variety of meats & spreads. It was perfect to share between the two of us.  I ordered the rabbit rhubarb entree which was equally delectable as the first two courses, and my fiancée ordered the Grassfed Beef (NY Strip Medallions) which he looooovved.  For desert it was a difficult decision because so many of them looked great, but our server took the time to explain all of them so we chose the cheese creme brûlée (different/more savory than a regular creme brûlée). The desert also came with a cheese board and different fruit spreads. It was truly an amazing meal. Very romantic looking over the pond, I wish the weather had cooperated so we could sit outside. But beautiful nonetheless. The building is done in a frank Lloyd wright style of architecture, linear & natural feeling, very Art Deco. A wonderful piece of Chicago history - built almost 100 years ago as a warming hut for ice skaters. We will be back, we loved it so much.

2015-04-28,5.0,"O.M.G. I want to rewind to Sunday morning and eat North Pond's brunch all over again. My husband and I went to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary and it could not have been a better experience. Among the ""nicer"" Sunday brunch options in Chicago, we chose North Pond due to its location and view as well as the chef's/restaurant's wonderful reputation. We were seated at a table in the very airy and bright room facing the actual pond. Definitely make a request for a table in there, if you can. Our server brought over two glasses of sparkling rose (which my husband sneakily called ahead to request) as well as custom menus printed with our names and anniversary greeting. The menu is not for your average pancake and eggs brunch. It's a 3 course ordeal (for $34) with 4 different and delicious-sounding options in each section. We had:  An amuse-bouche of coffee cake Egg and asparagus--what a great starter! Flavorful, but not heavy so you don't fill up before your main. I particularly liked the pork-mushroom gallette.  Shrimp and rice--I had a bite of my husband's starter and was really impressed. I'm iffy on shrimp, but this was so well cooked.  Arctic char--aside from seafood restaurants on a coast, this was my favorite seafood entree to date. The fish was cooked perfectly, didn't have a ""fishy"" aftertaste, and the accompanying sauce really complemented it.  Beef--again, only had a bite to taste, but the meat was very tender and the radish pickle a nice flavor addition.  Banana pecan--mini churros and chai ice cream...need I say more? This was actually not my favorite of the 2 desserts we chose, but that's because I am not big on sweets. If you are a regular dessert eater, you will love this.  Macadamia passion fruit--what I wish I had ordered for myself! Loved everything about the flavors, could have done without the toasted marshmallow, but, again, that's just personal sweetness preference.  I also ordered the vodka brunch cocktail. If you don't like ginger, you'll probably hate it. I really liked it and it is deceivingly strong--the ginger and kumquat flavors really mask the vodka in there! Presentation of the dishes was nicely done, the staff were all extremely friendly, and I think the price is a bargain for the quality and amount of food you are getting. We easily found free parking on Cannon Dr at 11:30 on a Sunday (though if you go during warmer months, it could be a bit harder). Decor is a little old school, but what you might expect. The building has a neat history (it was a warming shelter for ice skaters in the early 1900s), which we learned when we were given an envelope with a copy of our personalized menu as well as a sheet all about the restaurant and space.  I don't see North Pond becoming anyone's regular brunch spot, but it is a great option for special occasions or if you want to take your out of town guests somewhere nice.

The restaurant itself is right by the pond that gets a relatively nice view of the Chicago skyline.  Now onto the food. My friends and I came here for their brunch that's three courses with a few options in each. I got the gulf shrimp and rice, pork and squash and the banana cheesecake with pecan. The dishes were very nicely presented and had good flavors and textures but the portion sizes were a little small. I ended up liking the dessert the most because I love cheesecake and the chai ice cream that came with it was delicious (really hope it becomes a common flavor of ice cream in the near future).  However, one of my friends was vegetarian and ended up not having much of a choice in terms of dishes since they only offered one dish for the 1st and 2nd courses that they could change to being vegetarian friendly. He said he ended up really liked the dishes but it still puts a damper on the mood when one is unable to have a choice in food.

There is only 7 or 8 stools but we did not have a problem in sitting our party of 4. I would think in the summer it could get crowded.  Atmosphere:  the restaurant is located in a small building in a small pond/lake in a small park.

It was a cold evening so outdoor seating was not an option but in the summer it would be beautiful. The indoors is dark wood with well spaces tables. The lighting is subdued. It was not crowded the night we were there so the noise level was low. I could see it getting noisy if the restaurant was full.  Wine List:  the wine selection did not contain anything we were familiar with. We chose to do the tasting menu with wine pairings so we did not have to choose. The waiter was very familiar with the wines and could help with a choice if needed.  Menu:  the menu is not epic but have very nice choices.

About 3 tablespoons worth of different things. Idea: add a little handful of spinach or other greens because each element of those 3 tablespoons was so intense it was nearly jarring. It needed PAUSE. Then the duck. Again: a heart attack of intensity. I washed it all down with wine and bread but in the end what I had was heartburn, lol. The dessert menu was a bizarre amalgamation of fantasy components but I was too worn down to sift through it, it was completely overwhelming. The waiter brought by a few chocolate truffles... You'll never, ever have a finer truffle. If these guys get it together you will have to make a reservation a year in advance.",-0.0247,0.869,0.065,0.066,0.5042283950617285

I loved walking up along and through Lincoln Park passing the pond to get to this restaurant (so much pretty nature -- passed baby geese along the way!) .  Food was delicious (locally-sourced), the view was amazing (it overlooks a pond and you can see the city skyline), charming ambiance, and service was friendly. They even made tasty (inexpensive) mocktails for us.  To understand the character of the restaurant, the space was originally built in 1912 as a warming hut for ice-skaters on the pond, currently redesigned with a nod to Frank Lloyd Wright.

The food here is everything you expect from a Michelin caliber restaurant - thoughtful, well composed and visually stunning.  The wife and I both had the seasonal tasting menu while my 8 year old opted for the rabbit entree and dessert.  i'm not going to break down all the dishes, but I will say that when you start with foie as an amuse, you know it's going to be a good night.  My daughter's rabbit dish was sublime, it had three different preparations of the protein with a delicious sauce.  The tasting menu was nothing to sneeze at, but the highlight was definitely the hay steamed poussin.  The bird had just the slightest hint of game and it was perfectly juicy and tender.  The accompanied pearl potatoes and alfalfa espuma were a match made in heaven.  Also, the bird is first brought out in its entirety for inspection.  It is then taken in the back to be carved and plated.  My daughter loved this dish so much that they actually made her a third plate for her to personally enjoy.  Now that is above and beyond. Now, the only downer of the night was when all was said and done, we needed a cab to get back to our hotel.  We were told to walk through the park to valet stand where one could be hailed.  Well, it was getting rather late and the valet guy was closing up.  He was unhelpful in getting a cab and we ended up walking quite a ways to get to a major street with taxi traffic.",0.9961,0.822,0.178,0.0,0.5024014336917563

For mains we ordered: The Pheasant and the Beef. The pheasant was amazing, cooked perfectly and everything on the plate complemented it well except the bratwurst. I didn't think the flavour or texture of the sausage matched well with the rest of the components. For the beef the medallion was better than the short rib both were excellent the sweet potato dumplings had very little flavour and acted as chewy tasteless globs. No a fan, maybe would have enjoyed them if they were seasoned in some way. The cocktail was great and we had two half bottles of wine both were well matched to our meal.

On a chilly late Fall evening, we welcomed getting the seat nearest the fireplace in the desirable front room. Service was cheerful and attentive throughout the nearly three hour dining marathon. Each course was substantial on its own--none of that two-bites-and-your-done stuff here--without being overbearing. The final meat course, of lamb loin chop and shoulder, delivered just the right level of fullness, while still leaving a bit of room for the dessert. Wine pairings were unusual; the sommellier took obvious pleasure in describing each bottle. The amounts poured were plenty generous. The room was very comfortable. Tables are spaced well apart; there's no feeling of being crowded. Some music was playing, but so softly that conversation was not affected. Lighting is subdued; not a problem for eating but a bit frustrating in that the beautiful food arrangements could not be fully appreciated.  The only misses of the evening were minor. When we first arrived, the staff was still getting up to speed; I ordered a beer to kill time. It was an OK pils from Colorado, for seven bucks it was a can I could have done without, especially with six glasses of wine in my future.

2014-09-20,2.0,"Been there. Done that and I have the Tshirt.  It is an adorable place with long wood windows facing the pond, dim lighting and lots of wood every where else. Cute. Real cute, with a cute story. But, no cigar. Cute does not cut it. Never did. Never will. I get the value of a Michelin star. I really do. But once you get beyond the stars, substance and overall sustainability is important.  North Pond is nothing more than an average meal that you could easily get at most tasting menu places in the city minus the snobby staff person, undesirable view and typical pricing.   In sum, I left North Pond disappointed about most things. It was not worth the time or money. ($135 per person price tag before gratuity.)  Location The restaurant sits directly in Lincoln Park across from a pond. In the early 1900s, the building was used to warm ice skaters.  Cute location. Getting There (Parking & Transportation) The Open Table email tells you valet is offered at the intersection of Lakeview and Deming. The person who called to confirm the reservation did not note anything different. After getting to the address with no hint of a sidewalk, we called the restaurant and were told valet parking is actually on Stockon and if you get dropped off at the actual address on Cannon Dr., per the restaurant, it is their service entrance. .....We were instructed to have a taxi drop us off at Lakeview and Deming and to walk over the hill. We hiked the hill in heels which quickly became covered with mud. Upon a departure, we were guided to the walking path which ends at a gazebo. We were told a taxi is waiting, only to arrive at the gazebo with no taxi in sight. We crossed the street and walked down the hill to get back to Lakeview and Deming in hopes of a passing cab. Once one approached, the valet guy magically appeared to open the door and collect his tip for a less than stellar performance. Unbelieveable.  Reservations Not worth a wooden nickel. Reservations are  encouraged but you do not receive any material benefit. We made reservations 8 weeks out only to be seated a short glance away from the kitchen and wait staff standing area. Do we have to watch these folks polish silverware and chat it up?  We would rather a better view or none at all. What happened to a great view???? ""Uh, the seats with great views of the park or pond are first come, first serve with no regard for reservation."" WTH?!! Yes, there are empty tables near the water but we have a place for your party right ""here"". Watch our workers all night and we cannot believe you are not happy with such a view.  Food & Wine Pairing  The five course meal for $90 with ""2"" additional courses courtesy of the chef were not memorable. Cute, nicely done and larger than normal portions but it was typical restaurant creations completely incapable of competing with other Chicago Michelin star restaurants I have tried.  IMO, the $45 wine pairing was the real treat. The wines were great with the dishes but great stand alone wines as well. I  enjoyed 3 of the 5 pairings (Rose, Vouvray & Ice Wine) enough to order them or buy them some time. Interestingly, the pairings are not sold by the glass at North Pond. If you are curious about the pour, you receive about 2.5 ounces of wine.  Service  Our waiter was very personable and the most memorable part of the dining experience.  She checked on us regularly and offered plenty of tidbits throughout the 2.5 hour dining experience.   Our hostess was a total snob and had the audacity to become visibly annoyed when we asked about seating with a view. We decided to make the best of our cash register and waiter's stand view, but having tried the very best their menu offers, we seriously wish we had left after the initial snarl we received.",0.9967,0.802,0.14,0.058,0.5275623023699946

I've had North Pond in my bookmarks since 12/25/2009, so it took me a long time to get here, but I finally made it! What a beautiful setting for a restaurant, nestled in the middle of the lush beauty of Lincoln Park, this Prairie-inspired building blends seamlessly into its surroundings and offers beautiful pond and city views. Valet parking is off of Stockton and follow the winding road to the restaurant. Do be sure to ask for a table by the windows as the interior room is a bit dark and gloomy.  Service is professional and prompt. The menu is seasonal and offers a variety of fish, duck and other meats. Not a large selection of plates, but a few thoughtfully prepared ones. I had the grilled wild striped bass with green and gold zucchini and grilled nectarine. The piece of fish was rather small for the price of the plate. The fish was cooked and flavored perfectly, the squash went well with the fish and the nectarine added a delightful sweetness to the dish, but I didn't like the overwhelming flavor of curry in the sauce, it just overpowered the dish and made everything taste bitter. Too many competing elements in the dish, I would've preferred a simpler but more harmonious pairing of flavors. Same with the beet salad, probably the worst beet salad I've had I'm sad to say, I don't know what was going on with that dish--white, red and chioggia beets (none of which tasted sweet), kampachi, smoked char, pickle slices, rye crumble, fennel foam, mizuna--just too many weird competing ingredients on that dish and none of it went well together, very disappointed with the salad. My companion had the duck with candied carrots, which was good, I'm just not a fan of things cooked rare, it just grosses me out, and the duck came medium rare. The complimentary amuse bouche (rabbit) was good. We opted out of dessert, but since it was my birthday, the waitress brought us two bites of unsweetened dark chocolate and sugar coated candy, with a birthday candle and happy birthday written on the plate in chocolate, which was really nice and thoughtful! Another thoughtful touch was the special printed menus we received that had ""Happy Birthday Mahsa"" printed on them! So cute and what a nice personal touch. We got to take the page home, our waitress put it in an envelope and gave to me as a keepsake. The ambiance here is warm, inviting and romantic. A lovely little escape. I would recommend North Pond for special occasions as it is definitely pricey, coffee is $8 a piece!

But it's probable that I wouldn't have been looking around much--either inside or outside--once the food began to arrive.  The menu is inventive and intriguing, leading to some difficult decisions.  Everything was wonderful, from cocktail and amuse bouche to dessert, but I particularly enjoyed my salad and entree.  The former featured beet greens; red, gold, and chioggia beets; pastrami; sour cream panna cotta; rye crumbles; and quail egg halves.  Heavenly.  The main course was equally delirious:  striploin steak medallions, beef short rib, beech mushrooms, onions, confit potatoes, and pistachios, with a mushroom ""pudding"" topped with a dab of bone marrow butter.  Delicious beyond description. Dessert was a slight step down from the first two courses, but still very good.  We chose the ""coconut and milk"" option, consisting of toasted coconut cake, milk chocolate custard, scalded milk gelato, white chocolate, almonds, and ancho cream.  Mmm mmm. This would have been a hands-down five-star experience, but the service did not match the comfort and luxury of the food and setting.  Our young waiter was awkward but professional and attentive.  However, I frequently overheard an older female server at nearby tables giving the kind of warm, expert service which we would have appreciated.  Just luck of the draw, I guess.  Our interactions with the valet staff were not ideal either.  When we arrived, we waited several minutes for the lone attendant to return from wherever he was.  Upon leaving, we didn't mind waiting a few minutes for the car, but we could see it parked directly across the street squeezed like a sardine into a row with other valet cars.  To the valet's credit, he was able to extract the vehicle without bumping the adjacent vehicles.  This time.  Then they were kind of aggressive about asking how much change we wanted back, i.e. ""How much you wanna tip us, lady?""  Not the smoothest or most gracious close to our otherwise lovely experience. I still recommend North Pond for any romantic special occasion.  Inside versus outside view doesn't matter when the food is this good.  Perhaps it's ideal to visit in winter and enjoy the decor but to get a window seat in fall and spring.",0.996,0.774,0.168,0.058,0.4424730158730159
2014-06-05,2.0,"Appalling attitude, decent food. Vegetarians not welcome. My group was lured here on a business trip by the locally sourced ethos, positive reviews, and recent Michelin star. We were very excited for the opportunity but were grimly disappointed. To make a long story short, they do not make accommodations for vegetarians, and they will bar other members of the party from having their tasting menu if a vegetarian is present. They were rigid to the point of absurdity about this. At one point, the manager actually said that the chef would be okay with serving the vegetarians at one table and doing a tasting menu for everyone else at another table but would not do so if we sat together. This kind of self-important rigidity is not acceptable at a high end restaurant. Also, the food that we had was good but not impressive. My lamb was served cool with no crispy crust. My friend's fish was at room temperature. The macarons with dessert were squishy with no hint of the classic crusty pop on the surface. The desserts were visually appealing, and there were a few high points, like a little pocket of lightly pickled veggie ""relish"" hidden along my lamb. The aspiration is clearly there, but the performance was not as expected, even after discounting our profound disappointment in the treatment of our group. In a city with so many fine dining options, I cannot recommend coming to a place with an attitude like this, particularly with so-so production values. Perhaps the chef will realize that restaurants are about serving customers, not himself, during the time he has to ponder all of those empty tables. **VEGETARIANS - To provide a few more details, our server (and the manager) said that they do not offer a veggie-friendly version of the tasting menu. They had no vegetarian entrees on the menu, so they told our vegetarians that they could prepare one of the other entrees without the protein (i.e., serve the accompaniments to the fish entree, sans fish). This did not make for much of a meal. I am dumbfounded that a restaurant that makes a big deal of locally sourcing its food manages to completely disregard the relatively large number of vegetarian and vegan people who ascribe to that philosophy. There is not warning of this on their website, and I received no such notice when making my reservation. They should really put this unusually philosophy on their web site so that vegetarians and vegans can go elsewhere.",-0.8915,0.815,0.081,0.104,0.4669413179413179

We had the tasting menu, and felt that it contained many interesting and delicious ingredients that didn't necessarily combine into something greater than the individual parts. But each dish had lots going on in it, for sure. The most successful were actually two courses that were added, a amuse bouche of curry and pineapple soup, and a pre-dessert with mace ice cream. The dessert itself was also a highlight. THe accompanying wine pairing is a good deal. While there are no stunners, the wines work well  with the dishes, particularly considering home many disparate flavors there are in each one.

Delectable foods expertly prepared with mainly seasonal, local ingredients and so an ever changing menu.  Excellent wine and fun specialty drink selection. Their top shelf booze is indeed that. A cozy little casual bar, too.  Very attentive service by knowledgeable, well trained, often food service degreed expert professionals who seem honestly to enjoy and thoroughly, excellently perform in their roles. Friendly Chef often surprises by casually moving amongst the tables and greeting guests, inquiring as to welfare and opinions.

2014-05-07,2.0,"Just dined at North Pond for the first time, a special occasion to celebrate my daughter's university graduation.  We had a party of eight -- and the first problem was a rule restricting us to a set menu. Odd, but OK, we rolled along with it.  Second problem, when we arrived and were seated by a window, it was so cold that the wait staff had to bring shawls for the women in my party (I shivered in my suit jacket).   On the plus side, the cocktails were top notch and the wine list very impressive (we had both an Alsatian Pinot Gris and a beautiful Bordeaux that was priced at an accessible $68). The food, though was highly uneven.  An amuse of duck strudel started us off, and was fine, followed by a mushroom starter with a hen egg and broth  (brave move the egg, but the dish was so so).  A good salad - the highpoint of the meal for many of us -- came next:  a poached spot prawn, with greens and jalepeno foam.  There were two mains:  a perfectly presentable grilled strip steak served with marrow topped custard and an odd chewy short rib, and a halibut dish that was, frankly insipid.  Desert was a chocolate dish made interesting by a ganache with grilled yuzu.  Service was mixed too, some staff were attentive and knowledgable; others were behaving like they were slinging hash, like the tron who tossed the butter plates onto the table (they rattled).  We left disappointed. When the salad is the highpoint something is wrong.  Chef Sherman was in the dining room, right at the pass, but didn't engage with the patrons.

2014-05-01,2.0,"This place is definitely not on my favorite list. For a restaurant being so idolized this place was awful. My family and I are not new to nice restaurants. We often go out to dressed up dinners and love trying new dishes.  We went to North Pond to celebrate my mother's birthday. She wanted to go to a place that has a beautiful view, which North Pond offered. However, we did not get to enjoy the view because we were seated in the middle of the 2nd dining room. The set up of the restaurant consists of two rooms and a small hallway, I'm talking about really small, two people would not be able to pass each other at the same time small. One room, of course the smaller one, was breath taking. It had the view that everyone wants to see. The pond and a little bit of trees and, of course, being downtown, Lincoln Park to be exact, you have to see at least some of the skyscrapers. The walls were all ceiling to floor windows, but not the wall that connected the two dining rooms, that was brick... I'm not sure why that wall is even there.  The room we were seated in was dim and cozy. The whole view of the outside was hidden behind the wall. There were definitely too many tables that were all full! The restaurant looked and felt too crowded. There was no seating outside on the patio in front of the beautiful pond!  Moving on to the food and prices. The food was French, but most of the names were easy to understand. The menu was split into 4 sections. The first section consisted of the specials, which had 5 different plates, I believe. The whole table had to participate in the specials section; you could not replace any of the items nor add anything to it, it cost $90 a person. The other 3 sections were starters, first course and second course, with about 4 or 5 choices in each one. Everyone needed to pick one food item form each section excluding the specials. Portions were quite small, of course, and I did not enjoy that. In my opinion, the food was too dolled up and did not have enough flavors. My sister, who ended up getting the same exact things as me, did not enjoy her food as well. We started with Squid, Squash. There was only about 3 pieces of squid in my plate and I expected more. My mom had the Fole Gras, Ginger she seemed to have enjoyed it. For the main course my dad, sister and I all had the Lamb, Lettuce and my mom had the Duck, Cabbage. The lamb was not too bad but I felt that it was not enough food. Seemed like most of the time was spent on trying to make the plate look fancy and not the food. One thing we did all enjoy was the dessert. I had the Chocolate, Huckleberry but my sister chose to go with the Coconut, Milk. My dessert had just the right flavors of sweet and sour and the chocolate was not too sweet. My sister's dessert, however, was much sweeter than mine and I didn't like the mushy texture it had. These plates were not small at all, very filling and sweet. It is really too bad that the menu changes. I'm not sure how often but it does, which is disappointing if you would find a food you really enjoyed. Also the service was not quite what I had expected. It seemed to me that they were lacking waiters because some of our food was brought out by a host.  Over all I would not recommend this restaurant to others because I did not like it. I was still hungry after we left and was very disappointed with the atmosphere and food. If you are looking for a place with a view and better service then you should really look into a place called Cité.",0.9877,0.855,0.094,0.051,0.47200767069188115

It's one of those places I pass by all the time and think if only there were the right occasion or I found a stash of cash somewhere, I would be delighted to blow it all right here. Made the reservation, no problem. I did not feel out of place as I feared I might. Service was incredibly attentive and our server although a bit stuffy, was very informative and knowledgeable, making suggestions and educating us throughout the meal. We began with the amuse bouche, a smoked trout and blood orange bite. If only it weren't in poor taste to lick the plate...my friend didn't care for it (craziness) so I snatched it right up. Wasn't soon after that someone came around and took it away to bring the first course. Literally, I was holding the plate and they fought me to take it away. Next up was the corned beef and cabbage soup. Loved the presentation, loved the caraway bread. It was smooth, but the flavors were bold and exquisite. I opted for the seafood dish as my main course, a black bass with shrimp dish in a sauce I couldn't exactly recall. The best part about it were the shrimp. My friend had the beef. It was a flatiron steak. While the sauce was incredible and the shortrib portion that accompanied it was excellent, the cut of meat itself is rather difficult to chew and even though the flavors were all there, I had a hard time with the texture.  Desert was nothing I would ever go out of my way to order, it was described as a coconut and lime cake. With that being said, it was served alongside a scoop of jerk sorbet with a chocolate glass. Incredible. It was my favorite dish. I couldn't believe the flavors that were dancing in my mouth. That sorbet was out of this world! Last up after the check were the passion fruit gummies and olive oil cake bites. The gummies were like nothing I've ever tasted. Couldn't even justify them with an attempted description.  I enjoyed the wine pairings along with dinner. I'm not saying that I am a wine expert by any means, but I do enjoy my wine and none of the three course pairings blew me away.  Overall, service, charming ambiance, the different courses, getting to see the chef himself expediting the tickets on the floor, etc. all made up one of the most fine dining experiences I have ever encountered and while it kills me a little to spend that much on a single meal, I am glad I got to experience a Michelin star restaurant and especially one that I have passed by nearly everyday for the last five years.",0.9936,0.813,0.137,0.05,0.6014673311184939

Sundays reason to visit North Pond....Chef week has started and I thought I would get an early start to a week of fine dining.  There are few places that I can think of that are better suited for this type of food demonstration.  This is one of the first places I can think of that was  doing farm to table/local products before that was all the rage. Couple of key points for North Pond.  First it's a great location, one of the nicest setups in the city.  It's tucked away in Lincoln Park in a old warming house for ice skating.  Beautiful setup on the ponds with a view of the Hancock building down the lagoons along the lake.  It's almost like you are not in the city while you a dead in the middle of a busy area.  The building itself is a charming Prairie design setup with basically two rooms.  Ask to be seated in the front room near the fireplace for great views.  I put the views from this 2nd next to Everest.   2nd always great staff that are into their food.  Great service and friendly environment makes that inviting and enjoyable. 3rd food is always excellent. 4th great place for a date as you can take a nice walk after dinner. I have eaten hear several times and they have all been great.  This week is chef's week so they are doing a 4 course meal for $44 plus a nice wine pairing for $20 additional.  Two options on the menu, one seafood and the other beef.  We basically ordered two tastings and asked that they bring opposites so we tried everything.  We did add the foie gras to our dinner.... it's outstanding, one of the best we have had in several years.... we actually added it twice as we ordered it again near the end of our meal... yep twice and I'd suggest you do the same ;) Beef dish was excellent and we both thought better than the fish dish.  For the app they had a soup (take on St Patty's day with corned beef) and a octopus terrine.  The terrine was top notch and I would order that again and again.  The soup was solid and my wife enjoyed it, I liked it as well but what we always end up doing is comparing the two items in ever course.  Terrine wins this hands down but the soup was a great take on the holiday. Amuse Bouche was really a tasty little start.... would like to get that as an appetizer.... maybe 6 of the little mushroom balls of goodness.  I do not recall what it all was but it was a tasty little start. The wine pairings we interesting.  Whites were better than the reds however there was a Chianti that was very good.  All paired well with the food. Only item that I wasn't thrilled with was the desert but it's not due to quality I'm just not a coconut fan.   Top it all off there was a very nice couple that got engaged that evenning.  Watched the young guy sweat it out as his soon to be fiance was delayed to major traffic issues going on.  It was like a drama telivision show.  Sent the poor guy a drink as he was checking the ring, checking his phone, looking very stressed.  Everyone gave them a nice round of applause once he popped the question.

The food and service were phenomenal!  Our server was knowledgable about each dish, how it's prepared, and whether the meat was integral to the dish or how well it could be modified.  He was meticulous enough to find out from the chef whether anything like meat stock had been used without us even having to ask.  We were able to choose from most items on the menu and each dish blew us away (descriptions below for vegetarians to see modifications). The restaurant and decor are cozy and the view of the Chicago skyline over the pond and park are stunning.  For special occasions, they also customize menus with your message and do special desserts which are lovely personal touches.  I highly recommend this for an intimate couple or small group meal and can't wait to try their other seasonal menus. *** We each started with warm Uplands cheese-rutabaga soup - bosc pear, slaw and shallots (minus a smoked trout galette).  For our entrees we had squash and cabbage - roasted butternut squash, brown butter, red cabbage, rye crumb and pomegranates (minus some whitefish) - and pasta - fresh beet fettuccine, charred broccolini, smoked creme fraiche and syrup (minus some chicken).  They enhanced each dish with additional and different vegetables, such as braised leeks with the squash, rather than just take out the meat.  For dessert, we had Pecan, Coconut - red velvet cake, coconut-pecan cream, brown butter ice cream, carmelized pecans, coconut tuile - and Coffee, Orange - coffee panna cotta, blood orange sorbet, chocolate espresso crumble, candied zest.  Our mouths are watering for more.",0.9921,0.851,0.132,0.017,0.4691815476190475
2014-03-02,2.0,"An evening at the North Pond ends as it begins, a whimper on the edge of a pond on the edge of a lake on the edge of a state on the edge of a world falling off the edge of a planet spinning irreversibly into oblivion.   In other words, North Pond underwhelms. It saddens me, for the pull of localvoria in a picaresque woodland locale should be cause for celebration.  Sadly, the execution is lacking as a whole.   North Pond presents an odd conundrum; dine in the colder months, when game appears on the menu, but the locale discourages, or dine in the warmer months, where the menu may be blase, but the pond beckons?  We gambled on game, and lost. Your meal may begin well, for foie gras can be there for you, and you will enjoy it, as you cannot but enjoy, for foie gras is one of the view divine blessings left for us; it will be good. But you'll be blinded by poor design; the walls are heavily wooded, seemly designed by an acolyte of Frank Lloyd Wright gone mad.  The overdose of Prairie Style paneling douses the dining room in wooden darkness; a darkness brutally contrasted by the blindingly glaring white lights of the exposed kitchen.  It makes for an uncomfortable contrast.  Furthermore, the exposed kitchen is a puzzling design choice; I am paying far too much to have my meal intruded upon by the cacophony of creation.  So we must suffer in twilight. Meanwhile, your second course may provide some light-hearted juiciness, such as a crisp scallop dish or something similarly exotic.  it may well be delicious and lovely, but it will only belie the disappointment to come. Your third course will disappoint, because of course you were hoping for significant game, but even in the depths of winter your only option is pheasant, which will be crushingly, disappointingly dry.  Spaetzle cannot save it, nor can sausage.  it simply dulls you, and the dullness of the dish dulls your senses. You'll have no desire for dessert, so you'll simply leave. And so you'll leave, and you'll let your server know you are leaving, and he will acknowledge it, and so will the maitre'd, and so will other members of the staff, and they will all ask you where you are heading, and you will tell them, and they will ask you if you need a taxi, and you will tell them you do, and they will tell you a taxi will be waiting for you at the landing spot, oh yes it will be there they tell you, but it is 15 below zero and you are walking past the ice laden pond to the road and no cab is there, nor is there a cab master, and you stand there, frozen yet not at all full from your meal, and just hope that you can raise Uber, when, in the distance you see the light, the trapezoidal light on top of a vehicle - is it, could it be? it is! a vacant cab, awaiting passengers, appearing not from a call from the restaurant, but a blessing from serendipity, and it pulls up in front of you, as manna from heaven often arrives in front of hungry travelers, or as water turns into wine in front of bacchus, or grass into grass in front of anyone, or rock into meth in front of Heisenberg, or etc into etc, and so finally you are able to leave this dead lake, this dead park, and look forward to warm whiskey in warm surroundings with warm people, and you can put this blase experience behind you, never to return.... All of which is to day, dining at North Pond is a hassle.  And then next day you wake, and have vague feelings of dread as you review your credit card statement, and wonder why so much can produce so little, and you reiterate your vow never, ever to return.",-0.9194,0.766,0.106,0.128,0.5263668430335097

This Arts and Crafts/Prairie inspired restaurant was built around the remains of a c. 1912 Chicago parks district warming shelter next to a skating pond in Lincoln Park. Incredible six course dinner included lobster/citrus Japanese fusion starter; red beet-leek soup with prawn and smoked pork belly; soft boiled local farm raised egg with truffles in a Parmesan foam; grilled wild bass with apricots inspired by Panisse (our other entrée was a chorizo spice-crusted ribeye with Mahon gnocchi and assorted seasonal greens on a sherry glaze); finally, a pineapple custard foam amuse bouche before the presentation desert of a chocolate hazelnut passion fruit mousse cake. Got all that?! Natalie, one of the house managers, and Kevin, our server, were attentive and wonderful all evening!  Champagne flowed like water, and super friendly neighbors at an adjoining table generously helped us celebrate 22 years together!

2014-01-30,3.0,"Since this is my first time here, I'm not sure if it's gone downhill or what but it just was not up to par with other Michelin star spots.  This was number 17 I've been to so I do have a large comparison list and I'm surprised to see so many positive reviews but perhaps this is a recent decline.  The decor is wonderful.  The wood and fireplace remind me of an upscale lodge or something and then the carvings in the wood are more modern, art deco.  It's really comfy.  The wine list is not large and the markups are more then 100% so that's a knock.  Our server, Jennifer, was awesome though.  She certainly lived up to the Michelin standard.  I felt the atmosphere was just a bit laxed other than her though.  The price point is pretty solid though so bonus for that.  One issue I had is that, other than when Jennifer delivered a dish for us, others did not describe what was in front of us.  Sure, it's on the menu but it is typical for the server to explain what you are about to devour upon delivery.  They sort of just came and left the plates, which is fine but not when your peers are Tru and Topo. The bread was standard bread you could get anywhere, pretty underwhelming.  The wasn't hot and the butter was very cold.  We started with the foie gras.  I have to say that was very good.  It is a large portion as well.  The cranberries and the maple sauce that they pair with it is spot on.  We got the charcuterie plate, which was very tasty.   Two helpings of foie?  Why not!  One was straight up and this was a mousse, so it's all good!  I'm a foie connoisseur and this was probably the second best I've ever had (after the Pig).  The accompaniments such as  frisee and mustard were just bleh but the meat itself was very good.  The jowls were a bit on the bland side.  Those were what I was most excited about but were probably my least favorite (although certainly not bad).  The entrees themselves really fell short for both of us.  My husband got the pheasant.  It was better than my skate but nothing outstanding.  I love skate and was really excited but this for me fell short.  It had the tiny scallops with it, which were very bland to me and the skate itself just didn't have that nice, crispy exterior I love with skate (which I could not replicate at home for the life of me) and was sort of soggy.  The interior was nice and the sauce was okay but not as good as I expected.  Overall the ambiance is okay and the food was okay but no need to return.",0.9965,0.777,0.169,0.054,0.5431243308662663
2014-01-27,3.0,"We have been very satisfied diners at North Pond for years, but feared its acquiring international status thanks to Michelin.  Sadly, our fears were fulfilled. The food has turned from imaginative to silly as we thought it might. The dishes were always more elaborate than they need be, but now two actually were poorly done, as well as with far too many ingredients.  The first course scallops in rapini was over spiced (with cumin I believe) so the taste of the many other ingredients were lost. No one could have identified the taste of the scallops. Of course, they were visually hard to find as well, being a negligible fraction of the mass.  The lamb main course, with three kinds of lamb, was frankly a disaster: the six or so slices of roast lamb were UNseasoned. No herbs (thyme or rosemary are customary in French cooking) and also no salt at all. One of the three kinds of lab was a ""lamb tongue"" not more than 1 sq. inch in size. Actually, I should have sent the dish back to the kitchen, but could not break the heart of my companion who was celebrating her birthday and enjoying every minute of the ambiance and scenery..  Desserts were so ridiculously elaborate (say 6 components each) that we would not consider them. Another diner did, and left half uneaten.  Service was excellent, but the detail with which dishes were described (even to customers who said they did not want to hear the detail, as we overheard) was actually amusing.

2013-12-15,4.0,"Had a fabulous time at North Pond. Went on a week night just for fun--not a special occasion, but I can definitely see how and why people would go there to celebrate something. Here's how I would break down the experience: Ambiance:  Not busy at all, but they grouped the diners in one of the same areas of the restaurant, so it still had a great social feel.  Tables weren't too close together--(don't like how at certain restaurants you can basically hear everything the table next to you is saying, and it feels like you're dining with them--not the case at NP).  Felt overall cozy, not too formal but definitely 'special', dim lighting, and true to the seasonal menu and location of the restaurant itself. Was concerned it might feel 'dated', which by some tastes perhaps it is, but it all seemed to really work. I think this is a place people like Ina Garten would enjoy :)  Food: The food was absolutely delicious!  I ordered duck and a seasonal salad. The duck was prepared 3 ways, and it exceeded my expectations.  My dining partner ordered a pork dish and was pleased.  We wanted to save room for dessert and thought portion sizes might allow that; however, portions were very generous, and we were too full--will have to do dessert next time.  Service: I would describe the service as classy. Our server was just the right amount of attentive, and she helped us to feel comfortable.  Perhaps this is standard practice--our server left us two chocolates and a couple cookies at the end of the meal along with the tab. Nice touch.  Would I go back?: Yes, definitely! Great for milestone birthdays, anniversaries, family get-togethers, etc. A neighborhood and city gem.",0.9978,0.729,0.248,0.023,0.5009856630824374

Our table did the full Tasting Menu ($90 a plate)  which covered everything from foie gois and squab to califlower puree and pomegranate to chocolate mousse and cranberry sorbet.  My boyfriend is a pretty picky eater, but we both found ourselves cleaning every single plate.  The beer and wine suggestions made by our server were spot on for the meal.  The seasonal menu which is written daily, is based on locally sourced ingredients, and is certainly worth of that shiny Michelin star. Our server was jovial.  You could tell she enjoys what she does and actually eats all the food this restaurant puts out.  It took us almost 3 hours to get through the full Tasting Menu and I did not feel rushed at all. I took .5 star off because we were the youngest people (27 and 29) in the entire restaurant.  By at least 10 years.  Not that I'm an ageist, but made the ambience feel a little stuffier than what it really was.",0.9568,0.916,0.084,0.0,0.4463690476190475

Lastly I really liked the location, minus parking, because you can walk out and enjoy the walk along the lake.  When we were there we saw a family of ducks walking around and swimming in the lake.  Like 5 ducks were following their parents (hopefully), cruising the lake.  It was one of those moments when you really really wanted to have DSLR on your hand.",0.9756,0.89,0.11,0.0,0.3833333333333333
2013-11-17,2.0,"We visited North Pond yesterday during rainy day in Chicago after my desperate last minute search for restaurant with gorgeous surrounding. North Pond receptionist team was very sweet - they printed ""Congratulations"" on the menu when I told them we were celebrating my friend's life event. In addition, they were happy to seat us on the window seat albeit a non rainy day would have been ideal time to enjoy the surrounding. Food quality was pretty superb; you could taste the freshness of the ingredients such as monkfish and foie gras (you suck, California). I have to say the highlight of the dish was the horseradish flan and pork belly that accompanied the beet salad - they probably tasted better than the center of the plate: beet. It's worth noting that North Pond is probably one of the few places in Chicago that celebrates local food and that doesn't drench the food with salt.  The reason why I deducted 3 stars from my review was due to our server, Nicholas. Nicholas didn't take our order although we have been seated for 20 minutes. In the end, we had to get the manager to get our champagne out and to take our order - I should have taken her name since she was a sweetheart. Throughout the food service, Nicholas was hardly present at our table and when he was present, he was giving us some attitude. At the end of the meal, we mistakenly asked Nicholas to put in our dessert order - which was a simple chocolate mousse. 20-25 minutes later, the dessert didn't show up and my dining partner was not too pleased. We ended up having to alert the manager again and she was apologetic. She comped us with two small glasses of dessert wine. For a recently crowned 1 Michelin Star restaurant, you would expect a first class server.

2013-09-16,3.0,"Selected by my sister who had been there twice before, I loved the setting of this restaurant, which is nestled into a hillside and faces the pretty pond, beyond which is the dramatic city skyline. Our party of four arrived early, and were asked to sit at the bar, which we did, but before we could order drinks, we were seated at our dinner table.  Our evening was hampered by the fact that our waitress could not hear us, and we could not understand her. She was pleasant, but ineffective. She got our wine orders wrong, which was not a big deal, but at these prices, you expect flawless service. She also gave us incredibly complicated instructions after dinner as to how they would summon a taxi for us, and she told us we had to walk quickly after we left the building, or their valet would release the taxi to others. There was no valet where she sent us, and we had to flag down our own taxi. Small thing, but honestly, to be told to hurry along the path, and then to be standing there on the edge of the park in the dark, wondering if a valet or taxi was ever going to appear, was sort of a strange ending. The complementary foie gras morsel was spectacular. My first course was the ""Egg, Tomato"", which was tasty. The ""coulis"" reminded me of tomato soup, but the flavor was nice. I would have preferred that my egg not be nearly raw, but I hadn't asked how it was cooked, so my bad.  My entree was the ""Duck, Peach"" was was described as ""Pan-browned duck breast, smoked duck meat, charred peaches and compote, baby leek, rainbow chard, hazelnut streusel"".  I received two slices of duck breast (3 inches x 1/2 inch) which were nearly impossible to slice, even with the steak knife. I had to saw at them!  There was one peach half and some mushy peach stuff. The chard and the little hazelnut ""birdsnest"" (not a streusel) were both very tasty, but were more garnishes than side dishes. I thought the portion of duck was incredibly stingy and not at all tender, and the entree was not worth $36--not by a long shot. Others in our party had the Pork tenderloin and Red Snapper, and they both liked their dinners. My dessert was the Peach mascarpone feuilletee. It was not ""feuiletee"" at all--as I cut it with the side of my fork, I had to really push hard to cut through the pastry. It was not light and flaky and there were no perceptible layers; its texture was more like a biscuit than puff pastry. The nasturtium ice cream was unique, and the flowers are grown on-site, which is nice to know.  I very much liked the European-trained manner of having all entrees at the table served at once by as many waiters as there are persons in your party. That's impressive. So, in a nutshell, I'd say this place is beautiful to look at, but the menu is too self-conscious, the service is uneven, and the prices are not justified by the food served.

2013-08-12,4.0,"Aside from the usual boozy suspects (bellinis, Bloody Marys etc.), North Pond also features a selection of sparklings, reds and whites by the glass, as well as freshly squeezed juices and coffees. We opted for a couple really tasty cappuccinos to follow our complementary drinks, which were very tasty indeed. Crafted by James Beard award winner Bruce Sherman (who many say have been robbed a Michelin star for many repeated years), the food is locally sourced and seasonal ingredient driven, presented with an approachable level of sophistication.  It's familiar, yet inspired, exactly the kind of food I like to eat. Weekend brunch means a $33 3-course prefixe menu, with about 4 options per course to choose from.  Knowing we would share, we went with:   Lemon Poppyseed Cake The cake had a nice moist crumb with a tasty tart glaze on top.  A lovely way to start the meal.   Soft Poached Egg, Sauteed Trumpet, Pleuotte Mushrooms, Caramelized Onion-Apple Tart, Greens This was by far the best dish of the day. The egg was perfectly poached, which when broken, mixed with the umami-rich mushrooms to yield a sumptuously decadent bite. Truly mouthwatering. I think the tart may have been better with a flakier crust, but it was still very tasty, and it's sweetness balanced out the savoury component well.   Gulf Shrimp, Orange-Hazelnut Crumb, Minted Green Asparagus, Pickled Spears, Citrus The shrimp were nicely poached, and I loved the contrast between the bright citrus and the herbaceous asparagus. It was definitly a safe dish, but tasty, fresh and healthy.   Sauteed Arctic Char, Radish-Napa Cabbage Slaw, Apricot Semolina, Pistachios, Glazed Ramp, Herb Pesto Broth This was probably the weak part of the meal. The char had a nice crispy skin, and the semolina was cooked well, but it was a little underseasoned. I also found the slaw a bit wilty and ""off"" tasting- you know, like when cabbage starts to go and it gets that strong farty smell. Kind of like that.   Grilled Pork Tenderloin, Glazed Spare Rib, Bing Cherries and Gelee, Cheese Grits, Cucumber, Spinach Much more successful, the tenderloin was, well, tender, but also well seasoned, pairing beautifully with the sweet tart cherries and savoury grits. The spare rib was a little tough but definitely still enjoyable.   Brown Butter Financier Cake, Ginger Ice Cream, Cured Rhubarb Compote, Vanilla Gastrique, Oatmeal Loved the bright tart rhubarb compost and the fiery ginger ice cream. Again, a very safe dish, but good nonetheless.   Key Lime Tartelette, Ancho Caramel, Coconut Sorbet, Salt and Pepper Streusel, Macadamia Nuts This was my favourite of the two desserts. The tarte was tangy with a delicate crust, and the sorbet was refreshing and bright. The star, however, was the ancho caramel, which while sweet had a peppery kick on the tongue. A really well balanced plate. Upon leaving we were given two packages of seed to plant- very sweet touch! So for two pre-fix courses and a couple cappuccinos, the bill came to $100 for two. Yes, a very pricey meal, and certainly nothing exciting, but I think North Pond would make for an ideal spot for a special family get together or a ""safe"" date choice. The view was absolutely stunning, the service was professional, and the food was all well prepared.

2013-07-31,5.0,"What a lovely, lovely spot. I'm not entirely sure how North Pond has managed to make itself a tranquil oasis in the middle of the city, but it has.  With each step down the path to the restaurant, it seems to get quieter and more peaceful and when you end up in front of the entrance, near the pond, it's just so pretty.   The restaurant is beautiful as well - the architecture sways prairie style and is really warm and welcoming inside.  I had a lovely view of outside, which was very nice, though I will say for those facing the interior, I'm sure the architecture and decor is just as pretty (ok, that's probably a stretch, but I'm trying to make it a win-win!).   I visited for brunch - which is a three-course menu.  The menu skews more lunch-y, though there are a few items which have some egg representation.  I had the starter mushroom crepe option which also had a fried egg.  Visually, it wasn't the prettiest, but it was really delicious!  I also tried the shrimp with beets...really refreshing! For my entree, I had the pork.  It was perfectly cooked and nicely moist and delicious.  It was a large portion and considering I had basically annihilated the starter, I began to get full about half-way through.  Dessert was the peach hazelnut and while really tasty, I was so full by this point that I couldn't finish it.   Service was really friendly and considering we weren't being very quick on picking menu items, they didn't try to rush us and were very accommodating.

2013-07-21,4.0,"A dear friend of mine and I had a nice Sunday Brunch with a reservation at 12 noon.  We came pretty much on the dot, but then were told that they were getting our table 'prepared', so it would just be a couple of more minutes.  We ended up waiting for about 15 minutes.  We were then led to our table, and I realized that 3/4 of the restaurant was empty, tables already spread out and 'prepared.'  This was a bit annoying, but our dining experience made up for it.  Our server was extremely nice, efficient, and funny.  We chose the prix-fixe that came with 3 courses: a mini cinnamon roll was brought out - I was a little disappointed that it wasn't warm, but it was comparable to ones you can find at Costco. I started off with the 'Egg, Rib,' which was a chunk of marinated sparerib, a sunnyside up egg, all set on top of spin rosso polenta, roasted shallots, and spiced jus.  This came in a little cast iron plate, and it was absolutely delicious - the polenta, the slightly fatty sparerib, and the sunnyside up egg all meld together greatly, and the seemingly tiny dish greatly filled my stomach.  Great amount of seasoning.  For the entree, I had the 'Grassfed Beef, Beans,' which was skirt steak à la plancha, shell bean bacon ragout, cavolo nero, crispy shallots, and a sunnyside up egg.  This came on a warm plate to keep the items warm.  They were medium-rarely-cooked slices of beef on top of cavolo nero and very salty beans.  This beef was good, but I would have preferred it to be cooked a bit longer.  Overall, the beans were just overpoweringly salty.  My friend, on the other hand, had her order confused, and ended up having the 'pancake' in a cast iron bowl, and that was caramelized sugar crust on top which tasted like a creme brulee corn muffin - perfectly sweet for a dessert dish, but not for an entree.  That came with a side of sauteed spinach leaves.  For dessert, I had the 'Almond, Fig', which was a toasted almond cream brioche, caramelized fig jam (that seemed like orange marmalade), creme fraiche ice cream, and orange vanilla syrup.  A little bit too sweet for my taste, this reminded me of something like an almond muffin, smeared with orange  marmalade.  My friend had the Pineapple cake that was a little too dry.  Overall, I would definitely come back here for the appetizers any day and the service that came along with it (there were 4 different waiters catering to us).  Parking on Cannon was actually easy, so you really don't need to valet or take the public transportation. + 'Egg, Rib' +brunch option +friendly staff",0.9969,0.793,0.17,0.037,0.5615853658536585

And you have to walk through the beautiful North Pond part of Lincoln Park to get there. What an amazing way to prepare for a great meal! We came for our third anniversary and they had printed ""Happy Third Anniversary"" on the menus for us. Cute. The cocktails were excellent, not as boozy as you'd get at one of the better bars but perfectly mixed to accompany the delicious food. Oh, the food! We got: Foie Gras, fruit: a much larger portion of foie than we were expecting but it was so good, we definitely ate much more than we had expected. Mozzarella, Artichoke (Fresh Mozzarella, Oven Roasted Tomato, Marinated Baby Artichokes, Basil, Toasted Focaccia, Balsami): The mozzarella was spectacular, definitely the best I've ever had.

We won't be back here for a while (purely out of budgetary concern) so why not taste across their whole range? I was expecting something sweeter, but it was actually on the savory side.

2013-06-05,4.0,"My hubby and I went here on a double date with my sister and brother-in-law for Sunday brunch. The location is the first thing that hits you when you arrive. The restaurant sits on a stunning site tucked behind trees, down a path away from the road. If you didn't know it was there, you might never find it. The pond is a pretty site and it's fun to stop and watch the waterfowl for a few minutes before dining. The interior of the restaurant is a lesson is studied prairie style. Someone paid a lot of attention to getting all of the interior details just perfect. Brunch is a three course price-fixe affair with about four selections available for each course. Although the brunch menu doesn't include vegetarian or vegan options, if you call ahead, they'll prepare a veg or vegan meal for you. The service started out fast, but slowed down considerably as the restaurant filled up. I'd suggest getting there early for the best service.  I started my brunch with the Mozzarella, Rabbit which was a tasty bit of tender rabbit swimming in a soupy sauce. I was surprised that it was so light and there was not much mozzarella flavor. Next I had the Whitefish, Fennel which was a perfectly crispy piece of fish served with a lovely fennel sauce. I rounded out my meal with the Chocolate, Peanut which was my least favorite of the three courses. I'm a chocolate fiend and while this tiny dessert was beautifully presented, it really didn't push my chocolate buttons. It was a bit too heavy on the peanut butter filling and too light on the chocolate. If I lived in Chicago, this would probably become a fairly regular haunt and I'd be really happy to work my way through all of the brunch choices.",0.9858,0.854,0.12,0.026,0.5415494899365866
2013-05-27,5.0,"A business trip brought me to Chicago. I've been hearing a lot about the restaurant scene in Chi town for a while now so I planned ahead and searched out the top tasting-menu joints in the city. I settled on North Pond. They have a great location, overlooking the North Pond Nature Sanctuary, appropriately enough. Inside is very comfortable, with a down-to-earth wood motif and an open kitchen, which I love. I ended up opting out of the tasting menu. Just on a few matters of personal preference I was more attracted to the a la carte menu. The pineapple jam on the foie terrine (I am not a huge fan of pineapple for the most part); and the pumpkin-seed crust on the scallops didn't appeal to me. So instead I ordered the seared foie, the bay scallops, and the striped bass. The seared foie gras was on top of braised celery and a maple kabocha squash puree, with dabs of cranberry gelee. What can you say about foie gras? It was flawlessly seared and the cranberry provided good acid to its fattiness. The braised celery was a delicious finely chopped relish kind of thing. The only thing I found odd about the dish was that it came with a tiny cranberry tart. I didn't really understand it, although it was tasty and it was in a little teeny Lodge cast iron pan which was adorable. But I finished the dish and then looked over and thought, ""Okay, I guess I'll eat a breakfast pastry now."" Then came the scallops. The little bay scallops were again flawlessly seared. They were on top of melted leeks (one of my favorite things on the planet) and drizzled with a vanilla pear sauce, which was a very unique flavor and I enjoyed it very much. After that, the chef graced me with a freebie from the tasting menu: a grilled lobster dish (not the one that's on the website.) I think he thought I was a food critic because I was eating alone and redditing on my phone the whole time. But the lobster was delicious (a bit firm as is standard for grilled lobster) with a truffled puree of some type and a reduction sauce which I think was red wine. For my main course I had the striped bass. A generous piece of striped bass sitting on a chunk of braised pork belly, and surrounded by a celeriac puree. The bass itself was a tad underseasoned. Not bland, but plain, not that it mattered because it was flawlessly cooked and I just dabbed it in the celeriac. The pork belly was appropriately fatty and luscious and I felt guilty for eating it. I think the sign of any truly amazing food is when you think ""I probably shouldn't be allowed to have this."" For dessert I had an aromatic cup of french pressed coffee and the ""cheese and fruit"" dessert, which actually came with a creme brulee. It was a very foreign creme brulee for me, it was a cheese creme brulee, and honestly a tad salty under the sugar crust. but it was served with a cup of plum jam, and the saltiness complemented the sweet jam fairly nicely. I also had a piece of the goat cheese which was tasty. That about sums it up. It was one of my favorite meals ever.  I can't wait to check out more Chicago restaurants one day!",0.9927,0.868,0.112,0.02,0.5908419913419912

2013-05-05,4.0,"Very happy I made the effort to finish my weekend job early and made it to their brunch menu which I thought was a good deal for the quality of the food that they are known for. They serve brunch only on Sunday, the rest of the week is dedicated to only dinner. Given that the price of a single serving of a dinner entree is almost as much as of the price for the whole 3-course prix fixe ($33++) -- I thought it was a good way for me to start and, boy, was I hooked. I resonate all of what the other reviewers had said, you won't be disappointed with your experience there. The staffs and manager will do everything in their power to please you. I was greeted with a small complimentary starter which was some type of lemon and cheese loaf bread and upon inquiring the server assistant (petite, small-framed hispanic male) what it was (when it probably wasn't actually his job to explain the details about food), he did his best to explain (and I was impressed that he knew) and even offered me another one which I declined as to keep myself hungry for what I ordered. My first course of choice was Rabbit & polenta which I was not immediately impressed with but as soon as Patrick noticed that, he probably quickly communicated it with Kris, the manager, and made sure my experience was fixed and I was won over immediately. Smoked Char was a delight and their ginger ice cream was delicious. The presentation is exactly what you find in the more expensive Michelin starred restaurants -- it will definitely will wow your date if you have one with you. The food came out promptly, too, very consistent timing. I also like it that the kitchen is visible to diners: whatever they do, how ever they prepare our food is transparent to us.  Now, the menu changes all the time so my comments about food may not be as helpful as my affirmation about the service mentality which is less likely to change and awaits any potential diner. I would say if you are looking for Michelin-starred quality type of food but without too much of the frills and formality involved in a Michelin-starred restaurant setting, here is the place for you. The quality and taste was as good, if not better than the Michelin starred ones and in fact, they are priced, I would say, about 35% percent lower too (judging from the tasting menu price listing). The staffs were friendly and attentive but they do not overwhelm you and they really seves you / fix your problems where it matters. Unlike many restaurants of the same tier and price range where the servers do their best to look sharp, professional, and composed -- here, they are more relaxed, warm, and casual yet more caring/willing to do the things that really matter (and not just asking questions but not really caring about your answers).

Perhaps I'm more of an entree / appetizer fellow rather than a small plate fellow, as I found myself slightly annoyed by the sparseness on the plates and the pacing. I was a bit surprised that several of the dishes were cold (intentionally so) for a cold winter day, and in such a hearty-seeming, lodge-like atmosphere. We skipped the wine pairing, as many seemed to be whites which didn't appeal to our winter mood after a short but blustery jaunt through the park. Otherwise, the food was thoughtfully prepared and delicious. Our waiter was knowledgable and courteous too. The wine seemed marked up more than I would've hoped -- I'm not sure what's standard but believe we payed 400% of shelf price. The interior is impressive (lots of wood, Arts & Craft / Wright-inspired, with lots of right angles) but might be a little stiff for some. My issues with North Pond pertain more to bang for your buck, as I was somewhat disappointed to need a snack in the evening after a 2 hour / $90 tasting menu. I could get a very decent steak and sides for that, and have plenty of leftovers for the next day.

All though this place is known to be very popular during the summer with the most beautiful scenic views of the skyline if you get window seating and it's near a children's park with a pond nearby, it was beautiful in winter too. I made reservations well ahead of time and requested window seating however that goes by first come first serve so we got lucky.

The ambiance is impeccable and the environment is mostly older. I saw older couples and large size group families.  My fiancé and I ordered different things for the appetizer, entree, and dessert and taste tested everything off each others plates. We did not like one thing better than the other, everything was very delicious. I have posted a picture of our menu on this site, but I would also suggest going on the North Pond website and looking at the menus.  I would definitely take that someone special here. I did not want to do something cliche like the Trump Hotel or Signature Room, all though those are nice rooftops, I wanted something different. Both growing up in Chicago, we have seen it all. It was very nice to have tried something new and away from the hustle and bustle. I see myself coming back here again!  One thing that was very expensive was the liquor! 13 bucks for a Mimosa. It was refreshing but I probably would have been fine with water or even a cheaper glass of wine.",0.9936,0.84,0.153,0.008,0.6813233525733526
2013-02-23,1.0,"We have been to North Pond four times.  Each time, the food has been pretty good for my husband, not so good for my vegetarian self.  They routinely do not list a vegetarian option on the menu and when you inquire they say ""we make one off the cuff"".  What this essentially means is, being a vegetarian, you have no say in what the actual meal is, but you will pay $40+ for whatever they come up with.  I find this disconcerting as it was amazing one out of three visits.  The fourth, I finally ordered a dessert cheese plate in place of my meal.  The second issue I have is the valet/cab service.  The first time we valeted, it was 16 degrees and the valet was no where to be seen for 25 minutes outside.  We finally located our car a street away and it was unlocked!!  Unfortunately we could not drive it away as he had the keys but we were able to sit in it until he returned.  This evening, the waiter and host told us the valet would have a cab waiting, to go out to the street.  As we went to the street, the valet was sitting in someone's BMW at the stop sign and said he can't get us a cab unless one drove by.  So we stood outside for another 10 minutes in the Chicago winter waiting.  I am fine with calling my own cab but since you have to walk out through the park and there's no shelter to wait in, I feel as though they should be able to get you one and send you out when it arrives.  I would not be so picky had we ever spent less then $250-$300 for the two of us here but it seems it should be part of the experience at that price. Our server was fairly ""stuffy"" and the service did not lend itself to the customer service oriented establishments we're becoming accustomed to in our generation.   That being said, we do love the ambiance and decor.  It's a lovely restaurant in a lovely spot.  Just be aware your money could go much further elsewhere..",0.9611,0.882,0.079,0.039,0.5351851851851852

We were greeted by a very friendly host who seated us next to the charming, cozy, fireplace. The dining room is beautiful, warm, comfortable, and with an amazing view of Chicago's beautiful skyline. Our server, Patrick,  welcomed us with a friendly greeting. He had been informed of our dietary restrictions and explained that North Pond would do their best to accommodate us accordingly. Patrick was very thorough with his description of the menu and, after speaking with Chef Bruce Sherman, provided us with 2 options from each course that would meet our dietary restrictions. Without compromising the integrity of the dishes and their Farm-to-Table philosophy, Chef Sherman provided us with an absolutely delicious meal with a beautiful presentation. Every course, from the amuse-bouche to the after-dinner sweet treat, was absolutely delicious!! Patrick's service, and knowledge of the food and wine menu, was spectacular and was the cherry-on-top of what had already been a great day. It is clear, to me, that North Pond trains their staff meticulously as I overheard another server provide the same professional service, to his guests, as Patrick provided us.

2012-11-18,5.0,"*********************** 797 *************************          Visited North Pond when I was frequent Chicago monthly for business, but never got around to meet the chef.  Many restaurants in Chicago, famous or not have been closed down over the year. For North Pond to earned this highly prestige award from James Beard Foundation 2012, it's an honor and that North Pond has to be open for more than 10 years.           North Pond is located in the snobby Lincoln Park , water front, beautiful Chicago skyline, very tranquil setting, it's a good spot for date night. The place was jam packed on a SAT night with Lincoln Park crowd, older, dressier, and older money.           We were greeted nicely and seated by the front room  with the view to the water.  The wine list is well crafted by their sommelier, smaller, and very reasonable, all the bottles are under $200. I got to chat up with somm Zack, a nice guy. The menu offers a seasonal tasting menu for $90, and a la carte, plenty of choices for you. WINES: - 2008 Andrew Rich Gewürztraminer - beautiful wine, elegance, tropical, aromatic, perfect with my Foie Gras. -  Jean Manciat, 2011, Mâcon-Charnay, Burgundy - honeysucker, lemon, crisp, beautiful, i paired this with the bass. -  2009 Tokaji Mylitta  - Intense, golden color, full-bodied with aromas of peaches, pears, oranges, and hints of vanilla, creamy, and long finish. I chose this for my desserts dishes.  - Cheese, prosciutto, liquidity amuse bouche - our server warned us about the liquid would pop in my mouth, I still made a little mess :-) -  Foie Gras, Cranberry - Seared Duck Foie Gras, Cranberry-Pistachio Tartelette, Maple-Kabocha Purée, Baby Turnip, Celery, Cranberry Gelée, Pistachio - for being in California, the stupid law that banned Foie Gras,( I'm a biggest advocate to reverse that law now. And you ignorant folks about this, don't get me started) - this was such a generous size, beautifully seared, nice texture, lovely. MUST TRY dish. - Beet, Salmon - Candied Baby Gold, Red, White and Chioggia Beets;  Cured King Salmon, Albacore Tuna Pastrami, Flatbread, Pecans - The portion of salmon and albacore were evenly, both was quite good, beautifully plating, love it. - Farm Egg, Sweetbreads - Soft-Boiled Farm Egg, Prosciutto-Enrobed Sweetbread Wafer, Charred Cippollini, Candy Onion-Parsley Coulis, Pumpernickel - I love egg, running egg, 62-62.5-63 degree eggs, I love running egg yolks period! The sweetbread was so flavorful, the aroma of the prosciutto, together they are match made in heaven. DON'T MISS this dish. - Squid, Pepper - Squid a la Plancha, Red Bell Pepper Jam, Yellow Coulis, Handkerchief Pasta, Cavolo Nera, Charred Pimentos - it's perfectly charred, lighter dish that I thought, well-balancec. - Bass, Bacon - Grilled Wild Striped Filet, Brown Sugar-Braised Pork Belly, Celeriac, Baby Carrots, Purple Potatoes, Lemon-Chowder Emulsion - Can you imagine I would order this dish if it wasn't for the pork belly? This reminded me of Japanese Buta no Kakuni, a shimmered pork belly dish. The bass was moist, nice, and fresh.   - Dessert - Pear, Fennel Roasted Pear, Green Apple-Fennel Sorbets; Chai Ice Cream; Salted Caramel Macarons, Sautéed Pear, Nuts - such a beautiful sweet and savory dessert. - Dessert bites from North Pond.         If you are fan of me on Yelp or a personal friend, you know that this particular meal has some of the fattening food group that I adore. This is the reason why I WORK OUT 15 hours a week for. So I can eat the food I love to eat :-) Foie Gras, Sweetbread, Bacon, Prosciutto, Egg, Pork Belly... It's all about a balance lifestyle. Things that you do for the food that you love.        Our server was very nice and attentive. The manager was sweet  and pretty too. Got to meet chef Sherman at the end, he was kind, a bit shy and handsome. It's definitely not easy to run a business of this size for this long. Chef Bruce Sherman definitely has a great team under his wing. North Pond is just a solid restaurant, congratulations to them. A MUST VISIT resto in Chicago.         P.S. If you visit North Pond for the first time, prepare to get lost for a little. So give yourself some extra time before you head it here.",0.9996,0.709,0.246,0.045,0.5937301587301589

The server was incredibly helpful and nice.  The food was quite good.  I did feel like they were rushing the courses a bit, however.  This didn't take away from the meal.   My biggest criticism is the host staff. I asked to be seated before my date arrive. I understand the need to wait for a complete group, but it seems silly to stand by the policy on a slow night. After trying to convince the hostess for the second time, I just gave up and waited at the bar. On our way out we said by to the young host, who simply ignored us. Sad that a great evening was hurt by a poor host staff.  Despite bad door staff, I still think it deserves 4 Stars for service, ambience, and great food.",-0.0323,0.73,0.143,0.127,0.5905505952380953

Of course, the venue and location are unique and special too. It was a chilly Fall night, but the view of the Chicago skyline and the ducks in the pond still made it gorgeous.  The only part of the experience I was unimpressed by was the actual food. As a vegetarian, there was nothing on the menu for me (yes, even in 2012 when being vegetarian is a lot more trendy and commonplace)  . The chef did prepare a plate of veggies, but it was just okay. My friends didn't think their food was impressive either (fish and seafood) but ill add, food becomes such a small part of the North Pond experience that you don think too much about the taste.  The only one other comment I'd like to add is that on a busy-ish night, this place gets a little cramped.

Oh, and the food is to die for.  We opted to order off the menu rather than do the prix fixe menu.  We both ordered 3 dishes and a drink.  I had an off the hook old fashion that Mr. Draper would have been proud of.  She ordered the Kentucky Mustang which is a play on Tom Collins.  Well crafted drinks. And now on to the food for starters we ordered the Foie Gras and the squid.  The foie gras was complemented with a poached apricot and blackberries.  It was meaty tasty and sweet.  The fruit went so well with this, I was surprised.  The squid as well was cooked to perfection that perfect state of tender and juicy.  That is hard to achieve on seafood.   It was served with black couscous and onion.  Tasty and just full of different flavors.  Next we got our salads.  I got the beet and trout while she got the crab and avocado.  The beet was served with a tatin, or puff pastry that was just fantastic, I mean fantastic the flavors rolled and danced on my tongue.  The plate also offered a different selections of beets with a sauce pairing with each.  These were earthly, sweet, savory each one was its own unique world.  The crab and avocado were a match made in heaven as well.  Served with a fresh made cucumber citrus dressing it was remarkable.   Finally for our entrees I got the Salmon and she the duck.  The waiter suggested a glass of the Pinot Noir which was a good partner to the food.    The salmon was crusted in a arugula-pine nut mixture and served with the best succotash I have ever had.  Oh and not to forget the grilled peach on the side.  It was lots of flavor woven together into a great dish.  The duck was a breast and confit thigh. Juicy, fatty, and decadent.  This is one of those last meal dishes.  Served with potato, radish, and cherries it was perfect.  As much as I liked the salmon, I am jealous of that duck. We were quite full after that point and declined on the dessert.  They still brought out some truffles and mango jellies for us on a plate that read happy birthday.  So, this place is worth it.  Special occasion type stuff,  unless you can afford it I  suppose, but is well worth every penny.",0.9913,0.854,0.131,0.015,0.6427187902187905

For dessert I picked the raspberry sorbet with pistachio financier, and I wasn't disappointed.  The berries were so good, and the financier was very moist and flavorful.   Service was not bad and the atmosphere is laid back, which is probably why this isn't quite up to the same overall level as other similarly priced places in the city.  But the food shines, so Bruce Sherman's recent James Beard recognition is well-deserved, IMO.",0.9957,0.774,0.226,0.0,0.58994708994709

We opened our meal with a mange crab dish.  The crab was dead, like seriously beyond dead.  The poor crab had been boiled and boiled to sogginess, and it's combination of overly spiced mango, mustard and peanuts literally left the taste of doody on my tongue. Two bites, and we were out My better half then ate the rabbit for his main course and I had the crab salad. Had I known the crab was anything but fresh i never would have ordered it, but the Chef forces all patrons to order their whole meal at one time because he is so fancy.  This round of crab was pretty fresh, I'd give it a 6 out of 10, my husband ordered the rabbit and almost threw up due to the weird consistency of the the ""locally grown herbs and spices"" Portlandia anyone?

2012-06-17,5.0,"North Pond has been my top 3 favorite restaurant in Chicago, not only for spectacular dinners but also for a truly amazing brunch.   Last Sunday we went for brunch with another couple. It was a gorgeous day out. We sat in the front room that offers amazing views of the pond, park and downtown skyline.   Our server, Shannon, is probably one of the best we ever had...we always request him when dining at North Pond. He is knowledgeable, personable and shares our passion for food and wine. Truly an all around great guy.   We started off with hand crafted cocktails...a take on summer sangria - made with fresh strawberries that have been soaked in late harvest riesling...so good!   The restaurant offers a 3 course brunch for $33...with 4 choices in each category...you can't go wrong...   I had the Crab/Avocado to start (peekytoe crab with avocado mousse, mint, radish, carrot broth) very refreshing...great starter   Also had the Cucumber/Salmon (chilled cucumber melon soup with cured salmon, pumpernickel and serrano for the touch of heat) great take on a gazpacho   My main dish was Shrimp/Asparagus (shrimp a la plancha, asparagus, beets, gnocchi,hazelnuts) also a perfect summer dish.   For dessert we ordered one of each...my favorite was the Rhubarb/Orange (citrus rhubarb tart with oatmeal crumble and orange blossom ice cream! How cool is that...   All the entrees were seasonal; just perfect! Bruce Sherman is a very talented chef and I've never had a bad dish there. I'm always surprised with the creativeness that goes into every plate that he puts out.  We enjoyed ourseleves and will definitely be back to try the summer menu.

Every. Penny. We did the seasonal, five-course tasting with wine pairing.  It was thoughtful and delicious.  Each course was even better than the last - and there were two additional courses added with compliments of the chef.  My favorite course was actually one of the complimentary courses - a warm mushroom soup with chevre foam and a spiced madeline.  It was perfect and delicious. The setting is romantic and unexpected.  And, I liked having the opportunity to walk around the park before and after dinner. The staff was incredible.  We especially enjoyed chatting with Zack - who was very helpful in getting us to experiement with the foie gras course.

2012-06-12,4.0,"Okay, okay...more like a 4.9. However, I just can't round up and give North Pond that coveted gold star (5), and I'll tell you why. Went to North Pond for my first wedding anniversary this past weekend, and it was a spectacular choice for celebrating such a momentous occasion. However, after taking several days to process my thoughts on the very complex meal that B and I set off on, I just was left wondering why I hadnt thought ""WOW"" after enjoying such an expensive tab. Now, dont get me wrong. North Pond has very wonderful food, cocktails, service, you name it. It definitely falls much higher on my list than some of my other 4-star ratings. The setting was just the right amount of rustic and romantic, and the view we had looking over the pond with the Hancock in the distance was just wonderful. Service was great, and the menu options were definitely intriguing and delicious. Oh, and the personalized menu that they presented to us? Just lovely. But, a few minor things. I really wanted the wine menu to be a little bit bigger. I like red wine, but I'm more keen on white and I just wish there had been more options. Well, wait, there were a few options that were really nice...but the price tag matched. It was a special night for us...so we went ahead and imbibed. The soft crab appetizer. Was good, but not memorable. However, my husbands foie gras was wonderful. For dinner we had the rabbit and the halibut. Both were cooked well and paired nicely, but the rabbit dish definitely stood out for both of us. For dessert we had the chocolate citrus option, and WOW. You finally twisted my arm, North Pond. 5 stars for the dessert, from 2 people who would much rather drink their post-dinner treat. It was unique, it was clean, strong flavors, it was decadent. It was the perfect ending! I definitely would recommend North Pond for a special night out. Or when your rich friends or rich parents are in town, and are willing to foot the bill.  PS. the cocktail menu is fabulous...if you dont want to go all the way with NP, then at least go into the bar and partake in one of these tasty concoctions and enjoy the view!",0.9989,0.735,0.262,0.003,0.5629866332497913
2012-05-20,5.0,"Had brunch for my third time this morning at North Pond. The food was as outstanding as the first two occasions, but service unfortunately was off. We had to wait for half an hour for our table (we did arrive early, but the place was far from full at the time), no recognition for a special occasion that had been noted in the reservation, no recognition for being repeat customers, and while our primary server was attentive she was not very warm.  Congratulations to Chef Sherman on the recent James Beard accolades, but I do think service needs some tweaking to become Michelin star worthy (the food and ambiance are definitely already there and in fact are better than most of the one star venues I have frequented). I am retaining my five stars for now based on food quality, ambiance, and past experience but expect service to be improved. In most of my favorite upscale Chicago restaurants there is a visible general manager that makes rounds, takes great care of the customers, gets to know repeat guests and ensures that service runs smoothly. Perhaps there is such a person at dinner at North Pond (I have yet to experience NP for dinner), but this type of presence is sorely lacking at brunch.  Despite some negatives this time, I still love North Pond and recommend it to locals seeking top notch seasonal cuisine and to out-of-towners to experience an upscale Chicago dining experience in a beautiful location. The brunch is one of the best values in town for fine dining. I will likely be back sometime this summer, but just was a bit disappointed today.",0.9942,0.737,0.203,0.06,0.5643114697802198

North Pond called me to confirm the reservation and to confirm that they had also received my request for a quiet table.

That's a really nice touch, no? We split four appetizers, four entrees, and two desserts. Without going into the minute details, all of the food was spectacular and well-executed.

2012-01-21,5.0,"A beautiful meal in a beautiful setting. I've walked my dog past this place a thousand times (literally) and finally got to enjoy my first meal there recently on a picturesque winter evening . Service was spot on from the time we walked in the door. We ordered from the standard menu, rather than the tasting menu, so we could try more dishes. Everything came out tasting of the care taken in the preparation. We shared a farm egg appetizer - complete with a little English muffin - and the pig cheeks as well. A very breakfasty start to a winter's meal. Scallops and foie gras rounded out the course. We shared two salads - one was a selection of beets, which I generally don't like. While I wasn't crazy about it the variety and presentation made it interesting and I found myself quite enjoying it. As an entree I chose the wild squab and I couldn't have been happier. Crispy skin, rich, naturally smoky meat with gnocchi and foie gras? Perfection!  Two of my colleagues enjoyed their fish entrees but I was too lost in the pigeon to pay much attention to be honest. Our fourth inexplicably ordered the vegetarian plate - odd, as she is generally a rabid carnivore - and was a little disappointed, But frankly a plate of squash, rutabaga and broccoli is just a little tricky to wrap my head around so I'm not sure what was to be expected.  We took a pass on dessert which prompted the only service faux pas of the evening. When we told the server we were going to pass on the desserts and finish our wine for the moment he politely thanked us and returned a minute later, dropped the check and walked away. As it was our intention to finish our wine and have coffee and after dinner drinks this seemed a little odd and very rushed after a perfectly paced meal. The place was still full, there was no other seating. Weird.  After a brief moment of awkwardness we decided to settle up and moved on to Fion for our after dinner drinks. As we were drinking Ports and Cognacs it seems the server had an opportunity to jump this check by an easy 100 bucks or so but oh well.  It certainly wasn't a big enough slip to tarnish an altogether wonderful dining experience.",0.9843,0.789,0.143,0.068,0.5294748395812225

I think my medallions probably cost them less than 5 bucks and I hate to think what that piece of fish my girlfriend ate actually costs!  I'm sorry but all the garnish in the world doesn't make up for a simple lack of value!  Our bill was nearly four hundred dollars at the end of the night and I was still hungry .......and very angry!

Our goal was to order about 5 different items off of the menu and switch plates between us so we could try it all.  We started with the Celeriac, Chevre and the Walleye, Apple. I highly recommend both. The Celeriac, Chevre was a celery and pear soup with a thin croute bridged across the bowl from rim to rim. The croute was topped with small pieces of bacon and tiny balled pears. The walleye was cooked perfectly. So much attention paid to plating these dishes. They're immaculate works of art.  We split the Lettuce, Crab salad. Again beautiful plating. There was literally a small tower of avocado in a perfect sphere topped with panna cotta. Inside the tower it was stuffed with lump crab. Very tasty. Our entrees were the Grassfed Beef, Farro and the Pork Apple. The Pork medallions were cooked medium rare and was by the far the best pork I've ever tasted. Again supreme attention paid to plating. The plates were setup as eating areas almost. Depending where you ate on the plate a new flavor would arise.

2011-10-02,5.0,"In a word, fabulous.  Fabulous location, fabulous dining room, fabulous service, and most important of all fabulous food!  We went there to celebrate our anniversary during a quick trip to Chicago. We arrived a little early for our reservation and sat and had a glass of wine in the bar, which looks out on a small pond in Lincoln Park - the restaurant is located in the park itself. When we sat for dinner we had an equally lovely view of the pond.  The meal started with an amuse bouche of mushroom veloute with small palmiers of bacon and cheese.  The crunchy bacon flavor of the palmier was a perfect accompaniment to the rich smoothness and delicate taste of the soup. Our first course was ""Walleye, Apple"" (the restaurant apparently believes in short descriptive titles for their dishes).  The walleye sourced from the Great Lakes (probably Erie) was rye encrusted with warm apple Parisiennes (little balls of marinated apple) and a celery and apple salad (long thin shreds of both) served with a dollop of garlic cream sauce.  It was outstanding in terms of flavor and presentation.  We shared a delicious beet salad, with orange, white, and striped heirloom beets.  For her entrée, my wife had cod served on a bed of spinach with wonderfully moist chickpea croquettes on the side.  Again, an outstanding dish with only one flaw (in fact, the only off-note in the entire meal): it was served with a small mound of roasted red peppers that didn't do anything for the dish (except add some muted red color) because it was nearly tasteless.  I had an incredibly flavorful creamy sweet corn ravioli-like creation that was served with excellent sautéed trumpet mushrooms.  The earthiness of the mushrooms and the sweetness of the corn were married perfectly.  We paired all this with a nice rose.  The wine list is decent and not terribly expensive but since this restaurant specializes in sourcing their food regionally it would have been nice to have some wines from the Midwest on the menu. Our Provençal rosé greatly increased the carbon footprint of our meal but it did appear that our food (other than the cod) was from the area.  The appearance of cod on the menu poses some questions that, in hindsight, we should have asked (but we were celebrating our anniversary with wine and that was our intended focus of the evening). Namely, where was this fish sourced? The eastern Canadian cod fisheries have basically collapsed with just some areas fishable (the Bay of Fundy and other areas off the southwest coast of Nova Scotia).  We are fairly certain that we were served Black Cod, which really isn't cod at all but usually goes by the name Sablefish and is sustainably being harvested off the coast of Alaska. We considered ordering the cheese platter to finish the meal, but decided that the  mile walk to our hotel would not make a dent in working that off.  A wise move, as it turned out, since the restaurant provided a lovely complementary plate of sweets when they brought the bill.  All in all, a wonderful meal.  If you are celebrating a special occasion, be sure to mention it when you make reservations; they provided some charming extras to recognize our anniversary.",0.9981,0.823,0.173,0.004,0.6769504977132095

2011-09-05,5.0,"I had Sunday Brunch at North Pond with my friend, who was leaving town soon to accept a new job on the West Coast. She had enjoyed her couple of years in Chicago and wanted to have a special meal before leaving town. Dining at North Pond is not just about the food but the environment itself. The building was built in 1912 as a warming center for ice skaters, and we both enjoyed staring at the details of the Arts and Crafts design (murals, booths, materials, lettering).  Now on to the food. The brunch consisted of three courses for $33 per person (beverage is not included), with a few selections for each course. My friend does not eat meat, but she still had good choices. My first course was poached egg with mushroom, leek, and the cutest mini-English muffin disks ever. She chose a fish starter. My second course was grilled pork loin with BBQ rib pave (sort of a mashed up rib), plus corn pudding, cherry and onion. This plate was fine and hearty at the same time. My friend enjoyed her fish with couscous and baby carrots. My dessert was a trifle with lemon cake, apricot, pine nuts, and cream cheese mousse, which was good but tasted too subtle considering all the ingredients. My friend's dark chocolate ganache was more impressive. It looked like a dessert Great Wall of China, with a long piece of chocolate accompanied by raspberry sorbet, raspberries and some chocolatey cakey flakes. My friend noted that the crowd was generally older and well-dressed, but since it was brunch no one was overdressed. The service was formal and accommodating, though one of the course servers was relatively coarse compared to the others. Considering the fine quality of our meal, we felt that the brunch was worth the price (much more than the higher dinner costs).",0.9957,0.8,0.184,0.016,0.4587056277056278
2011-09-05,3.0,"In a nutshell, get a table with a view, or I'd  pass this one by . . . Interesting place with pretty decent food; however, if you are not seated with a view of the pond/skyline I'd take a pass.  Don't get me wrong, the food was quite good:  Foie gras was very good--some of the best I've had in a long time, the heirloom tomato salad was nothing special and the poached salmon was delicious, desert disappointed)   The thing you need know  is the Pond is RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE for what you get . . . you are paying for the view/experience here; if you don't have the view (and we didn't last night) it is a just a decent place but with big prices e.g. $300 for the two of us. Odd tip of the day:  bring an umbrella--trust me.  :o)   As an aside, for this kind of place, one would think they would offer umbrellas for their guests in the event rain--not to keep, just to use :o)   I'm not knocking them down a star for this, but for a $300 tab you'd think they would trip over themselves to ensure the perfect experience.  For those who have not dined here, you are dropped off on Cannon and then you have approx a 150 +/- yard walk to the restaurant.  It was a beautiful day when we arrived so the walk into to the restaurant was pretty cool; however, as we finished our coffee, the clouds let loose and it poured as the joint was closing.  We were soaked to the bone as the rain wouldn't let up.  The valet could easily collect the 'house' umbrellas and run them back to the restaurant   Again, if you had the view, the $300 for 2 people may be worth it, but if you are in the back room near the kitchen, the value just isn't there.",0.9902,0.825,0.146,0.029,0.5737627187627188

The cocktails all sounded really interesting - The Peach & Honey was so good I needed two of them.  I had the corn and crab soup, and the Alaskan Halibut. The fish and everything that accompanied it (especially the quinoa!) was incredible - light but satisfying.  Dessert could not have been better - you must try their chocolate mousse with a salt and pepper caramel center. As if we needed to eat any more, we were then given a really nice spread of homemade jelly candies and chocolates on a plate with another Happy Birthday"" message written in chocolate.

First, the atmosphere was too loud and air circulation was stuffy, the wait staff pleasant but not too interested when we inquired about substitutions, the menu and the food was unimaginative and uninspired.

Peaches.....I can eat a peach for hours. All in all, it was nice, different and enjoyable. Not too pinky up, umbrella fruity.  1st course: Foie Gras & Chile Relleno in a corn/crab soup. First and foremost, that is the largest sauteed foie gras I have ever been served. Fatty, tasty and crispy on the edges, along with some sweet berries. Oh hells effin yeah! My lady got the corn on the cob soup. The stuffed pepper and lump crab meat was redick. I would have been happy with another bottle of wine and doubling up on these apps. Perhaps next time that's what we'll do. 2nd course: She had the peach salad, which was sweet like a peach, and green like a salad. I had the tomatoes with basil and parm, which for the price, I could have made a weeks worth at the house. All in all, should have skipped, and will do so in the future.  Main event: My lady got the pork tenderloin, which was off the heezy. So many different sauces and flavors, with a colorful presentation as well. I usually order the better dish when we go out, even though we share everything. The halibut was ummmm....yeah. Twas a little on the blandish side. Although the fennel and gazpacho was good.  Dessert: We went for the red velvet cake, which was good, although I've had better in the form of a cupcake. They mistakenly brought over the chocolate and cherry dessert, which I heard was awesome. So we lost out on that. Also their Whiskey and Scotch list is a little lacking.

We've been back several times since but just got into the whole yelping thing so are playing catch up to review the places we've been. We've been for both brunch (a STEAL for the price) and lunch (still quite reasonable). We've had the gambit; fish, pork, rabbit, beef, the whole nine. We usually order different things so we can taste a little of everything off each others plates. The food here is always amazing. Service is impeccable. The rotating menu based on their seasonal ingredients keeps things interesting (the only downside to this is not being able to enjoy a favourite dish on repeat visits). The flavour combinations are well thought out and simple; not this off the wall cooky stuff that may or may not work, or something merely the chef thinks would be amazing. It's classic.  The crowd is a bit older (I'd say late 30s/early 40s+) and although the dress is business casual, I've seen people wearing much less than their Sunday best. The decor is warm and comforting; very log cabin-esque. The view is lovely regardless of where you are seated (if you get the pond side though, you can see the skyline, which is one of the best in the country if you ask me).

2011-08-09,2.0,"I went here because I wanted to experience delicious organic food in a beautiful setting.  I assumed the service would be good, too.  I was very disappointed.  I went with 2 other diners.  We tried each other's dishes and they were all too salty and I'm not one that is shy of sodium.  We told the waitress about the dishes being over salty and she stared at us wide-eyed and ran off and never came back! I asked another server and explained the situation and he responded appropriately and then never came back. What's going on? I turned around and looked at the chef at the counter. I noticed him sprinkling more salt onto every dish after it comes to the counter ready to be served. Well, I'm not sure if the sous chef was not supposed to season it and that was the chef's job or where the breakdown in miscommunication happened.   I did notice him yelling under his breath at many servers and chefs so now understood the fear in our server's eyes. She and the other server were too afraid to tell him what was wrong. We did not see our server again until the bill (someone else took our dessert order), and I asked to speak to the manager.  He wasn't available. What?! Is this happening? So strange.  I wasn't asking in a hostile tone. I was polite and respectful.  Maybe that was my problem. I should have yelled. I thought that if I asked enough staff members that someone would respond. I was wrong. I paid a lot for this meal and had been looking forward to it.  This is what happens - oversalted and no response?  So, I decided to give them another chance to redeem themselves, and emailed the chef and the main site to explain the situation and how disappointed I was. There was no response back. Not even an automated response. Not only was everything too salty, the service was strange and skittish.   All i wanted was an apology or perhaps a different entree or the same entree without salt. It still upsets me how my situation was handled or not handled. So, if you do go there and something is under-seasoned or over-seasoned (which will happen cause it happened to other friends of ours, too) don't complain.

Seriously folks - the view is amazing! Can't afford the $$$ North Pond Menu? Pack a picnic (and citronella candles) and camp out near the pond. History lesson: The pond adjacent to the restaurant was once used for ice skating! And the building that houses NP was built in 1912 as a warming shelter for the ice skaters.  Then in 1979, during a horrible snow storm, it was used by the City as a warming shelter for the homeless.

We both order fish and they were both outstanding. No room for dessert -as if we needed an excuse to return. SERVICE: Friendly. No one is in a rush here.

TIP: Forget about street parking - North Pond offers valet ($8) for dinner + brunch.

We started out with very interesting cocktails that had the same amount of care in ingredient selection as our food would. I chose the Agua Caliente that had Chile infused tequila amongst other things.  First courses included a corn on the cob soup with lump crabmeat and a stuffed padron pepper. Incredibly fresh tasting and somehow tasted exactly like corn on the cob with butter and salt but in soup form.  Main dish was the Guinea Hen with Merguez sausage, manilla clams, olives, and squash. It seemed like a strange combination of ingredients but the hen with its crispy skin was cooked perfectly and everything worked. Finally a chocolate bomb with mt. rainer cherry salad for dessert finished off the meal in a great way. The wait staff was knowledgable and just as excited about the food as the customers and made great recommendations. This was my birthday dinner that my wife arranged and I was surprised to see my name on top of the menu. They also gave us a copy of the menu to mark the special occasion.  REally an exceptional experience in all ways. Fair warning - I have eaten at my fair share of fine dining restaurants and even with that - there was still a bit of sticker shock.

Service:  Server was nice, but it all seemed a bit put on.  Also, in one of the most surreal dining experiences I've ever had, she sprayed us with saliva when trying to get out the word pistachio while describing one of the desserts.  Nasty.

2011-07-12,5.0,"Just a phenomenal atmosphere in one of the best restaurant locations in the beautiful city of Chicago. All the ingredients are incredibly fresh and the dishes are rotated seasonally so you can never have the same thing twice unless you decide to wait until the next time that the ingredients are in season. At restaurants such as North Pond, you gotta go all out. I ordered three courses, beginning with the Foie Gras. The Foie Gras, while a controversial dish because of the duck maltreatment, was fantastic. I can't compare it to others because it was the first time I ever had it. I came away very impressed. I also had bites of the Pork Rhubarb that a friend ordered, and that was just out of this world. Rhubarb is featured heavily in the Chef's dishes this season, and I totally recommend it as the few gastronomical things that the chef does involves the underrated, sweet Rhubarb. Moving on, I tried the baked/fried cheese and accompanying salad. This was my least favorite meal but again the flavors were on point. A very tasty dish if you are a fan of either of these things. The main dish was the Mango Snapper, a Indian-inspired plate with an amazingly tasty snapper accompanied with coconut rice and mango chutney. Probably one of my favorite dishes that I have ever eaten. Overall, North Pond provides exceptional service and even better food. Also, they typically have their own blend of Intellegentsia coffee (French pressed, of course) but I had the Finca San Jose from Nicaragua....really, really good. Give 'em a shot!

2011-04-18,4.0,"I took my boyfriend here for a milestone birthday.  Overall, it was a very pleasant dining experience. I think we had the best table in the house (probably helped that I made reservations 6 weeks in advance).  We were next to the window; I sat right next to the fireplace and my boyfriend had views of the skyline over the pond.   The service was fine, not great, a little slow in the beginning.  We were not greeted by our server until after we had read the entire drink menu (the restaurant was neither full nor seemingly busy). After taking our drink orders, it took another 10 minutes to actually get our drinks.  After that initial waiting, the service was fine.  In fact, the bus service was great, much better than the server. The food was excellent.  I'm not a foodie by any means, but I do appreciate unique and well prepared foods.  The amuse bouche was not up my alley, as it consisted of beef consumme and I'm a quasi-vegetarian, however the parmesan bite that came with it was delicious.  I ordered the endive salad with citrus, and normally I'm a little hesitant in ordering endive, but this was perfect and the citrus didn't overtake the dish.  My boyfriend tried foie gras for the first time, and I was a little surprised that he was served the entire liver!  I've only seen it as a little mousse or something.  He said that was very different and good, definitely something he wouldn't have normally ordered. For my main dish, I had the halibut, and it was so good.  In fact, I can't say anything bad about the food.  I actually cleaned my plate, and I never do that. However it wasn't a case of ""I got tiny servings and have to stop for a burrito on my way home"" with my plate cleaning.  Both the boyf and I left satiated, but not disgustingly full. The overall ambiance was perfect, the arts and crafts decor is very homey and welcoming.  And it didn't break the bank as much as I was expecting (we ordered individual drinks, not a bottle of wine, and picked our food rather than do the tasting menu), but would easily classify this as a special occasion spot.   A must try!",0.9963,0.798,0.177,0.026,0.5160385005065856

2011-04-07,4.0,"My husband and I were seeking a special restaurant for our one-year wedding anniversary. We looked at all the big players; tru, MK, Alinea. But we were pleasantly surprised to stumble upon North Pond. It seemed like a peaceful oasis away from the hustle and bustle from the city. Honestly, we live nearby and had never actually seen the restaurant before. I think that sold us.  Yes, the setting is gorgeous on the pond. However, when making reservations I requested a table by a window and unfortunately, we were seated probably the furthest away (back near the restrooms). We aren't complainers so we let it slide. After all - it was our anniversary and we didn't need any view besides each other, right?! As we were seated, the menu at our table was personalized for us which was a lovely keepsake.  To start, we both ordered mojito's. I'm not exaggerating - it was the worst mojito I have ever had. It tasted off, like bad vodka. Plus, there was only a flake of mint! The server was SHOCKED when we mentioned it. She looked like we spit in her face and proceeded to preach about how they use only the finest ingredients. I didn't appreciate the speech. She finally offered to bring new ones - but I opted for a glass of wine instead (better be safe than sorry) while my husband decided to give the mojito another shot. His next one was better, but still not great.  As for the food, we ordered the chef's seasonal tasting menu which was just as beautiful as it was delicious. Each course was impeccable, including the additions from the chef. A rabbit eggroll? Don't knock it until you try it! So, despite a few bumps along the way, it truly was the special experience we hoped for. Although I highly suggest avoiding the mojito at all costs.",0.9864,0.788,0.159,0.053,0.6019631378722289

Everything we had was full of potential, but there was 1 thing on each plate that made each dish go over the top and try too hard.   1st course - scallop ceviche, which was super buttery & delicious, but had some crazy pineapple on the side that made it too sweet 2nd course - lobster with cauliflower cous cous, which was so buttery, but there was an AWFUL mandarin puree on the side, which added too much bitterness to the dish, so I pushed it to the side 3rd course - Foie gras in cabbage, which was heaven, but then there were these candied beets on the side that were so sweet - they were sweeter than our dessert! 4th course - Fish dish, I think this was an extra dish the chef prepared that night, and was really good. 5th course - red wine poached ribeye.  This was very good as well, the red wine poaching ended up making the ribeye taste like bacon.   6th course - an extra dessert course with Earl Grey foam.  It was fine 7th course - Dark chocolate mousse cake filled with ancho chile filling, served with banana bread and dark chocolate drizzle to link the entire dish.  This was also very good My husband got the wine pairing for $45, and he was only impressed by 1 or 2 of the wines.  They give you a tasting portion, but since each glass of wine is at least $15, he thought this was a good way to go. All in all, it was fine and we had a great night.  But it shouldn't just be fine for $350!  It should be stellar and amazing.  I think the first 3 dishes just threw us off so badly because the chef went to overboard with the number of ingredients that ended up ruining the flavors of the dish.",0.9949,0.754,0.183,0.062,0.5280050505050504

North Pond is it.  Our meal was pretty near perfect when we came here together.  I had been before, and wanted to take him somewhere I knew would be great for his birthday, so North Pond was the choice.  He's a chef and I thought that they style of menu here would be inspiring.   I love the way they create dishes, based on the pairing of a couple ingredients.  They are pretty much always a hit, and very creative.  North Pond has enough showmanship and modern ingenuity without being difficult, or intimidating like dining at Alinea or somewhere of the like. Thankfully, the price tag isn't as high, either.  Don't get me wrong, it's an expensive meal, but well worth it for a special occasion.  You leave satisfied, and inspired (as I had hoped). We got the tasting menu which I highly recommend.  We added the foie gras dish from the menu to our meal, knowing the BF simply HAD to have foie fo his birthday.  The wine pairing is recommended, although this last time I selected a bottle to go with our meal.  Everything was delicious, not a single bad thing to say about the flavors here! The right amount of time was alotted for each course, and e never felt rushed or that we were waiting with nothing to do.  When our server was unable to bring out a dish himself, the other staff members were right on time and very helpful in describing the dishes.  Must admit, there was one dish towards the end of the meal that we got no explanation for and were pretty bummed...but all in all we felt very catered to and I, being FOH myself, was very impressed. What's also really sweet about North Pond is that if you let them know ahead of time that it is a special occasion, they will print ""Happy Birthday Mabel"" or whatever's appropriate at the top of the menu for you, which is super cute, but doesn't end up seeming cheesy at all.  It makes you feel special for sure.  A nice touch.

We were seated no where near the windows at first, but then I asked for a window seat and they were very accomodating. It was kind of cold in the place but we sat right next to the fire place. The view of the pond and skyline was amazing. Our first course was the scallops and mushroom. The scallops had this tiny bit of hard crust on the edges, and when your tongue hit them it was amazing. Best scallops ever. The mushrooms were also very good soaked in the cream, and the sprouts were fantastic. A little small to split with someone, but still excellent. Our next course was the beef and capers salad. The lettuce part was amazing. The beef was very good, but the capers is what made it amazing. The taste was like no other. The cheese balls on top were ok, but nothing to die for. I got the fluke, lobster for my entree and my GF got beef, beets. Here looked really nice and the beets taste to all the food was extraordinary. She loved it. My lobster and fluke came on top of a bed of tiny lentils with some cherries mixed in that made the most unique but amazing taste. It also had the most flavorful carrots and on top of all this were these patches of bubbles. I'm guessing the bubbles were some cream or butter, but it was so cool. Everything was amazing and so unique. They came out with a little tasting compliments of the chef. It was a tiny sweet potato with this cream that was amazing and tiny little celery peels and a pecan. It was sooo good. Then we got dessert. We got the chocolate, pomegranate. It came with these 3 ho-ho looking things with truffles sticking out of them. They were soooo good. Then it had pomegranate seeds decorated on the sides, and they exploded in your mouth. It then had 2 little pieces of chocolate crumb like cake, with one of the pieces having this Orange sherbert tasting vanilla ice cream. The greatest dessert I have ever had. It all had a orange and pomegranate taste to it. AMAZING. Then we got a personalized dessert compliments of the place. On the plate it said Happy Anniversary in chocolate. It was 2 sugar grape jelly squares, and 2 dark chocolate balls that were amazing. Then we left.

I'm a banana fiend so this was probably the best banana dessert I've ever eaten in my life.

2010-04-09,4.0,"North Pond, yes, as its name suggests, is near a pond in a park north of the Loop. The views are lovely, although I don't know if you can see them from inside the restaurant. The space is kind of small, but it's beautiful. It's an Arts & Crafts style building, probably built around the 20s, originally a warming station for winter ice skaters. It has gone through a few lives before opening a decade (?) or so ago in its current incarnation.  It's not on the tourist track -- I came across it by looking at James Beard nominees, and I am so glad that I did! Our waitress was Gabrielle, and she was perfect, seriously -- knowledgeable, helpful and just so freaking genuinely nice. Once I'd chosen my dish, she made a wine recommendation, and brought me a taste to make sure I'd like it. I did, and it went well with the snapper dish I had. We also tried the orange shrimp appetizer, and the beef parmesan dish (probably the best of our choices). I had the snapper with bacon-infused sweet potatoes and brussel sprouts, and I will be truthful that it was very good, but not outstanding. A lot of the combinations on the menu looked so good, and now I wish I had tried others  -- I bet some of those dishes really do make it into the outstanding category.  This place is a little off the beaten path (at least for someone who is not from Chicago), but I think it was worth seeking out.

2010-03-08,1.0,"This past Sunday my husband and I celebrated his birthday for brunch at the NPC. It was our first time, despite living in the neighborhood my whole life. I called ahead to check if it was acceptable to bring a 3 month old baby. The person I spoke with said it was fine, but to leave the stroller at home because there was very little room in the restaurant. When we arrived the baby was sitting quietly in my carrier. The hostess sat us in the party room that was completely empty. I asked if we could not sit in the area with the fireplace, views of the city and park, where there were at least some people. That room had at least 4 tables available. To my complete surprise, the hostess said ""Unfortunately we are not allowed to have infants or children in there"". Alcohol was served in both rooms so that was not a factor. So we sat alone in this huge room, with a now silently sleeping baby, with a view of the ""grown ups"", for my husbands special birthday brunch. I can understand if the baby was wailing as we walked in, or if children are not desired at this adult establishment, but then we should have been informed of this when we called. Not to mention, the room where we were placed could have fit 50 strollers, so why tell us to leave it at home! Again, I can completely understand that some restaurants are not kid friendly and I can even agree that it can be undesirable in some restaurants. But to not inform us of this when we specifically inquired, to actually mislead us by implying we will be sitting in a tight area, and to not even think of making an exception, seeing the infant was silent and hardly noticeable, is just in very poor taste. Furthermore, the food was just average... We will be having a second celebration elsewhere to make up for this bad experience.

2010-01-16,5.0,"I'm actually reviewing this from Summer 2008, when I last went. What I had: First Course: Foie Gras, Cherries Sautéed Duck Liver, Ancho French Toast, Orange Muscat Early Cherries, Glazed Baby Leeks, Granola I've never had foie gras before, and it was absolutely amazing. I now understand why people want it so much -- and I understand why some people really object to it. There's no way something that fatty could exist normally in nature. The Early Cherries were slightly heated and amazing; the french toast, leeks, and granola couldn't compete for taste and were mainly filler. To start, they served us a spoonful each of a salmon puree, with pickled radishes on the side. It was unbelievable -- an explosion of flavor in the mouth without being overpowering. A perfect start. Salad: Sweet Shrimp, Melon Alaskan Sweet Shrimp, Chilled Parmesan Consommé, English Peas, Cantaloupe, Opal Basil  The thing I remember most about this were the English Peas; now I know how peas not in a can taste. They were slightly crunchy and very delicious. The consomme was...odd. I don't know that I'd do that again. Main Course: Pork, Apricots Roasted Pork Chop, Glazed Boneless Rib, Ancho-Braised Shoulder; Chive Shortbread, Minestra Nera, Apricots This was unbelievable, with the exception of the shortbread, which was too overpowering. The Glazed Boneless Rib was to die for -- tender, flavorful, mouthwatering; the pork chop itself was equally amazing; lightly salted and they let the chop speak for itself otherwise. Extremely tender. The Apricot compote they used was absolutely perfect. Dessert: Raspberries I don't remember what was in this and it's not in The Menu online, but it was: fresh raspberries, raspberry meringue (that was amazing), tres leches cake, and a fanciful twirl of brown sugar lace. Very refreshing, and utterly delicious. Drinks: Cocktail: I can't recall the name, but it was cucumber, gin, thyme, and lemon. And if that sounds disgusting, it shockingly was not. It came salt-rimmed, and was extremely refreshing. The lemon and cucumber competed with the gin, which is good, because I don't like gin's aftertaste. Whomever thought this up deserves a medal. Wine: A nice Merlot, but unremarkable Coffee: A very, very good cappuccino -- with brown sugar sugar cubes! So cool.

I never heard from or saw the manager the entire night.  This whole experience has left a VERY bad taste in my mouth. I am not a picky customer. All it would have taken was a correction of their mistake and I would have left completely happy. Instead, they were stubborn and have lost a customer for life.

I was going to make it 4, but that really doesn't do the restaurant justice -- and the only reason it isn't 5 complete stars is because of a minor preference on tasting menu price. My wife and I went here for a nice dinner out after a long hibernation from dining. We had first eaten at North Pond on Valentine's Day of '06, and it was delightful (not only for the food, but also for introducing me to the Haut-Medoc region). Paraphrased:  - Service was fabulous (although a worker or two was a bit quick to stop by assuming we were done with our dish) - Food was fantastically fresh, well prepared, clean, crisp and delicious - Ambiance is as North Pond in the fall/winter will always be to us -- cozy and comfortably classy - Wonderful winelist Notes: - Bring cash for valet - Please respect the establishment (business casual dress) After setting up a reservation for 6:15, we needed to move it to 6:45 because traffic wasn't looking like it would cooperate. Brittany happily adjusted our reservation for us (she was fantastic throughout the night). We arrived at around 6:20, and decided to relax over a drink at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and not overly talkative -- that perfect amount of conversation and comfort without intruding. He also gave me a taste of a petit bordeaux they had opened, which was a great way to start the night. I had a glass of pinto noir from France, and Theresa had a N/A Clausthaler. We were seated at a comfortable booth near the kitchen, and after some debating and conversation with our waitress Dawn (who was perfectly attentive and knowledgeable), we decided on the tasting menu. We opted-out of the wine pairings, but on her suggestion started with a bottle of white (a Cristom Sauvignon Blanc from Willamette Valley).  1st course: King crab claw, apple-celeriac slaw, applesauce and a warm crab croustillant 2nd course: Lobster claw in brown butter sauce with carrots 3 ways (yellow foam, orange candied, orange grilled) on a charred onion --- filler course: Delicious butternut squash soup with ginger snaps 3rd course: Bay scallops atop polenta w/roasted pears and pancetta bacon  4th course: Lamb medallion with caramelized figs, chanterelle mushroom ragu and a goat cheese ravioli tondi (I opted for a glass of red that Dawn recommended -- initially going with the recommended pairing, but changing it for an italian wine she had found and brought out to taste, thanks!) 5th course: white cake, lemon curd and baton, huckleberry sorbet and malted honeycomb Everything was perfectly prepared, and the portions were wonderful. By the end, I felt perfect -- not too full, not hungry. I thanked the Chef(s) on the way out, and were thankful for the great service once again as Brittany helped us pay for the valet via card, since I had forgotten cash and there was no ATM.  I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews -- perhaps a rotation of bad employees, perhaps people forget that it is business casual and jeans/shorts are to be avoided -- but this place is worth a trip. The only reason it's not 5-stars in my book is because we felt the tasting menu was slightly overpriced. $70-75 would have rolled this just over the hill into no-question-5-star-territory.

I could eat this for every meal for the rest of my life and be quite happy Wild Salmon: Loved the spring herb puree it was swimming in and the aromatic wehani rice made for a nice side. The fish itself was a bit fishy for me, but I'm  just not that into salmon these days. I probably should have gone with the bass my husband ordered, but more about that later. Chocolate, Hazelnut: Served on a plate that said ""Happy Birthday Andrea"" in chocolate...I was in chocoholic heaven! It was too rich for my husband, but that just meant more for me! Nothing better than the combo of chocolate, hazelnut, and salted caramel! Hubby's Meal: Lettuce, Radishes: So fresh, the veggies taste like they came right from the Green City Market (and they probably did). Bass, Potatoes: I should have ordered this delicious fish  for myself Plum Pistachio: My husband kept repeating ""this tastes so powerful"" and it really did. I had a few bites and wasn't sure if I love it or hated it, but it sure was interesting and ""powerful.""

2009-08-23,5.0,"Dining at North Pond should be on everyone's list, whether they are a Chicago native or a visitor to the area.  The setting is about as unique as it gets, and the food is both elegant and down-to-earth with a focus on local ingredients and quality.  I had been dying to try it for years, ever since my dear friend Kirsten F. recommended it to me as her favorite special-occasion spot. Finding it can be difficult - follow the map on the website, or take a cab to Lincoln Park at Lakeview and Deming, then walk down the path to the Arts & Crafts building indicated by the sign.  The building, once a warming hut for ice skaters, is located on a small pond, as the name suggests, and offers a tranquil view of the city.  Once inside, you can appreciate the design details which make it feel like you have gone back in time to some more simple era.  It's a place that you want to dress up for a little, but not so much that you feel like you will be on display in the social pages of a magazine.  It's a place to be gracious and respectable. The service is low-key and informed, and not obtrusive, which is good because this is a place to linger.  In fact, we were wishing that our meal didn't come out quite as quickly as it did, because we could have stayed there all afternoon! The menu items are listed by a simple title, followed a more elaborate description underneath.  I started with the ""Sweet Corn, Bacon"" (Early Season Corn-On-The-Cob Soup, with Crisp Guanciale, Pickled Garlic Scapes, and Uplands Cheese Crisp).  Beautiful, light soup with little flavor surprises.  My lunch date had the ""Tuna, Beets"" (Yellowfin Tuna Crudo-style, Beets, Avocado, Mango; Tatsoi Greens, Sesame Tuile).  This was an absolutely gorgeous dish with little cubed gems of tuna, beets, and mango. For my entree, I had the ""Sole, Capers"" (Sautéed Petrale Sole Filet, House Cured Bacon, Rémoulade Mayonnaise, Caper Lemon Brown Butter) and my lunch date had the ""Trout, Zucchini"" (Grilled, Herbed Rainbow Trout, Ratatouille Vegetables, Pine Nuts, Raisins, Black Olives).  Again, the main flavors were pure and prevalent, with lovely surprise tastes to compliment and accompany the fish. For dessert, we shared the ""Doughnuts, Ricotta"" (Cinnamon- Dusted Ricotta Doughnuts, Bourbon Ice Cream), which was the perfect ending of custardy warm doughnut holes and rich, creamy ice cream. Everything was presented beautifully (see photos), and we enjoyed every bite.  Our server was great in helping us find just the right wines by the glass to accompany our meals, and we were very happy with her suggestions.  After dinner, we received a small packet of seeds for French Beans, as a reminder to give back to the earth - a nice touch. Shortly after leaving, I got a call from the staff letting me know that I had forgotten my pashmina on my chair, which meant that I could simply walk back an retrieve it, rather than having to make a special trip later.  That's great service. It's a excellent choice for a date, lunch or dinner with an old friend, or special-occasion family night out.   I will make it a destination every time I am in Chicago, and can't wait to go back.",0.9989,0.785,0.204,0.012,0.5104308390022675

Initially we had a table of 6 reserved on Open Table.  A few days before we called ahead because we wanted the tasting menu but 1 of us doesn't eat lamb and another isn't keen on salmon.  We also wanted to put a request in for the patio.  My friend needed me to call her after to vent about the woman who answered the phone.  She said ""well your friend can either order 4 courses or skip the lamb and we'll put a note on your rez for the patio""  Apparently the woman was very curt.  Imagine paying $85 for a meal and skipping a course?!  I said not to worry I'm sure the wait person can sort it out.  When we arrived we told them that we lost 3 in our party due to traffic coming in from Madison.  They were cool.  They also allowed for a lamb substitution with fish.  Cool.  The 3 of us got the tasting ($85 each) with the wine pairing (another $45 each).  Before that we wanted a cocktail ($12 each)  We got a few sips into the cocktail when the 1st wine glass arrived.  Then our course which was salmon in some green jelly.  Looked great but flavor/texture was unusual.  Mind you I still had most of my cocktail and now a glass of wine.  From there on out we were rushed.  I felt like college, 2 full drinks in front of me at all times...The food was ok.  I mean, add brown butter to anything and I'll marry it!  The dessert was quite delicious.  But the rushing.  I don't get it.  Then, we didn't even have the dessert yet, and we notified the waitress that one of our missing friends was en route for a drink, and to please bring a dessert menu.  Cool...at first.  Then the dessert was served and we got a ""is she close"" Then we finished but still had a glass of wine each and then some and the manager/sommelier, who didn't stop by once the entire night asked where she was.  I was taken aback.  We were still finishing up!  We were asked a 3rd time and that is when our friend showed up for a glass of wine and the cheese plate.  Given how we were rushed through the entire dinner we didn't feel too horrible.  Plus at this point we were at about $150 a head for the 3 of us w/o tip!   Finally, after we drank our wine, ate our cheese and paid our bill with a 20% tip we walked our tardy friend to the valet.  The valet was sitting in his car.  We got his attention only to be met with ""Its gonna be awhile""   This review should be on REALLY?! with Seth and Amy.

2009-08-16,4.0,"Mother and I strolled over to North Pond for her birthday dinner. They seated us in the back room, which I was grumbling about since I was hoping for a window seat.  The back room reminds me of old-school chicago fancy.  I guess that's a good thing?

The amuse bouche was delicious!  Tuna tartare with cucumber salad.  I wish I could have ordered only that. We ordered prawns for the appetizer.  They were quite yummy, a mix of different flavors (that I can't remember now, sorry), however I thought prawns were supposed to be large.  They were smaller than your average shrimp.  (Ey, booboo!) Mother ordered a Pork dish that was EXCELLENT.  The pork was delicious and tender, accompanied by Kale, andouille sausage, figs (yum)... and others. I got a grassfed beef dish.  It definitely had less fat than usual, but it was also less juicy than usual.  Such is the grassfed variety, overall it was good.  It also came with cauliflower and pine nuts.

2009-08-10,3.0,"Blog for full review. While the bread itself was good enough, the flavor was rather mild and the ice cold butter was nearly impossible to spread - given Chef Sherman's reputation I rather expected a more impressive bread selection. With our waiter arriving with drinks my friend inquired as to whether one portion of a dish could be substituted out and was given a very abrupt ""no substitutions.""  While I told him this would be the case, I did find the waiter's attitude and reasoning a bit condescending - ""we will substitute for allergies but not personal dislikes as the chef is very passionate about his creations.""   Arriving first, a gift from the kitchen - fitting North Pond's two ingredient description this captivating little bite was called Hamachi, Avocado and consisted of a flawless piece of hamachi sashimi with avocado paste served over fresh summer melons and what I do believe was zucchini spiced with paprika and perhaps coriander.  Unexpected flavor combinations in general but certainly showing a deft hand this dish definitely peaked my interest for what was to come.  My friend, not a fan of raw fish, noted ""wow, that was good."" Arriving shortly after the amuse was our shared dish, Charcuterie, Condiments and it featuered House-Made Soppressata, Prosciutto, Chilled Presskopf, Shaved Lardo, Frisée, Candied Pecans, Fig Marmalade, Toast.  Having had all but the Presskopf (a vinegary and excellent headcheese made from steer and cow tongue) I was quite impressed by the selection's myriad flavors and textures with the fatty Lardo (not as good as Batali's at Otto,) Sweet and Spicy Soppressata, and salty/smoky Prosciutto all proving great examples.  While I can't say the single piece of dried raisin toast added anything to the meal, the candied pecans were excellent with strong accents of cinnamon and the fig marmalade was superb.  For added crunch, the cornichons and Frisee were excellent, as well. While we talked and my friend dined, I started on the first of my two small plates, Farm Egg, Tomato - Soft-Boiled Farm Egg, with Grilled Polenta, Red and Gold Baby Tomatoes, Chicken Nuggets, Ancho Bacon Cream, Nasturtium.  Ranging the gamut from crispy and savory polenta to sweet and tart tomatoes, creamy savory bacon cream to sweet and mild nasturtium, and all topped with an incredibly delicate and wonderfully presented soft egg that spilt forth a creamy golden yolk on piercing.  Further enhancing the dish ad added even more ""breakfast"" nuance were the chicken nuggets - literally pieces of ""popcorn"" chicken fried crispy. The second dish, the other savory outside of gnocchi and egg dishes that I'll order pretty much anywhere I go was the Foie Gras.  Foie Gras, Apricot - featuring seared Foie Gras, Rosemary-Poached Apricot, Citrus French Toast, Black Raspberries, Coffee Reduction was actually an excellent dish that arrived from multiple angles.  While the foie itself was good, I will note that there were two prominent veins in the dish that proved tough to cut - the ancillaries, however, were something to behold.  Starting with the Apricot - excellent, I'd have never thought to pair Rosemary with this fruit, yet the effect enhanced both ingredients to a new level.  The citrus French toast, essentially a apricot glazed brioche, was excellent for texture though I do wish there had been more.  Topping all of this, a tangy blend of black raspberries and the very essence of a bold coffee/fruit-sucrose reduction - while the coffee itself honestly didn't add much ""flavor,"" what it did do was create a strong base for the sweets and anchored them to the fatty and rich foie.  A very smart dish. For myself, dessert was Cherry, Vanilla - Frozen Vanilla Souffle, Brown Butter-Pepper Financier Cake, Bing Cherry-Basil Salad, Sour Cherry Sorbet.  A fan of the new-age fashion of adding savories to the dessert course I simply couldn't pass up the basil and pepper aspects of this dish - but unfortunately one of them was a no show.  Featuring a luxurious vanilla ice cream I'm not really certain what was ""soufflé"" about it - moreso a wonderful ice cream sandwich.  Below the icecream was the Financier which although appropriately buttery and tasty sorely lacked anything resembling pepper.  Atop the pseudo-soufflé sat a dollop of wonderfully complex and tangy cherry sorbet while the front of the plate was dominated by the highlight of the dish - poached bing cherries tossed with a balsamic and basil reduction.  While individual components were all good, topping the rest of the dish with the salad was where the money was at. After many hits and a really pricey miss in Chicago, I found North Pond to be somewhere in between.  While the setting and service were good, there is definitely an 'attitude' to this place that somewhat outstrips the consistency of the food that, although good, is not so refined that it comes out unbelievably over and over.  Like a lower end Gramercy Tavern in a much nicer setting.",0.9996,0.748,0.225,0.026,0.6025519859678277

2009-06-22,1.0,"Thoroughly overrated, in virtually every respect, and very overpriced given the lackluster quality of the food, dime-store like main dining room (with its proximity to the kitchen and cheap feel), and unprofessional service. I think this restaurant may simply be a cash cow for a savvy businessman who knows precisely how to part unsophisticated suburban diners from their money, though that said it may very well be the case that many diners know, positive reviews below notwithstanding, that  you're paying for the setting here. Despite this close to ideal setting in the park, this restaurant couldn't seem to do anything quite right on the night we visited. In restrospect, some of the initial signs were not good - the main dining room had an unattractive tile floor covering, tempering its rustic aims, lighting seemed an afterthought, menu covers were faded and corners were frayed, while the wine list included a large number of half-bottles (what is this, the olive garden?). Tacky.  Many of the dishes were more ambitious than I expected, but suffered from weak ingredients and lack of attention to detail. Vegetables were not crisp, beef was of mediocre quality and it--like the rabbit and lobster--somehow tasted like it had been pulled from deep-freeze and microwaved into submission. I should add that our waitress made some noise about the beef being of especially high quality, but it was clear to me at least that it was not.  The service was sluggish, unprofessional, and failed to demonstrate the attention to detail and crispness that you expect at a restaurant in this price range. Empty wine glasses went unnoticed for 10 minutes, plates were left on the table for longer, our hostess became visibly irritated when we asked to be moved because we were initially seated too close to the very kitchen, and beef was not cooked as requested.  Our waitress was pleasant and nicely down-to-earth (she reminded me of a slightly absent-minded old aunt), but seemed inexperienced and seemed to be much more positive about the food than warranted. In particular she heaped praise on wines that turned out to be mediocre, not to mention overpriced for the quality. In short, not recommended, though it would have clear potential with some improvements (this is the reason why I am taking the time to write this review). Finally, I would also add that it is absurd that, at least when we visited, there was no outdoor seating.

The type of place where if you see something on the menu you've never tried, you should try it, because it will be cooked to perfection.  The first time I ever ate rabbit was at North Pond; I had the Rabbit Three-Ways and it was unbelievable. The quail was also outstanding. They have a very complete wine list and we have had the waiter recommend several wines in the past that are inexpensive and go well with the food.

It was a mix of pork chop with pork belly that quite frankly lacked flavor; especially once you have experienced pork belly in places such as Boka or Perennial (the latter has mastered pork belly). I did try the duck entrée that someone else had and whoa!!! Hellooo perfection. The disappointment again was the hostess. Our friend had made the reservation for six. I went in personally a few days prior to see if it was possible to increase the number to eight.

2009-03-21,3.0,"Framing: My partner and I went to this restaurant for a late Saturday dinner. We had read about it in Chicago Magazine. I was a bit nervous because the woman that called to confirm the reservation was a bit snooty so I expected the restaurant to be the same. Luckily, it was not at all. Final bill was around $220 for food, desert, and wine. My story: The location is quite scenic and I can only imagine how beautiful it would be during the summer. The ambiance is nice and the food was pretty good. The portions will look small to you but they are actually perfect and you go home full. This is no Rosebud or Tuscany on Taylor, so you will not bring home leftovers! I had the squab dish which was quite flavorful. Dave had the skate entree which was amazing!! As an appetizer, I had something that tasted like a cookie with melons on top of it. It was good, but I would not recommend it.  Dave had the apple char salad which was another interesting concoction that neither of us would exactly reocmmend. The waiter paired wine for us and did a pretty good job, and the desrts were phenomenal. I had a breadpudding (don't even think it will be anything like breadpudding you have had before. totally different in everyway) while Dave had a chocolate dish that was rich and quite tasty with a buttery ice cream on top. No matter how hard you try, it is unlikely you can leave dinner here spending less than $100 per person. So, if you're hungry and looking to stretch your money, go to Wild Fire for dinner and walk through Lincoln Park just before or afterward.  If looking for a special place for a birthday or anniversary dinner, this would be a nice place.  There are DOZENS of restaurants in Chicago with better food than North Pond, but few with such a unique location and ambiance.   (For reference, I consider the food quality, portion size, service, value for price, and quality of view/decor of North Pond the same as sixteen in Trump Tower)",0.995,0.785,0.174,0.04,0.6146598639455784

First of all, the location for this restaurant is perfect.  No nearby traffic, no horns, no ambulances, just a park and a pond.  And I do love how it's decorated inside.  Very warm and inviting.  That being said, the food is what brings people back.  And this place did not disappoint.  The brunch was amazing.  The 3 course menu allows a few options of each course and I started with the french toast with bacon, moved onto the grass fed beef and finished with a chocolate mousse.  I really enjoyed the taste of everything and how all courses were presented.  It's almost too pretty to eat...but not too pretty ;)  You can tell they put effort into making things just right.

My wife had the Farm Egg with Sweetbreads. When done poorly, sweetbreads can be chewy & uninspired. These were well-cooked and augmented by dates with a wonderful spiced sauce. My wife had a prosciutto & pear salad and I had a kampachi and apple salad. They were both very good. But I can only get so excited about the salad course! My main course of squab with spinach had perfectly cooked medium-rare squab with a slightly sweet huckleberry reduction that was inspired.  My wife's duck was perfectly cooked but almost was outshone by a roasted pineapple that made the fruit taste better than I could have imagined. Our desserts had highlights of creme-fraiche ice cream, brown-butter crumble, maple ice cream, and apple gelees. Our dinner was definitely one of our favorites in the city.

Just a hint- if you drive- North Pond sits between Cannon Drive and Lakeview Drive (the address is deceiving). The valet is actually located on Lakeview at Deming (look for the small sign).  We went on a Thursday night. When making the reservation, we requested a table by the window but alas, they could not guarantee that unless we got there early. So early it was and we got the perfect table overlooking the pond with the city shining in the distance.  The arts and crafts styling the the interior was warm and welcoming. The fireplace in the corner cheerily welcomed us and the attention to detail was lovely. Hard to believe that this was once the warming house for ice skaters on the pond!  As for the food- American in style- it is all sourced locally and most of it is organic. And such interesting taste combinations. I started with the scallop and sunchoke appetizer. Very tasty. Moving on to the prosciutto and pear salad I could have stopped there but the entree of pork done three ways was calling to me.  Oh- and don't expect to have your favorite libation by name here. The beer is all craft style, and even the liquor names eluded me. But your servers will do their best to find something similar to what you like from their list of smaller distilleries.  Service was impeccable. We even got a complimentary glass of Muscato to go along with our dessert choice (maybe this was because I was ""outed"", as one of the servers is a Yelper who actually recognized me!)  Whatever the reason, North Pond is one of those places that is perfect for a special occasion. But my advice? Don't wait for a special occasion to go.

To discuss the deliciousness of the food seems kind of unnecessary, because it all was wonderful.  By dessert, we were all full, but all managed to order just one more thing each.  I had the grapes & yogurt, which was absolutely amazing and melt-in-your mouth.  I don't usually like desserts, but couldn't help myself - I wanted to lick my bowl clean.  Also outstanding - the pumpkin & ginger, the fig & corn (ordered to taste what cornbread ice cream was like), and the chocolate & pine nut.

Now if you say you are open at time X then I expect to be in and seated and perusing the menu within a minute or two of that time.  They kept us sitting in the bloody lobby for 20-25 minutes which is totally unacceptable.  I mean it's not as if their opening time varies you open and should be ready at that time not piss off customers who are hungry.  At minimum they should have served complimentary coffee of something. Anyway we got sat down about 30 minutes after we arrived and I noticed then that the dress code was relaxed for brunch.  This sucks and they should state on their outside menu that the no jeans policy does not apply for brunch.  Luckily I had cords on so no biggie but it would have seriously annoyed me if I turned up all posh to find other types in jeans.   Things got better after we sat down although it still took us a good 10 minutes before our server came over but once the orders started things started to get better.   I didn't know what to expect so I didn't realise the brunch was a 3 course set price affair at about $35.  I didn't see their brunch menu on the window when I walked past so this was a bit of a surprise.  Ultimately it was worth it though as it was a lovely experiece and the food was great.  Lots of interesting flavours, textures and intensities spread out over an hour or so.   Of course we couldn't get a glass of champagne till after 11am, its kind of a stupid law to be honest, I mean I can see why perhaps you might have a law like that in liquor stores but not a restaurant.   I would have given them 5/5 but they lose a star for messing me about when I arrived.  I would recommend this place and they also take reservations for Brunch, we didn't have reservations but were the first people there.  It was quite empty till 11:15-11:30 so dont feel you need to get there at 10 when we arrived.",0.9894,0.809,0.136,0.055,0.5419590643274854

It was complex, creative and unique - I wish everything else had lived up to the dessert.  The service also left much to be desired. Our waiter never checked back to see how the food was and it took a long time to order. And don't get me wrong, we weren't in a hurry at all.

2008-05-27,5.0,"Yes- North Pond is soooo romantic and nice!  It is at 2600-ish North Cannon Drive, just north of the Peggy Notebart museum and Lincoln Park Zoo.  It is a building right in the middle of Lincoln Park that was originally built to be a warming house for ice skaters in Lincoln Park.  It was re-done in the very-Frank-Lloyd-Wright-prairie-style a few years ago.  The menu changes daily and is entirely organic fruits, vegetables and meat products.  It is not the best for the vegetarians (in the winter/early spring season)- there is a lot of duck, veal, pork and beef- but it is organic, so you don't feel so bad about eating meat... If you're still vegetarian and looking to go- I would recommend going in the summer when there would be more fruit/vegetable options.  All their menu comes from local sources- they even list where each beverage is brewed and guarantee that all their ingredients are from local farmers. We had a really nice dinner and felt really special when they brought out the customized menu and dessert plate!  (When you make the reservation- and you MUST make a reservation- they ask you if it is a special occasion- that's how they must've known to do all that for us) For all of this- it is a bit pricey, but really not that bad!  Our appetizers were between 10 -18 (I got the foie gras at 18).  Our bottle of wine was not the best, but incredibly tasty at 60.  Our entrees were 30- 35. I highly recommend it and would certainly go back for our next special occasion or to impress out-of-town guests.",0.945,0.808,0.129,0.063,0.4290972222222222

I've been lucky enough to dine here more than once and it's been consistently delicious.  I also enjoy the design and location. North Pond is housed in what was formerly a warming shelter for skaters. While all traces of its former use are gone, the warmth within the four walls still remains. With its simple and elegant Arts & Crafts design, North Pond oozes charm and comfort. And the view is quite lovely. A few more items that make North Pond exceptional: its efforts to provide sustainable cuisine by partnering with local farmers whenever possible as well as its support of local charities like Deborah's Place (who works to provide homeless women with shelter and support), the North Pond Conservation Council (and organization that partners with the Chicago Park District in the management of the North Pond Nature Sanctuary), and the Chef's Council (which supports sustainable cuisine). They also promote a Charity of the Month in their newsletter.

The interior is quite charming, arts & crafts and with integration of local elements. Our server was excellent, friendly and knowledgeable but not too familiar.

We were visiting for the weekend from LA and made an advance reservation.  The address listed is not really the correct address, as it puts you onto the backside of the restaurant, which normally wouldn't be an issue, but we were navigating a rental car through snow and ice, so that left us a little baffled.  We parked on the street and trudged through mud, snow and ice to get to the front door.  My suggestion if you don't know the driveway would be to call the restaurant for an alternate address. Once inside, you feel as if in a contemporary Colorado ski lodge.  On a spring or summer day or evening, I'm sure the views out onto the lake are beautiful.   We sat in the main dining room with a nice front row seat to the open kitchen.  Controlled chaos was dying down as we had a late 9:30 reservation.  We started with squash, black truffle and walnut soup.  I saw the truffles, but couldn't taste or smell them in the dish.  When asking our server if there were truffles in the soup, she looked quite shocked and confirmed the presence of the truffles.  Hmmm.... I've tasted truffles before, and i'm not quite sure how my taste buds could miss that one. In trying to put the mystery of the tasteless truffle aside and enjoy the remainder of our meal, we moved onto main courses.  Tobin with a steak and me with sturgeon.  My fish was very enjoyable with inventive touches and lots of different flavors including pomegranate and leeks and yummy pork belly...salty and sweet, best of both worlds.  The fish was cooked perfectly, moist in the center with a little crispy flakiness on the outside.  Tobin's steak was good, nothing to write home about.  Dessert was two eclairs, one with pumpkin creme, the other pomegranate caramel.  I took one bite each and was then done.   Overall, this was a nice experience, but maybe by being spoiled with great, fresh west coast cuisine, i wasn't blown away like i should have been.  Have i grown too spoiled?",0.9975,0.792,0.18,0.028,0.5753174603174604
2007-12-03,3.0,"For our 6-month wedding anniversary (yeah I know, but it only comes once!) I told my husband to chose a place for brunch or dinner and suprise me, but to try to keep it under $100 for food and drink.  Sunday morning he told me we were going to North Pond for brunch and based on all the rave reveiws, I was really excited.  It's a darling little place with a great view of the city. We arrived early so we sat at the bar and had a drink -  a mimosa for him and a spiced pear for me. The pear drink was fantastic, though our bartender made me a bit uncomfortable. She was very quiet, almost timid to the point where I felt like I was being loud just talking in a normal voice.  We moved over to our table and our waiter was the same way. Flat, quiet, he almost seemed...medicated. Throughout our meal we noticed the other servers, food runners and bus boys  were all the same. I appreciate professional, non-intrusive service, but I also appreciate a bit of personality. Lighten up - it's brunch! They wrote happy anniversay Dan and Katie on our menus, and gave us copies to keep which was a nice touch. We started with another round of mimosas and asked how the pacing of the courses was. Since this was our big anniversary brunch  we didn't want it to be over immediately. Our waiter said it was ""a good pace"". Since that was an entirely not helpful answer, my husband told him that we wanted to take our time, not having the next course come out immediately when we were done with the first, maybe wait 5 minutes.  Since he was starving Dan also asked if there was a bread basket or anything we could start on. Our waiter said there was no ""actual basket"" but after we placed out order we would get scones. We got one small scone, though it was tasty.  I started with the butternut squash soup with goat cheese. It was fantastic, nice and creamy and the goat cheese gave it a little something extra. Dan had the ""sausage, egg"" which was sausage on a bed of creamy polenta topped with a poached egg. He liked it but I didn't care for it.  We then moved on to a bottle of prosecco. After it was poured the waiter took the bottle away and came back periodlically to refill our glasses.  At first I though it was a bit annoying as a few times I had to wait for a refill, but it helped us make the bottle last for the rest of the meal, so it worked to our benefit.   We waited about 20 minutes for our next course. After 10 minutes they brought out a small plate of the peeky toe crab salad which was suprisingly good. I'm not sure if everyone got that, or if it was because our food was taking a while.  For the next course I had the hangar steak (perfectly cooked medium rare, tender, juicy and served with a nice sauce) with kale and barley (eh). Dan had the french toast with pheasant and cranberries. He'd asked about the pheasant - was it a breast? The waiter said it was pulled pheasant. It came out as a breast, which was fine but showed that our waiter didn't know the menu that well.  The french toast was wonderful, soaked in syrup and the pheasant was tender and had a great flavor as well.  For dessert Dan had the pumpkin cream and I had the mint and chocolate cookie. The pumpkin cream was a layer of mousse topped by spice cake topped by whipped cream. It would have been fantastic had there just been more cake. Once it was gone, it was just plain pumpkin mousse. My mint cookie was dissapointing. It was a block of ice cream - mint on one side and chocolate on the other, topped with a bit of whipped cream. The ""cookie"" was only present where the two ice creams met.  The portions were the perfect size - small by some standards (ridiculously huge restaurant portions) but actually the correct size for a healthy meal. The bowl of soup was big, but the hangar steak portion was probably about 3 ounces and the desserts would be called mini in most restaurants. It was perfectly enough  - we left satisfied, not hungry but not stuffed.  Also I was suprised, given that jackets are required for dinner, to find people at brunch in jeans and sneakers. Brunch is a more casual affair but I still thought some level of formality was expected. I had thought about wearing a fancier dress (I ended up in a wool long -sleeved dress with tights and cute shoes) and I am glad I didn't - I would have felt over-dressed.  Overall, I though the food was GOOD - good, quality ingredients, simple food prepared well -  but it wasn't spectacular.  I think the food was definately worth the price of $32 each for 3 courses, but I think they overcharged on the alcohol. $75 of our bill was for a bottle of processeco and 4 drinks.  At first I thought I might come back and try dinner, but  not if dinner would put us out $300. Based on the food I had for brunch  I just don't think it would be quite worth it.",0.9989,0.824,0.145,0.032,0.4981646825396825

2007-01-03,4.0,"I've been looking for a romantic restaurant for my BF and I to celebrate our anniversary so we decided on North Pond. The past reviews by other Yelpers were very accurate: * Atmosphere: The Chicago skyline behind the pond was beautiful. It was a little foggy but I can't pin that against the restaurant. The decor of the restaurant was very soothing, not too stuffy, very intimate and comfortable. * Food:  For what we paid, the food wasn't that great. My BF has the sirloin which was pretty good. I had the SeaBass with scallops which I wasn't very fond off. Too fishy and salty for me. The dessert was amazing though, very delicous * Details: I loved their attention to detail, the dessert place and the menu had a note to us celebrating the special occassion I probably won't come back for seconds, but it definitely is a place you need to try at least once.",0.9907,0.706,0.251,0.043,0.578560090702948
2006-12-15,4.0,"I love the atmosphere in this place, but I don't think the food is as excellent as I'd like it to be.  My husband, father and I went there for my husband's birthday this year and went there a few years ago for something special (can't remember what).  It is a truly unique place in that you don't get to feel like you're tucked away in a special parky place in the city very often.  At the same time that you feel like you've gotten away from it all, there are some nice city views from there, so you can appreciate this wonderful city that we all live in.  Plus, historically, it's an interesting building and the design is charles rene mackintosh (sp?) inspired. The staff there was great when we were there in June.  I let them know ahead of time that it was my husband's birthday and they gave us special menus with ""Happy Birthday Andrew!!"" typed across the menu.  It was so cute and such a special little touch that was not expected.  We all really got a kick out of it.   So what didn't I like?  I didn't think the food was all that.  It was good enough (certainly not so bad that it ruined our night or anything), but it was not as pectacular as I'd like -- especially since it is, as so many have mentioned, more expensive than average.  I can see that I'm not the only one who thinks this, which is helpful to know, since I can never tell if it's just me (because I'm a vegetarian and don't always get the main fare at a place) or not.   In short, if you want a special location to go to, do go here (if you have the cash for it).  You will get interesting food and a great atmosphere, but you won't get mind-blowing food.  However, if you're looking for really, really good food, or inexpensive fare, I would not recommend this place.",0.9988,0.707,0.276,0.017,0.602281746031746
2006-12-01,4.0,"I have been to North Pond three times now - twice for drinks and once for dinner. I would say that it is one of the must -try places for people who live in Chicago, simply because of the history and location. The restaurant is beautiful and very elegant. There's a great view of the skyline and the pond out front. Try to get a table in the front room if at all possible.  The one thing I would really commend this restaurant on is their attention to detail and customer service. I went there with my family for my graduation dinner. After we were seated we noticed that the hostess hadn't given us menus, which we thought was a bit odd. A few minutes later, our server finally came out with menus and we opened them up we saw that they had been custom-printed to say ""Congratulations Lindsey."" I thought that this was a really nice touch. Naturally, I wanted to save one as a memento, but it wasn't going to fit in my purse. No need to worry - the server came back with all of the menus in a special envelope so they wouldn't get bent without my even asking.  They also have a cute little bar up front that I like to come to on occasion, but beware the drinks are REALLY expensive and REALLY strong.",0.9676,0.819,0.136,0.045,0.5730952380952381
2006-11-23,4.0,"North Pond is a wonderful restaurant to dine with your lover, your family, or your best of friends.  The experience lends to a feeling of comfort and warmth of memories of the past. I spent the week, scouring the restaurants of Chicago in search of the perfect place to dine and look into his eyes.  To have the pleasure of succulent delights fill me with an experience that I've been seeking. Chicago is a wonderful city, but I'm from San Francisco, I want organic, I want sustainable food that is regionally produced, consciously created and wrapped up in a nice little presentation for the epicurean. Dropped off at Deming and Lakeview, we took a short stroll, hands interlocked, under the bridge and through darkness to find a arts and craft style that reminds me of a 1920s craftman house . The cold wind was barreling through me, as he pulled me close and nestled in his arms we rush inside to find warmth from the hearth and a view of the pond glistening with the lights of the city...  We reminisced about Tavern on the Green and I smiled in a coy, slightly subtle yet purposeful way.  Dinner was delightful, timed to perfection and embodies the organic qualities that I have sought since my first day in Chicago.",0.9918,0.775,0.214,0.011,0.5802083333333333

The service was outstanding--we were never rushed, were welcome to just sit and take it all in before we even ordered our drinks... The food was superb and its presentation lovely.  I could write every single detail of the evening and meal and I wouldn't come remotely close to capturing the experience.  If only we had more gift certificates!   I'm saving pennies for our next meal there, and it will be worth every single one.",0.991,0.729,0.241,0.03,0.5459956709956709
2006-07-05,5.0,"First time at North Pond. Steven was our server. The food was great. I especially enjoyed the foie gras and rhubarb, scorn me if you will, but it's still legal. We did the seasonal tasting menu and wine pairing - all very interesting. Steven answered all of our questions, provided lots of great information on the wine and really made it a relaxing evening. The apricot tart/brown butter ice cream dessert is not to be missed.   I love how the ingredients are local and seasonal.  I also enjoyed that another server came by and showed us the cooking technique being used on an upcoming course.  Some sort of hen steamed in a wrap inside this cute little kettle.  I love interesting food like this - good without being so weird you're a little freaked out.  Can get a bit pricey, so I would recommend it for special occasions ... although I've heard they do a fairly reasonable brunch.  We will definitely be back.",0.9965,0.639,0.327,0.034,0.5527380952380951

2006-04-26,5.0,"I had forgotten this but looking at their website, I remembered reading this while dining there: ""The menu at North Pond is designed to feature products raised or grown in their native environment and offered at their seasonal peak."" It just gave me another reason to like the place, but as other reviews have said, this is a place to be reserved for special occasions. I have a feeling a number of engagement proposals have occured here.  I went to North Pond for a firm dinner back in November. The setting is unparalleled in the city. It's both a treat and a retreat. North Pond is a cozy space that seems much smaller than it actually is since it's divided into separate rooms to provide a more intimate feel. The service was exceptional and the entire menu was well thought out and executed. Prior to appetizers being brought out, a tasting portion of pork belly (I believe), was placed in front of us. Since I only eat poultry, I politefully declined. Since my memory fails me here, I remember I had some sort of a cold duck appetizer which I very much enjoyed. For dinner, I had squab for the first time and it was mouth-watering. I've heard that squab is extremely gamey but I didn't find it any moreso than duck which is a favorite of mine when cooked just right. The desserts were downright decadent and afterwards a square of star anise chocolate was brought out while the bill was being prepared. I slept like a baby when I arrived home and dreamed of being able to afford to eat here whenever I'd like.",0.9872,0.838,0.143,0.018,0.5847943722943723
2006-04-17,2.0,"Mediocre, at best. I have traveled to so many fine dining establishments in tis country and I currently live in Northern California: the home of the seasonal, fresh ingredient movement.  North Pond has a long way to go to live up to the level of freshness, flavor and flavor cominations that are available at other season fresh restaurants. We were there for a holiday dinner in early December, The meal was overly salty and all of hte flavors on hte plate ran together with no distinction or pizazz. we had heard great things and were so thoroughly disappointed in hte meal. The saving grace: this gorgeous spot and the comfort of the interior decor. I would never recommend North Pond nor would I eat there again.",0.9625,0.752,0.193,0.056,0.5449999999999999

2005-10-31,5.0,"North Pond's location is probably the most beautiful dining destination in Chicago, situated in the middle of Lincoln Park in a 1920s/30s vintage boat (or field?) house.  The interior is tastefully decorated in an Arts & Crafts style.  Entrees are not cheap, I think they are all around the $30 range, for my last visit I opted for a 5-course ""tasting"" menu which costs about $75, which seems pricey but actually was not bad considering that you might spend that much anyway ordering appetizer/salad, entree, and dessert ala carte.  Each course of the tasting menu offered a nice variety different dishes in small portions, each dish I sampled was very flavorful & delicious. Dining at North Pond is an event in itself, it's not the kind of restaurant where you should expect to stop in for a quick bite on the way to a movie or show, service is professional but not rushed, dishes are not mass-produced but prepared individually with great care.  Diners seem to appreciate taking their time in savoring each course.  North Pond would be a bit expensive as any sort of ""regular"" dinner destination, but for special occasions where you are willing to spend a few extra $$ for outstanding food, service & atmosphere, it is definitely a worthwhile experience.",0.9923,0.791,0.189,0.02,0.4944878839109608
