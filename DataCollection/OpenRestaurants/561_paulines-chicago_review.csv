It's been around for decades in different iterations but it's always served the Ravenswood/West Andersonville neighborhood well. I went with my partner yesterday for a lovely breakfast on their beautiful patio (they always have a couple of parrots out there--that's right, parrots!). The food is incredibly affordable with HUGE portions, and I had a tasty veggie omelet with potatoes and toast for $8.95. Great coffee, too! We had great and super-friendly service--absolutely no complaints. The interior is quirky and eccentric, with all kinds of fun knick-knacks and tchotchkes. Yes, please!

The waitstaff was great and totally on top of the coffee refills. The coffee had a strong nutty flavor, but was good. They have all of the basics plus a bunch of interesting choices on the menu for breakfast. The banana bread french toast was delightful. It was sweet and fresh. The pepper bacon eggs benedict was surprising as the sauce had a lot of herbs in it. It all worked together excellently with the salt and peppery bacon.  The bacon was diced and plentiful so you could have bacon in every bite. The eggs were perfectly cooked wuth liquid gold yolks that were large enough to cover every bite too. I loved that the benedict was in its own plate/bowl so the sauce and yolk was easy to sop up with the english muffins. Overall a great experience!",0.996,0.698,0.302,0.0,0.5882783882783884

Pauline's Potatoes are some basic and tasty breakfast potatoes. They come with the Mexican Omelette which I like - comes with guacamole, sour cream, and salsa. Always a fan, but it's outshines by their French Bread Pudding Toast. It's soft, sweet, sometimes you get a bit of cranberry in a bite. Served with dollops of whipped cream, fresh strawberries, a cranberry compote, and syrup. Probably adds up to two or three thick pieces of French toast, but comes in six rectangular slices. Art. On your plate. For your taste buds. I've also had the banana bread French toast but don't recall much of it compared to the bread puddin'.  My mom always gets pancakes and they are huge.

I'll still eat here, but it would be so much more pleasant if someone like that commiserating waiter would not lash out so ruthlessly in a public setting (earshot of everyone in the restaurant) against his colleagues, even if there is some truth.  His conduct was completely unprofessional and only made me feel like he is a very angry person.  Not something I want to ever endure when I'm here to simply start my morning.",0.9169,0.804,0.131,0.065,0.6166170634920635

She rolled her eyes when we asked a simple question, rushed us, and was annoyed when we inquired on whether or not we could do separate checks. Many of us ordered pancakes with our meal and when they were brought out, it was simply pancakes on a plate; no whipped cream or strawberries as the menu promised. We then saw many other pancake plates coming out of the kitchen topped with generous amounts of whipped cream and strawberries. We decided to ask another waitress about it and she was surprised that our waitress hadn't given us any! Also my toast was stale as if she gave me someone's old toast that didn't get eaten the day before, it was disgusting. I feel like all of the misfortune throughout this Pauline's visit can be traced back to our awful and rude waitress. I'll definitely go back because it's good food overall, but I will be praying that I don't get that waitress again.",0.8534,0.742,0.149,0.109,0.49433106575963714

2015-05-11,4.0,"We go to Pauline's often since it's the closest breakfast place near us. Let me break it down for you: 1. Atmosphere: Pauline's has a very 50's, kitschy, diner-type feel to it. In my opinion, it is the most endearing quality about this place. It even comes with its very own regular who seems to be there almost everyday, sitting outside if the weather is nice, with his parrots. It's a fun place to bring visitors from out-of-town because they always seem to be taken by this place, partly due to the cuteness factor and partly because it doesn't seem like your typical tourist destination. I think it makes them feel like they are eating at a hole-in-the-wall, although I'm pretty sure the secret has been out for quite some time now... 2. Food: Considering they are open until 3pm, they also have a lunch menu, but I haven't been impressed with anything on it. If you're going here, I would stick to breakfast.  The fresh squeezed juices are nice. The pancakes and french toast are both very good. The omelettes are huge, but just okay, in my opinion. They come with a side of potatoes which are very good. Try them with the spicy ketchup!  3. Value: I'm not really sure how I feel about the prices. The portions are quite large, but I feel like this is the kind of place that you'd expect to be able to get cheap, standard breakfast fare and it's definitely not cheap. The coffee is bottomless, but it's nothing to write home about. Just your standard run-of-the-mill diner coffee, but that's all I can really ask for from a place like this.",0.9792,0.829,0.131,0.039,0.5524165050635638

Their omelettes are quite good and come with a side of potatoes, which makes them reasonably priced. The potatoes, however, are a hit and miss. They're usually too mushy and flavorless. Not a fan.

Everything's cooked on a big griddle, with short-order cooks constantly in motion. The nice surprises are the fresh made juices - they'll juice anything! Try the beet, carrot & orange! - and the sunny, dog-friendly patio on a quiet corner (minus the occasionally passing Metra). Pauline is evidently a big dog lover, because there are also photos of dogs up for adoption posted all over the restaurant. It's cash-only, but has an ATM.

No, I'm not kidding.  The noise was so disturbing that I asked my waitress what it was.  She said, deadpan, ""They are killing the pigs to make bacon.""

Based on some reviews I checked the latter for wet or dirty spots - nope, clean as a whistle. We were waited on and served promptly and got water and coffee refills. The papaya orange juice came in a mason-jar mug and was delicious. I didn't get the coffee but my friend remarked it was good. The French toast and strawberries I ordered was perfectly fine. Was it the most spectacular French toast I've ever tasted? No, it cost $7.25 and I wouldn't expect it to be. The Pauline's potatoes were also yummy. I can't speak for their eggs and bacon since I don't eat either. Except for some overzealous plate-clearing (when a diner still has a fork in their hand, it's safe to assume they are not finished with their meal), the service was efficient. Neither neglectful nor overly solicitous. The check was not brought out unacceptably early. You have to pay your bill up at the cash register. They have pictures of dogs available for adoption on the walls and water bowls for pooches outside: bonus points.

Need to upgrade the product and execution. Pumpkin pancakes didn't have any pumpkin flavor. Menu wasn't as interesting as the original spot. Service--the place wasn't super busy but he never came around to check on us, refill coffee, etc..and was working the register, etc... Tables--our party of 6 was at two small round tables. No one was comfortable or had enough room.  There has to be a better option for a group of 6.  Breakfast is fun with groups.

2013-09-14,4.0,"when you step onto this place, its like you are going back in time. I like to refer to this as a retro breakfast place. They also have a patio. But in order to experience the full experience of this place one should really be sitting indoors.  It was a good thing I brought my appetite on my last visit because I had a 5 egg tomato and goat cheese omlette. They take their food very seriously here because my relatives who were with me ordered the pancakes let me taste it and it was super sweet with loads of sugar and syrup...As if that was not enough they put whipped cream on it with the heavy cream that was already on top of it. I guess we should be ready to consume our weeks RDA of sugar products in one meal...It's a tough life, I tell ya. If you dont want to have a coma before the end of the day than you should order the egg omlettes with just the whites,potatos and toast. The last time I was there they took out the toast for me and put in fruit instead. They wait staff seems verypatient with everyone. As I have been here many times in the last 15years, I can remember no time when I felt rushed by anyone to make up my mind what I odered or how long I wanted to stay. Just an observation. The hot chocolate is made in a different way here than in most places. I want to leave this as a surprise for anyone planning to make it out here. Although it is by the metra tracks it has this feel like it is off the beaten path but really it is not. If you want a good place to compare it to, maybe TEMPO on Chestnut and State is a good one although this place has way more options. But not many people can get here during the week because we all don't live in Andersonville and it closes at 3PM Maybe it is overdone or maybe it is not-depends on your mood . If you have visitors from the east coast, I would advise you bring them here because the chances they have a place like this in Hoboken,NJ are very slim. Plenty of food to chose from that is under $11 when ordering with coffee. That's before taxes.",0.9618,0.898,0.075,0.028,0.45059523809523805

I was a little surprised, because I was expecting crab cakes benedict, but it's my fault for not reading the menu properly. It was essentially a traditional eggs benedict with crab instead of ham. It was very tasty though and I really liked the fresh fruit that came with it.

We were ridiculously full and still kept going 'til our plates were empty. Each agreed the other's omelette was wonderful (while secretly thinking ""but mine is a little better""). Potatoes were equally good although I could have stood for them to be a little crispier but that's a personal preference which they are by no means required to fulfill. Unfortunately service is ensuring this place is only getting 3-stars. Our server was not friendly at all and in fact bordered on surly. She also neglected to get my order right. Maybe it was the kitchen. Maybe it was because she was just barely paying attention when I ordered. Who knows. Since I was starving and didn't want to make a fuss I just ate around what I can't eat. Coupled with her attitude and the general manner in which she treated us, it marred an otherwise perfectly lovely breakfast. The place is cute. Obviously popular.

My daughter's eggs were good as eggs go-- but we asked for them first and that was a no go.  It took someone ten minutes to come by with coffee and water.

Though, am I naive to think that if you put it on your menu, it should be superb? Also, the hollandaise sauce was more like watery cream sauce. No tang, no buttery salty-ness. almost an afterthought. And can we send out a memo that says, ""Please toast the english muffins under the benedict?"" come on........soggy muffin is gross under fishy smelling salmon.  The man got the Lumberjack breakfast plate. Lots of eggs, their signature potatoes, and a strip steak. The potatoes are good, but not really much to write home about, and the steak was ridiculously over-seasoned and cheap quality.  The orange juice was freshly squeezed and delicious, but thats about the only positive in this breakfast.  Oh, and btw, only cash???? What is this 1977?",0.8554,0.786,0.126,0.087,0.6346418732782367

Sausage...you know if you were to put a sausage link in the microwave, and the middle is barely cooked and the ends have the hell cooked out of them...all hard and overcooked? That's what my sausage was like. Not sure if they were microwaved or not. If so, I'm perfectly happy waiting a little longer to have it grilled. Toast...had a greasy/grill taste, as if it were cooked on the grill and not in a toaster. Maybe that's why the sausage was microwaved, cuz the toast was hogging up the whole grill.

Ann Sather's has a similar potato dish done right. And what the crunk is up with the lumberjack portions? I think most people would prefer quality over quantity.  The prices are ridiculously inflated. With my 3 eggs, potatoes, toast, bacon, hotcakes (which, actually, were very good) and OJ, my bill came out to $20.25!

We were seated right away which was nice because I was starving. Our waitress took our orders quickly. I started with the freshly squeezed orange juice. I've been sick so I could just a shot of Vitamin C. I went with the special of the day which was scrambled eggs, French toast, and potatoes. Not bad! Pretty straightforward food. I can't say I was blown away or disappointed, but it was fairly basic. I'd probably go back just because the service is friendly and the atmosphere is very homey.

(I would give it more because, frankly, the food is really good, however, I can't in good conscience, give more than that given the service.)  I'm used to waiting for tables for breakfast/brunch on weeeknds... not a big deal. What I can't let slide is being seated and then waiting for a good 20 minutes before anyone actually comes to your table simply to ask if you want something to drink. (And I'm assuming the only reason the server finally came when she did is because the oddly indifferent, and overly abrasive manager seemed to have noticed the look on my face...later she would yell at her staff for everyone within earshot to hear... ahhh nice calm brunch) After ordering orange juice, we waited another 15 minutes (no joke) before that was brought out . (while I realize it's fresh-squeezed OJ, it's not as if they're flying to FL to handpick the oranges with each glass ordered... 15 minutes is ridiculous) The server (who was also acting as hostess at some point) was, to put it as fairly as possible, socially awkward. While taking our order she started shaking her hands and sighing, motioning us to ""hurry up"" (just a reminder, we had a good 20 minutes to review the menu so it's not like we didn't know what we wanted, we just weren't speaking fast enough for her) and, only, again, after seeing the look on my face did she say, ""Sorry to rush you."" When my friend asked her for some OJ a little bit later, she looked at him as if he had just asked her to kick a dog. While sitting there, we witnessed a customer having to get up and get his OWN refill on coffee because they had been waiting so long. His server ended up snapping at him. Bottom line, brunch and breakfast are my favorite meals to go out and enjoy in Chicago. Pauline's has excellent food but it's not worth the time or the aggravation when surrounded by so many other places in the Edgewater/Andersonville area that will provide MUCH better, much less aggravating (and, dare I say, MUCH less shocking lack of) service.

Why 4 stars?  Probably because I tend to like my breakfast either very early or mid-morning.  Which is why I have yet to wait for a table.  If I had to wait very long, I probably would mash it down to 3.5 stars. It's such a cute, small neighborhood diner.  As one-half of a childless couple, when I normally find children an annoyance at some restaurants, (Sorry parents, but think back to when you were single...) at Pauline's, they're quite endearing.  It's like walking into a relatives house for brunch.  No frills.  And with that understood, I like this place a lot.   The food is not phenomenal, but good for weekend mornings when I don't feel like getting up early and cooking omelettes, pancakes, etc.  This place definitely hits the spot.  They're not looking for that bizarre flavor pairing that will knock your socks off.  They just serve good food.  I don't find their prices much more than a Denny's or IHOP.  And rather than getting that fresh out of the can flavor, Pauline's flavors are fresh. This morning I met my family there for brunch (party of 7), and I'm assuming because of the holiday, they were a lot busier than usual.  I loved that our waitress took the time to explain this to us, and instead of serving all our food together, offered to serve it to us as it was ready.  In preparation for this, we ordered a stack of pancakes and biscuits and gravy to tie us over for the wait.  She didn't bat an eyelash when we asked for small plates so we could all share in the entrees as they arrived.  It was a long meal-- I think it took almost an hour and a half.  But due to our server's insight and recommendations, it turned what could've been a disastrous visit into a memorable one.   I highly recommend the Crabmeat Eggs Benedict.  It wasn't served with crabcake, but crab chunk meat, which offered just as much saltiness as ham.  Delicious.  My brother-in-law had the South American omelette which wasn't greasy, even with all that lovely chorizo packed inside.  French Toast was surprisingly toasty, which lended a great texture to what can be an easily soggy dish.  The pancakes are buttery and fluffy. (Seeing them on the griddle on our way out on our 1st visit solidified our 2nd visit.)  I ordered the asparagus and goat cheese omelette.  While still good, I think I might try something else next time.  I did bring leftovers home for tomorrow's breakfast.

Sometimes when a restaurant screws up a lot, depending on the type of place, I might be inclined to think, ""Man, that was terrible, but at least their heart is in the right place.""  Not this time.  At no point during the entire ordeal did I ever get the faintest impression that anyone at Pauline's gives a flying fuck about their customers.",-0.9947,0.747,0.083,0.17,0.5065532879818594

I'd been driving past Pauline's for months and finally the planets aligned and I went in for breakfast. Upon entering, the planets realigned to form an evil clown face, or at least a frowny emoticon.  We entered; the hostess(?) seated our party of two in the second room. Outdoor seating was also available but maybe she judged that we were too pale for the June sun; at any rate, she didn't give us the option. She pointed to a two-top along the wall with roughly .4"" clearance between the tables in front and back of it. Mmm, cozy!  The table itself had been lovingly anointed with water in a haphazard pattern, but not dried. If I had been carrying my protractor, I could have measured the exact tilt of the table, but instead we simply know that it's at the angle where plates slide. The silverware on my side had been unwrapped, presumably for the napkin because they were unused.  Our waitress approached and introduced herself, but turned abruptly as if to grab something for wiping down the table. She returned but did nothing to the table, if she even noticed. We requested a couple napkins to take care of it ourselves.  She asked if we wanted coffee; I requested hot tea. I usually do this as a knee-jerk reaction to the coffee question, without looking at the menu. Usually it doesn't come back to bite me in the wallet, but this time it was $2.95 for two tea bags (one reg, one decaf) and some hot water. The water was presented in a 10oz. creamer for a mug that was about double the size. Even worse, the menu only lists tea to go, which is $1.50.  The food itself was actually decent: aforementioned blueberry pancakes (which were pretty great), good french toast & side of strawberries, and the omelet that was supposed to be easy on the cheese was. Our waitress had, thankfully, asked whether I wanted all the toppings on my pancakes, which I did not. However, she assumed this was the case for the French toast, but you know what happens when you assume....In this case, it means someone doesn't get any syrup.  We paid our bill in cash, in keeping with the retro vibe. Although I wasn't even sure whether we paid our server or the hostess, we ended up leaving it on the table because our server simply didn't come back. This made me nervous but at that point I wasn't going to lose sleep over it.  I think Pauline's assumes that people have no other options for breakfast.

As usual, a wait for a table and as usual, they were passing out their freshly squeezed juice to all of us waiting for a table. Yummy!  Their menu is not overly extensive. They are only open for breakfast and lunch (close at 3pm). Their servings are HUGE! The time before last when I went, I got the buttermilk pancakes, bacon and potatoes. No way did I finish it all. I mean, I tried my darnedest to finish every bite of food, it was so good, but I just couldn't do it. I did have to walk back to the car afterward....I couldn't just sit there for hours in food coma. So this past time I got the small stack of Chocolate Chip pancakes and bacon (I skipped the potatoes altogether) and guess what...I still couldn't finish my food!!!!  OK, enough about their huge servings, because who wants that large a serving if the food is not good? But that's the thing....their food is SO GOOD!

I live right by this place and would love nothing more than to have an awesome diner place to hop in and have breakfast on the weekend, especially if it's after a big party night or I have someone in town staying with me. Alas it cannot and will not happen at Paulines. I had an omelet when I went, I think the best way to put it is that their food is sloppy. I know it's a diner, and I know it's just breakfast, but I know the difference, this place is gross. My veggie omelet was swimming in grease (and I am not opposed to greasy food from time to time) I think there was like one piece of something that resembled a vegetable. The potatoes, not good.

My outside experience - We were seated outside at a table that was too small to accommodate even two people.  The table teetered back and forth and I recall being distinctly aware of where to place my feet below the table so as to no upset the entire works.  Our server was courteous but not especially friendly.   I ordered a vegetable omelet and an orange juice.  The OJ was delicious and pulpy.  The vegetables in my omelet were fresh and crisp however in their original size.  They didn't bother to cut them up so I had huge stalks of asparagus thrown in my omelet.  Other than that being a bit odd, it was tasty.  I had a lovely time while eating outside however I think that had more to do with the weather and my company.   The outside experience should get 3 stars. The reason I gave 2 stars is because my experience INSIDE was bad enough to detract from my original score.    I was seated in the booth next to my son across the table from my friend.  (Just setting the stage).  The server came by took our orders but she was extremely rude and weird.  My son ordered pancakes and a coffee.  He was 11 at the time and the server went on a diatribe about how it was going to stunt his growth.   1.  I didn't ask and 2.  I didn't ask. I don't remember what anyone else ordered but I do recall the waitress making a regular appearance to mutter what felt more like a obligatory 'is everything ok honey' AT us stand there and wait for a response.  She poured coffee from 2 feet above the cup splashing it everywhere.  She burned my friend with the splash not once but twice and she reached over me while I was taking a bite to clear my son's plate.  She was the pits.

Maybe that's fine for some people but she was never asked if she wanted whipped cream or not. She doesn't like whipped cream so that's not ok.  My coffee was extremely weak and it still had a hint of some kind of tea flavor in it making me wonder if I had been given a mug that contained tea from a previous customer and not washed before being used for my coffee.

However, I have no idea how anyone could ever give this Denny's with kitsch anything more than 3 stars.

My first impression was one of concern.  We got there a little after noon and the place looked like a train had literally ran through the restaurant (as opposed to the tracks directly to the west).  I didn't want to tempt fate and check out the restrooms.  Regardless of the apparent lack of concern for  presentation, we sat down and opened the menu.  What a great surprise!  My menu had been soaking in oil and was completely disgusting! Side note: Dear restaurant owners: If you present your patrons with filthy menus, what message do you think you are sending?  It really doesn't take much time to check the menu daily, replacing what gets soiled/dirty and wiping away food/grease stains. Anyway, after waiting about 20 minutes for service we ordered.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy; in my opinion there is no greater measure of an establishments ability to serve breakfast than the biscuits and gravy.  It forces the place to demonstrate that they can a) create a delicious gravy b) bake a delicious biscuit.  Fail on both account.  Personally, if I go out to eat the last thing you better serve me is a biscuit that is out of a CAN!!!  They served the kind that are flaky and are really just thin slices of biscuit on top of one another so they come off layer by layer.  As for the gravy, I don't like thin runny gravy.  My fork should be able to stand up in the gravy, not fall in and get lost. It wasn't seasoned very well - it could have used a lot more pepper and salt.  The sausage was OK, but nothing amazing. Making matters worse, the eggs that I ordered as a side were slapped right smack dab in the middle of the BNG.  Uhm, would have preferred to have those on the side, but whatever. The omelette was OK.. It was obviously thrown together very, very fast, and you could tell by the haphazard way it was thrown on the platter.  I love fast service but I'd gladly wait another minute or two so you could not make a sloppy mess out of things.  The omelette had decent flavor but the mushrooms were thick cut and not cooked.  The spinach was still raw and made things a little runny in the middle.  The cheese was used very sparingly.  The potato side that was served was overcooked, far too browned (it was just shy of burnt) and had a bit too much green and red pepper. The fresh squeezed orange juice was as good as fresh squeezed can get - obviously they grind the orange rind down as far as possible because there was a pronounced rind flavor.  Thick, pulpy OJ, but let's be honest, it doesn't take much to get OJ right. In the end we left full but unsatisfied.  To say the service was rough around the edges would be an understatement.  The cashier barely looked up while taking the money and checking out.

2009-07-15,4.0,"Hello Pauline? It's me Heather. Weight Watchers or no Weight Watchers, I CANNOT depreive myself of Sunday Morning Breakfast. It's like a weekly holiday. I would walk across Hell's half acre for biscuits and gravy. Split wine, walk on water.... you name it, I'd do it. Gimme the fluffy biscuits and savory gravy. Pauline's is the cutest little neighborhood diner, providing some of the most stellar breakfast I've had in this city to date.... and I've been here for a solid 400 Sunday's, so, that's a LOT of desayuno.  The portions are borderline offensive, and I mean that in a good way. You could EASILY feed 2 people with 1 breakfast entree. The menu will tell you they make ""5 egg omlettes"". This is a lie. It's like a dozen, and STUFFED with veggies and meats and cheeses galore. All breakfast's come with ""Pauline's famous potatoes"" and a side of toast. Pauline's potatoes are not that famous in my book. Standard red skins cut into chunks, and put on a griddle with peppers and onions. I prefer my hashies to be of the frozen, more glutenous variety, i.e. cooked in a vat of grease and salt, and served to me piping hot and crispy. These just don't make the cut, but the other food is totally worth accepting her sub par potatoes.  I've only seen their lunch entrees, but never sampled. I can't NOT get the biscuits n' gravy when I'm there. The lunch stuff looks equally appealing. Pretty sure I threatened a waitress's life for the Patty Melt she had on her tray, but don't worry, I haven't been black listed.  Pauline's is worth the drive if you don't live near Andersonville. There is plenty of easy street parking, service is always outstanding and FAST, food is ALWAYS delicious, and I always roll out smiling. I mean roll is its most literal sense.

It was pretty busy and we were told that they were short on servers, but they service was still great.  I can tell you from experience that the individuals I work with are not always treated as they should be.  This was definitely not the case at Pauline's.  Our waiter was very patient with them as they ordered (as it took more time than most parties of 5).  He did a great job explaining that they only had lentil soup today when one of my clients said they wanted tomato, and again when that same client said they wanted cream of mushroom.  When the waiter found out that we were also celebrating a bday, he brought a bowl of ice cream out to the bday girl with enough for everyone at the table to have some.  He started singing ""Happy Birthday"" and the entire section of the restaurant sang along.  I cannot say enough about the great service and kindness that we all received.   Just like every time I've been there, the food was great.  I think it was a great experience for the individuals I went with and I would recommend this place for anyone that is in the area that wants a tasty, filling meal.",0.9967,0.807,0.179,0.014,0.5500744047619048

And, naturally, it has a friendly, charming vibe befitting the locale. The food, though, is appallingly average and not necessarily cheap. My latest breakfast was eggs over medium and corned-beef hash with a side of bacon. The eggs were fine, but the hash way too greasy and salty. The bacon was over cooked, the potatoes undercooked, the coffee thin. The whole experience reminded me of the last time I was at Pauline's when I had basically the exact same meal at the same quality. Still, the average joe like me is more or less pre-programmed to like places like this and I'm sure I'll drag ass in there again at some point, but it really could be better.

I discovered this somewhat remote, yet bright eye-piercing RED diner while on the Metra train heading north to Kenosha.  The name Pauline's excited me because I thought the southern belle cook Paula Dean opened up a local joint outside of Georgia.  This ended up not being true, but I still wasn't disappointed because I didn't suffer from a heart attack afterward.  It's just far away from the brunch rush of Andersonville's Clark Street to avoid the crowds, and you're satisfied with down-home cooking in a place where everyone feels at home. After walking in you're overwhelmed by the red, yellow, green and white color paint choice.  The adorable owner is quick to greet you with a smile and insists to get a booth cleared for you since ""our customers like the booths best.""  This must be true since he has posted a sign by each booth asking anyone on weekends to have only 2 or 3 coffee refills so others can take their booth.  I think that all places need this at times.  The booths are fun with a scrap of receipt paper stating your waitress' name, a rack with various recent magazines, collages on the table, and wall of their favorite patrons.  Locals seem to become returners quickly.  Like myself.  I almost always go for the Breakfast Special which always includes a huge pancake, eggs and turkey sausage.  The main draw are their delicious pancakes which have just the right amount of sweetness and come with a dollop of their homemade whipped cream.  Paired with a glass of fresh-squeezed juice, yum!  I personally enjoy the mango orange, but they also have papaya orange.  Be sure to check the hanging chalkboard at the entrance with the daily special.  You may not want to miss out! The one time I did veer away from breakfast, I had a Turkey Burger with guacamole, mayo, ketchup, a bed of lettuce, and tomato slices, PLUS their perfectly fried golden crunchy Cavendish Fries makes me lose my train of thought (no pun intended).  As the menu depicts, these are ""Canadian potatoes grown by Irish men and batter coated in Burlington Mass.

Pauline's also suffers from a severe lack of systematic order.  The stationless servers sprint about like harried, headless chickens.  The food is ready in baffling order -- here come the eggs and later comes the soggy, microwaved bacon and cold toast.  Pushy bus boys snatch at your plate as you lift the last bite of food to your lips.  The crazy owner coos at a cute baby only to turn around and scream ""get the f*ck out"" to a patient customer with a legitmate complaint (I actually witnessed this).   Are the poor servers often rather surly?  Yes, but I'm sure you'd be too if you're being screamed at by your boss as your customers fidget hungrily as you sprint across the restaurant to to freshen the coffee of one of your ramdonly assigned tables.  It seems like a handbasket on a roller coaster ride to hell.

I was struggling with my coat and couldn't even move my chair back to sit down cuz it's jammed in between the table and the wooden post behind it.

Yes, I realize that they capitalize on those people who, like myself, live off of Ravenswood instead of Clark or Ashland and want to avoid the craziness which is weekend brunch in Andersonville. I just simply wish that Pauline's could improve on their food quality, their service, and the general feeling of the restaurant overall. I have visited here many times and have left upon many occasions feeling, this place COULD be so great. But, I have had slow and / or non-existent service, where the 40 year old waitresses are much more interested in catching up with each other than in taking care of their guests. I have experienced full out conversations with their family members over the phone as I am patiently waiting to pay my bill up at the front. Where I have had a plate of food delivered to me ten minutes before my companions is ready. Yes, I understand this is supposed to be a ""diner"", but you do realize Pauline's that most people will wait out of courtesy for their dining companions' food to arrive before they eat their own plate of food? Just set mine out under a heat lamp instead of sending it out only to be freezing cold ten minutes later because I'm trying to be polite. Or, I have a genius idea. How about cook the food at the same time?! Genius!!!!! I mean, c'mon. I have been there at least three times where this sort of thing has happened to me. Not to mention, you have to flag down the gum flapping waitress in order to see IF the food is actually coming.

On the plus side, Pauline's is located on a very nostalgic corner on Ravenswood Street across from the Metra train line.  Plenty of trees abound forming a very pleasant outdoor seating area.  The outdoor tables have umbrellas for shade.  However, I can find a lot better places (with much better food) to eat in Anderson for the same prices that this place charges!

2007-05-19,3.0,"Very down home place in Chicago - I don't think they've updated the decor in at least 30 years if not more, but somehow it adds to it's cheesy charm. It gets VERY busy on the weekends, so expect a wait out the door and when you finally do get seated, it will be crowded. They don't seem to rush you once you are seated though. The food is typical brunch food - eggs, pancakes, etc. The orange juice is freshly squeezed and out of this world! I do have to complain about the tea - they just give you a random assortment in one of those old strawberry containers that are usually hit or miss. I know, tea isn't the reason why people go here, but if you're going to charge me $2 a cup, please make it worth my while (and I don't like coffee).",0.3241,0.885,0.062,0.053,0.4762962962962963
2007-04-30,3.0,"We were greeted at the front door by an older gentleman who offered us plastic shot glasses which were quickly filled with freshly squeezed orange juice and followed by the promise that the twenty minute wait would be worth it, claiming that it would take us at least another twenty minutes to find another place, and the other place would be far inferior.  Thus, we waited, and in no time were able to crawl over several tables to be seated at a table on the sidewalk. The menu was overwhelming, because even though all the egg and pancake offerings were standard and straightforward, the portions appeared huge - omelets made with five extra large eggs sounds a little intense, doesn't it?  Fear not, I've had three egg omelets that are bigger than these, so I'm not sure what the deal is with that.  I've been ordering stuffed french toast a lot lately, and theirs looked delicious - until my plate arrived, loaded with boring battered Texas toast, whipped cream, and a sprinkling of un-ripe strawberries.  The following conversation with the waitress ensued:  ""I ordered stuffed french toast.""  ""No you didn't.""  ""Yes I did.""  ""No, you just ordered regular french toast.""  ""No ma'am, I did not.  Would it still be possible to get the stuffed.""  ""I guess.""  ""Would it take awhile?""  ""Probably.""  ""Fine, nevermind, I'll eat this.""  And then I did what I could to eat something I didn't want after having a healthy dose of attitude and no apology.  Everyone else was satisfied with their eggs, home fries and toast, but the most enthusiasm was saved for the fight over the blackberry jam packets. Giving this waitress the benefit of the doubt, I would come back here if I was in the area, or could walk here from my house, but I won't go out of my way to return.  ps, they only take cash and personal checks.",0.9054,0.84,0.097,0.063,0.5000776207919065

They need to take everyone that works here (including the owner) and take them to etiquette school on how to run a business. I was in there with a group of four people, we were ignored almost the entire time, they didn't bring everything we ordered to the table and yet it was still on the bill. Oh yeah, and it took a half hour just to get the bill at the end, one of the worst mistakes you can make as a server. Trust me, I was a server for almost 3 years.  I NEVER complain and am always sympathetic towards servers b/c I was one, but our experience was so bad to the point I thought we were all on MTV's ""Boiling Points"" (Did I win my $100 yet). When we confronted the owner about it, all he said was ""That's the way it is"". Well sir, I would rather cut my wang off and throw it in the lake than come back to your establishment.

I sit and write this and at the very same time I am waiting for the diarrhea to kick in. Things that went WELL:   the OJ is great, the toast wasn't burnt Things that went BAD: we had to ask 3 times for milk and sugar substitute for our coffee which lead me to get up and search the restaurant for sugar substitute because the waitress never brought it, all of our meals where not delivered together (one person was missing their bacon, someone else was missing toast), ALL the food was cold?!?, my over easy eggs were not over easy - all three yolks were cooked solid, potatoes were cold, the bacon was NOT COOKED!, returned bacon was just put back on the grill and was returned full of grease and a pancake taste, the owner? was hanging pictures on the wall with a full restaurant, the owner refilled our much needed coffee mugs but proceeded to not only spill my coffee but BOTH of my friends coffees!!,  the old man owner? made us move our table mid-meal and yes, again spill more coffee in the process, the waitress in her flight passed our table and knocked our paper and condiments off our table and on to the floor, the old man owner again made a comedic appearance by using our table as a wait station?!!? - loading up used cups from another table, filled water glasses for a new table and tossing silverware on our table.   We also waited and waited and waited and waited and waited and waited and waited and waited some more for our check... after asking for it.      This place is a JOKE.",0.9567,0.881,0.086,0.033,0.5203861531986531

If i was writing an insiders guide, Pauline's would have top billing. Having visited this spot dozens of times, quirky is certainly the appropriate adjective but in such a good way, with a smattering of posters, photographs and, yes,  sponge paint covering the walls. The owner takes amazingly good care of his guests. Food is plentiful and excellent - I highly recommend the 'everything' omelet with white asparagus and delicious pancakes. Only thing that doesn't thrill me is the poor coffee  over my last few visits but don't let that keep you away.
