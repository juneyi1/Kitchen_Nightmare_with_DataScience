I recently ordered off of the catering menu for a birthday party though, and was super impressed with absolutely everything, from the ease of ordering (with Deanna's help) to pick up, to how literally everyone loved the antipasti tray and sandwich selections!! The sandwiches are cut into a great little size so that people could grab one or two and vegetarians in the group loved the veggie sandwiches and the meat eaters demolished the rest, the Mr G was the biggest hit!! The antipasti tray was overflowing with meats, cheeses and artichoke hearts, olives& roasted eggplant, which were my selections, but I don't think you could possibly go wrong!!!

The Mr. G and prosciutto/fresh mozzarella were both delicious, well stacked on fresh bread. The bread itself is very soft in the middle with a thin crispy outer layer that almost shatters with each bite.  The decor is nice with antique architectural details and cool paintings on the walls. Deli counter is small but they have the goods. A half dozen different imported olives if that's your thing, and a couple of dry cured sausages. Small selection of imported dry goods, and interesting sodas. Service was very conscientious and genuine. The subs came out fast, and we sat out on the patio under the shaded awning to watch the world go by. Good spot for people watching, as there are lots of trendy restaurants nearby. Twice we were asked how the food was, and they basically waited on us which wasn't expected.

Although yes, the most popular sandwiches are the Italian and the Mr. G, I decided to go with the prosciutto. I do not regret it.

The Mr. G sub was full of flavor from all the different meats, sharp provolone, marinated artichokes and the fresh basil leaves. Don't be fooled by the pictures, there is actually just one large artichoke heart placed right in the middle of the sub. If you are looking for a ton of meat, I'd try one of their other offerings. The sub was large enough to make 2 meals for me. My bf, on the other hand, devoured his entire tuna sub. I also had a cannoli for dessert. The menu description says ""fresh filled,"" but they fill it earlier in the day. When you look at them through the display glass, you can see the juice from the marinated cherry bleeding into the ricotta filling. Despite the not so fresh appearance, it still tasted great.

But I go to Graziano's for the love. The ladies who ring you up in the back are all ""Sweetheart"" this and ""My love"" that, and they remember your face. : ) Even the guys who make the sandwiches have pretty sweet dispositions!

What did I like?  First when I ordered Jim had no problem with my request to add prosciutto and hot soppressata to my Italian sub. I love both in addition to the salami, capicola etc that comes on it. I also asked for very very hot. So the combo of the hot giardiniera and the hot capicola did the trick.  Perfect. But what you notice when you bite into the sun is the fresh bread. Crispy but not hard and soft and light under the crust. It holds and complements the meats, cheese and condiments but doesn't interfere with the flavor of the meats, cheese etc. I will be back ever single visit to Chicago. Go here. Now.

2017-04-06,5.0,"Whenever I'm asked, ""What's your favorite restaurant in Chicago?"" my immediate answer is always, J.P. Graziano. This place practically writes the book on quality, Italian subs. Their bread is exceptional! It's crusty and chewy, but it doesn't upstage the meat! Everything they put on their sandwiches is fresh and high-quality.  My go-to order is the spicy Italian sub with hot peppers (swap out the red wine vinegar for truffle mustard--you won't be disappointed!). Amazing. Their hot peppers are out of this world. I love how the sandwich is served too....nothing special, just wrapped up in butcher paper; something about it just makes the sandwich feel that much more Italian deli. It's a cute little grocery setup, too. They have some nice imported drinks, and deli-style snacks, desserts, etc. Nothing to write home about in terms of the service; it's a pretty no-frills, order at the counter (pay at the window) joint. That system confused me a bit the first time I came here; you order your sandwich at the deli counter, and then move 5 ft to your left, recite your order to the person in the window and pay, and then you pick up your sandwich.

Upon entering, the first thing you'll notice is that this is a sandwich shop masquerading as a grocery store. Sure they have a few shelves and sell meat/cheese by the pound but they are in the sandwich business. And for good reason, they make a good sandwich! Being my first time I went with the Mr. G (the ""House Specialty"") and I wasn't disappointed. While I do think it needs a bit more meat the flavor combination was fantastic. Also, I added Dijon mustard and mayo and am so glad I did, the mustard made the sandwich a cut above. At first I thought it was a bit small, and while I prefer massive meals, it turned out to satisfy me. However, the price is a bit steep: for a sandwich and a drink I walked out $15 lighter...

It is a no frills Italian sub shop that also sells some meat, olives, and spices (like oregano) by the pound.

There are a handful of different types of meat, but it's not one of those sandwiches where it's a meat overload. Not even the artichokes overpowered the sandwich (they do on most).

2016-08-25,5.0,"Manna from heaven!! As a kid, growing up in a family that had its own restaurant on Taylor Street, I took great Italian food for granted. Finding good - let alone great, or even excellent - Italian food in the last ten years has been shockingly difficult to find, even in my beautiful city, known for its great Italian fare. There are few places in town now that would live up to the high standards of my Aunt Annette, the captain of our family restaurant, and one of the best cooks I've ever known. For big summer family get-togethers, she would supervise the making of giant Italian submarine sandwiches, which would then be cut into smaller servings and everyone would grab a big napkin and a sammie and eat standing up. Each ingredient was carefully curated by Aunt Annette, and everything was the best quality. I've never tasted anything close to this great sandwich... until now. From the very first bite, I knew that Graziano's Itallian sub would meet with Aunt Annette's approval. Top-quality Italian deli meats, the freshest tomatoes and lettuce, the perfect blend of Italian herbs and just the right amount of red wine vinegar, all presented on the queen of Italian breads from D'Amato's Bakery, make for the perfect Italian Submarine sandwich. Its perfection brings a tear to my eye and a rumble to my stomach. When I make the pilgrimage out to the suburbs, where my dad - a cross between Joe Pesci and Paul Sorvino, and a true Taylor Street Italian - currently resides, I always try to bring him a Graziano's sub. They are the very best of their kind in our fair city, and you'd do yourself a favor to get over to Randolph Street and pick up one - or ten - of these perfectly balanced, top-quality ingredients, amazing Italian sandwiches. There are lots of places that have Italian subs on their menu, and some are pretty good. But none of them - NONE - stand even close to Graziano's in terms of quality, flavor, and superior craftsmanship. Graziano's has other subs on their menu, which are also delicious, made with top-quality ingredients, perfectly balanced flavors and lovingly crafted, and I've enjoyed several of them. They also have some great desserts, of which the raspberry bars and cannoli are my favorite. Ahhh, now I need one! Gotta go get me one-a them Graziano's subs!

The employees are all super pleasant and friendly and make you feel like one of the family. Yes I agree with some other Yelpers - the first time you go in ordering and payment may be confusing but just ask someone!! They are so nice and will help you out without making you feel dumb like a moody barista at a hipster cafe would. Once you've done it one time you're a pro, ok?   The only criticism I have is from my visit today (haven't experienced it any other time) is that someone had just clearly been smoking in the payment office, and as I stood and waited by the window I almost dry heaved in the other patrons' faces!

2015-10-10,3.0,Ordered an Italian sub on uber eats and was exited to try it based on Yelp reviews. I need to agree with the other reviews that are a bit critical of the quantity of meat being delivered and the general tommy satisfaction delivered.  The reminded me more of a Nola po-boy than a hearty Italian. The bread was crusty but really airy and didn't have much substance. Some like this kind of bread but I like a denser dough. Meat was good but you do only get a single layer of each type of meat and honestly it's not much- see the pic.  The price is good but definitely not my favorite and I would say this place probably isn't worthy of the 4.5 star rating. Maybe because there just aren't many of these types of joints here in chicago?,0.955,0.784,0.165,0.052,0.5052521008403362

I came to JP Graziano's expecting to have my opinion flipped upside down, as all of my Chicago native friends said that I would.  What I got was the same uninspired sandwich on a dried out flakey roll that more resembles a stale dinner roll at a bad restaurant than something worthy of containing premium Italian meats and condiments. It's not that the ingredients aren't great on paper, because they are. It's very difficult to mess up top notch cold cuts and giardiniera, but for some reason they all manage to do just that by stuffing the sandwich into that horrible Chicago French roll. Bari, Vinnie's and Lucia's are all guilty of the same thing.  This city needs DiBella's so bad.

Realizing I could die soon, given my almost senior status, I devised a plan to entice hubby into trying a couple-two-tree of these joints tonight.  My brilliant strategy was to convince him to split #16 with me;  the sub from JP Graziano Grocery 'The Mr. G', as hubby IS a connoisseur of Chicago Italian subs, and in turn, I would share my Au Cheval's single burger #18 that I have been hankering to try. They are a block from each other. So off we go. It's 4pm, and we have an hour to get downtown before JP Grazianos closes for the evening. Forgetting that it's rush hour, we arrive at 3 minutes to five... he double parks and i jump out to place the order for one Italian sub.  I am met at the door by someone who informs me that the place is closed... I'm practically in tears, and beg to order one sandwich to go. The guys inside are more than happy to accommodate me (Kudos!)  I'm instructed to go to the window and pay, and they'll make the sandwich.  At the window, I am met by a very amiable guy 'Jim', and explain our hours drive and the food bucket list from Thrillist... He rings up my order then shouts to the guys making the Italian sub :"" Make a 'Mr G.' too.""  That's when I realize, in my haste I had ordered the wrong sandwich. He turns to me and says ""The Mr. G is on the house"" WHAAA????  Turns out, this great guy Jim, is the grandson of the original proprietor JP Graziano. He is trying (successfully I think) to move his family-owned business into a new era. We discuss all things Italian while they make the sandwiches, and when he bags my order, he throws in 2 provolone and giardiniera buns he's testing...gratis! (Oh yummmm). In those simple gestures...1) gracefully accepting a late order after a long day, and 2) very generously sharing his food...  before I had even TRIED the sandwiches, he has made life-long clients. The hour drive is/WAS worth it!  BRAVO Giacomo!   Au Cheval will wait for another day :) p.s. The subs ROCKED...both of them. The connoisseur (hubby) changed his mind 3 times...

Order your sub from the friendly guy taking orders, let him know if you want everything on the sandwich, with hot peppers, etc. grab a Sanpellegrino soda to go with it from the cooler, then pay the lady in the office booth.

I walked inside and saw it was no frills, no gimmicks. One big room with two tables, the ordering station, the office, the fridge cases, the gelato station, the shelves stocked of Italian specialties; that's basically it. I ordered a Mr. G's sandwich with salami, prosciutto, sopprasetta, sharp provolone, marinated artichoke hearts, fresh basil, lettuce, hot oil, red wine vinegar, oregano, and their truffle mustard balsamic vinaigrette. For another 75 cents, I also added roasted red peppers and mild giardinera. With a Sprite and cannoli, my total came to $14, which may seem a little high, but I'm fine with paying extra three or four dollars for more authentic ingredients. I paid my tab at the infamous ordering office. I told Mrs. Graziano it was my first time and she was happy to introduce herself to me and she shook my hand. That's the type of service that I appreciate so much; it's become all too rare nowadays. I mentioned I also wanted a cannoli and the staff quickly bagged one up for me. I took my first bite of the Mr. G and couldn't believe it. The bread was hard and on the outside, yet incredibly soft inside. I've had so many sub sandwiches on mediocre bread and that ruins the rest of the sandwich. This was definitely not the case. All the ingredients tasted so fresh and I loved the balance of this sandwich. The freshness of the basil, the heat of the oil, the coolness of the artichokes, the spices of the meats.

Our sandwiches were very good.  I love a good italian sandwich, and my boyfriend got the Mr. G, which is the house special.  I would give them five stars for service, but I found like I like Bari's subs better, which are a few bucks cheaper.  My two sandwiches, no sides, came out to $17.  Not bad, but not as cheap as Bari's.

2013-09-03,5.0,"I've had a few genuinely lovely experiences here that go beyond the delicious sandwiches that this place is well known for; but my respectful appreciation of this commercial grocery didn't start out smoothly.   From her first experience, the Wife hasn't been shy about publicly extolling her love of a certain Mr. G.  Naturally, I became defensive and jealous of her adoration over this hunky Italian delight.  She's always talked about her affinity towards all things Italian and much of what she loves about  it doesn't equate to me in any way. With hurt pride and an uncontrollable urge to confront my new found nemesis and see what all the big fuss is about, I strode right into this old-timey shop along Randolph to find a clean butcher-style counter and a large doorway leading back to a temperature controlled back room. Being a little confused and anxious about the prospects of getting my angry hands on this Mr. G, I demanded from the guys behind the deli counter to give him up. That's when they tell me I have to speak ""to her""... ""Her"" being a woman behind a counter, inside a little office tucked back in the corner of the front shop.  No way could the home wrecker Mr. G be misconstrued for this kind-looking woman who greets me immediately with words that from some people seem condescending, but from her are sweet gestures of appreciation that you are in her place and buying her products.  Still, she wanted money before I could see this Mr. G.  At this point, the anticipation was too much for me to walk away.  I had to see this elusive object of desire my wife had lusted over.  If it takes a small transaction price for me to set my eyes on Mr. G and do what needed to be done, then so be it.  When in Rome... And that's when it happened.  A short encounter with this Mr. G lead to my fear and jealousy and feelings of inadequacy somehow vanishing almost instantly and being replaced with deep respect, admiration and dare I say- love.  How could I be upset with my wife for wanting something that I myself now crave, dream about, and make plans for?  It dawned on me that living my life in a jealous nature is no way to live at all, especially when the thing that I became so jealous of has come to bring me such ethereal pleasure. I now loudly profess my undying love for Mr. G, and I frequently do so alongside my wife.  Clearly our lives have been changed by this delicious sandwich made with hot sopresatta, provolone, Prosciutto di Parma, salami, truffled mustard, some veggies and a bit of vinegar and oil all encased by a nicely baked long roll.  Really, the only thing I can say is that if you head here, you'll definitely want to get your hands on Mr. G and stuff it all in your mouth. Yep, I said it - and I'm not ashamed. And while this may (or may not) make Mrs. Graziano (the amazing ""boss"" back in that corner office) uncomfortable, the real reason I write this review is about her.  Yes, the sandwiches are astounding.  Yes, this place has been around since the 30's.  Yes, its a great blend of both tradition and American.  But what makes this place endearing to me is Mrs. Graziano, and the last couple of visits I've had here dealing with her. Walking in after work, but only 20 minutes before closing time, I happened to notice I couldn't find the canollis which are usually in the standing cooler.  Thinking that perhaps I just missed them or that they had some more in the back, I asked Mrs. Graziano.  She said ""let me check back here for you"" and got up and walked behind a back counter.  She then proceeded to get out everything necessary to make two canollis for me to go home 20 minutes before they closed shop.  I insisted that I was asking for too much and that she didn't need to go through the trouble, but she counter-insisted on providing me with two customized canollis for my wife and I to take home and enjoy.  And we did.  And we were very grateful. But maybe not as grateful as we were upon acting on her suggestion to mix some of J.P. Graziano's very own giardenaire with a cut of beef (I used chuck roast) in a crock pot and put on a low setting until it tears apart (looking like pulled pork) giving you an outrageously easy and delicious beef mixture that is perfect in so many applications.  In a bun as a sandwich.  Mixed with some fresh steamed vegetables and egg noodles.  On top of fresh sliced bread with some sliced tomato bruschetta-style.  In your morning smoothie.  It don't matter.  The stuff is amazing- and yet another reason why Mr. G, Mrs. Graziano, and the entire institution of J.P. Graziano Grocery has rightfully earned my adoration.",0.9991,0.727,0.197,0.075,0.4937820900030203

They missed there train so I had an extra long time to wait for them. I decided to eat a pre lunch in the form of a Mr. G sub. Although bread to meat ratio may look off the Grazianos obviously know what they're doing because the flavors were perfectly balanced. I was happy the bread did not scrape the roof of my mouth. It was surprisingly light for a sandwich. I wanted to order so many more things. What makes this place amazing is the hominess as soon as you walk in. They greet and treat you like a long time friend or their own family. You can tell some people come several times a week. This family cares about the food they put out and have a lot of love to give as well. They actually care. You leave with warm fuzzies and a full belly.  Thanks for having me!

2013-01-09,4.0,"J.P. Graziano is an excellent example of the classic Chicago Italian sub, along with various other J.P. Graziano specialty subs.  On this visit, we arrived around 10:00 AM on a Monday morning, and luckily there was no wait.  There are two tables to sit at and enjoy your freshly made to order subs.  The subs are served on very fresh and very crunchy D'Amato's bakery bread from nearby on Grand Ave.  D'Amato's crunchy bread is the best in the business, even if it doesn't necessarily add anything to the actual taste of the subs.  If you're into crunchy bread, then any sub sandwich with D'Amato's bread is right up your alley.  And fresh cannoli's, too.   We enjoyed 3 subs- the classic Italian, the house specialty ""Mr. G,""  and a turkey sub.  The turkey sub consists of a turkey breast, provolone cheese, roasted red pepper, mayo, tomato, and lettuce.  Simply put- this was probably the best turkey sub I've ever tried.  Truly excellent in every way.  The turkey had a mesquite flavor, and it very much stood out on its' own.  Their turkey sub alone is reason enough to abandon every other sandwich shop in the West Loop.  A perfect 5 stars.   The house specialty, the ""Mr. G,""  consists of sharp imported provolone, hot supressata, prosciutto di parma, volpi genoa salami, truffle mustard balsamic vinaigrette, hot oil, marinated roman style artichoke, fresh basil, lettuce with red wine vinegar, and oregano.  That's a lot going on for a sandwich, but it was actually really easy to eat.  The meats are cut very thin, and somehow, someway, this sub comes out on the light side.  The fresh basil and the marinated roman style artichoke made this sub for me.  Very good.   And then there was the Italian- hot capicola, volpi genoa salami, hard salami, mortadella, provolone, tomato, lettuce with red wine vinegar, and oregano.  Another excellent sub, and definitely better than their local competition over at Bari on Grand Ave.  The meats are sliced thinner at J.P. Graziano compared to Bari, and J.P. Graziano's meats flat out taste better.  Although I wish they would use the sharp imported provolone that 's used on the ""Mr. G""  rather than the regular provolone because the regular provolone kind of gets lost in the mix of the truly outstanding/fresh meats at J.P. Graziano.   In short, this is the best Italian sub I've ever had within the actual city limits of Chicago, and if I lived closer to the West Loop, I'd easily abandon Bari on Grand Ave.  for J.P. Graziano's.  It's an excellent version of a classic Chicago Italian sub, but not quite as good as Alpine in Elmwood Park or Al and Joe's in Franklin Park which are my only 5 star Italian sub/Italian grocery stores.  Both Alpine and Al and Joe's use softer Gonnella bread, but Alpine and Al and Joe's have better housemade oil and vinegar mixes that, for whatever reason, taste better than J.P. Graziano's.  Maybe that's because Alpine and Al and Joe's use softer breads that soak up the oil and vinegar mixes?!?!?  And the sharper aged provolone at Al and Joe's is still better than everybody else's.   For anyone looking for an excellent Italian sub sandwich, and definitely the best turkey sub you'll ever have anywhere, go to J.P. Graziano's in the West Loop.  And the owner, Jim Graziano, Jr.  is very nice and very accommodating to whatever needs you may have.                                           Great experience all the way around.",0.9989,0.785,0.191,0.024,0.5073782661782661

If you haven't been here, stop what you're doing and make your way over to 901 W Randolph Street right now. Family owned and run FOREVER, this place is a neighborhood staple. When lunch time comes, there is no other place in the neighborhood I'd rather go. They're slicing meat and cheese on a sandwich by sandwich basis. It doesn't get any fresher than that. I didn't realize meat could be sliced so thin to be honest. Then they pile it high on fresh bread. The bread is so fresh that you can't wait too long to get over there for lunch. Sometimes by 2-3pm they'll run out of their bread. It's hard not to be upset when that happens, but every time I bight into one of their gloriously hand crafted sandwiches I'm reminded what fresh bread is supposed to taste like and realize that if they had ordered more bread, I'd be eating day old bread the next day. The grocery store is an awesome place to stock up on specialty meats and artisan cheeses for parties and gatherings. There's a handful of imported olive oils, fresh pasta, and specialty bottled artichokes and roasted red peppers to choose from as well as everything else you might expect to find. The staff is probably my favorite part of the experience.  They work together as a finely tuned machine. It's extremely fascinating to watch them all work in unison and move through a line of customers snaking out the door and around the corner. I can't say enough good things about this place. Come to think about it, I'm going to head over there for lunch today. I heard they're offering fresh soup now, and I can't wait to check it out.",0.993,0.828,0.154,0.018,0.533015873015873

2012-05-19,4.0,"As Randolph Street becomes more and more of a dining destination, many of the old time warehouse and wholesale places are becoming more consumer friendly and this is true of Garziano's Grocery. The subs have gone up in price and are all about $-9 each (plain) and could run you $10 with oil, peppers, mayo, etc. When you walk in you notice right away that this place seems to be a deli attached to a wholesale operation. They have a small section where they prepare the subs, and sell a small amount of quality cheeses, cold cuts, and olives along with other specialty items. The servers are friendly and crack a joke here and there, and you pay at a little back window after your sub is ready.   I had an Italian and the meat and bread were awesome. The bread is from the D'amato's Bakery on Grand. The subs are priced without condiments, so if you want oil, mayo, hot peppers you are going to pay an extra 25-50 cents per item (seems a little odd that the sandwiches come ""plain""). At any rate, the portion size is quite good and the mix of high quality cold cuts, cheese, and D'Amato's bread make these subs a west loop winner. I would rank these subs under the Grand Ave. sub shops and nearby places because of the cost/extras charges, but if you find yourself in the West Loop you can't go wrong here.  The little outside section can be cram-packed if the stroller moms are hogging up space, but everyone understands the place is cramped and I found it was easy to navigate after asking to move a chair here or there. Just be direct and ask if you need someone to scoot! No garbage outside, so I went back in the store to dump my trash in the basket on the inside wall.

Old....it's what I miss the most from Europe. Stumbling across old stones, visiting a medieval church, walking on hundred-year-old cobbled streets....that makes my heart flutter and my head spin. Old is awesome. When you come from a city who's proud of its pre-Roman heritage, it can be brutal to find yourself in Chicago and its forest of skyscrapers and heaps of modern sculptures. But places like J.P. Graziano are there to remind you that the world is not monolithic, it's a colorful mosaic of people of all ages from all around who bring you what you need in the most unexpected moment.

It means that in your giant containers of cannelini beans, olives and spices, there's also some o' good love.

Yes, the people are as nice as advertised. They have a super solid product and have had it for some time. This could create an air of expectation, entitlement and lack of grace. You'll find none of these things. From the regulars who came in to shoot the isht, to n00bs like me and my friends to tourists, I never witnessed anything less than a genuine smile, honest conversation and sincere customer service. Many folks talk about treating customers like friends. Here, I witnessed it to be true. This is a family-run establishment and it feels like it. Yes to all these things. But, if you leave this review with no other knowledge know that the Mr. G is something you must experience as a Chicagoan, person who eats, person who enjoys happiness, etc. What's the big deal, right? It's a sandwich. Wrong. It's a transformative experience that translates love into a meal. In real Italian bread, where else can you taste (imported) provolone, two types of salami (one hot), prosciutto,TRUFFLE MUSTARD (holla if you HEAR me!!!), crunchy lettuce, balsamic vinegrette, hot oil, vinegar, (imported) artichokes, and fresh herbs. Combine that with chips and a San Pellegrino and you're set. Seriously. Almost every bite elicited a smile, giggle or shocked guffaw from my friends and I. A lot of sandwiches make the claim. Few stand up to the press. The Mr. G is truth. It's a new year. Resolve to get over to The West Loop and experience a true taste of Chicago. Also resolve to take it to go. There's a small seating area outside but now's not such a good time to use it.",0.9934,0.775,0.193,0.032,0.4911781911781912

A little further back in the shop they have cheeses in fridges, and salamis and meats and sauces.  Then on shelves they have pastas, canned goods, and sauces from their favorite Italian suppliers. The day we were in, the lady was at the counter, her brother was helping a couple choose meats and cheese and pasta for a dinner they were having, and both of them were so enthusiastic about the products, and very knowledgeable about each item's origin.  Their Mom was in the very pack at the payment counter.  Just such a friendly vibe, and a very obvious family run, proud business.  They re-did the front windows in the last year to make the place more welcoming. It worked!

Yes, I know, it's just a grocer selling a sandwich, what's the hype?  Well that's like saying a Camry and a Ferrari are the same thing because they're both cars.  J.P. Graziano's uses the highest quality meats and cheeses, resulting in a sandwich nothing short of divine.  Simple, but executed perfectly. The staff was excellent, while we were waiting for our sandwiches one of the owners (or at least I imagine he was an owner or manager) offered us a chunk of parmigiano-reggiano cheese he was cutting from the 75-pound wheel.  DELICIOUS.  So much flavor - even this cheese novice could tell she was in the presence of greatness.  He was even nice enough to tell us a little about the cheese making process before we paid and headed out.

2011-01-03,5.0,"I kept wondering, ""how good could a sandwich be?"" Well, very. After seeing reviews for Panozzo's (which coincidentally is right across the street from me), which promised mind-blowing sandwiches, I tried them and found myself unimpressed (not that they were bad of course, but they were sandwiches). I had the same high hopes going into J.P. Grazianos as well and anticipated the same expected opinion on the sandwiches. Well, I was actually wrong.  Now, they aren't magic sandwiches and they're not made out of gold, but for what they are they're simply tops. Everything is prepared fresh to order, including the slicing of the meat. It's interesting when you're used to Subway and other chains to hear them say ""can you slice me a spicy?"" And that's just what they do is slice it fresh, which just makes it taste so much better. Now onto their bread...holy crap. I think bread might be a personal preference, but for me this is literally the exact proportion of bread to meat and other ingredients on a sandwich. It's the perfect thickness and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The crust isn't too hard though (which is the issue I've had at other deli-type sandwich places). It's a bit flaky but the mess is so worth it. I think I could just eat this bread all day long. I tried both the spicy and the Big G. It's very difficult to decide which one I liked better; I think it would depend on my mood. The truffle mustard is like the best condiment ever invented. It's got an unexpected (for me anyway) kick to it. I sorta want to bathe in it, but I digress. The spicy was effing awesome. It sounds not as glamorous as the Big G, but I think that's it's selling point. It's just an old fashioned Italian sub but done the best you've ever had it. I was most impressed with the use of vinegar. When you're used to the chains, I NEVER got oil and vinegar cause #1 the stuff they use doesn't taste good and #2 it's really messy and drips out and doesn't really add anything. But the vinegar on the spicy is used so sparingly but adds that flavor. OMG, it was amazing.  So the last thing I have to mention is something you might not think about when you're thinking about subs, but it's worth a mention. If you're going to eat something for breakfast the next day, you think pizza, Chinese food, etc. Sandwiches aren't exactly what you think of as a two day type of food. Not with these babies. Yes, the bread was cold but still wasn't soggy or too hard and the ingredients all tasted good the next day. I think it's worth knowing if you have a bunch of people and wanted a tray or something or if you end up getting full before you expected that you can completely finish one of these the following day. The rest of the store is really cute and they have a lot of variety (I have to try some of these oils and vinegars), although I didn't actually purchase anything on my first visit. But I'll definitely be back and hope to report on the products I buy in the store as well. Oh, but I did try some of their different cheese when I was there that were given to me...holy sharp provolone Batman! Just sayin.",0.9983,0.78,0.18,0.04,0.44140692640692647

So, in this experiment the submarine sandwich in question was priced at $2.25 more than the closest comparable Subway counterpart, however, the quality differential was 6 points, or 166% better.  In layman's terms, the sandwich cost an addition $.38 for each additional quality point awarded. Obviously tax is not factored in. If it were then this rate would be increased to $.41 per quality point awarded.  In sum, don't go to Subway.  Spend an extra $2 and experience sub sandwich perfection. *The authors are not responsible for any disagreements regarding the taste or quality of the aforementioned submarine sandwiches.

2010-05-16,5.0,"JP Graziano subs a the best hidden jewel in all of Chicago. In my opinion subs have become commoditized over the years with places like Subway, Jimmy Johns, and Quiznos... but when you go to JPG and order one of their subs you instantly remember what sub sandwiches are supposed to be. Fresh ingredients combined with special attention given to every sub make JPG a ""must eat"" location. I could be cliche and say ""everything I've had there is great, and you can't go wrong"". But in all truth, everything I have ever had there has been amazing. From the simple American or Turkey to the staples Italian or Prosciutto, Graziano subs are the best the city has to offer. A personal favorite of mine is the tuna with hot peppers. The quality tuna they used is nothing like you had when you were a kid. This tuna sub is a sophisticated sandwich that should make it into your rotation on your next visit to JPG. And finally the Pièce de Résistance; the newly introduced Mr. G sub. With layers of sopressata, prosciutto, salami, provolone, and artichoke hearts... this sandwich is AMAZING. At first glance all those ingredients sound like a bit much, but somehow its not. Its perfect. Add in fresh basil, truffle mustard balsamic vinaigrette, and my personal favorite; hot oil... and I begin to imagine that this is the type of food they only serve in heaven.

The other side is the sandwich counter that's open during lunch.  The Italian subs are delicious and a really good deal.  The bread is wonderful and the meats are authentic in style.  The sandwiches here destroy any fast food chain sandwich place.  It's one of two places I go to for Italian sandwiches; both are really similar to the other.

2008-08-12,5.0,"This place is fantastic.  Its right around the corner from my apartment and my roommate and I just stumbled upon it one day.  I think I've brought a dozen people from my office here since then and everyone loves this place. J.P.G's has been in their current location for 70 years but they've only recently started doing sandwiches during lunch time, but man am I glad they did.  If you live or work in the area its definitely worth the walk.",0.9267,0.832,0.168,0.0,0.5857142857142856
2008-07-16,5.0,"Great sub shop in the west randolph street wholesale district.  it is a bare bones, fresh sliced meat to sub operation.  Fantastic Spicy Italian sub for $5.25!!  You basically walk into a concrete room with 50 gallon drums of spices laying around.  I wandered by and saw a little sign on the sidewalk and walked in and got the Italian and not 10 minutes later there was a line out the door.",0.8906,0.858,0.142,0.0,0.33888888888888885
2008-05-22,3.0,"My favorite place to grab a sandwich during my lunch when I was working in the West Loop.  The food is really fresh & tasty, but I have mixed feelings about the service that I received. Sandwiches are made to order by very a friendly employee.  The extremely friendly lady who takes your money must be family. My only problem with this place has been getting someone to acknowledge my existence with the first 5 minutes when I walk in.  Now, I realize that this isn't exactly Subway.  For those who have never been here, it's really not a restaurant.  This is a warehouse & their business is mainly wholesale.  I'm sure that the other orders that are being worked on are much bigger than mine & my little sub order.  But you were the ones that put your sign out & invited my to buy your sandwich!  So I contemplate walking out.  I've decided that the service here is terrible.  And then you come to make my sandwich & you're so nice.  The thank you's that I get from the owners seem very genuine.  So I leave feeling like I want to give them more business.  Now I don't know what to do. Well, as it turns out, I keep going back because the sandwich really is very good.  I almost always never end up leaving with just my sandwich either.  Anyone in the West Loop who buys those little McCormick spices at the grocery store should have their head examined.  There is a decent variety of bulk spices here, as well as cheese & some canned goods.  Their hunk of Parmesan is much cheaper than what you would get at the grocery store, but it's not always in stock.  Since I no longer work so close to this place, I've stopped going for the cheese, just because it's so often not in stock (Go to Conte Di Savoia at Taylor & Laflin).  There was a short time when they offered some sort of homemade potato chips for sale with your sandwich.  Those chips were outstanding, but then they disappeared.  Are they back?  Man, those were good.",0.9892,0.816,0.138,0.046,0.5315637860082304
2008-05-19,5.0,Its a tough call between this place and Bari. This place sells the meat to Bari so they are very similar subs. Whichever one you go to it is a safe bet that your Scuzzway days are over. Dont be afraid to Italian everything plus mayo. Hands down the best sub in Chicago.,0.765,0.848,0.125,0.027,0.4774603174603174
2008-05-12,4.0,"Solid Italian sandwich spot, and you can pick up your olive oil, pasta, bulk spices, and huge cans of roasted red peppers here as well. Is it possible to say I love the old school feel of this place without sounding like a knob?  Didn't think so.",0.7958,0.765,0.195,0.04,0.4
2007-02-22,3.0,"i just had the spicy italian from there, my big ""beef"" with this place was the bread, if you like the hard italian bread that is tough to dig your teeth into and flakes off, you'll likely like it. the meat was fine...would not have minded more vinegarette. the giardiniera was good, but overall the bread made my experience not very enjoyable. i will take fontano's or this alpine's place any day of the week. note here, it was not bad...just did not wow me, that's all.",-0.6749,0.835,0.058,0.107,0.4578671328671329
2007-01-24,5.0,"Not too many years ago, the Fulton Market area was bustling with working warehouses. Jimmy the meat man hauled a frozen rack of ribs up Fulton, Jose stacked boxes of fresh produce into trucks on Randolph, and the Graziano family sold the finest mozzeralla and procuitto this side of Italy.  While many warehouses have come and gone, after four generations the Graziano family still owns and operates it's store out of it's corner spot at 901 Randolph.  For decades, this grocer has brought life to the neighborhood and more than assisted in packing on the pounds for many.  Papa Graziano really knows his stuff and is always willing to let you taste or smell something. Ask him to smell the basil. It's dried in a barrel but you would swear it was fresh off the plant.  If y'er looking for Whole Foods or Trader Joe's, this Italian gem isn't for you. Expect barrels of fava beans, tubs of fennel, and vats of delish olives to greet you in a small warehouse setting. The fresh parm cheese makes my tastebuds drool.  Papa Graziano will be sure to tell you a story or two, so visit when you have some time. Y'er belly will thank you.",0.9371,0.915,0.079,0.006,0.48134920634920636
