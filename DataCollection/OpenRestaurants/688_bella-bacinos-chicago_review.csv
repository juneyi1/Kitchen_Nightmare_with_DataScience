2017-09-04,1.0,When ordering a Chicago deep dish with sausage and jalapeño you'd think that you have your two main ingredients in every bite. Not the case here. I found four maybe five pieces of sausage and maybe 6 jalapeños. When your used to the whole pie having a layer of sausage........Very disappointed. Not worth the money.

When we were finally seated, the table was so wobbly, we had to hold onto our drinks as to not spill. We waited another 10 min for water. We ordered our dinner of pizza and linguine with an appetizer of bruschetta. Waited another 30 min for app. The pizza was then brought out for my husband but not my entree. He of course started to eat as we didn't want it to get cold. 1/2 way thru our waitress as ""how everything was?"" I said just waiting for my food and she assured me it would be right out. Another 10 minutes we ask again( this time my husband was almost finished with his dinner) our waitress then asked "" remind me again of what you ordered"" Finally was brought out 5 minutes later.

I was pleasantly surprised to see that this is an off-shoot of Bacinos (the great deep dish pizza restaurant).  We ordered their Spinach Supreme deep dish and it was very good. Not as good as Giordanos, but very good. They have one star employee...the girl with the shockingly red hair. She gave me a wonderful welcome and smile when I walked in. She took my order and seemed to do the majority of the hosting, serving, bussing etc. while I was there. She couldn't have been more pleasant and efficient. A delight!  I would steal her away if I had an available job for her.  The buzz-cut guy taking inventory at the wine cooler...not so much.

The pasta that was ordered came out after the pizza 10 minutes later we thought they forgot about it but since waiting staff was scarce coming to check on you was hard to ask about it.

2017-06-24,1.0,"We were walking around the city last night and trying to explore the possibilities of where to dine for our anniversary. We did come across Bella Bacinos and out on their patio it seemed to be extremely busy and we did take that as a sign that the food is pretty good and so is the service. After walking in and overhearing a lady saying ""Well that was pretty awful.."", we still decided to give this place the benefit of the doubt. It is supposed to be an Italian restaurant and having a family member working in the Lettuce Entertain You restaurant company, I'm familiar with how some things are supposed to be. The plates and the silverware is already supposed to be prepped and ready to go, especially on a busy Friday night and then more often than not, a bread bowl is served. Neither of these things happened last night.  Regardless, we continued since these factors didn't stand out until it all added up for us at the end of the meal. I had tried to order a limonata drink, which in my mind I had envisioned a housemade lemonade, our server politely told us they were out but they had pink lemonade and I quickly let her know that was perfectly fine. I still was envisioning a housemade refreshing drink to be coming my way. Unfortunately, I was disappointed when I just received a soda version of pink lemonade. It just threw me off and it left a bad taste in my mouth.  We had agreed on the fried calamari for our appetizer and since my boyfriend had been craving it for a while, I was happy to make sure he got to enjoy it here. It did take some time to arrive, which for a Friday night okay I had understood however I definitely did not expect it at all to come out on the verge of being cold. Besides the fact that I'm used to a higher quality with Lettuce, I did not have to think I would need to hope the fried fish would come to our table hot. Plus, I would give it the term fried incredibly loosely..it was more so poorly breaded which a lot of it even had come off and stayed in the adjacent sauce given with the dish. Something that I will add in randomly before going to talk about the main course dish we both had gotten was the little detail on their menus. It had said please ask your server for the fish special of the day, for the lasagna special of the day, the ravioli special of the day, and then another one that I am failing to remember at this point in time. I would have loved to been told about these specials while the server made her introduction because again, that's what most restaurants do and then the customer doesn't need feel bothersome for the server asking each of these specials.  My boyfriend had ordered the lasagna special of the day which seemed to be meat yesterday and he was quite pleased and excited to order it. I, on the other hand, chose the ravioli special of the day which was spinach and I, too, was looking forward to it and hoped it would be far superior to the quality of the appetizer we received. We got our food and upon looking at it, we had good feelings about it. He had taken the first bite of his and immediately he had made a face. I asked what was going on and he replied that it is incredibly salty. I had tried mine and it seemed okay but nothing special overall. He barely eat a quarter of the portion he was given due to the overwhelming taste of salt.  One last thing, both of us visited the restroom prior to leaving and neither of the restrooms had any soap whatsoever so that makes me wonder how do their employees wash their hands? Even if you don't think about the customer washing their hands, fine..but the employees? I know that this review is quite extensive however I just wanted to make sure these concerns are pondered upon for future customers of this restaurant..unfortunately, that will not be either of us.

We had the kale and apple salad, Bacino salad and Margherita Pizza. They're all meh. Bacino salad was not bad, kale salad was not good (the kale was not the freshest and yellowing, not massaged nor sliced in thin strips so they were kind of tough), the pizza had very little tomato sauce.

2016-11-27,2.0,"***Bella Bacinos serves a decent meatball sandwich, but there are just too many better restaurants in the nearby area to settle on this place*** Bella Bacinos has a great location in Downtown Chicago. It is right on Wacker so it sits right across the Chicago River. It is also very close to the Magnificent Mile. Despite the great location, this restaurant was quite empty for lunch. Bella Bacinos has an old-fashioned look and features a menu of mostly Italian classics. I wanted to try their deep dish pizza, but my lunch needed to be a quick lunch and their deep dish pizza takes a lot of time to make, which is about the same amount of time you will have to wait regardless of what deep dish restaurant you visit. I tried the meatball sandwich instead and opted for a side salad instead of fries. The side salad was not good since some of the greens were starting to brown. The meatball sandwich (it was served like a panini) was decent. It featured fairly good and fresh meatballs, a good tomato sauce and melted and stretchy mozzarella. The meatball sandwich was better than I expected given the lack of a crowd and the kind of boring menu. Service was okay. Despite being an empty restaurant, the staff did not come around that much. Once the order was in though, the food came out quickly. Prices are okay. You are not paying too much for lunch here though with restaurant rich Chicago, I imagine you can get far better food at the same price elsewhere. Bella Bacinos' meatball sandwich was surprisingly decent, but with a menu this big, I imagine some of the pastas and quite a few of the other dishes might be in the average range. There are so many more interesting Chicago restaurants within walking distance of this location, I would suggest looking elsewhere before settling on Bella Bacinos. Parking around this area would be very difficult. A CTA station is close by.",0.9842,0.796,0.138,0.066,0.5032539682539683

2016-10-06,1.0,"Group Dinner/Lunch = Not a good idea at Bella Bacinos First, if the downstairs area where they hosted our group dinner for 40-or-so was held upstairs where the pretty people sit, maybe it would be a better experience. At the very least, much prettier look and feel, and more upscale than the dank downstairs. Downstairs = not a good start to your experience. downstairs = no character. A few steps to the bathroom door, which is kind of gross? Waiters and busboys going in and out of other doors, to some other tables, probably where the good looking people sit upstairs. Downstairs has as much character as where people about to be executed have their last meal. Don't take my word for it. Through the inside doors, immediate left down to dinner experience hell. And if you don't order liquor, forget about it. It took 30 minutes for me to get iced tea. Last time I asked, I ordered three, thinking that might catch someone's attention. It worked. I got three ice teas, no ice. I miss the days when iced tea came with ice. I had to wait for ice. Then they brought a small glass of ice, like I was having liquor on the rocks. But, I survived. I found a water container with ice, stole it, and moved the ice into one of my three ice teas. The strategy was to drink that first, and then replenish the tea so that we can leverage the use of the ice I stole. Because I sure was not going to get any more ice that night. Ice in Chicago is like an honest politician in Chicago, I guess. Rare. They guy next to me - diet coke. Waited the same time I did. Meanwhile, those that ordered drinks were on their second round.   Dinner was to come out at 730pm. Arrived after 8pm, and then there was too little. Here is a tip: Even if you are with your friends, push and shove to get in front of the line because the more interesting pizza is gone early (as it was for our table) and all that is left is Cheese or Veggie. Cheese or Veggie. So, push and shove. Better ... they should be able to get pizza out quicker. By 8:45, reinforcement pizza never got there. So if you like non-alcoholic drinks, and pizza with something more than cheese and veggie, go anywhere else. Kind of sucked overall because it was only one of two night I had a chance to dine in Chicago in the last few years. And I wasted it at Bowels of Bella Bacinos.

This already got us confused because we didn't see a special menu nowhere in the Groupon. He brought us a tiny piece of paper which is a complete joke. The groupon menu literally has 3 items for appetizers (all priced at $6 on regular menu) three items for main entree (chicken and spaghetti that are not even on the regular menu) and two drinks. Let me start with the fact that the groupon costs $60 for what they claim is worth $96. I'm sorry but chicken and spaghetti is not worth $96.. Not worth $60 either ..

We showed him the phone and said no it doesn't to which he replied 'I don't know where it says it but it does' and he walked away only to come back with a print out that read 'prix fixe' He yelled at us and walked away so we just grabbed our stuff and left.

When we told the waitress the Groupon does not have this menu on it she informed us they have had lots of issues with it and said she would get the manager. That's when he walked up did not say hi, did not introduce himself, he just laid a piece of paper on the table and pointed to the heading and said it says it right there and walked off. Well it says Prix Fixe dinner for two. I like how the important part is written in Italian. I am guessing he was agitated because he probably has to do that 100 times a day since the Groupon does not have any info of the ""special menu"" in the narrative it just nicely conceals it in Italian where you would never pay attention. If it is an issue with everyone maybe you should fix it and not be rude Mr. Manager. Needless to say we left and canceled the Groupon. It is a shame too considering I live two blocks from there and if he was not so rude we would have stayed and maybe been return customers. But he did'nt and we will never go back there again.

The Pizza was perfect, it was the thin crust variety, not terribly popular in Chicago, but done superbly well.  The wife's Pasta looked superb, and she pronounced fitting judgement by cleaning up the plate.  We had some banter with the lady about the quality of the food, and she understood enthusiasts like none other.  She bantered right back and it was a great culinary experience. My father has always maintained that the perfect number for a good meal is two: you and a damned good head-waiter, and now I know why.  With this lady, the meal became a simple instruction of trust. And, by the way, the place was heaving when we left. So more Italian in dinnertime than American, which is also a good sign.

I came as part of a larger group (11 people) for dinner one night in September. I didn't want pizza, so I opted for what I hoped would be a 'healthier' option: salmon and veggies. We were able to get our orders placed fairly quickly, but that's about the only thing that went well. I had to ask for a water and tea refills constantly, as no one would come by to refill either. I spent more than half the meal without a drink, waiting for a refill (and waiting for the waiter to bring the requested beverages). I'm assuming a table of 11 is auto-grated, so perhaps he didn't care if we got any attention (not sure).  When the food finally came, never have I ever been more disappointed in the presentation of food. The salmon (listed as wild caught Alaskan on the menu) was clearly farm raised-strike 1 (I only want wild caught salmon because farmed raised is pumped FULL of terrible things). The 'sauce' the fish was cooked/drowned in literally made the dish look like a soup, and was primarily with a heavy cream- strike 2 (who eats salmon with a heavy cream sauce?) The 'fresh veggies' on the side consisted of cold, previously frozen asparagus and halved cherry tomatoes- Strike 3 (FRESH does not mean frozen. period).  Regardless, I tried to salvage what I could of the fish, but the sauce was so overwhelming that it made the whole dish inedible. Again, I was waiting or a refill of both water and tea while trying to choke down my meal- strike 4 (gag).

Dinner service on a Tuesday night: One would expect a salad order, placed 35 minutes before the pizza was expected, to arrive before the pizza, yes? Uh ... no. The pizza arrived - lukewarm - at the same time as the pizza, and the bartender explained that the pizza was actually ready before the salad was. Still, the pizza was tasty enough and I enjoyed half of it, then tried to close out my tab and take the rest back to my room.  I was sitting at the bar, three feet from the bartender, yet it was IMPOSSIBLE to get the bartender's attention, even up to the point that he left the restaurant to deliver a couple of room service orders. (The bartender? Really? The one guy slinging drinks for the entire place, with three customers sitting at his bar, and HE'S the one who has to deliver the room service orders?) That was Tuesday. Wednesday morning, I decided to give them another chance for breakfast. Service was inattentive but not too slow (even though the restaurant was busy), and the food was okay, so I returned on Thursday morning; BIG mistake. A half-hour after I had sat down in the nearly-empty restaurant and ordered, my scrambled eggs were still not on my table and I had run out of time to eat breakfast. The waiter mumbled an apology, saying the ""the cooks were downstairs and the elevator was broken"" - a lame excuse given that people seated after me had received their meals. The kicker, though, was that the waiter did not offer a comp or discount for the coffee and juice I had ordered, or even ask me to come back to give them another chance. He simply dropped the bill for my beverages on the table. The manager would not even make eye contact with me as I left. I regret having to leave such a negative review, but I would regret giving the poor service a pass even more. While tasty, the food's three-star quality cannot justify the service at this restaurant.

2012-10-18,3.0,"It's a little discreet hiding out in it's building on Wacker, Bella Bacino's is your fairly average Italian joint with what I suppose would be exactly what you expect. Pizzas, pastas, a selection of antipasti. If being an Italian joint was a job, hey, it got the job done. It has the prerequisite dim lighting and candles. And in the downstairs room, you get a bit of quiet privacy while listening to late 90s, early 00s hits... nothing more romantically Italian! But let's get to the food. Aside from the menu, there's also a pizza menu which details a ""build your own"" sort of deal. ""Specialty"" pizza (more like traditional thin Italian), thin pan pizzas, and deep dishes. The bread comes out a bit of a bland tasteless thing to chew on with a bit of a shaker of olive oil. Okay, not the best (the second bread basket was... eh, burnt). I ordered the Caesar salad. It was certainly a decent salad, but didn't quite have the bite of a Caesar that I'd like. A bit more of a bite of Romano or anchovy would have spruced it up. I followed it up with a pesto pizza, with goat cheese and onion and pepper. The crust was crisp, and the flavor of the pizza was quite good. Service was prompt and helpful.

Had a couple of the pressed panini's which were done very well, salmon and grilled veggies. The veggie mix was not what you would get in some places like say 50% onions, some carrot slices...here it was a nice, crunchy mix of zuchinni, squash, eggplant, peppers, some melty cheeeese, nice, crusty bread. The salmon one was a-ok too, maybe a bit more of the pinkie fishy woulda coulda. But both hit the spot on the dot, and the side salads was good greens moist and groovy good too.  We didn't try the pizzas but based on what I saw wouldn't mind a buncha big or tight bites. Pasta dishes seemed to have other diners smiling the smile as well. We were leaving and had a few moments before our ride to the airport. I was starvin' and decided on the aforementioned panini yet again...and, threw in the Polenta with Mushroom Ragu.

I think I would have enjoyed sitting inside, but my husband insisted on sitting outside.  The outside area is nothing special, but it works.  The waitress was fine, not spectacular,  not overly friendly, but not bad. We ordered the calamari.  I can see why some people may not like this. It is only the rings, not the big globs of squid, but I thought it was fine.  It was not soggy or rubbery and the portion was quite large.  Definitely not the best, but better than many, as many places don't do calamari well.   I had a house salad, which was large and tasty.  I love salads and get them most of the time when I go out.  The portion was large and the dressing was good.  It was fresh and I did not see anything wilted.   We had to request bread, although the menu said it was included with our pasta entrees.  I was a little annoyed at this, but I've run across this frequently as of late.  If the menu says ""includes bread"" please bring me my bread!  That being said, it was nothing really special.  It was fine, but not garlic bread or something I would think you'd get at an Italian restaurant.  It was not dry or anything, it was actually kind of doughy and comforting, but maybe more of a tomato basil taste?   We both got the capellini pomodoro.  We both thought it was very good.  We were in the mood for something like ""spaghetti.""  Comfort food.  It was almost 10pm and we were so hungry.  The serving was so large we could have easily shared.  We both had at least 1/2 left when we were done. Overall I'd say we probably won't return as there are so many other restaurants in the area, but it got the job done.  It was an average experience, but the salad and entrees were really quite good (this pasta better than the ""square noodles"" people rave about at Rosebud's.  Sorry!).  I was satisfied and felt like the prices were fine, especially for the size of the portions.  The waitstaff could have been a little friendlier, even if it was the end of the night/shift.  The pizza looked good....we didn't have any, but most of the tables around us had pizza and if I could eat pizza, I would have.  Everything smelled amazing, too!",0.9938,0.78,0.156,0.065,0.5265288220551378

In a town like Chicago the bar for great food is going to be set exceedingly high. The woman who booked the reservations was sent there by the Hyatt's concierge, which is always a bad sign and I'm fairly certain this is the only way this place gets customers...subterfuge.

We were seated and a warm loaf of tomato basil flavored bread was quickly delivered to our table. It was the best part of the meal and had it not been there I would have run out of the place for my own safety. Appetizers: Fried calamari served with cocktail sauce- soggy and gross. Sausage and cheese plate- tolerable, but mediocre at best.  Prosciutto Flat Bread- dry and difficult to eat as the crust would disintegrate and leave you with hanging dried pork coming out of your mouth.  Minestrone- I don't think abomination is strong enough of a word.  Dinner:  I'll spare this section as no one at our table enjoyed their entree.  Dessert: Skipped it.  For the food you have access to in Chicago this place just shouldn't exist. I beg you to explore other options and remember if you're thinking this place there are a handful of other joints that are in the same general area and a million times better.

Other ingredients were well cooked and the sause was fairly good, but the MUSSELS were HALF COOKED.I complained to the waiter about this and the message that I got from the chef was just simple apology through the waiter, not from the chef himself. Also, the waiter asked me if I wanted the check WHILE I was still eating, not even asking me for dessert menu. Apparently the restaurant taught waiters/waitress to make sure to collect guests' money ASAP instead of providing excellent services.  Oh, FYI-, the Frutti di Mare is misspelled on the menu. I suggest updating the menu and double checking on the spellings.  To be honest, If this happens in NYC, this restaurant will seriously go out of business in less than 6 months (if they're lucky).

It took an hour to get food, and about 15 minutes before the waiter even came by. They can definitely not handle a full restaurant. The waiters are assigned tables in every part of the place, including the outside, so they were running back and forth to all parts of the restaurant. With all this running around, I rarely saw them carrying food, but always saw them with dirty dished and glasses. It seems that they do not have bus boys of any type assisting with this stuff, so the waiters were responsible for everything. It was terrible. We finally ordered, took another 20-25 minutes to get the pizza (deep dish spinach), and it was not very hot, so the cheese already started getting solid. It was nothing special at all.

The staff was frazzled and as we walked in, a customer was complaining to the manager about poor service. We waited anyway and were seated in about 30 minutes. We ordered the polenta with mushroom ragu appetizer which was hard on the outside and very uncooked on the inside. We were also given plastic forks and knives because the kitchen staff was backed up. It amazes me that for a restaurant that charges $17 - $25 an entrée, they could not wash two sets of silverware. I also ordered the ""fish in crazy water"" entrée.  The fish and shrimp in the tomato sauce was tasty but the mussels were not fresh. Easting an entire order of the mussels would have surely made someone sick. To top it off, the manager was sitting at a table nearby entertaining friends while her staff was struggling to keep up.

We split a Bacino's house salad; the balsamic vinaigrette dressing was really good.  And ordered a large Bacinos Special deep dish; Italian sausage, mushrooms, green peppers and onions.  Our server stuttered a bit, just making sure he heard little ol' me correctly.  He warned us a large deep dish is very, well LARGE.  Perhaps a medium would be enough.  I assured him, we really did want a large and leftovers are what it's all about.  When the pizza came out, I have to say I was the one stammering.  That is one large MF!  Our server then asked if I wanted to take a picture as he plated our first slices.  Here I am like heck yea!  I whip out my camera and captured probably the best pizza porn picture (quote from Dan G.) I have ever captured in my life.  Aside from a great looking photo, the pizza was orgasmic.  Loaded with cheese (I would have been just as happy with a little less cheese), the crust was crisp on the bottom and the seasoning was really good.  Both the hubby and I put a way one too many slices but we still had enough leftovers for 2 days.

2011-06-12,1.0,"Warning - especially to those future employees! While yes, Bacinos food is great and the atmosphere is pleasing, little do people know what goes on behind the scenes within this popular restuarant.  This is the most unorganized and chaotic place to work at and I would never even suggest anyone to eat there are seeing the state of the disgusting and dirty kitchen they're covering up. First of all the management seems to be non-existent.  There were many times where a manager or owner never bothered to come in at all during the day, leaving only the servers and kitchen staff to fend for their own. Which meant if a problem ever came up it had to be ignored because no one would be around to talk to a customer.  And when the management is around they are rude, condecending, and treat their employees as if they are incompetant to do the simplest task.  Instead of giving postive encouragement they talk down to their employees making many of them negative towards the resturant and leaking into being negative towards customers. The kitchen is also very unoraganized and it's a miracle they get out any food at all.  There is no support staff in the morning and only one cook so the servers have to do the extra work keeping them from their tables.  So if you're sitting there wondering where your server has been for the last 20 minutes after you asked for a coffee refill it's because they are in the back making toast and cutting fruit.  Also, about the coffee, there is never enough so don't even bother asking for a refill, and after seeing the disgusting mold growing underneath the coffee machine I wouldn't want it anyway.  The tables are never cleaned and the floors are never mopped, so just pray that silverware isn't dropped on the ground and put back on your plate.  Yes, I have seen that happen. I would never send even my worst enemy to dine here because of these problems.  But I will say this that the servers and support staff they do have here, despite everything, are very hard workers and do the best under the circumstances they work under.  Do not blame them.   I never write reviews on anything, but I had to get all of this out in the open because I believe you as a guest or even a future employee deserve to know what really goes on here.  I hope they improve because it is such a cute little place with great pizza, but something seriously needs to be done before 5 stars are given with a review.",0.9569,0.816,0.108,0.076,0.5634137426900585

Three things I like about Bella Bacino's:  1) Mushroom Ragu with Rigatoni / Penne Bolognese: These are actually two different dishes which I usually can't choose between. The Mushroom Ragu is filled with wild mushrooms in a red sauce that's not too heavy. The Bolognese is unique, a finely ground meat sauce that's mixed with cream and truffle oil. (My strategy is to have them add mushrooms to the Bolognese sauce).  2) Salads: The house salad of field greens is quite nice and good size. Spit it with your date if you only want a bite. Try the Warm Nut Crusted Goad Cheese salad too.  3) Outdoor View: The inside seating is unexceptional, but in the summer there are tables right out on Wacker, looking down the canyon of buildings and bridges that line the river.

2010-10-12,3.0,"Was attending a convention at McCormick and spending the nights at a nearby hotel.  Late at night decided to get a bite to eat and didn't want to venture far from the hotel.  A colleague had mentioned that he had eaten there the night before and liked it, so decided to give it a try. It was 9PM and was able to walk in and was seated right away.  It was a weeknight and was fairly empty.  My waitress was good - attentive. However, there were other waiters, who either were no longer working or just heading out, who were talking loudly to each other in the middle of the restaurant, handing off tables to each other, meeting up with friends and walking through the place, talking and joking - pretty disruptive and unprofessional. I ordered 2 appetizers. First the sausage and cheese platter.  Pretty good. 4 different types of cheese served with dried apricots and berries and carmelized walnuts.  One of the cheeses was smokey (not my cup of tea), one was a chunk of parmesan (which is not possible to put on bread) and the other two were so similar that I thought they might actually be the same cheese variety. Sausages - about the same. 4 different varieties, 2 very similar- if not the same.  Other 2 quite good.  I guess the main complaint was that they had run out of their special bread that they were known for.  I thought I was getting french bread instead, which would have been just fine - but was surprised when I got pieces of plain old toast. Kind of disappointing. Next I ordered the gorgonzola and pear salad. It was very tasty.  The various salad varieties and dressing were a bit bitter, but the sweetness of the pears was a nice balance. I won't be running back here again for dinner, too many other good choices available.  The outside seating looked interesting though and I could imagine that lunch on a nice day could be fun and worth a try.",0.9789,0.818,0.132,0.05,0.48456277056277053

BB was fine on both counts, but the food is pretty unremarkable.  The other reviews had suggested that the pizza is the way to go. Mom and I split a Margherita pizza while Mike had pasta with sausage, which the waiter warned was a little spicy. Mom and I also split a gorgonzola and pear salad. The pears were tasty and poached in red wine, though there was only a sliver between each of us. The Gorgonzola chunks were way too big and overpowered every mouthful--they needed to be cut in half. Otherwise the salad was fresh but not that flavorful. Mike's pasta came out piping hot, but our pizza was lukewarm. It is Neapolitan style, with a very thin, crispy crust. Fresh chopped basil was strewn everywhere and liked to jump off the pizza if you weren't looking. Each slice was topped with a mozzarella slice that purported to be from a water buffalo. The cheese was nice and salty, but a tad overcooked so you couldn't really get the authentic flavor. The crust was fine. The thing I like about Neapolitan pizzas is that you really feel like you're eating a *pie* with delicious, mingled flavors, but Mom and I have made better pizzas at home. We also had flourless chocolate cake that was more like a pudding, and I ordered two random glasses of white wine, neither of which were that good. They were too tart and bland. I thought this restaurant was serviceable. The decor was nice and our waiter was friendly as we took forever to order because we were catching up. He certainly bantered a lot with the other tables.

2009-01-02,5.0,"My deep dish meter might be somewhat out of calibration, considering I no longer live in Chicagoland, and there's absolutely no edible deep dish pie anywhere in the DMV that I've yet uncovered.  So on one of my rare trips back home to visit family, it's usually high on my list of priorities to find me some -real- pizza and beer to satisfy my needs. Enter Bacino's.  I think the last time I had Chicago style pizza was at another location of Bacino's in Lincoln Park.  It just so happened to be almost exactly one year ago when I was in town for training for my former employer.  I fell in love with it then (which isn't unusual when I'm offered great conversation and free samples of beer by a business owner) so it seemed appropriate to bring the boy (who had never had -real- pizza before) to a Bacino's to try it out. Reservations were easy to make, although they ended up being unnecessary on New Year's Day.  Even rolling in just before 1900, we were one of three or four tables seated upstairs.  The joint filled up during the time we were there, but emptied back out again.  Plus, there's a decent sized space downstairs (also, where the restrooms are located)... I presume they're used for private parties or when it's extremely packed.  I especially appreciated the amazingly cool back wall made of various winery crates - I only recognized a handful that I'd seen in Napa, but it was definitely an extra special touch. The menu options include a variety of Italian dishes in addition to both thin and stuffed pizza, but I'm not sure why one would bother with any of them given the availability of deep dish.  Or maybe that's just me being a glutton.  Regardless, we went with a stuffed spinach special, and another stuffed with Italian sausage, mushrooms, and pesto.  Note that pesto is not actually an ingredient offered on the menu for stuffed pizzas, but our server was nice enough to ask about it, and the cooks were nice enough to make an attempt at putting it in the filling at our request. In the interim, while we waited the thirty or so minutes for our pies of deliciousness to cook up, we caught up, had a couple of Rogue Dead Guy Ales (another discovery and love-at-first-guzzle I made during my last Bacino's visit).  Boy is the wait worth it!  Two medium stuffed pizzas among five boys and we -still- ended up with a whole three-quarters of a pie left over.  While the stuffed spinach was amazingly delicious and spinach-y, the clear winner was the Italian sausage with mushrooms and pesto.  I'm not sure why pesto isn't listed as a regular ingredient, but it is absolutely -amazing- cooked into a deep dish pizza.  I kind of almost wished they used more.  Yum! Again, being a relatively slow evening, we weren't rushed out after finishing (well, more like surrendering to...) our meal.  Getting a twenty broken for change was readily accommodated by our genial server, and we got to hang out, tell stories, and laugh the New Year's Day evening away.  Good times with good people, good drinks, and damn good grub (who can argue against -real- pizza?).  This is what Chicagoland means to me.",0.996,0.806,0.145,0.049,0.4887987584311113
