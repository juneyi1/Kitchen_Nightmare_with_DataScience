With Italian sausage, eggs, cheese, onions & potatoes, it's every desirable breakfast item all in one!

They open for breakfast before anyone else and their ""Corned Beef Jumpball"", made with grilled onions, cubed potatoes, and corned beef, is unbelievable. I actually drive to Chicago to get this Jumpball. You have to ask for it because it is not on the menu, but their regular Jumpball is just as good and made with Italian Sausage, 3 eggs, cheese, onions and potatoes. BJ runs it and he was a Chicago Cop who walked this beat before picking up Moon's, which has continually been in business since 1933. The people watching is as good as the sandwiches, especially in the morning when you get a lot of night workers coming off their shifts.

I got the dinner, tuna salad sandwich and a british burger for later. The burger was good, the tuna salad pretty meh even though they pack it pretty thick.  Right off the bat the dinner disappointed me, the sandwich wasn't premade, everything was put into a standard lunch tray with two pieces of bread on top.

The corned beef is lean and tasty, very comparable to other delis where one would expect to pay much more for a same quality corned beef sandwich.  Moon's piles on the corned beef without skimping that is for sure.  A thin bread of your choice, rye was mine along with crisp lettuce, chips and a drink for under 10 bucks.  A bargain! However, Moon's might be a culture shock for those that live east of Western Ave. as the affluent meet their poorer cousins and fall in love over a great sandwich.  Moon's is in dire need of a top to bottom clean up without destroying any of the 1940's paneling or decor.  This place borders on the historic and needs to be preserved. Moon's corned beef is exceptional.  Moon's desperately is in need of a Spring cleaning! Minus one (1) star for lack of complete cleanliness.  ****",0.97,0.763,0.167,0.069,0.5542222222222222

My partner had the corned beef sandwich that can easily beat  AP Deli and Manny's Deli it comes with a tiny bag of chip and a can of soda. The corned beef was freshly cut and the juices were bursting off the meat. Now the drawback: The place is a dive and needs a good sandblasting wash. The employees are quick and attentive.

2014-07-15,5.0,"Best breakfast in Chicago as well as best corn beef.... A hidden gem. This is a 1920's sandwich shop that has managed to survive in a struggling area of Chicago. It is a very unique place that is a throwback and a true piece of history. It is not polished, it is not fancy and don't expect a great deal of ""presentation"". They are famous for their corned beef which is excellent, I have had it in an omelette, in a sandwich and by itself. I can say I personally am not a fan of their house specialty corned beef dinner with the brown gravy slathered on top as it is just to heavy and does not taste like a good match to me. Many people like it, I would suggest taking a pass on the gravy.  However their omelettes are excellent, I love their grits and all their breakfast type food is quite good. My favorite is a ham and cheese omelette with a side of grits. The food is honestly probably more like a 4 star overall, but the atmosphere pushes it over the edge.

I walked over and ordered a corned beef on wheat with extra mustard only. I guess the cashier/owner was having a bad day cause he said a corned beef on rye with extra mayo? I said NO on wheat with extra mustard who orders a corned beef  with mayo? NOT ME EVER. Anyway I felt really uncomfortable with people coming in reaching over me, bumping into me and not saying excuse me or anything. I looked at the stringy sandwich when I got to my car and was instantly upset. Why did the sandwich have lettuce and tomato on it and rye bread and light mustard?

But still wouldn't fit in with the locals hanging out here just yet! I got the tuna salad on wheat with lettuce and tomato, which was the only thing on the menu apart from the grilled cheese that a vegetarian-leaning pescatarian could order.  It was tasty, and they were super generous with the tuna-scooping!  It was well-made tuna salad, too.  But sparse on the veggies, as is the case with the menu in general. My mom got the famed corned beef and thought it was good, but maybe a little stringy.  But we were both truly amazed at the value of the meals here, paying about $12 for both of our sandwiches!

We all have the Famous Moon Corned Beef sandwich and it was so delicious. There was a behemoth mound of corned beef in between the buns!!! It was very fresh, rich and moist. It was far from dry (I hate those). The rye bread was not over powering in taste and soft as well. I also had a side of hashbrowns with my sandwich. They potatoes hit the spot! This all hit the spot!

If you think that any shop or deli in Chicago sells blow-your-freakin-mind-omg-so-so-so-good-best-thing-ever Jewish fare, you are also wrong.  However, Moon's comes awfully close when it comes to corn beef. Having been to the famous NYC delis, I have tasted what is probably the pinnacle of Jewish fare in the states (or at least accessible Jewish fare; maybe there's some unknown amazing place in Nowhere-ville). I have been to Moon's twice, and both times their corn beef sandwich has been consistently moist and delicious. It doesn't blow my mind, but definitely concussion-oh-wtf-just-happened-oh-yummy-sandwich good.  Yes, I have been to Manny's. Yes, this is better than Manny's, much much better. Yes, I have been to Manny's more than once and I still think Moon's is better.  I think my fellow Yelpers and foodies should be aware of a few things before they go out and hunt down Moon's: 1. A corn beef sandwich is $8 and change after tax. I am cheap and eat a lot, and I still think it is sizable and well worth the money. 2. The area is not the best. Honestly, it's pretty ghetto.

The staff were very friendly (eager to share storied of their history in the neighborhood to a group of teachers). For as much food as we ordered the bill was much less than your typical Chicago diner.,0.9299,0.823,0.177,0.0,0.46309523809523817
2010-01-07,5.0,Agree with everyone else on the list.  I have been twice and the corned beef sandwich is a 10.  Think Manny's for half price.  The reason it is half price is the location.  It does look like an abandoned building and not my typical socio-economic group.  Having said that everyone I spoke with and met was nothing but nice and happy to have the business. I did take out and will be everytime I head down to the stadium,0.5502,0.836,0.104,0.061,0.5203703703703703
2009-11-10,4.0,"I stopped by here the other day after I heard they had a good corned beef sandwich.  I had heard correctly.    I'll start by saying that my rating is based on the food alone.  If you pass by the building you will probably assume that is abandoned. And no, I am not joking, the place is a certifiable dump.   Don't let that discourage you though. Anyways, the sandwich was huge, the corned beef was really really tender and flavorful and the fries were very tasty also.  Prices were decent, I think my sandwich combo was around $8 and it was one of the most expensive on the menu.  The folks that worked there were definitely interesting, I'm sure the place has some stories.   Anyway, if you want a solid sandwich I would recommend picking up from here, it was damn good and not something you find everyday.",0.7555,0.753,0.147,0.1,0.533119658119658
2009-04-09,5.0,"If I gain 50 lbs this summer, I'm blaming Moon's. This is one of those places that time has forgotten but, thankfully, its legion of fans have not.  I've been thinking about Moon's a lot lately as I'm often working in the condo building next door and am frequently asked about ""that hole in the wall"" by the clients. Before my poor, unsuspecting buyers know what has hit them, they are subjected to Jenny's patented ""Don't judge a book by it's cover"" restaurant lecture.   Don't make me give  you the same lecture (I don't care WHAT it looks like, corned beef second only to Manny's and a heckuvalot cheaper, open since the 1930's, grits and eggs, salami omelets, chili-mac, depression style burgers, great mashed potatoes and meatloaf, silly nice staff, fried salami sandwiches, cheap, cheap, cheap and delicious, off the menu sides of corned beef available with breakfast, recipient of an LTH GNR award, it's a cop hangout, so you know the food is great, an ungodly delicious breakfast concoction called the jumpball, corned beef available with GRAVY), just get over there, slide up to the counter, and see for yourself. Oh yeah, bonus points as the name ""Moon's"" supposedly derives from certain activities during prohibition.  Seriously, it doesn't get much better than this.   Did I mention the corned beef?",0.9846,0.733,0.186,0.081,0.5971861471861473
2008-12-10,4.0,"From the outside, this place looks like a rundown shack... but every time I drive by it, there is a line of people going in and out.... which made me wonder... ""Hmmm... is this one of those hole in the walls that have ridiculously good food?"" I'm happy to say, that at least this was partially true. As an pre-dominately Asian crowd post Illini game, we entered and definitely wondered how we would be welcomed.  And suprisingly, we were welcomed with open arms... Sat down at the bar, ordered up a meatloaf sandwich, and chatted it up with the regulars.  The place has been open for over 60 years serving up good food at VERY reasonable prices.  Ownership has changed multiple times, but the regulars told me the food quality to price ratio has stayed consistent. Ultimately, the meatloaf sandwich was a whopping $5 and tasty.  The corned beef, while $7, was ridiculously large and a much better deal for the price... According to my roommate - ""A good solid pork chop sandwich"" as well. One of the key things that I remember is the customer service.  Not only were all the servers genuinly happy and excited to be there, they fully enjoyed seeing their old customers come back in to visit them.  In fact, the meatloaf sandwich came out to $5.09.  As I was grasping for change, the server just said ""Don't worry about it... what's nine cents, right?""   Ultimately, affordable food, good quality, friendly people, and a landmark that has been around for decades.  Great service that is focused on the customer, and definitely a place that my roommates and I plan to visit again in the future. Corned beef?  Not quite as good as Manny's Deli in my humble opinion... but also significantly cheaper and delicious. Take a visit!  You'll be pleasantly surprised...",0.9981,0.73,0.253,0.017,0.5534147334147334
2008-08-29,5.0,"AP Deli has nothing on Moon's Corned Beef platter- which includes mashed potatoes w/ gravy, corn, and bread. The outside of the restaurant is kinda shabby, but like the old saying goes 'looks isn't everything' which definitely speaks well about this place. This place closes at 3pm...what a shame it doesn't say open longer.",-0.3679,0.796,0.089,0.114,0.3125
2008-08-05,4.0,"I always thought this place was abandoned until one day, the new field manager brought me a breakfast sandwich. I bit into heaven masquerading as an egg, ham, and cheese union of near holy excellent and became a convert.  This is definitely a take-out place as there is standing room only and the orders are turned out as quickly as they come in.  Everything is good, but if you insist on a recommendation, I'd say get one of each.",0.6486,0.868,0.106,0.026,0.6363636363636365
2007-10-17,5.0,"I try to go here before any United Center event I attend. The food is awesome and in big portions. Meatloaf sandwich, rib tip sandwich, corned beef sandwich, you get the gist. The grits are awesome too (I don't even like grits- this is the only place I eat them at) I've never gone without being the only white person in there, but it makes no difference to me or them, so don't be afraid to stop by before a Bulls game. A little bit dingy, so not really a place to stop by with your whole family. Seems like a lot of people do takeout though. Place closes at 3.",-0.6828,0.83,0.061,0.109,0.5500000000000002
