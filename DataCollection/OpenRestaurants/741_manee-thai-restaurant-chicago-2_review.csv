2017-07-28,3.0,"The Thai egg rolls are fantastic. 2 per order--but they're bigger than spring rolls. Really delicious. Unfortunately the red curry was not so great. I couldn't decide whether to get chicken or tofu (because I'm particular), so I called ahead of time and asked if the tofu was soft or firm and if it's fried. Woman on the phone said fried and firm. Well, it arrived... and it's firm, but not fried. That's fine. But the part that gets me is that it tastes as if cows milk was used over coconut milk. No sweetness. Very bland. So that was verrrrrry disappointing. My boyfriend who got the Massaman curry loved his. He got it with chicken and beef.

I'm really upset that the fact they use wheat flour isn't anywhere on the menu and now I will most likely have a flare up.

The option to BYOB is a great pair for any of the dishes this restaurant will come serve you. Crab Rangoon here are amazing, first and foremost. For being so small in size, these bites pack a powerful hit in quality flavor. For an entree, I had the green curry which comes with a little bowl of sticky rice. Luckily the green curry came with so much sauce, I could not get over how rich in spices the dish was altogether. What I wasn't crazy about was the dessert, which was the Pumpkin Custard. I was not a huge fan of the texture, but did enjoy the great pumpkin flavor it had. The menu is loaded with desserts on top of appetizers, entrees, authentic beverages (delicious fruit smoothies, anyone?), and a whole section dedicated to sushi. I did not have the opportunity to try any of the sushi- I suppose I'll make my next trip to this place all about the sushi. I really do adore this restaurant.

The tempura is a hearty portion for the price, and while it's not the worst, it's not the best. It's average. Their crab in a basket thing is a fun concept that is a little better than average. Probably the best of all the appetizers aforementioned, but that's REALLY not saying a lot. I actively hated their chow mein. Couldn't finish it. Picked out the beef, ate that, and only that. In their defense, the beef was cooked PERFECTLY. The flavor, however, was terrible. But their saving grace: the sushi! Holy crap is it amazing. Love their Manee signature roll + the Spicy Tako roll or whatever it was. For the first time ever, really enjoyed the simple California roll I tried.

2016-09-27,4.0,"I went with my family Tuesday night to try out this restaurant my dad have been talking about. The service was super fast and wonderful. We sat at two tables, but the staff was running around trying to find space to put two table together for us. That was very thoughtful of them. . I had the pad see mai with pork (I think I might have spell it wrong). It wasn't all that good. Although the noodle was chewy and perfect, the beef part was a little over cook. Some of my beef piece was burnt. So there were some bitter aftertaste. However my little sister order the orange chicken. I was thinking it would come out looking like how chicken nugget with orange sauce, but it came out looking super delicious. The chicken was in long strip and very delicious. She also had a side order of dumpling, but she said there wasn't any flavor. They did give her soy sauce though. My brother Kung pao chicken, and he said it taste okay. He accidentally ate the dried pepper and it was super spicy that he had to drink a whole glass of water plus eat spoonful of rice. It was a funny experience. I would highly recommend everyone try this place out either for lunch or for dinner. The place is very open (not sure how else I would describe it) but the table are put too close to one another. You might bump to another table when you walk in or out. At the table there already plates and fork wrap in paper towel. Some of the food you order come with spoon, but if you need extra spoon or if you need a chopstick ask them for it. The waiter would come back to the table a few time to refill your water and ask if you need anything. That remind me, one of the girl waiter has an accent so you must listen very carefully and it would be better if you can certify back to the menu to see if it is the right order. The pricing were about $10 a dish, however, the sushi and seafood were about $20 and up. I saw the dragon sushi from the other table and it look absolutely beautiful.

But with that comes a trained palette. And that just points out obvious things.  I have eaten here more that a dozen times easy.. So I was sick Today and for lunch I ordered two chicken pad Thai's, a rainbow roll, and a green curry entrée. The sushi was flawless. Let me repeat that, completely flawless.  Green curry was pretty dang yummy if I might say so.  So here we go into the poor experience of the pad Thai and the nail In the coffin. I am well aware that consistency from the hot kitchen of this restaurant is never their forte. Someone could literally order 12 pad thai's over the course of the day and at the end of the night put them side-by-side and they will all look and taste different. This is absolutely unacceptable. Today one of my pad Thai's was so dry that you can literally use a fork & a knife and cut the pasta apart like a baked casserole. Just made me so so unhappy.  The next pad Thai had more egg than noodles; the eggs were overcooked and browned by cooking too long in one spot. Burnt eggs taste horrific ppl! This place has a good location and a great sushi program. It seems like the sushi chefs should over see the hot kitchen, because whoever is overseeing them now in my professional opinion would be relieved of their job immediately. In my final opinion, just because you have the recipe for a pad Thai doesn't mean you should cook it if you don't know how!  On the other hand people should make the trip to try the sushi program and their menu, it's really delicious and extremely consistent",0.964,0.816,0.124,0.06,0.6436443932411675

Now for the price, if you're gonna compare the price to other Asian restaurant, it's a bit pricey here at Manee Thai. Our tab came out to be $80 for two entree, one appetizer, two drinks and one maki. $80 for two people is a bit too much. The food are decent it's not the best Asian food I've tried but it works.

I would think a place like this, a BYOB Thai/Sushi restaurant  a couple of blocks away from another (Hot Woks Cool Sushi) would want to keep the rolls a bit more affordable, especially when lacking in reputation. It can be hard to justify taking a chance on a new place for sushi when the reviews are ""so-so"" at best and the rolls are not cheap.  The Orange Chicken came in giant, tender sized pieces which you'd think would be great- assuming they were actual strips of chicken breast meat.

I recommend the Crunchy Spicy Tuna Lover roll, the Moonlight roll, the Shrimp in a Clay pot, and the Tom Yum soup.  I'm no food critic or gastronome, but here goes my attempt to describe this to you:  -The rolls I named are on the heavier side, rich with delicious sauce, colorful veggies, and tempura, but their basic rolls are fresh and tasty as well.   -The Clay Pot dish has simple glass noodles, shrimp, carrots, and celery which have been sauteed in their own soy sauce and steamed in a personal terra cotta pot.   -The Tom Yum noodle soup was fragrant, and flavorful, and a generous portion This place is BYOB and has plenty of space, and is a nice spot to dine in.  You can see the chefs making the sushi rolls, and they don't rush you out of there.

Service is, in one word, ATROCIOUS.  I was so looking forward to them after having been closed down for so long.  I've frequented them a few times... Here's my take. We did a dine-in. Completely awkward. Some manager/son of the boss type guy was frequently scoping out the place.  Clearly not a server, Mr Intimidation scopes out the place in a black dress shirt, black fancy pants, n a belt.  A hawk dressed in black. We order food. Get it. After a LOOOONG wait. Even our appetizer took a long time. We get soy sauce and sweet n sour on the side.  Soy sauce is in a bottle, sitting alongside sweet and sour. They sit on top of a doiley.... on top of a plate.    I take the soy sauce off the plate to season my food. Set the CONDIMENT on the table.   Mr Intimidation comes by me, sticking his hairy army in front of my face---- i'm in mid bite, bringing a spoon of soup up to my face--  to take the soy sauce and replace it on the doiley'ed saucer.   NO excuse me. No polite smile. Just awkward. Hrm.. okay. I need to re-season mid way through my soup.  Place the bottle on the table. OF course he comes back to place it on the saucer. Weirdo. I take a break throughout my meal while my bf and I are in mid conversation.  U know. Just cuz the conversation is getting good.  A server interrupts and tries to take my food. ""No, I'm not done."" You know. Cuz my bowl is right under my face. Not to the side, pushed away from me. OR sitting at the edge of the table.   5 minutes later, a different server comes back around and tries to steal my plate away too.  =I   I'll say when I'm done with my food.  The crows tried coming in a few extra times too.  Took for ever to pay and get the hell out. Oh.  And it was raining pretty heavily when we went! What do these guys do? Blast the AC although our shirts are soaking. Grr.... we had no choice but to order soup and tea.

She seemed pretty upset to bring out another mini kettle for tea with a new tea bag in it. Mr Intimidation begins to walk around to refill water.  My cup is 20% empty.  No excuse me. No acknowledgment. Just a reach over ACROSS MY FACE to refill it. Mr Awkward. Eww. Strike 2: Cousin is in from out of town, so we order. Trying to get delivery from these guys.  We give them the address. They say okay.  I know I live a small ways off, but I'm highway accessible.  10 minutes with good traffic.  They take the order, say it'll be delivered in 45min-1hr.  We get a call back in 10 minutes.  THe person says ""Oh. You live too far. It's an EXTRA $5. ""   Uhm.... so you didn't bother to check that we were in area when we gave you our address?? *seething*.  We ask to pick it up instead. They say ""oh, it's ready.""  We drive out, arrive in 10-15 minutes.  Lady at the counter says ""We're just packaging it up.  And for NEXT time, it'll be $5 extra for delivery,"" smiling sweetly. Uhh... so yeah. Next time, Manee Thai guys, you should check the address before you say ""OK we'll do it."" There's a reason why you ask for the address, right?? So we wait. They said it was ready on the phone before we left the house.  We wait another 10 minutes. The servers bundle and huddle together to gossip.  I think that if they have time to stand around 2 feet in from of me to talk and waste time, they should have time to package our food.  My cousin and I butt in to ask, ""Isn't our food packaged yet?""  They give the look that says, ""I completely forgot!!"" The ""For-next-time"" Lady scurries away in a hurry.  Someone else comes back from the kitchen with our food.  Jesus Christ. Their  food is still pretty good (Thai-wise).  Seaweed salad: 20% salad. 80% cucumber.  Portions got a ton smaller--- for EVERY dish we ordered.  Pad see ewe and pad woonsen still yum.  Fried rice underwhelming but not ruined. Sushi and other things, try at your own risk. I dunno how much I'd trust them with this new venture. Their decor is pretty. But their service just puts such an awful taste in my mouth now.

I ordered lunch to be delivered today.  The Manee Thai that I remembered from past years is back.  The food came within 40 minutes, was hot and tasted just as I remembered.  For everyone who was left unimpressed on their few weeks open, I suggest you give them one more chance.  They seem to have gotten back in the groove!  Yay!",0.7157,0.801,0.111,0.088,0.4600033068783069

After a fire that resulted in a lengthy closure the new Manee Thai is finally open (May 2010). Residents of Irving Park will flock to any new restaurant that isn't a dump and Manee Thai is no exception. Thankfully I think they - and myself included - will keep coming back. The busy restaurant had slowish service but the food was excellent with plenty of fresh, bright vegetables  with distinct flavors. Portions are ""just right"" - you won't be hungry but you won't be taking home leftovers.

2010-05-24,1.0,"When the original Mannie Thai burned to the ground - I was saddened. My friends called with condolences. This was a place where I ate - held meetings - had dates - wrote plays. This was my place - I knew everyone and everyone knew me. I was saddened by the loss to say the least. I found another Manee Thai on Chicago Avenue and was completely let down. It was a too-hip restaurant with small portions and bad service. As I began to watch construction on the new Manee Thai my heart raced with excitement.  Every day as I drove by there was a new wall - or a new window. I was counting the days... They re-opened a couple of weeks ago and I was all set to go. Things being as they are it took a couple week -but I finally made it in. Remember in American Graffiti when Charles Martin Smith kind of follows Suzanne Somers in hopes of catching her and falling in love with her? Remember that he did and she turned out to be kind of drippy and he was disappointed? Color me Charles Martin Smith! The service was New York rude.  They had no interest in welcoming us or engaging us in questions about the new place. They had one thing on their minds - feed 'em and bleed 'em (okay that's two things.) The garden rolls were very fresh and delicious - but that was where the food quality ended. I got the chicken massaman. The potatoes were raw and the onions tasted like they were left over from the pre-fire days. My friend took one spoonful of soup and was done. No one even questioned the fact that we were returning an entire bowl of soup. In a serious restaurant someone would have wanted to know why. The guy dropped the check and said ""Take your time."" and then hovered like we were shoplifters. At one point he was so aggressive I thought he was going to ask my friend to dance. The good food is gone. Our friends who worked there are gone. The service is gone. And I am gone.  Life is too short for bad service and raw potatoes.",0.9875,0.773,0.148,0.079,0.5753029088966589

It seems that the communication between the kitchen and the wait staff is terrible.  We could see the cooks standing around while orders were already placed.  The food was simply OK. Then it came time for the check.  We were done eating for fifteen minutes and finally found a waitress and requested the check. Another 15 minutes, nothing.  We were rather vocally voicing how upset we were with the owner sitting at a table right by us reading a newspaper and he wouldn't even look up.  We finally got very upset and demanded the check.  Needless to say, we did not tip well.  We will not be going back there.

2010-05-12,3.0,"Well, they're back.  And while the food is as good as ever, I have to tell you that until they get their service straightened out, you might want to avoid the place.  On opening day we made an order and it took more than 2 hours and several phone calls to get it.  I cut them slack for that because it was opening day and from what I heard over the phone, they were slammed.  At least it arrived hot and they got it all right. A couple of days later we ordered again.  I was told they'd call me back in about ten minutes.  Twenty minutes later I called them and bitched a little and this time they only made me wait five minutes on hold.  Things were looking up, I figured.  While we were waiting we decided to go pick up the food because we figured it would be faster, so I put in the order, was told it'd be ready in 45 minutes and that was that. We arrived there 45 minutes later, and then we stood for at least half an hour waiting for the order.  During that time, I didn't see a single table being bussed, and no restaurant worker would talk to any customer unless the customer approached them.  That's lousy service.   I could see the area where the to-go orders were being packed and saw at least six people looking at the same order slip (ours, I could tell by what was going into the bag) and discussing it.  It took them twenty minutes to get three entrees and two appetizers into the damn bag, and then they forgot all the iced coffees which we didn't realize until we got home.  I should have checked but by that time all I wanted was to get out of the restaurant.  There is no real waiting area and as  indicated above, no one to greet customers and separate out the dine-in from the carry-out ones, so Taylor and I took it upon ourselves to tell people who came into the restaurant that we were waiting for a carry out and they needed to speak to the host (presumably that's who it was, he was answering the phone) if they wanted anything. Okay, being fair here, I'll say that it was the first week and clearly the staff was clueless about how things should be organized, but hell, isn't that the manager's job?  And they've had a second restaurant open in Noble Square for several years so I would hope that they have some idea of what works and what doesn't. Much as I love this place, I doubt I'm going to bother with them for a while.  If it's still such a problem in a month, then maybe they shouldn't have bothered reopening.",-0.9176,0.857,0.059,0.084,0.35479797979797983

The food is still great, though the portions are a bit smaller and the prices are a bit higher than they were before the fire.  The bubble tea is far, far better than it used to be- seems like they got some more efficient blenders.   It was very crowded when we were there, which I like to see in a neighborhood favorite.  However, it was a bit confusing considering there's a huge back room that I assume is used for parties.  Why isn't it open for overflow?  Moving the kitchen into the dining area is nice and adds some interest to the atmosphere, but it really has made the dining area a very small space to work with.   New decor in general is great, a huge step up from how it used to look.  Plating was also better. Back to the service, though.  My friends and I all ordered bubble tea at the same time.  Theirs came quickly, mine did not.  I could see it on the counter.  For like 15 minutes, it just sat there, melting.  I asked the waitress about mine and she said it was still being made.  Eventually, the melty one from the counter was delivered to me.  Our meals all came at very different times- so far apart that mine was cold by the time my other friends' dishes came.  Guess that's what I get for being polite and not eating it when it arrived.  The check also took forever to come, and there was some confusion on the waitress' part about my credit card- she took it, brought it back, and then took it again.  When I asked her if she charged me twice, she had no idea what I was talking about.  Oh well. So all-in-all, still a good place and I'm super glad they're back, but I really hope they iron out the service issues.  I'll be ordering take out for awhile.",0.9955,0.791,0.181,0.028,0.5492219492219492

We went today 5/6 a Thursday evening and received the worst service. To be honest I am still not sure who our server was. We had 4 different people help us. We were sat at a dirty table with no menus. Finally I went and got my own. Then when I was ready to order I found a server and ask them to come to our table. WTF???  I then asked her to clean our table.  We were only offered water they never asked us if we would like a beverage.I was fine with water but still sales 101 on how to increase the the check!  My 8 year old son went repeatedly up to the hostess to ask her for things we need such as napkin, silverware, chop sticks and a small dish for soy sauce. She was completely annoyed with him and did not even try to hide it. She was completely annoyed with him and did not even try to hide it. I asked them if they could make chop sticks for my child they looked at me like I was crazy! Finally I asked them if they had a rubber band anywhere. The came back 10 mins later with one and I showed them how to do it. OMG! Okay so they are not child friendly. That is bad in this neighborhood!  I had sushi, my son and friend had Thai appetizers and entrees. The sushi was fresh and very good. The Thai was good. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would say a 7 for the Thai Food. The Sushi I would give an 8. Decent. But the service just sucked. I mean really sucked. The entrees came out at all different times one by one. The Pad Thai noodle was under cooked. But everything else was good. We had the thai egg rolls, the spring rolls, edamame, pad thai, the noodle shrimp dish in the clay pot. That was really good. I had an maki rolls and sushi. We will try them again. Maybe it was an off night. Not sure when they re-opend but do not go here unless you can spend 2 hrs for dinner or perhaps do carry out. They were also packed. Not an empty table. Also the tables are really close together so it has a crowded feel to it.  I think part of their problem would food delivery is they do not use a POS (point of sale system). They write the guest checks and put the tickets up the old fashion was. This means you have to have an excellent expediter in the kitchen to call out the orders and give them direction for making the food. Timing is everything and that is where a POS would help. We also waited for every to pay our check there is nothing like waiting to pay so you can leave. It seems that was the theme of the evening as we looked around many people had the same experience. We ended up shorting the tip because we did not want to have to wait for change. Our bill for 3 people for appetizers and entrees $46 plus $6 tip (a little high for the crappy service). They did remove the Pad Thai from our bill with out our asking for this. That was nice of them. Our bill would of been $7.95 higher if they did not do that.  Editing to add:  I found out today (5/7) they just reopened on 5/4. So unless you have patience I would either bring a bottle of wine (it is BYOB) so you can numb the horrible service or do carry out. OR go on a slow night.

I had been craving Thai all day.  I was too lazy and cold to get in my car, so I opted to order in.  They do not usually deliver to my area, but they were sweet to oblige.  I was forewarned that it would take at minimum an hour for delivery.

I really dug this place, moreso than lots of other more trendy Thai joints.  Pad Thai was a huge winner, which gets my vote.  The peanut sauce was really yummy and the sprouts and extras added onto it really did a wonder on my mouth.  The satay appetizer was delish too. The service and BYOB were to be expected.  I'll definitely be coming back here!",0.915,0.833,0.167,0.0,0.4175000000000001
2007-02-01,4.0,"Corner diner turned pan-asian restaurant? Love the yellow booths. Love the mirrored walls. Hate the strong smell of stale cigarettes from those corner diner days. But anyways... The food was great. Chicken satay - yummy. Generous serving of peanut sauce! First visit to a thai place calls for pad thai. This stuff was delish! Shredded lettuce, carrots and purple cabbage on the side added a nice crunch. Saucy, sweet not too spicy or dry. Just what I like! Pleasant service, but nothing extraordinary. BYOB.  New to the 'hood, I can see this place becoming a staple for us. [EDIT: And it did, no doubt about it]",0.8892,0.735,0.194,0.071,0.6804924242424243
2007-01-26,4.0,"I've been there twice and both times, the service was excellent.  The entire staff was very friendly and courteous. The first time I went, I had a one the shrimp appetizers (not sure which ones) and the chicken satay.  Those were delicious!  In addition, they brought us 3 appetizers for free!  Those tasted even better!  As for main dishes, we ordered 2 noodle dishes and then a mongolian beef.  Of course, those were very good too!   The second time...  I had the spicy basil fried rice.  It could've used a bit more flavor and wasn't spicy at all.  I also had the garlic beef and that was excellent (my husband thought so too)!  Then our 3rd and final dish was this shrimp in a pot thing over glass noodles, spinach, etc.  Although the flavor was good, the noodles were overcooked and stuck together and the shimp looked undercooked.  The thai iced tea and thai iced coffee were both good, but oversweetened. I would come back here again to order the appetizers and the noodle dishes (the flat noodles not the glass noodles) to have a satisfying meal.",0.9729,0.842,0.15,0.008,0.622070707070707
2007-01-18,3.0,"Slightly above average pad thai.  HIGHLY above average service.  I will order from them again because they are convenient, not because the food blew me away.   A+ on service, presentation, atmosphere, cleanliness, people, etc.   B on the pad thai... interested to try something else.",0.4019,0.938,0.062,0.0,0.3
2006-09-28,4.0,"I moved to the neighborhood almost three months ago and was afraid to order from this place.  Thai, Chinese and Vietnamese all in one restaurant, Hmmm, too much variety to be good.  Well, my husband and I tried it last night and it was great.  We ordered the Crab Rangoon and it was very tasty (if a place has good Crab Rangoon the food has to be good).  We also ordered the Angel Wings which are stuffed boneless chicken wings and holy crap are they good!   For my entree I got the Pad See Eiw with tofu and beef and it was fantastic.  The taste was perfect.  My husband got the Spicy Basil Noodle and he enjoyed it a lot.  He said it was nice and spicy. With all of that food we got a free chicken fried rice.  I tasted it and it was also very good, I have it for lunch today as leftovers.   Highly recommend this place. It did take a long time for the food to be delivered so leave yourself extra time.",0.9865,0.787,0.192,0.022,0.6153030303030302
2006-06-10,3.0,"Yeah Marcel, I have to agree w/ you on the average food.  I used to like their fried fish salad, but it's not the same anymore and not as good.  Try the kow tom pla (fish and rice soup) if they'll make it for you, won't find it in any other restaurant.  The fresh fruit smoothies are very good and decorated so pretty.",0.7584,0.73,0.186,0.084,0.54

2005-12-20,2.0,"I stopped in here on my way to a meeting to bring food to everyone. I figured Thai dishes, especially stir-fried ones would take no time. I was wrong big time. Our food took over an hour and we were just carrying out. There were other people coming in saying they'd been waiting just as long. We were never given a proper reason for the delay or compensated for the waiting. The orders were just piled up under heat lamps, so certain appetizers sat and got soggy while the other items were piping hot. I am only giving them two stars because the food was good, despite the circumstance. Needless to say, I was late for my meeting.",-0.1176,0.856,0.066,0.078,0.6054945054945053
