They placed us in a room near the back (smart!) and had high chairs and kids menu ready for us (Colleen Morris had it set up for us before arrival and it was great because being a mom and having not to worry about this makes it so much easier!). The service was really good - I'm glad our servers were patient and friendly with us.. I know with a big group and with babies it can be crazy but they handled us like a pro. My son threw his spoon on the floor and  one of the servers showed up behind me and asked if I wanted to have the spoon washed.. love it! Most of the people on the table ordered steak - they all loved it. I had the short rib over rissoto - it was just okay for me which was why I gave it a 4 stars. The kids enjoyed their meals.

2017-05-31,1.0,"I feel my visit here was a disaster.  We had a 9pm reservation and were seated promptly.  We were told they were out of rib-eye, prime rib and NY. Say what? I expressed incredulity over this. We settled on appetizer, salad, filet mignon and Delmonico.  The first courses came quickly.  After that is when the wheels came off.  The waiter came by and said our steaks would be up shortly.  Then he disappeared, and we waited and waited and waited.  At 10pm, their closing time, our steaks came out.  By that time there were 3 other parties left around us.  The waiter offered no comments about the wait whatsoever. Within minutes we were the only patrons left, and the waiters were busy setting the tables for the next day. As for the steaks, they got the doneness switched, my requested doneness was on the other steak and vice versa.  Given the long wait I didn't think it wise to send them back.  The filet looked nice, but the Delmonico was gray, barely seared and very tough.  So here we were, steaks cooked wrong, one looking pretty unappetizing, in an empty dining room in a closed restaurant.  Didn't feel relaxed about the pace of eating at this point.  We felt obligated to wolf the food and get out.  $150 with no drinks for this experience.  Don't know if this was some form of retaliation for making remarks about their being out of some pretty staple steaks or what.  If this were some low-end restaurant, then fine.  But with this level of pricing I felt we should have gotten a much better experience.",-0.1922,0.859,0.064,0.077,0.5034722222222222

Appetizer - scallops were very flavorful but a bit too small.  Main dish - the lobster was amazing, the risotto was incredible - I wish I could eat more.  Great texture and great flavor.  The steak was disappointing.  We got a steak that was very thin - less than an inch.  We asked our waitress and she claimed that some steaks are thinner and wider.  We weren't thrilled with the steak at all so that was disappointing. They didn't offer to replace the steak but got us desert instead.  Would be back and would give this restaurant another chance.

The locations looks like it was lifted from a old mobsters flick, right by the L and Merchants Mart. The interior is elegant and cozy with enough dark wood for ambiance and light enough to avoid the cliche. Cocktails were served up promptly and our waitress recommended us a great Tuna tartar app. The tuna was a nice contrast to our pending jump to the carnivore side of the menu. My wife went for the smallest steak cooked medium while I had a great strip steak in the rare-midrare range.  Both steaks were cooked perfectly, so nice to have a steak just the way you want it done. The side almost stole the show, risotto with mushrooms and some asparagus with béarnaise sauce. I appreciated having the sauce on the side, a little goes a long way.

2017-04-23,4.0,"Came here with a group of 6 on a Friday night, having made reservations ahead of time.  We were seated promptly, and had a great experience! Food: We were here during James Beard Eats week, and ordered off the prix fix menu.  The value of the prix fix menu was great, though I think the regular menu prices are worth it for the food we had. The first course, a cream of artichoke soup was amazing.  It was very rich, creamy and had a really savory side to it.  Never thought cream of artichoke would be so damn good. The second course was a crispy goat cheese napoleon.  The cherry tomato vinaigrette was perfect with the rich goat cheese. For the main course, I chose the pan fried lamb risotto.  OH EM GEE, was it amazing!  Soft, tender, and full of flavor, the lamb was just perfect.  I never thought to pair lamb with risotto, but it just went together so well.  My wife had filet, which was cooked well, but just not a very flavorful filet. For dessert, I had the banana cream tart, and my wife the lemon custard pie.  Both were good, but I ended up liking the lemon custard pie more.  That may be because it felt lighter, and I was absolutely stuffed after my meal. Service: We joined our friends an hour late, and quickly caught up with our friends in time for the main course.  The servers were very attentive, and checked in just enough, without hovering.  We weren't rushed out the door despite how busy they were. Facilities: Dimly lit, and cozy.  Tables are bit packed together, but I didn't feel too crowded in.  This would be great for a date night or even with a group of friends or coworkers.",0.9949,0.811,0.182,0.007,0.5700641025641027

We ordered oysters and the crab cake to start, and then both got different cuts of meat for our entree. My steak was little undercooked for what I normally like and my boyfriends was cooked perfectly. We ordered the mashed potatoes and cream of spinach as our sides which were both decent.

2017-03-20,2.0,Started off rocky and stayed that way. Arrived with two other guests - immediately the water server came over and proceeded to overzealously pour water not just in the glasses but on an i-phone and one of the guests. He disappeared (I incorrectly assumed he when to get napkins) and only reappeared to deliver a bread basket which somehow he managed put down in a manner that caused a crumb explosion. When the waitress came and I expressed my concern about the pre-server she just moved on with the intro speech. The water had a chemical taste and when I asked for bottled water I appeared to have thrown her off and they had to go check. They found one small bottle and then a larger one. The food and sides were very good and the quad sauce sampler was a nice touch. Perhaps with a different server & waitress my experience would have been much better.

2017-02-11,3.0,"Certainly not the best steak ever but cooked to order at Medium Rare. Basic seasoning of salt and pepper. The Dry Aged Delmonico boneless usually commands a higher price but i don't feel that $44 was justified. The NY strip, 10oz prix fixe was at least as good (for a strip cut). Side dish garlic mash was excellent. Creamed parmesan spinach was not. It was basically soup! Overall, Ruth Chris is still a superior joint, for a few bucks more. However, i do appreciate the wait staff's knowledge here and attempt to impress patrons by bringing out sample cuts of meat trying to explain which is which. But if you come to a place like this planning to drop this kind of coin, i would hope one of two things for you. You or your date know enough about steaks to know what to order, or you would be wise enough to take a suggestion from the staff. Seriously, looking at a plastic mold of meat and hearing 10 adjectives to describe the location to where the cut comes isn't that helpful. Also, when every cut is considered 'juicy', i don't know how constructive it is. But it is showy and fun as an experience, so im not knocking the fact that they do it.

Kinzie Chophouse surprised my expectations as a local brick and mortar establishment. Quite cozy. Smart and clean interior design. What reeled me in most was their '17 Restaurant Week menu. Featuring a 10 oz. strip loin steak and bourbon maple syrup coated pork chop as their entrees we were in for a treat! Our server, Jim, was very friendly and insightful about the complimentary steak sauces, too. As the most popular steak sauce in the house, the soy beurre blanc does not disappoint. It's got one of the most unique taste profile I've ever tried!

My husband and father ordered the special which was a 10oz New York Strip with spinach, potatoes, and 2 shrimp for $52. I tried some of their steak and it was amazing!!!!! Juicy and cooked perfectly at medium rare. My dad is a bit of a steak snob and he agreed the steak was cooked perfectly! I ordered the chophouse salad with 6oz filet mignon sliced on top for $24. I wanted a 6oz filet but they said they didn't have and the 8 oz filet is $40. Steak was once again wonderful but the lettuce was underwhelming.. Salad Basically consisted of lettuce, shaved carrots, and a quarter of tomato. My mom ordered the salmon for $22!which was good and had no ""fish"" flavor. I didn't care much for the cream sauce the salmon came with but my mom liked it. Overall I had a great experience! The atmosphere is perfect for an initiate dinner for two or a place to take the parents where you can actually talk. Place is in the pricey side but you expect that at all Chicago steakhouses.",0.9809,0.812,0.153,0.035,0.5524834814308498

We all had cocktails (my martini was perfect, and I judge a steakhouse hard on how well they can do a dirty martini). We shared onion straws for a starter. Never felt rushed. My one friend got the meatloaf and it was a huge portion and absolutely delicious, and I'm picky about meatloaf. My other friend got roast chicken and loved it, and I got the 8-ounce filet because it's my b-day, dangit! It was expertly cooked and divine. And! Our waiter heard my friend saying happy birthday to me and without even talking with any of us brought us a slice of carrot cake and ice cream with a birthday candle. Above and beyond service!

2016-11-06,2.0,"TLDR: Food was mostly good but service was overall pretty bad.  My boyfriend and I went for my birthday dinner and were excited to try something new. As far as steakhouses go, the prices were really reasonable.  We had the 14 oz Delmonico, the 24 oz Porterhouse, the broccoli fondue, and garlic whipped potatoes. Delmonico was cooked perfectly,  but the Porterhouse came more well done than medium. Didn't send it back because we were starving. Flavors of the steaks weren't out of this world. For sauces we tried the whiskey peppercorn, the soy and Gorgonzola cream. Gorgonzola cream was by far our fave! Delicious on both of our cuts of meat. Garlic whipped potatoes were tasty too, and broccoli fondue as well. The cheese on the broccoli had a smoked flavor to it. A birthday dessert was brought out, I believe it was their chocolate hazelnut dessert, and it was totally flavorless. We had no idea what we were eating until we looked at their menu online when we got home.  Service was just soo lacking though. We had a server come over to take our drink order. Got our drinks, and waited for a really long time for another server to do the meat presentation. After the meat presentation, it was probably 20 minutes until we put our dinner order in. We just never felt like we saw our servers at all. Once our food came out we wanted to order more drinks, but no one came over to check on us. It was a full Saturday night, but we had to honestly flag someone down to pay attention to us. Which is so rude to do, but when no one has been to your table in 30-40 minutes it's kind of necessary if you need something. The most server interaction we got was someone clearing our empty drink glasses without asking if we wanted another drink, which we did. Once we finished our meals, we sat with our plates for a solid thirty minutes. It took them 15 minutes to pack up and bring our leftovers. It took the two of us from 7:30 - 10 pm to get out of there. No appetizers or anything either, and we weren't really trying to take our time. Well we couldn't, because we couldn't get any drinks to do so.  Another thing to note, there was a group of 10 guys at the table next to us having a ball. And by that I mean they were drunk and so, so loud. Which really didn't bother us that much, we've all been the loud group at a restaurant once. It's not a restaurants fault for a rowdy crowd but I think they can be judged by how they handle it. these guys were yelling over each other and throwing food. We almost got hit by their flying calamari. The staff never said anything to them, even though the tables in our area definitely complained. In fact, a family a few tables away found out it was my birthday and sent us a dessert and limoncello (which never actually came out to us, I'm guessing because the service was so bad) on them because they felt bad that we were just trying to have a nice night out. After that, a hostess came over to apologize to us about the noise probably because the family around us said something to the Staff. Her apology was a bit strange tho. She said she hoped we didn't have ""a completely terrible time."" If they thought we were having a terrible time, why didn't they do or say anything during our actual meal? Just kind of a weird interaction.  So, food wasn't amazing enough for us to overlook all of that. We won't be back, just so many other great restaurants around to try.",0.1378,0.818,0.091,0.091,0.5717487373737374
2016-10-24,5.0,"It might be a corner restaurant in an unusual spot, but oh my goodness what an amazing place. My boyfriend lives in the suburbs and is a frequent visitor to the city so he absolutely knows how to choose restaurants. It was my first trip to Chicago and this was our first dinner out and I couldn't have been anymore impressed with Kenzie Chopshouse!   As stated Kenzie sits in a corner and could be passed up without realizing it. Very simple outdoor building, but one step through the doors and you are immediately in a cozy, classy, and inviting enviroment. The walls are a creamy white, the linens are creamy white with black accents to them beautifully set. Accompanied with low cozy lighting, it makes for a very romantic experience.   My boyfriend made reservations with Rafael because he has been there many a times before and Rafael is his, now our, go to guy! Rafael stopped and said hello and caught up with my boyfriend and indroduced himself to me. Recommended wines for us and even let us sample a few to make sure we would be happy with our choices. Seeing as it was my first experience he wanted to give me the official learning experience of their menu and meat cuts and selection.   We were brought a seasonal pumpkin soup with crutons and oh my goodness, it was so good. The texture was a little thicker than tomato soup and the taste was mouthwatering. It was sweet enough to be identified as pumpkin but savory enough to not be a dessert.   My boyfriend and I had decided to split a 10 oz strip steak I believe, cooked medium well with a side of broccoli fondue. And the steak was probably to most tender and flavorful steak I've ever had. Perfectly cooked and so juicy. The broccoli fondue was very good as well steamy broccoli covered in cheese, how could that ever be bad? We also split the southwest chicken salad. The salad was YUGE! could easily have had just the salad and been fully satisfied. Usually dressing are either put on too heavy or too thin but the semi spicy dressing they used was perfectly paired with the salad and added just the right amount of flavor.   We finished our meal with a dessert duo, beautifully presented to us on a plate covered in strawberry sauce whipped cream and fresh fruit, we had a pistachio gelato and a chocolate dessert that was so rich it literally gave me goose bumps. I'm not sure exactly what the desserts were due to them being complementary from Rafael since my boyfriend has been so frequent. But I'm sure if you inquired you could easily find out.   Over all Kenzie Chopshouse was hands down the most enjoyable date night dinner I've experienced. With the romantic ambiance and the wait staff being above and beyond fantastic and the food being incredible, I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.

So how do you separate them? Well, as you look through all the usual suspects in Chicago (and all are amazing, you won't be disappointed) consider Kinzie Chophouse. It's woman owned (and quite a few of the best restaurants in Chicago are btw), it's been around for 25 years, it's not a chain, it's intimate, and.....get this....IT'S QUIET ENOUGH TO HAVE A CONVERSATION. Yup. I'm in my 50s, the people I was with were in their 70s, and believe me, this is a major consideration nowadays. They have a few smaller rooms rather than the gargantuan rooms a lot of steak places have. They have handcut stone walls, romantic booths, and all the other things you'd expect from a top notch steak house. If you go, and if you like a filet, I'd recommend the Delmonico. It's got some marbling that a regular filet does not, and I loved it....and I LOVE filets. The wine list, of course, is great. The non beef items are plentiful.

2016-09-14,5.0,"Whoa! How have I never reviewed Kinzie Chophouse before?!?! It's a River North Steakhouse without the River North Steakhouse pricing. Almost every cut of meat is under $50, and we're talking pretty similar steak as such places like Gene and Georgetti, or the Chicago Chop House.  If you're not doing steak, I have to suggest their meatloaf sandwich. So moist it melts in your mouth and served with a beef gravy that will leave you licking the plate clean. At about $14 it's even more of a bargain than the steak and to get a meal like it across from the Merch Mart is definitely a find.  Classic in ambiance and you always have service a smile.

Even though management removed the $45 steak from the bill, I was actually mostly disappointed by the fact that I had a barely eaten steak on my plate, I had placed both my fork and knife on the plate to signal I was done, and yet no one asked if it was OK or not. Had to wait till the end when the waiter brought the bill to bring up the issue. Most of the people in my party had a good meal and I can say their creamed corn and the pistachio dessert was very good, but the staff needs to pay better attention. A partially eaten steak is a sign of an issue.

2016-04-10,4.0,"In the crowded and abundant Chicago chop house scene to choose from, this one is a sleeper pick in a good way.  This was recommended to me by a hotel concierge as a solid chop house with reasonable prices and great quality.  We Uber'd here but I suppose a walk from the Mag mile from the south side would probably be about 15 minutes.  It's a smallish restaurant with a calm quiet non-pretentious ambiance.  No frills, straight to the point but not lacking of personable and impeccable service. The food was not lacking either. Standard starters and all the cuts of meat you'd imagine. I'm not a steak aficionado (getting into grading) so it wouldn't be fair to me to opine on that aspect of quality.  We had the Delmonico in both forms - the dry aged cut as well as the bone-in.  It was easy to taste the difference in the two.  While the bone-in satisfied that primal instinct of eating off of a bone, and provided all the succulent juiciness of the cut, the aged version was all the better.  Dry-aged did bring out that extra level of grass fed beef flavor.  Fuller and richer in flavor it was indeed.  I liked the feel of this place.  Not casual, but can be. Not overly formal, but can be as well. I came in slacks with a buttoned down shirt which was not out of place. Other men were in blazers and or suits.  I look forward to my next visit to Chicago for another visit to this restaurant.",0.976,0.81,0.142,0.048,0.5346618357487923

For entrees we were given a limited menu to choose from: Salmon, chicken pot pie, pork tenderloin, and an arugula pasta. From what I could see, the salmon looked decent but the arugula pasta looked really flat and disappointing.  I ended up going for the chicken pot pie.  It was interesting because the pot pie was deconstructed.  It came in a bowl, the pot pie filling was actually soup like and there was a piece of flaky crust on top.  Overall, I thought the portion was large and it had a lot of flavor when I first dug in but after awhile the acidity in the soup like mixture started to overpower my pallet.  I must say, the best part of the meal was their chocolate cake, which was rich and gooey on the inside.  The lunch ended around 1:30 and I ended up going back home instead of the office because I did not feel well after the meal.  Not sure if I would come back to Kinzie. I was expecting it to be a little bit more fancy for the prices I saw online and since it's in River North competing with places like Bavette's next door, but then again it's hard to judge when we came in for lunch.",0.9757,0.849,0.112,0.039,0.4472222222222223

The wife and I had dinner on 12/22 and were not disappointed.  In the ""solid"" steakhouse world, you have Capital Grill, Morton's, Ruth Chris, etc. These places are solid, because everything is consistent, the menu plays it safe and the service is good. There's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with reliable. That's what Kinzie Chop House is; reliable. Good service? Check. Traditional sides? Yep? All the favorite cuts of steak? You bet! The drinks (2 old fashioned) were meh. Fairly priced, but since when does an old fashioned call for club soda? Drinks aside, everything was good and a touch below great. For example, the blue cheese au gratin was a nice twist on an au gratin, but it we a bit cold. Not so cold you'd send it back, but enough to throw off the taste and texture. The brussel sprouts were full of flavor, but a bit soggy. Again, not enough to complain, but if you've had the sprouts at Prime and Vision, it's a big difference. The steak was very good. We split the 48 oz porterhouse. Cooked perfectly. Exactly how we wanted it. But, again, not exceptional, except for the 4 sauces they gave you for the steak. That was surprising and tasty.  If Yelp!

2015-11-19,2.0,"A year ago, I would have given them 5 stars. This is a place that my wife and I loved. This is where we were when we decided to move back to Chicago years ago. We have celebrated every anniversary, every birthday (including ones that end in zero), every milestone with friends and family here and we genuinely loved it. We brought just about everyone we know here at some point. We considered it ""our place."" Sadly, we will likely not be going back. The staff generally is excellent - they know their craft, make a mean martini and are polite and professional even when dealing with an idiot like me. Lately, though, their standards seem to be slipping. This past visit was our 4th since we noticed something was becoming amiss. We've tried to get steaks on a few occasions, first coming out charred to shoe leather, then remade barely cooked - it was seriously blue in the middle. I even tried to get the salmon, but it was so heavily coated with seasoning that apparently no heat could get through to the fish. It was so raw, I think it may have moved on its own - so at least it was fresh. Three attempts, three fails in a row. They didn't charge us for our meals and even offered to take the drinks off, but I insisted I pay for what we drank. It's sad sitting in a really nice restaurant, thumbing through the OpenTable app trying to find a place nearby for dinner, but we kept going back out of loyalty and in hope of change.  Our last visit was the worst. We knew not to get the steaks (we actually had a reservation for another steakhouse later), but their bar snacks were usually good. Not this time. A quesadilla that at one time had seen some cheese, but barely any made it in, and the calamari. Three tries: Burned beyond recognition; then incredibly underdone and; finally passable - but no where near as good as it used to be. The breading was so poorly executed, it kept falling off the calamari. This is four times where the food gets thrown out, after multiple tries. Their spoilage costs must be through the roof. It seems that their chef either doesn't care, or is incompetent. The straw that broke the camel's back was when a person came in off the street asking customers for money. I get it, it's a big city and this sort of thing can happen. However, when you're in an upscale place, in the back bar area and a person who is quite obviously out of their mind (asking if we've seen Napoleon) comes in, harasses people, leaves, and then returns not leaving you alone while some of the staff watch, but do nothing? That's a problem. It's a steakhouse, not the CTA. If I hear that they have a new chef, I'll give it another try.

Haven't been here for a few years and was a bit concerned that the joint had just a handful of occupied tables when I showed up at 12:15 on a Tuesday. The wait staff was attentive and going through the motions but didn't seem to really want to be there. Our food was a notch above TGIF quality at best. VERY uninspired and a bit sad given the history of this place. Almost seems like the owners have given up a bit, but can't quite pull the trigger to call it a wrap. This may sound a bit harsh, but the kiss of death for a restaurant, especially in Chicago where there is sooo much competition, is when diners leave with no particular desire to go back.

Calamari tasted fresh, but the coating wasn't great and tasted as though it was cooked in very-old oil.  Got the dry-aged KC steak and the delmonico. The KC was nearly tasteless, devoid of char. The delmonico was quite good - charred appropriately and with loads of flavor.  The sides were boring and bland. The baked potato was over-cooked and rubbery. The asparagus wasn't grilled and was ordinary.  Wouldn't recommend. Though, the steak was a ton better the next day in a salad.",0.149,0.802,0.106,0.092,0.5652777777777778
2015-07-07,5.0,"I recently took a trip to Chicago to meet up with some college friends that I haven't seen for a while.  They urged me to try a steak and Kinzie and I obliged.  Now I'm not normally a fancy sit-down restaurant kind of guy, I prefer tacos and street food, but I absolutely loved Kinzie.  My friends who showed me around took me during lunch time as to avoid the dinner rush and what we got was great food and great service.  As part of a younger generation of restaurant goers, we were obviously under-dressed for a place like Kinzie, flip flops, t shirts and cargo shorts, but the restaurant staff couldn't have been more welcoming.  We were promptly seated and brought water to start.  After looking at the menu we all went with the 14 oz. Delmonico, the cheapest steak on the menu.  We also had an order of the mac and cheese and some sort of sauteed mushroom.   The first bite of the steak was heavenly.  I had gotten the steak with some horseradish on top, but I made sure my first bite was pure steak.  I've always been a firm believer that a store bought, home grilled steak can go toe to toe with a steak from a fancy steakhouse, but the Delmonico was better than anything I could have made myself or any steak I've had so far in my life.  We were also given four different house made steak sauces to try and my favorite was their cheese sauce, not sure exactly what was in it.

Service was a bit rushed and, at times, inattentive, but overall met expectations. Cocktails were well executed though not overly creative. Ambiance was warm and inviting and the seating was very comfortable.  The food was only a notch above mediocre,  and that is only due to the richness and tastiness of the side items (in our case, the bleu cheese potatoes, Mac n cheese, and creamed spinach with mushrooms). My flat iron steak was difficult to slice with my steak knife, and lacked any semblance of char. The accompanying sauces lacked any nuance and depth of flavor and sat mostly untouched.  Dessert was carrot cake served without the, in my opinion, requisite buttercream frosting and was forgetful, but the coffee was quite good. Overall grade is a D.

Split a Caesar and nicoese salad, I loved the nicoese, good feedback on the Caesar as well as the rock shrimp cake. I told myself before we sat down I would try something new, so I got the apple wood smoked pork chop. It was really tasty, juicy, and cooked right. I particularly enjoyed the BBQ sauce that came with it and the small portion of side risotto was delicious too. Two filets, one Oscar style, both came out perfect, the virgin Kinzie friend said his was definitely one of the best he's had.  After a bottle of pinot, rose, a couple glasses of moscato, a sample of grappa, and a glass of scotch, our group was collectively liquored up. We got a carrot cake, as well as an ice cream before we left, and of course those were just lovely. Rafael is basically my designated server, such an awesome dude who really knows his stuff.

I expected a lot more flavor from it especially since this place is not cheap by any standards. An old neighborhood restaurant that has been around for a while and I'm sure other items on the menu are very good...however, two stars is all I can give since the steaks are supposed to be their ""fastball"". It does say Kinzie ""Chophouse"" on the door so I'm not being unreasonable here. Will likely not try this place again! UPDATED 5/18/2015 After giving it two stars on my prior visit, I'am now updating my review to reflect five stars. The reason is quite simple..the owner (Susan) reached out to me immediately and wanted another chance to reshape my experience. She hosted me and my father for another lunch and we ordered the exact same thing we did last time i.e. Calamari and two Delmonico steaks. This time, everything was on point and perfect. The restaurant admitted that they had had some staff changes in the kitchen and we're working on going back to being consistent with their recipes and cooking standards! Overall, a key trait for any great restaurant is not only the quality of their food and their service but also their ability to adapt, evolve and most importantly, own up when they don't meet standards.

2015-03-10,3.0,"After all the good things I read about Kinzie Chop House in Chicago, I have to say that I was utterly disappointed. My daughter and I went there for dinner on a Monday evening (March 9, 2015). There was no one there -- which didn't surprise me, given it was a Monday. We ordered the herb crusted goat cheese to start and I'll tell you right now that this was the very best thing about our entire meal. The marinara sauce is to die for.  We split a 24oz. Porterhouse steak, which the waiter offered to have sliced for us. I thought that was completely odd. Why would you thinly slice a bone-in porterhouse like that? I would have preferred to cut it off the bone and cut it into two pieces -- which is what I should have done. But we went with the waiter's suggestion. Anyway, we ordered it with be bernaise sauce. The sauce came in an itty bitty metal pot that wasn't enough for even one person. Since when is bernaise served like that? A great steak house either puts in on top of the steak so it can melt nicely, or it comes in a tiny jug. Sooooooo disappointed. And it was just so-so! Last, dessert was the creme caramel. The thing I love about creme caramel is cracking the top of it. I love that sugar, the way the cracks travel. I could have dropped a feather on this top and it would have cracked. Well, a bit of an exaggeration, but you get the idea. Really disappointed again. But the custard was nice.  I would say there must be several way better steak houses out there in Chicago. The nice thing about this one is that by splitting an enormous piece of meat, you can keep the cost down. But when it comes to a good steak house, you shouldn't be worried about prices. Go somewhere else.  One more thing. The meal came far too fast. The goat cheese was brought out immediately and there was literally no delay between the cheese and the steak. And the waiter? Just eh! In a good steak house, you need a good waiter. He wasn't bad, he just wasn't good.",0.9854,0.795,0.143,0.062,0.6022101972101974

We opted for dessert because at $5.95 each there was no reason not to try a few. We ordered some for the table and I'm glad I didn't get one for me. The pistachio semifreddo was a huge disappointment, the crème brulee was ok, probably the best one was the apple tart.

Food - I had the Ribeye fiilet and sauteed mushrooms. The ribeye was done perfectly and served with an array of four different sauces to choose from (the Cabernet Demi Glace was unreal). The mushrooms complimented nicely. It was a perfect amount of food.  Drinks - They have a pretty comprehensive wine list, along with a decent beer list.

2014-11-14,2.0,"""Meh"" just about sums it up... I went solo on a Thursday night while in town on business and sat at the bar. I had a glass of wine, a beer, and an 8oz. filet with caramelized onions.  I'm not of the mindset that food is everything. Working in restaurants, the entire experience is the sum of it's parts and a great meal can be made or broken by the ambiance, service, etc. That being said, I'll break it down... Food: The steak was good, not great. I expected far better for the prices they charge here. The steak was cooked perfectly (medium) but was served warm, not hot. The caramelized onions were bland and drenched in oil. I've actually had comparable food at Outback.  Drink: Nice selection of wine, beer and spirits and the prices were reasonable. I had a healthy pour of Malbec and a tall, cold IPA that hit the spot.  So here's where it get's weird and I start adding the aforementioned sum of all parts. They offer Louis XIII at $250 an ounce...fairly standard (if not fair price for 40 year old cognac). But this $3,000 crystal bottle of cognac sits in a prominently displayed case on a cheap glass shelf and right below it, a bottle of Kettle with a pre-measured pour spout (the kind with a ball that stops the flow of alcohol when you reach the 1.25oz. pour - like you find on bottles at airport bars).  Ambiance: I quickly get the sense from the Louis and Kettle and cheap cosmetic finishes that this place takes advantage of it's touristy location to bill itself as a high-end steakhouse but still has some level of self awareness to offer a $13 plate of meatloaf, and somehow this offended me. What's with the identity crisis? They offered to take my coat and hang it in their closet, they offer $250 shots of liquor and $6 beers, $80 steaks and $13 entrees, the glass backsplash that bathes the bar carries over with chipped corners to menu boxes and service stations. The bar provided about six inches of overhang above my legs forcing me to bend down for each bite of my meal. (The lady next to me ate two bites of her steak and asked for a check saying, ""I can't eat like this."") And there was one black guy in the entire restaurant...a bar back in a crisp white shirt and tie bringing bread and water to a sea of white people.  Service: Like the into...""meh"" just about sums it up. The server (one of two women behind the bar) was casual and kind but added no value to the overall experience. We made small talk, I admired her accent (as did a few gentlemen down bar from me), but I couldn't tell you her name or pick her out of a lineup to save my life. This is actually ideal for me; I prefer service when needed but I don't want to be your friend during dinner.  I finished my meal, paid my bill and left wondering what the hell just happened. Was I in a nice steakhouse on a bad night? Was I in a casual chophouse on a good night? I just can't tell.",0.9922,0.812,0.133,0.055,0.5389355742296918

Definitely a completely different experience from the last time we were here! I ended up going with the Dry Aged Delmonico medium. It could honestly be the best steak I've had in Chicago and definitely rivals the dry age steaks they have at David Burke. Well done, Kinzie! For starters, definitely try the Rock Shrimp Risotto Cake. You'll be cleaning up the lobster cream sauce it comes with any bread you have left over. Oh man, I'm drooling remembering how good that was! The sides we went with the creamed corn and sausage, spinach and mushrooms, and the mushroom risotto.

The appetizers were incredible, even their fried Calamari was extra crispy, seasoned and well and not the least bit greasy. The blackened shrimp was faboulous and the baked goat cheese was amazing!! they had plenty of choices of sides and sauces to accompany the steak and had a wonderful presentation to review their steaks.

From stepping into the warm entrance (seriously quite thankful for the heat given Chicago decided to be bipolar and freezing in October) to the amazing dessert, I can't say enough good things. The service I had today was a 180 degree turn from that I last experienced. Something to note: there is no corkage fee for the first bottle (if your bottle isn't offered on their wine list), but the second bottle is $20. As for the meal, we were greeted by a wonderful server named Jim, who lucky for me was from Seattle and lived in SF for a bit so could empathize with my Californian distaste of the cold...but I'm getting off track! He noticed we had brought a bottle of white vino and immediately whipped out white wine glasses and an ice bucket. +1. We started with the shrimp cake appetizer (I'm not sure this is the exact name but close enough), and the lobster sauce was so good I found myself dipping the starter bread into it!  We opted for the following: a dry aged delmonico, a porterhouse, and a medium rare prime rib. Man, the dry aged was phenomenal. If you're a fan of David Burke's, you should definitely give Kinzies dry aged a try! The porterhouse was awesome (although at 24 oz, I definitely had some to take home), and the prime rib was surprisingly good!! I'd choose this prime rib over Lawrys any day! For the sides, we got creamed corn and sausage, spinach and mushrooms, and the mushroom risotto. All were spectacular. My favorite part though? You can add mushrooms to your steak for $2!

2014-08-25,4.0,"This is a tough review, for a few very good reasons: they earned a 5 hands down, but I really reserve the highest honors are for places that I have left my socks behind, and this just tipped the scales with some areas they could improve, but not much it was really a great place to go. Why not a 5? Any Chicago restaurant in the city on a Saturday night you will wait, and with a reservation you hope to wait as little as possible.  What made this a pause to top honors was our wait was described as 15 minutes when it took 30 - now to be fair 30 is not a long wait for a good place on a Saturday but when you set an expectation you do hope that will be the case. Was the place spacious?  No, again this is the very top market for real estate and most city places are in fact tight - but when servers bump your table multiple times, and move your chairs 10 more just to get around your table, and the bar area is especially tight, yes they could use more space. Really those are minor but they were part of our overall experience - and our food experience was really very good - one that I would say you should try.  Their menu was not typical steak house only, it was filled with many more choices and the steaks were displayed, discussed, and they even had a cut I had not seen anywhere else, a 10 oz fillet of the ribeye, which I added aged gouda and had me a great meal.  No less then 16 steak cut choices are listed.  The WILD MUSHROOM & GORGONZOLA CHEESE TART was as good as everyone describes, we also had a Risotto side dish that was amazing.   But the menu has fish, pasta and many more choices and some great looking salads as well.   Very well rounded for all tastes.  A well stocked wine menu made us look the other way when the dessert menu was shown but it was very nicely full of good choices at low prices.

Very good all around.  The sides are good portions, probably good to split between 2. The service was top notch.  From the prompt host and hostess to the bartender (we were getting a couple drinks since we got there early) to the waiters.  All very cordial and attentive.  They took care of us.

The food is always great. Their lunch menu is very reasonably priced. Their prices on their dinner menu are also good, but the better steaks can be very pricey.

They have a couple other cuts that you won't find anywhere else, and the servers do a good job of gauging whether you need them to explain it all to you (complete with wrapped samples that show you exactly what you're getting) or if you've been through the show-and-tell before. Everything was cooked perfectly and well-seasoned, super flavorful. They have a number of sauces and crusts you can add to it as well.

No cork fee on the first bottle of wine, which was a pleasant surprise. So many steak places in River North try to be flashy.

They offer tables a tour of meat cuts, which is nice and informative.  The food was pretty good, I'd say 3.5 to 4-star quality, when it came out correctly. I ordered a salad, which came out swimming in dressing and had to be re-made. Crab cakes were good. My filet was cooked medium as ordered, with good flavor to the meat. My fiancé ordered his steak peppercorn crusted. It came out looking plain and tasting unseasoned. The manager came over to see what was wrong and we explained the mixup. They took his steak back and then returned the very same plate to the table with a little ground pepper sitting on top. No searing, no ""crust,"" nothing. He said it tasted 'okay' but this is certainly not how you would anticipate them to fix this error, especially given the caliber of the establishment. We were still charged the $4 up charge for them to throw that dusting of pepper on there. As a side, we tried the mac & cheese, which was good but nothing special.  For dessert, I was able to score a slice of the pumpkin cheesecake special, which had actually ended a few days prior according to the website. It was decadent, creamy, and delicious.

2014-03-01,5.0,"I can't decide what was better at Kinzie Chop House -- the service or the food -- but I'll begin with the service. My boyfriend and I were celebrating his birthday and, unbeknownst to him, I had specified this when I made the reservation. When we arrived, we were seated in a large, comfortable booth facing toward the main dining room, which is easily one of the nicest tables in the place. We were then greeted by Jerry, who, as another reviewer mentioned, was phenomenal from beginning to end. I couldn't decide between the wide selection of Cabernet offered by the glass, so Jerry brought me three (generous) sample pours of the most popular ones. My boyfriend decided to go with beer because their beer list is, surprisingly, filled with the top craft beers in Chicago. He chose an IPA, then Jerry brought out samples of other IPAs he thought my boyfriend would also like--- again, a very nice touch that made it clear he wanted us to have the best experience possible. When we'd finally decided on our drinks, we faced the next challenge: choosing a cut of meat. Jerry explained all of the cuts and made a recommendation on how each cut should be cooked. It was quite an education! Perhaps the most thoughtful thing was when Jerry pulled me aside to ask which dessert my boyfriend would like at the end of the meal, then added a complimentary beer to match it! Jerry was, by far, one of the best servers I've ever had, even at the most upscale of restaurants. Onto the food: we began with the Blue Point oysters, which were very fresh and expertly shucked. My boyfriend chose the Kansas City dry-aged ribeye and I chose the ribeye filet. Both were cooked expertly and exactly as we expected. We also chose the macaroni and cheese as a side, which I highly recommend. It's a four cheese variety with mostaccioli noodles; truly like nothing else I'd ever tasted. The dessert, a rum cheesecake, was also very good and recommended. Suffice it to say we left full and very happy.

Highly recommend this place. Had a porterhouse which I couldn't stop eating. Asparagus with hollandaise was delicious. A few oysters, orgasmic. Good wine, great dessert, and a snifter of drambuie to close it up. Don't believe the other reviews as I would definitely visit this place again. My horrible time in freezing Chicago ended on a fantastic note. Owner, give Jerry some praise.  In addition, Jerry beyond praised the owner for her treatment of employees. Makes me feel good that I enjoyed a fantastic meal at an awesome place with fantastic employees who enjoy working for a great boss. A strong recommend.

2014-02-27,2.0,"This is a review for a lunch I had with 5 other out of town colleagues.  First the atmosphere. It is a small space and every seat they can fit is probably worth $100k a year at a minimum, but I felt like it was too cramped. It was hard to get back to our booth and even harder to exit without bumping into a waiter or someone eating. That shouldn't happen. The service was ok, but far from great. Bus boy's reached over guests to clear silverware, and stood over some of my colleagues to refill a water. For a steak place? They should know better then that. However, I can get past that, it doesn't really effect my thoughts on a place, but I know for some that would be a big issue. Anyways, I ordered the Pastrami Reuben sandwich. Sounded delicious and couldn't wait to try it. Well it came, but one side of the bread was completely soggy. I'm not sure if this is how they meant to cook it, but if it is I would tell them to switch this up immediately. Who wants to eat a sandwich that was most likely soaked in the grease of a flat top? It's a shame, because had the other side of my sandwich been dry bread, it would have been a pretty good sandwich. The others at our table got a variety of things from steak to pasta. While no one complained, there was zero ""wow"" factor here. And when you are in River North and no one is talking about how great their meal is, that means its time to cross it off your list. It's too expensive of a risk to gamble that next time you go all the problems will be solved.",0.9816,0.773,0.155,0.072,0.45800653594771235

For our second course, we split the wedge salad which was the perfect size for the two of us. For our main course, I got the kansas-city and she got the filet. Both were out of this world! Cooked to perfection with amazing taste. As side, we ordered the asparagus and smashed potatoes which were equally as tasty.

I ordered from the restaurant week menu, and the brussel sprout salad and smoked gouda and beer soup were both great. The prime rib penne pasta fell a little flat, since the prime rib was overcooked and the pasta itself was nothing special. I tried some of my parents' prime rib and delmonico though which were pretty excellent.  For dessert we had the tres leches flan and the pecan pie which were decent, but nothing particularly special.

Well, low and behold, as soon as we walk through the doors I can't help but notice that Kinzie updated the decor.  Great job, guys!

My homie wanted steak so I said hell, lets do it. Bavette had a 4 hour wait so we rolled up to Kinzie. I usually eat no less than 24 ounces and I could do that here without hurting my pockets too much.  We were sat immediately in the only table available which was a snug, intimate little number off in the corner. Luckily me and my dude are secure in our manhood so we bro dapped and copped a squat. The waitress came over immediately.  We were debating the dry aged steaks or the 48 ounce porter served at MP. When inquired, the waitress stated $79 which was $10 cheaper than the individual steaks which could have went towards another side. We opted for that along with corn and sausage and loaded mashed potatoes. She insisted on including their numerous sauces and although I'm a purist we sampled a few. This should have been a sign. The steak came out a perfect medium rare. But as many have stated prior, the meat with pretty much flavorless. And that's being nice. No salt, no crust whatsoever, no caramelization. It's no wonder they include sauces for free, because that steak was bland without it. Unacceptable for a piece of meat bordering on a bill. The sides were better. The corn and sausage skillet was killer. The potatoes were what you'd expect. We asked for the bill and low and behold they charged us $89 for the steak. I normally wouldn't mind but considering how mediocre it was I felt like a fool. The sides earned it 2 stars, but I seriously think anyone believes these are good never had a good steak before.

We were able to make last minute dinner reservations at Kinzie's for 6 which was great! When we arrived we were seated immediately in a tall corner booth. The decor inside is very nice! The service left a lot to be desired. It seemed that we were a distraction to the first server, who may have just been really busy. The (first) server we had asked for our drink orders we ordered one bottle of wine and we're going to order more drinks but the server just walked away quickly without saying anything. We were baffled, but then he returned in a couple minutes to tell us that bottle was no longer available. He could have said he was checking on the availability instead of just walking away. Another person brought our drinks and he was apparently our new server, though no formal transition was made. But the second server was friendlier at least.  As a side note, if you order the beer flight be aware that each glass (4 total) only holds about 1-2 oz of beer. Pretty sad for $9. We ordered the cowgirl Delmonico steak which was underwhelming. The piece was supposed to be more marbelled, but instead it was a bit dry and chewy. The risotto and smashed potato sides were also just ok.

In my instance, he disagreed that it was the wrong dish and there really was chicken in the salad, it was just under the leaves and I couldn't see it. When prompted a second time after a very thorough investigation, he agreed and took the salad back. A few minutes later, the same salad came out but this time with chicken on the top - he told me it was a new one, but it clearly wasn't. I did not push the issue further.  If you're looking for a generic crowd pleaser, you might want to consider Kinzie.",0.7499,0.797,0.133,0.07,0.41734515484515483
2013-10-09,5.0,"I actually REALLY loved everything about this hidden gem. Hubby and I always make it a point to go to a different steakhouse every time we come to Chicago. We've been to some of the major ones, like Harry Caray's and Gibson's, but I think I loved Kinzie's the best for the all-around experience. A woman from the restaurant called me the day of our reservation to confirm and inquire if we were celebrating a special occasion, to which I mentioned we were celebrating our anniversary. Fast forward to the evening, we stroll in and they seat as at an awesome booth that was kind of tucked away but had a nice view of the dining room. Started with a caesar, which was the perfect portion size. Super fresh lettuce also, and I liked that it wasn't drowning in dressing. Hubby ordered some shrimp cocktail, his fave, and he liked that you got to order it by each shrimp. Only complaint we had the whole meal was his shrimp cocktail, as it was overcooked and slightly tough. I could tell it was tough just watching him eat it. I had the bowtie pasta with proscuitto, chicken, mushrooms, and fresh chopped tomatoes on top in a basil pesto cream sauce. SO GOOD. It was one of those meals that I regretted not having a microwave because I totally would have taken the leftovers and heated it up later for a late-night snack. The cream sauce wasn't overpowering or oily and greasy, but had a light taste to it. Everything was cooked to perfection. Hubby had their special for the night, which was a filet, crab-stuffed shrimp, brussel sprouts, mashed potatoes, and a lobster cream sauce. Steak was cooked perfectly, the sprouts were good, and the mashed had so much flavor. I liked dipping the potatoes in the lobster cream sauce, MMMMMM. He was worried it was going to be too much food portion-size, but it was all perfect.  We ordered their chocolate hazelnut terrine for dessert. When it arrived, it had a candle and ""happy anniversary"" spelled out in raspberry syrup. SO sweet and thoughtful, and they comped the dessert. That's called classy service.  Our waiter was nothing but kind and attentive, and on top of loving the food, I loved the ambiance of the restaurant. It was dimly light, classy, and had a nice romantic atmosphere but wasn't over the top schmoozy, if you know what I mean. There were families dining there, as well as business men, so I could tell the place appeals to everyone. Prices are also pretty decent for a steak place, in my opinion.

We also enjoy coming here when the parents are in town and looking for a nice place for our family to go to dinner.  The food is great and the service here is consistently very good. I've never had an empty glass and the staff knows how to check in with customers frequently to make sure you have what you need but not too frequently where your conversation is always being interrupted. Steaks, pasta and seafood - never had a bad meal.  I've had 2 really great customer services experiences and definitely commend the restaurant for always trying to make it right.  The first - I stopped in on a weekend for happy hour and was told by a misinformed staff person that the weekend happy hour special no longer existed. Disappointed, we went across the street to Central, which was great but not what I was hankering for that day. I stopped in another time (during the weekday) and asked about this with the bartender. She immediately informed her colleagues, apologized and offered us a free round of drinks for our trouble. Unnecessary but very appreciated.  The second - I had an issue with my bill, which was completely my fault. I called the restaurant and the manager said she would look into it. She called me the next day and fixed the mistake I made. She could have just said, gee that's too bad idiot, but she didn't. She was cheerful, helpful, returned my phone call and fixed the problem.  Thanks Kinzie Chophouse for consistently good food and service. My only complaint is that several of the portions for my favorite specials have gotten much smaller recently. Most egregious example -- the mussels. They are like half the size they use to be. Can we bring back the old portion sizes?

My third visit there this past weekend is what prevented a 5 star review.  My parents flew in from the east coast to celebrate a birthday, namely mine. I had hyped this place up and made reservations for Friday.  The restaurant called and confirmed the reservation and asked we if were celebrating a special occasion.  I laughed and said my parents flew in to celebrate my birthday.  The woman said she would put that in the notes. We arrived for dinner at 7:30.  The place wasn't too busy for a Friday night, which we thought would be good.    We each ordered a steak, and when the food arrived, one of our party who ordered the steak medium well (I know, terrible) received a medium rare steak.  We informed our server, and the manager came over and indicated another steak would be cooked promptly.  We chalked it up to mishearing medium well as medium rare.  The second steak was brought out while the rest of us were eating our entrees and, much to our surprise, it again came out medium rare.  We informed the manager and server again, and they took the second steak, cooked it again and it finally came out at the right temperature, but the rest of us had already finished our meals. After this debacle, we were looking forward to dessert.  Unfortunately, we did not receive a birthday dessert despite indicating it when confirming the reservation.  Our server, whose name I cannot remember, also did not ask if we were celebrating a special occasion.  It was a little disappointing to see another table celebrate a birthday with a dessert, candle, etc.  A minor gripe, I know, and sounds terrible coming from the birthday boy, but those who were there to take me out were more disappointed then I was and requested it be mentioned. Finally, the check came and we paid it as business as usual, and no more mention was made of our experience that night by the staff.   I hope this doesn't sound too harsh because I've had two impeccable dining experiences here, and everyone has an off night, but it was disappointing that I chose Kinzie Chophouse to for my parents' first Chicago Steakhouse experience, and it was the off night.  We plan to go back in the future because we do love the place, and I'll update this accordingly.  My guess is that Friday night was an anomaly.",0.9832,0.842,0.115,0.043,0.5262755102040815

It was a flaky phyllo dough that presented well, but wasn't easily cut to include in a bite with the meat & veggies. It was my bad in ordering it because the menu referenced the pastry crust top.  Next was the Meatloaf & Mashed Potatoes: This was a big disappointment.. The highlight were the potatoes and although very flavorful, they were dry. The gravy could have helped it, but there were only a few table spoons of gravy. As for the meat loaf; it was my first  time there so, I'm not sure if the recipe has unusually more ""extra ingredients"" or if it was under/unevenly cooked, but some of the bites were mushy. I don't expect the texture of a fillet, but don't think it should ""go squish"" under my fork. I was reminded of the mediocre flavor for hours, as I (embarrassed to submit) burped it throughout the rest of the day. The Key Lime Pie was tasty. Unfortunately, the pie crust - although thin and flaky - was bland and the pie was served without whipped cream.

He was right on target with his timing and was not intrusive at all - kept us going on the meal without forcing us out. Definitely went above and beyond by comping us a dessert for the birthday we were celebrating - really worth it. The food was exactly what I was expecting and definitely satisfied. I'd suggest the chicken skewer appetizer, it was well cooked and the accompanying side sauce was delicious. Skip the goat cheese app, it sounds good, but was pretty disappointing both in terms of size and flavor. We chose the mac & cheese, au gratin potatoes and the spinach and mushrooms as our side. To be honest, I always look forward to the sides at a steakhouse, they seem to be able to make the best starches!  Kinzie did not disappoint, I'd get both the m&c and the potatoes again - creamy, went well with the steaks, and were the perfect portion to share. We had quite the selection of steaks, prime rib, filet and kansas city strip (ribeye). The filet was melt in your mouth good, and perfectly done. The ribeye was a little firmer as expected, but had really good flavor. The prime rib looked exactly like you'd want it to, thick cut, nice and medium rare, and very little gristle. The steaks were quite good by themselves, but also came with a selection of accompaniments including melted cheese and many sauces. We tried a few of the sauces and they were excellent. I'd definitely try a few more. All Chicago steakhouses are priced pretty similarly (with a few outliers), Kinzie was probably on the lower end of the steak price, but that didn't stop it from having some of the best food I've enjoyed in a Chicago steakhouse.

Long story short, we had dinner reservations there but opted out. I think that Kinzie's downfall is their modest look. My eyeballs convinced me that this place was not what I was looking for. Luckily fate stepped in and delivered a traditional Chicagoan face punch of freezing cold air. This convinced me that indoors was where I needed to be right that second and Kinzie Chop House just happened to be where I was standing.  The hostess seated us right away. In fact, the restaurant was pretty empty but I wasn't scurred because I obviously checked for reviews the second I stepped inside. We were seated at a table close to the bar and the bartender was to be our waiter. I already have a bad feeling about the service but that's just because I'm a pessimistic jerk. Actually, the service turned out to be phenomenal.  I asked for a Manchester Mule and the bartender offered a Moscow Mule instead, which may now be my favorite new cocktail. Cheers to the bartender! I ordered the ravioli which were insanely delicious. Fresh tomato, mushroom, asparagus, and goat cheese to top it off?! Seriously, I may have concocted this very recipe in a previous dream. For the sake of good ole' Midwestern kindness (when in Rome...), I won't pursue legal action for plagiarizing my gastronomical fantasy.  Sadly, no dessert on this outing, as I engaged in my usual tradition of face stuffing with bread and butter prior to my meal. My only complaint of this restaurant is that the bread basket included RAISIN BREAD! (record scratch). Who on earth could possibly find that consumable, let alone good?!

Drinks reasonably priced and nice pours.  We ate here for a special occasion with a party of four.  Almost everyone loved their food...I liked my entree, but not as much as they did. The dinner started with an ample bread bowl, which was refilled promptly, as were the water glasses.  Side dishes and salads were wonderful. The steaks were perfectly prepared, and the chicken moist and flavorful. Personally, I was not bowled over(actually disappointed) by their short ribs, which were on their special menu...by the way, I had to ask for that menu, as it was not offered with the regular menu.  It seemed as though their short ribs were cooked, braised or baked without much, if any flavoring, leaving flavoring for later by the sauce on the plate. That works fine for steak, but not for a lessor cut of meat. They did not seem to be cooked long enough, either, which resulted in a chewy, not particularly moist or tender rib. If short ribs are on your 'special' menu, they should be something noteworthy...melt in your mouth goodness, flavored at the start of the cooking process to meld the flavorings with the meat.  Except for the short ribs, everything else was perfect. This is a white tablecloth-ed, upscale place with steakhouse prices that are not astronomical. This is worth a trip...just stick to the steak, chops or chicken, and pass on the short-ribs. You will enjoy everything else.",0.9929,0.827,0.173,0.0,0.5157669413919415

However, we are sometimes early eaters, so we went early and we were happy with the fact that it was quiet and relaxing. My mom and I tried the winter delights menu (though I added on some soup) and my dad and sister went straight for the steak!  Honestly, my sister picked this spot due to all of the reviews of the amazing sauce accompaniments, and she was not disappointed...she ordered 4 and I'm pretty sure she would have licked her plate clean had we not been out in public. I had the French onion soup, berry and spinach salad, chicken with proscuitto and goat cheese and then the berries for dessert.  Everything was wonderful, though I could have done with a little cookie or something with the berries (that's just me loving my dessert, though).  I also tried the chocolate cake (yum) and the pistachio dessert (also yum).  The mac and cheese was delicious and the broccoli fondue was amazing!  Drinks were reasonably priced and tasty and our server was really friendly and helped us navigate the extensive menu. Overall, I would definitely come back again!

The bread basket and herbed butter were perfect.  I am a big ""bread"" person but only eat it if it's worth the calories. This was. We didn't have any appetizers, so went straight to the meat.  I ordered the 8 oz. filet medium rare and convinced my date to order the bone-in filet medium rare so I could try that too.  (Good man, lol!)   What a difference the bone-in makes!  My ""regular"" filet was good, but his was amazing.  The complimentary sauces on the side were also quite nice.   My absolute fave was the gorgonzola sauce.  The whiskey peppercorn is very strong/spicy so watch out.  I mistook it for the cabernet demi-glace and got quite a surprise, LOL! Side dishes ordered were the mac and cheese and the Lyonaisse potatoes.  So-so at best.  Kinzie's could definitely do some work here on better side dishes, although the menu offerings were thorough.  We just didn't love the execution on either one we tried. Dessert was a tough choice, but the chocolate hazelnut terrine ended up being terrific. I had wine by the glass and the merlot I chose was very nice and reasonably priced.  My date just had a beer.

2013-01-17,4.0,"Not a date. NOT a date. NOT A DATE!  Now that that's out of the way, I had a dinner meeting here with a coworker and this place was so freakin' swank---at least in comparison to the casual nature of most of my previous employer's work dinners, which largely involved a trek to another part of the building to snag some slices of pizza on a paper plate, the higher-ups avoiding making eye contact with underlings like myself and me trying to avoid being seen taking so many pieces of pizza for myself by the higher ups, followed swiftly by my slinking back to a cold, dark cubicle to eat in what might as well have been solitary confinement like a f*cking gremlin. My, my- how the times have changed. The point of that psuedo-preface was to illustrate even further (if you hadn't already noticed from my poor grammar and lack of professionalism), that I'm not really accustomed to being around nice things, going to nice places or even having to participate in mildly appropriate banal banter with another human, so while I may feel kind of take-it-or-leave-it about Kinzie Chop House, I'll try to review it for the masses so the two people who read this can have a better idea of what to expect when coming to Kinzie.  Things you should know that I did not: - The menu was a whole heck of a lot more affordable that I was expecting. Like, you can get a decent meal for $15-$20 bucks here.  - I was only familiar with Kinzie Chop House through mentions from friends and co-workers and what I got from hear-say is that it's a steakhouse and you should try to dress it up a bit if you go. At least business casual, and don't bring a bunch-a-bags of work crap in with you because then it won't matter what you're wearing and everyone will just assume you're some wack-job bag lady. Not that that happened to me. - Tuesday at 9pm. The bar area is totally empty and almost entirely silent, less the lightly-played sounds of very soft 80s rock.  - They're big on wine and they do some neat cocktails, but their beer menu is pretty dreadful. I got a 312 but only because it was exponentially better than the next best choice of Miller's Batch 19 and my date got an over-sized glass with side carafe of red wine because he likes to drink sissy stuff.  - The blackened sea scallops. Only around $13, you get 4 or 5 on a bed of spinach with a creamy, sweet sauce. For $13, the price is right, maybe even better than right, but personally, I would have preferred a simpler scallop, grilled in light olive oil, dash of S&P and a squirt of lemon... but that's just me and my simple taste buds not being accustomed to such rich, creamy flavors. You fancy folk will probably love it.  - Service. It was fine. Not terribly friendly, but again, I may or may not have looked like a bag lady and my NOT-date was wearing a Harry and the Hendersons T-shirt, which is undeniably cool, but not exactly the attire that screams 'ka-ching' for the server. - I'd say this place is probably great for a work lunch or dinner if you have a job with a dress code or a place where 'casual Friday' clothing still involves putting pants on. To me, it felt a bit stuffy, but I normally work from home and the nicest things I own are from Target so I don't know that there's much stock in my opinion here.  - I *guess* you *could* go here on a date, but I'd recommend not sitting in the bar area like we did. They do have some banquette seating against the wall that might be a bit more intimate, but otherwise the sound carries so the bartender can hear all the weird stuff you say and the lighting is set at a WAY brighter level than a not-natural beauty would like.  - I think it caters a bit more towards being appealing to men. It's not a feminine space, kind of cold and overall lacked the personality that I like to see in a restaurant, but it's a good neutral if you don't care about being wowed by exotic menu items, stop-on-a-dime service or comfortable atmosphere.",0.9983,0.812,0.152,0.036,0.5631800391389432

ATMOSPHERE: Made and Open Table reservation and they called me in the AM the day of to confirm the reservation. I'm not saying I'm blown away by this, but it was nice knowing the reservation went through because there have been times where places will be clueless as to how Open Table works... With the waterfall fixtures on the walls and the candlelit dinner, I can only describe the inside as intimate. White tablecloths with a sophistication that made me feel good I wore a tie and not a backwards baseball cap and shit sweater that some snot kid decided to wear with his family. I bet he was being a crybaby before he left, but to the food.  WHAT I ATE: After getting the rundown of the steaks they have in house while we hammered through their appetizer sample platter (Blackened scallops, shrimp cocktail, goat cheese, bruschetta, chicken skewers, and fried calamari); I ordered the Prime Rib. It was huge and tasty! The outside was crusted lightly with herbs and was accompanied with a creamy horseradish sauce and au jus. Perfection to say the least.  WILL I RETURN: Yes. There was so much on their menu I wanted to try. Maybe one day I can get some people to go in on the 48oz Porterhouse they have.  WHAT TO SKIP: Depending on your party size, the appetizer sampler was pretty huge. I'm sure they only offer it to tables with more than 4 people because 2 people could split that for a meal and be plenty full.",0.9857,0.83,0.142,0.028,0.6032921810699589

2012-12-02,4.0,"Kinzie was our work holiday dinner party destination this year, and it was a good choice! I searched all over yelp to find a steak house that would meet or exceed my boss's expectations, and I think it did.  The restaurant itself is smaller and more intimate than I expected, and I like that there are several distinct rooms with tables so the noise isn't out of control. I'd describe it as cozy and comfortable, and the staff is friendly and welcoming to go along with it.  We started off with the appetizer platter, which featured the blackened scallops, shrimp cocktail, bruschetta, calamari, and chicken skewers. I loved the blackened scallops - they had a great buttery texture and a perfectly spicy mustard flavor - but they were a little cold. The bruschetta was also fabulous, as it had a great balsamic vinegar sauce that made the bread soft but not soggy.  We all went the steak route for our entrees, but each of us had a different cut and/or preparation, from a bare porterhouse to an Oscar-style filet (me!). No one left any trace of food on their plates, so I'm assuming there were no complaints. My steak was a textbook medium rare, and the Oscar-style went along perfectly; I liked that the asparagus and crab meat were already chopped into small pieces so I was able to get all three flavors into one bite.  Unfortunately, the sides didn't live up to the hype that the special ""Kinzie"" notation by their name promised. The potatoes gratin were nothing special, and the cheese in the broccoli fondue was overwhelming. But, to be fair, they wouldn't have been my first choice to begin with.  Rafael and his team did a great job of taking care of us and pointing us in the right direction with his favorite dishes and cuts. Despite the missteps with the one appetizer and the sides, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it as a classy dinner destination if you love quality steak.",0.9961,0.733,0.214,0.053,0.6351817042606517

My mom had the salmon that was underdressed, but the waiter brought out more sauce without question and my Mom enjoyed her meal. The steaks were a bit overpriced for the size/quality.

I haven't had a pasta dish that tasty in a long time. The fettuccine was al dente, the sauce was a light tomato and it had TONS of seafood. There was as much seafood as pasta! It had mussels, scallops, and shrimp--for only $16.95. I also ordered a side of brussels sprouts but I felt they could of been better. The sides were a little high in price ($7). The sprouts were very large---too large, they should of been cut into quarters or they should of used the smaller kind which has more flavor. The service was wonderful and the bathroom was clean.

The non-steak part of the meal, however, didn't live up to the standard set by the steak.  We started with the blackened scallops which were cooked well but too salty.  For sides we had Brussels sprouts and mushroom risotto.  The sprouts were tasty, but the risotto was really sub-par.  Salty and sticky and everything risotto is not meant to be.  Perhaps it serves me right for ordering risotto at a steakhouse instead of a trattoria, but it really bummed me out.

The steaks, served a la carte, came soon after.  They were perfectly crusted and cooked.  I highly recommend getting ALL of the dipping sauces.  They are FREE! and so worth trying.  The mushroom medley and asparagus with hollandaise were a perfect pairing with the meal.  The sides are very reasonably priced for the amount of food in each serving.  Honestly, we didn't even miss the starch.   If I was rich, I would eat here as much as possible.  I've never been disappointed.  You should go.  I am obsessed.",0.9912,0.778,0.194,0.027,0.7077857142857142

My parents both ordered steak, the bone-in filet and the delmonico, and I ordered lamb.  My lamb was cooked medium like I requested, and my dad's steak was medium rare like he asked.  My mom ordered her's medium rare but it came out medium.  Now, my family, we're steak eaters and we know when a steak is cooked a proper medium rare, so when my mom cut into hers (like the waiter all asked us to when he set down the plates) her's was def. medium.  I understand the restaurant is dark and that some people may not know what medium rare is but it kind of rubbed me the wrong way when the waiter asked if he could look at it in the light to make sure.  But he toke her steak away and fired a new one.   The new steak came out on the rare side, but my mom didn't want to hassle them again.  Also, it took a while for our meal to come out; a couple seated a good 20 mins after us was almost done with their meal when we got ours, and my mom's 2nd steak took all of 5 mins so not to say we waited ""forever"" to get our food but it kind of surprised us how fast the second steak was cooked. But besides those few snafus, the meal was good.  I really liked my lamb with the mustard rub, the chipotle potatoes def. had a kick.  My dad ate his entire steak, which for him means good.  And while my mom didn't really like her steak, she loved the broccoli fondue and scallop potatoes we got as sides.  We also had the scallops for an appetizer and they were delicious.   Dessert (key lime pie and hot butter rum cheesecake) was kind of meh. So overall, the meal was good, not great.  The service was good and they were good about fixing my mom's steak.  Not in a rush to get back (I mean, it's Chicago, lots of other places to check out) but since it's close to my apt, if I ever crave a steak and am at a loss of where to go, I'd considered Kinzie Chop House.",0.9913,0.852,0.108,0.04,0.5115316700843019

The food was delicious. I had the prime rib and ate the entire thing. They give you a selection of sauces and they are unlimited.

2011-12-12,5.0,"I visited Kinzie Chop House to have an early and quiet date night with my fiance.  We arrived a little more than 30 minutes before our reservation, so we sat at the bar for a couple of cocktails.  The bar staff was very amicable and made great drinks; not much to mess up, but nothing I could complain about! We moved into the dining room and had no problems being seated.  I started off with what I thought would be an interesting drink, The Backstretch, as it was essentially an alcoholic Arnold Palmer.  You couldn't dislike it.  Big and strong, my type of drink. Appetizer: Jumbo Lump Crab Cake      -Very tasty, and large enough to share between the two of us.  Moist with just a little crust on top, the crab cake sat on top of some basic greens and the best spicy remoulade my lips have ever touched.  In fact, the sauce was so good that I went back to dip my bread in it after the crab cake was gone! Main Course 1: KC Strip-Pepper Rub-Butter Sauce      -Cooked PERFECTLY.  I haven't been to many steakhouses in the Chicago area, but one has yet to cook a proper Medium Rare, until Kinzies that is.  Wonderful flavor throughout the steak, good size, and fantastic rub.  The steak presentation is actually what sold me on the KC, so very nice.  I could have done without the butter sauce, however.  I will choose a different sauce option next time we are in. Main Course 2: Jalapeno Barbecued Pork Tenderloin      -If I wasn't in the mood for steak, I so would have had two orders of this juicy tender heaven.  The bold flavors and barbecue sauce meshed perfectly, and we were cutting the pork with only a knife.  Fantastic!  It sat on a bed of a homemade slaw, which was good, but there was a bit too much of it on the plate. Side: Bacon and Scallion Smashed & Broccoli Fondue      -People think I am crazy when I tell them that my favorite food is broccoli, but places like Kinzies only makes me love it more.  Melted cheese (which was a great flavor) over perfectly cooked broccoli = Heaven.  The smashed potatoes were great as well, however, I could have used more bacon, like there is such a thing as too much bacon. Dessert: Hot Buttered Rum Cheesecake & Pistachio Semifreddo      -This was one of the greatest highlights of the evening.  This was the best cheesecake I have ever eaten.  We were told that all of the desserts were made in house, and you can definitely tell by how rich and creamy this dish was.  Add some strawberries, whip cream, and buttered rum sauce in one bite, and your mouth will be having a party worth all exaltation.      -Pistachio Semifreddo.  First off, I had  never had gelato before, and while I know it isn't a far cry from yogurt/ice cream, I was still a bit wary.  The first bite of this dessert became the best dish I had eaten there (yes, even more than my broccoli.)  The gelato was fantastic and the freshly baked sugar crisps were so light, surprisingly deep in flavor.  I am getting married in less than a year and I would be honored and elated to have this semifreddo for a dessert.      --Also, the desserts are $5.95 each...Crazy!!  I would pay $15 for both of the desserts we had!  Superb! All-in-all, I cannot wait to go back to Kinzie Chop House.  The atmosphere was great, the prices were fantastic given the value, and the staff was phenomenal.  The manager stopped by our table a couple of times and was one of the best front of house managers I had come into contact with in a very long time.  I will bring family, friends, and business here any day of the week.  Great job, Kinzie!!",0.9997,0.697,0.282,0.021,0.5510500610500612

2011-11-23,4.0,"Kinizie was great! My boyfriend and I made reservations at Kinzie on Nov 19 through our hotel concierge around 1:30 pm on Nov 19. By the time we arrived 30 minutes late for our 6:30 pm reservation, we were engaged! Our concierge called to inform them of our exciting news, and the wonderful maitre d', Ryan, greeted us as soon as we walked in the door and gave us special treatment throughout the evening! Ironically, I was the one who insisted we make reservations, yet I had no idea of our impeding engagement! Partway through our meal, Ryan came over to check on us and asked to see my ring, asked about the proposal, etc. Then he shared with us that two years ago on the same night he proposed to his wife! How wonderful! It was very touching that someone we didn't even know was so genuinely excited for us! We began our meal with drinks - I was drinking the excellent Silver Mer Soleil Chardonnay and he chose the mojito (his go-to drink). I was really impressed with both, a great suggestion on the part of our server since i normally drink pinot grigio! For appetizers, we had the herbed baked goat cheese and wild mushroom & gorgonzola cheese torte. Both were wonderful! My taste buds were going crazy and I was so ready for my main course - risotto! Unfortunately, my risotto never came. This is where Kinzie loses a star. Instead, the server came over nearly thirty minutes after I had ordered and informed me that it could not be made without the chicken stock. When I ordered, he was very clear that it could be done ""no problem"" so I was pretty disappointed and a little choked, but luckily nothing could ruin my mood because of the new, giant, sparkly rock on my finger! Instead of the risotto I ordered the Portobello Ravioi. DF had the 12 oz filet and we shared sides of Brussels Sprouts and Asparagus with Hollandaise. His medium-rare fliet was cooked perfectly and, in his own words, ""mmmmnnnn."" I'm a sucker for pan-fried Brussels and once again, I was very satisfied! I can never say no to asparagus, and it was cooked perfectly and served with the Hollandaise on the side for dipping - which I promptly drizzled all over the gorgeous green stalks! For dessert we shared the profiterole. One of our most beloved Italian favorites, these were quite good but not the best we've ever had. Still, no complaints! We were served complimentary glasses of rose champagne with our dessert which was a nice little touch to help us celebrate our special occasion! After dessert, Ryan once again came over to chit chat. He was asking what brought us to Chicago, etc. We had a nice 5+ minute conversation with him, he examined my ring and told my fiance ""great job!"" etc. He insisted that we let him know next time we are in town, not just to come into the restaurant but to grab drinks together. Now that, my friends, is service. It's a beautiful thing when you can bond with a restaurant employee to the point where you would like to hang out with him/her after your meal.

To make this short and sweet we started off with: Appetizer: Calamari -Fresh, lightly fried w/ an amazing mayo based (spicy) sauce which was to die for!! Sides:  Sauteed Spinach  & Mushroom -This was great but the only downside to this was that it was mostly mushroom w/ very little spinach. I was expecting spinach not ALL mushroom...still a great side Lyonnaise Potato Gratin -This was so flavorful BUT I was not expecting so many damn onions! I took 3 bites of which all consisted of more onions than potatoes. Again, this was great, but if I would of known it was so many onions I may have thought twice about ordering it. Entree: 16oz Delmonico -I absolutely enjoyed this! It was soo juicy & full of flavor! I chose the Gorgonzola Cream as my sauce & it was delicious. This was worth every bit of $30.  18oz Kansas City -My boyfriend LOVED this, I'm not sure what side he had but it was prepared PERFECTLY. All in all I WILL return here! The waiting staff was prompt and knowledgeable.  The only downside was that some of the dishes (Delmonico Gorgonzola cream & lyonnaise potato gratin) were too creamy. I was unaware that they were dairy based & this caused me quit a bit of pain once my dinner was complete (lactose intolerant).  It was also my BF birthday & they brought out a cheescake w/ a candle w/ Birthday spell BISHDAY on it.

Food was very good and ample portions.  Our friends who ordered the steaks complimented their ability to cut and cook to order and the accuracy.  We compliment their lovely seafood and vege options which would be proudly served in pescatorian and vegetarian establishments respectively.

My wife had the fillet, and it was also perfectly cooked and cut.  The attention to detail is next to none, and the staff even prepared a custom dessert, with my wife's name on it for her birthday.

2011-09-07,3.0,"A review for a restaurant like Kinzie has to take into consideration its prices. So the rating should not be in the context of Outback or Lonestar, but other steakhouses where steaks are in the $40 range. I had their $50 special of the day, which was the 16oz dry-aged Delmonico with two shrimp and risotto. First, the steak looked small for 16oz. Second, the steak was slightly burned (I ordered ""medium""). Third, it didn't have the tenderness and taste normally associated with a dry-aged ribeye. Sure, it was better than a ribeye from Outback, but that shouldn't be the benchmark, should it? Overall there's nothing wrong with Kinzie but it's a rather forgettable and ho-hum experience and I don't feel compelled to go back.",0.9044,0.85,0.118,0.032,0.3775226757369614

I called ahead to ask whether it would be okay to bring in a cake; the hostess said it was against their policy but that she thought it should be fine. I was worried that I might run into some trouble when I actually arrived, but as soon as I walked in the hostess noticed the cake, asked if I wanted them to bring it out with the candles to sing and then take it back to slice it, and took it right off my hands with a smile. Very much appreciated that! I don't have too much experience with steakhouses, so I thought it was fun that they brought out the different types of steaks beforehand to present and explain. I had the Del Monaco medium rare, and thought it was perfectly cooked. We shared the asaparagus with hollandaise (nothing too special), lyonnaise potato gratin (delicious), and the sauteed spinach and mushroom (my favorite!) as our sides.  We were seated against a wall so had plenty of space, and the ambience was wonderful. Mostly low conversations in soft lighting, very nice.

Luckily my mom and I have the same brain so when it came to picking an appetizer and entree, we both were torn between the same two choices.  Luckily time two, we are smart enough to not order the same thing and split that right down the middle.  Yay for smart ladies. For the first course we got the salad with balsamic vinaigrette and the bruschetta... also with balsamic vinaigrette.  They love them some balsamic.  For a $27.95 prix fixe menu I was expecting approximately one tiny piece of toast with like four cubes of tomato on it but oh lordy no, it was three fist sized pieces of bread with tomatoes exploding out of it.  So much goodness.  The salad bowl was deceptively deep, we kept eating and it never went anywhere.  Double thumbs up for the starters. For entrees, I got the jumbo shrimp with broccoli and mushrooms and my mom got the 8 oz Kinzie cut with rosemary french fries.  Steak was cooked perfectly and the butter on it was heavenly.  Fries were awesome, crispy and perfectly seasoned.  Plus anything with rosemary wins in my book.  The shrimp again, perfectly cooked and huge.  The veggies were delicious and portions again, pretty amazing. For desserts, she got the chocolate cake because she is a chocolate whore and I got the butter rum cheesecake.  I so wanted to eat all of it but I failed.  I was so full.  In a good way.  Both were lovely.

The ahi tuna tartar was wonderful, and I filched a few mussels from my colleague which were delightful.  Unfortunately, I was a complete space-cadet during ordering, and thought that my colleague had ordered the special of the day (a Kinzie-cut with asparagus and rock-shrimp risotto on the side), and asked for another of the same.   While the waiter was delivering the food, my confusion at getting a steak risotto with asparagus was  very apparent, but being tight on time, I admitted that it was my mistake as that was what my colleague had ordered and told him not to worry about it, and that I would make do. Next thing I know, Elyse had come to our table and announced that she'd heard that someone didn't get what they actually wanted for lunch, and that she wouldn't stand for it, and would get whatever I wanted from the kitchen right away.  Wow!  She walked the steak out to me and waited until I had confirmed that it was the right temperature and was completely to my liking before deciding that I was back on track to having a great lunch and she didn't need to do any more magic.   The food was exceptional (FYI - the rock shrimp risotto is an appetizer too...don't pass it up), and the ambience is great, but the staff make this place a solid winner for a great place to bring clients or colleagues.  Our waiter was discreet but always on his game, and Elyse made my day.  People that care, love people, and love what they do will make repeat customers out of anyone.",0.9982,0.775,0.199,0.026,0.549904761904762

My wife had the Perch special, which was a beauitiful, light, tasty piece of fish.  She loved the mushroom risotto.  She also got a side of the Broccoli Fondue with melted Gouda Cheese.  This was absolutely decadent and went great with both of our dishes.

2011-05-04,2.0,"We had reservations on a Saturday night and this is how it played out! The place was packed and we were early so we sat in the bar to have a drink. The bartender asked what we wanted and I said, my friend wants a martini and I would like to see the bottle menu. He told me that the glasses of wine were in the back of the menu that I was holding, and went on to help everyone else in the bar before coming back to us 10 minutes later. He asked again and so did I. He gave me the menu and walked away. By this time my friend would have been finished with his tini if he had one. So I ordered a bottle at $60 dollars and we waited for them to bring it up from the basement. Again, my friend with the tini that I asked for two times was still dry. Next to us was a couple that were almost finished with their steak, when they asked if he had put thru the order for the french fries? When he came back with them, they also asked for steak knives as the one's for the butter looked silly! A little late for both I'd say. We got called for our table at the exact time of our reservation and I told the bartender to just have the bottle brought to the table. I could see the sour look on his face as he wasn't going to get the tip off of it. I allways take care of servers, but this is the second time I have had the pleasure of being served by this guy and I was done. We were seated, given bread and water, the waiter gave us menu's and forgot about us. He was serving way to many tables in the room, and as we were in the corner it was easy to pass us by 10 or 15 times and not even make eye contact. He graced us with his presence 10 minutes later with the wine. The time that he took to open it up he was staring across the room at what was probably a more important table. I looked at my friend in disbelief. He went to pour a second glass and I stopped him by saying, he's been trying to get a martini for the last half hour. Finally the drink arrives. A.K.A. drive by? At this rate I'm thinking that the dinner is going to last all night. The people next to us were seated 15 minutes after us and they were already eating. He came back and asked if we would like to see the steak tray. No, we wanted the pre-fix menu. Susan the owner wrote to me upon my last review and told us about it. We ordered the onion rings off the reg menu. They were delicious, but I am not sure why they were served with ketchup? The first item off the pf was the caeser and it was pretty good. When they brought us our plates for the main course I was shocked. The medallions that I ordered as medium looked like little brickettes because they were so over cooked. The shrimp were a handful of those tini numbers that you would find at a chinese buffet. And the crab cake. We were making fun of it because it looked like it was cut from a can and it had way to much corn meal in it. Crabby-patty anyone. They put sauce under the steak, but the shrimp and CP were dry? Now I know that I ordered off of the pre-fix and I get what I pay for. But at $100 dollars not including the wine, I expected something a little more like the first experience that I had. If you need to, raise the price and serve something acceptable. What I was served and how I was served to me made up my mind, that I will never return. Susan, when you read this.

2011-04-12,4.0,"I've only ever been here for lunches, and business lunches at that. But for a business lunch, this is a perfect venue. For a business lunch, I'd say 75% of decision should be venue/atmosphere-based, and 25% food-based. It's what's happening, not what's being eaten, that matters. Though you don't want your client or your boss or partner sending something back for that matter. Ok, maybe its 70/30 or perhaps even 60/40. But in terms of atmosphere, Kinzie Chophouse is a 5-star for a business lunch. It's quiet, so you can conduct business without shooting across the table, but its not so silent that you have to worry about wandering ears picking up bits and pieces. When you walk in, it just smells business. A suited-up crowd, mostly older men with briefcases.  And the waitstaff is well-aware that is the type of crowd they are dealing with, so they are attentive without being overly so. I've never had the awkward interruption of a waiter during a discussion. In essence, they make themselves non-existent while still getting you your food and drinks. Perfect. And the menu has tons of options to suit all types of diets. Even my vegetarian friends could find options here. Most people (dear god I hope not at least) don't come to lunch and order the bone-in fillet, so they have an array of sandwiches and pastas, salads and burgers. The steak risotto is tasty, if not a tad bit heavy for my liking. The portobello mushroom burger is solid, and I've had virtually every salad they have to offer.  I'm not sure I'd venture here for dinner or non-business related stuff--a bit too stuffy and formal for my tastes.

Back to our steak....our waiter highly recommended the Delmonico and stated it was very flavorful.  We agree and decided to go with that medium rare.  The steak came out looking delicious but once we stuck the fork and knife in it....it was almost 30% all fat.    It was a slab of meat with chunks of fat and very bland....I wouldn't consider undercooked fat flavorful!   So disappointed!  Would have spent a little more and gone to David B or somewhere I knew was better.  Oh well.....hope your experience will be better!",0.9249,0.756,0.142,0.101,0.5894571428571429

I guess the waiter misheard me, because I ended up getting the side dish of mushroom risotto. It worked out okay though, because the salad was a pretty good portion, and it filled me up pretty quickly. The goat cheese was in this weird falafel form as a warm, green cake, but the flavor was still solid. The risotto was decent as well, although I wasn't a big fan of them using button mushrooms. Portobello or shitake seemed more appropriate.  My bf got the 16-ounce angus steak. It came out as a huge, thick slab of meat. I've gotten him used to Texas steak now, so he preferred more seasoning, not just butter. I, personally, thought the butter was fine, but the cut was too fatty. Anyways, he managed to finish the whole thing and walked out of the restaurant a pound heavier.  The wait for a table was long, even with reservations.

2011-02-25,3.0,"Kinzie Chop House is fine; I've been here a handful of times for both lunch and dinner. When I lived in the neighborhood a few years ago, it was fairly easy to get a table on a Saturday night sans a reservation, so it came in handy for those last-minute red-meat cravings.  On one of my last visits for lunch, I got the steak risotto, which was a hot mess, so when I went for lunch yesterday, I knew to steer clear of that.  My friend had arrived just before I did and already had a table. I liked that they will seat you even if your entire party isn't there, as so many places refuse to do that during peak times. I joined him and our server brought us menus, but never asked us if we wanted beverages, so it's a good thing we were given water, which was all we wanted anyway.  He came back to take our order; a cobb salad for me and a crab cake sandwich for my friend. Food was served promptly (by a runner), always appreciated at lunch when time is of the essence.  My cobb salad was kind of boring. I expected chunks of turkey but instead got small pieces of what looked like slices from a deli counter. And there were also far too many mushroom stems. I usually discard stems when I'm cooking so I don't expect to see them in salads. The ranch dressing that came on top didn't have much flavor either. For $11.95, I was hoping for better than what I got.  My friend enjoyed his crab cake sandwich so next time, I'll take a cue from him and order that.  Our server dropped off the check after our plates were cleared. In fact, other than to take our order and drop off the check, we had no interaction with him at all. I don't need a lot of fussing and fawning, but a quick ""Do you have everything you need?"" is appreciated (and indeed, expected in a place like this).  I've always enjoyed dinner at Kinzie Chop House, so perhaps it's better to go there for dinner as opposed to lunch.

Paul, my bartender, was very nice and helped me choose a good glass of wine. The restaurant was pretty empty when I showed up at 5:30 pm, but as it was the night before Valentine's Day it began filling up very fast. I still had quick service from the server and the bartender. I ordered half a dozen oysters and they are some of the best I've had in the city.

I was sad when they were gone. I went back the next night for dinner on Valentine's Day. Even though the restaurant was packed me and my friend were still treated wonderfully by all involved.

After our experience last year, we were astonished that owner, Ms Susan Frasca, took time to read our review and personally respond. She seemed as let down as were with our 25th anniversary Kinzie Chop House experience. With Ms Frasca's apparent dedication to customer satisfaction as excellent as it is rare we decided to celebrate our 26th at Kinzie Chop House and it turned out to be the stuff culinary dreams are made of! We're pretty much lost in a wine list this extensive so Burton made several recommendations based on our preferences then informed us it was half-price bottle night! Yay! After some deliberation and debate, we started with the cheese tray appetizer -- a brilliant selection of cheeses, fresh fruit, and toast points. We savored each of the cheeses but our favorite with the goat cheese rolled in fresh herbs and lightly grilled.

Meh: I went for the Kansas City steak because hey let us get some flavor from being bone-in.  I ordered medium but I got unpleasantly charred on the outside and less-cooked-than-I'd-like on the inside.  But since I'm a shy midwestern boy who doesn't view himself an expert on steak and would hate to waste any food--or as they would say in New York: a putz--I ate the thing and didn't complain despite the fact the exceptionally friendly staff kept asking me how everything was. Meh: My steak came with a free side concocted from mashed potatoes, onions, veggies and shrimp.  Given the quality of the shrimp, I suspect this side was assembled from surplus ingredients.  They should have just left the shrimp out. Good: Castle Rock Cabernet.  I'm not a wine snob but this glass had plenty of flavor and kept up with the steak just fine. Okay: Dessert.  The shell on the creme brulee was awfully thick up top.  I had something chocolate that was pleasant enough.",0.955,0.762,0.156,0.082,0.5208532695374801

The Good: $25-3 course prix fixe -started with the bacon, potato, leek soup: pretty good but a little thin. But then again it's really hard to make potatoes and bacon taste bad. -side salad: REALLY average, very heavily dressed -10oz New York Strip: Just such a boring piece of steak. It's too lean and so even medium rare sucked all the juice out of the meat. It was a little better after I asked for a side of more jus. The side of mac &cheese was really rich and the baked bread crumbs gave it some extra crunch-crunch -chocolate cake: really good, dense and rich.  -pumpkin cheesecake: also really dense and rich. Literally tasted like if pumpkin pie and cheesecake had a preemie. It tasted fine, but seemed a little underdeveloped.  -bottle of malbec: helped everything out A LOT I gave it an extra star because of the super nice service. Our server was very friendly and attentive. He wouldn't even let my bf refill our wine glasses.  I would definitely come again but only if they weren't serving NY strip.

You can imagine my immense sad face when upon sampling of said dinner (which at $35 on a Tuesday is a bit of a splurge) I was greeted with a complete and utter lack of flavor.  Now I know I ordered from a ""chop house"" but I wasn't feeling the red meat and I went with a stuffed baked potato and angel hair pasta, tossed with olive oil, fresh basil, tomatoes and mushrooms. The pasta was the blandest thing I'd ever tasted, the tomatoes were bitter and there were maybe three slivers of basil...all the olive oil was at the bottom and there was a lot. The mushrooms were greasy and tasteless, salt and pepper couldn't save this trainwreck of a dish.  So move onto the stuffed baked potato, because you can't mess that up, right? Wrong. I like to consider myself a potato connoisseur...baked, fried, mashed, I don't discriminate, I love them all.

Delicious! -Caesar salad: perfect split for the two of us as we just wanted a little bite of salad. It was fresh and delicious -Bone in filet: perfectly cooked rare. And warm!! Last time, my biggest gripe was that the steak was cold but it was warm and perfectly cooked. Melted in our mouths! -Mashed with bacon and garlic: Wow, so delicious! We were so sad that we didn't order another one. It melted in our mouths with our steak! -Chocolate cake: what i love about the desserts is that they're not outrageously sized. It was a perfect ending to our dinner to end with a little bit of sweet without it being too overwhelming or pushing us over the edge. The cake itself was warmed with slices of strawberry and some creme fraiche. +Another plus: free corkage!! how many nice steakhouses offer free corkage?? We brought a great bottle of Silver Oak and enjoyed it with our dinner with no corkage fee! +Service: perfect. it was great last time as well.

We had a reservation and were seated immediately; however, it was a Sunday evening, so I did not expect anything less.  The restaurant looked nice, but a little cluttered with a lot of tables fitted into the front room.  The back room looked like it had booths, but I only saw that from the corner of my eye - so I could be totally off.  The table for four that we were seated at was small for the number of things they had on it.  I felt crowded, but after a while got used to it.  The rest of the dining experience was positive - good, prompt service.   I ordered the halibut was cooked to perfection, sprinkled with coarsely ground, black pepper, and served on a bed of mushrooms and asparagus.  The sauce had the just the right amounts of ginger and lime, making for an appetizing, filling and reasonably healthy meal.  The three diners I was with ordered the summer special, which included a choice of appetizer (1 of 2) entree (1 of 3) and dessert (1 of 2).  The portions were nicely sized, although the grilled shrimp entree only included 4 shrimp.  The veggies were fresh and nicely seasoned.  The Decadent Chocolate Cake was delicious, but I felt the Chocolate Terrine could have been less chilled...kind of difficult to get the full effect of chocolate mousse if the temperature is not right.  I also tasted the rum cheesecake, which was good.   I started this review with four stars, then took one away as I realized that my dining experience there was good but not stellar .    P.S.  for those who have children and like to frequent steakhouses, we saw an infant at one of the tables.  Another peculiar observation - the majority of people were really dressed down - shorts, tank tops, jeans etc.  Not quite what I expected.",0.9959,0.812,0.175,0.014,0.5336525427434518

Steaks My bone-in Delmonico (ribeye) was cooked perfectly.  Slightly charred on the outside, perfectly pink inside.  Surprisingly the outer part was not all that flavorful, but it definitely got better as I worked towards the bone.  From a strict meat perspective, I think I'm still a bigger fan of David Burke. Service Again, phenomenal.  First our server indulged in our wanting to see the meat cuts and explained the cow parts.  And though he screwed up our order, he more than compensated by refilling our side of spinach & mushrooms and offered to buy us all dessert .  Though perhaps he knew 3 guys weren't going to order dessert (ha!), it's the thought that counts. While I was there to go to town on cows, if I wasn't, Kinzie had a fantastic value $20 3 course prix fixe.  But in general, the prices at Kinzie seem to be slightly lower than the competition, and quality does not suffer.  Combine that with great service = great meal.  I'll come back.   Oh, and the private room seems like a good time.",0.9879,0.752,0.193,0.055,0.4417460317460317

That being said, we had a passable meal here.  The caesar salad was wilted, and the dressing was thick with hardly any good garlicky, ceasary, flavor.  My steak was cooked the way I ordered, but was lacking in flavor (and it was the ribeye medium rare, which should be FULL of flavor).  The creamed spinach side was good but more cream than spinach.  Not too good for a steakhouse. Also, our server got our order wrong, and the table next to ours order wrong.  He brought my companion a blackened steak (he did not order it blackened) and an extra side (which we did not order and he quickly removed).   He corrected both, but it seemed weird.  He joked that we should have kept the risotto, but my companion does not eat cultivated grains, but whatever.  He was friendly, but was obviously not paying enough attention. Long wine list, but not much on the lower priced end as far as wines go. The other really disappointing thing was that our server did not know where the beef came from, or what type of beef it was (grass fed or not).  To me, this is unacceptable from a restaurant that bills itself as a locally-owned and operated steakhouse.  The hostess was extremely nice.  The music is really odd (we sat in the lounge), and ill-paired with the atmosphere. We chose this restaurant because of its close location to our hotel, and the fact that it's not one of those chain steakhouses that you see everywhere else you go.  I wish I could give a better review, but this reflects our experience.",0.2701,0.827,0.09,0.083,0.5552469135802469

Definitely try the Spring Fever Prixe Fixe menu. 3 courses for only $20 (You need to ask them for it though. They won't hand it to you first). I had the caesar salad and beef medallions with jumbo scallops on tomato basil polenta. The salad was one of the best caesar salad's I've ever had, so if you're a fan, I would try that. As for the main entree scallops weren't jumbo, but still tasty and perfectly cooked. The beef medallions were tender and juicy and the sauce (I forget what it was) complimented it all very well. I've never had polenta before, so I can't compare, but I'd have to say it was good as well.  Our favorite dish, however, came from the regular menu. We all agreed that the steak risotto was the best dish at the table. So flavorful and not too creamy.  For dessert, we had the decadent chocolate cake and butter rum cheesecake. The decadent chocolate cake was a little too rich for my taste and definitely needed to be paired with some ice cream to balance it out, but it was served with some whipped cream instead. My friends and I thought the cheesecake was AMAZING! It's a must try!",0.9964,0.765,0.222,0.014,0.638980463980464

I was on a no meat kick (I know, weird) so I ordered the mushroom and goat cheese tart...hello, delicious! It was not exactly ""light"" in any sense, it had a crispy pastry crust that perfectly accented the cheese and yummy 'shrooms. I was definitely in the mood for this pairing as I went for the portobello ravioli for my main and was not dissapointed!

Don't use the word ""chop"" anywhere in the title of a salad that isn't chopped. First time I've been to a chop house that didn't have a chopped salad. I know the description was right there, but I just saw ""chop"" - which usually signifies a chopped salad even it's called chophouse - and assumed that was the action used in it's preparation.  Man, how disappointed was I to see whole pieces of everything except the cucumbers? Very.  2. That vinaigrette is not all that vinaigrette-y. It's a little thick and heavier than one would expect. This added insult to the injury of whole pieces.  Now, outside of the salad, I LOVED my entree and dessert. Absolutely looooooved, darling! Who knew fish at a steak house could be so toothsome? Other people who aren't me knew. It was succulent, tender, and perfectly seasoned. The sauce it was pleasantly wading in made it sing.  Anytime you take your first bite and without thinking cease speaking to look back down at your plate as if it had just shared a shocking secret with you, the food has moved you. Damn. I have a strong fondness for hot buttered rum. I adore cheesecake. Combine them? It's ecstasy. Firm, yet still creamy.

I returned to Kinzie Chop House last night with the friend who initially recommended it a couple years ago.  While it was still a fantastic meal, I was slightly disappointed that the ambiance had not held up to my previous visit.  That is not to say the restaurant doesn't offer great service and a very classy dining experience but there was a certain flair to my first visit that lacked this time around.  Things that remained true - the meal was perfectly timed.  As we finished our appetizer, our salads arrived and moments after placing the last bite of my delicious salad, my entree was being delivered piping hot.  The food, itself, was as fantastic as I remembered.  We started with the calamari.  It was certainly one of the better calamari orders I have had in recent years.  I especially enjoyed the Cajun flavored dipping sauce.  Next I had the Caesar salad.  It was deliciously topped with seasoned croutons that had quite a bite!  For my entree, I ordered the beef medallions.  The beef was excellent itself but the addition of the mushroom cabernet was simply blissful.  I also enjoyed every last bit of the bacon and scallion mashed potatoes.  For dessert, I had the rum cheesecake.  Despite being incredibly full by then, it was insanely hard to put down the fork.  It was amazing. Things that I missed - while our server was very nice and tended to us well, there was just that little something extra the last visit that I missed this time.  It is all in the small details.  There was no request to hang my jacket, nobody pulled out my seat, and there wasn't that flair of communication from the server to leave us in salivating anticipation of our meal.  Now, the absence of these things are not detrimental to our dinner.  Our service was still stellar.  It just is hard to be objective when the service blew you out of the water before.  I went into the evening expecting the same and felt a slight tinge of disappointment.   Even on an off day, Kinzie is still a premiere chop house that has my affection.  I look forward to a return.",0.9963,0.764,0.186,0.051,0.4912037037037037
2010-03-17,4.0,"Back in my Yelp rube days, I called this my favorite steakhouse in Chicago.  I've been rethinking that today, but I'll probably let it stand.  I reevaluate because it doesn't seem special enough; however, it's always at least ""good"" across the board, if not necessarily great, and I haven't found another place that knocks my socks off.  I've probably dined five or six times and always enjoyed myself.   Last night I talked a friend into accompanying me for the Winter Delights prix fixe menu.  Even if the food is mediocre, you can't beat a $20 deal.  Thankfully, most of the food was far better than mediocre. I started with the chophouse salad (just a plain salad, but with a decent honey-mustard dressing) but also ordered a calamari appetizer to share (not on the prix fixe menu).  The calamari were very good; there seemed to be something in the batter giving it more than just a standard fried flavor.  The accompanying marinara was bland, but there was also a sort of Cajunish remoulade kind of dip which was really, really good. Beef medallions entree:  this seemed like a generous portion for a $20 prix fixe.  Kudos to the restaurant for that.  And it was damn good, too, served with ""bacon and scallion smashed potatoes"" and a ""mushroom cabernet demi-glace.""  Those are solid, basic flavors put together very well by the Kinzie kitchen.  You can never go wrong with mushrooms, red wine, and steak--those three compliment each other like whiskey, loneliness, and bad decisions.  The steak was cooked a perfect medium-rare too. And dessert!  I opted for the flourless chocolate cake and was NOT disappointed--quite the opposite, in fact.  Flourless cakes are often too rich and/or boring, but this version was one of the best that I've had.  It was the perfect balance of solid and gooey, not too potent and not too bland (satisfying the Goldilocks in me).  I tried a bite of my friend's rum cheesecake and--I say this as a staunch hater of cheesecake--I would have eaten an entire slice, it was that good.",0.9973,0.706,0.232,0.063,0.5714342403628119

The salads were nothing to write home about, especially mine, but the Caesar looked and tasted well.   My tenderloin dish was mediocre and slightly over cooked with no real flavor to speak of. I know it's tenderloin and not fillet, but still disappointing. My mashed potatoes were very tasty and the sauce served on the plate did help overall satisfaction. My one small taste of the salmon dish further underscored the tenderloin's quality vs. other options. I'm sure there is high quality food served here, I just didn't order it tonight.

A few days after popping my Restaurant Week cherry, I ventured to Kinzie Chophouse to dine with some Yelp girlfriends. Kinzie is featuring their Winter Delights prix fixe special, which runs until March 19th. $20 gets you a choice of 2 salads, a choice of 4 entrees and a choice of 3 desserts.  For my meal I went with the Chophouse salad, herb-crusted salmon, and chocolate cake. The salad was fine, a simple mixed green salad with a balsamic dressing. My entree was a generous serving of salmon over mustard sauce with a side of broccoli. The salmon was well prepared; it was both flavorful and moist. My only complaint about my entree is that I wish the mustard sauce had more kick, I found it to err on the bland side. To cap off my meal I went with the chocolate cake, it was so good! The cake was warm, with a soft, gooey center and chocolate sauce drizzled over the top. My plate was garnished with some whipped cream and strawberries too. I'd seriously consider paying $20 for this alone; if I could get a larger portion of course.  Service was attentive and friendly. Our waiter was always there when we needed him, but not in a hovering sort of way. Refills on waters and beverages were also taken care of promptly. I loved that our server subtotaled our meals on the check so we had to do minimal math to figure out what each of us owed, it was a nice touch. At the end of our meal a member of the staff (possibly a manager) checked in to see how our meal was.  My only complaint was with regard to layout. We were seated in the south room (the first one you see when walking in) and the tables are very close together and very small. Our 4-person table really would have been optimal for 2.

The service is fantastic. Everyone is friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. The tee shirt and jeans crowd is treated the same as those in business attire; you won't find any air of snobbery here. The lunch menu is a good value. Ask to get your burger/sandwich on a pretzel roll, as it is basically heaven on a plate. I've also eaten a few of the non-steak entrees for lunch. The rock shrimp risotto is amazing, and sans shrimp, it doubles as the wild mushroom risotto side item. It has a creamy texture and is a satisfying substitute for a side of baked/mashed potatoes.

We got steak and shared asparagus. The fried calamari to start (get this!). Some wine and a couple of cocktails later and we left very satisfied. I realize that this may not be the most top notch steak house or have super unique selections like others but the service here outdoes every other steakhouse in the city - hands down. Our waiter was kind and patient and friendly. The perfect balance of attention and giving us our space. The third time we went was because we got a buy one get one free entree coupon. The buy one get one includes steak of course so we had to go back. Our third time was by far our best experience. Our waiter was perfect. I got the buttery tender filet mignon and my fiancé got a dry aged steak. We shared grilled veggies and started with the melt in your mouth, super savory and rich calamari. A drizzle of lemon atop really cuts the grease and makes this an A+ starter. We ordered a bottle of Gordon Brothers cab. So delicious. By the time we were finished with our meal (it took quite a while and we were not rushed one bit) one of the bus boys took our plates and another came by and set in front of us a yummy chocolaty dessert - the Chocolate Terrine. We did not order this and looked up at our waiter as he nodded at us from across the room to indicate that he ordered the dessert for us - gratis. So we dug in. Super rich and creamy chocolate heaven. A bit of the bitter rich chocolate with a small dab of the berry sauce it's served with was the perfect balance of bitter, sweet and tart.

The woman I spoke with about reservations asked if there was a special reason for dining with them. I say, um, yeah, it's for a birthday. Skip to night of the dinner. Though we were all running 5-10 minutes late, they didn't make us feel guilty or make us wait for another table.

For the main course, two of us had the beef tenderloin medallions with mushrooms and mashed potatoes, while the other had the penne pasta. All were delicious. The tenderloins are cooked medium rare, which were absolutely perfect. That and the mashed potatoes all melted in my mouth with every bite. I'm not a fan of mushrooms, but they were also pretty damn tasty. My friend who had the pasta loves anything with gorgonzola (sp?) cream sauce and enjoyed her dish. I had the chocolate cake, which was like a molten lava cake. Yum. It was topped with a touch of whip cream. The other two dining guests had the rum cheesecake. I had a bite and had to rethink my dessert choice for a second. Because it was my birthday, the waitress surprised us with a complimentary creme brulee dessert for the occasion. Holy omg.

We started off with the herb-baked goat cheese salad. Pretty average in terms of taste and texture. I could probably find a similar salad at a Panera. The sides weren't anything special either. The creamed spinach was a little different in that I'm used to the spinach being more diced up and incorporated into the sauce. Instead, the spinach was whole leaf in the parmesan sauce. The hash browned potatoes weren't too bad, but I'm surprised they didn't have any kind of mashed potatoes on the menu. But at a steakhouse, the sides and salads should take a backseat to the main attraction: the steak. My friend and I shared the 48 oz porterhouse. I was very underwhelmed with the flavor and texture. The outside was a little too charred for my liking. If there was some kind of rub on the outside, I wouldn't mind the extra flavor, but it was pretty plain. And it wasn't too juicy at all. I had to rely on the ""au jus"" sauce to provide the extra juice and flavor. Overall, again a pretty average experience. The service also wasn't anything to write home about.

The first course was a choice between seafood chowder and chopped salad. As the seafood chowder was in a tomato-based broth (something my inner Cape Cod-der cannot stomach), I went with the chopped salad. This course came out lightning-fast - beating our drinks to the table and giving the impression that our dishes had been sitting in the kitchen awaiting us rather than being fresh-made/laddled when we ordered. The salad itself was wholly underwhelming. There was far too much dressing and it was unceremoniously plopped in one big glob on top of the lettuce. My dining companions had the soup. While eating, one of them summed it up perfectly when she asked, spoon in hand, ""Where's the seafood? Is this it?"" holding up a piece of fish.  The main course was a choice of ten ounce rib-eye with mac & cheese, butternut squash ravioli, chicken pot pie, and perhaps one other option. We all went with the steak - this is a steakhouse, no?  Bad choice. I had a pretty terrible cut of meat. I realize it 's the prix fixe menu, but don't you want to entice me to come back?  And the mac & cheese! This was, undoubtedly, the most horrifying mac & cheese that ever lived. A veritable affront to the entire genre. The sauce was all butter - no cheese. Even when salted to death it was just... bland, bad. Yick. My plate was eventually taken away about as full as it was when it was brought out.  Dessert, however, was delicious. We all went with the pumpkin cheesecake ('tis the season) and all absolutely loved it. If Kinzie were to morph into a dessert-only place, I'd be a huge fan.

The service was fine, with a gracious server, but the food was still incredibly slow, in spite of our server's apologies.  The atmosphere was classic and on the quiet side, and I couldn't complain.

2009-06-04,2.0,"We live in an absolute meat lovers paradise here in Chicago... you know it's true, we didn't get this heavy eating tofu now did we? With a different steakhouse on almost every corner downtown, the choices for the tastiest cuts are pretty much limitless, think about it: Gene & Georgetti's, Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Keefer's, Smith & Wollensky, Sullivan's, Chicago Chophouse, Gibson's.... shall I go on? I think I need not...  So, with this type of competition you really have to bring your meaty A-Game to the dinner table as there is much comparison to be had in the market. To be frank, I'm even a little surprised that Kinzie has managed to stay around as long as it has. Maybe I caught them on an off night? Perhaps the Merch Mart workers keep it plugging along happily as a convenient spot to hit up an alright business lunch? But for dinner? Blech! Two stars was the only way to go, 'I've experienced better', indeed.  The food was downright disappointing... almost all of it, with the standout exceptions being a plate of fried calamari and a chocolate molten cake, everything else screamed mediocre. Our starter of mussels - all lonely 8 of them - were nothing to write home about, low on taste and high on being plated sloppily, I'd pass on these in favor of bruschetta or anything else 10x over if dining here again. Bummer. The surf and turf (we should never have attempted this here) was even worse... an appallingly under-seasoned and tasteless cut of filet beside an even more sad and tragically overcooked lobster tail. It must be the blind leading the blind back in that kitchen, how is this even acceptable?? Everything has no flavor! The Super Sexy Bobby Flay School of Grill 101 teaches everyone within the sound of a tv that you ALWAYS and GENEROUSLY season a steak, and you NEVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE cook a lobster tail for more than 10 minutes. If I know this - and I'm not chef - how don't they? AMATEURS. That's how.  A side of wild mushroom risotto rounded out more of the same... blandness, blahness, blechness. Just downright boring Snoozeville. All of it.

So...I happened to come across Kinzie's corporate lunch menu, giving everyone their choice of salad, entree, and dessert for only $15.95.  And they didn't skimp on what was offered, either - offering ceasar salad, beef medallions, salmon, decadent chocolate cake, etc.  Hells ya - cheap enough so no one could bitch about the price, and since everyone made their own selections they couldn't bitch about the food, especially when their genius ass chose it.  So I set up everything w/ Fannie, the sales manager for their private events.  She answered every ridiculous question I had and was endlessly patient, at the last second giving us extra time to fax in our contract.   The lunch itself was great.  We were in their private dining room, which is absolutely gorgeous.  We had our own private place to hang coats and our own restroom - it just had everything right there.  The food was a hit - although I know a few people were not digging the chophouse salad.  Anyways, I thought the beef medallions were the shiznitz (and not skipped on at all portion wise) and the martinis tasted like liquid candy so I was happy.  Although next time I would hide the bill from the boss...I got some shit since he reviewed the bill and noticed they charged tax on the gratuity.",0.9433,0.759,0.145,0.095,0.5878667628667629

The menu is pretty basic: this is a steakhouse so look for appetizers, soups, salads and a stunning selection of steaks. I started with an impossibly wonderful Ahi tuna appetizer that came with a basket of homemade flour tortilla chips. If I hadn't been so loopy, I might have been able to accurately get the perfectly fine brunoise mixture onto the delicate chips. The tuna was perfectly seasoned and even though I was quite out of it, I remember it with my taste buds and still crave it. For the meat I ordered the bone-in Delmonico, medium rare. It was also perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked and perfectly huge. I noticed a family portion of creamed baby spinach leaves on the table, but did not try it. I had part of a warm martini to start but can only drink impossibly cold vodka martinis ... and a glass of Pinot Noir with the steak.  I was hell-bent on ordering dessert, which is not in the least bit typical, but there had been no birthday cake and I knew there was no ice cream in ... but after looking at the dessert menu crossed-eyed we both declined. The service, as I recall it, was very friendly and professional ... and fast. I remember saying ""Fastest steaks in the west"" when the steaks came out. They took no time at all.

We arrived on time for our reservation and were immediately given our choice of tables - dining room which was described as ""noisy"" or the ""quieter"" lounge area. We chose the dining room and it wasn't actually all that noisy. The crowd seemed to be a mix of locals and tourists. My 3 star review is based on the fact that there was nothing especially right or wrong with the Kinzie Chop House, it was just sort of ordinary. After being seated, our water glasses were promptly filled and menus were presented. I then had to ask for the wine list, and the response was ""You want a bottle??"" as though this was an unusual request. But the list was then brought promptly. The wine list is fiarly extensive, and I found several we would have enjoyed. The prices were neither high for Chicago or a bargain. After selection the bottle was brought promptly. We were then shown the tray of steaks, which were well described, including which ones could cook more and which needed to be more on the rare side (not a problem for us). After ordering, the starters were brought promply, and our choices of the baked goat cheese and a mushroom gorgonzola tart were both fine, although I can't say I tasted much gorgonzola in the tart. The only real lapse is that there was a fairly long gap between the starters and the main course, just enough that we were sort of looking around hopefully. The steaks were OK, properly cooked, but not terribly flavorable.  By the time I was halfway through my Kansas City Strip I was frankly tired of it. Not full, just tired. The sides were a mix of good and ordinary. The onion rings were great (although mysteriously served with Ketchup!), the Asparagus, which was a special, was fine, but the ""Bacon and Scalion Smashed Potatoes"" held no discernable bacon that we could identify, either by sight or taste. We skipped dessert, which seemed a bargain at $5.95, but nothing on the list, which read like a top 10 list of every formerly ""in"" dessert of the past 15 years, excited us. All in all, nothing terribly wrong, but I won't be back soon.",0.97,0.839,0.111,0.05,0.5552857142857144

2008-11-21,5.0,"Oh my steak. Came here last night for our 6 monthiversary and really enjoyed it. I had made reservations and they had asked if it was a ""special occasion"" so I said, ""yes, an anniversary!"".  The place had a typical steakhouse ambiance - somewhere in between a stuffy ""old school"" steak house and one of those ultra-modern steakhouses. (Also, the bathrooms were very nice.) Our waiter, Jason, was very good. Answered all our dumb questions about the different cuts of meat.  To start, I had a peartini (seriously pretty good!) and my gf had a glass of shiraz. I ordered the ""Kinzkie Cut"" (flat iron) and my gf ordered the Kansas City. We also shared two sides: The bacon&scallion smashed potatoes, and the creamed spinach parmesan. The food was brought out SO quickly! It must have been less than 10 minutes! The steaks were cooked to our liking and the sides were delicious. But then I tried my steak and it had the weirdest flavor. I am sure it's probably because I wasn't used to this cut of meat but it had a very bad aftertaste. I tried to take another few bites, but it just wasn't good. I tried some of my gf's Kansas City steak and that was delicious. I didn't want to be an annoying customer, so I didn't say anything when the waiter came over and asked how it was. However, the manager (Dan) must have seen my face when I was eating the steak and came over and asked if everything was OK. I finally broke down and told him I didn't like the taste and he immediately offered to bring me something different. I asked for the Kansas City and within a few minutes, he brought it out. SERIOUSLY AWESOME. I mean, that's excellent service. I did feel like a tool for sending something back, but it was so worth it - the KC steak was just what I had wanted and very delicious. For dessert, we split the Flourless Chocolate Cake, which they had decorated with a ""Happy Anniversary"" on the plate. Very cute. This was comped since it was our anniversary -- also pretty nice of them. All in all, it was a wonderful experience and I will go back again.",0.9937,0.752,0.174,0.073,0.6274133249791145

I've had countless lunches here pouring over fabrics, designs and layouts.  But last Saturday night- I finally had a chance to try the Kinzie Chop House for dinner, and it did not disappoint.  The place has been redone since I was here last. Cool, contemporary, with tones of brown and cream. The doors along Kinzie are open in nicer weather and there are a nice mix of booths and tables.  I got there late (darn that Eisenhower freeway!) but the staff was great in accommodating us to get in and out and still make our theater ""curtain up"" time.  A couple of their great martinis later and my time on the Ike was but a distant memory! We started with the mussels, which had to be some of the largest that I have had in a while. I stuck to my favorite cut of meat (NY strip) but my friend had the bone in Delmonico. While huge- the flavor was amazing.  Typical steakhouse sides included asparagus with hollandaise, and a loaded baked potato which they split for us in the kitchen. I liked the nuance that they put salsa on the potato in addition to the other standard toppings.  Our server was great (of course- it may of helped that we had a mutual friend). He moved us through in just about an hour without making us feel rushed. He also suggested a really nice and spicy Cab to go with our choices which was perfect.  While they do have valet parking- there is also a large parking garage just across Wells St and the El stop is nearby as well. I may always associate the Kinzie Chop House with lunch since that has been when most of my visits have taken place.

I don't eat steak and I can still say that.  I came here tonight with my family for a holiday dinner (since we are only all in the same area a couple times a year nowadays) and I have not one real complaint.    Nice bread basket to start with, and a good drink menu - wine glasses were reasonably priced (sister and I had different whites for $7 each, not too bad) and they had some tasty sounding martinis.  I had a sip of the banana concoction my mom ordered as well as the ""merchandise martini"" my dad ordered (he's a sucker for silly-named drinks apparently)- seemed pretty strong, which it better be at $9.50!  The bruschetta appetizer is a bit small- 3 pieces, so keep that in mind if everyone in your party wants to share.  Wish they had warned us about that when we ordered it.  We also ordered the fries and mashed potatoes as sides for the table- both were good, but with how filling the entrees were, I'm afraid I was too stuffed to care.  Apparently the steaks were awesome- my brother inhaled his prime rib in a matter of what could not have been more than 10 minutes, and the rest of the family was not far behind (two got prime rib, two got filets, and everyone seemed very happy).  I ordered a chicken dish with a lemon, white wine and butter sauce, which came with rice, and it was very very good- melt in your mouth good! A little on the salty side so if salty is not your thing, then I would advise staying away from this one but there were lots of non-steak options to try. Our waiter was very attentive (but not in your face, he showed up with perfect timing it seemed) and knowledgable (they bring out samples of the different cuts of steak so you can get a good picture of each), and oddly the restaurant was not at all crowded- I made a reservation for 5 people at 6:30 but we showed up very early and were seated immediately anyway, and could have easily gotten there at 7 or later and had no problem.  Very strange when a few other places I had thought to go were booked up (Scoozi and Adobo Grill).  Granted this was a Wednesday night, but still, when other restaurants are filled to the brim, I was very surprised this wasn't.  They have very cozy booths for larger groups and the whole restaurant has a very warm and welcoming feel to it, almost like a home dining room.  I would highly recommend checking this place out for a very solid dining experience, even if you are not a steak fan!",0.9952,0.804,0.161,0.035,0.6020068027210884
