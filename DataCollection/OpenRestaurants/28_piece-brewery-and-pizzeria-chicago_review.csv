The white sauce or ""New Haven"" style is out of this world!. For Native Chicagoan and tourist this is the spot to try to get away from overhyped deep dish pizza Chicago is popular for. I recommend ordering it with Mash potatoes as a topping and the once now closed ""Hot Doug""s brand atomic sausage if you like to try spicy. You can also do classic Anchovies which is a rarity for pizza places that are franchised. I also recommend to try their beer brewery which it is also known for. If you are with a big group the large pizza will be more than enough. If you do carryout I do suggest you make sure your friend's and family will be coming over since this pizza is served best hot and fresh from the oven. I did carry out which is why I say this and which is why I cannot give it a perfect 5 stars because of the quality when NOT eaten right away. It is still great pizza for 4 stars! Also try their Chocolate Pizza as well as the Barbecue Pizza if you are adventurous or a risk taker! I have tried the Chocolate Pizza and was amazed at the dessert pizza.

We got to the brewery/pizzeria around 5:30PM to discover that this place was packed! We had around a 30 minute wait (which I thought was decent considering how many people were here and the size of our party), so we preoccupied ourselves by going to the bar first. I grabbed a golden arm, which I thought was a solid lager. I also tried one of the pale ales (can't remember which one...), and it was solid, surprisingly (I'm not normally a fan of them).  Once we got seated, we had the big task of deciding what to order. Our waitress was friendly and provided options that she said were popular choices to order. We ended up getting 2 large pizzas: one with red sauce, onions, green peppers, chicken, and jalapenos, and the other with white sauce, mashed potatoes, spinach, clams, and broccoli. The white was definitely my favorite, but both were great!  Giant pizzas, delicious flavors, great beer, great ambiance! I'm a fan!

2017-08-11,2.0,"I've been here a couple of times, and the #1 complaint I have is that if you come here at a slow time, they will seat you RIGHT NEXT TO another party. No one wants to sit right next to strangers in a restaurant during a quiet time where everyone can overhear everything being said. This especially applies if the party next to you has kids. I can understand not wanting to have customers spread to every corner of the restaurant, but to make them sit together like a family dinner is ridiculous.

There were several times when I went in here thinking it was going to be awesome because of how packed it was.

I mean I get it if you make a mistake or your draft line isn't pouring properly I understand but come on clean my glass off or at least give me some napkins. We get seated about 15 minutes later and we order a pizza. The server was a total asshole. She must hate her life or someone must've given her a shitty tip or who knows what her deal was but she was rude no ""hi"" no have u ""been here before"", just a ""are you ready? What do you want"" damnnnn sorry for the inconvenience lmao she took our order and went about her way.  She comes back with plates and forks and just throws them on the table. Ok somebody is having a bad day. Whatever, we wait for our pizza and she comes back again with a stand doesn't say anything just plops it on the table bumps our beers and walks away. This lady was mad at the world. We didn't let it get to us and again waited for our pizza, pizza comes she brings cheese, red pepper, and something else either pepper or oregano not sure because I didn't use it. Anyways I try to sprinkle the cheese and it's empty. Wth?! lol why did you even bring it. The service sucked! We got a medium pizza half pepperoni and half meatball and giardinera.  The pizza was tasty but again nothing super special. The meatball didn't even seem like meatball more like ground Tiny pieces of taco meat.  Oh and the waitress stated that we will be charged the full price of all toppings even though we only put it on half. I just laughed at her. I've never had that addressed. Like duh I get it any additional topping is extra. Maybe this is why she was so disgruntled , she deals with a bunch of idiots all day. Nonetheless the pizza was tasty. Overall I think people talk this place up too much. It's all hype. The service sucked and the pizza was alright.

2017-07-01,4.0,"Some of the best pizza in the city!! I'm a thin-crust junkie, and this style of pizza was new to me, but New Haven: you are doing something right!! The first time I tried Piece was delivery. It was decent delivery time, considering we were in Wicker Park during the  Do Division street fest. Fantastic! Pizza was hot; I love the crust, it's chewy and thin with a crispy outer ring. Good ratio! They don't overdo it on sauce which is a big plus for that style of crust. Their toppings are excellent! They have fantastic sausage.  Second trip here was dine-in. Yes, the wait for a table can be long. We had a group of about 8, and we waited nearly an hour, but it was a Friday night, and we were able to congregate by the bar. They do have a decent beer selection. I wouldn't call it the highlight of their establishment, but it's a nice partner in crime for their pizza. We ordered a couple pizzas, including the speciality Honey Butter fried chicken pizza, which is outstanding!!! I never thought I'd enjoy fried chicken on a pizza, but they handle the toppings masterfully, including a well-balanced sauce on top, and they skip the red sauce. Excellent mashup between two great restaurants. We also tried a white pizza with meatballs, and ordered dipping sauce with it. Also really tasty, and a nice lighter contrast to the Honey Butter pizza. Not sure why some people aren't crazy about how they serve their pizza; it does come out on metal, industrial-like trays, but it's a perfect way to serve a huge pizza, and it gives Piece a signature touch for their presentation.  Only gripe is the price per topping. $3 for each meat can add up big time on a tab.  Great pizza...well-done for the pizza purist palate, and for their extremely creative collaborations with other Chicago establishments.

I really don't understand the hype of this place.  The pizza was lacking sauce so much that I had to ask for a side of dipping sauce.  The crust was really thin, almost to the point of it being a cardboard.  It had this weird taste to it that I couldn't pinpoint so I don't know if it was the bread, sauce, or toppings.

They aren't messing around when they say large, the pizzas came out on huge industrial size baking trays. As for the taste, it was fine, not anything special. Kind of reminded me of Domino's, tbh. However, my main complaint would be the way that it was cut seemed very careless. Some pieces were so thinly sliced while others were way too big to fit onto the plate. Service was lacking.

My five coworkers and I arrived around 8pm on a Sunday and had no problem getting a table. They have screens showing a variety of sports all over the walls; the TVs are so loud that one has to shout in order to communicate with the person adjacent. Our server was an entertaining down-to-earth Michigan man who kept things real; I was able to mildly charm him with a ""Go Redwings!"" exclamation.  At the suggestion of our ex-Chicago resident coworker, we ordered the Hot Doug's pizza. Apparently Hot Doug's was a big deal back when he had a hot dog stand, and now that that's closed his slightly spicy dogs are available only in a couple select locations and even more of a treat. When they are first served on the giant rectangular trays, the pizzas were so hot that the toppings slid cleanly off when one tried to slip out a piece onto a plate, so I would wait a few moments for the pies to cool for enhanced structural integrity, if you can exercise the self-restraint. We also ordered a normal pepperoni pizza, and the two pies coupled with beers satisfied us six eaters. I personally liked that their pizzas were rather light on the cheese and allowed the tanginess of the tomato sauce to shine.

Things that piece has going for it are their pizza sizes(if you get an xtra large, expect a behemoth that is easily going to feed 4-5), their atmosphere(large friendly place with plenty of beer an other CNS depressants for the soul), and some of their more interesting toppings, New Havens inspired or not(I'm looking at you, clams and hot doug's sausage). The pizzas taste fine though I would have wished that the crust was a bit crispier upon arrival; took leftovers home and baked them in the oven until they were perfect. As for the order, your best bet is definitely a large which can serve quite a few; just be wary that as you pile toppings on, it can get pricier(as veggies start at $2 each but meats at $3).

The staff is always nice and friendly, the beers are great (Golden Arm is my personal favorite light and crisp). The white pizza is super garlicy and yummy and the red pizza is a classic.

We were seated with only 3 people.  We shared a large garlic, fresh basil, and sausage pizza with red sauce. Overall, it was a delicious pizza but nothing life changing.  The red sauce had a lot of flavor. I could also taste the garlic which wasn't overpowering. I may have had too high of expectations with this place because of all the hype though.  Our table had 4 girls and 1 guy. For us, the large was the perfect size. However, if you have more males or people that can eat a lot in your party, you may want to size up. Keep in mind that we didn't order any apps just beer.  The restaurant was noticeably busier as we were leaving around 8 pm. Good pizza but I probably won't go out of my way to come back.",0.962,0.873,0.127,0.0,0.46131868131868126

The lunch individual pizza was very tasty but the crust was almost impossible to cut and near the edges it was not crispy but chewy. You'd think that a place this popular would have figured out how to prepare a good pizza crust. Second, although we arrived when the place was nearly empty and were seated at a table in a long row of empty tables, when another couple arrived with their child the hostess seated them right next to us even though there were probably 15 - 20 empty tables nearby. Although the child was well-behaved and we weren't disturbed by the family, our ability to have any sort of private conversation was severely restricted. This family could have easily been seated a couple of tables away since even as we left, the place was only half filled.

2017-04-07,5.0,"When people think of pizza, they typically think of two cities: NYC and Chicago. New Haven, CT needs to be put right on the same level. And it's amazing that I can get that style of pizza in the Midwest. Take note Chicago. This is how you do a thin crust pizza. It's not cut into little dinky squares. It doesn't have the toppings buried under the cheese.  I like that the pizzas aren't shaped in a perfect circle. They're more like oblong ovals that are cut into randomly sized triangular slices. The crust has a great crispness on it with just a tiny hint of chew. Personally, the ideal crust for me is crispy all the way to the bottom and also chewy and crunchy on the outside. The only thing I would want done differently is a touch more chew on the crust. I have two combos that I go to. One is the red pics with chicken and sauteed mushrooms. I don't know what they do with these mushrooms but they are packed with flavor. And the chicken doesn't dry out, which is always a risk when it's on a pizza.  But then there's what I call the New Haven special. The white pizza, with no sauce, topped with mozzarella, bacon, clams, and roasted peppers. At first thought, this might seem like a crazy combination. But the combination of bacon and roasted peppers provides that perfect combination of sweet and salty. They load the pizza up with clams, they definitely don't skimp on them either. And it's the only pizza I've ever seen served with lemon wedges. A little lemon, and plenty of Parmesan and crushed red pepper, and I'm ready to go. The small pizza is supposed to feed 1-2 people, but I have no problem taking one of these down by myself. I wish they would expand into the suburbs. There's really no other place to get pizza like this outside of the Northeast and that makes me feel sorry for the rest of the country.",0.8784,0.807,0.114,0.078,0.5422113997113996

2017-02-18,2.0,"I was here for dinner tonight, and I don't think I'll be back.  Here's the thing: the pizza was good, even great. We got a large, half sausage/mashed potato (delicious) and half bacon/clam (also amazing). Easily large enough to feed four.  The service, however, was seriously lacking. Our server didn't make eye contact with any of us once, and barely looked at us. Hand waving was involved when we had a question. And, at the end of the meal, we got a check that made absolutely no sense to us.  The large pizza was listed as $18.49 on the takeout menu that we grabbed off the front desk, which also happened to be the one that we ordered off of. The actual menu listed it as $19.49 - minor difference, but frankly kind of misleading.  We were also charged $3 for each of our four toppings - even though we only got half of each. This wasn't written anywhere on the menu, and no one mentioned it to us during the ordering process or when we specifically asked about half toppings. Really frustrating - we ended up speaking to the manager about it, and he took $6 off our bill, but between that and the frankly subpar service, the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth. Not how I want to leave after having a great pizza dinner, and the reason I probably won't be back.",-0.8159,0.847,0.062,0.091,0.4725274725274725

2017-02-07,3.0,"I've heard so many good things about Piece and when the opportunity rose, I took it. I've heard people say that it's the best pizza in Chicago, eh, let's not go that far. It's definitely different, in a good way. My friend and I had the goat cheese - goat cheese baked in marinara served with bread. Wow, we had to get more bread because there was just too much sauce! A dollar extra for bread, that's kind of annoying, the ratio should be equal! Also, quick tip, they should try mixing the ball of goat cheese in there and bring it to the table ready to spread or just a thicker dip. I must say, I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese but that appetizer was DELICIOUS! After, we shared the Hot Dougs Atomic Pizza and a white pizza. The Atomic was good but I felt that it lacked cheese. Maybe that's their style, but I need lots of cheese in my life. It was nice and spicy though.  My favorite was the white pizza with mashed potato and bacon, I've never I'm my life have had mashed potatoes on my pizza. It was delicious and would get it again. Bacon and little dollops of potatoes that get chewy in the oven yum! The one thing that bothered me is that I got charged $2.50 for a side of giardiniera, I think the waiter should have mentioned a charge.  I understand it might be a topping but I only wanted a small side.  Moving on. We got dessert, yup, even though we didn't finish half of the pizzas we got the chocolate chip cookie with ice cream. It was just ok.

We've been coming here for YEARS (sadly, we've never bumped into any of the cool rockers that periodically show up, like Dave Grohl!) And have had our fair share of amazing beer, salads, pizza, apps, and even dessert, so I'll let it slide. This last time I was joined by the hubs and two friends and we had a smorgasbord of eats, including: Goat cheese appetizer: holy amazing. Hot, creamy goat cheese in a tomatoey sauce with lots of toasty bread for dipping (more if you ask nicely!) this appetizer is a perfect size and completely tasty. Piece salad: my fave. Candied nuts, cranberries, a ridiculously good dressing and fresh crisp greens. Cesar salad: a classic, but done right. Even comes with anchovies, making for a salty, traditional delight. Pizza: we got two and had ample leftovers. One was a classic pie with red sauce, sausage and pepperoni. It was a cheesy, gooey wonder, not too much sauce, not too thin a crust. Perfect. We also got the Honey Butter Fried Chicken pizza. I was skeptical because the ingredient list was zany and I usually can't handle any kind of spice, but this was great. A little zip from the hot sauce but not intolerable, crispy fried chicken, my only complaint about this white pizza adventure is that it was heavy on the garlic - full of flavor, but a smidge overpowering. Dessert: we pressed on through that feast and ordered a dessert pizza, oozing with chocolate, hazelnut, and creamy mascarpone cheese, this was devoured in minutes. The lightness of the crust and the freshness of the mascarpone brought an overall lightness to what should have felt like a chocolate brick in our overstuffed bellies. All of this plus five or six beers was just over $100, which, while not your standard carry out pizza joint prices, is really not at all terrible for the mountains of food we enjoyed. Piece is one of those fun, cool but not too cool, popular, magical places that quickly became a Wicker Park staple and will ultimately be known as a Chicago tradition, I'm certain.

Pizzas come in three sizes and two different styles.  I wanted to try a red pizza (red sauce, mozzarella, and your toppings, obviously) and white pizza (parmesan, mozzarella, garlic, olive oil, and whatever toppings you want), so we ordered 1 of each in a small.  A small feeds 1-2 people, but we also ordered an appetizer and had a lot of pizza leftover to take home. The pizza was really good.  The waiter suggested we try the white pizza with mashed potato and bacon toppings.  What?!  Yeah.  So good.  The mashed potato is served in dollops, not spread on the whole pizza, so it wasn't overwhelming.  I highly recommend you try this!  If not, even a plain white pizza probably tastes heavenly. For our red pizza, we ordered the Hot Doug's Atomic sausage.  The sausage was spicy, but not too spicy, but we both agreed that the pizza needed more cheese!  It was also a little too soggy for me. The crust is so good that I don't think you can really go wrong with any variety of pizza or toppings here.  This thin crust style was crispy in all the right places. We ordered the baked goat cheese appetizer, a ball of creamy goat cheese floating in a bath of marinara sauce, and served with bread.  It was good, but I would have liked it more if the cheese were incorporated with the sauce or just easier to spread.  We also did not have enough bread.  We did ask for more, but they charged us another $1.  In the grand scheme of things, it's just a dollar...but we wanted to finish that cheese.  Long story short, just order pizza and wait for that! Somehow we managed to cram ice cream in our mouths too.  The ice cream sundae is served with two chocolate chip cookies and just the right amount  for two people to share. There's a good variety of beer on draft and in bottles.  Bottled beers are a little pricey, most averaging $8-10, although that didn't stop me from having a Delirium Tremens and a German cider that I'd never heard of before. Service was good.  It was busy on a Wednesday night but I didn't feel that the service was slow.  Some of the tables are communal-style, so get there early or during off-peak hours if you're with a large group or don't like being around people.  Our pizza took up enough room that I barely noticed there were other people at the end of the table.  Our server also made an excellent recommendation on that pizza and deserves credit where credit is due!",0.9956,0.835,0.137,0.028,0.46218658892128284

The pizza sizes are extreme. A large is not a normal large, just a head's up. It's an entire pan. My brother didn't know that when he got there before me and ordered 2 large pizzas for 3 people... oops. We tried an apple bacon pizza and a sausage, pepper, onion. The classic was good. Being in Chicago, you can find better, but I'm not complaining. The apple bacon was very different and really delicious but I don't think it's something I could eat a lot of. The prices are reasonable and it's located next to the Damen stop, so it's a good spot to be in.

They do not have ranch here (or pineapples) but you can get mashed potatoes on your pizza. We ordered two different pies, a medium with half pepperoni and goat cheese, half sausage, and a large with sausage and green pepper. The goat cheese on the pizza was pretty much non-existent and when you're charging $5 for a topping, I should be able to make it out. Neither of the pizzas were cut through. It was a mess trying to get our slices, and as soon as you try to pick one up the bottom is so soft and flimsy it completely fell apart. No one was too friendly working there and we were planning on getting some desserts, but after waiting so long to find our waiter, we decided to just get the check and head out.

We ordered two smalls (Serves 1-2), one white, and one decked out with meat and some veggies. The portions are actually quite large. I questioned whether or not we should get a medium and a small to make sure everyone was full. These two smalls were more than enough for three hungry pizza lovers.  Both pizzas were fantastic.

2016-09-28,2.0,"I was genuinely looking forward to eating at Piece, but the experience was such a letdown. I am not even sure which was worse: the dirty restaurant, or the tasteless, lukewarm pizza It was funny because just before I walked into the restaurant, my enthusiasm high, someone mentioned ""The Real World"" filmed across the street, and two of the cast members were employed by Piece. I was intrigued by the connection, as I loved watching ""The Real World"" in college, and admired Piece for being involved with what was then a groundbreaking production. That excitement quickly waned, as I learned that they fired the employees two days later because the community put up such a stink about ""Te Real World"" filming in Wicker Park. I could not help but see the hypocrisy in that situation. But that was then, and we are talking about present day. Unfortunately, I have very little positive to say about the present day either. Sitting at the table, waiting for the food and drinks to arrive, I could not help but notice the dust caked on the rafters, wires, ductwork, and sound equipment. It was actually disgusting. If you are not going to clean the area above patrons' heads, then you should drywall the ceiling. We ordered the New Haven pizza, which is apparently one of the restaurant's specialties because the owners spent some time in Connecticut and fell in love with this particular pizza style. The pizza itself was barely warm when it arrived, and I actually had a hard time eating it because the crust tasted so much like cardboard. That was the sentiment around the table. Not one of the six of us would return to Piece, because the experience was so totally average in terms of taste. The same went for the beers. Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing, but the beer was perhaps one step above a Miller Lite. Personally, I think that there are better pizza places in Chicago, and I'm willing to drive elsewhere for a clean restaurant, and actually tasty pizza",0.2535,0.779,0.108,0.113,0.4756878306878306

My day was long. Time to show Yelp some love while unwinding with a Piece pizza to die for.  Breweries are either hipster havens, or sanctuaries for sports fans to yell at tv screens without judgment. Had it not been for the fact that my coworkers were ordering pizza on weekends which were a cause for celebration of some kind, I would have never set one foot into this institution which caters to crowds that annoy me. On this evening, I had a personal celebration of my own and picked up a pizza that didn't require me to be mindful of others feasting on it.   No matter who you are, it doesn't mean you don't know what's good when it comes to food. Piece broke my white-pizza cherry, and honestly I have dreams about eating it naked on my couch. With nothing but black olives, mushrooms, spinach, and onions, it's everything. Three things stand out for me: the crust, the parmesan, and the butter/olive oil they're using. Some restaurants get you started with a baguette where you drag a slice over nothing but a plate of olive oil and parmesan. Yeah, it's like that, only better. If you're one of those people who hates black olives, we can't be friends. I had to pick up my order from the ""Piece Out"" entrance and I walked into some of the sweetest hairy men working behind the counter. I was already feeling better from helping a few kids jump their car on the very-busy North Avenue just outside.

The crust is a key factor with all pizza because if there is any sogginess, the overall integrity of the finished product is compromised. Piece has a wonderful, crunchy, crispy, chewy and textured pizza crust. This is the best thin crust I have had in a long while. If you choose your own toppings, keep in mind to balance your toppings accordingly to ensure the best flavor and moisture balance so that the crust is not compromised. Hubby and I opted to order two different pizzas to try out two flavor profiles. 1st pizza: Red pizza w/ mushroom, black olives, 1/2 anchovies, 1/2 sausage. 2nd pizza: Red pizza w/pepperoni, spinach, goat cheese and giardiniera. Both were great but my red pizza w/pepperoni, spinach, goat cheese and giardiniera was the clear balanced flavor profile winner..totally awesome and uberlicious.

It's very difficult. You're a pizza place for goodness sake.  My girlfriend wanted her Bloody Mary made spicy but got a deer in the headlights look instead. We were given a bottle of tobasco and a dish of horseradish so we could make it ourselves! Pretty odd feeling having to make your own cocktail at ur table when paying premium price.  The whole process was drawn out and slow with the feeling of inconveniencing them. The place does look very nice and modern and has potential to be a great spot but the service will need to improve significantly before I will go back or recommend my network to eat there.",0.9694,0.763,0.167,0.07,0.7107894736842106

I tried a white sauce pizza with onions, sausage and Giardano peppers (Italian hot peppers) and also a plain cheese with red sauce. Also, I had their Egyptian style IPA (Camel Toe - yup that's what it's called).  First the beer: One of my favorite IPAs. And an in house brews. Impressive. Not overly hoppy and has a warm malty taste that resembles a red.  Pizza: Both were the thin crust (new haven style). The plain cheese was very good but the white with the toppings was awesome. No doubt, the best thin crust I've had thus far. The sausage and pepper combo was ridiculously good - savory, with a little heat. The place (inside and out) reminded me of an old school pizzeria. Clean but not pretentious. Also lots of TVs blaring sports. Service was friendly and efficient.

Again, same thing. It's whatever. I love the atmosphere, waitstaff was great: fast and smiley. But- The pizza was super thin and greasy. We got the specialty red pizza with the Doug's atomic Sausage. It had a kick to it that wasn't too overpowering, but again the pizza just wasn't the ever-so-awesome-must-go-to-this-place-now pizza. It was incredibly thin and greasy too. It was so thin you couldn't pick it up with your fork because you literally couldn't grab on to anything and your fork would just hit your plate below. It reminded me of pizza you got when you were a little kid at some random fun-zone place party. Like you never knew where it came from, it just showed up greasy, thin, and you would scarf it down and never think twice about it. We also got the tomato and spinach dip app. One of my faves, but here not so much. The chips were like 'bagel' chips and they were just not very flavorful and were plain. I also didn't think they were good for the dip because the chips themselves would actually retract the cheese....wow I'm so fat. Idk guys...

The couple didn't want to wait any longer and confirm to give their table to me. Great! Another 15 minutes and nothing .... Left the place and went to another spot nearby.

The pizza was so very light, fresh and delicious. The crust was so impressive and I can sometimes live without crust but not here. It was a lovely mix of crispy on the outside but a nice chew on the inside. The location is quite large and for the weather being so brisk, I truly enjoyed the bottle cove we shared with our large group and the huge opened window letting the breeze in. Even though they were packed for the evening, service was pretty quick and the bartenders were so nice!  They brew all their beer in house but no bottling so this is the only spot to enjoy. However, I'm not a beer girl so I went with wine and enjoyed it with their pizza pies!  I would highly recommend this location for delicious, fresh pizza.",0.9976,0.635,0.352,0.013,0.6849867724867725

We shared the Caesar salad, which was good, even though can you really mess that up? We (3 girls) split a medium pizza and we had about 2 pieces left if you're wondering about the portions! No complaints on the pizza. The interiors, bar and cute boys watching the NFL draft were the real winners though...

Being a fan of both, I just had to check what was Piece was about. My dad was craving pizza and wanted to stay in the suburbs for basic pizza. I convinced him to drive out to the city so we could try something new and it was worth it! There was plenty of parking on the street (yay!) since we got there about 10 minutes before it opened. There was no wait (double yay!), service was excellent, and the food took like 20 minutes before it came to our table. The space was huge (not cramped and little like other popular Chicago pizza joints) and I liked how there was a Transformers arcade game haha.  As for the menu, the beer list looked great but I wanted to save my appetite for the pizza. The pizza menu is short and straightforward. You can order red, plain, or white (corresponding to the sauce on the pizza) and order toppings for $2 each. My dad and I decided on the Hot Doug's Atomic Pizza, which had pepper jack cheese and Hot Doug's Atomic sausage which was a little bit spicy but had a nice kick to it. We ordered the large ($25) which is good for 3-5 people and the pizza was HUGE! We were laughing like little kids because we were so surprised at how big the pizza was. Surprisingly, my dad and I killed half the pizza! I love Chicago pizza but I'm getting tired of the deep dish. I'm so glad this place has great thin crust pizza!

We told him what we wanted but they didn't have it. He walked away and didn't come back and we had to wait for someone else-not cool.  But our waitress was really nice and attentive although we had extra shitty seating in the far back corner right next to the restrooms-Ick. This was the first time sitting in a table instead of a booth and I hated it. It's super loud so you have to scream when you're talking and you are arm in arm to the next table. I was pretty annoyed getting eavesdropped on as well as being the unintentional eavesdropper. Our pizza took forever to come out what seemed like over 40 minutes and it def wasn't as good this time. The cheese was dry and the toppings were just okay. I think it was a combination of the toppings we chose and it not being cooked so great. Still ate it. It was really the crust that had us like whoa it got to a point towards the end where I just started eating the crust and bread only. Don't judge.

The vibe of this place was my favorite part.  They have their own brews (obviously) and the staff was able to recommend their own brews based on mainstream beers I liked.  The windows were open and we sat right in the front and really felt the young night life of the neighborhood.  Rustic dive bar-y feel and great for groups.

2016-03-16,4.0,"Piece is SO GREAT.  Okay so -- honestly, you could probably find a better basic pizza somewhere else. Their pizza alone isn't anything special. If you're looking for cheese and tomato sauce alone, maybe go elsewhere. However, once you start getting creative with the toppings, you'll find that Piece is a place you keep coming back to. Not only do they have an amazing selection of creative toppings, said toppings are high-quality, fresh tasting, and served in copious amounts on your pizza. My must get? A white pizza with mashed potatoes on top (plus garlic, spinach, and sausage). Weird? Yes. Amazing? Also yes. Further, they do white pizza really dang well, with no shortage on the flavor.  Another favorite is the Hot Doug's atomic pizza, which is a semi-recent addition that is super spicy, saucy, and delicious. I think it's a must-get, especially if you're just visiting Chicago and want to take your taste buds on a tour of the best that Chi has to offer. They took the greatest sausage at Doug's (the atomic! Spicy! Cheesy!) and turned it into one of the greatest pizzas you'll ever have. Furthermore, the pizzas they serve are HUGE. A medium is more than enough for three people and served on a cookie sheet like a delicious, savory pizza cookie. The presentation is fun and the food is filling.  If delicious pizza wasn't enough, they also brew their own beer and they do a great job at it. My favorites include the Dunkelweizen and the Hefeweizen, but if you're not into wheat beer they have an amazing selection. The service is never amazing, but that's because Piece is always jam packed with people. I've never had a bad server -- I've just also never had a server who was super attentive. And I don't care...it's the pizza - crispy, thin, and expertly topped - that I'm coming for. You can guarantee an awesome time here.

For toppings I got spinach, sauteed mushrooms, and black olives which was a pretty killer combination!! I was pretty impressed by how much they loaded on the toppings - especially the mushrooms too. However, I think because they loaded on the toppings and the crust was so thin, it made the crust super soggy after 10 minutes which then made the whole pizza hard to pick up and eat. The small is perfect for two people to share.  It's a pretty large space inside but it will get quite crowded, especially on a Friday night after 6:30.

Not as well curated collection as they seem to feel but such is the hipster bar program culture of Chicago. Yes, you can get a beer or cocktail but don't expect to get the brands you have come to enjoy, they likely have picked a few that you would rather not try and have priced them so you won't really want to pay for another round.  Lazy and not customer service focused is my impression driving me to take my time to share my thoughts.  Pie slice is still a common order , you know when a pizza is cut into something that looks like a Trivial Pursuit game piece with equal areas... at Piece you get the creativity of .5 inch slices , 1.5 inch slices, 4 inch slices and you see the pattern , no focus or concern of how lazy action may impact a customer's experience.. same thing if you get square cut- no two slices similar -- very creative staff I presume.  oh and they are either technophobes or just getting one over on me because their app crashes. I forgot why I uninstalled it.. well, because you waste your time to install it create an order and then ---- crash. And the last irksome issue is that adding a topping costs the same for half the pizza or the whole thing. just seems wrong to me.        So if you want to wait an hour+ to get your order, likely only get one drink in that time because apparently ice will tied you over, and have a pretty tasty $30+ pizza.. enjoy Piece.",0.6653,0.74,0.13,0.129,0.4993589743589744

2016-02-21,5.0,"pizza. (5/5) - thin crust, ny style. beer. (5/5) - brew their own beer, also has non-beer like drinks for us non beer drinkers! atmosphere. (5/5)  - cool space in hipster town (aka wicker park) this place came highly recommended by a friend, basically a chicago-native, and yelp, so i decided to give this place a try (even though me and my friends were dying for something healthy from eating everything in site on this chicago trip).. but OH BOY we were NOT disappointed!  Things to get: PIZZA. specifically, i recommend the lunch special. unless you're here with a group of people (group = 4 or more people) because the pizzas we saw come out for our neighbors were GINORMOUS.  the tricks to ordering the individual lunch pizzas are 2:  1. you can order any topping from the first page on your lunch pizza! so its not just limited to whats under the lunch pizza topping portion. HINT: get the hot doug's sausage. SO GOOD. for those of you that dont know what hot doug's is, its a famous hot dog shop that closed down unfortunately last year but i guess his sausage's are still in tact!  2. you get 3 toppings max, and the price increases by $1 each time you add on a topping. it starts off at $7.95. theres nothing much else to say about the pizzas because i want you to try them. they're SO GOOD. like, legit. ny style. crunchy. delicious. hot. steaming. marina-y. cheesy. full of toppings, delicious, pizzas. yes the toppings are expensive BUT they give you your monies worth. i would say the individual pizzas are a good sized portion for one person (if you are not a hungry boy).  APPS: we actually ordered the GOAT CHEESE marina sauce dip app. OMGASM. if you're looking for an app to share with friends, DEFINITELY get this one. the bowl of marinara goat cheese is ALOT, and the bread toast that comes out is unlimited-refilled by your waiter, so i definitely recommend that. (I hate it when they only give you enough chips/bread for your order and charge u extra for another round)  drinks: it was february, they didnt have the camel toe that yelp raved so much about. :( so i ordered the GRAPEFRUIT BEER. i asked the lady if there was any beer taste to it (I hate beer) and she said no, and hence thats why i ordered it. unfortunately for me, im very sensitive so i actually could taste the beer tastes but besides the fact-it was actually pretty good for a beer. so if you are wanting to drink something and u dont want to get a beer, i would recommend this one. They also had a david bowie beer (9% IPA) that they brewed the day bowie died. my friend rly rly enjoyed this one! Also, make sure to grab a pint glass souvenior on your way out! its only $4!!!! so cheap. and its super cutes.  ATMOSPHERE: this is such a cool space! its great for watching games, its great for catching up with friends, its great for eating with fam, its great for out of towners, its great for beer lovers, etc. there was no wait for us when we arrived on a saturday mornin around 12 noon. but it definitely DID fill up around the time we were leaving which was around 130-2.  PRO: they asked us if they could take our luggages and store them for us behind the front counter while we ate. I dont know many other places that do that for travelers, so EXTRA STAR if i could give it to them. when i was leaving, i saw that all of the baby strollers were also stored back there too, so it was rly nice.  highly recommended!",0.9991,0.732,0.219,0.05,0.6136377635631368

Because, to be honest, Piece pizza tastes the BEST when it's straight out of the oven (duh).. and kind of disappointing when you bring it home and reheat it. I find that it tends to get soggier than other pizza since the crust is so thin. Scratching your head for a combo? Red + sausage, green pepper, onion. Plain + jalapeños and mushrooms. I once heard the party next to us order a clam pizza. The world is really your oyster. This place is so busy during the weekend. Make sure to come at odd hours or right before the rush!

We ended up ordering a pizza with red sauce and light parmesan cheese on top, with spinach and tomato. I really liked that they have two options for cheesing -- one is the traditional mozz and parm blend, and one is parm only. I am an avid cheese consumer, but sometimes pizza can go overboard with the cheese topping so I was glad to have this option. I really liked the crust here! Thinner and kind of chewy. Also, the portions are HUGE! We shared a large caesar salad, and that could have been our meal. If you are getting pizza AND salad, just get the small and share it. The medium pizza was easily enough for 3-4 people, especially if you get something else with it.  The beers here seem to be pretty solid, and they have a nice selection.

Once we were able to flag down a server, ours was very helpful and checked in throughout our meal. Prior to this blessed event, however, we definitely found ourselves doing the awkward ""Gah! Where do I stand?"" dance.  Super busy even on Tuesday night at 8 (Granted, we're talking the Tuesday before Christmas, soo...). Worth noting that even on a busy night, crowds thinned out by 8:30. The food itself was very good. We had the chips and salsa (The salsa was basically diced tomatoes and was fabulousity in a dish with minimum salsa runniness and maximum flavor). The flavors in the Piece Mixed Green Salad came together perfectly (although you may want to be wary if you're in the early stages of dating or hoping for a make out afterward as the onion comes across VERY strong). We got a medium pizza, designed to serve 2-3 and I'd say it's more on the 3-4 side (or 2-3 very hungry people). They are kind enough to split pies, so we had green olive and garlic on one side for the mister and Atomic Sausage and pepperoni on the other for myself (red sauce and mozzarella version). Solid thin crust pie packed with flavor. Do it!!! I'm not the hugest beer fanatic, but I did sample the Heavy Bag and the Swingin' Single. Both had very different but equally unique and tasty flavors. The former was almost like eating dark chocolate and the latter has a great citrus punch. If you're not sure what to order, the bar tenders are great about offering samples (on request). We tried one and then another (after a passionate bar tender recommended it) before settling on a growler of Top Heavy Hefeweizen to go.

The problem here is that while Piece is definitely a worthwhile place to check out, it is by no means a go-to destination in comparison to its competitors.

2015-09-25,4.0,"Holy amazeballs! We stopped in for dinner last Saturday around 6pm and waited roughly 50 minutes to eat at this place, and it was so worth it! We ordered two medium pizzas, one white with spinach and one red with bacon. We were actually surprised by how big the medium pizzas were, yet the three of us (me, my husband, his friend) devoured them. The pizza was seriously the best I've ever had. I was full and just kept on eating. 10 stars for the pizza for sure!  The cons deducting 6 stars... Our table was next to the bar so the people standing around waiting for their table were pressed up against our table as we ate. We shared a table with another group of three, and four pizzas on a skinny table seemed a big problematic - I almost knocked my drink over because there wasn't enough room to use a plate and drink from a glass. The waitress pretty much only came around once every 20 minutes. The beer I wanted to try (Top Heavy Hefeweizen) wasn't available so I settled for two other brews (Light n' Curvy and Golden Arm) and honestly wasn't too impressed by them. The place was super crowded (fire hazard?) and as loud as a Wrigleyville bar would be at 2am on a Friday.

My roommate and I went on a Saturday night around 8 pm and were quoted a 40 min wait for a table. This place is very busy, fair warning, so be prepared to wait especially if you have a larger group. We ended up snagging two seats at the bar rather quickly and decided just to order our food there. Great decision! Got our pizza way faster that way. Sadly, I never got a chance to visit Hot Doug's while it was still open so I was psyched to order the Hot Doug's Atomic Sausage pizza at Piece. AMAZING! Doug's spicy atomic sausage with pepperjack cheese and caramelized onion with red sauce. A lot of flavor, great amount of zip in every bite. My roommate and I devoured a medium like a pack of starving hyenas.  Need a refreshing drink to wash down that pizza? Piece also brews their own beer! I went with their house stout and my roommate got the belgian single. Both great beers!

We went here on a Friday afternoon/evening and the place was packed. Always a good sign in eyeballing if they have good food. Then again, it made the wait for two pizzas fairly long. Okay, maybe 30-40 mins for two handmade non premade pizzas isn't too bad, but seeing and smelling all the other pizzas while being super hungry made it feel really long. Chicago is known for deep dish pizza, but this place has New Haven style which is thin crust and sans mozzarella. We went regular style with the cheese, as we all love cheese haha. The pizza came out PIPING hot...which meant the cheese wasn't cooled down and stuck to the dough yet. So when we picked up a slice it was super floppy and all the toppings fell down. Oops. However, the flavor was all there, it was great! But the taste comes at a price...literally and figuratively as it is suuuuppper greasy. Overall, I definitely enjoyed our visit, and wouldn't mind going there if any one in my group suggested it, but it wouldn't be at the top of my suggestions.",0.9948,0.786,0.204,0.01,0.49936985236985243

I get that Piece is a brewery too, but there were kids and babies and stuff inside, so I'm not sure why a bouncer was necessary. I mean, we were just getting a pizza. The atmosphere was lively but not overly crowded. It seemed like a typical classic American bar. Anyway...the important stuff...food. We ordered a pepperoni and mushroom pizza with the original red sauce (there were also white sauce and sans-mozarella options available). The pizza took a pretty normal time to come out for a sit down restaurant. It was served blazing hot and as soon as I tried to pick up a slice, all of the cheese and other toppings slid off onto the tray. Whomp whomp.

After the 14 of us had sat there for 30 minutes the manager came to our table and told us that someone else had reserved the same table under a different name. Rather than apologize or suggest a way to remedy the situation, he put the blame on us and repeatedly told us how we must have made a mistake. Only after we showed him the confirmation of the $25 reservation charge and 2 phone calls which had been made to confirm the reservation did he even begin to own up to the fact that the mistake may have been on their side. He continually put pressure on us to leave the table & the only accommodation he suggested was that we could reserve the same table for another day- which was extremely awkward considering that the birthday balloons attached to my friend's chair should have clued him into the fact that this was a special occasion. He eventually went to go sort the matter out, during which time the people who had been double booked came to our table and yelled at us for taking their spot. Although in the end we were able to keep the table and they took $55 off of our bill, I am still outraged at how poorly the situation was handled and highly doubt anyone in our group will be back again, which is unfortunate considering that we all live nearby.

We got the atomic pizza with chips and dip.  Chips and dip were good not great.  I liked the spinach sauce that came with it but that's not why I came.  The Atomic pizza came with a spicy sausage and pepper jack cheese and while you could tell it's spicy, it was overwhelming.  Maybe I'm just a spicy guy, but I would've liked the heat to be turned up a few notches on an ""atomic"" pizza.  Otherwise, pizza had a good crust and you definitely get a good size pizza for the money.  If you're looking for a Chicago style pizza though you won't find it here as this is New Haven style.  A nice departure from pizza you may have had recently.  It has a bit more chew and it turns out to be more of an oval pizza instead of round.   I didn't even mention that they brew their own beers here.  I was able to try a few styles and I'd definitely recommend the Dunkelweizen, but I imagine they rotate beers so it might not be available right now.  All in all I'd recommend checking it out at least once if you're in the area.",0.9824,0.795,0.145,0.06,0.5755449907235622

My favorite pizza to get is red pizza with pepperoni, garlic mushrooms, spinach and goat cheese. Also like to get meatball with black olive too! As far as appetizers I go with the goat cheese and caprese salad. Also for desert the chocolate pizza can not be beat! their bar is top notch too! I have never had them say they don't have anything. The vibe of the place is awesome - definitely a bar - but they have seating away from it - good for groups as well as just 2 people.

We get it, you're a hot spot but your customers have lives too. So save some of your tables for reservations. PLUS if put your name on the waitlist, they won't take your number down and text you that your table is ready. This means don't leave the bar - squeeze yourself in there and wait. Keep spending money. Fight your way back to the host stand and keep checking in. Or if you go elsewhere call or walk over and check in multiple times. Pretty unaccommodating. It just doesn't make sense. They gave us a time frame of waiting, we called before it even got to the lower end of the time frame and she had already skipped us. So we RAN back and then got seated.

My girlfriend and I were reminiscing all week about how good it was the first time, unsure whether it was the pizza or if the long wait and rumbling stomach turned us into some kind of pizza craving monsters. Thankfully, it was the former. Everything we had today was as good as the first time we were here. We tried their red pizza with mushrooms, green peppers and sausage. The freshness of their ingredients is what really makes them something special. You know all of the mushrooms were sauteed, not poured from the stems and pieces cans you can find at lesser establishments. We also had a white pizza with tomatoes. The garlic is definitely in every bite, but never overpowering. We ordered two mediums (hey, we can eat) and were warned of their size. I never take these warnings seriously, but next time I'm at Piece, I will. A medium will easily feed two people, probably even three, leaving everyone comfortably full. Expect a wait if you go during any of the peak times, and it's probably not a great first date place since it's so loud.

There were a few places we were considering for lunch, but Piece quickly rose to the top of our consideration list because the wait has been super long every time I have been here. Most recently, I tried to go to Piece with a group of four on a Friday and the 45 minutes wasn't something I was willing to wait. As we hoped, we were seated immediately at 2:30 PM. However, the place was far from empty.  I've ordered a white pizza both times I've been here. You can get a red pizza with sauce and cheese, a classic with sauce and garlic, or a white pizza with olive oil and garlic. After a little deliberation, we decided to just get onion on the white pizza because it already had fresh garlic (our other go-to ingredient). We opted for the medium size pizza, which serves 2-3 people. The pizza came out after an appropriate time and it was really good. Piece definitely earns my vote for one of the best thin crust pizzas in Chicago. The crust is hand-pressed to perfection, not overly crackery thin with bumps that give me goosebumps. Yum! The olive oil, garlic, onion, cheese combo is a total winner and even though I haven't tried a pizza with sauce here yet, I'll be tempted to get the same tried and true combination again next time. The only hiccup in my experience was the service. We were seated right away, but then we didn't get waters for ~10 minutes. At one point, our busy waitress turned her head back at us as she rushed by saying, ""Sorry, I'll be with you soon."" She was perfectly pleasant and friendly (almost overly so), but she was running around like a madwoman the entire meal. Literally running. She kept almost bumping into people and she definitely nudged some chairs. It seemed like either there weren't enough staff working or she just thinks the most efficient way to wait on people is by running around. This provided an uneasy dining experience.

We dropped by two or three times during our weekend visit to Chicago, and it was packed every time, even during off hours like 3pm on Sunday. The receptionist told us that it's like that all day every weekend, and the only time it's relatively quiet is during the daytime on weekdays. Well, the third time was the charm, because we snagged good seats at the bar and ordered a meatball pizza with giardiniera on top. The wait for our food wasn't too long, and we got our pizza within less than 20 or so minutes. And the pizza was excellent! The crust was delicious, light, yet toothsome, the meatballs were savory and rich, and the giardiniera was amazing. Everyone out there, the wait is worth it. Well, except on Saturday nights when you might have to wait 2-plus hours for a table. Fortify yourself with snacks beforehand and bring War and Peace to read while you wait.

While we were seated in a reasonable amount of time considering how busy it was, it was 20 minutes before our drink order was taken. Another 15 before the drinks showed up. The food we ordered was yet again great but we barely saw our waitress.

The last time I went I brought my boyfriend on a fairly slow night. Our waiter only showed up to take our order. He never came by again. He had no recommendations for their beer for my boyfriend who was looking for a recommendation. He didn't even deliver our food to us, a runner did (not that unusual, I know). He was still there, I saw him multiple times talking to other employees or hanging by the bar. The food was good as usual but I was really disappointed. He never came back to refresh our drinks, see how we liked our food, etc. Maybe he was just having a off night. Maybe he was brand new and didnt have recommendations because he wasn't comfortable with the menu yet, I'm not sure. But after three visits and really only one good experience... I find I haven't wanted to come back. I have spoken to various friends of mine who have had similar experiences.

Usually I have no clue what im drinking but I ordered 3 of their three oz dollar samples and each one was light and refreshing. For pizza, four of us decided to split two large pizzas which is pretty insane since the average large should feed three to four. The first pizza ordered was the special hot Doug's atomic pizza. It came with delicious spiced sausage and the pepper jack cheese added a slight kick. Every time I get a red pizza, I'm never disappointed.  Our second pizza was white and came topped with bacon, mashed potato and bbq sauce. The bacon was tasty and the textures from the soft mashed potatoes with the bacon and crispy bread were on point. Sadly I think the bbq sauce is a bit too sweet for my taste; I think garlic would have been the better choice. Overall piece is a great time to kick back and have beer and pizza with friends.

Since it got good reviews, we figured it was worth a try. This place is popular. We arrived at noon on a Sunday and it was pretty packed. I preferred the ambiance of the main room vs a booth way back in a corner, so we waited for a bit, but it wasn't too bad.  The staff from the hostesses to the bartender to our server, we're all friendly and accommodating. The pizza was awesome; a hit all around. It fact, I found the PERFECT pizza for my son who only likes a hint of cheese on his pizza: the plain pizza style which is a tomato sauce with garlic and parmesan cheese (no mozzarella). He devoured the entire thing!  Also, for lunch you can order an individual with up to three toppings which was perfect for us since my family of 5 all wanted something different. The price was for a 3-topping individual was $7.95; totally reasonable in my book. My daughter and I both got veggie variations; mine on a red pizza; hers white. Both delicious. My hubby got the most creative award: a white pizza with mashed potatoes, artichokes and mushrooms. It was terrific!  For dessert we made room for the chocolate pizza. Yum. :-) My husband sampled many of the varieties of beers- he liked the Full Frontal Pale Ale and the Hot Mama best; although he liked them all.   The reason I listed it as 4 instead of 5 stars is the noise. It is exceptionally loud. Difficult to have a conversation without shouting. It would be ""normal restaurant loud"" as it is, but then they also have the music at a super high volume.

I could have counted the number of sausage nuggets on the pizza on two hands. Not to mention there were a couple of pieces of bacon spilt on there and I distinctly tasted basil several times leading me to believe they just threw some on there with the spinach.

They've stopped paying attention to pizza, basically. I also find their policy of asking you to wait by the bar, even though there are clearly empty tables, to be super annoying. Obviously they just want to force you to buy drinks while your wait for a table that's already open. This is a really unfortunate business practice, and very awkward for people who don't drink. The Hot Doug pizza they recently had either sucked or was badly executed when I got it. There was hardly any cheese at all on the pizza. The same story for the traditional red pizza with vegetable toppings.  This kind of inconsistency is totally inexcusable for a pizza joint. It's pizza, it's not molecular gastronomy. I just want a good pizza. I don't want to guess if this visit is going to result in success or if I get a lackluster pie thrown together by someone who clearly didn't give a shit.

(my buddy who is an expert on microbrews praises their quality control; all I know is that the beer is delicious) How about how the pizza is an exemplary balance crust, cheese and sauce? Each slice is soft at the end near the tip, overwhelmed by the sauce and the cheese,  building to a crescendo of crispy crust as you move outwards towards the edge. The slices are also appropriately, even playfully, large and unwieldy, adding to their charm.

Last month was for the Honey Butter Fried Chicken and this month was for the Girl and the Goat Pizza. Wow, both were superb. It was my first experience with New Haven style pizza and I have to say I am a fan. I suppose having fried chicken, chicken crispies, smoked paprika and honey had something to do with this but I see myself returning to Piece for a ""regular"" pizza. I cannot speak to the nighttime crowd or service as I've always dined in for lunch. Service has always been good and the place is generally bustling (but not super crazy) at lunch time. Appetizers are good but I do wish there were a couple more offerings in that department... particularly something fried but both the baked goat cheese and spinach dip are good.

I'm not gonna lie, though. I can easily inhale a whole pizza all by myself. And I have.  This is basically the place to be for watching a sports game, drinking beer with your buddies, and enjoying some pizza. The times I've been here there have always been groups of guys hanging out. Once, our group got friendly with another group and they let us have a couple slices of their BBQ pizza for a piece of our sausage pizza. Sweet deal! You may be overwhelmed by pizza options when you come here. You really can't go wrong with anything you might order here. They have a pretty good selection of beers, too, which I've taken advantage of.  Not gonna lie, I'm not big on sports, but I like the camaraderie of Piece.

The first 2/3 of the slice was ok not too bad some tastiness to it but the last third was rock solid crust. Does their crust contain a special ingredient similar to concrete? Is this a New Haven Style thing? Ill be sure to bring my hacksaw next time. My friends pizza was even worse, almost half the pizza was rock solid. It was so bad they just refunded him the price for the pizza. 50% off then the other 50% as goodwill.

But I will say that I feel that the quality has slipped quite a bit in the last 3-4 years.  The pizza used to just pop, the toppings made the pizza pop, the pizza made the toppings pop, me likes my pizza to pop.  Fresh, hot crispy, delicious.   Now more often than not its soggy, cold and the toppings are unevenly distributed.  I site the ""fill this out"" culture.  If you've ever picked up a pizza from Piece when they run your card they hand you the receipt and ask you to ""fill this out"".  Really buddy?  No place on earth does a person at the counter more blatantly make  you feel like you are obliged to give them a tip than at this place.  And no its not just one guy, its all of them.  Lets get this one right, he asks your name, turns around grabs the pizza hands it to you...and thats it...he wants a tip for that?   I feel that this attitude and culture is affecting the quality of the pizza.  There's an unearned sense of arrogance that oozes from the employees of this place.  Fill this out?

The ambience is your normal bar/grill type. Much bigger than I expected going in because I heard its packed almost all the time. Now onto the food and drinks. The one and only thing I didn't like about the place was their 3 options for appetizers, and I can see why. They specialize in pizza and pizza is filling enough but I would've loved more options in that area. We ordered a large red pie with onion and green pepper and half pepperoni half Italian sausage. Let me say that it was hands down one of the best pizzas I've ever had and trust me when I tell you, I've had my fair share of pizza. We obviously had leftovers and threw it in the oven the next day and it was almost just as good as it was when we were there. Which is a total plus. They brew their own beer at this spot and that was really just a bonus. We both started off with the Camel Toe which was dubbed as a double IPA and about 9.5alc/vol. this IPA was one of the lightest smooth IPA's I've tasted and didn't taste like it was very hoppy or had that high of an alcohol content in it. We then ordered a few sample glasses which were only $1 of the stout and the red which they had on tap. Both were good and when I go back I plan to taste the rest of what they have to offer.

2014-12-14,2.0,"Piece doesn't even come close to living up to the deliciousness that is New Haven style pizza. As someone who has eaten New Haven style pizza too many times to count, trust me, this is a shabby reproduction. First, the crust here was too thick and too crispy. You'd never find a crust like this at Pepe's or Sally's. Second, Piece put zero cheese on it! There was mayyyyybe one sprinkling of cheese towards the middle of the pizza, but it was so small you couldn't even taste it. Now, New Haven style pizza isn't known for an abundance of cheese, but they normally put on enough for you to at least know it's there. Sadly, this pizza was totally blah and was one of the saddest pizza's I've had in years. It was a complete waste of calories.  Now on the other hand, if you're looking for beer, Piece is a good place to check out. They have a large selection of beers to choose from and have something for everyone. The staff is also nice. The place itself is basically a sports bar, which I didn't mind, but if you're looking for a quite place to sit and eat, this isn't it.  Overall, this is a poor excuse for New Haven pizza and I think Chicagoans only like it because they don't know any better.  But I do and I won't be back any time soon.",-0.885,0.828,0.068,0.104,0.4362995029661697

In my opinion, the higher the ABV the better the beer (usually) and these two beers were 9-10% ABV. So yeah I loved both of them, they tasted great.

Their pizza is only half of the story - Piece also brews some amazing beers.  The Dark and Curvy is probably my favorite of the bunch.  It's a very drinkable Dunkelweitzen that pairs perfectly with pretty much any pizza I can imagine (except, maybe, something with BBQ sauce, pineapple, etc.).  The Golden Arm is also great a great choice if you're looking for something lighter.  I'd liken it to something like a Stiegl. One suggestion re: beer - I highly recommend getting a growler or two to take home with you.  The growlers are poured the proper way - through a tube that extends directly to the bottom of the jug - so they don't lose carbonation during the pour. They're also sealed properly too - the bartender covers each growler cap with a plastic ring that's then shrink wrapped by using a hairdrier.  The result is a growler that - if left unopened - will last in your fridge for several weeks.  Once opened, the carbonation starts to go after about a day or two.   Although I don't have many dislikes, I must admit that I'm not crazy about the overall noise level at Piece.  It gets really loud when it gets busy.  And busy it is.  Pretty much anytime on weekends after 5:30PM, it's packed.  With that said, Piece is absolutely worth the trip.

2014-11-02,5.0,"Delicious, plain and simple. Saying that, this pizza isn't for everyone, because, while the first couple of slices are crispy, the heat of toppings quickly turns the crust soggy. Even with the crust soggy, the quality of the toppings is top notch, so the change in texture isn't a big deal for me. If you'd like to hang on to the crisp a little longer, ask for the crust to be good and crispy, but remember the cheese will come out darker. Other foods? Have only had the house salad and that is very good. If you're a beer drinker, their home brews are very good, but I'm a hard liquor drinker so my judgment might be off. The major bad thing about the place, it is over the top busy during the evening hours. There will be a solid long wait for parties of 3+. 2 tops have a long wait also, just not as long. My advice, go during the day, if you can.",0.9578,0.814,0.151,0.035,0.4959834368530021

He Didn't even tell us until we asked. We were at a pizza place and just wanted a plain order of garlic bread. They tried to get us to order bruchetta and we said no and they came out with a double order or buttered french bread that was not even toasted.  We ordered the pizza and it was horrible. So chewy and not at all good.  This place is the worst pizza in chicago. If you want to get wasted and drunk go here.

It's New Haven style, which like Brooklyn Pizza is thin crust, light on the cheese, great  sauce. Two of us shared a white pizza that was so garlicky I couldn't believe they had the guts to go there. Fantastic. Shared a red sauce with Italian sausage and red onion, perfect sausage. Shared a red sauce artichoke heart, amazing. I'm going back to Brooklyn next month after 10 year hiatus.

2014-09-17,4.0,"Coming from the NY area, trying to find ""thin crust pizza"" in Chicago is like finding a needle in a haystack. They're out there but what I call thin crust and what Chicago calls thin crust are two entirely different things. So when I heard about Piece I was pretty jazzed. Rumors of ""thinner"" crust pizza and locally brewed beer got my attention. My wife and I ordered a medium pizza which at promised could have fed 3. Topped it off with meatballs and mushrooms for good measure and to see how generous they were with the toppings as they aren't cheap to add on. Also ordered a few of the Hefeweizen and an Ale they had on draft. Overall a nice pie. Good crust, nicely charred and thin enough to not make you feel bloated once you've eaten it but thick enough to hold up to the toppings which were generous enough. Pie is served on a big old cookie sheet and irregular shaped which gave it this homemade feel which I liked. Not too much sauce or cheese so they got the balance right there. Overall a solid pie and beers were good as well.  Now I'm going to show my ""Southport Side"" and say this place is total hipsterville. Our waitress was so hip, I'm honored she actually waited on us. Which was kind of a problem as service was pretty bad... She was hard to find, never really checked on us and whispered when she came to the table. The music wasn't exactly loud but I guess that's part of her hipster charm as she's a low-talker. Also had a bad experience with bugs. There were flying insects everywhere. I spent a fair amount of time swatting them away from my beer and my pie. This was a few weeks ago when it was warm but still, I wasn't sitting outside so I should feel like I was. Gotta get this under control. Come for the food, (not for the service or insect-free-ness) and you won't be disappointed.",0.9961,0.785,0.187,0.027,0.5277003484320559

2014-09-11,1.0,"So, after eating here roughly twice a month and ordering delivery once a week from work for the better part of a year, I had one of the worst dining experiences of my entire life. To be fair, let me first say that the pizza here is great. That is obvious by now. But running a great restaurant is more than just the food. It's about how you treat people. And tonight Piece staff, specifically the young/childish door man decided to treat a great customer like a 20 year old punk. I arrived early evening to watch football and eat pizza on a Thursday evening. Of course I forgot my ID. Fine, no drinks for me. I'm 34, but whatever. I won't die tonight without a beer. Doorman at first refuses to let me in without marking my hand with a giant X despite the fact little kids are whizzing by me. Ok fine, give me the mark of the beast (this means i am underaged and cannot order alcohol). Reminder: it is 6:00pm thursday night. I head over to the bar to browse the menu. At this point I realize no beer is in my future and I just want to order pizza. Door man goes out of his way to come over to the bar area to tell me I cannot be near the bar. I reminded him I was not trying to order an alcohololic beverage - just waiting for my friend to arrive and wanting to order food. I told him I would only stand. He then said I was not allowed to order food from the bar unless I was sitting at the bar, which is obviously funny because I was not allowed to sit at the bar with the mark of the beast on my right hand. Meanwhile there are children on laps at the bar, whizzing around me. I explain this to him and he starts yelling at me. I became upset and asked him if I could speak with a manager. The manager appears to be 25. Perhaps he was just a line cook, I don't know. All I know is that is incredibly frustrating being disrespected and talked down to by Piece staff who appear to be just kids...who apparently run this place. The manager refused to apologize for the way his employee talked to me. The whole thing was totally embarassing. Reminder: I understand rules. Not once did I attempt to order a drink. A little common sense and kindess goes a long way, but not at Piece pizza. In summary, great pizza. Horrible, horrible service. Entire wait staff seems to be under the age of 25 with no common sense or understanding of how to treat customers. If this place did not have a great pizza it would never survive a customer first business environment. Whoever owns this joint should SERIOUSLY consider hiring an ADULT to be here and run this place. The pizza is to good to be ruined by horrible staff. Update to my update (i wrote this review while at the restaurant): there was a giant hair in my pizza and the door man was ripping darts outside by the door on the way out. Stay classy, Piece. Bill J - I suggest you remove your response below claiming that I attempted to order a beer becsuse this is total libel and false. I NEVER once attempted to order a beer. Did you even read the review? I did not HAVE my ID on me let alone use an expired ID. Are you joking? Review your cameras. The review is about my horrible experience with your staff, not about getting served. Your response is rather indicative of how you treat your customers rather than simply apologizing for your error. Now it is public for all to see.",-0.6261,0.806,0.098,0.096,0.5929427326486151
2014-09-10,4.0,"My husband and I spent three years in New Haven, and the one thing we miss most about that hell hole is the pizza, which really is some of the best in the world. I felt a little silly getting it in Chicago, but you guys seem to like it best too. I don't see any of your deep dish spots getting these kinds of reviews. We came with a group of six at prime dinner hour on a Tuesday night, and we faced about an hour-long wait. The place was very busy and alive, with more of a casual sports bar atmosphere than expected. (Coming from L.A. I thought this would be like a precious artisanal place.) The soundtrack was cool, like 50% Built to Spill. The bar was huge and central, and we were able to get beers with relative ease despite the crowd. At some point, we figured out there was a completely empty waiting lounge set in a plain alcove a few steps below all the action. This made waiting for a table pretty painless. The beers helped, too--they were excellent. Piece brews some of its own, and I had a couple pours of the Camel Toe, a heavy, flavorful, top notch double IPA. I forget what everyone else had, but they were happy. Once we were seated, everything went pretty smoothly. Our waitress was attentive and the food came out fast. The pizza was not quite on the same level as the New Haven classics, but it was definitely delicious, with thin crusts and nice char. Piece offers red, plain, and white pizzas with a large variety of toppings. All pies come with parmesan cheese, oregano, and olive oil included, but most other things are a la carte. We shared a medium plain red (traditional tomato sauce and mozzarella) and a large red topped with mashed potato, Italian sausage, pepperoni, and roasted red peppers. Most of us favored the loaded-up pie. The mashed potato (a New Haven thing from this one place called Bar) was a lovely topping, salty and soft in a way that worked well with the crispy/chewy crust. If I ever make it back to Piece with similarly minded people, I'd like to sample a white clam--that's the real test of a New Haven pizza, in my opinion. We left Pie full of good beer and good pizza, an ideal state for both body and soul. (Okay ""body"" may be a stretch, but while pizza is never the lightest thing you can eat, New Haven-style is less of a brick-in-stomach experience than deep dish.) I had a great time at this place, and would recommend it to pizza eaters from in or out of town.",0.9988,0.757,0.223,0.02,0.4638463788463788

2014-09-07,5.0,"I went to Piece yesterday evening for the first time. Some people call me the ""pizza princess"", and this princess was impressed.  The pizza, which came served on the biggest cookie dough sheet I've ever seen, was literally mouth watering. My boyfriend and I, and another couple ordered (1) large plain pizza with 1/2 sausage, 1/2 pepperoni and all mushrooms. The toppings are $2 each, so I think our pizza came to $25. Not bad at all, for 4 people! The ""plain"" style came with red sauce, garlic, and Parmesan (they specifically make it clear that NO mozzarella comes on this style, however there are two other styles, one regular WITH mozzarella, and one ""white"" style). The three people I was dining with all ordered a Piece beer, which they loved.  This was my first time eating here, and my first time eating at a local pizza place since I'm newly moved to Bucktown. Upon exiting, I noticed that on Sundays (only, and ONLY to-go), you can get a LARGE pizza and a GROWLER fill for... $25...! What an incredible idea and price.  It should be noted that this place is huge, hip, and hoppin'. It was fairly loud, but not too uncomfortable. The only ""complaint"" I have was about the service. If you're reading this now, you might know that I do critique service, but I also do understand that for the most part service does not affect the taste of food. Our server was very quiet, and I mean ""quiet"", in that we could not understand her, and she could not understand us. There were many ""what's"" exchanged. When my friend asked for a to-go growler of her beer that she was drinking our sever said that they don't fill growlers with they beer, and that was all she said. She did not offer a list if beers that are growler-friendly, or suggest something else. She literally just walked away, which is fine, I suppose. Like mentioned earlier, it was very busy.  In the end, would I go back? Yes. Would I recommend to any friends? Yes. Would I go back today (Sunday), within 24 hours of my last visit to mow down on their Sunday special?

If you are unsure of what beer to pair with your pizza, my suggestion would be to get their $7 beer flight - you get seven 3 oz glasses of their personally brewed beers. Can't go wrong! This place is awesome for groups! They have a personal pizza, but it's not super filling, so my advice would be to share a large pizza with one or two of your friends. Their best special is the Sunday carry-out deal: a large pizza with a 64 oz growler, all for $25! It's awesome meal to split with some friends at home and just hang out.

It's a cool little spot--it mixes a pizza joint with the bar atmosphere, which makes it a cool spot for a date or to bring family members. Sounds weird, but each time I've been here, there have been families with children sitting at tables nearby.  Anyway, the pizzas are pretty large. The first time I visited this place, my date and I ordered a medium, and we had leftovers, and he was a pretty tall guy, so that's saying something. The second time I visited this place, I came here with a girlfriend. My girlfriend and I are two small little ladies, and we can eat, so the small was the perfect serving.

I prefer eating more pizza and not feeling like there is a brick in my stomach after one piece. Enter Piece Pizza. A beautiful slice of New Haven amidst the doughy pies of deep dish. My friend from Chicago swears by this place, claiming it is the best pizza in all of Chicago. I can't speak for the rest of Chicago pizza, but this place was pretty dang good.  Be prepared for a wait, especially on weekends. Although seating is ample, the place is so popular that you are bound to wait 30-45 minutes for a table. And it's loud. Not the best place for a serious conversation or romantic date. That being said, the service is still prompt and does well for such a busy, crowded restaurant. And onto the reason you are surely reading this, the food. I found the pizza to be just the way I love it- crispy thin crust, robust red sauce, the perfect amount of cheese, and myriad toppings. Whether you love veggies like me and want a garden on your pizza or you are a meat & potatoes guy (you can literally get mashed potato on a pizza), you are sure to find something you like. Beware- your eyes are assuredly bigger than your stomach. Especially if you indulge first in their crostini with creamy goat cheese in warm marinara. It's totally worth it.

They responded immediately that yes the crust is vegan and suggested I order the plain (tomato/garlic/oil), sans parm and with whatever toppings sounded good. I can't stand dairy-free cheese and wouldn't have ordered even if they had it...I just love a great crust w/amazing toppings and some oil. I did the plain pizza, no parm & added red onion, black olive & spinach. This thing was phenomenal!!! Per usual, everyone at the table wanted to try, and loved my pizza.

Our waiter was amazing, very friendly and patient considering how we were a relatively large group of people as well as slightly indecisive. Not to mention, our appetizers were on point. The chips and salsa were amazing, but of note, the goat cheese made me open my world to goat cheese after years of finding it repulsive.

We never had empty drinks for long and our order was taken and delivered as expected. We were seated at one of the long tables in the center of the restaurant (between the bar and the booths). Since there were only two of us, they did seat a family of four next to us. It didn't bother me in the least. In fact, we even got to chatting with them a bit about the food.

The amount of space you have from other customers next to you was very very tight. If I wanted to I could repeat every word of each of the people next to me as well as hug them.

2014-07-15,4.0,"I have to be honest, I went to Piece expecting to hate it. I have a weird stigma attached to breweries that serve food at an equal level as the beer. I was shocked when the first beer I tried was delicious...and then the second. Don't get me wrong, they weren't all hits, but overall the beers and the food are mighty good at Piece. I've heard horror stories of the wait at Piece. It's Wicker Park, after all, and my friends and I went on a Saturday night. When we checked in, they told us the wait for 5 was 40 minutes. Not as bad as I expected at all. Just enough time to grab a beer and hang out at the bar actually. Imagine my surprise when after just 20 minutes they called us to sit down!  We were sat at a booth in the somewhat secluded upper section which was nice but it's dark as heck up there. Completely fine for evenings but during the day, there needs to be a bit more lighting up there. I took my food pix in shame as the flash went off and I hid under the table. Piece's pizza is quite good. I'm not a tomato kind of girl and from what my friends were saying, the white pizzas are where it's at. Thin only! No deep dish biznits up in here. My friends and I got two white pizzas - one with mushrooms, banana peppers and italian sausage - the second with chicken & meatballs. I picked out the meatlovers one, of course. I wanted bacon on it, too, but my friends told me to relax on all the meat. The pizzas came out steaming hot and I enjoyed them both greatly. The crust was flaky and buttery and all the toppings were fresh & tasty. The garlic in the white pizza definitely came through. The tables are not very big and they bring the pizzas out on huge trays so there is no room for anything else on the table. You have to kind of tip toe your booty up so you can talk to your table mates, otherwise your face is covered by the massive pizza trays.  I basically begged my friends to finish our meal with the chocolate pizza. Yea, we were all full but chocolate pizza?!?!?! Come on! It was so indulgent and we couldn't kill much of it but I liked it. I don't think it's something I'd ever get again just because of the sheer size of it, but it was S'mores-tacular!  Beerwise - the Dark & Curvy is where it's at. You can get small 3 ozs. sizes of the beer for just $1 each! I had a full glass of the dark & curvy then the tiny sizes of every other beer on the menu (5 as the single & ready to mingle beer was out). Roland the Headless Assistant was my second favorite but the rest were a solid 3.5 bottle caps. Piece is way loud. My friends and I were sitting at a somewhat secluded booth and I think we said WHAT!? more than anything else Saturday night. Next time I go, I'm going to try to hit up an off time to avoid the bad acoustics. My one regret: Not getting the mashed potato & bacon pizza!

2014-07-11,3.0,"I don't know what I can say about Piece that one of the 2500 other reviewers haven't already said, but given how much I love their pizza, I feel like I have to say SOMETHING. Because I love their pizza a LOT.They call it New Haven-style, which maybe it is, but I've never been to New Haven, nor found another New Haven-style pizza place to compare it to. So all I know for sure is that it's awesome and pretty unique, especially for Chicago. The thin crust is the perfect mix of chewy and crunchy, the sauces are delicious, and the toppings are plentiful and flavorful. (My go-to combo: sausage, onion, goat cheese on a white pizza. I call it The Makeout Special.) Seriously one of the top 5 pizzas in Chicago, especially if you can't or won't commit to deep dish on a given night. So if I love the pizza so much, why only three stars? I'm glad you asked; it's because literally everything else about this place is a pain in the ass. The Six Corners area of Wicker Park can be a nightmare to navigate. The restaurant itself is so crowded that there's always a wait if you are eating anywhere close to a normal mealtime (plus, everyone has a ""passed over at Piece"" horror story or two), and so loud that conversation is practically impossible. The non-pizza offerings are just average (although, to be fair, they might suffer from the fact that they are simply in the way of the pizza). Service tends to range from indifferent to downright bad (again, owing to the crowds). They do offer carry-out and delivery options which you would think would mitigate these problems, but the pizza doesn't travel as well as a Chicago-style pie (which I actually think benefits from the extra time to set). I guess you could order carry-out and then eat it in your double-parked car outside the restaurant, but that could get weird and/or messy. Ultimately, the wonderful pizza makes up for the many other shortcomings. I like taking friends from out of town here because it not only shuts them up about pizza in Chicago being more like lasagna or whatever, but because the long wait and the noisy interior make it feel like an EVENT more than a meal. Of course, that's also a fair representation of why I only rarely come here myself.",0.9923,0.74,0.172,0.088,0.6620091492431917

Our server was nice but clearly frazzled and the food take awhile to be ready (for reference we were seated at 9:30pm on a Sat) App: We got the guat- it was solid but not extra special Pizza: We probably picked the wrong pizza as I have had better at Piece in the past. In this case we created our own with chicken, onions, and red peppers on a red pizza.

However, they do not offer a ton of variety, they basically re-brew the same beers over and over again.  Not a typical brewpub that experiments. My big issue is service.

2014-06-03,5.0,"I'd heard many many good things about Piece--especially that it's unlike a deep-dish pizza and super fantastic. My coworker spent a good month or two bragging about Piece and shoving the ever-amazing clam & bacon pizza in my face.  I couldn't stand it anymore, so I decided to plan a get-together with several friends as a part of my birthday in April. I came on a Thursday night and read online that a reservation should be made for parties of 10 or more. I filled out their group reservation request and received a reply within 2 hours notifying me that there would be a $25 non-refundable reservation fee...which I thought was absolutely ridiculous. So I decided to wing it and just have my group there and wait for a table. Two of my friends got there before me and tried to get us a table--but were told that at least half of the party had to be there before being seated. They were pretty accommodating and once most of us arrived, we were seated within 5 minutes. Piece has three types of pizza: red pizza - tomato sauce and mozzarella, white pizza - olive oil, garlic, mozzarella, plain pizza - red sauce, extra parmesan, olive oil, garlic. We ordered 4 medium pizzas for 8 people, which was more than enough: clam & bacon white pizza, garlic & basil red pizza, mushroom & mashed potato white pizza, chicken & broccoli & roasted red pepper red pizza.  I had the Golden Arm to drink! Delicious! My favorites were the clam & bacon and mushroom & mashed potato. Ugggggh soooooo yummmmyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.

Un-freaking-believable.  My friend ended up yelling at the daughter and then told the staff. They were apologetic and a little amused by the entire situation, and in retrospect, so were we. Moral of the story: get there early to snag a table and fend off suburban moms. For food, we ordered some chips and salsa for an appetizer. I would pass on these as they are just OK.

We came here on a Saturday for lunch and were seated right away. I liked the atmosphere, it was very hipster and chill. I liked that the roof was made out of glass so the sun can seep through. But yeah I was surprised to see the number of people having a couple of glasses of beer at 12 o clock in the afternoon but hey it's 6 o clock somewhere~ I can see it being a big hit when there's a game on because there's bar seating and plenty of TVs. ANYWAYS onto the food, we ordered chips and spinach dip as an appetizer, very flavorful and delicious I would definitely recommend it, the chips kind of tasted like Doritos. As for the pizza you get to pick whatever toppings, we put clams on half only and sausage on the other half. We also added mashed potatoes, garlic, and mushroom. (There's an option to put broccoli I definitely wanna try that) The pizza was good, nothing special but it wasn't bad either, I'm not a fan of thin crust, I like a good baked thick crust. They also have a wide selection of beer I really enjoyed mine, it was pretty strong too... The only reason I give 2 stars is because the service is soooo bad.

2014-05-01,4.0,"Have you ever getting tired of those excessive of options from the Chinese restaurant? Every time you end up with some Orange Chicken or Mongolian Beef because the menu is so confused? Do you just want to try something different? Some real Chinese food, not those American Chinese food? My friend he told me that he never picks which Chinese restaurant to go, because he can always find the same dish in every one of them. It is sad but true at the same time. However, Sing's Noodles is the restaurant only serves the traditional Chinese noodles. Compare to Joy Yee's Noodle Shop, the menu here is surprisingly simple, it is only one page without any American Chinese food, but the real Chinese food.  The first thing you are going to see after you step into the restaurant is an old Chinese man who is pulling the noodle behind the glass window. It is the specialty of this noodle restaurant that every noodle dish they served here is made by hand pulled noodle. It's quite a process for you who had never seen how the noodle is made. Other than that the restaurant itself has been well designed into a modern style. Unlike other Chinese restaurant with the crowded dining section, the light color and big glass wall was used to make the Sing's Noodles' dining section very bright and comfortable. Look to the right, you will find a big ancient Chinese painting was sculptured on the wall. After you sit down the waiter will hand the menu to you. As people wonder about the service in this restaurant, I would say it is around average. They are not the kind of waiter you can find in the fancy restaurant who will treat you like a god, but they will be absolutely helpful to guide you to the right dish. Now it's time to check this super simple menu. There are around forty options that are mainly noodles with couple side dish, such as the dumplings. The price average is around $8 dollar. If you will notice that there are lots of noodle dishes are beef, but from different part of cow. For my suggestion that if you are not Asian and it's the first time you try it, don't pick any strange one. Because they can be the meat from internal organ such as the large intestine.  Now let's eat. The noodle dish comes with a big portion, and for my personal favorite, I like the Beef Hand-Pulled Noodle the best. You can see the big pieces of juicy beef are on the top of hand-pulled noodle with some white carrot and parsley is filling up in the bowl. Before you start, take the spoon and taste the soup first. The soup is full of flavor of beef combined with some spicy and fresh taste. From that taste, you can tell it's the soup from the stew beef bone.  Take a bite of the beef; it is the best experience of the whole dish. Beef is so well cooked, which it is both chewy and soft. Part of beef they picked is not the regularly steak beef you will find in the American restaurant. It is the part close to the joint; the meat is mixed with some cartilage. For you have never eaten the cartilage before, please give a try. It is amazingly soft and smooth. In order to cook the cartilage into that condition, the chief must stew the beef for at least 4 hours.  Now the noodle, it is not much special about its hand pulled specialty, I couldn't tell the different between the hand pulled noodle and the machine pulled one. They taste exactly the same for me and because it was hand pulled, which caused the noodle became too thick to eat and the smooth feeling of the noodle was lost.  Over all I will give the credit for the ingredients and soup of Sing's Noodles. Even the hand-pulled noodle doesn't give much specialty for the dish, but everything else is well cooked. And as a complete piece of noodle dish, I have enjoyed it a lot.  Compare to the portion and the price of the dish, I would say $8.25 for a big bowl of delicious Beef Hand-Pulled Noodle is totally worth it. Especially in the cold winter night of the Chicago, there is nothing better than a big bowl of hot noodle can make you happier. As you eating you will realize that there always some more beef hidden under the noodle.  I haven't try out all the dishes serviced in this restaurant, but from what I had experienced, I strongly recommend Sing's Noodles to those who loves Chinese noodles and want to try some real Chinese food.",0.9991,0.827,0.155,0.019,0.4018863222944857
2014-05-01,5.0,"Being from New Haven Connecticut and knowing what the true Mecca of this country's pizza is all about, I will say that this place has won me over hands-down! They've nailed it to the tee the pizza has a strong chewy but crispy dough texture, the sauce has a perfect balance of the zesty, tangy, and sweet and they use high-quality ingredients all the way. They use high temperature ovens and they cook the pizza dough at the bottom with cornmeal which gives it a perfect crunchiness and flavor that pizza deserves. I usually order their pizza with extra cheese because normally it does come with a good amount of sauce and I've had many different topping style pizzas. And of course I had to have their clam and bacon pizza which is a staple in the New Haven Connecticut area, from a place called Pepe's pizza which has won number 1 Pizzeria the country yr in and yr out. It's almost as good as Pepe's and it is very delicious, plus I do highly recommend the mashed potato pizza, another thing famous in the New Haven area at a place called Bar. I am so happy that this place exists my only regret is that there's not more places like Piece in the Chicago area and that where I live goes outside of their delivery area but they do know me by first name as it is tradition to have a pizza at least once a week. The staff is polite, their craft brews are awesome, this is by far one of my favorite things about Chicago. A taste of home. I highly recommend if you have not tried this place to get over there as soon as possible and experience what real pizza is all about! Mike S.",0.9961,0.788,0.192,0.02,0.6375094696969698
2014-04-30,4.0,"It has been years since I've been here, so I really don't remember this place that well. I'm putting this here for the sake of historical accuracy. Sometimes I do that. I feel like 4 stars is accurate on this one. Yay, I'm a fan. But maybe it's not exactly what you would think I'm a fan of. I mean, sure, the pizza was good & fine and whatnot. But I'm not going to uproot my family and move there because of it. I think there were 2 other things that struck me here.  First, the beer. The selection was solid, and the stuff I've gotten over the years (yes, several times over the years) has always been really, really good. It's to the point that I've strongly considered bringing some of it back home with me. I never did that, but I thought about it. Perhaps I was not 100% sober when thinking these thoughts. Still... I should also mention that I did like the food. My coworkers at the time always wanted to go here on 1 of the nights we went out, so we ended up here often. I was never disappointed to go. It's actually nice to go to a place in Chicago that does not tout themselves as a steakhouse in some way, shape, or form. Second, the chocolate pizza and how accommodating they were when I went there with my daughter. Like many places in Chicago, there is a very big yuppie/urbanite feel to this place. I find that Chicago often resembles a very big version of Hoboken in some ways. As you can imagine, this is not necessarily a great setting for a 6 year old. Having said that, I feel the place was very welcoming of her when we went there. And because of that, and her love of the chocolate pizza, I am appreciative of.  There are a lot of places to eat in Chicago and I'm not going to say that you should absolutely go here. But if you do find yourself here, you should manage to have some solid food, great beer, and very friendly service.",0.9898,0.822,0.15,0.028,0.4439157706093191

Kudos for Piece for trying to expand the normal toppings but it need a good foundation to bring it all together, that is where the crust failed me. It was a Saturday night, there was three of us, and a two hour wait to get a table in their large-for-Chicago dining area. The bar was three people deep so getting a drink was going to take just as long as getting a table. This made the decision to go down the street three feet, to Piece's takeout hall, that much easier. We ordered a large mashed potatoes and bacon, and a medium spinach and goat cheese. Half an hour later we walked out the door with our pies. The pies are BIG. The three of us could've eaten a large with no leftovers but full tummies.  The flavors, again were out of the box, but could've used some seasoning. The mashed potatoes were under seasoned, the bacon was just fine and the spinach was undetectable. The crust tasted lackluster and without the toppings tasted burnt. Not charred, not baked in the brick oven taste, but burnt.  The pies were edible, and I'll gladly fill my belly with the leftovers, however I don't think I would ever pay $50 for these two pizzas again. I'm between marking two and three stars, but swaying me is how disappointed I would've been had we decided to wait over two hours for our ho hum pies.",0.735,0.876,0.077,0.047,0.44063492063492066

2014-03-26,2.0,"My first trip to Piece was a huge disappointment. My husband and I decided to check out the ""Oscars Party,"" which he discovered when he went there with some colleagues. I'm an aspiring screenwriter and a cinephile, and Oscars Night is an annual highlight (yes, despite the fact that they've sucked for the past few years). I have been to a few other public Oscars Parties in other cities, so I expected a similar atmosphere: a big screen to watch the show in a room separate from the main dining room with a rapt (or, at the very least, attentive) audience. ALAS. We arrived on Sunday evening at 6:30, when the ""party"" was said to begin, and there was a huge wait for a table. We were lucky to snag some seats at the bar after standing for about 15 minutes. The red carpet was on a few of the TV screens scattered around the room, but so was the hockey game. The sound on the TV was turned off, and we had to ask the bar staff to turn on the closed captioning. Unfortunately, when the TV sound was turned on, it was still inaudible. The dining room is SO LOUD AND CROWDED you can hardly hear yourself think. Forget about hearing televised voices! When a table was available, we didn't dare move, since we didn't know where we would be relative to a television. At least at the bar there was a TV straight ahead, and I could at least read the closed captioning. (I would've preferred a booth or a lower chair, however.) The party basically consisted of predictions (I was never given a form or whatever means they had of gathering the info, so wasn't even afforded the chance to participate, even though we told the host that we were there for the Oscars party) and a few trivia questions.  I did end up winning a DVD (Pulp Fiction) for the final trivia question, which was allegedly ""tricky,"" but which any semi-hardcore Oscars fan would have known right away. (Q: Who has hosted the Oscars the most times? A: Bob Hope.) We ate pizza and drank beer. It was good, but it was hard for me to enjoy it, as I devoted most of my attention to reading the closed captioning.  Needless to say, we won't be back for the Oscars or indeed anytime during dinner hours. It was honestly too loud and busy to really be enjoyable in any capacity, even if I hadn't been annoyed about the sorry excuse for an Oscars party.",0.9877,0.845,0.116,0.039,0.46048517520215654

Don't get me wrong; they were good, but the flavors are a bit muddy and flat. I was happy enough with my Moose Knuckle (barley wine), which was hoppy for a barley wine and an interesting drink to try. Now, onto the pizza. I know everyone has different opinions on pizza; I'd never had New Haven Style before and after my experience at Piece I don't think I can call myself a fan. If you happen to enjoy it, my apologies. But here's my two cents: New Haven style is thin crust cooked on a cookie sheet. Since cookie sheets don't retain as much heat as a stone, I can only imagine that the pizzas must be cooked longer, which makes the crust very hard. If you like harder crusts Piece would probably be great for you; these crusts were too hard for me. They weren't merely crunchy on the outside, they were hard all the way through. The toppings of my pizza slid off with every effortful bite I had to take and this was an overall messy, unpleasant, and probably unattractive experience. As many others have mentioned the atmosphere is noisy; this is probably a better place to chill with a large group. The staff seem to be used to this and they accommodated our group of about 8 easily. My mediocre beers left a piece of me slightly disappointed, and my piece of pizza was uninspiring.

Full review - Piece is now a long-time staple of the Wicker Park nightlife/restaurant scene. Located right off the Blue Line (well, ok, you have to cross the street and turn right onto North Avenue), the restaurant is very close to all the ""action"" in BuckWicker. It is located in what looks to be an old garage or airplane hangar, and has a nice, dimly lit vibe. The restaurant is loud and always busy; it's not uncommon to have to wait for 45 minutes or longer for a table on a Friday or Saturday night. Most people seem to come here with several friends, so expect a boisterous crowd. All age ranges seem to be represented on any weekend night. The pizza is really good, and worth trying. it is not deep-dish, but it more what I would describe as ""pan-style""...it has a thick spongy crust (did I just say that?), and the pie itself is shaped like a giant rectangle. There is a heavy focus on beer (Piece is not only a pizzeria, but also a brewery) and this, plus the large TV's showing the game, helps  to create a sports bar vibe.

We play games, we play on our phones, we walk across the street and get a drink. About 1.5 hours in, we go back to ask if we're near. We're told it should be about another 45 minutes.

We didn't get seated until almost 845PM. *sigh* Was the pizza good? Yeah. White pizza with chicken, roasted red peppers and mushrooms. But was it work waiting almost 3 hours? I don't know.

Try the mashed potatoes pizza, you won't expect how it tastes, very interesting and very delicious. Salads great as well. Pizza and beer, how can you beat that combo, especially when both are made fresh and in house? Beer selection is always fun and different. Try something new each time you go, it's worth it.

2014-03-01,5.0,"When I heard Honey Butter Fried Chicken and Piece Pizza were doing a collaboration, I got really excited.  I mean who wouldn't (unless you don't like fried chicken or pizza, in which case, I'd have to ask what was wrong with you besides your cholesterol).   And yet, it took us over 3 weeks to make it over to Piece to try it out.  Thankfully, we made it over the weekend, and arrived just in time to learn there would be a 90 minute wait!   Ugh.   There aren't many things I'd wait in line for that long for, and I guess fried chicken pizza is one of them.   Well, usually, I wouldn't wait that long, but we were with good company, and the olympics were on, so I grabbed a beer, and we stood at the bar watching team speed skating until our number was called.  And props to the host staff, because at about an hour and a half on the dot, we finally got seated. So this will be pretty short and sweet.  There were 3 of us, we ordered a medium and a small pizza, the small supposedly feeds 1-2, the medium 2-3.   The two pizzas was more than enough food for 3 people, but would have likely been perfect for 3.  Look for 2 smalls for three people if that's your party size. For those who are familiar with the Chicago Pizza scene, Piece should need no introduction.  Piece is staple in Chicago both for its fantastic pizzas and its brewery.  The focus is on New Haven style pizza - thin crust, slightly charred, chewy dough, fresh ingredients, and no mozzarella.  We went with the standard red, but added the mozzarella and topped it with Spinach and Sausage.  The mix was perfect - the spinach well cooked and the sausage was perfectly cooked and had a great sweetness.  The crust, a bit chewy for my taste, still has a great consistency (give me a slightly burnt, very crisp crust, but that's strictly a preference thing).  The highlight of Piece's pizza is the sauce - smooth consistency, sweet, but not overly so, with just a hint of acidity and a perfect layering to balance with the toppings without being overbearing.   Probably one of the best pizza sauces I've had in the city. We also got a smallHBFC pizza.  As excited as I was for this collaboration between Piece and Honey Butter Fried Chicken, it probably doesn't do very much since I'm updating this after it's over today March 1 (for some reason, the rest of my blog got wiped out a few days ago).  Anyways, by now, you've missed out on the honey butter Fried Chicken / Piece collaboration.   Don't worry, it wasn't life changing, it wasn't earth-shattering, but it was simply a very solid chicken topped pizza.  The chicken itself had great flavor, but you don't get a whole lot of the crispiness of fried chicken skin and the chicken was sparsely placed so there was only one or two solid bites of chicken per slice. In the end, there's not much I'm going to say that'll sway you one way or another about Piece.  For me, it's a solid go to stop for pie in the city.  The location is a bit inconvenient as parking's not great in the area and a 90 minute wait is probably a bit too much.  The price is also a bit steep - you pay a bit for the quality but there's definitely a premium for the reputation and the hype.  But for consistent, solid pizza, Piece has a position high up on my list.

So going against everything Chi-caaa-go in me, I have to say that Piece is my favorite pizza place ever.  The pizzas are pretty much order completely custom to your selection of size, sauces (three to choose from; red, white, and New Haven style), cheeses, and toppings. I'm not a fan of white sauce pizzas, so I have yet to try that version, but the red and the New Haven style sauces are ridiculously good. The pizza comes out in a huge tray with the crispiest, most balanced pizzas I have had in Chicago. While the combination of toppings is up to you, I have yet to have a topping that I didn't think was fresh and delicious (especially the sausage).  We went on the first day that they offered Honey Butter Fried Chicken pizza (as a collaboration promotion they are doing for February). Being a fan of Honeybutter Fried Chicken and Piece, I naturally was very hyped to try it. While the pizza and the chicken were really high quality offerings, I think they're much better separate. It was a little bit of a let down, but still a good pizza. I think it's more for really hardcore fans of both these fine establishments, but if you're not, it's not the end of the world if you skip it.  Overall, Piece is awesome. It provides a high quality pizza at a very, very reasonable price (usually get a large to split for $20-$25). The place is usually packed, and the wait is usually well worth it. Right now this place takes the mantle for my favorite pizza place in the city.",0.9913,0.808,0.159,0.033,0.5278049728049727

We had tried to make a reservation for Saturday night, but I guess only one large area is available on Saturday nights and it was taken. We ended up going at 4:00 PM, which turned out great. We were seated in the little section lower than the main deck, up near the windows. At first it was a little awkward since it was all booths, stools, and little tables, but once we moved it all around it actually worked out great.  Our server was good. He came at all the right times to make sure we had enough food and drink and was quick to bring things out when we needed more.  We ordered a few pizzas, one pepperoni, one of the special Honey Butter Fried Chicken, one barbecue chicken and a veggie. We also kept the beer pitchers coming. The pizza was good! The crust was nice and crispy, but I wish it was crispier in the middle.  Chicago has so much good pizza, so I'm hesitant to rave about Piece's. I'd definitely come back for the overall atmosphere, as well as the great beer. I would also highly recommend it for a party. 20 people ate and drank a LOT for $25 each including tip.",0.9951,0.752,0.222,0.026,0.5251899951899951

We didn't even get a chance to order a drink at the bar! We were happy with that. I love the ambiance here - wooden rafters, shared tables, different levels, dark, unique. I also love that it's a microbrewery, and that it's local. I made the mistake of coming here with pepperoni lovers, so neither of the pizzas we ordered were what I had any desire to eat. The pizza would have been wonderful, if there was just a bit less salt in everything. (Perhaps the pepperoni?!? LOL) I've eaten here once or twice before though and I've always enjoyed it. It's very thin pizza, and I love a lot of sauce on my pizza. Despite the fact that the pizza is so thin, it's always been very good. The crust is so perfect!  Our server gave us a 20% discount because our pizza dough looked like it shrank before it went in the over. My friend gave our server a hard time for eating a bite out of our pizza (which obviously wasn't the case, but she was being funny), and he discounted it for us. We didn't even ask him to - he just said that it was one of his principles, too. So awesome!  I love that you can buy growlers of their beer here, too. Refilling them isn't too expensive, either.

We had no trouble getting a table for four, although it was definitely crowded for a weekday night. Piece brews their own beer which is pretty awesome. The four of us tried a variety of their offerings and liked them all, I especially liked the Golden Arm. For dinner, we started with the Piece Green Salad with chicken. It was really tasty and came in a large portion, I definitely recommend this if you choose to get a starter. For dinner, the four of us split a large pizza. We went a little wild on the toppings...one side contained chicken, bacon, jalapeno, and artichoke. The other side had Italian sausage, mushrooms, spinach, and onion. They were both great and a large was more than enough to feed us, it basically took up the entire table. Adding all of those toppings certainly packed a punch to those thin slices. One of the best parts about eating Piece in the restaurant is that the long slices don't get as soggy. Two reasons for taking off a star, the first being that their pizza is incredibly salty. Not sure if it's the cheese they use or what, but I was inordinately thirsty the rest of that evening and the next morning. Second is that the booths are pretty uncomfortable. None of us were comfortable on the hard wood seats with not much space. Besides that, it's a great pizza place and certainly some of the best thin crust I've had in Chicago. I would suggest eating in on a weekday, as I've heard wait times on the weekend are insane. Overall, great pizza and great value, definitely recommend!",0.9981,0.705,0.255,0.04,0.5748429232804233

It's a crowded place so I'm not sure if the hosts or waiters just miss it or what, but the turnaround time could be a lot better if they fix this problem.  The beer is pretty good with a great variety to choose from. The golden arm is lighter and not at all hoppy. The dark and curvy was my favorite. My bf ordered a few IPA's which he seemed to enjoy. You decide on all of your toppings for the pizza. Some items are about $2 and some premium items are about $2.25. The small is plenty enough for two people, it came with 8 slices. The crust is thin, crispy, and delicious. Toppings are really good. I do agree with some people that they skimp on the sauce though. In that regard, it is kinda like a flatbread. It is a little oily also, but what the hell, only good pizza is! Service was good but you can tell these people are busy and are making good money regardless if they give you excellent service or not since it's so busy. So where's the incentive?

2014-01-31,3.0,"I am not from Chicago, but have now eaten at Piece three times. Here is the scoop. I like pizza.  I eat pizza.  I eat lots of pizza. No...really, I do. Food:  Pizza here is not the traditional Chi deep dish.  It is thin crust and they have all the fixins.  Crust is good (but not great), Only tried the red sauce (traditionalist that I am).  Pizza is a 7/10.   Beer:  Local brew, pretty good.  Certainly worth a try. Crowd:  A mix.  Mostly young.  Lots of hipsters.  GETS VERY CROWDED.  You end up sitting at tables with strangers!  This is usually cool with me, but sometimes you just do not want the company.  No really, if you do not enjoy sitting next to someone dressed like a lumberjack, who could not lift an axe unless it was in a spray can while he says things such as ""hashtag so funny"" to the the girl is having dinner with while they both tap away on their iphones.....get your pizza to go.  Staff:  First two times I had no complaints, but last time....20 minutes wait for a table.  Fine because they are busy. Waiter seats us.  Then ignores us for 20 minutes.  Then takes our pizza and drink order and takes 15 minutes to have the bartender mix the ever complicated ""pint of beer"".  About 5-8 minutes after the beer, the pizza arrives.  7/10 delicious.  BUT NO PLATES!!!!  Whatever...eat without plates until a different waiter can be snagged to bring plates.  Finish pizza, and waiter comes back asking if we need anything. I say that I am in a bit of a rush and just need the bill.  Waiter says fine and disappears.  5 minutes.....   10 minutes..... 12 minutes.....  I get up and head to the bar to try and pay.  LOW AND BEHOLD!!! The waiter is standing at the bar ON HIS SMARTPHONE!  I am sure it was a very important tweet he was composing ( I actually watched him typing for a minute before interrupting his Pulitzer winning 140 characters or less).  When I POLITELY (and I actually was polite) reminded him that I was in a rush and needed the bill.  His response was ""We are really busy, and I need to serve these drinks...then I""ll get your bill"".  It was then that I notice the tray of beers sitting beside him, slowly warming... perhaps the table he was serving was british and wanted warm beer.  Anyhow, I retreated to my table and watched him type for a few minutes more before serving his beers and bringing me the bill.  Here is the part that really bothered me.  It was in his pocket.  I watched him at the bar the entire time.  If he had handed me the bill at the bar and then let me pay, I would have been on my way and maybe given this place another star or two.  Final eval: 7/10 pizza.  2 good servers, one awful server.  Perhaps next time takeout.  Still think the pizza is worth a try. ADDENDUM: Within an hour or two if the above post.  I was contacted by the restaurant management with an apology and an offer to try the restaurant again gratis.  It speaks volumes of their commitment to customer service, that not only do they closely monitor yelp, but that they actively seek to reach out to customers who have had less then stellar experiences.  Perhaps the waiter was having a bad day.  We all do.  I have upped the star count and changed the final evaluation.",0.9806,0.809,0.119,0.072,0.4766161616161618

I've always been skeptical of Piece, to be fair, because we used to get it delivered at work in the Loop, by which time the pizza was no longer fresh and not as good. I always found the crust and pizza in general to be really hard to rip/bite a piece off once it was delivered and so I was always turned off by this. Then one day I finally went in to see what all the noise was about, on a Sunday during football. Usually there's a crazy wait but they seated us right away in a packed house. They get credit for having a great beer list, and interesting menu of pies, and pretty good and fast service, even in a completely packed house. Though we did wait for the bill for like 20 minutes ... it's always a major turnoff when the bill takes about half the time you've spent in the restaurant. The pizza came out and it was hot and good, but nothing to write home about. I also did notice that within 5-10 minutes it was really tough again and so my opinion stands, this is nowhere near the best thin crust! Sorry kids, I won't drink the Kool-Aid.

This is not Chicago style pizza, it is not New York Style pizza, it is New Haven Connecticut style pizza.  Big, wet, super thin, oddly shaped slices of pizza.  They may not sound all that good, but this is my absolute favorite pizza in the city or maybe anywhere for that matter.  There is something about the crust that I just love, it has an almost bagel quality to it.  If you aren't completely stuffed after eating this pizza, try their dessert pizza, a chocolate marshmallow slice of heaven. The second reason to stop in Piece is for the outstanding beer that they brew on site.  Yes, not only do they have some of the best pizza around, they also have some of the best beer as well.  Most of the beers change seasonally, but I have yet to try a bad beer in this place.   In summary, great pizza, great beer.....

We ordered a medium red pizza with italian sausage and mushrooms all over it. My friend got black olives (yuck) and jalapeños on her half of the pizza and I got pepperoni and onions.  The pizza we was so damn good, I ate more than 4 slices....diet starts Monday! The service, which is always an important factor to me, was stellar. The bartender was friendly and patient, allowing us time to select what we wanted to drink. He even provided us with a small sample of two of the beers so we'd know what we'd be ordering. We selected the Stiegl Radler beer which light and refreshing. I thought about ordering 2 - 3 more, but didn't since I said I was giving up booze for the New Year (doubtful that will last). Our waitress was cheerful and always made sure we had what we needed.

I went on a busy Saturday night and was seated by the door (more on this later), so someone, on his way out, slammed an empty glass down on my table.  Before I really noticed, Ryan whisked it away with the remark, ""This doesn't look like a bar!"" Empathy without obvious apology, which can be cloying. [oh, the pizza is good. I am from New Haven.] [So is the beer. I had the Camel Toe and would totally go back to try more.] I guess I'm going backwards, chronologically, in this review. I came here as a solo traveler on a fairly busy Saturday night. I noticed that the hostess communicated with the servers regarding peculiarities of parties, which shows care.  When a table opened up for me, the hostess said to the server, ""Lu will be sitting there."" But the position near the door was particularly apt because it was a prime spot for watching the live band karaoke, which is hilarious and wonderful.

The crust was cracker-y on the edges yet yielding, flavorful and satisfying. Even the New Yorkers at our table were impressed. The IPA, playfully named Camel Toe was a perfect compliment, refreshing yet bitterly interesting. Service isn't always the quickest at Piece but that shouldn't be the expectation going in.

2013-11-23,3.0,"I did not know that New Haven had its own style of pizza pie. I still am not quite sure it does. Let me explain: What I had at Piece was a very tasty, very flavorful, very mouthwatering... warm salad. Maybe cool soup. But it was not really pizza. As I said, the tastes were very terrific--I tried the Plain-style (New Haven) pie, but added spinach, feta, and tomatoes. I also started with the goat cheese appetizer (freaking delicious; wonderful marinara and, as advertised, a ""generous"" portion of cheese). The pie, however, was soupy; the crush was so thin and flat in the middle that it could not hold the toppings (or the sauce) on top. Everything just fell off ass the dough folded downward on itself. I had to fold the end of each slice back up on top of the wider portion to hold each slice in my hand. Do not get me wrong--I really enjoyed how everything tasted. And the edges of the crush were crunchy and pleasant. But the middle third or more of the pie was just tomatoes and other toppings on very soggy, thin dough. Not what I'd call a pizza. As another comment, I did not have opportunity to try the brewed beers. Those may very well be just as mouth-worthy as the food. But if I'm getting pizza, I don't want to have to use a fork (or spoon) to transfer the food from plate to pie-hole. Perhaps the pizza would hold up better with no toppings (only sauce, oregano, and Parmesan--true New Haven style [I'm told]). But it should be able to hold the weight of some extra tomatoes. The water weight should not be collapsing the dough; it is the medium, after all! To sum up: Tastes = wonderful. Place = enjoyable. Beers = ? (I have a good feeling). But delivery? = Meh.",0.9908,0.79,0.156,0.054,0.5081719977553312

Piece Brewery & Pizzeria is exactly what it's called. A brewery who makes pizza.  We waited about 45 minutes for a table for five, which I am told is quite normal.  We hung out in the bar and had some beers while we waited.   I am from the Pacific Northwest -- and if you have ever compared PNW beer with Midwest beer -- you know there is a difference in typical taste.  None the less -- it was pretty delicious beer.  I don't remember exactly what I drank, but I did go with their IPA and other beers with high amount of hops.  Despite the bar being very packed -- the hostess was able to find us to seat us at our table. Unlike most pizza places, they don't have their list of ""pizzas"".  They have Red Sauce, White Sauce, and plain pizza --- you pick the toppings.  The mashed potatoes sounded interesting, so that was my only request.  We ended up getting my groups favorite, Pepperoni, Banana Peppers & Mushroom red sauce pizza.  Our 2nd pizza was a creation no one had tried before: mashed potatoes, clams, & bacon plain pizza.  The latter was one of the most delicious pizzas I have ever tasted in my entire life.

Actually, come to think of it, I've been there 3 times for Saturday night Karaoke with large groups: Bachelorette party, Birthday party, and this past weekend a Going Away party.... I keep hoping it'll be better, but it never is. So, I'm done with this place. I called 3 weeks ago to make a reservation and they wouldn't take one. They said they were all booked up, no matter what size the party was. Really? I'm guaranteeing you service and you're turning me away?!?! I understand if the party has to be a certain size, but I could have made a reservation for 20 or multiple reservations for 4, if necessary--work with me, people! I'm trying to give you business! Whatever... so they told me that we had to get there about 1 hour early to wait for a table. We got there at 8pm, expecting to be seated at 9pm, and didn't get sat until 10pm! Then it took the server at least a good 15 minutes to engage with us. Once we were seated & had ordered, the food came out on time and was delicious & well-priced, hence the stars. Then came Karaoke... Karaoke started 30 minutes late. The Karaoke DJ was bogus and thought he was THE Karaoke God...so pretentious! Shouldn't the Karaoke DJ I'd encourage people in the audience to cheer on those who may not be the best singers but are putting themselves out there and trying their hardest? I mean, this isn't American Idol--this is a bar! He also let a group of kids sing 5 times in a row and let multiple people cut in line just because he knew them. I know this because we signed up at the beginning of the night and were expecting to go on within the first 8-10 songs. We probably sat through 15-20 songs until 12:30am and then the karaoke DJ said the band was going on break. When my friend asked him to please let us go next because we were leaving soon, he didn't listen to us at all and just said tough luck.  So we left.

They offer several styles within that niche and a wide range of standard and non-standard toppings. Even though the ingredients are quality, the prices are reasonable especially given the atmosphere and neighborhood.  Speaking of neighborhood, it's a great launch spot for later wicker buck carousing.  Speaking of atmosphere, it's interior design works well when packed but doesn't feel cavernous when not as busy. Both karaoke nights and football Saturday/Sundays are particularly busy but the crowd brings a lot of fun energy. Not too hipster not too yuppy but eclectic enough to suit either or neither. Probably wouldn't do date night here, but its a perfect place to take family and friends from out of town, or go with single friends to mingle and jingle.

2013-10-01,5.0,"Edit:  I originally wrote a poor review based on some poor experiences there that I had in the past.  The owner sent me a very kind message and generously offered to make things right.  I declined his offer, however the way he handled it made me feel they deserved a second chance. Anyways, I've returned several times (mostly carry-out, but a few times during less-crazy hours) since my original review, so I felt it was time for an update. Pizza and beer are as good as ever (phenomenal), if not better.  I don't think I need to say much more here that hasn't been said.   My bad experiences came with the service in the past... maybe I've just mellowed out, but I've found it to have improved significantly.  My experience with the service during most recent trip (this past Saturday) was especially great.  We had a couple in from out of town who wanted to grab dinner.  When they were dead set on Piece (on a Saturday night at 7:00pm, mind you), despite our warning that it would be extremely busy, I was admittedly dreading the night ahead of me.   Line to put our names on the waiting list was out the door when we showed up... not a great sign.  Luckily it moved quick.  Hostess was sweet, gave us the (expected) bad news that we were in for an hour and a half wait. We lucked out and found a pair of seats at the bar within a few minutes.  Turned into 4 seats.  Bartender (blonde lady) was extremely friendly and attentive, despite the ridiculous crowd.  All in all made waiting a much more pleasant experience than I expected.  We did have to fight off people who tried to barge between us mid conversation... and shift in your seat funny, and you may have people thinking you're about to vacate them trying to jump in... but I guess that's all to be expected. Anyways, we got our table eventually (fairly accurate estimate).  Our waiter was awesome.  Despite running around like a madman, he didn't rush us on our order, kept our glasses full, and checked in on us regularly.  Even had time for some small talk. Anyways, my only complaint before was poor service... and they did everything right this time.  Refreshing to see a restaurant that actually cares about keeping every customer.",0.982,0.757,0.151,0.091,0.5189940562582072

2013-09-25,5.0,"Piece Pizza, located in the heart of Wicker Park, is notable for its ""New Haven style"" pizza (thin crust, mozzarella not required) and good selection of beer they make on premises. From the pizzas I've had in Chicago, this is possibly the best, and the beer selection is quite good and quite varied. A few details: Pizza - crust is unbelievably good, with the perfect amount of char and crispiness. Very long, thin slices. I personally prefer the red sauce pizza to the white pizza, but both are great. The toppings selection is fairly typical (excluding mashed potatoes, clams) but every ingredient is high quality and done right. Beer - house-made, many different styles (kolsch, stout, IPA, wheat, others). All are fairly good, and I find the kolsch to be a particular standout. Service - good. The place gets very busy at peak times, so expect a wait (one hour plus) if that's when you decide to go. It's a huge place, but it's also hugely popular, so the wait really can't be helped. Other - live band karaoke on Saturday nights. Some performers seem fairly legit. Pretty fun. Delivery Radius (an aside) - I am located about three blocks outside of their delivery zone, so they refuse to deliver to my place. I feel like Elaine from that episode of Seinfeld where she pretends to be a janitor in another building to get delivery. Overall - the pizza is flawless, and the beer is also very good, which is especially impressive given that they make it themselves. 5 stars.",0.9763,0.781,0.143,0.075,0.5481208703577124

Since wait times for a table or seat are usually 45 min to an hour long on an average day, the boyfriend and I decided to go on Labor Day.  Our hunch in assuming the crowd would be thin was correct, we walked right in and grabbed two seats at the bar. The place wasn't that busy and neither was the bar area.  Our bartender was probably the worst bartender/server in the history of time.  When we sat down he gave us menus and checked back shortly afterward to take our order. In that regard, he wasn't that bad at taking our orders or fulfilling it.   We ordered a medium, white pizza with half clams, and the other half spinach, tomatoes and artichokes.   The menu says it feeds 2-3, I would say that's very accurate since we had about 1/3 of it left over.  As far as pizza goes, I would say it's good, but not the best or near the best I've had.  It was kind of greasy.  Overall, just 'meh' The beer, on the other hand, fantastic!! If our bartender would have had half a brain and all we did was drink beer, I would give this place five stars!  As a beer lover, I enjoyed both beers I had.  Surenderer, a belgian ale and their Iron Works Stout.  Both delicious!   Now, on to the bartender.  As I mentioned before, he took our orders relatively quick and got them right.  When I asked if we could do a half and half pizza he said ""yeah"" and walked away.  I was ready to order, but he just walked away.   Then came back about five minutes later to get our food order.  Really, dude?!  I realize this place is in Wicker Park, hipster central and he definitely looked like a true hipster.  So, I'm sure he couldn't be bothered to do his job...... Anywho, my boyfriend had an empty beer glass the entire time we ate, never once did he ask if he wanted another beer.  He also didn't ask us how we were doing after we got our food.  Once we were finished, he finally asked if my boyfriend wanted another beer.  He replied, ""No thanks, man, just the check, thanks"" After five minutes of watching him continually go to the POS and put stuff in, thinking our check was next to be printed, I decided to ask again for the check.  Again, five minutes went by and still no check.   Um, ok....  I asked AGAIN and finally he printed it!!  Dude was not that busy!   Seriously, I would save your time and money and pop in for a growler of their beer to go, and sit at home with a DiGorno's frozen pizza.  This place is not worth the wait or the hype.",0.9937,0.83,0.13,0.04,0.4322375382901699

I was on my third by the time my party arrived and I was only there for about 45 minutes soooo that was my last one. The three I tried from favorite to still great: 1) The Weight - I'm a huge hops fan so I'm a little biased. 2) Hefeweizen - almost as great! 3) Golden Arm - I'm a hops guy so this was a little weak for me. I would recommend to the ladies.... We ordered two larges. One red pizza w/Sausage, Garlic, Mushroom, and Basil. The sausage was good, I wished there was more basil though. We ordered clam and bacon on our white pizza. This was my favorite! The clam and bacon combo was amazing. They give you lemon wedges as well and at first i was skeptical but squeeze some of that on and you're in heaven....Thank me later. I was a little disappointed in the edge crust. I ALWAYS eat the crust but the crust was just kinda hard and bland...But I did eat some leftovers today and the crust was actually softer when eaten cold.

They serve ""New Haven"" style pizza here- thin(ner) crust than most other pizzas you can find in Chicago.  You have two styles of sauce- red or white, and you get to choose your toppings.  My friends always get the red sauce with pepperoni.  I prefer the white sauce with mashed potatoes and bacon. I could probably do the white sauce and mashed potatoes with anything else and still be happy.  Maybe I'll try it with clams next time. Mmm. The beer is also worthy of mentioning.  I prefer Piece's Beer in Progress which is a double IPA.  My friends love the Golden Arm (It's a Kolsh?)  If you find a beer you like, their growlers are relatively inexpensive.  You can buy a Growler for $16 and get a refill for $12.  Unfortunately they don't fill the higher percentage beers.  On Sundays, they have a take out special of a large pizza + growler for $25!!

The majority of the workers that I have encountered are the type that act too cool to even be speaking to you. And don't bother asking questions about their beers or food because they'll just make you feel dumb, one time they actually mocked one of my dining companions. This is such a pet peeve of mine and one I will never understand. You make your own beers, your guests want to learn about them in order to drink something that they would like and more than likely continue to order more. Why are you not facilitating this?  Additionally, its not a quick dining experience. I generally don't mind this because if I'm going to place like Piece I want to sit and enjoy a few beers and not feel rushed. Getting your first beer might take awhile though and you might contemplate going up to the bar to order one yourself. So if you're looking for a quick bite, this is not your place.  The food is good. I actually think the spin dip is my favorite on the menu. While the pizza is good, it's not my favorite. I love thin pizza, but this is almost too thin causing it too taste a bit mushy with the toppings. Also, beware this is not the type you take home and eat the next day, so don't over order.  Needless to say the pizza's good, but not good enough for me to be treated rudely by the servers.

2013-08-16,4.0,"People are very particular about their pizza- and if you like Chicago deep dish, or even a thinner, caramelized crust, Piece probably doesn't fit the bill. But there are plenty of other places you can go. But if you want some good, chewy, thin-crust pizza (technically New Haven-style) that comes in enormous servings with a wide selection of awesome toppings, this is the place. The restaurant itself has a great set-up, with plenty of TVs on game-day and live music on weekends. You can choose from an extensive beer list, but best to go with one of their rotating selection of house-brewed beers (you can even take a growler home with you). And since the large pizza is as big as a table, they put it up on a little tower so your plates and beers can still have room underneath it. I guess it also helps keep with the ""cheese transfer process"", haha. One comment I will make- they have 3 types of pizza, traditional red, new haven style (no mozzarella) and white (no sauce). I tried one of the latter two once, actually not sure which one it was because of the toppings, and it seemed very dry. Their crust is already dry and chewy anyway, but without the mozz/tomato blend on it in the oven it seems to dry out quicker.",0.9593,0.883,0.1,0.017,0.4710853035853036

Order a white pizza and your preconceptions about thin crust will change forever. Essentially this style swaps red sauce for a brushing of olive oil on top of the cheese. It's so fresh and savory at the same time that it's hard to stop devouring slice after slice. And the slices are huge. The beer selection is  dabomb.com  too. Piece is also microbrewery with a decently large variety to choose from. My favorite is the Flat Iron Stout named after the Flat Iron Arts building next door at the Six-Corners in Wicker Park.  Piece is one of the reasons why I just signed a lease in Bucktown.

It's a staple every time I go.  Baked goat cheese served in warm marinara with toasted bread. It's so simple, yet perfect. The cheese is creamy, yet not overpowering, and the sauce has the right amount of salt to compliment the cheese. If there's any complaint, it's not enough bread, though that's probably a good thing. I can only get through half the dish with the amount of bread they serve, but don't worry...they'll bring you more if you ask nicely. Pro tip- The app is pretty filling, go with a smaller pie so you don't end up stuffed and still have half a pizza in front of you.",0.9576,0.848,0.141,0.011,0.6088095238095237

2013-08-08,4.0,"I enjoyed the pizza but I don't drink. As such, consider this to be mainly focused on the pizza. It was pretty delicious. The pizza style for those in the know is New Haven. The base pizza price is normal however topping prices are not tiered, but topping amount is. Basically you'll pay for their topping but you won't see it on your small or medium pizza. Also, you wouldn't want to have the amount of topping that goes on a large, on a small. It messes with the harmony and balance you'd expect from a restaurant. This is why most places have tiered topping amounts and prices. There was another slight issue I had. There were quite a few areas of uncovered pizza. There are usually two reasons this happens, they may not have aerated the pizza dough before putting it in the oven (the bubble you may see) and or they just forgot to cover it. You need some area to grab your pizza but in my opinion, there was too much area. Their portions were nice and it was actually well kept as a restaurant. I enjoyed the atmosphere and having standard pizza toppings available to me at the table. The wait staff did an excellent job of tending to me and my friends.

I opened a new account with a bank and for my efforts they gave me a $50.00 gift certificate to Piece. Never been there. Never heard of the place. My fiancee and I thought, with her mother's birthday coming up, maybe this would be a good present. Naw. We looked at the reviews and were a little turned off and didn't think her mom and dad would really appreciate the place. So we decided to check the place out for ourselves; if the place really sucked that bad, well, we at least got fifty bucks worth of pizza and beer for free.  Off we went. Our waiter was very cool, laid back and knowledgeable. Since this was my first time at the place I just wanted to stay under the radar and not order anything too exotic. Sausage and cheese. Right? Right? Well, happy to say they didn't fuck it up and it was better than great. Had it the next day for lunch. Jen had a vegetarian pizza (can't remember the name of it) and she waxed it right on the spot--no take home for her! I did order one of their home brews which in terms of quantity was about right for the price. The brew (can't remember it) was a micro brew and tasted similar to Blue Moon. It was perfect. As I stated earlier, our waiter was very chill. What I appreciated the most was that he wasn't constantly coming to our table, while in the midst of eating with a chunk of pizza hanging out the side of my mouth, asking if everything was alright. It's OK once or twice, but several times while trying to enjoy your mate's company or eating, it's really annoying. So I appreciated that very much. When it was time for our bill, I didn't have to hunt him down--even though he had a lot of tables to cover, he was right on.  Crowded, yes.

New Haven pizza doesn't have much sauce on it either on their red or white pizza and one style doesn't come with cheese...odd. The toppings are good but you pay extra for the really good ones. The beer is typically really good with multitudes of fun selections of microbrews. In fact, we've hit the bar on a few occasions and skipped the pizza altogether.  Piece is right down the street from our daughter's home but its usually not on the radar. Ridiculous wait for a 'good' pizza doesn't typically cut it.",0.9553,0.711,0.183,0.106,0.49816250058185535

2013-07-12,4.0,"Piece in a nutshell: delicious pizza but not awesome reheated, good beers, relaxed/fun atmosphere. Wish they had a deposit system for their growlers.  Full spiel: Piece is good, always a solid choice. I personally recommend their sausage, onion and giardiniera pizza.  Sunday take out special of $25 for large pizza plus growler is great except that you have to go to the bar to pick up the pizza (if you get the growler) which means waiting in the hostess line, and then awkwardly standing in their 'waiting' space. There is no waiting space, so you're really just blocking a thoroughfare. Leading to that awkward feeling several Wicker Park places give you... the hipster staff is annoyed by you being in the way. (Wormhole, Bangers and Lace, Big Star, etc) Only other beef with them - have a deposit system for your growlers! You get $3 off your next growler by bringing one in. But what if I just want to return them so they stop taking up room in my apartment? You get $0. What about a coupon for a future purchase? Or just give me the $3? So I end up recycling them when I can't stand it anymore -bad system. While I'm on the growler topic - if you delivered growlers, that would also be excellent, and help with this issue. Aside from growler rant - favorite pizza place in Wicker Park (if we're not counting deep dish- then you have to go for Lou Malnati's).",-0.3348,0.743,0.126,0.131,0.5652777777777779

My fiance and I ordered a red pizza with pepperoni, which to me is a way to judge a restaurant on its pizza.  When they brought it out, I was shocked at the amount of grease on top.  I don't think I have ever seen so much grease on one pizza.  It literally poured off when I picked up a slice.  Taste-wise, it was pretty meh.  I would compare it to something like Little Caesars.  Nothing memorable that I would seek out again.  The leftovers sat in our fridge for over a week, which kind of says something. Our server was kind of an idiot.  When we first got there, we and the couple we were with ordered drinks... and then waited at least 15 minutes to get them.  Another server had to bring them to us, saying ""these have just been sitting up at the bar...""  When our server got back he actually admitted to forgetting about the drinks.  Duh.  I don't mind waiting for a refill but I need something to work on first! This is sort of a weird complaint, but the stands they set the pizzas on are too big for the tables.  You can't fit plates on the table because the stand is in the way.  My fiance and I both tipped our plates over and came very close to dumping pizza all over our laps because the plates stuck so far out over the edge and tipped over so easily.  Luckily we are not knife-and-fork pizza eaters because I think it would be nearly impossible to cut.

We were mostly there to drink but did order 2 sausage pizzas (red sauce). I really enjoyed the pizza. I did overhear all the boys at the table say they would of preferred more cheese. I thought they were perfect though.  I have a few issues with the place though that will probably keep me from coming back (unless my lovely coworker invites me again).  1. The beer. I love that that have a decent list and all. I was excited to try the beer they make though. They are a brewery and all. I wasn't impressed with any of their beers. The flavor was just off to me. I would of liked to of seen a few more very hoppy options as well.  2. The runner that dropped our pizza off literally threw it at is. I'm not joking when I say she ran up to the table and said nothing and threw it on the rack. I jumped! It was just strange.  I did have a pretty good time here though and wouldn't mind watching live band karaoke again. I should also note that it's loud in here.

There are other items on the menu like salads and sandwiches, but you'd be a fool to pass up pizza in Chicago.

Looking for a place to watch The Buckeyes game and never one to pass up a good pizza Piece seemed like a solid choice - a large brewery and New Haven style pizzeria with plenty of space, solid reviews, and a number of televisions - yet in reality what Piece actually turned out to be was a decent pie in a city where good-to-great pizza is the rule, a copious beer list that I'm told was exorbitantly priced, and service that existed somewhere between bizarre and disastrous as a young woman (with truly odd mannerisms) named Vivian first asked us to move to a different table across the room nearly fifteen minutes after we were seated so that they could squeeze in a larger group, and then proceeded to largely ignore our table, once forcing me to stand up to fill my own glass of water. Moving onto the pizzas, one savory and one sweet, our first choice of a red pie with parmesan, mozzarella, red sauce, and half mushroom/half artichoke was decent though undercooked - the dough soft but lacking much chew while the sauce was bright and flavorful, thankfully not overly sweet and thus allowing the fresh, tender artichoke hearts and garlicky mushrooms to shine.  Better cooked, and actually quite delicious, the dessert pizza ""inspired by Rick Nielsen and Rachael Ray"" featured a crust that would have greatly benefitted the tomato pie and with a bit of char adding a smoky note to the toothsome dough the dense lacquer of chocolate hazelnut sauce intermingled with mascarpone was sweet but not overly so - a nice ending (along with an OSU win) to an otherwise underwhelming experience.",0.9927,0.81,0.166,0.024,0.4413253413253413

2013-05-04,5.0,"I really disagree with all the ""bad pizza"" reviews here. I get that we live in Chicago and I get that we have the best anywhere.  Piece has some fantastic pizza.  It's just not your standard Chicago-style.  And that is ok.   Had to get that out there. We came in on a Friday night around 8:45 when the Hawks were playing. There was a 90 minute wait so we gave our name and went to hang out at the bar.  Yes, it is cramped, but there is beer!  And TV!  And, at least in my case, the bonus of excellent company.  So we didn't mind waiting at all.  I like that the host comes through and asks for you - hard to get missed that way, I think.  And we were seated just before that 90 minutes was up so that was a good thing.  I like when the estimated time is the actual time. We ordered a large pizza.  The menu says that this will serve 3 to 5 people.  For the record, the large is ginormous.  Bigger than an extra extra extra large that you might get from other places.  And thin, though not paper thin crust, slightly chewy - I like this, though some people do not.  It's definitely not even the Chicago definition of thin crust and that is fine with me.  We got sausage and roasted red peppers on the his behemoth and it was a great combination of toppings.  Maybe could have used a tiny bit more sausage but that was just because it was tasty sausage and more is not a bad thing.   And then there is beer. The beer list is not enormous at this place - there were maybe 8 of them. But we tried most of them and they were all excellent.  Loved the Black Mariah and we all really, really loved the Dark & Curvy - caramel-y coffee and bananas - might sound weird but it was actually super delicious.  Camel Toe and Surrender were also quite good.  Not sure we loved the Beer in Progress - it was extremely citrusy and a little wild.  Not bad but not our favorite. Decent service, though our server forgot to bring us plates and such when the pizza arrived.  She brought them but we had to go and ask her for them as she was kind of hanging out at the back of the area.

Nice ambiance in Wicker Park on North Ave on a sunny warm avenue with a warm breeze blowing through, chatting with friends over some beer. The pizza is thin crust, and good. Quality toppings and the flavor balances were nice. The portion of pizza we ordered w/spinach was nice and light, not overpowering. Our server seemed quite ""meh"" about things - but it was during a Bulls playoff game, so I think she was probably watching the game part of the time, which, actually, doesn't really bother me that much. Servers are people too.... I think it comes down to your feeling on beer. If you love love love homemade microbrews and growlers, then you probably give this place 4 or 5 stars. Me, I'm not that into that scene, so I just focused on the pizza, which was completely adequate. My ultimate test was this - I went with friends while my wife was out of town.

The place had an excellent beer selection and the house beer was very good. I enjoyed the beer. That's where my enjoyment, unfortunately, ended. I am a life long Chicagoan and I know what I like as far as pizza goes. Moreover, I am from the south side and was raised on solid, real (read: thin crust) Chicago pizza. So, I am picky about it. Seeing as this place predicates itself upon the reputation of it's pizza, I am rating it accordingly. The pizza is pathetic. To me, it tasted like a low class frozen pizza at Jewel. I was horrified and amazed that anyone from Chicago would consider this a good pizza. But then, I looked at the hipsters all around me and it was clear as to who thinks it's good. Definitely not my kind of people nor would I expect them to have the same tastes as I do. On first bite, I sat silently awaiting my girlfriend's reaction. She take a few bites, looks at me, and states, ""This is horrible. It tastes like Jack's frozen pizza at the grocery store."" Yup, my initial take on this hunk of garbage was validated. I'm upping the review from one star to two for the beer. BTW - right after I saw my good friend who was hosting open poetry at Weeds. When I told him where I went he said, ""Man, I could have told you that place sucks!"". Since then, I've heard that from other friends as well.

Why do you folks card people when your place is full with kids? but that aside let's get back to the worst service ever. so we sat down at around 530pm on a monday night. the ""host"" girl was actually our server too. i found that a little weird and strange due to the fact that it was the baseball season opening day and both our beloved Chicago teams were playing their first games respectively. we ordered guacamole for an apetizer. my wife ordered a caesar salad and i ordered a small red pizza with mushrooms and spinach. the guacamole came, it was delicious but we finished the chips before the guac. so we asked for a little more chips. the pizza came and it was great as always. crispy and just done right. the extra chips that we asked for came after i had the first slice of pizza??? there was no server of whatsoever to check on us and how everything is or if we need anything. finally when i was 3/4 done with the pizza our server came to ask us how is everything. everything would've been much better if we'd gotten the salad that my wife ordered!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  and the server was oh i am going to bring it right now? What do u mean right now? i've eaten 3/4 of my small pizza!!!!!! so we just said we wanna cancel the salad. after that a gentleman came over to ask how everything is and he tried to apologize about us not getting the salad. my wife just started talking that she didn't want the salad anymore and this guy just walked away!!!! it's gonna take a huge miracle for us to go back to this place again.  wish there was negative stars on yelp",0.9686,0.814,0.119,0.067,0.5063191438191438

2013-03-22,1.0,"Now, I'm going to totally admit the only reason my family and I even came to this entirely out-of-the-way pizza joint was the fact that Rick Nielsen of Cheap Trick fame is/was a co-owner. The hesitation to recommend the place by people we know who had already eaten at the restaurant should have been a red flag right off the bat. The pizza is pretty bad, the pre-made combinations bland and minimal on ingredients so they can upcharge you on extras. And for such a ""quintessentially"" Chicago pizzeria, the thiness of their pizza is surprising -- it really goes to show you that those that love this place are transplants and non-natives. I would be honest in saying that this pizza was among the worst I have ever had, especially within the city limits! Their beers are honestly better than their pizzas, but still in the realm of being mediocre. I honestly think that the beer suffers from both the fact that craft/microbrewers believe all their beer is as good as the established world leaders of beer making, and also that being in Wicker Park/Bucktown lends them an air of pretentiousness. The staff was less than okay, though I quickly got the feeling that they were way less edgy than they thought they were and increasingly more like rejects from the truly edgy Kuma's Corner. Rude and inattentive, they seem to care less about their job and their customers and more about socializing while on the clock. The look and feel of the restaurant is very industrial and warehouse-y. Nothing really stood out to me -- everything pretty much got washed over and mixed into one forever-enveloping steel blah. And they have a goddamn brick-and-mortar gift shop connected to the restaurant, like its the Field Museum or something! We went inside once, and I'd be surprised if the doe-eyed zombies working the counter actually knew English with the amount of grunts coming from behind their beards or pierced lips.

I loves me some thin crust, and I'm also amused by the hilariously long slices.  I am getting hungry now thinking about the fresh toppings on a delicious cheesy red pizza.  I usually get something really basic like pepperoni, roasted red peppers, and spinach.  Don't overload the pizza with toppings - the crust is thin and you don't want to weigh it down!  I've also had the goat cheese appetizer which is totally unnecessary (cheese + sauce on bread - wait....isn't that pizza?) and yet utterly delicious and always worth it.

We decided to attend the Piece Brewery NYE party and we really, really enjoyed ourselves.  The $75 price tag included AYCE pizza, salads and AYCD beer and mixed drinks.  Stellar price, if you ask me, especially since the Piece house brews were included in that price.   There was a bit of confusion surrounding the final details of the party, but everything worked out in the end and we had a great time.  We received different start times (email vs. website) and when we called to ask about arrival times (which were also listed differently in email vs. website) no one seemed to know when we could come in.  We opted for the 'earlier is better' attitude in order to secure a table, which was a good move.  If you want to go next year, be sure to arrive at least 45 minutes before the start of the party to get a table for your group.  By 10, some people were just left to stand because all the tables were occupado. Still, despite the confusion of arrival and start times, we had a great time.  The food was fantastic (as always), the beer flowed, the service was friendly and fast and the Live Band Karaoke was excellent.",0.994,0.755,0.217,0.028,0.6099537037037037

Not sure who decided that, or what their method of poling was, if there was a pole taken at all, but I would not say it is Chicago's Best, however, it was good. Plus, when judging Chicago Pizza, or any pizza, there are different categories - as far as thin goes, I would have to say Bertolli's Pizza in River Forest, Lou Malnnati's thin, and Pats are excellent Chicago Style thin crust Pizzas. As far as Pan or Stuffed, Gino's East on Diversey and Lincoln or Superior, and any Lou Malnati's Spinach are amazing, but both are different in their own way. Then my favorite of all, Authentic Brick Oven La Pizza Napoletana would be a tie - at least for a Margherita - Elio's Pizza on Fire on Lake St in Addison, and La Pizzeria di Nella on Fullerton East of Ashland. But we are talking Piece right now  I ordered a small thicn crust cheese, well done. It was done to perfection, but the sauce needs a little something - not sure if they need to add some basil or sugar, but it needs to be a little sweeter.

2012-11-24,3.0,"I'm still torn on my experience at Piece. Piece has been on my list of places to go in the city for awhile, not only because of the consistent great reviews I've read, but because how can you go wrong with pizza and craft beer? It seems like a winning combination! From what I have seen on the weekends in Wicker Park, if you want to go to Piece I would reconsider unless you mind waiting for an extended period of time. I went on a Tuesday night and later on in the evening, so my friend and I were seated right away. Our server was your typical nerdy cute hipster and the perfect balance between friendly and aloof. He was attentive with our drinks which is always a staple for me. Speaking of drinks, my friend and I love craft beer, but who in Chicago doesn't these days? Piece claims to pride itself on its beer, so we each ordered a different one. Neither of us were impressed, in fact we were both disappointed in our choices. Maybe my expectations were too high, but when they've won several awards over the years from the Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Cup, one would assume that these beers would be out of this world. Since craft beer is so popular these days, a lot of restaurants are trying to brew their own beer but they forget that it's more than just having the product at your customer's disposal; you need to make sure its a quality product that they will keep coming back for. Besides the beer, Piece is renowned for their pizza. We checked on Foursquare for recommendations, but the idea of mashed potatoes on a pizza wasn't exactly what we were looking for. We decided to do something we knew we would like which was spinach and mushrooms with traditional tomato sauce and mozzarella pizza. While we waited for the pizza, we decided to order guacamole and chips. It seems like an odd choice to have for a pizza pub, but with the limited amount of other appetizer choices it was the best option. We were both thrilled that we ordered the guacamole because it was actually better than the pizza. The pizza was nothing spectacular, but it wasn't the worst I have ever had. The sauce was decent, but it definitely needed more cheese. The small was the perfect amount for 2 people and it's served on a baking sheet so that adds a unique touch.  I did enjoy my time at Piece, but if you're going for the pizza and beer you may want to reconsider your choice.

This makes total sense because as you walk around you see large tables encircled by groups laughing, conversing, watching sports, and enjoying full pints and large pizzas. Piece doesn't offer that deep dish thick-crusted pizza that people think of when they hear Chicago pizza nor are they offering the gourmet style pizzas that are becoming more popular now days. Piece makes a thin crust pizza and that approaches the cracker style pizza as it comes out crispy but not quite that thin. I'm more of the belief that pizza crust should be chewy and pliable but I appreciate that Piece has their thing and does it well. I went with a New Haven style pizza (red sauce and shredded parm but no mozzarella) and really liked this style as I often say that cheese is often used to cover up mistakes. No mistakes here though as their sauce is legit. One of the best red sauces I've had. Their toppings are also fresh and awesome as our sauteed mushrooms were much more impressive than mushrooms you usually find on pizza. Given the sauce and toppings if the crust was more my style this might be my favorite pizza place ever and I haven't even talked about the beer yet. They offer their own brews as well as guest taps. If you haven't tried Piece's beer before you can get introduced to their offerings by going through $1 3oz samples.

The price of your pizza can add up quickly, as ""premium toppings"" (such as my beloved potatoes and bacon) are $2 each.

Wait times are almost never less than 30 minutes, and usually more like an hour to an hour and a half.

If you eat in on Sunday, be prepared for a long wait.  They have a Sunday special for pizza and growlers. Also, I had a party here, and they allow you to rent out the lower area up front or the ""deck"" up front for $25.  This was great -- I even did it during a Bears game, and they were very helpful.",0.9935,0.693,0.261,0.046,0.599428811928812

I'd definitely recommend the white pizza with goat cheese - I'm a huge goat cheese fan. It was delicious - and while it's not the best pizza I've ever had, it was quite enjoyable. My two guy friends ordered a pizza with sardines (or anchovies, one of the two) and pepperoni - and they didn't seem to happy with their order. I think that was largely in part to their ""great"" idea with those ingredients... yuck. For appetizers, we had the guacamole and the goat cheese appetizer. The guacamole was good - nothing special, but the goat cheese app was incredible. The only downside is that there isn't much bread included, so it's safe to assume you'll be ordering more bread (it's like a dollar extra, maybe.) I'd suggest ordering two batches of bread prior so your dip doesn't get cold like ours did... but I still wanted to lick the bowl, even when it WAS cold. For beer, we three enjoyed the Victoria IPA. We know nothing about ""quality"" beer (I may or may not stick to PBR most of the time for price reasons) but it was great and even better paired with pizza. I'd definitely recommend. Last but not least, the service was good. We had a nice waitress who was pretty attentive and didn't give us an attitude - like I've read on other reviews.

It was papery lettuce with zero taste dressing and anchovies thrown in.   The service is a conundrum, with some nice people, the hostess, male bartender, our male server.  But the snarky doorman and the rude female bartenders, just wow.   This place is extremely crowded, with a young crowd, and I know why.  I don't know why anyone would tolerate long waits in a crowded place for hit or miss service and just OK food in a really loud setting.   Was excited to try it, but bummed afterwords.  Many other places to enjoy good pizza without attitude.",0.8547,0.74,0.15,0.11,0.5264492753623188

2012-09-10,3.0,"When we moved to the neighborhood, this used to be our go to place destination for good pizza, but quite honestly I think that it's a tad bit overrated for all the press it receives.  The lines are always long anytime after 6pm most nights and the bar gets extremely crowded with everyone standing around waiting for their tables.  I also hate walking by this place as there tends to be 10+ people outside the door puffing away blocking the sidewalk at anytime of the day.  As such, when we do get Piece pizza, we typically order out and take it home since its so close to our place.   When we order from here, we usually get 2 mediums, cause who doesn't love left over pizza.  Our typical order is the New Haven style with mushrooms and spinach, and our favorite red pizza with bacon and onions (trust me you won't be disappointed).  On paper they also have a good Sunday special of a large pie (cheese only) and a growler of beer for $25; but who only wants a pizza with cheese not to mention that it's a huge ordeal to get the pizza and beer as you have to pay for it in the take out area, but pick up in the bar area from staff who don't really want to be helpful - so I no longer go this route cause its more a pain in the ass. It's a good local pie with decent microbrews, but I definitely wouldn't make this a destination eatery if we didn't live in the neighborhood.  I personally would rather go to Roots Pizza down on Chicago Ave as I appreciate the taste of its malted crust and the offered toppings there are little bit more interesting.",0.8513,0.791,0.119,0.09,0.5155583613916946

Take out service is quick and easy.  We called in an order on Saturday night on our way home, and though the restaurant was absolutely packed (they were running an hour wait for tables), the side entrance for take-out orders was painless and the pizza was ready right on time. We got a large, which is gigantic, and the crust was perfectly thin and crispy all the way through.  Unlike many thin crust pizza joints who cut the pizza into little squares, Piece's crust is so crispy, they are able to cut it in regular triangular slices, and not a single bit was floppy. We went with light cheese and extra sauce with added toppings of goat cheese and onions.  Absolutely delicious and the best part was that it was just as delicious when we ate the leftovers the next day.  This pizza is not cheap, but it's worth every penny.",0.9916,0.785,0.192,0.023,0.5879938513867086

So when I asked our snotty waitress if they had specials, she questioned what I was talking about and snarkily said that was for take out only.

2012-08-05,4.0,"The Bucktown/Wicker Park neighborhoods have become a hot spot for quality restaurants spanning a wide spectrum of cuisine. Just to name a few there is Ripasso for high end authentic Italian, Schwa for the wildest Michelin star meal imaginable, Violet Hour for creative cocktails in a chic ambiance, Big Star for tacos, Mindy's Hot Chocolate for James Beard winning desserts and so much more. While Chicago has the reputation for being a mecca for deep dish pizza, growing up on the East coast I have always preferred thin crust. Piece is widely regarded as one of Chicago's best thin crust pizza venues. As my condo was taken over by a large group of women (my wife was throwing a baby shower) I met up with a buddy for some pizza and beer (Piece is also a brewery and makes there own beer - but supplements their menu with additional craft beers). My prior visits to Piece have been during dinner where Piece is usually packed to the gills, extremely loud and has a lengthy wait for a table. They do open daily at 11:00am for lunch and I arrived just before opening and was the first inside. Piece has the ambiance of a typical microbrewery with the only difference being it is also a pizza joint. The main dining room is quite large, loud and there is a very casual ambiance (in fact one of the servers made for some good people watching; she looked kind of like Miley Cyrus will look like in a couple of years after she obtains a few more tattoos and piercings). There are several televisions (generally displaying sporting events) and the music plays a variety of Hip Hop and rock. The crowd is mainly young and with pizza being featured there are far more families with children (especially during the daytime) than at a typical brewery.  We started off our lunch with a round of beer. I perked up a bit when our server asked for my ID thinking that perhaps there was a senior discount; I quickly slipped her a fake ID (as I am not quite yet a senior citizen) but alas she simply had somehow confused me as a teenager. Aside from this she provided us with fairly good service. At lunchtime the pizzas are quite a deal; they offer personal pizzas for just $6 to $8 (depending on the number of toppings). While if you have a hearty appetite you may need to order two (or an appetizer), they are decent sized for the price. There are a ton of toppings to choose from with your typical items as well as some interesting choices such as mashed potatoes. You also pick from three different styles of pizza - Red (traditional), White (no tomato sauce) and New Haven style (no mozzarella cheese).  I opted for a ""white"" pizza with clams, mushrooms and bacon. The pizza was (as usual)  flavorful and very good and the beers decent.  If you are in the mood for some good thin crust pizza in a lively, energetic atmosphere Piece is a great choice. If you go in the evening (especially on a weekend) do be prepared to wait unless you arrive real early (or have a party of ten or larger in which case you can make a reservation). At least you can quaff some of their brewskis as you wait and engage in some good people watching to help pass the time.",0.9959,0.86,0.124,0.016,0.530400432900433

Also their beers are delicious. You can get a flight for $8. Amazing! The 3oz skippers cost $1 each, which blew my mind.  The bathrooms are a little skeezy though.  I'm really struggling with the 4 star rating because this experience was not a 4 star experience, but their pizza's fucking delicious and 3oz tests for a $1.

The red sauce pizza was the first of that kind I've ordered at Piece. I was blown away with how excellent the red is! It's got a really hearty and kind of garlicky (?) flavor to it. The barbecue chicken pizza was very good as well, but as someone who enjoys spice I was really disappointed with the giardinera. They need to use top notch stuff when offering it on pizza in Chicago ;) While the pizza was good overall, its inadequacy in this area just made me wish I was eating a Riot pizza from Haymarket instead. The beers were a lot better than I remember them from the last time I went a year or more ago. The spinach dip is not to be missed as an appetizer, although this time when we ordered it it seriously tasted like the chips were cooler ranch doritos, which they could have been if they weren't the wrong size. Trust me on this. They must have been knock-off ranch doritos. Strange. I always deeply appreciate places that can handle immense crowds well and since I brought my wife and kid with me on this outing I was glad to have been treated so well in a crowded joint to get seated in a reasonable amount of time.

At Piece Brewery and Pizzeria, New Haven style pizza meets microbrews in Wicker Park. How does Piece do so well when there isn't a deep dish slice anywhere to be found? We avoided the wait and loud atmosphere by ordering take out next door through Piece Out. It's a great idea if you are here just for the food. The cheese was chewy and oily and the crust lacked substance. The pizza almost sagged when you lifted it up. As a pizzeria, I wasn't that impressed. I'll have to try their more creative pizzas next time.  With over 1000 reviews on Yelp and a consist crowd of devotees, Piece has to offer more than this. Maybe they are known more for their beers since brewery is listed first in their name. That appears to be the case since they received awards for their microbrews.

Servers are usually rude and don't you DARE bring your child with you to dine there.  My best friend and I brought her perfectly behaved daughter there for a late lunch one day and our server was the biggest B to us just because we had a child.

I came here for the pizza and the beer, mostly.  Both were DELICIOUS.  I didn't eat any of the hipsters, but they also looked pretty good.  I ordered a flight of all 7 draft beers, each at $1 for a 3 oz. pour.  Here's my snobby breakdown of those: Golden Arm:  Typical light beer taste with the label of a traditional Kolsch Bier. A Lil' Strange:  Wheaty Belgian style ale with lots of banana notes and bites of clove. Dark-N-Curvy Dunkelweizen:  FRUITY FRUITY Wheat beer.  That's all I got there. Worryin' Ale:  Rye Beer that tastes very much like a red ale.  Malty, carmelly, and sweet(ish). Wingnut:  Imperial/Double IPA and tastes exactly as it's labeled.  Good malty backbone, lots of pine and citrus aroma and bite, bitter finish.  The end. Cap'n Kickass:  Maltier than the Wingnut, almost *too* malty, with a biscuity and citrusy aftertaste. Roland the Headless Assistant Brewer:  Nice dry stout with a bourbony bite to the finish. On to the pizza: It's hard to order here because I am the most indecisive person alive and there are so many choices.  Build Your Own Pizza is too much pressure for me but I think I did a decent job.  I got the White Pizza with bacon, fresh basil, and goat cheese and then added a ton of pepper and cheese.  I ate the whole damn thing too.  OINK.",0.9608,0.815,0.119,0.066,0.5150555555555555

The sauce has no flavor.  We had a white pizza with clams and a red pizza with garlic and sausage.  Both were terrible. I told the other couple we went with they could have the left overs.  To put this in perspective, I don't think I have ever in my life said I would never eat their pizza again. I've had all kinds.  It's hard to screw up a pizza and these people have done it.   Why the hell are the serving trays so big? We ordered two medium pizzas and for some reason they have to be served on metal cooking trays and each pizza has to be served in a single tray.  It's like when you are at home and everything else is dirty, you have to use this huge tray you never use.

I came in here on a Thursday night for a late dinner (dine in) and ordered a large, red pizza (crust, tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese) with fresh tomatoes, Italian sausage, and basil. I'm more of a traditionalist when it comes to pizza, so I don't care for mashed potatoes and broccoli. It came our relatively quick, which makes sense for a thin-crust pizza.  The pizza had a very good balance of sauce, cheese, and crust; and the toppings were adequately distributed over the entire pizza (not clumped together, but also not overpowering the pizza experience). It was delicious to say the least. But the big winner here was the crust. It was plain amazing. Crust and sauce is really what makes a pizza since those ingredients are usually made in-house (I hope), while Italian sausage, fresh tomatoes, basil, etc. are purchased from restaurant supply distributors. Technically anyone can get great toppings if they know the right people. Therefore, in my mind, what sets one pizza place apart from another is the quality of the sauce and the crust. Piece had one of the, if not the, best I've ever tasted. I would be totally fine withjust getting a large tray or bread and sauce. Yeah, it was just that good. If you're into singing, Thursday night is Karaoke night, so the place will be really loud. Unfortunately, when I was there most people didn't sing very well and their song choices were questionable.

2012-03-21,2.0,"I don't get it. Everyone raves about Piece, but I'm a little overwhelmed by the giant rectangle of relatively cheeseless, thin-crusted, wet pizza. Its heavy on the sauce and brick oven flavor, moderate on the toppings, and skimpy on the cheese. Its not a bad pizza, its just not on my favorite list. We ordered two medium red pizzas; one with chicken and broccoli, and one with mushrooms, tomatoes, and green peppers. I have been here before about a year ago and had pizzas with some of the meat toppings and mashed potatoes. Similarly, I had stared at my friends confused at their raving about the starchy sloppy masterpiece that they had created. I would appreciate the ""build-your-own pizza"" menu if Piece added a few more options and didn't charge so much for a rather skimpy portion of each topping. However, I imagine that any more than two toppings would cause the pizza to fall apart like the generic paper towel in the Bounty commercial. Popular toppings missing are pineapple, canadian bacon, green olives, and sun-dried tomatoes. Since I'm a fan of pizzas called ""the works"" or ""veggie lover's,"" paying for each vegetable topping get a little pricey. Still, its a relatively cheap group outing. The atmosphere is typically hipster and the space is rather dark and cavernous. The wait can get pretty long, but they are more than accommodating with reservations. There is an echo from the barn-like ceiling, so just get used to nodding your head rather than hearing every word that the rest of your party is saying.  All in all, I will go here again because someone else made the reservation. I will keep my mouth shut because nothing is really wrong with the pizza, but I will vehemently oppose adding mashed potatoes. Am I just a thin-crust hater? If you think so, ignore this review and enjoy folding your pizza.",0.9837,0.815,0.132,0.053,0.4942708333333333

Piece serves New Haven, Connecticut pizza, which is totally confusing. Well, it's confusing for an investigator like me who actually WENT to New Haven in search for the ORIGINAL Piece and came up empty. I even searched Yelp for pizza places in that town and they're all mediocre. Why the heck would you eat pizza from that place?! Rocket had the answer. He explained that the owner is from New Haven and that the trick is in the dough. They press it out by hand rather than flattening it with a machine or tossing it over head. This pressing technique gives Piece it's special crispy, cracker-like crust. I've got to hand it to Piece. The pizza is decent. I'm a deep-dish gal through and through, so thin crust just doesn't turn me on (hey! I know what I like!). Objectively though: the ingredients are fresh, the cheese is quality, the components are well assembled to create a solidly GOOD pizza experience. I absolutely ABHOR the restaurant experience at Piece. The tables are smashed together, it's loud, it's big, and it's obnoxious. It's like going to a huge sports bar. Seriously. Okay - I don't like sports either. But still, don't go expecting a typical pizza joint because that it is not. That's where Rocket comes in. You call in your order and your pie is ready in 20.

It's hard to screw up a Piece pizza unless your taste is really foul.  Only problem is, when the masses roll in, you realize how not-huge this place is compared to how huge it looks. And with wait times of 2 hours on Saturday nights... good luck. It's usually worth it if you can snipe a bar seat to wait in. When it stops being worth it I'll stop coming here on weekends. Weekdays are generally a lot less stressful and the pizza is usually a little bit better because they have fewer of them to make.

Pepperoni one is also amazing with a little ranch for dipping, but you'll have to bring your own. Note: the more toppings you get the more expensive the pizza. I suggest going in a four top and  splitting the bill. On average, $30 per person with cocktails.  Appetizers while you wait for your pizza: The greens salad (I literally crave this) or their guacamole (very authentic, must try). Drinks: Cider lovers, they have an extra large can with only 200 calories! Best time to go in: I suggest dining in during the week, although there is usually a wait. We usually put our name in and head across the street for a cocktail. Be sure to check back about 30 to 40 minutes later, their wait time is usually spot on. I've gone on Saturday afternoons too and you can usually sit pretty quickly then. I generally avoid weekends because the karaoke is so loud and the tables are so large you can't hear your friends. We love when we score a booth up top in the back, but only best for a four top.  If you take it to go, don't be discouraged by the phone staff who will put you on hold a million times, presumably because there is a customer at the pickup counter. I don't get why they'd risk loosing a phone customer who can just hang up, just to take care of someone in-store, who's already there and not leaving!  Knock out the phone orders or make that one person's sole job on the weekends, duh!

It can be a little overwhelming.  If you are with a large group you need a couple people to take charge and decide what to put on the pizzas.  We ordered one white pizza with artichoke, tomato, ricotta, and onion, and one red pizza with sausage, bacon, and pepperoni.  We just ordered them - didn't even bother with a vote or asking everyone what they wanted - but everyone was very happy.  We ordered 2 large pizzas for 8 people, it was the perfect amount.",0.9146,0.899,0.083,0.019,0.4993386243386244

Piece is definitely one of the best in the city! I've had all the different combinations with different sauces and I can't think of one time where I didn't like the pizza.  I also have to give props to the service. The place is always busy and it can get crowded on the weekends. I don't have an extensive knowledge of beer but the staff is more than happy to give some recommendations based on what types of beers you typically drink. Each time I ordered, the waitress recommend I try something different and I enjoyed the 3 types I got. So kudos to that. Also on Saturdays, they have live band karoake which is an attraction in of itself. After a few drinks, you'll have the liquid courage to take a stab at it. The crowd coming through it as diverse the Bucktown/Wicker Park area is. With large groups, I definitely recommend getting a reservation, especially on the weekends.

2011-11-16,3.0,"......Alright. First of all, we used to live in Connecticut and would often go to get New Haven pizza.  ( Which btw, is the BEST place to go if you're looking to get some good pizza. ) So we were extremely excited when we heard that 'New Haven style pizza' existed in Chicago. There was a 45 minute wait to get a table, which wasn't a problem. But as soon as we sat down, we realized that this place reminded us of actual hell.  I understand that you guys are trying to be Chicago's 'Barr pizza' but at least Barr has decent pizza. But if I could definitely pick out one similarity you guys have, (Barr from New Haven & Piece), you both definitely hire the dumbest staff members. Drunk people screaming, dumb slow waitress, people bumping into you when trying to eat a burning (burned) slice of pizza etc. Also the menu was so confusing and very un-new haven like.  Plain, Red and White bullshit really confused us.  Anyways, we ordered the large Margherita pie with garlic and it looked repulsive. All the diced tomatoes, cheeses were piled on top of a flat HARD burned crust like vomit. It was so wet that when I tried to take a slice, everything fell off. It was just a mess. The pizza wasn't bad. It certainly wasn't excellent. If we didn't get garlic on it, it would have been a pretty boring tasting pizza. Most importantly, the crust was so bad. I mean, as soon as we saw the crust, we knew it was baked in a gas oven. It was missing that new haven coal oven taste/texture/look. It was hard, dry and flat.  Anyways, we were not impressed with this place. We didn't even finish the pizza and we certainly did not bring the left over home. I'm sure some people love the atmosphere here. But definitely not for us. The guy who was sitting next to me was so close to our table that the pizza tray was practically touching his double chin. And not to mention, why the HELL would I want to go back to a pizza place where they sell guacamole and nachos. SO tacky. I'm pretty sure we won't be going back here, ever. Oh and please invest in buying a 1. new sound system. 2. cleaning products. What a tacky place.",-0.2706,0.727,0.138,0.136,0.47926089714882825

We had a medium Red with Italian sausage and mushrooms (see photo). It came out on cookie sheet and ultimately was enough for 3 people if you have an appetizer too.  Our server was indifferent and wasn't incapable of multitasking. She would take one request, go to the computer and then go to another table. The results were poor. Besides that our pizza came out quickly despite the fact the place was jammed on a Thursday night. My guess is that it doesn't take to long to cook since the crust is nearly paper thin. All in all, I will probably be back if I am in the mood for thin pizza, and I can tolerate eating among a herd of nerds.

If you go there, it gets so crowded and loud that it's impossible to actually have a conversation with the person across the table from you, who is further away from you than the person sitting at the table, next to you. The layout is bad. Even the waiters and waitresses have a hard time maneuvering their way around. Pizza takes forever to make, it's not filling, and at $2 per topping, no matter what size the pizza is? No thanks. If you get it delivered, it's under-cooked and soggy. Might as well start pre-heating your oven at home, as soon as you order it for delivery. Wait, scratch that, hold out for an hour and then pre-heat your oven, cause you'll be waiting a long while for your sub-par pizza.  I suggest going next door to Santullo's, for cheaper, quicker service. It feels much less like a frat house in there.",-0.7045,0.84,0.065,0.095,0.5151041666666667

For the last year I have ordered my share of delivery from tPiece with great satisfaction, so it was early on a Thursday and I figured there would be no lines and we could get a quick pie, here are the details of this failed venture. 5:15pm we entered into bizzarro Piece, our monotone waitress met us at the table instantly while I was trying to understand why our table was next to a pin ball machine and a birthday party of what looked like some yuppy spawn. One child was throwing a fit because he sucked at pinball, his mother calmed him down by promising him world domination. Five ambivalent teens were slouching against each other acting bored and taking up the aisle. A giant stroller with two kids tied down  was being forced down the clogged aisle to get the kids a chance at pin ball, they looked like little zombies staring off into the distance while pure inanity surrounded them. The beer came, and came some more.  Another large table was put together next to us in preperation for the exodus of asshats. 13 year old girls with Louis Vittons, the only thing at the table more expensive than their hand bags were their mothers face lifts. Fuck me Wicker Park was so much more fun when their were hustlers, hookers and heroin addicts.

Most people would be ecstatic for the grotesque piles of roni, but me not so much. I am a minimalist and this pizza had many other issues that I doubt were the norm.

It looked like someone had thrown handful after handful of incorrect ingredients on our pizzas. Needless to say, I looked like an asshole for talking about how great this place was going to be.

Don't get me wrong, I LOVE me some Gino's or Lou's, but when you're in the mood for the perfect thin crust pizza you come here. It's unique in that they model their pizza after a joint out of New Haven. It's served on really large rectangular metal baking sheets, so it takes up most of a 2 seater table. I went with a friend and got a medium. We both ate 2 pieces each and there were still like 8 pieces left...and they WEREN'T small pieces! My only complaint was that they put the leftovers in too small of a box so many of the pieces were folded over to make it all fit. If you take home leftovers, check the box before leaving if you want your pizza to not be a sandwich the next day.  My bf ended up eating the leftovers for three diff meals. The price was perfect and the service was ok. Not outstanding but ok. One thing to note is their great beer selection as this is a microbrewery. Also, I'm not a fan of pepperoni unless it's cooked my way and not too spicy and this was perfect. Nice and crispy, smooth flavored with a little kick, but not a lot. My bf and I have been struggling to find a place that can satisfy both our needs for pepperoni as he likes a thicker spicier type than I do. This one did the trick!

2011-08-20,4.0,"Since moving to the new neighborhood I've heard a lot of good talk about Piece. Word on the street was that they make good pizza and brew award winning beer - and there's always a long wait. This thursday we learned all three are true. I'm a Chicago deep dish pizza lover at heart so it's hard for me to get too excited about various thin crust options but piece makes a solid thin crust. They call it ""new haven"" style but that's likely just marketing. There are no pre-set pizzas to choose, everything is build your own and starts with one of four sauces: red, bbq, white and plain. Even though we arrived on the later end at 8:15 we still waited at least 45 minutes for a table and the place was always packed (maybe for thursday night karaoke??). I loved the feel and decor of the barn/brewery style. I could picture it on the side of a ski mountain out west if you added a fireplace and the loud noise of ski boots. The brand name beer was very good and deserving of the many awards decorating the walls. Ari and I enjoyed a sampler flight to make sure we didn't miss anything. Lastly, the value was surprisingly good. Three pizzas, one starter and some drinks we ended up at $20 a person all in with leftovers. We started with a very tasty and perfectly sized spinach and cheese dip with tortilla chips. We were all very hungry and needed something before the pizza arrived. I don't know exactly how long we waited but it didn't seem out of the ordinary. We choose three different kinds of pizza to try and share - red sauce, white sauce and bbq sauce. The bbq had mushrooms, the red had pepperoni and onion and the white was artichoke, spinach and broccoli. Each pie had different strengths and all were tasty. My favorites were either the bbq or the pepperoni depending on the minute. I thought all the pizzas actually tasted better the more they cooled as the sauce became more firm and the crust hardened. The bbq would have been even better with a protein like chicken or something to go with the sweetness of the sauce. I did like the veggie white pizza but just not as much as the other two. All of the beers were very good, which is an accomplishment when there are six to try. My favorite was the anniversary ale. I'm happy that our experience lived up to the good press and word of mouth. I would happily spend nights there drinking beer on a cold and snowy evening or a nice summer night like last week. The biggest complaint is the long wait for a table and sometimes the staff is a little preoccupied with themselves than the guests. The pizza's good, the beer's great and the value surprising. If the wait it too long next time we want to go I guess there's always the takeout window.",0.9989,0.767,0.22,0.012,0.5053694508106273

The crust is not as charred/crispy as it is at BAR, but it is pretty good. We were with a relatively large party when we went last night, so we ordered two large pizzas and a medium pizza. The first large was a white pie with mashed potato, bacon and artichoke hearts. For those of you who have never experience the awesomeness that is mashed potato and bacon pizza, you are truly missing out. The second and third pizzas were mostly for the rookies who doubted the awesomeness of the first pizza. The second one was a red pie with spinach, mozzarella and banana peppers. The banana peppers were key in this pizza -- they brought a relatively plain, but good slice to a much higher level of amazingness (the little red line is telling me that amazingness is not a word, but whatever). The third pizza was much more classic -- red with mozzarella, tomato and basil. It was good, as expected, but nowhere near as good as the other two pizzas. I downed all this pizza with some Golden Arm and Dark-n-Curvy Dunkelweizen. Good stuff. All in all, if you can't get to New Haven, this is really the next best thing.

We actually ended up getting a carry out pizza 2 days later for the aunt and uncle to try.  They loved it too! (And if mashed potatoes on a pizza is weird for an American, I'm sure they thought it was extra weird) I'm pretty sure they could grab me out of my booth and throw me out the door for no reason....and I would go back.

I knew I had stepped into someplace special when I walked in to find a 30! string guitar mounted on the wall and a table full of your 20 something hipsters next to a table full of uniformed soldiers.  Piece was just what I wanted to find in Wicker Park.  After having come to Chicago numerous times to eat deep dish pizza, I was skeptical of trying traditional thin crust pizza.  Thank goodness I did.   The crust and sauce were emphasized as what set this place apart by our knowledgeable waitress.  She was correct in advising us only to get a max of 3 toppings because the crust & sauce (the real essence of a pizza) were out of this world good.  The pizzas were fairly priced, and I guess cheap by comparison to food prices in Chicago?  The food was great, one of the best pizzas I have ever had!  The atmosphere was unique...in a good way.  Definitely worth a stop in.",0.9822,0.802,0.175,0.023,0.5511904761904761

My Fiancee and I went on a Thursday and SCORE it was a Karaoke Night, good for us because we love singing Karaoke! It was extremely crowded and we were told it would be at least an hour wait for a table so we muscled out way to the bar and had a Drink noticing the list was moving fast. After about 30 minutes a spot at the Bar opened as our name was called but we decided to sit at the Bar and eat. I loved the fact that you can order 3 different styles of Pizza but not feeling adventurous that night we went with the regular Pizza with Sausage, Peperoni and Bacon. I ordered the Camel Toe Draft Beer which is House Brewed and loved it! The Pizza turned out Excellent! Thin crust,Tasty sauce and meats and cooked to Perfection!  OK so now our tummies r full and the buzz is kickin in from the 9.5% ABV Beers so now it's time for Karaoke. So we pick our songs and get the request slips in early. The tone-deaf host starts the show off with a horrible song and you notice the non-karaoker's start leaving which was unfortunate because most of the singers were Great. We got up about 10 singers in and ROCKED the House! My Fiancee sang Black Velvet and had everyone singing along and dancing. I was up next and asked if I could get some help on stage with an Air Band and 3 girls came up to help, I sang On the Dark Side and had everyone in the crowd clapping and singing along with the help of my Awesome Air Band. That was so fun and the crowd showed their appreciation. The rest of the singers were great too but after a while we noticed that the Tone-Deaf Host was singing more and other singers were singing 2 and 3 more times. After almost an hour and a half people were leaving they were telling us how good we were and they were wondering why we weren't called back up yet. I guess we upstaged the host and his regulars or something so I asked if we were going to get to sing again and he said yes. I saw our request slips and it looked like we were next but after watching more singers sing their 3rd song so we decided to just leave.  Anyway to sum it up the Pizza was Excellent the Beer was Fantastic, the service was good and the crowd was Fun. Too bad they have a Karaoke Service with a Host that cant sing but does it often. Oh well I'm not gonna hold that against Rick...lol... but I sure will come back on a non-karaoke night or maybe check out their Live Band Karaoke on a Saturday.",0.9983,0.786,0.179,0.035,0.5463820901320902

2011-07-17,1.0,"Went to Piece last night after visiting a few time for beer and not having been able to get a seat. This place seems to be packed all the time. I've been to Piece after 7PM on Friday and Saturday nights and the wait has always been over an hour, so I never tried the pizza until last night. The atmosphere is pretty disappointing considering what it could be with the cool skylights and vaulted ceiling and rafters. With it's partitioned seating area and cheap looking booths it feels more like a Ponderosa than the hip and fun pizza joint they're trying to be. The place gets very congested and getting a drink at the bar can be a chore. They could make much better use of the space. I've always thought the beer was quite good and figured the pizza must be as well, considering the crowds. But it seems like hipsters will eat anything. The pizza was fine. Nothing like a flat-bread pizza from American Flatbread in Vermont. I've grilled flat-bread pizzas on my own grill that I thought were much more tasty. With a tall glass of beer and friends, it was good enough. The main issue I have with the place is the snooty staff and waiters. It's as if they think because they are so busy that they don't have to provide friendly and helpful service. I determined that I would never come to Piece again when our dyed-hair and tattoo covered waitress came barreling out of the kitchen with our pizza that was much too big for the table and shouted as she swung the sizzling pizza over our heads, "" MOVE YOUR BEERS UNLESS YOU WANT THEM ON THE FLOOR!"".

2011-07-15,4.0,"Overall, this place delivers on hype in terms of their beer. This is definitely a brewery that doesn't make any duds and their non-in-house, craft draft selection is also good. On a weekend, you're bound to wait 30-40 minutes, but that's a great opportunity to sample their beer. To me, it was just as much a part of the experience as the actual pizza. Traffic is definitely heavy throughout the restaurant. Like many things in Chicago, you're going to be waiting and feeling a little cramped, so you might as well relax and enjoy yourself. There is nothing spectacular about their pizza, but it's fresh and well made. The main attraction to me was the selection. There's three different sauces, and an impressive list of ingredients. Again, it's not spectacular, but they do what they do very well. They have no specialty pizza, it's all up to you. If you're not feeling very creative, look and ask around.

(I suppose I owe a thank you some guy named jerry and his party of 6 for splitting) Honestly I only tried one of their house beers and it was of course the Cameltoe. Not of course because I am some sort of deviant but because I love love love hoppy beers. Our waitress was a self proclaimed hop head and recommended it and also touted its high ABV. (9. something IIRC) This beer was quite good. Not the best IIPA I've had but quite good none the less. Other than that I was drinking Firestone Walker Double Jack since that beer is amazing and they also had it one tap. For food we got crazy. Much to the shock and dismay of our waitress we order a pizza with the following: BBQ sauce, Clams, Spinach No typos there, yes that was the pizza we ordered. Our waitress warned us that typically folks get the white sauce with clams and what not. We however bravely stuck to our guns and pressed on with our endeavor. And guess what? It paid of big time. So awesome. It may have been the high alcohol beer we were partaking in beforehand but this was seriously one of the best pizza's I've had ever.

Old review from my first time: I had been wanting to make it out to Piece for a long time as it is basically a marriage of my two favorite things, pizza and brew pub beer.  I finally made the trek into the city to give it a shot a few days ago.  First of all, the parking stinks... I know its the city, but it has to be said, I had to park four blocks away.  I sat down at the bar, it was a Friday afternoon, busy but not crazy, I had a lot of empty seats around me, it took 5 minutes for a bartender to get a menu to me and take an order.   Things started to look up though, I got their double IPA, it was pretty delicious and I weighed my options on the pizza menu.  I decided to go with the Plain, which I had seen reviewed by Chicago magazine as the #2 pizza in Chicago, however theirs was ordered with artichokes.  I'm not an artichoke sort of guy so I got my two favorite toppings, pepperoni and banana peppers.  This turned out to be a pretty big mistake.  The plain pizza does not come with mozzarella but instead just parmesan cheese which is pretty clearly stated in the menu.  I just didn't realize the parmesan would be put so sparingly on the pizza.  I felt like I was eating a really quite tasty pizza crust slathered with sauce, with lots of pepperoni and peppers mixed into the sauce.  I regret not ordering it just without toppings because I think it would have turned out better for me because I could taste the potential in the pizza.  I did have a second beer, their regular IPA and it was just alright, nothing to write home about.  I think this place may deserve another shot, but that might be a while.",0.9921,0.835,0.138,0.027,0.5012639012639013

If there is any sort of sporting event on TV, just don't even bother coming here, unless you are eating this as a second dinner or something.  Every time I come here, I sit starving and angry at the bar while waiting for my table, cursing myself for thinking this was a good idea. The bar does serve delicious beer, which they make in-house, but that can only satisfy my growling stomach so much.  When I finally get a table and order my pizza, I remember why I came to Piece in the first place. Delicious, cheesy, greasy goodness. The pizzas don't take too long to make after you order, and they have a lot of really unique options to personalize the pizza to your tastes. They will also do 1/2 and 1/4 pizza toppings, which is nice if you have picky people in your group. Its thin and floppy crust is a nice deviation from the typical deep-dish Chicago-style pizza we all know and love (swoon Lou Malnatis).  The pizza and service are 5 star-worthy for sure. I had to knock it down 2 stars because of all of the time I have spent waiting and waiting to enjoy said pizza.

Being new to Chicago, that wasn't really an option at the time, so I held off a few weeks. Ironically, my friend had a mutual contact here that he connected me with. When we were emailing back and forth the logistics of when we were free and I told her where I lived, she demanded we go to Piece.  So a few days later, off we went. We went during the weeknight which is most likely the only time you will not have a 2 hour plus wait. We got seated fairly quickly and perused the menu. Everything sounded delicious, but after a long day of work, we were more concerned with our adult beverage. Piece is known for their incredible Micro brews, so I chose the 'Dark N Curvy"" ( I later had the Mariah) and it was delicious. We then decided on making our own red sauce pizza and it was also delicious. Probably the best thin crust I've ever had hands down.  The service was amazing, the prices are comparable for the quality, and the loudness in the restaurant suits the atmosphere so you don't mind it.

Our favorite pizza is the plain style with whatever we decide should go on it for that day. Their plain style is less cheese than a normal pizza but has all the satisfying flavor because of the garlicky red sauce. If your on a first date I might suggest against another style ;) My favorite beer... wow... that is a hard choice. I would have to say it is.... not a decision I can make. Try every single one.

The best part was that we had tons of left overs (there were two of us and we ordered a medium). I'll definitely be back!

Ha!  Well, I feel that I have to throw in my two cents.  Definitely one of my favorite pizza places in the city.  LOVE their white pizza - so frickin' amazing! Could eat miles of this stuff. Also REALLY LOVE their barbecue chicken pizza - a little sweet with a little savory - SO GOOD! I'm not a beer person, but tasted the brew that my family was drinking, and I actually enjoyed it! The only reason why I didn't give this place five stars is because there was something about their regular pizza with tomato sauce that I didn't like.  Pizza is such a personal thing - there are so many variables - so just because it wasn't the best thin crust pizza with tomato sauce I ever had doesn't mean it won't be the best that you have ever had! But, their ""other"" types of pizzas were the BEST I HAVE EVER HAD.  In a Deep Dish Pizza city, I HATE all deep dish besides Lou Malnati's, so I'm glad that Piece exists.  Yay for thin crust Pizza! Yay for Pizza places in Chicago that only serve thin crust!  Bye the way, there service here is EXCELLENT! The place looked crowded - but we were seated quickly, orders taken quickly, Pizza came out quickly - was hot and melty and much larger than I expected - Portions are awesome - prices are typical - Beer selection is great.  Our server was really helpful, attentive and quite awesome.  Yes, this place is loud, but that is what adds to the lively atmosphere. Tons of TVs to catch your favorite sports team - karaoke on some nights.  Nice light from the skylight and fresh air from the open storefront.  Overall HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Plus, I'm a sucker for marketing - love their logo, and especially love their logo when it is adapted to commemorate Chicago sports teams!

Anyway - this one made it -- good-tasting crust with nice texture, really good sauce and the right sauce / crust ratio.  We ordered the regular red sauce pizza, but got half sausage/pepperoni/green pepper and half artichoke/goat cheese.  Yes, there were XX and XY chromosomes in our party. Only negative was the place is extremely loud.  And to top it off, they blare the sound system over the already loud voices, so we spent most of our meal yelling across the table to our friends.  If you know that going in and don't plan to do any important verbal sharing, you're fine.",0.9895,0.725,0.247,0.028,0.4998248128682912

We left for a drink, came back, and unfortunately were seated at what I'm guessing is the worst table- next to the hostess stand with people constantly banging into our chairs.  Next to us, patrons who didn't want to wait for a table set their take-out pizza boxes inches away and ate the toppings off with their hands in front of us (?) yuck.  I realize it's a popular place and they are trying to pack in more tables, but this one shouldn't exist. Our server was slow but it was a busy night, and she did agree to exchange my beer when I didn't like what I ordered.  She made some recommendations for us- one of our pizzas was a hit and one was a major flop that didn't even come with cheese? All of the pizzas are make your own and it would have been nice to have a few predetermined options so you know what you order will be good.

Maybe it has seen its fair amount of plaid shirts (although I have never personally been particularly overwhelmed by an abundance of hipsters at Piece).  And maybe the pizza isn't the best in the entire world. But it is pretty damn good. I like that it's thin crust in a deep dish town. Their red sauce is good, not too sweet, not too spicy. The toppings are pretty right on no matter what we've ordered (though we do tend to stick to traditional sausage, pepperoni, meatball, mushrooms, onions, peppers combinations). And my experience with their mashed potato pizza wasn't exactly revelatory. But, overall, Piece provides a pretty decent pizza. Also worth a try are the goat cheese appetizer and the salad with pears, pecans and gorgonzola.    Piece Beer, however, is OUTSTANDING! If I was judging their pizza and pizza alone, Piece would get 3, MAYBE 3.5 stars depending upon the visit. But their beer brings it to a whole different level (if I could rate Piece with a 4.5, I would). They have something to please every palate. My husband loves their paler offerings while I really dig their stouts and darker brews. Roland the Headless Brewer's Assistant is out of this world (excuse me if I just completely butchered the name of this beer).

My friend suggested Piece to me for a birthday dinner. They don't take reservations. We had a group of 5. Perfect for a pizza dinner. I got there at 6:45pm on a Friday night (the night before St. Paddy's parade and the dye of the river). It was NUTS. I was the first to get there so I put my name down. It is, btw, right off of the blue line Damen stop. It's a short 4 minute walk around the corner East on North Ave. I put my name down and the wait was 1 hour long. It turned out to be.. ONE HOUR long.. We didn't get seated until close to 8. We ordered a Large pizza and a Medium BBQ pizza. I think I had 9 slices. I don't eat the crust so I had more room to pack the pizza. It was great. I was starving. Between 5 people, we were able to down a large and a medium and leaving only 2 slices left.  However - I'd say a large is perfect for a group of 4-5 girls. and I use the term ""girls"" loosely. I ate like a Man. Great service.

Karaoke started around 10, and even though this place was packed, nobody was going up to sing. Six of us were able to get up to sing a song without any wait.  We had a super fun time!

So, we sidled up to the bar (sort of, considering the place was packed to the gills) and ordered a glass of their homemade brews. I opted for the deliciously sweet belgian-style Surrender and my friends tried the Golden Arm (a Kolsch beer) - both proved great sippers and even better matches to Piece's pizza. Speaking of pizza - wow! Fresh ingredients on top of delectably melted mozzarella cheese (we opted for the ""red-style""), perfectly cooked thin-crust, served by the HUGE slice. Our toppings included sausage, onion and mushrooms- mmmm. So good. I also ordered a Dark-n-Curvy , and though I liked the Surrender slightly more, this dark wheat ale was certainly not too shabby.

The lowdown, from my perspective:  Piece sells ""design your own pies"".  This means diners are required to select their own pizza style and toppings.  While this method allows for more versatile pizzas, I prefer restaurant-designed pies - ones that have been crafted by in-house professional pizza makers.  I find that this is the best method for obtaining the most delicious, well-crafted pizza possible. I think Piece's DIY/a-la-carte method resulted in an overpriced pizza.   Although Piece's pizza was tasty - the chunky goat cheese was a particularly good addition and the other ingredients were fresh - the crust lacked the soft puffiness that I prefer.  Also, the middle portion of the pizza was pretty soggy and there was an absence of seasoning and overall flavor.  I'd definitely eat Piece's pizza again, but with so many other Chicago pizza options I wouldn't necessarily request a return visit.",0.9144,0.903,0.09,0.007,0.525

I say with only slight hesitation that this is my favorite pizza in the city. I wish the pizza cooks would claim victory over the pizza's tendency to flop/sog/weep at the ends but the sauce is freaking delicious and the crust is crispy and chewy and yum. The Worryin' Ale and Golden Arm are perfect foils for mouthfuls of greasy cheese, and the mixed green salad is fresh 'n tasty.  In sum, I like going here for pizza but not so much to hang.

In the past 3 or 4 months, I've started to make my own pizza. White pizza, like piece, and I must say that I can make a pizza just as good as they can.

I live in the suburbs and we dont have to pay for parking (thats like charging for water). So when you are in wicker park, lincoln park parking is a huge problem. Im sure Piece makes enough money to buy a parking lot. Instead they offer valet after 5pm which is ok, but everyone knows how valet drivers treat your car. So no thanks. However, pizza and beer its outstanding.  Oh and me and my friend went there we order two pizzas we finished one and requested to take the other one togo. We bought two $20 pizzas and spend another 20 on beer. The waitress took away our pizza to put it in a to go box and as she walked she tripped and our Full pizza was on the floor. She came back and told us about the accident as if we didnt see it and said ""im so sorry, ill give you guys 20% off your bill"" so im thinking nice you know we wont have to pay for the full pizza thatfell on the ground. Well to my surprise she came back charged us 60+ dollars then gave us 20% off that so we still payed $50. What kind of legit business charges someone something that they didnt even eat. I asked the waitress that why am I been charged for the ful pizza if i didnt even eat it, yet ask to take it to go and she slip on the floor with it and she simply said Im sorry but it goes on our records that they pizza was made. So someone has to pay for it. Well Im sorry but why do I have to pay for it, if you were the one that slip on the ground with it. Point been i payed $50. for 3 beers and a pizza.

We got there at noon to stake out our booth for the game and too many others had the same idea. Tried out all the apps, the spinach/cheese dip and guac were my favs. The guac has a slight kick. We started out with a round of all the beers in sample sizes and decided with a pitcher of the worrin' ale. It's light, tasty and easy to drink in large quantities. I also had 2 pints of the Tripple, and huge glass of the dark and curvy. My hypothesis is that Chicago needs more bars that home brews.

We ordered the ""plain"" - the New Haven style without the mozzarella.  I didn't see how this could possibly be good.  It really, really is, though.  We had pepperoni and banana peppers on our pizza, and the tanginess of the banana peppers really complemented the salty pepperoni.  The selling point, for me, is the New Haven crust.  It's thin, but it isn't soggy.  The sauce is also absolutely delicious.   We also had salad - which was good - and beer.  They were both good.  The beer is obviously a selling point for Piece.  I especially liked the ""Dark and Curvy"".  (I find it pretty amazing how few brewpubs exist in Chicago.  Now that I spend a lot of time in Asheville, NC, it seems impossible that Asheville is a better beer city than Chicago.  But, it's true.)

My guess is the high ceilings contribute to the noise level, but I don't enjoy places like this at all. My boyfriend and I went with another couple and we were constantly having to repeat ourselves. The whole point of going out to eat with them is to catch up and when it's that hard to hear one another, it's no fun and really kind of pointless. We started with the chips & salsa and goat cheese appetizers. At $5.95, don't waste your money on the chips & salsa and save room to eat more pizza. For less you could either make or buy salsa that's just as good, if not better. If you enjoy goat cheese (I apparently don't) you'll probably like this one.  The real star of the show for me is the pizza (which now ranks #2 on my pizza list). As I really don't care for red sauces, a huge plus in my book is that one of their base pizzas is white. Topped with spinach and ricotta--amazing. I tried a piece of a red pizza that was also ordered and while fine, I wanted to hoarde that white pizza all for myself. I don't remember what sizes we ordered, but whatever the case, beware that the prices really add up when you start getting toppings.   If you want to eat here during dinner, I highly recommend making reservations.

""The Pit"" is down some stairs at Piece, where there are a bunch of small circle tables and booth style couches.  It wasn't exactly what we needed but we made it work by taking several of the small tables and putting them right up against each other to make a long table, still not convenient, but fun nonetheless.  I had fun where we sat as there was a big screen TV and pinball machine, and of course it was more private, but it could use a massive update with its design and Piece décor.   Our waitress was great.  I don't expect anything more from a University of Denver alumnus, which she was because she did a fantastic job with our requests, food prep, and check.  The service was sometimes a little bit slow but I understood with the weather being so poor that they didn't bring in as many servers.  It was also a Sunday night and there were a couple other groups in the Venue. The Pizza.  I won't yet say that it was my favorite, however it is definitely way up in the Top 5 places I have ever been to.  I had the red medium half spinach, half artichoke hearts.  It was nice to have an inexpensive pizza that had premium toppings.  The waitress told us that we had ordered too much for 12 people, as we ordered about 10 different types of Mediums, but in the end, everything was gone.  A medium is the right size for 2 people, however there are 12 slices per medium so depends on how big each of your appetites are. The Beer.  I had a great microbrew IPA called ""Cap'n Kickass"" (7.5%).  It sort of tastes like Gumball Head, but with less fruitiness and I would recommend it to people that like Pale Ales because it has a good kick to the aftertaste.  Overall, I would go back to Piece but not in a group.  I really want to try their chocolate pizza and more of their beer selection.  Windy City Pizza Club very much enjoyed the venue and it's time at Piece.",0.9912,0.851,0.121,0.028,0.40367372134038804

So we stood around and watched as all the pizzas came out of the kitchen. They looked and smelled amazing. We gathered around the bar, hoping to slide into a sliver of a spot to order but we were told they couldn't serve us food unless we were seated somewhere.

The beer: great stuff. We sampled the ""camel toe"" which packed a 9% punch and was a great beer (not just for the kick it packed). The other beers were well prepared.

So you can really be creative and make any pizza topping fantasy come true. My only complaint about our topping choices was that there was A LOT of garlic. I mean, a lot.

When I had a negative experience back in 2009, I was contacted immediately by the owner who not only apologized that the experience hadn't been stellar, but also made great suggestions for pizzas I might like should I try them again in the future. It is still slammed, of course, but the service has been great. Attentive, friendly, and even patient when one is indecisive! I'm not sure if there was just something off with the pizza that was chewy and greasy. I was advised to try something other than pepperoni on a white sauce, and try I have done. My new favorite pie is red sauce with pepperoni, bacon, spinach and goat cheese. Oh delicious!!! Another fave is their white pizza with potato and bacon. Mm... I skip the bar while I wait because I don't like elbowing bros still, but often order a pitcher with friends of my favorite beer, the Worryin' Ale, a brown ale with flavor packed into it.

2010-11-08,5.0,"Having eaten here over 100 times, I can write you an honest review from many angles.  1. The Pizza - some of the best I have had in Chicago, despite being from New Haven, CT.  It is thin crust, and the flavors are a mouth massage.  Usually I get their traditional red sauce pizza, but sometimes I get crazy and have the ""white"" pizza with sausage and banana peppers.  That is one of the best pizzas I have EVER had.  Often I get extra cheese, because they don't slop a ton on there and well I like mine cheesy.   2. The beer - AWARD WINNING for a reason.  My favorites are the Dark n Curvy and the Worryin Ale.  They also have a great bottle list in case you want to have something outside of their own brew. 3.  The appetizers - a very short list, but the warm spinach and tomato dip is very tasty. 4. The atmosphere - busy, for a reason.  so show up, put your name in, and stand by the bar with beers while you wait for your table.  There are plenty of TVs with sports on.  Thursday and Saturday they have karaoke, and it's good stuff.  For big groups they have a lower area up front so if you want to throw a party they will hook you up. 5. Takeout - right next door, call ahead and it will be ready to go! 6. Staff - very helpful and friendly. 50 stars in my book",0.9957,0.756,0.223,0.021,0.4613882669055083
2010-11-07,4.0,"It's said pizza is like sex. After a couple drinks, even if it's bad it's still sex/pizza. Piece earns major points in my book and has quickly become one of my favorite bars in Chicago. I say ""bars""... not pizza.  We went on a Saturday night for live band karaoke, which potential crooners beware, unlike your usual karaoke, there's no bouncing ball on the screen showing you the lyrics in time. You gotta know the song. This is great because it scares away some (but not all) of the people who suck and gives the people who know what they're doing a chance to shine. They'll give you a sheet with the lyrics on it, but if you're gonna go, bring some charisma because you've got a whole stage and band to work with. Sign up early because the set list gets really long. (For the record, I did Johnny B Goode by Chuck Berry and KILLED IT.) Like many other Wicker Park establishments, it features $2 PBR cans which helps keep the costs of a night in the city under control. They also brew their own beers. The Disfunction Ale was actually quite good. Sort of reminded me of Leinenkugel's discontinued Apple Spice, but with a fuller taste. The pizza is kind of a disappointment. I hungrily devoured three slices, but the composition isn't that great. It falls apart easily and makes everything messy. I can think of at least six places in Chicago that have better pizza. It gets crowded on Saturday but thins out a bit after midnight, remaining lively, so get there early. Four stars for the cheap beer, delicious beer, and awesome live band karaoke.

The space was more kid-friendly that I expected - it's a sports bar atmosphere with music, but not unbearably loud, at least not during the late lunch hour when we visited. I tried the oatmeal stout beer and liked it very much. So far so good. We ordered a ""plain"" style pizza (which means it has parmesan but not mozzarella cheese). After a longish wait (20-30? minutes) our pizza arrived with the crust looking plainly overcooked. Our server managed not to notice or care. The crust was hard enough that cutting it with a knife and fork for my daughter was a real challenge. It's hard to factor out this rather essential failing in trying to assess what the pizza might be like if properly prepared. To its credit, it was missing the thick layer of greasy mozzarella that ruins 99% of thin crust pizza in Chicago. The sauce was a little on the light side both in quantity and taste with a strong lightly cooked garlic flavor. Overall, this was a major disappointment for such a highly touted pizza joint, and the fact that our server seemed totally oblivious to the clearly subpar product she served us only compounded the feeling.",0.9345,0.766,0.143,0.092,0.5179086229086227

And even though I have to lug my luggage (is that why they call it that?!?) down the platform stairs and a couple blocks, I've not yet been disappointed. The pizza is thin crust--counter to what one expects in Chitown. And that suits me just fine as I'm not a big fan of the knee-deep style (sorry Chicagoans!). Importantly, the thin crust also delivers on crispiness. While that might be expected, not all thin crust pizzas succeed in this! Now on to the beer.  Yum. These guys and/or girls get it. They have about 6-7 on tap of their own as well as a broad range of styles that aren't their. If you like beer, you'll be happy at minimum. My only complaint (suggestion?) is that they offer an 'extra small' size pie. I likes me some grub, but I've yet to finish a small pie by myself. But hey, that probably doesn't matter because either a) you're in town on biz like me--thus expensing it and not worried about 'value,' b) local and thus either a1) with others who can help you kill it all or b1) solo and able to take the leftovers home.

2010-10-23,1.0,"I'll be very open and up-front about my 1 Star review. This review is based solely on their boneheaded growler refill policy. It is a real burr in my crotch. Now, some breweries (Three Floyds, I'm scowling in your direction) refuse to refill growlers because they ""aren't Three Floyds clean"" and they want to protect quality. That's pretty much self serving BS, but whatever. That's another review... Piece takes a different tack on this stupid idea. They will only refill their own growlers (read: it has a Piece logo on it). The bar manager on duty explained that this was because only their growlers were ""assured to be at the proper level of quality."" Proper level of quality? What quality? Advertising quality? Asked what the criteria for a Piece-certified growler was, she could only say, ""I only know we will only refill our own growlers."" Well, being the dork that I am, I lined up a Piece growler next to several others that I have. They all look the same. No special doohickeys... the Piece one even weighed in at 10g lighter, so it's not heft that makes a ""quality"" growler... Sadly, these people need to learn to get along. Beer is fun, friendly and communal. Do you really think that refilling a Revolution growler is going to spoil your beer? Or lead to an explosion that takes out my eye and lands you a lawsuit? Or are you just self-conscious and greedy - like I'm going to serve Piece beer at a party and try to pass it off as some other brewery? Sheesh. What's next, people? An MP3 player that only plays songs loaded through Apple software? Schools that only let white children attend? Filling stations that only allow certain makes of cars to fill up?  (Wait, sorry, bad examples. Have it. Had it. Will soon have it...) Not the world I want to live in! I'm going to stick to refilling my Half Acre growler at Revolution, and my Revolution growler at Half Acre. And you know what? When I do, I strike up a conversation with the employee and customers about how great those beers are. That's how it should be. Suck it, Piece. (Yes, I do get passionate about beer. Why you ask?)

2010-10-23,4.0,"I have grown up in the area for just about my entire life. So needless to say, I understand what Chicago pizza is about (hate to sound like a jerk but it is what it is). So here it goes before I go any further. This is NOT Chicago style pizza. I have told friends not to go here and expect deep dish. Piece is pretty up front about that since they come right out & say it.  There's Chicago, New York & the style they make- New Haven style. The best way to understand this is that the crust is more flat than thin. The way the dough is made and how it's cooked are totally different methods of cooking (that's a story in itself; I believe they call it ""apizza""). The texture is closest to Neapolitan style. The sauce is also a bit different and you choose from the following: red (tomato sauce and mozzarella pizza), plain a traditional New Haven pizza, a generous amount of red sauce topped with garlic, extra parmesan and olive oil (This pizza does not have mozzarella.) & white plain crust brushed with olive oil, diced garlic and mozzarella cheese.  I kept my pizza somewhat simple- I went with red. Now things get expensive once you start adding other toppings. I added sausage & mushrooms ($2.00/each). Still, the taste was very good. The rest of the menu is pretty straight forward- 4 sandwiches, 4 appetizers, 3 salads and 5 deserts. Portions are quite good as well.  I was fortunate during my visit since I went at an off peak time. While I don't live in the city, I would visit here if I were in the area. My only complaint is that quarters getting tight as the evening went on. All and all, this celebrity owned business (Cheap Trick's Rick Nielsen is part owner) is pretty well run.

We hadn't eaten since lunch that day so we were both very hungry and our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. We originally wanted to order two smalls with a handful of toppings (garlic, pepperoni, mushrooms, and spinach on one and chicken and bacon on the other) which range between $1.75 and $2.00.  Our friendly and knowledgeable waitress gave us the heads up to order one large half and half to save some dough. Very nice of her even though it ended up being a $29.00 pizza. She was very good with suggesting beers to our liking. The Camel Toe was ridiculously drinkable at 13.25% alcohol and very dangerous at that. That being said the service was a delight. The serving vessel for the pizza was a large sheet tray and anything smaller would not have been suitable. Holy shit the large is a lot of pizza. Needless to say we walked out with a half a large which turned out to be a full pizza box. Next time I think a small would have sufficed with all the toppings.  The brewery sets Piece apart from the rest. The beer list is extensive and have something to suit anyone beer palate. The place was pretty packed but the noise level was certainly tolerable. You could get away talking about pretty much anything and the people next to you would have no clue.  Overall I was impressed with the whole experience but then again its pizza.

It's pretty much solidified itself as my favorite Chicago brewery. Top Heavy Hefeweizen is my favorite beer, after all... Highlights from recent visits: getting more adventurous with the pizza/topping combos. My favorites were white pizza (definition: no pizza sauce on the pizza) with artichokes and bacon and red pizza (red sauce and mozzarella) with mashed potatoes, meatballs and garlic. And, it really is inexpensive. A small will easily feed two, possibly with leftovers, depending on how hungry you are. Another shoutout goes to the carrot cake on the dessert menu. The menu says serves 2, but that slice is a monster! I'd say 3, maybe 4. And I don't know if the Piece people make cakes, or if they bring it in from elsewhere, but that cake is delightful. Many moist layers of carrot cake layered with heavenly cream cheese frosting...The stuff of dreams! Oh, and the beer. There's always many intriguing choices. The latest occasion had their Oktoberfest beer (Oktoberfist!) on tap, along with Baron Von Awesome (a wheat beer), the aforementioned Top Heavy, and mabye 4-5 others, along with various guest taps.

I think she was more concern with getting the check higher for a bigger tip, well when we tipped her a dollar less then 20% because we thought the service sucked so much (we were both servers) and the barback wasn't going to see much of that tip, she turned her head and made a smirk type look.

Its pretty awkward to say that the best pizza (so far) that I've had in Chicago is a thin crust pizza, but dammit, the crust, the toppings, the sauce, not to mention the beers...are pretty damn tasty bro The spot:   Its in Wicker Park, kinda like san francisco maybe a little LA, but definitely a plethora of eclectic folks roaming around blended in with a few sports fans...all in all a good mix of people. Its a big space, but this places can get crowded hella quick. The food:   I got the italian sausage and banana peppers in my pizza (get your head out the gutter)...and i also tried meatballs with basil, which is my favorite combo.  The crust is very thin but a tad fluffy in the middle.  Not too much cheese on top, but the red sauce is what makes it hella good.  I think they just put the right amount of garlic,  tomatoes, and oregano in there to make it pretty flavorful.   Haven't tried the white or the plain versions yet, but definitely on my next visit. The Beer: The beers are pretty good.  Very unique, though being a beer aficianado, there's better stuff out there....not to say Piece's beer isn't great.  My two favorites are the Golden Arm and the Worryin Ale.  Both aren't too hoppy and are smooth, not too much carbonation. Next time I wanna try the Fornicator...thats right its called the Fornicator =p.  yay yay Overall i would give this place 4.5 to 5 stars.  Cmon its good beer and on top of that even better pizza Piece Pizza....me so hungry, me love you long time ^_~",0.9976,0.735,0.234,0.032,0.5211681547619048

The pizza is incredible too.  The crust is thin, crispy, and cooked to perfection.  You really can't go wrong with any choice of toppings, but I like mushrooms and black olives on the New Haven pizza and goat cheese and spinach on the white pizza.  I'd hate to taste what the garlic toppings makes the pizza taste like because the pizzas already have a pretty high garlic/onion quotient.

I am a pretty avid beer enthusiast and have tried the major Chicago breweries and they all fall flat compared to Piece. The selection isn't huge but they hit on all the beer types and each one is marvelous. If you are a beer fan you owe it to yourself to check this place out even if you aren't eating. The Camel Toe or Dysfunctionale are my personal favorites.  Now, on to the pizza. This is definitely a more contemporary thin crust establishment. The pizzas aren't cheap but they are rather large. A medium will feed 3 people with decent appetites. The ingredients are always fresh HOWEVER stay away from the Chicken as a topping. It's definitely of the the pre-cooked frozen variety and doesn't work at all next to the rest of the suburb topping options.  Side note the place is staffed almost entirely by hipsters and hippies. It's rather bizarre but they are friendly, helpful, and overall much better servers than the type of stuck up bimbos you tend to get up North. Anyhow check this place out one of my favorite spots in that area. But's it's no hidden gem since wait times during prime hours are rather long. This place is very popular and for good reason.

Once our friends arrived we started looking over the pizzas. We decided to get a large red pizza for the four of us - cheese/tomato sauce, good basic stuff. As for toppings, we chose the green peppers, mushrooms and onions. We also ordered the house salad, which was greens (none of that pussyfoot iceberg), red onions, cucumbers, a light sprinkling of Gorgonzola and candied walnuts tossed in a vinaigrette.  Our server was very attentive and brought our food out in a timely manner. The ambiance was ok - there were some unbelievably obnoxious kids that kept throwing their plastic cups on the floor, and their parents kept remarking on how cute they were. Ugh, wrangle your kids plz. Anyway, after some waiting the food came. House salad was awesome. Flavors were balanced perfectly. I could have eaten that all night. Pizza came out next. The large is, uh, very large. When they say it's hot, yeah, it's very hot. I probably should have given it a minute to cool before I tried to snatch a piece from it. Very thin inner crust on the pizza, and a nice chewy outer crust is good for soakin' up cheese/grease/etc. Loaded with cheese and toppings, we finished the large, though we stuffed ourselves to the point of overkill doing it.  I would say I've had better pizza in the city, though this was very very good and I wouldn't hesitate to go back if I was in the Wicker Park area.",0.9926,0.796,0.17,0.035,0.5342925170068027

We really enjoyed the ambience of the building and thought the bar layout was great.  What we figured out was to go straight to the back of the bar rather than fight to try to get a drink near the front (which is where everyone was waiting).  I'm a big fan of German beer, so when I saw dunkleweiss on the menu, I knew I had to try it.  It was a delicious beer, so much so, I ordered another one! The pizza came very quickly once we had ordered, and it also did not let us down. The server was also great and quickly took our order but didn't make us feel rushed.   Overall, we'd be happy to come back again, and we're prepared to wait.",0.9901,0.765,0.217,0.018,0.4296944444444445

Their crust is a bit chewier than I'm used to and they don't use too much sauce but that's how I like it.  My only complaint is that they don't put a lot of cheese on top.  However, this makes my cheese-hating fiance quite happy.  Since I tend to go for the veggie toppings (mushrooms, broccoli, spinach), I've dubbed this my ""healthy"" pizza place.  The toppings do seem to be very fresh. Their beers are also delicious.  I love a place that brews their own.  I tend to go more the Ale route and theirs do not disappoint.

2010-08-28,4.0,"I went to Piece last night for my friends birthday. When we got there we were told that the place is filled to capacity and that there is a three hour wait. So we could not even go into the place and chill at the bar while waiting to eat. Now I have been here before and know that there always is a wait but this was the longest yet. Because of the wait we decided we would put our name in and head to another bar and come back later and check on our wait. When we came back from the bar it was perfect timing and we were next on the list. The waiter was pretty cool and attentive to us. We ordered two different types of beer in pitchers. One was a light ale and the other a medium ale. The light ale was so so. I would suggest the medium ale over the light. We also ordered three medium thin crust pizzas. They came in a short amount of time. I couldn't stop eating the pizza that had the sausage and green pepper on it. It was delicious. Now I don't know if it was possibly because we had several drinks before hand at the other bar or if I was hungry, but that pizza was heaven in my stomach. The sauce on it is really good and it seems to have the right ingredients for my taste in pizza. They also served my friend for her birthday two huge pieces of chocolate cake and ice cream. I had a taste of that and it was pretty good as well. Also it was nice of them to do that for her.  I would definitely suggest trying out this place if you don't mind the wait. I know in order to make reservations there you have to have ten or more people in your party.

2010-08-21,5.0,"Was it the awesome thin crust singing ""I want you to want me"" or was that live band karaoke? I'm pretty sure it wasn't the pizza butchering Barracuda and Bohemian Rhapsody, or taking his rendition of Punk Rock Girl way too seriously. Actually that was me. And after a couple of camel toes (the beer not the lady pants phemonenon) I was pretty much ready to take the place by storm.  This was my first experience with Piece. They had three kinds of thin crust as far as I could see. We got a ""red"" which pretty much meant it was traditional pizza sauce pizza. You can pay for both traditional ingredients and fancy schmancy ingredients which cost more. We got a pepper pizza. Red peppers all around, and it was fantastic. I pretty much demolished it, not being accustomed to such a delicate crust. I'm part of a brash Chicago style tradition where we take a machete to our pizzas and top them with the souls of our enemies. My barbarian pizza tendencies took a while to adapt to the nuances of thin crust. There was definitely a learning curve. Once I learned how to pick up a slice without it flopping around and spraying everyone with toppings, I learned how to appreciate good pizza.  So it was Saturday night, and I felt obligated to queue myself up for karaoke. I did. Drank a lot of beers in the two hours leading up to my short gig. Didn't get drunk enough because I was still terrified. But I bit the bullet and got my ass up there and sang with all my heart and soul a song about a girl. And it was good. Although it was 2am and I couldn't find a bus home and pretty much had to wander and hop on random buses and cabs back to Ravenswood, I will find my way back to Piece one of these days.

2010-08-11,3.0,"I've heard a lot of things about Piece but somehow I've never been there. My youngest brother Joey was in town with his girlfriend, since they are home from college for a week break between summer classes and fall semester. Dave and I thought it would be a fun, casual place for the four of us to go and have good pizza and a good time. One note, Joey and his gf are both 20 years old, so we wanted to find a place that had a party atmosphere without being turned away at the door because they were underage. More on that later. We got to Piece at about 7:45 and were told it was going to be ""DEFINITELY A 45 MINUTE/HOUR WAIT"" by the host who couldn't even take the time to look up from his floorplan to smile at us or greet us politely. I gave him the benefit of the doubt, because it was Saturday at peak time and I knew the place would be slammed. We had no problem waiting an hour since we could put our name in and wander around Wicker Park and kill time. Actually, we had kind of anticipated a wait and were planning to do that anyway.  So off the four of us went, to goof around in the neighborhood, and we arrived back at Piece about a half hour later. When we went in to check on the table, and the doorman insisted on putting big, black X's on the both hands of my bro and his girlfriend...not a big deal but, okay, we get it, they can't drink in here. Dave went up to the host (who still had a bad attitude) and when he gave him our name, he looked at the list and declared...oh, we looked for you ten minutes ago and couldn't find you so now you're at the bottom of the list. This coming from the guy who had just said DEFINITELY AN HOUR thirty minutes ago. At that point I was a little annoyed because he said it would probably be a while before we could sit. But by this time we'd committed...so, fine. Well, good thing we didn't go anywhere because we were seated 5 minutes later. Dave and I ordered beers, which came promptly, but the waitress seemed like she was totally in the weeds, so much so that she didn't even give us her name. When the beers arrived, I tried mine and passed it over the table to give my brother a taste. A TASTE. For Chrissake's the kid is 20 years old, about to turn 21 in three months, and he's pledgemaster of his frat. I think he's tried alcohol before. He takes a taste, hands it back to me, and I kid you not, 10 seconds later the doorman comes by, slaps his hand over my brother's shoulder and goes NOT EVEN A SIP BUDDY. DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. Uhhhh...okay. We wont think about it. But seriously, lighten up.  We ordered two medium pizzas (one white pizza with Italian sausage and one red pizza with pepperoni). They were HUGE and came fast, but I personally thought both were really greasy. I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but the pepperoni pizza almost had TOO MUCH pepperoni on it. I picked some off, because in some bites it was all I could taste.  The white pizza was good, but it was mostly cheese and a little light on the garlic and olive oil, which I think are the best parts of the white pizza. I think if their crust was a little bit thicker, it would have held up to all the toppings. But hey, I'm a thick crust kinda gal. When the waitress came and brought the bill, it was definitely reasonable (two medium pizzas and two beers for $50), but I would have happily ordered it for carry out or delivery to be spared the attitude of the staff. There are so many PHENOMENAL pizza places in Chicago (Pequod's, Art of Pizza) where both the pizza  and the service are great, so I think I deserve to be picky when it comes to Piece. I've heard Piece is a great place for big groups and parties, which I can totally see. I would give it another try on a not so busy night, if it was another person's pick.

We all shared a salad of mixed greens, red onion, crumbled goat cheese and apples. With a light dressing, this made for a light and appetizing starter.

All I can say is DANG.  Seriously.  Mashed potatoes on a garlicky pizza with Italian sausage is freaking insanely awesome.  Other combinations we've tried were anchovies and clam on white, meatball and ricotta on plain, bbq chicken, clam and bacon on white... all were good.

It is an open faced calzone, or a pastry with marinara sauce and too much cheese. Something not pizza. So when someone first told me to try out Piece I was skeptical to say the least.  I could not have been more happy at being introduced to this place. After the first time I was hooked and spent many many hours at this location drinking up the delicious beers and eating the amazing pizza. The crust is perfect - not too chewy, not too crispy. The cheese they use is great, their sauce is perfectly sweet and tart, and their toppings are all really well done.  My favorite combination: goat cheese, spinach, and sausage on a red pizza. Awesome combination of salty & sweet (and healthy too, cuz of the spinach!).  Of course Piece is a microbrew, so I have to mention the beers. I am generally a fan of microbrews, and Piece is no exception. They do a great job and feature very finely crafted beers. I must recommend the ""Camel Toe"" or the ""Worryin Ale"". While I initially ordered the Camel Toe just cuz I got a kick out of the name, it's really a great beer. Very hoppy and it get's an almost tart-fruity flavor to it.  In any case, I'm back in New York never at a loss for some good pizza, but I have to say, I really miss Piece.

The toppings and sauce are actually incredibly tasty and well prepared, but I am not a fan of their crust - which I guess seems to be the major contention.

Also, because of the oblong shape of the pizzas, their plates are inadequate to contain many of the 'radially' cut slices!

And we like, couldn't find you"".  So i quickly reply, ""ok, well, if you recall, i specifically came out here to let you know where I was,"" obviously with no faith in this half ass system.  With no apology, remorse, and concern for a patrons well being she simply says she'll ""get me into the next table"".  These tatted up, indy high school drop outs could not have had a further clue about customer service.    I get that you drink PBR and draw on your Chuck Taylors, and that's cute n' all, but when you are at a place of business, act like it.   Despite the half ass service, the pizza was very good.  I think there pepperoni is some of the best; it appears to be something a little bit more traditional with spots of white fat on it that can only add to the overall flavor.   The ""meatballs"" were not really meatballs as much as they were ground beef, calling it ""ground beef"" works too.  This place is definitely worth a visit, but the owner needs to have a talk with some of their staff.",0.9792,0.852,0.113,0.035,0.38556842556842547

It was, as expected, delicious.  I'm a crust girl, and theirs was thin with a perfect balance of chewy and crispiness.  I also liked that it wasn't overloaded with cheese, just enough to cover, and cut into slices not squares, as pizza should be.

2010-06-23,4.0,"Came here with my best buddy on my last day in Chicago two weeks ago.  For a Monday afternoon, it was a lively place (world cup soccer, beer, and pizza can be quite a combination).  As a California dude, when I think Chicago I think thick crust (and Zacharry's Pizza Chicago Style in Oakland).  But Piece... well... makes Piece/Peace with the idea that Chicagolandia can be thin crust pizza land as well. First the pizza... I didn't realize a place in chicago serving up thin crust pizza could reign in chicago.  Here their pizza takes the thin crust pizza crown.  Their white pizza (sausage, sauteed mushrooms, and olives) was absolutely heavenly--the perfect saltiness and garlic-y-ness.  Sauteed mushrooms on the pizza is brilliant.  And to quench the thirst....the accompanying beers were outstanding (with names like the fornicator, full frontal pale ale, or disfunctionale...who could resist the intrigue?).  I had the worryin' ale which I found to hit the spot perfectly on a typical muggy summer day.

We ordered the queso de cabra - which again, I was skeptical... that's a Spanish dish... at a pizza joint?  Boy, was I wrong!  Delicious... so much so that we kept the marina sauce for future dipping pleasantries. Our pizza arrived shortly thereafter.  I was truly disappointed... our order was wrong.  The one ingredient that I dislike, was all over our pizza =(  We informed our waitress and she removed the pizza.  How devastating.   Now here's where Piece earns a place in my heart.  Our waitress returned with the incorrect pizza and offered it to us to gnosh on while the correct pizza is made.  She apologized and assured us that our right pizza was on its way.  Well of course, we ate the vast majority of this onion-laced pizza - which was still delicious, by the way.  Just needed to pick off those breath evil doers and I was good to go. Our waitress returned with the onion-less pizza and that was ALSO devoured... just a bit more slowly than the first.  When the waitress presented our check, she told us that they took half off the cost of the ONE pizza and that she would gladly box up the remains of BOTH pizzas.  So if I do my math correctly here... we consumed 2 pizzas for half the price of one... meaning we paid 25% of what we got.  Talk about great customer service!  I'm sorry I didn't get our waitresses name - I blame the fatigue of SF10, but kudos to her and whomever hired her!",0.9122,0.766,0.134,0.1,0.6133556547619048

But the ingredients at Piece are of a high enough quality that every combination is good - and some are phenomenal. We had one with Ricotta, Garlic and Artichoke was totally fabulous.  Surprisingly, I've almost been more impressed with the appetizers and salads - they make a GREAT caesar salad that reminds me that despite my squeamishness about anchovies, they are actually what I LIKE about caesar salad. The guac is also very good. And the beer, of course, is the award winner here. The Whitbeer I had last time was particularly good, as was one of their Stouts - and I rarely like either Whitbeers OR Stouts. Docked a star just because it is quite loud and busy.

2010-06-13,4.0,"Pizza and beer.  It's become such a common American food combination that it's surprising when a restaurant messes it up. Sadly, plenty have fumbled with the seemingly simplistic combination. Let's be thankful that Piece brings something fresh to the table. Piece allows you to select from three styles of thin-crust pizza: Red (tomato sauce and mozzarella), Plain (tomato sauce, garlic, parmesan and olive oil) or White (olive oil, garlic and mozzarella). You can then select toppings to add to your base. From spinach and banana peppers to sauteed mushrooms and pepperoni, they have it all. Unless you're Meg Ryan, they can probably meet your pizza topping needs. Usually a restaurant's suggested serving sizes aren't very helpful but Piece's would be relatively accurate: we ordered two medium pizzas for three people and had a few pieces to spare. Stick with the suggestions -- so long as you're not three grown men feasting after a long and arduous weekend. Speaking of beer, Piece's microbrews were tasty and well-crafted. I started with their Top Heavy Hefeweizen which was very flavorful and very hoppy. Their Wingnut IPA really hit the spot though; it was fresh with a sweet fruit start but ended with a very distinct hop finish. We didn't have any trouble with Piece's infamous wait so it was a great experience for me. If anyone's craving New Haven-style thin-crust and looking to wash it down with quality beer, get a Piece of this.",0.9636,0.89,0.095,0.015,0.4459325978680818

2010-05-08,4.0,"Piece wants to be three things at once:  traditional wood booth pizzeria, raucous sports bar, and quality micro-brewery.  It succeeds by varying degrees at each. As a pizzeria, Piece is scattershot, trying to satisfy a range of tastes rather than just focusing on one.  Here you'll find traditional red sauce and mozzarella style pizza (they call it red) and European style pizza on a plain crust with olive oil and mozzarella (they call it white) and  New Haven style pizza with red sauce, garlic and extra parmesan (they call it plain).    European style pizza is not their bag and their version suffers by comparison to the more authentic Neapolitan style pizza found at places like Crust or Coal Fire.  Their New Haven style pizza is not terribly distinct from traditional pizza and can strike one as gimmicky, while their traditional red sauce pizza is pretty good.  The crust is thick and chewy with a pleasing flavor and the oily cheese drips from either end when you fold it over to bite into it Italian style. As a sports bar, Piece is loud, crowded and not especially well laid out.  The best TVs for viewing are behind the bar which means patrons congregate in the narrow space between the bar and the seating area, gazing up at the screens, creating a bottleneck for the servers.  Those sitting at the bar know what a favored place they hold and don't give it up easily, so if you want to watch a game, you'll probably have to do it from your table.  But not all tables are well situated for viewing, which can be annoying if you're there to watch a particular game. Piece is housed in an old roofing company garage, a cavernous space with a high arched ceiling and a concrete floor.  The sound reverberates off the hard surfaces, amplifying the racket.  This is not especially a detriment in a sports bar but can grate on the nerves if you're just they're to enjoy a pizza and a beer. Say what you will about it as a sports bar or a pizzeria, Piece is an outstanding brew pub.  The hand crafted beer, brewed on premises in the seven barrel brew-house, is award winning.  Try the Dysfunctionale, a wonderful flowery hoppy brew.  Or the Dark and Curvy Dunkelweisen, authentically German and crisp.  They offer eight different styles as well as seasonal varietals, and they offer growlers for sale.   Unfortunately, Piece's desire to be more than one thing can shift the focus away from the beer.  The atmosphere is not ideal for relaxing and savoring and plenty of customers are there to bolt a Miller Lite and watch a White Sox game and couldn't care less about the estimable skills of the brewmaster.   But Piece packs them in.  So any quibble about misplaced honorifics is probably irrelevant.  Piece is popular, even if it isn't always exceptional at all the things it's trying to be.",0.9887,0.827,0.118,0.055,0.49055624269909975

They had already crossed off about 17 names after mine. The response I received was ""Oh, I didn't recognize you without the jacket you had on when you came in."" Say wha?!?! What do you do in the wintertime when people have coats?!? And why didn't someone walk through the bar calling my name (they had my first AND last name)?!? Or make an effort in finding me other than ""well, I don't see a girl in a red coat...next!!""  In order to make up for this mishap, we were squeezed into a table that was way too small for our party. Still, we were going to make due because at this point we was hongry! We ordered the white pizza and if you're ever at Piece take a pass on this. It's just crust, cheese, garlic, and olive oil. My friend's 8 year old daughter makes better pizza than this.  We were settled in our cramped table, me sitting on one cheek because my chair wouldn't fit all the way and there was someone behind me blocking the area where my chair should have gone, and then suddenly a waitress came over with a white pizza. ""Is this done enough for you?!?"" 'Scuze me? How ""done"" does cheese and crust need to be? She gave an exasperated sigh and even an eye roll and said that she was told we asked for our pizza well done. No, sorry, that wasn't us. Another eye roll and she was gone.  What is going on up in this joint?!?!? There are so many people out of work and would kill for a job, yet Piece is hiring these yahoos that treat their customers like crap. And the pizza wasn't even good enough to be worth all of this aggravation!

Given that, the one thing that never has let me down and my main source of praise for Piece is because of their beer.  It seems like every other restaurant with a brewery attached to it has some kind of Beer World Cup award attached to one of their menus to the point where it seems like they're giving these things out like candy.  I think very few of these are deserving of their braggart claims but Piece has great beer.  The Surrender is a great Belgian/Saison type of ale that I would be more than happy to drink in excess.  The Big Black Mariah is a great porter with lots of flavor and Dark Hefeweizen is faithful to the German beer style as well. The service is ok though at times some of the workers seem to have way too much to do, or be rather entertained talking to other employees.   The place can be an absolute madhouse on the weekends, so I'd suggest coming early or on a weekday night.  Sunday's ain't too bad.",0.9926,0.732,0.204,0.064,0.5548934240362813

The problem with the waitstaff is they get by on ""cute"". They don't provide adequate service, because they don't have to . Cute people will always get a good tip because people like cute people.  Cute doesn't last forever - so someone should maybe help them get better at their jobs. With all those tattoos and piercings - that is likely where a lot of them will be... forever...

I recommend the Dysfunctionale and the IPA. The Full Frontal Pale Ale is also good. The pizza--both red and white styles--is delicious. It's build your own style and there are lots of fresh ingredients to choose from. I haven't tried any of the appetizers, salad, or dessert yet (calories are saved for pizza and beer) but it sounds like they wouldn't be a disappointment, based on other reviews. Their Sunday special is awesome, too. Large pizza and a growler of beer for $25, takeout orders only. I can't recommend this place more. I take away one star simply because it can get insanely crowded and loud, and they don't take reservations for less than 10, but I'm definitely willing to deal with it. Their pizza and beer are totally worth it.",0.9889,0.767,0.233,0.0,0.5285101130753305

They have great, fresh ingredients and also rare and fun ones like mashed potatoes. yes, that's right mashed potatoes! There's also this amazing salad with pears, field greens and caramelized pecans that is the best salad I've ever had. Wash down your scrumptious meal with one of their home brews. There's lots to choose from. Not a big beer drinker but my boyfriend LOVES their beers. Our waiter Ryan was super friendly but not overly attentive which was the perfect balance. I totally hate when your server is always checking up or even nagging kinda.  On Sundays they have this deal for a large 2 topping pizza and a growler for only $25. TOTAL STEAL.

The hostess doesn't say hello but promptly informs us that the kitchen closes at 10:30pm and that we have 20 minutes to put our order in.  At this point we are well aware of the immediacy of the situation, decide on what to get while we wait for the table and are ready to go.  What follows next seems like deliberate stalling.  The server brings us water, says he'll be right back but disappears.  He emerges off in the distance and goes back into the kitchen.  There's only one other table there and a small party in the front in addition to our party of seven.  Finally with 5 minutes left to kitchen closing, one of our friends gets up to ask about our server and she tells him he'll be right out and when he does show up, he's got 'tude to spare.   We tell him the pizza we want, ask for two pitchers, are shot down on both counts and not given recommendations.  We ask for two different kinds, that he can do.  The rest of the meal went pretty alright except until the middle or what they perceived to be the end because he came up to our table while we were still eating to ask if we wanted the check now.   I've had some rude experiences here before and this one falls right in line with the rest of them.  We were out by 11:30pm.   Their pizza = nothing special.",0.9308,0.854,0.093,0.053,0.4393467643467644

The pizza was a disappointment for me.  It wasn't bad, but it just wasn't great.  I put it in-line with the pizza from California Pizza Kitchen.  Now if you like the thinner crust and subtle flavors, then you will probably like Piece.  I like more robust flavors and creative combinations from the restaurant.   They let you customize your pizza, but they don't seem to have much of an identity or specialty when it comes to their pizza. The service was good, but my waiter was a little too hipster casual.  I like the casually dressed staff (it is a pizza joint), but talk with some enthusiasm and ""act"" like you are happy to serve me.  He gave another table next to us crap for not knowing the difference between a wheat beer and a regular ale.  It wasn't in joking form, either.

Hearty as well with a lot of veggies! That made me happy since they charge $1.75/topping. The white pizza had meatballs and spinach. Fantastic!

I know we tried for my birthday earlier this year but the place was packed and the wait was too long.  That's when we went to Pizza DOC instead.  Well we are seated and we decide on ordering two pizzas. We order one large red and one medium white. On the red we get sausage and on the white we get sausage and bacon (I love bacon!).  The red pizzas have tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. The white pizzas have a garlic sauce, mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese. When the pizzas show up we are surprised how big they are.  They say the large should feed 5 to 6 people and the medium should feed 3 to 4 people.  Well these pizzas are huge!  We think they will feed more than that.  The large pizza cost us roughly $19 dollars and the medium pizza cost us roughly $18 dollars. Overall we thought the pizzas were just OK.  They were nothing really special.  I don't know if I was expecting way too much from Piece.  Or that Chicago is known for some great pizza places, such as Home Run Inn.  The white pizza had way too much garlic on it.  So much in fact that we left half the pizza at Piece and did not ask for it to be boxed.  Our waitress was really nice as she was apologizing for the pizza.  Both pizzas were actually burnt in differing spots on the bottom crust.  We did ask for the quarter of the red pizza that was left to be boxed.  The kids wanted it for the next day. So again we thought Piece and their pizzas were just OK.  We don't think we will really head back to Piece with all the great Chicago pizza places to go to (again such as Home Run Inn).  Sorry Piece, it was nice to actually try your pizzas without the huge wait but we won't be heading back.",0.9926,0.866,0.115,0.019,0.32877846790890264

Beers: I'm not a big beer girl (sorry)....I usually let my bf pick out something he thinks I'll like....I had a leffe blonde....and tasted some of the Golden Arm.....which I liked but didn't feel the need to order one of my own.

Well, in the age of conglomeration, the owners have hit on a real winner:  its all three.  Well, 2 out of 3.  Talk about a risk-free business plan. Starting with the pizza.  You can't go wrong here, and it really is a standout pizzeria in a competitive field.  Not the best, but certainly unique in its own right.  I've sampled a variety of their pizza options and all come through with smiles.  I love the presentation - a metal stand balancing the pizza on a baking pan.   Moving on to the beer, I was rolling my eyes on approach.  I mean, is this a cute side-project for Piece?  Actually, the beer is exceptionally good.  This is award-winning beer with real body and taste. So they have expertise in pizza-making, beer craftsmanship...and now this sports bar atmosphere?  Well, despite the TV's and proclamations to ""watch the games here""...I would advise against it.  The place is far too popular, too noisy to make sense of watching any game.  Expect to receive some elbows and the feeling of people breathing on you as they try to maneuver around an atmosphere as crowded as O'Hare on the holidays.  You have to be aggressive and sometimes lose civility to fight your way to a seat at the bar.  And occasionally (though seems more often than not) you will encounter a horrid collection of karaoke singers on stage - seizing the moment in a packed bar to embarrass oneself and add to the decibel. Slight disgruntlement aside, I do love this place and don't frequent it enough. Whenever I do, I marvel at how it is always packed.  What a successful operation!  Perhaps they print money too...",0.9901,0.763,0.18,0.057,0.5465952380952381

2009-11-05,5.0,"Yum beer, yum apps, yum pizza!! This place is fantastic! Living in Bucktown gives me easy access to some of the best neighborhood joints in the city and Piece is right up there with the best. The hubs and I enjoy coming here for a weeknight or weekday date night to grab a casual bite to eat. The beer list is amazing with all of the in-house brews ranging from wheats to pale ales to any and all darker brews. I can't say I have a favorite because it depends on the style of beer I have a taste for. Needless to say, no selection has ever disappointed.  When we're feeling especially hungry we usually start with the goat cheese appetizer. It's warm, gooey cheese in a spicy marinara served with garlic bread. Mmmm, yum and that's just the warm-up to the pizza. In Chicago we are spoiled by the variety and styles of pizza and you can't really compare a deep-dish to a thin crust. They're totally different tastes in my opinion. However, Piece would be a front-runner of the thin crust variety. Extremely generous portion sizes, 3 different base styles (red, plain & white. We usually go traditional with red) and a slew of toppings ranging from classic pepperoni to the more obscure clams, artichokes and meatballs. If you come with a group, it's fun to have everyone choose a topping for a truly custom pie.  Not only is Piece a great place to come for a sit-down meal but they're delicious fare is available for carry-out or delivery. This past weekend we stopped in on Sunday night to pick up a large pie and a growler to the fantastic tune of only $25!! Toppings are not included so that did add a few bucks to our cost but nonetheless it's a steal. We had more than enough food for dinner Sunday, Monday's lunch and a snack. Of course we didn't leave the beer around too long, it's just too good, so now we have an empty growler that we can fill to the tune of $12 the next time we stop by Piece.  The only downer to Piece is that it's so good that everyone likes to come and the place can get super packed. It's not uncommon to wait an hour on the weekends. I can't fault a place for being so delicious, I'm just suggesting a weeknight meal over a weekend one. Other notes include a dessert menu I've yet to try, I like to drink my dessert personally, and bloody mary specials on Sundays.

We placed our order of a white italian sausage and basil right away. Unfortunately, nearly a half hour if not longer passed until we learned that the oven had been turned off. My first thoughts were ""you're kidding me right?"" Your pizza oven of a very popular place for a Sunday football watching evening is shut off as our server informed only after she took the time to figure out why she wasn't clearing tables fast enough. For our inconvience, they offered us a free app. We were alright with that and ordered it since it was a planned lazy Sunday dinner for us. We never connected with the app, so she offered us dessert for later. Instead, the pizza arrived right about the point where I was too hungry to eat. Despite the long, agonizing wait for the pizza and the Packers loss against the Vikings, our food satisfied and hit the much needed empty stomach food spot. I loved the crunchy crust and just right crispy pie. Our wanton hunger completely overshadowed that she got our order wrong. Only half way through did we realize that we had an italian sausage and bacon pizza on our hands. At this point, we just didn't care and ate with wild abandon. Their pizza is delicious. I don't know if it worth as long of wait that we suffered. It's definitely better than our weekly standard pizza fare.  After consuming our pizza, we got dessert: a massive piece of chocolate cake and ice cream with cookies. The ice cream and cookies were alright; nothing special, but delicious nonetheless. Last night, we finished our leftovers. I had some of the chocolate cake. It's mounds and mounds of delicious chocolate.  I really want to give Piece more stars, but it seemed like they had a total service meltdown on a busy Sunday night. How does an oven get turned off during football season with a packed house? I just don't get it. Piece gets stars for making sure that we left happy and not completely unsatisfied with our dining experience.

I returned yet again last night with my boyfriend.  He had never heard of the place, let alone come in for the pizza.  So, being the good girlfriend that I am, I took him here to share one of Chicago's best pizza experiences wtih him.  And really, this place is more of a food experience than just a greasy pizza. We waited about 45 minutes for a table and the entire time we were there, even when we were walking out the door at the end of our meal, people were still streaming in.  They do a good business. We ordered 2 small pizzas.  It was def more food than two normal sized people could finish, but I insisted we have one ""exotic"" pie and one ""fall back"" pie with easy ingredients we both knew we'd like.  The fall back pizza was red sauce with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms.  And it was fantastic!  It really was.  My boyfriend LOVED it!   The exotic pizza was the white sauce with the clams and bacon. Yes- I've done the clams and white sauce before. But last time I didn't get the bacon on the thing. And the bacon was fantastic! Additionally, they put a TON of clams on the pizza which was wonderful! Nothing worse than being jipped on something like that. The clam pizza was almost more of a gourmet garlic bread than a pizza. But it was magical I tell you!   All in all, boyfriend LOVED his pizza, I LOVED my pizza and our waitress (I can't remember her name but she was a tiny little redhead) was great- especially considering the giant crowd of people she had to contend with.

2009-10-08,4.0,"I'm a little weird about pizza. Generally, I'm not too crazy about it but once in a while, it can be so damn good. The pies at Piece fall into the latter category. I came here last night for a birthday party. I was starving and this translated to order a large red pizza with a spinach, mushroom, garlic, and pepperoni topping AND a small chicken caesar salad.  The pizza was a beautiful thin crust with a lovely distribution of toppings - potent garlic (gotta have it!) and salty, crispy in some parts pepperoni and mushrooms and spinach. My absolute favorite pizza toppings of the moment. I scarfed down multiple slices and tried a slice of a white pie with spinach, ricotta and fresh tomatoes. This is also a great pizza - the garlic on the white pizza = flavor party in my mouth! After I was almost too full to eat any more, the caesar came out. Strange. I still ate it and it was pretty good - not too much dressing, anchovies (little heaven fishies), chopped chicken breast. Too many croutons though. I think I just don't like them. I can't fork them without them breaking apart!  The service was pretty slow but this place was packed on a Wednesday night and there were about 20 of us. I don't like dining in parties larger than 4, so I can imagine what a server nightmare we were. She was so patient and nice though! I brought cupcakes for the birthday girl and she offered to put them in the cooler, or to put them out on a display tray and bring them out with candles. I thought it was really nice to offer. However, I got pretty thirsty as the evening progressed and waited over 15 minutes for an iced tea refill.  So all in all, a great place to get pizza - the crust is sooo good! My only complaints are how loud it gets in here (you'll have the shouting at friends in loud bar sore throat when you leave) and that your clothes get saturated with food smell after you've been here for a while. We sat here for over 3 hours and all clothing (including my jacket) were removed and put in the washer when we got home.  For the beer drinkers: Piece brews beers!

We enjoy getting a disgusting combination of pepperoni, bacon, jalapenos and banana peppers. And when I say disgusting, I mean DELICIOUS. Obviously, or else why would we continue to get it. Have also gotten the same combination with sausage, as good. One time ordered the white pizza with grilled chicken, spinach and tomatoes plus a red pizza with sausage, onions and peppers. They forgot about the chicken on the white pizza and put more onions. However, it was still delicious, we just had a very onion-y meal.  Have had the ceaser salad, which is delicious, as well as the spinach and tomato dip. Both very good, but then I didn't have much room left for pizza. And the pizza is so good that I like to try to force myself to eat all of it, even though I can take home leftovers. (There are some in my fridge right now) This place is good for groups, although they only take reservations for 10 or more. And don't try to make a day-of reservation on the weekends, because they have gotten pretty snippy with me on the phone and have been like ""Uh, no.""

I figured I should also round out my review with a second thought... I realize I'm considered some kind of traitor to my fellow Chicagoans for rejecting the stuffed and/ or deep dish pizza varieties.  For those of us who worship the thin, dare I say, New York (gasp!) tradition of pizza tastiness, Piece is where we get our fix.  So many options for toppings and style (red, white, or plain).  Oh yeah, they're also a brewery so you're set for an excellent pint as well. Fresh guac and chips for an app and a delish salad and you've got one square meal to savor.  It's a popular place with no reservations for groups of 4 or less so keep that in mind when you're next jonesing for the best 'za in Chicago!  Worth the wait.",0.9466,0.831,0.137,0.032,0.4037311894454751

I had pepperoni and my boyfriend got jalapenos and both of them were delicious: the cheese was a little spicey and deliciously melted, and the pepperoni was crisp and salty, pretty much perfect.

Also, it is awesome that I can get Duvel at a place with pizza this delicious. The boy ordered a few of the Piece brewery beers, and although I didn't try them, he really liked both of the ones he tried.

Their stouts are always complex and smokey without being unbearable thick or bitter. I can't really recommend the Golden Arm Ale though, its as flavorless as a lot of macro-brews. I haven't been adventurous enough to try any other style of pizza other than red, but I've heard wonderful things about clam pizza. There are a few downers for Piece however. It get busy, really busy. If you are impatient don't even try going on a Friday or Saturday night. Its not a bad idea on a weeknight and their kitchen stays open pretty late. If you're bringing a pizza home, I recommend something to insulate the box with; the thin crust of this pizza makes it prone to getting cold rather fast. Their take home pizzas are also smaller than if you dine in, which also kinda sucks. If you are going to do take out, grab one on Sunday where you can get a 64oz growler with a large for $25.

In addition to their own brewing of beer (growlers can be bought to take home) this place offers a full bar.  They featured live music on their recent anniversary and everyone seemed to have a great time.  They're also a part of the Bucktown/Wicker Park food tour, which is pretty cool in and of itself.   If you're on this end of the river, definitely check out Piece.",0.9948,0.775,0.217,0.008,0.5522156084656085

I have friends who live in New Haven, CT and I get pizza every time I go there. I love the crust and the way it's slightly burned in sections. I think it's some of the best pizza in the universe. Piece does a great job of recreating this style of pizza in the Midwest. Yeah, it's a microbrewery -- there will definitely be bros there, amid all the WP hipsters. Yeah, you may be annoyed by them, but so what? Just go there with friends, sit there and eat your pizza, and then leave. Or, better yet, get it to go, or if you live in the area, get the delivery. The pepperoni is always a standard choice (and is pretty amazing as a white pizza with red sauce on the side), or the mashed potato pizza is actually really great and is a particular favorite of the carb conscious ilk. Okay, all sarcasm aside, why are you at a pizza place if you care about carbs?  If you're feeling particularly gluttonous, get the chocolate pizza.

Having recently been to Pepe's in New Haven, I thought Piece held its own. - The red pizza with pepperoni and mashed potatoes. Mashed potatoes? I know, right? But damn if it doesn't all work somehow. My guess is that pepperoni inhabits a similar place on the food spectrum as bacon, which is great with potatoes so I think that's where the magic happens. I went in thinking ""Wait a minute! You can't mix tomatoes and potatoes! Let's call the whole thing off!"" (heh) But then I thought ""Hey idiot, what about gnocchi? Idiot."" I am always mentally calling myself an idiot.

The four of us (my three friends and myself) had a bit of a hard time deciding on the pizza but they had the option of splitting their huge rectangle shaped pizza into two sides that allowed us to all have ingredient combinations.  We ended up going with a base of bbq sauce (not my first choice, but you gotta try new things) with one half topped with mashed potatoes, chicken and bananna peppers and the other half with spinach and steak.  Sounds like a strange combination (and not necessarily in a good way) right?  Delicious!  The ingredients were all fresh and I was pleasantly surprised with the way the combination fit together.

The beer, for me, was a big disappointment.  All of the beers were mild and ""safe.""  I understand that you have to brew for the masses, but any worthwhile brewpub will have a couple prestige beers meant for beer fans.  Just as a person who usually drinks light (or lite) beer won't like a hoppy IPA (at least not at first), a person who likes stronger beer won't really like a bland pale ale.  There are other brewpubs in Chicago that do a great job of having a wide variety of beer, so as a brew pub Piece was really lacking.  I tried 6 of their beers on my visit (through the 5 oz sampling option) and didn't particularly like any of them (I couldn't taste any rye in the rye beer!).  Like their pizza, the beer wasn't terrible, but just not something I'd seek out.

A large group of us got together on Sunday around 1pm and decided we wanted to go to Piece for lunch, but knew that getting a table with 2 hours notice  for 10+ would be a challenge.  We called to try to get a last minute reservation for 3pm, and as expected, we were told that they couldn't reserve something so soon.  Of course this was understandable and we just figured we would try to go anyway and split up into several tables if needed. Well, we showed up at 3 and they had managed to put something together for us anyway - we hadn't even left a name when we called earlier.  It was such a pleasant surprise! As for the meal, the pizza was good, of course.  The beer was excellent.  I was also struck by how great the service was.  I know how awful waiting on large groups can be, but our server was great!  She was super friendly and really patient, even though our table had some major ADD.

The neutral: the pizza.  Although intrigued by toppings such as clams and mashed potatoes, the banana pepper pizza we ordered was far from  extraordinary.  The crust was extremely dry and bland, and since crust is my favorite part, I was understandably disappointed.  I must point out that most people wrote the pizza to be great in their reviews, so I guess there is a taste for this kind of slice, but being the pizza snob that I am, I was not at all impressed. all in all, i wouldn't go out of my way, and probably won't be heading back to Piece anytime soon.",0.9576,0.785,0.144,0.071,0.6199186991869918

I have been here many times over the year's, but no longer go there, why you ask ???? The Pizza is very good to say the least, I love thin crispy crust Pies and that is exactly what they have, I alway's get the red sauce with sausage and onion, and sometimes Goat cheese , and I alway's order it well done as that is how I like my Za's. One time my ex and I had alittle bit of a problem ordering it well done, as they just would not listen to us, they brought it out pretty much white, and we replied with can you please make it more well done, are waiter replied to us with, more than this, and we said yes please make it brown on top, brought it out a few minuet's later, we replied with , no not well done enough yet, after the third try they had brought our pizza out to us in broken up pieces  instead of in a pie format, our waiter had said he was sorry as they had already cut it and they had just randomly placed the slices in the oven to brown them up... C'mon now,,, however the manager did come out and comped us for our pizza which was very nice of him.... I am a beer geek and alot of the brew's at Piece are excellent depending on the style.... They usually a rotating selection of killer IPa's and pales, as well as thier Golden Arm for their everyday go to easy drinker.. As noted by other's on Yelp, they make great Hefe Weizen's, Big and Curvy, Dark and Curvy ect ect....  However there sesonal lager's leave a little bit to be desired, ( again I am a homebrewer / beer geek ) so please keep that in mind..... They also make a wonderful stout and great rotating Porter's as well.... All in all , Jonathan Cutler is a great brewmaster to say the least, after all he did use to work for Sierra Nevada..... Hat's off to him... So why the one star rating,,, I'll tell you why. I used to go there when they first opened and they only had one beer on tap which was their Porter. The staff was nice and there were no long lines and no frat boy yuppies. After a few year's went by, every yuppie and their brother's started to go here, not to mention all of the Uber loud and obnoxious jock's that pack in the place on the weekend's and have no consideration for anyone whatsoever. One time my girlfriend and I had to ask these guy's behind us to please quit yelling in our ear's, and we like loud music and having fun, however when some drunkin jock yuppie deusch bag is literally yelling directly in you're ear, it becomes very annoying to say the least. And the waitstaff became very rude and unfriendly, don't know when or how it happened however it did. A bunch of arty farty wanabbee Wicker Park scenester's that think their shit don't stink, and  just try to get the bartender's attention to give you a beer, good luck as thay could care in the least. I have literally sat at the bar when it has not been that busy and still had to wait a good 10 - 20 mins to get a beer, they just kind of ignore you.... Again I really don't know what happened to this place as it was not like that in the beggining.....

2009-02-11,3.0,"I have very conflicting experiences about Piece.....  The first time I went to Piece I had an AWESOME time. I heard about Piece on Check Please and decided to go there with a friend. We went on a Saturday night, and the wait was an hour. We were told to wait by the bar and they would ""come find us"". I was a little skeptical. The place was JAM PACKED. I wouldn't be able to find Michael Jordan here, more or less two people who were drinking beer, blending in with the crowd. So we waited, and waited, and waited. At times, we got yelled at by servers who were trying to get to the computer (which is understandable) but there was no where else to stand. So after 4 beers, and 1 1/2 hours gone by, we decided to ask the hostess our status. Apparently we were called, but as I stated before, the place is like the most popular bar in a college town on a Friday night, so OBVIOUSLY we didn't hear it. We were seated about 10 minutes later (YAY!!) and ordered right away. We had the spinach dip (good, but not anything amazing) and a large pizza, half mashed potato, half veggie. The pizza came out fairly quickly (about 15-20 min). I was very curious to try the mashed potato side and when I did, I was HAPPY! It was actually pretty good! The veggie side was good as well. It was thin and I love the way it comes on a sheet tray...very casual, very efficient.  I raved about this place to my friend, so I decided to take her a few months later. We went on a Saturday night again, and we were told the wait was about 50 min to an hour. However, we were called in about a half and hour! We sat down and ordered the guacamole and a medium half cheese, half feta, spinach and broccoli pizza. The guac was Okay, it wasn't fantastic. The pizza was....BAD. The crust was HARD and it was so hard to bite through. In addition to this, there was barely any cheese on it, and they forgot the broccoli. When the waitress came over, we explained the problems to her and in return we got a ""Well if you feel that there is something wrong with it, then I can send over the manager, would you like that??"" So I said yes. The manager proclaimed that the pizza was ""new haven! new haven!"" and that this was the way it was supposed to be. He agreed that yes, ""i can see that there are areas here and there where there isn't any cheese, but for the most part, this is the way it's supposed to be!""  Okay......let me say this. I'm not one of those crazy people who go to restaurants and are SO picky that I complain about everything. I RARELY complain, more or less ask for the manager. I have been around the restaurant business most of my life and have worked in a restaurant for almost 9 years so I KNOW the ins and outs of crazy people who complain for no reason and I would NEVER do that. However, I have been to this restaurant before, experienced good pizza here and yes i KNOW what new haven style pizza is! I turned my slice over and saw that there were areas that were black underneath (which explained the hardness). That was it, I went back to munching on the guac, eyeing the pizza at the table next to us enviously, until the bill came.  Even though we managed to eat half the pizza because we were hungry, we went out for Thai food afterward because were were so unsatisfied. This is something a restaurant should never want to accomplish. The first time I went to Piece I had a good time, the second time I had an awful time. I'm not sure if I would want to go here again after the last experience, but the memories of the first experience is why I give it 3 stars.",0.9798,0.801,0.115,0.084,0.4924067685786435

Here was the problem, we wanted to order something different so we figured instead of mozzarella it will be replaced with Parmesan which is what it said in the menu.

I would even pay them extra to bring that yummy cheese creation over to my apartment. Hands down, the best pizza in the city..even though my boss Scott disagrees! My ex introduced me to this place a couple years ago and ever since then I was hooked. I get the same thing every time, red sauce with pepperoni and sausage extra crispy. That sauce..is....so....TASTY!!!  Go there for their beer too, it's rather tasty. I'm a huge fan of their Golden Arm, which is a German-style Kolsch Bier. Something else that brings me into the bar is their Karaoke every Thursday night @ 10:00 pm. Who wants to pass up a chance to make an idiot out of themselves...or watch other people act a fool. Other than that, the layout of the space is rather boring and boxy. The bathrooms are always very clean and the staff is always attentive and helpful. I have no gripes here. The live entertainment every now and then is fun to watch too. I will say that their advertisements are pretty annoying.

We did white pizza with sausage, tomatos, roasted red peppers, and mushrooms. The sausage was the perfect mix of sweet and spicy.

We would probably order from here a lot more , except that it really is kind of expensive.  Last time we ordered a medium pizza and a Caesar salad, and it was almost 35 bucks... kind of pricey for pizza night for two people.",0.9487,0.87,0.115,0.015,0.5666666666666668

I had the white pizza with fresh basil as my topping and it was delicious. Greasy and yummy and everything a pizza should be. However, what I didn't like was that the caprese salad we ordered had not quite ripe yucky tomatoes on it. I mean this is a salad whose basic ingredients are cheese and tomatoes, if you can't get one of the two right, maybe dont' send it out? Also we are in the prime season for tomatoes now, and what with the plethora of Farmer's Markets in the city, you mean to tell me that Piece can't find any that are deece? I was pretty upset by that. Also, no one really came to fill up my water which kind of sucked because I wasn't drinking beer, and was a little bit under the weather, but i just drank my husband's instead because he was feeling pretty beer-y and was neglecting his.

They all love this place and I've heard nothing but great things as well. I think what people need to understand are the different types of pizza styles. Piece serves new haven style pizza, which until then, I realized I'm just not a big fan of. The crust is thin and stale textured, there's barely any sauce, but mostly flavored with cheese, garlic, and olive oil (white pizza). The red pizza was a little better. The pizzas are cooked in a coal oven. I thought overall, the pizza was really dry and lack a lot of flavor. I can see how pizza from Piece can be healthy. They were really busy on a week night and they messed up our order, but we ended up getting a pizza for free.

For my first birthday in Chicago I wanted to do something special. what could be more special than live band karaoke and pizza? (I came from a city with no live band karaoke I was excited, I love to sing)   My girlfriends and I got make overs at Strange Beauty Show (which is awesome) and went to Piece. it was ridiculous crowded, but that means people like it right? So we waited in the rain and then waited at the bar and finally got a a table for all of us. we were the first people to put our songs in...In fact I was the second person, my friend Sara was first, and I put on my slip that it was my birthday.   So the ceiling starts dripping on us, and we get our pizzas. one was ok the other two were really gross. It turns out to be bear down Chicago bears night, so every other song is that...which is OK but gets a little old. so we wait...and one person from our table goes up...hours later another does. But me and Sara are still waiting. I go and tell him it is my birthday, and so do four friends as the night progresses. My friend Amber gets called up, almost last, and yells at the karaoke host telling him that it is my birthday and all i want is to sing one song and I was the second person to put my song in. he just points to his tip jar. It is apparent he had no desire to call me up at any point. She tells him to let me sing instead of her...and a few songs later he reluctantly calls me up. I sing my song. Last but not least...Sara, the first person to put in her song...at least 15 minutes before anyone else...is the last person to sing.   a lot of aggravation for crappy pizza, mediocre beer and a leaky ceiling.",0.9666,0.842,0.107,0.05,0.3944664902998236

Though at that point I was more concerned at who was going to be taking who with the pick before me, I managed to scarf down several slices. Really good pizza. Really good. Thin, but chewy, long triangle slices, (finally not square pieces!!), floppy which gave me a feeling of New York style pizza.  We had two cheese, one pepperoni and banana peppers, and one with spinach, black olives and mushrooms. All very tasty, all very good and all very addicting. Now I just need to make my way down there.

2008-06-30,4.0,"I'd agree that Piece Out (the takeout business) certainly has some consistency issues... One out of every few pizzas I have here makes me say ""I'm never having it again!"" ... Then just when you're almost over it, you order it again... and it's A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. ...  and that's what it was this weekend when we got it (pick up!). It sounds like lunch delivery to your downtown office is a bad idea, even though they do it ($100 order minimum)...  Let's do some math here...  The pizza comes out of the oven, cools for 5-10 minutes, they cut and box it. Piece is in Wicker Park.  Wicker Park is a minimum 20 drive by highway to the loop, then there's a 10 minute drive to find your office, then there's a 10 minute ring a ling ding pizza is here, someone go down and get it, then there's a 5 minute signing of the receipts, then there's a ""pizzas here!"" lets wait for everyone...  So minimally 20 minutes later you're consuming the pizza...   So in other words, by the time you're putting the pizza into your mouth in your Loop high-rise office, chances are the pizza has been out of the oven for an hour and 15 minutes.    It isn't magic, it's pizza delivery.. So even though it's an option, it might not be an option that best represents what Piece can serve. We ordered a medium this past weekend.  Red pizza.  Even though New Haven pizza is their style, they do a really amazing red pizza, and it's the one I'd recommend most (and actually, it's the one they recommend if you ask them for a recommendation).  It was $19 for a medium half pepperoni, half sausage (it's thin crust). Their medium pizza seems A) a lot more expensive than I remember it and B) maybe a little larger than I remember it. When you're ordering piece pizza, try not to do the ""half this"" ""half that"" thing...  Many places would only charge you for one topping if you get half pepperoni and half sausage or something, Piece charges you twice.   Also, their toppings menu is split into regular toppings and ""premium"" toppings.  For some reason, they've recently moved pepperoni and Italian sausage into the ""premium"" topping category, so they're $2/each.  I'm guessing they did this for no other reason than they're the most popular toppings... I doubt pepperoni prices have skyrocketed or anything.  Also, if you do 1/2 and 1/2, I think they charge you full price for both.  ...So their pricing can really be a sham sometimes...

Every time I intended to go there it was too busy and would have to wait like an hour for a table to eat their delicious pizza!   So my bf suggested we go on a Sunday afternoon--lucky for us there were only a few tables taken and it was a delightfully sunny day. We ordered the tomato-spinach dip to start. They give you a generous portion of that, but I could have used some more chips to scoop out the rest. We then decided on a ""red"" pizza and added sauteed mushrooms.       We ordered a medium and it was more than enough for two people--we took a couple slices home. The thing that I liked best about the pizza is that unlike many other thin crust pizzas, the pizza at Piece had a nice crunchy crust. So many others have a soggy crust and the pizza just falls apart.  The service was good, but then again how could it not be if we were  one of like six tables? Our server was attentive with the drinks and our food was nice and hot when it came out.  I am sooo happy I finally was able to try Piece!",0.9916,0.804,0.196,0.0,0.6749999999999999

That's saying a lot, but I won't go off on a tangent. I sampled a slice each of: (1) plain cheese, (2) spinach, mushroom & cheese, (3) tomato & basil. Which varieties were edible? None of the above. The crust was soggy, yet strangely tough. The sauce was salty beyond belief and I'm not sure that the red colour came from actual tomatoes. As I type, my eyeballs are shrivelling as their moisture is being diverted to my parched mouth and throat. I've been told that the pizza is pretty good at the dine-in location so maybe this terrible quality has something to do with the fact that we had delivery. I will probably never know. For a memorable experience with salt, I'd rather go with a therapeutic soak in the Dead Sea. It's mentioned in another review that this is New Haven style pizza. Well, I've had New Haven style pizza -- IN New Haven -- and loved it. This, this is something else.

2008-04-23,4.0,"After other entrepreneurs had faltered in their attempts to follow up the success of Goose Island [e.g.: Hopcats on Clybourn - What ever happened to Greg Moehn?]; this brewpub figured it out. Get an expansive location in a burgeoning neighborhood (not one which had yet to 'flip'). It also helps if you have a celebrity co-owner. Piece also was cognitive to cover its ass by offering guest beers on draft. Brewmaster Jonathan Cutler has shown distinctiveness in most of his recipes. I will remember the time he brewed an American-Style Malt Liquor [think ""Olde English 800""], and served it in a small brown paper bag. It was better than I expected. However your beer style preferences tilt, there will be a beer here of which you can consume multiple pints. From most indications, this venue will get higher ratings now that the State of Illinois' smoking ban has gone into effect. The penultimate time I was here, it was so crowded (on a Friday night) at 7:30 pm that after 20 minutes of being unable to get close enough to the bar to place an order, I left here for another Bucktown bar for 3 hours. After 10:10 pm, it was more manageable. There are a bunch of television sets tuned to a variety of satellite channels [DirecTV]. I even espied GOL-TV [the bilingual 24-hour soccer channel] on one of them. The venue *used to be* a participant in the 'AHA Pub Discount Program'. It has ceased being such. I keenly recommend telling your waitstaff there that it should reinstate. The pizzas here are good. The 'New Haven'-style pizza is especially satisfying. (Regardless of what you specify for the pizza, try each of the shakers containing additional seasonings which will accompany it. I settled on the grated cheese.) Is Piece a destination in and of itself? Yes. But, if you wind up in the Milwaukee | Damen | North neighborhood for some other establishment, you should stop in here. Transit Options: Another massive incongruity of the CTA is that the #50 Damen bus, which could connect you to a number of beerworthy venues, ceases running at 10:00 pm (northbound) - 11:15 pm (southbound). If I was on the CTA Board, I would have this route running between (at least) the Brown Line ""L"" station [4700 N.] and the Pink Line's Polk station [800 S., 1730 W.] 24 hours a day. The way out is the Blue Line ""L""'s Damen station. The Blue Line is the 'distant cousin' of all the rapid transit lines. It has one connection to the remainder of the system. It is undergoing major track rehabilitation (on a 25-year-old section! - guess who felt she so urgently needed a public works accomplishment on her record before the next election that this was constructed so shabbily?). You might encounter single-track operation. On weekends, you might discover the line has been broken in two, and you will have to take a shuttle bus between the disconnected portions. Unlike the north side main line, there is nowhere else to reroute these trains. The #56 Milwaukee bus runs until 1:40 am. The #72 North bus runs until 1:00 am.",0.8916,0.927,0.05,0.024,0.3718181818181819

I am admittedly not a big thin crust fan, but I have to say that the pepperoni was really dry and chewy and the spinach goat cheese was watery and chewy. My jaw hurt from chewing so much. It's still a decent place, and the mashed potato pizza we ordered last time was awesome, but as I suspected, the traditional toppings pizza failed to impress. I'd just as soon get pizza from Santullo's two doors down. Finally decided to come here after a friend raved about a pizza with mashed potatoes and bacon toppings.  It was good. I'm personally not that crazy about most thin crust, but this didn't disappoint. I was impressed with the size of the pizzas. Holy hell. We almost mistakenly ordered a large because we were starving, but our waiter pointed us in the right direction. A medium was more than enough and we had left overs. The beer was good. I started with the Golden Arm which was standard ok lager. But then switched to the dark porter beer which was a lot more interesting and satisfying. We had two waiters while we were there, and they were both great. Even when I didn't need anything, I saw him looking over to our table frequently to check on us. In large sports bar type places like this where you have a lot of people drinking beer and a lot of tables, I think the wait staff is more important than it is in most other places.   It sucks when you are trying to flag someone down for another beer and they are across a large room, serving a table of 10. If the service was just ok, I probably would give piece 3 -3 1/2 stars. But the service was able to put it to 4.",0.9741,0.769,0.148,0.083,0.5100590623846437

However, I wish I had thought to read some reviews before heading over last night.  I met a bunch of girl friends, one who usually only drinks wine.  We wondered if they served wine, and found out they do have some white and red choices.  After the discussion with the waitress, I thought that a red wine actually sounded nice instead of beer, and after her glowing suggestion of the pinot noir (her ""favorite""), I decided to have a glass as well. Ok, obviously it was our fault not to ask for prices, as wine is not listed on the menu along with the beer pricing.  A bunch more girls show up, and everyone else pretty much goes the wine route. A few people threw in money before the check arrived; we all are thinking this is house wine, can't be more than $6-$7 per glass, and when I asked the price on the pinot noir to throw in my share as well, we all about fell out of our chairs to find out they were $11?!  And the rest of their wines are all $9-$11! Crap, I wish I had read abigail c.'s review, as like I said, we really can't fault anyone but ourselves, but nobody could believe it.  I'm glad I only had 2 glasses, but I know the rest of our party was not happy as they had a few more than I. The pizza was great: a large ""Red"" with goat cheese, spinach, garlic, olives & banana peppers; and I am interested to try out the new $25 large 'za + growler pick up special on Sundays.  I just won't order wine at Piece again.  Even if the wine tasted okay, I never pay more than $8 per glass when going out, I'd rather splurge & drink a nice bottle at home.",0.9866,0.828,0.144,0.028,0.49012368583797156

Atmosphere:  So I am of spirit that a pizzeria should have a stereotypical guy named Luigi and have old pictures of little Italy, but Piece blows that out of the water.  Its a sports bar-esque joint with fairly good techno (insh insh insh) and multiple flat screen TVs so you can watch the Chicago Bull suffer miserable.  Seating usually for people of 4, but we rolled in 10 deep and were easily accommodated.     Service:  Fairly attentive, and I dug the ""grunge band"" look of our server Food:  The pizza was QUITE tasty, and admittedly I was a little surprised.  Piece offers you different sauce options and a myriad of different toppings, which include your standard fare but also interesting additions such as artichokes and yes... mashed potatoes.  We got a meat lovers for the carnivores in our group and a veggie delight for the rest of us.  The pizza was terrific though it all slid off the thin crust when I picked it up.  This place is of the thin crust persuasion, so you deep dish fans might be not be satiated.  A large pizza is a proper large (i.e. 2 foot wide)  and probably is good for 4 normal people, or 6 super tiny girls.      Mommy Factor:  I am sure my mom would rock out to the Nirvana that made it the playlist here, and its pretty sanitary to bring the kids out with. Date Factor:  This will not winner them over for Chic and cultured, but this is fun and tasty place for a date.  Bling:  1 large pizza ran around 20 bucks depending on what toppings you ordered.  On the account that it can feed up to 4-5 people that's not too bad in my book.  Drinks range from $2 cokes to more expensive brews.  All in All a satisfying meal sans drinks will run 8-10 bucks per person.  Not too shabby.

2007-10-29,4.0,"I really like Piece because they offer a big open space and great atmosphere.  I have been there a number of times, but last Saturday night I went there to celebrate a friend's birthday before heading to the Double Door.  We had a large raised area to ourselves which was great.  Everyone started off with some of their self made brew which was very tasty.  Then we ordered a bunch of different pizzas and started to settle in for some fun.  The pizzas arrived and we all were digging in.  I had a slice of white pizza with spinach and mushrooms as well as a slice of pepperoni.  Both were very good.  The crust was crispy but still had that floppy quality you like when you pick up a slice.  By this time the place was really crowded, so we didn't happen to notice that a tiny older woman had slipped in behind our table.  Unfortunately, she took the cash out of my wallet and another girl's wallet before one of the staff saw her from across the bar.  He tried to catch her but she took off in a white minivan getaway car that was waiting out front!  Myself and the other girl had no idea what was going on....talk about excitement and drama.  We ended up sitting in a cop car out front while the manager gave a description on her.  This was definitely a freak thing, and the manager felt awful.  He was great though, and gave us both significant gift certificates for the next couple of times we came in.  I know this is a weird situation, and upon careful consideration...I decided not to let what went down impact my review.  So I give Piece four stars, with the knowledge that I will definitely go back.",0.9917,0.781,0.171,0.048,0.4550848385331144

The beer is the biggest draw for me.  All of their brews are very well made.  None of them are flat or bland, and none are too overpowering either.  Each style of beer is accurate to the description, and well worth the trip to WP.  Also, the other beers they serve on tap which are not their own are of good quality.   The waitstaff is attentive and friendly.  Another plus is that they are knowledgeable about not only about the Piece beer, but also the other beers they're serving, which is a welcome change from many bars/restaurants.   Although I don't normally like Karaoke of any kind, the band that plays for live-band-karaoke is very good.  The singers are also usually a good mix of practiced veterans and nervous first timers.  It really has a perfect atmosphere for it. The only two downsides are that they sometimes run out of their beers.  Which is a product of too much success.  But, it's still discouraging when I'm come specifically for a Dysfunctionale, and they're out.  Also, sometimes it's slightly too crowded.  Again, a problem of being too nice of a place, and doing everything else too right, but it still can be irksome to have someone's elbow bump into your back at an inopportune moment.

We were told our wait would be 30 minutes and when we asked why we hadn't been seated after sitting at the bar for over an hour, they got us a table. We accepted the inexplicably long wait, but what was unacceptable was the way we were treated after we sat. The story is too long to tell here, so I'll spare the details.

After our walk in the cold took much longer than expected due to the unshoveled sidewalk, we asked if we could eat our pizza there. They told us no, since it somehow messes up tips for the server.

I've never actually tried any of the food other than pizza, so perhaps I gave it a 5-star rating a little too hastily...

2007-07-17,2.0,"I feel like I'm commiting a very serious offense by giving Piece 2 stars, but to be honest, I sort of only wanted to give it 1. I figured I'd be fair since I've only been here one time (& probably won't be back). I was really excited to have lunch here while we were in Wicker Park, after reading the reviews. However, our experience basically sucked, for the following reasons: 1. Our waitress, who seemed like she'd be a good one at first, was basically nonexistent throughout the rest of our stay. Two or three tables who were seated after us received their food before us, and I know for a fact it wasn't because our food was taking a long time to be cooked (see point 2 below). It was because our waitress was nowhere to be found. We asked one of the many employees who were just hanging around the front of the restaurant (see point 3 below) to check on our food, and he sort of wandered over in the direction of our waitress, who was at the bar -- I don't even think he spoke to her -- and then wandered back and sort of mumbled to us, ""Yeah, your waitress'll check on it in a minute."" Nice. Not surprisingly, she disappeared again after bringing us our food, and ultimately we had to send yet ANOTHER hanging-about-at-the-counter employee to get her, because it was taking way too long to pay -- and this time it was sort of funny, because I watched him as he went all over the restaurant looking for her, in and out of doors and all around. Took him forever to find her, WHO KNOWS what she had been doing. 2. The food may have been good, or it may have been really good, if it had not been left sitting out under the heat lamps for WAY too long. This is how I know that our slow service was the result of our waitress, not the cooks. My pizza had the hugest, grossest pool of grease that had collected in the middle (took about 5 napkins to sop it up), and my boyfriend's tuna melt was blackened on the edges, with cheese that was barely recognizable as such. Even his potato chips were hot, another sign that it had been left sitting under the heat lamp. As it was, the pizza wasn't bad -- I could tell that it may have been really good if it had been fresher -- but toward the end of it I found a long hair on one of the pieces. It could have been my own (although I doubt it, because of the way it was lying on the pizza), but it still skeeved me out too much to continue eating. 3. Seriously, what's up with the three or four employees who were constantly just hanging out at the front, leaning against the counter, reading the newspaper, whatever? Why are they here? What are they getting paid to do? Is there really absolutely no job that can be found for them to accomplish -- such as getting our food, for instance? Inefficiency really frustrates me, especially since we specifically ASKED one of them to do something for us and he blatantly did NOT. I really wanted to like this place. It's open and airy and very inviting, and I wanted to love the food. But I don't think I'll be back.",0.9872,0.844,0.103,0.053,0.5203703703703703

The big downfall for Piece is, as others have mentioned, that it's SO LOUD in here, which can make conversation a daunting task. I recently met up here with a friend of mine that I hadn't seen in years and I was lucky he picked me out of the crowd and we had to speak pretty loudly to be heard, but I guess I can't expect much else on a Saturday in the early evening, but the setup and atmosphere of the place don't really encourage a quieter crowd, either.

It is not a greasy crust. When they take it out of the oven it quickly lays on a lightly corn-mealed 1/2 sheet-pan. It is cut pie-like and served with condiments on the tray.

Between Santulo's, Pequod's, Pizza Metro, Bella's, JG Alberto's, and any other place I've frequented, even Costco, this pizza is my least favorite. It is so light that I feel like I am just having an appetizer; even the medium which is about eleven inches, would be too small for most individuals. I seriously had thoughts about supplementing my lunch with a slice from Costco after dining at Piece for the world cup game. Two of the beers I wanted were unavailable, and the environment was extremely cold. Before I arrived,  my friend who was already there called to have me bring her a hoodie, and she was still shivering. It took fifteen minutes to be asked if we wanted any foor or drinks as I was even standing up trying to wave-down the waitress who kept disappearing. When we were finally helped, the waitress responded to my friend with an insulting tone after he asked her to repeat something she mumbled. The cranked AC brought our pizza to room temperature in about five minutes after they dropped it on our table; room temperature being about fifty-nine degrees.       The seating and lighting was pleasant, as the room was not too crowded for the game. They have a dozen or so large televisions rigged up displaying different stations. This was on a Thursday morning around 11am. Usually when I walk by in the evenings it is packed to the gills as the noise levels approach that of a shuttle launch.
