I have only been there on weekdays, either for their happy hour drink specials and half price apps, and on weekends for brunch, but always enjoyed the place and felt like I was getting a good deal. Their chicken and waffles (brunch) are particularly good. Their house whiskey (Dickel i believe it's called) is rather good, or at least good enough. I recommend the rye dickel, which has led to me ordering many a ""double dickel and soda!"" followed by a little chuckle to myself. Spacious place, chill vibe, and pretty low key.

I've eaten here a few times before and have below average experiences but decided to come here once again because it's ""right off the blue line"" at cali.  A few family members and I came here at around one after the Cubs rally on a Friday. Go Cubbies! The place was not packed at all. Maybe five other tables were being served? And a few people at the bar? Anyways- we sit ""wherever we want"". It took forever to get menus, forever for our hipster waitress to take our order, and when we had to flag her down to order drinks and glasses of water she was like ""oh yeah what do you want to drink?"". Clueless.  The menu is typical nothing exciting at all. I order the ""spicy"" chicken sandwich. Apparently ""spicy"" means that the breading has black pepper. It was just so tasteless. And the slaw served no purpose but to fit the ""hipster"" obligation. The fries are bad, cold, stale? When we finally got the busboys attention and asked for ketchup, he just took it from another customers table :/.  The pitcher of mixed alcoholic mango beverage that we ordered had a ton of ice and tasted just like water! (And I'm not a big drinker. We paid $15? For water) When we poured ourselves glasses we couldn't tell which drink had ""vodka"" in it! It was so bizarre! When my father brought it to the attention of the bartender, she just plainly said ""it's got lots of liquor in it-i know because I made it and tasted it""  But we were saying it doesn't taste like it does and that it doesn't taste good. She just walks away and avoids our table!  Just horrible horrible service! Mind you, it was not even busy! And my fellow diners ordered burgers. Just horrible, tasteless burgers! Also, for $14, the burger better come with some friggin cheese.  I've lived in Logan square all my life, same house, and I'm tired of these mediocre hipsters coming to Logan square and charging $15 for a crap burger or sandwich.  Yeah I could probably just not ever return. That's fine with me, I'll take my business elsewhere, didn't feel welcomed there anyway!",-0.971,0.809,0.074,0.117,0.5467673248161052

Aesthetically, it's a cool space. That's why this is getting 2 stars instead of 1. However, the service was the worst I've had in Logan Square by a mile. Our server brought us water and one of the glasses had a HUGE crack all the way down the side. We realized this as soon as she set it down and it soaked through a napkin. She disappeared though, so I had to bring the glass to the bar and wait about 3 minutes for the bartender (who was 3 feet away) to stop talking to the bus boy for long enough to take the glass. Our server took our order and brought it out, but those were the only times we saw her. Our water glasses were empty the entire time; we tried to flag her down to no avail.   I ordered the pulled pork poutine special and it was all but inedible. The pork smelled 10% worse than my dog's canned food. I tried to move it aside but the dish was pretty much ruined. I would have sent it back had I ever been able to get our server's attention.  20 minutes after we finished eating, and after multiple attempts to get our server's attention, we finally got our check.

2015-11-26,3.0,"I really teetered  between a 3 and 4 star review for this place, so ultimately I went with a 3 star review. I'll explain why below.  I came on ""black out Wednesday"" to this place for the first time yesterday. I had passed this place a few times, but didn't know much about it until my boyfriend mentioned us going there. I glanced at the menu online before going, and not much stuck out to me, but I figured I would give the place a chance.  The two of us came to the restaurant a little after 8pm, and we were seated right away. I liked the rustic interior and the fact that the clear Christmas lights were up. The restaurant had a low key and comfortable atmosphere.  After glancing at the specials for the day, I decided to go with their burger of the day. This burger was stuffed with jalapeño cheese, and had roasted red peppers on it. This burger sounded promising, but it was kind of a let down. I asked for the burger to be cooked medium, and there was quite a bit of runny pink in the burger. Unfortunately I didn't notiice right away until probably the 3rd bite. At first I wondered if it was because it was a stuffed burger, but then I  realized the stuffed burgers I've had other places were not this uncooked when I asked for it cooked medium. I probably should have asked them to remake it. Another downside about burger was that it lacked flavor, and they tried to disquise this fact with tons of bbq sauce. Instead of fries, I asked for a cup of soup on the side. The soup on the day was a cream of mushroom garlic soup, and it also sounded promising. Instead, the soup was very watery and also lacked flavor (needed some more herbs and pepper). The drink I had was the Old Fashioned, and it was okay, but also not memorable and not well mixed. The service from our waitress during the meal was very satisfactory, and the food came out pretty fast. This place is probably a good choice if you want to grab a cold beer and maybe a late night snack, but not for a mouthwatering casual dinner.",0.9809,0.865,0.102,0.033,0.49577737077737094

2015-10-09,2.0,"The quality of food is good, but the execution was poor.... I was here for lunch on September 20th during the Bears game. It was a nice day, so I decided to sit on the patio.  Ordered the blue cheese and bacon burger. The menu clearly states that their burgers are best cooked to ""medium"" so I followed suit. Sadly, the meat was char-burned and the patty was much smaller than the bun. Also, I ordered the mixed veggies instead of fries for a side, the veggies were fresh, but very salty.  I also ordered boneless buffalo wings as an appetizer. The wings were not spicy, in fact, I had to ask for hot sauce to pour over the wings. This was disappointing. However, I ordered the small wings, and the portion size seemed generous, which was a plus. When done eating, the manager asked me how my meal was and I told her the truth, but focused on the burger/veg issue (since the hot wings were fixed by adding hot sauce). The manager apologized and said that it's a ""game day"" so when the restaurant is busy, sometimes the kitchen staff rushes to get orders complete, which is why my meal wasn't up to standards. I feel that's a poor excuse, especially considering my meal came out in the standard amount of time--not too fast, but not too slow-- which I appreciated since I was dining alone. The manager offered me a drink on the house, which I believed was a nice gesture on her part. It's rare to find that generosity when dining at restaurants these days. A few minutes later the waitress came by and said that she didn't realize I wasn't satisfied with my food and that I should have mentioned it to her. I would have, but after my food was served, she didn't check on me. In fact, I had to ask the bus-person for hot sauce and more napkins. As stated above, the quality of the food is good, but the execution that day was poor. My advice?

Needless to say, my review is probably heavily colored by nostalgia.  We sat outside--and this is my only negative point--at a table right by the entrance. It was a little awkward and there were other available tables. Anyway, it wasn't a big deal and it didn't affect our night much. We had the fish tacos, nachos and hubby had a burger. Everything was good. I was surprised how much I liked the fish tacos. The mango salsa was really good. The nachos are massive. More than enough for a group of four.

Can some institution in St Louis please recreate this sandwich?! It was so good. Chicken was perfected cooked and juicy inside. Seasoning was perfect and breading was perfecting crispy. The jalapeño slaw and Chipotle mayo we're a great compliment but the chicken remained the star which is a feat most can't live up to. My only criticism would be that it just wasn't very spicy - could really use some more heat, especially in the realm of cayenne pepper on the chicken to really get that Nashville hot theme. Sweet potato fries were good but not amazing.  We were a group of 6 and our server treated us politely and gave excellent service even with a relatively crowded lunch rush.

She came back and I asked her for a few different beers, none of which the bar had in stock.  Here's a suggestion, when handing out a drink menu, mention what the bar is out of so the customer can immediately eliminate those from their taste buds and focus on what the bar does have in stock.  Finally, I found a beer they had and she walked it on over.   After a couple of rounds, my friend asked about the cocktails, specifically which of the ciders were used in one or two of them.  Her response to his inquiry ""well, if you look at the menu..."" and my eyes instantaneously jumped out of my head and began rolling around on the floor.  I couldn't believe the laziness of this girl.  The place wasn't busy, far from it, and she showed almost zero interest in making any sort of money that night.   The only thing that kept me from telling her I didn't want anything else to drink and that we were leaving because she was a complete moron was the Hawks game.  Once that was over, we finished our beverages and headed out.  Guys, I'm not sure how you train the staff over there but I've never encountered such an absent minded, flighty, ""you're taking time away from me leaning against the wall and staring off into space"" type of server before until last night.   It pains me a bit to leave this review because I generally have a pretty ok time at Logan Bar & Grill and I will go back, however, if I don't sit at the bar and she is my server, I'll request to sit somewhere else...maybe she should cut it down to a half a J before a serving shift....just a thought.",0.7745,0.908,0.054,0.038,0.5046559343434344

The beer list is OK and that is assuming they have any of the crap on the menu.  I stopped in with a friend about a week back and they were out of almost half of their list.  Nothing remaining was particularly enticing (think a step up from Chili's) but we decided to tough it out to get some food.  I was almost tempted to drag my pal back to Boiler Room so we could keep drinking decent beer. I had the fish tacos and they were also about something I probably could made better myself (and I don't cook).  They were under flavored and I wasn't really looking forward to eating the last one but figured I paid for it so I might as well choke it down. The service was mostly good and they were definitely on top of keeping me hydrated which is important during a night of boozing.

They've recently raised it to $8.50 because they can, the place is always busy. We aren't jumping ship or anything over the $1, but I wasn't in the mood for a busy/hipstery vibe, so we went to Logan Bar and Grill instead.

It was not busy, and she was very attentive. The place itself is a good looking bar, with high ceilings, sky lights, and exposed wood beams. They decorated tastefully for Christmas and it really gave the place an even cozier feel. They have 2 bars, 2 fireplaces in the dining room, and a great patio. The beer list is vast for bottles and cans, could use a bit more variety on tap though. The drink menu is creative, we wanted to try everything!

Next come Alicia and Lauren, very lovely and gracious managers. They have put up with me all these years. Then there's a cool smiley daytime bartender, Mike, who also works @ night. I love to come here for a glass/glasses of wine and great atmosphere. They have over 50 beer selections and great cocktails. Their food is good and they're updating their menu.

When we walked in there was no host at the stand so we were idly waiting for 5-7 minutes.  We were a large group so we were fairly noticeable to any employee that there were guests that needed seats.  Though our server was nice and accurately took down and delivered orders, she gave a new definition to SLOW SERVICE.  Having worked in the industry I am typically empathetic to servers, but there was not enough of a crowd in Logans to warrant the service that we received.  We waited 15 minutes for our drinks to come, another 25 minutes for our food (which was mostly appetizers and salads), but what was quite upsetting was the additional wait time for her to close out our check.  We had planned to be there for only an hour, but because of the pace of our server we were there for and hour and an half.  It was clear that other guests at neighboring tables were also annoyed with the lack of attention from the serving staff.

Nothing to rave about, no amazing specials. My favorite thing we had all day was the hummus plate. The humus plate was served with nice big slices of tomatoes, cucumbers and pita bread. The fries were good, but served on a very tiny plate which made for a tiny, unshare-able serving. The burgers and  The Rustic Cowboy (a plate of black beans, pita, and bacon) were both good, not great.   One thing I did really love was that the mimosa was served as a wine glass of OJ with a small bottle of champagne.

For dinner, I ordered the tuna wrap, and he ordered the chicken sandwich that was on special.  The tuna wrap was not good at all.  The tuna was breaded, really thin, and didn't taste quite right.  I wish I had just stuck the nachos.  He said that the sandwich wasn't good either.  We're both people who clean our plates, so when we both had finished just half our of food--it was clearly indicative of a problem. We were talking over another beer, when suddenly he stopped talking and stared behind me where there was a planter above the seat.  He calmly explained to me that there was a rat in the planter right above my head.  I freaked out and jumped to the other side of the table.  Sure enough within a minute, the rat poked its little head out and hopped out of the planter.  I'm not sure where it ended up, but it really grossed me out.  Our server had left us sitting for a while without bringing the check and as soon as that happened, I just wanted to leave.

Their burgers kind of taste like a slight step up from a fast-food burger, and I had their chicken strips once and they were practically burnt to a crisp.  The only good thing I've had on their dinner menu are the wings, but they are a bit overpriced. That said, it's not like this place doesn't have some positive attributes.  The best thing it has going for it is the ambiance/setting.  It's a nice, inviting, open space that feels comfortable.  You could stick around a while if you wanted to.  And one time we stopped in for breakfast/brunch because Cozy Corner was too crowded, and the food was actually pretty good.  So although their dinner options may kind of suck, at least they make a decent breakfast.  Also have a good beer selection, but they're a bar & grill so that should be a given.  I've personally never had any service issues, so can't complain there. If they made better food this would be a nice place to frequent more often, but because the quality/variety is sub-standard, this is a once or twice a year type of place for me personally, even though I live nearby.",0.9491,0.761,0.147,0.092,0.5913442113442113

She said it was fine and reserved the right to ask them to move if it got busy. Perfect, no big deal. 2) Bartender informs us she won't charge us for our drinks because that is the waitresses table. Huh? Ok, send her with the bill then, who cares. 3) Manager walks by and in passing makes a snide remark that we can't sit at the bar and at the table.  What?!?  There are 9 of us dude.  Your staff was cool with it, but you're being a d-bag.  Eventually he comes by again and cries some more about ordering from the bar at this table.  We inform him we're gonna leave and he rudely walks away.

I credit the Logan as being the first place I ever tried Delirium Tremens and Buffalo style calamari and since I love em both.  There is no parking lot and it can be hard for someone new to the area to come across parking but I live in walking distance and since I know the area well I never struggle within the neighborhood to find a space.  Even with it  being across the street from the California blue line stop you can sneak in after work for a delirium and quick buzz.  The drink specials are always okay too. The only time the Logan dropped the ball was for my golden birthday party.  I would recommend staying away from their party packages because we had given them more than a months lead to plan a $35 wristband package and though they assured me I would have a few tables in the back for the alotted time they total screwed me when I arrived on time with a party of 20+.  They began to collect money and then had none of the drinks we liked on hand, no space reserved and the manager/ supervisor had an ""i don't even care"" attitude.  He was a bald dude.  I won't ever forget that disaster.  But given that I wasn't going to ruin my birthday night I told baldy to up the money and everyone took their $35 next door to Foremost Liquor and we had a good old fashioned house party.  It's always bittersweet for me frequenting the Logan but like I did say I like the place and its selection.

2012-02-04,2.0,"I will admit that as a Logan square resident, I am a bit spoiled. The Logan bar and grill has a lot of established competition nearby so I tried to cut them some slack. My wife and I were in the mood for some straight forward bar food. We ordered some simple appetizers. Chicken fingers, wings and pulled pork quesadillas - stuff that's pretty hard to mess up. The the batter on the chicken fingers tasted like dirt, and I don't mean that they tasted bad, they tasted specifically like soil. Very odd. The wings were ok but the pulled pork quesadillas were bland. I didn't think you could make pulled pork bland. To top it all off the price was way out of line with what they actually serve. Not expensive but compared to rocking horse, you can get better food for the same amount of money.",0.6929,0.824,0.107,0.069,0.5635912698412697

They just don't want to be a sports bar.  Forget their mediocre food because it is. Beer selection is decent at best. Why do you have 12 HD tv's and the NFL package if you're not trying to be a sports bar?  If significant sporting events are on, you play the game with sound. I can listen to the White Stripes or The Smiths at home or somewhere fun. That's all there is to it.

Don't let the snobby foodie critics deter you away from a great establishment and staff.  The food is delicious if you're looking for some interesting takes on bar food. The turkey burger and wings are probably my favorite, not to mention the sweet potato fries with honey mustard sauce. I also recommend the nachos which are great for two people, or someone like me who has no dignity or self respect.  The environment is set under a huge full room skylight, perfect in the summer when you get great natural lighting. There's also a patio that is perfect for people watching. The bar is beautiful and laid out in two separate rooms, perfect if you want to just grab a drink, or sit down and eat with friends. There are also two separate bars as well, so if one's packed, you have another bartender handy. On top of all of this, they have a few arcade games, trivia night on sundays, and DJs on weekends. Not to mention, a bunch of big TVs for the sports fans.  I love The Logan, and this is coming from someone who usually wouldn't hang in this type of bar environment.

2011-11-24,1.0,"Thanksgiving serves as one of the high holidays of the year and coincidentally one of the biggest nights of drinking. When my friend chose Logan Bar and Grill, I was really excited to try someplace new. Logan Bar is situated right by the California Blue Line, you'll find the place with a very cool sign out front and modern interior with contemporary pop art covering their walls. My favorite thing about Logan Bar was their pixelated Daliesque Gary Coleman art on the wall by the main bar. After this, I can't think of anything else I liked about Logan Bar and Grill. Coming in there was no hostess to seat us so we decided to sit at the bar in the back. Strangely enough this fully stocked bar complete with taps and a glitzy spread of liquor was not really a bar at all - no bartender would be working that bar tonight as we were informed.  Logan Bar - is this a restaurant or is this a bar? I'm sorry but this place has a major identity crisis as we were told we could not sit at the bar with our increasingly growing group of people because we were blocking the walkway. It is quite amazing that the servers and management could not figure a way to sit 20 people down all in the same spot on a night that was not even that crowded and we were moved to a spot that could not sit all of us.  I cry foul as one friend went so far as to order a beer from the bar, have the bartender pour the beer and was told he could not have it because he was sitting at a table. Hey! If your server is too slow and unable to serve drinks maybe someone else wants to serve a drink! Picture this, 20 of my friends are at the bar (or is it a restaurant with no hostess or anyone capable of sitting us all together) with two friends eating at the bar, four friends sitting at a table, me with two friends sitting in a completely different room, and ten friends sharing two tables separate from everyone else. What a great way to spend the holidays chopped up all across the bar (or is it a restaurant?) so the servers can all get paid and the customer does not get what they want except more or more explanations of rules that make no sense. Top this off with lousy service, lackluster food and you have my lowest 1-star rating of all time. Do not waste your money or time at Logan Bar. Should anyone suggest to me to ever frequent this bar ever again, I will recount that it was on Thanksgiving 2011 that Logan Bar perfectly ruined one of my favorite holidays with poor customer service, bland food, and a devil may care attitude to customers.

When we asked our waitress what was up with that, she eventually let it slip that the other gal didn't know the calamari was bad until the order was ready and didn't want to go back to tell the patron they couldn't have their calamari.

My husband picked Logan knowing my poor review years ago and promised me that it had improved.  We sat down at an open table near the second bar area.

My husband got the black bean crusted chicken fingers while I got the pulled pork quesadilla. I have to say that they really hit the spot and were delicious. This was not the food that I remembered from years ago. My quesadilla was flavorful and tasty, not mediocre like before. My husband loved his black bean chicken fingers.

We were told they didn't want to be known as a sports bar.  What?  With TV's in the bar with sports games?  We liked the Logan and knew that football and hockey were broadcast with sound and were stumped as to why we could not also have sound for the BB games.  The wait staff were very good as was the little bit of food we got before deciding to leave.  The liquor store around the corner and the local pizza delivery certainly did benefit from our business.  A shame that the Logan lost all of our business.  Probably won't go back.",-0.2144,0.821,0.079,0.1,0.44540178571428574

So it was with a measure of reluctance that I joined my guy and his cousin there for a beverage a few nights before Christmas. They were sitting by the fire, the Christmas lights were up and the place was neither crowded nor pulsating with bad music, which was a pleasant surprise. Within a few moments of sitting down, the server appeared and asked me what I'd like to drink; again, good stuff. She brought it to me quickly and then noticed my guy hadn't touched his drink. He explained that it didn't take like Captain and Coke; seemed too sweet, sort of vanilla-y. The server slapped on a half-smile and replied that she'd seen the bartender herself pour the drink, so she knew it was what he'd ordered, which seemed a touch defensive to me. I offered up that maybe the mix was off for the Coke, but she said she had had no other complaints. I shrugged. She offered to have the drink re-made, but my guy didn't really care, so no issues.  Other than that, it was a pleasant place and a relatively enjoyable experience.

Mostly this place isn't really great and there are a lot of better places to go in the neighborhood.

I will concede that my friends are idiots for not noticing when I asked them to watch it, but an employee walked by my large group of friends and picked up my purse off of my chair and took it behind the bar without asking anyone in that large group of people by the purse if it belonged to one of them. When I retrieved my bag and said it had been by my friends and I didn't know why someone picked it up, an employee or friend of employee (I don't' know because I've seen her there a lot and behind the bar but I'm not sure) called me a b%#$* for not being thankful that someone picked up my purse from a chair sitting in a group of people and moved it without asking whose it was...  yeah.",0.9659,0.795,0.134,0.071,0.527869352869353

We ordered the some snacks including the refried bean dip & salsa and sweet potato fries.  The bean dip is described as ""a big bowl of homemade bean dip, guacamole, pico de gallo, onions, sour cream & jalapeño peppers served with homemade tortilla chips & salsa.""  What you don't know, though, is how beautifully it's presented.  The bean dip serves as base and the guac, pico, onions, sour cream and FRESH jalapenos (oooh!) are piled in little mounds on top of the bean dip.  Pretty to look at... miserable to eat.  Mix that business up, yo!  Once I had all the components on my plate, though, I was a happy camper.  It was sort of like deconstructed nachos.  The real winner is the sweet potato fries.  They're thin cut and deep fried in canola oil with zero trans fat and served with two dipping sauces.  While the dipping sauces seemed pretty much the same to me (a creamy kind of dressing), they accompanied the crispy taters most gloriously.  Order em.  You won't be sorry. Service wasn't bad, just not awesome.  Two of my friends ordered some kind of special drink of the day that was peach vodka and soda that required the server to bring out martini shakers and mix the drink on site before pouring it into the glasses at the table.  Cool, right?  I even commented that it was ""fancy,"" and our waitress promptly let our group know that ""fancy"" equals ""pain in the ass.""  Wow.  Sorry for making you pour our drinks, sister.  I was glad I just stuck to Jack & diet Cokes that didn't have any extra presentation requirements.  Sheesh.

I haven't been avoiding this place, therefore, so much as I've never had a reason to go there.  That was until someone suggested it for a place to watch the USA v. England match.  ""They show soccer?"" was the first question I asked.  After all, the douchebags I sometimes see out on the patio walking by this place don't watch soccer (okay, that's not true, but I like to think it is).  So, needless to say, I was reluctant but realized I needed to stop being overly cautious about this place and what it is or isn't doing to my neighborhood and just try it. And I have to say that for a bar that usually doesn't handle a soccer crowd, their usual brunch service (11:00 a.m. on the weekends) served as a very good backdrop to our soccerific good time.  Their $5 bloodies, while I did not partake, seemed to be large and their menu significant.  If only the portions on the food I got had matched.   I got the ""Waffle"" for $5.99.  I didn't read the menu closely enough, being distracted by the brilliant 1-1 draw and all, to realize they didn't mean waffles - they actually just meant one waffle.  Covered with whipped cream, mind, which makes everything better - but still not filling.  Not deterred, I got a ""bowl"" of their veggie soup since I was still hungry.  Now I have to ask, did they mean ""cup?""  I swear I was served a cup.  It wasn't World Cup sized by any means either.  It wasn't even Stanley Cup sized.  It was so small, it wasn't even cup-worthy (yeah, I went there - boobs!).  The portions around me were on things like the chilaquiles were bigger, but I left hungry over $10.00 later.  At least the service was good - even if it should have come with a magnifying glass. One last thing though.  They need to do a bit of research before attempting to show soccer again.  While their soundtrack of Manchester rock and shoegaze was wonderful; it was not exactly what one might want to hear before watching the United States play England.  Small Bar Fullerton (*cough* a real soccer bar *cough*) didn't even serve English brews that morning for during an *earlier* match.   I wish Logan would have tried a little harder to create a soccer atmosphere (or even an atmosphere at all, this place really is sterile), but it's a serviceable place.  It won't be a goal of mine to go there if they start showing soccer for real but it might not pass it up.",0.9898,0.851,0.107,0.042,0.48354239256678283

Josh told my friend he'd take the wings off the tab 3 times, which was on my tab actually, and he never did. My husband went and had a word with Josh about it all and he just didn't seem to care. I called over and asked to have the wings taken off the tab, which he said he would do, but doubt he will. The only reason we'll ever go back here is to make sure that wing order was credited. Tsk tsk, Logan. Get your act together and learn to treat people better, especially those who have been nothing but good to you. You just lost 3 customers. 3 people who bring in other people. 3 who will gladly tell others to stay away.

It's a few blocks away, and I was a bit surprised that there weren't more bars catering to the hipster crowd around there. Perhaps gentrification has not hit full force. That may be the reason that there were no tables available and only a few seats available (at the second bar). That doesn't seem like enough of a reason to get served so slowly.  It took about ten minutes for a waitress to approach my friend and me at the bar - no bartender tended the second bar. We came in planning on drinking a few beers but only got one after 40 minutes. (I got the Stone IPA on tap for $5. They served PBR for $3.5, bottle of Delirium for $8, Beer of the Month - some Goose Island brew - $4) From the business casual and suited people sitting around the tables, the place seems like a nice place to get drinks after work. It's located close to a blue line stop, such that you can see the bar clearly from the platform.  I liked the open feeling of the second room, with a glass ceiling. I felt like I was in a ski lodge of sorts with the wooden interior. There's outdoor seating for nicer - not cool, drizzly April in Chicago - days.

First off the interior is very nice and very roomy which you cant tell by walking by it outside. They have two bar and various fireplaces through out the place.

To my surprise they actually had a decent beer selection and I decided to get the special which was the SAM Adams winter ale. Our food came very fast, then again we were one of the few couples in there, and her nachos game on this very large plate stacked up high. The nachos were probably some of the best nachos I have had in a long time. Instead of using the canned jalapeno peppers they used freshly cut ones and the cheese was not your typical canned cheese and then the guacamole was very fresh and good. My wings were typical bar food wings they were very large and meaty but the hot sauce they were covered in was not that hot but was tasty enough. They did have a DJ who was basically playing stuff out of an ipod and mostly indie stuff which fit the setting.

Having eaten here a handful of times in the last year, I've had a few choice entrees.  None of them have really satisfied me.  The setup is real nice though.  The rich hardwood floors and pristine wooden tables and benches are even more welcoming when accompanied by the fireplace in back.  They have a nice outdoor patio that is opened up to join with the indoor seating.  But alas, the food disappoints me and creates a woeful belly. The beer selection is fairly large and the service impeccable (which gives them another star).  Yet when the word ""grill"" is part of your namesake shouldn't there be some awesomeness to offer your patrons?",0.9522,0.801,0.147,0.052,0.5441176470588235

Now, this place doesn't get dead, but both times I've gone there there were enough waitresses on to please people with what should be good timing.  The food is mediocre (typical bar food); however, the nachos are piled high which makes for a good drinking appetizer. This place also has the falafel wrap, which is kinda exciting.    The two good things on the menu are no where near enough to keep me going back on an average basis (even if I live close enough to bike it).   There is also trivia at this place, which is OK. It is free, so that's good, plus I do like how the trivia experience is different from that in other bars since you wager your points; however, the trivia host is annoying enough to make you want to leave the place before the first round is over.

Ronny's customers want them to feel uncomfortable). 3) It's understandable if bar fare is slightly overpriced (because of convenience) or slightly sub-par (because it's a bar, not a retaurant) but it should never EVER be both to the extremes that this place is. 4) The music is TERRIBLE.  In a twist of irony, Northsider's playlist is suprisingly deece, but not Logan.  It's like someone was taking ""what's alternative"" cues from Entertainment Weekly.  Not one but TWO other YELP reviewers mentioned they were playing Alien Ant Farm's ""Beat It"".  Sad.  Not suprised, but sad. 5) Service here is AWFUL.  I've sat down a few times and watched the waitstaff walk back-and-fourth infront of me for 15 minutes.  The first time I got impatient quickly and grabbed a busboy to ask if someone could take our orders.  The second time it happened again and I was curious how long it would take for someone to come over and give us menus.  We waited upwards of 20 minutes, watched the end of the Florida game on TV and then decided to eat and drink elsewhere.",-0.9704,0.782,0.081,0.137,0.5473251028806585

Why can't Logan Square have a regular sports bar like everyone else?  Just because you live in a mid-gentrification hood and you ride a bike and wear clothes that don't match doesn't mean the people who pay their mortgages on time can't have a bar they like too.  Fwiw, the atmosphere is great, the place is immaculately clean, and the people are as nice as can be. Look, hipsters.  You guys can have Estelle's, Cali Clipper, Five Star etc... Just think of it this way:  When a Northside/ Logan bar bro-dog type comes into your favorite little bar, you vibe them right out the door.  Now, they can have their own place, just as you have yours.  And everyone can be happy.

It was a slightly chilly end of summer night and we sat outside in the front patio, currently the side patio is considered a beer garden and their liquor license doesn't cover it, just an fyi. Our waitress was really friendly. After one sip of our drinks we started to freeze and headed to a table inside. The bar itself is fairly large, and decorated simply with exposed brick walls and low lighting. Definitely a relaxing place. I had a chicken sandwich that was good, nothing special, but you know, it didn't taste like crap so that's a positive.

Not too small, not too big. The only thing I'm not a fan of are the fries.  I'm not a big steak fry fan.   I think it's a great restaurant for the area that will drive more traffic to the other quality places nearby (Taqueria Moran is bound to get some of the overflow).  It's nice to have another option to Dunlay's or any of the restaurants on California.   This restaurant took over the space of a dry cleaner (that moved around the corner) so I'm not sure where all gasping of a blight on the neighborhood are coming from.  I mean what . . . should the true essence of Logan Square be captured only by crumbling dry cleaners?

To the nay-sayers, this place might be working out the kinks in their FIRST WEEK EVER, but damn, the management bent over backward to make sure we were taken care of- even laying down a round of drinks for the table after we lost a buck in the jukebox. This place might feel out of place for ""buck-boldt-square"", but it's a warm welcome away from others in the area trying to be what these guys are ACTUALLY pulling off.  Laid-back, nice, not blown away with flatscreens (but they got'em), diverse enough menu for a bar and grill, and appropriately priced/good value for our neighborhood. Happy you're here Logan!",0.9716,0.784,0.178,0.038,0.5152464494569757
2008-07-27,2.0,"Looking at the bottle cap sign outside and the obnoxious bouncers (what is this the pentagon?) the Logan Bar and Grill screams ""Douch-bag-central"" .... luckly the interior is MUCH more pleasing than the exterior. The exposed brick, wood and fireplaces (along with shitty 'abstract' art that looks like it came straight from Bed Bath and Beyond) SCREAM Street Side Cafe... a not so surprising co-owner. And the service seemed to match that of Street Side perfectly.... aka- horrible.  Our waitress did an amazing job of never visiting our table, except to stop by and say ""Those beers are on their way""... what because you have to grow the hopps?  The jukebox wasn't working so we had to settle for listening to the worst hits of the 90's... and NOT in the good way.  The prices aren't too bad, but they aren't great.  BUT... there was one thing that was pretty great and might get me back into this cesspool of douchebaggery  is their amazing appetizer of Buffalo Calimari... fried squid smothered in buffalo sauce... amazing. Quite an impressive combination for such a place.  The rest of the menu mimics that of Street Side, I'll be sure to comment on any other experiences I may have there.  In the end I would say DON'T go out of your way to try this place, but if you're in the neighborhood and want to try something new... and hate yourself enough... stop by and give it a chance.... but the mexican joint nextdoor puts them to shame.",-0.4791,0.743,0.12,0.137,0.6472958754208755
2008-07-25,2.0,"My boyfriend and I have been anticipating the opening of this bar for months. It wasn't anything to get excited about unfortunately. We read a sign that said to ""Please Seat Yourself' only to be questioned for doing so. Fine. Then things started out well and we were greeted and ordered promptly. Me a Miller Lite ($3.50 - not horrible) and a BBQ Chicken pizza -on the specials menu for the day. Just 4.95. Prices you can't beat!!! Food came and it was great, though our server didnt bring it out and we did not see her again for almost an hour. We were ready to go, when we realized we would never be able to have another drink, but one problem. We didn't yet have our bill. It was 8pm and we couldnt get anyone's attention until 8:40)!! When the manager even got close to our table she distracted by every table on the way to ours, with numerous other issues. Understaffing is forgiven, as long as the problem is remedied! The bill was wrong as the pizza was nearly double the price, but we left cash and got out of there as fast as possible. I may be back in a few months, to give them a second chance. I'm sure they'll work out some of these kinks!",0.2962,0.832,0.095,0.073,0.5637566137566138
2008-07-24,2.0,"Holy terrible service Batman! So my fiance and I have been anxiously waiting for this place to open as it's close to home, has a cool glass atrium room, and a nice outdoor seating area. We had the chance to check it out for lunch today. It started out fine, server seemed decent. We ordered a chicken sandwich and a chopped chicken salad. My salad was supposed to come with avocado on it. It didn't have any when it arrived so I asked her if it came with it? She said she hadn't memorized the menu but she'd bring me a little side of avocado. It never appeared. She also brought my fiance a burger with fries instead of a chicken sandwich with veggies. He asked her to switch it out and she brought back another burger with veggies and pepper jack (right cheese, wrong sandwich). He also asked her for ketchup and mustard several times and it never arrived.  When the bill arrived, we noticed a charge for avocado....strange that my salad should include it, and it didn't arrive, also strange that I asked for it later and never got it, but would receive the pleasure of paying for it. Overall we'll probably go back as it is close by and has a nice bar, but I was really disappointed with the fact it was lunchtime and our waitress only had 2 tables and still messed up so much stuff.",-0.139,0.868,0.07,0.062,0.574016563146998
2008-07-24,4.0,"Wow, white people and lots of them!  We, 2 Latinos and 2 gringos, have lived in this hellhole of a neighborhood for over 7 years.  When we moved in the choices were Pancho's and El Nandu and between trying to ignore the drug slingers, avoiding eye contact with gang bangers (yes, I'm afraid of 12 year-olds wearing hoodies) and trying not get run over by ""assertive"" Puerto Rican girls driving massive SUVs, well, it was challenging to say the least.  Now, we have a slew of places, the pushers are all but gone and the hoodies are worn mostly by trixie types.  The Latinas are still in full force however (look both ways then look again and again!). Anyway, it finally feels like our ""hood"" is on the map and it's getting better day-by-day.  There's even a plan that will hopefully lead to a City Council resolution ensuring the Milwaukee Avenue corridor (Armitage to California) be developed with mass transit, green spaces, building heights and set-backs and type of businesses in a thoughtful and graceful manner.  Logan Bar & Grill is an attractive looking space with sight lines that actually enhance the look and feel of the entire intersection.  The service was extremely strained and slow which is certainly to be expected for a place just opened.  The wait staff, however, was stellar even apologetically offering a free drink.  The food is very typical bar fare but will, again, offer an alternative for the residents and guests to the area.  So, c'mon out and enjoy this place and while you're at it checkout our logistically convenient little neighborhood!",0.9847,0.824,0.141,0.035,0.5906250000000001

2008-07-23,3.0,"Hi, Logan! Welcome to the neighborhood. You dress the corner up nice with your bottlecap font and dark timber, exposed brick and cool tile. Look at you, all Lakeview and stuff here in Humboldt/Bucktown. I think you might have influenced the Cozy Corner's new hat, too. Your glass atrium ceiling is gorgeous. I bet you are fun during rainstorms.  So, Logan, the service and food were very good for your first night. I admit I found the menu to be uninspired, but the fresh ingredients and quality preparation made what we ordered very pleasing. Mostly pleasing - half my tilapia was overdone and tasted like coal - but I could have eaten a pound of those veggies. My only real complaint is that it was freezing. It was arctic! I was shivering to the point of goosebumps and skipped the apple pie.  We'll definitely be back soon, but I'll be bringing a sweater in case the patio is ""closed"" again.",0.9778,0.78,0.188,0.032,0.5386602870813397

2008-07-21,5.0,First a disclaimer.....Before I go spouting off about how much I really like Logan Bar and Grill I should mention that I used to work at a sister restaurant and still remain friends with the owners. Rob L and I attended the soft opening tonight and it was a blast.  Its nice to see that the attention to detail that made Northside so successful is being applied to Logan but it has its own distinct feel.  The staff=  Well trained....My server (besides being adorable) was attentive and unobtrusive....a fine line I know but she did a great job!  The entire restaurant was well staffed and the servers handled the full house with ease.  They had several managers on the floor making sure everyone was attended to as well. I was very excited to see the falafel wrap on the menu...It was my fav item on the specials menu when I worked for them and it was just as delicious as I remembered.  Rob L and I shared the Nachos which were yummy as well. Logans has a great eclectic vibe-- It has a very distinctive neighborhood feel and will be great for all seasons.  A fireplace in the winter...patio in the summer....and two great bars for anytime of year.  I also liked that there was plenty of bathroom space for us ladies (cant speak for the menfolk).   Cant wait to make this my new hangout....yay!,0.9969,0.7,0.273,0.026,0.6576855511638121
2008-07-21,4.0,"I was invited by Janna V who was invited to the little sneak preview event before the open. I walked in, really nice and smart decor. Dark oak, exposed brick, simple but just really nice. I met Janna at the bar, where we given the option of where to sit, they have a really nice little patio area out front, however we chose to sit inside right by the bar. As we chatted and contemplated over the latest going ons in our lives, we realized I needed a beer. I went with a Great Lake's beer, amber with a lot of character, a bit hoppy and malty. We were deciding if we were going to wait for her friend to join us or just order... so we went with appetizers and went with the nachos. A large serving came out, freshly made chips, refried beans, fresh jalapenos, (seriously... I'm over the jarred pickled kind, I likes some real heat), guacamole, (which was pretty tasty), and... cheese sauce. Although I do not hate cheese sauce... I prefer some real melted cheese, yet this did not stop us from doing some major damage. We decided by our second round to go for dinner and if her friend wanted to order when she got here, she could. Yet she went for the falafel wrap, (which was what I wanted), and I for the tuna, we both went for the side salad, to balance the nachos out... yes... guilt was settling in with me. I did manage to get a bite out of her wrap, um.. total yum. Hummus, falafel, tahini sauce, lettuce.. whatever else, I could see why we were both looking at this for dinner. My tuna was good, not amazing, but simple, which is why I ordered it. The tuna was cooked through all the way, but whatever seasoning it had, or the way they cooked it did make it a little tasty although a little dry. However that didn't stop me from eating all of it. It also came with a tarragon mayo on the side, tried a little and realized it was a nice tasty addition, but the calories were spent on the nachos already. The side salad we got was actually pretty good, a nice mix of spinach and a mix green, (always nice to see not just iceberg), carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers, the usual.  No dessert for me this time, too much partying on the weekend, but I have to say I do like this place. The atmosphere is friendly and inviting, the staff is smiling, helpful and attentive. Really our waitress was great, checking up on us when we needed her to, gone when we didn't, but obviously never flat out disappeared. Food is good, solid, with some nice choices, (I also eyed the turkey burger too, black bean salsa on the side and garlic mayo.. mmmm). Also the beer list is good, not overwhelming, but some solid, nice choices. Plus the prices really good too. I don't think this place has many kinks to work out, but when they do, I wouldn't be surprised to see some lines start forming.",0.9989,0.753,0.219,0.028,0.5955513784461154
