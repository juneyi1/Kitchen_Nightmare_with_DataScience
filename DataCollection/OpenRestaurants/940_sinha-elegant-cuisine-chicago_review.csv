2017-08-11,3.0,"My first time dining here and I chaperoned a group of about 30 people. We had a lovely time and you could clearly tell that Jeorgina, chef & owner, has heart and passion for what she cooks up in the kitchen.  Everyone in my group got plenty to eat. There was a buffet setup inside and a buffet setup outside on the patio. Food was good. The plantains had me going back for seconds.  This restaurant is nowhere near where I live and I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here. I probably wouldn't return again. If you're in the area it's a very unique dining experience. You're essentially eating in someone's home. 3/5 because it was very, very cramped and uncomfortable for some of my guests on the lower level. Too cluttered for me, personally.  Not handicapped accessible at all if anyone was wheelchair or walker dependent. Only one restroom.",0.8093,0.887,0.08,0.033,0.49211111111111105

2017-07-13,5.0,"Loved dining here! It was really like eating in your friend's mom's house! At $16 for lunch, you could choose an entree and help yourself to the carboload that is the buffet for sides (rice, beans, pasta salad, etc).  My shrimp entree was extremely well cooked, juicy and plentiful! It was like jumbo shrimp and there were easily at least 6 pieces worth of yum! My colleagues all enjoyed their dishes as well. The hibiscus tea was sweet but really good and it was an easy fix to just add a little water to it.  After the 25% cashback on Groupon, tax and tip was about $15/per person. Super good deal (and you know I'm all about them deals) for the overall dining experience. They have a large parking lot that was super convenient. The owner also offered us to go upstairs to see the elegant dining room and also took us to the back where outdoor seating happens with her grapes also growing!

2017-03-01,3.0,"What a strange but good experience.  My friend and I came here for lunch on a weekday.  She bought a Groupon to this restaurant, and the one time I didn't refer to Yelp beforehand is when I really should have because this place is totally unconventional.  First of all, it's on the garden level of a house.  Secondly, it's literally a house, and you dine in the front of the house (aka, living room) where there are several tables set up and from where you can see the buffet table against the wall and kitchen in the back.  It seats 20ish people max, and we were stuck in the corner at a small high table for 2 because a large party took up the entire middle section of the ""living room.""  I was pregnant with a big belly, so this was even more of a tight spot for me especially, and all the fancy plates and silverware barely fit on the table.  But the food was good!  The buffet is unlimited which is mainly veggies and starches (all very good!), and you select 1 entree.  I got the steak, and it was just ok - small and not very flavorful.  The buffet was surprisingly the best part about the lunch.  You also get complimentary cheese bread, but if you ask for more you get charged.  Give it a try!",0.9848,0.829,0.144,0.027,0.39744663382594425

Large selection of vegetarian dishes, pulled pork that was marinated and slow cooked for a day or so, beef bacon, salmon, chicken, beef stroganoff, cheese bread, eggs, pasta, yucca, desserts aaaahhh!  No blaring music to compete with either. Just friends, food, wine and good times. I'm guessing it seats around 26 people in various flexible configurations.

2016-11-14,3.0,"As most people mentioned, this isn't your typical restaurant. This is literally someone's home and they're hosting you as a guest.  Reason I'm deducting 1.5 stars is because owner booked us at the same time as a private party for a Sunday 4pm Brunch. We weren't told this until it was time to go downstairs, and we've already waited close to an hour in the living room. They managed to pull out a table right by the door, which was fine but the owner had to keep the door open for temp. control and the cold November breeze wasn't as pleasant when eating the food. I didn't think atmosphere would bother me, but it definitely had an impact on my experience on enjoying the food.  The private birthday party was definitely joyous for the 25+ people who were there, but that also meant that my BF and I, being in close proximity, couldn't carry a conversation because of the guests excitement. Rant over - let's get to the food.  There was plenty of food to go around. It is a buffet style brunch. There were definitely some dishes that stole the show - the etouffee, the chicken, non-veg. black beans, steak and the little cheese bread/balls were a highlight! Other dishes like the porkchop and the fish was a little too salty for my taste buds.  The food definitely won over my bf more than me (but full disclosure - I was in the beginning of getting a viral cold that definitely messed w/ my taste buds). According to him, everything was delicious. I could again, pass on a few things and the food was just average for me. It lacked that kick I expected from brazillian food, but again, that could be my taste buds failing me.  For the price alone (33$/pp), the food wasn't worth it to me. The groupon made it worth the money for me.  Will I give this place another shot?

2016-06-05,3.0,"Brazilian reviewer. Came here on Sunday brunch. Food is great, lots of different dishes to choose from, interesting  concept. I don't eat meat, but ate the fish and it was great, and so was the lasagna. Felt like back home, very authentic. Appetizers where excellent too. Here is where I take 2 stars off. Dessert. As a born and raised Brazilian, I am a huge sweet lover. It's in our blood. Brazilians love their sweets. With that much variety of appetizers, salads, enters and sides to chose from, I could only imagine there would be at least 3 or 5 dessert options. I couldn't wait to have some brigadeiro, bolo prestigio, pudim leite condensado, mousse de maracuja and such. Big expectation building there.  So then the host brings in this red velvet cake flan out. (Red velvet is nowhere found in Brazil, but she did point that out). She slices the cake into VERY THIN pieces, I mean seriously, 3 bites in each portion tops, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the top. It tasted ok, nothing to write home about it, but SO SMALL. Like she had to make that cake last for a week. OMG. I was so disappointed. I keep looking around hoping she was serving that while the dessert table was being set but NO. No more. That's all we got. I felt empty, not satisfied and sad. She then thanked us and proceeded to collect payment. It was really the end.  So we drove straight to Brazil Legal, a little brazilian deli nearby to stuff our faces with delicious sweets like the brigadeiro and pudim. Proper dessert to end a yummy meal.",0.9972,0.679,0.263,0.057,0.5398809523809524

The only drawback was the tight seating area.  Occasionally my chair bumped the woman behind me or someone had to squeeze past another.   I was so impressed that I immediatly purchased another coupon when I got home.  I can not wait to visit in the summer where can dine outside.",0.9597,0.872,0.108,0.02,0.5319196428571429

I drove past it several times and had to approach it from the east in order to see a worn sign on the side of a two flat. It was underwhelming in what is clearly the basement of a home but the service was phenomenal and the food was outstanding. The appetizers are a buffet with some of the best rice and beans I've had in my entire life. We ordered an entree to come later and my friend who's a vegetarian ordered the portobello mushrooms. When they were out they provided a homemade tofu dish just for her. During our meal we were given fresh sugary cheesy bread bites with fig marmalade. Amazing! The Hibiscus tea...Amazing!

2015-06-29,5.0,"Sinha provides an unconventional dining experience. It feels like you are attending a dinner party in someone's home, and in many ways, it is exactly that. Reading reviews beforehand was very helpful. It was obvious some of the guests were confused as to how the meal is set up. It's supposed to be a leisurely meal so do not come here if you are pressed for time.  The Sunday 2pm brunch starts with you entering into a home with comfortable sofas where the host offers you tea. You can snack on fruit, cheese and salsa/chutney with pita chips (all homemade). You may chat with others or simply admire the décor while waiting for all the guests to arrive. Once everyone arrives, you are invited to the dining area downstairs with communal tables.  You may sit down wherever. We sat by the window. We waited for a bit longer for the host/chef/owner (aka ""Lady of the house"") to introduce the items at the buffet. The food was all very delicious!! It's all homemade with a dose of love. There was over 20 items which included rice, 2 versions of black beans, cod fish stew, tender pulled pork, farofa (grainy cassava meal), carving station with steak made to order and sausage, fresh cheesy bread, differently prepared salads (chicken, cabbage, kale), stuffed fritters, sautéed orka, green beans, peas, sweet plantains, cut up fruit, variety spicy garnishes. At the end, the host serves her fusion red velvet cake topped with flan with a side of ice cream.   They also have a beautiful back patio where you can sit under the grapevines or walk around to look at what's growing.

Now there is nothing around here other than the United Center, if you're driving make sure you have a high tech car alarm. You might also want to ensure that the United Center does not have any events going on because parking would be a nightmare. The food was alright in fact that is the only reason why I'm even bothering to give this place a star. But be advised you could end up paying far more then what you were originally quoted. She steals from her staff, that fat tip your leaving, one would think would be split amongst the workers? WRONG! She keeps all of it, this women may come off as a sweet, kindhearted, gentile old lady. But she is a thief, and a liar. Our party had a promotional deal for the meal. There were 13 of us in total. After we drank and drank the bill was brought to us. Not only was it double what she had asked us to pay before, but she had the audacity to accuse us of stealing money from her. She should have honored the price she had stated to us beforehand. Steer clear of this place. The food was very mediocre and the home looked like an episode of hoarders tchotchke edition. As icing on this crap cake she thought that by threatening to call the cops we would fork over the money... You have been warned. Stay away",-0.8594,0.792,0.09,0.118,0.6062373737373737

We waited as others arrived and some hot appetizers were brought around.  At our reservation time we were ushered downstairs for brunch.  Jorgina made every effort to make sure everyone was comfortable.  My wife and I were sitting at a high top.  Jorgina had her team bring out another table so we could be seated by ourselves on a low table for more comfort.  She then explained the food in lovely detail.  It was nice that she asked people to come back as often as they like and not waste food. The food itself was an enticing mix of flavors.  It is not high end in terms of presentation but it was exceptional in terms of taste and charm.  I don't normally eat collard greens but her description and presentation won me over!

Jorgina noticed that this person didn't care for rice, beans or salad but did over hear that onions were a favorite. Lo & behold, the side dish that appeared with the pulled pork (which is exquisite) was onions! The ambiance is beautiful, festive & quite welcoming.

2012-10-01,4.0,"Wow, honestly, this was unique experience.  I'm quite a fan of this little home establishment.  I came here for a weekday lunch with a friend since I had the day off.  Like others have mentioned, this is located in the ""basement"", more like the garden level of a tall 3 story residential home.  It was a very well lit room that was more long in depth than wide.  There were 4 different tables:  (1) Long dining table that sat approx 12-14 ppl, (1) smaller table off the side that sat 4 people, (1) medium table that sat approx 5-6 people where one side of the table are indiviidual chairs and the other side is sofa like seating (kind cozy), and (1) cock-tail table for two with high enough chairs so it's not awkward. So my friend came at around quarter to Noon to have lunch.  We accidentally went up the first floor instead to knock on the door.  We were supposed to go the garden level door.  Mental note next time to go downstairs instead. Very nice decor that make it home-y, reminds of very nice arranged dining room.  There was use of cream color table cloth with bright, colorful cloth napkins.  Colors that I would percieve as brazilian culture (I've never been to Brazil, but that's what I imagine).   Is it hot inside?  I was afraid it may be given it was 90 degrees at 11:30am  two  months ago,  but it was actually very comfortable because of 4 reasons:  1. we were there early in the day.  2. it was garden level.   3.  there were fans.  4.  enough natural lighting that didn't require use of lights that would only add heat. We sat the large dinner table, but since were basically only there we just had the entire table to ourselves.  perfectly fine and actually made me feel more at home. Food was excellent.  The buffet comprised of basmati rice and beans (with pork or vegetarian) and also salad.  The rice was great probably because it was good quality or it was freshly cooked.  The beans were a little to salty for me, but I didn't really mind it.  (I know there a little salty for me personally because I'm pretty thirsty 2 hours after lunch).  Lettuce is shredded romaine lettuce with fresh tomatoes and eggs and peppers and other condiments if you're interested. The main entree were excellent.  Of course i can only speak to what I ordered which was Morqueca de Peixe which comprised of comprised of codfish with lemon juice and coriander seed.  So the dish itself was 2-3 small fillet of the cod (each filet was approximately my two thumbs to together in size.....or think about it as small buffalo wing, but all meat). There was  small piece of plaintain and some greens on the side and slice of mango. The mango was sliced up and inverted so the mango fruit much how Asians do it.  But the mango here was cut up pretty fance and it looked rhomboid shaped instead of cube shaped as how i would do it.  In fact, the mango was easy to eat, you could use the fork to pick at all the meat of the mango. Anyway, i just spent 5 lines on the mango when I should spoke more about the fish.  The fish seasoned very well and tasted great.  It didnt' blow me out of the water, but certainly a solid dish.  Fish was not too dry.  I wonder if it was baked. Overall, food is nothing to get terribly full on, but was it nonetheless a good and healthy meal and good experience with enough food to last you to the late afternooon.  If  you're want to get full meal, you should take your $12 to subway and can get 2 foot long subs. Anyways, great place for weekday lunch if you're off work, but not sure if i would get back to work on time if I had work that day.  I have time in the future I'd like to try there weekend brunch.",0.9987,0.83,0.161,0.009,0.5551722802942316

Our entrees were uniformly excellent.:  Roupa velha, a mildly-spiced pulled pork dish with onions and collard greens. Brazilian fish stew, cod flavored with coriander.. Brazilian top sirloin, thin strips of beef grilled with onions. Dessert was a wonderful two-layered combination of flan and red velvet cake, accompanied by a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream drizzled with lime sauce. Open only for breakfast, lunch, and Sunday brunch.  No liquor service, but BYOB-friendly.  They don't really have their own parking lot, but an adjacent lot belonging to the United Center is likely to be available when nothing is going on at the Center, which is to say most of the time.",0.9612,0.889,0.099,0.012,0.4686458333333333

You can arrive early and just hang out in her living room before your seating time. There is street parking, but there is also a parking lot next to her building. At 2pm, Jorgina came up and started checking everyone in and then escorted you down to the basement where the meal will be served.

Farofa- looks like quinoa. A little sweet. I liked it. 6. Orange Salad 7. Vinaigrette 8. Wings- Oriental style, these were ok. Nothing out of the ordinary 9. Beef Ribs- Excellent. They are very tender. 10. For dessert- it was a red velvet and flan cake.  It is BYOB, so feel free to bring your own drinks.

2012-07-10,5.0,"As one of Chicago's best kept secrets, and apparently the city's only Brazilian restaurant, Sinha is absolutely worth the trip and delivers a really unique experience. My boyfriend and I took the CTA route 126 bus from downtown for the weekday lunch/brunch special, which is available weekdays from 11:30 AM to 2PM. Upon arriving to the house, we discovered that you have to ring the little buzzer on the outside gate to be let in. We were seated at one of the communal tables, where we proceeded to make friends with the people already sitting there. They showed us their plates and explained what all the dishes were, which definitely helped us decide what to order, although I'm sure that every single one of the lunch entrees is delicious! So, here is the deal with the weekday lunch/brunch:  First, you give Jorgina your order for which entree you'd like (ranging from options like shrimp and fish stew to steak, and even a tofu dish). After ordering, you can get up and go to the buffet in the rear of the room, where you help yourself to your pre-meal delicious rice and beans, as is customary in Brazil. There are also beverages available to order, like mango juice and teas. At some point before entrees arrive, you will get a little appetizer (for instance, we got yucca/cheese balls with a pineapple salsa... to die for!) Finally, Jorgina comes with your entrees, and from there you can also order dessert afterwards. My boyfriend ordered the steak and I got the fish stew. Each came with a fried plantain and perfectly sliced mango (to see what the plates look like, check out the pictures I've uploaded!). The fish was so fresh, and the steak was done perfectly- flavorful and authentic. Jorgina was such a sweetheart as we chatted with her about the food and Brazil. Overall, we would come back to Sinha in a heartbeat. In the future, I would especially like to try the brunch, which is available on weekends with two seatings at both 2 and 4 PM. I would also assume that their catering is fantastic... something to keep in mind if you're having a wedding and want some really unique, reasonably priced and flavorful ethnic cuisine!",0.9944,0.844,0.146,0.01,0.5768689196108552

She didn't have the dancers but did have a solo guitarist with a wonderful voice playing. Also she said the outside seating is on hold but hopes to get that in the near future.

2012-06-03,3.0,"I had heard excellent things about the cuisine since several friends had gone there for brunch or attended an event catered by our hostess, Jorgina.   Her restaurant is located on west Adams, and is open for Sunday brunch by reservation/appointment only.  Although no one checked up on us when we walked in.  The restaurant is in her home.  We entered on the first floor for hors d'oeuvres and beverages while we waited to be called to brunch. It was a warm summer day and although her home was comfortable, there is no air conditioning nor ceiling fans.  It is also BYOB.  Jorgina showed up about 20 minutes after we got there for a 2pm seating, ushering us to the lower level where there is seating for about 25 people on the same level as the kitchen.  The food is served buffet style, but first she takes you on a culinary explanation of the dishes and their origin which is information.  Jorgina is personable, charming and a gracious hostess. The buffet had black beans cooked with pork, basmati rice, pulled pork and sausage, yucca, a sauteed chiffonade of collard greens which were not immediately recognizable.  Entering the kitchen there is more food: grilled vegetables including peppers, eggplant, steamed broccoli, fresh fruit, mushrooms & peas, a chicken dish that I believe was called chicken bola, an eggplant pie (a la parmesan style) an assortment of chutneys, shrimp empanadas, grilled steak (to order) and forgive me if I missed a dish or two...there was a lot! Overall the food was good, not stellar just good.  Jorgina makes the event with her personality and outgoing demeanor.  I heard from others that there are sometimes Brazilian dancers the liven things up, but we were not treated to such entertainment the day I went.   I found many of the dishes lacking in spice.  The yucca was ground to a powder and was ""sandy"" in texture, I didn't get it nor did I get the addition of hard boiled eggs.  The pulled pork was dry and chewy.  The grilled vegetables were puny and very thinly sliced, while the chicken bola was lacking in spice, although well prepared.  The steak cooked to order was good, just ordinary sirloin.  I enjoyed the shrimp empanadas encased in a cornmeal based crust.  The combination of mushrooms and peas was delicious, while the assortment of chutneys didn't deliver on the promised ""punch.""   It was hot in the room and I was glad I didn't drink any alcohol.  They served some sort of flavored tea which was refreshing and iced water.  The service was pleasant and overall it was a nice experience.  I believe she is open for lunch during the week.  There is a 2pm and 4pm seating for brunch. The complete brunch is $30 and is probably worth it, but as pleasant as it was the food didn't bowl me over.  If you haven't had Caribbean/African/Brazilian food and want to experience this type of cuisine, definitely go.  It was a good experience but doubt if I will return.",0.9975,0.817,0.16,0.023,0.5930232558139534

Brazilian Top Sirloin (Pinanha) was amazing, as she came personally to the table and of course she explained all the local foods of her country and how some may contain peanuts just in case anyone is allergic, that only made me smile because of her caring. Then there was the Black beans cooked Brazilian style with shreds of pork. WOW! She also served up some plantains in a little butter. Yucca Croquettes (Blinho de aipim) some cassava cake for dessert and flan which of course was to die for! Oh did I mention that this is an all you can eat buffet?

As you enjoy the appetizers, a couple dances to Latin music and they do dances such as the meringue and the cha-cha. The next set of entertainers are dressed in Carnivale attire and perform traditional dances as they involve the audience. It is very entertaining.  After eating you are ushered downstairs to enjoy a wonderful buffet. It is open seating and the owner explains each dish. My husband and I enjoyed collard greens sauteed in olive oil and garlic, pulled pork that was so tender we couldn't tell what type of meat we were eating and tillapia fillets with a cream sauce and dill (I didn't like it, but my hubby loved it). We also enjoyed black beans and rice with shredded chicken, potatoes and mushrooms in a curry-like sauce, shrimp skewers, veggie strif-fry, Brazilian chicken fajitas and several salads. Traditionally, Brazilian food is not very spicy so there's a variety of herbs and sauces on the side to spice up your dish to your liking as well as orange slices to help with digestion. For desert we were served red velvet cake with flan on top. We did not enjoy the desert but we were one of the few people that didn't enjoy it. Although the staple items on the buffet remain the same, the side dishes change a little.  If you are looking for a chic, cozy Sunday brunch/dinner with live entertainment and open to new experiences this is definitely the place you want to visit. Free parking, affordable, great atmosphere, clean, safe, good food, great service and good entertainment-WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR!!!!!",0.9982,0.769,0.227,0.004,0.5651242424242424

Don't come here unless you're ready to get out of your comfort zone. I came here with my brother, girlfriend, and friend. It was my brother's idea and when we got to the restaurant, I was really skeptical. Umm... It was in a house?! We were seated in their living room for appetizers? Interesting. There was some entertainment, which was totally unexpected! The cook was unbelievably friendly. She mothered us. (Reminded me of my mom or grandmother). Don't have a family in Chicago? Come here. The main course was ready and we were escorted down to their basement? Even more interesting! It was like a Thanksgiving dinner, but we were sharing a meal with strangers! It's not a big basement, so talk about being cozy with everyone! After dinner, we went back upstairs to dance. Although they made me enter in a booty-shaking contest in front of everyone (which was VERY embarrassing), I had so much fun. My girlfriend better not post that video you youtube!!! LOL.

2010-01-24,3.0,"There are two parts to this review: the food and the catering. Let's start with the food service. We went there for her legendary Sunday brunches, which has two seatings for the day. You are greeted up the main stairs (almost a story up from the street level) with delicious, freshly-squeezed juice and a huge series dippable treats and great live music. You're surrounded by a bright, happy room with many plants, mirrors and natural light. When it's time for you to eat, downstairs to the grade level you go and enjoy a large selection of fruits, cooked veggies and meats in the kitchen. The food is reminiscent of my travels to Brazil but a little more limited. The waitstaff is attentive and helpful, just after you're introduced to the cuisine du jour by Chef Jorgina herself. It's though you're sitting in someone's dining room. And there's not a ton of people here, but it still feels a little cramped. Still the food more than makes up for it. After brunch, you are treated to the outdoor patio that is decorated by brightly-colored tableclothes and walls with growing grapes she uses to make her own wine. Enjoy coffee and Jorgina's storytelling out back, then you head out to the parking lot. Now... The second part. Our idea of the brunch was a taste-testing (at Jorgina's request) to get a taste for her food for our wedding in a few months. We enjoyed the experience so much we met with Jorgina a few months later to discuss our options. She was very eager to work with us, even meeting us at 8p to accommodate our schedule. But after the initial meeting, and after e-mailing and calling a couple times, we never heard back from her. We were very excited to work with her. I hope nothing happened. In all, it's DEFINITELY worth visiting for brunch. Definitely. And it would've been four-stars if not for the bad taste in my mouth for the catering. But it definitely doesn't affect her ability to make mouth-watering food. Enjoy!",0.9955,0.817,0.17,0.013,0.4986263736263737

My boyfriend secretly booked this by-appointment-only gourmet tour for our 1st year anniversary. When we first parked our car in the private lot next to the house, I wasn't sure what I should expect from it. We went in the house, I was stunned by the relaxed and friendly atmosphere. The interior design was amazing, amazing, amazing! It was a recreation of Brazilian ""belle epoque"" decor with palm tress and exotic collections from all over the world, including 17th c French and 19c China. We were offered amazing appetizer - amazing grapes and cheese and butter - not the ordinary one you imagine, when we were waiting on the first floor. The home-made Mango juice was incredible, too. All of a sudden, 2 Samba dancers came down and did a Samba performance. They gave us a free lesson afterwards to burn more calorie before we went downstairs to eat Georgina's home-made Brazilian cuisine.  The home-made cuisine was a 3 table buffet with unlimited Brazilian steaks, yup, the thin, tender, juicy, red, and slippery type of Brazilian steaks. Other dishes include pork knees, fish fillet in home-made sauce, and more. At the end, they serve us with the most exquisite pudding and ice cream.

After an hour or so we went downstairs where we were seated, given information and directions about the buffet of food, Brazilian culture, and the SInha business. I would highly recommend this as a fun Sunday outing with friends. It is a reasonable $30 total (BYOB, no hard alcohol).  However, my 3 star rating is due to the authenticity of the food. While it was quite tasty and fairly authentic, the owner expressed that she takes some liberties and risks with her dishes. The feijoada was very good, but did not taste like the true and authentic dish. So aside from the authenticity of the actual food, I definitely recommend this place as a fun and tasty event.

2008-09-03,3.0,"Read the whole review so you do not do a disservice to this venue.  This is not a completely positive review. I made reservations for 3:30 and sat for almost 2 hours before the show and the meal. NOT GOOD. I should have been told. I had to change my entire plans for the evening as I assumed the reservations meant we would be seated at 3:30. We had to eat and run. I would have left had my son not wanted to stay. This is a place like a dinner theater and yet it is small and intimate. The staff, or more correctly, the friends and family, work as a friendly happy team to make your experience delightful.  Everyone serves, everyone greats, everyone cleans up, and everyone cares. This is a real close group of people who all want you to be happy and they ooze sincerity. It appears that everyone there is a family. Even their children help out. This place is not a buffet where you go, eat the food and leave. This place is part buffet and part show or exhibit. It has indoor and outdoor seating. It can also be rented for parties. It is not handicapped accessible so do not even try if you cannot do steps. What is most amazing is how they do a show, cook and serve the food in a normal house (2 flat). The space is genuinely small, yet they pull it off for the most part. The food is very fresh, well made, and delicious. The kitchen is spotless and open to the guests. It is obvious that they take pride in the immaculate conditions both in the kitchen and dining areas. While we waited others arrived. It is BYOB, but they have mango juice and water. The juice is watered down, but I like it that way so it is not too sweet. They serve your wine and I do not know if there is a corkage fee. They serve fried palm hearts and fried chicken balls which were delightful. They kept making them as long as people kept eating them which we did. There must have been 30-40 people there. One birthday party and a few couples out for the experience. The show which came almost two hours (yes, I said two hours) after we arrived was interesting, but sophomoric. Anyone who has seen a real Tango, for example the performance of Forever Tango, would be disappointed. It is not that the attractive dancers did not care or dance well, but they were unemotional and there was no overt sexuality, no expression of freedom. I felt it was more of a demonstration than a performance.  Then came the carnival dancers and they were exceptional. My son and I had lots of fun and took lots of pictures. The costumes were gorgeous and the dancers enthusiastic. The male dancer was the epitome of Brazilian machismo. He was a powerful dancer and yet exuded congeniality and true warmth. He set the tone for the whole evening as if he were a cruise ship concierge; he was always asking if we were happy, needed a drink, etc.   Next the food was ready and there was some confusion as to when and how we start. I was embarrassed by the confusion as I was told to go downstairs and then told to wait. When we got down stairs the only table available was by the stairs. The others were for large groups. We sat at a table for four near the stairs. Consequently, I was bumped repeatedly during the meal. NOT GOOD.  This is a point I wish to emphasize. THE SPACE IS TOO SMALL AND MAKES DINING DIFFICULT. If the basement room were full it would be impossible, but it was only half full. The tables were beautifully set, if cheaply done. The food was very nice, if uneventful. There was a chicken curry type dish, pork and seafood. There were vegetables, a bland eggplant dish and salads. The desert was a bread pudding which was so good I could have eaten many more. The buffet was all you could eat with water and juice. The cost was $30/person without tip. I might throw a summer dinner party there in the back yard patio for ten to twelve people. I would not come back for the food or show individually. They have a private lot for parking which was full when we arrived. They have two seating's each weekend it appears. Call and ask questions before you go so you know what you are getting into. You may have to wait and wait and wait. One last embarrassment; I paid, left a decent tip and left. As I was leaving I was confronted for not paying. NOT GOOD. I had to explain that I had paid downstairs, but I received a stair of incredulity. Thankfully the owner came upstairs to say good bye or I would have had to pull out the receipt. I still wish these wonderful people success and I hope they get a bigger place. That would make a world of difference. I can see this kind of place being a top Chicago venue if they expand and market it properly.",0.9989,0.793,0.163,0.044,0.5486643847108963

It is served with malgueta peppers (HOT!) and sliced sweet oranges, arroz brasileiro (sauteed white rice), couve (kale), and farofa (finely ground manioc root (cassava)----it reminds me of cornmeal---this goodness is what you sprinkle on the feijoada or on your meats...it has also carrots, raisins, slices of egg, nuts added in...this buffet was just crazy silly!!!!

2008-01-07,5.0,"Did I ever think in a million years that I'd have to shake my booty in front of 25 strangers before being allowed to eat brunch early one Sunday afternoon at Sinha's? Or that my dining companion would have to shake his caboose, too?  Well, that's the price of admission (that and $25) at Sinha's, one of the most unusual and amazing brunch destinations I've been to since moving to Chicago in '04.  We were completely unprepared for the what awaited us at Sinha's but loved every minute of it. From the time we were buzzed into the front door and greeted by the lovely Anna, to the group dancing and the booty showdown (all done in the name of winning an instructional DVD), to the gorgeous and warm garden-level dining area and amazing buffet, we were wide-eyed and thrilled by both the spectacle and the quality of the experience.  If you do want to enjoy a Caipiroiska or Caipirinha during your brunch, don't forget to bring your vodka or your cachaca as SInha's is BYOB. You will have to make your drinks yourself, but Sinha's will supply the limes and sugar, and any advice you need to put together a tasty drink.  To be clear, the food is Brazilian home cooking, not fine dining or regional cuisine. The food is fresh, delicious, and very satisfying. Your $25 pays for an all-you-can-eat buffet that, with some forward warning to Jorgina, can include ample vegetarian options. She always has specific typical Brazilian dishes available (see other reviews for descriptions) and then puts together the rest depending on her whim. At our brunch she made a number of Chinese- and Indian-influenced flavors, all delicious. Call early, make a reservation, and bring your appetite.

2007-10-16,4.0,"Hidden away in the shadow of the United Center, is one of the most unusual places I have ever had the pleasure to eat at. Sinha (means lady of the house) Elegant Cuisine is Brazilian cooking at it's finest. And the name is apt- as this is a single family home that has been rezoned to be a restaurant for private gatherings.    Jorgina Pereira, the owner, started a small catering business about 12 years ago because her family and friends loved her cooking.  Today- she opens her home to private parties where she and her amazing staff cook up specialties from Brazil.  I was amazed as I drove down Adams Street that this place actually existed as there is no signage or anything to indicate a place of business. She sets up a small bar in the back (we had mojitos with sugar cane stirrers) and there are women dressed in the fanciful dresses and headpieces that make you feel that you are at a carnival!  We had cocktails upstairs and then went downstairs for dinner.  It's like sitting in someone's dining room as the food is set up buffet style along one wall and there are a variety of tables and chairs.  The food was great!  Not too spicy, but with the opportunity to have it be as spicy as you want.  On the night I was there- there was salmon, Feijoada ( a Brazilian dish) many vegetable dishes, breads and cakes and some type of a pork dish.  All were delicious!   After dinner we went back up stairs for cocktails and dancing. There were Brazilian musicians and we kicked off our shoes and danced in front of the fireplace in the front room! All in all- I'd suggest this as a place to host your next party or business gathering.  It is unexpected, fun and really like having dinner at a friend's house.  I was also told that there is a Sunday brunch from 2-6 which is open to the public but that reservations are necessary. Check out the ""lady of the house"" and you'll wonder why someone didn't tell you about this place before now!",0.9902,0.876,0.12,0.004,0.48159905937683717
2007-06-02,5.0,"You know how to shake your hips .... don't you?   ... but especially if you don't, won't or haven't yet  ...     :) If you can't go to Rio, Rio will come to you here.   Are you adventurous? ...looking for something different to do? ...love exotic food? *This* is the place for you. Are you looking to celebrate an occasion? ...thinking of how to top off your next ""number"" with a client or that special person in your life? *This* is where to step outside your box. It is ""underground dining"" at its best ... open to the public *only* if reservations are made. The crowd: Mix of ages with an emphasis on Brazilians and Brazilophiles. Cost: $30 (all-you-can-eat buffet & dance lessons!) BYOB: Champagne for mimosas, cachaca for caipirinhas or vodka for caipiroskas.  Your customized ""punch"" will be made for you. After so many years in IT, Brazil native, Jorgina Pereira, decided to be her own ""CEO"" and started doing Brazilian catering full time.   She told me, ""After a while, I was so homesick for my food and music and I thought if I can make a little part [of] Brazil in Chicago, the winters won't seem so bad.""   And, indeed, the Sunday brunches she has been hosting for a year in her elegant three-story Victorian near the United Center add a lot of warmth to our often chilly and very windy city. Periera welcomes guests at 2 p.m. into her antique-filled first floor salon with appetizers and drinks, inviting them to the lower-level dining room when the brunch is ready. There, they find colorful fabric-covered tables bearing rows of pretty chafing dishes and counters of colorful salads and meats. Brunchers can gather at one of the large or small tables in the dining room or in the sunny back yard, which is mostly protected from the sun by a big canopy. Some folks mingle at shared tables while others chat with friends -- a group of students learning Portuguese are regular patrons.   And if you think you are ""done"" after eating ... not a chance... the best if yet to come.  After brunch, diners can return to the upstairs parlor for a dance performance by a hot Brazilian couple---donning feathers and all, Carnival style---- who will teach you how to samba or salsa dance.  ... or you can lounge around the house as the afternoon fades into early evening. Menu highlights:  Feijoada (Brazilian national dish of rice, beans and smoked and dried meat), collard greens with orange salad and farofa (cassava flour) and fried bananas. Wide assortment of salads, roasted and stewed meats, and rich coconut desserts. Dress light ...  Come for the wild feast.   Stay for the hot and steamy dance.    To say that you'll be glad you did this ... is ... well ... putting it mildly.   You'll think as though you have to catch the next ""flight"" home as you'll feel you've been away on vacation after this experience.",0.9976,0.836,0.151,0.014,0.5259476031215161
2006-12-26,5.0,"If you are looking for a completely different experience, complete with culture, great food and a dancefloor, allow me to recommend Jorgina and Sinha Elegant Cuisine. Jorgina, a carioca (Brazilian from Rio) has opened her home and turned it into a small, intimate dining room. Jorgina started as a catererer, then rezoned her home to open her restaurant. It is only open for parties and special occassions by appointment during the week, however every Sunday she features a wonderful traditional Brazilian brunch. It is a BYOB, so find some cacacha and bring it along as Jorgina's staff will make you the most wonderful caporinhas. This is a very special place, if you are looking for something different. Bring a group of friends and have a great time. Jorgina may even have some surprises for you in her living room / dancehall! A must try!!",0.9883,0.764,0.236,0.0,0.6861344537815125
