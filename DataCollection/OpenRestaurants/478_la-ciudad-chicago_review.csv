2017-08-24,1.0,"I have no earthly idea how this place has so many five star reviews. I'm going to indulge in an unnecessarily detailed rant for a minute just to give you a feel for how bad it is.  To begin, the owner looked surprised when I came into the empty restaurant with my date. At peak dinner hours. Clearly people aren't frequenting this restaurant which should have made us think twice about eating there.  Chips and salsa. Should be hard to mess up right? The red sauce was stringy and congealed in strange ways. The green sauce was clearly freezer burnt, giving it an overall tang. The chips tasted very stale yet were somehow really greasy. The rice and beans, staples that even I (an aggressively white person) can make at home were bad. The rice was so dry it looked dusty. The beans tasted like they were left on a stovetop for days and they were scraped onto a paper plate because you were so hungover you'd eat anything if it meant not having to cook something.  My entree was a suizo burrito with chorizo. The sauce it was topped with tasted like chef boyardee pizza sauce. The chorizo inside tasted like the inside of a chef boyardee ravioli. The grease explosion that accompanied my meal covered my whole plate and made me feel sick just looking at it. It tasted like I was eating a giant chef boyardee ravioli which in THEORY sounds quite nice but is actually horrific in practice.  This is a mom and pop operation so I was trying to give it the benefit of the doubt but this is the worst Mexican food and maybe food in general I've ever had. I'm pretty sure the guy I took here will never speak to me again. It was that bad. This restaurant cockblocked me. I immediately regretted spending money here.

After waiting an hour or so for our cuisine, 3 of our orders were wrong. We understood mistakes might happen until the waitress told us that the quesadilla that we did not order was in fact the chile relleno we order. After she walked away and left us dumbfounded, we called her back and advised her it was NOT a chile relleno but in fact WAS a quesadilla. And I ordered a specific meal that came with a chile relleno and was told by another waitress that the meal ordered does not come with what I was asking for. I told her if she could grab a menu so I can show her, (very politely I might add as I've worked in the business in my college years). At that point the manager came storming out and brings me the menu and says ""show me what you ordered"".  Not a hello, excuse me sir, but ""show me what you ordered"". I then pointed out the meal in question where he reponds with ""oh, oh ok we'll have that right out for you"". He then comes out 15 min later and with a piece of meat and states, and I quote ""this is the biggest piece we have right now"", and places the plate in front of me. While that was taking place my two other friends were trying to get their orders situated as well, raw meat, cold food. That is when the table across from us (who were there for a bachelorette party) were telling the waitress ""this is NOT what we ordered. This is the 3rd time miss. We're going to leave, I'm sorry but we cannot wait another 90 min for them to finally get our meals right"". They then proceeded to walk out. We weren't even drinking, thankfully, and to receive that type of service was surprising when we read great reviews form earlier in the year. We felt like we were imposing because we had to continue to return food. To celebrate a friend's 30th bday and promotion there and go through what we went through, utterly disappointing. The food that we did receive was not bad but average at most. But the service could have made it that much better.

2016-10-11,2.0,"I have been to La Ciudad countless times now. I waited three and a half years to write this review.  I have lived in Uptown for four now. At first, La Ciudad was really good. But looking back, it was mostly ""good"" because I was on a date with my then boyfriend and now husband. I had the mini al pastor tacos. They were delicious. I don't remember what he had, but he agreed his was okay too. We did complain after the fact, about the portion-of-food to cost ration. You don't get very much of anything for what you pay.  Fast forward three years and here we are. I have ordered takeout from La Cuidad countless times and each time it gets progressively worse.  I always get the taco dinner. 3 tacos, rice and beans. The first two times I got it, it was phenomenal. The al pastor tacos were filled with fresh pineapples and perfectly seasoned, garnished with onions and cilantro. The beans were smooth and flavorful.The rice was cooked just right and tasted like a close second to mom's mexican rice.  It comes with two lime wedges, two fresh homemade salsas, and a small paper bag of homemade tortilla chips. While the lime and salsa is always up to par, the tortilla chips are hit or miss. When they are miss, they are undercooked and/or to thick, and/or stale, and/or too salty. But oh man, when they are hit, they are so damn good! Flaky, crisp, with just the right amount of salt. The last few times I've had my taco dinner, it has been gradually ""too something,"" and not in a good way.  Today, was likely my last time trying La Ciudad for a while. And the kicker is that I told myself that the last time I ate there. Today, the rice was basically white rice that was coated slightly red for color. I mean it was bad. The beans were equally bad. Bland city. The tortillas were undercooked and the steak taco was dry. Everything just tasted ""rushed."" There were more chunks of pineapple in my taco than al pastor. And it was definitely a 'miss' on the tortilla chips today. To make matters worse, I was told it would take 10 minutes for my order to be ready for pick-up. I intentionally arrived 20 minutes later. My order was not ready. I did however, get a smile from the chef. A smile. 20 minutes later.  After waiting a few more minutes, I took home my taco dinner and well, as I said, it tasted ""rushed."" I was disappointed to say the least.  You can go to much cheaper Mexican restaurants in Uptown and get twice the amount of food without all the extra costs for fanfare.  You had me at hello and lost me at $14.20 for a lack-luster taco dinner.",0.9236,0.82,0.105,0.075,0.400185881370092

2016-05-24,5.0,"Delicious Mexican food that was very reasonably priced for the quality. Service is friendly, decor is more upscale but still maintains the nice ambiance of a cafe.  One of the most memorable things here is the chips. The chips have a very nice crispy and addictive texture and flavor to them. Just the right amount of saltiness with a nice strong flavor of corn. The salsas were home made and provided a nice refreshing, but not too salty dip for the chips. The burrito with al pastor was nicely grilled on the outside to provide a slightly crisp tortilla that was filled with fresh ingredients. The tomatoes inside were diced in larger chunks and complemented the nicely marinated and slightly fat pork inside. Overall, I loved the texture and mixture of ingredients. The steak tacos were paired with onion and cilantro (not cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce as one might expect). The steak was nicely seared and cut into large chunks which paired perfectly with the onion and cilantro. All the ingredients in this taco were bursting with freshness. The refried beans and rice were also seasoned and prepared with a nice texture. Unlike many restaurants which provide and wet and sloppy mess of these two items, they were actually prepared in a delicious manner and go well with the chips. Overall, very good and fresh cuisine with great textures. I'll be back again soon.",0.9973,0.709,0.27,0.021,0.6199012775842044

Last night, after a 2 year hiatus, we decided to go back.  It was great to see the owner Hugo and he welcomed us back with hugs and well wishes.  He ended up leaving shortly after we arrived.  It was not busy with only another 3 tables in addition to ours.  Our waiter was nice, but not the most attentive..filling the water, checking on us and it would had been nice early on to explain why our order was taking so long.  Once he served us our meals, he said they had a large to go order and that is why it took so long.  Something should had been said or done early on to let us know. We both ordered steak burritos, with retried beans and corn.  My burrito was the suiza.  My burrito had a huge layer of cheese that had no tomato sauce as stated on the menu underneath.  I literately peeled the cheese off of it as it was so much, not grilled and again no sauce.  The burrito lacked flavor as my friend's, the corn was not fresh and tasted chewy and the beans was watery and cold.   I could not believe it.  My friend agreed the same with his meal.  When I called the waiter over about the beans, he didn't take the plate away, he just brought us more of the same beans on a plate...again not heated well. We called over what we thought was the manager and told her of our meal and she argued with me that there was tomato sauce on the burrito and that if I wanted to more I should have asked.  My friend said, no there wasnt any on there.  She had mentioned the burrito is oily and that it may have soaked in...(Are you kidding me?)   We sent the meals back with very little ate off the plates and again...we sat there until I had to call someone over again to get our check. Hugo, the owner had called earlier and was going to pay for our meals anyway so we were not charged. Both of us were very grateful for this, but wished we had a better experience. (We wished he would had came back as promised earlier) We are bummed as this was such a great place and don't know what happened.  We really was hoping after two years things had changed. We won't be back again.  Please get back to the way you once served and the quality of the food.",0.9932,0.834,0.135,0.031,0.4112781954887218

We were told by the waiter that we should order the carne asada because it was great - three of us did - but it was tough and chewy and only about 1/3 the size of the steak we have had at other similar restaurants.  He told me I'd love the enchilada that came with my entree but he never brought it.  My husband found a rubber band in his food but he didn't want to complain.   The restaurant is BYOB and we brought a bottle wine and two beers.  We asked for beer glasses and he told us to just use the wine glasses...  He uncorked the wine but didn't help with the beer.  My son had a bottle opener on his keychain so we used that but in the end we were charged a corkage fee for the wine and for each beer - $5.00 each - $15.00!  We were never informed that there would be any fees, let alone a $15.00 one!  He was very nice and brought us dessert for Mother's Day and that was kind.  The chicken mole was very good and the chili rellenos was great too but we waited a long time for our bill to come and then the fees were added.  Not good.  My husband and I left before the bill arrived or I would have complained about the problems.  I will call tomorrow.",0.8761,0.815,0.099,0.086,0.6434920634920634

My family and I chose La Ciudad for a birthday dinner - my sister had found it on a ""best BYOB"" list for Chicago, and the list was not wrong. One of the greatest things we have in the city are small, privately owned restaurants and La Ciudad is exactly one of those. Hugo, the owner, was there along with another chef, and the service could not have been better. It was apparent how much pride was taken in the restaurant and providing an enjoyable meal for their guests.  The food was fantastic, delicious guac & freshly fried chips - they were practically steaming right out of the fryer, I've never had such delicious chips. Of the 8 of us, everyone was raving about their meals. The tacos, burritos suizas, steak fajitas were all amazing. Everything was incredibly fresh, light and flavorful; not at all ""heavy and greasy."" For dessert, we shared a couple pieces of tres leches cake and the cool, moist cake was a perfect finish after rich flavors.

It came with a small bag of tortilla chips - barely enough to eat the guac with. Tortilla soup may be good - we'll never know, because instead of the two portions of it that we ordered, we received plain chicken soup (which tasted mostly of celery - we didn't eat it). The bacon-wrapped shrimp were very good - but there were only four shrimp, and the dish costs nearly $20, so that was a rip-off. My chicken enchilada dish was good, though instead of the usual shredded chicken, they give you three chunks of chicken breast with a tortilla draped over each one. The mole sauce dumped on top was tasty, I have to say, but the whole presentation was not what I'd had in mind. Not only that, but I paid an extra dollar for guacamole on the enchiladas, and didn't get it. The accompanying beans were watery and pretty tasteless. In short, a major rip-off. The fact that what food you do get is at least somewhat good doesn't make up for all the mistakes and chintzy-sized servings. Maybe someone eating there, as opposed to ordering delivery, would fare better - at least then you could complain when they bring the wrong soup, or leave off extras that you're paying for.",0.9011,0.829,0.105,0.066,0.5777232142857143

One of the meals I ordered was the Pollo con mole, It tasted just okay; but again, how to you eat mole without tortillas? I figured they would be included but no. I also ordered the mini tacos al pastor. I actually ordered two of these and only got one. (they shorted me tacos! I was hungry! lol) Anyways, as I started eating my tacos, I noticed they were crazy packed with onions. There was more onions than meat on those tacos... shouldn't it be the other way around? One plus is that they actually included the complementary chips that you typically only get when you dine in. That was nice of them.

2014-10-21,5.0,"So its 9:30pm and 4 of us sibling are home alone and I get random craving for a Molten Lava Chocolate cake. I toss this idea of making one to my younger sister and we decided to head to Jewel-Osco to grab the ingredients. I just randomly decided to search yelp for Chocolate Lava cake and La Cuidad was the closest restaurant that showed up. I called them up at around 9:35 to confirm if they do in fact serve Molten Lava Cake.  Soon we head out but realize that they close at 10:00pm so we won't make it in time. I call up the restaurant and ask they can make it to-go. The gentleman on the phone said yes but asked if we wanted to dine in. I told he we won't make it before 10 and he was like, ""Don't worry about it, just come and we will take care of you"". This alone made me very comfortable as the worse thing to do it go into a restaurant 10-15 minutes before closing and 8 out of 10 times, you will receive a very bad service.  We walked in a few minutes later and really liked the quite and cozy atmosphere. We were the only table at the moment but its monday night so no surprises there. After being seated, we were also given complimentary chips and salsa which was pretty good. Fast forward to when our Chocolate Lava Cakes and I can say that for $5.50 a pop, it was a perfect. The only thing I can say is that there wasn't much melted chocolate inside of the cake and it was felt more like a brownie but we were still satisfied. We ordered 4 cakes and each and every single one of us liked it. I asked for an extra scoop of ice cream with my order and they were kind enough to give all of us an extra scoop of ice cream.  I will surely be back to try out some of their main entrees but so far this place will be my go to spot during my random sweet cravings.",0.9952,0.781,0.176,0.043,0.5682027649769585
2014-10-16,5.0,"Bringing Four Loko tall boys to a nice, romantic BYOB restaurant sounded like a fun kind of bad idea when it popped in my head, but as it turns out (to no one's surprise but my own), it's just the bad kind of bad idea.  Don't do this.  No matter how funny you know it'll be to tell your friends you'll handle all the liquor and then show up with two 6-packs of flavored Four Loko to see their horrified faces, it's not worth the repercussions and side effects of drinking Four Loko, which include nausea, vomiting (if you're lucky), heart palpitations, and a headache so hard that the thought of hanging yourself from a shower curtain rod seems like a step up on the enjoyability scale. It's just the absolute worst.  On a related note, I think it speaks to the character of La Ciudad that despite my bringing quite possibly the most degenerate drink of the last decade into their fine establishment, the staff still treated us like royalty and even offered to put our sh*tty beverages on ice... as if it were champagne.  This is probably my favorite restaurant in the city for group dining. I've been on so many group outings and double dates here and everything has always been above and beyond outstanding.  The BYOB factor plays into their success quite a bit, and that they aren't at all picky about what you bring is great. Bring sangria, they'll bring you glasses with ice and an array of chopped up fruit. Bring a Gatorade sports tub with pour spout nozzle full of god only knows what type of moonshine concoction and they'll still treat you as a king amongst men, despite your trailer park beverage bringing.  The area around here with laundromats and dingy liquor stores isn't fantastic or scenic, but there is a free parking lot (invaluable in this part of town), the inside is quaint and romantic, they are really sweet about taking reservations, and in the summer they carve out a small patio area in one of the parking spaces and actually make it look like a really nice place to dine.  When I come here, my group usually insists on guacamole and/or ceviche. The ceviche is bomb; the guac is fine, but I should also note that I've never had guac at any establishment that I thought was all that great.  For main dishes, I recommend checking out their chalkboard of specials because they do a stellar job on coming up with unique items, as my dining partners can attest. Me? I always get the same damn thing because I love it so much: The Camarones Diablo. I just can't get enough of those spicy little skrimps... plus there are few things I enjoy more than eating the exoskeleton of a weaker creature. Empowering, amiright? No? Well fine, but that doesn't change the fact that these shrimps are damn delicious.  One thing you absolutely NEED to get, is the Tres Leches dessert. And don't be shy about telling your friends that you aren't willing to share. Get your own -- it's every man for himself in the dessert department here and you'll all be better friends for it. It's a dish that's just too damn good to share.  The prices here are pretty damn economical for a romantic-ish spot, so I highly recommend it for a date night. Def uber it out here because it's very easy to get crunk here and then uber it elsewhere for a high chance of doin' it because it'll just put you all in the mood (unless you drink Four Loko, then you'll just want to die). Dinner + apps usually run us around $20 a person and of course we BYO Boone's Farm so that saves us some pennies as well.",0.9977,0.718,0.194,0.088,0.6024218749999999

2014-07-10,2.0,Hola!!! So my friend had his dinner party here. I like to try new places n ive had my fair share of mexican food around the city. I dont like to be mean....I just like to say the truth...n truth is...the food I tasted sucked and it wasnt worth the money in my opinion. Smh Lets start with me recieving the mexican burger..I wanted to try something different than the typical tacos..burritos. Now this burger should had been called mexican or whatever burger its called...but i do have a great new name for it... a HOT MESS BURGER...yup I said it.... a HOT MESS BURGER.... now let me explain why I thought this burger didnt meet the price of $14 lol This burger had 3 types of pig parts on the burger shared by a cow patty... the 3 pig parts is this.... ham..slice of ham... bacon....mmm bacon....and a hot dog...on top of a cow burger....a McDonald's size portion patty might I add.... this combination screams heart attack. ..or a ghetto person created this experiment in their home......drunk. It also contains avocado...tomato...and a slice of half a jalapeño. Im guessing these ingredients are the mexican touch. This my friends is a hot mess burger...not worth $14 if I were to give this a price I would say free created at a BBQ after u drank 5 hard shots of liqour. .....I do have a great idea u can add as a new mexican burger... a fat burger...cheese...avocado slices...tomato...bacon..roasted poblano...with a chiptole mayonnaise on a fresh delicious bun ...now that's a mexican burger I would create...sounds better than a mixture of pig parts n charge an arm and a leg. I also ordered an appetizer of chorizo quesadilla... it wasnt special..shouldve just called it a taco ... came with 3 chorizo cheese on a corn tortilla...portions were small... ×_× I tried my friends stuffed poblano... that was good. Yay ....also tried another dish of shrimp wrapped in bacon which was also good.  Would I come back? Nope. Overpriced for the quality of food. Also they r great at cleaning the table...very fast...so quick they took away my small piece of chorizo quesadilla I didnt even finish ×_× ...I mean I was going to finish it ×_× .... also they brought my friend a bday cake we got for him... after the happy birthday song once again they grabbed the cake quik as shyt. I mean... can we take pictures of him and the cake...together? Lol Also warning if u bring a party... no split checks... pay ALL together ^_^ ..so have fun pulling ur calculator out ur galaxy and iphones n have a fiesta....arrrrrrrrriiiiibaaaaa!!!

We opted to sit outside since the weather was nice and the patio was actually very nice. It is fenced in with a high white fence which makes feel less like you're in a strip mall.  Now the important part- the food, presentation and service were phenomenal! We were a little apprehensive about the prices and truthfully they are a bit high for the area. BUT they brought out endless chips and salsa which was extremely tasty! I mean these people brought out extra chips without even asking us if we wanted more! The salsa was no ordinary canned salsa either, it was very authentic.  I ordered the chicken burrito suizo which was very good. SO filling! I was able to save the rest for lunch tomorrow which I am looking forward to. My fiancé got the steak tacos and was a little worried they wouldn't fill him up but they are so overstuffed he was able to bring one home as well.

It turns out that it's in the style of mexico city, mostly modern.  Thank you, now I understand. Fair enough) The restaurant is in a shocking location, frankly.  A (very) crappy strip mall on a questionable street in uptown.   So to see the high regard given via yelp, 4.5 stars, made me think that this must be a hidden gem.  Why, otherwise, would there be hundreds of reviews for something in an out of the way location such as this.   If you're coming on a weekend, make a reservation.  They are packed. The decor is a stab at modern mexican.  If you like red walls, you're in luck.  Overall, it's nice enough.  Not too large of a space, but ok in most regards.  Not fancy.  The bathroom is thru the kitchen, for example. We were seated and were served chips with two types of salsas.  Wonderful,  Wonderful, Wonderful.  A+ in every regard.  Fresh and a nice blend of flavors.  Pace Picante sauce take note. The service was excellent throughout. Although at one point, the waiter suggested that we not fill up on chips since our food was going to be delicious.   Mind your business. We ordered quickly.  We went with what looked like the house specialties.  She had lamb with mole. I had mexican paella.  Both were very meh.  I like lamb, but doused with mole, it was just terrible. Glad I didn't order that.  The mexican paella was bits of fish/chicken/etc deep fried over rice. Not much flavor. A disappointment.  I only had a few bites, to be honest.  On the plus side, the presentation was nice.   Maybe my expectations were too high or we ordered the wrong stuff.  But once the food showed up, my opinion of this place took a nose dive.  If I did go back, I'd definitely order something different.",0.9928,0.779,0.164,0.057,0.5551469098277608
2013-03-16,2.0,"Reviews and being in the area inspired us to check this spot nestled in a strip mall in Uptown out. It's always busy so reservations are encouraged. We were late but luckily sat immediately.  It's an interesting decor that I found a bit 80's, however, my well traveled and smart dining partner informed me it is contemporary Mexican decor and rather stylish there. It's BYOB so we brought a pack of delicious Daisy Cutter. We learned later they charged us $4.50 corkage fee for the CANNED IPA. I've experienced BYOBs charging corkages if they have a partial or full bar, but this spot doesn't, so I found that lame.  We started with complimentary chips with salsa. It was good and had plenty of kick; one was a salsa verde and one was a smoky chipotle. They charge for a refill of chips which they bring-lame!  With Yelp check-in you get a free appetizer (Thanks Yelp!!). But were informed we could only get the ceviche. It was three different colored chips with tilapia and shrimp ceviche on top. It was bland.  Upon server recommendation my dining partner, a big fan of seafood, got the Mexican Paella. They both encouraged me to get the Lamb with mole.  The Paella had fish, calamari, shrimp, and chicken on a bed of Spanish rice with some peppers. Everything was battered and fried except the tiny shrimp and chicken bits. He didn't care for it. I was more fond of the dish and would give it a B- if you are in the mood for fried seafood. Like I said, the shrimp were teeny, it wasn't what we were expecting, and there was one BIG piece of funky calamari that was scary but the rings were good (though small).  My lamb with mole was served with mashed potatoes. Great presentation, however, did not taste good. I'm a mole fan and didn't care for the overly spiced sauce. Way too much cinnamon, cloves, and I think ginger. The potatoes were not well prepared... bland city and had undercooked chunks. The meat was edible, but overpowered by the spice cabinet emptied in the sauce and not juicy or tender. He didn't care for it either.

And they were great about letting us spilt the bill between multiple people. Cons: -While the service was friendly, it was sooooooo slow.  And a little spotty.  We waited almost an hour for our entrees.  I know we were a big group, but the restaurant is small and many groups that came it after us were being served before us.  They were apologetic after a while and continued to bring out chips, but we just really wanted our enchiladas at that point. -Order inaccuracy.  There was a lot of confusion over who ordered what, which stuffing/sauces someone ordered on their enchiladas, and some plates arrived much later than others.  Not sure how this was an issue either as they were using a very small menu that evening that only had 5 or 6 entree options to choose from. -Bill issues-- After reviewing our bill we realized that it belonged to one of the other large parties dining there. They brought back the correct bill and while our total was about $30 less than the incorrect bill, the gratuity (that they automatically add for a big party) was about $4 more... not sure who did the math on that one, but we weren't pleased.  Especially after our lengthy wait for our food.

I had the queso fondido con chorizo and really enjoyed the fullness and flavor of it. The complimentary chips and salsa was decent, but thumbs down for extra charge after the first batch of chips.

2012-04-06,3.0,"Very hard to decide how to rate this place.  It's one of those places where my reviews are mixed. Service: So they made quite a few mistakes in service, in my opinion.  But somehow they always redeemed themselves at the end of the day, so I'm not really dinging them for service.  For example, I called ahead and was told I'm added to a waiting list.  The wait was supposed to be 35 minutes.  We arrived after 30 and I was told that the wait is 20 minutes.  I was like... OK, then why did I call ahead?  The guys asked me, well what did I tell you on the phone?  I'm like, you told me 35 minutes and that was 30 minutes ago.  He kind of denied it.  Then all of a sudden he felt like being kind again and sort of seated us at a temporary table and said we could move as soon as a bigger table is available.  Very nice of him in the end.  We ordered with one waiter, and then another waiter came and asked if we had questions about the menu.  Both guys look very similar, they must be brothers. :-)  So it was confusing for a second, but then I realized that there were 2 separate guys.  Anyways, he apologized and moved on.  When serving our enchiladas, they brought them out with verde (green) sauce when we clearly ordered ranchera (red) sauce.  Upon pointing that out, he immediately volunteered to get that fixed.  One big positive at the end... for no apparent reason, they brought us a free tres leche dessert.  It was delicious.  I gotta say, if they hadn't done that, I think I would've had to think real hard to go one star lower on the rating.  As it stands right now I'm going to be very understanding and not ding them on service at all.  Throughout, I have to say that the waiter was very nice.  Always smiling and following up with us, so I'm gonna say good service, despite a few execution mistakes.  Hey, I'm easy. Food: So if it's not service, then why only 3 stars?  Most people on yelp have given them 4 or 5.  Well, I think the food was hit or miss.  The chips and salsa were really good.  They actually bring out two salsa; the red one was much better than the green, imho.  Then I tried the tostadas, and they were quite good.  I think it was the black beans.  They were really flavorful.  Also corn and other toppings were a nice touch.  Then the enchiladas.  So they brought out a second set of them with ranchera sauce instead of verde sauce and they were just OK.  I think the sauce was kind of weak.  The cheese wasn't that great, either.  Kind of on the drier side.  Now, I don't know if they didn't turn out as well, since they pretty much rushed to put them together due to the wrong sauce mistake the first time around, or not, but bottomline they were very average.  The the complimentary tres leche cake.  It was excellent.  But food overall, average, I think. It is a BYOB, so that's really cool.  Definitely a plus.  That's about it... overall a mixed experience.",0.9963,0.782,0.158,0.06,0.4960338879870129

I snapped off and had them throw all 3 options of Chorizo, Mushrooms, and poblano. Can't go wrong on this item. We also had their Chicken Flautas which were a bit of a let down. Kinda pedestrian and nothing special going on.  For dinner, I had the Camarones Rellenos (stuffed shrimp). Great dish. My cousins got the specials that night. One was not worth raving about, the other was a pork rib dish that was fantastic. Spicy and bold sauce with a great slow cooked shank that was worth having them keep on the menu.

La Ciudad truly goes above and beyond any restaurant I have been to in the city thus far. I have been here about ten times in the past three months and the service has been outstanding every time. The owners always ensure that your dining experience is nothing but the best. Before you even eat any food, you know the restaurant is good because the menu is small and its simplicity speaks for itself. It is carefully crafted with some of Mexico's best dishes. The food tastes extremely fresh and the chefs always add a little twist to some of the traditional dishes which undoubtlley makes this place stand out abouve the other Mexican restaurants. La Ciudad definately creates a contemporary spin on some of Mexico's finest dishes. For the salad eaters, I would choose the Mango Avacado salad with chicken. It is my girlfriends favorite dish. It is light and sweet and the mango dressing assaults your pallet with awesome flavors. My personal favorite is the Angels Combo. It includes a nice slice of awesome marinated steak and Chilled Reno that is out of this world. We always start with a small cup of tortilla soup and some empanadas as well. The vibe that the atmosphere creates, perfectly compliments the food. They usually have popular Mexican songs playing but I went in once when they were playing house music and I thought that was awesome and unique. If you are in a good mood and want Mexican food made with the healthiest and freshest ingrediants, then you have to come here. The dining experience as a whole is great. I didn't think you could get this kind of food for such a low price. This is Uptown's hidden gem and a must try for any foodie.   P.S. if you feel like being adventurous, try the Tacos Al Pastor it is the best that I have had in the States.",0.9967,0.721,0.227,0.052,0.5813953488372092

Can't remember. We had really great service, however.  The place is BYOB, so if you bring in your own margarita mix and tequila, they'll mix it in back for you and bring out fresh glasses as soon as you start to get low.  They were also very patient with us, since we were taking our sweet time ordering appetizers and our meals.   If I lived near here, I would probably come back...but unfortunately there are places closer to me (Los Nopales) that I'd go to first.",0.944,0.853,0.114,0.033,0.4696078431372549

I ate here last night with my sister and the location was perfect for us -- she coming from river north and me from evanston -- it was just about half way.  We both drove past it a number of times because it doesnt exactly pop out from the street, and its sandwiched between a number of other shops, but when we found it it was great.  We sat outside in a fenced in patio (fence = ideal because otherwise you'd be eating in the parking lot) and the waiter was extremely friendly.  We had the guacamole and falutas to start (both were amazing, the later shouldnt be missed) and then split the chicken quesadilla for our entree. The chicken quesadilla was one of the best ive ever had -- its like slow cooked, tender chicken in small bits (think texture of pulled pork) in a corn shell with lots of cheese.  Unreal.  The waiter even brought us a free dessert of tres leches cake on the house -- so nice!

Their menu- I haven't had anything that was just not simply great and FRESH.  I am vegetarian but on occasion, I eat seafood. There is NOTHING like their ceviche dish. I crave it everyday. A must try. The owner makes us a fresh mango smoothie or gives us a free dessert ""on the house"" just to show his appreciation that we always come back!   And lemme tell you- the owner's smile lights up the whole city; he's got this happy-go-lucky energy that makes you feel like you're the most important person in the world.  It's just not only about the food. The food must be quality, but the energy of a place has to make you feel just as good too.  The dine-out experience just does not get any better; La Ciudad goes that extra mile.   Granted the area is not the most attractive. But inside this restaurant it's a whole different world and very quickly you forget you're on Sheridan & sunnyside. The candle glow against the rich red walls makes for a perfect ambiance at night.

2011-09-13,2.0,"Man.. a let down in my eyes. Typically highly rated yelp supported restaurants rarely fail. I had a less than stellar evening at La Ciudad.  La Ciudad means ""the city"", and they really picked an awesome spot to be located. It's hood. I live walking distance, and still decided to drive. It's nestled in a small strip mall between a dollar store, and a laundry mat if I recall corruptly.  Was able to get seated quickly on a saturday night without reservations which was fantastic. The bus boys really work their tails off. They were very aware, and running around with bread and water. There is a huge language barrier with bus staff.  My server was slow to get to our table. Really slow. maybe 20 minutes before she came to us (at this point we were ready to order). I hate that.  Salsa verde was great! Fresh, spicy and delicious.(this was the highlight of the meal) Shrimp and tilapia ceviche was first out. It was overkill on the lime. Really sour. None the less, ate it all.  Bacon wrapped shrimp were just par. Shrimp were big, but a little overcooked. Also had chicken flautas in mole sauce. This was my first time trying mole, and i hated it. Many people said that this was the best mole they had, so I'm hoping I'm cut out for the lesser quality mole? It was extremely bitter past the point I could tolerate.   Service was the nail in the coffin. Stared at our messy but obviously finished plates for an additional 10 minutes. Then played the muddled 3rd grade spanish game with a bus boy to get our waitresses attention. Throughout the meal, we did see our waitress once to ask how the food was or if we needed anything else.  The potential in the food is there, and I'm confident that I simply ordered things that were not to my taste.

I can honestly say I've never had a bad meal at La Cuidad - been there for breakfast, lunch and dinner and it's always top notch.

The Food we had: LAMB RIB-LETS in MOLE SAUCE (Special) - 3 lamb rib-lets in an excellent chocolate mole sauce that is complex and sweet. Rib-lets were cooked perfectly. (about $19) DEVIL'S SHRIMP - 6 Jumbo shrimp were just tasty with not too much heat (in my opinion). Delicious. ($14.95) FLANTASTICO - Must Try! Awesome. Just melts in your mouth and makes it dance!  Definite Highlight of the meal. ($7) TRES LECHES CAKE - Moist and scrumptious! Tried two and both were gone in seconds!

I'm not sure if that is intended (I had the audacity to think the queso was potentially authentic), but it didn't kick off the meal well in my book. My girlfriend got the carne asada which was delicious. I got the enchiladas. The food was an A-. Best thing they did all night? Free desert. We took a quick look at the desert menu, decided to hop on the red line to Tarantino's on Armitage, but before we could grab the check and a pretty looking desert was on our table.

2011-08-08,5.0,"I have absolutely no qualms giving La Ciudad a big, luscious, five sexy stars.  My party was treated like royalty from the moment we stepped on the premises to the very end of our lavish, delicious meal.  Truly, a stellar dining experience. Let me set the scene: It's about 9pm on a Friday night.  My beach volleyball team had just played an intense two hour session at Montrose Beach.  We were hungry.  We were sweaty.  We were ready to kick off the weekend right with a dinner amongst good friends.  Team Paddywhack cleaned ourselves up a bit, dusted off the sand and headed over to La Ciudad. We arrived to see a full restaurant and a packed patio.  Undeterred, my posse of six hung back, cracked open a few of the beers we'd toted along (La Ciudad is BYOB) and decided to wait it out. Because a few of my co-diners are serious regulars, the crew at La Ciudad stepped up to the plate to get us sat as quickly as possible.  In La Ciudad terms, that means setting up a table for us outside the designated outdoor dining area.  The regular patio at La Ciudad is nothing fancy; just a fenced in area of the parking lot since the restaurant resides in strip mall.  Our table was set up just outside the fenced in patio... right on the sidewalk of the parking lot in front of the Chinese restaurant that looks like it serves as a front for a drug operation.  Classy?  No.  Hilarious?  Yes.  Did we gladly sit there? You bet!  The best part was that since we were outside the restaurant, we could smoke at our table.  Double bonus! I went with the chicken burrito smothered in a deep, dark mole sauce.  Winner, for sure.  The burrito was so big it took up the entire plate, so even the largest of appetites could probably only take down  1/2 of that bad boy.  The chicken was moist and flavorful and the mole sauce was outstanding. While I could probably talk for hours about how good the food is at La Ciudad, what really made the trip was our fantastic, above and beyond service.  Our beers were replenished at lightening speed.  Our desserts were served on a lovely platter that had ""Happy Lollapalooza"" spelled out in raspberry sauce since one of our diners had been raving about The Palooza that night.  We were catered to, gushed upon and given the highest level of service I can remember receiving at a restaurant.   I absolutely LOVE La Ciudad.  Its my new go-to for Mexican food.",0.9969,0.805,0.171,0.024,0.5169585044585046

I made plans with friends to come here before I knew it was part of ""Yelp Eats"" week, but that gave us the added benefit of a special treat-a paired down menu and special prices. While we did peruse the full regular menu, we all took advantage of the three-course Yelp menu. And the lineup was: Ceviche - beautifully presented on bright orange chips and bursting with citrus and cilantro flavors Tortilla soup - reported as delicious though I did not try it Sopas - again, great presentation and titillating to the taste buds Combo of Chile Relleno and carne asada - perfect portions without the large ""gobs"" of cheese, and nicely garnished with grilled scallions. Three of the four of us ordered this and we were delighted. Flavor, flavor, flavor.  Lamb Chops with mole - while not a huge mole fan, I did like the lightness and subtlety of theirs. The lamb was delicious, too. Tres Leches cake, and another two-layer flan/chocolate cake offering. These were reasonable portions and some of the best pastry I've had in awhile. Artistically executed, too. I  cannot say enough about the genuinely warm and personal service, from all staff, but especially from Hugo, our server. If there is any place I'd like to place on a weekly visit list, it's La Ciudad. Unforgettable, casually upscale and seductive is how I would rate it.",0.9972,0.747,0.237,0.016,0.6445558714789483

2011-07-17,3.0,"This place is better than it has any right to be. It's tucked away in an unassuming strip mall next to a dollar store. If not for the fenced-in patio, we could easily have missed it. Speaking of the patio, while I'm sure it's nice, I prefer not to eat in a parking lot. Once you get inside, though, it's cute as can be. Vibrant red walls with white banquettes and framed B&W photographs. Immediately you're transported into an entirely new environment. A word of warning: those banquettes aren't padded, they're just painted, so watch your tailbone! The food is good. We went for Yelp eats, and ordered primarily from that menu. The sopes appetizer was small -- it is an appetizer, after all -- but tasty. The little masa bowl was light and pillowy, and the meat was well seasoned. The ceviche was good. It's served on individual chips, which is cute, but the chips soak through pretty quickly. For entrees, we ordered the lamb chops, from the special menu, and the pork chops from the regular menu. Both were nicely cooked. I liked the mole sauce which came with the lamb much better than the tomatillo sauce that was served with the pork. It seemed a bit bland. The portions were a good size, so we split the flantastico for dessert. It was delicious. The cake was very moist -- almost like a tres leches -- and the flan provided a nice contrast. Our serving was about half the size of the slices shown in the photos here on Yelp. It was fine -- we didn't need a huge dessert -- but I'm hoping they weren't serving a half portion for Yelp Eats. The service was terrific. Everyone was very friendly, and out server was enthusiastic. My only complaint was that people kept trying to take my plates before I was finished. First, I'm a tubby guy, so expect that I'm going to clean my plate! But second, just because people are talking, that doesn't necessarily mean that they're done eating. it could mean that they're enjoying themselves. I went back and forth on my star rating for La Ciudad. We had a good time, and I'll definitely be back. There are other menu items I'd like to try, and the experience was  good one.

We had a Yelp coupon for La Ciudad, and I was seriously craving some delicious Mexican food, so we made a res for Friday night and off we went.  Weather was spectacularly shitty. It was 80 degrees earlier in the day, and then it dropped to about 40 degrees. Weather Gods, suck my peen. Anyway. La Ciudad built a cute little patio in the front of the restaurant! I'm sure it will get some use this summer. We brought some beer, so we cracked one open post haste and they tossed the rest in the cooler. Excellent.  Empanadas were one of the special apps (they came in steak and veggie) so each of us got an empanada and we got an app size order of guac. My only issue with the guac is that there were extremely large pieces of avocado....I would have mashed it up a little more. Otherwise? Flavors were good. The veggie empanada was stuffed with mushrooms and cheese, and it had a crispy outside with a ooey-gooey inside. The salsas that came with them were smokey and hot. Mmmmm. For a main course I ordered the chile rellenos (again....I'm a creature of habit) and as expected they were delicious. They were smothered in a ranchero sauce and stuffed with chihuahua cheese. The sides of beans and rice were also delicious. I ordered my guac with my entree, because I am a glutton. Everything was great. For dessert, we got the FLANtastico (a chocolate cake with flan on top) and a lava cake. Both were very good, the Flantastico was quite rich, but nice in small doses.  Yay for La Ciudad!

Lots of fresh ingredients and all the different flavors worked well together. It was huge too and I took half of it home for lunch the next day. We ordered the guac as an appetizer it was hands down some of the best I have ever tasted. We cleaned that plate real good! Since this spot is BYOB, the price for 1 app and 4 entrees was $50.

By the time I finished grazing (you don't get a gut like mine by working out and eating salad) and was ready for the bill, the server brought it out, I gave him the printed-out Deal, he went to the back, subtracted the difference, brought the new bill back out, asked for my e-mail address for follow-up, and told us to have a good night. The whole experience was very easy-peasy. I announced my intention to use the Deal at the beginning of the meal. I wasn't asked to order from a different menu. I didn't receive sub-par service.

2011-03-03,2.0,"After seeing the great reviews, I decided to hold my birthday dinner here even though I had never been before. I should have tried it out first. Arrived a little early and they had the table set and held, so props for that. But that was the highlight. The server opened the bottles of wine of the others, but I had to ask to have my champagne opened after a while. Even if I wasn't the girl with the tiara on her head you think he would have offered sooner.  We started with the queso fundido, which I think had been sitting for a little bit because it wasn't that melty. It was okay (who doesn't love cheese, after all), but I have had better elsewhere. For my main course I had two veggie empanadas along with a side of rice and beans. Everything was lukewarm and kind of bland. I just was not impressed.  The tres leches cake they brought me with a candle was presented beautifully and was very good, that was the best part of the dinner.  There was one snafu--when we got the bill, I noticed they had charged us for chips and salsa, which was supposed to be gratis. It wasn't the amount but the principle, so when I asked the server, he said it was because we had had seconds. But despite his saying we had said we wanted more, no one on the other end had been asked, and I know for sure I had not at my end.  He kindly took them off the bill after some protestation by me, but I should not have had to do that, it was awkward (I swear we were never asked if we wanted more, they were just brought. We wouldn't have had them--we didn't even need them at that point at the meal). Also, please note there is a $3 per bottle corkage fee. Oh well.

2011-02-28,3.0,"I came here for a friend's birthday dinner on Saturday.  When the cab driver stopped and said we were there I thought there had to be a mistake.  Not because the neighborhood is ""dangerous"" or ""seedy"" - the restaurant is just very out of place in this little strip mall and its sign is pretty easy to miss.  Assured that yes, this WAS the place, I headed in. La Ciudad was bustling but our reserved table was waiting for us.  Our waiter quickly brought out the glasses and opened our BYOB wine.  La Ciudad was also very understanding about the fact that we had a few late cancellations and were taking up seats that could have been released for other patrons (people, seriously, when someone asks you to confirm your RSVP, do it.) I ordered the carne asada and chile relleno plate and the table ordered queso fundido to start.  The queso fundido was okay - nothing special, but how can you go wrong with melted cheese?  My entree was very good, but it came out decidedly lukewarm (I suspect the preparation of my entree was complete before others at the table and they let mine sit before serving).  To be fair, I didn't complain and it wasn't enough to ruin the food for me, but it was a bit annoying. What was even more annoying was the bill we received at the end of the meal.  We'd been under the impression La Ciudad had no corkage fee, but we were charged $3 per bottle of wine.  Not a big deal and we may have been in error, but FYI.  We were also charged for refills on chips and salsa that were brought to the table.  We weren't asked if we wanted these and they were taken off the bill after we complained.  Finally, we a piece of cake was brought out for the birthday girl and we were charged for it.  Again, not the end of the world, but this all added up to a rather sour note to end the meal.  We felt we were being nickled and dimed and it had a definite negative effect on my impression of La Ciudad.",-0.9026,0.804,0.084,0.112,0.5639417989417989

We drank, we ate...the bill arrived and no one freaked out. Hurrah! Comfortable, stylish red booths and modern interior, low lights, buzzing patrons, BYOB and exceptional service. Truly exceptional on a busy Friday night when everyone wants to eat NOW, they all load up their own booze, etc. It was without a doubt, flawless.  The food? Pretty darn swell...as anticpated. My taco dinner was a tad bland, but other dishes really stood out like garlic shrimp, guac, burrito dinner, flautas and tostada dinner. The Tres Leches cake ($5!?) was absolutely fantastic, and not a bite was left. Many ""ooooohs"" emitted from the table around, even from those swearing they simply did not have room for dessert.

Want fish instead of chicken on the mango salad. You're gold. I'm certainly not trying to advocate annoying them with a million special requests - don't do that -  but it is nice to know that they're reasonable and genuinely want you to have a great meal.   You get free chips with two types of salsa. The green is fantastic with big chunks of roasted tomatillo in it. Yum!  Here's a list of everything I can vouch for: Mushroom Queso Fundito - naughtily delicious Veggie and beef empanada - veggie preferred but both good Mango and avocado salad - very generous with avocado! Loved it! Chilango burger - a silly dish that everyone loved. Fries are really good. Chicken enchiladas - Green sauce! The mole was a little too sweet for me. Pastor taco - I don't usually like pork, but this was awesome! Beef Sopes - I would romance and marry these if it was legal in IL Tortilla soup - the best I've ever had anywhere. Absolutely fantastic! Finally, a very special shout out to the Huevos Rancheros which was everyone's favorite dish so far. The ranchero sauce is nice and bright and somehow, with some mysterious voodoo, the fried corn tortillas stayed crispy and delicious until the end despite being smothered in sauce.

2011-01-03,3.0,"I grew up in a small Arizona border town. Authentic Mexican ""street tacos"" were a short 15 minute drive away. On this side of the border, tacos of the same quality were easily obtainable. Now, I'm well over 1500 miles from the place that has the food I so loved. Moved to Chicago from AZ 6 months ago. As such, I've been in search of the perfect ""taco"" ever since. I was excited to see La Ciudad on Yelp: right in my 'hood, and great ratings, to boot.  All in all, I wasn't terribly impressed with the tacos.  _______ Getting down to brass tacks... Complimentary chips and salsa: A-OK chips, but a bit too much salt (whatever, really--brush it off the chip). Salsa was fantastico! Great, fresh salsa rojo and some sort of smoky chipotle-esque green stuff. Was the closest to authentic I've seen here yet! Appetizer: The appetizer sampler for two, consisting of chicken flautas and carne asada sopes.  The sopes were *delicious*--juicy carne and a wonderfully conflicting soft/crunchy to the pillowy sope bread. The flautas weren't so great--the chicken was quite dry. No juice to speak of. The pico de gallo on the plate was good and fresh, too. Bonus points for that. Dinner: Three taco combination plate with rice and refried beans. Beans: just okay. Not great, but not horrible. They held their own as beans. Rice: not bad at all. Not too sticky or wet. Had peas and carrots in it, which is common to some Mexican rice dishes.   ********THE TACOS************* (I had three carne asada tacos, my wife had 3 pastor tacos.) Pastor: Nowhere NEAR authentic. Very much over-marinated in some strange, heavily tomato-based sauce, reminiscent of BBQ. Over abundantly dressed in grilled onions. Tasty in its own (albeit strange) right, but not at all what we had in mind. Tasted as though it was the intent of the establishment to add something decidedly ""upscale"" to the value of the humble pastor street taco.  3 out of 5 stars. Carne Asada: Great disappointment. HELLA salty. I second the person whose observation found a lack of any sort of pleasant marinade outside of salt and pepper. I combated this with a healthy heaping of salsa and lots of lime juice. The meat was quite nice, however. Good quality, and far less gristly than some other places' carne tacos. Still, I give them only a 2 out of 5.  ________ Not bad, but not as great as some seem to think. I might give them another try, if nothing else than for one of their specials (I passed on the marinated lamb chops the first time).  Overall, a great atmospheric take on Mexican food, but I must insist that the food not mimic the more ""upscale"" setting.

First, the food was outstanding. They bring you a roasted tomato (red) and a tomatillo (green) salsa with great chips. The salsas were amazing - not too spicy for me (a good thing), but very flavorful. Then we had the chili rellenos appetizer, which was also amazing. At this point, I was convinced that we would become regulars here. For dinner, we had the mole chicken - this was the best cooked and best tasting chicken I have had. The meat was perfectly done, so moist, and just falling off the bone. The mole sauce was delightful, and the rice on the side (a humongous portion!) was very delicious too (had potatoes, corn and other veggies in it). My husband had the Angel platter, which had a chili rellenos, carne asada. The chili was out of this world good. The steak was okay, a little on the chewy side, which is typical for skirt steak. In their defense, he asked for it rare, and even though this was a very thin piece of meat, they succeeded at making it perfectly rare.  The portions were enormous - we took home half of the mole chicken and rice - and the prices were super reasonable. Some places try to fool you - when the portions are big, they're trying to make up for bad food, but that wasn't true here. The food was fantastic! We were served by two super cute waiters who were very nice, had good recommendations to make for our meals, kept our chips, salsa, and water full all the time, and were just exceedingly pleasant. We probably wouldn't have the carne asada again, but the mole was absolutely the best! The decor inside was clean, simple, and really classy. This place as adorable ambiance, nice mariachi music (not too loud), and a few fun holiday decorations as well. Next time I want to try their salmon entree (which the guys sitting next to us recommended highly....this wasn't their first time here) and some deserts (they looked fabulous).

First the waiter was so sweet he asked right away if we wanted a bottle opened and they brought us water.  Yes its BYOB-awesome!  They were very helpful with ordering apps and entrees.  Honestly everything we had was great.  I would highly reccomend getting Ceviche, Guacamole, Chicken Burrito.   We even had some dinner entertainment with some sort of a bust happening right outside on the streed.  Now come on where can you get all of this in one place?",0.9933,0.708,0.26,0.032,0.6275500345065563
2010-10-03,5.0,"Amidst Uptown's chaos sits La Ciudad.  The name doesn't refer to Chicago but THE city of the world in population, Meso-American history/culture, and peligro: El Distrito Federal de Mexico (Mexico City).  I stepped in here on a hot summer day to only a humungous fan being the only thing keeping us from peeling over dead.  With the haphazard noises outside and bums a walkin' in front of this strip mall storefront, I truly felt like I was in La Ciudad.  The open arms of the owner and aromas coming out of the kitchen was what kept me alive and not frightened.   First off, it's BYOB so bring that chilled bottle of white, or bold, dark red wine.  We started off with the ceviche with shrimp and tilapia soaked in fresh, acidic lime juice with plenty of serving chips to dig in.  It was refreshing and ceviche without the fishy ""Chicken of the Sea"" taste.  As for an entree, I couldn't let myself get anything other than the POLLO EN MOLE and thankfully I didn't get detoured from choosing another menu item.  The boney chicken was full of shreddable moisture and all flavors of the complex spices that goes in to mole.  It was extremely savory and not too spicy or sweet.  That's my biggest recommendation. The owner said we must get dessert--those darn Latinos never want you to leave their place unsatisfied or with a bit of empty stomach space.  He recommended the MOCHA FLAN and offered to buy it if we disliked it.  Usually I eat anything in front of me, however, flan is written in dark ink to avoid at all costs: sluggish consistency, ugly look running with juices, gelatin touch, and blah taste.  I take back everything negative I've said!!  This mocha flan was flavorful, more mousse-like instead of gelatin, and a perfect ending to our Mexican meal.  With this in mind, I still probably won't eat flan anywhere other than at La Ciudad fearing that it will not be near as good.

The place was small and every table was full... very high energy, but beautifully lit, and the smells coming from the open kitchen were incredible. Our waiter was this enigmatic man who made fantastic suggestions and he really truly made us feel welcome, like we were regulars. BYOB is always a bonus too. This place feels like a secret that all the foodies and smarties are in on. Yes, it's in a totally dicey neighborhood, but you can park right in the lot out front. The food here is incredible- everything I've tried from the shrimp wrapped in bacon and stuffed with cheese to the enchiladas en mole have been sublime. Our waiter assured me that they have a unique and wondrous flan and although as I told him, we're not flan fans (something about that jiggly, slightly sweaty texture is such a turn off) we agreed to try it. I'm generally not one for desserts in Latin cuisine so I was pleasantly shocked when my gorgeous mocha flan arrived looking like a heavenly slice of cheesecake. OMG. I don't know and I don't WANT to know how the chef does it, but LaCiudad flan is like a cross between cheesecake, creme brulee, and mousse. I've taken many friends here and they've all had the same opinion - no one I know every orders flan anywhere but this place. I actually ended up here on my birthday this summer and one of my friends covertly told our waiter that it was my birthday... well I had the first ever birthday flan, complete with candle, presented by every single employee singing and smiling and really making me feel like I was a part of THEIR family. This gringa was *touched*. Their tres leches cake is also in a league of its own....

2010-06-27,3.0,"My friend did a lot of research for a good BYOB place close to where we live, so he was naturally stoked when he came across the fantastic reviews for La Ciudad.  Sadly, we felt a little disappointed, but, lets start with the positive. Inside, the restaurant is chic.  I really enjoyed the red walls with the modern furniture and black and white photos of spain- that was great.  It was a good place for a dinner for 2 or 3, but I wouldn't invite anymore than 4 people because it would get a little cramped.  So the atmosphere is pretty decent.  The waiters were really nice and very attentive, which being a small place they should be, but I really did feel taken care of and my water glass was never empty, not even half empty.  So the staff was great.  The BYOB part was my next favorite feature about the restaurant.  I love a good BYOB place, but the food needs to satisfy me as well.... The atmosphere and BYOB were the best part about my experience. Sadly the review goes down from here.  Pulling up to the restaurant, it's not just sketchy, it's a little ghetto.  Honestly, I would never drive by and think,  ""Oh hey, that looks like a cool restaurant inside the strip-mall.""  The balloon arch outside doesn't attract customers, if I wasn't told it was awesome, I would keep driving/walking by. The food was not anything special.  I already have low expectations when eating and Mexican restaurants because it takes a lot for a taco to impress me- and this didn't impress me.  We ordered guac, which was pretty decent.  I ordered quesadilla, which again, was nothing special.  My friend ordered a vegetarian burrito and my other friend ordered chicken tacos- again which were just O.K.    We ordered vanilla ice cream and pistachios for dessert, which was just that- nothing that wow'd me.   This place was just O.K.  Will I go back?  Probably not.  I may consider it if they get another location, but that's a BIG if.  Sorry to go against the mainstream here, but meh, wasn't impressed at all.",0.9982,0.685,0.253,0.062,0.5703045864810572
2010-06-27,3.0,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! I think the BYOB got to everybody's heads a little bit! As an Uptown resident, it was great to see a new restaurant open up down the street to glowing reviews. 4.5 stars on here? I had to stop by and SOON! I rallied up two friends, grabbed some cheap wine, and stopped in at La Ciudad on Friday night. I don't think sketchy strip mall even begins to describe where La Ciudad is hidden in. When I pulled in with my friend, I immediately had to reassure him that I wasn't taking him out on a drug run. We parked and met my other friend inside. Despite the exterior, the inside of the restaurant is modern, slick, and pretty chic. I loved the deep red walls bouncing off the porcelain booths, chairs, and tables. Cool! For food, we started with the chips and guacamole. Not bad...but definitely not my favorite I've had before. I prefer my guacamole to be fully smashed without chunks of avocado still in it. The red salsa was just OK, too, but I really enjoyed the verde sauce that was brought out with the chips. For dinner, I went ahead with a black bean burrito, and my friends went with cheese quesedillas and chicken tortas. My burrito was very plain. It didn't have a kick or spice to it that really made it exciting. I ate the whole thing, knowing that I had a night of drinking debauchery ahead, but I could take it or leave it next time. Very dry. The quesedillas were sort of disappointing as well. I love corn quesedillas, most people don't, and these were corn. Despite the tortilla, the cheese felt a little dry, too. Maybe the cooking was just having an off day but usually I devour quesedillas and I didn't want to go back for another piece. I didn't have the chicken tortas, but my friend said they were good. We capped the dinner off with their vanilla ice cream with pistachios, tasty! Overall, I just didn't get caught up in the hype. The BYOB is amazing and kept the check low which is always refreshing on a Friday night. I would probably go back, but I won't rush over next time. If you are going for a night out though, make sure you stock up on your favorite beverage because I don't think the food will knock you out.",0.9921,0.815,0.143,0.042,0.5100744457562639

2010-04-20,5.0,"I have the privilege of living right across the street (practically) and I can go whenever I want!  My roommate and I went last Saturday evening, right before the dinner rush and were absolutely ASTONISHED! We ordered the trio appetizer which had sopes, guac, and taquitos.  All were really tasty and the sopes were home made and impressively tasty.  Also, being the skeptic that I am, I ordered horchata (which I learned they make from scratch - not a mix) and it came with a stick of canela... I had to stop myself from chugging it, it was so good! Then, again, being a true skeptic, I decided to really give this place a test and I ordered the pollo en mole.  Not only was the chicken done perfectly, the mole was the best I have ever had!  Nuevo Leon, y'all need to catch up to La Ciudad when it comes to mole.  To finish, our waiter brought us complimentary raspberry sorbet, which was a perfect way to cleanse our pallets. That reminds me, our server was one of the most delightful and authentically pleasant people I have ever had serve me.  I used to manage a restaurant, and I know contrived when I see it, and contrived this gentleman was not.  My roommate and I have been raving about this place ever since and plan on going back many, many, many times.  I suggest that, if you plan to go anytime around dinner, that you call and make a reservation.  The dining room is very intimate and fills up quickly.  Also, wear a nice shirt and look presentable, otherwise you'll feel like a schlep if you're dressed in a hoodie and shoes with holes in them like I was.",0.9919,0.817,0.163,0.02,0.6364726631393298

Portion sizes are pretty hearty too, so you might want to share with a friend.  I had their chicken tacos. And I almost ate the whole thing. The marinated chicken was a bit on the salty side, but was balanced out by the rest of the plate. I loved the Spanish rice as well. Service was very good.

They've absolutely hit the mark on bringing tasty Mexican bites, genial service and the bounty of BYOB together in a sleek package that manages to scream 'neighborhood hottie meets fashionable city maven', all while residing in a slightly hideous strip mall. Kudos!  Lucky me to stumble upon La Ciudad's reviews just prior to planning a casual bday group dinner for 16 hungry dining out junkies. A definite change of pace for our group, but undeniably a marvelous one! The La Ciudad boys handled our challenging chow crew with simplicity, grace and utter hospitality... we were attended to with quick, efficient service and nonstop smiles. Love it. In addition to great attitudes, which obviously count for a lot, even better was the swift margarita attention. As a BYOB establishment (score!) that means you're free to bring your own tequila, mixers, beer, you name it. La Ciudad is quick on the uptake, however, and uses this as just another opportunity to serve you well by keeping you plied with salted rim glasses, refills on ice and pitchers aplenty. Perfection embodied.  Nibbles are equally lovely in 'the city'. Think amazing tilapia and shrimp ceviche marinated to a tangy goodness, crispy steak flautas kissed with sour cream, zippy chorizo tacos and bacon wrapped shrimp stuffed with cheese then fried to a crispy deliciousness. Olé!  Also not to be missed is the totally terrific Carne Tampiqueña - a mouthwatering marinated skirt steak (medium rare, please) served with a rich molé enchilada, spiced rice and frijoles negras.

After reading the reviews I really should have made a reservation, but decided to show up and hope for the best. With pre-mixed margaritas in tow, I was greeted by the host who was trying to figure out if he could seat 3, but couldn't because of reservations. Not a problem. I cozied up to the host stand and waited patiently.  I was offered water by two different people. When my girl friends showed up, they gave us ceviche on the house. Which was absolutely delicious. Super fresh. Once we were seated, we were given three salt rimmed glasses with limes and they poured the margaritas into a pitcher with ice. My glass was never empty as they came by and refilled constantly. The guacamole was good. Not the best I've ever had, but the chips were super light and crispy and I liked the slight tinge of spicy that would hit you later.  The al pastor tacos are definitely worth trying. Chile rellenos and tostadas were also given rave reviews by my friends. It's true, there are a lot of Mexican restaurants in the city serving up these same dishes.

Christopher had steak tacos. He said they were probably the best tacos he ever had. I had enchiladas picadillo with mole sauce. They were seriously good.

2010-03-10,4.0,"I was impressed by the reviews and here so I decided to go see for myself! La Ciudad has done a great job at turning a strip mall local into a chic little restaurant. It really makes great use of it's space and has great decorative touches. I assume the name alludes to the capital of Mexico, (el D.F.) by looking around...and shows off a modern, urban Mexico unlike most restaurants we're used to.  The service was warm, quick, and professional. A little stiff at times, but overall, very pleasant. We ordered quacamole, a parillada (a big plate of meat! as my companion exclaimed) and finally a flan. ~ chips and salsa: crunchy chips with a nice corn taste and amazing salsas you can tell are homemade. Each very unique and flavorful.  ~ quacamole: Very cold, and the edges were somewhat brown soon after. It is fairly dark in there, so it was hard to see how much. We ate it all anyways, but I was ok.  ~ parillada: a sturdy parillada. Good options, some chicken and beef, shrimp. The green onions that came with it was totally raw so I made a funny face when I bit into it, but my companion found it perfect. Our short ribs were downright bloody, which I found perfect. We both got totally stuffed on it.  ~ Alert- Flan snob! I'm sorry, I know some of you liked it but *shakes head* I couldn't finish it. Flan should be airy and fluffy, soft. This was thick and had a dense consistency. I mean, not terrible, but not great. It was mediocre flan. Only the very edges had that great flan texture that holds the flavor in it's little crevices. Hmm...tasty crevices. I do have to say know, they gave us a complimentary sherbet of some sort that was amazing. I wish I had gotten that, because it would have let the flan snob lay dormant and kept my little tummy happy.  Overall, I think it's a great change of place from the usual Mexican, but it's still genuine. I've gone to other places to try to be more authentic or chic, whatever, but they lack the heart and I end up really disliking them.

2010-03-08,5.0,"Simply excellent. I would dare a person to find something wrong with this wonderful addition to a city wrought with faux fine Mexican dining. While many trendy Mexican joints taste like someone set fire to a cilantro field, La Ciudad tastes like they love the food they make for you.  All three times I ate there in the last two weeks (yes, it's that good to eat there that often), I left the restaurant feeling like I was enriched by the experience. The staff was gracious each time, the food was fresh and delicious and the bill was low. Think of this as a spa, a spa where you eat authentic Mexico City cuisine. The first time I was there, I had a chorizo taco, Chuletas and guacamole. The freshness and cleanliness of the flavors showed through immediately.  Guacamole is a hit or miss dish. It's either a creamy, salty gift from the Gods. Or it's a slop-mess of forest brown and green goo, with a cilantro clusterfuck to hide any wrongdoing. La Ciudad's guac was excellently balanced between the avo, onion and spices.  The chorizo was charred just enough to give it that extra texture, but still had the sharp, pungent flavors one wants when ordering the sausage. Chorizo can permeate every other course it accompanies with its oils, but not so here. It was bright, vibrant and supported the other courses. Then came the climax: Chuletas grilled pork chop under a citrusy spicy tomatillo sauce, with a side of mashed potatoes covered in a peppery ranchero sauce. The pork had a slight chewiness that let the juices run through to come together with the skin's charred smoke flavor. While my friend and I tore into our main courses in silence, the tomatillo and ranchero sauces merged to make the silky potatoes even more bold. The next time I was there, I had the BEST torta I've ever had. Torta Ahogada, which had slow cooked pork, lettuce, tomato, jack cheese, avocado slices and is doused in ranchero. If you don't know the glory of a great torta, you are missing one of the world's finest foods. The pork was perfect again, spiced simply and cooked to tender melt-in-mouth glory. The bread was pillowy and fresh, and the sauce pulled it all together.  Hugo, one of the owners, talked with us the first time I was there for a while about how he's simply trying to make good food for people. He and his business partner opened last November, and they've gotten good feedback so far but they need more support. Then he brought us berry sorbet. These people truly care about their efforts here.  HELP US MAKE SURE THEY STAY IN BUSINESS AND GO HERE! If there's any part of you that likes Mexican food, get your ass to this place and enjoy yourself. Don't thank me, thank them.",0.9975,0.757,0.191,0.052,0.47906349206349214

Multiple meals started off with chips and salsa, so upon seeing some glowing CM reviews of this place, I phoned in and made reservations for that night.  Tiny restaurants located in places where you wouldn't expect to find stellar food are always a gem (um, La Gondola anybody?) and La Ciudad is no exception. A free parking lot doesn't hurt either. Chips, salsa, and guacamole were complimentary at the beginning of our meal. The salsas were good but the guacamole was too warm. Many tables brought in wine and beer as this place is BYOB but for those that don't drink, I highly recommend the Jamaica (a hibiscus iced tea) or the tamarindo jarrito (the best soda you will ever drink in your life).  My dinner consisted of the ceviche-ceviche. Tilapia and shrimp ceviche served over chips. Fresh, limey, delicious. I ate a whole plate by myself. The pork chop entree followed. At first I didn't know how I would manage all this food (chips, salsa, guacamole, ceviche, two pork chops AND mashed potatoes?) but my empty plates really attest to how delicious the pork chop dish was. Pounded thin and tasting so tender it was almost like veal! Served with mashed potatoes with some gravy that tasted like it was spicy bbq sauce spiked.  The staff was SO friendly. Everyone greeted us, our server was adorable, and they just seemed very happy that we were dining there.  The only downside is that it can get very loud of Friday nights. A 7 party birthday party of women + wine = a headache for Yanyao. Dessert orders to taken home to enjoy. However, the food was tasty and I am determined to come back here for a hopefully quieter lunch. The Chilango burger (topped with frankfurter, ham, and avocado) is calling my name.

2010-02-15,4.0,"I haven't spent much time in the Uptown area so I had a bit of a freakout when I got in my car and noticed my husband had taken my GPS. Fortunately, La Ciudad turned out to be easy as pie to find (even for the directionally challenged like myself) and bonus points for their free private parking lot! I opted out of drinking this time since it was the middle of the day, but I'll definitely be partaking in some BYOB action next time.  However, I enjoyed plenty of good eats: My party of 4 started off as the only table in the restaurant and they took very good care of us! Some chips and salsa to start (mmm...perfect for this chips addict), an order of incredible guac and uh-mazing ceviche (compliments of the chef).  After all that unhealthy deliciousness listed above I opted for the 7 layer salad as my entree. I was bummed to see it had more like 3 layers and wasn't very exciting, but once I added a few of my own layers (some chips and beans) it was pretty good! And probably way healthier than the burrito I originally had my eye on. We had flan for dessert. I'm usually not a flan fan, but this was really tasty! Oh, and I can't forget my necessary cup of coffee as well...a must to get thru the rest of the day. Apps, 4 entrees, flan and 2 coffees came to just about $50.  Quite the deal! I""ll be back soon for dinner...with a bottle (or two) of wine in my hands.",0.9894,0.779,0.173,0.048,0.5281547619047618
2010-02-12,4.0,"I was very happy with the food and prices here, but there were a few things that turned me off: 1. Location. Not only is it in the middle of a strip mall, but it is also in a pretty shady area. We took the #78 Montrose bus and got off at Sheridan. In our walk of only a couple blocks, we walked past a guy screaming obscenities to no one in particular, a group of 3 guys hiding in a doorway smoking something that wasn't cigarettes, and we also had a car full of thug-lifes roll by ever so slowly and give us the stinkeye. It was an eventful walk to say the least. 2. Seating. We went on a Friday night without reservations. We went pretty early (around 6:45) and got the last open table, although they did have a few larger tables that had ""reserved"" signs on them. Throughout the duration of our meal, small groups of 2-4 people came in, and the host/hostess said ""sorry we're full, it will be 30-45 minutes."" Even as we were waiting with credit cards out in anticipation of the check, they were still turning people away. Why turn someone away when there is going to be a table open in minutes? Maybe they were reserving it for someone with a reservation. Or how about breaking up some of those bigger tables (which are actually just a bunch of 2-person tables pushed together)? I was a little confused when I saw so many people disappointedly turned away. 3. The service wasn't terrible, but it was spotty. My water was always filled, but they didn't bring out my tortillas and I had to ask for them. It also took quite a while for them to bring out the check when we were clearly done eating. Also, my empty beer bottles were never taken off the table until after the meal. It was hard to figure out who the host was, who the waiter was, who the water person was, etc, as they all seemed to do everything. Now that the bad stuff is out of the way, here's the good stuff: 1. BYOB! 2. The food is for the most part excellent. The chips & salsa are spectacular, although the salsa comes in teeny tiny little bowls that will only cover about 10 chips. 3. Decor was nice, and the seating was comfortable (although if you can avoid it, don't sit in the table by the door, as you will get a very cold burst every time the door is opened).  All in all, although the ""bad"" stuff was annoying, I'm still saying this place is 4-star establishment, worthy of a visit from everyone. You might want to drive there though (and set your car alarm), as this area seems pretty shady at best.",0.9805,0.823,0.11,0.067,0.6181666666666668

Turn your car around and head to Uptown, where a new resto with a free parking lot awaits, the food is inexpensive and.... they're BYOB! I can't think of many things better than pre-batching your own margaritas and toting them along for the ride. It's a cheap date alternative... I am a fan! Our group of four sat down for a Friday lunch to an empty yet peppy red and white space. Within 15 minutes, the eatery was comfortably full. Yes, people are catching on, and quickly! We tried the tilapia and shrimp ceviche for our appetizer. This ceviche is super fresh with pretty (yes, I said pretty) chucks of avocado, cilantro and has a nice citrus bite without being overpowering like some ceviche. Being the burrito maven I am, that is exactly what I ordered for my main. The tortilla is grilled and perfectly flaky throughout (nice touch!) and the steak is seasoned with some sort of warm spice I couldn't identify. Cardamom? Cinnamon? And, the rest of the ingredients don't compete with the delicious steak... a touch of sour cream, a sprinkling of cheese. Well done, friends! We had the recommended flan for dessert. Wow... more dense and richer than most I've tried. Worth the sin and the subsequent trip to the gym. Service is light, friendly and professional... give this one a go, and soon!

The tortilla soup was not a broth, as expected, but a thick hearty soup full of flavor.  The chicken enchildas were filled with tender grilled chicken and a spicy ranchero sauce.  I liked at how each main course is served with your choice of black or refried beans.  The chile relleno was equally as delicious. It's great that it's BYOB, and our total bill with two soups, two main dishes and a dessert was $40.  Will definitely be back and it's great to have this place in the neighborhood.  Support it!",0.9869,0.829,0.171,0.0,0.5728260869565218

I highly recommend the bacon wrapped shrimp as an appetizer.  We actually ordered this for a party, and one plate was gone before Armando left our apartment!  I am also a big fan of the pork chops!  The green salsa is wonderful, but if you like a heartier flavor I prefer the mole!  OLE!",0.9734,0.733,0.267,0.0,0.5386274509803921

For appetizers, everything was excellent and you can't beat BYOB! The queso fundido was TO DIE FOR! The Guac is the best I've ever had. Great flavor and they keep the tortilla chips flowing=)  For the entree, I had enchiladas de Mole. The mole is really, really delish. I also tried my friend's Burrito w/ Ranchero sauce which was equally delicious.  I can't rave enough about the desserts. We had every single item on the list. Very gourmet and big portion sizes for your buck. The Mocha Flan has great flavor and I keep dreaming about the Mango Cheescake. YUMMMMM!  I love the decor and ambiance.

My experience was excellent, for the following reasons: (1) Due to personal oversight and misunderstanding, me and a friend both ordered dinners that had ground beef in it--as we were both vegetarians, this was slightly problematic. The waiter was very calm about it and immediately offered to bring us the same meal only veggie style. The vegetarian taco dinner was amazing--it was mostly a corn base with other vegetables and spices mixed in. So the taste started out on the sweeter side, but had a bit of a zing to it. The meal was also served with this rice that was out of this world amazing. (2) We followed up dinner with a dessert--the Mango Cheesecake. Incredible. That's all I can really say about it. (3) The restaurant itself and the staff all contributed to such a quaint, comfy kind of atmosphere. Note: It is BYOB, but there is a $3 corking fee, per bottle. Slightly irritating, but the rest of your experience will make up for it! I'll definitely be going back again soon!",0.8864,0.881,0.084,0.035,0.556439393939394

Good!  Then there was the lava cake I absolutely should not have had.  OMG! I can die now.  Awesome.  Comparable in quality, if not better than those at more expensive & fancier restaurants.  The decor was minimal, modern, and warm.  The service was great.  Hugo, my waiter was very friendly, attentive, and nice.  I will be going again...next time for dinner equipped with a bottle of margarita.  What a welcomed addition to the neighborhood!",0.9846,0.705,0.23,0.065,0.5731884057971015

I think my favorite thing was the shrimp in a little spicy sauce w/some corn and other additives in the middle of the plate. I'm not sure what the name was b/c we received the sample for free, but it's not the ceviche which we also had as an appetizer (that was good too, just more typical). Anyway, the food was superb, the staff war RIDICUOUSLY nice (as soon as an ince cube melted I pretty much had someone rushing over to refill my glass).  I also had the chile rellenos which were good and the mango cheesecake which was yummy (and not something I'm used to seeing on Mexican menus which usually cap desserts at flan).  This place is sort of a mix between the typical small Mexican food joint on the corner and a more urban, modern, small restaurant (the food also reflects both themes). Luckily, it's still affordable. Between the two of us, my husband and I agreed that the shrimp in the spicy sauce was the best, and the cheesecake was definitely worth a try.  I WOULD have taken some pics if my husband didn't complain about feeling uncomfortable about me clicking away.",0.9919,0.739,0.208,0.053,0.4832407407407408
