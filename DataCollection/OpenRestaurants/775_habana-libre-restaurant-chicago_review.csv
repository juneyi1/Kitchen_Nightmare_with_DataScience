I always thought it was just ok, but didn't know where else to go. The last time I went my mom asked me to get some carry out Pan con Bistec sandwiches for her. I paid $60 for 4 sandwiches rice& beans thinking it didn't seem right, but picked them up and paid anyway. When I got home I looked at the bill again, but it was not itemized so I thought to call and just see if I could just make certain I paid the right amount. Before calling I also pulled all the food out to see exactly what we got then I was really bugged by the tiny strip of meat on the sandwich... especially for that price! I called the restaurant to let the staff know what our sandwiches were like and to make sure I was charged the right amount. The woman who answered the phone, was condescending, calling me ""nena"", which in Spanish to us is kind of like referring to a child. I asked her if I could speak to her manager or the owner to talk to her about my experience and the woman said there was no manager or owner available. I asked if she could have someone call me back and she took my info. down. Literally a few minutes later, the same woman calls and the owner is in the background telling her what to tell me instead of speaking to me herself. She told her to tell me that they had someone new in the kitchen so it was likely we didn't get as much meat as we should have. She also insisted that the bill was correct even though the price breakdowns she was giving me weren't very clear and it seemed I was over charged or all the rice and bean sides. Anyway, she finally said that she would give me a free sandwich the next time I came in. I haven't been back and am not sure I will. The price was the first turn-off, then I was even more livid after I discovered the tiny strip of meat in all of our sandwiches. I have pictures that I will post after I get them off of my phone. The straw that broke the came's back for me was the patronizing woman that talked to me as if I were a child on the phone, then finally, the owner not calling me herself rather she was telling the woman what to tell me and I could hear the whole thing over the phone! I've never had an outstanding experience here, so I won't be back and I've discovered a new Cuban sandwich place that is friendlier and less expensive.

We should have gotten the hint by seeing that we were the only customers. The food was awful and it was so expensive! They try and trick you into ordering the most expensive meal and appetizer. That was a turn off. As a puertorrican, I was so dissapointed in the relleno de papa, the tostones, empanadas, and croqueta. They had no flavor and were were just awful! When my meal came out, I ordered the lechon (marinaded in onions and garlic). It had no flavor the the point where I had to return it. The lechon tasted old and like raw pork. It was so awful I could not swallow it. When I returned it and exchanged it for the small pieces of pork I was equally dissappointed. No flavor whatsoever. I ate two pieces and called it a night.

Growing up eating Cuban food on a daily basis, this pork wasn't marinated or season well by any means. It was overly salted beyond the taste of flavor. Along with the congri, the yuca tasted like it had just been reheated from early that day. I'm a huge fan of garlic, but this yuca almost burned my tongue with the amount of garlic.

We shared the sampler appetizer (pictured) and while the Empanadas and the things shaped like mozarella sticks (I forget what they are called) were pretty good, the other items on the platter were not good. The big round things were cold in the center.  We didn't finish eating all of it which is pretty rare for us when there is a plate of fried food sitting on the table.  For the main course, we ended up getting a shared dish recommended by the waitress that had three types of rice and three types of meat. The chicken was forgettable, the shrimp good (but nothing uniquely delicious that I couldn't easily replicate at home) and the roasted pork was dry. The rice was disapointing; it was dry and crumbly - not soft and sticky like it should be (there was white, red, and black rice). I've eaten a lot of rice, and there have been times where I was blown away by delicious rice. The main course was disapointing.  My sister ordered the flan, which was delicious; but it's flan, and hard to disappoint unless you screw it up roal-ly. The ambiance is nice and the employees are nice; it's a cuban restaurant so the service is a bit laissez faire - culturally, I can accept that. This is a popular and lively spot to celebrate a birthday. There were three other tables there celebrating birthdays. The staff puts a hat on the person and sings a fun birthday song that makes you want to get up and dance.  There is a slim chance that my rating is premature, because this is the first Cuban restaurant I have been to.

We ordered the ceviche to start - it was really very good, a healthy amount of shrimp in it too.  The downside I started to notice, which continued throughout the meal, was the plasticware they serve everything on.  At a place where the main courses are $14-$20 I expect to be served on plates that are not plastic. For the main course my wife ordered the mixed seafood dish with the cuban sauce and I ordered the filet of red snapper also with the cuban sauce.  When the entrees came out, my fish was on one plate and the rice and beans were on another plate.  One of my favorite things about cuban places are the huge plates with everything in a great presentation - what the heck Habana Libre?    Neither of us were impressed at all with the cuban sauce - the way they described it on the menu was that it would have lots of flavor and spice to it but it really tasted very bland and I wouldn't ever order any of their dishes with that sauce again.  It wasn't gross but it certainly wasn't worth the price.

2012-01-08,5.0,"It says something to give a restaurant all five starts but this place deserves it. I have a new favorite restaurant! Everything we ordered was not only delicious but unique. I had the pork and onion sandwich. The pork was tender, the onions were complimentary and not at all overwhelming. We also tried the fried yucca, which was very light and came with the most delicious minced garlic/oil dipping sauce. The garlic was strong but I love love love garlic so it was not a problem for me, nor was it too strong for anyone else at our table. The empanadas are not to be missed. We tried both the chicken and beef and were very pleased with both.  I am a coffee fiend, so I had to try some of the coffee variations they offered. I do not like my coffee sweet so I passed on the Cuban style coffee but two people at my table tried that and loved it. I had the Cortadito (coffee w/a splash of milk) and it was perfect. Nice and strong w/a slight bitterness that is cut by the milk. For dessert we ordered the days special of freshly baked Cuban pastries with guava and some sort of cream cheese filling. Like everything else, the pastry had perfectly balanced and complimentary flavors. Sweet, but definitely not too sweet. YUM! In addition to the food, the service was supreme. Our waiter had excellent suggestions and was friendly but not unprofessional. Exactly the kind of service you want every time you go out to eat.

Come on make it look pretty at least, I can make this at home. However, one thing I can't make at home were empanadas. I leave the deep frying to the professionals.

2011-12-02,5.0,"I give five stars for the food.  We ordered the jibarito and the pollo frito.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The jibarito had tender grilled steak, fresh lettuce and tomato, and the plantains was greasy enough not to be dry but not overly greasy.  Great combination of flavors.  The pollo frito takes 25 minutes, but it's well worth the wait.  The chicken isn't battered, but fried with a rub.  The rub is lemon and garlic and then they pile more fresh garlic on top.  A lot of cuisines do fried chicken, but I felt Habana Libre's spices showed they had something unique to offer.  Best of all are the rice and beans.  These are clearly my favorite rice and beans in the city.  The white rice is flavorful on its own, I bet they add a little butter.  The beans were very flavorful, probably cooked with lard and stock, which really brought out the flavor of the beans.  It was the right thickness and really, the right portion size for my taste.  The sweet plantain on the side was sweet and perfectly crispy fried.   I was a little disgusted by all the house rules.  Like they don't allow you to order a $6.95 sandwich at dinner.  They force you to add rice and beans and charge you $11.95.  The back of the menu also has a laundry list of rules.  For a group of 12, you only get to stay 2 hours.  After that, they charge you $60 to be there.  I understand they're trying to turn tables and make money and avoid awkward conversations with patrons overstaying their welcome.  But that's the business you're in.  I still give this place five stars though.  I really enjoyed eating there, and as long as I'm a good little patron and follow all the house rules, it's a fine place for a meal.",0.9928,0.784,0.172,0.044,0.5948979591836735

We ordered a couple of enpanadas and the maduras. The taste was fine, but the fact they were at room temperature made me think about how long they had been sitting out. The green sauce that came with the appetizers was hot, but tasty. The entrees were small portions for what I typically see at a Cuban restaurant and again, nothing was very hot.

These were not authentic since Cubans would never serve that sauce with the croquetas - The Carne Asada was okay, nothing out of this world Cons:  - Boliche Relleno was not good, I have no clue how they cooked it but it was heavy and had a strange after taste.

With one exception we all arrived a few minutes late for our 7:30 reservation. I blame this on the complete lack of parking near the restaurant (do not drive) and how painstakingly slow the Chicago Ave bus is. When we made it in our server was incredibly sweet and seated us right away. We were given ice for our wines and our server so kindly opened it for us since we were having a bit of difficulty.

Nice colorful atmosphere, and a little bit more upscale than your typical Cuban restaurant, with higher prices of specials to match.

There were a couple sauces for dipping and it was a nice way to get acquainted with the menu. There is so much on the menu it was hard to decide what to get next. I went with the Ropa Vieja, a nice shredded beef in tomato sauce, with rice and plantains. It was great! The Steamed Whole Red Snapper is probably on my ""next"" list and is one of El Menu De La Abuela, grandma's menu. Which includes the Liar Plate. Would like to get the story on that one!

I may not be cubana, but the food here makes me remember what my soul-food trained filipina mother cooked when I was a kid. Despite the coziness of the dining room, HL is a good place for groups.

The food - good lord, the food! I love the ox tail. Savory, tender, delicious - so much flavor.  The perfect thing to go with the beans and rice.  Also loved the pork soup, which was basically like collard greens with beans.  The appetizer sampler was perfect for a large group and my Guy always goes with the large cuts of meat - he loves the pork chop and steak. But he also gave a thumbs up to the fish he's had here. If you don't like garlic you might want to get something else, but the fish was veerry good. Mmm, the sauce. And now they deliver!

Last weekend, I embarked on my first adventure in to Cuban cuisine with a dinner at Habana Libre.  Because I had never had Cuban food before, I didn't exactly know what to expect.... or what to even order!  However, one of my dinner companions is a regular and helped guide me to the best dishes on the menu. For appetizers, I suggest a mixed plate of the guava, chicken and beef  empanadas.  The guava was clearly my fav as it appealed to one of my love of mixed flavors and textures - salty/sweet and crispy/soft.  The crispy plantains were tasty, especially with a little bit of their garlic sauce added on top.  I even tried them with the sauce that came with the empanadas for a slight variety and found it to be almost better than the garlic.  For my entree, I chose a shrimp dish by recommendation.  It essentially was shrimp and diced veggies swimming in garlic butter.  For such simple ingredients, it was really amazing.  Although, I swear I was feeling that garlic for two days.  Each dish came with a side of rice, beans and plantains.  And while it was really only white rice, there was something really scrumptious about them.  Perhaps it was the clean taste in contrast to the garlic of the rest of the dish. We skipped dessert since we had also been snacking on eye candy at the next table all night.   Habana Libre was a great pick for my first dive into Cuban food.  All future Cuban restaurants certainly have a lot to live up to!",0.9868,0.839,0.139,0.023,0.42633889099406336

For my main entree I settled on fried chicken legs with lemon juice and garlic (I can't remember the name of it at the moment). The portion was huge! And it came with rice, black beans, and plantains. The chicken was just crispy on the outside (no breading of any kind) and juicy on the inside. It was topped with chunks of garlic which make you think that it's going to be really strong but it was nice and mellow and almost ""pickled"" from the lemon juice.

Anyway, I decided to get some light eats since we were going to see The Pigeons at Swim Cafe later. We got some sweet fried plantains, 3 spinach empenadas and my husband got a pork dish.  The plantains had a slight crispiness to them and were definitely sweet. Very good, I could have eaten like 50 more of them.  The empenadas made me swoon. They were flavored so well - garlic, spices, spinach, chihuahua cheese in a crispy fried shell...man, nothing wrong with that.  My husband loved his pork dish - it looked really tender, he definitely didn't need a knife, he pulled it apart with his fork. We finished our dinner off with some coffee, a coffee with steamed milk and an espresso with sugar, and went on our merry way. Oh, this place is also BYOB, which adds to the awesomeness to it.

Clearly this place fell victim to it's own popularity and started skimping to make more money.  Maybe it was because I was there for lunch and not dinner but the prices were the same so I am not buying that excuse.  I went there with such excitement today, I can't believe I paid $13.95 for a pile of cooked onions.  As insut to injury, my friend ordered chicken soup and they brought him some different pork soup.  When the waiter took it back, we overheard the waiter lie to the owner /manager and say my friend hadn't really ordered the chicken soup.  Que poca madre!  So in sum, ""Meh.I've experienced better.""  It just stinks that the better was from this same place,.  With a heavy heart, I will move on to the next new Cuban place.",0.9679,0.834,0.114,0.052,0.47487857670784495

The menu is pretty extensive and has all the Cuban stapes.  The appetizers are numerous, there are two different soup offerings and a huge selection of sandwiches and entrees to choose from.  Although it is definitely possible to get out the door for around $12 an entrée a lot of the good stuff is $15+ a plate.  We went with a yucca appetizer that was decent, Ropa Vieja & a seafood special of the evening.   The Ropa Vieja was pretty tasty although only warm when it came out.  The seafood special was sort of a bust.  At almost $20 it should have been much heavier on the crab, shrimp and mussels and a lot lighter on the squid bodies, which the dish was mostly comprised of.  Not only that but the waitresses' description didn't accurately portray the dish so we were a bit surprised that it arrived in a similar heavy tomato sauce that is used for the Ropa Vieja.  It was good just slight over priced and not exactly what we were into on that particular evening.   Wait service here left a bit to be desired.  My water glass sat empty for at least 10 minutes and was only refilled upon request after our waiter had come and gone from our table twice.  Also, our meals were delivered at separate times, which if you are a party of 12 is cool but for 2 people is a bit odd.  Once we paid the bill our waiter was all over us too and I don't really appreciate that especially after the service during the meal was suspect.   Ordered a coconut flan that was tasty. The atmosphere within the restaurant is actually really nice and the storefront look from the street can be somewhat deceptive.  There are tons of plants and little decorative trinkets that definitely reminded me of many of the Cuban spots I went to in South Florida.  We both thought it was a bit odd there was only one speaker in the entire restaurant though.

Started off with two empanadas and boiled yuca.   Chicken empanada was seasoned to perfect, both were delicious crispy.  The guava filling seemed like a jelly and arguably was a touch over sweet, but a delicious change of pace from savory empanadas. Ropa Vieja.  Best I've had in Chicago as far as the meat goes.  Perfect.  The black beans and plantains are both solid, and the only disappointment is the rice, and the lack of cilantro all over the place. The fajitas ""with a cuban twist"" are fantastic.  For one, you get a large serving, rice, black beans, and fantastic plantains.  The meat is seasoned spectacularly (this seemed to be a theme).

2009-10-13,5.0,"Dude. I don't think there are words to describe the state I was in last night. It was intense and beautiful. And perfect. Birthdays are strange. I mean, it's a bunch of people celebrating you being born. When really, you did nothing to deserve such celebration. Your mother did all the work. You just cried a lot and took a few lousy first breaths. I've just never really understood it. I like attention just fine, but only when I rightly deserve it. So in my mind, birthdays should be about having a good time, without a great deal of fuss being made over the celebration or myself. Which is why I'm incredibly glad to have spent my latest birthday at Habana Libre. My group of 6 on a Monday night waited maybe 5 minutes maximum for our table. The service was...slow at best but the food more than made up for it. You know when you're so incredibly full to the point of bursting and you think you might die if you eat anymore but the food is so insanely delicious that you Just. Can't. Stop. Eating? Yeah. That was me last night. It was that good. Jibarito was excellent (Cubans are geniuses...plantain sandwich=orgasm). Chicken, steak and pork were also excellent. My friend had a pork something or other though that LITERALLY melted in my mouth. I wasn't aware that was possible. I don't even like pork that much (aside from bacon of course). But that...whatever it was...was divine. Best birthday in a long time. Granted that had a lot to do with the cheap wine and fantastic company. But the food definitely factored in hugely.

2009-07-01,5.0,"Oh I have so much to say about Habana Libre!!  Act One: I came here for a lovely Yelp GNO hosted by Angie M. It was wonderful. She had arranged for a fixed price dinner. We enjoyed empanadas and croquettes for appetizers, a nice green salad, then entrees of Arroz con Glandules, black beans and rice, grilled veggies, ropa vieja to die for, and grilled chicken dish. All of it was YUMMY!! To top it all off we had our choice of coconut and vanilla flan for dessert. Everyone BYOB'd and the total, including tax and tip, was $30 a person. Such a deal! They even wrapped up the leftovers for us to take home. Nice touch, Habana Libre.  Act Two: I was so impressed with Habana Libre that I decided to make this the site of a monthly dinner with my favorite gays (and we let Nick come along too.) I really liked the dinner we had at the GNO, but wanted to try other things on the menu and we did.  We had a lovely little sampler platter with empanadas, croquettes, some type of puffy potato ball with meat in it, plantains, and an additional order of civeche. Yummy-yummers! I could have stopped right there, but we had entrees to order. I decided on the garlic shrimp, and was able to sample the fried pork and the ox tail. The fried pork was charred deliciousness. I had never had ox tail before but, damn, that was good stuff! For dessert, I went with the coconut flan again while someone else ordered the mango sorbet (everyone else was too full!) The mango sorbet was so delicious and it was served in a hollowed out mango shell. Uhm...cute!  If you decide to go, try the ox tail. I was scared at first but I was told to ""just put it in your mouth!"" Damn, you sound like my prom date!

2009-07-01,4.0,"Welcome to this months episode of  3 Pickles, a Vajayjay, and Mr. Cucumber's ethnic dinning  This time we do Cuban (No, that's not ""do a"" Cuban, Pickle #2)!! Cuban cuisine is basically a fusion of Spanish, African, and Caribbean spices, flavors, and techniques. After little debate, Habana Libre was the destination. Pickle #1 says ""get the car Mr. Cucumber, because we're going to Noble Square"".  Parking in the area is a little challenging but thankfully Habana has valet (how cool is that) and it wasn't very expensive. Sadly you really have to watch out for this storefront location because it can be easily missed or looked over. But once inside you are transported to Cuba... just kidding, it's really just one big open room with a counter in the back for pick ups and tables everywhere. You really get that feeling of being on top of everyone (you can easily overhear others conversations... those poor people that had to listen to our group and our dirty talk) and talk about mood lighting (very romantic... which gave this group some ideas!!), at least you can still see your food and your company.  Ordering can be a little tricky, especially if you don't speak the language (which gives me an idea... maybe we should have a special guest that speaks the language of the places we are going) but if you have patience you will figure it out or at least be adventurous enough to just try what they put in front of you. Through it all our waitresses were sweethearts, always smiling and had a lot of patience with this challenging group.  The food was an array of spices that left the tongue wanting more and more. Thank god for the Vajayjay because we would never be able to decide on what to start with. She organized a great appetizer combo which consisted of empanadas, croquettes, papa rellenos (mashed potatoes filled with ground meat and fried), tostones and fried yucca. But of course we had to add some ceviche too. It was all delicious, plus the two sauces that they serve with these items top them off with the perfect kick. One was a house blend Verde (which had a sweet but spicy tingle to it) and the other was a garlicky oil concoction (it was so good that we all almost licked the cups clean). My main dish (which I hear is a lunch time favorite) was the Pan Con Pollo, a brick style cook chicken served on French bread. The chicken is super thin, super tender, marinated, and served with lettuce, tomatoes and onions. I loved it, cheap and very tasty! The others enjoyed fried pork, shrimp, roasted chicken, and braised oxtail. All were very satisfied with their choices and all including myself were so stuffed it took awhile to get up from our seats. Habana Libre is BYOB and of course a few bottles of wine always helps lighten the mood (not that it's ever needed with this group but trying to get the Vajayjay tipsy is always fun).  Great food and interesting conversation always makes these meetings a pleasure. Great selection Pickle #3, what's next!?!",0.999,0.772,0.208,0.02,0.5922978080120939
2009-06-17,4.0,"I'm stuffed just thinking about the dinner we had at Habana Libre. And it was a week ago, so what does that tell you? First of all, BYOB. If you've read any other reviews, you already know it's BYOB. But I am personally suffering through difficult economic times, so BYOB is a plus. Second, or maybe this should be first, you're going to walk right past it. Well, maybe not, because there is a big red and gold (or is it maroon?) awning. But when you see it, you'll think, ""Is this hole in the wall where I'm going?"" Yes. Trust me, once you're inside, you'll feel better. Especially if you brought your own B. Hint: It's next to Flo. Third, the service. It's a little confusing. Yes, there may seem to be more than one person waiting on your table. It all works out in the end. And yes, you may have to tune your ears a little bit to the accents, or ask your server to repeat herself at times. She won't mind. You're not the first gringo she's waited on. As for the food -- very nice. We started with the appetizer combo, which comes with empanadas, croquettes, papa rellenos -- mashed potatoes filled with ground meat and fried, yum -- tostones and fried yucca. It's served with a couple of sauces, one of which is this garlicky oil that I wanted to pour on everything. And because we're piggy-wiglets, we had to have the ceviche too. A very generous portion, served with chopped tomatoes and onions, because it's Cuban y'know.  For an entree, I was interested in the pollo frito, which is 2 chicken leg portions fried with garlic and lemon. It sounds simple, but it's supposed to be great. It also takes half an hour, so I settled for the fried pork. Crispity crunchity on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside. Other entrees included shrimp, roasted chicken, a big ol' sammich, and braised oxtail. I only tried the oxtail, but it was terrific -- falling off the bone, with a warm aroma and flavor. We didn't save room for dessert, but I had some anyway. To wit, mango sorbet, which is one of my faves. What I wasn't expecting was for the sorbet to be served inside the mango shell. Very clever. And if you're piggy wiglets like us (see above), this gives you as opportunity to scoop out some additional frozen magoey goodness. Thank god I got a ride home. Though the area is busy enough that there are cabs a-plenty. By the way, we managed to stuff ourselves silly (or stuff our silly selves) for less than 30 bucks a person. Tax and tip included.

Cruised on down Chicago Ave last monday to meet Arlene M. for some BYOB grubbin. Best way to kick off a sure to be crappy work week. We got the appetizer combo deal which was pretty much a plate full of fried goodness. The rellena de papa was super tasty. Pretty much like a deep fried mashed potato ball stuffed with meat. Croquetas were great. The tostones were awesome. And that garlic sauce? Soooo good. I mean, I'd have no chance of landing any hotties at the bar afterwords but it was so worth it. On the plus side, I also wasn't in any danger of being bitten by a vampire. On to the entrees. I got the special. Roast pork which was melt in your mouth tender. The white rice and black beans were crazy good. And I do love the plantains. Arlene went with the tried and true Ropa Vieja. Also wonderful. Service is slow here but that was more than fine with me. We had a couple bottles of vino to attend to so no hurry. But there attentiveness made up for the lack of speed. They were super sweet. I wish that I had saved room for the desserts that my fellow yelpers have raved about, but we decided to keep that little extra room for an after dinner beer down the street at Five Star.",0.9953,0.712,0.234,0.054,0.5572887488328665

I haven't procrastinated per se, I wanted to write something witty yet informative, maybe throw in a Castro joke/pun and some fun facts about Cuba. FAIL!  In lieu of something funny and interesting I'll get down to business:  [Insert Castro joke here - Fidel or Raul take your pick]  I strolled into Habana Libre for my very first GNO, kudos to Angie M for planning a fabulous dinner. There are 2 things you must know to make your dining experience at HL a success: (1) cash only and (2) BYOB.  To start we were served Croquetas, Empanadas, and a mixed greens salad. I tried the fish croquetas and veggie empanadas, both were tasty; the empanadas were my favorite I could have made a meal out of those alone. The salad was salad, not much else to say except the pieces of lettuce were big and the plates small making it hard to put much on your plate at a time.  Next we had our choice of Cuban rice or Arroz con Glandules. My spanish sucks, but reportedly Glandules is some sort of pork; sounds like a body part to me. Since I don't eat pork I went with the veggie-friendly Cuban rice - very tasty; the other rice also got rave reviews.  The rice was followed by the main dish. There were three dishes to choose from - chicken, beef, and veggie. I went with the veggies and found this part of the meal just good, not great. While the chicken and beef dishes looked amazing, the veggie dish looked like a boring plate of steamed veggies. Fortunately, looks can be deceiving and the seasoning they cooked the veggies with was very tasty.  I'm not sure if the veggie dish is a regular menu item, but being described as fajitas could lead to some disappointment if you order this. These are not the fajitas you think of when you order them at your local americanized Mexican or Tex Mex joint - no sour cream, tortillas, etc. here my friend. Still good, just different. The meal was capped off with a choice of two types of flan. Flan is not my thing, but from the oohs and ahhhs it was the best flan ever.

Service was a bit slow, even though the place wasn't full, and my drink came very late in the meal even though I asked for it to start. The fried yucca is garlic dip was really good; yucca is a tricky root to prepare correctly, but theirs is lightly crispy on the outside and very moist on the inside, like a perfect steak fry. And the garlic dip is INSANELY WAY TOO GARLICKY which mean it's just right. The Cuban sandwich is tasty but not amazing; the ham doesn't seem much better than grocery store cold cuts. Maybe I just don't care for thin-sliced ham. Thick slices give you that wonderful ham texture, while thin slices, if you think about it, have that much more surface area to dry out and turn just ever so rubbery, even in the brief time between exposure and sandwich-stuffing. Could be just a personal preference. In any case, the bread was perfectly crunchy-chewy. I've heard people laud up the jibarito, but I feel funny going into a Cuban place and ordering a Puerto Rican specialty. It's kind of like going into a pizza place and ordering chili. Don't you feel weird when you're in a Thai restaurant and you see, like, potstickers on the menu?

I can speak from experience and say it's no easy task to wrangle all the Yelp girls, assemble a fantastic pre-fixe menu *and* keep it all at $30 a head... it certainly helps to have an on-top-of-it party planner extraordinaire and what even trumps that is to have a delightful restaurant at your beck and call making the evening seamless and of course, tasty, which is exactly what Habana Libre did!!  The casual digs were perfect for our raucous crowd! This joint definitely has the feel of 'summer spot' written all over it... super chill, unfussy, wear your flip flops kind of place. You can expect the (slightly language barrier challenged) service to be just as lax as the décor, but hey, the Libre is BYOB so sip your tallboy Tecate and go with the flow.  Food was nummy in my Cubanita tummy with the highlights definitely being the empanadas - the chicken and veggie ones were TO DIE FOR - and the ropa vieja simmering away in the most extraordinary combo of caramelized onions, spices, roasted red peppers and a tangy, meaty, savory broth had each and every one of us lassies harmonizing in satisfied moans and groans. A bit lackluster were the croquettas and arroz dishes... with the croquettas being bland and the rice being dry it wasn't even remotely challenging for me to steer clear of the carbs at this meal, fortunately.

I pushed open the door and joined the large party that had gathered on this night for it was Girls Night Out on Yelp and that always means a fun evening of food, wine and lively conversation.  The menu was fixed so some of the amazing dishes on the menu will have to wait for me to explore on my own- as the picked dishes, while good, probably wouldn't have been what I would have chosen.  We started with some croquettes which were like fish and mashed potato sticks. The sauce was good but other wise a bit bland. Next up- the empanadas- tasty and hot and we had three kinds to try- beef, chicken and vegetarian. The chicken was my favorite- perfectly seasoned with a little bite at the end.  Next up the salad. Simply dressed this was really good- we just needed slightly larger plates to enjoy it on as for the entire evening-we ate off of appetizer sized plates. Finally to the entrees. There was Ropa Vieja and chicken and onions served with rice with sausage bits in it. All were very good- it's just probably not what I would have ordered.  Service was attentive, BYOB always makes for an inexpensive evening and parking is fairly easy along the side streets (watch out for permit only areas).  I will be back to try some of the other delights on the menu like jibartos, ceviche, plantains, salmon, just to name a few.

I had the special which was two monster pieces of fried pork (very tender, but a little fatty) with garlic on top alongside a mountain of white rice, two fried plantains and a cup of yummy black beans. All that food for only $6.99 seemed worth it to me. We ordered extra plantains because, well, who wouldn't? They were caramelized and delicious.

I've had the paella, sandwich Cubano, and some pork dish the name of which I do not recall, as well as several appetizers and dessert. The food is all good to excellent, especially the paella and the Cuban sandwich. However, this place charges a fairly steep corking fee for BYOB.

I don't understand BYOB places that charge a corking fee. Corking fees are for restaurants that sell alcohol, but also charge a small fee for customers bringing their own alcohol. I don't have a problem with that, but a BYOB restaurant, IMO, should not be charging a corking fee. But that was not the deal breaker for me. I was at Habana Libre with a few of my friends, and we were almost done with our meal, when another friend stopped by and sat with us while we finished.

At first, everything was good.  We sat, the server came over in a timely manner.  He took our order.  Soon after, we received great Cuban bread, which we inhaled.  Next, our appetizers came out, 2 carne empanadas and 2 papas rellenas.

Why didn't our server just go back to the kitchen.  After we saw the two servers deliberating, our server came back over and asked what we had ordered.  What, really?  You have no idea what we ordered when you wrote it down.  Unbelievable!

I am hoping we just went on an off night.  I would like to try this place again but I will probably try to find another place first.",0.9825,0.832,0.128,0.04,0.49344444444444446

We took a load home.  Surroundings were quaint and staff friendly and correct.  What could I complain about? Ahhh... parking can be tough on Fri night, if you have to drive.

2009-03-15,3.0,"I had just finished some serious studying and I was starving and ready to eat pie (Pi day 3/14!). My boyfriend was coming up to meet me in my neighborhood, so we met for lunch at Habana Libre. We walked in and were seated after a couple of minutes waiting by the door. We were seated at a little table and I headed to the bathroom. When I came back, the server was at our table, asking for our appetizer order. We were so hungry that anything would have sounded good, but the empanadas she recommended sounded great.  These little guys came out after only 5-10 minutes, giving us plenty of time to peruse the menu. I really liked the empanada, filled with green pepper, onion, baccala, and green olives, but my boyfriend didn't like the texture of the fish. The server just said cod when she was describing the empanada, but baccala is a completely different taste than fresh cod, and it should be noted in the description of the dish. We were warned when we ordered that my pollo frito would take 25 minutes to cook, which was really nice. 30-45 minutes later, we got our food. The pollo frito was delicious--it's 2 fried legs and things, served with garlic oil on top. It came artfully presented, and wasn't greasy. The skin was super crispy and I liked that it wasn't breaded, just fried. Yum. This came with standard white rice and black beans, which were a really nice, simple side dish to the rich chicken. My boyfriend got the Cubano, his standard by which he judges Cuban restaurants, and he said this one did not disappoint. I have never had a Cuban sandwich before, but after trying his, I think I am in love. Two kinds of pork, cheese, pickles? Delightful. The bread was really crispy and I loved the textural contrast between the bread and the fillings. The only complaint I have is the service was really slow. Like really slow. Service is a pretty low priority for me when I'm at a restaurant, but it took almost 15 minutes to get a to-go box and the check. When our food was taking extra-long, we simply got a ""your food will be ready soon"" in passing from one of our servers. We had two people serving us, kind of switching off, which was strange and may have contributed to the confusion. I'll definitely be back, but probably for take-out.",0.997,0.784,0.176,0.041,0.5281179138321994

2009-03-09,4.0,"Ever since I was first introduced to Cuban cuisine in Miami, I have been HOOKED!  Since I can't hop a flight to FL every time I get a hankering for ropa vieja, Habana Libre is here to fulfill my cravings.  I have been 2 times now, and both times the food was great! I've tried new things each time, and my list of must-haves is growing!  On my most recent visit, I was very surprised to see the restaurant packed! When my friends and I previously had dinner here, also on a weekend, the place was half empty. Maybe the word is getting out on how good the food is! Glad we thought to make a reservation!  The restaurant is quite small, so I wouldn't recommend going with a large group.  We were a group of 6, and there was a group of 8-10 behind us, and it was a tight squeeze.   I would strongly suggest getting the chef's special, which is at the very top of the first page of the menu. A nice selection of some of Habana Libre's best dishes, for a great price! The enchilado shrimp and the deep fried pork chunks are the standouts there. Those can both be ordered as entrees, btw.  This time we ordered the appetizer sampler, and I thought the chicken empanadas were surprisingly flavorful! My favorite out of everything on the platter. Everything is fried, yet nothing is greasy. My boyf, who has never had Cuban food before, ordered the yucca stuffed with beef appetizer and LOVED it!  Another favorite entree is the oxtail. I usually do not care for oxtail, but it is SO tender and flavorful. Wow. The garlic shrimp were slightly overcooked, but GOOD!  Speaking of garlic, if you are a garlic lover, you came ot the right place!  Many of the dishes come with garlic sauce, which seems to be basically garlic and oil!  So yummy...but stinky! At first glance, the entrees might seem a bit small, but keep in mind they all come with black beans and rice and plantains. I personally LOVE black beans & rice, and plantains are one of my most favoritest foods - something sweet to contrast with the saltiness of everything else.  Dessert! I LOVE Cuban coffee aka Cuban Crack! Super strong and sweet, no cream necessary. They make a great one here! Good fuel for a long night out! Also tried the flan, which was heavier and creamier than I am used to, but it was DELISH.  At this most recent dinner, I found the place to be alot louder than I remembered, so much so that I couldn't hear the waitress when she was explaining things at the end of our table. Our waitress was a bit exasperated when we kept asking her to repeat everything! Lo siento!  I suppose I can't complain too much, because I love the lively music, it adds to the festive atmosphere! I already know what I want to try next time - the Cuban sandwich and one of the steak dishes. They all sound muy sabroso!  Habana Libre is BYOB - yay!  Just keep in mind that everyone who drinks must order an entree, which I think is a reasonable request. To experience some great Cuban food at an affordable price, give Habana Libre a try. Good food and good times guaranteed!",0.9989,0.769,0.207,0.025,0.5496061315733448

She was friendly but a little impatient.   Food - we had a good selection.  By far, again, my Oxtail was my favorite, but two people ordered two different shrimp dishes and they were delicious.  The fried pork (massa?) was awesome as well.  The appetizer platter for 6 was just ok. Don't order snapper here.  It wasn't good at all.  I like fishy things but this was REALLY fish.  very unfresh.  Everything else is very good and we like coming here because we can eat alot and BYOB.  Total bill was $28pp inclusive of tax and tips and we had a bunch to eat!",0.9957,0.708,0.269,0.024,0.6004059829059829

2009-03-07,3.0,"This is a difficult place to review. I will admit right off the bat, that after going here I have realized that maybe if the menu is in Spanish, I just prefer the dishes to be Mexican. Is that so bad? So that aside, the food here is decent. I was expecting to be wowed after all of the things I heard about Habana Libre. I wasn't really anything. We ordered an appetizer sampler, and I tried the fried yucca and green plantains. I actually like the green plantains with the garlic sauce better than the sweet. And the yucca kind of just tastes like potato. So not bad, but not orgasmic either. To round out my meal I ordered a veggie empanada, which was really good. I also ordered a side of cuban rice which was basically white rice and black beans mixed together, with the bean juice making the rice black. I was not impressed. It was kind of weird, and I like black beans, just not with their black juice smothering my rice.  So overall I had a few good things here, but nothing stellar. And I guess when I eat mexican I love my whole meal; sorry cuba... your food just doesn't stand up in my mind. Habana Libre as a restaurant is nice inside, which you wouldn't really expect from the ""Little Shop of Horrors"" menagerie of plants in the front window... but I was surprised with the interior, and the service was good.

The shredded beef was tender, tasty, with some grilled peppers.  We got the pork yellow rice, and black bean rice.

2009-02-25,4.0,"What a delicious meal -- and look at all our leftovers! We called ahead to try to make a reservation, and while they don't take reservations for parties of two, they said they're not too busy on a Saturday night around 7.  We ended up being a bit later than planned and arrived about 7:30.  There was a huge group of people taking up about a third of the tables and most of the other tables were already taken.  Luckily, there were two tables still open - we were placed at a two-top that was kinda teeny and a bit in the way of the central aisle near the kitchen, but it worked out ok.  In the end we definitely weren't the ones that the wait staff had to work around - about 15 minutes later the place was SO CROWDED - it was like cattle being corralled down that aisle!  While for the most part, it wasn't too big of an issue, there were on occasion people who seemed to be too oblivious to realize that their butts were starting to infringe on our dining space.   Now, onto the food.  My bf said that he read that other yelpers said the paella was good, and since that sounded great to both of us, that's what we tried.  Two caveats though - 1) It's either for 2 or 4 people, no individual portions, 2) it took about an hour.  That was ok with us since we didn't have any set plans afterwards, but if you do, you might have to go with something else.  We did decide to start with a couple apps though so we'd have something to snack on while we sipped our wine.  The sweet plantains were AMAZING!  We also had black beans and rice, which was good, but typical.  After being patient for about 50 minutes, I was so excited for the paella when it actually came out.  It was HUGE.  I mean it.  It basically ended up being our meal for another night - and then some.  If you don't want leftovers - plan on the 2 person size feeding 4-5 people.   Overall, it was great - savory rice with chicken, pork and lot of different seafood!  Oh, and how could I forget - BYOB ... definitely deserves bonus points! Overall, this somewhat unremarkable exterior houses a place to have very delicious Cuban food.  While the place was a bit overcrowded maybe it's because it was just in one of the weekly yelp newsletters - maybe the extreme crowding is only temporary.  Next time I'm craving plantains, I'll be back to find out!",0.997,0.832,0.154,0.014,0.4882105943152455
2009-02-21,4.0,"I really enjoyed this place; it made me think about increasing the rate at which I consume Carribean food.  Food: This visit was my first to this place, but what we ordered was excellent. We had the standard Cuban sandwich and the roasted pork. The food was flavorful and distinctive. I enjoy the slightly more European bent that's typical of Cuban food and that differentiates it slightly from food from Puerto Rico or the Dominican Republic (cuisines which I also enjoy). We ordered the fried unripe plantain with garlic sauce as an appetizer. That was good, but not as good as I'd thought it would be. There was nothing wrong with the appetizer, I could tell it was good, just a little too plain for me personally. The entrées were delicious and unique. I had a cafe con leche at the meal's conclusion and it was excellent. I had never had one before. However, unless I'm missing something, it's just a cappuccino with slightly more milk. I liked it. Ambiance: Cute and intimate, It's a little place with festive Cuban themed stuff on the walls. It's what you'd expect, but still pleasant. I've always been a fan of Afro-Carribean music, which they play at a good volume.  Service: Friendly but slow. Not unbearable.  The negatives: The menu is kind of restricting, but it's a small place so I can take that into consideration. While very good, the food was too greasy. I'm very familiar with ""ethnic"" cuisines and I've definitely seen much worse, but for a place in the two dollar sign range, they should make it so you can eat the meal without getting oil all over your hands. ""Authentic"" Cuban food might be like that, but this is a mid-rangeish restaurant, so they should clean up the oil...

I was not as equally impressed with the spinach and cheese but it was still tasty.  For lunch we split the Cuban sandwich and the Jibarito. They were HUGE.

However, I think that my penchant for canned meals only makes me more able to speak about Habana Libre. It's such simple fare but something about it is just so! darn! good! I did my homework. I knew the fam would be in town and they love Cuban food. I ran into the restaurant a few days before they arrived and grabbed a menu. I was impressed by their pork offerings and, after showing my Dad, we decided to go. The layout of the restaurant is nothing to shout about. Mostly 4-tops with basic white table cloths. I did notice that a few tables had legit cloth napkins and some tables had just paper napkins (weird) but I'm not sure why. The bathroom was clean but freezing; if you didn't have to pee BEFORE you sat down, you sure as hell did AFTER sitting on the ice cold seat. woah. To begin, we ordered the H.L. Combination for 2 (there were 4 of us) and it was just the right amount to get a taste of 4 different kinds of Cuban foods without getting too full. The garlic oil that is served with the Yuccas will knock your socks off. My Dad handed out mints to the family shortly after dinner to defuse the stink. P.U. My Dad and I ordered the roasted pork. It came very simply with grilled onions and a side of rice and beans. The pork was absolutely delicious. It was super juicy and tender. It reminded me a bit of Kaluha Pork I had at a Luau in Hawaii. I honestly ate it by sticking it in my mouth and sucking the juices off the meat before swallowing to get the full flavor. The rice was served all lunch-lady style with an ice cream scoop which I think is odd but it was as good as it gets. It was buttery and sticky and moist; I'm going to say it was near-perfect basic white rice. The beans were yummy too in the most basic way possible.  My sister ordered a jibarito. She is typically a chicken-only kinda gal so it surprised me that she got red meat but the enjoyed it completely, especially the plantains for a bun. My Mom ordered the chicken fajitas with rice and beans. She enjoyed them even though she had to ask for tortillas.  I will return here. The price was right, the food was excellent, and the service felt authentic. I am genuinly excited to go back and try another menu item. The restaurant was dead (only 6 people total including my party of 4) so I hope that more people try this place so they don't go out of business. I'm trying to be picky with my 5-star ratings in order to get some street cred 'round these parts so I am only giving it 4-stars BUT I have faith and we will see how my next trip there goes.",0.9962,0.807,0.148,0.045,0.5686580086580085

2008-12-15,5.0,"íFeliz cumpleaños a mi! I had a lovely birthday evening at Habana Libre. As the birthday girl, I had the chance to try everyone's entrée because who was going to stop me? I think sampled about four different animals during my three hours here. Here is the breakdown: VACA: The ropa vieja was tender and delicious, and by far the most popular choice at our table. Peppery in its bath of tomato sauce, there was plenty to share and some to take home.  POLLO: The empanadas were fantastico - crispy on the outside and hot and steamy on the inside. Love that garlic dippin' sauce! In addition to chicken, I was also able to try the beef and pork, which were equally delicious.  CERDO: When in Cuba, have a Cuban. If you can't find a Javier or a Pedro to your liking, eat a sandwich! Served on grilled French bread, this pork, pickle, and swiss cheese. Comes with rice and beans. You have the option of getting beans and rice separately or mixed together (""Cuban style""). Let the masters do the mixin' and opt for the Cuban style. It really does make a difference.  SALMÓN: It swam in the sea and now swims in my belly. This huge portion of grilled salmon emerged under a mound of mango salsa and was accompanied by a cold salad of green and red peppers. The contrasting flavors popped and locked all over my tastebuds.  Don't forget the yucca and fried plantains! In addition to the reasonable prices, BYOB makes Habana Libre a great option when you are hurting for cash and a home-cooked meal. Extra great if you like leftovers because you will have plenty!",0.9889,0.84,0.143,0.016,0.590625

2008-12-04,3.0,"Despite Johnny T.'s warnings I went to Habana b/c I was craving Cuban food, my son was hungry and it was nearby. This would be a 2.5 rating but since we can't rate on the half stars, and the server was so nice with my son, I will lean toward the three stars. For those that don't know, I am a Miami native of Cuban descent who happens to know and love to cook anything. So.  I ordered a pan con bistec, tostones (unripened plantains smashed and fried), they didn't have batido (shake) de mamey (tropical fruit), so just a coke. My husband ordered the Puerto Rican dish, jibarito, for our son, ham croquettes and a cup of chicken soup. Tostones were PERFECT. Crispy on the outside and just a little tender on the inside. I told my son they were fried banana cookies....devoured in seconds.  Pan con bistec: marinade on steak was on target, cut of sirloin steak was a bit fatty (typical), bread was not Cuban but French (they also do that in Miami to make it a bit more fancy--or it just reheats better than the former), no potato sticks in the sandwich. It met my craving but that's about it.  Jibarito: didn't get to try it b/c my husband inhaled it. Chicken soup: eh. La Carreta in Miami makes it awesome. Slices of bread with garlic oil spread. Ok and typical.  Ham croquettes: This is the standard in all Cuban parties and it was just awful. The cook used green pepper as a spice in the filling...big no-no. It has to taste like ham and nothing else. It  was served with some mayo dressing that was ok, but croquettes are served with a wedge of lime and saltines. This was a big disappointment and my son even said ""I don't like it!"".  The place itself looks like a Miami joint in one of those strip malls where there is a dollar store and possibly a tinted window place. I'm very sorry, but with this introduction, this is not typical Cuban cuisine.  I plan to try 90 Miles when my cravings rise again. Another note: black beans are decent. Rice was not. They used short grain instead of long grain and it was burnt in some areas (probably from scraping it from the bottom of the pot).",0.9863,0.848,0.11,0.042,0.523888888888889

As a matter of fact, I've been returning for quite some time and have found this place to be quite a cool spot for some good Cuban food. When you come in you will find that it is not a fancy place but rather a quaint one. The service is usually pretty good and attentive. I've only come here for lunch so I can't speak for how they do during dinner service; however, lunch time is a pretty easy and relaxing time to sit for a meal. So I've had almost every appetizer they have on the menu and quite a few of their sandwiches. All tasted pretty good but their Cuban sandwich is still one of their best. I did enjoy my Jibarito as it was my first time trying it; which still puzzles me how I was able to avoid such a creative sandwich. So I would have no problem giving this place a 5 star review but my last trip was a slight downer. I bit into my Jibarito and found a good portion of plastic wrap in my sandwich. I decided not to guess how it got there but It seemed OK and I was able to avoid eating it - I think anyways. I did tell the server what happened but wasn't really offered an apology or explanation.

2008-11-30,4.0,"A friend and I were responsible for arranging a birthday dinner party for 20 at this restaurant on a Friday. We chose it because of the great reviews on food, but had trouble with the reservation because of the group size. Aside from the trouble at the beginning, our experience was pretty decent, so read on! First, the restaurant is small and very busy, so with a reservation of 15+ people the following rules apply (these rules are printed on the back of the menu and are more or less recited over the phone at the time of reservation): - the party cannot stay more than 1 hr 45 min, otherwise it costs $60 for an additional hour. we didn't learn about the $60 fee until we read it on the back of the menu at the restaurant. - each person must order an entree - $3 corking fee per bottle of wine or 6 pack of beer (restaurant is BYOB) - 15-20% tip included - party must be ON TIME or you risk the restaurant not honoring your reservation *Despite these rules, I don't believe our party was charged the $60 or the corking fees. My friend called the morning before to make the reservation, but when I called in the evening to change the # of guests, the restaurant said they had no record of a reservation from earlier. Re-making the reservation was frustrating since I was passed between 3 or 4 people on the phone. It was annoying, but I suppose 20 person parties are not normally hosted there. Aside from the rules and the trouble with the actual making of the reservation, things went more or less well. Everyone showed up on time, and we ordered promptly (we were concerned about the 1 hr 45 min rule and weren' t sure when they started timing). The food was served in about an hour or hour and a half, and everyone was merrily drinking their BYOB alcohol (bought from the liquor store located conveniently down the street) and eating the garlic bread that was brought out in the meantime. Personally, my jibarito was delicious and came with a plate of rice and black beans. Some people's dishes were a bit cold by the time they were served though I suppose this is part of the challenge of serving 20 people from a small kitchen. Paella was salty. Overall I think the consensus was that the high yelp rating was warranted - many people mentioned that they would like to come back and try other food with a smaller group one day. The waitstaff were very businesslike and a little disorganized (probably because of our large party on a busy night). It seemed like they were probably friendly on a normal basis, but were stressed over handling such a large group. At one point someone ordered some dessert for the birthday girl. The birthday song was blasted from the speakers as the waitstaff came out smiling and singing and carrying a flan decorated with a candle. They even had a straw hat for her! In summary, there was trouble with the reservation and party size and the rules for large parties was an unpleasant surprise, but since the $60 fee and corking fees weren't enforced for our group, everything turned out great. The food was savory and I will be going back in the future with just 1 or 2 other people to enjoy all of the pros without any of the cons.",0.9921,0.799,0.134,0.067,0.4389226925338035

Two generous hunks of pork, tender, juicy, lightly fried, and topped with garlic and citrus. On the side you get a surprisingly stellar cup of black beans along with rice and plantains.

In addition to the empanadas we had plantain chips with garlic sauce and pappas rellenos - little fried mashed potato balls with beef inside. Very tasty! I ordered the Cuban sandwich, my wife had the chicken sandwich (pan con pollo) and our friend had the Pan Con Ropa Vieja (shredded beef sandwich). Every dish was fantastic. In fact on our second visit to Habana I actually ordered the Ropa Vieja because after tasting my friend's sandwich the first night I thought it was even better than the Cuban I had. All the sandwiches are served on a toasty French-like bread and come with black beans and rice for a bit extra, and I'll also note were some of the best black beans I've had in some time.

I chose the fried pork and I wish I remembered the name. I was a little skeptical about eating something fried but after my first bite all my skepticism went away. I couldn't even tell it was fried, the meat was so tender and just fell off when I sliced into it. I also chose the white rice and beans for my side and I can't believe how great they both tasted.

We chatted away, when our server stopped back again, I decided we needed for the sake of her, my stomach, and the ensuing lightly tingling feeling I had in my head, we should order appetizers. Since the task was given to me, I opted for the tostones with shrimp, think a hot shrimp cocktail in little fried plantain bowls. Two different empanadas, one shrimp and one chicken, which weren't greasy at all but flaky and flavorful. And we got some pretty decent sized balls. These balls were so tender and we completely enjoyed having them in our mouths. Oh, these balls were made of soft mashed potatoes and seasoned ground beef and then deep fried. These are the kind of balls everyone will want to put their lips around. (Oh get your mind out of the gutter) Although the appetizers were filling, we... I needed more sustenance. Carol and I split their roasted pork with choice of rice. I went with their smoky mixed black beans and rice, which was really flavorful and tasty. The pork was tender, full of flavor from the onions and garlic and the plantains were cooked just right, firm, but soft at the same time.

Everything was tasty, especially with the addition of the straight up garlic sauce they give you for dipping purposes. The weakest element was the empanada, which was too sweet, and the meat a bit too mysterious for my tastes. There was also this giant ball they gave us that had potato and some other element inside. To this day, I have no clue what the fuck I ate. Maybe a croqueta? But then again we got this cylindrical thing that tasted awesome, with more unknown filling, that I could have sworn was a croqueta. Bottom line: do not expect to have any clue what you are eating, unless you're smarter than me, which is technically impossible, unless you too were genetically engineered by robots.

After lowering my cholesterol 40 points with all the garlic sauce on the appetizers, the jiboringrito tasted kind of like... well, nothing.

Slightly romantic atmosphere at night... soft salsa (music), candles... like something out of a movie. We had your basic rice and black beans dish, and a steak dish. Excellent. I wish I could remember the name for next time, but unfortunately I was preoccupied. The second time I came back, I was telling my 2 girlfriends that this place was great. My Cuban/Puerto Rican friend, Kaylah, said she'd be the judge of that. I now wished I had remember my Puerto Rican friend, JoLin, is extremely turned off by rude service. I think it must have been about  8 big slurps out of our empty glasses of water (and JoLin loudly saying ""I wish I had more water."") before our waitress finally brought a pitcher, and the decided to leave it there for us to serve ourselves.

Our server talked up the special Paella so much we just had to try it: the fresh seafood alone sounded so great! Problem is, the Paella was $50 for two, and they would not let us order it to split among 4. $50 for Paella was twice the cost of anything else on their menu.  They have a policy that each diner needs to order an entree. We wanted to order several appetizers and then split the paella. This was apparently the craziest thing they had ever heard from a customer.  As far as appetizers, they were cheap but all tasted very average and everything was very greasy. We also had the ceviche, which was just okay. The paella finally arrived and it was enormous. This could have served 6 people with no appetizers. Obviously, we were upset that they would not let us just split it among 4!  The paella was so gross: it was super salty and the random cuts and parts  of meats and seafood were scattered about like a scene out ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" ... it was not worth $50, a 45 minute wait, and hassle from the server.  We will not be back and I do not recommend this place. It's pretty gross all around.",-0.918,0.783,0.082,0.135,0.472815734989648

Since we were having lunch, I decided upon a sandwich.  I used to live in Orlando and, thanks to its Cuban community, became fond of the Cuban sandwich.  ""I'll get that,"" I thought to myself.  It's gotta be good - after all, it's advertised all over the restaurant (banners reading ""Pan Cubano"" grace the walls).  I ordered it and...they were out of it.  Huh?  You're out of ham, mustard, pickles, bread, cheese and roast pork?  What?  How is that even possible?  It's the trademark sandwich.  Trying to be kind, the waitress told me I could order a jibarito.  Thing is, if I wanted a jibarito, I would be at Boriquen.  I wanted a Cuban sandwich, ergo, I am at Habana Libre!  Seeing that I wasn't biting at the jibarito suggestion, she suggested I order a hot pork dish.  Jigga what?  Rather than asking how and why I should order a hot pork dish when I can't order a hot (pressed) pork sandwich, I decided to chill out and order the chicken steak sandwich.  Eh.  Tasted like Chicken.  Thing is, I didn't take three buses to travel from Lakeview to West Town to eat a &^%*&() chicken sandwich! Trying to end the meal on an up note, I ordered a milkshake for dessert.  I figured, if it worked for Daniel Day-Lewis, I, too, would DRINK YO MILKSHAKE and all would be well.  Well, Danny didn't drink THIS milkshake.  Like I said, I used to live in Florida and know that Cuban milkshakes tend to be sweeter than your standard US milkshakes.  That's why I like them.  They way I have had them, they were served deep-freeze cold and the fruit flavor really popped.  I'd only glanced at the options earlier in the meal but the waitress told me that there were only Banana, Papaya and Mango.  I could have sworn Coconut and/or Chocolate were options as well.  Maybe, maybe not.  Maybe they were out.  I ordered a Banana Mango shake and thought all was well.  I got a glass of yellow milkwater and a straw.  Where was the super cold super sweet treat I remember from Florida?  This was so nasty.  My stomach curdled as I swigged the lukewarm milk.  There were no fruit chunks, no explosion of flavor...only threats from my stomach to make me pay for my folly.  By this time, my face couldn't hide my disgust...but I had to keep pretending like I was drinking because the waitress was giving me a serious side eye.  I felt like Craig in the Malcom in the Middle episode where he is being 'helped' by an evil monkey and the monkey put poison in the milkshake he made for Craig.  The monkey watched as Craig 'drank' it.  That was me!  I was Craig and the waitress...well, it's not nice to call someone an evil monkey so I won't...but she was watching.  I asked for a to-go cup.  I felt guilty throwing the 'milkshake' (if that's what it was; no boys would be coming to the yard for that) away so I decided to freeze it.  Three hours later, it is finally solidifying in my freezer.  I don't know what that liquid is/was. The whole meal ranged from disappointing to nasty.  The only saving grace was I had view of the CUTEST baby who smiled, giggled and drooled at me throughout the meal.  My clock is TICKING!  I need some babies!  Um, that's another review.  In any case, that sweet baby raised this review from a minus 2 star to a 2 star.  He was so cute!!",0.9696,0.785,0.129,0.086,0.6496666666666667

The evening started out promising by arriving to find an appetizer sampler waiting on our table.  The empanadas and the plantains were done to near perfection and our evening was looking up.  Now only if we had something to drink.  Where's the waitress?  Ten minutes pass without seeing any sign of wait staff.  Unfortunately that was a sign of things to come.  We finished our appetizer and had to flag down the only other waitress in the joint to get our server to come take our order.  We were constantly searching for our waitress, who must have gone all the way to Havana to get our food, drinks and other requests.  At least that's the way it seemed from our vantage point.  I was definitely not expecting a 2 hour dining experience on a Wednesday night, and the crowd in the restaurant shouldn't have necessitated such a long wait. As for the food, everything we had was tasty, but not outstanding.  There are much better Cuban options in Chicago, and the portion sizes were more toward the small size.  Overall, if you're in the neighborhood and have the time to spend, you might have a better experience than we did.  Otherwise, stick to the other better options in town for an overall more pleasant dining experience.",0.9871,0.844,0.129,0.027,0.4872222222222223

Frankly, I wasn't *that* impressed by our meal: The ropa vieja and the beef empanadas were kinda salty; the sweet plantains were just a tad undercooked and not caramelized  enough to make them salivatingly delicious (if there is such a term); the chicken-and-potatoes were good, but honest to the G-Man, it tasted exactly like a dish I make at home, and given that I am not Cuban, I feel a little cheated from not having been presented with traditional Cuban dishes.That and having had to pay for something I cooked for myself just a few days before.

There were two servers, so two tables a piece should not have been hard at all. We waited about ten minutes for menus, then we waited another ten minutes for some whater.

We had a few questions about some dishes on the menu, which she answered very vague and left us pretty much with the same questions. We started with the appetizer combination for two. The papa rellena and the croqueta were not all that, I've had better. The empanada was quite tasty though. I loved the fried plantains and the garlicy sauce!! My boyfriend had the shrimp, which he did not find very appealing. I had the pork chops, which I thought were just allright. I loved the white rice and beans you get with dinner. They were extreamly well prepared and quite delicious.  I tried a Cuban soda called Materva and liked that very much as well.  It tastes something like ginger ale. We did not have dessert because we were pretty stuffed and they had already closed the place down and looked like every one wanted to go home. Maybe next time I'll try some flan!

To the main course....the roasted pork had the right amount of cuban spices, came thinly sliced w/ not too much fat.  It was surprisingly moist considering it was roasted.  It came with 3 fried bananas on the side next to a perfect serving of white rice.  In addition, you get a cup of black bean soup (however, I decided to pass since I did not take my Beano....jk). Other main courses to consider are the fried pork, which comes with the same sides as the roasted.  The fried pork will melt in your mouth. Also, try the 25 min seafood soup.  It's not really called that but it takes that long to prepare.  It's definitely worth the wait.  Go get a bottle of wine down the street while you wait for it.  By the time you come back it'll be ready!  Soup is jam packed with flavor as well as all the seafood you could imagine.  Definitely a must have!

It seems like most places around here figure they can cut corners on flavor and ingredients because relatively few people will actually notice. I found Habana Libre to be a refreshing change to this trend. The food was great, and there was a ton of it, all cooked perfectly. The yuca was awesome, and had enough enough garlic to stun a goat- in other words, it was just as it should be. The service wasn't superb, but then maybe they're just going for even more authenticity, I couldn't really tell.

GOD. you know how some things are like crack they are so good? well, this garlic sauce is one of those things. we went through 2 little containers. they brought garlic bread out too, which was SO good and garlicky (see a trend of garlic here?) i got garlic shrimp - not to impressed. it was good, but i wouldn't order it again. leigh got the fried chicken legs, the looked AMAZING and dan had a ropa veija (sp??) sambo. a second bottle of wine was purchased as well as a tall boy of king cobra....dan's classy. leigh and dan ate some flan. i was too stuffed with garlic, bread and wine to even want a taste...but they said it was good. all in all, a very nice time in a nice place near my apartment. i'll be back for sure!",0.9949,0.748,0.214,0.038,0.6155555555555556

2006-10-27,5.0,"As a Cuban-American I have to say I was pretty estatic when I saw Habana Libre pop up in my neighborhood.  I was extra happy when I saw the prices which are totally reasonable.   When my fiance and I went there I was overwhelmed with decision.  I hadn't had Cuban food in a while and I couldn't figure out what to get.  We finally settled on sharing The Cuban Sandwich (a true test for any cuban restaurant), rice and beans, sweet plantains, tostones, and papa relleno. I have to admit that the cuban sandwich was only average.  The bread they used was just Italian bread and not cuban bread like I'm used to in Tampa.  The rice and beans were the best I have ever had, hands down.  The sweet plantains were really good and the tostones were too.  The garlic oil is VERY galic-y so watch out if you aren't ready.  The papa relleno, which is my favorite Cuban treat, was huge and not fried long enough.  very sad. On another try to Habana Libre I had the Jibarito sandwich.  Um....this is the most delicious sandwich I've ever had in my life.  Instead of bread they use fried plantains.   Yeah, you read that right - fried plantains.   It's a steak sandwich with tomatoes and lettuce.   If you don't eat mean, its worth asking for extra tomatoes and losing the steak.  It's that good.    * * This place is WAY better than Cafe Bolero on Western Ave.  It's cheaper and more authentic.",0.9898,0.776,0.187,0.037,0.5660032242063493
2006-10-03,4.0,"i have to disagree with everything this other cat said except the fact that it is byob.  there were maybe 3 or 4 other tables occupied when i went and there were two servers.  they were attentive and very friendly.  our meal lasted a while as well because there was a rain storm outside and honestly i didn't want to leave.  i had boiled yuca, a half roasted chicken cooked cuban style and rice and beans (came with dinner).  i lived in puerto rico for a spell and this was the best yuca i have had outside of pr.  also the best rice and beans.  i wish they had offered my a choice of red or black though, that is probably the only reason i didnt give habana libre a 5.  i live around the corner and plan on being there often.  as for bolero, don't believe the hype, too much pretention.  bonsai.",0.9518,0.837,0.137,0.025,0.44687499999999997
2006-09-12,2.0,"This is in the location formerly known as Playa del Mar.  The food is pretty good, and the service was ok - considering one server was handling the entire restaurant.  Our meal took over 2 hours - and the food's really not that complicated.  It's BYOB for now, and our server was very nice and offered to put our beers in the cooler for us.  It was very hard to get her attention when we wanted anything, such as another beer, appetizers, dinner, or the check.  Maybe they'll work out the scheduling issues soon.  Until then, it's good because it's BYOB, but I prefer Cafe Bolero on Western, which has better food, service, and atmosphere.",0.8793,0.875,0.114,0.011,0.5560897435897437
