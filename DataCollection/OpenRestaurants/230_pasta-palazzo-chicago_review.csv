On Tuesday night, my husband and I were going there for dinner and arrived around 7:30. There was a 20-25 minute wait. The hostess was short and not very friendly. We asked her if we could order a glass of wine while we waited for our table. She practically threw the drink menu at us and walked away (never returning). Then we asked if we could sit at the bar (as it's usually first come first serve) and her response was there's only one chair. When we found two chairs together she scolded us like children, with aggressive arm gestures, saying there was a wait and we can't just sit wherever we want.

I really liked how you could see your dish being prepared since the stove for preparing dishes was behind the counter. The bread here was nothing special, but I really enjoyed the grilled calamari because of the simplicity in preparation and the fact it was properly cooked.  It was not rubbery whatsoever and the char marks added great complexity of flavor. My main dish was the jalapeno gnocchi with sausage.  The spice wasn't overwhelming and I'd say it was more of a small kick, which was great because the heat didn't take away from the flavors.  The gnocchi is homemade too, which made it taste even better.  The texture and taste from the dish overall was extremely good and I can see why so many people recommend this dish.  I highly recommend getting the sausage because the added fat and flavor of the meat really tie things together.

My meal came and I took a few bites only the find out I was given plain noodles with olive oil just sprinkled on top.  It was for the most part plain and dry.  Trying to make my situation better and thinking nothing of it, I asked the server if I could have a cup of red sauce on the side to add to my meal, since the initial sauce was not what I was told it would be.  The server then came back and told me I would be $5 for a cup on the side..... Seriously?!?! A $9 pasta which had virtually no type of sauce in the first place was then going to cost me $5 for a few spoonfuls of sauce?  I could buy a whole jar for less than that.   This really ruined my experience and I find it to be petty.  I don't know if this is the protocol or typical or if the server was mistaken.  I probably will not be back.  This is so unfortunate I had high hopes for my meal!",0.7056,0.863,0.078,0.059,0.4076190476190475

Going in ordered a small Caesar salad(deluding myself into being 'healthy') along with the jalapeno gnocchi, which seemed like a fan favorite. Very polarized. The Caesar salad just had so much dressing when I got it, it was hard to finish. As in, I didn't finish it. That aside, the jalapeno gnocchi was delicious. Incredibly fluffy pieces of home-made gnocchi tossed in a deliciously savory red pepper sauce that I'd like to pour on all my pastas. They're filled with a bit of ricotta too, so when you bite into these pillows you get fluffy inside fluffy. The portion size isn't that large for what you're paying($11), but the quality was arguably worth it.

The restaurant is fairly small with the kitchen in the dining area, so some tables have a good view of their food being prepared. Everyone in our party agreed that the food was just okay and the menu options pretty bland, things we could have fairly easily made at home ourselves. That said, they came at a value, priced at $10-12 a plate. My biggest complaint was that most of the dishes were vegetarian, but some people are into that, I guess.  I ordered one of the specials, the seafood risotto with broccoli. It came with some shrimp and scallops, but wasn't anything to write home about. The best dish I sampled was the jalapeño gnocchi, which was stuffed with ricotta. It had very little spice, just enough to taste it but no more. It would have been amazing if we had added sausage to it. Not sure if they allow that. We also ordered garlic bread and bruschetta as appetizers. They were also good, but not great.

2016-11-18,4.0,"My favorite thing about this place is how consistent they are. I've been too many times to count being that I'm a DePaul alumni who used to live near it and I can truthfully say every time it was spot on. Some favorites of mine are the regular and jalapeno gnocchi, both equally delicious. Aside from the food which is pretty spot on the service can be hit or miss. Typically you'll get a friendly server but it may take a while for them to get to you. It's a pretty small place so typically they have one or two people taking care of everyone which can be a lot to handle, so just be patient. Food and service aside, the atmosphere is pretty amazing! The restaurant has a pretty vibrant color scheme and it truly feels like a warm and cozy setting. They also typically have some good tunes on as well. The size of the restuarant can cause it to get pretty loud during a busy dinner service but that's something you really can't control. Price-wise, this place offers great value. A super filling pasta dish will run you about 10 bucks which is pretty rare for good Italian and especially good considering its location on the wonderfully pretentious Armitage street.  Perfect for date nights or family gatherings, you should give this place a shot. Especially if you're a semi broke DePaul student trying to impress a date haha.",0.9985,0.649,0.335,0.016,0.6322874493927126

Go here any night of the week and check out the specials written on the chalk board. I guarantee you won't be disappointed! You can also carry out.

Whether you're craving for authentic Italian food or just a rich meal, this place should be sitting at number One on your list. The food is five star for a very affordable price. The restaurant has special menu for everyday and some are worth trying. We tried plenty, and Jalapeño gnocchi is one must-try dish - it just WOW! Gnocchi is as soft as pillows and just melt in your mouth. The portion isn't crazily big, but rest assured that you're getting what you pay for because each bite is a piece of heaven itself. And yes, the food is great and you can make it even better as you like it by tweaking the food in any way you want. They have always been very accommodating with customer's special order. If you drop by at dinner, make sure to order some cocktail to go along with your superb meal. Bread are provided free of charge but nothing is spectacular about it, just the typical chewy white bread.

The staff didn't blink an eye, they were absolutely fantastic with us even when we had to change tables, they immediately accommodated us and the service was great. We shared appetizers, calamari- delicious, small portion, Bruscetta- very fresh tomatoes and the sauce was amazing along w the bread, and baked goat cheese, if you like goat cheese, it's amazing, it comes in a tomato sauce with toasted garlic bread, kind of bland, but not terrible. We split a large Cesar salad, the greens were very fresh, but the dressing was a bit bland, it was still good, just not great.  My BF ordered the seafood pasta in a red sauce, the seafood was very fresh and well season, the pasta was great. I ordered the gnocchi with Gorgonzola sauce, The menu doesn't say that any veggies come with it, just the plain pasta, but when I asked if veggies could be added, the server said I could add whatever I wanted, it was a large group ordering, so as not to hold it up I only ordered mushrooms, but if I would have know that anything could go in the gnocchi, so it would be very helpful if that were listed on the menu or even offer a wider selection of gnocchi dishes. And I wasn't a huge fan of the Gorgonzola sauce, you can choose between about 10 other sauces, but it was a little overwhelming on the menu and I didn't know what would go best, so that's my fault for ordering it.  I was surprised by how small the portions seemed, the price point is pretty affordable, but I finished my plate and I was still hungry, and that never happens when I east pasta.

My pasta was supposed to have a cream sauce but it tasted like there was nothing on it.  The kids liked the open kitchen and getting to watch the food being cooked.  It was loud so when my kids got loud they weren't out of place.  They also really liked the painting on the walls.",0.9177,0.814,0.144,0.042,0.7011111111111112

2016-02-24,5.0,This place is amazing ! I came here with my partner on Valentine's Day. We got there and as soon as we walked in we were seated which was awesome for it being a holiday.  We sat up front on the counter by the cooks.  We started off with a caesar salad w/ shrimp. It was very good. The shrimp added an extra flavor to the salad. It's a must have.  She ended up getting the special of the day which was heart shaped raviolis ( cute!) and I order the jalapeño gnocchi .... Both dishes were great in taste and it was lots of food!  The sauces for both dishes were very good! We were really impressed by the food and prices! Who doesn't love a cheap dinner !?

2016-02-16,5.0,"Love the food these guys serve! Me and my wife ordered Bruschetta, Linguini Pesto, Gnocchi with spicy vodka tomato sauce. We really felt like the food was very authentic. Gnocchi was so soft and the feeling was very tasty. Gnocchi melts as soon as you put it on your tongue. Linguini Pesto with generous amount of pesto sauce makes the perfect bite. Great service and really nice people.  The only criticism was that the Bruschetta was very sour because the balsamic that was mixed with tomatoes makes the whole combination way too sour. Balsamic glaze should be used to balance the sweet + sour profile but I think there was only balsamic vinegar used instead. That's my only negative comment. But again, compared to the other great food/drinks we received, this negative point is very very minor.  Thank you Pasta Palazzo for the great food. I think we found our favorite Italian restaurant!",0.971,0.734,0.2,0.066,0.5496

The only downside, and it's just a factor of logistics, is the seating close to the bathrooms in the back.  The restaurant is small and if you have to sit at the tables in the rear, there may be an odor coming from the bathroom that is less than pleasing and can alter your dining experience, if you know what I mean.  So, if all the tables toward the front of the restaurant are taken, opt for the counter seating, which offers a chance to watch your food being prepared.  Highly recommend this restaurant.",0.9713,0.817,0.17,0.013,0.590654761904762

It's pasta, it shouldn't be that expensive. Pasta Palazzo puts a more casual twist on it with friendly servers and good prices. I got the jalapeno stuffed dumplings with roasted red pepper puree and added sundried tomatoes. It was incredible, I'd get it in a heartbeat. I didn't feel overly full at the end and I cleaned my plate - everything about the dish was great. There was some heat to it, but not too powerful. The gnocchi was good, but the sauce was the highlight. That roasted red pepper puree was superb.

It was flavorful and filling with tons of shrimp and calamari. My friend had the penne con salsicce which was another great dish full of sausage and portabella mushrooms. The portions were great and the entrees were relatively cheap compared to other italian places near by. We also shared the calamari as an appetizer. It was perfectly grilled but there were only for large pieces. I thought they could have given us more for the price we paid.  The place itself is pretty small but very inviting. I wouldn't bring a huge group here though. I appreciated how clean the chefs were in preparing their meals, but with an open kitchen you kind of have to be. Overall, a really great place for a great price. I'll definitely be back soon!",0.9911,0.764,0.223,0.013,0.5730654761904762

I got a glass of wine as well which was also ""eh"" but honestly what you come here for is the pasta. I think they would benefit from becoming a BYOB actually.  Anyway, for entree I got the Jalapeno Gnocchi because it was one of the highlights on Yelp for this place. Very good, and reminds me of the Jalapeno Gnocchi from Twist (a tapas place in Wrigley). My boyfriend got the Tortellini and I thought it was better than the Jalapeno Gnocchi. It was heartier and more filling. Bolognese was flavorful and the alfredo mixed in with marinara added a creaminess that was delicious.  I will definitely go again as I live in the neighborhood.

There was only 2 waiters and the tiny restaurant was almost at capacity. Waited 15 minutes for a menu. Waiter was sweating and gasping for air after running from table to table! We waited at least 15 minutes before getting a menu. Waiter never introduced himself or told us about the specials. We ordered the peso pasta that was described with a splash of cream. Unfortunately, it was more like a pool of cream and so it killed the flavor. I ordered the risotto con broccoli and pollo in a sundried tomato sauce. The risotto was super heavy with cream! The chicken looked and tasted like it came out of a package  like Tyson or Perdue! There was a few pieces of broccoli drowned with the cream sauce. The seafood pasta was ok and the spicy eggplant was good, but super heavy on the sauce! The bread was cold, not fresh. I ordered coffee and although the taste was good, it was cold!  Forgot to mention that the phone was ringing off the hook the whole time we ate there, but I never saw anyone answer!  Wished we would have eaten somewhere else :(.  Maybe they will read this review and cut back on the cream and sauce.

I was looking for some fresh pasta while roaming the streets of Chicago. Pulled out the phone, dialed up the Yelp app, and searched for ""Fresh Pasta"". This place popped up. I skimmed some reviews and started walking. A few (ok, probably closer to 20) blocks later, I had arrived! The restaurant is very charming. It's small, and cute, and fun, and smells super yummy. It's everything you want it to be. I sat at the counter and began my journey of Lunchification. I first survey my surroundings. It's an open kitchen which I love. There is one chef cooking up tasty treats for all. He what looks like a 30 gallon pot up there stewing with marinara sauce. He moves about with effortless efficiency. That whole place could be sat at the same time and he wouldn't break a sweat, would cook everything perfectly, and would have it out fast. I swear.. it's worth the price to come here JUST to sit at the counter and watch this master cook. I was mesmerized.... I spotted the daily special menu. Pumpkin Ravioli? YUP! I'll have that!  Also ordered up some gahlic bread, and a side of Marinara. OMG! OMG! OMG!  The marinara sauce is SOOO FREAKING GOOD!!!!!!! Is this what you Chicago folks get to deal with every day? LUCKY!!!!  So yeah... That marinara was exceptional to say the least.  I ordered some Tomato dill soup and was surprised to watch him cook that up. It wasn't in a pot waiting around. He cooked it fresh to order! I had been watching and I saw him start a new dish and as the cream and stock and veggies went in I slowly realized this was my soup. IN about 2 mnutes he was done, I had my soup and ohhh man.. It was soooo goood!!!  I wish I had ordered a gallon of it! The Punkin Ravioli with browned butter sage sauce was up next. I was super excited about this. I love punkin dishes in the early fall!  This one did not disappoint. Fresh hand made pasta stuffed with a soft fresh pumpkin filling. Quick saute'd in a brown butter sauce with fresh sage. wow....  Sooo good. All told, I should have stayed longer and ate more. No telling when i'll find this good of pasta or Italian food again.

The restaurant itself is also super-cute.  I always described it as an Italian diner, due to the size, and the counter, and so on, but the bright decor is much nicer than that description would make you think.  It's also kind of fun to see sudden bursts of flame as the cooking goes on not far from your table.  The waitstaff varies, of course, but I never had any problems, and some of the servers were very nice and attentive.",0.9747,0.849,0.128,0.023,0.5708641975308643

It came PACKED with grilled eggplant, peppers, zucchini, spinach, broccoli, tomatoes and basil in tomato white wine sauce. I do wish a dish labeled ""healthy"" had the whole-grain pasta automatically, instead of charging extra for it.  By the time I was finished, it didn't even look like I touched my plate. Although that may have had something to do with the complicated slices of bread, which had the perfect combo of crispy crust surrounding the super soft insides.  The sangria was also very good (it tasted of a drier red wine), filled with an assortment of fresh fruit.  Everyone was super friendly, from the busy, busy waitress to the cashier. We were left waiting for our checks a little longer than we had wanted, but that might have been because our plates were all pretty full. No matter. The waitress was nice enough to bag up our food, which we had offered to do ourselves.  We were sitting at a table the farthest from the entrance, which means closest to the bathrooms.

It's a casual spot, where you don't really spend a lot of time lingering, since the waitresses are really quick at seating, getting your order and bringing your food out to you. The space only fits about 20 people, so I guess their fast pace is useful in keeping business going. It smells like pasta heaven when you walk in and you get bread on arrival (for free, yay). If you don't order the conchiglie with the ricotta, don't even walk in. It's to die for! It's extremely decadent and rich but worth every calorie. I've always been so full from the bread and pasta, I've never had dessert, but they always look pretty good. The jalapeno gnocchi is pretty good, as it's different, but I'm more of a cheese fiend and this place gets it right. It used to be cash only but they got their act together, so you don't have to worry about that anymore. The prices are affordable, but I feel like they went up recently which is a little frustrating since the food is great, but the ingredients are not anything exquisite or fancy.

BUT...When my husband and I visited Chicago we reseached resturants online and came across pasta palazzo and wanted to try it. When we got there immediatly we did not like how small of a space there was. We sat at a four top table but our table connected to another table where two people sat and ate their dinner, so it was like we were eating our dinner with strangers because the tables are together. Our waitress started to take our order and in the middle of my husband ordering his food she cut him off to greet the customers coming in when another waitress was already in front of them greeting them, i thought that was rude. I had the bow tie alfredo and added chicken it was AMAZING, we want to make a trip back just for the food. When you sit down you get bread and they have oil and pepper at the table for dipping.

If you are looking for anything other than pasta, including even lasagna, you are out of luck. Word to the wise, order from the homemade menu. You won't be disappointed. The Gnocchi is frankly gluttonous, but worth it. I also like that Pasta Palazzo has healthy options like whole wheat pasta and a lighter red sauce. However, you will come to dislike your Pasta Palazzo experience if you are in mixed company ordering from the healthy and unhealthy menu. The groans of enjoyment from the other side of the table will kill your appetite for your healthy pasta.

I once watched them make it and saw the cook pour a whole lot of heavy cream into the pan. But it's more than that - the gorgonzola gives it an earthy funk, which makes it stand out from any alfredo sauce. It tastes a little toasted too, like what happens when pasta sticks to a pan, even though there's no crunchy bits. The gnocchi is plump and chewy.

It's a small space and can get kind of noisy. It's a pretty casual atmosphere. Most the tables are high, and there is a long counter/bar along one side. There isn't a lot of space for waiting for tables; if you're seated in front people might get all up in your business while they wait. This is a table service spot, and the staff seems pretty nice and efficient. They serve alcohol (at least wine, I didn't really look closely). Now to the fun stuff. The food is really darn good! We shared the baked goat cheese and grilled asparagus appetizers and they were both excellent! For my dinner I ordered one of the specials of the day: a risotto with chicken, broccoli, mushrooms in sun-dried tomato cream sauce. It was delicious! Super tasty.

There is nothing particularly authentic about Pasta Palazzo, but it never pretends to be anything but a pasta bar that dishes out fresh, delicious creations featuring pasta (and sometimes risotto).  My personal favorite is farafelle with goat cheese and pine nuts.  My daughter (who begs us to drive to Lincoln Park to eat here, long after our move north) is more traditional with penne and marinara.  My husband longs for the jalapeno gnocchi, which I would agree is spicy and delicious.  Also delicious are the salads and the asparagus appetizer.   Very simple food done very well. The only drawbacks are the lack of dining space, sometimes leading to long waits and uncomfortable seating, as well as occasionally pokey service.  However, it is worth it for a place that is consistently good and loved by our consensus-challenged family.   One note: dine at the counter on a cold day, unless you don't sweat.",0.991,0.739,0.219,0.042,0.6245535714285714

The place is SO LOUD- the 1st time we called we were hung up on because  they couldn't hear us yelling. The 2nd time we called they got the order wrong when they repeated it back...bad sign. We corrected them and were quoted 15 min for pickup. We ordered an appetizer and two entrees. The appetizer (Polenta) was the highlight. Creamy, cheesy-delicious. The entrees....eh. We ordered the gnocchi in bolognese sauce. I've never had mushrooms in my bolognese before, but theirs had them and J's allergic. We didn't notice it on the menu since next to the gnocchi it doesn't describe the sauces- just says to pick. There were more mushrooms than gnocchi. However, the texture was pretty good, light and pillow-y.  The worst part-I ordered the pasta primavera, with whole grain pasta and goat cheese (and paid $2 extra for that). We got it home and it wasn't whole grain and there was no goat cheese. Plus, the veggies were lackluster- some were still crunchy.  We called back and complained. They refunded our money for the messed up primavera but I think this experience has made me want to stay away from Pasta Palazzo in the future.",-0.7935,0.859,0.058,0.083,0.48970588235294116

Balance of creamy and chalky, as it should be, but didn't stand out. Ordered 3 entrees because we couldn't decide. Jalapeño gnocchi was a total surprise.

The best was the penne salsiccia - perfectly done penne with well-grilled bits of sausage. Nice spice, great flavor, and tons of meat. Only knock is the wine list - pretty basic. But with a restaurant so small yet reasonably priced, not sure I should expect much more than they offered. We enjoyed our malbec. Server Jeff was attentive and friendly.

We awkwardly stood waiting for awhile until someone acknowledged us and told us to sit down.

We probably sat at least ten minutes with no one acknowledging us and that we were ready to order... finally they got there and we had brief interactions related to what we wanted to order. The bruschetta was very good - you could definitely taste the balsamic vinegar. We decided to split one of the specials of the day which was only OK - seemed very basic and something I can whip up at home. Their portion sizes are gigantic, so if you don't feel like eating a few pounds of pasta, I would definitely suggest sharing - or actually, I wouldn't, because I don't recommend this place.

I ordered the penne fungi, three types of mushrooms in a creamy cheese Marsala sauce. the pasta cooked to a perfect al dente, mushrooms all had great texture, but the rub was the flavor. perhaps in the attempt to allow the freshness of the ingredients shine, the cook skipped the extra pinch of salt. marsala is not a strong flavor like a traditional alfredo, so a little extra seasoning would have set this dish of well.  my guy ordered the penne con salsiccie, that's with chunks of Italian sausage, portabellas and tomato sauce. no lacking of flavor on this dish. we enjoyed the experience. portions are generous without being overwhelming.  we'll be back.",0.9288,0.757,0.178,0.065,0.5588235294117647

She said the staff had been watching him because he didn't look like their regular clientele, ordered only hot tea, talked on his cell phone the entire time he was in the restaurant, and kept reaching into his jacket pocket. Of course he kept reaching into his ""pocket""--he was actually reaching under his jacket and my jacket to go into my purse!

The pumpkin ravioli was a very interesting experience... almost felt like a dessert and I happily ate every piece. My friends smoked chicken was just okay, we couldn't figure it out but it just tasted a little fake and off.   The service was great but a couple of things strongly limited our experience to three stars. First, even though the food was decent, my friend and I did not even come close to getting full (might be because the specials are smaller portions?) and I needed to stop on the way home to get something else to fill me up. Second, I ordered some green tea after our meal and was presented with Lipton's green tea (the type you see for at the grocery store that costs next to nothing).

The combination of the gnocchi and Gorgonzola sauce is enough to send me to another world. The sauce is outstanding. They also have a marinara, bolognese, or alfredo sauce to choose from. Pasta Palazzo also offers many other delicious entrees for those who cannot handle the richness of the Gorgonzola sauce and gnocchi.

We probably should have just ordered for carry out like the other smart people walking in there to pick up their dinner but so be it... At least the lady working the register gave me a Dr.Pepper (yes! DP is served here!) to quench my thirst while we waited. I had a hard time figuring out what I wanted to eat since the menu is full of some great options but thanks to a fellow Yelper's suggestion I went with the jalapeno gnocchi with the red pepper puree. No disappointments there! The gnocchi is homemade and stuffed with a ricotta and jalapeno mixture. It has a sort of kick to it because of the jalapeno flavor but yet it wasn't spicy which I almost missed since I love spicy. But the red pepper puree sauce can't be beat, it has a perfect consistency and lots of flavor. My friend ordered the risotto with calamari special and she was in carbohydrate heaven. I had a bite and couldn't put my finger on what it was but there was some magical flavor in there. Sage? Rosemary? Oregano? I don't know what it was, but keep it up PP. I'll be back soon to try one of your cheesy cream sauce dishes...they look heavenly.",0.9898,0.806,0.152,0.041,0.507703081232493

That being said, I will confess that I have eaten at Pasta Palazzo about once every 2-3 weeks since I moved to Lincoln Park.  The menu offers really great comfort food, and an even more comforting price. I usually opt for one of the specials of the day to keep my life exciting, but my super picky-only pizzia eating-roommate absolutely swears by the conchiglie gorgonzola. The decor is bright and fun, and the service is always good. I would, however, recommend going on a week day, as the small space can get backed up pretty quickly.

I'm a regular for several reasons. 1) Hands down, this place has the best service I've ever received.  The waitstaff and hostess greet everyone who enters with a genuine smile and a kind hello. The service is swift, the portions are generous, and every customer is genuinely appreciated.   2) The show. I highly recommend sitting at the bar and watching the amazing chefs cook your fresh pasta right before your very eyes.  These guys have their routine choreographed beautifully. It's like watching Pasta Ballet.  3) The food. Fresh & tasty ingredients, skillful execution. They rotate a few specials every day, but I usually stick to the Healthy Scallops, seared and served over fettuccine, topped by a zesty basil tomato sauce. ""Healthy"" is a dubious claim, but it is one of the few dishes that doesn't use a cream sauce.  Their grilled calamari appetizer is hands down the best Cephalopod I've ever had, served with a divine butter lemon sauce and fresh tomatoes.  People seem to adore their bolognese sauce (particularly with the homemade gnocchi), and I like it a lot, but it is quite heavy, with chunky mushrooms and hearty ground beef.  4) The drinks. Delicious red sangria with fresh citrus fruit chunks. 5) Atmosphere. Unpretentious, contemporary, fun. The restaurant is sunny, airy, and open. It is hard to believe this unassuming little pasta joint is located in this neighborhood, where trendy & high-concept businesses are the status quo.

The only complaint I had was it seemed like the waitress wasn't paying enough attention and forgot some requests when the orders were placed and one of our party had to wait a little while for the shrimp to be added to his salad.  We had to request refills and more bread which is something I really think should be just done and monitored while walking around the place.  It's not that big so there really wasn't much of an excuse.  I might be being hard on them, but, yeah, it had to be said. For you wino's out there, they have a liquor license, but allow BYO but charge a lot more than they should for it.  $10 for a bottle seems a bit ridic but, I guess people gotta do what they gotta do.  I would never BYO here because of that.",0.971,0.844,0.134,0.022,0.5274943310657596

Wow, it was just fantastic.   The jalapeño gnocchi was served in a roasted red pepper sauce that was at the same time light (not thin) but substanitive.  The flavors where all distinct but none overpowering.  They also managed to maintain all of the pepper flavor with none of the heat.  I'm getting so worked up as I write this that I may jump on the brown line and go by myself this afternoon. The service was fast and friendly, though inexperienced, and the kitchen is open.  If you sit at the bar you can watch every step of your being food prepared.  The only downside is the size.  I was with a large group and it was a little tight.

Buck up and deal with paying all of your taxes so we, the customer, can resume life as King and pay however we damn well please.

It's a shame PP that your dishes aren't less tasty, then I wouldn't mind if I never saw your Uncle Sam evading face again. Sadly, that is not the case... I love your quaint intimate surroundings with communal tables and open kitchen where I can see my dishes prepared as I sip on a juice glass of Cabernet. You are especially warm and welcoming in the winter when I can sit by your window watching the snow fall and passers-by beside a steamy bowl of pasta. Your appetizers, especially the baked goat cheese and grilled asparagus with lemon vinaigrette, are generous and wildly tasty. Then, of course, there is your pasta...  Take a tip from me and do not order off the PP 'healthy pasta' list. Pasta is not intended to be dietetic and you won't enjoy heaping mouthfuls of tasteless, bland pasta bathed in a lackluster sauce. Go for the rich complexity of the jalapeno gnocchi or penne alla melanzane with a spicy marinara, eggplant, buffalo mozzarella and fresh basil.

2007-07-12,4.0,"You can't get more bang for your buck than Pasta Palazzo!  Fresh, homemade pastas right in front of your eyes- all under $10!   The food itself definitely deserves a five star rating.  I've tried the appetizers (love the goat cheese!), many different pastas, the meatballs and the vegetables.  Everything I've had there has been fantastic, and I've been there on multiple occasions.  They have this one pasta there which I refer to as cheesy chicken goodness- I swear, I dream about it! The restaurant itself is super cute, but it can get super crowded, especially on weekends.  They have long, high tables so you might end up sitting with strangers.  It's very busy, with the crowd, and the pasta cooked in front of you, so I was forced to take off a star for the ambiance.",0.9144,0.823,0.139,0.038,0.6025814536340852
2007-07-12,5.0,"I work close to Pasta, and I can not count the number of times I have been here for lunch (and dragged my friends here on the weekend), and I enjoy it every time.  For a while, I was sticking close to the pasta selections (which are all delicious) but then one of my co-workers encouraged me to try the vegetarian sandwich, and I haven't gone back to pasta dishes since!  Fresh grilled vegetables and goat cheese and some other stuff that is just so yummy.... Also, it helps with the not falling asleep post carb-heavy lunch!  (And if you want an alternative to the bread/oil/cheese which is so hard to resist while waiting for food, the asparagus appetizer is quite good) In addition to the great (and reasonably priced) food the service is great, and they are always willing to change the order slightly if you want, (e.g. light cream, extra pine nuts, etc.).   Just make sure you have cash (but there is a citibank across the street if you need an atm) as they don't take credit cards.  Take out is also super quick and convenient.",0.9838,0.77,0.182,0.048,0.5522875816993463

I've got a little rotation of dishes that I normally order - cavatappi pollo, gnocchi or ravioli (both marinara and Bolognese sauces are yummy) - and all of those get 2 thumbs up. Just tried the goat cheese appetizer last week and it was heavenly (totally agree w/ Natalie R!) But my advice is to resist the urge to eat bread and olive oil beforehand if you decide to order that dish ;) CARB OVERLOAD! Cash only, but all of the entrees are $10 or less.

2007-01-20,5.0,"Pasta Palazzo is a cute and quick Italian restaurant that serves delicious pasta and sandwich fare. The alfredo is to die for and they also have a ""healthy"" section featuring vegetable pastas cooked without butter or cheese. Even the bread and oil are delicious! Often the specials are quite good as well, featuring seafood, fish or other meats.   For beverages, they have a small selection of affordable wines and beers and a few house wines for about $5 a glass. They also have RC cola, which I love. The prices are very cheap (on average less than $10) and portions are large. The ambiance is a perfect balance between colorful walls and quiet sounds.
