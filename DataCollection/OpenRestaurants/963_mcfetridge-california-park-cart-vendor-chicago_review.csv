He calles it icecream, I call it Italian Ice...not sure but it's freakin addicitve.  He only carries 3 flavors- Lime, Coconut and Strawberry. He says it's home made (I beleive it from the unbeleivable fresh taste and fresh little lime pulp which I LOVE) and all natural. (well except the food coloring obviously used in the lime and strawberry kind). You can tell it is made with ice and not milk, so I wouldn't call it icecream....but it is hands down the best thing I have ever tasted. $1.50 gets you two scoops in a cup. Feel free to have a scoop of two different flavors..he has no problem doing that, and I do it often. I combine the lime and coconut (sing with me...""you put the lime in the coconut and you drink it all up""....oh never mind) which in my opinion is the BEST way to enjoy both flavors.  There was a point that I was going there EVERY DAY...and all my kids are hooked too.  HAVE TO TRY IT OUT. He is very clean, polite, and speaks english really well. (since I always have a hard time telling most vendors what I want in my VERY broken, almost non existant spanish) I actually like the way he makes the corn too. The corn was exceptionally very good. He usually comes out later in the day, like after 2pm and is always parked in the same spot. He drives a white pontiac minvan, so I always get excited when I drive down california and see him. I've done some weird manuvers to get to him too.  (I also like the fact, that nothing looks gross and like he's been walking the streets for 20 hours before I got to him) Try him out.",0.9955,0.757,0.199,0.043,0.43027720027720023
