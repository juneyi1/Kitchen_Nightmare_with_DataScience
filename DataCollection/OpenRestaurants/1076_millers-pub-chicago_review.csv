2017-09-03,3.0,"I think that I am being generous with 3 stars. I ordered an O'Hare Stout and BBQ chicken wings (to go)...the wings were expensive..$12.00+.  When I got home I discovered that they were ""Buffalo Wings"" and not the BBQ wings which was disappointing.  I had ordered the BBQ as this place boasts about their BBQ specialties and fried chicken on the menu. The first team member Darren was really interesting and told me about the history of the place...which brags that Harry Caray and Bill Veeck as well a Jimmy Durante used to frequent the establishment. Darren stated that Harry Caray and Bill Veeck would hand out complimentary tickets to patrons when they were eating at the restaurant.  There is even a ""Bill Veeck"" wall of pictures some autographed by famous baseball players. The odd thing is that the couple sitting at the bar right next to Bill Veeck section asked a portly bartender with short brown hair if he could change the TV channel near them from Football to The Cubs Game and the bartender abruptly stated that he would not and told them...""Go ask the manager.""  Really....how rude and odd considering the place oozes of baseball.....I am sure Harry Caray would be rolling over in his grave if they knew about this.......

It was such a blessing to be able to go to a nice restaurant like this!  They made a great cup of coffee--which I really needed!  I also fell in love with their ""egg lemon rice"" soup--which also has a Greek name.  I don't go downtown very often these days. After Summer Dance this Sunday we went to Miller's Pub. The place still has a lot of charm. The coffee is still great. The egg lemon rice soup wasn't on the menu :(   I asked the waitress about it. She said you have to ask about the soup and they happened to have some that night.  So I was able to have a cup :) and it is still great!  I ordered the Beer battered cod sandwich--it was not great--just okay. I liked the coleslaw but the fries were not very good. My favorite soup saved the meal for me! I suggested this place, so I hoped my friend liked her meal. She had the Broiled Salmon with mushrooms and rice. I asked her about it for this review:  ""Minimally, but perfectly seasoned.  Just about licked the plate clean"".  It is nice when your friends enjoy the place you picked.  It got very busy shortly after we arrived and it was difficult to get the waitress' attention.  Also, Ladies room is small and rather clumsy. If there is a line, you have to watch so you don't clunk someone with the door--or get clunked! Still love this place and hope to be back soon.",0.9949,0.752,0.203,0.045,0.5767132867132867

Fries were hot - nothing to rave about but they were good. The one thing that disappointed me was that a bar, with a great selection of wine, beer and spirits, did not have Malibu rum. I had a taste for Malibu and pineapple juice - waitress came back and said no Malibu - mainly spiced rums on the list. Malibu is a staple in most bars - it's nothing fancy but with the selection of bottles behind the bar, it is surprising they did not have it. Ended up ordering a strawberry daiquiri that was not great. It was not frozen - more of a mix of melted ice and base.

Every time I've been here, it's been nearly impossible to find a spot at the bar. The last visit, there were no less than 4 booths with reserved signs on them and yet it was after 10pm and highly unlikely that these tables were being saved for people looking for dinner. I take a star away because last time when I asked the server about the status of the reserved tables, I was told very rudely that some people want to eat. In my mind, I'm thinking and some people want a tip; which I would give you if I were allowed to sit at this table and an empty table equals zero tip. The cocktails seem pretty standard. A few beers on tap, full bar, but I don't recall ever being given a drink menu.  The bar is made up of a lot of hotel staying folks from around the corner so it's a mixed bag of locals and tourists/business travelers. Bartenders have been pretty attentive.

Then 5 minutes later she runs back with my soup and literally runs away again.  My hubby never finished giving his order.   So finally,  crazy runs back with a salad for me and he said to her,  ""I never finished my order and you ran away"" "" she said "" well I was nervous and needed to get your order in"" and he said ""that's fine but I'd like to order a salad and find out what the cod comes with "".  She said"" well you get what you get and you have to pay extra for a salad'.

The BBQ pork was tasty, but there was so little of it on the bun that it wasn't worth the cost.  The fries were cold, but OK.  The cole slaw was fine too.

If you love Chicago, you have to come to Miller's at least once in your life. I don't think the inside of this place has ever changed, and that's a good thing.  For the city, Miller's has great prices. Of course they have delicious food, it's why they've been open so long. Come here for the soup, lamb, and steak. The prime rib sandwich for lunch is one of my favorites. I always find it weird that the bread and butter come out cold. Guess they ain't got time for that. I'm ok with that. Also, if you're a drink snob, don't get all flustered when they say they've run out of your beer. It happens a lot. Luckily, there's enough choices at the bar so I don't think you'll go home disappointed.  The waitstaff is nice, but everyone is so quirky. I've never had an uninteresting server here. Sometimes that's a good thing. Sometimes it can be a bit of bad thing. I'm ok with that too. Oh, and sometimes it's so dark in here you will feel like you entered a cave or you're having a stroke.

Normally/previously, I request for bread no matter what I order, many times just an appetizer and bottle of wine for late evenings, and they give me bread no problem. Our server,,Jonathan, sternly told us that they/he won't serve bread if I don't buy an entree. He also reaffirmed he's worked there for years - I've never seen him in the countless of times I go, but okay.  Didn't care for him or his 'tude.

The very old-style bar look might put off some people as being a sort of dive where locals get drunk, but it really is a fine establishment where the wait staff is in traditional white shirt/black tie garb and families of all ages came to eat.

2016-05-02,5.0,"I would just like to begin by saying that I am not a native to Chicago. I am from Seattle. I moved to this city feeling as if I had moved to Antarctica based on how lonely I felt. I found this bar simply because I lived close by and it had (apparently which was true) the best ribs in town. I quickly became a regular here and suddenly, I didn't feel as lonely anymore. I don't like to ""put myself out there"". I don't like anyone to feel obligated to speak to me. So when I went, I would happily put on headphones and immerse myself within whatever the Internet had to say. The more I came in though, the more the bartenders got to know me and took a liking to me and were genuinely interested in my well-being and life. I got to know them eventually and with as many patrons they receive including regulars on a daily basis, I never felt like they had an obligation to talk with me. These people are very real and willing to open up to an extent if you are to them.  On an abysmal night that took place a couple of weeks ago, I had an unfortunate circumstance where I lost my wallet because of a friend that took off running out of the bar unexpectedly. Upon my return and realizing what happened, I cannot put into words how accommodating the manager Chris was. Even though I cried ten hours straight that night, he made things better. These people are not just good people, they are some of the best people Chicago has to offer. In my nine months here, this is the only place I have felt comfortable. If you have no friends or family, if you are going through something terrible, if you have lost someone, or you don't know where else to turn, trust me, these people will do their best to make you feel better and it won't seem like an obligation.  James, Tony, Francisco, Beaker, Darren the night manager Chris and the wait staff are some of the most high caliber bartenders, mangers and waiters/waitresses I have ever encountered and I will be forever grateful to have met them. Miller's Pub has a bright sign that shines on Wabash; you absolutely can't miss it. If only every bar had people that shone as bright inside...",0.9917,0.79,0.156,0.054,0.5753907203907205

The spanikopita is killer. Also, breakfast for dinner works here. What to avoid at Millers is the fancy menu items (lamb dishes, Greek chicken sort of stuff) that is mediocre at best.

Hotel desk recommended Miller's for something casual.   We were impressed with the organization and efficiency. According to the story in the menu, it's been family run for generations. The menu was extensive - from salads to steaks. My wife got BBQ chicken salad which she liked.  I got a bacon cheeseburger which was large and tasty. Onion rings were wonderful. Thick cut and nicely fried. Yum. Lots of fries.  We went back for a late breakfast the next day. Had a mixup on my order.  Ordered the ""grilled cheese sandwich with bacon"". What I got was a (very good) ham and cheese sandwich despite the waitress coming back and clarifying (or trying to) the order.  I kept saying I wanted the grilled cheese sandwich with bacon, which she insisted they didn't have Any such thing. We finally figured out that the menu listed a SOURDOUGH grilled cheese sandwich with bacon, which seemed to make all the difference to her understanding.  As I understand it, sourdough is the bread, not the content of the sandwich. Ok, stuff happens but what I would have expected is for the restaurant to replace what I got with what I ordered.  Instead, I was told if I wanted a grilled cheese sandwich with bacon - sorry, SOURDOUGH grilled cheese sandwich with bacon - I would have to pay for it additionally.  I suspect the sandwich costs them about 50 cents to make (sold for $12) so it would have been little skin off their nose and would have earned another star.

2015-04-29,4.0,"In 2015 I attended the HIMSS '15 Conference in Chicago and wanted to try some Chicago-style BBQ. Admittedly, I did not even know that Chicago had a 'style' of BBQ, so I figured this would be a learning experience for me. When our Conference Bus passed Miller's Pub, I noticed the neon-glowing light that red 'World Famous Ribs'. Now, I loathe restaurants that self-proclaim anything as 'world famous' because nine-times-out-of-ten, it couldn't be any farther from the truth. Food: Of course, I ordered the ribs. It was a half rack, came with choice of potato, and a dinner salad. You wouldn't think that the salad would deserve a rating; but it actually does. It was a classic garden salad with crisp, fresh, and vibrantly green lettuce, topped with vegetables that included firm, yet succulent cherry tomatoes and croutons. I ordered mine with Bleu Cheese dressing.  First, and as mentioned above, this may have been one of the freshest salads I have ever had. The lettuce was abnormally crisp and fresh. I say 'abnormally' because I have always gotten average-at-best iceberg lettuce from restaurants. You know, in between that stage of wilted and fresh where it is just 'passable' without warranting a complaint. This theme was further exemplified by the cherry tomatoes. They burst with flavor and were firm (not wrinkly and soft) on the outside. Lastly, the bleu cheese dressing was excellent. I don't know if it was bottled or homemade, but I haven't had that brand before if it was bottled. I need to find out what brand it was. Though, it may very well be homemade. Next were the ribs. Now, they set the bar pretty damn high by self-proclaiming them to be world-famous. In my opinion, they are not deserving of a 'world famous' title; but they were good. For me, the bbq sauce was a little too 'ketchup-y' ... kind of hard to describe. It didn't taste like their were an abundance of spices or seasonings in it; which may very well be perfect for another diner. For me, I like a bold BBQ sauce that migrates toward the sweeter end of the spectrum, that also has a touch of heat (spiciness), and also a touch of tang (vinegar / acidity). For me, the BBQ sauce was underwhelming and very basic. On the other hand, the ribs were cooked perfectly. So many people have it all wrong. Ribs should not be 'falling-off'the-bone'. They should JUST be hanging onto the bone. Striking this balance is so hard to do, and Miller's nailed it. The ribs maintained a nice 'pull' from the bone that rendered them slightly chewy, but also incredibly tender. Like I said, striking that balance is very hard, and they nailed it. Food: Ribs (5) Salad (5) BBQ (2) Overall -- 4 / 5 Service: We had a server that I thought perfectly exemplified Chicago. He was (no doubt) a Chicago-native with a rough-and-tumble sort of attitude, but was incredibly polite, respectful, and prompt with his service. He did not do anything well-above-and-beyond that blew my mind, but he was exactly what I would want in all of my servers. Service: 4 / 5 Atmosphere: I seriously was digging this atmosphere. The lighting was dimmer than most restaurants, and the furnishings were 'old world'. It really felt like an authentic Chicago-eatery. The booths were ultra comfortable, and I could totally see myself chilling out here on a regular basis. Not only does Miller's offer classic fare like ribs, but they also offer higher-class items like prime rib and lamb chops. This place is like an elevated-pub. It was classy, yet a little darker and pub-ish. Amazing. Never been anywhere quite like it -- except for when I was in London. In addition to the above, there was also a diverse selection of beer. In addition to diverse, it was also unique. I am not a big beer drinker, but even I thought this was pretty cool. Atmosphere: 5 / 5 Price: The prices are definitely a little steep. My half rack of ribs was about $19. A lot of the other menu items were also priced in the high $20 range and $30 range. This is not a place to come and have dinner a few nights per week. For me, this would be a once per month place. Based on the Ribs and the salad, I feel like I paid a little bit too much for what I got; but this shouldn't detract diners from coming here to eat. It was still well-worth the money. Price: 3 / 5 Final Thoughts: I was extremely pleased with my meal, and would definitely return here for another dinner. Though I probably would not get the ribs again, that is not a reflection of me not liking them. It is a reflection of me wanting to try a lot of their other menu items, because as I walked by other tables and saw the prime rib (and other dishes), I could feel my mouth water -- and I had just consumed a whole plate of ribs and fries! I firmly believe that Miller's takes a great deal of pride in the quality of the product that they serve, and because of that, I would definitely return.",0.9978,0.827,0.126,0.048,0.53519014693172
2015-04-25,2.0,"Overall not too impressed with Miller's. We were at a conference at the Palmer House, so Miller's was convenient and nearby. I was surprised at how poor the customer service was--everyone from the host to the waitress to the guy refilling water glasses was gruff and impersonal. My entire dining party noticed. The food was sort of predictably mediocre. It has a kind of Greek, kind of steakhouse vibe. It's one of those places that has every kind of cuisine on the menu, which is usually a red flag in my book. My group got mostly appetizers and sandwiches. I'd say that all of the food was edible, but none of it was excellent. A few people tried the spanokopita but left most of it on their plates.

2015-03-31,2.0,"My friend asked me what I wanted to eat and I said, ""Anything, as long as it's really good,"" because the last 3 restaurants I've eaten at since I've been in town have been really mediocre. Friend said Miller's was one of his favorites; it's near his office and he eats here all the time.  It was jam packed and we got a buzzer from the hostess, who said it would be a 15 minutes wait, so we went over to the bar to grab a beer, but the buzzer went off before we even got the bartender's attention. It was more like a 2 minute wait. That was nice. We were seated under a wall of signed photographs of people I did not recognize. The waitress was really friendly.  My friend and I both ordered the 8 ounce steak. Friend got a beer; it looks like they have a nice selection of craft beers here.  A small basket of assorted bread came out; it looked beautiful but was pretty bland and boring in the mouth. I tried the whole wheat one, the pretzel bread, and a sort of garlicky crostini kind of thing. The 3rd one was the best but none of them were worth the carbs, in my opinion. Just tasteless, cold, mass produced rolls.  Salads came out quickly. They were just iceberg lettuce with a little purple cabbage and a single cherry tomato. I'm curious as to why bleu cheese dressing costs $1.50 extra (my husband later suggested that the dressing might be mixed by cherubs in the back). I sort of wanted bleu cheese but I had a pretty good idea that my friend was going to insist on picking up the tab and I had already ordered a steak, so I went with creamy garlic. The dressing was OK but the salad was nothing to write home about, and some of the lettuce was brown along the edges. Fast on the heels of the salad came the steak and potato! Sigh. The steak was perfectly cooked (medium rare), but it was almost completely unseasoned. To be honest, when the waitress brought a bottle of steak sauce to the table in advance of the food (along with ketchup and pepper sauce), I began to worry. I added salt and pepper and it tasted good, but there was a big piece of gristle down the side. The baked potato managed to both be hard and underdone while at the same time tasting as if it had been cooked earlier and reheated. Furthermore, when I ordered I specifically said ""a baked potato with butter"" and my potato was served with something that tasted an awful lot like margarine. Huh? Who does that? I could only eat about 3 bites of potato. Each steak also came with 2 onion rings on top, which was a lovely idea in theory. In practice, putting onion rings on top of a steak that sitting in a puddle of juice produces soggy onion rings.  This meal was NOT worth $22 dollars. I have consistently eaten better steak, potatoes, salad, and bread at the freaking Texas Roadhouse and you get 16 ounces for less money, plus peanuts, and while I can't say that I care for the ambiance at Texas Roadhouse, it was so ridiculously loud at Miller's that I had to shout across the table, which isn't really any kind of improvement over waitresses line dancing to country music.",0.9981,0.788,0.174,0.038,0.5543001443001443

Yes, they were slammed but the attitude isn't necessary. Apparently, their policy at the bar is no food orders until everyone at the bar has a drink order fulfilled. Bummer.

The serving was humongous though - it honestly could have been three meals for me. I also tried a bit of the Seafood Combo Platter. I liked it but since all the seafood is fried, this dish seems like it may be better as an appetizer. It would have been too much for me if I ordered it as an appetizer.

We walk over, and there's no where to sit at the bar but there are tons of empty tables. I walk back to the host and ask if we could have a table. He informs me no  table unless were eating. The bar has limited seating and a party of happy drinkers want to drink in your PUB and you say no. Um, eh. So  I tell him sure, we'll have appetizers and he tells us to go sit at a table. Because there are so many empty ones he really doesn't care where we sit, yet gave us a hard time. I later see this guy speaking so terribly to one of the kitchen staff that it pissed me off.

The pubs I go to usually feel very comfortable and ""home-y."" I did not get that from this place at all. Once we requested a table the server walked to our table and we literally lost our way to it and couldn't find the server for a few seconds. The tables were all way too close together with barely any walking room. The place was packed, but I think it's because it's in downtown Chicago, not for any quality.  As soon as we sat down, I noticed how dated the decor is. It's incredibly tacky and dusty. Behind my wife's head there was a floor mat under the lamp. To make things worse, it was dirty and dusty. The booths seem like they're at least twenty years old and haven't had proper maintenance.   The menu also lacked something to be desired. It was pretty grimy and didn't seem updated very frequently. The prices seemed decently competitive for the area but lacked cohesiveness. The beer menu is relatively impressive however. Vast and expansive, one of the few good things I could say about this place. I ended up ordering mozzarella sticks for an appetizer and fish and chips that were the ""specialty"" for the main course. My wife ordered the taco salad.  Now for the food. In a word it was awful. The mozzarella sticks were served luke-warm with a watery marinara sauce. They were rock hard and appeared to be store-bought. The fish and chips were disgusting. The fries were also luke-warm and I had to actually spit out the fish. The outside was very crispy, but the inside was mush. It was almost like eating a fried oatmeal ball. I've had better fish and chips at chain restaurants. It didn't flake and was hard to cut. The tartar sauce served with it tasted old as well as the coleslaw. My wife's taco salad had about three ingredients that weren't mentioned on the menu in it, and contained the wrong kind of beans. I've never heard of a taco salad with navy beans in it. The shell was also very hard and too crunchy. I've never had to spit out food in my life until this day.  Luckily, our service was decent, albeit rushed. Neither my wife or I came close to finishing our food and were sick enough to not want to eat for the rest of the day after. We asked for the check and after navigating the maze of tables that were too close together we got out of there.

The ribs are ""Chicago style"" which means that they aren't really BBQ or smoked, but baked. They are fall-off-the-bone tender, and taste great, but rib snobs probably would not approve.  The beer selection is great as well.

However, the older gentleman at the door was actually kind of abrupt and told us that to get a table for two we would need to wait A HALF HOUR. That wouldn't be so long, except that it was -10 degrees outside and he seemed to suggest that we wait outside or sit in the bar area? Frankly, I would never be so ticked off by that suggestion, except that there were visible empty tables.  Regardless, we took a brisk walk up to the Bean and back (ten minutes each way) and when we returned, we were informed we had 'missed' the beeper going off.  Okay, so the old man was wrong about the time frame, but now he wouldn't seat us! Generally, I would leave when I'm not treated well at a spot like this, but we had street parking so we didn't want to tempt fate.  So we headed to the bar and took a seat at the far end.  The bartender was FANTASTIC. He was friendly but not overbearing and very knowledgeable. We are beer snobs and the beer list was extensive. I had a delicious stout and two good wheat beers. My date had some good IPAs too. The bartender even dropped by tastes of some additional beers he thought we might like!  Despite the rough start to the evening, we left Miller's warm from drink and pretty impressed with the bar and the bartender.  I think I want to give it another try, and I figure that the gentleman at the door might have just been having a bad night.

Miller's is my favorite place to get a drink with friends after work. I also love to bring my family here when they visit from out of town. During the day it's perfect for families and at night it's a terrific place to let loose. I love their Dark and Stormies and Old Fashions. They really do make the best Old Fashion I've had in the city. They don't do a modern twist on their classic ""city"" cocktails; they just make them right. They taste the way they're supposed to. They also check to make sure you want gin in your martini instead of assuming you'd prefer vodka. And they have anchovy olives for those extra dirty martinis! They have a menu of old standards but they bring n some great seasonal specials. This is the place for small fry in the Spring and Tom and Jerries in the Winter. I like to order the greek salad and calamari to split with friends while we drink. Their chicken pot pie is legendary. I've never seen someone eat the whole thing.  One drawback is that the secret is definitely out and unless you go at an off-hour you'll be waiting about thirty minutes for a table. Trust me, it's worth it.

When this was a hard core, blue collar drinking town.    Sure, the food is good and the drinks are reasonably priced, but a visit to Millers Pub is all about the vibe. Its like traveling back in time. I've been so blitzed in this joint that I swear I saw Bill Veeck, Harry Caray and Papa Bear George Halas having a cold one at the table next to me. Of course, that was back when I was a wild twenty-something. OK, I drank that much in my 30's as well but who's counting.   Baseball crazed people like me will remember when White Sox Owner, Bill Veeck would hold his press conferences at Miller Pub. It was Bill's home away from home. Bill always did have good taste.

The long bar, the ""seasoned"" bartender, kind of reminded me of a bar in an Italian city, where you don't have college students serving drinks, but experienced bartenders who made a nice career out of their passion for drinks and people.  In such a setting you expect to get hammered with the prices. Instead, once again in Chicago, we were positively surprised. My wife had a glass of Italian Lambrusco, a very nice one by the way, not as sweet as many Lambrusco I tried in the past and I had the Cabernet Soverain from California, very nice.

Heck a few years ago you could have started  the viagra triangle in here except there were not alot of women who showed up...except maybe for drinks smack dab at 5pm but the fairer sex would not be there at 6:30 PM. This is not the case today. Not to that I would go to a place just to hang out with women :)  who me ? Since I have been going here on and off from 1998 and on I figured I would review this place. I go here instead of going to another place that is a pub down the street that starts with the letter E and is a pub. I have written it this way so this wont get removed. The catch of the day i e fish is always pretty good. Sometimes I will call in at 11:30 to see what it is and order it to go because if it is something that sounds tasty I will walk the 12 blocks from the office to go get it because i am hungry and  its good exercise. The fried lake perch is awesome. On ocassion I have asked them to grill it rather than fry it because it will be healthier. I asked them to include a baked potato as opposed to french fries as a side and they complied. Seems like they will work with you if you want to change some things but not if you are being a huge pain and want  to totally reorganize the menu..not that anyone would dream of this I sometimes come here with some friends after a show at Millenium park... You know when the wine wears off and you are like "" ok how much more damage can we do tonight""? OK dont answer that question When I am plastered I usually have the taco salad which is under $12 with taxes if you order it to go. I usually  order it without the jalapeno's since spicy things and me dont get along. OY. The drinks are not priced out of this world. it should be noted that they have a good wine selection price. The Australian Chardonnet is $6.50 which if this was somewhere  else in the downtown area could be as high as $11 a glass. Many other wines for $7 a glass come here after work and chill out.

2013-08-18,1.0,"I would like to start by saying the only reason this deserves 1 star and not 0 is because the drinks were good.  The service and customer relations was terrible, which for a business in the service industry is unacceptable.  When we entered the restaurant the host was extremely rude.  We asked for a table and all he did was grunt and yell at us to move further in passed the host stand.  We were sat in a reasonable amount of time, however the menus were just thrown on the table by the host with no effort to give them to the guests.  Sadly it gets worse, as we looked around we noticed that every member of the waitstaff appeared angry and as if they hated their jobs..unacceptable.  Then our waiter arrived, also angry.  We asked before ordering like you are supposed to if we could split the check, he was short with us and stated no. This policy is not listed FYI.  After this we began looking at drinks and food, once we had decided we attempted to get his attention so we could order only to be ignored multiple times.  We then waited as he sat talking with the other staff ignoring our table within our sight.  Finally we were able to order drinks.  The waiter then disappeared and never asked if we were ready to order food.  Once he brought our drinks to us, handing the wrong drinks to people at the table, he left again, not asking for our order.  We the waited again while he ignored his tables.  After a long wait, being able to see him simply standing around, we were able to order.  During our waiting the bus boys were filling our water and doing the waiter's job, if it would have been possible they would have received the tip.  The Waiter eventually brought out the food for the table, minus one entrée and left with no explanation were the other meal was.  After waiting wondering if the other dish would appear he arrived dropping the dish and leaving as fast as he could. The burger he brought last was cold as well, but because we once again could not get a hold of him because seemingly we did not exist nothing could be done.  The waiter again returned long enough to ask how everything was and turn and walk away before getting an answer.  This was the last we saw of him until he dropped the check on the table while walking by, not even stopping to ask if we wanted anything else.  At this point we grabbed the manager, because the service was unacceptable and after working in a restaurant for over 5 years I was appalled at the blatant disregard for the customer.  After a good amount of time the waiter returned, this time throwing the bill and mints at the table and stomping away.  Acting like a child is never acceptable, and in any restaurant the customer comes first and the staff should always be pleasant whether it is fake or not.  I will never be going back to this establishment as they appear to not understand how to run a restaurant.",-0.9654,0.872,0.039,0.088,0.5625692137320044

2013-08-01,4.0,"Be warn, my review maybe long so I may post the Pros and Cons down in case you don't like to read the full detail... which I recommend you. :3 So yesterday was me and my fiance's anniversary and decided to dine here for the first time. Funny story short, we chose this place because we debated what to eat in; Miller Pub or Exchequer Restaurant & Pub. It was the dessert we chose, therefore we headed here.  We wanted to try something... more expensive, more fancy to fit into for our date. Fortunately we went inside without reservation, and  unlike Bennigans, the place looks rather huge and pleasant feeling into it. I like it here. It's not noisy, crowded, isolated and anymore of it negative than you can get in Bennigans. It's perfect. We were greeted by the kind people at the counter and immediately got a table down. We were served by our waitress we first thought she was a bit rude, but it was because she had a list down of people in front of us waiting for their meal. What happened was that after we ordered our meal, we asked where were the the drinks. It was actually end of the table line behind the salt and paper and examined the drinks. There were a lot to offer, especially how expensive both wine and beer were, but it was okay. However, no free refills were exceptional. They ask for refills or another bottle up--you are charged amount how much you say yes. But our waitress wasn't that rude, it's just how fast she is pacing up. Amazingly to say, we were stabilized with the appetizers until the dinner arrives. Wonderful. So towards our meal subject; my fiance ordered a Moon River, or Green River ($3) and I ordered an Orange Juice ($4). Then, we ordered two appetizers--12 pieces of hot buffalo  wings with blue cheese ($10.50) and fried mozzarella sticks ($7). My fiance likes the cheese sticks, same goes with me. It's a bit oily on the side, but as long you take a bite on it with the marinara sauce.  It's wonderful, but it's a little pricey on the side. for eight sticks and a big bowl of marinara. Now with the buffalo wings... it wasn't what I thought it would be. It's very saucy with the hot sauce. Normally wouldn't buffalo wings meant to be fried? Safe environment is, it's baked completely, but still isn't my like to my expectations. We took our time devouring the meat with free water refilling on the side as our dinner came up. He ordered a Bleu Cheese burger sided with french fries ($9.75). I ordered a BBQ extra bacon with fried onions cheddar burger too, sided with french fries ($9.75). It tasted great. He loved his, I loved mines. The fried onions brought the flavors of real BBQ meal alive. We were getting full and we ordered two desserts; Cheese Cake with strawberries and strawberry syrup ($5.75) and Tiramisu (5.75). The cheese cake is delicious! Once again my husband loves the smoothness of it in his mouth. The Tiramisu is a chocolaty coffee flavored sponge cake that is absolute must if you are a coffee lover. It's not too strong of a flavor, but the greatness of the drizzled chocolate helps differs it away.  We left with a great expectation of the place. Only reason this didn't retrieve a five is because of the buffalo wings and maybe the drinks. It's quite expensive, especially how tall the orange juice glass retrieves. Just about four sips, depending if you don't really like drinking just water, or so it's already drinking all. Once again, it's four dollars just to have a refill. It possibly may have refill on mines, but we paid double on my fiance's drink so I know it's impossible. Maybe it's too fine to get that expectation? It's not like Bennigans; it's twice better than there. It's my opinion, but I like it here. We will make a comeback when I return to Chicago. Pros: Friendly staff, comfortable atmosphere, not noisy, not isolating, good place for anniversaries, dates. Must a-go. Cons: Drinks non-refillable, not suitable for parties.",0.9978,0.803,0.149,0.049,0.5772222222222224
2013-07-29,3.0,"Millers Pub is all about the raucous friendly fun you can have there with friendly staff of all kinds of ethnic origins who will provide excellent service and joke around with you.  Round this off with well made cocktails, a very carefully selected beer list that ranges from Duvel to Old Rasputin to local favorite Goose Island and at that point the food stops mattering.   It of course does not suck that they have respectable old classics like ribs and meatloaf done reasonably well.  Walking in and sitting on the faded banquettes, served by staff dressed in all black and bowties transports you to the era when this place was established.

To be completely honest I had misgivings initially that this was going to be another Hackneys but thankfully it proved itself better.  I had the spanakopita for dinner and it was wonderful. I bumped the rice side and opted for the carrots instead. Carrots were VERY interesting, first off they were carrot balls (no lie) and they were based in an amaretto making them sweet.  My daughter opted for the chicken schnitzel, although she found it to be too lemony, I thought it tasted just fine.  My son ordered the fish and chips. The fish was actually good, fries standard. Finishing off the meal we split the lemon ricotta cheesecake. What really stood out about the dessert was the texture, it was so crumbly, fluffy and light for a cheesecake.  Overall, not a bad experience. The pricing was moderate for downtown. The other food we saw brought out to other tables all looked good. I caught a glimpse of a burger and some ribs that looked yummy.  Like I said the place was packed, yet as a party of four we were seated within fifteen minutes. The location of our table wasn't the best but we were also under the gun for time. Our server could of made an effort to be a smidge more personable but overall she was not bad.

This was pre-email (which our bosses probably would have snooped on, anyway - they even took Solitaire off our computers - pfft) so we'd write each other letters (remember writing letters?? aw...) and pass them to each other in interoffice envelopes, to complain about *them* and the turmoil of life in our early 20's. Crazy Glue couldn't provide a stronger bond, y'all.  Miller's Pub is an old school institution that has been around forever...not many places like this exist anymore. It reminds me a bit of the old Berghoff's, just without the German angle, and with a slightly Greek angle. The menu offers a lot of options...all kinds of sandwiches, salads, burgers, and entrees....including lamb, and spinach pie (aka the Greek angle). My gal pal and I chatted away while enjoying our meals...Athenian chicken (more Greek angle) for her, open-faced hot turkey sandwich for me. She liked her chicken, but said it was a little dry.  My turkey sandwich was yummy sloppy (yay gravy!) good...I inhaled all of it (I was way hungry). We decided we needed dessert....she ordered the creme caramel, which she enjoyed but said it was a smidge too sweet. I opted for the lemon ricotta cheesecake, which was fine but a tad dry. Price-wise, Miller's is very reasonable. The bill for the two of us including drinks was $52.  We left Miller's Pub as happy campers. And yes, we talked about *them*. Some things never change.

Unfortunately my experience at this old, tired and lazy restaurant was not as amazing...Walking into the tired,cluttered decor and table arrangement of the restaurant was a warning sign of bland food catered to those who lost the use of their taste buds long ago.  However, hearing of their ""famous"" ribs that are second to none peaked my curiosity.   My party of six had a reservation and were promptly seated and that was the only fast thing about the dining experience...our server was a lady in her late 50's and moved like she was in her 70's, she claimed to work there for 23 yeas and apparently had seen better days.  as it took her ten minutes to greet our table and after getting out drink orders another 15 to bring the drinks, the rib appetizer came before our drinks and was cold and tasteless the calamari was ok but nothing special...our drinks finally come and we give our entree orders,  the girls in our group enjoyed their french martinis and the men did enjoy their beer from a really nice craft beer list...the drinks were good, but i wondered why they took so long...the waitress has only a 4 table section...then i notice the ancient bartenders and my friend enlightens me to the fact that Chicago bartenders are in a union...the picture becomes clear on slow service. The waitress takes forever to bring out a second round in fact i order my bottle of beer as i ordered my entree but didn't receive it until i was already halfway done with my meal..we became wise to this situation decide order drinks as we get receive them...the food was bland, i had the broiled whitefish, no texture and a little slimy to be honest but worst of all absolutely no seasoning...the man next to us using his oxygen machine appears happy but i am not.  We saw our server about 6 times during the 2 hour meal and for one with 23 years experience this is unacceptable, not to mention lack of menu knowledge as she was unable to answer questions about the food or drink menu.  I must disclose i am a server/bartender and i was out with my restaurants owner...we both agreed we will not be back again...we tip 20% and tell her good job with grinning teeth and think exactly the opposite...Kitchen Nightmares come save this fossil of a restaurant",0.9936,0.794,0.153,0.054,0.6079365079365078

Maybe you've only ever been to sports bars or weren't 21 until a couple years ago, but this is what a bar actually looks and feels like. That said, the food is outstanding. Try anything Greek- I am addicted to the spanikopita and Greek salad- and you will not be disappointed. Just drinking? Belly up to the bar for a drink that actually contains alcohol. The extensive beer selection is new and very welcome and they rotate the wine selections with some regularity.

The crust was perfectly crunchy and seasoned, and the white fish flakey and cooked well. I liked the tartar sauce too. I will be back for that again! Our only complaint was the bread. We found one type of the two rolls very stale. Very unappealing. But the bread was free, and we weren't there for the bread, so I don't put much value in this little bother.

The man at the host station barked at my friend when asking her how many we had in our party. The waiter started out fine enough, bringing water and taking orders. But then his attitude got worse as time went on. He scowled at us each time he walked by and seemed annoyed when we asked if we could have 2 separate checks. (One check per table by the way, which we didn't learn until after we'd ordered drinks.)  My cod sandwich was good. But the burgers weren't- they were described to me as watered down. The lake something hot chocolate was great, though.  None of the wait staff seemed to smile at all the entire time we were there. It was odd. The bussers were really friendly. Then the check came. We didn't feel our waiter was deserving of the 18% added gratuity, so we asked the manager to remove it after explaining what had happened throughout the meal. He seemed concerned and removed it for us. And we asked if we could pay with multiple cards because of the one check rule. The waiter brought the new check back, split up for each meal. He threw it down on the table and stormed away. If nothing else had happened that night, his attitude alone when bringing back the new bill was enough to ruin the entire experience here. He stormed back again to take our cards and threw them down when he brought the receipts.  Overall, this place wasn't worth the trip.

Excellent spuds and they actually know how to Roast things. Sometimes the fish fry is great too--check it out. I now happily bring my son here where he is always accommodated.

That's exactly what we wanted to do so we could wait out the oncoming severe weather. They have great craft beers on tap, and a bunch of others available in bottles. After a few beers, we ordered some burgers, which were delicious and well cooked. I love me a tall burger. After dinner, we had a few more beers and waited out the storm. I was really impressed by the staff's handling of the sudden influx of people in the restaurant. The place was packed, and they had even more people waiting outside. Yet somehow, they weren't flustered by any of it, and we got very good service and attention; almost like we were the only ones there.

My Wife & I had come from Southern Illinois to experience the fine fare of the Windy City which began kind of okay until we started ordering the food. For beginners, we ordered the mysteriously disappearing spinach dip with pita bread which never saw the day of light at our table (Luckily for the staff it wasn't plugged onto our final bill). I ordered the fried Lake perch and my Wife ordered the ""recommended"" daily special of catfish only to be mortified by what was bought to the table. The amount of batter used on the Lake Perch put a stranglehold on the flavour and didn't allow the Perch to make a positive impression and even worse was the cold, watery catfish fillet served with lukewarm mashed sweet potatoes. The server returned the dish to the kitchen when it was bought to her attention, only to have it come back with slightly warmer mashed potatoes and the catfish was in the same exact position on the plate which was evidence of them just htrowing the plate in the microwave for a couple minutes before bringing it back out plus it was  horrible as they hadn't cleaned the belly fat off the fillet at all. This gave the fillet a disgusting blubbery finish which was truly just unacceptable. Watching my Wife being unable to finish her meal pissed me off to the point that I lost my appetite and left shortly afterwards after they removed the cost of her dish from the final bill. Also I don't understand why they'd bring the accompanying salad for my Lake Perch meal approximately 10 minutes before the rest of it came out.

2012-03-12,3.0,"Waiting for my lunch companion, I sat hunched over in a corner by the front door. I noticed a framed article from a 2003 Wall Street Journal about ""underrated"" restaurants around the U.S.. Miller's Pub was one-lauded primarily for its ambiance and friendly bar. That may be the only reason to come, or because of nasty weather, you happen to find it conveniently located.  If anyone opened a place such as this now, and offered the same menu, you might think: what is this place? Pub food? Yes. Steakhouse? No, But they have them. Seafood? Some. But wait, Italian, too? And a few Greek offerings (probably your best choice.) And none of these done very well. Kind of a marriage of a Golden Nugget diner and the old Berghoff, albeit a faded and sadder version of the big wooden-paneled, coffered ceiling, 19th century appeal of the latter.  Believe me, I've eaten here many, many times, and am baffled as to why people wait in line to get in. I guess it's just some kind of old momentum, it's location, history and connections with the hotel concierges. After all these years, I still don't know what Miller's Pub is famous for, other than just being around as an Old Chicago institution for some 77 years. That said, my friend and I were seated immediately just past noon. Our server was prompt and efficient, yet the we-need-to-turn-this-table energy was abuzz all around us. I had a corned beef on rye ($8.95) and my friend the pulled pork sandwich ($8.95) accompanied with a handful of those chalky, yellow steak fries. Mr. Pulled Pork said his was OK. It looked good. I would have been better served getting corned beef sandwich at Aida's deli down the street.  I would recommend it for one of those winter nights, where you want something cozy or ""gemutlich,"" where you can meet friends for drinks.

Despite the fact that I usually like to be more adventurous, since the sign out front told me to ""Try our Fish and Chips"" I went for it. Now, I just got back from Vietnam where basically every meal was served with seafood, and I was still impressed. The fish was  fall-apart cooked to perfection, coated in a beer-battered-deep-fried-sinfully-delicious outer shell. The fries were good too. The portion was big enough that if I was starving I probably would have had leftovers (aka perfect man-portion). It also came with a homemade tartar sauce which was delicious. My boyfriend had some ginormous hamburger which I don't even think he finished (don't tell anyone, though. It might hurt his ego).  The ambience was very ""Old Chicago"".

My boyfriend's fries were a good as mine, his sandwich came on a pretzel roll which he liked because the sandwich didn't get soggy or fall apart due to the saucy pork.

I landed in Chicago late Friday night and by the time I was ready to go out, it was 1:30 and to my shock, everything was closed.  I thought Chicago bars and clubs stayed open at LEAST until 3AM.  Well, apparently I was wrong.  The only place we happened to find for a drink was Miller's Pub.  They even let us put an order of food in before closing the kitchen. Now the place is like any restaurant/bar that is the only place open within miles of tourist hotels: Overpacked, underrated food, mediocre drinks. After the DMB Caravan Saturday night, I was exhausted, starving and on a mission for deep dish pizza.  I was not so politely informed by locals that all pizza places in the area would be closed and it would be at least 5-6 blocks before I found anything.  Now I'm pretty brave, however, I have enough common sense to know that a single female, in a dress, with a handbag walking 5 blocks after midnight ALONE is asking for trouble. After throwing my hands up in defeat and trekking back to the hotel, I happened to walk past Miller's Pub and decided to settle for a burger.   Now this is where I give the place 5 stars.  I walked in and saw the host was overwhelmed with trying to get a wedding party of 10+ seated and ordering food, while ushering other guests to tables and bar seating.  I waited until he acknowledged me then asked to place a carryout order.  One of the other host looked at him and said ""We arent taking carryout orders any more"" to which the host looked at me and said ""Uh.... I'll make it an exception, here's a menu, let me know what you want"".  I told him I'd know in 2 seconds flat to which he responded ""No worries, dont rush"".  If that isnt amazing customer service, then I dont know what is.  I placed my order and took a seat next to a guy that I thought was also waiting for an order.  Turns out he was a local that was friends with the guy whose parent's own Miller's Pub.  He told me about the nightlife, good places to go and eat. Overall, I'd rate the food a 3 1/2.  Its your typical bar food, however, the night before we had calamari which was shockingly amazing.  I ordered a BBQ cheese burger which hit the spot.  At first I was confused because I didnt see any BBQ sauce on it.  Turns out they put the sauce on the patty and a huge slab of cheese so you dont get BBQ sauce everywhere.  Smart cookies!

2011-06-06,1.0,"Went here for lunch since we were staying in the Hilton Palmer hotel.  I ordered a ""famous"" greek salad and my wife ordered the chicken pot pie.  That was her first mistake.  Chicken pot pies are bacteria havens and unless they arrive SMOKING hot through to the center, you are ingesting lots of nasty bugs. My salad was ok, I have no idea why they are famous.  Maybe because no-one got sick from them. My wife's pot pie arrived within 5 minutes of being ordered, 5 MINUTES!  You can't properly cook a chicken pot pie in 5 minutes even if they are pre-prepared in a warmer (a warmer is a proofer that helps yeast (a bacteria we like) grow).  That was her second mistake, not sending it back.  It was warm, not piping hot, a big red flag.  Two hours later she was violently ill and was out cold for the night. I went back to complain the next morning and the same manager was on duty.  He was completely indifferent and stated they can't make them to order, and that they keep them in a warmer until ordered.  So he admitted they keep them in bacteria breeding factories until ordered.  He was completely unhelpful and is obviously NOT ServSafe manager certified (I am).  He didn't offer to refund her meal, and basically didn't give a damn about one of his customers.   His only excuse was that no-one else complained and that she wouldn't have gotten sick that quickly.  No-one else complaining doesn't mean anything.  That's like saying I'm young today so I'll be young forever.  as far as her getting sick quickly, 2 hours isn't that quick, STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS has an onset of 1-8 hours and fits her signs and symptoms.  It is interesting to note that you can't ""cook"" Staph out of food, once the kitchen staff infects the dish, it stays.

I liked the atmosphere, even at 11:00 on a Saturday this place was packed with eaters. That is usually a good sign when establishing if somewhere is a local hangout.

I'd arrived on time, but found her already waiting at the bar along side a sea of other patrons. As soon as the man sitting next to her realized she & I were together, he'd very thoughtfully offered to move all the way down to the end of the bar where the last vacant seat was available. It was a very nice gesture and pleasant start to our evening out. I know he offered out of kindness, but we bought him a round to say ""thanks"", anyway.  The bar's atmosphere is vintage and quite cool. The wood paneled walls adorned with various oil paintings immediately set the stage for the kind of experience I enjoy. No pounding beats in the background or annoying patrons bumping into you at every turn will allow your conversation to flow quite comfortably. That, along with Michael serving you a perfectly made Martini and excellent food served right to your bar stool makes for a great springboard to a terrific evening out.  It is a little on the expensive side, but for the location, I guess you gotta expect that. I don't think I can afford to become a ""regular"" here, but that's OK.

2010-11-07,1.0,"Addendum as of 11/7/2010: I have a friend in from London staying with me for a few days. Like I said, I host a lot of international visitors, and I always take them here for a drink. Last night I decided to try some of their food. I had eaten once before but it was a long time ago. Also let me preface by saying that I'm a pescatarian - I eat fish but not other types of meat. My friend got cheese ravioli, I got broiled catfish. I was STARVING and was super stoked to finally get some food. My dish also came with black beans and rice - which tasted like an MRE. A 'Meal Ready to Eat'. It's a food package that soldiers eat in the field. It's reconstituted, dehydrated, and makes you constipated so you don't have to poop so much during combat. The problem though, was that I assumed this side had no meat in it. Well, it did. My bad. I call our waitress over and inquire, she goes to check, and returns confirming that the black beans and rice surely has no meat in it. WELL. That's fine. I already see a piece of sausage here so I can avoid the side altogether. (she later came again and corrected that yes, this side contained meat). My problem was this: if I had asked before eating it, I would have ended up biting into meat. So either way, there are two options for this fuck-up-erry here: A) Misinformation on the kitchen's part (this side contains no meat/this side contains meat) B) If this side indeed should contain no meat, then someone is screwing up in the kitchen and getting sausage in there anyway Now I know I'm nitpicking just because of ONE little side dish. I'm posting a negative review, however, at how this problem was handled. By this point I had lost my appetite. I ask for a supervisor to speak with. I tell him my dilemma, I reiterate that I do enjoy his establishment but that I was sorely disappointed in my food experience. He was dismissive, flighty, and almost afraid of confrontation from me, even though I was very polite. All he said was, ""I'm very sorry, it will be comped."" Okay, that's fine, but I'd be a bit happier if you actually listened to me, started a dialogue, and came up with a solution. At one point I actually had to stop him from walking away so I could finish speaking. I have something to say to you, and you will listen. Upon my leaving I had to walk past him, and he didn't even look up. If I complain to you, you can at least say good-bye to me. That's just poor managerial skills. So, the food was reminiscent of the worst school cafeteria fare and the upper management has no idea how to handle problems or customers. I was pissed.

It's the kind of place that has picture of celebrities on the walls, menu items named after celebrities, the kind of place that Sinatra probably ate it in the 60s, drank and smoked until early in the morning. The food was pretty good, but nothing stood out too much. Free bread, which was cool, and good recs from the server--someone in our party asked for the goulash, and the server was upfront, remarking that the goulash wasn't very good, recommending something else. So the honesty was nice (and why I've bumped this up to 4 stars instead of down to 3). The server raved about the prime rib sandwich, and it was a pretty good prime rib sandwich, but I wouldn't say, ""You HAVE to get to Miller's and have the prime rib sandwich."" I enjoyed it, but it's not quite legendary. All in all, we've always had a good meal there, enjoyed ourselves quite a bit.",0.9981,0.705,0.295,0.0,0.6218201058201059

The bartenders are dressed in shirt & vest, the booths are tall and made from real wood. I very warm and comfortable place to hang out. Let's talk about my favorite thing here...the food! The Fried Calamari is simply some of the best I've ever had...anywhere!  The coating is light and crisp, the Calamari is tender and sweet. Every time! The Onion Rings are also light and crispy.  You get a mountain of rings, definitly for two or more people. And my other favorite appetizer are the Sauage and Peppers, the saute peppers are sweet, tender and not over cooked or greasy.  Mind you I didn't have all this in one seating, but over the last five to six  months during trips back to Chicago. The Itailian Sauage is awesome, it comes with sauted Bell Peppers and Onions, I haven't found this favor in Dallas area anywhere. The Baby Back Ribs came as a slab or you get a 1/2 order combo with Shrimp or Chicken.  The ribs are meaty and tender. Very good. Other one of my favorites are the Greek Labm Chops, you get plenty, four I think, season to greatness. And the old fashion Chopped Steak was so old school with the grilled onions, it's waa real treat. I forgot how good a Chopped Steak could be. Did I mention they serve a real hearty breakfast too.

What I think I like most is just the atmosphere.  It is like it used to be a high end restaurant decades ago and hasn't really changed since.  There is a ton of wood paneling, paintings on the wall, green leather seats and wait staff in black and white.  It is just old classic Chicago, but without a massive price tag.  That the wait staff is competent and friendly and the food is always good just makes it a comfortable place to have dinner or just go for a drink. The food is nothing special, I am sure someplace does everything they do a little better, except that so far, they have the best burger I've ever had in Chicago.  There really isn't anything special with the burger either though, it is a big 10oz burger, good quality meat, and always good perfectly medium rare, as I request it.  All the cheeses they use are top quality and the bun itself is just a good solid bun, that adds the necessary structure but not any flavors that subtract from the burger itself, as I hate the places that give you sweet rolls with a burger.  I feel the burger is a good example of what they do, they don't do anything special or different, they don't do anything really complicated, but they just do things right. Everything I've had is solid, and I must have gone through everything on the menu by now.  The ribs are solid, the steaks are good, the pork chops, fried chicken, etc. and one other thing I always like is their turkey club.  You can tell they're using their own roasted turkey, fresh cooked bacon, and they always have good ripe tomatoes. I come here often, normally take family here from out of town and always have a great experience.  I think it would be hard to actually be disappointed with this place, unless you have sky high expectations. Note: When I said the wait staff was competent that is just a base expectation for comfortable dining for me.  The wait staff here is more than competent and are always friendly with prompt service.  Of all the times I've been here there was only once when I wasn't happy with service and that was with a new waiter, who we've had since then without issue.  The service is certainly one of the reasons I keep coming back.",0.9973,0.731,0.206,0.064,0.5633781538326994

My boss also used to frequent this place in the ""good ol' days"", so she was excited when I suggested it for lunch today. Miller's is such a great slice of Chicago.

This made me happy since I always have to be gauche and stir my tea with a knife or a straw.  Moving on to the food: huge menu with a lot of choices ranging from ribs to salads to sandwiches and everything in between. I didn't eat much dinner last night so I was plenty hungry when we sat down. I settled on a prime rib sandwich. It came on rye bread which I thought was odd since I was expecting a french roll or something along those lines. The rye bread was a little overpowering, but it was a decent sandwich. Served on the side were mashed potatoes, which were a little cold, but not bad enough to stop me from eating them. My boss ordered a cheeseburger and I had serious food envy when it arrived.

No joke. No one of sound mind and able body would CHOOSE to buy their ale at Miller's Pub. Say what you will about the moral fabric of America but the woof and warp of said fabric hasn't come so loose that a person of reasonable stock would knowingly waste their scratch here, right? RIGHT?!? I guess it kinda reeks of history. The smattering of Chicago sports stars from bygone eras behind the bar and the tribute to Bill Veeck would lead you to believe that Miller's Pub was once a Chicago institution. If that was indeed the case then it's definitely resting on its laurels now, and, frankly, it could use a kick in the seat to stay remotely palatable. Even the bartenders look like relics from the days of Richard J. Daley, and one could be forgiven for thinking that the clout gravy train is the only think keeping these gentlemen employed. I paid too much for a couple of nondescript beers and cocktails (this much I expected!), was met with a scowl from the bartender after asking to pick up my friend's tab, and promptly left after guzzling my drink. This drinking outing wasn't egregiously offensive so much as it was egregiously plain: It could've happened in Truckee, Milwaukee, Kentucky, or one of those bland amusement park restaurants.

The dish usually comes with a waterlogged corn cob which goes back to the kitchen. Veggies get a good hard boiling so don't be looking for elegant flavor profiles. This meal and the big pint of Guinness that precedes it comes to the table fast as the waitstaff are pros and don't mess up your orders or get confused . The busboys are also quick to remove used plates so you don't have to stare at the carnage while conversing. The ribs keep me coming back when I am in the mood for pub food and Miller's is within walking distance. I can put up with the crowding and the resultant din for the reliable grub and the price is fair. My dining partner swears by (and always orders) the deep fried chicken and I have had the liver and onions which was good but drowning in au jus which can lead to some splashing. I don't think I would dream of ordering a steak here -save that for Ruth's Chris or Gibson's nor Mexican food...but simply prepared basic dishes with limp fries or a baked potato are probably a safe bet. Don't expect steamed vegetables though or any artsy plating techniques. I think the sommelier and the butter captain were let go a while back.

Now we aren't just a bunch of grungy hobo students - we're just grad students! We were immediately told that they wouldn't split a check for us. What the hell? Who doesn't split checks? So then we were told there was an ATM across the street at CVS. We went over and CVS was closed. WTF? So we went to 7/11 instead and got cash back.

On one hand, I always thought the old-school touches and decor were interesting, such as that they give you lemon-scented finger wipes after your meal, and the pics of celebs that have eaten here over the years throughout the place. The portion sizes for the most part here are decent, and I do like the fact they have an expansive menu that is obviously Greek-inspired. I also wasn't aware until looking at other reviews that this place does have a 4am license, which isn't bad at all. But on the other hand, I think more often than not I've ran into having food that goes towards being mediocre and uninspiring, but not totally bad. And I also wasn't a fan of their decision to go smoke-free in 2006, but do also respect their right that they made this decision on their own accord(no thanks to Illinois nanny lawmakers that unnecessarily completely took free choice away from all Illinois private businesses a year later, and passed a state ban). So I guess my verdict is that it isn't bad, but it isn't my first choice either when I want a sit-down meal. I prefer Exchequer down the street over Miller's Pub, but Miller's is still serviceable for a meal or for an occasional drink.

Nice and cozy inside, I sat at the bar since I was by myself.  The bar tender was friendly, but the pours were a bit on the small side.  I ordered an open faced prime rib sandwich au jus, which was served as a slice of prime rib on top of a slice of sourdough bread.  The prime rib tasted fine, and it was nice to have a reasonable portion instead of an over sized serving leaving you in a food coma that a lot of places are serving these days.  It was the price which kept the fourth star just out of reach.  The food I had was fine, but it's just wasn't up to par with my expectations based on the pricing.  3 1/2 stars.",0.9319,0.89,0.11,0.0,0.5244047619047619

2008-08-25,2.0,"When we moved to the Loop after 5+ years in the Gold Coast, our biggest disappointment was the complete lack of restaurants. Having both worked in the Loop for years, we never really thought about what it would be like to live in the area in terms of dining after normal business hours, weekends, and outside of lunch places. It didn't take us long to realize we were pretty much screwed. Luckily, we go out to dinner a lot and cook at home as well, so we don't strictly rely on having to grab something right near our condo, but clearly on occasions, that option is incredibly important. Shortly after our move, we found Miller's Pub which we initially thought would be our ""savior"". Their menu is diverse and reasonably priced - the ribs are great as is their open faced turkey sandwich, pulled pork, and mozz sticks. The salads often leave something to be desired and don't seem to have the freshest vegetables. On top of it, food service is EXTREMELY QUICK - especially when calling in an order for pick-up which is generally how we choose to eat MP (at home) as opposed to in the restaurant which is generally packed with tourists.  However, take-out while seemingly a great option has become our point of contempt for Millers Pub. On many many occasions, we've been told over the phone that ""carry-out isn't being accepted today as the restaurant is too busy"". We've expressed that we are local, regular patrons and for lack of a better description have been told to ""F off"". I've asked what the policy is if I come into the restaurant, sit down to eat, order, and when it comes out ask for it to be wrapped to go? I was ignored. Carlos is one of the managers and really the only person that I will deal with when ordering from there as he is genuinely a nice guy who recognizes that you treat regulars with respect. The other managers are the old school guys who have been there forever - this surprises me most, because they come from an era in which respect, both in and out of dining establishments, is regarded as imperative.  The two star rating comes from a combination of higher marks for food and convenience and abysmal marks for customer service.  I guess we're the morons for continuing to patronize this place after numerous such experiences, but sometimes lack of options lead to compromise.",0.9787,0.829,0.112,0.058,0.49507602186173616

It is reminiscent of an era when The Loop was the place to be, when the Palmer House (which is a few doors down) was the place to stay, and long nights started at the Trader Vic's or Jimmy Wong's and ended at Chez Paree. The restaurant reeks of old-time elegance. The wood paneled walls are covered in faux-classic paintings in imitation glided frames. Everywhere are signed photos of celebrity visitors: Lou Rawls, a youngish James Whitmore, Larry Storch as Agarn, Miss Peggy Lee. The handful of color photos (a young Roger Ebert, Jay Leno) stick out, and their color loss makes them seem older than the black and whites. There are some concessions to the march of time -- incongruous flat screen TVs -- but in general, your dinner could have taken place any time over the past 50 years. And that includes the food. You don't have to get a steak or chop: there are a few seafood offerings, some basic Italian (veal parmigiana anyone?), and some salads. But don't expect to eat light here. The prime rib starts at 10 ounces and goes up to 20. On the other hand, there's a London Broil special (Who serves London Broil any more?) for only 10 bucks. And it's not bad.

All the drinks I've ever gotten here were pretty strong and mixed well, so that's an obvious plus.

Those familiar with this Chicago institution know better. It was originally opened in 1935 by the Miller family and purchased by the Gallios brothers in 1950. The four young men couldn't afford to change the sign, so it remained Miller's. The restaurant is still owned by the family, and although only one of the brothers is still alive, he or one of the next generation is usually present. The bar itself stretches the length of the north side of the building, with a row of booths across from it and barstools facing the street. Most of the time it's filled with regulars, but the place gets really packed when there are conventions or festivals. The restaurant is unpretentious. Unadorned dark wood tables in cushionless booths make you feel like you're in a place with some history. Of course, that's helped by the pictures of celebrities and sports figures dating back over 60 years! Two of them are Chicago sports legend Bill Veeck (who still has his own corner) and the venerable Frank Sinatra. Miller's menu has multiple personalities, with the sandwiches and wings you expect to find at a pub, and the fare of an Italian Steakhouse, plus eggs and many varieties of broiled fish. The creme de la creme, though, are their ribs. Those are what they're really known for and are considered some of the best in town, in a city that has stiff competition in the BBQ arena. Just don't expect a whole lot of frills. Their balsamic dressing is curiously similar to Italian. My server may have made a mistake, but I didn't really care because, whatever it was, it was good!

My salmon was a little overcooked, but my Texan friend said his butt steak was one of the best he'd ever had, and you know how Texans are about their meat. Service is no-nonsense.

2005-09-25,4.0,"this is a great place to hang out and its one of the few places in the loop areas that serves food until 4am, which is great if you're hungry for something more than white hen or 7-11.  the atmosphere is pretty loud, people go here to get drunk but hey,  nothing wrong with that at all!",0.8451,0.803,0.17,0.027,0.6444444444444445
2005-09-10,3.0,"This reminds me of some of the old school Italian pizza joints that have the walls cluttered with photographs of celebrities from the 50s-80s. It's a large, cavernous space that serves pretty average meat-and-potatoes type fair, but with some Greek items. I would recommend this to tourists who don't like good ethnic food over some chain.",0.0583,0.793,0.113,0.093,0.44107142857142856
2005-07-30,4.0,"Miller's Pub is an eclectic restaurant and watering hole that has been around forever in downtown, although it moved from another spot to its current location on Wabash a few years ago. There is a Greek slant on dishes like its flaky spinach pie. Otherwise you can have typical favorites like lamb, turkey, and prime rib. The walls are littered with TV's, memorabilia and celebrity headshots, although I think the stars have moved on to hotter spots nowadays.",0.7783,0.902,0.098,0.0,0.25
2005-07-14,3.0,I've been to Miller's a few times.  The food is decent.  The alcohol fairly inexpensive.  There is a lot of seating.  The things that bothered me most about it was that it was very very very noisy and also extremely smoky.,-0.5907,0.884,0.0,0.116,0.5927777777777777
