They've always got the same chef in the kitchen so you know exactly what you're getting. The owners are the nicest people you'll meet and they're always warm and welcoming. I do miss the live music on the weekends but the atmosphere and music choice (traditional and Ethio jazz) is truly an experience.

We love spicy so we had the spicy chicken (doro wat) and the spicy berbere sauce beef option.

2017-03-20,5.0,"Ras Dashen was the restaurant that introduced me and my regular dining group of friends to the wonders of Ethiopian food, and for this I'll always be grateful to the folks who run this place! An ever-expanding list of things I love about this place: - you have the option of sitting at both tables or mesobs (sp?) (wicker chairs and stools). The former is better if you're in a group but the latter makes for a more intimate experience because you have to lean into the food - you get to eat with your hands! I'm Indian, and I've grown up eating with my hands almost exclusively. I find cutlery cumbersome and so I especially love cuisines that forgo it. - for fellow spice-lovers, this place BRINGS it. Order anything with the berbere sauce, and you'll be blessed with gentle drops of spice sweat - the prices! you get to try out multiple dishes and starters for under $25 - the Ethiopian tea here is the best I've had at an Ethiopian restaurant. Just don't drink it while you're eating because the hot tea does not play well off of the spicy food. My go-to dishes here are the asa-wat (tilapia in the AMAZEBALLS berbere sauce) and doro-wat (spicy chicken stew with boiled eggs) and the shiro-wat (ts chickpea counterpart). All of the side dishes are commendable, especially the gomen and mesir wat (spicy pureed lentils). The sambusa (especially the spinach filled ones) are a must try! The service is just about okay. They're not very chatty but offer good recommendations, and service can be a bit slow because the place is often packed and the food takes time to be ready. What I love most about this place is that Ethiopian food is very inclusive. There are options galore for my vegan and vegetarian friends, and for people like me who don't eat pork or beef due to personal preferences.

Because a fellow colleague wanted to sample some Ethiopian food for the first time, this was the restaurant I recommended and a mutual friend accommodated us. We ordered one chicken, one lamb, one seafood, and a round of vegetarian menu items. The chicken was doro wat, which was dark meat chicken and boiled egg in a spicy berbere sauce. The lamb dish was yebeg de berbere, succulent lamb stew bursting with bold spices. The seafood dish was asa wat, fillet tilapia in a dark berbere sauce that had been prepared from roasted, ground flaxseed. As to the vegetarian offerings, we had telba shimbera misser wat -- puréed chickpeas, split peas, and flaxseed in a dark berbere sauce. There was kik alicha, which were puréed yellow split peas cooked with onions, garlic, ginger, and green peppers. We even had tikil gomen alicha -- spiced cabbage, potato, and carrot stew. And a final vegetarian item we ordered was ethio salata, which came as romaine lettuce, green onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, and jalapeños. There wasn't one item that we did not enjoy thoroughly, evident from the empty platter when we were done.

FYI, if you get a Groupon, you are limited on your entrée choices.  The dinners include two entrées and three sides.   On our first visit, we had the meat entrée:    Meat (chicken/beef): #18: Doro Wat (chicken) #30: Zilzil Alicha (beef) Sides: #3: Yeqaysur Salata #7: Qosta #8: Dublin Atkilt The meat was by far my favorite, with the beef really being the highlight.  It had some heat at first, but we quickly got used to it. The chicken entree was tasty, but difficult to eat since it had bones in it.  Soft injera bread + fingers + trying not to be a savage and dig with your fingers/finger nails?  Meh.   The sides were good, but the beets (#3) were my least favorite. Service on our first visit was attentive but unobtrusive.  Our waters were refilled.  I also ordered a ginger ale, and Debra had a ginger beer...which was of the Jamaican variety. On our second visit, we had the veggie dinner: Veggie: - Dupa Wat (pumpkin) #15: Misserana Bowmia (okra and lentils) Sides: #2: Ethiopian Salata #11: Kik Alicha #12: Yequay Tiki gomen While I'm a veggie fan, it was much less filling in the end. Both entrées were good, with the pumpkin being my fave. The pea and lentil sides were good, though the salad (#2) was very much like an American salad (with jalapeños).  It was also difficult to eat, interestingly enough. I would skip it. I had a hot tea this time around, and Debra had the ginger ale!  Service the second time around was pretty absent, which is odd because we were the ONLY ONES dining in!  The server never came to check on us or ask how our meal was.  He only came by to deliver the check! My friend's water glass went totally empty, and then she had to ask for her water to be refilled.  Overall, the food is good and totally worth a try if you've never had Ethopian and are willing to try (or have had it and enjoy it!).  The decor is interesting, beautiful, and colorful.  You can sit at a traditional table (like we did!).  The restrooms are also clean - AND they have the paper seat covers. :)  Little details can be icing on the cake.

This experience was disappointing. First time ordering an appetizer (sambusa) which was fairly flavorless. Ordered three entrees and 4 sides, all of which were just OK. The potatoes in one of the dishes were a bit under done. The lamb dish was very liquidy, and was poured right on top of our spinach side, making for an overly soggy injera base and a ruined side. The service was perhaps the most disappointing. Our server brought out the injera platter with our 4 sides and set it on the table. A minute later he brought one entree out. It was a full 10 minutes before he brought out the other two. Our basket of injera was empty at that point so we asked for some more. We waited another 5 minutes before he returned with it. He was not very apologetic about any of the delays. This is Labor Day, so perhaps they had a skeleton crew, or the B team, but if so, why bother being open? It didn't seem like there was a manager there and it was just the servers running the show.  This might explain why no one made any attempt to come over when it was clear we were displeased and why there was nothing taken off our bill either.  Speaking of the bill, this restaurant has definitely increased its prices to the point that it has become very expensive for what it is. I haven't read the reviews for this restaurant in a long while since we are semi-regulars and have always enjoyed it in the past. But judging from the more recent posts, it does appear that they are struggling a bit, especially on the service end of things.

The night we went they were even having a concert with an Ethiopian superstar that evening. With Ras Dashen being so big, it got super busy as the night went on. With that our service started dragging.

Despite any service kinks, the food was really quite tasty. They were out of honey wine though! That was a sad moment for me because I feel like I need some of that strong stuff when dining Ethiopian! You really can't go wrong with anything you order food-wise. When I went we ordered a variety of veggies items and then a main entree.  What happens at an Ethiopian restaurant is you get a big piece of injera which serves as a 'plate' for all your side dishes. Every side you pick is served around the injera with your main entree plopped down in the middle! Some items are spicy but are noted when they will be. Your also served a bowl of injera to use as your fork. There is no silverware at Ethiopian spots so wash your hands and dig in!!

2016-03-31,4.0,"I've been wanting to try Ethiopian food for the longest time! Finally had a chance, and decided to try this one out. For those that are uninitiated, my disclaimer is that you shouldn't look at me to initiate you, as I never had Ethiopian food before.  From my initial experience, this is what I noticed. You eat with your hands, hence there is a nice and useful sign near the back that says ""Washing Station"", for those peeps who likes to handle their food with germ-free hands, as there is no silverware involved. And, as a person who is familiar with Indian food (NOT that I am saying it justifies comparison, so put away your pitchforks and flaming bags of poo..... for now) there are some similarities -- instead of naan, Ethiopian food involves a, as one of my friends called it, a sham-wow looking carb, called Injera. The dishes are generally pureed and sauteed (sure, there are exceptions), and with some sauce involved; perfect to soak and pick up with the Injera.  We got the following: 7) Qosta -- some pureed/sauteed spinach with Ethiopian spices 8) Diblik Atkilt -- Green beans, potatoes, zucchini, and carrots, and mixed up and delicious! 9) Ayib -- cheese 11) Kik Alicha -- pureed split peas 19) Doro Alica -- chicken with a boiled egg, in a pretty tasty sauce All of the above were delicious!! My only ""gripe"" is that it's hard to eat all that withOUT Injera, so if you're carb-conscious, you might need to figure out a crafty way of eating said dishes. But overall, VERY tasty and the staff was super nice and friendly. BATHROOM REVIEW: As mentioned, they have a separate, stand-alone, out in the public, faucet with soap and paper towels so you can wash your hands, before, during, or after the deal (finger-licking good!). They also have a bathroom for all your urination needs. Inside, there is a stall and urinal, which were super clean. I was very impressed. It was very modern as well. Sit or squat? Sit!!!

(homey) My friend decided on the vegetarian sampler.  I ordered the yebeg alicha (lamb stew).  I tried the honey wine to start, but in my opinion I think maybe it perhaps it would have been a better dessert wine option. Dishes are served on a platter laid with a giant round of injera.  Injera resembles a large spongy pancake (made of teff flour and a sourdough starter, which results in a slightly tangy taste and production of air pockets ).  Injera is used in place of utensils, in which you envelope the food with your hands.  (There is a wash station in the back to clean your filthy paws before and after).  ""Ib"" is a soft cheese made from buttermilk.  Tasty and mild, and I actually enjoyed it more as an accompaniment with both my lamb dish and the spinach ""qosta"".  Of course, I'm the kind of person that puts cheese on my cheese. ""Misser wat"" is a puree of red lentils in a berbere sauce (chili peppers, garlic, ginger, basil spice).  It was delicious, and gone rather quickly. ""Yeqay tikil gomen"" is a sweet and sour red cabbage. My main dish was the ""Yebeg Alicha"".  It is a lamb stew compiled inside another piece of the injera and quite flavorful and soft including two of the bones, and many chunks of the lamb.  The pieces off the bone were tender from being cooked in the alicha sauce (turmeric flavor).   We left feeling full, but not overly ""unbutton your pants"" full, and I think we ordered just enough.  I would certainly come back.  The service was also good, greeted on the way in and thanked on the way out.  Attentive staff.",0.9898,0.884,0.113,0.003,0.4340236686390533

I think I have a new favorite Ethiopian place You have your choice of traditional Ethiopian (4 chairs around a small, round table) or standard dining seating. We chose traditional- it created a casual, relaxed vibe and I found it to be way more comfortable. Only con is you have to be careful not to drop any food, as it's going to land on your lap instead of the table. Everything we ordered was flavorful and delicious. Asa wat (tilapia) was incredible- their berbere sauce is nice and spicy without overwhelming the dish. The yebeg alicha (lamb in a mild sauce) was really good- my only complaint was it was served on the bone and it was really fatty, so we didn't get a lot of meat. The service was good. Food came in a good amount of time. Our server checked back frequently on how we were doing and ensured our waters were full and we had plenty of napkins (which I appreciated, considering my mildly-OCD hand cleaning does not bode well with this style of dining).",0.9958,0.711,0.262,0.026,0.594411860540893

There were plenty of dishes for all of us. AND the food was exceptionally flavorful. My favorite was kasser wat. The vegan & vegetarian group tried all the 13 dishes available that night (from the platter). The meat-eaters tried quite a few and LOVED all of them. The staff was incredibly polite and helpful. The owner was so incredibly polite and she clearly takes pride in her restaurant :) If there *is* something negative (if I am trying to be picky), the service was a bit slower than I would like.

2015-07-24,2.0,"The food is OK but the wait might as well kill you. Don't expect great service either, (especially if you have a Groupon.) The only reason this place isn't getting one star is because the food was pretty authentic. It tasted decent but it's not the best Ethiopian food we've ever had. It took my bf and me 20 minutes to order and another 30 for our food to come. We would have understood if the place had been busy, but there were still many empty tables both inside and outside. (You can be in and out of most restaurants in that amount of time, so this is definitely not the place if you don't like sitting idly for an hour before the food comes. Also probably not a good idea to come here if you like friendly and efficient service because the servers are extremely uncoordinated and didn't seem to know what was going on throughout the entire experience.) To our surprise, our server actually turned out to be the manager. She introduced herself when we sat down but took 20 minutes, 2 bathroom trips, and 7 levels on cut the rope, to come by with our water. That was when we finally got to place our food order. After half an hour we saw our food come up on the counter, at which point 2 servers and 2 of the cooks argued about it for a few minutes. Then I guess one of the other servers got the manager and she came by our table asking if we had a Groupon. We did indeed have a Groupon, which we had presented to one of the servers at the very beginning when we sat down. She then repeated ""you guys didn't tell me. You should have told me"" a bunch of times before getting the cooks to fix our order and bring us the food.  After the meal some random server guy presented us with a bill for $41, which we were very confused about since we gave the manager our Groupon. We asked the server guy what happened and he said he'd double check with the manager, who was on the computer toward the back of the room. It took her 15 minutes after the guy talked to her to come by and give us another check. This time, the check was for something we didn't even order. We finally left after she said we were good to go because she had already processed the Groupon. So basically we wasted 20 more minutes after we were done for them to sort out the confusion when we could have left right away. We will NOT be going back.

I would consider myself to have an open and accepting palate for a variety of cuisines, but I have never tried Ethiopian. It was great. Between the 10 of us, we got 3 huge plates (I'm sure there's a real name for these large silver plates...but I don't know it). Each ""plate"" had multiple sides and entrees all laid out on the ""injera"" which is a sponge like bread. The way it works is you pick up injera (there's also a basket next to you) and you scoop up the meat and veggie goodies on your injera and eat it that way. No silverware. I'm kind of a germophobe but after tasting the amazing flavors of the entrees I got over it and just shoved my food onto my injera and directly into my mouth.  I don't even know what we tried but it was all great. We just told the waitress to bring us whatever she thought was good because we had no idea. We tried multiple chicken, lamb, and beef entrees. It's very similar to curry style but the sides are very unique and really add great flavors. It's a family run and operated restaurant and they just really seem to be passionate about sharing Ethiopian food with Chicagoans.  Minus a star for atmosphere.

2015-05-15,2.0,"Very disappointing return visit tonight.  We had a groupon for a veggie combo with three sides.  After ordering that plus another kitfo entree and a few extra sides, we also ordered chickpea and beef sambusas.  We also asked it the bar could make mojitos and were told yes, they could.  About 20 or more mins later, the drinks finally arrived and appeared to be made with no simple syrup.  So I asked for some sugar, which took another 10 or more mins.  All this time, still waiting on the apps (which was not good with a hungry kindergartener in tow).  Sambusas finally arrived and were teeny--very very small and pretty bland.  Apps were polished off fast and then the long wait for entres arrived.  Waiting.  Added some more sugar to the $9 mojito.  Waited some more...finally, asked a waiter to check on our order.  No word.  Asked a second waiter.  Finally, original waiter comes back to tell us our order was lost (duh!).  We're 65 mins in at this point.  Are told they will prioritize our order if we re-place it.  Go through menu again and patiently reorder, including a repeated request for well done kitfo, not raw, not red.  15 more mins go by. Food finally arrives.  Kitfo is raw, red.  Exactly NOT how we ordered it, TWICE.  Ask for them to take it back and cook it some more.  Less than 5 mins later, it's back at our table looking much as before.  At this point, I'm beyond caring and just want this meal to be over and get my kid to bed. We eat the food which was ok, not bad, but not great (and definitely NOT worth the wait).  Ask for the bill and they comped us ONE of the four beverages we ordered (and really only because an hour forty into this fiasco my husband says to the waiter, ""I think you owe my wife a free drink). Big deal.  Almost exactly TWO HOURS LATER we leave.  Not because we'd been lingering over a delicious meal but simply because our evening was wasted on a mediocre meal.  My advice?  If you want some delicious Ethiopean food, go down the street to Awash.  Occasionally, the wait is longish, but the food is always well worth it.  And they won't sell you a $9 mojito that they don't really know how to make.

It was pretty busy, so I would definitely suggest a reservation if you go on a weekend. Our server was quiet but very nice and accommodating. We ordered two entrees - the Yebeg Wat (lamb stew in a spicy sauce) and the Kitfo Tere (Ethiopian steak tartare). Our server made sure we knew what steak tartare was, which I thought was nice of her. For sides, we ordered Komodoro Salata (diced cucumber, tomato, onion and jalapeño salad), Tikil Gomen Alicha (mildly spiced cabbage, potato and carrot stew), Qosta (spinach cooked with onions, garlic and spices), Ib (soft cheese made with cultured buttermilk), and Yeqay Tikil Gomen (sweet and sour red cabbage, Ethiopian style). It all came out on a large round of injera, which you use to sort of scoop and eat everything with your hands.  Everything was absolutely delicious! The lamb stew and steak tartare were delectable. All of the sides were super tasty too. We also each had a couple of Ethiopian beers that the server recommended, and we really enjoyed those as well. (Unfortunately, I can't remember the beer names.)  The restaurant also felt very warm and welcoming - kind of low lighting, some traditional and non-traditional seating, beautiful paintings decorating the walls, and just a feeling of comfort.

The chicken was good though. Fell off the bone easily and was easy to rip into little shareable pieces. Read the menu carefully if you like your meat cooked. A lot of the beef is only slightly cooked and comes out looking basically raw. Also I would not recommend the cheese side, but the cabbage one is pretty good. Service is pretty slow, even when it was pretty empty. Only one waiter was working, but granted, it was a Monday night. The table next to us ordered maybe 5 minutes after us but were still waiting for their food when we left.  A little pricey, but Ethiopian food tends to be in general, so no complaints there.

2014-11-30,2.0,"The food was great, although this was my first time eating Ethiopian, so I don't have a good comparison. Highly recommend the soup and the Qategna. Let me preface my review by saying we had 4 servers throughout the course of the evening. So I'm assuming this is part of why some of the following things happened. 1) Someone in our party of 4 ordered a Coke, server brings back a Diet Coke. OK, that's not the biggest deal in the world. After this, in a span of about 20 minutes, we had at least 2 servers come by and ask what we'd like to drink, even though we already had drinks. Slightly confusing. 2) No explanation of the menu at all. No one asked ""first time having Ethiopian?"" where it might have been helpful to get a brief rundown of recommendations. 3) I ordered a side of cheese with my entree, and the cheese (Ib) never came. We asked one of our servers about it, and he said he'd bring it with another drink for me, and about 20 minutes passed without either. Finally another server came by and we asked for the cheese and she brought it in 30 seconds.  4) Had to wait a really long time to get drink refills or extra bread. And it's hard to eat this food without bread. 5) Piggybacking on the no one explained how to eat Ethiopian to us n00bs, our sides came before our entrees, so we started to eat the bread on the platter, and we were basically scolded by the server when he brought our entrees and told us to put our extra bread on the platter so he could put the entrees down.  6) When the entrees WERE put down, the vegetarian food was touching the meats, which was a bummer for the person in our party who was vegetarian.  7) We waited at least 30 minutes for the bill. Someone dropped off some dessert menus and mints and then disappeared and we had to flag someone down to get our bill. 8) Bill finally comes, one of our party members doesn't get the receipt copy he has to sign. Have to wait again for someone to flag down. I'm bummed we had such bad service, as it was not cheap for the 4 of us.

2014-11-23,5.0,"Ras Dashen, I love you. You were my first experience with Ethiopian and I'm now spoiled. I ventured out to try another couple popular Ethiopian places in Chicago and they just can't hold a candle to Ras Dashen. it's all. About. The food. If you don't know anything about Ethiopian, look it up or read some of these reviews before you go so you know what to expect. You will not get silverware. You will be sharing. The service is much more hands-off; what you may consider mandatory, they might consider intrusive. You'll have to ask for what you want - be it a description,  recommendation or the check. (Get over it RLR, you sound like a real peach, people who get off insulting wait staff should eat at home.) The first time I ate Ethiopian, I didn't know what to expect, and I wasn't even sure I liked it or not, but found myself craving more on the ride home. Since you can look up the whats/hows of Ehiopian food anywhere, just know you are getting the real deal at Ras Dashen, and it's fresh, homemade, and so incredibly delicious it blows my mind. Flavor on flavoroids with a  side of extra flavor with flavor on top kind of flavor. You can't compare it with Indian food, but it has that level of spice intensity: several different flavor profiles at once combining, with the undercurrent of berbere - which yes, can get a little hot. I don't find Ethiopian especially hot, but I like really hot food. I don't think I'd recommend it to somebody who eats nothing but bland food (sorry for them). I am a pretty picky eater but can be kind of adventurous. You can't go wrong with anything you order here - it's all made with so much love you're practically high after you eat. My favorites are all vegetarian; the red & yellow lentils are the best; the pumpkin is incredible, and if you get the Ib (cheese) get the spinach and eat them together (wipes drool from chin). The meats are also delicious but I don't have room for them after my veggie favorites. The pointers: make a reservation if you go on a weekend night - it can get busy, and they have awesome assorted live jazz. Drink the Ethiopian beer, and pace yourself - you don't know how rib-sticking injera is until about 15 minutes after you finish eating. Don't go with super picky/inflexible eaters as you WILL be sharing, and may be sitting at a slightly awkward low rattan chair.  2nd date yes, first date no.",0.9961,0.8,0.161,0.039,0.6052020202020201

The food is actually very good, but to say that everything is overpriced is one hell of an understatement. $2 for a can of soda is completely outrageous.  I suppose I could have overlooked the highway robbery in pricing if it weren't for the disgraceful service we received. It took over 5 minutes for a rotund busboy to waddle a couple of glasses of waters to our table and then another 10 minutes for him to waddle back to us and see if we were ready to order. That's when I realized he was our server. After taking our orders, he waddled off and we didn't hear from him for another 10 minutes, still waiting for our sodas to arrive. Since we were seated across from the kitchen, we could hear everyone screaming and arguing with each other. This pretty much went on for the duration of our dinner. He brought an enormous tray with just the 2 sides we ordered along with the injera in a basket without the entrees. He then went over to the kitchen window and screamed for our entrees. After waiting a couple more minutes, he brought the 2 bowls containing our entrees and literally dumped both bowls in the tray like he was feeding a couple of hogs their slop and waddled off again. I could understand the slow service if it were a busy night, but there was never more than 2 other tables occupied the whole time we were in there. I had to flag him down for some napkins as well as a refill of water and another soda and then he disappeared for the rest of our meal. I had to actually get up and look for him for the check. After dropping off the bill he waddled off to the back of the room and sat down at a table hidden by the bar, while we sat there for ANOTHER 10 minutes with our payment rotting in the checkbook. I was losing my patience by then, but the only time I was about to get up out of my seat again was to leave, and I was very close to doing that by that point.  I finally had to flag down another server that had just started to ask for our server. The second server walked back with our check and spoke to our server before closing out our ripoff of a bill. As much as I argued with my partner who kept trying to give our server a decent tip, I made him settle with me on $2, which is $2 more than that slovenly server deserved.  I'm still baffled by the 5 Star reviews for this restaurant, because there are other Ethiopian restaurants in the area with better food and exceptional service for much less.

When the bill came, everyone had paid cash except one person. Naturally, the gratuity is already figured in with a larger group so the one person did not add a tip onto the remainder of the bill and paid with their credit card. Upon checking the bank statement a few days ago, Ras Dashen had tacked on a tip even though the receipt signed for did not allow that. What the hell??! What kind of restaurant does that???

The service is by far the worst I have experienced in my life so far. And No, I am not exaggerating. The wait staff is rude and wouldn't care less for customer. At one occasion the staff served us the wrong dish and when we complained they exchanged it for the right dish. Forget about apologizing they charged us for both the dishes, coz we took a bite from the wrong dish - Seriously! And the manager/waitress (whoever she was) had no decency to apologize and gave us attitude instead. Second time they gave us somebody's used tissue - yes they did. Third time - yes we were stupid enough to go a third time - they seated us next to the toilet and when we asked the waitress (the same rude waitress) to change our table she said thats all she could give us (and mind you it was a sunday night with half the restaurant empty and I had a reservation too) and had no other place for us. She actually said take it or leave. Wow! did that just happen. Though I would like to mention that all these occasions the owner was present and apologized but it makes no difference when you have such a rude staff and lousy service.

2014-04-13,1.0,"CELIAC GLUTEN FREE DINERS BEWARE:  Its a shame to have to write a bad review about a place I've frequented for years, but I feel like I have no choice.  My fiance has a gluten allergy, and we loved Ras Dashen because they serve a gluten free injera, which we've been told is actually a more authentic version of the dish and is always delicious.  They ask that you call a day in advance and special order it.  Last week, we called to place our order, and they said they had one waiting for us and that we should come that night.  We did.  When we were seated, we explained to them that we had called ahead for the gluten free injera, the waitress said she understood, and we proceeded to order.   Everything was delicious, but about half way through our meal, we asked for some extra gluten free injera, and the waitress told us that we weren't actually eating gluten free injera to begin with... they had served us the regular version by mistake.  We were very upset about this because it meant that my fiance would be very sick for several days, but we didn't raise our voices or cause a scene.  Although it was a very serious mistake, we understand that mistakes are made and people aren't perfect.  What really bothered me, however, was that they ended up CHARGING US FOR IT ANYWAY.  We didn't ask for anything free and didn't act rude or make any demands.   However, upon finding out that they had served my fiance what is essentially poison for her, they took one of the $12 entrees off our tab and stuck us with a bill that was more than $70.  Again, we just quietly paid and left, but this made me furious.  They made a huge mistake and didn't make it right.  Even offering to take half off (considering only one of the two of us was served something that made them sick) would have been a decent gesture.  In a restaurant, when you are served food that makes you sick, even after repeatedly and explicitly requesting food that doesn't make you sick, you normally wouldn't expect to have to pay for the food after its been accidentally served to you, or at least you wouldn't expect to pay nearly full price.     My fiance has in fact been sick for several days because of this, and in spite of the fact that we've been regular customers there for years, their lack of sympathy and refusal to make this right assured that we will never return.  There are plenty of other great Ethiopian places in the area.",-0.8457,0.73,0.123,0.147,0.5594262621436534

I can't really handle spicy stuff and so I usually just order the vegetarian sampler, which includes 5 generous vegetarian sides. I can easily split this into two meals. Everything is just perfect--their gomen and qosta is perfectly cooked, their yeqay tikil gomen is addictive, and their tikil gomen alicha is the most comfortable comfort food ever. Oh, and their injera is perfect flavored and cooked--probably why their qategna appetizer is my favorite (can't get enough injera). Their honey wine is also a fantastic treat. Their service is also great--we probably average a meal there every 2 weeks (we live very close) and they are friendly and speedy every time, without fail. Their take-out service is also fast and reliable (and I think they might actually give you larger portions...)

We were there on a Sunday around 830, and they had live music that ended pretty early, around 9.  The music was not of the Ethiopian persuasion so it was a bit odd atmospherically, but that's okay, it didn't last long.   Unlike other restaurants, this one has a veggie sampler platter but no meat sampler platter.  A little disappointing, but if you get an entree that you really like, you get more of it, and aren't fighting with your friends for the tiny amount left in a sampler, so I guess it isn't necessarily a bad thing.  I got the asa tibs (tilapia and veggies with ginger) and my boyfriend got the gored gored (brisket with shallots, butter, hot pepper paste).  The misser wat and kik alicha (red lentils and split peas, respectively) rounded out the meal.  He absolutely loved his brisket, and finally started coming around to Ethiopian food because of it!  I liked my fish, though I wouldn't say it was anything special.  It was mild, and I enjoyed it since I was pretending to be ""healthy"" after lunch at Pequod's but I should've gone for something heartier, in a dark spicy sauce.  I wouldn't bother with the fish unless you're pescetarian.  The sides were great, and I picked at a few more vegetarian sides when our vegan friends couldn't finish their sampler platter. I can't really say whether it's better or worse than the Diamond, but it's definitely a reliably yummy choice for Ethiopian in Chicago!  I would come back anytime, if I can convince my boyfriend not to hate injera so much....",0.9967,0.734,0.218,0.049,0.4804705215419501

I didn't care for the lamb at all. It was grey, chewy, and didn't have much flavor. The sides were the saving grace of the meal. Both lentils and cabbage were excellent.

Because of this concern of mine, I stayed far away from Ethiopian food not taking into account that I could go by myself or with one other person whose germs I trust (silly, I know).  So, I did just that and went with one other person, and I loved my experience at Ras Dashen! The bread is a sourdough flavor, and cold, but it is just the right balance with the traditional spices.  I love that each meal has a side that is just as filling and delicious as the entree portion.  My favorite side was the cabbage.  My favorite entree was the non-spicy chicken which was so tender, it fell immediately off the bone.   To top it off, the rice pudding dessert was the perfect combination of sweet and savory, and a nice way to end the meal.

Sometimes their dishes are phenomenal and sometimes they're mediocre and you never know what you're going to get. For example, my husband had gone with a friend but without me fairly recently and got the Shirro (chickpea flour stew) which we love at Ethiopian Diamond and said that Ras Dashen's version, while a little thin, had amazing flavor. So we went back and it was ""meh"" - he agreed that it wasn't nearly as good as when he'd had it a couple weeks prior. Additionally, their prices are a bit high (especially the lamb), though that can be forgiven if the food is delicious, it's just hard for it to be such a crap shoot on whether you're going to get mind-blowingly tasty food or stuff that is just okay.",0.9577,0.758,0.169,0.073,0.5525757575757576

The mains were doro wat and stewed lamb (the ones which were cubed). Doro wat I liked - it was one big piece of chicken in spicy thick gravy. Except that, the strength of the acidity compounded by the injera (which was very good btw) quickly got old.  the stewed lamb was disappointing. the lamb was smelly. I am not sure which portion of the lamb the meat came from, but it was unsavory. Would not try lamb or beef here next time.

This place has very friendly service and staff and if you just happen to come in on a packed day the wait is highly worth it as you will listen to sweet tunes of Afro- Latin beats or even some authentic tunes that take you to another country or land.  If you are not a person that likes eating with their hands this is not the place for you as the entire table is used for the tray served with goodies. The Doro Wat is amazing as it is chicken simmered in sauce and a hard boiled egg is placed in the center of this dish.

We summoned another server who was friendly and laid back but didn't seem particularly concerned with helping us. I'm all for relaxed, slow dining but this meal took way longer than anyone expected (3.5 hours). Service never did get better and we had to practically beg to get our drinks refilled. They would have made so much more money off our party if they were better about getting us drinks from the start, then refilling them. No complaints about the food or kitchen. Everything was flavorful, prepared well & they delivered what they advertise. We had fourteen entrees and side dishes, and the kitchen did well getting things right. I mostly preferred the veggie dishes, but that is probably due to my taste preferences.  We had an automatic 20% gratuity added to our bill.

Even the injera was the best I've had in terms of tenderness and clean flavor. The staff was uniformly gracious & welcoming, and coordinated our service very smoothly. The setting is a notch above the usual Ethio in Chicago -- there are more traditional Ethio low pedestal tables with comfy chairs as well as traditional American seating. The room is pleasantly decorated, and a nice mix of Ethio-themed music plays at a conversation- friendly level. The place was doing a lively business on our weekend visit -- deservedly so.

Ras Dashen pleasantly outdoes the other in scenery, soundtrack, service and taste.  Vegans can feel catered to as the restaurant provides the most ""omni-palatable"" collection of non-dairy, non-meat entrees I've ever noted in any cuisine.  Kik ALicha with Shiro and Salada is phenominal veg combo.  Mushroom Wat is incredible as you can order the Kik ALicha and Shiro as sides or my healthy choices like kale.   All that is thankfully under 20 dollars.  Gluten free peeps suffering with Celiac Disease can get Injera according to their needs too.  Sambusas might be the only thing the other restaurant can do  equally well yet Ras Dashan's Awase hot  sauce makes up for less Sambusa options.

The lamb could appear in larger pieces, but the combination was nicely cooked down to bring out all the sharp spices and flavors from the lamb. It was spicy, tender, and lots of moisture. Ironically, my friends who were not keen on communal dining loved it too. The Misser Wat came with pureed red lentil in a spicy berbere sauce. The buttery taste was heavier than the ones I had at other Ethiopian restaurants, so it is not something I would recommend. In contrast, the Gomen was very good as the slowed cooked chopped greens were nicely seasoned and complemented well with the lamb. Their injera was not too sour and it came with an abundant of soft spongy texture. Too bad I couldn't bring them back to Iowa but they do sell them for $1 per pound. Gluten-free injera is also available with advanced notice. The only serious complaint I had was their service. The servers were kind, down to earth, and gracious. However, the food took a long long time to arrive at our table, leaving us scrambling to grab a cab to catch our show. Even though the wait time for food to arrive tends to be longer at Ethiopian restaurants, but this was quite unusual especially since we were the only ones there for the good part of the evening. I would definitely be interested in coming back after having a chance to try a good number of other Ethiopian restaurants in Chicago. 3.5 stars for the experience.",0.9938,0.813,0.153,0.034,0.5267724867724868

Thankfully, I finally found another Ethiopian-food fan... with a car! So I finally had the option to try a place out. Ras Dashen was a good choice. There was a live band playing on a Sunday night, and we were seated (thankfully) towards the back and away from the band. (They were good, but it would have been a bit loud.) They have a full bar (surprisingly) and make their own mead (!) (which was pretty tasty). My guest and I did the vegetarian sampler, thinking it might not be enough food (you get 5 sides and a bunch of tasty, thin injerta). There were one or two I wasn't gonzo for, but overall the sides were very good. And I left unable to eat anything else. Bonus. I wish I could have tried the desserts or maybe one of the entrees (which past Ethiopian places have not had). The good news? It was good enough that I'll be back to have them.",0.9848,0.834,0.166,0.0,0.5679166666666666
2013-03-11,3.0,"For a long time my buddies and me wanted to try Ethiopian cuisine and thanks to Yelp, Ras Dashen - with its glowing reviews - was a unanimous choice. One thing you want to familiarize yourself with Ethiopian food is the Injera. And any side or entrée that you order on the menu comes with an Injera (a pancake kind of a thing which is spongy in texture and tangy in taste), and you can't substitute this for anything else. So, if you don't like the Injera, it might ruin the experience, but if you do warm up to its taste, the culinary experience is worth your time and money. Some of the meat entrée's you definitely want to try are the Doro wat (chicken) and Yebeg dereq tibs (lamb). Taste wise, nothing out of the world or mediocre, with most of the entrée's adjusting nicely to your palate. One more thing, this place doesn't have the capacity to seat a lot of people, so be advised if you're planning on going here on a Saturday or Friday night. And also the service is not quick; they take at least 20-25 minutes to get your food ready. So in the end, if you're looking to try a new cuisine or craving Ethiopian food, Ras Dashen is definitely not a bad place to stop by.",0.9739,0.841,0.131,0.028,0.5595117845117845

Several years ago I saw Ras Dashen being reviewed on Check, Please, and I thought: ""wait a second, thats the place right across from my grandma's house!"".  So one day I had to lie to grams that I couldn't come over for dinner, and go to RD.  I was amazed...it was so freaking good. The seating: either small rattan tables with carved wood and leather chairs in Ethiopian seating style, or regular tables.  I have eaten at either, the tables just have more space.   The food is brought in on a large round tray, covered with spongy sour injera bread.  Then the waitress brings out your food on plates, and slides them off the plate onto the tray.  This also comes with several pieces of injera bread in a basket.  You tear off a piece of bread, and scoop up the food with it, not using any utensils (yeah, make sure to wash your hands before you eat, people!). My usual order is number 27 (cubed pieces of beef in sauce), and its...to die for. As a side I get Ib, amazing cottage-cheesy stuff that goes great with the food. Watch out for 28-tartare steak means the meat is raw, so unless you like your beef uncooked, don't get that.  The steak is amazing, and the servings dont look huge because they are on a large tray.  I am usually completely full after half my meal (my bf and I share each other's orders), and have some leftovers to eat in the morning.  The service is always great, and clearly some people have unreasonable expectations that they will be served immediately when the place is packed.

She dumped the bowl on the plate of injera and that was it. Usually you have a few other odds and ends on the injera that's laid out on your plate, like some cabbage, lentils, salad, etc. but for this dish it was just this pitiful lump of food on the plate of injera. (I was actually so surprised I took a picture of it, like ""I know this can't be it!"") I had two beers, one of which I had to hunt her down (literally get out of my seat and go look for her, then ask someone at the bar where our waiter was) before I got it. The plate of food was $22 dollars or so, there was a tip already factored in so with the two beers it came to around $40. I knew in the moment I was displeased with the experience, but we were sending these people off and we had to leave before everyone else and I didn't want to make a stink and embarrass my friends at their going away meal. I held on to the receipt, thinking I'd call the restaurant later and complain, but never made a point to do it. Overall, a really disappointing experience.

Well, for me, Ras Dashen is a grand-slam, Phi Slamma Jamma five-star review. At least based on our single experience on a bone-chilling Monday night in November. Relatively speaking, we're Ethiopian-food neophytes.  First time was about five years ago, visiting California family friends of the wife's, who are Ethiopian and Turkish.  We stopped an Ethiopian place in San Diego and picked up a big buffet spread for a Super Bowl party.  An especially memorable Super Bowl not only because of the ridiculous Eli Manning-to-Tyree play in the final minute, but also because of that great food (and great company).  And our host swore that Ethiopian food got a bit better than this. Our Ethiopian place in Cincinnati is plenty good, but little did we know how good this stuff can get until we visited Ras Dashen in Chicago.  Holy crap, was this delicious.  The five veggies for $13 deal is phenomenal, with very generous portions, and everything we ordered a bold blast of distinct flavor and texture.  We also ordered the asa wat (tilapia filet in a hot berbere sauce), which was also terrific and cooked perfectly and was a perfect accompaniment to all the veggies.  (And it looks like there is plenty more deliciousness on the long menu.) We loved the casual, warm, lowlit feel of Ras Dashen, too.  It's a very unassuming place with unhurried but attentive and helpful service.  It also has a full bar with a decent beer list and cocktails and some other items (honey wine, etc.).   If Ethiopian food gets even better than THIS, I think my skull would implode.

2012-11-12,5.0,"I think this is probably my favorite Ethiopian restaurant. I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday, and we ordered a bunch of food. Rob was very helpful to us. I believe he was a manager. He recommended the awaze tibs (with lamb) for the entree, the shirro for vegetarians, and Zenash's yellow beet salad for starters among others that I've forgotten. In fact, he mentioned that he had carried the lamb into the restaurant that very morning. I was impressed.  Our dinner party was divided into groups of four to simplify the ordering process, and Rob had recommended that we each order an entree. So my group of four ordered the following: We started with the yellow beet salad, which was amazing. I love beets, and this beet salad did not disappoint. It had the perfect amount of vinegar, and I loved the addition of walnuts and dried fruits. For our entrees, we ordered a chicken dish, a beef dish, and a lamb dish. We ordered the doro wat, which is the national Ethiopian dish. It's very spicy, but I loved it. I thought it was delicious. The gored gored was also delicious. It was more stewy than I expected, but still very good and delicious. And I loved the yebeg dereq tibs, which were little cubes of lamb. They had a few off-the-bone pieces, and those were great.  With our entrees, we were allowed one side dish each so we ordered the following: The qosta was delicious, and so were the kik alicha. The ib tasted very similar to Mozzarella cheese, and I loved it a lot. It certainly helped calm my palate down from the spicier foods.   The injera bread (spongy and tasted similar to sour dough bread in flavor, but not texture) really fills you up. I probably had about 2 rolls of the injera bread and that was about all I could handle. You use this bread to pick up, wrap your food in, and eat. It's a very fun, communal eating experience. One of my friends let me try a sip of her Ethiopian coffee, and I liked it a lot. Another friend thought it was too strong, but I thought it was just fine.  Almost everyone on Yelp mentioned that they thought the service was slow.

So I ordered that and ""Misser Wat"" - red lentil stew in berebere sauce for the side. The injera was exactly as described, spongy with a sour taste. I immediately paired it with the entree and the flavors were amazing! The sourness of the injera mixed with the savory notes of the stew were perfect! I also had Ethiopian coffee which is stronger than regular coffee and great tasting! The artwork and interior decor give it an authentic atmosphere and I'm really glad I tried Ethiopian for the first time at this restaurant!",0.983,0.858,0.142,0.0,0.4922364672364672
2012-10-13,4.0,"Foodie Fabulous anniversary day in the city...stop one.  --That was my check-in quick tip and sums up why I was here but let's get into what this place was all about, shall we?! We had been wanting to try Ethiopian food for some time now and decided to go where we heard served the best!  When we walked in, the first thing I noticed was that it was very ethnic and I LOVED the decorations!  They were beautiful paintings and clothing draped on the walls and it was great to look at. We were greeted right away and we decided to go with the Doro Wat and asked the server to pick three sides to go with it. (Note: the entrees only come with one side unlike what it says in Chicago Magazine, so the other two that we ordered were extra.)  I also ended up ordering the special salad of the day which was a beet salad. The meal comes on a pan with injera bread lining the bottom and a basket with extra for grabbing your food.  The items are just dumped on top of the bread which makes for a very rustic experience of eating with your hands which I loved.  The Doro Wat was a chicken breast and wing covered in this sauce that was very similar to a Mexican mole and it also had a hard boiled egg in it.  This was fantastic!  The sauce was to die for and the flavor combination was just great.  The sides the waiter ended up picking for us were the sweet and sour cabbage, spicy lentils and collard greens.  My favorite was the cabbage but they were all decent.  I would definitely want to try other sides to go with that fabulous chicken.  The beet salad was also very good, the dressing was sweet and tangy and the flavor combination was nice. The only down side I would say was that it was pretty pricey.  Considering that the chicken only came with one side and cost about $18, I thought that was a bit high for the portion that you got.  But I do understand that there are probably a lot of different ingredients that go into the sauces and stuff, but I'm just being honest.   Overall, though, I will definitely be back to try more Ethiopian dishes.  The flavors are so complex and interesting and the atmosphere was so unique, how could you NOT want to visit this place?! =]",0.9985,0.764,0.214,0.022,0.6179122125040492

Being from the South, I thought that the qosta tasted like Ethiopian-style comfort food. The sauce that came with the sambusas was amazing, and I kept eating it plain. The sambusas themselves, on the other hand, had thicker shells than I was used to and were kind of hard to eat since the lentils kept falling out.  Our waitress was very kind and helpful in figuring out what to order, and the atmosphere of the restaurant is very cozy. I can't wait to come back and try some of their honey mead.",0.97,0.804,0.173,0.023,0.5422161172161173

2012-08-25,4.0,"I'm really torn. Our experience here was less than stellar but the food was absolutely amazing, perhaps 3.5 overall, but I'm sure I'll come back here so I'd give it a 4.  The restaurant is big enough to hold the continuously long line of customers, but small enough to be intimate. The lighting and decors could have not been better, and the outdoor seating was very cute as well. Everything seemed good from the beginning. We sat and didn't take long to order. The menu is very helpful and they do have options for all dietary types.  Although the menu did indicate that the food might take a while to get out, I just didn't expect it to be that long. To make it a bit worse, our water was empty and didn't get a refill at all, not until we stood up and grabbed a waiter. They do seem apologetic whenever we had to do it (yes more than one time), but still the service didn't improve throughout.  But when our food came out, I quickly forgot about the mediocre service. As the waitress poured our food into the big injera, I secretly drooled. Everything looked and smelled ridiculously good. We quickly picked up the injera and started our feast. Being from Asia, I love nothing more than a shared dinner with friends and family, when everyone can eat anyone else' food, and needless to say I was very happy with this meal. My lentil and okra was delicious, and I got to try some other dishes, all of which were amazing as well. The Asa Tibs (pan fried fish) was to-die-for, we ended up order an extra for a friend who came late. For the sides, we got the cheese (Ib), green bean and potatoes in tomato stew, and cabbage and potato stew. The cheese didn't impress us - which is rare, considering I eat cheese 5 times a day, and my Egyptian friend basically lives off cheese and bread. It was not salty enough for us I guess. The green bean stew (#8) was delicious, and I wish we had gotten some more sides, since they all sounded really good.  The portion was very generous, and of course there was still a lot left when we all could not eat anymore. There was lived music playing, and it could have been nice but we were sitting right next to it so we could not hear most of our conversation. The service still didn't improve much in the end and our waitress calculate our check wrong, but she quickly made changes as I told her. Overall, I was very happy with the meal, less so with the services, but I'd definitely come back. Also, good date spot, but make sure your date is ok with eating by hand and sharing food (and if they're not, it's probably best to not go on that date in general)!",0.9982,0.739,0.2,0.061,0.5073722718253968

Aside from the food, I just want to mention how absolutely wonderful the customer service was.  Our waitress was phenomenal.  We told her it was our first time having Ethiopian and she guided us on what to order and her suggestions were supurb.  Although I do get the feeling that no matter what you order, you cannot go wrong.  We also had conversation with the manager on duty.  What a nice guy.  He chatted with us for some time and also sent over a piece of Bread Pudding on the house for my sister's birthday.  What a nice touch!

My brother and I ordered a Meat Combo (two half portions of entrees + 3 sides).  I think it is intended for one person to eat, but we had a hard time finishing it.  But then again, we also did order an appetizer and 1 extra piece of injera.  However, for most people, I probably would still recommend ordering the Meat Combo to share with 2 people. We got the Kitfo tere (steak tartare) and Yebeg wat (lamb stew).  The steak tartare came out very mildly seasoned, which I enjoyed, because I really just wanted to enjoy the taste of mildly raw meat.  Lamb stew also enjoyable, and came with a big  bone piece to gnaw on.  For an appetizer, we got the Qategna, which was warm crispy injera with lots of garlic and oil.  Yum! Drinks:  The honey wine was enjoyable.  The Left Hand Milk Stout is super creamy, rich, and a bit sweet - much better than a typical stout. Etc: Nice ambiance/decor and service.  This is probably similar in size to Demera - medium-sized and somewhat intimate-feeling.  However, this place does have a nice large area in the back that could be used for private parties.  Ethiopian Diamond felt almost like a school cafeteria because of how big it was.",0.9977,0.717,0.277,0.006,0.43672792724516857

However, this past Friday, we got ourselves out of our Ethiopian rut and headed a bit south on Broadway to Ras Dashen.  The ULTIMATE FACEOFF HAD BEGUN.  ETHIOPIAN DIAMOND VS. RAS DASHEN Cute interior. When I walked in I was immediately greeted and seated. I started to peruse the menu and noticed that ordering works differently at Ras Dashen. Basically, if you order a veggie platter you get to choose from 12 different dishes at Ras Dashen, whereas Ethiopian Diamond has a set of dedicated dishes in their vegetarian platter. Same goes with the meat platter - you can choose what you want at Ras Dashen. Between my husband and I, we ordered the Tikil Gomen Alicha, Gomen, Qosta, Diblik Atkilt, Misser Wat, Kik Alicha, Yeqay Tikil Gomen, Doro Wat and Yeqay Ferfer. And, of course, a pot of tea.  Ethiopian Diamond's tea is better, by a mile. I also preferred Ethiopian Diamonds rendition of Gomen (greens cooked in spices) - Ras Dashen's was a little crunchier, and I prefer the stewier version.  I preferred Ras Dashen's Tikil Gomen Alicha (cabbage, potato and carrot stew) and their Kik Alicha (Yellow split pea stew). My husband preferred the meat at Ras Dashen. I also LOVED the Yeqay Tikil Gomen (sweet and sour red cabage), and that seems to be exclusive to Ras Dashen. It was incredibly savory and wonderful. So dreamy.  All in all, I would say it's a draw.

We were seated for 25 minutes before our server acknowledged us, at which time she just said, ""Ready to order."" We were obvious newbies and she offered one word answers to our questions, so we were pretty much on our own. When we finally were served, the lentil soup was great, so we had high hopes. But it went downhill from there. I did not like the flavor of the injera bread, and since that's your only utensil, it affects everything. It was very sour and had a weird, moist texture. Not like naan or sourdough like some other people said, to me; it seemed more like a bitter Swedish pancake.  I didn't expect anything super fancy, but the server literally just dumped bowls of our entrees onto the platter, without any regard for keeping the meat and veggie dishes separate. The veggies were pretty good - the yellow split peas in particular - and the ""spicy juicy"" lamb dish was delicious. The doro wat had good flavor, but it was difficult to eat, served on the bone with literally a whole boiled egg and a lot of inedible parts. The gored gored was so chewy that I found it inedible, although the sauce had great flavor and heat.  We weren't in a hurry, but the meal took two and a half hours, and we spent most of it waiting for our server. Thankfully another server noticed that we were waiting too long and comped a drink for us, but we ended up going to the bar ourselves because we couldn't find our server.

2012-01-17,3.0,"I really wanted to be blown away by this place--I'd been looking forward to trying Ethiopian for quite a while. My review's based on the specifics of this restaurant as detailed in the next paragraph, but I will note the following: I'm not sure if it's Ethiopian cuisine in general, the Americanized version of Ethiopian cuisine, or Ras Dashen's particular take (since I'm not sure, I'm not holding it against Ras Dashen in my review), but I found everything surprisingly bland. I don't mean a not-spicy-enough blandness (although I was surprised at the mildness as well), but rather an absence of the flavor complexity that makes high-quality Thai, Cambodian, Vietnamese, Indian, even Chinese food (or well-spiced BBQ for that matter) so crave-able. Nothing at Ras Dashen was unpalatable, but I didn't *crave* a second bite of any of it. (Maybe the dupa wat. That was tasty.) The injera was lacking in the tanginess I'd been told to expect, the berebere sauces were good but not finger-licking... and my friend and I both thought the much-anticipated tej tasted like honeyed apple juice (it probably would have been better chilled). I should note that I stick to a strict mostly-raw, rarely spiced whole food diet at home, so on the rare occasions that I eat out, I'm pretty darn sensitive to nuanced flavor/aromatics. My friend summed it up best when we walked in... ""It smells like tomato soup."" But on to the stars. I tend to think menu prices should correspond to either the ingredient quality, chef talent, or service. I'm willing to forgive weak service if the food blows my mind, and vice versa. I called to make a reservation, and actually took the minimal English on the other end as a testament to the quality of the food. And when we arrived and asked for traditional seating only to be met with a puzzled look, we sat at the standard table to which we had been ushered, asked for glasses of honey wine (getting another puzzled look when we tried asking if it was better as a dessert wine or with the meal), and opened our menus. Immediately (I mean, as soon as we looked down), we were asked for our orders, to which we politely responded we needed a few minutes. Over the course of 7 minutes, throughout which we were clearly examining the menu and discussing our options, we were asked 4 times if we were ready to order; each time we responded that we needed a few minutes. It was amusing but pretty rude, especially given that we were one of 2 tables--they didn't need us to hurry out and clear their table. When we did close our menus and look around to order... it took a few minutes for anyone to notice. Not an issue, but after feeling pressured to decide it felt a little silly. After ordering the omnivore dinner for 2 with Qosta, Diblik Atlik, Kik Alicha, Dupa Wat, Doro Wat, and Zilzil Alicha (and getting yet another look when we asked if we might substitute the special entree Gored Gored for one of those for a few extra dollars), we noticed the tucked-away traditional seating on a trip to the restroom, and were able to ask the English-speaking bartender if we might switch, as all we had to move were our drinks. Everything went smoothly after that, but for $70 (including tax and tip, no appetizers or dessert--just 2 glasses of wine and the dinner for 2), I don't expect to work so hard. I wouldn't come back, although I might order the dupa wat for pick up if I get a pumpkin craving.",0.9942,0.849,0.111,0.04,0.49977954144620834

I had the vegetarian sampler, which allows one to order five selections.  I enjoyed the misser wat, qosta, gomen, komodoro salata and tikil gomen alicha.  My friends also enjoyed their meal immensely.  My friend ordered chocolate cake for dessert.  The server informed us it is made fresh and would take approximately twenty minutes.  Upon its arrival, steam was coming from its center, as it was just taken from the oven.  The chocolate aroma was mouth watering and the first bite of the warm chocolate cake was sensational.  It was worth the wait.  The only problem was it was so small.  We should have each ordered one.  Being a recovering chocoholic, I would return just for the delicious cake.",0.9724,0.825,0.16,0.015,0.5215686274509803
2012-01-08,3.0,"I gave Ethiopian food a second chance after trying it at a restaurant in D.C., which ran out of tej! How that happened at an Ethiopian restaurant, I don't know, but I made sure to order the honey wine here. I chose the homemade tej over the Oakland, CA version and was very satisfied with how the tej's level of sweetness complemented the spices in the food. I especially liked the texture of items 6, 8, and the mushroom wat from the vegetarian dinner for two combo; I also ordered 12, 14, and 17, but those items didn't suit my palate. Back then, I was also an amateur when it came to eating injera--I felt painfully stuffed after that first meal in D.C. You see, even though the porosity of the sour flat bread makes it easy to scoop up sauces and dishes with your hands, it also absorbs water like crazy. So this time around, I made sure to put aside my glass of water while eating...and my stomach thanked me afterwards. Be aware that after the first basket of injera, any additional ones will be $1 per roll.   Overall, I thought the Ethiopian food was okay, but for the price we paid for two people (~$50), the service and ambience needs more work: -1 star for the inattentive hostess, who zoned out while chewing her bubble gum. -1 star for the dim lighting; I could barely read my dinner menu by candlelight.",0.9794,0.835,0.135,0.029,0.47013888888888883

I KNOW this food like I know the back of my hand. I can depend on it always being the most delicious, scrumptious meal. Every single sunday, I look forward to my Ethiopian feast. We have our favorites, for sure, but I love basically everything on the menu. The injera at Ras Dashen (injera is the bread everything is served on top of) is so sour and full of little air holes and fluffy yet dense and omg so good. Injera might be my favorite bread, ever. Komodoro salad: fresh and vinegary. sometimes spicy. A lot like pico de gallo, it's my fave salad at ras dashen. Ethio salad: more like a typical american side salad, with added flavor from jalapenos. Tikil gomen: if you like cabbage, don't miss this. Very filling dish for vegetarians. Qosta: kind of like popeye spinach. healthy and tasty. Ib: mmmmmm IB. Pronounced with a short i, not a long i, ib is like fresh mozzarella but creamier, and not lumpy like cottage cheese.  Doro wat: If you like spicy chicken, don't miss this. I don't find it to be spicy enough, but the chicken falls off the bone, and the hard boiled egg breaks apart so nicely. Mix it all with the sauce...mmmmmmmmm YEBEG DEREQ: BY FAR, my fave entree on the menu. We order TWO of these every week. lol. It's lamb that has been pan-fried and full of rosemary flavor. It's not oily, but it's so incredibly flavorful. We even chew on the bones when there's none left. I could literally eat this every day.  Zilzil alicha: my fave beef entree. Totally juicy, oniony, fresh. Zilzil, it's what's for dinner. Kitfo lebleb: the single dish on the menu I don't like, but my bandmates love it. I find it too undercooked and really oily. Sega wat: one of the spicier dishes (I always want more spicy everything) this beef dish is really saucy. It soaks in to the injera really well and mixes with all the veggies. All the lentil and chickpea dishes are very tasty, too. A great place for vegetarians. Espresso: think Turkish coffee. This stuff is strrrrong and powerful Ethio chai: yummmmy tea! Like chamomile, but better. So yummy in wintertime. Many of the cooks and most of the staff at Ras Dashen are Ethiopian, and so is a lot of their clientele. You will be getting the full authentic experience in a nice yet cozy environment.  I think what I love most about their food is that it's so packed full of flavor and sauce, and you get so much food and bread, it's like the joy just keeps filling up your mouth.

And the best part - you can get 2 for 1 entrees with your WBEZ member card!  If you don't have one of those, don't worry - this place is very affordable.  Our night out with a couple of beers or glasses of wine/tej, and the omnivore deal comes out to about $65.  I think this is a great place to take a date - the atmosphere is more intimate, especially if you sit at a traditional table.  Also, you can find out if your date likes Ethiopian food or not - which would be a TOTAL deal breaker for me.",0.9973,0.754,0.22,0.027,0.5974326599326599

It's was my first time ever having Ethiopian food, so I can't really say much to the authenticity, but it was really cool that our server was actually Ethiopian, and was able to answer some of our questions. They had traditional tables for smaller groups (our group was too large, so we sat at two longer tables). Maybe we're ignorant, but we asked if a meal served like this (all together shared from one large platter) was an everyday type meal, or something that was saved for special occasions (it's an every day type of meal, btw). I don't love the sour injera bread on its own, but with the food, I thought it was delicious. Being Taiwanese, I don't know a lot about Indian food, but on the surface, I would compare a lot of the entrees we had to Indian food, considering the sauces and the spices used. Even the eating method with the injera is kind of like eating with naan. Just make sure everyone washes their hand before eating. There's a sink out back to the left, outside of the bathroom, if you're just there to hand wash. I tried a couple Ethiopian beers with the meal. Nothing extraordinary, mostly just another beer, but for just a little more than a Miller Lite, I went for it. The price was about right, service and ambiance were very nice too.

My favorite dishes include the yebeg dereq tibs, lebleb tibs, quelulu, diblik atkilt, doro wat, kik alicha, kitfo tere, qosta, and ib.  ALWAYS order the ib (pronounced eye-b):  it goes with everything.  Their homemade Tej is excellent.  Their injera is excellent (and can be made with 100% teff if you call a day in advance!). I admit the desserts, though tasty, are small, but by the time the meal is over, I don't care since I am happily full.  I was not thrilled with any of the appetizers but, again, why waste space on appetizers when the entrees are SO amazing?  I don't enjoy when there is live music, but that is because I like the quiet of the typical evenings there, and for those who like live music, it might be a treat. I do enjoy the traditional music that plays over the speakers during regular evenings.  The wait staff are tremendously responsive to any requests, and we've asked for bowls, forks, spoons, help with kids, volume changes on the music, pitchers of water and all kinds of things over our dozens of visits. The hot spice tea is also out of this world, especially in the winter.  The food is even more amazing (something I would not have thought possible) when warmed over the next day in a skillet so that the leftover injera gets crispy.  MMmmmm.

The venue is nicely appointed and the food is served atop of injera (an Ethiopian spongy type of bread). You break off a piece of the injera and use it to scoop up a portion of food. There are so many dishes to choose from and fortunately they have combination options so you can sample multiple items. My wife and I usually opt for the Omnivore dinner for two (your choice of three sides and three mains). The food is relatively inexpensive and represents a great value. Portions are generous.  In addition to having fun, authentic and tasty cuisine the service has always been decent to good at Ras Dashen and they were very accommodating when I held a monthly Ethnic dinner club for our large sized group. Ras Dashen also holds fun events periodically; my first visit here was for a beer dinner where a local brewery paired their beers with the food and the chef/owner or Ras Dashen spoke about the food.

For 5 people, we ordered 4 entrees and 3 sides, and we peobably would have been satisfied with only 3 entrees, to be honest.  We got the Diffen Misser Wat, the Komodoro Fetfet, the Shirro, and the Vegetarian Special of the day, which was something similar in texture to the Diffen Misser Wat.  My favorite by far was the Shirro.  I wanted to slurp it all up all by myself, it was that good.  I was a little confused by the presence of injera (the spongy bread) in the Komodoro Fetfet, because with the already injera-heavy meal, I would think the vegetables would be more prominently featured.  For our sides, we ordered the Yeqaysur Salata, the Diblik Atkilt, and the Ib.  All 3 were delicious.  I particularly liked the texture of the Ib.  For the less adventurous among us, the Yeqaysur Salata (beet salad) had very familiar flavors to an American palate. One note about the injera bread - it is sour.  I was told this going in, that a lot of people don't enjoy the taste of the bread, so I knew what to expect.  But I think I may be one of those who don't enjoy it as much.  I didn't hate it, just didn't love it.  It has a very strong sour flavor that, since you're literally using it as your utensil, is in every bite you take.  I was hoping for a way to enjoy the stews and sides without the injera, but I didn't want to offend anyone by asking for silverware.  :)  Maybe in the future, Ethiopian cuisine will be more of a take-out option for me.",0.9571,0.88,0.091,0.029,0.5544993164730008

2011-05-15,3.0,"For many years, my husband and I always favored the veggie combos at Ethiopian restaurants we've eaten at in Philly, Atlanta, Durham, and DC.  However, since moving to Chicago, we've tried about four different restaurants and haven't found any 'to-die-for' vegetarian dishes.  I think mainly this is because many Ethiopian places around here cook with oil, as opposed to butter, and let's just say I'm a 'butter-baby' -- I am no purist!  I simply prefer both the texture and richness butter adds to veggie dishes; you might be different.  Ras Dashen's veggie dishes are  personally not 'to-die-for' on my tongue -- we've had just about all the veggie 'sides' or platters, and they are OK.  Given the 'oil/butter' issue, I tend to favor the vinegar-based salads instead. The Komodoro Fetfet has a nice blend of spices and a fresh, bright taste and 'kick.' The lentil salad is good--much blander than in other restaurants, and made with green peppers as opposed to jalapenos.  As with every Ethiopian place we've ever been at more than once, the general taste of the dishes here varies from trip to trip.  I don't mind that, though, with this cuisine.  To my mind, it's just part of feeling the love and mood of the hands that made the food. Veggie dishes aside, the meat dishes are really what draws us in around here.  The Sega Wat and Yeqay Ferfer are excellent--bold flavors, really deeply rich tastes.  Yesterday we also tried the Gored Gored and loved that, too:  It was very 'meaty' to taste at first, but the flavors soon came through and lingered.  Overall, a very satisfying dish.  In other places where we've had Gored Gored, the meat was raw; here, they cook the meat to medium rare.  After coming here about five times, I can say we've never gone wrong with any meat dish we've had.     In all honesty, Ethiopian food is one of my favorite cuisines by far, in part because of the food and flavor, but also in part because of the legendary hospitality and generosity of most Ethiopian restaurants.  Ras Dashen falls far short in that regard, for me: The hospitality is generally lacking  I am just not a fan of the service at this place.  First, they never give you near enough Injera and seem annoyed and/or 'put out' if you ask for more.  And rest assured:  *You* always have to be the one to ask for more here, as opposed to other places where someone will see you are out and bring over one or two new pieces.  Also, while I stated above that I don't mind some variability in the overall subtle 'tastes' of the food, I do mind how wildly variable they are here with how much food they give you each time.  Last night the Gored Gored was a 21.00 dish, and we received considerably less than we would have had we done the 'two-meat dish, 1/2 portion' combo.  Likewise, our 'sides' were very meager last night, too.  That, combined with the general look the waitress gave me when after eating two pieces of injera (which came with the meal), I asked for one more, well, it made me think this place is pretty stingy, all in all.  My husband and I have a 'waste-not, want-not' mentality with food--we don't over-ask for things, nor do we ever leave or waste a meal. And we're always complimentary of dishes that taste good.  So, I just don't get where the attitude at this place comes from. Pound for pound, though I slightly favor the meat dishes here to the place next door (Abyssinia Ethiopian Restaurant), and though this place seems to regularly pull in more business, I'd much prefer the 'love' I feel at Abyssinia.  When we eat there, the owner is always so welcoming, and he frequently will give us free dishes to try out.  Also, he comes to check on us and is always so kind when anyone compliments his dishes--very personable man.  And, guess what?  The meat dishes there are tasty, too!  So, in light of that, I think I'm stepping next door for a while.  For me the dining experience is EVERYTHING about the evening--hospitality, service, food, and atmosphere--not just the food.",0.9969,0.866,0.113,0.021,0.49408429734516696

2011-05-07,5.0,"I finally got to eat Ethiopian!! And we loved it! Came in Friday night at around 10 pm. Wonderful little Ethiopian restaurant which is deceptively big inside. Wonderfully appointed in earth tones and with gorgeous African paintings. My favorite was the two angels sharing some injera over a traditional ethiopian table.  Well attended by all sorts of folks. Excellent trancey jazz band arrived one at a time and joined in to the others as they were already playing. You can be seated at a traditional ethiopian table with four chairs and two, small side tables or a traditional full table that seats four or more. The food is alive with flavor: spices, great base ingredients, and delicious gravies/sauces. You select three side dishes per table and then pick your entrees. You typically order an entree per person at the table but share since it's served in a communal aluminum tray. You get an injera flat bread under your food and extra injera (two come with every entree) or $1 per any additional. We ordered for our sides: Diblik atkilt (mixed veggies), Kik alicha (yellow peas paste), and Yeqay tikil gomen (sweet and sour purple cabbage). For our entrees we ordered vegetarian mushroom wat and asa tibs (pepper/ginger tilapia filet with veggies). For dessert we shared an ethiopian bread pudding (made with injera so it's a little sour).  I had the ethio chai which is a spiced black tea that comes with a sugar bowl and spoon to help yourself. No dairy. Awesomeness. He had the ethiopian beer. Make that two. Delicious dinner that was memorable and relaxing, in all the right ways and more! Tip: wash your hands before dinner and after dinner at either the two, private ladies restrooms (or the gents restroom I guess) or the separate hand-washing area. Totally well maintained facilities. We will be back! Often I hope!",0.9926,0.835,0.157,0.008,0.5694337194337195

My rules of dining are simple. If you try to touch anything on my plate, expect to be stabbed with a fork. It took a few minutes for me to get used to having all of our food on the same pizza-pan sized dish. Once I tasted the delicious offerings that were laid before me, I was fine with it.   Ethiopian food is all about the wonderful sauces that are used.  To be honest, I can't remember what kind of meat I ordered, all I remember is the savory sauce and delicious bread it was served on. And to top it all off, the Ethio Chai tea we ordered was the best tea I ever tasted. We went through two pots in world record time.   The bottom line on Ras Dashen is a tasty one. Delicious food served in a cozy setting makes this place a must for the adventurous eater. The quality of the food and delicious spices will blow your mind.

2011-04-06,5.0,"Here's the problem with Ras Dashen. If you have never been, you might want to take extra consideration when planning an evening here. Because what is going to happen is that after you leave, you are going to keep thinking about the food...er, more like obsessing about it. To the point where is is going  to either drive you absolutely crazy, or you will turn into some creepy stalker who drives by the place at all hours of the night and presses his face up onto the front window just to say he got to touch it.  Do you want to be that guy?  Yeah....oh you do?  Well, OK then, but don't say I didn't warn you. In fact, I am gonna do you one better and tell you some things to look out for when you go. First up the Ethio Chai tea.  Easily the most awesome, flavourful tea I have had in a long time. So good we ordered 2 pots and polished them both off in record time. You don't even need milk or sugar! It is that good. Now, you are going to order your platter. Remember to come here with people whose cleanliness habits you know and trust, because this is about to get messy. You are going to want to pick 3 sides. We chose the Komodoro salata (diced cucumber, tomato, onion and jalapeño salad), the Ib (soft cheese made fresh daily with cultured buttermilk), and the Misser wat (pureed red lentils in a spicy berbere sauce).  Everyone then picks an entree. Andy picked the Sega wat (beef stew in a spicy, dark berbere sauce) and I went with the Doro Wat, which is similar to the Sega Wat, but it is made with chicken and egg.  All of this is served on one big platter, with a basket of injera bread (sort of a spongy flatbread). You use the injera to scoop up all of these items and stuff them into your little impatient mouth.  At the end, everything just sort of runs together and is fantastically delicious.  Oh right, also don't bother to come here if you are one of those people who cant have foods on the plate touching one another. You won't get far if you are OCD in any way.   Hey, just putting it out there folks.

2011-04-02,4.0,"Went here last night and it was my first experience with Ethiopian food. We had reservations and were seated right away, which was great, since the place was packed. We all went to wash our hands (since we would be eating with them), and I was pleased to find a very nice and clean rest room. It seemed like we sat for quite a while before the waitress came over. When she did arrive, she wanted to immediately take our food order, but we had some questions, considering we were all new to this. I figured she would have a standard ""schpiel"" explaining the procedure, but no...she was like (pointing to the menu) ""These are the sides, these are the entrees...."" basically, not really helping. Anyway, we had a long enough time to sit and study the menu (which actually explains how it works quite nicely) so we had pretty much figured it out.  I had an Ethiopian beer that was very nice. The food did not take terribly long to arrive and we dug in. It was SOOOO good....we ordered all vegetarian fare (with an order of fish on the side, which I did not try). I did order another beer, which the waitress forgot to bring (the not-stellar service being the reason for 4 stars instead of 5)...and we all continued to chow down. We decided to all split a couple coconut creme brulees....again, SOOO good. OMG it was perfect. The dessert menu was interesting (I'm pretty sure that ""Molten Chocolate Lava Cake"" is not Ethiopian, but I'm sure it would be good just the same)....next time I would probably try to save room for the injera bread pudding.

They have Lentil, Spinach, and even  Shimbera sambusas (my favorite!), based on their Shimbera Assa (ground chick pea dough balls in a rich berbere sauce). So good! You even get four per order, which is great since most Ethiopian places only give you two. For dessert, we split the vegan Temptation mint chocolate chip ice cream in the most adorable chilled glass! Afterward we had Buna be Jebena, which is Ethiopian coffee (Buna) served in a beautiful clay pot (Jebena). On Fridays, they have live music! My boyfriend and I were seated right next to them finishing our Buna as they started. They sounded wonderful, and even though we were so close the music wasn't overly loud.

2011-03-09,4.0,"The first time I ate Ethiopian was with my husband and a bunch of strangers at Ethiopian Diamond during an I Wish class.  While the presentation and info beforehand was captivating and interesting, when it comes to communal eating with strangers, you're all looking at each other like, did you really wash your hands when you came out of the bathroom?  (I did.)  After that experience, we decided to go with another couple who was eager to try out an Ethiopian restaurant in Chicago after visiting one in Madison, WI and we could relax knowing we could trust the sanitary habits of those we knew.  We originally planned on going to Demera to use a Groupon but after failing to make a reservation, we ended up at Ras Dashen which ended up being a fabulous choice. I LOVE the fact that they have a ""How to Order"" section on the menu.  It helps alleviate the whole, what the hell are we doing factor that accompanies eating Ethiopian food.  They recommend one entrée per person and three sides per table of four, asking your server to suggest complementary sides if you're stumped.   We each picked one entrée and ended up with one each of a vegetarian, chicken, beef and lamb dish.  We asked our server to suggest sides and she looked a little dumbfounded.  She ended up helping us out but wasn't outright endorsing certain sides over others.   *Here is where I cheat and look back at the menu and guess at what we ordered:  - Diffen Misser Wat: whole red lentils in spicy berbere sauce  - Doro alicha: chicken and egg cooked in a sauce of onions, garlic, ginger and green peppers  - Yeqay ferfer: beef and injera pieces cooked in spicy sauce with tomatoes and garlic  - Yebeg wat: lamb stew in a spicy, dark berbere sauce Sides:  - Qosta: spinach cooked with onions, garlic and spices  - Ib: soft cheese made fresh daily  - Tikil gomen alicha: mildly spiced cabbage, potato and carrot stew* *I'm not sure this is what we ordered but I can't for the life of me figure out what the last one was. Overall, everything was delicious.  The injera was soft but strong and was a good utensil for all of the dishes.  I could eat injera every day, I think.  Yeah, I could.  My favorite was the chicken dish, although I'm not sure how anyone expects you to eat a hardboiled egg with injera?  I just jabbed my nail right into it and broke off a piece but that was only because no one else at the table wanted any part of it.  So who knows?  The table favorite seemed to be the lamb stew, the sauce it was in was really flavorful.  My least favorite were the lentils but maybe just because I like the other ones that much more and not because it was necessarily bad. The service got a little weird at the end when they dropped off dessert menus and then didn't come back for a good 15 minutes.  We were in a little bit of a hurry but just seemed to be forgotten about once the food came.  And maybe it was because there was a little rush when we were ready to leave so I'm not going to complain too much.  Overall, I would definitely recommend it for a unique meal in the city.  It was reasonably priced too, with drinks it ended up being about $30/person with tax and tip.  I suggest going with four people in your group to ensure you have an easy to reach to the plate while still having a good variety of dishes.",0.9952,0.792,0.146,0.062,0.5531158142269254

The cozy surroundings and friendly staff at Ras Dashen make it the perfect place to try out Ethiopian food if you've never had it before. ""Comfort food from the mountains of Ethiopia"" is right. You'll feel entirely sated after a warming meal here. I highly recommend starting with the qategna (warm bread with a bit of a kick to it) because the dinner takes a while to prepare and you will be hungry. I'd recommend ordering one of the dinners because you get to try a variety of items. For the appetizers I loved the sweet and sour red cabbage and the yellow lentils. For entrees I highly recommend the doro wat. - chicken in the traditional Ethiopian sauce. The meal was rounded out with the traditional coffee. Of course it takes a while to prepare (as all good things do) but it was definitely worth it. The beans were eye-opening strong and I think I drink several of the small cups -- great caffeine buzz! The staff here is super friendly and the space lends itself well to larger groups and parties of two looking for an intimate night out.

The vegetarian dinner for two comes with 6 different items, 3 main dishes (they give you a bigger portion of those) and 3 sides. My favorites were the shirro (chickpea stew) and the tikil gomen alicha (cabbage, potatoes, and carrots). The shirro is out of this world--it has this really good buttery flavor but is not overly rich. The cabbage was cooked perfectly and had a great flavor. The other items didn't blow me away--we ordered diffen misser wat (lentil stew), diblik atkilt (green beans with carrots) and kik alicha (yellow split pea stew). All were very tasty but not amazing. I give this place 4 stars because I have had better Ethiopian food--there is a restaurant in St. Louis that is out of this world, and I still dream about their food.

2011-01-23,5.0,"Eating at Ras Dashem for me was a little bit like finding a new speakeasy, but for ethiopian food. Having thoroughly enjoyed Addis Abeba and Ethiopian Diamond ( 1 ) multiple times, I figured that Ethiopian Diamond was probably the best. Meanwhile, I've also been watching brewmasters during spouts of boredom, and had caught the episode named bitches brew, where they make a beer mixed with Tej. So of course what do I start off my dinner at Ras with? A glass of Tej, aka honey wine. It was really good. It was a light wine, with great flavor, and as deep a tan for a wine as you'd get from a cider.  We followed that up with some samosas, and if there's one thing probably half the world always gets right, it's samosas. Whether it's called sambucas, sambosas, samosas, it's all somewhat similar and notably: good/great. Mealwise, the vegetarian combo is not only a great price but a great meal. It's not unlikely to get 3 meals out of this place including takehome, just due to the sheer volume of the food and the awesome spongey bread.   Meanwhile, there are approximately 15 choices on the vegetarian combo, so let's explain a little. The  Shimbera asa wat (mock fish) is awesome. I still have no idea what Shimbera is, but it's certainly good.  At the same time, Tikil gomen alicha has been available at every ethiopian place I've been to and is quickly becoming a staple. It sounds simple in how it's done - cabbage, carrots, potatoes, but it's great. It's somewhat curried and has a very unique but awesome flavor.

When you go, each table (usually per 3-4 guests) gets a round platter with three sides. The sides are delicious... everything from a green bean, carrot, potato mix to a sweet and sour cabbage. Then each person chooses an entree. This place has both vegetarian and meat options. The veggie options would please any vegetarian or vegan. The meat options are beef, lamb, chicken, and fish. Each comes in a variety of sauces which range from savory and flavorful (but child-friendly) to spicy berbere sauced meats. I also enjoy the specials they have from time to time. Most recently, a yellow beet salad which was so GOOD.  The sambusas are very tasty, if a bit small (4 small pieces per order). The chickpea salad is a great new one to experience a veggie you might not think to order as a side. When we go, I like to bring a large group so we can get a good mix of foods to share. This is definitely not a place for you if you don't like to eat with your hands! The bread, injera, you rip in pieces to eat with. It's got a spongy texture with a mildy sour flavor. It doesn't affect the taste of the food (in a negative way), although it does get filling.  As far as the seating is concerned, you can sit at a table and chairs, or sit in a softer, wicker and padded cushion type table. I find the service to be slower paced, but not bad by any means. It's just a very casual, laid-back vibe type of place. To be fair, I haven't been to any other Ethiopian place to compare, but then again, there hasn't been a reason.

We ordered a chicken dish, two veggie dishes, a beef dish, and a lamb dish, plus two sides chosen by the waitress.  Everything was really, really tasty.  Spicy, flavorful, interesting. However, our service was really pretty bad - I was without napkins for the entire meal since they didn't check in until the end, and even then she forgot to bring napkins.  I also didn't get a refill on my soda, and our meal was rather spicy, so that was kind of difficult. I wouldn't knock a couple stars off just for that though.  We went to a show in the back afterward, and according to the doorman it was $15, which got you 2 drinks plus some food or something (not that we were that interested in food at that point).  Once we were seated, the waiter also repeated this.  We didn't order immediately since we were so stuffed from dinner, but once another gent came by my mom tried to order wine.  The new gent said that wasn't the deal, and then proceeded to annoy us the rest of the night - saying yes we could have it, then when we ordered drinks he said he'd have to charge us, then saying we could get 2-for-1s, then saying it was really 2-for-2s... it was so, so, so obnoxious.   I wouldn't have even minded if the original waiter was wrong - stuff like that happens - but the second waiter was so incredibly obnoxious and bothered us approximately every 6 minutes.  It became a running joke at the table that you could order a drink, but 1 min later he would come back with a new set of conditions for you to agree to, completely different from the set of conditions you originally agreed to.  Ugh.  Fire.

You get to choose three sides from about twelve, plus however many entrees you want. All of the food is served on top of a VERY LARGE spongy ""roll"", Injera (the thinness of a crepe). You get a basket of extra, smaller Injera on the side. Two for each person, extra Injera are a dollar each. I dined with two others and we did not need more than our two allotted Injera plus the Injera the food was served on. For our sides we ordered Qosta, spinach cooked with onion and spices, the Ib, soft cheese cooked with buttermilk and Misser wat, lentils with berbere sauce. The Qosta was pretty good but I feel could have used a little more spice or salt. The Ib was delicious and a cool, refreshing reprieve from the spicy Misser wat and one of our spicy entrees. I did not like the Misser wat, it had a strange chemically taste, sort of like chemical and styrofoam, I didnt eat much of it. Their Injera is delicious, spongy and a little sour, a great taste and utensil to scoop up the food with.  For entrees we ordered Misserana Bowmia, lentils and okra in berbere sauce. This was pretty spicy and pretty tasty but our other entree was leaps and bounds tastier, their vegetarian special, Dupa Wat, pumpkin and other glorious spices and sauce. The Dupa Wat was lightly sweet from the pumpkin and so satisfying. Really truly delicious, the star of everything we ate.  I would go back in a heart beat for their Dupa Wat scooped up with their delicious Injera. I also would love to try their other vegetarian special, Mushroom Wat. Since we went with a vegetarian we did not try any meat but I have a feeling their lamb dishes would be amazing.

Generally, I recommend going with a group, since the whole idea is to share. Ask the server to recommend a variety of dishes so that your group gets a good range of flavors and foods. It's a fun thing to rip the injera bread apart and sponging up the different stews and meats and spices with your friends. Another note: They have a few African beers in bottles on the menu.

2010-06-10,5.0,"I mostly want to write this review for Ras Dashen to explain why it's my favorite Ethiopian restaurant in Chicago, not simply a great restaurant among many. I have had the good fortune to try most of the Ethiopian mainstays in the city - Mama Desta's, Diamond, Demera as well as some other African resaturants like the Eritrean-based  Peacock.  Ras Dashen is my favorite because it wins gold stars in every category of dining experience, as far as I'm concerned. The food is impeccably delicious, every single time. I don't care what dish you're interested in, at Ras Dashen it is mouth-wateringly good. While Diamond boasts delicious food, Diamond has opted for a more Western-inspired semi-fine-dining darkened ambience that has always felt a bit superimposed and artificial to me, as it offers little of the Ethiopian culture besides the albeit awesome food itself.  At Ras Dashen, while there are Western-style tables and chairs available, there are also Ethiopian tables and chairs and much Ethiopian artwork adorning the walls and African music playing lightly in the background, such that while it's certainly not like stepping into Ethiopia when crossing the threshhold, the sense of authenticity and care the owners must have about conveying authenticity is immediately apparent. The wait staff are kind and patient with patrons' ridiculous pronunciations of dishes and willing to connect with inquisitive, curious diners about the correct proncunciations, the indigenous spices, the history of the food and the way it is eaten - communally. The large dining room is filled with warm light and gregarious staff people, just as important to me as the food in front of me. At Ras Dashen, more than at the other Ethiopian restaurants I have patronized, the entirety of the experience - from the first bite of Kategna to the last sip of robust Ethiopian coffee - pleases every sense in the body and facilitates an actual connection with some of the culture and people of the Simian Mountains of Ethiopia.  Whenever anyone asks me for a restaurant recommendation in Chicago, I usually ask what type of cuisine or dining experience they're looking for and go from there. Ras Dashen is in my top ten favorite restaurants in Chicago and it's certainly the only Ethiopian place I recommend to anyone who's asking.",0.9954,0.79,0.184,0.026,0.5715773809523809

I have never had a disappointing meal here. The first time I went, I was wish meat-eaters and we never even looked at the menu. We just asked our waitress to put together something with variety and she came through amazingly! She put together a whole mess of delicious foods and by the end of the meal, our plate looked like it was ravished by wolves. The flavors were amazing and unique! My dining partner in crime is a vegetarian, so we always get the vegetarian dinner for 2. You'd think this would be disappointing after trying their amazing meat dishes, but it's really not! We always get the red lentils and yellow peas (my favorite!!!) and then try some new dishes. We also get the ib (it's a soft white cheese) and it's so nice to mix it with the warm veggies. It's tangy and delicious, and reminds me of raita (yogurt) on indian food. I'd recommend ib as a side dish to any meal here!!! If you are on a no-booze evening, the total for this meal is 30 bucks after tax + tip. Steal!  Ok... I could go on, but I won't. Simply put, Ras Dashen is amazing.

The staff couldn't have been nicer about it, I never felt rushed and they were pleasant without hovering.  They did a great job of explaining and recommending how to order for that big of a group. Most importantly, though, the food was bursting with flavor. We sampled the Ethiopian steak, a lamb dish and the doro wat -  which was so perfectly spiced I could have just had a huge platter of that, alone. I enjoyed the warm injera bread and pretty much all of the sides, and we finished it off with some Ethiopian coffee.  It was also refreshing not to pay overinflated prices for what seemed like a good amount of food. I really have no complaints about Ras Dashen except I wish it were closer to my neighborhood ... but even then, a simple bus ride on the 36 and what seemed like plenty of parking alleviates the distance obstacle.",0.9306,0.792,0.154,0.054,0.6483630952380951

Some dishes like the mushroom vegetarian special had the kick I like, and the vegetarian ""fish"" (chickpea balls in gravy) was excellent. The spongy bread reminded me of a dosa (indian) but a bit spongier. Overall, a good place to try. That being said, the service was terrible. The staff was pleasant but 40 minutes to get a drink? Really? Main entrees took 80 minutes from the time ordered, which is too long in my opinion. When asking for extra plates or more of the bread, we never got them.

Initially, I was extremely excited when a group of friends decided we should try this place out but was sadly disappointed at the end of the meal. Let's start with the bad: 1. The group of 6 of us was seated in the back room, in the back corner, with literally no lighting (okay, maybe there was 1 oddly colored lightbulb but that really doesn't suffice).  2. Really, a chicken leg & a hard boiled egg.. for like what, $10-$15?!! That hardly counts as a dish. National dish of Ethiopia, I'm sorry but I would never order that one again. 3. Service was beyond sloth-like. And now for the good: Injera was delicious & plentiful with free refills. It complemented the lamb & vegetable dishes extremely well- which is probably all that I would order if I ever came here again. Also, the Omnivore Dinner for Two is a great deal because it offers plenty of variety at a far more reasonable price.

2010-03-15,4.0,"I've had good ethiopian food in DC, which is known to have a lot of ethiopian fare.  every ethiopian restaurant i've been to (and i've had ethiopian in nashville, dc, chicago, and beijing!) it's always consistently good and no matter where i've had it, it's always tasted and looked the same - maybe that indicates authenticity?  i always walk away with a big full stomach. I tried something at Ras Dashen that was a little different from what i normally get.  I got an appetizer and tea.  The Qatenga, which are little bite sized rolls of their injera bread fried/toasted warm rolled with kibe, karya and garlic - out of this world.  tangy, warm, crispy.   the ethio chai, served with half a spoonful of sugar, really cuts into the Qatenga well.  soothing and relaxing. although i saw another couple sharing individual sized portions on separate plates, i think one of the main points of coming to eat ethiopian in america is the communal dining experience that other ethnic restaurants lack.  and by communal, it's not like family style in chinese food.  it's truly communal because you eat the food your partner touches, you grab with your fingers from the same pile of lamb ladled in spicy berbere sauce.  but one thing i noticed about the food at Ras Dashen that you don't have to share is the need to rush home to fight over the toilet either as is so often the case after eating indian food (yet we still keep going back to our favorite punjabi buffets b/c it's so delish).  =) yay.  my guess is the lack of dairy/cream in the curries/stews. therefore, if you want to prove to your date that you're bold, adventurous and have a taste for exotic food, but dont want to worry about not being able to get laid afterward because you have the firey shits, maybe give ethiopian a try(?) note: you can buy injera to go for $1 a roll i believe. For couples: the omnivore dinner for two is the perfect size.  very generous. pretty good deal in the end b/c you pick 3 entrees for the price of two. even though it says it's smaller portions, it's really quite enough for two. Tips: don't flick the curry/stew remnants from your fingers back onto the plate. it's unattractive, and takes away from the sensuality of the communal dining experience. =) People with kids: i saw a young couple with their young son, maybe 6-7 years old eating, all sharing from the same round tray.  he was well behaved and it seemed to be a fun cultural experience for him.  if your kids suck because they are picky eaters and like to play with their food, don't bring them. it will literally ruin yours and everyone else's dinner.",0.9917,0.78,0.153,0.067,0.45575396825396813

My husband and I are new to Chicago and being that my husband is half Ethiopian we HAD to find a decent place to eat Injera on a regular basis. We found Ras Dashen on Yelp (of course!) and we are sure glad we did. After our first dinning experience, we agreed that we would be regulars of Ras Dashen. Ladies and gents, this is as good as it gets in terms of finding an authentic Ethiopian restaurant in Edgewater (and really, in the north side of Chicago in general). Belly-filling Injera, diverse entrees/side-dishes, warm and friendly customer service, and an awesome, cozy atmosphere -- what more could you ask for? We've dined there twice now and while it seemed packed upon entering, we were seated immediately. Ras Dashen is definitely booming with business but preserving top-quality customer service. Menu Tip: The Omnivore Dinner for Two is an excellent deal. You can choose 3 entrees, and 3 side-dishes for approx. $40. The portions are an excellent size and you never run out of Injera. Also, if you're in the mood for a sweet treat try a glass of the 'Honey Wine"" or the 'Bread pudding' -- absolutely mouth watering!

After some girlfriends of mine suggested this place for our monthly girls dinner outing I was pretty excited to try this place.  I had experienced Ethiopian food once in the past at a different restaurant and didn't really like the experience - most likely due to the fact that I was a little overzealous and ordered goat just to see how it tasted.   This time I was planning on playing it a little safer.  We ordered the Doro Wat (chicken dish with a spicy sauce, it was listed as the National Dish of Ehtiopia so we figured we had to try it out), the Doro alicha (another chicken entrée), and the Zizil Tibs (beef with peppers)....plus you get about three sides so we tried some of the lentil options and the Ib (which is simply cheese).   When the food came they serve it to you on a giant platter with this spongy bread beneath the food and on the side.  Literally you do not even get a plate - at first we were shiftily looking around at the other patrons to see if we were supposed to wait for plates, but quickly realized you really just get right down to it.  I personally loved the food, it was spicy but not over the top, had a lot of flavor and was just so different (was reminiscent of Indian food, but different in a way).  I was glad we got the Ib (cheese) on the side as it helped compliment some of the spicier food options.  All in all everything we ordered was good, wouldn't have changed a thing.   The restaurant itself it pretty interesting looking, I would definitely say that this would be a great date place as the food and manner in which you eat it would give you plenty of fodder for conversation.   I'm looking forward to going back to trying out something else!",0.9906,0.866,0.123,0.011,0.5883357383357384

The original seating arrangement was a bit more open, but due to it's popularity it's a bit more cramped.  Onto the food... FANTASTIC. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING is just amazing here.  If you have never had Ethiopian food before, a few warnings:  Everything is served on the same platter (we do have vegetarian friends who request a separate platter as to not mingle with us meat-eaters). The platter itself is covered in a spongy, vinegary bread called Injera and you get additional Injera to eat with as a utensil. You simply tear off a piece of bread and go grab what you want on the platter. Several friends of ours are turned off by eating with their hands or others eating with their hands so I figured it was worth mentioning.  Back to the food.. Amazing, superb, sublime, unique and down right yummy. Plenty of veggie options (which I actually prefer most of the time) and the meats are cooked amazingly well with fresh ingredients and seasonings. The sauces everything is cooked in are very, very good. The best and worst part of the meal is when it's over. Best, because you get to eat all the Ingra on the bottom which has all the amazing flavors of the dishes you just ate! Worst, because it's over- sad face.  The meal packages vary but we typically get two entrees +3 sides which is a huge amount of food. The prices are, on average, very good for the amount of people eating! Cocktails are priced well and if you are a beer fan- try the Xingu. It's a Brazilian dark beer that is amazing; sweet undertones and not bitter.

Service and the food was great. We ordered the Doro Wat and the Asa Tibs.  Amazing delicious.  We knew the Doro Wat was going to be spicy so we decided to order another dish that wasn't spicy at all. Didn't make sense being on fire the entire night.  Then for sides, we ordered Ib, Qosta, and Yeqay tikil gomen.  All good choices.

Haven't been back to try the food again, but will get back around to it soon. Edit: Received a very even-toned, kind response from the owner and will give Ras Dashen another try in light of this. It is to any business owner's credit that they show such concern for each experience they create.. ======= Help was nice.... but.... 1) Amount of food was very little for the price. A tiny chicken leg and another non-descript piece of chicken meat for $16!? That is unacceptable in my book. 2) Food was somewhat bland. 3) Had an issue on the bill about gratuity charge. The menu versus what we were told seems conflicting.

I have no idea what it's called, but it has a flavor/texture similar to sriracha and is deeeelicious.  They'll put it right on the injera with the rest of the sides.   enjoy.  and then wash your hands again.  they'll be smelly for awhile.",0.9974,0.756,0.227,0.017,0.5577130186886283
2010-01-02,3.0,"I won't go into details about how Ethiopian food is served or eaten since there were a few other reviewers on here who's already done that. I'll just talk about the food. We all got the Doro Wat, Some kinda grilled lamb thing with no sauce, and a beef thing in a sauce that started with a B. lol Sorry about that, its been a few days since the actual dinner. But otherwise, the food was pretty yummy. Not too badly priced and worth the dough. The lamb was good and easy to eat since there was no sauce. The beef and chicken was swimming in a sauce so it was a little messier but still very yummy. The 3 sides we chose was the cheese (ick... there was a weird after taste), the spinach (Delicious!) and the cabbage (Boiled, stewed way too long). Would I go back there again?

2009-12-23,5.0,"Growing up in Washington DC (with a huge ethiopian population) I'm very familiar with the cuisine.  Ras Dashen was my first Ethiopian dining experience in Chicago. I was surprised at the freshness, quality and tastiness of the meal.  It was some of the best Ethiopian food i've eaten anywhere!! Ethiopian food is generally shared and eaten with your hands using injera (a spongey pancake/bread) to scoop the food up off the plate.  In the past I almost always  just order the vegetarian platter of 5, but here they didn't have that option.  At Ras Dashen we had the Omnivore platter for 2, chosing 3 sides and 3 main courses for $32.  It's a little more expensive than Im used to, but SO delicious and the portions are generous. We had -  3 sides: - a sauteed spinach side (Quosta) - a beet salad (Yequaser) - cabbage, carrot potato stew (Tikil gomen alicha) 3 mains: - Mushroom Wat (under daily vegetarian special) - Doro Wat (chicken and egg cooked in berbere sauce) - Yebeg Tibs (lamb with sauce) Everything was SUPER tasty.  I LOVED the Cabbage and Beet sides and the mushroom Wat and the Doro (chicken) Wat the best.  The spinach and the lamb were also VERY good. In addtion we ordered a bottle of wine with the meal.  It was disappointing, but the spectacular food more than made up for poor wine.  Next time we will probably drink one of their ethiopian beer selections, or the traditional honey wine. I'm so happy to have found this amazing spot in Chicago to satisfy my Ethiopian fix.  Excellent!",0.9964,0.751,0.222,0.028,0.6287848932676519

2009-11-16,5.0,"Delicious, delicious!  This place is much bigger than I expected and they do take reservations (a definite plus for late weekend dining).  They also have a full bar and quite a few imported beers that are not badly priced.  The staff is very friendly and helpful considering how often they probably hear the menu items mispronounced or need to explain something to the customers.  My recommendation is to definitely go with a group of at least 4, and if you aren't familiar with the food just take a quick look at the menu then be brave and order. You really have to try the dishes to understand the flavors.  And you will likely be surprised.  Personally I never imagined myself to be someone who would develop cravings for spicy lentils--I can't get enough of them.   Be advised that they do say orders will take at least 25 minutes to come from the kitchen and that they also charge for extra baskets of injera bread if you are a liberal eater of the stuff. This is not the cheapest Ethiopian restaurant I have been to in Chicago, but it is so far my favorite and the price points are reasonable considering the quality and that there is enough food that you do not have to order one entree per person. (we ordered 5 entrees for 6 people and had more than enough food) Otherwise, my favorite part (besides the communal eating style and that you are supposed to eat with your hands) is that they spice the food really well for my taste.  I don't usually eat much red meat, but I could not pass up the marinated sirloin (gord gord, i believe) and the subtle burn left after each bite.  Go with an open mind and an empty stomach and this restaurant will definitely deliver. ps: they have a hand washing station near the bar--a nice touch considering the meal style.  thank you to the owners!",0.9905,0.862,0.132,0.006,0.544017094017094

The vegetarian sampler is a must when you are craving rich and delicious, well seasoned veggies and legumes.  Cabbage takes on a whole new meaning when stewed and spiced Ethiopian style, garlicky and sweet...honestly, even if you don't think you like greens, I bet you will here. My favorite dishes are the Gomen (collards) and Misser Wat (red lentils in a sauce they call spicy but it really isn't too hot.) I recommend getting 1 salad (I got the Ethio Salta) as a contrasting element and palate cleanser. Veg heads will appreciate that vegan items are labeled on the menu. For dessert they even offer Chicago-based Temptations soy ice cream (as well as a molten chocolate cake, baklava, and other items that probably aren't authentic but sound great.) There are many meat items that look and smell tasty (I haven't tried yet, feeling so blissed out with the veg),  but I have noticed that my dining companions who get meat sometimes have to spit out some gristle or tough bits. They seem otherwise content. I haven't tried the gluten free teff Injera yet but will make a point to in future. (Have to request that the day before...so takes some planning.)

2009-11-16,4.0,"I just love ethnic food.  However, I never really had a chance to try Ethiopian food before, until a group of friends asked if I would like to join them here Friday night to see what it's like, and I said yes indeed.  All in all we had six in our party and since I was a novice to this type of food I'm going to share with you what I learned. I learned that Ras Dashen when translated means comfort food from the moutains of Ethiopia. I learned that handwashing is very important because there are no utensils, you use injera instead. I learned that it's ok to pig out because everyone else is and I just loved the communal nature of this meal.  It really brings people together.  Plus, the live music made the night very lively and enjoyable as well. Then I finally learned the names of all the dishes we had.  Here they are: * Ras Dashen Salad - similar to a garden salad but served with a light tangy dressing, this was a standard good choice. * Misser wat - red lentils in a spicy berbere sauce.  Quite delicious. * Gomen - chopped greens slow cooked with mild spices.  Milder in the spice category but good none the less. * Doro wat - this was my favorite dish of the whole meal and what it translates to is the chicken and the egg, cooked in a thick and spicy berbere sauce.  I also learned from our server that this is the national dish of Ethiopia.  I would recommend this one to everyone. * Yebeg tibs - lamb lightly cooked with onions, green peppers and seasonings.  This too was a nice balance to our more spicy dishes. * Kitfo tere - steak tar tar, yes indeed.  Most delicious and seasoned with kibe which is a spicy butter and a blend of crushed peppers.  Scrumptiously seared to perfection. Also, just because my friends and I are carnivores doesn't mean you have to be.  They also serve veggie friendly platters that will make you say yum.  So, don't be afraid to come here no matter if you're a carnivore, vegitarian or somewhere in between. All in all the service was great and friendly.  I can't wait to come back here again to try some of their other dishes, now that I know what to expect.",0.9974,0.766,0.211,0.023,0.5436965811965812
2009-11-01,5.0,"It only seems fitting that I choose Ras Dashen to be my very first review. Since my first trip there, it has become my favorite restaurant in the world by far and I have returned many many times.  Hands down, excellent food, period. I salivate during the entire drive to Ras Dashen in anticipation of eating there. I don't live especially close to this establishment, but it doesn't make a difference. I would follow these people anywhere. My fiance and I typically order a beef entree with varying sides. So far, we haven't found one side that we didn't love. The chilled lentils, the ib cheese, carrot/cabbage/potato stew, beets, and even the little salads with spicy Jalapenos- everything is awesome here. Extremely flavorful and satisfying. And of course, we both love the prices. I don't believe I've ever paid more than $20, between myself and my fiance, to eat here.  If you've got room for dessert, try to the bread pudding with ice cream.  The atmosphere here is another bonus. It is often busy, but we've never had to wait more than five minutes for a table. The service is generally fast. A few times we've had a wait a little longer, but believe me, it is worth it. The wait staff is courteous and prompt. On weekend evenings, there is a little band that plays great percussion-based groove music. It can get a little loud if you're sitting right next to them, so request a table further back.  There isn't a whole lot else to say that 140+ people have said already about this fine restaurant. If you're in the mood for something outside the box, try Ras Dashen.

2009-10-19,5.0,"Granted, I don't know that many restaurants in Chicago - compared to the average yelper;  It is only the second Ethiopian restaurant I've tried;  I have a soft spot for exotic, spicy. For those who care, they have gluten free injera (100% teff, no wheat flour); I think you have to call ahead to make sure, but they definitely make it. The regular is better in my opinion, but the all-teff is decent nonetheless.  Ras Dashen is one of my top three restaurant in the Chicago area. Just orgasmic. I would go there just for the music (their resident band, Magic Carpet, hits the spot every time): really, they're very talented, groovy, and non-intrusive in my opinion.  But then I have to mention the Asa Tibs (marinated, grilled tilapia and bell peppers - which is not a spicy dish btw) which is so wonderful, the injera (not as sour as the Ethiopian Diamond I found), which fills you up faster than you want, and just pretty much everything I have tried on the menu.  I have been there, I don't know, at least 10-15 times, it is consistently excellent. I am very happy to see that the service is still slow, and I wish it remains that way. Too many places focus on speed and efficiency; this place, well, it is a great reminder that it is, after all, African! when you go there, you take your time, wait for your food to be freshly made, really enjoy it when it arrives, and enjoy some of their excellent beers (check out Hakim) while you have a good conversation with friends, in a relaxed atmosphere, music playing if you're lucky, and just have a jolly good old time!

The waitstaff pretty much tripped over us every time they picked up an order.  Once we got the food, it couldn't stand up to Ethiopian Diamond.

2009-09-27,5.0,"Talk about an educational experience! A week ago I knew nothing about Ethiopian cuisine. It's not often that I actually need to do research before going out to eat. I was very impressed. The atmosphere was laid back (this was Saturday afternoon), the service was polite and helpful.  We started off with spnach sambusa, which I was later told was a precursor to samosa, which my research didn't confirm or deny. It was like a middle eastern spinach pie. It was good and spicy and was served with a kind of salsa. We ordered three dishes and three sides. Three sides are included per table, and you can get additional sides for a charge. Everything was good. The Asa Wat (tilapia) was tangy and spicy. The lamb tibs was very tender. The Doro Alicha (mild chicken with egg) was a little too mild but it was still tasty.  The entire meal came on one large tray accompanied by plenty of inerja, a sourdough flatbread. The bread saved our hands from getting too messy, but when eating with my hands I'm bound to make a mess. Who needs utensils when you have perfectly good hands to eat with? I wasn't used to eating in this style, but it was a lot of fun. For dessert we had the coconut creme brulee and ethiopian bread pudding which came topped with vanilla ice cream. Both were excellent, though the creme brulee could have been torched a little longer.  All this was accompanied by honey wine, which seemed to be recommended by everyone. I can see why. It was a little strong, but I loved how the taste of honey mixed with the spice of the entrees. It wasn't too sweet, but that was the first time I ever had honey wine so I don't really have a basis for comparison.  For those with dietary restrictions, the menu is vegan friendly. They even mark the items that are vegan friendly.  I'm glad Ras Dashen was my first Ethiopian experience. I will most likely be back. I heard they have live bands on weekends.

The first thing I noticed when walking into the Restaurant was the aroma of cooking food--making me very hopeful for a tasty meal.

Doro Wat (Chicken) Yebeg Tibs be berere (lamb) and Asa Wat (Tilapia). The sides we chose: Yeqaysur Salata (beet salad), Misser Salata (chilled lentil salad) and Gomen (chopped greens). Because everything is served on the large plate of Injera bread we all got to taste everything. For me, the lamb dish was the best one. From what I understand the lamb dish I ordered is just called ""spicy juicy"" and that's exactly what it was--spicy juicy. (YUM!) The Honey Wine was good. I also tasted the Ethiopian iced tea--if you like cardamon, this is one to try. For dessert we shared the Coconut Creme brulee and the Bread pudding--both very good too.

The restaurant had a very pleasant atmosphere - half the seating was American traditional, with square wooden tables and chairs. The other half was on lower, cushioned chairs, set around circular, brightly painted tables with woven lids. My boyfriend and I ordered the Omnivore Dinner for Two, which consists of three smaller-sized entrees and three side dishes. It all comes out on a huge, circular metal plate lined with injera, the sour, spongy bread you will use in lieu of utensils. It didn't look like that much food at first, but we were both ravenous, stuffed ourselves silly and still failed to eat it all. I know the lamb menu is mouth-watering, but I highly recommend you also order one or two vegetarian dishes! I really enjoyed the Yeqaysur salata, which was a chilled beet salad side dish. The ib, a fresh cheese, was something of a disappointment. I love cheese, but I didn't think it significantly enhanced the other dishes. I wouldn't order it again.

2009-08-18,4.0,"Up until tonight I had only been to one other Ethiopian restaurant [Demera] that I was not fantastically excited about.  I had also tried a more Eastern African restaurant that I loved, but went out of business [Bolat].  When I tried the Ethiopian initially it was not what I had pictured, and and had attempted to explain in class without actually having eaten it.  When I went the first time I was with a bunch of people I didn't know so well, and everyone else was meat eaters, so I had limited veggie items, and really had no clue what I was doing becuase none of us had really eaten Ethiopian. Tonight I was supposed to go to an organic restaurant with a girlfiend of mine, who much like me likes everything different.  She opted for either Ethiopian or Middle Eastern when we found out our initial choice was closed for the evening.  She offered up Ras Dashen -- her and her husband have eaten there many times and LOVED it.  I was ready to give Ethiopian another try, especially with someone who had been there, was veggie friendly, and knew what she was doing. So we got there, and the atmosphere was very good.  They have more American tables and then more traditional tables.  The wait staff was awesome and selected some great wine to us. I don't even like Chardonnay and he suggested a glass to me that I actually thought was really quite good. I don't know what it was, but I thought the enjera here was much better; wans't as sour tasting.  We did a 2 entree option where you get 4 sides with it.  We did tilapia which was delicious and then this more spicy okra and lentils dish which we weren't ecstatic about as we don't like spicey food too much, but it was still good.  Then our four sides were a beet salad, another lentil dish I believe, this amazing cheese and buttermilk dish, and then I can't even remember the fourth.  No complaints whatsoever!   I even managed to save room for dessert even though the enjera expands as soon as you eat it and you tend to fill full quite quickly; can see why they eat it in Africa when they don't get to eat so frequently.  I wound up getting a vegan chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream.  As a friend joked with me, ""That must have tasted grainy!?!?""  Honestly, and I don't know how they do it, it was creamier than most ice cream I've eaten.  My friend was full and wasn't even going to have some, and she helped me gobble it down. Overall -- fanatastic, and I would totally recommend it if you want to try Ethiopian, especially for the first time.  Also, going with someone who knows the cuisine, also really helps, as I pretty much had her order for the two of us!  Delicious!",0.9987,0.761,0.208,0.032,0.46642568542568535

2009-07-10,3.0,"My husband and I LOVE Ethiopian food and have visited quite a number of restaurants in the city. As far as the food went, it was great! I started with a salad of lettuce, carrots, potatoes, beets, cucumbers, with little slices of jalapeno and a very light dressing. We then had the Omnivore dinner for two with Tikil gomen alicha (cabbage, potato, and carrots), Ib (homemade cheese), and Kik alicha (yellow split peas with other spices) for sides, and Misserana bowmia (lentils and okra in berbere-mildly spicy), Doro alicha (chicken on the bone cooked stewed in a spiced sauce) and Yebeg wat (lamb in berbere - moderately spicy) for entrees. I had a glass of the iced tea (unsweetened Chai), and my husband, a glass of the Ethiopian honey wine (yum!). Everything was very flavorful. The injera (the bread), was moist and tangy, just as we've had and have grown to love.  For dessert, my husband enjoyed a warm, generous portion of baklava. I tried the bread pudding. It was made from the injera, and as a result was very, very moist, with a little bit of tang. It came with a side of berries, and was supposed to have had vanilla gelato on top, but apparently they ran out. Too bad: it would have perfected the dessert. The fusion jazz group in the corner sounded great, and provided just enough sound not to drown out the person sitting next to you. ""Sounds like a great evening, so why only three stars?"" The service. Sucked. We're not quite sure what was going on with our waitress, or why she appeared to be servicing tables from the very front to the very back of the restaurant. We waited for our drinks for ten minutes before finally having to ask for them. We placed various other orders with no less than three other waitresses (we added the salad late; she disappeared when it was time for dessert, and we gave our order to the woman who was working as the bartender.) Now, it's entirely possible, based on the interaction we observed between our waitress and the other staff, that she may have been new. But, by the time we sat down (we got a table in about 5 minutes at around 9pm), the dinner rush was subsiding. We had hoped that she would improve over the course of the evening. No such luck. So, our final conclusion was, the food and ambiance was really great (and the bathrooms were clean!), but the service was quite bad. We'll most likely return to our good-old Demera a few blocks south also on Broadway for equally good food, and substantially better service.",0.9898,0.815,0.131,0.054,0.5485900673400673

I've gone to the (up the street) competitor and for what I eat (vegetarian) I prefer the other place hands down. A couple things played against Ras Dashen 1) after choosing the 5-combo vegetarian platter, the pleasant waitress tells me that 2 out of the 4 items they didn't have.. I was going to double up on 1, so I am now left with trying to understand how you run out of vegetables and quickly decide on something else.  The waitress was helpful and accommodating giving suggestions. 2) What actually didn't help was when the food came out it was luke warm (this is after another waitress accidently gave us another parties food by mistake). So I am left with luke warm vegetables, 3 of which I really didn't want, but ate anyway and injera that made my taste buds question (WHAT?) prompting me to ask for a fork.

Luckily, this was not the case for us. We went here on a Wednesday night, got good street parking and good service (not great, but good) and got our meal way faster than I thought.  We had a meat combo dish (beef with peppers and the Ethiopian Special - Chicken with Egg), the vegetarian chick pea ""balls"" and for sides we had the beet salad, the yellow split peas and the green beans with potatoes and tomatoes. Everything was really great, except that chicken dish. The chicken is served on the bone, which is great for flavor, but not so easy to eat without utensils. There is also a whole hard boiled egg in there which is also hard to tackle with a piece of spongy bread and your hands. Most of the food we had (minus the beets and the yellow split peas) were pretty spicy. It was tolerable for me and my husband, but if you are sensitive to spiciness, you may want to ask your server what is best to order. My husband tried an Ethiopian beer, which was good, and their coffee. It's boiled and served in a clay pot. Our server told us it would be a 15 minute wait for the coffee. We were like ""dang"", but we weren't in a hurry, so we waited. It only took about 10 minutes and was, according to my coffee snob husband, ""decent, but lacking character"". The live music is horrible, BTW. It was some guy with a keyboard. Sounded like my overweight cat walking across a keyboard with some cheesy, elevator/cruise ship melodies in the background.

My wife and I are vegetarians, and Ras Dashen is very vegetarian friendly. We used to live in the Edgewater neighborhood and actually just stopped in one day when we went to Alice & Friends only to find it closed. I fell in love when I walked in and heard the Ethio-Jazz on the stereo. We've been back a handful of times since moving out of the neighborhood, and have enjoyed the experience each time. The closest comparison I can make for somebody who has never had food like this is that it's similar to Indian food, in that there are a lot of stews and spiced dishes and that you eat it communally with bits of bread and your hands. However the flavors and serving style are very unique. Injera bread is probably the most unique flatbread I've ever tasted. It's a spongy, sourdough bread, with a texture that kind of reminds me of a hearty pancake. The food is all placed onto a piece of injera, which is on a big round tray. You then share your food with the others at the table. If you go, I highly recommend sitting at a traditional low-lying wicker table if possible, because it condones itself to more conversation and a relaxed atmosphere. I highly recommend this establishment to anybody interested in the experience of Ethiopian dining.

2009-01-23,4.0,"This would have been an easy 5 stars if our server hadn't been so. incredibly. slow. (and just inattentive in general). We weren't in a rush, but having to ask for our check by cornering the server two separate times and sitting with menus, starting at every passing server for 15 minutes just couldn't make the 5th star happen. The food is great. I do recommend going early if you're heading here on the weekend because we got there a little after 6pm and when we were leaving (close to 8, yeah, I told you the service was slow), it was PACKED with people waiting for tables from about 7pm on. We took the train and had no troubles getting there. You can sit at the traditional tables (small, round table about the height of the seat of your chair), which we did, or a regular table (recommend for groups larger than 3-4).  Tried the honey wine (glad I tried it, but really sweet and acidic. probably wouldn't order again) and the coffee (FANTASTIC! Super dark and rich, served in a beautiful pot with small cups). We split the lentil sambusas which were recommended by our server and they were very good. I maybe would have liked a few more lentils, but delicious all the same.  We also ordered: Sides:  Qosta: (spinach, onions, garlic) Very tasty and quite a bit of spinach. Misser wat: (red lentils in spicy sauce) Also very good, but I thought this would be my favorite and it was great and spicy, but not as much flavor as I was hoping for. Kik alicha: (yellow split peas, onions, garlic and other good stuff) This one was AMAZING. All of us were scooping and even swiping our fingers on the edge to get every last bit. So much flavor! Tikil gomen alicha: (cabbage, potato and carrot stew) This one was also uber yummy and a nice contrast to some of the spicier entrees we got. Entrees:  Doro wat: (Chicken & a hardboiled egg in a spicy brown sauce) This was the national dish of Ethiopia I think and it was amazing. The whole, hardboiled egg was a little weird, but the chicken and sauce were spicy and incredible.  Yebeg Tibs Be Berbere: (aka Spicy Juicy; lamb stew) I liked this one a lot, but there was a higher than I'd like bone to meat ratio. The sauce was super spicy, but I like spice, so that was good for me.  We didn't have dessert because while waiting for our server, we gave up and decided we didn't need anymore carbs after ingesting so much injera (the sour, flat, spongy bread you scoop everything up with to eat). This was my first experience with Ethiopian food and it only made me eager to try more, so I'd say that's a pretty successful experience.

Consider this a 4 star only because it's a review from a guy that has not tried any other Ethiopian place. I'm a nut for spicy meals, and from meat to veggie dishes, Ras Dashen gives them all the treatment. If you've had Middle Eastern food, if you've had Indian, if you've had Mediterranean, there will be something familiar to you in their meals, but it's their bold taste and unique dining experience that set them apart. You can make your experience at Ras Dashen a little more ""traditional,"" if you like, by sitting at their Ethiopian tables that look like basket drums with a wood top (Note: you will have to crouch forward more if you use these tables since they're shorter and smaller than the standard tables you're used to.) I went with the traditional table because I felt like lounging more than just eating, and the decor of the place made me feel very comfortable. In the menu, they tell you the meal will take at least 20 min to prepare, so sit back and get comfortable. There are so many vegetarian dishes to choose from and plenty of meats to boot so I split the ""Omnivore meals for two"" combo with my date, and for $15.00 a piece we shared three entrees and three sides with a tasty Ethiopian beer ""Bati"" (extra of course) and we were filled and enjoyed that tingle on our lips the spices leave.

In place of conventional eating utensils is injera.  Injera is a kind of sticky and spongy bread that almost resembles a crepe or thin pancake.  You use pieces of it to scoop delectable pieces of  meat and soak up their  flavorful array of  sauces (I suggest the berber sauce).  If meat isn't your thing their side salads and vegetarian offerings are just as tasty.  Be forewarned the injera can be quite filling and the sauces a bit sweet, in addition to spicy.

The homemade honey-wine (not vegan) is really good too -- if you do honey.

Since a trusted friend took me here and guided me through the ordering process a couple years ago, I've made my way back several times and--in spite of the occasional slow service--had a wonderful meal every time. The food is rich with flavors that, were I a licensed gourmet, I would have complicated words for--words like ""broiler"" and ""nutmeg."" Alas, I'm just a guy who eats food every day. And as such, all I can say is that Ras Dashen is my favorite restaurant in Chicago because the food kicks ass. My favorite dishes are the sega wat, yebeg tibs, lebleb tibs, kitfo tere and qelulu. Of course, these names mean nothing to you if you've never eaten Ethiopian fare. You'll just have to trust my judgment and hardly containable enthusiasm ... or go to the restaurant's website and read the descriptions. The Hakim stout--a smooth, slightly chocolately Ethiopian beer--is a great complement to a meal. And the Ethiopian coffee is rich and flavorful. When you've stuffed yourself to the fullest, be sure to save your leftovers. Reheated Ethiopian food wrapped in berbere-saturated injera is tough to beat.",0.9911,0.751,0.202,0.047,0.6019755003450655

Beer selection is decent, seating comfortable, although some nights the place is totally packed (a good sign, admittedly) and the wait can be a while. It's worth it though.  Don't expect to use tableware though: The food is served in traditional fashion and you use the injera (spongy flat bread that is delicious and filling, but somehow not TOO filling, so you don't feel totally stuffed, but satisfied). I've enjoyed everything I've tried there, but am partial to the gomen, misserana bowmia, and misser wat. I don't eat meat, so I can't speak to that portion of the menu, but it is extensive and plenty of customers look satisfied by what they are tucking into, so I can only assume it's all good.  Also, try the groovy Ethiopian coffee that comes to your table roasted in traditional fashion (i.e. lots of smoke).  A couple times I've encountered wait staff that have been somewhat overwhelmed by the crowds, and so the service was a bit slower than one might hope. But not too bad. And usually it's just fine.

2007-09-17,5.0,"one must make a choice before they visit Ras Dashen--do you want to have a quick, good meal where they are waited on attentively? or do you want to have an EXPERIENCE? if you picked the first, please rethink that decision. :) because it's the most talked about component of Ras Dashen, i will address the service. it is not fast. it is however, friendly (not like a Starbucks barista ""friendliness"" style) and i have never felt rushed. my advice to those wanting to go to Ras Dashen is to go on a friday evening, have a snack before, and just relax. only then will you be able to enjoy the charm of this place.  on friday nights, Magic Carpet, a North African/Middle Eastern/jazz fusion band plays wonderful music.  now on to the food! this is hands down, five stars. i have loved everything i tried, with the exception of the soft cheese--ib (sp?). i highly recommend the tilapia--asa tibs. Sega wat and zilzil tibs are wonderful choices for beef-eaters. Make sure you don't leave here without having the misser salata, which is a cold lentil salad. I love this dish so much, I recreated it at home.  Beer, wine, liquor, and coffee/espresso selection is wonderful. they offer a nice variety of imported beers and wine (try Husker, Hakim, or Xingu, if you haven't before).  Save room for dessert! Baklava, molten lava cake, and coconut creme brulee (the latter is my favorite).  Just relax and  have fun (and don't forget to tip the band)!",0.9954,0.761,0.23,0.009,0.6639300411522633

So when she said,""Ok, let's try this place..."" I was really hoping it wouldn't disappoint.  The food was really excellent! Bad Ethiopian food is like a too heavily spiced version of baby food. This was anything but that! Great flavors and spice with all the meal. We had the ""meal for 2"" combo which included a sampler of 3 entrees and 3 appetizers for like $30. We were stuffed by the end of the meal. We sat at one of the ""traditional"" tables, which is quite a feat for me at 6'4"" tall. They had live music with a worldbeat/jazz quartet. They were really quite good. Highly recommended. The only bad thing was the service. We found our server to be MIA after the meal was brought to us. She never returned to check on us. So we might have liked more drinks or coffee/dessert but it was too late. quite literally, we sat at a barren table for 10 minutes waiting for our check. We even flagged down another server and busser to get our server to come back but to little avail. Now, maybe it was slow because it was Friday night?

2007-06-24,5.0,"This was our second experience with Ethiopian Food, and it was even better than the first (at Queen of Sheba).  Beginning with the ambiance, Ras Dashen's walls are decorated with interesting Ethiopian paintings, and a nice sound system plays pleasant Ethiopian folk music in the background.  There are 4 or 5 'special' tables made of a large wicker basket which has a large metal round top where the traditional serving platter is placed.  Around the table you lounge in cushened wicker seats.  We ordered the Dinner for 2 for $29.95 which included 3 sides and 3 entrees from a good assortment of traditional dishes, from which we picked: Dora Wat - chicken and egg cooked in spicy berbere sauce - it was good but on the bone; Yebeg tibs -- Lamb in a spicy sauce of onions, garlic and rosemary -- Excellent; and, Sega Wat - beef in fiery berbere sauce - really delicious.  Sides we chose were a yellow pea mixture, a kale collard and mustard green mix, and green beans with zuchini potatoes and carrots.  All of the above were, of course, served on the traditional bed of injera - a spongy bread used in place of eating utensils to pick up and eat with all of the food.  Additional Injera is also served separately so there is plenty.  We absolutely loved each and every entree and side -- our only minor criticism of the food being the chicken was on the bone so there was less chicken to eat than we would have liked.   Service was also delightful.  Our only other criticism is that it is not really Inexpensive as one would imagine, in part due to it not being BYOB.  (Meal with wine cost about $65).  But, otherwise highly recommended.",0.983,0.829,0.136,0.035,0.5779794079794079

Sure they are a little lousy with their service (hence the 4 stars instead of 5), even on a Tuesday night when you are the only one there, but boy, is the wait worth it!  I can't say enough about their entrees. My personal favorites are Lebleb Tibs, Doro Wat, Doro Alicha and Sega Wat. The veggie sides you get are not bad either. The Molten Lava Cake, which by the way takes 20 minutes to be ready, is to die for. The Sambusas are OK but I've had better. Their beer selection is pretty good, especially African beers. Harar- my favorite, Bedele, and Castle lager are a welcome change from other domestic and imports you get at bars. I tried a red wine once- nothing outstanding but then I'm a beer person so I don't know. It's hard to recall the countless number of times I've had trouble walking out of this place because I couldn't stop eating until the last piece of Injera disappeared. God bless Ethiopia!

When you order one main dish, you get to choose three side dishes.   For those who haven't been to an  Ethiopian place - They  serve all of your food on this humongous sponge like pancake. You take some of the pancake to grab food with your fingers. It gets messy, but so yummy.  I liked  Diblik atkilt and Gomen for side dishes. I tried my friend's entree, Zil Zil Tibs, which was really good.  My fish was spicy as it was supposed to be, and it had a really good flavor to it.  But the service really brings it down to three stars. The servers here don't even seem bothered that you have been waiting for a long time. They couldn't possibly move slower! They also have many interesting paintings on the walls, which was probably planned by the management to keep you busy with something while you wait for your food forever.

2006-06-18,5.0,"Totally love this place. The room is beautifully laid out and highly conducive to long, leisurely meals. And there's really no alternative to longness and leisureliness -- Ethiopian is a slow-food cuisine, and this may not be the ideal choice if you're just looking to refuel before doing whatever the REAL activity of the evening will be. On the other hand, if dining out is the centerpiece of your evening, run, do not walk, to Ras Dashen. The menu is simple: meat dishes come with three sides of your choice, which is nice for those of us (he sheepishly admitted) who can be a bit picky about our veggies. Happily, the vegetarian dishes are extremely diverse and lovingly prepared -- I would not hesitate to take a vegetarian or vegan friend here and skip the meat entirely. But it's damn fine meat: I had the zilzil tibs, beef strips sauteed with peppers in a berbere sauce that packs a serious punch without overwhelming the flavors of the ingredients. There is a full bar with nicely chosen beers, which adds to the desire to spend some serious time here kicking it with friends in subdued conversation. The service is friendly if a bit languid (which mysteriously seems to be a universal at Ethiopian restaurants), but the food is good enough to overcome such quibbles. The prices are a bit steep (figure $20/head as a minimum w/tax and tip), but the portions are HUGE -- I couldn't get through a standard entree, and I am not a man of small appetites. Three entrees, I suspect, would be more than enough for four people, and sharing is not only possible, it's pretty much a cultural imperative. In short, great food, decent service, and a nice atmosphere make this, on balance, a perfect choice for a large group, and the diversity of the menu makes Ras Dashen a place where vegetarians can break injera with carnivores, and the spice-averse can eat happily alongside the truly masochistic.",0.9944,0.772,0.186,0.041,0.6518027210884354
