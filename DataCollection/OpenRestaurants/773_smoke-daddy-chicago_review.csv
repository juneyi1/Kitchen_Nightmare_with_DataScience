The first time I came here was on a date forever ago and the date was eh but the drinks were pretty good! Ever since I moved around the corner one month ago, I've come here a bunch - I think 2 brunches, and two lunches in one month. The brunch is solid but my fave item is on the lunch menu - the Wrightwood Salad. Wow. The cornbread croutons are freaking out of this world. I would eat a plate of those. I also like the outdoor area and that you can bring your dog. I came here with two dogs the other day and did some work on their free wifi and ate a salad. It was a great place to relax.  I'm only docking one star because I reserve 5 star reviews for places that really knock it out of the park and while I do love this place, it's a solid 4 star place.",0.9918,0.744,0.229,0.027,0.5819444444444445

I'm used to smalller chopped tips because these were huge chucks of meat. Nonetheless it was flavorful and fell right of the bone. The Mac and cheese wasn't too bad. I took one star off because of the collard greens. Very little flavor... And there was a lemon in the greens. A lemon?!! Put some smoked meat and seasoning on these greens okay?

No one on the block is known for barbecue so if that's what you're craving, this is where you go. I don't have anything bad to say about the place. But I also don't have anything exciting to say about it either. It's just there. It satisfies that barbecue craving, but also doesn't leave you blown away or wanting to come back the next day.

We got the baby back ribs, brisket, hot links, mac n cheese, and hand cut fries. This all totaled out to be a little more than 26 dollars.  I started off with the mac n cheese. Drenched in the creamy, milky cheese it was absolutely delicious.  Next came the ribs, which were smoked well but didn't exactly slide off the bone. It took a little more gnawing than I would have liked. They were saucy enough that you didn't have to add more, but if you'd like I would suggest the sweet and smokey. The fries were shoe string cut and weren't that great.  I would say a tad too crispy and over salted.We noticed a lot of people getting sweet potato fries, which actually looked a lot more appetizing. Hot links were actually just a hot link cut in half, but so flavorful, had just enough kick. The brisket was good but nothing above the average.  I don't know about the ambiance inside, but outside at there patio there are four TVs going and it was nice and lively. The waitresses were all super friendly and patient.

We were married in February and Smoke Daddy did not disappoint. The food was delicious and people were raving about it.  In addition to the delicious food, working with Smoke Daddy's team during the wedding planning process was easy, fun, and always productive. We worked with Helena, who was awesome. She thought of everything and always had solutions to the things we needed to work out logistically. She worked hand in hand with our venue (Ovation) and our day of coordinator to make a smooth and thorough plan for the entire wedding day - so much so that I didn't have to do A THING. Which, as any bride-to-be can understand, that's all you can hope for out of a catering vendor. She also worked closely with us to make sure our we got the most out of our budget, while being mindful of our limitations. The bartenders and servers Smoke Daddy hired were stellar. They were constantly on top of their game, kept a great flow of drinks (so that people never had to wait in line at the bar), and were SO happy, upbeat and positive.

We got married at Ovation (Chicago) and were able to use whatever vendor we wanted so long as they had a license. We live in the Wicker Park neighborhood and have always loved The Smoke Daddy but never knew catering was an option. We only figured it out since a previous Ovation client had used them. Smoke Daddy doesn't advertise their catering services but they definitely should! Our entire experience with Helena and team was wonderful from start to finish! From the first time we met Helena she provided a fantastic tasting and thorough details on what they had to offer. We were worried that they wouldn't be able to provide formal catering but boy were we wrong! They offered all the same services as all the standard stuffy caterers out there but at a better price! Helena was so organized, answered all of our questions, offered suggestions we hadn't thought of and even remembered things we forgot. We cannot say enough good things about her as she was so professional and very talented in her role! Obviously, serving BBQ at your wedding is non-traditional but that's exactly what we were going for and it worked out even better than we had expected. I don't think many people can say that they had more than half of their guests come up to them and make mention of how fabulous the food was, but we did! It made us enjoy the evening that much more knowing our guests were well fed and happy! Helena and her team did an incredible job throughout the evening working hard to make everything perfect and go according to plan.

The wait was always insane, but the intimate space combined with gritty blues from the tiny little stage in the corner was worth the wait. It had a charm that sort of pulled you away from Chicago for a second. It was nice and relaxing (albeit still extremely crowded.)  Smoke Daddy today is much different. It has kind of a Buffalo Wild Wing's interior with lots of TVs and crowds of people that generally aren't there for the music. I know it's not really a ""venue"" so-to-speak, but something feels wrong about a table full of dudes cheering at TVs while an amazing musician is sitting a napkin's throw away. The original charm is, I hate to say, gone. That being said, the food is and has always been very good. It's on par with some of the better places in the city and has consistently proven itself worthy of being on the list.

2016-11-26,4.0,Service is always great as well as the food. Brunch here is delicious but very rich - even the lighter options are very filling.  Brisket skillet is a good portion with lots of flavor. The pork eggs Benedict is Spicy! So if you're not into heat avoid but if you are then this is a great pick! The hash browns are Super rich and cheesy - not your average breakfast potato dish. It's important to note that the menu is small but the prices are great for the amount of food you get. The bloody marys are not Point! They come with a little roll up of Brisket as a garnish and a side of old style as a chaser which is nice bc the bloody Mary can be a tad spicy. Over all a great place for brunch of you're looking for something a little different than your average diner food.

2016-11-06,1.0,"Irony is sweet - especially when it is dipped in barbecue sauce in the open air on Division Street. This restaurant serves (what might be) the best burnt end sandwich in the city while providing the absolute worst restaurant experience of 2016.   On the outset - no matter who cute and sweet you are (or try to be) when you greet the table - if you suck at your job - you should not expect a tip. This girl was the worst - ever.  (To be clear - despite the terrible service - I still tipped approximately 15%.) Let's start with my arrival. It took so long to get greeted - I almost left. I was at work and getting a dinner break - which I told the hostess. The waitress - eventually showed up and took my order. That was just about the last time I saw her except when she was servicing the tables next to me.   She did the ""ain't I cute?"" routine which was wasted on me. I was hoping for the ""here's your food"" routine. While I was waiting there were three smudgy old men a couple tables over smoking cigarettes. Really? Who the hell smokes in an outdoor restaurant? Who still smokes in 2016? These men carried on the loudest most obscene and misogynistic conversation I have ever heard. They were profane and sexually explicit and - frankly - repulsive. I would have spoken to my waitress - but she was MIA.  Turns out those disgusting men were the band Nigel Mack and the Blues Attack. So this is the pre-show? Telling disgusting stories about the women you've objectified over your career?  The food finally came - not from the waitress - from a guy who I assume is  manger based on the way he was dressed. He dropped the food and took off. He didn't even acknowledge me.  The food was amazing - better than I remembered. I saw my waitress about four times - she just never came to my table - she was busy doting over the couple at the next table. She walked right past me and categorically ignored me.  Finally I called her over and asked for a moist towelette and a napkin. She gave me a towelette and a wrinkled napkin. I had to wonder if it was used?  As I was wrapping up my meal - I was treated to another guest in the outdoor cafe. He came from between the buildings and was looking for crumbs. He had four legs and a really long skinny tail. You guessed it! The rat was scurrying around looking for a quick bite. As the rat scurried out of the cafe - the manager who brought my food tried to stomp on it as it disappeared into the night.  Not surprising - I had to seek out my waitress because I had to leave and she had no desire to bring me my bill. She was one of those servers who assume that one customer equals small tip. She has no idea.  What was once a great barbecue stand with great service and great bands - has turned into the embarrassment of Division Street. To be clear - the food is still amazing. The service is so bad - it doesn't compensate for the quality of the food. The rat was cute - but not my choice of a dinner guest.  Nigel Mack and his Blues Attack are disgusting and not worth a second of your time. They're smudgy old men who are trying to relive their glory days when they could use women and discard them and rationalize current marriage woes.    This is easily the worst restaurant experience of 2016.",-0.9098,0.775,0.104,0.121,0.5840476190476189

A glance at the menu and the fact that they have live music was enough to make us check it out. The first thing I noticed was the attached outside area. Even though it was not warm enough for us to be seated there, it already looked like a place I would like to go back to in the summer. The inside reminded me of the BBQ joints in Nashville, TN. A shot gun layout and old/modern country mash up decor made this restaurant really unique.  The service was great and our waitress was quick and attentive. We started out with the smoked jalapeño beer cheese. A semi small portion but a perfect size for a starter cheese. Very smooth with a good flavor and a kick of spice. For our main course my boyfriend ordered the ""Taste of the Daddy"" which is a choice of ribs, 2 smoked meats and comes with 2 sides (he got ribs with pulled pork and burnt ends with cornbread and coleslaw). A great spread of BBQ for the price. I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich with the mac and cheese as my side. The meats were tender and juicy with deep smoke flavor. My mac and cheese was creamy, had the perfect amount of salt and seasoning and had a great breadcrumb topping. I'm usually not a fan of coleslaw... but after trying it off my boyfriend's plate I ended up putting it on top of my chicken, delicious.

I'll preface by saying that no, this is not some sort of mindblowing, life-altering BBQ experience a la Franklin, Smoque, or Bryant's. However, Smoke Daddy does pretty much everything well. And has been a neighborhood staple for two decades, dating back before Division St. blew up.  The establishment itself is nice to look at. Ever since their renovations a few years back, they feature the original, classic dining room equipped with blues and music paraphernalia, a sleek new back bar perfect for catching a game, and of course, the beautiful outdoor patio.   The establishment is nice to smell as well, as you'll catch the alluring whiff of their delicious meats smoking from every corner of Division from Damen to Ashland. The food is solid. Everything I've tried has been decent, but I stick with the pulled pork, half-slab of ribs, or smoked links. Great side selections, to boot. The food is incredibly affordable, as you can get any sandwich plus any side for under ten bucks at dinner! Brunch selection is also tasty, if you're into dunking your brunch in BBQ sauce (I sure do). Great beer selection and a very tasty bloody mary if you choose to imbibe on your trip.  Excellent service is also a staple here. All the servers and bartenders do a great job.

I usually visit at least once every couple of years. I've noticed for at least the last 6 to 8 years, the quality of the food has significantly gone down.

She'd pointed Smoke Daddy out as we started down one side of the Fair, sharing an umbrella and wondering if an early lunch might be a good way to keep dry and compensate for the somewhat sad & gloomy scene (felt bad for the sellers protecting their crafts from the wind & rain). Anyway, the rain soon gave way to sunny blue sky, and by the time we'd made our way back past all the stalls (& after several purchases, and happy visits with several interesting dogs and a pet pig), we found ourselves and our grumbly tummies back at Smoke Daddy. It's not my fave scene or food type but wifey had a good feeling that this would be good--and was she right! (well, of course, she's already right, right?). Anyway, we both leaped at the brisket burger with onion rings. Sounded spectacular, what with its integral onion rings (a burger with a 'side inside'?), in addition to the included side dish (we chose coleslaw and sweet potatoes). The place was pretty busy, but service came fairly soon--got drinks and ordered, and it really wasn't long at all, but very well worth the wait. The burger was almost comically impressive with its three battered onion rings piled up beneath the upper bun. And the bun was nice - not at all soggy, floppy or limp, but a bun of substance and good texture. Meat and other fillings were generous, tasty and well put-together. Both sides were delicious, appeared to be freshly-made, and were generous in quantity. Very nice waitress and service, a very tasty and satisfying meal, and not a bad price, considering the location. We're not local, but I gather Wicker Park is getting very popular and trendy, so I really hope this place maintains the same formula and value--it's really nice to be pleasantly surprised, and that doesn't happen so often these days.

Man is that whole texting system handy! My friends and I sat in their sidewalk patio section. You can't really hear the live music out front which is unfortunate because it's pretty awesome; I've come before just for drinks/music. This was my first time eating here; I went with the 1/2 chicken platter with sweet potato fries and mac n cheese. My friends got the pork/brisket platter and the veggie sandwich. Everything was okay. Chicken was moist but didn't have a ton of flavor. I was pouring sauce on every bite. My friend said her meats weren't hot. Mac n cheese might have been the best part.

2016-06-26,3.0,"Just finishing our meal at smoke daddy with the family and would like to share a few thoughts. It's Sunday afternoon, so I realize that the barbecue is not going to be hot oft the smoker. That being said, I tried the baby back ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. The verdict: The ribs were very dry (weren't dry rubbed), not very interesting taste wise, very little smoke flavor and a bit over sauced. They were the type of ribs thaw fall apart, so over cooked, not really smoked. Pulled pork was over sauced as well, though the best of the meats tried. Again, no smoke flavor, not very much kick in the flavor. Brisket really disappointing, really fatty, again over sauced, zero smoke flavor. The sides were solid (Mac n cheese, beans, collard, etc).  I do quite a bit of smoking and I think the ""smoke"" in smoke daddy is missing. It's a great neighborhood, fun bar, great service, so it got the extra star.",0.9565,0.783,0.16,0.057,0.41939271255060734

Let me start off by saying one thing: It seems like the majority of bad ratings below are from people who identify as VEGAN or VEGETARIAN. This is a BBQ place- just stay away if you don't eat meat! After a long day of Bachelor Party shenanigans, our group of 8 stumble upon this place and we couldn't have made any better decision. After seeing the hostess, we were sat at our table within a minute with perfect view to the live band that was setting up next to the door. Our waitress came with the extensive drink menu and was probably the most knowledgeable waitress I have ever had, she knew EVERYTHING about the menu and always had recommendations. Overall, the service here was top notch. AND SO WAS THE FOOD!! I recommend getting the Smoked Meat platter, with the choice of TWO meats and TWO sides for about $15, and well worth the money. I decided on the Burnt Ends and Pulled Pork with french fries and corn bread- YUM. My friends also seamed to enjoy the Rib Platters and sweet potato fries as well. Overall, huge mistake if you don't try Smoke Daddy. Amazing food, drinks, and live band on a Saturday night- can't beat it!",0.9832,0.813,0.162,0.025,0.40750000000000003

I forget the name of my drink but it wasn't watered down or too strong.  My company were all very boring and ordered the same thing, a half order of rib tips.  They brought out so much food that it seemed like full orders so you get your money's worth.  They had sauce on the table but it wasn't needed.  Everyone raved about how tender and fall off the bone the ribs were.  They were all really in love with the food.  I had the burnt ends because they were out of brisket, and I had the pulled pork.  I was a little hesitant as I've never had burnt ends and thought they would be tough.  They were melt in your mouth tender and super flavorful.  The pulled pork as well.  The mac and cheese was creamy and seasoned well. I didn't care for the greens, but the beans and the chili were excellent.  This spot has the Best cornbread I have ever had, I could eat it by the truck load.

Being from Texas, my family boils greens, but Smoke Daddy sautés them in lemon and garlic. Unique and delicious! I also love the garnishment on the Bloody Mary. The warm brisket topper is beyond delicious, especially when you walk in hungry! If you're just looking for a bar scene, Smoke Daddy has that too.

I have a few friends that are from the south and they never have anything good to say about the BBQ places in Chicago. It makes me afraid to go to BBQ places because I feel like I'm getting bad food, but I wouldn't know because I'm not from the south. With Smoke Daddy I decided to bite the bullet and give it a try. Did they give me inferior BBQ? I have no idea. But it doesn't matter, because I personally enjoyed it.  The restaurant interior is cozy. It has less lighting than usual, but it doesn't make it gloomy at all. Instead it kind of makes it feel cozy. There are TVs everywhere, so if you're a sports fan you'll be able to get your fix while eating. They also have someone singing live at the front of the restaurant. The sound quality of their equipment is superb. I couldn't even tell it was someone singing into a microphone. Onto the food! I got the Smoked Meat platter. I chose to get the brisket and the hot links for my two meat choices. The brisket was pretty darn good. It had a good amount of fat to give it some extra flavor, and it was tender. I barely felt like I was chewing on it. I actually enjoyed the hot links more. There was a fantastic smoky flavor to them. I got no cartilage in the sausage either, which was heaven for me (it grosses me out).  I got mac-n-cheese and fries for my sides. The fries were good, but a little average. The mac-n-cheese was sooooooo good. It was creamy and cheesy. The portion was a good size too. I doubt I would have been able to eat anymore than they gave because it the richness would have been overwhelming. I can't imagine not getting the mac-n-cheese next time I got there. The BBQ sauces were a little lackluster. The original tasted fairly similar to the sweet and tangy. They didn't taste bad, but they didn't stand out at all. The mustard base BBQ sauce was more my jam. I chose to put that on my brisket after I ate the pieces that had the original sauce by default. I even dipped my hot links in the mustard BBQ sauce, though they didn't need it. I'll definitely be going back to this place, and I might even bring my southern friends to see what they think of it.",0.9735,0.764,0.137,0.1,0.591304347826087

Lots of tvs, live music all the time, been in the neighborhood more than a few years (a rarity in Wicker), and always makes the surrounding block smell like smoked food.  Gotta love that.

2015-12-21,5.0,"Six Words: Get the delicious Adult Cherry Coke! Smoke Daddy is the kind of barbecue I've been looking for across the city: lowkey restaurant with good food. I like a fancy restaurant ... at times. But most days, I'm looking for good food somewhere that makes me feel like I'm a regular the moment I walk in. That is Smoke Daddy. I came here around 7pm on a Saturday and the place was buzzing but we were seated immediately. Located on Division, it's near a bunch of barbecue places and bars, but there was a steady flow of traffic all evening. The booths are bright red booths - the kind of booths I've only seen in movie diners. So I was quite happy to stumble upon that.  Drink menu is pretty large. I was seated across from the bar and it's well-stocked with all the liquors. I opted for their Adult Cherry Coke. From the menu: ""It tastes like cherry coke and Seagram's Stone Cherry Whiskey gives it a kick."" It was perfect. I ordered one and my roommate ordered their cider, tried a sip of my drink and ordered one for herself. It's really good. For dinner, I opted for the Daddy-O sandwhich: sliced brisket, provolone, and onion rings with a side of fries. It's delicious in a ""I don't mind that I'm consuming a million calories and my heart will probably regret this in 10 years."" It's a beast of sandwhich that comes with some barbecue sauce on it. Personally, I found it a little dry so I just dumped more barbecue sauce on it. Then it tasted perfect. It was a smokey barbecue sauce that they make/manufacture/label/whatever themselves and it's amazing.  My roomate ended up with the Rotisserie Chicken with a side of collard green and Mac and Cheese. The chicken was seasoned deliciously - I wished I stole more than one bite. The Mac and Cheese was mehh (Lillie Q's has better Mac and Cheese). What was truly surprising was the Collard Greens. Normally, I don't find Collard Greens entirely delicious. But my roommate spent a year in Georgia and that's what she missed most from the South. So when they arrived on the table and tasted as delicious as they did, she fell in love with Smoke Daddy. And I have to say, they were the best Collard Greens I've ever had.

2015-11-20,2.0,"This was the very first place we went to in Chicago and was absolutely the most disappointing. I had high hopes with the catchy name, outside facade looked cool, and who doesn't like BBQ? We were seated in the front room almost behind the hostesses, not realizing at the time there was another room for seating. It was not busy at all and the room seems dark and dank. Within minutes of being seated the flies descended upon us- gross gross gross!! We were absolutely starving and still waiting on the third person of our party so we ordered the pimento cheese hushpuppies. They came out quickly but were not what we expected. I am from the South and I am very well acquainted with both pimento cheese and hush puppies. These were essentially liquid cheese on the inside and had no corn meal or anything resembling a hush puppy? The only positive part of the meal was a local beer called half acre daisy cutter, a pale ale for $6. It was delicious and we all ordered several.  After realizing there was a larger seating area with bright windows in the next room we asked to move and they said ok. We were much more comfortable after moving. The service was extremely poor and despite it not being very busy we felt neglected. We ordered brisket nachos with no onions and extra cheese. Well of course they come loaded down with onions and essentially no cheese. We send them back with a guy from the kitchen and he was actually very nice (he is also the one that helped us move tables since our waitress was no where to be found). The second batch of nachos arrived sans onions but weren't good. The ""brisket"" did not seem fresh or of very good quality. Overall, this place would have been fine for drinks, but I would skip the food and go somewhere else.",0.4083,0.78,0.106,0.114,0.4179205094422487

The restaurant is much larger than it appears upon first walking in. The decor is perfect for a BBQ restaurant.We were seated very quickly. I really wanted to try the Bloody Mary that comes garnished with warm brisket & pulled pork as well as a pony bottle on the side but I wasn't sure I could handle it since I'm not a huge Bloody Mary fan. They have a decent selection of craft brews which I liked. My wife ordered Coop's Biscuits & Gravy and I of course ordered the Pulled Pork Benedict. Both these meals were delicious!! I have never had anything like the benedict & the hash browns that came with it were amazing as well. The only thing that kept this from being a 5 star review was the service was a little slow.

2015-10-02,5.0,"I wanted to share a story about exceptional customer service & amazing food.  I was in Chicago this week for work - we stayed out by O'Hare. I used to live in the city and thought before I head home, I should go to the city to get my husband a pulled pork sandwich from his favorite BBQ joint. It was 8 am and they didn't open until 11. I was fully expecting to have to 1) wait and 2) deliver my husband a cold, hard pulled pork sandwich.  I got to Smoke Daddy's around 9:30 AM and saw people inside. So I went in and said I wanted to place a to-go order. Josh, the owner said sure and wrote it down for me. He asked if I was going to eat it right away (who eats BBQ at 9:30AM) and I told him, no it will be for supper, I have to drive to Iowa. He was curious and asked why I came in and I told him about this place being a favorite spot of ours.  He put the order into the computer, called to Tai downstairs and asked her to pack everything up to go in a cooler for me. Told me how to heat it all up for my hubby so it would taste just like the restaurant. I left with double the food I ordered, 3 bottles of BBQ sauce and a smile on my face thinking ""best wife ever"". All before the restaurant even opened.  Imagine how I would have felt (and was expecting to feel) if he told me they weren't open yet. This experience confirmed for me why we love this place so much. The food is so good that my husband has literally been coming home, eating leftovers and then telling me ""hi"". He used to eat here after our dinner dates (solo) when we lived in the city.  Awesome food (from the pulled pork, brisket, mac & cheese, cornbread, and sauces + great customer experience = worth the drive in, every time.

They were good, nothing to rave about but nothing to complain about either. For our meal I got the Wicker Park omelet, which was underwhelming.

We live in Indiana and traveling to have a tasting was well worth it. After tasting salads, ribs, pulled pork, cornbread, corn on the cob, macaroni and cheese, baked beans, potato salad and their great assorted sauces, we were sold! Everything was fresh and delicious!

2015-07-04,2.0,"The nice patio lured me in from a bike ride on July 4, but I wish I had kept riding by. Service was decent but not impressive, the food came up quickly and the patio is wonderful, but those are about the only positive things from my experience.  My sweet tea was so watered down it was barely sweet (I added a sweetener!), and the meal got worse from there. I ordered the combo sandwich with pulled chicken and pulled pork. It's an ample sandwich, but the plate was either too big or my order of fries was too small. The sweet potato fries have a cinnamon/salt dusting, which is tasty. Unfortunately, the meats come drenched in sauce! If your meat is so bad on its own you have to soak it in sauce, then you should rethink your recipe. I think the pulled chicken would have been good on its own -- seemed moist and flavorful.  The bone I bit into was not as enjoyable. The waitress came by to take my nearly clean plate and I mentioned the bone. She apologized and said, ""Oh, that's not supposed to have any bones."" Obviously. Perhaps sensing I was unhappy, the manager came over and apologized too. Neither of them offered even a coupon for a future visit or dessert. Heck, no one even offered me a refill on my $3 sweet tea. Chicago and especially Wicker Park have so many wonderful restaurants, so it'll be a long time before I stop in at Smoke Daddy again.",0.9715,0.734,0.168,0.098,0.6965379602476375

2015-06-30,3.0,"We finally decided to give Smoke Daddy a try yesterday for my birthday. I debated between Smoke Daddy, Smoque, and Wrigley BBQ. I've been to Smoque (see my review), so I decided to give Smoke Daddy a go instead.  We got there around 6pm on a Monday night and were able to find paid street parking pretty easily about a block or so away. It was a rainy night, so we unfortunately didn't get to sit on their patio, which is absolutely fantastic. There's basically two sections of the patio, one out front and then one on the west side of the building that's a half-in/half-out type of patio. It's really a good looking spot right on Division, so the people watching is spectacular. My fiancé ordered their strawberry lemonade and she absolutely loved it. I had a taste and it wasn't really my thing, but I can definitely see how it would be refreshing on a hot summer day. We wanted to make sure we covered all aspects of the BBQ menu on this visit, so we ordered a decent amount of food for two people. Also, it was my birthday and I wanted to be in a food coma by 8pm. Mission accomplished. She ended up ordering the ribs & chicken platter, while I went with the brisket and pork platter. We also ordered sides of mac n cheese (2), beans, and sweet potato fries. The ribs were absolutely fantastic. We got the baby back ribs and they were some of the best I've had in Chicago. They were tender and fall off the bone, and they had just the right amount of sauce. Not too little, not too much. The chicken was just eh, there really wasn't anything special about it. The brisket was tremendous, tender and not over cooked. I'd give it a B+ and would definitely order it again. The pulled pork was unimpressive. I think they used the mustard style sauce on it or something because it just wasn't very good. It lacked the spicy/sweet/tangy style that I like. I wanted to try one of the sauces on the table with it, but the pork is completely covered in sauce when you get it, so I was out of luck there. I'd give the pulled pork a C-.  The sides were decent sized, but not enough to share if that's what you're thinking of doing. The mac n cheese was good, not great, but definitely good enough to order again. It came in almost a coffee style mug and complimented the BBQ nicely. The beans weren't very good honestly. It definitely seemed like more of a chili rather than beans, but I wouldn't recommend the beans. I think my mom makes the best beans, so I have high expectations as is. The sweet potato fries were just that, sweet potato fries. Honestly nothing special but they were fine.  The service was good. We had a very nice waitress who gave us her honest opinion on what to order. I asked her how the cornbread was and she straight up said it's hit or miss, so we obviously decided to skip it. Unfortunately, she did recommend the beans and those turned out to be a bust.  There are plenty of TV's throughout and on the patio, so it seems like a decent spot to watch a game. They also have a nice bar area and I think the high tops in there are first come first serve, so that's an option if it's super busy.  Overall, I wish I could give this place more stars because of the cool atmosphere and killer patio, but the food turned out to be average when you consider everything we tried. I would definitely recommend the ribs and brisket, but stay away from the pulled pork, chicken, and beans. Next up is Wrigley BBQ, but honestly it's going to be REALLY tough to beat Smoque.",0.9986,0.741,0.192,0.067,0.6180571863448575

Highly attentive wait staff and even the MOD came over to check on us (not because we complained or anything...just because he's a good manager). The service, I'm afraid, was the only good part of our experience. I've had a lot of good BBQ in my life, being a southerner and from a state where brisket is a religion. BBQ is kind of like politics....everyone has their own opinion. But this BBQ isn't debatable....it's simply BAD. The collard greens. Those poor, barely-cooked collards! Has the chef never had proper collard greens before? They need lots of time and love so they can be edible. These were thrown in a pan for couple of minutes....not good for digestion and not tasty either! The meat. Sampled 3: the brisket, the pulled pork, and the baby back ribs. None were tasty and none were done right. The brisket was sliced super thin like a lunch meat. Brisket should be sliced thick and fall apart when you stick your fork in. The pulled pork...well, I don't know what it tasted like because it was slathered in mediocre sauce. The ribs were dry....cooked way too long. We were immediately confused as to how a BBQ joint that has been in business for so long could get so many crucial things wrong.

2015-05-23,2.0,"Ugh, why do I bother. I can't even comment on the mediocrity of the meats ( I tasted three). I am here to lambaste the heinous treatment done the collards. I consider myself part Southern (that's another story, but I got qualifications) and as a Suthner I expect my greens to spend a lot of time in a liqueur of meat,spices, and some vinegar, long enough until the greens and other ingredients make something sublime.  Now I completely understand that in this hyper competitive food world that Chicago has become, getting edgy is the name of the game. Can't something be said for tradition? What Smoke Daddy is serving up as ""collards"" is nothing more than a fistful of greens tossed in a saute pan with garlic,oil and a prayer, just looking at them I busted out a ""WTF!"" I have had this preparation with spinach in many an Italian house or restaurant, nice tender greens that shrivel to 1/10 their size when subjected to the abusive heat. Collards don't play that game. Without time and temperature to brake down the fibrous stalk that runs through the center of each leave you are left with a tough raw tasting green that may I say is a bit harsh on the digestive tract, but I digress.  Since Smoke Daddy has such respect for the institution of Southern Style BBQ they offer NC style, only a $1.95 up-charge, sounds like a bargain right? Until you realize some one charged you 2 bucks for a nickel worth of coleslaw. I didn't order this option, but rather tossed a few of the raw collards onto my mush brisket to give it some texture. Reminds me of those math problems where a bunch of negatives go into outer space and come back a positive. Something like that.",0.5787,0.829,0.087,0.084,0.4117155992155992

The two sides were equally meh: the beans were overpowered by the spices, and the mac and cheese just didn't have that tangy cheesy flavor. But what was really the low point for me was how they handled their seating. I showed up solo and when I told the hostess outside it was one person to eat, she told me to go inside and didn't take my name. Inside, there were no seats at the bar and nobody was there to help me find a table. This is where things really bungled: after a beer, I found a different hostess, who told me the only place to sit were the tables out on the sidewalk, not heated as the temps dipped to about 50 degrees. When I explained to her there were two open small tables in the heated outdoor area, and I wanted to be in a warmer area, she checked and came back to say they were ""reserved.""

Met the GM and her was so humble & worthy of reviving my compliments.  Wish the menu was a little more expansive, but this is their concept and it works extremely well. The wings were so good I myself ordered a 2nd round of wings. I always order coleslaw when is a house item, and I did and should have gotten 2 orders, my twin ate half....  Russ ur a Punk.  Had their Barnhouse Smoked chicken salad with the goat cheese and rstd red peppers. I'd be back simply for that salad!! My twin had the corn beef sandwich feature the server recommend and it was simply on point. Our sever was also a hair dresser and she was so awesome to share her life with our conversations!!! Love that real human touch to a dining experience. They ran outta brisket so I'll be back for that and their desserts.  -Bathrooms were not really on point, not that that's a deal breaker on a Friday night at 11pm.  -would have loved some smoked oysters/ salmon -hostess was more worried about what was going on in the BOH than getting us a different table that we were looking for.

2014-11-09,3.0,"Went there last night with party of 18 people for a birthday party. We came up all the way from the south suburbs and I had high expectations of this place. First off, the service was some of the best I've ever had. Our server spent a lot of time going over the beer list and bringing people samples to try. She also went over the menu and answered any questions we had about the food and the preparation. When asked for anything at our table she was right there with it. Awesome service! I ordered a dinner that came with a 1/2 slab of ribs (baby backs) and two smoked meats (brisket and pork) and two sides (mac & cheese and sweet potato fries). Most everyone at the table ordered some type of rib dinner and a few people got sandwiches. Unfortunately, the low point of the food was the ribs. When taking a pole of everyone at the table who ordered the ribs (everyone got the baby backs), the rating was a 6/10 score. The ribs were dry and somewhat burnt or over cooked. And they were VERY salty. A few people didn't finish their because they thought they were too salty and dry. I was also drinking lots of water all night long after eating mine. The smoked brisket and the smoked pork were very good. Both were moist and flavorful. The people at our table who ordered the chicken said it was very good too. My mac & cheese was very good, thick and cheesy. Actually my favorite thing of the night was the sweet potato fries which were awesome! They were crisp and tasty with a dusting of cinnamon. I rarely finish my fries with a dinner, but I ate each and every one of my sweet potato fries. They also had a good band that started playing shortly before we left, and I wish I could have stayed to watch them.

I enjoyed them, but not all would.) This is very much a BBQ joint in the Kansas City tradition, tending towards a sweet, mesquite flavor.

It came with apple cider vinegar which just isn't my thing. Quickly remedied that by adding the sweet and smoky sauce, which was pretty good but not the best bbq sauce I've ever had. There are 3 bbq sauce options on the table and I sampled all and only cared for the sweet & smoky.  Not terrible but not great.   My date ordered the pulled chicken and he too didn't care for the vinegar taste it had. He also added the sweet & smoky which he thought was amazing bbq sauce, I disagreed.  Now onto the impressive things!  Sweet potato fries - yum! They're sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.  Mac & cheese - creamy, cheesey, delicious.  Key Lime pie - phenomenal. Some of the best we'd ever had.    However, the best thing about this place is the Not Your Father's Root Beer Float. NYF root beer beer is hands down my favorite beer. It's 10% alcohol but drinking it you would never be able to tell - dangerously good. So to see that they had this on the menu as a root beer FLOAT, and then topped it with HOMER's ice cream blew me away.  I grew up eating Homer's ice cream in the north suburbs but have never seen it anywhere in the city, until now. They added a vanilla vodka shot and this instantly became my new favorite alcoholic treat. :)   Worth noting that on the way out I noticed they had live music, which I loved.

The waitress kept trying to avoid us and when we asked, just said the kitchen was busy and our food will come out soon. We were pretty fed up since the party of 2 next to us came in after us, got their food, ate it, and paid their bill before our food even came! When the food finally come, a different waitress brought it to us and said that it was slow because we ordered from the brunch menu. We asked to speak to the manager because that didn't make sense. The manager was super nice and apologized right away instead of lying and making up excuses. He wasn't really able to give us an explanation of why it took them that long to cook, but he did reassure us that it usually only takes 9 min for the food to be ready. And then he proceeded to pay for our bill, which was nice. So all in all, the food (pulled pork Benedict and burnt ends sandwich) were good, but the long wait completely ruined our mood to enjoy the food.  So basically, the waitresses at this restaurant should learn to not lie to customers and the managers are nice but could be more proactive and warn customers when their wait time for food is unusually long.",0.9847,0.8,0.151,0.049,0.5839415182518631
2014-09-10,3.0,First time here was during brunch so I will come back for a proper BBQ and update!  I ordered the pulled pork Benedict. I had never had even a regular eggs Benedict before. Mistake.... If you are not a runny yolk fan tell them to give you your eggs hard or scrambled. I had no clue. So you can laugh. Anyway I kind of scraped the runny yolk away from the rest of my delicious breakfast!! The muffin had a mass amount of pork on it! Delicious flavor and it was perfectly tender! There was this chipotle hollandaise sauce that was out of this world!!  When the waitress said the hash browns came in a square I was a little nervous. They were so good! Creamy and flavorful as well as nice and crunchy!! I could not stop eating them well beyond my point of fullness! I will be back!!,0.9747,0.771,0.183,0.046,0.5108516483516483
2014-09-08,4.0,"If you like sweet Kansas-city style bbq, this is the place to go. If you're looking for more vinegar-y Carolina style bbq, you may not want to stop in.  Went on a Saturday afternoon with the boyfriend and we both ordered the burnt ends sandwich Carolina-style (with coleslaw on top). Here's why I thought this sandwich was fantastic: 1. The burnt ends were great! They were moist and flavorful and had very little of the super-burnt/dry pieces that burnt ends often have.  2. Coleslaw was perfect: light on the mayo, had a lot of vinegar, and had large shards of cabbage and carrots, instead of being shredded down to nothing. 3. Brioche bun was buttered and held up to the moistness of the filling. 4. I loved the sauce because I really like sweet and tomato-y bbq sauce.  5. Comes with a side--which is great b/c some other bbq restaurants don't have this option (Lillie's Q, tsk tsk).  This was the perfect sandwich for me. However, boyfriend did not like it because Smoke Daddy does not carry a vinegar or mustard based bbq sauce; those are the only types he likes.  Speaking of sides, I had the cornbread: it was sweet, had bits of corn and jalapeno in it, and tasted like it was baked with some of the meat drippings. Yum! Boyfriend had the sweet potato fries, which were ok.  I also had a $5 Smoke Daddy Anniversary Ale, which was malty and refreshing (not to mention cheap compared to the rest of the beer choices!). Server was quick and attentive. They have a nice area out front to eat as well. Definitely try the burnt ends sandwich if you like sweet/tomato-y bbq.",0.9957,0.796,0.2,0.004,0.6747100122100123

We were sat at a dirty table, but they did clean up the table fairly quickly once they noticed the table was dirty during seating. The menus where also dirty covered in what appeared to be salad dressing. We ended up getting the dressing all over our hands. Not cool. The server was fast and good at her job. We ordered burnt ends and pulled pork with hand cut fries and collard greens. The fries where cold and the meat portion was tasty, but cold as well. The collard greens aren't the typically barbecue joint collard greens. They decide to make theirs without pork belly, which takes away from the flavor. Their version of collard greens is heavy on olive oil and garlic. It's good, but not what you expect it to be.  I'll give the place one more try when it's not as busy and post a follow up review.

We ended up getting the rib platter which comes with your choice of ribs, two sides and two smoked meats for a very reasonable price of about $23. We got the baby back ribs, hot link and upon Jenny's recommendation, the burnt ends.  So why the 3 stars? Well, I think BBQ is very personal in that some prefer BBQ that is sweet, some prefer BBQ that is spicy and others prefer BBQ like Smoke Daddy's, that is super smoky. I am not a super smokey BBQ lover. In fact, why I don't eat too much BBQ is because of the smokey flavor. So it's just my personal opinion that Smoke Daddy's is a miss.

We needed a slice of Key Lime ASAP. As well as a round of Bell's Oberon. A beer made for summer days. It's been a mild summer this year, and we were enjoying the crisp, skin burning sun. Everything was perfect. The pie arrived before we placed our lunch orders and we just dug in. Damn. That was a good slice of pie. Perfect, classic Key Lime. You cannot go wrong with that flavor profile. Acidic, tangy, sweet and creamy with a perfect graham cracker crust. Smoke Daddy's pie delivered, which got me excited about my BBQ! I ordered the smoked meat combo which offered two choices. I focused on the KC Style burnt ends and the Pauliana Market Hot link. I also ordered the slaw and mac & cheese.  We also ordered a ""not your father's rootbeer"" which is an intense 10% smack to the liver. Very nice. Anyways, my food was seriously good. The mac & cheese was dense and delicious, and my slaw featured unexpected jalapeno and cilantro notes. The BBQ was really really good! Not perfect, but like... dictionary perfect for BBQ.

Just a good ol' fashion bowl of incredibly bad for you melted cheese noodles.

We ordered a drink and no sooner did we get our drink then we were told our table was ready. Way faster than 20 minutes clearly. Our waitress was great. She was friendly, checked up on us regularly, and explained the menu very well.  We ordered the smoke jalapeno beer cheese for an appetizer. Yum.  For my entrée, I ordered the Chicken & Ribs Platter. Probably because I was still expecting to be disappointed by the Ribs.  OMG - Fall off the bone, perfectly seasoned, absolutely amazing. The ribs were perfect! I should mention the chicken was also delicious, moist, and perfectly seasoned. But the ribs are definitely what's bringing me back.  The mac & cheese was super creamy and had a great crispy, bread crumb topping.

Hands down the most food we've eaten and the quality was super. For $45, we ate like kings. We both got the smoked chicken and ribs dinner, which came with two sides. We both chose rib tips to accompany the chicken. While flavorful, the meat was a little too tough and chewy for my taste.  However, we both scraped every last shred of edible chicken off it's bones. Moist and delicious. The mac n cheese is very rich, but the collard greens were nice and smoky.

The macaroni serving initially seems small, but is jam-packed and so rich, it ended up being a perfect amount. It stayed hot throughout the whole meal and was really tasty. The pulled pork came as thick chunks in their signature sauce. The sauce definitely was smokey! I got the smoke taste first, then the sweet of the sauce. They had two other sauces on the table which I also tried- all very good, but nothing that totally blew me away.  I also had a sangria to drink. I thought it was just sweet enough, and was a nice portion for $6. The sandwich was only 8.95- a steal in the city! You'd pay just as much for some crappy panera sandwich!

We then ordered the Mac and Cheese to share. That was some pretty good Mac and Cheese. No complaints there. For our meal we split the pulled pork sandwich and got a side of sweet potato fries.

For an appetizer we went with their version of nachos, which were loaded with pulled meats and chili, plus the requisite cheese and sour cream.  Epic!  We all agreed on that. Skipped dessert, so nothing to report this time.  Nice selection of beers, too.

After speaking with what seemed like countless catering vendors in an effort to find great quality local food on a DIY budget, we were really pleasantly surprised at how easy to work with and responsive Kayla and The Smoke Daddy team were to work with. They talked through everything with us, shared sample menu items, and were friendly and professional throughout, providing us a level of customer service you'd expect from a more formal (and expensive) restaurant.  They easily fielded a flurry of last-minute requests, made themselves available beforehand to check out the venue and helped keep everything running seamlessly perfect throughout, even providing some gluten-free buns for some of our friends who we knew would need an option.  They were able to provide servers, help with breakdown, and even provided a couple great, friendly well-trained bartenders to serve the craft beer and good whiskey we picked up from Binny's, which allowed us to offer up great drinks for a fraction of the price of most bar packages we would have otherwise purchased.   Most importantly, the food was impeccable. Brisket, pulled pork, smoked chicken, mac n' cheese, fresh green salad - not a clunker in the bunch. We've got a big smoker in the backyard and are pretty serious about authentic smoky-ass BBQ, and these guys delivered on every level. I must have been asked a dozen times who our caterer was, and my wife's coworkers still mention it two weeks after the event.

The sides...mac and cheese.  Decent.  Very velveeta stickyish.  Cole slaw...I hated it but it's not really their fault.  I can't stand cilantro and I had no idea there would be cilantro in it.  On a freshness scale, I can attest that the cilantro was very VERY fresh.

Had sangria which had no flavor. Sad. The guys had beers which is tough to wreck.  Quantity of food was great. Many left overs and we were all stuffed!

The bread is VERY tasty but you need to eat fresh!  After two days, the cornbread became very watery and we had to throw some extras away BUT DEFINITELY really tasty.  -BBQ chips (awesome!) -Salad (amazing- one of my favorite items from the menu) -Coleslaw (not made with MAYO- definitely a huge PLUS) -BBQ Beans (wasn't a huge hit at the party but I personally loved the flavor and thought they were really tasty).

2013-07-08,4.0,"WARNING | ALERT | FLASHING RED LIGHT HERE ** This is a vegetarian review of Smoke Daddy, so move on if you don't care. I just thought this would be helpful to those out there who, like me, have a Dad visiting that must have at least a few bareknuckled handfuls of meat with every meal, but who themselves are weak, malnourished, protein deficient little dainty vegetarians like me. **.  So, yes, as a vegetarian, I'm giving Smoke Daddy 4 enthusiastic stars. Here's why:  Barbeque:  Hahahaaaehh no, they do not have vegetarian barbeque, exactly. If they did have a succulent seitan version of barbeque, this would be a five star review and I'd have a booth permanently rented out. What they DO have is a boca burger sandwiched between a thick layer of cole slaw (non-mayo kind) and a layer of the usual sandwich veggies. Which makes for a damn good start to a vegetarian bbq, even if you aren't a boca fan, which I'm usually not. Once you have one of their 3 signature sauces dripping off of everything, nothing else much matters except the mess you make of your face.  Mac n Cheese: The mac and cheese was right up there with some of the best I've had. Thick, hearty, cheesy, with a crispy breadcrumb topping. Presented in a decent sized bowl with the cheese all crusting onto it. It's enough to make my Georgian mama proud. Very filling, like spackle for your tummy.  Sweet Potato Fries: Everybody has sweet potato fries or tots now, don't they? Seems to be the rage. Well, I give some extra kudos to Smoke Daddy. These are seasoned perfectly, with enough cinnamon and sugar accents to make them interesting and addictive, without going overboard and insulting your pancreas (Im looking at you Lonestar).  Service: The lovely gal who waited on us was on point. Super friendly, helpful, patient with my dumb questions, kept our drinks filled, and otherwise left us alone to have a nice lunch.  So how about it, Smoke Daddy.. want a five star review from a vegetarian? Get that seitan in the pressure cooker.",0.9951,0.693,0.213,0.094,0.5433106575963719

We sat at the bar since the wait for a table was way too long. That would be fine if the service had been slightly friendlier but I wasn't too impressed on that front from the get go. We were in the mood for ribs so we decided to share the ribs sampler (st louis, baby backs, and rib tips) to really get a feel for the place. We went with 3 sides (coleslaw, baked beans, and collards) and what the hell, why not throw in a half chicken for $4.25 to really try it all. First off, the ribs arrived fairly luke warm, and that would be fine if they were amazing and succulent and meaty but they were not. They were dry and often hard to chew, and though there was a decent smoke ring, I could hardly taste the smoke through their overpowering dry rub laced with far too much black pepper to ever taste any other subtleties. Bummer on that front. If I had to pick a decent one of the bunch it would be the St. Louis. Next, the sides. Loved their slaw. The only thing we loved actually, with a good combo of fennel, carrots, red and purple cabbage, and a nice light dressing, likely tossed nearly to order in order to keep it from getting limp. Baked beans were good, if not cloyingly sweet. Lastly, the collard greens must have been a joke. They are a joke, right Smoke Daddy? A pile of greens arrived, huge uncut leaves, that had been steamed and tossed with garlic for all of 3 minutes, rendering them inedible and tough, impossible to chew through, given that we all know these need a slow braise to make them palatable. If you are going to put collards on the menu, learn how to cook them. Their sauces are fine, but they need something added to the mix (they offer three) to break up the sweetness. The house sauce that is already slathered on everything is decent, but nothing really stands out about it. The mustardy sauce was okay but was lacking the punch I was hoping for. Lastly the darkest (brown sugar based I'd guess) had an undeveloped flavor and left me wanting for a fourth sauce, something more Carolina based, to cut through the richness of their dry bbq.

We gave it a second try a few months later. The food tasted as expected, but i remember the sauce not tasting right. Later that night, we got sick again. This time I knew it had to be their food, and we had decided to stop eating there (as it was still a good drinking spot). We decided to give their food another shot since they built a new patio area, so we went there with a group of friends. I must say the patio area they built is awesome!

2013-03-02,4.0,"I used to live about 500 feet from Smoke Daddy, just south of Division on Wood. It was my roommate at the time's favorite restaurant and we would regularly order take out from there, hang up the phone, count to 50 and leave to pick it up. It would almost always be ready by the time one of us got there. If you don't think that's impressive then I feel sorry for your sad, empty existence. The move here is to get either a combination of ribs and beef or a combination sandwich of pork and beef. As one of your sides, I recommend getting the baked beans, which have so much pulled pork in them, it almost makes it pointless to make pulled pork one of the meats in your combinations. The Smoke Daddy has, in my opinion, the better meat of the 2 Wicker Park BBQ joints, but Lillie's Q's sauces are better. The ribs are clearly slow cooked, as evidenced by the fact that the area around my old apartment regularly smelled like delicious ribs at 9 in the AM. Really, what I need, and, quite frankly, America as a whole needs, is a transformer-style combination of Smoke Daddy's meat and Lillie's Q's",0.955,0.857,0.108,0.035,0.5307692307692308

There is often a wait, even on weeknights, but they will take your cell phone number and call you when your table is ready.  Since there are a number of bars nearby to grab a drink I don't have a problem with this.  We've also called in pickup orders on Saturday evenings and they are ready quickly.

The restaurant had the Chicago landmark attitude with the best service in the world. The real reason why I am here to Yelp though is about the food. We went on a Wednesday where the special was $2 Miller High Lifes and Dollar wings. We took advantage of the beer, and opted out on the wings for this aventure and got the pulled pork sandwich, and a full rack of the St. Louis Style Ribs. When we made our order we asked our server which was the best and rather than just saying one, she told us about each of them and how they were differently cooked and what that meant for taste, flavor, and gave us a better idea of the difference. The sides we had were the cornbread, mac and cheese, and the french fries. All were amazing and perfectly complimented by the sweet and delicious taste of the barbecue. I have had many many ribs in my time, but without a doubt, this was the first time I have had sweet, tender fall off the bones ribs that were just right. The pulled pork sandwich was amazing and not one thing was sour about our experience. Justine our server was great, very personable, and gave us an amazing night to remember. The place is currently undergoing expansion, and sometime in the Spring they plan to open up an entire wing with more seating and as the wall says, ""A Bigger, Better SmokeDaddy.""

The situation: I made reservations for a group of ten people on a Monday for the following Saturday. I talked to a gentleman who informed me they wouldn't take reservations for large parties after 6 p.m. (we wanted to eat a bit later), but could make an exception and get us a table for 6:30. I took the reservation since this place is small and I didn't want our party of ten to wait for a table. Fast forward to Saturday. A portion of our party arrives at 6:15 p.m. The place is packed and I assume the large party seated near the front must be finishing up because that's clearly the only place to accommodate ten people. I check in at the hostess stand and they don't have our reservation listed. That's the worst thing you can hear when your responsible for making reservations for a large group. I had them double check the list and NO reservation. They wouldn't be able to seat us for more than an hour and the bar was packed. The manager promptly addressed our situation, gave us a free drink and expressed his apologies. When the rest of the party arrived, we decided to leave.

Do NOT skip the cornbread. It's a Smoke Daddy must. The only thing some people may not enjoy is what I think makes Smoke Daddy that much better.

Smoked chicken wings: A. These were seasoned well and had good smoke flavor. Sides: A. The four sides we tried were very good: sweet potato fries were crispy; coleslaw was fresh with cilantro and just the right amount of mayo; collard greens weren't southern style, but very tasty sautéed with garlic; beans were meaty and flavored with BBQ sauce. Spare ribs: C. Not very meaty and possibly boiled or braised so that the meat was overdone and missing great pork flavor. Being smothered in BBQ sauce didn't help. Pulled pork: D. Dry and lacking in flavor. It was mixed with too much sauce, which didn't improve things. Brisket: B. Decent flavor and juicy, but sliced super thin and (again) drowned in sauce. Service and atmosphere: A. We enjoyed sitting outside and had attentive service. Overall: D. I'm always going to judge a BBQ joint on pork, and Smoke Daddy didn't deliver.

The fries have changed.  They used to be more like hand cut, perfectly fried steak fries. Now, they are smaller more in the style of McDonalds.  They were also not fresh.  The portion was seriously small, maybe 4 ozs.  They needed salt, but there was none available on the table, although this is best done after coming out of the fryer.  This rush for diminished quality seems to happen to restaurants that get long in the tooth.  PLEASE TURN BACK THE CLOCK, SMOKE DADDY.  I'm hungry for some great bbq!  I will say that they still do get the smoke right...",0.9792,0.798,0.169,0.034,0.48898809523809533

This is a recipe for disaster as you have to cook collard greens a little longer to remove the bitter taste out of the greens. If these were mustard greens then maybe you could get away with that.  Greens are not like Spinach!  Secondly, the mac and cheese had no flavor. I really didn't think you could mess up mac and cheese, but after 2 bites I stopped eating them as well. I'm not sure if the bad flavor of the greens messed up the flavor profile of the mac and cheese???  The brisket sandwich was good. Not the best brisket I ever tasted, but I enjoyed it.

2012-07-05,1.0,"Well my friends, gather round' and I'll tell you a story that is the truth, the whole truth so help me GOD!!! and nothing more. Alas on this, the fourth of July my fiance and I decided we had a taste for bbq.  We live in the bucktown/ wicker park area and we heard of the puke daddy, I mean the smoke daddy and saw it at the taste of chicago last year.  We read the reviews and thought hey we might have a good bbq joint right down the street let's check it out.  So we went, from the moment we walked in to the time it took for someone to realize we were waiting for a table was ten minutes.  Ten minutes of loitering around the host station with employees staring at me and saying nothing, giving me looks like why am I here.  Once we were seated we sat in that excessively hot restaurant for twenty minutes before we had any contact with another employee(the hostess said that she would bring us some water)  In the end we sat at the table for 25 minutes until we got some water which the ice was completely melted out of, and the place is so unorganized that a few minutes later a waitress put two more cups of water on the table and then after a few More minutes another waitress came to put water on the table, saw four cups and stopped and went back.  Keep in mind that we have now been sitting her for 30 minutes and have not been able to place an order.  The group that came in before us sat on one side of us.  They received prompt service and got their drinks, food and ate and paid the bill all before we even ordered.  Two groups that came in after us sat right next to us and they received their drink orders and food before us, and they ate and paid their bills all before we even received our food, BUT THEY CAME IN AFTER US!!!!!  Ok, so after 30 minutes of sitting there, the waitress finally comes and takes our order.  My fiance ordered the sangria and I ordered some rum drink with ginger ale, then she ordered the burger daddy style and I ordered the taste of daddy with St. Louis Ribs, pulled pork and brisket.  She didn't bring our drinks out for twenty minutes.  By the way, I am being completely honest about the time, I started timing these happenings with my stop watch function on my watch.  By the time she brought our drinks our food arrived five minutes later.  I was also surrounded by a bunch of weird hippie bastards that thought the nasty food was good, but they all attacked their food ravenously and shoveled it into their mouths so fast I doubt they tasted it.  Watching the ""hipsters"" in wicker park eat smoke daddy's disgusting food is reminiscent to watching homeless people fight over a sandwich or two dogs with rabies going at it over a turd. So now the food.  I thought that it was going to be pretty good.  I was so horribly wrong.  The fact that they would even serve something like that and try to pass it as good food to paying customers is beyond me.  To be honest, my fiance's burger was not bad it was ok, mediocre but nothing spectacular.  Jake Melnick's or Kuma's Corner have infinitely better burgers.  My food was attrocious I didn't even finish any of it.  The pit beans were not bad, macaroni and cheese was not bad.  But that was the best part of the meal.  The ribs I was served were not only burnt, but tasted like meat that had been cooked on a grill that wasn't allowed to burn all of the lighter fluid off yet.  Delicious lighter fluid gasoline ribs, what more could you want?  I know what that tastes like because I made that mistake when grilling for a bbq a long time ago when I was FOURTEEN!!!  Pulled pork was horrible mostly fat and burnt.  The brisket was ok but nothing special.  A bbq joint is supposed to serve good bbq.  I would feel bad feeding this crap to someone's dog, it was just disgusting.  I didn't finish the ribs I just couldn't eat them.  I almost never ever tip below twenty percent but I could not give our waitress a good tip and still sleep at night.  But then again I couldn't sleep last night because of the stomach cramps, excessive heart burn and soon to come explosive diarrhea I was soon to experience from crap daddy's.  My advice, if you want good bbq, do it yourself or go to smoque, they're pretty good.  The sauces at smoke daddy were actually good, however there was nothing worth putting it on.  How can you expect people to pay for this horrible service and disgusting food.  Also I want to point out that I have never written a review in my life, however I was so appalled by this experience that I had to create an account and post a review.  If this review saves one person from the culinary hell that is ""the smoke daddy"" I will be happy.  I seriously don't know where all of the good reviews are coming from, probably from starving ""hipster"" bastards that have never had a family bbq.  Please, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.  DIE SMOKE DADDY DIE!!!!!",0.939,0.772,0.125,0.104,0.5674475986975989

The hostess then sat down four people in the booth who arrived after us, despite the fact that only two people were seated there previously. When I asked why she seated people who came after us, especially in the same booth that only had two people in it before hand, the hostess started apologizing about how she doesn't know the policy about seating and how the policy is not clear. Folks, this is not a new place. Its been open way too long for this nonsense. She then moved us to a booth later, while we waited another 20 minutes for it to open up and the people who came after us already had their food. Neither the hostess or the waitress did anything like a free drink or appetizer or anything that a place usually does when the service is bad. Worst of all, my brisket sandwich had such little meatIi got something somewhere else after.

2012-05-28,5.0,"This review is for Smoke Daddy Catering. We essentially picked our wedding reception venue because we saw that Smoke Daddy was an approved caterer.  We love their food, and now we love their catering service as well. The food was as delicious as ever and really lends itself to serving large crowds.  We eat a Paleo diet so BBQ was pretty ideal for us.  It's food that is mostly paleo friendly, while still appealing to a large audience.  We did add the mac n cheese, for the few vegetarians who mentioned that they were completely satisfied.  The pulled meats were perfect, and a few of our family members even went out of their way to tell us that they loved the coleslaw!   On top of that, the service was outstanding.  Smoke Daddy took care of everything.  We asked them about a cheese and cracker plates for cocktail hour at the last minute and they were on it.  Another last minute addition was including a vegan meal for one of our guest's plus one.  While we were slightly concerned for the vegan's health, Smoke Daddy didn't mind and took care of the issue with no problem.  We went with a buffet line for the food, but they did a great job of bussing tables and making sure everyone had water, and serving coffee to every table post dinner.   Our favorite perk of having Smoke Daddy cater the event, was that they boxed up all of the leftovers and set them out for guests to take with them.  Talk about a great wedding favor!  All of this, and we really didn't even notice the until the night was over and they started to clean up, so to say that they were unobtrusive would be a gross understatement.  Yeah, that's right,  they'll cover the clean up if you need that too.   Long story short:  you want to please a large group of eaters and have a great event?  Choose Smoke Daddy Catering - Tai and her crew were awesome!",0.9968,0.771,0.209,0.02,0.5593143738977071

2012-05-13,3.0,"We stopped at Smoke Daddies because my very hungry boyfriend saw it out of the corner of his eye as we were driving by.  We parked right in front on the street with no meter fees!  We were immediately seated. My boyfriend is the meat eater and I am the vegetarian, so of course and ironically , I asked about vegetarian options in a rib house.  The server recommend 3 options: the fish sandwich, the veggie sandwich or one of their salads.  I decided to go the veggie burger so that I could try one of the many BBQ  sauces on the table.   I also got a side of greens, which were veggie friendly, e.g. not cooked with pork.  My boyfriend ordered a half order of ribs with a side of sweet potato fries.  Now my boyfriend never leaves a piece of meat behind and he left half of his  half order of ribs on the plate and wanted to leave.  He was extremely disappointed with the taste and texture of the ribs and there was not enough of the variety of sauces to enhance the experience.  The veggie burger was okay, which I accepted as I was in rib joint.  The BBQ sauce options were interesting and I enjoyed the spiciest one on the table. To my surprise, the greens were actually quite tasty. So in the end the vegetarian came out with better gourmand experience over the meat eater in a rib joint!    So I will not necessarily say I would not recommend the place, but I know my boyfriend and BBQ aficionado will not be going back.  I,at least,  left slightly satisfied with what I had, having gone in with low expectations.    So for my veggie folks, if you are with a crew of friends there, you will be able to enjoy a meal and not be left out of the BBQ sauce experience.

We were STARVING, so we were anxious to place our order.  Since there was an abundance of servers buzzing around, we figured it would be easy to place our order.  Wrong.

I usually sit at the bar, where the conversation between strangers and servers flows comfortably. I like the tunes (Motown/R&B/Bluesish) and they are not above putting a game on the TVs. The food is great, in my opinion the best BBQ in West Town. I recommend the St. Louis Style Spare Ribs, but any of the sandwiches will do just fine for a lot less money. The sides are good, I really like the beans and the collard greens. The mac-n-cheese is good, nothing outstanding. Everyone raves about their sweet potato fries, but I hate those things in general. I would like to see a creamed spinach added to the sides, as well as some cheesy grits.  They have a full bar with a good beer selection and knowledgeable bartenders. Their cocktail selection extends well beyond the ones listed on the menu. I had my first, and still best, Hot Toddy here on a cold Winter afternoon. So, why four stars instead of five? The prices are just high enough to dissuade me from going here more often. I understand that businesses will charge what they can, but some of the prices at Smoke Daddy are way too high. There are no cheap beer options ($4 for a PBR or Lonestar?), while an Allagash White that would be $5 most places is $7 here. The draft beers are also all at least $1 higher than elsewhere (Who in their right mind would pay $6 for a Guinness?). The food is not any cheaper. The sandwiches seem like they are reasonably priced, but you have to pay an extra $1.50 for bacon or Carolina Style. Some of the platters and ribs are in birthday-dinner-only territory -  $16.95 for a half-rack of baby back ribs is pretty ridiculous.

When it came out, the sweet potato order was about half the amount of the regular fries.  Sadness. The mac was pretty good, had bacon in it which added the porkiness factor that can elevate a dish.  The fries were a bit on the soft side, not crispy at all. which usually happens when the blanching cycle becomes the cooking cycle.  I used to fry food for a living, those taters could have used a rest and re-fry IMHO.  And those sweet potato fries?  They were just okay. The part of the meal that really shined through were the chicken and the ribs, which had great smoke flavor imparted through to the bone.  The ribs were tender and had the right amount of char, while the chicken had the juiciness that comes with brining, but if they don't brine their chicken, I need to know what their secret is. I also had their Famous Bloody Mary which has a splash of Guinness in it, and a garnish of brisket and pulled pork, olives and cucumber.  Almost a meal on it's own, I mean, it's got all the food groups represented - Meat, Vegetable, and Alcohol!  What's not to like?

For sides I got the creamy mac n cheese and a bowl of beans. The mac n cheese was simple but fulfilling, and the beans were incredible. The beans were spicy with a deep barbeque flavor and filled with succulent pork. Honestly, I would go back for the ribs and sides, but I wouldn't order the pulled meats again. They were just standard, while the sides and the ribs really took the center stage. Not only was the food great, the service was incredibly quick.

You pay the price$$ for it though.  Music? Great! Customer service? HORRRRIBLE! We had to wait over an hour for 3 people. Yes I realize that it was a Friday and they were busy but the two groups after us were served approximately 15 minutes before us. Our waiter literally came to our table (already looking unpleasant), asked for my boyfriend's and mothers drinks and skipped me! That is a pretty standard server rule. How do you miss someone at a 3 person table? The manager noticed at one point they we were looking unhappy and went to grab our drinks.

The slaw here is NOT the creamy kind for those looking for a traditional white slaw.  But it is awfully good.  Might be just a trick so you don't feel so guilty eating everything else on your plate.  Maybe.

They use a house mix which you can buy a bottle for the cheap cheap price of $5(which we did). The mix had everything going right for it. Just the right amount of horseradish and was smoky, salty and delicously spicy. They serve it in a pint glass with a skewer of the smoked brisket and throw in a baby sized bottle of miller high life.

Smoke Daddy by far has my favorite sauces in chicago.  Their standard sauce is an awesome vinegar based product ( right there with the great Kansas City sauces , like Gates and Oklahoma Joe's. Being a KC guy, this is a huge compliment.)  Their mustard sauce is as good as I have had outside of Austin Texas's Salt Lick. Pulled Park sandwich...excellent flavor, juicy and not too big.. same can be said for the pulled chicken. Both the baby back and st.louis ribs are great.  The St Louis style edges em out because I prefer the tougher texture and there was more meet on the bones.   I like these items so much I have not tried the brisket yet but I am sure it's strong. The beans were excellent, plenty of rib tips in them and generous bbq sauce portion.  The sweet potatoe fries are excellent. Best part, I get to go quite a bit because my wife loves it too.  Shes not a meat eater or rib off the bone type, but she craves their smoked veggie burger and the veggie of the day is always to her liking.   The pulled pork nachos and the smoked chicken wings are so damn good  I have some buddies that get them for dinner and skip the sandwiches and ribs. Music on weekend is  fun.  Great, fun staff that brings your food very quickly.  We threw an event there for our friends and clients and they were thrilled with the evening. Only thing keeping this from a 5 star are the ribs...they are great just not the best in town..  Will be visiting Fat Willy's soon and reporting back on their ribs.  BUT Smoke Daddy has the best sauce in town and the best pulled pork sandwich I have ever had.  So far, Smoke Daddy is the finest BBQ place in town.   ( excited to try Fat Willy's and give Smoque one more visit. and will share any thoughts.",0.9977,0.71,0.245,0.045,0.5895734126984127

With the exception of bacon, I am not a fan of seeing fat on my meat.  I've really been spoiled by the brisket at Smoque...maybe I should just stop getting it at other places because it's always a hair disappointing, even if it's good. This brisket would have been ok if I didn't have to hack off the fat.  For my sides, I chose mac and cheese and baked beans. I liked the mac and cheese, but those beans blew the roof off the place. I am not a huge baked bean gal, but I could have just eaten these and been happy...for real.  Finished up with some banana pudding...banana pudding is absolutely my favorite way to get my potassium (don't tell the members of my medical team), and this did not disappoint.

2011-07-07,3.0,"It's amazing to me just how long Smoke Daddy has been around. I remember coming here in '95 when I lived just a few blocks away. I was something of an urban pioneer back then as the neighborhood was completely different than it is now. My neighbor was a waitress here so I'd come in pretty often, and let's face it, there weren't a lot of restaurants in the area in those days. We'd eat at SD, then head next door to Czar Bar. Ah, good times. I had all but forgotten about Smoke Daddy, but summer is all about stuffing barbecue down my gullet and dining outside as much as possible, so a fellow barbecue devotée and I dined here last night. Parking is a lot more of a hassle than it used to be, but that's gentrification for you. After driving around for a while, I finally found a spot on a side street, so I suggest avoiding Division Street. We were able to get a table outside which made me happy, and we settled in to look at the menu. I started with a ""Porch Swing"" and my friend went with the ""Southern Belle."" My drink was muddled cucumbers, gin, Pimm's, and a splash of lemonade. Unfortunately it looked and sounded better than it tasted. We moved on to the main event and the reason we came here: barbecue, and lots of it. I had skipped lunch and I was plenty hungry so I went with the rib and chicken platter and my friend went with the smoked meat platter. For sides I chose the sweet potato fries and mac and cheese and my friend had the smoked pit beans and mac and cheese. Oh, and I added a side of hand-cut fries. Don't judge, I was hungry. The food came out pretty fast, which I guess is a good thing. Everything was fine, but nothing had me jumping for joy. I'll elaborate: ribs - fall-off-the-bone tender. I am not a fan. I prefer to have to ""tug"" a bit when I'm eating them. Who doesn't love a good tug? chicken  - skin was not crispy, which made it kinda gross. sweet potato fries - pretty good, but why does every place feel the need to put some kind of sugar/spice on the fries? Why mess with a good thing? mac and cheese - don't know how else to describe it other than it's simply too creamy. I like mine a little denser. hand-cut fries - the first order we got was terrible, like they were ""held"" too long in the kitchen. The replacement order was much better, especially dipped in the barbecue sauce. My friend also chose to indulge in the banana pudding, which was a generous portion topped with fresh bananas and Nilla wafers. I didn't try it, but she seemed to enjoy it. Service was fine too. Our server was friendly and got the job done, so no complaints there. I'm giving Smoke Daddy three stars, but it's more like 2.5. They're owned by the same folks who own Dunlay's on the Square (of which I'm a fan), so that warrants a rounding up. I think there's better barbecue to be had in the city, but it really comes down to personal preference.

Even though their BBQ Pork sandwich is 14 tickets, the most expensive item I saw at the Taste, I went right for it. I love BBQ pork and I want to love Smoke Daddy and decided to bypass the smaller 4 ticket taste portion and just go for it. I wish I hadn't been so gung-ho. It was tasty, a nice BBQ flavor with good smokiness, but sadly it was also an utter rip off. The large portion seemed barely any bigger than the taste portion and not worth the 14 tickets which equals to something over $8.00. Get the taste portion only. Save your tickets. Don't be me and want to love so hard. Even though their food tasted good, this small interaction I've had with Smoke Daddy has put a bad taste in my mouth.

It was evidently a Puerto Rican holiday or parade as there was crazy noise and busy streets all down Division from 90. Found parking a few blocks away from TSD on a side street.  We tossed around a few ideas, but we ended up ordering nachos with pulled chicken and pulled pork and a smoked chicken soup to start. I wasn't feeling that great, so I skipped ordering my entree because I was pretty satisfied by the soup and nachos. The nachos were pretty decent. The soup on the other hand was a mixture of dark and white meat pulled chicken. The black stuff that is sometimes near the bone (i believe blood) was very noticeable in my bowl of soup---kinda a turn off.  A lot of onions, and tomatoes- almost like a gumbo. The taste was great. The meat in my bowl....not my fav. My boyfriend ordered a pulled pork sandwich and fries. I didn't actually taste anything, but it looked very good and he consumed most of it. My sister got a burger with beautiful thick cut strips of bacon. I think she was a little displeased with the well-done-ness of her medium ordered burger.

2011-06-20,2.0,"One of my favorite meals to have when I come back from an extended journey (particularly of the camping/climbing variety) is BBQ Ribs. I usually go to East Bank Club for real nice rack with Sweet Baby Ray's sauce everywhere, but this go around time was short and we wanted to check out the brick and mortar location of one of Chicago's BBQ institution located down the street from our new apartment. While SD has a great patio and plenty of seats, I was really dissapointed with the sauces and flavor of our ribs. I love BBQ sauce and have tried my best to check out almost every BBQ spot in town. As I've said before, the sauce makes the meal and Smoke Daddy just didn't have that day. There are three table side bottles to choose from - original, sweet and smokey and mustard q. All are vinegar based (not my favorite) and none quite stood out with originality. I found my best flavors with combining the mustard q with the sweet/smokey. We ordered a chicken + ribs platter, with sides of mac cheese and sweet potato fries. The food came ridiculously fast (a necessity since we were heading to a bulls game) but somewhat curious. I thought the ribs were cooked ok but didn't have anything to put on them, which was needed. Erica is the mac 'n cheese expert and that didn't quite pass the test since it seemed too easy to replicate at home (and not very creamy or cheesy). To our surprise the half chicken that arrived second was cooked to perfection - tender but super moist with a crispy skin. I was full at that point but kept eating the chicken because it was the best thing we ordered. If it were allowed I would order that chicken but BYOQ (bring your own bbq sauce). We were in a rush so maybe I'm passing judgement too fast and we also didn't get to eat a lot of items on the menu. However, it doesn't take long for me to enjoy good bbq sauce and good ribs (it must be a midwestern thing). Smoke Daddy is an institution and isn't going anywhere. The fact that it's down the street from me only adds to the likely hood I'll be back at some point. But with other great bbq spots in the city (with a favorite Lillie's Q down the street), I would take a lot of convincing to go to SD for a bbq meal versus the other options.",0.9984,0.796,0.197,0.007,0.5874242424242425

There were huge sinkholes in the sidewalk on Division before 1996,  that I'm sure led to some kind of Masonic Underground Daley Payola Gold Mine. When Smoke Daddy opened, it was exciting, but also signaled the end of Dirty Division, which had its charm too. Maybe that's why I've stayed away from Smoke Daddy for so long. I resent it, in a way. A recent visit kind of slapped me out of my petty ways (a good restaurant, like a good woman, can do that for you). And I'm so thankful. Division is now a prime street for dining Al Fresco, and the Smoke Daddy has tons of outdoor real estate, seating should not be a problem. Awesome. The Pulled Pork sandwich was excellent. The server who brought out the food was super friendly, and she explained the three different hot sauces on the table.  Each was better than the next and just as good as the last! Smokey dark, red with a zing of vinegar, and a sweet mustard-based sauce were all excellent to put on a sandwich that already had a great sauce, and also to dip the sweet potato fries in.

2011-05-31,2.0,"I know plenty of people are more qualified at assessing BBQ, but I definitely have a solid baseline.  Having sampled some of the best out of KC, Memphis, Texas, and even SC, I can safely say this place is nowhere near that level.  Keeping in mind that this is Chicago and they aren't attempting to compete at that level, I would still say Smoke Daddy is sub-par.  This was a place that I SO BADLY wanted to like, but couldn't do it. Food: My fiance and I ordered the beer cheese appetizer, which I would have to say was pretty much the only highlight.  Pretty tasty soft cheese with some spice to it, but nothing spectacular. For our main course, we split a sampler (Daddy Sampler?  Can't recall the name), which offered a little of bit of something for everyone -- burnt ends, ribs, and pulled pork.  I was unimpressed by all of them, even in light of the fact that they are not competing at the national level.  I am not grading this for Memphis in May and I still think it is mediocre.  Most of the meats were over-cooked and bland -- two major sins of BBQ.  I have even had better pulled pork at many gastropubs in Chicago who don't pretend to be BBQ joints. The mac and cheese was decent, but the reviews on Yelp have over-hyped this dish.  Don't get too excited -- it wouldn't stand out at other restaurants.  2 stars. Service:  Meh. I have had better.  It was okay, but our waitress was not particularly informed on the beer selection or the specialties of the restaurant.  And, no, it was not her first day.  3 stars. Ambiance: Think of a dive BBQ joint in Memphis with an outdoor seating area of Chicago.  Bam. Smoke Daddy's.  I have heard that it's great for live music and I'll give those reviews the benefit of the doubt. 3 stars.

Also the mac n cheese and cut fries.  Fries were ok little too shoestring.  Mac and cheese was a little too watery..not a thick solid consistency like I prefer it.  The meat like everyone else has said did fall off the bone.  Very tender.  Taste was pretty good as well.  Although I was expecting the dry rub to come through a little more.  My biggest gripe was with the sauce.   I didnt like the sauce in bottles.  I have always believed that there should be only one sauce and it should complement the ribs and be served with it.  Not at room temperature with the ribs.  But I guess thats the difference between carryout and dine in rib place.  Overall I would go again if I was in the area.  I probably wouldnt make a special trip as I did today though.,0.9592,0.883,0.1,0.017,0.5379251700680272

While comforting it want wow.  So since that was my first visit I thought maybe let's give them a couple chances because it wasn't all bad.  But to my disappointment was the same every time, which I do have to say they are consistent.  Overall this place is kind of ho hum when compared to places like Lilly q which are amazing.  I would go back if some friends who really love smoke wanted to go but other than that I don't know not feeling it",0.9597,0.835,0.154,0.011,0.5256060606060606

I have to say, it was good, but I can't go so far as to say great. Or even one of the best.  I get that the place is really laid back; super causal. But when we walked in the door we didn't know what to do. No one greeted us. Do we seat ourselves? Do we wait to be seated? Where are the menus? There was no sign inviting us to seat ourselves. We hem'ed and haw'ed till we finally decided to be daring and just take our own booth. I eventually spotted the menus and grabbed two for us. As casual as a restaurant is, it's nice to get a little direction as to the modus operandi.  We both got the pulled pork sandwich. It was quite tasty, but I have had better, to be honest. There wasn't a ton of bbq sauce on the sandwich. But that's ok cause they have 3 different flavors right there at the table for you to decorate your food with. They were good, not great. The sauce wasn't as thick as I prefer. I guess I'm still a Sweet Baby Ray's kinda gal. That's more my kind of bbq sauce. Smoke Daddy's sauce was a bit more runny and just not the most amazing bbq flavor ever.

It's a shame that a Memphis in May winner like Lillie's Q (which has fantastic pulled pork and delicious sides) has the same overall rating as The Smoke Daddy. Maybe it's a service issue, 'cause the food at The Smoke Daddy didn't impress me. Last night's dinner at The Smoke Daddy allowed me to try the following: spare ribs, fries, cornbread, mac & cheese, pulled pork, sliced brisket, and various BBQ sauces. The ribs weren't tender, the pulled pork had little desirable flavor, the brisket was too fatty, the fries were overcooked and dry, and the mac & cheese was decent. The only thing that inspired a ""wow"" was the corn bread, which was a little over-greasy but otherwise packed a punch. Service was great, I can admit. In my opinion, if you want good pulled pork, you go to Lillie's, Fat Willy's, or Honky Tonk. You want good sliced brisket, you go to Smoque and don't bother with anyone else. Every BBQ joint has one or two sides they do well, so I won't even get into that... Except to say: you want good cornbread and Honky Tonk  and every diner you know is closed?

But it's weird because he will only eat food in meat and grease format and he is very particular about where he gets his plates of heart attack. He should be about 300 pounds but he is one of those guys who can eat half a cow and still remain slim and trim (BASTARD...still love him).  Anyway, I give you this side note because anyone who is this damn picky and determines that a restaurant is in his top 5, further proves how awesome this place is. He has complained about every single restaurant we've gone too (not enough meat babe, too many veggie on the menu, too soggy, too sweet, not salty enough, etc etc) but this place...nope, not a complaint yet! I say let's get something healthy and he tries to sneak Smoke Daddy in his list...umm no. But when I'm feeling some BBQ and have done about 3 hours on the elliptical in the morning, I'll be motivated to take him up on that offer.  I love their pulled pork sandwiches and baby back ribs. Their side are awesome too (I personally like the homemade BBQ chips and Mac N Cheese)  The average human being that orders the Smoke Daddy Sampler (about a slab and a half of all their cuts of rib) would share this amongst 3 - 4 other people. No No...not my hunny. He can down the entire thing by himself and have the cookie dessert.

We went down on a Friday night and, like the other reviews have mentioned, it is a small place and it does get crowded. I would say, without a reservation, we waited 30-40 minutes, which we didn't mind because the food made up for it, but being as it's a small place it's hard to find space around the bar to stand without being in anyones way.  So after sitting down I ultimately decided to go with the pulled pork sandwich... ok, I didn't ""ultimately decide"" anything, I knew exactly what I wanted before I even stepped foot in the door. My date got the same thing and the other couple we were with got a pulled brisket and pulled pork. I got the cornbread on the side and we also had mac and cheese and sweet potato fries on the table. Everything was absolutely delicious.  There were 3 choices of BBQ sauce on the table and while all of them were pretty good, one in particular was amazing (I'd tell you if I remembered the name, but it was the thicker/darker one, molasses based I believe). The pulled pork was a good sized portion although I wouldn't say it was massive as some of the other reviewers have said, but it was definitely big enough... and amazing. The cornbread was equally as good and the sweet potato fries need to be had by all. I did not try the Mac and Cheese for fear of what it may do to my insides later in the night, but I was assured that it was delicious.  The live band was setting up right behind us as we were finishing up so we didn't get a chance to check them out, but I have to imagine it gets pretty loud in there with a band considering how small it is so if that's not your thing make sure you try to go earlier.

It's fun to play with different mixtures of sweet, savory, and spice -- Smoke Daddy offers them all.

I don't know how their smoking equipment is set up, but I'd be wiling to bet it isn't based on wood alone. The fries are excellent, however, and it's always good to have a few beer options available to go along with your meal, but really...if the meat isn't up to par then that's all just in the realm of nice extras, not essentials. Finally, I can't say I'm a fan of the atmosphere. It's trying to be everything to everyone, and as a result it just feels bland. The music is ok, but loud, and the seating is decent, the walls have vaguely BBQ or blues/rock/local color-themed items on display...you get the picture.

So, i willed my way through the meal and the young lady who was serving us noticed. I began to lean, ya know, when you're so full you lean to one side...She turned the tables and gave ME a tip!

The Smoke Daddy did not disappoint.  There was a nice crowd but we got served as soon as we walked in .  Literally, the staff was finishing up wiping down what would become our booth as we walked in.  Very cool! The ambiance was very nice.  Very casual comfortable and the air was potent with tasty, smoky and delicious aromas!  I was getting pretty ""tingly"" as I was contemplating pulled pork as soon as I saw it on the menu!  Mmmm... So, I almost went with a sandwich and two sides... then I saw the nachos platter and a choice of two meats!  Mmm... Nirvana!   I stuck with my original taste for pulled pork and chose brisket for my second meat.  What a treat!  The nachos were loaded with fixings that were tasty albeit almost borderline thrifty.   Cheese, cilantro, onion, diced tomato, barbecue sauce and toasted chips echoed traditional nachos (well, minus the bbq sauce).   The meat was soooo good!  Juicy, succulent and just tasty all the way around.  My two meat choice was perfect!  It gave me more than a good idea as to what  a ""dedicated"" sandwich with either meat would taste like!  The portion was decent (although, for the price, I would have expected a little more - a quibble but not one to lower the star rating).   My side was coleslaw and it was quite tasty!  I have to say that I was looking forward to trying because I like the coleslaw at Chuck's Southern Comforts Cafe also but wondered how TSD's would measure up.  I have to say I like them both.   My friends had a rib sampler plate, I think is what it was.  It looked very tasty!  I tried the sweet potato fries that they ordered and I have to say that I was shocked that it was kind of good.  Truth be told, I hate sweet potatoes but those fries were not bad at all.  My friends really enjoyed them!   The waitress started off as someone I liked but it changed towards the end for a couple of reasons.  Her personality was great and she was very helpful when it came to answering questions and giving us great assessments of the food. The downside came when she didn't come back to ask about refills on drinks.  I mean, really?  This is a basic of good waitress and server procedure.  I swear, every time she started to look in my direction, she turned away.  Diet soda quota exceeded after one glass!  Ugh.  I know next time what to expect and I will be a stickler in that department!

Beef brisket was good as well, as was the pulled pork. Taste:: Alone the meat would be ok, with their sauce it sucked. Plain and simple it brought down the meal, although they did send 2 types of sauces, they both weren't tasty. Luckily I had some BBQ sauce from rib fest in the cupboard, that saved the day. The Mac and cheese was ok, It did remind me of GOOD hospital Mac and cheese. It was not impressive, more institutional if you know what i mean.  The bread crumbs were not too toasty, it was like they were spooned on rather than baked.  The Coleslaw. I love coleslaw, Carsons has the best, and there are many other places with good coleslaw, however the smoke daddy dropped the ball on this one, I mean come on, It's cabbage, sugar, heavy mayo, salt, etc. Who puts CILANTRO into Coleslaw? Smoke daddy does. Yuck! Overall, they have good quality BBQ food, the prices are high for this type of food, even at the quality, it was more expensive than Carsons, and no where near as good.

I will be honest, when I looked at my plate, I thought I wouldn't be able to finish it.  But I did.  The meat on the ribs fell easily off the bone.  However, the ends were slightly dry and I wish they could have been saucier.  No worries, each table has three bottles of BBQ sauces that you can add to your meat: the original, the sweet & smoky (my favorite), and mustard.   I tried some brisket & pork, but I have to say I liked my ribs more.  The sweet potato fries though, were amazing.   The flavor of the beans were pretty good but I felt like I was eating BBQ sauce soup with beans.  Too much sauce!

The ribs had an OK flavor, but the meat seemed of a lower quality and less flavorful than other ribs I've had in Chicago. The sliced brisket left a LOT to be desired.  It was dry, shaved very thin, almost like you got it from a grocery store deli. The baked beans I had as a side were OK, but had an unusual aftertaste, again not bad, but certainly not as good as the barbeque beans at smoque or some of the others.

Nice outdoor seating area, they did have live music too, which apparently they have every night.

I didn't see brisket on the menu (or missed it) but I'm hesitant to try brisket outside of Texas anyways! ;) The mac-n-cheese is meh, but the fries are delicious.

My mouth was watering just looking at the ribs photo. I'll give an A for the service. Got a table in less than 5 minutes for the party of 2 while others outside were still waiting for a table. However, I was very disappointed..with the quality of the food. The food came in less than 10 minutes after we sat down. So back to the disappointment. One, the ribs were super dry, not juicy at all. I think those ribs were left in the oven way too long. My jaws were hurting from chewing the rubbery meat. Two, I was told the pork and beans were good so we ordered that. The portion was tinier than I expected. It was in a cup, the size of a soup cup. It was okay, although it had an after taste of kerosene, but I know it was ""smoked."" The mac and cheese was a different story. It was soooo dry, I didnt even want to eat it, but for $4.00, we had to. Can't let $4 just go down the drain. The mac and cheese from Jewel was much tastier than this and more cheesy. The beer was good! Overall experience, D minus. I felt like the food was some leftover of some sort and was just served to us since we only sat down for less than 10 minutes and got our food that fast!. Fast service w/ bad quality of food!

2010-05-16,2.0,"more like The Liquid Smoke Daddy. the first whiff of my pulled-pork and beef brisket shame pile was a heady 1-second time machine to summer barbecues, cheap beer, 4th of july, etc.  by the last bite, it was like when you go up the escalator at bed, bath, and beyond and you enter the Scented Candle Zone, where you are engulfed by the cloud of aromatic hydrocarbons created by hundreds of waxen attempts to simulate smells of real things. it was disgusting, overwhelming, and artificial. as a friend pointed out, there is no smoke coming from the smoke daddy. if that weren't enough, my takeout came in a paper bag bigger than a grocery bag, though it contained only enough food to fit in a regular old lunch bag. the rest of the space was mainly accommodating the excessive containers, and containers of containers. as i recall, it involved 3 small styrofoam containers, 2 of which were INSIDE ANOTHER BIGGER STYROFOAM CONTAINER. stryrofoam itself is an environmental philistinism that ive just come to expect living in chicago, along with no recycling, excessive plastic bag pushing from grocery store cashiers, and people who don't think bicycling is a legitimate means of transport. But redundant styrofoam, that is, styrofoam containers inside of other styrofoam containers- unacceptable. unless this is chemistry class and you're making a coffee cup calorimeter, there's no excuse for this. despite all this styrofoam, my food was still not hot when i got it home all of 7 minutes later. this leads me to believe that it probably was not actually hot when it was placed in its styrofoam matryoshka doll, thereby defeating the ostensible purpose of all the packaging. the sweet potato fries are pretty good but would be better without the cinnamon, and the coleslaw was ok, so 2 stars.",0.8459,0.884,0.075,0.042,0.5446856906534326

2010-05-08,3.0,"Okay, I admit it.  I was wrong about Smoke Daddy.  In my initial review, almost a year ago, I dined outdoors in the afternoon and while I acknowledged that the food was good, I drew some conclusions about the overall appeal of the place that were unfounded.  I surmised that Smoke Daddy was past its prime, that the accolades it had received in the past for its outstanding ribs were no longer relevant and that its claims to live music seven nights a week were shaky. I recently dined at Smoke Daddy again.  This time I went on a Thursday night - one of the best nights to judge a restaurant because if a restaurant packs them in on a Thursday night it means the restaurant has strong local appeal, one of the best gauges of a restaurant's relevance.  Smoke Daddy packed them in.  Its eight tables and five booths were full, customers were two deep at the bar and there was a 30 minute wait to be seated.   In spite of this, the bartender marked us and served us within two minutes and the host got us seated with ten.  The waitress showed up instantly and we were sitting behind a steaming plate of zesty ribs within five minutes.  You couldn't ask for better service. The ribs were as I remembered them, good but nothing to write home about.  Although Smoke Daddy emulates a Memphis rib house in décor and ambiance, the food is less charmingly authentic.  The cornbread was a bit on the dry side and the ribs, while moist, weren't as distinctively flavorful as one has come to expect from the hotly competitive BBQ sector.  The one stand out was the side dish of smoke pit beans, rich and tangy, swimming with chunks of pulled pork and generously laced with Jack Daniels.  Hello Southland! Promptly at 9pm, a rockabilly trio hit the small stage by the front window of this narrow storefront, launching into an upbeat mix of western swing, boogie and rhythm and blues.  The volume was not so loud as to prohibit conversation so the music acted as a pleasant backdrop to the ongoing banter.  A group of sports fans clustered at the bar to watch the Blackhawks and all factions coexisted peacefully, no one intruding on anyone else's enjoyment of the place and its various features and ambiance.   If Smoke Daddy is old by Division Street standards, it's not past its prime.  I was wrong about that.  My return visit to Smoke Daddy revealed that, even if the food is no longer deserving of high praise, the overall appeal of the place is intact.  It might be said that Smoke Daddy's experience has taught it one of the most difficult tricks in the restaurant/bar business, how to appeal to a diverse range of customers and keep them all happy.",0.9892,0.839,0.115,0.047,0.5032962962962962

2010-04-05,3.0,"First off, you can skip to the bottom for a quicker rundown here. I've been here a couple times now and my feelings about it are a bit mixed. On the first visit my girlfriend had the smoked chicken. I've had smoked meats many times before, but never quite this smokey. We both felt this way. Probably won't order that again. I ordered the brisket sandwich which was very good. On the second visit, my girl ordered a veggie sandwich (basically just a veggie burger) which was good, but we felt like the menu could have explained that more. I had the half rack of baby back ribs. Pretty much what you'd want as far as preparation. Fall off the bone... But again a bit too smokey for my taste. The mac and cheese is what you'd expect from a bbq joint. Super cheesy, with a baked top. Only downside is that the breadcrumbs on top tasted kind of like they were progresso canned italian breadcrumbs (not necessarily bad, just unexpected). Fresh cut fries go without explanation in my book. Definitely solid. The sauces aren't bad either. They offer a mustard base sauce, a molasses base sauce, and a vinegar base sauce. I thought the vinegar base was the best of the three. As far as the layout and decor go, it's pretty cool. Good bar setup, with decent beer selection and a handful of house drinks. Even sangria, which wasn't bad and I thought it was cool that they offered it here.  Maybe a couple too many tables inside, which tend to let you get cramped if you're here when it's busy. I definitely suggest going at off peak dining times. I did think the templeton rye barrel lid in the back was a nice touch. Service here is ok. Not always totally on point, but definitely polite and happy to answer any questions you may have. The food comes pretty quick.  They have bands on a tiny stage in the front of the room. Definitely check it out if you're into blues. Overall:  - Good food, but be careful if you're not a fan of super smokey foods.  - Good beer / decent drink concoctions.  - Can get crowded, so try going for late lunch or try the patio if weather permits.",0.9969,0.728,0.213,0.059,0.6091379310344828

The sides container held my mac, cornbread  and butter and the bottom of my take out bag held two types of sauce, utensils, napkin and salt & pepper. The pork was tender, smoked and copious. I loaded up my buttered bun (not what I was expecting but VERY satisfying) with meat and I had a good amount left in the tub. I put on a couple of pickles and tried the darker, thicker, sweeter bbq sauce. Yes. Happiness is... a moment like this.. is my now. Fantastic. Carolinan, Tennessean or Texan, I couldn't tell you. Good? Very good? D@ng good? Yes. I took some butter to my cornbread and took a bite. Nice. Sweet, but substantial...peppers too. This will do nicely. The mac & cheese was the only weak link. Topped with bread crumbs, the m&c was of the softer, creamier variety and it was sort of tasteless. I ate it because it was there, not because I loved it. But, between swigs of root beer, chomps of cornbread and gulps of pulled pork, I was a pretty happy guy. For curiosity's sake, I poured some of the thinner, more vinegar-y sauce into the tub o' meat. Good, but I preferred the darker stuff. That's what she said.",0.9918,0.794,0.141,0.065,0.6569265232974911

2010-02-04,5.0,"Smoke Daddy ribs are to die for. Anyone can cook baby backs but a true rib artist tackles the more difficult spare rib. The meat is chewier and that is more fat. Where there is more fat there is more flavor. The three sauces on the table add to the complexity of flavors and textures going on in your mouth. Go with people you love because there won't be much talking and there will be sauce - everywhere! Smoke daddy is also a good value. Most meals are way under $20 and you get one side with a sandwich or two sides with ribs. It's more than enough food and you can take some home for later. My favorite sides are the mac and cheese, sweet potato fries and the beans. The beans have meat in them so how can you go wrong? I enjoy 1/2 price burger night too (Thursdays.) Another huge value and your tummy is way satisfied. It's an awesome place to go to in the summer since they have outdoor sidewalk seating.

I arrived with my girlfriend at about 6pm on a Saturday night and we waited about 20 minutes to be seated.  By about 6:30 the place was pretty packed, especially by the bar.  Decent draft beer selections, although I would have preferred a larger draft selection or more varieties in the bottle selection (ie: more IPA beers which go well with BBQ). We were seated at a nice booth table which was admittedly larger than we really needed.  Service was really great: waitresses were very hospitable and we were served very quickly after ordering.  The menu is designed for quick service, which is nice when there is a hungry and slightly drunk crowd waiting to be served.   I ordered a half slab of baby-back ribs and my girlfriend had pork and beef brisket (smoked meat).  The ribs were warm and with meat falling off the bone when they arrived at my table.  Unfortunately the meat lacked the succulent taste I remembered fondly from my first trip - the meat was a bit dry on the outside.  My girlfriends brisket was decent, but like my ribs, the flavor of the meat(s) were completely masked in BBQ sauce.  So after about half way through our dishes we proceeded to try our sides: sweet potato fries, baked beans, coleslaw, and mac+cheese.  Sweet potato fries and coleslaw were winners, perhaps even better tasting than our mains. In short if you arrive at this place early on a weekend and enjoy your food smothered in BBQ sauce you'll have a great meal.  Personally, I'd rather go back to Smoque, but plan to give Smoke Daddy another try.",0.9899,0.837,0.141,0.022,0.5411764705882354

The music they played was great, and they had plenty of good beers on tap. Now about the food! The baby-back ribs were by no means the best I've ever had but they were no doubt solid, with a nice smoky flavor and a tender texture that can be enjoyed without gobs of sauce. The coleslaw was amazing, one of the best and most unique coleslaws I have ever tasted; it was more like a salad than a traditional coleslaw, almost worth going for the slaw alone! The sweet potato fries were delicious as well, and this is coming from someone who doesn't even like traditionally prepared sweet potatoes.

As a bar this place is alright.  There aren't really any good drink specials and the live music gets really loud since the place is so small.  Definitely worth checking out for some hungover-barbeque-awesomeness.",0.9685,0.8,0.188,0.012,0.5384615384615385
2009-11-29,4.0,"I should call this review ""How I didn't eat at Perry's Deli or Smoque on my wild goose chase for a brisket sandwich."" All I can say is Smoke Daddy has an incredible brisket sandwich. Thick, tender slices of beef (maybe 6 oz. or so,) on an average-sized bun, with just a splash of BBQ sauce, not at all messy, sliced pickles, and accompanied by nice thin. crispy, shoestring-style fries. It was the perfect size portion to alleviate my craving. I washed it down with a Metropolitan Copper Lager. I'll spare you the detailed flavor-pairing analysis. I love the ambience here and the fact that there is booze and table service. That was the reason Smoque got knocked out. The ambiance is like a nicely worn old shoe. On my Sunday afternoon visit, the holiday lights were up. The feeling was cozy, albeit quiet. There were just a handful of customers there. The server was great. Very genuine and un-obsequious. I also loved the old vinyl booths, the lighted diner clock on the back wall and the teensy New York City wash basin in the men's john. Finally, I like BBQ places who A) give you a choice of sauces (there were 3 on the table), and B) let you determine how much to put on. Smoke Daddy is just alright by me! And the brisket sandwich a destination dish. Oh, and P.S.: Perry's was closed Sunday. I went there first.

We had the brisket also, which was fine. As far as sides go, neither their slaw nor their green beans were fantastic. Did love the mac and cheese, though, and the sweet potato fries weren't bad either. What I really disliked about The Smoke Daddy was the sauces they offered - ostensibly three distinct sauces, they were all generic and a bit too sweet. Their 'sweet' sauce was cloyingly sweet, and the mustard and vinegar based sauces were also lacking in bite.

2009-09-30,4.0,"BBQ? OM NOM NOM NOM I love BBQ. It is one of my favorite things in the world. Actually, meat is, but you get the picture. I am a meat loving girl and I love BBQ meat a lot as well. So. Here we were, Saturday afternoon. My boyfriend and I wanted food and I suggested Smoke Daddy. He agreed because I have been talking about wanting to go there for the past month and we haven't (I live right down the street).  So off we went. When I got there, I knew I wanted to try everything. But how was that going to be possible? And, would my boyfriend try something adventurous so that I can try everything on the menu? The answer to the latter was no. My boyfriend got the burger, Daddy Style, which I guess involved some jalepenos, onions, bbq sauce and he added blue cheese. He said it was good. Can I attest to that? No. I couldn't try it because I got THE BIG DADDY which involved me ordering a choice of ribs and two kinds of meat. So I got the baby back ribs, brisket and the pulled pork. I also got to choose two sides, so I got macaroni and cheese and the veggie of the day, collard greens. I know you're asking yourself: how can this tiny girl eat all of this? I can say that I have a stomach of steeeeeeeeeeeel. And that I almost ate all of it. The ribs were tender, so much so that I could pull the meat off of the bone and feed it to my boyfriend (what, we didn't do that!) The brisket and pulled pork were also tender and well seasoned. Especially the brisket, which still had the fat on it. I appreciated this A LOT, as any meat aficionado would know adds delicious flavor to the meat. It was very good. The pulled pork had enough bbq sauce, I always want a little more, but there was enough. The fact that there are three types of bbq sauce on the table is a huge plus, as you can choose. I used all three on all of my meats. The macaroni and cheese was very cheesy; it wasn't the best I've ever had, but my mother doesn't work at Smoke Daddy, so I wasn't surprised. The collards were sour and garlicky, but very delicious. Of all that I ate, what was left for me to take home were three baby back ribs, two pieces of brisket, some mac and cheese and a few collards. And the leftovers the next day, while not enough food, were delicious! In fact, the brisket was even better, which who would've thunk? I would go to Smoke Daddy again, over and over. Perhaps I won't get that much meat next time, and I'm REALLY very curious about the chicken, so maybe that will be on my next visit to stuff my face.",0.9958,0.843,0.133,0.024,0.48454673721340386

After walking my dog by the delicious smell day after day (which would often cause an unconscious Pavlovian response by both me, and my dog) - I decided it was time to give it a try.   The food was absolutely phenomenal - we started out with Pulled Pork Nachos (drooling once again just thinking about them), then split the Baby Back Ribs and some mac & cheese.  The pulled pork in the nachos was extremely smoky tasting (which I love) and the ribs were perfect.  Not to mention I loved having the option of many different sauce varieties (I'm the person that orders BBQ sauce as a salad dressing in restaurants, and slathers it on more food groups than most humans I'm sure).  Finally - the mac & cheese topped it all of nicely...creamy deliciousness.   As for the service - our waitress was polite and friendly...and we ended up having a casual conversation with the manager about the neighborhood.  While I know Chicago has a selection of really great BBQ places and people tend to have varying tastes as far as how they prefer it to be prepared - I would feel comfortable recommending Smoke Daddy to any BBQ connoisseur.",0.9857,0.855,0.138,0.007,0.7127525252525253
2009-09-24,4.0,"We went down to the Renegade craft fair last week, and wanted to tell you quickly about this place called Smoke Daddy on Division between Damon and Ashland. All we have to say about this place is: ""damn good"". Lois got the pulled pork sandwich, which came with a whopping plate of fries, and I jumped on the appetizer menu when I saw something called the pulled meat nachos. Let's start with the pulled pork sandwich. Now Lois has eaten many, many pulled pork sandwiches in her day and this one ranks in about the 75 or 80th percentile -- good flavor, lots of tender meat, not drowning in sauce, and a bun firm enough to absorb the excess BBQ sauce without falling apart (very important). The handcut fries (just one of several side options) were delicious -- thin and crispy with a nice seasoning.  The sandwich and fries by themselves were more than enough food so Lois was ultimately happy she didn't order that side of cornbread; it looked amazing, though - a table across the way was furiously feasting on several slices. Pulled meat nachos. It's exactly what it says - but giant. This could have easily served four people as an appetizer but worked fine for one person as an entree. Think nachos, with a lot of cilantro, tomatoes, onions, topped with taco bell flavored mild sauce... now imagine under that top layer of nachos, is a layer of pulled pork, more nachos, and under that a handful of slow cooked baked beans with more pulled pork. It was awesome, but don't make the same mistake I did. Order it as an appetizer with three to four people, not as lunch for one. We dropped about $25 at this place. Was it worth it? We're writing about it, aren't we? Go if you're in the area but I don't know if it's worthy of a planned trip.",0.9654,0.884,0.095,0.021,0.5701178451178451

Pro:  We all loved the creamy and crisp cole slaw, the sweet potato fries (we almost ordered extra helpings), and Tennessee sweet tea.  Two of my dates raved over their chicken wings.  The third date and I split a rib sampler.  Holy mother!  Too much food.  We all loved the baby backs, but all of us were slightly less enthused by the  rib tips and spare ribs.  Great idea for 3 BBQ sauces.  Con: The much needed wet wipes were nowhere in sight.  While there were paper napkins presented along with the BBQ sauces at the side of our table, our grubby hands and sticky, smeared faces needed a little extra help.  Pro/Con:  Our host and first server (a guy) deserves a five star rave.  He was friendly, engaged, and provided great recommendations.  Halfway through our meal, a chick replaced him.  Woman looked like she couldn't get rid of us fast enough. We were hustled in and out in under an hour after her repeated ""Are you done now?"" and ""You don't want any more drinks?  Fine!  Here's your bill"" as she slapped the check down.

2009-08-02,1.0,"Gee, I guess something is obviously wrong with me...how could I not like this? My husband and his dad were on their way back from the Sox game and their first choice restaurant was closed on Sunday, so hubs calls me to find a substitute restaurant.  I immediately logged on to Yelp, saw the glowing reviews and placed an order for pick up.  We had baby backs, smoked chicken, brisket, pulled chicken, corn bread, the pit beans and cole slaw. I'm really not picky, especially when I haven't eaten since breakfast but to quote Muffy Crosswire from the PBS kids show Arthur, this shit was ""vomitrocious"". I have never had anything so nasty in my life. If I'm going to suffer some true Jewish guilt and eat pork, I want to actually taste it.  I want that sweet, succulent, sublime porkiness sliding down my throat, I want to moan with every mouthful.  A spicy rub would be nice if it weren't so overpoweringly full of burnt chili overtones, not to mention way too much smoke. I can't belive that smokiness came from actual woodsmoke...tasted more like it came out of a bottle to me. The pit bbq beans were mostly a soupy concoction of meat chunks and watery bbq sauce and very few beans. Ugh! My husband thought the smoked chicken was ok, my daughter ended up eating only sweet potato fries (this is the kid who eats anything), the brisket was alright-at least I was able to taste the beef. The pulled chicken was below average. The cornbread was soaked in butter. I've never turned down butter but then I never had to squeeze out my cornbread before eating it. I'm sure I'll feel it tomorrow morning when the explosive diarrhea hits. The best part of the meal was the cole slaw, I actually liked it! The dressing was a little spicy and the cilantro was refreshing. Other than that, this was a waste of $80. I came oh so close to throwing out the remaining slab but I figured I'd try to feed it to the cats first.  Never again, so help me.",0.8676,0.788,0.118,0.093,0.5315833333333333

I ordered the spare ribs and 1/4 chicken combo with fries and baked beans. Each combo comes with your choice of two sides - choices range from coleslaw, cornbread, and mac & cheese. I learned from the kind take out lady at the restaurant that the difference between spare ribs and baby back ribs are that spare ribs are fattier, thicker, and juicer than baby back ribs and are separate... hence the name spare.

The sweet potato fries were like a treat in themselves. I would definitely recommend ordering them next time!  Okay.... one major thing though - the portions are HUGE! I would recommend ordering one thing and splitting it. My man and I have big decent appetites and we hardly made a dent in our meals. The side dishes alone could be meals themselves.  Also, our bill came out to be 37$ which was much more than we had originally planned on spending on take out on a Monday night (granted, we did order dessert which made our meal a little pricier).  My recommendation (for two people at least) is to order only one dish with the two complimentary sides, one being the sweet potato fries.... so good! It will be enough to fill you up!

Yeah, the fries were greasy and had a weird dark color to them like they didn't use clean oil, but they were good.. Not the best and could of been just as tastier healthier, but I don't think you go to a bbq joint thinking health you know?  The gf got a full-slab of ribs as it was only two dollars more than the half-slab.. something about getting the value for Asians.. lol.. I got the smoked meat platter..  So the ribs were good.. at least gf said they were.. honestly I wasn't sure what I should be looking for, but they were tasty and were tender.. I didn't really like the original bbq sauce as much as the mustard one and the sweet and smoky one.. The pulled pork was also pretty good, but this one I wasn't too impressed with.. It could be that I just don't like pulled pork sandwiches, but it just felt a little dry despite the sauce on it.. I ended up only eating a piece of the brisket and it felt a little dry too..  Could of been a bad night so definitely will have to try again as it was good, but I felt a little let down after being excited about going here..",0.9921,0.758,0.195,0.047,0.6205387205387206

The new guys have changed the recipe and to be honest with you, I really dig it. The current sauce is a little on the thick side but nothing crazy.  The meat is delicious and tender and it really holds up to the sauce.  Is it as good as the old SD?  Its just as good, just different.  I can accept a change in the line up.  Excellent sides too, especially slaw but I do not dig on the sweet potato fries.  They look a little creepy to me.  They taste okay but I don't love them!  And I really wanted corn on the cob but they didn't have any!   Great little spot for dining in or to go.  Yep, I dig the Daddy!",0.9938,0.704,0.264,0.031,0.5465404040404039

The pulled pork was a lot better then the pulled brisket but the sandwich just didn't seem right without the coleslaw on there. The meat was moist but the sauce just wasn't great.

Well its a veggie burger. So you know, the norm. BUT they serve it with barbecue sauce and coleslaw on top. OMG I never thought of barbecue sauce on a veggie burger, but it is such a natural idea. This burger changed my life. I suggest adding cheddar or pepperjack cheese, and call it a day. And... since I'm eating a meal that consists of subbing things for the norm, get the sweet potato fries!! OMG! They are really thin cut and crispy, which is pretty hard to find.

And sometimes if I'm feeling really hungry, or just can't decide, I get the coleslaw too. Their coleslaw is not traditional. I'm ok with that because I'm not a fan of the gloppy mayonnaise-y stuff. This coleslaw is light and fresh, and has cilantro. So if you hate cilantro be warned, but if not indulge. Also, the cornbread is dense and cakey, with some green chilis mixed in. OMG foodgasm!

The portions were big enough to eat for two meals and there was beer. It was swell.  Fast forward half a decade or so and the prices seem to have doubled (seriously, though, they seem higher even when adjusting for inflation, but maybe I'm crazy), the portions halved and the sides (the main dishes are still as good as I remember them ever being) have been neglected like a Darfur orphanage. Shame, that.

The ribs were so soft I picked it up so I could cut it but they just came apart in my hands. The brisket was chopped but still had the juiciness of a sliced brisket and was covered in sauce and the pulled pork was good, really really good. My friend that accompanied me preferred the brisket and pork here liking the flavor of the meat and the sauce. (see Smoque entry) The vinegar based sauce was the favorite of the night and the mac and cheese served in the little crock was also excellent-again better than the other place we went too.

Smoke daddy would be my choice both food and ambiance wise. *update* came here again last night just to drink and it has, in my opinion maintained it's 5-star rating.

Secondly, while the live music is awesome and most of the time very good indeed... the crowd noise can be disruptive to your ability to enjoy the music.

Sandwiches come with a choice of one side (each one I've tried has been almost as good as the sandwich itself...their coleslaw has cilantro in it and taste amazing). If you're a real glutton, their rib platters look big enough to feed the population of Monaco.   One star deduction for frenzied service.

You know that guy, but that guy is usually just one guy. Yesterday 3/6 people were that guy. The girls looked a bit uncomfortable, but still, they're friends with or in relationships with these guys.

Friday's offers $2 Lonestar beers.  There couldn't be a more perfect compliment to Texas BBQ. I had the beef brisket sandwich with the jalapeno cornbread.  The beef was moist, which is the most important part.  Sometimes when you get BBQ, the beef can be dried out because it's been in the smoker too long.  Thankfully this was not the case.   My favorite aspect about BBQ is the messy factor.  The best way to be messy is smothering your sandwich in delicious BBQ sauce.  Smoke Daddy's offer three types.  One is the very traditional, widely available style BBQ - K.C. Masterpiece-esque, the other a bit of mustard spice, and the last was a thinner Texas sauce.  The best is the combination of the Texan with the Mustard.",0.9667,0.744,0.178,0.078,0.516931216931217
2006-12-21,3.0,"This place used to be great, before it changed ownership last year (can't that be said for most of Bucktown/WP??).  Recent visits have seen higher prices, lower portions and below average food quality in terms of barbecue.  The sauces also changed, with one offering (the ""sweet"" one) tasting just like something from the grocery.  Overall food quality is still good, but I would not go out of my way to eat here, and because it is out of my way I probably won't be back for awhile.  It's sad because I love the atmosphere and used to take out of towners here regularly.  Oh well, there are plenty of other great barbecue offerings in the city, although none has the roadhouse feel of the Smokedaddy--and the live music! If you do come here, go for the spare ribs, the sweet potato fries, the mac and cheese, and the rather untraditional collard greens, all standouts.  The pulled pork is average and lacks the smokey flavor it should have.   If you are thinking of eating here, go for the atmosphere primarily and know that there is better 'cue nearby (e.g. Honey 1, Fat Willy's).",0.9753,0.838,0.135,0.027,0.45342948717948717

The sweet potato fries are the best side in my opinion, but the mac n' cheese, cornbread, and beans are all great too.  The availability of Lone Star beer is a nice touch.

When you pair the sweet potato fries (delicious) with the cornbread (not the overly-sweet cake variety, more like the kind that has a bit of jalapeno in it to give it a little kick) and any of the meat combinations (I've had good experiences with the chicken, pulled pork and beef brisket as well as the baby back ribs) - I honestly think you're in for a treat. Even my boyfriend, notoriously not a fan of barbecue, rather enjoyed the food there. And the mustard-barbecue sauce (the light yellow-y one) is DELICIOUS. And you can get the sauces TO GO! Mmm. If you're not sure which sauces are which your server will gladly explain the differences to you. Not to mention they've done an excellent job with service - once they accidentally threw out my leftover ribs when I had asked for them to be packed (it was rather loud that night) and instead of saying ""too bad"" they made me an entire fresh half-slab of ribs to take home. Nice save! The live entertainment there is also rather enjoyable and can add to the evening if you're looking for a good show with your delicious food - if you're looking for a quiet meal those nights, though, I'd reccomend either eating outside or staying away - it can get pretty darn loud in there.

Everything sounded so good on the menu; I was this little kid, high anticipation was killing me, bring me some meat!   Most of us shared big combo meals, rib samples, and two sides, corn bread and sweet potato fries. Yummy. I didn't like the corn bread because it was spicy with jalapeno and real little corn inside :( but sweet potato fries... it was good, I ate the whole thing. RIBS.  Oh wow. GOOD! I wasn't going to be shy making a mess.  I'm usually good with manners in front of people I have never met but not tonight, I want to eat, BBQ sauce all over my face, hands, whatever, not cared.

I didn't care, Ribs were so good.  I went to restroom after to clean my hands and face. I believe there were two kinds of meat, beef and pork.  One didn't have much meat on it while the other one was real soft to chew and tasted better.  After 3-4 pieces, yea I was greedy, I ate more, and I was full.  I was done.

2005-09-16,3.0,"Another Wicker Park/Change in Ownership bitching review. Smoke Daddy certainly used to seem like a place I wanted to go eat. Authentic Texarkana style barbeque on the north side of chicago...what a treat. Like a goddamned barbequed orgasm. That you could eat. But over these past 12 months, every time I've been to smoke daddy has been less and less satisfying. The last time I went, I found it to be HIGHLY disappointing. Yes, the meat was juicy and tender. Yes, the sauce was smoky and sweet. But without the sauce, the meat was bland and flavorless, and the sauce just smothered that flaw. I used to want to just eat the sandwiches plain; they used a certain blend of rub and meat tenderizer on the meat that was absolutely delectable. Now...now I feel like I'm eating a BK pulled pork sandwich. Ugh. It's not bad, but it's like so many other places in the neighborhood; no character, no face, no vibrance. I love it when a restaurant pleases me by giving me things that I want, but I like it more when the make bold choices. Obviously, I prefer the bold choices that I agree with, but you never know when something's going to surprise you. And even if you absolutely HATE it, you can understand why it is the way it is. I guess I understand the direction Smoke Daddy's moving towards; Sauce-on-Meat no thrills.
