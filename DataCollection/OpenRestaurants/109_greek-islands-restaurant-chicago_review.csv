2017-09-01,4.0,"Pro tip: Don't go to greek island during greek fest if you don't want to wait in line.  I did not follow this tip and the wait was long. It was worth it though! Pro tip #2: free valet parking= lots of people waiting for their cars at the end of the night, if you have a big party send someone out when the bill comes so you don't all have to wait for the valets This was my second trip to greek island and I am sure I will keep coming back because they deliver every time. We started with bread and olive oil. They have some delicious fresh olive oil on the tables and that plus bread could be a meal in and of itself. Thankfully you can get even more! Next up was the saganacki. Sadly our watiress flamed our cheese when we weren't looking. We still caught the end of the flame but half the fun of the appetizer is seeing it burn. The other half is the taste though and who doesn't love hot melted cheese?! I had an orzo, lamb, tomato sauce dish (it was a special), my wife had musacka, and we also split the grilled octopus appetizer. All the food was fresh out of the oven, well cooked, and in generous portions. I loved every bite.  Can't wait for our next trip to greek town!",0.9763,0.835,0.135,0.03,0.36610195360195363
2017-08-31,3.0,"It was my first experience in this place. I wouldn't  call that a restaurant more as a dining place. Greek Island is very crowded what means it's also popular. Even with reservation you need to wait for your table. In our case it was 20 minutes. Valet parking is free what is for sure a plus. There is a lot of rooms. Service is usually on time but there are giving you more space so you need to take care about menu by yourself, also cleaning and taking care about the space could better. I'm not a huge fan of Greek food but was good and the meals pretty big. As i saw the choice of wine was fine. The place was full what means is famous and the prices are very adorable what makes this place good ideas for families with kids. There is no dress code what makes the place comfortable for everyone.

The service the first time was very nice, but we got checked on so often it almost felt they were rushing us. The second time we went was yesterday during Greek Fest on Saturday around 2 pm. We were getting a tad tired of the noise and crowds so we opted to find a sit-in restaurant . We started off with coffee, the large tzatziki dip, and the complimentary bread and butter. My friend and I split a combo meal- she got the chicken with white meat and I got the roast pork, it was about $8 per entree and you had to pick two to get this deal. The dish was a good portion for the price and had a Greek baked potato next to it. Service was again impeccable and this time we didn't feel rushed.

I brought a group of out-of-town friends here on a Saturday night.  There were 8 of us, so we needed reservations, which they were happy to do up until 5:30 PM (after which time, at least on weekends, they do not do reservations).  So, we had a 5:30 dinner.  Which was really not a problem after spending all day wandering the city. We had a really lovely experience.  The saganaki was of course a huge hit and they were very tolerant of my friend who wanted to keep taking pictures and video every time they lit the cheese on fire in the room, since she wasn't prepared when they did ours.  Some of our party are picky eaters and everyone was able to get their food prepared to their satisfaction.  Because of this, we didn't do family style, which may have made it a little more expensive, but everyone was really happy with their food.  I had a combination plate with gyros and spanikopita and definitely had enough food for at least 2 meals.   Fun place to go with a group and maybe it won't take me 8 years to return!",0.9826,0.809,0.158,0.033,0.5845833333333333

2017-07-15,5.0,"As I sat by the window, I latched onto the hope that somehow the graffiti-coated walls and high-rises would transform into the mountains and cliffs that you would actually find on one of the Greek Islands, but my wish did not come true.  Despite this, I found hope in the fact that if the food on Santorini or Mykonos was as good as it was here then I would undoubtedly enjoy myself in Greece.  I'm sure that anything you'd have in the country of Greece would be amazing, but the food here at Greek Islands at least gives you a glimpse into the type of cultural experience you'd be getting overseas.   Part of the reason that I absolutely love Greek food is because of how fresh it all is - even when it is rich, it is still fresh.  I felt that to be even more true here at Greek Island Restaurant.  Everything looked vibrant, smelled amazing and had a light texture to it...because of this I was able to eat more (and hence, experience more that the restaurant had to offer) without feeling like I had consumed double the amount.  Because my fiancé and I did want to get a more holistic taste of their offerings, we opted for several appetizers/small plates including: the saganaki (Opa!!!), kefta meatballs, melitzanosalata (eggplant-based spread), shrimp tourkolimano, the gyro appetizer and the rice pudding!  When everything was brought out to our table, it looked like we were holding a feast to feed 10 people, not 2 people.   I didn't have the biggest appetite on the day that I came to Greek Islands Restaurant, but I committed myself to eating every last bite possible.  I probably ate more than I should have, but wasting any of this food would have been a pure tragedy.  Everything mentioned above was delicious - I couldn't possibly choose a favorite...besides that, mixing all the food and sauces together makes something that is good into something that is great.  Order the eggplant-based spread with the gyros and you'll be delighted with the result of eating them together; it's scrumptious!  But then again, everything was scrumptious...and fairly priced as well.  We got all of that plus an ice tea and a beer for something like $50 - it may have even been less than that.  That's a fantastic deal for how much food you're getting! The service was also great - as soon as we vacuumed up all the food on our plates the server was there to take the plate away.  As soon as my ice tea dipped below half a glass, the server was there to fill it back up.  It was very attentive, modest and polite service.  I definitely entered and left Greek Islands Restaurant feeling well-taken care of.  I also felt super comfortable in the restaurant - it had a clean, refreshing atmosphere with wonderful decorations lining the walls.  You may not realize it from the street, but this place is spacious!  It definitely can accommodate a lot of people at any given time, which is good because there were plenty of people here even during the middle of a week day.   It can be hard to choose which place to go to on this row of Greek restaurants; all the restaurants are flaunting their wonderful Greek pride, but I would say that the safest bet (and best bet) would be to come to Greek Islands Restaurant.  I've never been to a place quite like it, and seeing as how I'll be somewhat in the vicinity for school I can see myself coming back here when in the mood for some good Greek tapas.",0.9991,0.744,0.212,0.044,0.4627694859038143

2017-06-05,3.0,"To be clear, this is a review of the Greek Islands in Greektown, on Halsted. I have been here perhaps 30 times in my 41 years of life in Chicago. I have never reviewed it before because the business received so many 5 star reviews that another one would seem like overkill. However, the last couple times I have gone the food was still excellent but the service has really taken a nosedive. I wish there was a way to separate the ""food"" from the service, but since the food was 5 star and the service was 1 star, here is a resulting 3 star rating. We arrived for dinner well after their rush period last weekend and were seated immediately. The male host couldn't manage the words ""good evening"" or anything remotely friendly to my party (myself, wife and daughter) and grabbed three menus and stormed off toward one of the dining rooms. We assumed that we were to follow him, although he couldn't say as much.  Once seated the waiter ""Mike"" (as printed on the receipt, I believe the label on his button said ""Mika"") was ignorant from start to finish. I'm sure he was disappointed that we didn't order alcohol, but I had done enough drinking earlier and it was a hot summer night - we only wanted water. He pushed the saganaki about 5 times and spoke to us like perhaps we didn't speak English, saying ""you know, oopa, cheese, fire, oopa, fire"". I'm sorry, no matter how many times he felt the need to say it, we were well familiar with what saganaki is and don't like it and weren't going to order it no matter how many ways he said it. That seemed to really aggravate him. My wife only wanted a bowl of soup and dolmades, and I had the combination plate as I usually do. My daughter ordered the cabbage salad, but was surprised when it came out like a big bowl of shredded cabbage cole-slaw. I didn't fault the restaurant for this at all; I'm not sure what else she expected when it said ""cabbage salad"". But Mike never came to check on us, and she wanted to order a different salad. We had no desire to have the cabbage salad  taken off the bill; we ordered it, after all. The issue was that the waiter NEVER came to check on us. So first I went to the host stand to get a menu so that she could pick out something else. Then I had the waiter's assistant, who was attentive except with the water glasses which sat empty for some time, find the waiter. We ordered her a second dinner, and the stand-offish attitude of the waiter was almost too much to take. I don't have any other way to describe it other than he talked to us in a condescending tone and as if we were beneath him - like it was a real bother to wait tables. This ""I'm better than you"" air about them would be enough to make most men ask if he felt the need to discuss whatever his issues were outside. If it was that he wasn't going to make the tip he desired on a bill that didn't include alcohol, appetizers, and desert, then maybe he has an unrealistic view of waiting tables. Some nights I'm not that hungry, it's 86 degrees and I just want to drink water, and it would be nice to still be treated with some semblance of respect. A modicum of decency. But that would be too much with some of the staff at Greek Islands. I must have it all wrong; I guess in the service industry I am supposed to not bother them. But you see, he is WAITING TABLES. Not the CEO of a corporation. And I still believe that Steve Jobs, on his worst day, would have been more tolerable than ""Mike"". Mike was either duped as to what being a server entails, or feels that it doesn't apply to him. After all, he's Greek and I'm not. At least that's the attitude I got. Fine. Hey Greek, I hope you enjoyed the $4 tip. You didn't even deserve that. The free valet is the one plus of this restaurant. The food was brought out so fast it was obvious that it wasn't fresh and had been stored under a heat lamp; the meat was cold in the middle. I will just pay for parking and eat at one of the other great Greektown restaurants next time.",0.9883,0.821,0.113,0.066,0.4794091710758377

Since then we have been craving real Greek salads (you know cause they put a brick of feta on top) and moussaka (a type of eggplant casserole). Did this place ever satisfy that craving!!! First off, you walk in and are greeted by clearly authentically Greek people. They are speaking Greek to each other, and treating you in their kind, gruff manner. We ordered the Athenian salad, fried eggplant, chicken kabobs, grilled octopus, and tzatziki. All of it tasted so wonderfully, authentically Greek I can't even describe it.

Now for starters it's not a meal at a Greek restaurant you don't kick it off with Saganaki. The cheese was absolutely perfect. I do wish they lit the cheese in front of us strictly for experience purposes but maybe they didn't do it because we were sitting outside. It still tasted the same and, as previously stated, it was absolutely perfect. I ordered a 1/4 chicken with vegetables. I'm not sure what the actual dish was called but it was just a simple dish flavored with herbs and oils then baked. There were no frills to this entree but I still loved it and would totally get it again. Sometimes less is more, and this was one of those times. The service was a little too slow for my liking and it definitely crossed the fine line between ""this is a dining experience"" and ""the service is way too slow for a Saturday at 1:30pm."" I know chicken takes a while to prepare but even the cheese took a while to make it to the table. Although the service caused me to dock a star from my review, I would still totally come back to this restaurant and recommend it to anyone who wants an awesome Greek Town meal!",0.9883,0.816,0.163,0.021,0.5090844671201814

2017-05-19,4.0,"I'm 100% Greek and if I'm not cooking the food I generally avoid Greek Food because it almost always fails.  But not here, the food is FABULOUS and authentic.  Once you walked through those doors, you are no longer in Chicago, but in Greece somewhere having a fresh, mouth watering meal. There were four of us for dinner.  We decided to do it Greek style and order a lot of appetizers and then 2 mains to share.  We had the grilled octopus, the loukaniko (sausage), the zucchini, and the kontosouvli.  First of all they were ALL excellent, I would order each and everyone one of them again.  The kontosouvli is small chunks of pork served with slightly grilled onions and tomato.  In Greece, this is quite often what our pita sandwiches are made of, we don't have macerated ""gyros"" in Greece, it looks more like this dish.  It was SO GOOD.  They gave us skordalia and tsatsiki sauces to eat with our apps and they were equally delicious.  We all LOVED LOVED the octopus, it was so fresh and tender and just plain good. For our mains we had the whole Lavraki (sea bass) and kokkinisto (braised beef in a tomato sauce), we had potatoes with both dishes.  Everything was perfect.  The sea bass was delicate and not covered in sauce so you tasted the fresh fish in every bite.  The beef was fall off the bone tender and the sauce again delicate so it didn't over power the flavor of the meet.  The potatoes were tender and very tasty. This really was a great meal, enjoyed by 2 couples.  The staff were fun and playful, and we just had an amazing evening.  We ordered ouzo with our meal (mostly since we did appetizers) and I highly recommend if you are having ouzo to ask for Barbayianni ouzo, its one of the best and they serve it here. I didn't give them 5 stars for one reason, our waiter left mid meal and said nothing to us.  It took us 15-20 mins before we realized he was no longer in the restaurant and we had to flag down our own new waiter.. LMAO  Not cool in the US, but it is so Greek that I felt even more at home. Definitely a must go to restaurant whenever we are in Chicago.  Hoping to get one more visit before we leave.",0.9987,0.743,0.229,0.029,0.5125654723527062

I can't say enough good things about this place: it's authentic, the service is impeccable and friendly, and the food-- oh, the food. It's all delicious, incredibly generous portions, and  phenomenal prices. To start, you get a bread basket. It's average, but what's special is the olive oil on the table. It's specially imported from Greece, and it is phenomenal: light olive flavor with a velvety mouthfeel. We bought a bottle of it on the way out, it was so good! ($10 for a 750 ml bottle, good deal in my book.) Our table of four had the saganaki, lamb gyros, leg of lamb, shrimp, and moussaka. Everything was unbelievably good. The saganaki presentation was especially memorable, as it came out on a sizzling platter. Our waiter then set it on fire in front of us and shouted ""Opa!!"" So fun! We also shared a bottle of wine, the Maleatis cabernet. It was flavorful, rich and smooth, and tasted much more expensive than it cost (which was $25!!).  We ended the night with dessert, the mediterrano: if an eclair and tiramisu had a baby, this is what it would taste like. Wonderfully creamy and fluffy and light. Heavenly. It was a wonderful dinner, and our whole party thoroughly enjoyed it. Thank you to Kostas, our server, for being so cheerful and welcoming.

2017-03-01,5.0,I have been coming to this restaurant for years. Having been to a lot of Greek restaurants all over the country I have to say that Greek Islands in Chicago tops the list.  From the moment you walk in you are greeted by friendly people.  They have a few rooms you can sit and they all will remind you of a taverna in Greece. Most of the wait staff come from Greece and of course they speak the language.  On to the food. I have had almost everything on the menu and I can truly say I have yet to have a bad meal here.  A lot of times we order a bunch of appetizers and combo dishes so we can try different things.  The cold sampler is really good with three different spreads. The tirokafteri spread steals the show.  The grilled octopus is really good as well as the Lima beans. Their gyro appetizer is always a favorite one. It tastes a lot better that any other gyro you had anywhere else.  A lot of fish choices and of course plenty of lamb dishes.  We usually get the lamb chops. They are enormous and to die for If you have any room left try some Greek desserts. One of my favorites is the bougatsa. If your date order some Greek coffee with no sugar(Sketo) Do yourself a favor and go to Greek Islands restaurant.  Best Greek restaurant outside of Greece.,0.968,0.812,0.139,0.05,0.37137681159420294

I loved the combination plate, it comes with roasted leg of lamb, mousaka, dolmades, meatball and briami.

We didn't reserve but still got a table within about 25 minutes. Waiters were enthusiastic and attentive and made sure we were comfortable.  As a full group we ordered the cold feta plate, hummus and tzaziki dips, the saganaki cheese, grilled octopus and calamari, fried calamari, and dolmades as starters. All of which were terrific. The flaming saganaki and grilled octopus being the standouts.  Entrees were nothing short of delectable as well. Moussaka, Lamb Riblets, Gyro Plate, and the Chicken Raganati were split between myself and a few others. Each as good as the next, but the Chicken was especially difficult to keep away from after getting full. It is definitely a place I'll be returning to upon future visits to Chicago.

I went with the combination plate recommended by our server. This play was crammed with moussaka, Greek meatballs, roasted lamb, dolmades, and vegetables.

2017-01-08,4.0,"Continuing our ethnic dining tour this week, we chose Greek cuisine and were not disappointed with Greek Islands.  We wandered in around 6pm (early-ish, right?) and the place was PACKED-- a large group freezing outside, and many people lining the walls inside.  I immediately regretted not getting a reservation (if they even take them...).  I warily approached the hostess where she spotted me and quickly asked how many in my party. I responded with ""two"" and she told us to freeze and not move.  This place operates like a well-oiled machine-- hosts, servers, table runners, and bussers work in unison to move a large amount of people through this very large restaurant each night. What I will say is that it appears many people come in large groups, and a 2 top is pretty easy to snag as they've tucked small tables here and there throughout the restaurant.  Ours was perfect-- it was on the top of a tiered seating section with an overlook of the open kitchen.  One side of us was to the open railing, which helped in not feeling crammed in, which most tables are.  This place is loud and busy, but the food and service surely make up for it. We had flaming cheese, a Greek salad, grilled octopus, gyros, and dolmades.  All of it was great, with the octopus being my favorite -- tender and seasoned quite well.   Oh, and the wine!  I tried a couple Grecian whites, and my wife had a red. We enjoyed the red so much we asked if we could buy a bottle from the restaurant.  Certainly, we were told. The price?  $12.  For the bottle.  What!? We took two at that price.

My one consistent order though is always the, the Tirokafteri. It's feta cheese blended with spicy red peppers. So simple, but not to be missed.

Nevertheless, he was looking forward to having dinner at Greek Islands as the place was highly recommended by the locals here. Ambiance: It was around 9ish and the place was still buzzing. Still, our party was seated right away.  The place was lively and filled with conversations. Our table was located a few steps from the floor so it was overlooking the opened kitchen area where we all could see the kitchen staff prepared our dinner. Service: Our waiter came to our table promptly and took our drinks ordered right away. The waitstaff then came back with some breads. Overall the service was good but not outstanding. Our waiter could have been friendlier and more informative to us.  Food:  I wasn't able to taste everything that our table ordered as I didn't feel comfortable asking my colleagues for a bite of their food. Having said that, I offered to share the flaming saganaki cheese with them, of which they obliged. We all loved it! It was a bit salty, yet perfect when spreading on white bread. The presentation of the flambe cheese was alright, and the 'oppa' got a chuckle or two from our table. But the broiled octopus was the highlight of the meal for me. It was cut to a perfect bite-size. The dish was seasoned perfectly, and I was able to get the smoking char broiled scent from the octopus. Moreover, the octopus was not rubbery at all.  Greek Islands cooked their octopus perfectly. This is the epitome of how to cook an octopus dish! The food was great. The service was good. I understand that they have a free valet service, which we didn't need.

2016-10-06,5.0,"-- #491 -- BEST GREEK -- GREEK ISLANDS The wonderful aroma that flaming cheese brings...... ......this is just one of my favorite things Of all the world's cuisines, Greek food is possibly my favorite.  Those who know me might've guessed Mexican or BBQ or American Chinese, but nope.  It's some magical combination of the saganaki, the red wine, the braised lamb shanks and killer desserts, the authentically Greek servers and the quaint kitschy ambiance. Not to be confused with the suburban location in Lombard (which is also very good), the original Greek Islands boasts a large number of positive reviews (4* average out of 1,352 total postings), and for darn good reason.  This place rocks. Although I'd called ahead of time to make a rez for 2, I was told that reservations were either not needed or not accepted.  So my dinner companion and I just showed up at around 7:45 on a Wednesday night, expecting a slight wait.  After a maybe 15 minute delay (not bad) we were seated at ""the best table"", which wound up being at the highest elevated tier in the main dining room. The seating equivalent in Santorini (the geographical location, not the restaurant across the street) would've been a private table for two on a balcony overlooking the Aegean Sea, at dusk.  So for the maître-d' to say that it was the ""best"" table in the house didn't seem like much of a stretch.  I attribute this VIP-level treatment mostly to my radiantly beautiful date and less to good timing or my appearance, since I could oftentimes be described as a scruffy looking nerfherder. Already halfway through a bottle of bar-obtained Merlot when our server came by, we quickly placed our orders.  Greek Islands features plenty of tapas items on their menu, notably the skordalia (garlic spread), taramosalata (pink roe spread), dolmades (grape leaves stuffed with rice & meat, topped with an egg lemon sauce), and of course, the legendary SAGANAKI. Folks, saganaki is an absolute MUST ORDER item.  In a nutshell, it's Grecian cheese that's heated on a pan and flambéed tableside.  They do this by pouring very high proof liquor over the hot cheese.....and then setting that son of a bitch on fire.  Servers do this while saying (or shouting) 'OPA!', as per the tradition that started right here in Chicago.  The flames are then extinguished by a squeeze of lemon and the saganaki is set before you, still sizzling. Many places use different cheeses for saganaki; I've had kefalograviera, kefalotyri and kasseri (what they use at Greek Islands).  They have varying degrees of sharpness and consistency, some being more spread-able than others.  The type served here retains its shape better and has a milder flavor than the other two. Elsewise, my braised lamb shank came floating in a bog of rice pilaf and tomato sauce.  The lamb meat was up to snuff, although I could've done without all the stagnant tomatoey liquid.  My companion's chicken kabobs were proclaimed good, and the cup of avgolemono (egg-lemon soup) I had was tasty although I've had much better. Dessert choices were ample, but we only selected one - the creme caramel a.k.a. flan.  We each got Disaronno on the rocks as after dinner drinks because we're classy like that.  Our server was attentive enough and took fine care of us throughout. Bread = 4.5 Circuses = 5 All things considered, the cost of the meal was very reasonable.  For whatever reason the flan never appeared on the final bill, which leads me to believe they comped us.  I'm more than a little bummed that Yelp doesn't allow the Greek alphabet in reviews, although maybe it's for the best since I would've likely overdone it with sigmas, betas, deltas, pi, etc. Highly recommended for those seeking to treat out of town friends or family members to a memorable Chicago experience.  Greek Islands is one of the best and longest-tenured restaurants in the area and remains a staple of Greektown.

In Greece, people would gather over a 6 oz of Ouzo and talk for hours into the early morning. Real Ouzo should be almost clear with heavy emphasis on anise.

I've given 5 stars because I've dined here over a hundred times, have tried almost everything on the menu and I've never had a bad meal or experienced bad service. So, to me, if a restaurant can get that right...it's a winner. I'm not saying its perfect every single time, a few times its been alright, but the majority of the time the food is consistently good. On top of that, the portion sizes are generous and the prices are very reasonable. Plus where can you find free valet parking in the city? There's obviously a reason why this place is always busy even on a Tuesday at 9:00pm.

It was more than six times during our meal.

2016-07-26,4.0,"Many will tell you that Greek Islands is the best Greek restaurant in Greek Town, let alone the best Greek restaurant in all of Chicago. As a whole, they would not be wrong. Not only does the food here bring me back to my many times in Greece, but they get extra points for hustling like crazy to accommodate the large number of people who come to dine here on a daily basis. This place is huge and if you spend a few minutes watching the kitchen at work, it's quite remarkable to see how fast they are able to deliver such great food. The amount of prep work they do must be insane. Their menu is extensive and everything ranges from good to great, including their prices. Below are 7 thoughts and tips about Greek Islands: 1. For anyone who thinks that the tomatoes you buy from the produce section of your grocery store are how tomatoes taste (meaning zero taste), I would urge you to come here to get a closer idea of how delicious tomatoes can really be by ordering their village salad. 2. For those of you who don't like octopus because it's too chewy and/or doesn't have much flavor, I would tell you to come here to see a perfect example of octopus being prepared the right way. So many do it wrong, but the Greeks, they know what the f*&# to do with octopus. 3. If you find lamb to be too gamey and not your cup of tea, I would urge you to give the succulent lamb chops here a shot. 4. Don't forget to use the table bread to sop up all the left over juices and oil from the salad, octopus, lamb, and more. In Greece, bread is a utensil. 5. Now if moussaka and pastichio are your jam, I would tell you to look elsewhere. I love these dishes myself, but while they aren't bad here, it's maybe the one area I feel that Greek Islands falls short in bringing the true tastes of Greece to Chicago. It's possibly that I've just been spoiled and had too many Yiya made moussakas and pastichos, but even the moussaka at the Sofitel Hotel restaurant, Karavi across from the Athen's Airport is astounding and much better than the one here. 6. Our server was a lot of fun, despite my feeling like he was up selling a few things. I think my rusty Greek either helped or encouraged more of this from him. Regardless, he was enjoyable.  7. With me living in Austin where real Greek food is practically non-existant, it was awesome to get delectable and real Greek food at a fair price at Greek Islands where I've waited far too long to return to.",0.9986,0.782,0.2,0.018,0.46533251231527095

Once we were seated, the servers always seem pretty friendly here which is always a plus. Our friends and I ordered a few things to share including the sagananki which I'm not the biggest fan of since it is on the saltier side, we also got the tarmasalata spread which was pretty good. I did like their grilled octopus, it was a little charred but pretty tasty and the portion was a good size. For our entrees we didn't want anything too big so we got a plate of the gyros to share. And they were fairly typical, nothing special but also not disappointing. Overall, it's a very nice place to go with your friends and family, definitely lots of family style sharing options which is nice.

The atmosphere is casual and welcoming. I loved hearing the staff all speak Greek to each other.  The waiter recommended the Flaming Saganaki Cheese and it was spectacular!! A crispy crust with a gooey melted center, and a touch of lemon. A must have!! For dinner I had the Combo Plate. I chose the Roast Leg of Lamb and the Pastichio. The lamb was well cooked, but a little bland. The Pastichio was delicious. It was served with a roasted potato which was also very good.  I had the baklava for dessert. It was a huge portion, but it was good. Not spectacular, but good.  The service was fast and the staff was friendly. Overall I would recommend this place.

2016-06-13,4.0,"I went here with two Catalan friends after rock climbing at BKB. Greek Islands had been in my bookmark for almost two years, so I decided to go here considering it's not far. It didn't let me down and both of my friends like it. They have free valet parking, very convenient. We were told at the front desk that we need to wait for about 50 minutes, so we had some beer in the bar. I had the Hillas greek beer, which is very good. After about 45 minutes, we went to check to see if it's ready, but we were told they already buzzed us like 20 minutes ago. Actually, the buzzer never buzz. That's my only complaint about our experience. But we got seated soon after that. We had the famous Flaming Saganaki Cheese, spinach cheese pie and Moussaka as appetizer, Arni Fournou (Colorado baked lamb served with oven-browned potatoes), an octopus dish (broiled octopus, possibly), and a vegetarian dish for my vegetarian friend. Though I am not a big fan of cheese, but I really like the Saganaki, and the way it was served. I also highly recommend the Moussaka and Arni Fournou, which is very tender, very juicy. After dinner, we had a dessert the name of which I forget, but it is good. Then our Catalan friend suggested we order some spirits. I had the tsipouro, and it tastes similar to the Chinese baijiu. I like it, but since I am not an alcohol fan I cannot taste how good it is... My friends really love their ouzo and tsipouro. Anyway, it was an excellent experience for all three of us. The waiter is a young guy and he is really nice! By the way, we heard a lot of ""opa""s during our dinning. Whenever a plate or glass smashes on the ground, they say ""opa"".

Too many rooms and large spaces, places where they feed a hundred people from the suburbs on their way to sports events or while they kill time in between express trains back home.

The phyllo dough was light and flaky but a little buttery. The spinach and cheese filling was tender and perfectly spiced. There were literally hundreds of people dining here on a Saturday night. It's amazing how they still turn out the food quickly but keep the quality. You're not going to get a more classic Greek meal anywhere. Of course I would go back!",0.9671,0.897,0.103,0.0,0.48919753086419754

If you can get the seats where you go up the little stairs overlooking the main dining area by the kitchen i would sit there. It's my favorite spot lol. We did family style cause she had never had Greek food before which starts off with the saganaki which is delicious. Fried cheese...i mean it doesn't get better than that plus they flambé it in front of you which is very cool. The waiters are nice and when I tried practicing my Greek they loved to help lol. Anyways, we had the gyro appetizer along with melitzanosalata. Both delicious and tasted authentic. Following the appetizers we received the Athenian salad which was quite tasty and refreshing. Then we ordered the moussaka, leg of lamb, dolmades(my favorite) & spanikotiropita. All so delicious and amazing. Finally, we had dessert which was good subtracting the fact that the baklava was cold(not usually supposed to be cold) which made it hard and the rice pudding wasn't very sweet but the galaktaboureko was delicious and creamy.

Reminded me a bit of melted mozzarella.  I had the combo plate of beef/lamb gyro with grilled chicken. It came with a side of potatoes on a bed of onions. It was delicious. I wish they had had a side salad or had a piece of feta cheese! My boyfriend had the Beef and chicken kababs which also came with a side of rice and potatoes. Carbs on carbs. Again no feta cheese or salad. For dessert we had the yogurt and honey with walnuts. Pretty good but I guess I could've made it at home. Presentation was weird.

But before she sent us back to the waiting area to wait some more for her mistake, she spoke rudely and down to me (one of the birthday celebrants) as if I was the dumbest person on the planet. Needless to say the festive mood was gone. When I asked for the supervisor's name and contact information, I was informed by one of the staff that Tania gets a lot of complaints from customers.  Why then is this rude woman at the front desk?  Is she there to drive customers away?  And she was rude to me in front of other staffers (guy in pink shirt with earpiece and the woman handling the take-out).  They witnessed her verbal demeanor and did nothing.  The restaurant condones this woman's behavior.  I was told to inform Angelo about our experience with Tania which I plan to do.  Our family's celebration was ruined and we will go elsewhere in the future because getting verbally slapped by a woman already known for this behavior is not on our dining agenda.",-0.7348,0.821,0.077,0.102,0.423805932629462

2016-03-03,4.0,"This has always been my go-to place for Greek food. Then, a couple of years ago, I decided to try some of the other restaurants on Halsted. And while each has its own merits, Greek Islands is still my favorite.   I thiink one of the best parts of any Greek meal is the sesame bread and olive oil. Their bread always tastes like it just came out of the oven, and the olive oil is perfect for dipping. Recommended bread spreads are the Tzatziki (cucumber, yogurt and garlic), and the Melitzanosalata (roasted eggplant). Since I've never been successful at cooking lamb, I often order it out. My favorite dish is their roast loin of lamb, always tender and with a lot of flavor. I always ask them to substitute the potato with Greek green beans, sauteed with olive oil, tomatoes and amazing seasonings. (The green beans aren't on the menu, but are usually available.) Since I've also never mastered the skill of cooking octopus, another of my favorites is their grilled marinated octopus. Many restaurants overcook this dish, which makes it tough, but Greek Islands always gets it right. Lots of other pluses, including free valet parking, a good selection of Greek wines, and good service. This restaurant can get packed on weekends and when there's a big convention in town, so eat early or be prepared to wait in their large bar area. I like to split a dessert to have with coffee at the end of a meal. If there's one area where Greek Islands could improve, it's desserts. (Why do most Greek restaurants offer the same boring desserts?) So after a meal here, we often head a few blocks south to Artopolis, which has a fabulous selection of desserts and coffee drinks.

2016-03-01,3.0,"I went with a group of 8 for a party and I was rather unimpressed with Greek Islands.  Greek Islands is like so many other Greek restaurants I went to in the fact that it is set up banquet style (think Reza's) with large rooms, opulent over the top Greek statues, white-wash walls (as if all of Greece was Santorini), with too many dining rooms to count.  Greek Islands is a Greek restaurant that tries to be a Greek restaurant. During my travels in Greece I never once encountered a restaurant like Greek Islands, and all of my favorite meals in the country were unassuming small places that just made good food with fresh ingredients.  Our group elected to get the fixed prices menu, which makes sense since it works well in large groups and we got an assortment of food.  First off, no pita bread, which is a bummer. But instead of providing other types of Greek bread (like Psomi), you just get generic bland sesame bread, which makes dipping less excited. The gyro meat with tzaziki and garlic sauce was fine, but nothing one hasn't had before if they've had Greek food. The flaming cheese was tasty, the potatoes and rice were ok, the lamb and chicken were overdone, and the dessert was average.  On top of that the ""Greek"" salad came with lettuce and no anchovies. The anchovies are understandable as not many Americans enjoy anchovies, but I always judge a Greek restaurant by their salad. There's nothing quite like a true Greek salad with a heaping bowl of chopped cucumbers, red and green peppers, vinaigrette, olives, and delicious salty blocks of feta cheese. No lettuce need apply for my Greek salad, thanks.  Can't recommend Greek Islands, I'd rather eat elsewhere or better yet, save some money and head back to Greece to get some delicious food from the source!",0.972,0.792,0.139,0.069,0.32688492063492064

My good buddy took me here with his girl when I first came to Chicago. Seeing that it was walking distance from me, of course it'd be a no-brainer that we come. The first time we came, we did it family style, which comes with appetizers, gyros, some main dishes, and dessert. The following dinner dates have been a la carte with both food and wine, and there has yet to be a time where I didn't enjoy my experience. One thing's for sure, you have to order these two appetizers: saganaki (flaming cheese) and taramosalata (roe spread). If I had just these two on my plate, I'd be good for the rest of the evening. They put on a quick show for you before presenting the cheese, and the roe spread on Bruschetta is to die for. As for the mains, I highly recommend a plate of their gyros, which taste better and less oily as those chain gyro shops around the corner. Anything with lamb here is another must! The way they braise their lamb meats and stew it is phenomenal. Lastly, I recently had their sea bass, which was incredible! A nice hint of citrus over juicy bass made this the perfect dinner. Service here has always been friendly and fun, as well as the ambiance. They have a large open patio that is perfect for summertime.

We got seated pretty much right away. Our waitor was attentive, and...professional! I only say this because he literally put a small plate in front of me for our appetizer to share, and I looked at it, didn't even notice there was a teeny-tiny stain on it, before I knew it, he took it away with an apology for the ""dirty"" plate...What?! Also, after we had the bread, he came back with this little tool (in a shape of a credit card?) that he used to clean up the bread crumbs off the table in the most gracious way possible. He's really not your typical nice waitor who try to do his job right, mine was killing it! Last thing, your water will never be half empty for a long time! My friends and I were actually so impressed we jokingly tried to drink our water so fast to see whether or not they'd be able to get us more right away, and they did!!! Top-notch service Greek Islands! Food was alright. A little too greasy for my brunch taste. That said, the appetizers were delicious. We got one cold combination appetizer and one pan fried calamari dish to share! We also got the cheese that they flame up right before serving, which was really cool and probably one of their most popular dishes (we saw a few other tables who got the same thing!).  Prices is honestly reasonable, considering their insanely good service, free parking, and generous portion size. The seafood dishes could get a bit pricey, but still within the $$ range! Our party of 6 got 3 appetizers, some coffee and juice, 6 entrees for about $150 altogether. Not bad in my opinion!

If you're in the area, I think it's worth it to even just order dessert ($6 for baklava) for the free valet parking! I was seated immediately upon entering on a Monday night around 6PM. I ordered the spanikopita to start. The waiter asked, ""You mean the spinach pie?"" I nodded, but thought this was strange. I've been to Greece and spent a month there. I know I called it the right name! The spanikopita arrived, but did not come in phyllo triangles. Instead, it was more like a piece of a spinach casserole. It was good, but not the best. Instead of cheese cubes, I would've preferred the filling to be more of a combination of cheese sauce and spinach, not just spinach. I also ordered the broiled octopus with rice and potatoes. The octopus was perfectly cooked (not rubbery) and definitely had those Greek flavors of lemon and olive oil. It was yummy! I could not eat all of it. I wish there had been more rice (you get half of a bread plate's worth, so not much). The potato was the best part. I was a bit dubious at first because the potato arrived, smothered in a tomato sauce, but it was phenomenal. I am baffled as to how the depth of flavor is achieved. Roasted tomatoes? Lots of garlic? It was absolutely delicious, and I wish there had been more. Service was decent. The waiter kept asking me every five minutes if I ""was happy,"" and I wanted at some point to say that I'd be happy if I won the lottery. I gave three stars for the spanikopita.

On the side we had rice pilaf and potato, both of which were absolutely fantastic. Even though we had plenty of food, we still ordered a couple of extra things, including fried calamari and grilled octopus.  The octopus was good, I didn't try the calamri but others enjoyed it. We received a ridiculously large plate of desert that included Baklava, Galaktoburiko, Karidopita.  The Baklava was good, the Galaktoburiko was amazing it had a lemony flavor.  I was not a fan of the Karidopita (it was fine, but really nothing special in comparison to the others).

The second you walk through the doors of this dining establishment, your nose is hit with the most taste bud tantalizing smells, if you close your eyes, you can virtually imagine that you are in fact in Greece... And when you open them, the decor and waitstaff will only help your imagination along! This place is CROWDED and for good reason, but the staff and managers seem to have an awesome system that files people in and out in no time, aka: there is virtually no wait for a table, regardless of the number in your party. There was three of us and immediately we were directed to our table, that overlooked the kitchen...  Now for the tasty details! Here's what we ordered: - Eggplant Dip: simple yet tasty as hell thanks to the garlic and the creamy texture  - Flaming Cheese: smelled like what heaven must smell like, which means it obviously tasted good too. - Grilled Octopus: my favorite thing ever, grilled octopus is chewy, yet sweet, yet meaty, and just hands down delicious! - Grilled Squid: I actually think I liked this dish better than the octopus as it was a bit crispier (without being fried) and the tentacles were PERFECTLY COOKED! - Whole Roasted Seabass: go big or go home, so I went big and got the whole Seabass, bones and all, and pretty much sucked every morsel of meat off that sucker. Had to get my money's worth, not like it was all that hard considering they give you a WHOLE FISH for $20.95! - Two sides of Vegetables: I don't like potatoes and our server listened to me and made sure to serve me up two sides that had minimal potatoes in them. These stewed veggies kicked some serious ass! Reminded me of my dad's cooking! - Moussaka: I know my friend LOVES THIS... Because even though she was pretty full when the main event arrived, she still tried her best to finish it, alas: she did get a doggy bag so she could make her co-workers JEALOUS at lunch the next day! - Salad with Gyro Meat: my friend who got this really wishes she didn't load up on McDonalds right before coming to dinner! The meat was flavorful but not dripping in fat. Lent a wonderful flavor to the salad greens.  - Salad with Cheese: this went down the hatch in five seconds. Clearly a winner.  If I could, and honestly, I really think I could convince them, I would go back to The Greek Islands again tonight and re-order the grilled calamari... And then order other items on the menu I wanted... It would honestly be a whole new experience because there are so many different offerings!! I'd probably devour the salmon and swordfish. That being said, I unfortunately will probably have to expand my horizons and try other places during the rest of my stay here in Chicago, but if I return... It's on! PS: FOR ALL OF THE FOOD I ATE: I only paid $50! WTF!!!!!!",0.9986,0.727,0.211,0.062,0.5020065999574196

We sampled the appetizers, oh wait first we had cocktails in the bar. The bartender was very fun and accommodating to a group of giggly  ladies from out of town. Drink prices are fair and a fair pour for the money. Once we were seated we let the two Greeks among us do the ordering. I have never tasted octopus as good and as fresh as this. It was very fresh and tender and a little on the lemony side with EVOO and parsley. Then there was dolmas, fired cheese (OMG) bread with greek yogurt (who knew bread and yogurt could be so tasty together?) For dinner I had a rolled chicken dish the was great it was served with really good rice and guess what else? You got it, more yogurt! One (Greek) person in our party had a sampler plate and he said the lamb was outstanding. the other Greek guest has the Gyros and she said it was close to her mom's so I think that say a lot about the authenticity of the food at Greek Islands.

It came with one very filling pita and enough meat for two. My husband got the meatball sandwich. I wasn't a fan but he loved it. Our friends ordered a Greek salad and the gyro plate. Salad was unremarkable and the gyro plate was similar to my special but it had much more meat.  I think it took longer to get the check than our food.

2015-06-08,1.0,"I always had low expectations for the restaurants in Greektown, but after a flight home from a great weekend, I was feeling optimistic and decided to give the highest rated place a second chance.  I could go on and on about my experience working at Greek restaurants, working at a restaurant IN Greece, my grandmothers recipes, my mother cooking them all my life, Greek citizenship, yadda yadda yadda, but I won't.   First things first: The staple of Greek food, the reason why it's so good, is that everything is always fresh, which is why I was disappointed from the get-go.  Everything tasted and felt like it had come out of a pan prepared at the beginning of the week. EVERY item we ordered was bland and lacked even basic seasonings outside of salt.  EVERY dish was overly oiled and greasy.   Cold spread Sampler: the taramo had no flavor outside of salt and was a weird neon pink, there was no lemon in it.  The melitzanosalata tasted like it had been sitting in the fridge for about two weeks. The tirokafteri was the saving grace.  The bread was tasteless, and we had to ask for pita. Saganaki: the reason you light this fried cheese on fire with cheap brandy is because it has no taste. It was sliced way too thin, and as soon as you cut it, it loses shape and flops around in the oil in the pan. Salad: the fresh dill in the Marouli salad tasted like it had been harvested weeks before, and the salad didn't even have any cheese in it, so there was no rounding out of flavors. The cheese would have added salt, and was the one dish that desperately needed it in the dressing. Main: She went for the Pastichio, I went for one of my favorites, Keftedes. I thought it would be the one thing they couldn't screw up.   Neither of us finished more than half our dishes, I couldn't bring myself to try hers, but it was covered in this thin tomato sauce that looked like it had come out of a can.  I'm guessing it was the same that was dumped on my dry, flavorless meatballs sitting sadly on the plate.  Nothing in this place tasted fresh, it all felt like it had been sitting for days in a vat, then loaded on a plate, put under a heat lamp, and served.  I was heartbroken, all I wanted was something familiar; the comfort food I grew up with.  I paid up and will stick to the two remaining high quality Greek places in the city in Lakeview and Bucktown.",0.6763,0.778,0.117,0.105,0.46638888888888874

They seem to have it made as the go-to place for tourists and people wanting to experience Greektown so they have no lack of customers and I think this has led to complacency and thus service has suffered. We went there today for Greek Orthodox Easter. The person that took us to out table came back 5 minutes after seating us and said ""no, no, this is a 4- person table, you can't sit here!"" (We were a party of 2), to which we replied ""but you sat us here"" and then he responded ""no, you can't sit here"" with a scolding tone and took us to another table. Nice. Whatever. We ordered our food and our server would never look at us or talk to us, he would just drop the plate on the table (not gently) and leave. Also, he never brought us the Greek Easter eggs that other tables were getting. What do they care? We were just 2 people. But there are many Greek restaurants in this town, and next time we want Greek food we'll think twice about returning to Greek Islands.  By the way, waiters yell Opa! every few minutes when the saganaki plates are lit on fire. My friend who is Greek said that yelling Opa! in Greece is very rare and is usually as part of a dance.

I am greek and there is so much more to our cuisine than gyros and souvlaki so I am happy to see that highlighted at Greek Islands restaurant. First off skip that bread they leave on the table , completely sub par. Pay the 42 cents and as for the pita, one per person is probably the right amount. The grilled octopus appetizer is just awesome. Simple and executed correctly greek style. My very Greek mother and I both got two different lamb dishes. The lamb is out of this world it falls off the bone and melts in your mouth , kudos to the chef on that. The lamb with the egg lemon and artichokes is the way to go and far superior to the lamb in the red sauce with the orzo. In fact we sent the orzo back it was over cooked and dry and we weren't huge on the addition of wine in the red sauce. Service staff is fluent in Greek which was a nice touch for us.

The platter for 2 was small for $4.50 a person. We shared the spartan chicken. This is where we felt cheated. It was flavorful and very moist. The problem we had was that half of the meat on both of the drumsticks was missing. We couldn't tell if it was cut or trimmed.  The menu had 5 pieces of chicken was included. We only got 4. And the 2 pieces of dark meat and drumstick were small. And then on top of that half the meat on both drumsticks were missing.

The server came to the table and asked if we were ready to order--clearly we weren't since we didn't even order drinks yet. We finally get our water and order appetizers and that took forever too. After we got out appetizers we didn't see our server for almost 20 minutes or so....at this point everyone at our table is agitated because of the service. It was also very clear that the server and bussers were aggravated too at who knows what. I was so upset at the rude and unattentive service I personally didn't even order an entrée because I was done with this place and they weren't going to get any of my money.

Like most restaurants, they will not seat you unless your entire party has arrived. Makes sense. However, if you are the first to arrive and put your name down for the group, they don't actually count you as being there and waiting. For example, I arrived and put my name down for a table of 4 and they told me to let them know when the rest of the party has arrived. There was about a 30minute wait at that time, but they wouldn't count my group as being there (even though they take your name). Then about 15 minutes later, when the whole group was there, our wait was again 30minutes.  If someone is sitting there and waiting for 15 minutes, it should count toward their total wait time to be seated, regardless of whether the group is present. Now if everyone else didn't show up by the time the table was ready, it would make sense not to seat the person without the group.

2015-01-17,4.0,"It's been a few years since I've eaten at the Greek Islands but it's not for any reason on their end. I took a date I met online for her birthday (a couple days ahead of time as she had another commitment for her special day. Not much there has changed since I had my first meal here back in 1983. I have taken so many friends (male & female) & work colleagues over the years (except the last 5) I can't even count them. I've eaten at most of the Greek restaurants over the years, generally good experiences but GI is the standard bearer for authentic Greek cuisine. There was little exception last nite. I am usually pretty principled in limiting how much I spend dining out but that changes eating here. My date & I ordered the family style dinner, choosing for the 4 main courses the roast leg of lamb, pork on the spit, chicken Riganati & pastichio. The lamb & pork were excellent, chicken slightly dry but nevertheless good. The pastichio is in the fridge which I shall dine on tonite. The gyros we had as an appetizer spoke for itself, though I was surprised at the missing pita bread (maybe the restaurant expected us to eat it with their own classic Greek bread). Whatever, it was tasty, especially with the accompanying tzatziki sauce (BTW, the horseradish yogurt sauce that came with the pork, well, that also speaks for itself). The potato & rice combo with its traditional Greek sauce - out of this world.  (BTW, as an aside, though not ordered this time, this critiquer also recommends the kokkinisto or kalamari.)  As usual, I got the flaming saganaki & Greek salad as well, though this time as part of the family style dinner. The cheese seemed a bit less salty than in the past but nevertheless always a real treat. The salad is always good, even better when you use the awesome imported olive oil at the table. I fretted a bit not to see anchovies in the salad (which costs extra) but minor point. It goes great with the bread. The baklava & karidopita were awesome as well; they came with a candle & several GI workers to sing Happy Birthday to my date. Neighboring diners chimed in. Perfect setting to combine with the existent ambiance. You can't help but love it.   A few minor criticisms which keeps me at 4 stars than 5. When ordering the appetizers in the family dinner, one is supposed to get a choice of three separate items (in addition to the gyros): taramosalata, melitzanosalata or skordalia. We would have preferred the skordalia but were given the taramosalata, which is very good & smooth & tastes great with the Greek bread. Years ago when I had it, it was white. Now it's pink but still tasty. Also when our table was finally called, we were given a polite lecture by a staffer that our names were called 3X over a span of 15 minutes. The problem was when my date's name was called a rhyming different name, which is why we didn't respond when we heard the wrong name. Something went awry there but in the end, the dining experience more than made up for it. Lastly, and this is my biggest gripe - the website needs work, particularly the price structure. The family style dinners are priced online at $19.95. Their loose paper menu in the waiting area says $20.95. The actual menu price is $22.95. Plus the beverage prices are missing. And the web link that says ""From Our Boiler"", they mean ""Broiler"". I daresay few folks would eat the items listed if they were boiled rather than broiled. GI web personnel would do well to view the Parthenon's professionally done website menu where everything can be read in one single link (except you choose whether you want the lunch or dinner menu). The Parthenon is a good place also (though some reviews I read make it appear that it's different now than when I was here years ago), though all signs point to the GI being superior. But at least the GI web staff should take a cue from the Parthenon's web crew. That said, given the packed house often prevalent at GI, I doubt they're too worried about losing customers as a result of their somewhat weak website. I may not come often to the GI as I used to but I know when I come, I will get great food, water glasses constantly filled, bread refills and everything else that comes with professional yet pleasant Greek service. The prices these days may make it more challenging on the pocketbook but when you leave, it will likely be with a doggy bag. You certainly won't leave hungry and not without a smile.

Started off with a Greek beer and three apps - the flaming cheese, grilled octopus, and dolmades. Flaming cheese tasted like the best part of a pizza (the cheese thats a little too warm and might be a tad overcooked). It was phenomenal though I did miss out on the initial tableside lighting (it came over already on fire). The octopus had a nice char to it. The dolmades were solid as well.  For dinner I went with one of the lamb specials and it's was excellent. It was lamb cooked in a tomato sauce with orzo. The lamb was very tender (flakes with a fork) and the orzo was a nice compliment. I definitely recommend sticking the bread into the sauce as opposed to just butter (or ovo).

Sunday around noon this huge restaurant was packed, but we had a dedicated crew of servers in a private room. Course after course was served, plates were cleared, silverware replaced, water glasses filled--it was professional in the extreme. We even got a visit from Gus, who apparently owns or founded this restaurant, wears a cap, and provides local color. Appetizers included saganaki, tzatziki, taramosalata, gyro and feta salad. The tzatziki was awesome, really tart and refreshing, and the gyro (a combination of beef and lamb) was well-seasoned and moist. The firm block of feta cheese was nice, not too salty.  Main courses were endless. Among the ones I tried, the roast lamb was tender and tasty, the chicken kabobs well seasoned and just a tad dry, and the vegetarian moussaka was delish. These came with a sort of Greek ratatouille (briami) that was terrific. The desserts--all the usual suspects--were pretty ordinary. The only dish I had a problem with was the taramosalata. It was overly-whipped to the consistency of air, did not taste of fish at all, and was bright pink, the exact color of Pepto-Bismol. That color must result from food coloring and additives; it cannot exist in the real world. Krinos Taramosalata in a jar is better. So for an event lunch in a nice room with very generous servings (and containers offered for taking home the leftovers), this place cannot be faulted for its hospitality.  Overall I liked the food.  I did leave with one question, however--who eats like this at noon on Sunday?

Get the flaming saganaki cheese appetizer!  I don't even like cheese!  I only eat brie, pepperjack and motzarella when it's on my pizza or pasta.  But this appetizer had just the right amount of showy pizzazz as the waiter puts on a flaming show for you as he serves it.  Opa!  Had the right amount of salty cheesiness and the slightly browned surface added great textural variety.  I'll also admit that prior to agreeing to go to this restaurant I said to a friend, why are we going to a Greek restaurant?  I can get amazing Greek food in NYC anytime I want!  I want something unique to Chicago!  So when I was choosing my entree and looking at the list of specials, I wondered if I would just be getting some gyro meat, with average tzatziki sauce, etc.  I ended up getting the combo plate so I could try a variety of ""traditional favorites.""  A friend got the meat pie which was on the specials menu.  The food was excellent.  And I had yet another surprising discovery: I normally hate stuffed grape leaves (dolmas), but this one had a lot of meat with a little bit of cheese over it and it was awesome!  Who knew that two of my least eaten Greek foods would taste so amazing together!  The mousaka was also delicious.  I tried my friend's meat pie, which by the way looked gorgeous and the portion size was enough for 2, and was also pleased by the flavor and slightly crispy dough.   Finally, even though our stomach was about to explode and shirt buttons were about to pop, we opted to get the baklava!  It's giant so be prepared to share it with at least one other person. All in all, very pleased with the service and food.  I'd recommend this place to tourists and natives alike!  If you've visited Chicago several times and are ready to venture away from the more common tourist attractions, give this place a try.  And even if it's your first time in Chicago, you'll still go home happy and won't regret missing out on deep dish pizza.

2014-07-23,4.0,"I love, love, love Greek food and have eaten at many Greek restaurants all over the place--so with all of my prior dining experiences I think it's safe to say this place sure serves some yummy food! Normally, when I'm visiting other cities, I like to do my typical extensive yelping and googling of all the best restaurants around and make a huge, long list of all the places I just have to visit.  This was not the case for this place, but I am glad I got to experience this restaurant.  One of the people I was with is from Greece and assured me that we needed to try this place and that the food was both authentic and delicious.... I mean, someone from Greece has to have some sort of credibility, I guess.... So we went--good call. We started with the Flaming Saganaki Cheese, Grilled Octopus, Dolmades, Tzatziki with Grilled Pita Bread and the Traditional Greek Village Salad.  Let me tell you, that cheese looked amazing!!!  I didn't taste it (dairy-free lifestyle attempt) but everyone else I was with devoured it.  The other appetizers were really good... and I did sneak a bite of the Tzatziki, and thoroughly enjoyed it!  Also, the grilled octopus was surprisingly good as well.  My only prior experiences with octopus have been at sushi restaurants and I've always found it to be very rubbery and flavorless, but that was not the case here at all!   Not sure if it has something to do with it being grilled or cut into small pieces, but it was seasoned well and very easy to eat. The main dishes were delicious as well.  I highly recommend the Butterflied Lamp Chops (cooked to a perfect Medium Rare) which have an amazing flavor and are oh so tender.  The Sea Bass was also very yummy! And whatever sauce they pour over their rice, I love it.  Not sure about that random huge potato chunk served on the rice plates (ick! I hate potatoes) but get the rice as a side.  The baked okra is good too! That was my first time ever trying okra and I liked it a lot. To me, dessert is a must, so I made sure that we ordered just about every dessert offered on the menu.  My fave was the Baklava.  It tasted the same as it does at all other Greek restaurants, and I always, always love it.  The spice cake was also yummy--light and full of that comforting/cozy spice flavor that I crave every fall.  Oh, we did get some custard type dessert as well that looked like an omelet with phyllo dough on top... Not sure what that was called, but it did not look appealing.  I'd say you're better off trying something else.",0.9988,0.741,0.236,0.023,0.5711990740740739

The place is huge and good for large parties or intimate dinners.  I love the atmosphere here, it's fun and lively and you see lots of families and lots of Greek people which is always good.  There are a couple of tables that are in horrible spots (learned this the hard way), so if you don't like where you are seated be sure to ask to be moved.  They are always nice and friendly so it won't be a problem. I always order the same thing, but I go with people who are Greek all the time and they love it too.  I've never heard a single person complain when we go to Greek Islands.  Their rice and sauce is the best in town, no joke.  I cannot order dinner without getting rice.  I sometimes even take a side home with me for another treat.  The chicken kabobs is my go to and the chicken is always cooked perfectly and has that great charred taste.  The saganaki is good and so is the greek salad sans the eyebrows, er, I mean anchovies.  I love the two types of bread they bring, I can eat the entire basket myself and they have no problem keeping it coming if you ask :) All in all a great place and I highly suggest you give it a try if you are looking for classic Greek food.  It gets really busy but they take reservations and if you go early (around 5p) it's less frantic.",0.9964,0.744,0.213,0.043,0.4520573192239859

Most or all of the staff were Greek (duh, it's in Greek Town), and friendly.  The guy sitting next to me was Greek American, visiting from California, and seemed to have a similarly positive experience.  Will definitely try this place again on a future trip to Chicago!",0.9582,0.786,0.161,0.053,0.2524449035812672

Surprisingly cheap prices for wines that were much better than that price would usually indicate in a restaurant (the bottle I had would have pleased me at twice the price).

2014-05-13,2.0,"Food is great, service is sub-par. I visited the restaurant last Saturday evening, it was very crowded but we were told the wait for 2 would be 15-30 minutes which we agreed was totally acceptable. We ended up waiting for over an hour. Apparently the host thought we left and crossed our names off the list (although we still had the pager they gave us when they first took our name down.....). After complaining about the wait another host unapologetically seated us at a wobbly table next to the bus boy station. We got rushed through the appetizer (it came literally 3 minutes after we ordered) and the main course came shortly after. They were clearly trying to move people.  The food was great-as always. But not worth an hour wait and being rushed by our terse server. We will not be back any time soon. I also contacted the restaurant to let them know about our poor experience and never heard anything back. Greek Islands definitely caters to larger parties. If you go on a weekend, and aren't a large party, be prepared for poor service.",0.7354,0.82,0.105,0.075,0.3135298563869992
2014-05-13,5.0,"All the places in Greek town are delicious and provide great service.  This just happens to be my favorite one. 1. great food 2. great service 3. free valet parking 4. always full- but surprisingly quick turnaround time for seats I always start with the chicago creation, flaming saganaki. If you've never had it, you MUST order it just to say you've tried it.  Plus who doesn't like melted tasty cheese? If you prefer a cold plate, the Cold Octupus salad is a good starter while you wait.  Perfectly cooked and always fresh. I have never been disappointed by a dish here.  The lamb is perfectly seasoned and tender.  The mousaka contain fresh veggies (zucchini and eggplant) baked within that fluffy potato casserole.   Because I want a bit of everything, I'll normally go with the Combination plate which has: roast leg of lamb, mousaka, dolmades (rolls of grape leaves stuffed with rice, ground meat, and herbs), meatball, vegetables & potatoes.  This is a big meal for anyone, but provides a good taste of everything so next time you can venture out on a single dish.  I'll always come back to this place and I think you will too. PRO TIP:  If you are waiting in line for a table, swing on over to the bar on the side and enjoy a glass of wine while you wait.  Your table will be ready before you know it.",0.9947,0.772,0.217,0.01,0.564010989010989

To start, the menu is vast with offerings of so many Greek dishes.  If the menu is overwhelming or if you're not familiar with Greek food, fear not, the authentically Greek waitstaff will assist in every way possible and point you in the right direction.   The restaurant is vast with many different sections, but can still be the spot to have a romantic dinner.   The Saganiki (sp?), Mousaka, Grecian Chicken and Greek Potatoes are some of my favorite here.  I'm not a Baklava fan, but my wife swears by it here.  Authentic Greek beers and wine are also offered at Greek Islands. Complimentary parking is available here so as to save you the trouble of looking for parking in Chicago's complicated mess of where to park.  Make sure you tip your valet's as they are just as friendly as everyone inside. Last but not least, Greek Islands is great for parties.  My wife and I threw our son's first birthday party here with about 60 of our family and friends and the experience, food and staff were nothing short of amazing.  We couldn't have asked for a better time.

Service: We had an amazing server--always on his toes. Our water glasses were consistently filled, and we were always asked how we were doing. Top notch service. Food: We had the server recommend us everything.  -Flaming saganaki cheese: I crave this on the daily now that I'm back in Seattle.  -Grilled octopus: I thought I was going to love this, but I ended up not really liking it because the texture was mushy (I like chewy octopus) and the flavor was a little too pungent for me. This might just be a personal preference. -Lamb (the server recommended a combo dish and I can't remember what it was): Very flavorful and tender.  -Mousaka: I've actually never had mousaka before, but I was pleasantly surprised with how much I loved it. Had to change my original negative thoughts of eggplant! -Rice pilafi: Oh my god. Drool.  -Rice pudding: I love rice pudding, so this was an exciting part of the meal. Smooth and refreshing. Perfect amount of sweetness. -Yogurt with honey and nuts: This is probably my new favorite dessert of all time. It was a perfect way to end our Greek food experience. The nuts were the icing on the cake. I'll have to come back to this place once I make a trip back to Chicago.

2014-05-09,2.0,First off the Waiter Louis was The best thing about this place. It was kind of crazy because we had a Table for 5 with absolutely no room to put the food. I was there with my elderly parents and aunt and husband and I spent the entire time juggling plates so they could have room for their food. What nonsense! Especially when the restaurant was not even a quarter full. Food was good but nothing special. 3 of us had family style and 2 ordered regular meals. Family style was abundant and tasty enough but both the chicken kabob and their famous greek chicken was Dry Dry Dry. I had the half Greek chicken and not only was it dry but it lacked flavor and MEAT!  That was the skinniest chicken I think I've ever almost ate. lol It was literally a struggle to find a piece of meat to cut off the bone. To top off our family lunch the table next door ordered the flaming cheese and the waiter singed my mother's hair and burnt his hand badly. Very scary.  Women wear hairspray guys!  Please train your waiters to stay far away from people's hair for gods sake! The whole restaurant saw this happen but the manager did not come over to us until I called for him. Hmmmm. When he did come he stood and listened to me politely and apologized most insincerely and then walked away.  Too many GREAT Greek restaurants in the city to ever waste my time on this place again.  OPA!,-0.6117,0.795,0.094,0.111,0.579561885482938

I had the Spinach and Cheese Pie + Vegetarian Mousaka (eggplant, zucchini and potato casserole).  They were both very good, filling dishes.  Each portion was only a 1/2 portion, but I couldn't finish my meal!

Also they have a policy of having the whole group present before putting your name in which is reasonable. The host though was a bit rude; we misheard the name and when my friend approached the stand he was greeted by a grunt and shooed away with hand gestures. I cannot recall all that was ordered but remembered that I did enjoy the saganaki $5.95. I had the Ionian calamari dish $13.95  but it was overly saltes. Also I barely tasted any squid. The saving grace was the potato on my plate - which I thoroughly enjoyed. (I'm a big potato person) My boy friend got the bass which was around ~$18. The first few bites were pretty salty but the rest he really liked. However they were careless with the deboning, I nearly choked a few times.I didn't hear any comments from my other friends about their food so it probably isn't worth mentioning. My boyfriend and one of my other friends had Greek beer for the first time and really liked that, but then again, it really doesn't say much about the restaurant other than that they serve it. The service was okay, just the usually refilling of water and bringing food.

2014-04-19,3.0,"This is a hard one to rate because some of their entrees are just, fantastic.  The flavors and preparation are flavorful and this is coming from someone that hasn't been impressed in the past with Grecian cuisine.  I consider this real Greek foods beyond the Americanized staples we're so used to; i.e gyros, Grecian chicken,etc.  (By the way, their gyros are not good, so order something more traditional)  And although some of their entrees are the best I've ever had, the service sucks so bad I'm not sure I could repeat the experience.   I sat with a large group recently and we sampled much of their menu.  There are some entrees and appetizers that are great and there are others that should be deleted, never to return.  Like this one appetizer which is composed of cold mashed potatoes with garlic and an olive, that's it.  It might have had some olive oil but its served chilled with bread.  Soon after the appetizer hit the table I cut a slice of bread and added a shmear to one side.  Just then a waiter grabs my small plate with bread slices with shmear and starts to walk away.  I call him back thinking (WTF) asking why he was removing it and with questionable thick eyebrows he looks sternly at me (like I'm the dumbass) he says "" you need space for your salad, salad is ready."" I yelled back "" I paid for that bread and the cold appetizer"".  He goes a couple steps, then turns and brings it back just placing it clumsily back on the table.  He says, ""now you don't have space for salad buddy"".  The few people sitting nearby shared a look of ""WHAT THE F.."" with me.  The rest of dinner had a few more of these odd situations which led me to say ""seriously, WTF"".  This started a conversation at the table which led to one in our group responding that in Europe service like this is common.  It's not good and men as waiters can be headstrong and do as they wish.  Thing is though, this ain't Europe.  It's America and to keep customers happy, you have to be happy and show kindness and courtesy and dinner service was none of that. So if you decide to go, order based on what people have reviewed about.  Items from their grill are excellent.  The grilled octopus is so divine, you'll swear you've never had it that good before.  The grilled meats and full fish, it's all tasty stuff.  Take a group and share because that's where the excitement is.  Go solo to order a gyros and cold ass potato shmear and you'll dislike it.",0.9756,0.815,0.109,0.076,0.5475198412698413

You basically have a ton of cars trying to park depending on how busy it is, which also happen to be waiting on the free valet as mentioned.  So might you be waiting? Absolutely? Is it also now somewhat hazardous to try to get out of your car to even get into the restaurant? You bet. Thus is the pain of a successfully busy area. Not only do you have a crazy valet line, you have a crazy waitlist as well.  I think we waited about 20-30 minutes before we got a table that worked for us.

As long as you know your greek, you're heading towards amazing things. The grilled pork is amazing (yes, I had meat), the vegetarian options are awesome - I could eat tzatziki with grilled vegetables every day of my life, and all in all the food is good.

It's not hard to make a meal just out of appetizers., Really not much can be said other than ""eat here"", which is notable and good.  Oh yeah, and try the muscat wine. I warn you that it's really strong (muscat is extra fermented/extra alcohol), but also sweet and delicious.  Food/drink/appetizer, you can't go wrong.

Maybe the extremely miserable RUDE guy at coat check had something to do with it... MEAN mugging us for keeping the door open (letting out the warm) while we were trying to transport a very unmobile elderly person with a sickness. At one point he yelled ""All right all rights that's enough!!"" wafting his arm swiftly like ""get in! get in!"". This happened when entering AND when leaving.  I mean, what do you really expect from us in the moment. There were two doors you had to keep open while two people propped her up to get her inside! Everyone did a fantastic job EXCEPT the miserable troll working the coat check, hence the 3 stars. I do recommend if you want authentic Greek food, the service was great. Just keep your jacket with you, otherwise you'll be sitting there with the image of a miserable troll burned into your memory for the rest of the evening.

2014-01-25,4.0,"My mother lived in Chicago for years, so when my boyfriend and I went there for a Christmas getaway, she said we COULD NOT leave without going to Greektown and trying the Saganaki(flaming cheese)! The hotel's concierge recommended this place and it was overall wonderful. First off, the place was SO busy! They don't do reservations, so the concierge got us supposed 'advanced seating' but the host at the front seemed to not know what we were talking about even after we showed him the card from the hotel and just shrugged us off. So we ended up waiting about half an hour but in the end it was worth it. So of course we got the Saganaki and it was delicious -- salty and creamy and smooth, just wonderful. The waiter definitely did shout ""Oopa!"" when he set it on fire! He did not, however, make the flames go up to the ceiling like my mother said he would, but he would've set the neighboring customers' hair on fire if he had, so I suspect that experience is either a thing of the past or an embellishment on my mom's part. I tried an imported Greek wine I could not begin to pronounce with a hint of rose flavor which I loved. My boyfriend got a lamb dish that was wonderful, but came with rice covered in a red sauce that was kinda weird and not really necessary. I enjoyed the fact that they offered a your-choice combo platter where you can get half-portions of most of the entrees, because I love Mediterranean cuisine but hate having to choose just one item. I got the spinach pie, dolmas(stuffed grape leaves), and gyro meat, and it also came with hummus. Everything was really good, but the dolmas were the best I have ever had anywhere in my life! We had plenty to take back to the hotel with us along with a baklava which was also wonderful, just as good as my friend's Palestinian mother made for us years ago.  The service there was really incredible. I have no idea how many tables our server had, but it had to be quite a few considering EVERY table was occupied and I only saw a handful of servers around. That being said, he seemed to know what we needed before we needed it, answered all our questions, and managed to be thoughtful and courteous despite moving at lightning speed.  I would definitely visit here again, but I think first I will try to find a restaurant that still lets the saganaki fire go to the ceiling like my mom said. ;)",0.9952,0.785,0.159,0.057,0.5819819819819819

2014-01-23,4.0,"This place just makes me want to be Greek.  I started out at the bar and the bar tender talked me into Greek beer. I fell in love. It's a lot like Japanese beer because it's light without a heavy flavor so you can pair it with fish.  Our waiter, Augustus (brilliant!) talked us into some sort of flaming cheese app that wasn't just exciting but delicious enough for me to be embarrassed that I was eating it so quickly. We also got the grilled calamari and I would have taken a bath in that stuff it was so good. Unfortunately, I can't spell what I got, but it was a lemon/olive oil chicken because I wanted something simple. There wasn't a thing simple about it. This dish exploded with amazing flavors and stuck right to my ribs. I could eat it for days.  The whole place looks like the outside of a little Greek village.

2014-01-11,3.0,"This was my first time eating in Greektown and in fact also my first time eating at a Greek restaurant!  To start off we had the Flaming Saganaki cheese which was quite the show when the waiter flambeed it tableside. He almost burned off my friend's hair! The dish is literally a flat square of imported Greek cheese which had lots of flavor and saltiness to it. I ate it with the bread + olive oil which is also imported from Greece. Delicious combination. The olive oil is awesome!  For my entree, I got the Pork tenderloin. It's one of the newer items on the menu (called Bzema Meti or something like that....). The flat pieces of tenderloin was served with red and green peppers, onions, all mixed into a red wine and tomato sauce. The dish also came with rice and potato on the side. Overall I thought it was okay. It was extremely saucy and you had to dig around for the pieces of meat which wasn't all that much. The red sauce would make an excellent sauce for spaghetti though if you bring home leftovers.  I also tried one of the lamb dishes and the meat was unbelievably tender - although  it had a very gamey lamb taste to it which wasn't pleasant for my palate. If you're in the mood for gyros and meat, order the Homemade Gyros entree! It comes with loads of meat (a pile to be exact) but weirdly enough only one pita bread that's about 8 inches in diameter.  The waiters were extremely friendly towards are party. They brought over a generous slice of delicious cake for my friend's birthday. Not sure what type of cake it was (couldn't find it on the menu) but it had bananas, walnuts, and coconut flakes. It was unlike any other cakes I've tried before. One thing I thought was slightly awkward though was that one of the waiters started cleaning crumbs off our table while we were still finishing up and talking. He kept reaching in between us and reaching into the table!  The ambiance of the restaurant was really nice. Large and comforting, great decorations, and I loved the music they played in the background. And free valet parking is always ALWAYS a bonus.  Overall I wouldn't mind returning if a friend wanted to come but I probably wouldn't choose this restaurant for myself. I'd like to try a different entree and also their desserts though!",0.9967,0.806,0.166,0.028,0.5090498236331571

The keftedes (lamb meatballs) somehow managed to be simultaneously light and savory, which seems impossible for a meatball, but was definitely achieved.

When he told me we were having Greek, I was a little down - but he has never failed to take me to delicious restaurant in Chicago! As soon as I opened up the menu, I was suddenly very excited and there was so much that looked good that I wanted to order. We probably ordered more than two people could eat (Well... not probably. We did. But I ate it all anyway.) We ordered the Flaming Saganaki Cheese, the Domasalata, the Lamb Kokkinisto and the Moussaka. EVERYTHING was delicious. They flambé the cheese when they bring it to your table and it's all melted and cheesy and warm and toasty. I love tomatoes and red onions, so the domasalata was absolutely perfect for me. If you take a little slice of the saganaki, and eat it with the domasalata, it is AWESOME. The stars of the night were definitely the lamb kokkinisto and the moussaka. At this point, my buddy was just about full from our salad and cheese and I basically (all 5'3 120 pounds of me) devoured the two remaining dishes on my own. I literally could not stop eating. The lamb in the tomato sauce was braised so wonderfully that the tender pieces of meat fell off the bone. A spoonful of this and the spinach rice it came with was heaven in my mouth. The moussaka was a perfect eggplant, bechamel and ground beef casserole. It had just the right amount of cinnamon to lure you with its aroma and trap you with its subtle flavor. And the potatoes that came with both dishes had enough starch to absorb and balance out the sauces. To this very day, I Yelp ""kokkinisto"" in every city I visit and so far, have found nothing. I craved the moussaka so much, I ended up making my own at home. If you haven't had lamb kokkinisto, and you're in Chicago, I highly recommend this place.

We started off with the famous flaming saganaki cheese (you know the one they light on fire and say opa!)  It came in two slices, so we each helped ourselves to one.  One squirt of a lemon slice and it was perfect! Our 2nd course was cup of Avgolemono soup each.  The amount of lemon they put in is inconstant between visits -- so slowly add more lemon till it meets your  tastes.  I prefer a very lemony taste so i squeezed all the juices of a very juicy slice into my soup and added a little pepper.  It was perfect!  I could probably do just a big bowl for a meal and be happy.  Boyfriend loves tons of pepper in his! For our main course we both went with lamb dishes.  It was recommended that I get the Arni Fournou, which is a basic traditional greek dish.  It's a roasted lamb with the most delicious potatoes!  The lamb seriously just fell off the bone!  We also got one of the Monday specials, which was the Rosa Maria.  It was basically the same as the above but with a tomato sauce and orzo pasta instead of potatoes. One thing I did notice -- the service got friendly once the waiter (who was Greek) realized my boyfriend knew what he was doing.  All in all it was a great meal and I can't wait to be back in Chicago to explore the menu.",0.9869,0.893,0.099,0.008,0.4500000000000001

Taste-wise: it wasn't anything amazing but the novelty of cheeseonfire was fun, but just one time.  2. Gyros: had a really game-y lamb taste :/ the portions were large and generous but to me, it tasted quite similar to Mr. Greek Gyros, so this was kind of a disappointment.  3. Butterfly lamb: Deliciously marinated! But for the price, it should taste pretty good.  4. Lamb Meatballs: Absolutely horrid. It was the most game-y of all of the lamb and poorly made.

It seriously must have been a fire hazard to have so many tables so close to each other. I could barely get into my seat because of the table behind us. Speaking of fire, you can't get Greek food without getting saganaki so we did that. While I wasn't set on fire by the flaming cheese, our server did squirt lemon juice into my eye. It was one of those situations where a simple ""sorry about that"" would have sufficed, but instead he said ""well, what did you expect?"" I wasn't too thrilled about that, naturally. The food was pretty average. I did like that you could order a combination plate (with a little of everything) or create your own combo by picking smaller portions of select items. I enjoyed the moussaka, but it wasn't anything to write home about. Around the table, there were no complaints about our food, but there also were no ""wow, this is fantastic"" comments.  As far as the decor goes, I'm really not a fan of Vegas buffet/Disney-esque decor (read: super theme-y, almost cheesy). I probably will not be returning, but I would definitely have enjoyed my experience more if I were a child.

However, I'm not sure whether or not I ordered the wrong things or I came in at the wrong time of day, or I just caught them on an off day, but I left the restaurant feeling disappointed. I went here with my girlfriend the other day for lunch as a way to kickoff a day in the city. We were among the first diners in the restaurant. The ambience of the restaurant was lovely; everything was bright and open, and the artwork on the walls was nice, but not distracting. The service was fine, neither good enough to blow me away nor bad enough to complain. The waiter swung by occasionally asking if we needed anything, but otherwise mostly let us eat in peace (which is the way I like it, frankly). Unfortunately, the food we received was inconsistent at best. My girlfriend and I started with an order of their seafood croquettes. Now, I make salmon croquettes at home, and I was expecting something very different from what we got. We received a plate with meatballs (fishballs?) that appeared to be made out of ground lamb; they looked so unlike seafood that I had to double-check that we ordered the right thing. They seemed to have the consistency of ground lamb and had very little flavor. The horseradish sauce we got with them did absolutely nothing to improve the taste of the appetizer, as there was next-to-no spice to it. For our entrees, my girlfriend ordered the Bekri Meze, while I got the Mediterranean Sea Bass (note: I asked for my fish to be fileted, as I didn't want to have to pick out the bones myself). Her dish was delicious, and my fish was light and tasty, but I ended up making a small pile of bones on one side of my plate. Overall, this restaurant should have been better than what I experienced. I feel like I may have to go back on a different day, possibly during dinner service, to really see what this restaurant has to offer.

The waiter said not a problem, when the bill came, he charged me for 2 full entrees! When I asked him about it, he said he would remove one of them , but then he charged my credit card with only a $3 discount and blamed it on the manager. Of course I took the difference out of his tip. I should have returned the dish to begin with, the steak kabob was flavorLESS and overcooked to be very dry, so being overcharged just made it that much worse.

Small and large, chic and plain, you won't starve in Greektown. It's probably been 25 years since I was last at the Greek Islands. The place has not changed too much, maybe updated a little. We started with an appetizer of grilled octopus. I've had squid before, but I don't remember ever having Octopus until now. It was really very good - mild tasting with a consistency almost of chicken. There was no fishy taste at all - it was very fresh. For dinner I had Chicken Riganati, a typical Greek chicken dish baked in olive oil and spices, with rice and Greek potatoes. There was 1/2 chicken, and it was a pretty good size. I'm pleased to say I ate all of the chicken, but didn't do too much damage on the side dishes. Everyone else's dinner was great - Kerrie had a Gyro platter, Jon had grilled squid and Sarah (the birthday girl) had Grecian Sea Bass. We were offered dessert, but had plans to go elsewhere.

We did not order desserts or coffee but, as said, our waiter was pleasant and brought us our bill in timely fashion.  I would return, yes, if dragged, but Athena's typically been much better.",0.9907,0.762,0.198,0.04,0.6163388543823327

2013-07-23,1.0,"The food is great. No complaints there. But, we all know that dining out isn't JUST about good food.  It has everything to do with service, too.This is where The Greek Islands is seriously lacking.  My husband and I have been there three times.  We experienced rude service every time.  But, this last visit was the last straw. Note to restaurants: Don't mess with a YELPER. I'm afraid they have gotten too big for their britches.  The ego from our waiter was about as foul smelling as their flaming cheese dish. Again, I know I am high-maintence with the special orders.  I make sure to be kind and patient with the server and I ask nicely when I want something.  Just because I'm OCD doesn't mean that I'm a demanding diva. At any rate, our server wasn't too happy with questions and when another table guest didn't get his food prepared right, there was an attitude from our server when he wanted to send it back.  Bad, move, Mister Greek Islands Server.  (I won't name names, because I'm not that cruel.)   The thing that really bothered me was while we were still eating, the servers were trying to take plates away...rushing us.  It seemed like they were pushing us out the door as soon as we were done eating.  Totally RUDE. We wanted to enjoy a cup of coffee and the server seemed pissed that our stomachs couldn't handle dessert. Well, excuse us!   After we were finished, the staff  hovered like those buzzards in the desert waiting for their prey to die.  And, we got a few 'death looks' as well because we didn't leave right away.  (I'll have to admit, part of us sticking around was out of defiance for their RUDENESS.)    Needless to say, Greek town is SATURATED with GREEK restaurants.  Who needs to deal with egos like that?  If you're only interest is eating good food, this place will satisfy your belly. If you have the audacity to want to be treated with respect, and if you desire to enjoy your meal without feeling pressured into stuffing your face so you can give Greek Islands an extra few bucks...then, sorry.  This place isn't for you.   The cheese isn't the only thing that stinks in The Greek Islands.",0.6253,0.76,0.129,0.111,0.48441250483933423

Food = 3.5 Service = 2 Free valet was a plus - the guys were nice I came here with 2 other girls. Since we wanted to try different items on the menu, we opted to order more smaller combo plates and share. 1st, we were thinking of getting a wine bottle. The older waiter we had didn't seem to provide much help in describing anything. His understanding of English wasn't the best. after looking at the wine list, nothing caught our eye. As we were more hungry, we went straight for food. This was looked down upon by our waiter. he kept insisting we get a wine bottle but I had to firmly say no we just want food.  I tried to ask about portion sizes from the combo plates vs the appetizer. The waiter was a bit reluctant to answer. I happened to order the combo 1st and then appetizers and the waiter seemed a bit frustrated. He wanted to know if we wanted the appetizers 1st. I told him we don't mind either way and he can bring it out as it comes. He didn't like this response. he said can't do that and he must serve the appetizers 1st. In his eyes we ordered 5 appetizers and 1 dish. Since I realized he wasn't very understanding and was set in his ways, we (the customers) has to accommodate to how he was meant to serve. I just didn't want to deal with his frustration. after ordering, he made a comment that we must not be very hungry since we didn't order many dishes. Ultimately we ordered the following: appetizers: Flaming Saganaki Cheese - my friend was annoyed that this came out when she stepped away to the bathroom. The waiter served this flaming with cheese and the sight is part of the experience. I understood her bitterness. it was tasty otherwise. Gyro - very good.  Dolmades - the grape leaves never came out. we assumed this was coming out later. If not, we hoped we wont be charged for it.  Spinach Cheese Pie - not good for me...very bland then our table was cleared for the ""main"" dish. Mousaka and roast led of lamb combo - This plate was brought to us with an attitude as if ""see I told you this is small."" after our appetizers we were full anyway. lamb was very good. Mousaka was bland for me.   The bread basket was very dry.  This restaurant tried to provide a white-table-service which I understand they were set their operations and the older waiter couldn't figure out how to do things otherwise.  The check comes out I put my card down. The restaurant ran it through quickly. Partially it was my fault, I checked the bill a little too late and realized they charged me for the grapes leaves that never came out. All our head drooped as we just didn't want to deal with the waiter as we realized this. As the delegate of the group, I told the waiter what happened. he asked if we still wanted the grape leaves, and we said no. He was reluctant to talk to the manager and kept talking to me that the card is charged now and i should've told him sooner...blah blah blah. I had to be firm and insisted he deal with correcting the charge with the manager. he came back with 2 different receipts to sign. he said that the higher charge will be voided and it will take some time to show up. My credit card bill still shows the higher charge.",0.7218,0.85,0.08,0.069,0.47522486772486777

We started with the chickpea app, and while I wasn't expecting hummus, this blob of bland was like noshing on papier mache paste. My friend had the kotopita (chicken in phyllo) which was enormous but granite-heavy and flavorless. My gyro was disappointing. It seemed to have been trimmed from the spit long ago in a faraway land.

Came out fast enough and we headed home to eat.  Food was decent and plentiful.  Rice is tasty.   I'm giving it 3 stars because: 1.

The only time we saw our server was when he took our order. Other than that, we saw him pass by multiple times and never stopped to see how we were doing or even a ""I'll be right with you"" type of thing. This happened to the other tables too, as one guy had to  raise his voice to get the waiter's attention as he sped away. Eventually, another waiter saw us looking around for our waiter and he did the job and took care of the rest of our night. Our original waiter only came back to give us our check. I think that our night was just an off night and not a usual indication of the restaurant, as I hear nothing but good stuff. The rest of the staff (hostess, front desk, bus boys) were very friendly and efficient. I appreciated that my water was always filled, especially since I drink a lot of water. Also, our table was constantly cleared. We had the calamari to start. It was good, lightly battered and squid was perfectly warm and cooked. Just didn't understand why a nice restaurant like this would serve their cocktail sauce in plastic ""to-go"" containers. Seemed to downgrade the meal and the restaurant,  but taste was good. Had a combo of the vegetarian mousaka and white chicken riganati. The mousaka tasted traditional and loved the texture. However, it could have used more flavor of some sort. When cutting into the riganati, the chicken instantly fell off its bones. Flavor was very nice and slightly tangy. However, parts were rather dry. Portions were very decent and even substantial. Boyfriend had the Mediterranean chicken breast which was the highlight of the night. Robust flavor and very tender chicken. Finished the night off with tiramisu. Probably one of the best I had, and I don't even like tiramisu. Coffee flavor was very present, but not too sweet. The cream was light and airy. All of our dishes came in a very timely manner. Would like to give this place another shot but definitely not in a hurry, especially after our horrible server. He may have been occupied with other tables on the other side of the restaurant, but in that case if it was that busy, there were numerous waiters just hanging out by the bar that could have helped.

Now, I'm not going to say that Greek Islands is over rated, but it does NOT serve the ""best Greek food in the world"", or even in the US.  Certainly, however, the food and dining experience is excellent.  We've eaten here several times and our meals have always been outstanding. The decor, particularly the entrance (think: Greek fishing village) is kinda cool.    The service was very good.  However, let me warn you that if your waiter is from Greece, and you order hummus, you might get an earful.  My wife ordered hummus,  and he said: ""We don't have hummus at REAL Greek restaurants.""   Take it easy, Yanni, I'm Greek, too, OK?     Instead, order ""Fava,"" a similar, interesting, but slightly different dish also prepared from chick peas.  (Hummus is better, IMO.) My wife and son loved the grilled octopus and thought it was the best ever.  (I, although of Greek decent, just can't bring myself to eat cephalopod, or any other invertebrate, for that matter).  My daughter and I loved the grape leaves covered with thick, but mild, lemon sauce. I ordered pastitsio, and was satisfied, BUT not overwhelmed.  Given my elevated expectations, I would say I was a little disappointed; it was a little under-flavored.  I would still, however, rate the pastitsio as ""above average."" The wife ordered lamb chops and moose caca.  She, who is Greek only by osmosis, thought her food, particularly the moussaka, was fantastic.    Overall, this place is great and definitely worth a visit.",0.9978,0.732,0.249,0.02,0.44177536231884057

It seems a little more genuinely welcoming here, the waiters are reserved but not aloof, efficient but not brusque. They made sure all our questions were answered, and were attentive and polite. The menu overflows with traditional favorites, and the wine list is compact but just fine. We had an appetizer of lima beans in tomato sauce that could not have been better: tender beans, nicely seasoned sauce.

The attendants are super nice, and even hold open the door for you. He definitely earned a big tip from me. The decor is awesome. The place is very rustic and there's tons of tables as to minimize the wait. When we got there, there was only one person at the front desk (and he was on the phone). We had to wait for a few minutes while he was done, but it wasn't a problem. We got seated right away. It was a few minutes until our waiter came to our table, but he apologized for the wait.  He remained very attentive throughout the dinner, and never let our water get half empty. Plus, the fact that they clean the tables with a scraper between every course is super cool. The busboy was a little too eager to take our plates between each course, however. They serve you bread and butter right away. There's olive oil on every table, which is a good touch. I wish the bread came in smaller, softer pieces. After it had sat out for a few minutes, it became very tough to chew and break.  First, we ordered the saganaki and the greek salad. There's no way you can come here without getting the saganaki. It's a piece of haloumi cheese doused in some alcohol, and lit on fire to make the cheese melty and crispy. They squeeze some lemon on it after. I could eat this for the rest of my life, it was that delicious. The salad was good too. Definitely needed more veggies. However, they olives were excellent, and the large chunks of feta were creamy and delicious. The boy and I each did a combo meal. I ordered the vegetarian moussaka and the spinach cheese pie. Both were excellent. There could have been a tad bit more seasoning, but it was still great.  The moussaka had an assortment of tender vegetables, like eggplant, and had a layer of creamy potato baked on top. The pie had a layer of flaky phyllo, covering a decadent mixture of spinach and feta. I absolutely love the feta here, and they left it in sizable chunks in the inside. The potato cooked in olive oil and lemon that accompanied the meal was also excellent. The boy ordered the stuffed peppers and the leg of lamb. There were only a few slices of lamb and it seemed kind of scant, but he said it was delicious nonetheless.

Although there were a few casualties along the way, I would say that overall, it was a success! When we arrived, we utilized the FREE valet service...did I mention it was FO FREE? Sucha nice touch especially because parking in Greektown can be a pain in the ass, make that an expensive pain in the ass. After entering the restaurant, we were greeted by a group of staff at the front of the restaurant, who were enthusiastic and made us feel very comfortable.  The interior of the restaurant is amazing...I haven't been to Greece, yet...but dining here was as if I was sitting in a cafe in Mykonos...or what I would imagine would be Mykonos...but I digress. Moving onto the food...We decided to go with the family style meal, which consists of gyro, saganaki (flaming cheese), and a Greek spread (we chose taramosalata, which is like Greek caviar made from cod roe, onions, potatoes and olive oil), Athenian salad, four different entrees (we chose chicken riganati, moussaka, spanakotiropita, kontosouvli a side dish (we chose potatoes and rice) and a sample of desserts (baklava, galaktoburiko, karidopita) and coffee. It's a sh!t ton of food, but it's a great chance to get a sample of everything. My friend's liked most of the food surprisingly because they can be really picky when it comes to food. They only items that they weren't quite fans of were the gyro and taramosalata. However, I thought everything tasted great. Our server started us off with some complimentary bread. Then came our apps. The saganaki was quite a spectacle. The cheese was salty and gooey. The chicken riganati was so flavorful and fall-off-the-bone tender. The moussaka was really good - I love any type of meat, eggplant and cream sauces so this was a no brainer. We were beginning to feel stuffed while we were in the middle of our entrees, but our server said we wouldn't get dessert if we didn't finish...haha. So...we finished and although we were full, made room for dessert - duh! The desserts were great, especially the baklava and the galaktoburiko. I could tell from the start that customer service is top priority here! The staff is incredibly attentive...my never water was half empty before a bus boy would refill it. Additionally, our server did a great job checking in on us without being overbearing. Overall, I would definitely return to Greek Islands in a heart beat for the amazing food and customer service albeit maybe not for the family style meal...there was too much food haha...but I did have leftovers for a while!",0.9967,0.818,0.154,0.028,0.5059259259259259

Dinner.  7:30pm on a Wednesday night.  The absolute gargantuan Greek Islands is packed to the gills with patrons and there's a 20 minute wait.  WHOA.  And when I say gargantuan, I mean HUGE.  So many tables.  The restaurant is a massive maze of little rooms, nooks, crannies, staircases leading to higher seating, and probably some other table locations that I didn't see on the trip to my table.  I could get lost here.  And since it's SO huge, having a wait is kind of a feat! So we get seated.  We immediately notice a family style meal where, like, $20 a person, you get a plate of gyros, saganaki and your choice of taramosalata, melitzanosalata or scordalia to start, then an Athenian salad, then your choice of four of the following: Sliced Roast Leg of Lamb, Pastichio, Mousaka, Vegeterian Mousaka, Dolmades, Chicken Riganati, Spanakotiropita (Spinach Pie), Keftedes (meatballs) and Kontosouvli (pork on the spit).  Served with that is your choice of rice and potatoes or veggies and then a full dessert of Baklava, Galaktoburiko and Karidopita.  It's BONKERS.  This is on top of the complimentary bread, which does deserve a mention because it's awesome and covered in sesame seeds. So the food was really great.  I wish the saganaki was a little crispier and I just wasn't down with the dolmades, but the spinach pie and pork on the spit really shined.  Because it's spinning around on the open flame, the pork is nice and crispy and just awesome.  The spinach pie was super lux with mounds of spinach and feta tucked into the flaky pastry dough.  Mmmmm!   Where Greek Islands falls short is service.  Yes, our guy was certainly there, but since Greek Islands is so huge, it's sort of a churn and burn place where timing isn't really important so much as cranking the food out as quickly as possible.  It doesn't make for a romantic or relaxing dinner at all when the staff seems constantly harried.  We got our apps before our wine (which was supposed to be a pinot noir, but was pinot grigio), we had to ask twice for bread refills (don't judge) and everything felt very rushed.   But like I said, if you want to just stuff your face with yummy grub, this is the spot to do it!  But a sexy date spot?  Neg.",0.9975,0.806,0.171,0.023,0.6041147014361301

As for the food, it was nothing special, but admittedly not horrible.  The saganaki was not even melted (presumably, leaving it over the heat for an extra minute would cut too much into their bottom line).  The skordalia barely had any garlic and the texture was pasty, as if it had been overprocessed.  The entrees were okay, and the grilled octopus was very tender.  Their roast lamb is completely overcooked...we're talking gray/brown and dried out all the way through.  Dessert was awful (galaktobouriko and rice pudding). With so many other options in Greektown, there's no excuse to spend your money here.  Try Santorini right across the street, also with free valet parking.",0.9186,0.821,0.112,0.067,0.5244104308390022
2012-07-27,4.0,"It's rather remarkable that I am just getting around to reviewing a place I've frequented since I first moved to Chicago, when it was located on Jackson Boulevard, and where since that time, I have probably been to the place more often than any other restaurant in town. From the office outings when we drank in excess at lunch to the times here with countless visitors to the city, Greek Island has delivered every time. This time I was with my favorite Texans, The Fernando Gang. I love Mediterranean food best of all, and the menu here offers some very fresh and flavorful choices. Some of my favorites are the Horiatiki or country salad (sans lettuce,) the Spinach Pie, the Avgolemono Soup, the Gyros, the Fried Cod with Skordalia, any of the Seafood kebabs, and of course the lusciously mushy Moussaka and Pastitsio dishes. Cannot forget the Saganaki, either. And I love the make-your-own- combo option with smaller plates at half price. Some of the menu items, especially the specials have gotten a bit pricey, but the standard Greek favorites are still around $12.95-15.95. Such as the combo platter of lamb, moussaka, stuffed grape leave and meatballs, We indulged in Saganaki, Spinach Pie, a couple of combo platters including the Veggie Combo, which got kind of a ""meh"" review. A whole Bass arrived with the head and tail and was filleted a table by our very efficient and enthusiastic server. The fish was good and moist, but had an odd kind of inky flavor. Perhaps it's supposes to. Sharing of a creme caramel and baklava really blew us all away. Both were the best we'd ever tasted. No coffee for us. Fernie and I washed this down with our fine and well-chilled Greek beer. The thing which always has amazed me here is how quickly they get everything out of the kitchen when they have as many tables and rooms as they do. There has never been a time here, in spite of the always frenetic and crowded environs, when I have experienced either slow or bad service, or felt as if I was being rushed through my meal. And in spite of my old curmudgeon-like disdain for big crowds, I find it stimulating and fun to eat here. Actually, the people-watching is a large part of the Greek Islands experience. So that, the Mediterranean fare, the memories of meals and celebrations past, will always bring me back here at least every couple of years.

The restaurant itself is very attractive, and the decor is very nice.  There was a queue waiting to get in, but being alone I was able to get a table right away.  This is where it started to go downhill. The dining room was noisy to the point of distraction, so it wouldn't be a good choice for a first date IMO.  The service was efficient but mechanical - not unfriendly but not welcoming either.  I ordered an app of dolmades, which appeared within 2 minutes of ordering.  They were nice and hot, but the grape leaves had lost their ""tang""; so I think they had been sitting there for awhile and probably nuked in a microwave.  They also provided a small basket of bread, which was so chewy it gave my teeth a workout (and I have strong teeth, but this was a challenge) For an entree I selected the special of Lamb a la Garden - which appeared to be bone in lamb with vegetables and sauce.  LOTS of sauce - so much it pretty much drowned everything on the plate.  The lamb itself was very tender, but had no flavor.  The vegetables were overcooked and somewhat mushy - except for the carrots which were good. Overall I was disappointed.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing - many of the dishes passing my table looked much better than what I had.  But I'm not going back given the tons of other Greek restaurants in the area.",0.9183,0.765,0.138,0.097,0.5335796387520525

Grilled octopus - succulent, tender. Pairs well with the olive oil and balsamic vinegrette base. Entree: Combo roast leg of lamb & roast loin of lamb - great with rice & potatoes. Found the leg of lamb much better than the loin. Loin was gamey and flavorless. Wonderful food, but a bit on the pricey side for lunch. Didn't find the portions enormous like the server suggested.

Started with some inexpensive red wine, and enjoyed the Mediterranean-esque atmosphere and authentically Greek servers.  The menu is huge, and family style seemed like a great way to try several things without having to make a tough decision.  You probably think that two people ordering family style would get less food than four people ordering family style.  Ha!  ha ha!  You'd like to think that!  Oh no, sir. For $20 each, we got the following: Gyros, saganaki, and the dip of our choice.  The gyro plate was big enough to be an entree in and of itself.  Full portion of saganaki.  The taramosalata is pink and looks weird but man, is it delicious.  Everything is wonderful.  And we look at each other and say ""Oh crap.  We're getting full.  And we're just getting started.""  Next came a sizeable Greek salad - still seemed to generally be a ""side portion."" But with the cheese and olives, it wasn't exactly light.  The situation was getting dire. Then we got a plate with FOUR entrees on it - fortunately not a full portion of each (which I truly expected).  Still, the plate was huge.  By this point, if you can take more than a few bites, I admire you.  Leg of lamb was great, dolmades were okay but not my favorite, meatballs were juicy, spinach pie was good but honestly - at this point - I can barely report on the quality of food.  It was so freaking much. We told the waiter we were full and just wanted coffee and baklava (it's supposed to be baklava and TWO OTHER DESSERTS EACH).  We thought this was moderation, but the piece of baklava was maaaaassive!  Like a piece of pie!  Seriously, if you want to crack up a foreigner, bring them here.  The amount of food is hilarious.  For $20 each you can feed a hungry Greek army.  But bring home the leftovers and eat a whole other day's worth of food!  The servers will laugh at you for ordering it all but you get the last laugh for eating so much deliciousness for cheap!",0.9949,0.761,0.177,0.062,0.48223270440251587

Being in Greek Islands and seeing that damn sesame bread brought up mixed emotions, and true to form, the restaurant delivered mixed results. I should start by saying that the sesame bread here is better than the kind I had in Greece. It was soft and fluffy and tasted great with olive oil and pepper. I ate like 5 pieces, hypocritically. The flaming saganaki and the cold calamari and shrimp were excellent appetizers. The cheese was hot and caramelized from the flames and the seafood was very fresh. In terms of entrees, the spanokopita was lackluster. It was made in a large pan and sliced to order so the pastry became somewhat soggy and cold. The leg of lamb also fell short; it didn't have enough moisture or spice to counter the fact that it was really. freaking. gamey. On the other hand, the moussaka and grape leaves were great, and many other items on the menu looked enticing (alas, my stomach was only so big).

We arrived around 10:45 ish late on a Thursday night and the place was a little less than half full with a full table of about 10 people celebrating a birthday, couples- old and young and plenty of Greeks (always a good sign in my opinion).  Upon seating, you get the traditional olive oil and bread to nibble on. (We didn't nibbled, we gobbled.) We ordered the Saganaki (flaming cheese) and it came before I knew it and shocked the crap out of me. In the corner of my eye, all I see is a big fire. I thought I was having a Michael Jackson moment before I realized what was going on.  The firestarter said ""Opa!"", squeezed some fresh lemon juice over the firey cheese and was gone.  Anyway, we ate our hot cheese with the bread & olive oil. Yum.  The Saganaki cheese reminded me of mozzarella but not as smooth. Its also NOT a crumbly cheese just in case you were wondering. For dinner I ordered from the ""Create A Combo"" side and got the Spinach & Cheese Pie and the Roast Leg of Lamb. The lamb was tender and juicy, great cuts. The spinach pie was good as well but not enough filo pastry for my liking and it was a bit soggy. I usually order these things for the flaky filo pastry experience but there was plenty 'nuff spinach and cheese to eat.  I had some of my date's gyro and it was the best gyro meat I've ever had. Hands down. Seasoned just right, tender and not dry at all. The cucumber sauce was perfect as well.  Next time I go, I am ordering the gyro plate. Also, they give you enough food to feed 2 people. We both took food home and for some reason it all tasted better the next day. We drank one small bottle (1/2 liter) of Malamatina Retsina. This is a dry white wine. My date enjoyed but but I didn't like the after taste. Granted I am used to reds and a sweeter, fruitier wine. My taste buds told me I was drinking Riesling with a tainch of Lysol but that's just my palate . We didn't get dessert because no one was in the mood for it. The wait staff were very quick and clean.

For me though they have set the standard for delicious gyros, saganaki, fried-zucchini (no where else comes close) and my absolute favorite for keeping vampires (or anyone that smells your breath) away - a healthy dose of skordalia.  My latest trip was after that fateful Bulls game that injured Derek Rose and set the stage for our disappointing first round exit. It was a saturday afternoon game so we just went down Madison st post game and grabbed a table to eat and drink away the sadness (and this was after a victory). We ordered everything off my wish list to start, and Erica tried the vegetable kabob. I love the flaming cheese that they do at the table, and I introduced the rest of the table to the joys of skordalia topped fried zucchini.     I honestly couldn't tell you if the rest of the menu is any good because I haven't  ventured far from my favorites. But judging from the rest of my table, and every other packed table in the restaurant it's probably a good bet everything is very good. There's an added bonus when you get the check because I can't remember any meal surprising to the upside. Value is very good. If you haven't been to Greektown yet I'd try and change that, and Greek Islands is a great place to start.",0.9961,0.736,0.211,0.054,0.5583006535947713

2012-05-16,4.0,"Wish I was born Greek, although this is the next best thing.  I practically live here I'm here so damn often. Tomato salad and lemon soup is the first thing I order(they have their tomatoes imported) Then I ask for the good bread without the poppy seeds. Then saganaki cheese( its supposed to be salty fellow yelpers)  And on with the lamb which is great, my mom swears the lamb riblets are the best but I prefer the loin or any other soft cut of the lamb. My dad usually orders the sea bass, and the waiter even makes fun of him that he eats like a French man because he eats with a fork, so now my dad eats with his hands like a Greek? Who knew??? Haha hilarious servers they have here.  Which reminds me  The servers are always around the table and sometimes creepily stare but I think it's kind of funny and stare at them back, but they mean no harm or aren't ogling you, they just are waiting to refill your water glass( is it possible to refill a glass too much?) and they clear the plates on the table constantly which is great but again a little weird if your not used to the place like the regulars are. It might seem bothersome but hey if you don't like good service go somewhere else.   Almost forgot to mention that even though serious fatties like my family of chocoholics   don't consider yogurt a desert, it's sooo good here you'll reconsider. Get it with honey and walnuts! I've had a Greek grandmother make me yogurt and hopefully she doesn't kill me when I say this but the truth is the truth and it was much better here. Sorry grams.. One more thing, they've had their occasional bad day where the taste is off, and it's not as good, but they  are pretty consistent day to day . If you experienced an off day by chance- sucks for you!

2011-12-26,5.0,"Being greek and loving food, when it comes to greek restaurants Its one of the few times I can call myself a connoisseur.  What stood out here, was the menu, I couldn't find a single recipe that you wouldn't find in a quality traditional greek restaurant, making this one of the few non rip-off restaurants claiming to have greek cuisine, whilst also having a great range of tastes. The decor (non-trashy), environment, wine list and even the staff where 100% greek. I really thought I was back home for a second. What really surprised me though, was the that the dishes surpassed my expectations, they where greater in quality, freshness and taste than most restaurants in Greece! It matched dishes you've only tasted from Greek grandmas! Apparently the owner goes to Greece twice a year, to further improve his cooking skills and update the dishes.  As if this wasn't enough, the price was one third of what you'd pay in Greece. $20-30 per person!

2011-12-22,4.0,"One of my favorite Greek Restaurants.  I have been to Greek Islands on several occasions (work related functions, date with the husband, and family birthday dinners). Every experience has been a good one thus far.  To start with, free valet parking is always convenient.   Secondly, the dishes are pretty delicious. The family style dinner is exquisite, starting from the chicken to the dessert at the end.  I've had their chicken panini, very yummy.  The service is fabulous, and the decor is appealing.  I have sat in various spots within the restaurant and have been content.  There is a family style place right by the bar, and it is perfect for large groups.  I have sat in the busier sections (also ok) and up the little stairs.  Even when it is crowded it is pretty cozy.  I really do like Greek Islands and enjoy coming here at least once or twice a year.   On a side note, I was here recently for a holiday meeting and it was more packed than ever. However, the valet attendants were super quick. I was astonished at how fast they took my car (although there was a line) and how quick they were to get my car after lunch.   If you are looking for a delicious dinner or lunch and you are in Greek town, I would highly recommend Greek Islands.",0.9942,0.791,0.209,0.0,0.5367738095238096
2011-12-22,4.0,"It's the most iconic restaurant in Greek town, and in my opinion, it deserves its place at the top of the pile. For one, it's a huge place so it's great for going in big groups.  Even when you go with a smaller group, though, the service is efficient and the food always comes out fresh.  Greek Islands has a huge throughput advantage, and I think it capitalizes on that with consistent food that's reasonably priced and served quickly. Not everything is great, and some items can be lousy, but if you know what to order, you can do well every time.  For me, the highlights are the grilled octopus and the fried zucchini with skordalia.  The octopus is tender and nicely charred and doused in peppery olive oil and vinegar.  It's one of the top renditions in the city, definitely taking advantage of the fact that they're serving way more octopus than probably anywhere in chicagoland.  The zucchini is remarkably sweet and almost nutty.  It's sliced thin, lightly breaded, and fried quickly so that it always comes out crisp and never greasy.  The skordalia is a creamy potato garlic spread that really packs a garlic punch.   I also enjoy the gyros and the taramosalata.  The gyros are standard issue Greek-American diner food, but the version at Greek Islands is consistently well-charred and served with lots of raw onions and a buttery pita.  The taramosalata is made from fish eggs, and while it has a nice briney flavor, it doesn't quite remind you of the sea the way a great rendition would.  But it's the best version I've found in Chicagoland.  Also, I should mention that they have some nice stewed lamb preparations that are full flavored and fall-off-the-bone tender. Sure, not everything is as good as those dishes, but I don't go frequently enough to really crave new dishes to add to the repertoire.  It has a bustling atmosphere, large portions at a good price, and consistent food that scratches the itch whenever it comes up.",0.9957,0.799,0.183,0.018,0.5066713533380199

However the wait staff seemed somewhat oafish.  The staff obsessively came by to remove plates, as soon as there might be a possibility of removing the plate- it was gone.  The rather irksome thing is with the beverages. The prices charged are more than what appear on the menu by maybe 30 cents- big deal.

We ordered the flaming cheese appetizer, which is legit just a slab of cheese, but for some reason I really liked it since I'm generally not a huge cheese person. I'm actually surprised this is such a popular appetizer, because it seems like one of those things that might not be some people's cup of tea. For my entree, I ordered dark meat half chicken riganati. The chicken was falling off the bone, and the sauce was perfect. I really loved it and i would probably order the same thing if I came back. My friend ordered gyros and I kept sneaking pieces of his gyro meat -- I think I literally ate half of his plate of food. The service was wonderful.

2011-11-06,5.0,"Malnati's Pizza, Vienna Beef hot dogs... to me, Greek Islands is part of the quintessential Chicago experience. Normally I talk about a single amazing experience at a restaurant but at this one there are too many great ones to even recall them all. First thing to note? The free valet parking. Yes, free. Pull up your car, hand the fine man your keys, and enter a world of baby blue and white; stuccoed walls and stone tiled floors; jovial people eating enormous, delicious meals. Any great meal at Greek Islands begins with a basket of Italian and Greek bread (the latter is sprinkled with sesame seeds) doused with their phenomenal olive oil. Follow that with an appetizer of saganaki, that Greek grilling cheese doused with liquor, set on fire, and topped with lemon juice. Tangy, crispy on the inside and melty within, it's the perfect (and theatrical! And impressive!) way to start off an awesome meal at this West Loop classic. Menu highlights include their seafood dishes-- I love the grilled octopus-- and classic Greek specialties. In particular, I adore their rendition of gyros and the moussaka, the Greek nod to eggplant parmesan with layers of roasted eggplant and potatoes sandwiched between subtly spiced ground beef, sweet tomato sauce, salty cheese, and creamy bechemel.  Finish your meal with a strong cup of Greek coffee and the Greek Islands Special, a sinfully delicious concoction of phyllo topped with nuts and soaked in honey and rosewater, scredded phyllo, citrusy custard, and whipped cream. Affordable and quick but completely delicious, Greek Islands is an outstanding place for a work lunch, date, or even huge party.",0.9985,0.697,0.286,0.018,0.46691017316017314

Anyway, within a couple of mins we got our saganaki, and there was no flame or anything, it was like he lit a candle and mumbled an 'opa!'

All of the fish dishes were very overcooked and underseasoned. I'm a starving pregnant lady and craved fish that day so that sucked. The veggie side that came with the entrees was a mushy overcooked ratatouille. Maybe we ordered the wrong things and should have stuck with greek classics like moussaka or something.  The server kept running away after asking us if we wanted something, so it took like three speedy visits for him to actually take our order even though we were ready. It was weird.

Flaming cheese is really just for the fun of the show.  The actual product is not all that tasty, more like seared mozzarella that's a lot cheesier-smelling. Gyros are a MUST-TRY.  They do a great job with slicing the meat very thin and searing it just right to an almost crisp texture. Grilled octopus was tender, though not particularly interesting in taste.  We were hoping to get baby octopus, but they were out. Dandelion greens are an acquired taste as they are quite bitter, but we really enjoyed getting some cooked greens in our system. Hot lima beans were decent - again, appreciated the addition of veggies in our diet after a lot of meat-bingeing, but it's not overly special.",0.9729,0.761,0.182,0.057,0.43634085213032586

No need for reservations, it's busy but they're ready for you. They dimmed the lights once we sat down, it suddenly got all romantic on us. What did we get though?? He got some beers, me some wine along with fried zucchini, saganaki cheese, gyro plate, a combo plate with mousaka and chicken riganati along with the greek island special for dessert.  I'm not a fan of cheese so for me the flaming saganaki cheese was okay. I only had two bites and for me it was a tad salty. We looooved the fried zucchini. It came thinly sliced, perfectly battered up and served with a garlicky mash on the side. It was perfect and delicious. I would come back here just for that. It's very tasty.   My mousaka was very good and my chicken was very tender, falling right off the bone. I didn't even need a knife. It comes with this very light tomato sauce and again- a touch too salty for me. I had the greek island special for dessert and wasn't too much of a fan. on top is a really good custard but on the bottom is honey and nuts-- the same sort of filling sometimes found in baklava. I hate baklava and I hate nuts. Mama don't play that. blech. I should have opted for a simple custard or tiramisu that's also on the menu.  All in all, it's a fun place for a meal with really wonderful service and good people watching. Drinks here are on the cheap. My glass of wine was 5 dollars, nice.

While the entrees are good (most things made with fish are excellent), I find it's best to treat Greek Islands as a small plates restaurant; order some saganaki, a couple of the dips (skordalia and taramosalata stand out), some other appetizers, maybe a big salad, and share. Service is laid-back yet very friendly, which I am a big fan of; I've had too many meals spoiled rotten by invasive servers. Valet parking is also clutch, as finding a spot in the area is typically a bloodbath.

2011-08-07,4.0,"Once again, it's time for the ""Fat American Can't Figure Out Foreign Cuisines"" show!  Today, we're returning to Greece - the Island regions in particular, because I've just been to the Greek Islands Restaurant for a lovely dinner! I had a relative from back home who sent me a notice that he'd be in town randomly and would like to have dinner with me and Char O. - when I asked what kind of food he was looking to have, he told me that people had been suggesting Greektown to him, so that's where he wanted to go.  Well, I know OF most of the staple restaurants in G-town, thanks to spending several years right near the Halsted bus line.  After much deliberation, I decided on this place, since I'd never been there before and it looked to have a better overall rating than the places I HAVE been to. I made a reservation for later that evening - they said it might be a few minutes of a wait when we got in, but it's better to have the reservation.  We met up right on time, and were shown to our tables straight away, so that was nice. I do have to mention, they for some reason try and upsell those bottled sodas - even though the fountain ones are cheaper and come with refills.  Be wary - get the fountain drinks.  They may not be too speedy about getting you those refills, but they exist and are free. Since we're obviously not Greek, and not experts on the food, I figured the best course of action would be for us all to do the ""Family-Style Dinners"" for two or more people.  My uncle opted for a ""Create a Combo"", but Char and I did the family-style. First out was the Saganaki - flaming cheese with a bit of an ""OPA!"" flare.  The three of us split everything appetizer-wise, and even my uncle (who claims not to really like Saganaki) said the cheese tasted really good.  With our meal, we had a choice of three food items I couldn't pronounce (Taramosalata, Melitzanosalata and Scordalia), so I glanced around the menu and quickly chose Taramosalata.  For those of you who, like me, have no clue what that is, it's ""Considered Greek caviar, this is a blend of cod roe with potatoes, onions and olive oil.""  Eaten on the free bread they brought to the table (since they didn't bring anything else with which to eat it), it was incredibly delicious.  I made the right choice. They also brought out Gyros, but only in the sense of a plate with slices of delicious meat with onions, and a plate with tzatziki.  I thought they would have brought out some pita bread or something.  We wound up just picking up meat slices, spreading some tzatziki on top and eating them just like that.  Felt weird, but tasted awesome nonetheless. We also were given a salad.  Which, as anyone who knows John Pinette will agree, is a promissory note that real food will soon arrive. Then came the main course, which is where I thought they faltered in their execution.  We got to pick four entrees and we chose Sliced Roast Lamb, Pastichio, Dolmades and Keftedes.  It comes with a side dish of rice pilaf and potato.  I figured it would be like everything else we'd gotten thus far - a lot of big plates that we can all share, family-style. What came to me and Char O. was one plate each with a lump of rice pilaf, a wedge of potato, 3 slices of lamb meat, one square slice of Pastichio (pasta/meat/cheese casserole), one piece of Dolmades (so one grape-leaf wrap with sauce) and one single Keftedes meatball. (Would that be a Dolmad and a Kefted?) The food itself was quite tasty, but when I order four entrees as part of my meal, that should NOT consist of one bite-sized portion (lookin' at you, meatball!) while everything else that was served was quite plentiful.  I suppose next time we could consider just ordering all of the items separately and getting multiple REAL entrees, though the price would be at least three times as much per person, so I guess we ""got what we paid for"". Oh yes, we also got a small plate of desserts.  We're not too huge on Greek desserts, since most of them are just combinations of phyllo, nuts and honey, but I have to admit that a stand-out winner on that plate was the Galaktoburiko - phyllo dough filled with a orange and lemon zest custard.  Truly wonderful. (We even wound up walking over to the Pan Hellenic bakery down the street to take home some huge portions of Galaktoburiko for later on.) All in all, it's a wonderful place.  We were visited many times by our server (and once by a manager) and everyone was very friendly to us and our horrible pronunciation of Greek food items.  I just recommend you grab one of the take-out menus on your way TO the table so that during the meal, you can remember what everything is called and what it all contains.  I have a feeling that if we ever have any more relatives who stop in and want to try out Greektown, this is the place we'll be bringing them.

I was craving some Gyros but didn't want to come to this restaurant and only get that.  So i got the combo dinner with the Gyro and the Chicken Riganati.  The Gyro meat was one of the best that I've had and the Chicken Riganati was so good.  It was juicy and flavorful.  I would go back to get just that.  My wife got the Dolmades.  She liked it but I wasn't a huge fan of the grape leaves...maybe I just don't know how to eat like a Greek.  Overall this is great place for affordable Greek food.",0.9869,0.796,0.176,0.028,0.460082304526749

So with that in mind, absolutely steer clear of this place if you're vegetarian and especially if you're a vegetarian who is allergic to nuts, like me.  The starters were taramosalata which I've never seen before and looks bizarrely like hummus but has fish in it so I couldn't eat it, dolmades, which have meat in them here for some reason and saganaki which was actually delicious.  There was Greek salad which didn't have actual mixed greens, just romaine/iceberg lettuce. And for the main course there was vegetarian mousaka, which was basically a lot of oily potatoes, chicken and gyros. I wouldn't say that I'm the absolute healthiest person on earth, but somehow cheese, iceberg lettuce and potatoes doesn't seem like the best thing for you. The people that did have the meat around me weren't too thrilled about it either. Oh and I can't forget the dessert that I couldn't have---cookies and baklava. Apparently even the cookies have nuts in them! I asked one of the managers if there was any dessert that didn't have nuts in it. He told me there was and I asked if I could sub that since I'm allergic. He said no. Bummer.  I'll never go back and I'll be sure to make sure the people I know stay away as well.

2011-05-09,4.0,"It's taken me almost 5 years of living in the city to finally try ANY restaurant in Greektown.  And having spent a good amount of time in Greece and really loving most Greek food, I knew my first trip needed to be a good one.  So I got the specific recommendation from a Greek coworker for this place and it's been mentally bookmarked ever since.  Last weekend, on a whim, the boyfriend and I were looking for a super late but quick lunch.  Why not FINALLY go to Greektown!?  Done and done.   This place definitely has that sort of forced old world look, but it doesn't feel chintzy or cheesy.  The service is fast, and it should be because there were about 47 waiters flitting about the place at 2:30pm.  Question: Why no women wait staff?  And while I appreciated the attention, perhaps I didn't need my water glass filled up after every sip.  But, not really a big deal.   Anyway, the boyfriend knew from the get-go that he was having a damned gyro.  No need for him to look at the menu.  But since I've been avoiding gluten lately, I needed to inspect the menu a little more.  A quick review let me to think that I should probably go the route of some small appetizers as opposed to the much bigger looking meals, since, you know, we would probably be eating dinner in a few hours anyway.   I love saganaki, but I'm usually hesitant to order it in the states because the whole ""OPA"" business is just not authentic, and I generally hate that they do that.  But the boyfriend had never tried it and I knew he would love it.  Ordered it, waiter brings it, lights it, but only casually says, ""Opa"".  Nice and subtle.  Awesome and delicious.  (BTW, I'm aware this little bit of info makes me sound like a pretentious douche, my sincere apologies, I'm really very nice.) Then the rest of my meal is made up of the big hot lima beans (I know you think you don't like lima beans, but you haven't had them until you've tried them Greek style in tomato sauce, I promise), cold beets with garlic sauce (to be avoided on a first date, but YUM!) and shrimp with tomatoes and feta (drool).   Between the gyro that the boyfriend ordered and what I thought were small appetizers, we had dinner for the evening as well.  I took home at least half of what I ordered.     I'll be back.",0.9837,0.805,0.129,0.067,0.5070402298850575

The calamari was okay nothing special, the appetizer potatoes with garlic were way too salty and garlicky, and the saganaki was too salty. So the appetizers aren't very good.  Then, I ordered a beer which was spilled on me...fell to the ground and cracked and splashed all over my moms jacket and hair! haahha. the waiter was apologetic, but i was surprised that the manager who we saw scolding at the waiter didn't approach us at all.   I ordered an eggplant which was pretty good, they ordered chicken and also the lamb, those were pretty good as well. This was great b/c the way things were going I didn't have a good feeling about this outing.  So, the entrees saved the day. The waiter then brought out a piece of cake for mom which was pretty good and then he said the cake would be discounted and it was free. Well, of course it was! They brought it out without us asking for one! duh! i mean it was a nice gesture but I mean what were you going to do? charge us? So that kinda bothered me ONLY because I expected some sort of discount for spilling beer all over us right? I don't know, I guess its just a business thing not to give away free food, BUT really do people have to get loud and yell in order to get justice!  So, yes the entrees were good which is the main thing, but I guess i will say that their service was below average.

2011-05-05,1.0,"So my only guess is that someone replaced the original Greek islands restaurant that has a 4-star rating with another, much more inedible, Greek islands restaurant. I can't explain my horrible experience any other way. My boyfriend said of the ambience and décor, ""It's like Las Vegas,"" and I replied, ""More like Reno."" Themed within an inch of its life, with fake fishing boats bolted to the walls and lots of ""Greek"" tilework, it's the kind of restaurant you go to if you have a 3 year-old or a 90 year-old to entertain. A total of 5 waiters and backwaiters served our table, mainly by filling up our water glasses after each sip and continually interrupting our conversation, and by dropping and sometimes tossing plates of food on our table without looking, hopefully on their way to doing something that didn't make them want to kill themselves as much as serving us did. And when there was nothing for the squadron of backwaiters to do, they stood in front of our table with their hands folded, waiting for us to give them something to do. Mainly by drinking from our water glasses. But that's not the point. Horrible service and ambience can be alleviated by good food. It wasn't. Don't be deceived--when the menu says ""Family Style,"" they mean ""Cooked Sometime Today and Kept in Buffet-Style Chafing Dishes Until You Have the Misfortune of Ordering It."" They don't even hide the system--on your way into one of the back dining rooms, you can pass what looks like a cafeteria line where all your dinner options simmer in their own juices, slowly losing any chance of being edible that they'd once had. For example--bakalao was cold, spongy, and chewy, which is exactly what happens to fried fish when you fry it hours before someone is supposed to eat it. Gyro meat was so dry, all the tzatziki in the world couldn't save it. The pile of rice with tomato sauce actually tasted good, but was so unattractively presented, I felt like I was at a nursing home and it was Greek night in the dining room. The only thing that was enjoyable was our fried zucchini appetizer with garlic spread--the zucchini came out hot and crispy, you know, like someone actually cooked it to order. My theory here--if you want a good meal, order something very uncommon that the kitchen will have to cook to order. Otherwise, you're getting it off a buffet line, and it'll taste like it.  Seriously, there's a whole line of Greek restaurants in this neighborhood. There has to be a better one.",0.9723,0.874,0.09,0.036,0.5367324561403509

Here's how my score totals: 5 Stars! 1 Star - The SERVICE was fast and efficient. Every time we had the least bit of water missing from our cups, the bus boys/waiter would stop by without really interrupting our dinner. The bus boys took care of cleaning up TWO levels of the restaurant, while still providing fantastic service for our bread and water before the meal came. The waiter was also genuine (a huge factor in my restauranting experience). I know I'm not the only one that feels this way because the table next to us asked for his name and converse with the waiter.  1 Star - AMBIANCE was great. The restaurant was packed, every table from my view was filled. They sat my family and I in a corner table for 5, it was the perfect amount of space for the amount of food we ordered. Their corner seat was not squished into a corner, we had ample space and we sat comfortably. 1 Star - FOOD was tasty! There is a reason that the restaurant was filled during dinner time on a Monday. The dinner recommendation from the waiter was great. The waiter, Ariel, allowed us to order 3 group meals for 4 people because my family doesn't eat that much. We still had leftovers to take home WITH dessert (it came with the meal). The food was a tiny bit salty, but that would be my only complaint. The restaurant had a HUGE selection in food, and we were happy with our order. 1 Star - Because my family and I had a pleasant experience and felt relaxed.

They have so many delicious choices that I usually end up ordering a bunch of small plates and splitting everything with the table.   On my most recent venture, we had the spinach pie (my personal fave), Athenian salad (delish dressing), cold calamari & shrimp (nice to try but once was enough for me), tzatziki ( my tastebuds are still grateful), and the mousaka and gyro compbo which came with yummy potatoes on the side.  Everything was fantastic. In the past, I've had the flaming cheese which is very good and the dolmades.  Dolmades are usually my favorite but they just don't serve it that way I like them here.

I compare all other Greek places to Vasili's and nothing in Chicago's Greek town can even compare to Vasili's. So to be fair, Greek Islands is very tasty but still not as amazing as Vasili's.

The SeaBass was decent although I wasn't terribly flavorful, they told me it was charbroiled with olive oil but I couldn't taste the olive oil at all.

2011-04-02,4.0,"I was with a group of men who decided to dine at the Greek Islands one evening after a Cubs game. Most of us had been to the restaurant before, but the guy who usually takes us to Greek Islands was not with us. The menu... it was all Greek to me and to everyone else at the table. The guys were kind of overwhelmed at the size of the menu. No one at the table knew what to order and no one wanted to read several pages of food item descriptions. So they turned to me and told me to order for everyone. Uhhh, ummm... okay... I looked down at the menu and the first thing I saw was ""Family Style Dinner"" for $19.95 per person. No sooner had a muttered those words (I thought I was muttering to myself) when our waiter repeated ""Family Style"" and scribbled it on his order pad. I guess that's what we're doing, I mused to myself. I looked up at the other guys and asked what anyone wanted for appetizers and entrees. Apparently I was speaking Greek to them, because they all just stared blankly at me. The only thing anyone knew to say was ""Saganaki"" and ""Lamb"". Gladly, our server went through our options (rather quickly) and I just started picking things at random. We ended up with Skordalia (smooth garlic potato spread), Saganaki (flaming Greek cheese), Athenian Salad (basic salad with tomatoes, two Greek olives, and a small square of feta cheese), sliced lamb, Tzatziki (yogurt, cucumber and garlic spread), and bread. For our four entree choices, I picked Keftedes (beef and lamb meatballs), Sliced Roast Leg of Lamb, Chicken Riganati (baked chicken), Spanakotiropita (spinach and feta cheesed baked in filo dough). Included were two sides (Rice pilaf and Potatoes). Everything was great and we were stuffed when we finished! Five hungry men, but we still didn't finish everything. In particular, I loved the Spanakotiropita (spinach and feta). The Athenian Salad was kind of ordinary. The Skordalia was quite potent with garlic and very good. We ordered a bottle of the house wine (red) with dinner, which was just okay according to the wine connoisseur in our group. And then coffee and dessert came...  - Baklava (sweet pastry with of layers of filo and filled with chopped nuts,  sweetened with honey) which was definitely sweet and tasty. The pastry was kind of tough to cut through. - Galaktoburiko (lemon flavored baked custard on filo, cut into squares) which was relatively light and not too sweet. Karidopita (Greek walnut cake) which was also very good.

2011-04-01,5.0,"Greek Islands is by far the best of the Greektown restaurants. When you arrive at Greek Islands, you will be met with free valet. It's kind of amazing.  The restaurant is HUGE, I've never waited for a table. The service is excellent, all the servers are happy to make suggestions and/or give you a tutorial on how to pronounce greek words.  The saganaki is excellent, but come on.... it's cheese. Of course it's good. The grilled octopus appetizer is shockingly delicious. Charred but tender, make sure you hit it with a squeeze of lemon. My FAVORITE thing about Greek Islands is the combination plate option........ you can get 2 half portions of basically all the good stuff on the menu. Spanikopita + Keftedes Combo.... I could literally eat that for dinner 3+ times a week. The Keftedes (beef and lamb meatballs) are the best meatballs I've ever had in my life (sorry, Grandma). The spanikopita is good, I think they've started using a different type of phyllo dough b/c I swear it used to stay more light and crisp. It's still delicious spinach pie, but the phyllo has been a touch soggy the last few times I've dined. I'm clearly not too broken up about it if you can't tell by this rave review.

2011-03-26,3.0,"""Consistently good.""   That's the best way I could describe Greek Islands.  There are several good establishments in Greek Town to choose from but Greek Islands is arguably the most popular eatery in GT.  At the same time, you'll also notice other words missing from my description...words like ""outstanding"", ""fabulous"" and ""best"". I've eaten at Greek Islands several times and enjoyed each visit but always seem to leave a little wanting when I compare it to some other eateries in the city.  Here are some pros and cons. PROS: Prices:  As Chicago restaurants go, Greek Islands is a relative bargain with most entrees falling in the $12-17 range.   Valet:  Complimentary valet.  That's right... FREE!  Prompt, careful and close proximity to the restaurant. Ambiance: Nicely decorated establishment with an authentic Greek feel to it.  Many of the staff are obviously of Greek origin and the restaurant seems to be popular with Greek patrons. Food:  I've tried several items and always found the food to be of good quality, prepared well and quite tasty.   CONS: Portion Size:  Depending on the entree, the portions don't seem to fit the prices.  The Mousaka and Spanakotiropita are certainly more than ample from a portion perspective however, the twin 6 ounce Lamb Chops are little more than appetizers in size yet carry a $33 price tag. Dessert:  If it's traditional to start your Greek meal adventure with flaming Saganaki, it's just as traditional to end it with some Baklava, that can best be described as the Greek version of Pecan Pie.  When properly prepared, it's moist, super sweet and very tasty.  A little of it can go a long way even for the sweetest tooth amongst you.   Greek Islands version missed the mark.  It was very dry and difficult to cut through.  It was a disappointing end to an otherwise good meal.  THIS TRIP: On previous visits, I've sampled the Spanakotiropita,  Mousaka and Souvlaki and I would heartily recommend any of those traditional Greek entrees.   This time, our party of four started with the obligatory Saganaki (flaming cheese) appetizer which arrives complete with a fire flare-up and an enthusiastic ""Oompa!"" from our server.  Healthy it's not.  Tasty it is!  One of my dinner partners ordered the Mediterranean Sea Bass, which was described as ""tender"" and ""delicious"".  She requested the whole fish be cleaned and presented minus the head.  TIP: If you don't like your fish staring you in the eye, I recommend requesting it be ""cleaned"" prior to serving. Another ordered the above mentioned Spanakotriopita, which is a spinach pie with a flaky, lite, puff pastry type of exterior that had a generous portion of spinach and feta cheese inside. She declared it very good but just more than she could finish. The third ordered a two item combo of chicken riganati and mousaka and judging from his empty plate, it's safe to say he enjoyed it. I ordered the Lamb Chops that came prepared as ordered and very tender and perfectly seasoned.  It was served with an order of rice and potatoes that were less than interesting.  I'd recommend ordering one of their featured sides instead of this bland ""complimentary"" side.  Let me repeat, while the meat was tender and tasty, the portion size of the twin chops didn't match the $33 price point. All in all, three stars from me.  Fun time?  Check.  Decent food?  Check.  Recommend it to others?  Check.  It misses ""fine dining"" status by a country mile but I also don't think you'll leave disappointed either.",0.9988,0.74,0.205,0.055,0.43524369747899166

I walked in and was impressed by the sheer size of the venue. I live in Hawai'i, where NOTHING is this big, let alone a Greek place. Then there was the extensive menu: Even my husband, who is not a fan of many things exotic, had his pick of chicken and beef dishes. Since I couldn't find souvlakis (my favorite) on the menu (Am I blind???), I went with the gyro plate. My order came with a warm pita, a heaping pile of meat and a dish all by itself of the best tzatziki I have ever had. I wanted to lick every last bit of sauce from the dish, it was so ridiculously good. And there was so much gyro meat that no matter how much I liked it, I could not finish it all. Now THAT's my kind of Greek restaurant! But I do have to dock Greek Islands one star for their side Greek salad. Seriously? You cannot slap a slab of feta and couple of olives onto a  tossed salad and call it Greek salad! It was horrendous. If I hadn't ordered it, I would never have known . . . but I did.

We had some octopus, and everyone loved it except me and my grandmother. We also had Saganaki, which is something I would certainly order again. In the next paragraph I will tell you how the chicken Riganati tasted. Keep in mind I'm ordering off of the kids menu, so if you are an adult, you might find the dishes I am ordering on the regular menu.  Even for ordering off of the kid's menu, my dad says that the chicken Riganati should fuel any grown man. I would highly recommend ordering it. My brother ordered the lamb Rosa Marina. He loved it also. I would give this, a 1 being the worst, and 10 being the best, an 8.7.",0.9768,0.816,0.162,0.022,0.6293148028442146

I am literally astonished to see their ratings here as I use yelp regularly and am rarely this far off. We paid $45 for slab of cheese, a shitty salad and 2 terrible entrees.  The old guy serving us made each bite almost unbearable as he stared us down from the corner.

Our server wasn't apologetic and so rude. When we got our check, we were charged for the orders they messed up.

Total = $16. I'm annoyed, but I tell myself, well it's Greektown so that's pretty standard. I get home: The soup is amazing and served with an entire loaf of crusty bread (which I'll pretend I didn't eat half of on the drive home). But everything else? Eh. The spinach pie was cold and bland, and I prefer a little more filo dough for more of a crunch. And the thing that absolutely ruined the meal? The Greek salad, which looked like they had taken a bag of Aldi iceberg lettuce and dumped it in the container unwashed. Let's not get started on how iceberg lettuce should never be served at a restaurant.

We stopped here the other day on a business dinner and one of the guys in the group didn't want to wait so we tried another big name place down the street.  We should have waited.,0.9836,0.725,0.245,0.029,0.5392592592592592
2010-10-05,2.0,"I totally agree with Caitlin's review. I just moved here from Houston, and looking for a fix comparable to the excellent Niko Niko, I trusted Yelpers to not lead me astray. BAD YELPERS! I'm a bit of an eater so I had a few dishes. The gyros meat was almost flavorless. I was SO disappointed. Had been drooling all day, dreaming of savory gyros meat. The potatoes were alright but not up to the flavor punch of buttery lemony goodness delivered by Niko Niko's. The moussaka was thankfully quite good but not great enough to rescue the rest of my dinner. Greek salad was passable but not among the top 50% of those I've had before. I must note that perhaps I wasn't swayed by the ambience as I got the food for takeout and didn't eat in. That said, I was there as they brought it out and literally live two minutes away so it's not as though the food was cold. The atmosphere of the place did look fun and festive, but I can't be swayed by this. The flavor must be there!  I also witnessed a bit of a verbal altercation between the cashier and a couple waiting nearby to be seated. I can't say what started it but the couple seemed unwilling to engage, and the cashier seemed a bit snide. She was very prompt in checking me out, if a bit brusque. All told, I probably would hit up one of the other Greek places in the area next time. Ahhh, Niko Niko, I miss you!!",0.9765,0.816,0.135,0.049,0.4700980392156863
2010-10-05,2.0,"Completely and utterly meh. I thought I was going to a warm family restaurant, not a soulless factory that works to have a huge turnover rate.  I was so excited to try this place, too. To start, the service was bad. About halfway through the meal, I took a step back and did some calculating. Was I about to start my period? Is that why the waiter was annoying me so much? Nope, I still had another week to the Danger Zone. He really was that bad. He dumped the silverware from a plate I was done with onto the tablecloth instead of picking it up with his hands and setting it down or asking me to remove it. And he kept calling me and my dining companion ""kids."" But, he was probably my age. I don't care what age you are, don't call me ""kid"" repeatedly. Garcon!  I was with one other person, and we decided to do the family-style dinner. It sounded like an easy way to try a lot of things from the menu, so why not?  The appetizers were alright. The saganaki, flaming cheese, was lit on fire by our waiter beside our table with an ""Opa!"" Actually, I laughed because it was so half-hearted. The only amusing thing he did all night. Don't get this dish if you're at all sensitive to salt. It was just okay to me. The taramosalata spread, like Greek caviar, was super good. It kind of tasted like Lox spread to me. Mmm..  Salad, meh, but came with tons of feta. Gyro, meh. There is a trend here.  Now onto the entrees: All three entrees and side dishes were served on one plate, and it kind of grossed me out. It had been slopped on a plate as if I were at a cafeteria, and it tasted like it, too. Dolmades were EW, but I don't really like the taste of grape leaves so I won't count it against them. The meatballs were bland, but edible. The lamb was dry and so was the mousaka. It came with two side dishes of rice and potato, which tasted the same. Oh, and that taste was nothing.  Last up was baklava and Greek coffee. Surprise, I loved both. Baklava was heavy on the nuts and extra flaky, and the coffee was strong.  Basically, I'd never go here again.

Only after I waited such a long time then approached them did they bother to get me a table. I was so mad, but once seated the experience improved.  The service was very fast (which is why I'm baffled as to why it took so long to get a table). I had so much time to look over the menu while I waited to be seated so I ordered immediately. The server went to put my order in and game back straight away lighting up the Saganaki and yelling OPAH! It certainly put a positive spin on my mood. The dish wasn't the best I'd had, I was expecting it be saltier.  Next up was Moussaka. Delicious! Couldn't really taste the eggplant like the traditional dish but that's OK because I actually liked it better.

2010-09-19,5.0,"I wanted to update my review after we had our wedding 'reception' there last weekend. As regulars at the Greek Islands, it was really only fitting that we chose there to have our dinner. Everyone was exceptionally nice and extremely accommodating. We worked with Thomas, the banquet manager to make everything nice. He was very helpful and easy to talk to. There was no pressure to design a menu by a certain date, so we were able to choose what we wanted a few days beforehand. They normally only allow any sort of banquet to go until 5pm, but as our wedding was at 2, they let us use the room from 4-6.  It was exceptionally nice of them. They definitely went out of their way to help us. They allowed us to bring our cake and put it in their fridge after it was delivered and they even allowed us to bring sparkling grape juice for toasting as we couldn't afford to do alcohol toasting. We did have a cash bar which worked out nicely for our guests.  Kristoff was the worker helping us the most the day of. He was so nice and incredibly helpful with explaining things, orders, etc. We really appreciated having him on our team.  Now the food: The food was absolutely delicious. We got lots of compliments on our choices, and I never felt like they were faked like they often are when it comes to reception food. We only did one appetizer, saganacki, and that was definitely the right choice. Everyone loved it, and the kiddies got a big kick out of the ""OPA!"" We offered some chicken, gyros, and vegetarian moussaka for dinner, and they all went over well with our guests.  Valet is free, which was a bonus for our guests who drove. All in all, we're very happy we were able to have our wedding dinner there. It was a fantastic choice.

And great, simply prepared Greek food should remind you that simple but outstanding ingredients are all you really need for a terrific meal. Then while you're carrying on about how mindbogglingly good this simple food was, all the Greeks are calmly making this face as if to say, ""Of course it's great; it's Greek food.""  That wasn't what I had. I had decent Greek food.  As I recall, they've got a list in the entrance hallway of the top 100 restaurants - which of course, features the Greek Islands.

2010-07-26,4.0,"Greektown is a wonderful side of Chicago to be familiar with but Greek Islands is one of the better introductions to the neighborhood a newcomer could ask for. I discovered the restaurant a good 7 or 8 years ago and have been coming back ever since. They have 3 dining rooms plus a substantial bar area, the atmosphere is wonderful, the food is delicious, and they treat their customers like family. The kitchen is also out in the open which is something I really appreciate. And as everyone else has already noted, valet parking is free!!! Talk about a great deal. Anyway, I generally go with a lamb or seafood dish. I figure why mess with a winning formula. These are the things that pretty much define Greek cuisine in my eyes so it's always an easy choice for me. Besides, the menu is so substantial that it can be a bit overwhelming, even after eating there a lot over the years. I highly recommend their specials by the way. When dining at old-school family-owned restaurants like Greek islands, I have found that a good rule of thumb is that they really do showcase their talents with their specials so enjoy and appreciate them. If you are dining alone, as I frequently did coming from the office late-night when I worked in I.T., consider making a meal of several appetizers. They are all delicious and there is an incredible array of cold and hot options. I liked them because they don't sit quite as heavily as some of the entrees do and they're also much more fun! Absolute favorites are the salads, saganake (flaming cheese), grilled octopus, and gigante lima beans. Oh, and the lemon egg soup is delicious!!!",0.9987,0.679,0.304,0.016,0.5702252252252251

To start off I just want to say if you want a gyro or something simple like that just plain skip this place and go to any of the greasy place down the street and I don't mean greasy in a bad way - just that it will be much better than this place. Service was good in the beginning but quickly trailed off with empty water glasses and a check that took over 30 minutes to get. I usually look right past the service if the food is good. That was not even close to the case.  The only things that I found enjoyable out of the four dishes we all ordered were the pitas and the tzatziki sauce. If something I can make myself and buy at the store is the only thing that is good we are all in trouble. I personally had the roasted leg of lamb that I was tempted to send back but I believe you cant judge a book by its cover. It was a few slices on a plate that looked like it had been sitting in a holder somewhere. Not an ounce of juice anywhere and just dry as cardboard. We also ordered the combo platter which was some of the same dry leg of lamb, mousaka that wasn't too bad, and the dolmades which was so salty that I had to spit it out. We also had to try the gryos just to compare to the small grab and go places. If you have gotten to this point you know that it would be better to just go down the street and get yourself a cheap one. I really wanted to like this place but everything was just so-so. Service was not good at all and the food needs to be more fresh or just seasoned right. NO OPAAAAAA......",0.9545,0.812,0.121,0.067,0.49233697983697977

But I was definitely disappointed.....The valet parking was good, we were seated right away as we had reservations (they allow reservations only till 6pm) and then it took a turn for the worse - our server was this older gentleman who was quite rude and abrupt with us - He comes to get us something to drink 1 minute after we sit down - when we ask for 5 mins he looks unhappy but goes away and comes back in less than 5...We give the drink orders and he is back in 2 mins for the appetizer order. Again when we ask for time he looks unhappy and rushes again in less than 5 mins...not sure but he just wanted to rush us out... When we were deciding on what the main course should be, the one vegetarian in our group asked him for suggestions on what a vegetarian should do and he had the nerve to answer ""try a different restaurant""....we were shocked speechless at the nerve of this guy...  Once we ordered the appetizers, he doesn't tell us we need to order pita separately till we ask. By this time I was ready to go to the management and give them a piece of my mind... The actual food was a mixed fare -  When the appetizers came, the tzatziki was great, the taramosalata was quite good albeit too salty and the saganaki was way too salty that I couldn't even finish what I was eating. When the main course came, the vegetarian moussaka my friend ordered was quite good, the lamb with pasta that another friend ordered had amazingly tender fall off the bone lamb so that was really good. My combination plate that was priced at $16 left a lot to be desired....not in taste but in portions...at most of the Greek restaurants I have eaten at, the combo plate usually has a large piece of lamb, 2 dolmades, 2 meatballs and a large piece of mousakka - this was such a tiny portion for the price - I got 1 measly dolmades, 1 meatball and a matchbox sized mousakka...

The Saganaki never fails (I always eat it with extra lemon), the Taramosalata (Greek cavier) is always creamy and subtle, the Tzatziki sauce has the perfect flavor, the pita bread is always fresh and dry, never greasy/soggy. The gyros are seasoned and cooked perfectly (the reason I stopped being a 5-yr vegetarian I swear), the salmon dish is huge and cooked perfectly. The Avgolemono soup has a nice creamy flavor, very authentic. The wine list is amazing, ask server for recs. The Greek salad has tons of fresh Feta and Kalamata olives. The spinach side dish with tomato sauce is so good and inexpensive. I need to try the kabobs again. Second: the price. Considering the quality of food and overall experience of the place, the prices are super reasonable. Gyros are about $11.99, all the appetizers are about $5 or less. We always order family style so it's not as much. Third, the restaurant itself is very spacious, many different rooms, the decor is so festive/fun, yet classy, the service is always friendly, food always comes out quickly, lots of diversity, casual dress is cool, the line can be long sometimes but the free valet makes up for it. This place is a must-go in Chicago!",0.983,0.826,0.16,0.014,0.5283903133903133

The lamb was amazing, and even though I couldn't finish it, the rest of the table helped demolish it, but the vegetables were not very good. They were pretty mushy, and I wasn't a huge fan of the seasoning.  For dessert, my mother tried the house special (I forget the name) but it supposedly contains lemon custard, and we're all convinced that they've mistaken 'lemon' for 'banana' on the menu, as there is obviously no lemon, but a very strong banana flavor.

One thing the restaurant lacked was a greek band...that could of earned a few extra points in my book. I ordered a greek salad, cup of egg lemon soup and had Greek Lamb Kabobs with Sokolatina (Greek Chocolate Cake for dessert). First the greek salad was a disappointment given the feta cheese was not crumbled on the salad and the salad did not have any red onions...which was a huge mistake in my book. The egg lemon soup was very good however...it didnt have any chicken.  The Lamb kabob was okay but it was not as tender as it should have been and the sokolatina was not as good as I have had at other greek restaurants. The portions were pretty large and the prices were very reasonable. Would I go back again? Yes...my friend had the pastitso and I thought it was amazing...I think it depends what you order here.

The bread they served should have been served to fish in a pond! It was so dry and hard.  The garides shrimp dish was GROSS! We LOVE this dish at a greektown in Florida. However, Greek Islands version of it tasted like some nasty cafeteria food. It was in a sweet tomato sauce which tasted to me like Chef boyardee. I really should have sent it back, but the bf liked it enough to eat a few bites.  Once thing I noticed was that while waiting to use the restroom I was saw the chef standing still.

Saganaki is almost a must, if not for how tasty it is, then for the spectacle you cause disrupting everyone around you.  The saganaki is flambed tableside as the cheese is lit on fire next to you (sometimes too close) and your waiter screams ""OPA!"" and everyone around you looks at your table.  This is great and a lot of fun, especially if you are an attention seeker.  However, without fail, several seconds later, another waiter several tables away will scream that ""OPA"" and all heads will turn there.  Don't fight it, yours will also.  And again.  And again.  Throughout your meal.  Until your neck is sore.  You'll tell yourself not to...but it's like a bad carcrash...you can't look away.  Your meals inevitably end up an hr longer than you had planned.

2010-04-05,3.0,"I was something of an orphan on Easter Sunday, so my ex-boss took pity on me and invited me to join him for lunch since it was also Greek Easter.  He's practically Greek mafia so we've gone to just about every Greek restaurant in the city. His favorite was Costa's, but since sadly that place burned down, I knew there'd be somewhere else in the offing.  There's enough other Greek restaurants that are quite good, so I was a little dismayed that he chose Greek Islands, but hey, one can't look a gift horse in the mouth.  I've been to Greek Islands and every other restaurant in Greektown many, many times. I am a lover of Greek food and have been since I was little and my mom dated her own Greek mobster.  My issue with Greek Islands is that it's always seemed like Greek cafeteria food. It's not bad, it's just that other places do the same things better.  GI used to be around the corner on Jackson, east of Halsted, before it moved to its present location. It was smaller then, and maybe therein lies the rub.  It expanded, was able to accommodate more diners, and thus had to churn out more food, more swiftly.  We started with saganaki, natch. One cannot NOT have this in Greektown. Theirs is good, but it's not a difficult dish to master and it's the most ubiquitous appetizer on a Greek menu.  Next we all shared taramosalata, which I took a pass on. I cannot get down with whipped fish. I was assured it was good, so I'll have have to take that under advisement.  Greek salad, spanakopita and avgolemono soup followed. Again, these are all standard items and GI executes them as well as anyone.  For my entrée, I decided this being Easter and all, and since I was in a Greek restaurant, to go traditional and get lamb chops. These little beauties were great. Perfectly cooked, juicy, and flavorful. And they come with rice and oven browned potatoes which make this a portion big enough to share (not that I did this, mind you).  For the table, my friend ordered horta (sp?). This is something they make off menu for him. It's basically boiled dandelion greens. It's actually quite good squeezed with lemon and reminds me of spinach. Apparently my ex-boss used to pick dandelions by his mother's grave on Easter and go home and cook them so that's why he ordered them. Yeah, I thought it was a weird story too.  We drank a few bottles of Boutari and Roditys and camped out for the better part of three hours. The place was festive and packed to the rafters but no one rushed us and let us sit there as long as we wanted.

Overall though, the food is great, and the wine list is SO reasonably priced that you'll possibly be too drunk at the end of your meal to complain about their ""crappy service"". Here's a final tip to those who know they're easily bothered and are service snobs: ask to be seated in the front dining area, it's more spread out and you'll feel less claustrophobic.  As you walk in, there's an area of seating to the right that I can't stand to sit in because it's just too cramped - you have to walk up these weird small, slippery stairs and its too close to the kitchen/busy areas.

We came early on a Friday and were whisked away to the multi level room in the back near the kitchen.  The waiter quickly took our drink order - so I hadn't even decided what I wanted to eat before I had to decide on the type of wine.  I hate that so much.  Give me a chance to open the menu!  When I asked him to come back at a later point, he said that I needed to order our drinks first. We started with the calamari since it was on special.  Holy chewy city, Batman.  I almost sent this back it was so bad.  Either it had been sitting out for a while or the cook is an idiot.  We also ordered some skordalia - it was really pretty good but being nickel and dimed by ordering the pita separately is :( My SO ordered the keftedes (beef/lamb meatballs).  I ordered the arni fournou (lamb and potatoes).  I clearly ordered the better meal, but nonetheless everything was way over salted - probably to account for the otherwise bland food.  Our food came out so fast that I really had to wonder...  I am sure that our food wasn't as fresh as the vegetables/meat/herbs out for display throughout the room. We ordered dessert - our waiter had a tough time telling us which items had walnuts and which didn't.  Awesome!  Food allergies are the reason we don't go back to places like this. Speaking of our waiters - I was really uncomfortable here.  The waiters were TOO efficient and rushed us beyond belief.  They cleared out our plates before we were done eating - my SO even protested that they not take his plate away because he wasn't done yet and they told him he didn't need a plate to finish.  The guy that fills up the water came too frequently - one time he actually reached over my plate and my arms as I was cutting my lamb to refill 2 sips of water.  I found the servers to be very pushy.  Coincidence to the lack of women on the wait staff?  Who knows.  Either way, the service was really unprofessional and I doubt I'll even go back to see what the hype is about.",-0.9839,0.773,0.083,0.144,0.49067460317460326

2009-10-15,4.0,"Greek food isn't typically my first choice dining out... nothing against Greeks :-) I love homemade spanakopita or stuffed gyro with tzatziki as much as the next Nia Vardalos or Maria Menounos, but the handful of times I've been to Greek restaurants I haven't been impressed. Generally I just find the food to heavy/greasy and bland.  But Greek Islands is a pleasant change! It was my first trip and there was a lot I liked: 1.  Service. Outstanding. A+. I volunteer with a mentoring program & I took my mentee here for an early surprise birthday dinner. I've learned that when you dine out with a middle-schooler at an hour commonly reserved for early-bird specials, you can get some quizzical looks and spotty service, but not the case here. So good that our dinner was almost two months ago and I can still remember our server's name, Bill. My mentee spent over 5 minutes filling out a comment card :-) 2. Atmosphere--we enjoyed the decor, just enough without being over done. We sat a table ""at the top of the mountain"" which was really fun since you can look over the most of the restaurant. 3. Prices: 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, 1 dessert, & ""drinks"" (soda) for under $35. Good stuff. Plus I took a peek at the wine list when my mentee was in the bathroom & it was super cheap! A bunch of options for just under $5/glass. I see myself coming back here with the girls. 4. Food! Most of it was very good, particularly the two things Bill recommended; I was skeptical of both but they turned out to be our favorite's of the evening: i. Fried calamari. Based on my bias against Greek restaurants being too greasy, and Bill deviating from the two appetizers we asked about & instead suggesting something fried, this is the last thing I would have gone for. Fortunately my mentee happens to love calamari so I agreed, & was proven wrong, was great! Light, crispy, perfect. ii. Ambrosia. So it comes time for dessert & again we name two choices & ask Bill which is better, & again Bill suggests another option entirely. But this time we're both really skeptical & it takes some convincing on Bill's end to persuade us. Yowza! Deeeeelicious! A dense blanket of shredded filo dough and walnuts topped with ice cream & caramel... nothing terribly crafty or couture, but 100% sweet-tooth satisfying. My mentee got the chicken riganati which was very tasty, HUGE serving (definitely enough for lunch or dinner the next day). The potatoes baked with lemon, oil & oregano are also delightful. I got the combo plate, which I'd recommend for anyone going here for the first time. I chose  spinach cheese pie (at Bill's suggestion) and the pastichio. The pastichio was the only miss of the evening. I was expecting it to be on the heavy side, but akin to a greek lasagna. It was more like a giant block of baked macaroni with meat, it wasn't very flavorful and was a little overcooked.  But I loved the spinach cheese pie. It was everything I could want, which was a tower of spinach and cheese, not too dry, not soggy, topped with a flaky crust. All in all, a very solid 4 stars! Will definitely be back.

For $5.50 you get a huge slab of flaming Saganaki.  What a deal to get your flame on.  Their Avgolemeno soup was thick 'n creamy - texture-wise, just the way I like it, however it was quite bland and not full of the explosive lemon flavor I'm use to.  The Gyros was a plate-full.  I've gotten use to the more Middle Eastern (Swarma-style spices) flavors - so the meat was kinda-bland, but that's what is to expected for Gyros.  Still, it was freshly cut off the rotisserie skewer and tender and juicy.  The Loukanico (Sausage flavored with orange rind) was quite tasty, and the slices of Roast leg of Lamb were pretty moist.   So if you want to get caught up in all the hussle and bussle of frantic Greeks running around screaming Opah!  Opah!  Opah!, this is your spot.",-0.4718,0.896,0.056,0.047,0.5210858585858587

2009-07-10,5.0,"This is far and away one of my top 10 restaurants in Chicago.  Once you make it past the upfront bar and walk inside the main restaurant, it looks like something directly from Greece. There is a 4-5 level terrace seating area built on stones, almost makes you think you're eating by the ruins. You can see the kitchen and the massive roasting meats from almost any seat in the house. Wait staff is very friendly and actually started teaching us how to speak Greek. They had some amazing recommendations for food.  The group of us four decided to order a bunch of food and split it. The lamb was delicious (certainly a staple of Greek food, make sure you order this). But for the rest of the menu I would advise you take the waiter's recommendations.

2009-07-09,2.0,"A case of egregiously confused restaurateurs, the food is forgettable.  I believe the owners intended for this place to be an upscale Greek eatery, but it's more like street cart food meets Greek diner.  There's valet parking, and the waiters don matching vests and ties, but most of the food is prepped in advance, left on a steam table, and slopped out cafeteria style for each order.  A perplexing faux fine dining experience. A starter of donner kebab, garlic dip and pita would more appropriately be served out of a street cart rather than a white table cloth restaurant.  Saganiki is decent, but salty to a cringing level.   A chicken 'riganti' was so boring it hurt.  It pains me that it's near the price point of really great Greek restaurants in New York, such as Pylos or Kefi.  It was just a dried out, boring, completely forgettable bit of bird.  An order of roast lamb loin was similarly disappointing.  Just a hair above street meat.     Thankfully, the food is not outrageously expensive, but this is certainly a restaurant that can be missed.",-0.8723,0.753,0.102,0.145,0.48433233433233425

The Dish to get is the swordfish shishkabob. I've eaten here hundreds of times. Its the best. Trust me. My brother loves the Arnie Fornu (Spelling?) which is delicious lamb. But the Swordfish shishkabob is it. The atmoshphere is great. Very noisy, very open. Multiple tiers of seating. All of the employees are greek. They are all extremely friendly. There is free Valet parking too. Which only adds to the enjoyment. There can be a wait sometimes and they don't take reservations but its still worth waiting. The Nostos, cheap red house wine, is very good for the price and a nice compliment to a lot of the dishes. You should order the saganaki just for the ""Opa!"" Factor, the waiter will light the cheese on fire and exclaim opa! The smapler appetizer plater is very good. I love their salmon spread and tzaziki. You'll also love how the bus boys clean your bread crumbs (from the delicious loaf of fresh bread you'll be dipping in olive oil) briskly from the table with a metal hand sweep. I've been with amanda and she's had the pastichio, which is very good and enough to feed 3. I've also tried some of the lamb kabobs and the chicken. They're all great (but no swordfish).

You will not go home hungry and you'll feel like you were at a big greek house party the whole time you're dinning. If you go and don't get the sworfish shishkabob.

I debated giving  4 stars, but memories of certain food items just left me feeling 3 stars was more adequate. I am not Greek, but I grew up with top notch Greek food, so maybe I am a little spoiled. The Greek Islands IS good, and some of the food (saganaki!) is presented in such a way to leave you feeling good about this place. Our appetizer was amazing. We had tirokafteri, a feta and pepper dish that I definitely recommend to those who like a little spice in their dishes. My main dish was not creative, and that might be why I suffered a little. I had a combo meal of gyro (which was NOT served with pita - something I found really confusing and... dare I say.. slightly cheap) and spinach pie. I couldn't even finish the spinach pie. It just wasn't good. The gyro meat and tzatziki was good, but that's everywhere, especially in Greektown. The other party had braised lamb that was delicious. For dessert he had a terrific baklava and what he 's described as ""the best ice cream I've found in Chicago so far."" (We're somewhat new to town, andI am sure we are missing out on ice creams, so take this at face value! ) I can't fairly comment on my dessert, the creme caramel, as they tried to talk me out of it, claiming it was still ""hot"" (it wasn't, but something was definitely wrong with it), but since most everything has nuts in it, my choices felt limited, so I stuck with it.  One thing that did impress me was that they have a vineyard in Greece that they get a lot of their wines from. We had a Greek red from this vineyard, and it was flavorful and appealing, great with meat and cheese, just as described. Maybe the wine is what left us with such a good feeling when we left the restaurant.  In conclusion, I give the service a big thumbs up (especially the guy that fills water glasses that appeared out of nowhere and made sure my glass was never even half empty!), the wine (both quality and selection) and the appetizers (I heard other tables commenting on the taste of their appetizers).  The atmosphere is fun and family friendly as well.

The place has a great, lively atmosphere: warm, busy, fun interior, friendly waitstaff, affordable wine menu.  I had the salmon and my friends had the whitefish and the lamb; all of these dishes were huge servings of beautifully cooked fish/meat, complemented by over-cooked vegetables.  So, what I gathered from this experience is that they seem to do meat and fish very well, and vegetables not so well.

2008-11-15,4.0,"Greek food might be the one cuisine that Chicago really does better than anyone else in the America. Luckily, my friend's husband is from Greece, so we were comfortable following him all the way to Greek Islands, which is their favorite Greek restaurant because it's consistently good. Generally, my experience with Greek food had been limited to gyros, souvlaki, tzaziki, and spanakopita, so I was very excited to try some new dishes. It also seemed like a good way to purge the memory of the White Castle sliders we ate two hours before. Since we weren't all that hungry, we ordered a variety of of small plates instead of entrees. We started with Taramosalata, a blend of cod roe, potatoes, onions and olive oil. It's described as Greek caviar, but it's more of a dip that you can eat almost anything with it. I spread it on some bread and loved it because it's a little salty, and you get the little crunch from the roe. It's also pink. The Greek salad was classic, but we discussed how this would taste with cucumbers in Greece since American cucumbers are fairly bland, as well as some heirloom tomatoes instead of the regular, boring supermarket tomatoes. The Keftedakia are meatballs with a tangy tomato sauce. I could have had a couple more orders of this. I'm normally not a fan of dolmas because they're usually small and cold. At Greek Islands, the Dolmades are served hot with an egg/lemon sauce and they're huge, with balanced mix of meat and rice. I'd eat these any time. The grilled octopus was one of the best things we ordered. Meaty and grilled to perfection, my wife said this was better than the grilled octopus we had at Babbo...and that's saying something. Gyros are a Greek classic, and these were really good. Maria's husband said that in Greece, gyros don't look like shaved meatloaf as is traditionally the case in America. Instead chunks of meat are stacked on a spit, so when it's sliced, you get...chunks of meat. Still, I loved the long strips of shaved meatloaf anyway. Our last dish was the Flaming Saganaki Cheese. This is strictly a Chicago Greek phenomenon. Basically, it's salty cheese flambée. The server lit the cheese as he approached the table, and it was ablaze when it arrived. If you like fried or burnt cheese, this is definitely for you. The service friendly and attentive, although I'm sure it didn't hurt that our friends are regulars. I'm tempted to come back before we leave, but there's a lot on our to-eat list. I do feel like Greek Islands gave us a solid foundation to use when we eat and evaluate Greek food from now on, which is indispensible.",0.9973,0.821,0.163,0.016,0.4100887496342043

Then came a salad, which was the only real let down, as the greens were iceberg (some baby greens maybe, please?) and totally over dressed. Like drenched. Not great.  Dinner was roasted lamb, mousaki (kinda like a Greek Shepards pie for those who've never had it), dolmades (stuffed grape leaf), lamb meatballs, rice, and potatoes. Did I mention it was a ton of food??? It was all really really good. Not light, but really quite tasty.  Then there's desert! Which is a custard, a baklava and a cup of coffee.

I can spend $50-60 here on lunch for myself and that's hard to do considering the prices are very reasonable. The experience starts right when you enter. From the way you are greeted, you can tell that this is still a family business, even though the restaurant is the size of a quarter city block. The restaurant is laid out very interestingly and about 8 years ago or so, they remodeled and added tiered seating, which is definitely unique. They are have some areas for decent sized groups, but you can feel either very romantic or like you are sitting in a crowded European cafe, depending on where you are sat. The food is wonderful and many of my favorite dishes call this their home. The lamb chops spectacular. If this is your first trip and you are on speaking terms with lamb, do not miss your chance to eat these before you die. In fact, new words should be invented to describe them. Their dolmades are pure heaven and I've never been to another greek place that even serves them this way, let alone this deliciously. Most Greek restaurants serve them cold.

ADVICE: you're much much better off each ordering something different (or even the same thing) and sharing. hopefully your food will be individually and freshly prepared and it will certainly be less expensive. the deets: The menu includes two options for ""Family Dinner"" and the premise is that if you have two or more people, you can dine as a group for $20.95 each. Both options include filling, but inexpensive appetizers to share (e.g. bread, tatziki, the salmon-y dip stuff (which was bland and looked artificially coloured), a plate of shaved gyro meat on onions, and ""flaming cheese"") and an individual salad For entrees, everyone shares from a plate of rice with tomato sauce, roasted potatoes, and dolamenes (sp? the grape leaf rolls).

2008-08-04,5.0,"Pure gluttony and I loved every aspect of it!  Last night I was craving Greek food after passing by Greektown the day before to a friend's place.  Of course, first step is first.  In a quest for top of the line Greek food I checked yelp for the highest rated Greek restaurant in Greektown.  Greek Islands was the winner with 4.5 stars and 170 reviews.  Ok so it's a go.  When we first arrived, I noticed it was already busy at 4:30pm on a Sunday.  The restaurant is relatively large compared to its neighboring restaurants and we were seated right away (plus 1 star).   Where to begin.. I'm not that familiar with Greek food but I do know the gyros and lamb is their specialty.  Also, you can't come to Greektown and not try their Greek salad.  Too many choices on the menu and my eyes become fixed on the Family Style Dinners for $20.95 per person.  The great thing about prix fixe meals is that you no longer have to exercise your brain to make a choice and possibly regret later AND you always get more food than if you had ordered each separately.  So I've narrowed it down to Family Style #1 and Family Style #2.   Both include  - Starters of Saganaki and Taramosalata  - Greek salad  - Gyros for the appetizer  - Side dish of rice pilaf and potato  - Baklava, Galaktoburiko,and Karidopita (dessert & coffee)   The main difference between the two is their entrees.  Family Style #1 consists of roasted leg of lamb, mousaka, dolmades, and meatballs and Family Style #2 consists of chicken riganati, pastichio, dolmades, and meatballs.  Back to first thought process, Greek is known for their lamb.  Family Style #1 it is! Now on top of this order, we each order a cup of soup.  I ordered the Avgolemono (chicken broth, rice and egg-lemon) since I had been craving this soup ever since I quit my job in Hoffman Estates (used to frequent Greek Village Taverna).  My boyfriend ordered the Psarosoupa (seafood gumbo). Yes, it does sound like a LOT of food, doesn't it?  But keep in mind we had each only eaten a half bagel all day. The first to arrive is our soups.  Hmm yumm.  We're happily munching on the bread and dipping it in our soups.  Then we get our starters.  The Saganaki (grilled cheese) and Taramosalata (Greek style caviar spread) were both excellent.  We start to realize we're in trouble with all the bread and pita we've consumed and tell the waiter to pack the rest to go since it was soo good.  Next came the gyros.  We take a few bites and ask to wrap up the remainder so we could still have room to eat the main course!  The waiter is just about to bring the entrees when he realizes he forgot the salad.  The salad was a great balance to all the bread, cheese, caviar, and gyros we had eaten.   At last the main course (this plate is a full meal in itself and probably all I needed to order).  The lamb, eggplant casserole, and rice was extremely good but sadly, I was too full to enjoy.  Again, took to go.  The waiter asked if he should just put the desserts in a bag and bring out the coffees.  We decided to be troopers and asked him to bring out one share of desserts and packed the other half to go.  I'm happy we did because the desserts were amazing and I was able to enjoy a few bites.  We left with a total of four baggies.  A little embarrassing but excellent money spent!

A few downfalls would be: -The wait that often may require you to wait a half an hour or more. -Stern/serious (not necessarily rude) waiters is not uncommon, perhaps it's cultural. -Recently, I guess they were shut down for a few days due to health inspection findings.  Hmmm now it's still busy as heck so something changed.  This won't lose me as a customer!

Overall nice environment, the menu had quite a few options from sandwiches to entrees to appetizers. We ordered the fried calamari and fava with some pita. Both were delicious! I had ordered the lamb kebabs and parents ordered the gyros- which is staple in greek cuisine, and brother ordered the chicken kebab. The gyros was the best plate of the three, although they should provide more pitas as part of the dish- one is clearly not enough! The only point which I think slightly ruined the experience was the waiter who seemed to be very proud- bordering on arrogant. In an attempt to avoid ruining a bad meal I chose to steer clear. There was a slight problem with the chicken kebabs- one or two pieces were ""pink"" which is unacceptable for poultry- in most other meats its acceptable.

They were out of the fresh American red snapper that I wanted so I chose the fresh Mediterranean seabass instead.  At $18, it was a good value and tasted fresh and light.  I chose to get the entire fish instead of having it filleted for me.  The baked vegetables that it came with were sort of overcooked and oily though.  We later saw the trays of cooked food (including those vegetables) sitting under heating lamps, almost like buffet-style but behind a glass window, on our way out.  My friends who tried some other dishes found their food decent but not amazing.  The baked shrimp with feta and rice was apparently seasoned well, but the shrimp was lacking in freshness.  The fried calamari was just like any other fried calamari. Our meal ended on an especially sour note for me because the waiter splattered fishy olive oil from my plate all over my white top as he was clearing the table.  Though he apologized, he offered nothing to make up for it.  In general, I found the service kind of lacking - my iced tea was hardly ever refilled, and we watched the waiter stand around for 10 minutes doing nothing after we had asked him to break a $20 bill for us.  Not sure if I want to come here again.

Fresh, hot pita bread, wonderful hummus and cold appetizer dips, a peasant salad with cucumbers, tomatoes, Greek olives and feta cheese, a plate of gyros big enough for five people to share... (My sister and I learned the last part the hard way.) Our service was terrible the last time I was there, and I got food poisoning from SOMETHING I ate there once (I'll blame the saganaki), but if you're in a hurry when you're there, you've come to the wrong restaurant.

Choose both - they give you the option of getting two or more half orders (at just marginally more than half the full order price).  The kiddies can get a single half order.  The absolute best tsadziki in town.   For the uninitiated, be daring and get a bottle of Roditys - the traditional greek wine which is not white but not exactly red either and tastes a bit like Kool Aid at first, but by the time you get to the bottom of the bottle (at a whopping price of about 18 bucks) it tastes just fine.

(You had to be there to get the full picture--it was as though the waiter magically turned into a genie, knowing exactly what to do next).  And what he comes back with is a great big bowl of three perfectly formed ""balls"" (it's the only word that fit here!) of vanilla ice cream with a shot--make that two--of Scotch (as in the liquor).  My friend, as if performing a ritual before dancing flamenco, carefully and with much fanfare, pours the Scotch on the ice cream.  Watching the ice cream fall apart ... melting, turning a warm, cashmere beige color, is a sight I'll always remember ... (a little dramatic, but if any of you  knows someone who is Spanish and has lived all his/her life in Spain ... well ... I rest my case). This is what I love most about Greek Islands--More than just food, it's a cultural experience.  It's no problem if you'd like to order something that is not on the menu.  If it's in the kitchen, they'll make it for you. To say that it's lively is putting it mildly, and whether you like it or not, someone next to your table will feel the need to ask you what you are eating, especially if you order the grilled-to-perfection octopus still, it seems, ""swimming""--only in olive oil.            ...or the Taramosalata--a wonderful, tapioca-like-consistency of fish roe made mostly of cod and mixed to perfection with potato, lemon juice vinegar and olive oil.  It's pink--yes--the color varies in shade depending on the type of roe used.  That--and the Greek-style, thick-sliced sesame crusted bread and I'm dancing with the gods.     ---Waiters running around with flaming cheese yelling ""Opa"" ... patrons speaking in different languages ... young as well as old(er) folks ... couples, families, hotties and the like ... all enjoying classic, authentic Greek cuisine.  I only have one ""warning"" though, which is pretty ironic given the cultural and ethnic climate of the place:  Do NOT confuse Greek coffee with Turkish - ""them's"" can be fighting words ... :) Drinks for everyone!  Opa!",0.9951,0.826,0.144,0.03,0.5066145833333333

I'm sure the poor waiters get so tired of yelling ""Opa!"" over a flaming plate of saganaki but I sure enjoyed it. I love the cavernous layout of Greek Islands. They seem to have about 5 separate dining rooms (all bustling when I went yesterday for lunch) and the one we were sitting in had tiered patios which I thought was sweet as hell because I could survey everything that was happening on the main floor from my little perch.  So not only did we get the flaming cheese but we also got a fava bean dip (minus the liver and a nice Chianti) which was delicious. Don't forget to order pita to go with it... we did but the complimentary bread worked nicely too. My lunch date had been here before so he knew about the colossal size of their gyro platter. Seriously, they bring you an entire lamb's worth of meat. So we agreed to split it and even with the two of us mowing down we still have leftovers. Everything was great, but not quite portioned the way I would have liked. You get the pile of meat, a huge glob of (the best) tzatziki sauce, tons of onion but one one small pita and one tomato slice. For the amount of meat I think you need at least one more pita. So the whole meal I'm looking at the dessert list which I sat facing. Bad idea. All their desserts sound phenomenal and I reeeeally want to try the baklava. Unfortunately, my boyfriend is anti-dessert about 99% of the time (plus he did need to get back to work which is the legit of the two excuses) and I didn't want to be a huge sow so I declined... and wept a little on the way home.

Anyhow, I had the lamb stewed with peppers and potatoes.  The sauce was delicious.  The portion was huge and I enjoyed sharing it with my BF.  He had the stuffed peppers.  Although he said they were only ok, I think he was just trying to boost my stew,  LOL The outdoor seating was really nice and despite how busy it was, the service was very attentive.  Something I've always found at this location.

The atmosphere inside the Greek Islands is pretty darn cute.  You feel kind of like you are on the streets of a little village.  The service is good, but really almost too good.  It became a running joke at our table that as soon as a sip would be taken  from the water glass, someone would rush right over to top it off.  I personally don't appreciate that kind of hovering, though I reckon it is preferrable to not having the water refilled at all.

The fool that I was, I took the safe bet and chose a gyros platter. And a gyros platter it was, piled high with strips of meat and raw onions, with maybe 2 pitas. The pitas were eaten quickly. With that formality out of the way, the imposing platter of gyros strips and raw onions stared me down. I reached for my fork and didn't blink. I went at it with the intensity of a Japanese guy at a hot dog eating contest. One strip, 2 strips, 4 strips, 8 strips, 20, and so on. I dueled with the gyros platter, pausing every so often for a sip of Coke. Carry-out in a doggy bag was no longer an option as I went into a zone. As the last scrap of gyros surrendered to the mercy of my fork's wicked prong, I had prevailed over this dinner that probably could have fed 3 or 4 starving Greek children for a day. And a great platter of gyros it was.  I waddled out of the restaurant and came home to bring in the new year, the weight of the gyros still slowing me down. I went to bed, waking about every hour to drink some more water and burp out a pungent concoction of onions and gyros. The battlefront had shifted from plate to digestive system, and I could not quit now. I realized my culinary life had reached rock bottom and passed out till morning. On January 1st, after skipping breakfast and only eating a very small lunch, I imposed a personal ban on all gyros products for a year.

2007-01-30,5.0,"I finally went to Greek Island for the first time last Saturday! I always hear good things about this place from almost everyone, and I have to agree. Whenever we go out in Greek Town we usually go to Pegasus or to Santorini. Neither of them compare to Greek Island. In fact, I have a craving for it already and it's only been two days. The service was great, but we went early. It was pretty full, but we sat down right away. We ordered the Saganaki (fried cheese) and that was okay. The best part of the meal was the bread that you get when you sit down, the skorthalia (garlic potato puree w/ pita), and the calamari. I ordered the spinach pie and it was okay, but I don't think I like spinach pie. I have had it elsewhere and wasn't a fan either, but I thought it was because it was a bad restaurant. Everyone loved their food and it was pretty inexpensive. The atmosphere is much better than the other Greek Town restaurants, but just be careful walking to your table: the floor is really slippery near the kitchen!",0.9802,0.781,0.173,0.046,0.4716128117913832

We got seated on the highest level in a room with multi-tiered seating so it was fun to watch all the tables below us and scope out the kitchen front scene, too. It was packed when we got there (I believe they don't take reservations) but the wait was reasonably--20min--and we just hung out drinking wine at the bar. Be prepared for tons of ""OPA""-ing!  We started off with the flaming Saganaki cheese (MUST get)--so tasty! They flambed it right in front of us so it really does come to the table all flaming with fiery excitement. That was quickly devoured by the three of us at the table. For appetizers, we also shared dolmades and the Athenian salad. I guess these were more regular, nothing too special but the portion was quite generous. For my main dish, I ""created my own combo"" with a gyro and a mousaka. The gyro's meat was tender and flavorful while the mousaka was satisfying to the taste buds. One friend got the Vegetarian plate which was a bit too much for one person (it was filled with tons of various beans and veggies in heavy sauces) and the other a lamb plate. I forgot exactly which one, probably the roast leg, but that was done very well. Fun place, good food, good prices.",0.9941,0.773,0.206,0.022,0.4716959706959707
