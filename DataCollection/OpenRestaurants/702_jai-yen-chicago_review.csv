The shrimp tempura appetizer was fried very well. It comes with 2 shrimps, broccoli and sweet potato. A very generous portion for $6 in my opinion.  The Jai Yen Maki was also delicious and the presentation was very nice.  Service was slightly slow but nothing too bad. Everyone working there was very nice and ambiance was good.

Their rolls are OK, but I should mention I'm very picky with makimono and I'm not a fan in general. I usually order sashimi, and their Salmon don comes with a good amount. However, some days their slices aren't very fresh, other days, we get fat slabs of fresh well cut salmon. The one time we got tuna sashimi, it was old, flimsy, and even the color of our fish was faded. Their miso is nothing special. Their Udon tastes very bouillon-y (MSG, MSG, MSG) I've tried their rice entrees and they're sub-par, usually lacking in flavor or just bad flavors in general. One time a friend ordered the Hawaiian fried rice dish and didn't finish most of it. We threw it back in our Wok, refried it with our own spices and added some ingredients to make it taste better.

Overall the food was very affordable, and between the two of us we had to order 2 apps, soup, 2 maki dishes, shrimp fried rice, a cashew chicken entree, and a slice of cheesecake to meet the $50 minimum. The food was good and came in serving sizes that I would normally expect from sushi/Asian-cuisine restaurants - meaning that we definitely had food left on the plate. I would love to give this restaurant 4 or even 5 stars for the food and service. The wait staff were friendly and attentive. We even saw one staff member chase down a couple who left right before us a block up the road because they had accidentally left their credit card at the restaurant (this was a very nice gesture I have never seen any working member of a restaurant do before). However, we were informed that because we used the  restaurants.com  coupon, we were not allowed to take any of our leftover food home with us. This spoiled the experience for us.

A little dip in the pool of sweet and sour and I was ready for a daiquiri. Unfortunately, they don't sell alcohol and I came with nothing. Hot tea will do I suppose. The rolls came out quickly after the appetizers, a little too soon in my opinion. I like a little time after I'm done with my started to anticipate my meal. I ordered 3 special rolls Mexican, snow angel, and sunshine. They were all very tasty and fresh. My boyfriend, not into sushi, ordered the rama chicken. They were not stingy on the peanut sauce and he used all his broccoli to try to get every drop. Getting that man to eat vegetables is a feat.

2015-07-28,2.0,"I have no problem with the food that I order here but this tidbit is worth noting based on the customer service aspect of this restaurant. I decided to take my mom here and she tried their tom yum soup. Apparently she couldn't stomach the soup because there were so many pepper seeds and stalks in it (aka things that should not be ingested). She always orders this particular soup at Thai restaurants and never has a problem. She decided that only the shrimp was edible in this particular soup served here. Later on, a waitress comes to check on us and naturally my mother told her that she did not enjoy the soup because of the seeds and stalks/ pulpiness and she was done with it. I guess they thought we wanted to not be charged for the soup or something?? A few minutes later another waitress comes and says out loud in front of lots of people ""BUT YOU ATE THE SHRIMP"" and of course my mother gets pissed off because we weren't trying to scam them, she just told them she didn't like the soup. When we go out to eat we don't send stuff back to get it for free, that's disgusting. I guess they will take the time to sift through the food when you send it back after voicing your dislike of said dish to make sure you didn't eat anything out of it??  They ended up discounting the price of the soup, which was appropriate -- but again, not what we were even hoping to achieve. She simply just no longer wanted the soup sitting in front of her. There were absolutely no apologies given either.  Not only was this situation embarrassing, but it was totally unnecessary. I think they need to teach their staff a better way of handling situations in which the food is sent back. This could have been handled way more professionally.  Also, if a customer does not like their food you should probably just take their word for it. Unfortunately, I will not be coming back after this.

Walking down Clark and Fullerton, I feel like every other storefront is a sushi place. Since this one was basically the only one in the area, it's BYOB, and we had a groupon, we decided to give it a try. Walking in on a Friday at 6, we were the only ones in the entire restaurant. Our food wasn't terrible, so it was a little strange that no one else was there. Wait staff sat us immediately, and opened our bottle of wine for us.  We ordered and our food came out in about 15 minutes. Again, not terrible, just not amazing. I ordered the spicy tuna and tuna avocado rolls, and my friend ordered the fried rice and crunchy spicy salmon rolls. I have to say that the fried rice was the most odd part of the meal. The portion was literally an entire large plate full of rice, and was huge. On top of it, it didn't really taste like fried rice, it was more so just seasoned steamed rice.

I highly recommend the SUNSHINE roll. It's only 5 pieces, but it was absolutely huge! Stuffed with fish, cilantro, and jalapeño it had a good kick but was not over the top. Our spicy scallop roll was pretty basic and I should have asked to add avacado.  I also had a seaweed salad as an appetizer, and it was huge compared to what I get at other sushi places. We had also ordered the fried rice which was light in color and the vegetables were still a little hard. It wasn't he best fried rice I've ever ha but it could have been worse.  We had been browsing groupon between dishes and ironically enough found one for the restaurant. Not too shabby of a deal, $16 for $30. By the end we were so full we had to take half our food home.

It was pretty good quality sashimi, but not the freshest we've had. We tried the volcano roll and their new Hokkaido roll which were very tasty. For dessert we had the green tea ice cream, mango, green tea, & strawberry mochi. The green tea ice cream tasted better than the green tea mochi, but the mochi was ok overall.

It came out in 5 minutes. 3 rangoon in, my beef pad see ew came out, and one more rangoon after that and I also had my Snow Angel roll on the table. Little piggy me. I kinda wished they staggered that out a bit. The crab rangoon was good- nothing amazing, but totally hit the spot for that cream cheesy ooziness inside that crisp fried wonton shell. I tried the roll next, letting my noodles steam beside me, and it was also decent- nothing I went crazy for, but nothing I regretted. The roll looked a bit messy, but it was small enough to place delicately in my mouth, which I appreciated, but still packed enough that you are getting your money's worth. The flavor was nice, but I didn't taste much of the promised spice and cilantro, so I added more wasabi to my soy sauce. The pad see ew is enormous for the price. Lots of large noodles and they don't skimp on the beef or the vegetables. Quite good and I wish I was able to enjoy more of it, but I was already full and not in the mood to take leftovers. I did a lot of damage though and ate all my broccoli so I got my veggies in for the day. Service and restaurant is nice as well. The fish tanks are clean and make for a pretty scene.

2014-06-02,3.0,"Jai-Yen is very close to my house and with a Groupon ($15 for $30), I finally had some incentive to try this place!  The atmosphere is pretty intimate and the restaurant is a little small. I'm not sure if they take reservations but when we got there on Saturday evening, there was only one table open but we were seated right away. Lots of people were going in and out of Jai-Yen, so it must be a popular local spot. Most tables sat 2 - 4 people, but there were a couple larger groups as well. BYOB! The service was very friendly & fast.  If you've read my reviews about crab rangoon before, you know I'm a big fan and will get it anywhere and am rarely disappointed; thankfully, that was the case at Jai-Yen! I also liked that they gave you SIX rangoons. I hate it when restaurants give an odd amount of anything so the entire table stares at the appetizer wondering what jerk will take the last piece.  In terms of the sushi...not necessarily my most favorite - quite frankly, they were a bit bland.  The special on the chalkboard was something along the lines of Crunchy Super White Tuna which was creamy because of all of the avocado stuffed in the roll. The Crunchy Shrimp (""spicy"") is more flavorful than the last, with spicy mayo and unagi sauce on it. The Tropical (""spicy"") also had some sauce/mayo on it, but didn't have that much flavor as expected either. I put ""spicy"" in quotes because they really weren't spicy.  I wasn't blown away by their sushi, but because this place is so close to me, I am definitely willing to go back and try some different rolls again.",0.9799,0.818,0.132,0.05,0.5311990561990562

I'm a fan of hand rolls, which I didn't see on the menu. When I asked about them, they said they could make them. I also heard that the sweet potato roll was tasty, so we ordered a couple of hand rolls, the sweet potato roll and another random roll that was most likely tuna or salmon.

The pad Thai had barely any noodles and the ones that did exist we're little quarter inch pieces that I think they were trying to pass off as legit food, but I was hungry and I was expecting a lot more. These had to be like the last resort bottom of the bag noodles, because they were clearly in pieces. Not to mention, the flavor was totally off, and soupy on top of it. Throwing chicken in bits of sad noodles does not a happy customer make. Then my friends fried rice was totally bland and that was enough motivation to write this.

2013-04-19,5.0,"This place has only become better over the years. Their quality and preparation has improved.  I don't mind the driving to go.  Love the salmon teriyaki (although I order light on the sauce), the mackeral sashimi, and their hot food plates. I think they should have some more options on cooked rice.  Their rice is bland.  They should offer brown rice, sticky rice, etc. They should add that to the menu and refine the rice choices.  I'm really not a sushi person, so I order their cooked entrees also light on the sauce, which I feel brings out the flavor of the food and vegetables that having it drenched in teriyaki sauce which at times they tend to over do.   My initial judge of a good Japanese restaurant is how good the miso soup is and the edamane.  Miso soup was excellent, hot with the right amount of ingredients and the edamane was super fresh and salted perfectly. Delicious green tea, served hot with attentive refills throughout dinner.  I feel the service and quality is really good.  It can be very noisy and each time I go there are always familys with young children.  Not a place for a quiet romantic date.  Try to reserve the window seat, you'll have some privacy forget that the place is filled.

The pros: Friendly, nice and attentive staff.  I asked for water with no ice and the waitress never made a mistake on refilling my water.   Good size portions, the sushi is decent and for the price you pay for sashimi I think it's more than fair.

2013-01-22,5.0,"Every single time I go here I leave happy. I read other people's reviews, first if you are ordering sushi to be delivered, that's your fault. You are doing something very strange and if it arrives cold I really can't feel bad for you. Unless you have no legs get off your tush and walk in. If you have no legs, well. If it's diabete's related I'm not sure you should be eating fried sushi anyway.  I half a mile from here, and I live a block from Nano Sushi, and yet I take the extra couple blocks walk and pay the extra dollar or two each and every time. You can taste where that dollar goes. The fish is always fresh, every ingredient is always perfect and the presentation is always worth a picture. At this stage I've tried nearly everything on their menu, if it sounds like something you would like, then more than likely you will like it.  The BYOB pertains to beer and wine, and there is a 711 a block down the street if you needed such. No liquor. So you know. I've once waited 8 minutes for a table and that happened on a Friday night, other than that the place is always semi slow. Which is nice as they help you immediately and feed you as quick as possible. I honestly cannot say how fortunate I am to live so close to my favorite sushi restaurant, and that it is affordable and consistently perfect. I could do without the music. Why I am forced to listen to blaring techno at a dimly lit sushi bar is beyond me, I suppose it is the edge of boys town so I let it slide.

So I am a big sushi fan and I have to admit I crave it about 99.9% of the time, even if that means I am too lazy to get my butt off the couch, so I tend to order for delivery a lot.  Having said that I feel like there is an art to the delivery of sushi, presentation with sushi emans a lot and it really says wonders about a restaurant when the food is really fresh and presented well even when it is delivered and not served moments after the chef has prepared it.   Okay, not that I gave that preface, onto the actual reveiw. I ordered Jaiyen for delivery a few nights ago just having another one of my classic sushi cravings and went for Jaiyen since it was relatively close and in the mid price range for sushi.  My friend and I ordered the regular miso soup, spicy miso soup, seaweed salad (which I always order), some Shrimp fried rice and spicy Tuna Maki, we were not too hungry so we did not go crazy.  After finishing our food, my friend and I decided overall it was 3.5 starts. It was a little bit above average but nothing amazing. The spicy miso soup was really tasty but I did not get a ton of spice in the soup from the jalapenos which is why I got the spicy miso and not the regular. The Seaweed salad, which I could eat for every meal, was really average, there was very little sauce on it and the flavor was not very good. They put a lime in the container to squeeze on the salad but that did not really help the flavor much. What I did find interesting was they put cucumbers at the bottom of the salad, which I did like like because it added a crispness to the salad. The Shrimp fried rice was actually pretty impressive, there was whole pieced of shrimp and not those little nasty baby shrimp that usually comes in shrimp fried rice, so that was really impressive. The Spicy Tuna Maki was really good, but then again, it is kind of hard to mess up Spicy tuna Maki.   Overall, if you want a less expensive sushi experience, I would say give them a try.

I personally like the seaweed salad and pepper steak, as well as their pad thai and crazy soba noodles, yum! I've had friends come over and ask that we get take our from here.  Dine in service is okay, it can get slow and hard to get someone's attention when it's busy. The place does get a bit packed on weekend evenings. They also put out these small wooden tables when they're busy which are not comfortable, so we don't do dine-in too much. Also, if you happen to carry out, be sure to check the website for free things depending on the amount of your order (free edamame, friend rice, rolls, etc.) They won't mention it, but will give it to you if you mention it and meet the order requirement.

This is exhausting), work is just NOT going well, and by the time you get home you really just want to cry and then die.

2012-10-06,4.0,"A pretty standard BYOB sushi place in Chicago. I like that. The waitresses are very attentive. Since this is a busy spot with proximity to Boystown and Wrigleyville nightlife, they keep the flow of orders going. The vibe is trendy with pop/club type music playing.  I've had the miso soup, which had lots of miso, and was a nice start. My boyfriend and I have had a number of rolls including spicy tuna, spicy salmon, salmon avocado, crazy, futo (with egg, sweet potato, spinach), philly, unagi and spider.  The spicy ones are a bit spicy than other places. Our favorite is the unagi avocado. My big issue is the rice. It doesn't stick together, so oftentimes when you pick up a maki piece, some rice falls off. It's a big frustration of mine when sushi places can't get the rice right, since it's such a big part of their offering. Also, the blenders in the dining room can be a bit disruptive. My boyfriend and I like how everything tastes though. I can't finish my review without mentioning presentation. It's sort of beautiful - I now almost understand what people feel compelled to instagram their food and post it on Facebook. On a recent visit, we went all out and got dessert.

2012-08-27,5.0,"It's funny how some of your regular spots you aren't even purposely looking for and when you find them they're right in front of your face. We each lived by here for years and randomly checked it out.  The atmosphere is pretty inviting and has an open, large dining room with aquariums and modern decor. They have an outside patio which, considering the traffic and people watching on Broadway at that stretch, was something that never appealed to us. It's BYOB with no corkage fee. The service is consistently good.  We have ordered over myriad visits: Miso Soup and Spicy Miso Soup (sometimes w chicken) Good Tom Kar with chicken Rich coconut taste and lots of meat and veggies Seaweed Salad He likes it a lot.  Cashew Chicken w Rice I found boring. He ate it all but was not wowed. Thai Spicy Basil w Chicken and Rice He quite likes and orders often. One time it was spicier than typically.  Red Curry Chicken w Rice Rich and filling. Spicy and Sweet w tons meat and veggies. My fave entree but I love curry. Sushi!  All the rolls and nigiri are delicious. We like Dynamite (by far the best), Dragon, Giant, Red Marine, Volcano, and Spider. Mexican Roll was a let down. Nigiri didn't wow me; but I love rolls, especially if they have a bunch of ingredients and sauces. So I'm not a purist. Also, the sushi is served less than room temperature and sometimes the rolls are messy and rolled loose. Ugh, I hate eating even messier than normal in front of a boy. Dropping rice or chunks of fish or avocado all over a damn table. Even though the menu is fusion and have many options I feel they did not sacrifice quality. Many rolls are unique or Americanized versions but just the same half the items possess authenticity. All items are well executed. This is a regular spot my dc and I enjoy.

""No, really. Can you change the channel."" As she walked away, she said over her shoulder, ""I can't do that for you, sir.""  Because..... you don't want to?

For the most part, I've always gotten my Thai fill at another joint just to the south on Halsted. But this place is closer to home and I was in a hurry to eat and get back to something I needed to work on. I stopped ordering from here a few years ago because I was tired of waiting an extra 10-15 minutes to pick up my food after arriving. I figured things had probably gotten better since then, but I really didn't know how good I had it back then. Sparing you from the lo-o-o-ng story, the Readers' Digest version includes my texting the fiancee to tell her to never allow me to order from here again. Two other people who had ordered carryout milled about, waiting awkwardly in aggravated silence. I'm a really patient guy. I'm more than understanding when a place is busy, but this was just too much, and while I wasn't taking orders or working in the kitchen, they sure didn't seem busy enough to have been struggling this much. When I went up to check on the food, a delivery guy who was trying to help and seemed to be somewhat in charge took my name, turned to where some bags were sitting, and found my order. Last straw. You mean it was ready and no one bothered to say anything?

We also had noodle dishes both times as well and both times have been pleased with the level of spice and flavor. While I've definitely had better noodles, ones that I might be tempted to write home about, these were still quite enjoyable.

2012-04-18,4.0,"My friends and I were pleasantly surprised by this Sushi place. I had no problem reserving a Friday evening table for 7 people the night before we wanted to come. They basically gave us a little room to ourselves. It wasn't until later that other people took the remaining tables, but it was still set back enough to feel rather secluded. Service was decent, but a bit slow. The waitress and her supervisor seemed to be confused by the BuyWithMe deals that we brought. We had 2 coupons which could be combined with 4 or more people. They told us we could only use one, but I pointed out the fine print and they accepted them. There are also good deals on  restaurant.com  right now. It's still quite affordable without any discounts. All of us came prepared for BYOB with a plethora of wine and a couple packs of beer. They brought out a large ice bucket and opened a few bottles for us. They quickly realized we had stockpiled booze and smartly left the corkscrew at our table. They also had the sense to bring out wine glasses for the entire group. We started with two appetizers: Crab Rangoon (pillowy pockets of heaven) and a fried Spicy Tuna Roll (another mouthgasm). It was just enough to tease our tastebuds for the feeding frenzy that was about to begin. One thing to realize is that the time between ordering food and getting it seems to span as long as the Sahara. We got our appetizers 10 minutes later; however, the rest of the rolls didn't show up for half an hour or more. It was worth the wait as everything we ordered was delicious, but it left me extremely hungry in between orders. I only ordered about 3 rolls myself. We placed individual orders but passed them all around. I can definitely recommend Cubby, Mexican and Volcano. These are the specialty rolls that are more expensive. If you really want to stretch your dollar, order a few specialties and then stock up on the regular ones. We polished off a first, second and third round of sushi. I was expecting the bill to be astronomical, but it was surprisingly cheap. It came out to about $160 before tip. I think it was $82 and some change when our vouchers were added, which made it somewhere around $16 per person including a 20% tip for the original amount. It still would have been under $30 per person if we hadn't had any deals.

The food was less than spectacular.   The sushi (Tuna Avo and Salmon Avo was pretty good, but warm as it had been sitting in a bag with warm food for a long time.  The ginger was so skimpy however.  They did use whole chunks of fish instead of chopped up - that part was nice.   The Tom Yum was terrible.  There was just way too much fish sauce - not like any other Tom Yum I've ever had. The crazy noodle dish my boyfriend got was good.  He enjoyed the tender beef. The house salad with ginger dressing was not impressive - a little carrot and 1 tomato slice on top of some iceberg in a small to go box.  Not really worth the $4.95 they charge. They gave us a free veggie pad thai - this was the worst pad thai that both my boyfriend and I had ever tasted.  It was a sad waste of food.

2012-03-07,5.0,"Came here on a friend's recommendation and it quickly became one of my top favorite sushi spots in Chicago! I expected it to be much less expensive (my friend raved about the inexpensive yet delicious sushi), but then I realized that my friend only orders California rolls. Thus, the regular, run-of-the-mill rolls are decently priced, but if you want specialty rolls (which I recommend), you're going to pay a bit more. **Bonus: no corking fee if you bring multiple bottles of wine. I think it's ridiculous when restaurants charge you a corking fee, so off the bat, this is a huge plus!** MAKE A RESERVATION if you're visiting on the weekend!! It fills up fast and I've heard the wait is long.  The group of 4 of us ordered 5 rolls of sushi and for 3 girls and 1 guy and we all were totally satisfied at the end of our meal. Here's what we ordered, in order of preference: 1) Dynamite - the favorite roll of all 4 of us. We each saved our last piece of sushi to be this roll so we could finish each of our meals on a high note. Crispy and served warm, though even after it was cool, it was still delicious! 2) Cubby - has an interesting crunch to it and a great flavor blend.  3) Santa and the Xmas Tree - I would have NEVER thought to put kiwi and/or strawberry on a sushi roll, let alone a raspberry sauce to go with it. I was so surprised by this roll that I'd certainly order it again. I'm glad my friends were the ones that suggested this! Only downside: it's one of the most expensive rolls on the menu. Still - it's worth it! 4) Volcano (maybe it was the dragon roll?) - Not terribly spicy, but not super memorable, either. Very tasty, but the others still surpassed it. 5) Spicy Tuna Deluxe - this roll certainly has a kick to it. Not too much flavor, standard sushi roll, but still good. I'm not great with spicy things, so this is why it is at the bottom of my list.  The employees were nice enough to let our group sit and drink wine and chat almost until closing time.

The first thing I noticed, being the... frugal... person I am, was that the prices for common rolls were pretty reasonable. averaging about $3-5 for six pieces. Not bad! We started with a very well made crab rangoon appetizer. Like most local sushi joints, they had more than a few specialty rolls, which ranged between $7-15. No surprises there.  Our order: Asparagus maki - I'm usually not big on vegetable rolls, but it was a nice balance between asparagus and spicy mayo. Spider maki - Can't go wrong with the soft shell crab Green Turtle - This was a roll loaded with stuff, shrimp, salmon, spicy mayo.  Dynamite - This one is loaded with unagi, crab and avocado and it's deep fried. This was actually my first experience with deep fried maki. It just doesn't seem right on paper, but it felt right on my tastebuds! Service was decent, though a little relaxed, especially seeing as it was 3:00 PM and we were the only ones there. So if you're ever in Lakeview and need an above average sushi experience, I would recommend Jai-Yen. It's BYOB so don't forget to stop by the liquor store first!",0.9834,0.821,0.163,0.017,0.5329613095238096

The guy delivering the food was pretty rude, which was ok because I'm sure being a delivery guy is not the greatest job. My order was wrong.

Definitely will not order there again. An update. So, I called and tried speaking with them again. They told me that I should have called earlier and that they were 'too busy' to deal with the issue.

I ordered the Snow Angel and the Mexican roll as they both had spicy signs and I love spicy food. They were awesome! Great taste, good combinations and very fresh fish! My husband got the Sushi dinner set. He's not a fan of any roll when it comes to sushi, but prefers pure fresh raw fish with rice. He said that's how you can tell which sushi place is good. He really enjoyed his meal and said the nigiri here are super fresh, melt in your mouth and with generous size compare to the price.  I'm not sure if he would normally be this enthusiastic, or If it was because it was BYOB (and we shared a nice bottle of white wine), but either way, we had a great experience. The only down side might be the service - the wait was a little long before we could even order our food (this wait was helped, in part, by the BYOB). It was pretty crowded for Wednesday night and we were very hungry by the time we got there. However,  once we ordered, the food came rather quickly, and server was very friendly.

The inside of the restaurant is perfectly adequate, in the since that it had slightly dimmed lighting, some windows so you know you're not in a cellar, and Asian decorations enough for you to remember you're eating sushi but not enough for you to think you're actually in Asia.  The service was great- maybe because it was lunch and I wasn't dressed like a bum and cus the place wasn't too filled.

Also noticed they had some outside seating; not sure if that is new or if I did not see it before. We tried the bubble tea today for the first time and it was so tasty and refreshing (perfect for a hot steamy day). We also continue to be impressed with the quantity (and quality) of rolls to choose from. Two recommendations to make things even better: 1) Another recent review mentioned a bad smell when they walked in. My wife and I noticed this tonight and it was so bad at our first table we had to ask to change tables. The odor was still noticeable at our new table across the room, but fortunately a lot less strong. Jaiyen, please address this issue ASAP - a bad smell should not be the first thing people notice when they enter a restaurant. Hopefully this will be a quick and easy fix. 2) Please partner back up with Open Table. Many people enjoy using Open Table to book reservations and I noticed this time that you are no longer affiliated with Open Table.

Sushi is always made quickly and is always very good.  My favorite roll is the The Giant roll.  They have a very large roll menu and has something for everyone.  They also have a large non-sushi menu for someone who wants something other than sushi.   I highly recommend this place for a great dinner.  We make a point to have dinner here once a month.",0.9841,0.814,0.186,0.0,0.5807266542980829

Spicy Tuna - good portion of tuna in the roll but it was almost TOO spicy where it masked the taste of the tuna Spicy Scallop - Scallop was good, a little too much mayo for my taste.

First impression was that this place was chic and modern so I was excited thinking I'd try new sushi rolls. We get seated in a small area, and we had 6 people. In their defense, my sister made reservations for 4 and 4 became 6 at the last minute. Although small, it was a nice size to maintain conversation. Their window sills were actually seats too so I enjoyed their use of space.  We get seated and order drinks. One of us has the lime ginger ale and I had the pomegranate ginger ale. Most of their ginger ale is homemade with real ginger so I was excited. The lime ginger ale was delicious. My pomegranate, not so much. It was very syrup-y and tasted like cough medicine. I know some people prefer that taste so whatever. Their service seemed scatter-brained. We were asked for our drink order almost 4 times (not refills, our initial drinks). Also, 3 waitresses asked to take our order. I admire that they were so willing to help but it became confusing as we thought the other just never put in the order. We shared a ton of rolls but I don't remember all their names or what they were. I do remember their Santa/Xmas tree roll and their Snow Angel. Santa roll had fresh strawberries and a raspberry sauce over an Unagi/shrimp tempura roll. The snow angel was ""spicy"" according to them and was a squid roll with cilantro. Everything was tasty but nothing was too memorable. And their spicy was not very. All in all, this place was okay. Sorry for the lack of creativity of this post.

I've been to JaiYen a many occasions when the sushi need strikes, its BYOB and its a 5 min. walk from home. For take-out delivery has always been fast. So why the Buyer Beware and two stars? Yesterday, when that sushi need struck we walked over to pick up our take out and noticed a discrepancy in the price. I always order Sashimi B platter, so when I noticed that they charged $2 more than the advertised price I mentioned it. ""No, no, thats the new price"" I was told. Referring to the menu I noticed that it had the price we usually pay and pointed it out to the server. ""No, no, that is wrong."" Taking out the iPhone and pulling up the online menu, I again showed them they were over charging. Again, I was told ""No, no that price is wrong, its $2 more."" I asked for a new menu with the new price. ""We don't have any."" Really, then charge me the advertised price. ""No, no, its $2 more."" On the verge of screaming ""I want my $2.00!"" I knew it was pointless seeing as how I was speaking to the owner/manager/server. The point of arguing further was lost. I mentioned to them that what they were doing was wrong, but they did not seem to care. I know its only $2.00 but frankly, this is old fashioned bait and switch, and they should have forked over the $2.00 to save a customer.

The menus they provided were their actual carry-out menus with food and water stains all over them. A little ghetto, yes. Then, it took 35 minutes from the time we ordered until we got our food. That's completely ridiculous, considering there were only 4 of us diners there in total.

Even the plate was cold.  After finally getting the attention of our server, the plate was whisked away.  And then whisked back in under two minutes!  Are you serious? Microwave, really?

Good reasonably priced sushi, with good variety. Also have other non-sushi dishes. Try the homemade ginger ale for a change of pace. Sweet potato and baby bear rolls are my favorites.

I'm a huge fan of eel and avocado so the unagi lover was a must.  I  was not let down in the least.  The roll was excellent and pieces of sashimi were just as good.  The roll was topped with a sweet unagi sauce that perfectly complimented the roll.  The only mistake I made was not ordering more of the sushi, and going with a dish of pad thai instead. The Chicken Pad Thai included slices of tofu and tasted very good.  Not the best I've ever had, but a good enough sized portion and it didn't leave me felling like I had just overloaded on carbs.   With the  restaurant.com  gift certificate the final bill came out to $21 (with tip included).  Split between two people, that becomes $10 for a high quality sit down lunch.  You can't beat that period.

2011-01-03,4.0,"Stopped in here because of a Living Social coupon and was pleasantly surprised except for one thing. First, I didn't notice any odd odor other than the air freshener at the entrance between the doors.  This was probably due to the low temperatures, but I can see how that might be an issue in warmer temperatures. Second thing I noticed was the dance/house music being played. Being a DJ myself, this was not a problem because Kaskade is actually one of my favorite producers, but I digress.  The music volume was just right, a little bit louder and it would have been annoying. Ordered the Miso Soup, Dragon, Volcano, and Spicy Tuna rolls with Chicken Teriyaki  just for good measure.  It's pretty hard to get Miso soup wrong, and on a cold day it really hit the spot.  The sushi was actually very tasty, with the Dragon  roll as my favorite.  The chicken teriyaki was very flavorful and soft. Now, the one downside to the whole experience was the water!  The water had a very metallic flavor to it, like it came out of my Grandmother's kitchen sink.  Nothing that a pitcher with built in filter couldn't fix.  The water might just be a moot point since the place is BYOB! We brought a few beers with us, so it really wasn't much of an issue, yet I felt it was enough to subtract a star.  $wise - the total would have been around $56 which seems reasonable.

Thankfully I was able to simply peel it off (because I could pick up the noodles in one peice). Final Verdict - Excellent for sushi, but other items are iffy.

2010-06-30,4.0,"Jai-Yen F'N BROUGHT IT So I needed to update from my last review: My friends and I went here this past Sunday post pride parade - keep in mind the streets were crazy all day, so I am sure Jai-Yen experienced some of that crazy.  We showed up at 8 after 10PM - they close at 10:30.  Initially the waitress said they were closed, but when I said, ""but you close at 10:30"" the lady behind the counter told her to seat us. (The one who seemed to hate her life on our previous visit. Score for her!) So we sit in the bigger room at the window, handing over our 2 bottles of wine and one sake for them to heat up. (BC yes, it is BYOB - another reason we were so late, acquiring the 'B'.) Apparently the boys I was with said ""thank you"" a billion times and our waitress after this was super sweet.   We each ordered their excellent and spicy jalapeno miso soup (made with fresh jalapenos, seeds included!)  For 2 of us Texans and one smart boy from WV, we were big fans. Next up came my friend's Gyoza.  They came deep fried (he says most places he goes they come boiled) with a particularly pungent soy sauce. Everyone agreed they were pretty darn tasty.  Next up: Yellow-tail sashimi with jalapenos and a lemon-soy sauce starter. Yum again. Fresh and nicely prepared. Then the rolls arrived: The Snow Angel was even better than last time. It is described: Hot & Spicy Shrimp, and crisp cucumber, wrapped with Ika (squid), Ebi (shrimp), house spicy creamy sauce, then lightly broiled, and sprinkled with cilantro. It just tastes fabulous! So many flavors, and the creamy sauces are amazing. Not too much rice either, great for one biters!  Fire Dragon Roll Spicy tuna topped with eel, avocado, and unagi sauce This was also decadent deliciousness in your mouth. Sweet and spicy, and creamy with the avocado - great combinations.  Tropical Maki Tuna, yellowtail, scallion, cilantro, jalapeno, cucumber, avocado topped with tempura crunch and spicy mayo We asked for extra jalapenos and they did *not* disappoint.

For two people, two rolls and an appetizer or maybe three rolls is plenty of food. I'm not sure how much I like this, actually -- I like getting a whole bunch of rolls to try and share when I get sushi. So this is a little different from my regular sushi experience, but I still enjoyed it. Besides the food, the restaurant had a nice vibe inside. It's surprisingly big in there, which is pretty unusual for most of the places I go to in Lakeview/Uptown. The waitstaff was really fantastic -- very quick and attentive and friendly. I mentioned that I liked the music playing, and the waiter wrote down the name of the artist and album for me, which was sweet.  Anyway, I definitely plan on going back, but I don't think this will become my go-to sushi place, just because it's really more of a one-roll-will-do-you place than a place where you can order a whole smorgasbord.

In all - everything was excellent and reasonably priced. Will definitely go back.  Not the best place for infants as there is no changing station and the bathrooms are pretty small. Also - they had an interesting music selection - sounded like they had Pandora ""90's reggae"" channel on as we heard UB40, Shabba, and Hey Macerena. Not quite what you'd expect for a Japanese place - but it was fun over some BYO Beers at lunch time.  (Yes, infants, Beers, and sushi at 1:00 pm - why not?)  Overall a great place.

Honestly, when was the last time you paid the same price for a special maki roll as a downtown martini ($12-15) and expected to be full off it? But at Jaiyen, that happens. BYOB and there is NO corkage fee. Imagine the Chris Rock ""no sex in the champagne room"" voice - there is NO corkage fee at Jaiyen, kids. The decor is clean-cut yet funky and cool. A 3-D arrangement of chopsticks on the wall actually became a topic of discussion at our table. Perfect for those first dates where you're stumbling your way through the most awkward dinner of life, but can't have a third drink for fear you'll confirm you're on your way to AA. As for the ambience/patronage/service... Jaiyen played some trippy yet provocative Guns N Roses covers, which were also heavily discussed. The restaurant was fairly busy in the middle of Pridefest, and seemed to be popular with both the straights and gays, always a good sign. Plus, our waitress carefully broke down our tab per person so we didn't have to. And now the most important thing, the food...oh. my. god. I made a rookie mistake of assuming the portions would be teeny tiny and that my garbage disposal of a stomach would require two specialty rolls & a soup. So, so wrong. The tom yum soup kicked my ass with spicyness, but it was so delicious I couldn't stop eating it. With respect to the sushi, I'm very particular about my hamachi (yellowtail) specifically, but i loved it in the Mexican roll I had. Great quality and even better price. The ""By the Beach"" roll sounded expensive at $13, but the size & number of pieces of it were more than enough. A combination of salmon, avocado, orange, cucumber, uzu and wasabi tobiko with a dash of honey mayo blew my taste buds away. Now if only all the sushi restaurants of Chicago could pay a visit to Jaiyen to see how it's done, our reputation for Japanese food would be almost strong as it is for deep-dish pizza.",0.9867,0.759,0.16,0.081,0.5747371031746032

2008-11-13,5.0,"This place is really great for a lot of reasons. Personally, my major complaint with a lot of sushi places is a lack of consistency. However Jaiyen runs strong like the bull, swift as the eagle, and agile as the dolphin in this category. I always order delivery from here and it is consistently delicious.         I grew up in Florida (yes that means I wore shorts and sandals in January and always had sand in indescribable places) and I was spoiled when it came to fresh and delicious seafood as a result. So when I moved up to the frigid north, I was eager to find a good sushi restaurant that could bring me my fix. After about 4-5 attempts from restaurants that will go unnamed, I finally came upon this pearl.       It sounds strange but I've never actually been inside the restaurant so I can't really speak on the merits of its dining area. However, I have rode by it many times and it looks pretty nice.. classic Japanese bamboo and earth-tones kinda shtick (conveniently located next to Bears Like Us... the place to find the perfect gift for all of the burly gay men in your life). I have however ordered delivery from this place dozens of times.       The person who takes the orders over the phone is polite (no excessive background noise and... a complete understanding of English.. glorious!), patient (I cant pronounce a lot of Japanese words... so I choose to sound them out very slowly.. they usually reserve their laughter), and precise (they always get my order right!). They even accommodate my girlfriend who prefers her food with no sauces of any kind. We always get an appetizer of Coconut Shrimp and this dish is simply amazing, seriously if you eat this and don't like it... you are some type of alien creature that I want nothing to do with.... that's right, this dish is so good, if you do not like it... I will not be your friend.       The seafood is always fresh, I really love their Tuna (called Tekka Maki) rolls they are always a healthy purplish and taste hella good (read: smooth and flavorful) My girlfriend always gets the Ebi Tempura Maki with no mayo, which is basically a shrimp tempura roll, it is amazing (read: crunchy and delicious).      I always make it a point to try something new whenever I order from here and they haven't really let me down.. I highly recommend the Giant Roll.. its really dynamite and smothered in all types of sauces (which drives my girlfriend crazy but guarantees a little privacy)       The prices are resonable and are soemtimes even a little bit less than you would find at a higher end sushi joint.      Overall, I highly recommend this place as a serious sushi enthusiast and as a person who visits here often... even though they always visit me.",0.9974,0.776,0.18,0.044,0.5508309697964869

Anyway, the nigiri I ordered -one hamachi and one unagi- (just two because he ordered THREE rolls, and I thought that'd be enough) were great. I think I'll come back here to try more nigiri. Maybe then I'll rate it higher. When the rolls were brought to our table (I probably shouldn't complain about this because all three makis were enough for the two of us) they just looked so petite and tiny. However, they were tasty & delicious. I'm starting to see why people like maki so much. I didn't like their version of tempura. Like I've said in other reviews, I like my tempura delicate, crispy, light, and airy, not crunchy and heavily breaded with panko (or whatever). Yes, this place is BYO, and yes, it's a lovely thing. They put our white wine in a fancy leather and metal ice bucket; very gay (not in the retarded sense, but in the gays-know-how-to-accessorize sense)! They're very down to earth, despite apparent attempts at making the place look contemporary and cool (which usually ends up meaning pretentious and douchy, but not here). The place is small and I think it would benefit from a dimming of the lights. The fish tanks in the walls are a nice touch.

Here's why... - I got the rainbow roll which was pretty rainbow delicious.  However the fish on top was a little warm and the salmon was a little stringy.  I was not impressed. - I also got the soft shell crab roll which was pretty good.  The crab was fried a little harder and with a different coating that I usually like but over all the roll was really pretty good. - The rolls are quite a bit smaller than what I am use to.  My spider roll at four pieces.  Other rolls at the same price were around 6 pieces. - That was the other thing the prices of the rolls for the amount that got seemed a little extravagant. - The miso soup was really good but then again I've never eaten at a sushi joint that could mess up miso soup so I guess that's why I gave it three stars.

So minimalist and trendy that it seems out of place on this rather quiet stretch of Broadway. You get the impression that if more people knew, it would go from dead to packed in a snap. But because it's currently quiet, you sort of end up with a lackluster vibe. They don't have a patio and they didn't appear to be able to open their windows either. It was a little stuffy inside and because we were one of three tables, I could hear the couple sitting across the room talking. Also, because there wasn't much going on, the service was slow to start. I understand that it's hard to get a rhythm when you don't have any tables, but we sat with our menus closed (and hungry!) for about 5 minutes. Of course, because it was dead, the food arrived 10 minutes after we ordered. (Thank goodness.) The sushi was fresh and tasty, but didn't really top any other sushi I've had as of late. The Shanghai noodles, however, were outstanding and I really liked the portioning and plate presentation of both dishes. There were 5 cool cheesecakes listed (ginger-lime, anyone?) but we were too stuffed.  It's BYOB and if you add the bottle of wine we brought, the meal was still under $30.

They also have a few thai dishes, like tom yum and tom kar soups.  Both are delicious. They have a Hawaiian Fried Rice dish worth trying also. Hint:  I really like their take on Pad Thai mounted on a crispy egg platform.  But, if you want Pad Thai the original way, which you can't find anywhere in Chicago, tell them you want the thai version, emphasising it.  Its great and very spicy.  These weren't on the menu when I was there, so you might have to request it. The guys running it are the sons of a previous restauranteur, 3 single guys ladies :-) Their parents used to own another Thai restaurant before retiring, and you will see them there pretty much every nite.  They are great to talk to.  Their dad can talk your ear off on how to properly cook thai food, thai culture, history of other thai restaurants in Chicago, etc.  Very nice people. PS The service is fast, so no worries on ordering a lot of different dishes.  My only complaint was that it can sometimes be too fast, since dishes can come before your finished.  But that isn't that big a deal since the food is really worth it.  The food is very reasonably priced.  Many maki are around $4. I will also update this when I find out the name of their old restaurant. crossstreet is Waveland Avenue.",0.9905,0.8,0.167,0.033,0.5684557823129253
